    "        For many, interaction with a court involves completing a \"form,\" and often, this means filling out either a paper form or pdf facsimile. Occasionally, the latter can be found online and come with embedded fillable fields. Most of the time, however, this just means one can type in the fields before printing the form. The infrastructure that has grown up around court forms too often focus on delivering either a physical form or pictures of such to the court. Very rare is the form that can easily be filled out on a phone absent specialty software, and even more rare is the form that helps guide users through the process. \n",

Yet, the majority of court processes linked to forms have failed to keep pace with our technical ability to offer context-aware mobile friendly fully-electronic interactions. This Form Explorer is part of a broader open-source effort—<a href=\"https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/\" target=\"_blank\">the Document Assembly Line</a>—aimed at changing this.

Eventually, you will be able to go from form to prototype webapp in a few clicks. As time goes by, we'll grow the number of jurisdictions and improve our tools' performance. They'll never do all of the work, but they help plot a course for what otherwise might seem an \"impossible\" task. They'll help make things concrete, allowing for stakeholders and developers to edit their way to a production-ready solution built on suggestions rooted in years of form building experience.\"\"\",path)+fields(field,jur,path)+footer(path)\n",
