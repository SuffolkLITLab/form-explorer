NOTICE

Section 1924, Title 28, U.S. Code (effective September 1, 1948) provides:
“Sec. 1924. Verification of bill of costs.”

“Before any bill of costs is taxed, the party claiming any item of cost or disbursement shall attach thereto an affidavit, made by himself or by
his duly authorized attorney or agent having knowledge of the facts, that such item is correct and has been necessarily incurred in the case and
that the services for which fees have been charged were actually and necessarily performed.”

See also Section 1920 of Title 28, which reads in part as follows:

“A bill of costs shall be filed in the case and, upon allowance, included in the judgment or decree.”

The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure contain the following provisions:
RULE 54(d)(1)

Costs Other than Attorneys’ Fees.

Unless a federal statute, these rules, or a court order provides otherwise, costs — other than attorney's fees — should be allowed to the
prevailing party. But costs against the United States, its officers, and its agencies may be imposed only to the extent allowed by law. The clerk
may tax costs on 14 day's notice. On motion served within the next 7 days, the court may review the clerk's action.

RULE 6

(d) Additional Time After Certain Kinds of Service.

RULE 58(e)

Cost or Fee Awards: 

When a party may or must act within a specified time after service and service is made under Rule5(b)(2)(C), (D), (E), or (F), 3 days are

added after the period would otherwise expire under Rule 6(a).

Ordinarily, the entry of judgment may not be delayed, nor the time for appeal extended, in order to tax costs or award fees. But if a

timely motion for attorney's fees is made under Rule 54(d)(2),  the court may act before a notice of appeal has been filed and become
effective to order that the motion have the same effect under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4) as a timely motion under Rule 59.

A Simple Guide to Filing a Civil Action in the United States District Court for the
District of Massachusetts

You believe that you have been injured or wronged by someone, some individual, corporation or government agency. You also
believe you should be compensated for the harm you have suffered. In order to accomplish this, you have decided to file a civil suit in
the United States District Court, without the help of an attorney.

Fundamental Information

First, there are a few simple concepts you must get to know and understand. The PLAINTIFF is the person who files the lawsuit. The

DEFENDANT is the person who is being sued. If the you are representing yourself without the benefit of an attorney, you are known
as a PRO SE LITIGANT. ""Pro Se"" is a Latin term meaning ""for yourself.""

As a pro se litigant, you enjoy every right entitled to you under the law. Pro se litigants are expected to follow/abide by the rules that
govern the practice of law in the Federal Courts. Pro Se Litigants should be familiar with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the
Local Rules of this Court.

Federal Court vs. State Court

There is a difference between State Court and Federal Court. The difference being in what types of cases (law suits) they can decide.
This is called JURISDICTION. State Court has general/broad jurisdiction, and Federal Court has limited/specific jurisdiction. Under
Federal Court jurisdiction, the two main types of cases are Federal Question Cases (see 28 U.S.C. § 1331) and Diversity Cases (see 28
U.S.C. § 1332)

FEDERAL QUESTION CASES: are cases where the issue involves violation of Federal Law
DIVERSITY CASES: are cases where the Plaintiff and Defendant are citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeds

the sum or value of $75,000., exclusive of interest and costs.

1 Step One

Write Your Complaint

All cases are comprised of documents prepared and filed by litigants. The most common documents are the complaint, answer

and motions. The first document that you must write is called a COMPLAINT ( 

 download ). The function of the COMPLAINT is

to tell the Court and defendant the reason for filing the lawsuit and what relief you desire. The COMPLAINT is made up of four

main parts:

paragraphs.

1. The NAME AND ADDRESS of the plaintiff and the defendant. These are usually listed in the first and second paragraphs

respectively. If there is more than one defendant, list each defendant's name and address in separate additional

2. The JURISDICTION or reason your case is being filed in this federal court. See 28 U.S.C. § 1331 et seq.
3. The ALLEGATIONS or claims that you are making against the defendant. Place each allegation in a short, clearly-written

paragraph. See Rule 10 Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

4. The RELIEF you are seeking from the Court. This can be money or something you want the judge to make the defendant

do or stop doing. This information is usually written in the last paragraph of the COMPLAINT.

Please be sure to number each paragraph except for the paragraph that asks the Court for relief. If you believe you are entitled
to a trial by jury, you must indicate in a paragraph following the relief requested that you claim trial by jury. See Rule 38(b) of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Step by Step Guide to Filing a Civil Action Pro Se | United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts

Do not worry that your COMPLAINT is not professionally written. The Court will take into consideration that you are a PRO SE

litigant and untrained in drafting legal documents. You should, however, make every effort to state your case in clear, concise

terms. See Rule 8 and Rule 10 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Forms for filing a petition under Title 28 U.S.C. § 2254 for writ of habeas corpus by a person in state custody or a motion under

Title 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence by a person in federal custody are available from the PRO SE clerk.

All pleadings submitted to this Court must be on 8 1/2 x 11"" paper. See Rule 5.1 of the Local Rules of this Court.

2 Step Two

File Your Complaint

1. A Civil Cover Sheet

2. A Civil Category Sheet

Your next step is to file the COMPLAINT with the Court. In addition to filing the COMPLAINT, the following forms will have to be
completed and submitted with the complaint:

You will also have to pay a filing fee of $402.00 (see fee schedule) at the time you file your COMPLAINT and cover sheets. The
filing fee for a petition for writ of habeas corpus is $5.00. The filing fee, however, may be waived if you cannot afford to pay it.
For more information, see below. All checks or money orders should be made payable to: ""CLERK, UNITED STATES DISTRICT
COURT"".

IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY THE FILING FEE you may be allowed to have the filing fee waived if you fill out the

following form and send it to the Court with the COMPLAINT and Cover Sheets:

1. Application to Proceed Without Prepayment of Fees and Affidavit

When you file the COMPLAINT, Cover Sheets, and Application to Proceed Without Prepayment of Fees, each of these will be
reviewed and forwarded to a United States District Court Judge for his or her consideration. If your Application is approved, the
filing fee will be waived. If your Application is not approved, you must pay the filing fee.

Although not required to prepay the filing fees for civil complaints and appeals, PRISONERS are required to pay the full filing

fee of $402.00 for civil actions and $455.00 for appeals in forma pauperis. If insufficient funds exist in the prisoner's account, the
Court must assess and, when funds exist, collect, an initial partial filing fee of 20 percent of the greater of:

1. the average monthly deposits to the prisoner's account; or
2. the average monthly balance in the prisoner's account for the prior six-month period.

Thereafter, the prisoner will be required to make monthly payments of 20 percent of the preceding month's income. The

agency having custody of the prisoner must forward payments from the prisoner's account to the clerk of court each time the

amount exceeds $10.00 until the filing fees are paid in full. See 28 U.S.C. § 1915 regarding proceedings in forma pauperis

pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (Pub. L. No. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321.)

A PRISONER who cannot pay the entire filing fee and who is seeking to proceed in forma pauperis must submit along with the

complaint, cover sheet and category sheet:

1. the Application to Proceed Without Prepayment of Fees and Affidavit (AO 240) form with:

a. completed certificate portion of the AO 240 form by the institution of incarceration; and

2. certified copy of the prisoner's trust fund account (or institutional equivalent) for the prior sixmonth period.

For a plaintiff proceeding in forma pauperis, the Court will review the complaint and other documents and shall dismiss the case

3 Step Three

Judicial Review of Complaint

at any time if the Court determines that:

1. the allegation of poverty is untrue;

2. the action or appeal --

a. is frivolous or malicious;
b. fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted; or

c. seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief.

Step by Step Guide to Filing a Civil Action Pro Se | United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts

The Court will also review the prior submissions of prisoners to determine if a prisoner proceeding IFP has, on three or more

occasions, while incarcerated, brought an action or appeal in a federal court that was dismissed on the grounds that it was
frivolous, malicious, or failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, unless a

prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury, he or she may not bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a
civil action or proceeding in forma pauperis, if, on three or more previous occasions, the prisoner has brought an action or

appeal in a federal court that was dismissed on the ground that the action or appeal was frivolous, malicious, or failed to state a

claim upon which relief could be granted. In cases in which the prisoner has had three or more previous matters dismissed for
one or more of these reasons, the prisoner must pay the entire filing fee at the time the civil action or appeal is filed or his

action or appeal may be dismissed. See 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g).

Even if your complaint is dismissed, you will still be obligated to pay the full amount of the filing fee.

4 Step Four

Service of Process
If you have paid the filing fee or have been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis, the clerk will issue a summons which
will be sent to you.

Your next step is to SERVE (inform) each of the defendants that he or she is being sued. This may be done in two ways:

1. NOTICE & REQUEST FOR WAIVER OF SERVICE

If you are suing the United States (and its agencies, corporations, or officers) or a state, local or foreign government, you

CANNOT use Form AO 398 and YOU MUST arrange for Service of Process (which is described below).

You may notify the defendant(s) of the commencement of the lawsuit by sending a ""NOTICE OF LAWSUIT AND REQUEST

FOR WAIVER OF SERVICE OF SUMMONS"" - Form AO 398 and AO 399 along with a copy of the complaint by first-class
mail or other reliable means. You must also include a copy of the Waiver of Service of Summons form - AO 399 and a self

addressed return envelope. See Rule 4(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. If service is waived by the defendant the
Waiver of Service form is returned to the plaintiff for filing with the Court and the action shall proceed. If the defendant

does not waive service, the plaintiff must proceed with service of process.

2. SERVICE OF PROCESS

Making ""service of process"" involves serving a copy of a summons and a copy of the complaint to each of the defendants.

A SUMMONS is a writ used to notify the person named as the defendant of the commencement of the civil action and the
requirement to appear and answer. The summons must contain the name of the Court and the names of the parties, be

directed to the defendant, state the name and address of the plaintiff's attorney, if any, otherwise the plaintiff's address
and the time within which the rules require the defendant to answer the complaint.

If a defendant has not ""waived service of summons"" OR you are suing a government (federal, state, local, foreign) YOU

MUST ARRANGE to have a copy of an original summons and a copy of the complaint served upon each defendant.

You must complete a summons for each defendant and present each summons to the Clerk who will sign and place the

court seal on each summons. A copy of the summons must be served upon each defendant with a copy of the complaint.
The original summons should be kept by the person making service.

You can make service of process by having a ""disinterested"" person who is over the age of eighteen deliver copies of the

SUMMONS and COMPLAINT to each of the defendants. When using this method of making service of process, have the
server fill out the back of the original SUMMONS, and send it to the Court. See Rule 4, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

If you have filed an Application to Proceed Without Prepayment of Fees and it has been allowed by a Judge, service of
process will be made upon each defendant, without cost to you, by the United States Marshal. However, you are

responsible for completing all of the forms required by the Marshal for service. You will receive instructions on this
matter from the PRO SE Clerk after the Judge has approved your application.

If you have filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 for a writ of habeas corpus, a petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 for writ of

habeas corpus by a person in state custody, or a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence by

a person in federal custody, an order will be issued by the Court concerning service upon the respondents. No Summons
are issued in these types of cases.

NOTE: Service of the SUMMONS and COMPLAINT on the defendant must be made within 90 days from the date the

complaint was filed or the case will be subject to dismissal. See Rule 4(m), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

For more information, read Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or contact the PRO SE Clerk.

Things You Should Know About

The ANSWER is the formal written statement by the defendant responding to a complaint setting forth any defenses and objections
to the claims by the plaintiff.

A MOTION is an application or request made to the Court for the purpose of obtaining a ruling or order directing some act to be
done in favor of the applicant. See Rule 7(b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rule 7.1.

IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD AN ATTORNEY you may make a written motion asking the Court to appoint an attorney for you. Use the

same heading that you used on your COMPLAINT, but entitle the document ""Motion for Appointment of Counsel"". In your motion,
provide the Court with your financial status, your attempts, if any, to find a lawyer, and any other information which would be helpful

to the Court in determining whether a lawyer should be appointed for you. The Court is not required to appoint an attorney, but
may request an attorney who has indicated a willingness to accept such cases on a pro bono basis to represent you. See Title 28

U.S.C. § 1915.

After the Answer

In most cases the Court will issue a SCHEDULING ORDER which sets forth a timetable with deadlines the litigants must follow

The DISCOVERY PERIOD is the time frame allowed by the Court for both plaintiff and defendant to discover facts, research the law,
and gather evidence to be presented at trial to prove the litigant's position/case. See Local Rules 26.1 through 26.6 and 33.1 through

37.1. The Discovery period always comes after the filing of the answer by the defendant, and before the 1st day of the trial.

Whenever you file a document with the Court, you must always:

1. Send a copy to each of the parties, or their lawyers, who are involved in the case and indicate at the end of the document that

you have done so in accordance with Local Rule 5.2

2. Provide the correct civil action number of your case on both the document and the front of the envelope in which it is enclosed.
3. Sign all documents you file with the Court. Place the words ""PRO SE"" after your name. Place your address and telephone

number on all documents.

Pro Se (Non-prisoner) Consent & Registration Form  
to Receive Documents Electronically 

arties who are not represented by an attorney and are not currently incarcerated may choose to receive 
documents in their cases electronically (by e-mail) instead of by regular mail. Pro se litigants interested 
in receiving documents electronic via the Court’s Case Management/Electronic Case Files (CM/ECF) 
System must complete and sign the attached form and are strongly encouraged to sign up for a Public 
PACER1 login and password by contacting PACER www.pacer.uscourts.gov or 1-800-676-6856.  

f you consent to receive documents electronically, you will be sent notices of electronic filing via e-
mail. In your e-mail mailbox, the notice will be from “ecf_bounce” and the subject will be “Activity in 
Case [xx]-cv-[xxx].” Upon receipt of a notice, you will be permitted one “free look” at the document by 
clicking on the hyperlinked document number, at which time you should print or save the document to 
avoid future charges. The one ‘freelook’ will expire in 15 days from the date the notice was sent. 
After the “free look” is used or expired, the document can only be accessed by you through PACER or 
by visiting the public terminal at the courthouse. For this reason, you should print or save the document 
during the “free look” to avoid future charges.  

y registering for electronic notification, you will be waiving your right to receive service of court 

issued documents such as notices, notices of hearings, decisions, opinions, memoranda & orders, orders, 
and judgments in paper form by mail.  Because you will be receiving court-issued documents only in 
electronic form, you must maintain a valid e-mail address and regularly check your e-mail. 

lectronic service does not allow you to file documents electronically and does not mean that you can 

serve documents by e-mail to the opposing party. You must continue to file all communications 
regarding your case in paper copy with the Court and to serve the opposing party.   
 

 
To be eligible you must: 

•  Not be incarcerated; 
•  Have a valid e-mail address;  
•  Have regular access to a computer; and 
•  Regularly review the docket sheet2 of the case. 
• 

It is highly recommended that you establish a PACER account.  

                                                                        
1 Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) (www.pacer.uscourts.gov) is an electronic public access service that allows users to 
obtain case and docket information from federal appellate, district, and bankruptcy courts, and the PACER Case Locator over the internet.   

 The docket sheet is the official record of all filings in a case. You can view the docket sheet, including images of electronically filed 
documents, using PACER or you can use one of the public access computers available in the Clerk’s Office at the Court.

 agree to promptly notify the Court if there is a change in my personal contact information, such 
as name, address, and/or e-mail address. I understand that this consent is limited to the case 
specified above, and I will promptly notify the Court and opposing counsel to request

 understand that upon receipt of an electronic notice, I am permitted one “free look” 
at the document by clicking on the hyperlinked document number. The one “free look” will 
expire 15 days from the date the notice was sent. After the “free look” is used or expires, the

t is recommended that litigants establish a PACER account.  This can be accomplished by

  A pro se party is a person who represents himself or herself in a lawsuit. Most pro se parties 
have difficulty understanding the legal process and legal terms that may be used during a case. 

This  Guide  is  intended  to  provide  some  basic  information  to  assist  pro  se  parties  in 
understanding  generally  how  a  legal  case  progresses,  some  of  the  more  common  court 
procedures that a case may involve, and certain responsibilities parties may have in a case.   
The Guide also includes a glossary of basic legal terms that may be used during a case. See 
Appendix A, Glossary of Terms. 

The  Guide  identifies  documents  you  may  need  to  file  in  a  case.  Forms  and  suggested 
formats for these documents are available at the court clerk’s office, in most libraries in the 
state and federal correctional facilities located in New Hampshire, and on the court’s website:   
www.nhd.uscourts.gov. If you need a document that you cannot find at one of these locations, 
you can prepare the form yourself as outlined in Local Rule 5.1. See Local Rule 4.3(c).     
 

ro se parties, like attorneys who practice before this court, must comply with all 
applicable rules and laws, including the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules 
of Evidence, the Local Rules for the United States District Court for the District of New 
Hampshire, the Administrative Procedures for Electronic Case Filing (“ECF”), and other 
rules or laws which apply to your case.

B.  ROLE OF COURT STAFF IN A PRO SE CASE 

The court clerk’s office is open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. each business day. Although 

the clerk’s office staff can provide you with general information about court rules and how 
the process works, they are prohibited by law from: 

  giving you legal advice,   
  explaining how court rules apply to your case,   

-1- 

I.  INTRODUCTION 

  This section will explain: 

  How to use this Pro Se Guide 
  What court staff can and cannot help you with 
  Where you can find the laws and rules that apply to your case 
  Your responsibilities when you represent yourself 
  How to find an attorney who can represent you 

A. 

PURPOSE OF THIS GUIDE 

 

   

You are prohibited from all private communications with the judge assigned to your case.   

This is known as “ex parte communication.” Ex parte communication occurs when one of 
the parties to a lawsuit, or when that party’s attorney, exchanges information with the judge 
without the opposing party being present or without the knowledge and consent of the 
opposing party.   

ecause of this prohibition, a judge will refuse, with very few exceptions, to speak or 
otherwise communicate ex parte with any party, or that party’s attorney, regarding a pending 
case. You may not communicate directly with a judge by letter. Any communication 
between a litigant and the assigned judge must be made by formal pleading, such as a motion 
or objection, and may not be made in letter format. Local Rule 77.6. Additionally, a copy of 
the pleading must be sent either to the opposing party or that party’s counsel, or must be 
presented in person in the presence of all parties to the action. 

C.  ACCESS TO FEDERAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES AND THIS 
COURT’S LOCAL RULES OF PROCEDURE 

As a pro se party, you must become familiar with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 
the Federal Rules of Evidence, this court’s local rules and administrative procedures for ECF.   
These rules explain the general procedural requirements for litigating cases in all federal 
courts and hard copies are available for you to use in the clerk’s office main lobby. They are 
also available on the court’s website.   

he local rules of this court are available for purchase at the clerk’s office for $4.50 for a 
book version. Federal laws can be found in the United States Code (abbreviated as U.S.C.).   
Pro se parties should be aware that the court’s website also contains frequently used forms, 
frequently asked questions, general information, and other useful reference links. 

Many public libraries have computers with internet services that are available to the 
public for reviewing these publications. For incarcerated pro se parties, the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Evidence, and the local rules of this court should be 
available in the library of all federal and state correctional institutions located in New 
Hampshire.

  T

  recommending a course of action,   
  predicting a judge’s decision on any given matter, or   
  explaining the meaning of a court order or judgment.   

 

 
  Also, the judges of this court cannot give you legal advice.

Self-representation carries certain responsibilities and risks that pro se parties should be 
aware of before they file a case. Individuals who are considering representing themselves are 
encouraged to carefully review the risks associated with self-representation and to educate 
themselves regarding potential consequences. Even if you would like to represent yourself, it 
may help to talk to an attorney who can explain some of the risks applicable to your 
particular case. 

Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure prohibits filing lawsuits that are clearly 
frivolous or filed merely for purposes of harassment. If after reviewing your complaint the 
court determines that you have filed a lawsuit for an improper or clearly unnecessary 
purpose, it may impose sanctions against you, including ordering you to pay a fine to the 
court or to pay the legal fees of the person against whom you filed the lawsuit.   

n certain types of cases, if you lose you may be required to pay the legal fees of the 
winning party. In all cases, if you lose you may be required to pay some of the costs the 
winning party incurred in the course of the lawsuit. See this Guide § VI(B), “Bill of Costs.” 

  I

E.  REQUIREMENTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PRO SE 
PARTY 

The following list of responsibilities a pro se party has when pursuing a civil case before 
this court is not intended to be complete and only provides a few examples of the way pro se 
parties are expected to act when filing and pursuing an action in this court: 

 
D.  CAUTIONARY NOTE 

1.  You are required to diligently prosecute your case. Unless and until you obtain an 
attorney to represent you, it is your responsibility to do everything necessary to prepare 
your case for trial. This includes, but is not limited to, responding to discovery requests 
and motions. It is also your responsibility to present your case in court during the trial. 

2.  Do not expect any instructions from the court explaining procedures for pursuing 
your lawsuit. If you fail to follow established procedures, your case may be dismissed for 
failure to properly and diligently pursue your case. 

3.  You are required to give the defendant’s attorney (or the defendant, if the defendant is 
also appearing pro se) copies of all pleadings and motions filed with the court. Likewise, 
the defendant or the defendant’s attorney is required to give you copies of all pleadings 
and motions filed on behalf of the defendant. This requirement is also referred to in the 
rules as “serving” the opposing party with copies of documents filed with the court. 

4.  You must keep the court and the defendant advised of any change in your address or 
telephone number. Failing to do so immediately may result in sanctions, which may 
include the dismissal of your case. 

-3- 

 

 

 

 

 

   

5.  You should keep a copy of all documents filed with the court for your own records.   
Please note that the court clerk’s office charges fifty cents (.50) per page for all copy 
requests and that this fee applies even when the copies are requested by a party to a case. 

.  The Local Rules of this court specify standard formats for filing. You should try to 

follow these rules. But if you do not have access to forms, a word processor, or a 
typewriter you may file documents in a format substantially similar to the prescribed 
format. 

F. 

ALTERNATIVES TO PROCEEDING PRO SE 

Most people who file and pursue litigation in this court employ an attorney, admitted to 

both the New Hampshire Bar and the bar of this court. These attorneys have appeared in 
court, and are familiar with the rules of procedure that govern court processes.   

ome attorneys may be willing to accept a reduced fee or lenient fee payment schedule. 
Other attorneys may be willing to accept your case on a contingent fee basis, which means 
the attorney would receive a fee based upon a percentage of your recovery if you win your 
case and would receive nothing if you do not win. Some attorneys also offer “limited 
representation,” meaning that they may help you evaluate your case, or draft a pleading, 
without requiring that you hire them for the entire case. Local Rule 83.7. Finally, in some 
limited circumstances the other side may be required to pay your attorney’s fees if you win 
your case. 

If you would prefer to have an attorney represent you but you are unable to retain one, 
you should consider contacting the following services which, in some cases, can provide free 
or low-cost legal assistance:

PLEASE NOTE: If you are represented by an attorney, you may not file pleadings in your 
case unless the court grants a motion allowing you to file a pro se pleading, you are filing a 
motion related to the status of your counsel, or your attorney is providing limited 
representation and you are otherwise acting pro se. See Local Rule 4.3(e). 

G.  WHO YOU MAY REPRESENT AS A PRO SE PARTY 

If you do not want an attorney or are unable to find an attorney to represent you, you 
have the right to pursue your claims in court by appearing pro se. As a pro se party, you are 
representing only yourself and presenting only your claims and defenses. Under the law, 
you cannot speak for another person or other entity such as a company, club, association, or 
trust (unless you are the sole beneficiary of the trust). You may not represent a class of 
people in a class action lawsuit. See Local Rule 83.2(d) & 83.6(b).   

 pro se party may not authorize another person who is not an attorney and a member of 
the bar of this court to appear for them. This includes a spouse, relative, or any other party on 
the same side who is not represented by an attorney. This means that each pro se party must 
personally sign the complaint and all additional pleadings they file with the court. Each pro 
se party must also personally appear in court when ordered to do so for conferences, 
hearings, trials, or other matters.   

H.  ELECTRONIC CASE FILING INFORMATION 

The court has the ability to accept pleadings filed electronically through the Internet. A 
non-prisoner who is a party to a civil action and who is not represented by an attorney may 
file a motion to obtain an Electronic Case Filing (ECF) login and password. A form motion 
to obtain a login and password for ECF is available in the clerk’s office and on the 
Frequently Used Forms section of the court’s website. 

efore filing your motion to obtain an ECF login and password, you should make sure 

that you have the computer systems needed to file and receive electronic documents.   

If you are permitted to file electronically, you will be required to follow the court’s 

Supplemental Rules for Electronic Case Filing, which are located in Appendix A to the Local 
Rules. In addition, you will need to obtain a PACER account to use the ECF system. You can 
obtain a PACER account by calling the PACER service center at (800) 676-6856 or (210) 
301-6440 or you may register for a PACER account online at http://www.pacer.gov.

II.  FILING A LAWSUIT 

  This section will explain: 

  How to figure out which court to file your case in 
  What you need to file to start your lawsuit, which may include: 

o  Complaint, Petition for Habeas Corpus, or Motion to Vacate 
o  Filing Fee or Motion to Proceed In Forma Pauperis 
o  Summonses for each defendant 

  The format your documents should follow 
  Where to file your documents 

A. 

JURISDICTION – ARE YOU IN THE RIGHT COURT? 

The United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire is a federal trial court.   

Federal courts only have jurisdiction, or legal authority, to hear certain types of cases. As is 
the case in all federal trial courts, this court is generally authorized only to hear cases that fall 
into the following four categories: 

1.  Those that deal with a question involving the United States Constitution; 

2.  Those that involve questions of federal law (as opposed to state law, unless there is a 
state law claim related to a federal claim being made, in which case the court may agree 
to consider it); 

3.  Those that involve the United States as a party, whether as a plaintiff or defendant; 
and 

4.  Those that involve a dispute among residents of different states with an amount in 
controversy exceeding $75,000. 

If your case does not fall under any of these categories, you should not file it in this court. 

B.  WHAT TO FILE 

1.  Complaint 

 

The complaint is the document that a plaintiff files with the Clerk of Court to initiate 

 
a lawsuit. Only the original is filed with the court. See Appendix D, Sample Complaint 
Format; Appendix E-1, Complaint Form; Appendix E-2, Instructions & Complaint Form 
for Person in Custody. A fillable PDF version of the Complaint Form is also available on 
the court’s website. All complaints should contain: 

-6- 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

a.  A caption or heading specifying the court in which the suit is brought and the 
names of the parties; 

b.  A title, simply “Complaint” or, if a jury trial is requested, the demand should be 
made immediately following the title to read “Complaint with Jury Demand”; 

.  A numbered paragraph (or paragraphs if there is more than one plaintiff) 
containing the name and address of (each) plaintiff; 

  c

d.  A numbered paragraph (or paragraphs if there is more than one defendant) 
containing the name and address of (each) defendant; 

e.  A numbered paragraph stating why the court has jurisdiction, or legal authority, to 
hear this case (see explanation of “jurisdiction” in Section II(A) of this guide); 

f.  Numbered paragraphs each containing a statement of those facts that are alleged 
to have caused the damage claimed.   

  These allegations, or claims, should be concise and clearly written.   
  There should be a separate numbered paragraph for each factual allegation 

  The statement of facts should include a description of what the defendant(s) 
did or failed to do and how those acts or omissions caused injury or damage, 
as well as a description of any injury sustained and what medical treatment, if 
any, was required.   
It is important to be as specific as possible in stating the facts.     

 
  Names, dates, and events should be described accurately and as succinctly as 

made.   

possible.   

  Failure to allege facts demonstrating that each defendant was personally 

involved in and/or responsible for the alleged incident or harm may result in 
dismissal of that defendant or the case; 

g.  A closing or final paragraph, which is not numbered (note: this is the only 
paragraph in the complaint that is not numbered), outlining the relief being asked of 
the court. This can be money or something the plaintiff wants the court to do to 
correct the situation (or both); and 

h.  The plaintiff’s original signature over the plaintiff’s printed/typed name (followed 
by the words “pro se”), address, and phone number. If there is more than one 
plaintiff, the complaint must contain an original signature for each plaintiff. 
 

-7- 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

A $402.00 fee ($350.00 filing fee plus $52.00 administrative fee) is required 
when filing a complaint. You may use a credit or debit card, money order, cashier’s 
check, or cash to pay the filing fee. Cashier’s checks and money orders should be 
made payable to “Clerk, U.S. District Court.” A personal check is not an acceptable 
form of payment. You should note that filing fees sometimes are changed. A current 
list of filing fees is available on the court’s website: www.nhd.uscourts.gov under the 
Court Information tab, and in the clerk’s office. 

b.    Application to Proceed Without Prepaying Fees/Costs-Non-Prisoner Cases 

If you are legally indigent and cannot afford to pay the $402.00 fee, a request to 

waive the fee can be made by filing, along with the complaint, an Application to 
Proceed Without Prepaying Fees or Costs (AO239) (available in the clerk’s office and 
on the court’s website). The application will be submitted to a magistrate or district 
judge for approval. The court may require you to file additional documents to support 
your declaration that you are unable to pay the filing fee. See Local Rule 4.2(a)(1). 

f the application is denied by a magistrate judge, you may appeal the ruling to a 

district judge, or if it was denied by a district judge you may be able to appeal it to the 
court of appeals; otherwise, the filing fee must be paid. If the application is granted, 
the filing fee will be waived. You remain responsible, however, for all other costs 
associated with the litigation unless an application for an additional waiver is made 
by motion and granted by a judicial officer of this court. See Appendix C, Filing 
Requirements. 

c.  Application to Proceed Without Prepaying Fees/Costs-Prisoner Cases 

Pursuant to federal law, when a prisoner files a civil rights or other civil case, the 
plaintiff shall be assessed a fee of $402.00. If unable to pay the fee, the plaintiff must 
file, along with the complaint, an Application to Proceed Without Prepaying Fees or 
Costs (AO239), a Certificate of Custodial Institution Form, and a Prisoner Litigation 
Reform Act Consent Form (all forms available in the clerk’s office and on the court’s 
website).    Unless the court determines that the complaint presents an emergency 
requiring immediate court action, no action will be taken on the complaint until all of 
these forms have been filed.   

nce these forms are filed, the application will be submitted to either a magistrate 

or district judge for consideration. If the judge grants the application, the judge will 
assess an initial partial filing fee that will be taken from the prisoner's inmate account. 
Thereafter, prison officials will deduct 20% of each preceding month’s income 
credited to the prisoner’s inmate account and will transfer those monies to the Clerk

a.  Filing Fee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

of Court until the filing fee is paid in full. Because the $52.00 administrative fee does 
not apply to prisoners granted leave to proceed without prepaying fees or costs, the 
amount of the filing fee that must be paid is $350.00.   

f the judge denies the prisoner’s application, a $402.00 fee must be paid or an 

appeal of the denial of application may be taken to either a district judge, if the 
decision had been made by a magistrate judge, or the court of appeals.   

f the application is granted, the plaintiff is still responsible for all other costs 
associated with the litigation, unless an application for additional waiver is made by 
motion and granted by a judicial officer. See Appendix C, Filing Requirements. 

  I

  I

The plaintiff is liable for the full filing fee regardless of the outcome of the case.   

Therefore, once the initial payment toward the filing fee is made, if the complaint is 
dismissed for any reason prior to collection of the full filing fee, the court will 
continue to collect money from the prisoner’s trust account as ordered until the entire 
filing fee is paid. If the prisoner is released from custody, the filing fee still must be 
paid in full. If the initial filing fee is not paid, the action will be dismissed without 
prejudice and the filing fee will not be collected. 

The filing fee for a habeas corpus petition is $5.00, not $350 plus the $52 
administrative fee. If an application to proceed without prepayment is granted in a 
habeas case, the petitioner will not be required to pay any portion of the $5 fee. If the 
request is denied, the petitioner must pay the fee in one payment and not in 
installments. 

All plaintiffs, whether or not they have paid the filing fee or intend to proceed without 

prepaying fees or costs, must complete and submit a summons form (except for the date 
and signature line) for each defendant at the same time the complaint is filed. See Local 
Rule 4.1. Summons forms are available at the clerk’s office and on the court’s website. 
See Appendix F, Sample Summons Form.   

he plaintiff must provide the most complete known name and address for each 
defendant. It is the plaintiff’s responsibility to determine the identity of all defendants. If 
any summons form is missing for any defendant, the plaintiff will be directed to fill out a 
summons form and submit it to the clerk’s office, or that defendant may be dismissed 
from your case.

4.  What to File if the Dispute is Between Residents of Different States with an 

Amount in Controversy Exceeding $75,000 (Jurisdiction is Based on Diversity of 
Citizenship) 

As noted in Section II (A) above, you may file a civil case in federal court when you 

have a claim based on a violation of the United States Constitution or federal statute, 
which is known as federal question jurisdiction, or if you have a claim against a resident 
of a different state and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, which is known as 
diversity jurisdiction. If the right to file in federal court is based on diversity jurisdiction, 
you must file a Diversity Disclosure Statement. See Local Rule 7.1.1. A Diversity 
Disclosure Statement is available at the clerk’s office and on the court’s website. See 
Appendix G, Diversity Disclosure Statement Form. 

5.  What to File in 28 U.S.C. § 2254 Cases (Habeas Corpus Petitions Filed by a 

Person in State Custody) 

.  An Application to Proceed Without Prepayment of Fees or Costs (AO239) and a 
Certificate of Custodial Institution Form (all available in the clerk’s office and on the 
court’s website). 

.   If this is a second or successive § 2254 case, you must also file an order from the 

Court of Appeals granting your motion to have the district court consider your

FILING REQUIREMENTS - FORMAT OF FILINGS 

The terms “filings” or “pleadings” refer generally to all documents filed with the court.   
Filings must be on 8 x 11 inch paper of good quality. All pleadings shall be submitted in the 
English language unless a translation is provided. Filings should have no less than one inch 
margins, with page numbers on the bottom center of each page, and be double-spaced. They 
must be stapled or otherwise attached but shall not be permanently bound. All affidavits must 
include the title of the document they support or oppose, for example, “Affidavit in Support 
of Objection to Motion to Dismiss.” See Local Rule 5.1. 

All motions or other requests for judicial action must be submitted in pleading format and 

not in letter format. Local Rule 77.6. Although it is preferable that pleadings be typewritten 
(in a font size no smaller than ten characters per inch or, if a proportionately spaced font is 
used, no less than twelve point), handwritten documents are acceptable. So the court may 
fully understand the claims, however, care should be taken with handwritten documents to 
ensure that they are clear and legible. In the case of prisoners, a pleading will not be rejected 
for failure to conform to the exact requirements outlined here, but all reasonable efforts 
should be made to comply with the format required by court rules. 

  All filings must: 

1.  Contain the caption of the case, including the name of the court, the parties, and the 
complete civil action number assigned to the case (once assigned); 

2.  Contain a title describing the contents of the filing; 

3.  Identify the party on whose behalf the filings are made; 

4.  Include the plaintiff’s address and telephone number (if any); 

5.  Contain the original signature of each plaintiff, with the words “pro se” following 
the signature; and 

 

-11- 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

6.  Contain a certificate of service (for paper filings other than the original complaint or 
petition). Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(a), every pleading, 
correspondence or other document filed after the original complaint, unless it is being 
filed ex parte (without the knowledge or notice to the opposing party), must be served 
upon each of the parties who have appeared in the case. Each such pleading must contain 
a certificate of service that states the name and address of the attorney or party served, the 
manner of service, and the date of service. See Local Rule 5.1. This lets the court know 
that the other parties have been served with a copy of the same document filed with the 
court. Note that you do not need a certificate of service for any party served electronically 
using the court's electronic filing system if you have permission to file documents 
electronically in the case. An example of a certificate of service is: 

I certify that a copy of the foregoing (name of the pleading/document) 

was mailed/hand delivered to (name of defendant(s) or counsel for the 
defendant(s)) at (address(es)) on (date). 

Original signature, pro se 
Typed name, address and phone number 

D.  WHERE TO FILE 

The complaint, filing fee or Application to Proceed Without Prepaying Fees or Costs (and 

any supporting material), should be filed with the clerk’s office at the following address: 

Office of the Clerk of Court 
United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire 
Warren B. Rudman United States Courthouse 
55 Pleasant Street - Room 110 
Concord, New Hampshire 03301-3941 

The documents may be mailed or delivered in person. There is also a 24-hour depository 
located at the south entrance of the Cleveland Building. If you utilize the 24-hour depository, 
be sure to stamp the pleading, not just the envelope, with the date/time stamp available at the 
24-hour depository. Pleadings left in the 24-hour depository are retrieved once daily, between 
7:30 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. No filings or letters should ever be mailed directly to the judge 
unless a party is specifically ordered to do so. 

Upon filing, all civil cases will be assigned at random to one of the judges of this court.   

Assignments are made randomly so that no party or lawyer may choose the judge to whom 
the case is assigned.   

 

-12- 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

   

If the case is initially assigned to a magistrate judge, the parties must complete and file a 
""Notice of Assignment to United States Magistrate Judge and Consent Form"" (available on-
line and in the clerk's office) and shall indicate whether all parties consent to the case 
assignment to a magistrate judge. If the parties do not consent, the case will be reassigned to 
a district judge. See Local Rule 73.1(b)(2). If the case is initially assigned to a district court 
judge, the parties can voluntarily agree to reassign the case to a magistrate judge by filing a 
""Notice, Consent, and Order of Reference Form"" (available on-line and in the clerk’s office) 
stating that all the parties consent to the reassignment. See Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 
73(b); Local Rule 73.1(b).

A. 

FILING FEE PAID   

If a pro se plaintiff pays the filing fee at the time the complaint is filed, the clerk’s office 

 
will sign and seal the summons(es) against the defendant(s) and return the summons(es) to 
the plaintiff, who must serve a summons on each defendant to the action. The only exception 
to this rule is if you are incarcerated AND are suing a government official. In that case, you 
should wait for the judge to complete a preliminary review, after which you will receive an 
order from the court and should follow the instructions in the order regarding service.     

All other pro se plaintiffs who have paid the filing fee must serve the summons and 
complaint on the defendant(s) within 90 days from the date of filing of the complaint, or as 
otherwise ordered, or the case will be subject to dismissal. You must comply with Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 4 or the case can be dismissed for failure to effect proper 
service.   

Summons forms are available at the clerk’s office and on the court’s website. See 

Appendix F, Sample Summons Form. If you are not incarcerated and you have paid the filing 
fee, you may immediately serve the complaint on the defendants.   

Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires you to file proof with the court 

that the complaint has been served on the defendant(s). On the back of the summons is a 
section referred to as the return of service which must be completed by the person who 
served the summons. The person serving the summons must leave a copy of both the 
summons form and the complaint with the defendant(s). The return of service must 
specifically identify the person who served the summons, the name(s) of the person(s) 
served, and the date(s) and time of service. You must then file the original summons form 
with the completed return of service with the court. 

PRO SE PLAINTIFFS PROCEEDING WITHOUT PREPAYMENT 

B. 
OF FEES OR COSTS   

If you are proceeding without prepayment of fees or costs, the court will arrange for 
service on the defendants. After conducting the preliminary review of a complaint, if the 
judge finds that the complaint states a claim upon which relief may be granted, the clerk’s

office will be ordered by the judge to issue summons(es) form(s) against the defendant(s). 
The judge will then, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(c)(2), appoint a person to 
make service - usually the Clerk of Court or the United States Marshals Office - who shall be 
responsible for doing so. In appropriate cases, a judge may order an alternative means of 
achieving service in accordance with all applicable laws and rules. 

C. 

SECTION 2254 PETITIONS AND § 2255 MOTIONS 

  After the filing of a petition or motion submitted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254 or 28 
U.S.C. § 2255, the magistrate judge or a district judge will review the pleading to determine 
whether it sufficiently states a claim entitling the petitioner to relief. If the judge finds that it 
does, an order will issue directing that the motion or petition be served upon and answered by 
the respondent(s). 

 

-15- 

 

   

   

A defendant’s answer must state any defenses to the complaint and either admit or 

deny the specific facts contained in the complaint. A defendant may choose to file a 
motion to dismiss the complaint instead of filing an answer. If a defendant fails to answer 
or otherwise defend the complaint in a timely fashion, the clerk may enter a default, 
which means that the plaintiff has prevailed on the claims made in the complaint. 

2.  Answer Deadlines 

If service is made on the defendant(s) by summons, the defendant(s) will have 

twenty-one (21) days from the date of service of the complaint to file an answer with the 
court. If the United States or a federal official is a defendant, the answer deadline is sixty 
(60) days from the date of service.   

When the magistrate judge has ordered service of a complaint after conducting a 
preliminary review pursuant to Local Rule 4.3(d)(1)(B) or 4.3(d)(2), or the magistrate or 
district judge has ordered an answer to a petition or motion filed pursuant to Rule 4 of the 
Rules Governing § 2254 Cases or Rule 4 of the Rules Governing § 2255 Cases, the order 
shall set an answer deadline. 

s noted in Section II (A) above, a plaintiff may file a civil case in federal court when 

the claim is based on a violation of the United States Constitution or federal statute, 
which is known as federal question jurisdiction, or if the claim is against a resident of a 
different state and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, which is known as 
diversity jurisdiction. If the plaintiff’s right to file in federal court is based on diversity 
jurisdiction, you must file a Diversity Disclosure Statement. See Local Rule 7.1.1. A

IV. PROCEEDINGS AFTER SERVICE 

  This section will explain: 

  What happens after the defendant is served and proof of service is filed 
  How to ask the court to take a certain action in your case 
  How to ask the court for permission to add to or change your complaint 
  How to object to another party’s request 
  What happens during discovery 
  How you and the court will prepare for trial   

A.  ANSWER   

1.  Generally 

 

 

 

 

   

A motion is a type of pleading, filed by any party to a lawsuit, which requests that the 

court take certain action. Motions are the primary way to ask the court to take some 
action in a case. 

A motion should be made in writing, state the specific reasons for the request made, 

and state what relief or order is being sought. All motions must contain the word 
“motion” in the title. You may not combine multiple motions seeking separate and 
distinct relief into a single motion. Separate motions must be filed.   

 motion must also contain a statement either incorporating an attached 

memorandum of law or a statement explaining why a memorandum is not necessary. If 
you are arguing a legal matter, you should include citations to supporting authorities, 
such as rules, statutes (laws), or case law that supports your position. A memorandum 
filed in support of a nondispositive motion must be less than fifteen (15) pages. A 
memorandum filed in support of a dispositive motion must be less than twenty-five (25) 
pages.   

Appendix H-1 is a sample motion format that incorporates all the necessary elements 
of a motion. This format should be used to avoid possible striking (nonconsideration) of a 
motion because it fails to satisfy the filing requirements. Appendix H-2 is a Motion Form. 
A fillable PDF version of the Motion Form is also available on the court’s website.   

ll motions filed in paper must be signed by the party submitting the motion and 

must contain a certificate of service indicating the date and manner in which the motion 
was served on the defendant(s). See Appendix C, Filing Requirements. Service of 
motions is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.     

he district judge or magistrate judge deciding the motion will ordinarily issue a 
written order without scheduling a hearing on the motion. Hearings are scheduled at the 
discretion of the court. 

Motions will be decided by the judge assigned to the case. Some motions, however, 

may be referred by a district judge to a magistrate judge for consideration. When a 
dispositive motion is referred to a magistrate judge for consideration, the magistrate 
judge will issue a report and recommendation that the motion be either granted or denied 
and stating the reasons for the recommendation. The report and recommendation is

forwarded to the district judge assigned to the case and copies are sent to the parties. As a 
party, you have fourteen (14) days to file any objections you have to the report and 
recommendation. All objections received within the specified time are forwarded to the 
district judge. The district judge reviews the report and recommendation and any 
objections that have been filed and will subsequently issue an order that adopts or rejects, 
in whole or in part, the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation.   

f the motion referred to a magistrate judge is nondispositive, the magistrate judge 
will issue an order granting or denying the motion, or directing other relief as appropriate. 
You may file an objection within fourteen (14) days of being served with a copy of the 
order on a non-dispositive matter. 

Motions can delay resolution of your case and divert the party and the court’s 

attention from preparing for trial. For this reason, motions should not be made frivolously 
or without reason, otherwise, the court may order sanctions against you. Also please note 
that, if you are represented by an attorney, you may not file pleadings in your case unless 
the court grants a motion allowing you to file a pro se pleading, you are filing a motion 
related to the status of your counsel, or an attorney has been granted leave to provide you 
with limited representation and the filing is outside the scope of the limited 
representation. See Local Rule 4.3(e). 

  I

 

2.  Motion to Amend 

 
If you would like to add to or change your complaint, you must file a motion to 
amend the complaint. A motion to amend shall: (1) identify any new facts, claims, or 
parties, (2) explain why any new facts, claims, or parties were not included in the original 
filing, and (3) include as an attachment your proposed amended complaint. The motion to 
amend must include a complete amended complaint as it is impermissible to incorporate 
your original complaint by reference, except with the permission of the court. See 
Appendix C, Filing Requirements. 

3.  Motion to Dismiss 

A motion to dismiss may be filed for any of the reasons set forth in Federal Rule of 

Civil Procedure 12(b). The motion to dismiss must state the specific facts and legal 
arguments supporting the stated reasons for dismissal. Such reasons commonly include 
the following: the court lacks jurisdiction to decide the subject matter of the case, service 
of process was not sufficient, or the complaint failed to state a claim that the law 
recognizes as enforceable. 

-18- 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

4.  Motion for Summary Judgment 

A motion for summary judgment is filed by a party pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil 

Procedure 56 when there are undisputed facts supporting part or all of the case. The 
moving party must state the legal reasons they are entitled to succeed on some or all of 
the issues in the case and state the reasons why they should succeed. If the court finds 
that there is no genuine disagreement over the facts important to one or more of the issues 
in the case, those issues may be disposed of by the court’s ruling on the motion. 

  A memorandum must be filed with a summary judgment motion that contains a short 
and concise statement of material (important) facts and appropriate case law citations. 
See Local Rule 56.1(a). The material facts you rely on must be supported by evidence, 
such as affidavits, depositions, answers to discovery requests, or other documents as 
stated in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. All properly supported material facts in the 
motion for summary judgment may be deemed admitted by the adverse party unless that 
adverse party files an objection, denies the facts in the motion for summary judgment and 
submits evidence (such as affidavits, depositions, answers to discovery requests, or other 
documents) that contradicts those facts. See Local Rule 56.1(b); See also Appendix A, 
Glossary of Terms, “Affidavit.” 
 

In opposing a motion for summary judgment, it usually is not enough for the 

objecting party to merely deny the facts in the other party’s motion. The responding party 
must present to the court evidence, such as affidavits, depositions, answers to 
interrogatories, or documents, which show that the facts are in dispute.     

 

5.  Motion to Extend 

A motion to extend any deadline shall state whether the extension would result in the 

continuance of any hearing, conference, or trial, and the motion shall state the proposed 
extended date. A motion to extend deadlines set in the discovery plan shall include a 
completed Civil Form 3 of the Local Rules. See LR 7.2(a); see also Appendix C, Filing 
Requirements.   

6.   Motion for Expedited Ruling 

On rare occasions a true emergency exists such that a party may need the court to take 
immediate action on a motion. When this occurs, the party filing the motion must note in 
the title of the caption that they are requesting expedited relief and they must explain 
within the motion why expedited relief is needed. See LR 7.1(f). 

-19- 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

7.  Motion for Reconsideration 

A motion to reconsider an order of the court (other than a motion governed by 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59 or 60) must be filed within fourteen (14) days from 
the date of the order in question. 

8.  Response Time 

To determine the date that a response to a motion is due, refer to Appendix B, Time 

Computation Chart. See LR 7.2(d). 

9.  Appeal of an Order Entered by the Court While Case is Pending 

Although most orders issued while a case is still ongoing cannot be appealed 
immediately, there are some exceptions to this general rule. The Federal Rules of 
Appellate Procedure explain when an order is appealable and you should consult those 
rules before filing a notice of appeal. If you file a notice of appeal, you will be required to 
pay a $505 filing fee with this court unless you are permitted to proceed without 
prepayment of fees or costs. If you are permitted to proceed without prepayment of fees 
or costs on appeal, you may still be required to pay certain costs associated with your 
appeal. Filing a notice of appeal prematurely may delay final resolution of your case and 
may add unnecessary expense to your case. For more information regarding appeals, see 
section VII, C of this Guide. 

C.  OBJECTIONS 

 

 

 

Objections to motions, like the motions themselves, must meet certain requirements. To 

assist you in the preparation of objections, Appendix I is a sample objection format that 
incorporates all the necessary elements of an objection. This format should be used when 
preparing objections. See also Appendix C, Filing Requirements. 

Like a motion, each objection must have an attached memorandum of law with citations 
to supporting authorities or must contain a statement explaining why a memorandum is not 
necessary. A memorandum filed in opposition to a nondispositive motion shall not exceed 
fifteen (15) pages. A memorandum filed in opposition to a dispositive motion shall not 
exceed twenty-five (25) pages. See Appendix C, Filing Requirements. 

-20- 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

D.  REPLIES 

A reply memorandum is permitted in response to an objection to a dispositive motion, but 

not in response to an objection to a nondispositive motion without prior permission of the 
court. No surreply (i.e. a reply to a reply) memorandum is permitted without prior permission 
of the court. A reply memorandum on a dispositive motion shall not exceed ten (10) pages, 
while a reply memorandum on a non-dispositive motion and a surreply memorandum may 
not exceed five (5) pages. 

E.  REDACTION OF PERSONAL IDENTIFIERS 

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2 and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 49.1 require 

that all parties refrain from including, or shall partially redact where inclusion is necessary, 
the following personal identifiers from all filings with the court: social security numbers; 
names of minor children; dates of birth; financial account numbers; and address information 
in criminal cases. 

F. 

DISCOVERY PLAN AND PRELIMINARY PRETRIAL 

After the defendant has either answered the complaint or filed a dispositive motion, in 
most cases the court will schedule a preliminary pretrial conference. Pursuant to Federal Rule 
of Civil Procedure 26, at least twenty-one (21) days before the preliminary pretrial 
conference the parties must confer and develop a proposed discovery plan. Within fourteen 
(14) days thereafter, the discovery plan must be filed with the court. Habeas corpus 
petitioners and incarcerated pro se parties are exempt from this requirement. Fed. R. Civ. P. 
26(a)(1)(B). For more specific information regarding the contents of the discovery plan, see 
Civil Form 2 of the Local Rules. If the discovery plan is approved, the preliminary pretrial 
may be cancelled and the parties notified. 

At the preliminary pretrial hearing, all parties should be prepared to discuss discovery 
issues such as expected interrogatories, requests for admission, depositions, use of experts, 
mediation and/or Alternative Dispute Resolution, a trial date, and other case-related issues as 
fully explained in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(c). The district judge or magistrate 
judge will thereafter approve a discovery plan setting forth deadlines. The parties must 
adhere to those deadlines unless otherwise ordered by the court. 

A trial date will be set within the discovery plan and a separate trial notice will be sent 

out. The notice will include the deadline for filing final pretrial statements as well as the 
dates for the final pretrial conference and trial. 

-21- 

 

 

 

   

G.  DISCOVERY 

1.  Generally 

Discovery is the process of collecting the evidence necessary to support a claim. 
Evidence may be gathered from the opposing party, from non-parties or from public 
records. The parties shall not file discovery materials with the court unless ordered to do 
so or as appropriate in support of a motion for summary judgment or an objection to a 
motion for summary judgment. Motions to the court regarding discovery disputes are 
governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37 and Local Rule 37.1. 

2.  Initial Disclosures 

For nonincarcerated/non-habeas plaintiffs, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a) 

requires the disclosure of certain materials to the adverse party without a discovery 
request or separate court order. The specific materials and information to be disclosed, as 
well as the deadlines for disclosure, are contained in the rule and should be carefully 
reviewed. Failure to comply with discovery rules and orders in a case may result in the 
dismissal of an action and/or other sanctions. 

3.  Depositions 

A deposition is a procedure in which testimony of any witness, whether or not a 
party, is taken under oath and recorded before the trial begins. The witness, called the 
deponent, is examined by the party who asked for the deposition, and then the adverse 
party may cross-examine. The rules and procedures governing depositions are located at 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 27 through 32. 

 

 

4.  Interrogatories   
 
  Up to twenty-five (25) written questions, called interrogatories, may be used to 
discover information from parties in the action. Permission from the court can be sought 
to request additional interrogatories. Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and 
fully, in writing, and under oath. If an interrogatory is objected to, the objecting party 
shall state the reasons for the objection and shall answer to the extent the interrogatory is 
not objectionable. The answers are to be signed by the person making them and the 
objections signed by the attorney or pro se party making them. The interrogatories shall 
be answered within thirty (30) days after they are served. Parties are required to 
supplement their answers to interrogatories as additional information becomes available 

-22- 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 34, a written request to produce records, 

letters, contracts, or other materials, inspect or copy a document, or permit entry upon 
designated land or other property in the possession or control of the party upon whom the 
request is served, may be served on any party. The request shall specify a reasonable 
time, place, and manner of making the inspection or performing the related acts. The 
party upon whom the request is served shall serve a written response within thirty (30) 
days. The response shall state whether the inspection or related activities will be 
permitted as requested. If the request is objected to, the reasons for the objection shall be 
stated. The requesting party may seek, by filing a motion to compel, a court order 
requiring production. A person not a party to the action may be compelled to produce 
documents or things as provided in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45. 

as provided by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(e)(1). The rules and procedures 
governing interrogatories are contained in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 33.

6.  Physical or Mental Examinations 

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 35, when the mental or physical 

condition of a party or of a person in the custody or under the legal control of a party is in 
controversy, the court in which the action is pending may order the party to submit to a 
physical or mental examination. The order may be made only on motion for good cause 
shown and upon notice to the person to be examined and to all parties and shall specify 
the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the examination and the person by 
whom it is to be made. A mental or physical examination may be conducted by any 
“suitably licensed or certified examiner.” Generally, the party seeking such a report will 
incur the cost for the examination.   

7.  Requests for Admission 

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 36, a party may serve upon any other 
party a written request to admit the truth of certain matters within the scope of Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(1). The matter is admitted unless, within thirty (30) days 
after service of the request, the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the 
requesting party a written answer or objection signed by the party. Failure to answer 
constitutes an admission. The party who requests the admission may file a motion with 
the court to determine the sufficiency of the answers or objections. The court may order 
an answer, amendments to answers given, or even that the matter be deemed admitted.

H. 

FINAL PRETRIAL STATEMENTS 

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(3) and Local Rule 16.2 outline the information that 
is to be included in, and filings to accompany, a final pretrial statement. This document must 
be filed thirty (30) days before trial. Objections to final pretrial statements are governed by 
Local Rule 16.2(d). 

I. 

FINAL PRETRIAL CONFERENCE 

The final pretrial conference will be held approximately ten (10) days prior to trial. This 

conference, held with the trial judge and the parties, will provide an opportunity to discuss 
the following: issues that will be tried, admissibility of exhibits, pending motions, issues 
concerning jury selection, witnesses, possibility of settlement, length of trial, and any other 
relevant issues. The court may enter a final pretrial order outlining issues discussed. 

J. 

TRIAL WITNESSES 

No later than twenty-one (21) days before trial, parties authorized to without prepaying 

fees or costs must file a motion containing the name, address, and a brief statement of the 
expected testimony of each witness they would like to subpoena for trial. If the stated 
testimony of a witness is not material or is repetitive, the court may decline to order the 
issuance of a subpoena for that witness. The court will prepare an order specifying what 
subpoenas may be issued. Parties proceeding without prepayment should see Local Rule 
45.2. 

K.  TRIAL EXHIBITS/EXHIBIT LIST AND FINAL WITNESS LIST 

Trial exhibits, an exhibit list, and a final witness list are to be filed in the clerk's office 
seven (7) days before trial begins. See LR 83.14. Detailed instructions for the marking of 
exhibits are available from the clerk's office or on the court’s website. 

L. 

JUROR QUESTIONNAIRES 

The clerk's office will maintain and make available a complete listing of jurors who will 

be in attendance the day of jury selection as well as a questionnaire for each juror. The 
questionnaire is a document provided by the clerk's office, and completed by each juror, that 
asks for certain personal information. Five (5) working days prior to the first jury selection 
date of each trial period, the list and questionnaires will be made available only to attorneys, 
their agents, and pro se parties actually involved in cases scheduled for trial during that 
period. The questionnaires may not be photocopied or removed from the clerk's office and 
the information in the questionnaires may not be disclosed. Absent leave of the court, after

destroyed as required by Local Rule 47.1.

V.   TRIAL 

This section will explain: 

  How a jury is selected 
  How you present your evidence 
  How a decision is reached 

A trial is the examination of evidence and applicable law by a judge or a jury who then 

decide what facts to accept, apply the law to those facts, and determine the result in the case. At a 
trial, the plaintiff attempts to prove the claims in support of the relief requested, and the opposing 
party attempts to prove the opposite. Each party will have the opportunity to present their side of 
the case. At the conclusion of the evidence, if the case was tried before a jury, the jury will 
render its verdict. If there was no jury and a bench trial was held, the judge will render a 
decision. Often, a decision rendered by a judge will be issued at a future date in the form of a 
written order. Of course, at any time before trial, if the matter is disposed of by motion, 
settlement, or otherwise, no trial will be necessary. Local Rule 39.1 sets forth guidelines for the 
length and limits of trial, conduct of counsel/pro se litigants in the courtroom, and many of the 
topics discussed below. 

A. 

JURY SELECTION 

A jury trial begins with the judge giving a brief outline of what the case is about, reading 
witness lists, introducing counsel and the parties, and conducting the voir dire (a preliminary 
examination concerning the eligibility of a prospective juror to serve on the jury). The 
courtroom clerk will then randomly select jurors. After each selection, the judge will ask the 
juror if there are any concerns with or responses to any of the questions asked. If so, the 
judge will question the juror individually at the bench in the presence of counsel and any pro 
se party. After the court has completed its examination, challenges to a prospective juror for 
cause may be made at the bench. A challenge for cause may be allowed if the prospective 
juror lacks a qualification required by law or cannot be fair and impartial in deciding the 
case. This process will continue until the appropriate number of jurors has been selected for 
the panel. 

The parties will then exercise their peremptory challenges (limited to three per side) at 
the clerk's bench out of the hearing of prospective jurors. Peremptory challenges are requests 
by a party that a certain prospective juror not sit on the panel and, unlike challenges for 
cause, no reason need be stated to support the challenge. Jurors who are the subject of a 
peremptory challenge shall be excused. The remaining jurors shall comprise the trial panel, 
will hear the evidence, and will render their verdict at the conclusion of the case. The court 
will seat a jury of not fewer than six persons and all jurors participate in the verdict. 

-26- 

 

   

 

 

   

.  VIEW AND PRE-VIEW STATEMENTS 

  A view to a location relevant to the case may be taken if the judge finds that such a view 
will be helpful to the judge or jury in understanding the evidence presented. If a party wants 
to have a view in the case, that party must specially request it in the final pretrial statement. 
The court will determine at the final pretrial conference whether a view will be allowed. If a 
view is permitted in a jury trial, each party will have the opportunity to make brief, 
nonargumentative statements to the jury to alert them to particular points of interest they may 
see at the view. 

C.  OPENING STATEMENTS 

The purpose of an opening statement is to describe the issues in the case and the facts a 

party intends to prove in support of the claims made or defenses raised. The plaintiff’s 
statement is presented first, because the plaintiff has the burden of proving the facts 
supporting the allegations and that the defendant was responsible for the injury or damage 
alleged. Opening statements shall be nonargumentative and no longer than thirty (30) 
minutes unless otherwise ordered. 

D. 

PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE 

The actual presentation of evidence occurs after the opening statements have been 

completed and consists of witness testimony and exhibits. 

1.  Witness Testimony 

Not all witness testimony is admissible in a trial. It is important that the pro se party 
be very familiar with those portions of the Federal Rules of Evidence which relate to the 
admissibility of witness testimony prior to attempting to introduce such evidence at trial. 

a.  Direct Examination 

b.  Cross-Examination 

When an attorney or pro se party calls a person to the witness stand and asks 
questions, it is called direct examination. The plaintiff is first in presenting witnesses. 

When the other side attempts to discredit the testimony given by a witness after 

the direct examination, it is called cross-examination. 

-27- 

 

  B

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

c.  Redirect Examination 

The initial examiner may elect to re-question the witness on the points covered by 

the cross-examination. This is called redirect examination. 

Exhibits properly presented to the court and admitted into evidence will be considered 

by the judge or jury deciding the case. Because the admission of exhibits is determined 
by the judge, it is important for a pro se party to comply with the Federal Rules of 
Evidence concerning the proper admission of exhibits. 

2.  Exhibits 

3.  Objections 

 
In order to preserve an argument for appeal, you must give the judge an opportunity 
to consider your argument when the basis for it first arises. If you believe that testimony 
or evidence the other party is trying to admit should not be allowed based on the Federal 
Rules of Evidence, you must raise your objection to the testimony or evidence with the 
judge before the testimony is given or the evidence is introduced. If you do not do so, you 
may later be deemed to have waived your opportunity to challenge the admission of the 
testimony or evidence. 

E.  CLOSING ARGUMENTS 

The purpose of the closing argument is to allow each side to summarize the evidence 
presented, to explain how the evidence is relevant to the issues in the case, and to tell the jury 
for whom they should return a verdict based on all the evidence they have heard at trial. The 
closing argument can reiterate crucial testimony that was presented and can highlight why 
the plaintiff's or defendant's version of the event should or should not be believed. In a 
closing argument, a party is not permitted to include personal opinions about the facts or the 
evidence and must be certain not to inadvertently do so. The parties must make their 
arguments based on facts actually presented in evidence during the trial and reasonable 
conclusions that can be drawn from those facts. The defendant shall deliver the first closing 
argument. The plaintiff argues last. 

-28- 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

CHARGE TO THE JURY, DELIBERATIONS, AND VERDICT 

After each side has had the opportunity to present testimony and evidence, the judge 
delivers legal instructions, or a charge, to the jury. The charge explains the law that the jury 
should apply to decide the case. The parties will have an opportunity to discuss the jury 
instructions with the judge prior to the charge. After the charge is delivered, the jury will then 
go to a secure room to conduct its deliberations. Once the jury has reached a verdict, the 
court will be notified. If a jury is unable to reach a verdict, the judge will declare a mistrial 
and the case must then be tried again before a new jury.

F. 

   

   

The party that ultimately wins a lawsuit may be awarded certain costs of litigation. These 

 
costs are assessed by the court and must be paid by the losing party. If the plaintiff wins the 
case, a Bill of Costs may be filed against the defendant(s). If the plaintiff loses, however, the 
defendant(s) may file a Bill of Costs against the plaintiff. These costs, which are explained 
more fully at 28 U.S.C. § 1920, include expenses such as deposition costs, money for 
printing, witness fees, and costs incurred for summonses and subpoenas. Even if the plaintiff 
was granted leave to file without prepayment of fees or costs, the plaintiff may have to pay 
for the defendant’s costs if the defendant prevails. 

If you win your case, a Bill of Costs form (available in the clerk’s office and on the 
court’s webpage) must be filed with the clerk within twenty-one (21) days after the time for 
appeal has expired. A copy must be served on the opposing attorney or pro se party. The Bill 
of Costs must be supported by a memorandum of law and must be verified by oath stating 
that the items are correct, the costs claimed are allowable by law, the services have been 
actually and necessarily performed, and the disbursements have been necessarily incurred in 
the action or proceeding. An itemization of all costs shall be attached to the Bill of Costs.   

f you lose your case, and the other party files a Bill of Costs, your objection to the Bill 

of Costs is due within fourteen (14) days after service. The Clerk of Court will review 
these submissions and will issue a taxation of costs. The Clerk’s taxation shall be final unless 
modified on review by a judge on a motion filed within seven (7) days after it is issued. The 
rules and procedures related to Bills of Costs are more fully set forth at 28 U.S.C. § 1920, 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54, and Local Rule 54.1.

Once all issues in the case have been disposed of, a document entitled “Judgment” shall 

be entered by the clerk’s office and the case will be closed.

A. 

JUDGMENT

If you intend to appeal the decision or verdict of the judge or jury, you should closely 
review the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. These rules are available for review at the 
clerk’s office, at most public libraries, at the libraries of most state and federal correctional 
institutions located in New Hampshire, and online on the website for the United States Court 
of Appeals for the First Circuit at www.ca1.uscourts.gov.   

If a party believes a jury verdict or decision rendered by the court was incorrect, the 
appeal from this court usually lies with the United States Court of Appeals for the First 
Circuit in Boston, Massachusetts. An appeal of a decision is initiated by filing a Notice of 
Appeal in the district court either on a Notice of Appeal form or in a filing with a 
substantially similar format. See Appendix J, Sample Notice of Appeal. A Notice of Appeal 
should contain a description of the party or parties taking the appeal, a description of the 
judgment or order or the part of the order or judgment appealed from, and the name of the 
court to which the appeal is taken. If more than one party wishes to appeal the decision or 
verdict, each party must file a separate notice of appeal. You need to designate the judgment 
and/or appealable order(s) that you want the appellate court to review. If you expressly state 
that you are only appealing part of a judgment or a specific order, then your appeal will be 
limited to that part of the judgment or specific order. 

The fee for filing a Notice of Appeal is $505.00 unless the person taking the appeal has 
been granted leave to proceed without prepayment of fees or costs. Unless the district court 
certifies that the appeal was not taken in good faith, a non-incarcerated party who has 
previously been granted leave to proceed without prepayment in the case need not file a new 
application to proceed without prepayment of fees or costs on appeal. Fed. R. App. P. 
24(a)(3). However, an incarcerated party seeking to appeal in forma pauperis must file a new 
motion requesting permission to do so regardless of whether the litigant was previously 
granted leave to proceed without prepayment by the district court. 28 U.S.C. § 1915(b)(1); 
Fed. R. App. P. 24(a)(3)(B).   

Unless the United States or an officer or agency of the United States is a party to the 
action, the Notice of Appeal in a civil case must be filed within thirty (30) days from the 
date of entry of the judgment that is being appealed. If the United States or an officer or 
agency of the United States is a party to the action, the Notice of Appeal must be filed within 
sixty (60) days from the date of entry of the judgment. The “date of entry” is the day the 
judgment was entered onto the district court’s docket. The date an order or opinion is signed 
is not necessarily the same day that it will be reduced to a judgment or entered onto the 
court’s docket. The parties should consult Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58 to determine 
the date judgment is deemed to be entered in their case. 

The appellate court will only consider issues the district court has considered, so it is 
important to make your argument on an issue to the district court prior to appealing the issue.

C.  APPEAL 

Upon receipt of the Notice of Appeal, the appellate court will notify the parties of any orders 
issued or schedules set in the case.

Instructions for Filing a Complaint by a Prisoner 
Under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 

 
APPENDIX E-2, USDC-11, INSTRUCTIONS & COMPLAINT FORM FOR A 
PERSON IN CUSTODY 

You may file an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to challenge federal constitutional or 

statutory violations by state actors. Lawsuits challenging the conditions of your confinement are 
generally filed under this statute. A § 1983 action may not be used to challenge the length of 
your sentence or the validity of your conviction. 

42 U.S.C. § 1983 

 
Filing a § 1983 Action 

To file a § 1983 action, you must submit: (1) an original complaint and (2) a fee of 
$402.00 ($350.00 filing fee and $52.00 administrative fee) (by money order or cashier’s check 
made payable to “Clerk, U.S. District Court”) or an original Application to Proceed Without 
Prepayment of Fees or Costs (AO239). 
 

This packet includes a complaint form and an Application to Proceed Without 

Prepayment of Fees or Costs. When these forms are fully completed, mail the originals to: Office 
of the Clerk of Court, United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, Warren B. 
Rudman United States Courthouse, 55 Pleasant Street, Room 110, Concord, NH 03301-3941. If 
granted, the $52.00 administrative fee is waived. 

The fee for each Plaintiff in a § 1983 action is $402.00 ($350.00 filing fee and $52.00 

administrative fee), to be paid at the time of filing. If you are unable to pay the full filing fee at 
this time, you may apply to proceed without prepayment of fees or costs, using the Application 
in this packet. If you are granted leave to proceed without prepayment, the $52.00 administrative 
fee is waived, but you must still pay the statutory filing fee of $350.00 in several installments. 28 
U.S.C. § 1915. You must fully complete the application and sign and declare under penalty of 
perjury that the facts stated therein are true and correct. 
 

If the complaint contains more than one inmate plaintiff, each plaintiff must submit a 

separate Application or filing fee. Inmate plaintiffs must use the Application provided with this 
packet and not any other version.

V.  Complaint Form 

The Complaint must be typewritten or legibly handwritten and you must sign and declare 
under penalty of perjury that the facts stated in the complaint are true and correct. Each plaintiff 
must sign the complaint. 

Pro Se Litigation - Individual and Class Action Lawsuits 

As a pro se party, you are representing only yourself and presenting only your claims and 

defenses. Under the law, you cannot speak for another person, or other entity. You may not 
represent a class of people in a class action lawsuit. See Local Rule 83.2(d) & 83.6(b). A pro se 
party may not authorize another person who is not a member of the bar of this court to appear on 
his or her behalf. Each pro se party must sign the complaint and all additional pleadings filed 
with the court on his or her behalf. 
 

In order to assist pro se parties, the Court has compiled the Pro Se Guide, which should 

be available in the libraries of all New Hampshire correctional facilities. If your facility does not 
have a copy, the Court will mail you a copy upon request. 

I. 

Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies 

Under 42 U.S.C. § 1997e, you are required to exhaust your administrative remedies 

before filing a § 1983 action regarding conditions of confinement and other issues relating to 
prison life. Failure to completely exhaust administrative prison grievance procedures prior to 
filing your complaint will result in the dismissal of your suit in its entirety. 

II.  Change of Address After Complaint is Filed 

You will be notified as soon as the court issues any order in your case. It is your 
responsibility to keep the court informed of any changes of address to ensure you receive court 
orders. Failure to so do may result in dismissal of your action. 

III.  Copying Requests 

Please note that the Office of the Clerk of Court charges fifty cents (.50) per page for all 

copy requests. Thus, we recommend that you keep copies of all documents submitted to the court 
for your own records.

more than $75,000.  In that kind of case, called a diversity of citizenship case, no defendant may be a citizen of 
the same State as any plaintiff.  Explain how these jurisdictional requirements have been met.

Basis for Jurisdiction

Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction (limited power).  Generally, only two types of cases can be 
heard in federal court: cases involving a federal question and cases involving diversity of citizenship of the 
parties.  Under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, a case arising under the United States Constitution or federal laws or treaties 
is a federal question case.  Under 28 U.S.C. § 1332, a case in which a citizen of one State sues a citizen of 
another State or nation and the amount at stake is more than $75,000 is a diversity of citizenship case.  In a 
diversity of citizenship case, no defendant may be a citizen of the same State as any plaintiff.

Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, you may sue state or local officials for the “deprivation of any rights, privileges, or 
immunities secured by the Constitution and [federal laws].”  Under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of 
Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), you may sue federal officials for the violation of certain 
constitutional rights.

A.

Are you bringing suit against (check all that apply):

’ Federal officials (a Bivens claim)

’ State or local officials (a § 1983 claim)

Section 1983 allows claims alleging the “deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by 
the Constitution and [federal laws].”  42 U.S.C. § 1983.  If you are suing under section 1983, what 
federal constitutional or statutory right(s) do you claim is/are being violated by state or local officials?

B.

C.

Plaintiffs suing under Bivens may only recover for the violation of certain constitutional rights.  If you

Basis for Jurisdiction

Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, you may sue state or local officials for the “deprivation of any rights, privileges, or
immunities secured by the Constitution and [federal laws].”  Under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of
Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), you may sue federal officials for the violation of certain
constitutional rights.

A.

Are you bringing suit against (check all that apply):

’ Federal officials (a Bivens claim)

’ State or local officials (a § 1983 claim)

Section 1983 allows claims alleging the “deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by 
the Constitution and [federal laws].”  42 U.S.C. § 1983.  If you are suing under section 1983, what 
federal constitutional or statutory right(s) do you claim is/are being violated by state or local officials?

B.

C.

Plaintiffs suing under Bivens may only recover for the violation of certain constitutional rights.  If you 
are suing under Bivens, what constitutional right(s) do you claim is/are being violated by federal 
officials?

Page 3 of  11

Pro Se 14 (Rev. 12/16) Complaint for Violation of Civil Rights (Prisoner)

D.

Section 1983 allows defendants to be found liable only when they have acted “under color of any 
statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia.”  
42 U.S.C. § 1983.  If you are suing under section 1983, explain how each defendant acted under color 
of state or local law.  If you are suing under Bivens, explain how each defendant acted under color of 
federal law.  Attach additional pages if needed.

Indicate whether you are a prisoner or other confined person as follows (check all that apply):

VIII. Previous Lawsuits

The “three strikes rule” bars a prisoner from bringing a civil action or an appeal in federal court without paying
the filing fee if that prisoner has “on three or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility,
brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous,
malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under imminent
danger of serious physical injury.”  28 U.S.C. § 1915(g).

To the best of your knowledge, have you had a case dismissed based on this “three strikes rule”?

’ Yes

’ No

If yes, state which court dismissed your case, when this occurred, and attach a copy of the order if possible.

Basis for Jurisdiction

Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction (limited power).  Generally, only two types of cases can be
heard in federal court: cases involving a federal question and cases involving diversity of citizenship of the
parties.  Under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, a case arising under the United States Constitution or federal laws or treaties
is a federal question case.  Under 28 U.S.C. § 1332, a case in which a citizen of one State sues a citizen of
another State or nation and the amount at stake is more than $75,000 is a diversity of citizenship case.  In a
diversity of citizenship case, no defendant may be a citizen of the same State as any plaintiff.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ATTORNEYS COMPLETING CIVIL COVER SHEET FORM JS 44

Authority For Civil Cover Sheet

The JS 44 civil cover sheet and the information contained herein neither replaces nor supplements the filings and service of pleading or other papers as
required by law, except as provided by local rules of court.  This form, approved by the Judicial Conference of the United States in September 1974, is
required for the use of the Clerk of Court for the purpose of initiating the civil docket sheet.  Consequently, a civil cover sheet is submitted to the Clerk of
Court for each civil complaint filed.  The attorney filing a case should complete the form as follows:

I.(a)  Plaintiffs-Defendants.  Enter names (last, first, middle initial) of plaintiff and defendant.  If the plaintiff or defendant is a government agency, use 

only the full name or standard abbreviations.  If the plaintiff or defendant is an official within a government agency, identify first the agency and 
then the official, giving both name and title.

(b) County of Residence.  For each civil case filed, except U.S. plaintiff cases, enter the name of the county where the first listed plaintiff resides at the

time of filing.  In U.S. plaintiff cases, enter the name of the county in which the first listed defendant resides at the time of filing.  (NOTE: In land
condemnation cases, the county of residence of the ""defendant"" is the location of the tract of land involved.)

(c) Attorneys.  Enter the firm name, address, telephone number, and attorney of record.  If there are several attorneys, list them on an attachment, noting

in this section ""(see attachment)"".

II.

III.

IV.

V.

Jurisdiction.  The basis of jurisdiction is set forth under Rule 8(a), F.R.Cv.P., which requires that jurisdictions be shown in pleadings.  Place an ""X"" 
in one of the boxes.  If there is more than one basis of jurisdiction, precedence is given in the order shown below.
United States plaintiff.  (1) Jurisdiction based on 28 U.S.C. 1345 and 1348.  Suits by agencies and officers of the United States are included here. 
United States defendant.  (2) When the plaintiff is suing the United States, its officers or agencies, place an ""X"" in this box.
Federal question.  (3) This refers to suits under 28 U.S.C. 1331, where jurisdiction arises under the Constitution of the United States, an amendment 
to the Constitution, an act of Congress or a treaty of the United States.  In cases where the U.S. is a party, the U.S. plaintiff or defendant code takes 
precedence, and box 1 or 2 should be marked.
Diversity of citizenship.  (4) This refers to suits under 28 U.S.C. 1332, where parties are citizens of different states.  When Box 4 is checked, the 
citizenship of the different parties must be checked.  (See Section III below; NOTE: federal question actions take precedence over diversity 
cases.)

Residence (citizenship) of Principal Parties.  This section of the JS 44 is to be completed if diversity of citizenship was indicated above.  Mark this 
section for each principal party.

Nature of Suit.  Place an ""X"" in the appropriate box.  If there are multiple nature of suit codes associated with the case, pick the nature of suit code 
that is most applicable.  Click here for: Nature of Suit Code Descriptions.

Origin.  Place an ""X"" in one of the seven boxes.
Original Proceedings.  (1) Cases which originate in the United States district courts.
Removed from State Court.  (2) Proceedings initiated in state courts may be removed to the district courts under Title 28 U.S.C., Section 1441. 
Remanded from Appellate Court.  (3) Check this box for cases remanded to the district court for further action.  Use the date of remand as the filing 
date.
Reinstated or Reopened.  (4) Check this box for cases reinstated or reopened in the district court.  Use the reopening date as the filing date. 
Transferred from Another District.  (5) For cases transferred under Title 28 U.S.C. Section 1404(a).  Do not use this for within district transfers or 
multidistrict litigation transfers.
Multidistrict Litigation – Transfer.  (6) Check this box when a multidistrict case is transferred into the district under authority of Title 28 U.S.C. 
Section 1407.
Multidistrict Litigation – Direct File.  (8) Check this box when a multidistrict case is filed in the same district as the Master MDL docket. PLEASE 
NOTE THAT THERE IS NOT AN ORIGIN CODE 7.  Origin Code 7 was used for historical records and is no longer relevant due to changes in 
statue.

VI.

Cause of Action.  Report the civil statute directly related to the cause of action and give a brief description of the cause.  Do not cite jurisdictional 
statutes unless diversity.  Example: U.S. Civil Statute: 47 USC 553  Brief Description: Unauthorized reception of cable service

VII. Requested in Complaint.  Class Action.  Place an ""X"" in this box if you are filing a class action under Rule 23, F.R.Cv.P.

Demand.  In this space enter the actual dollar amount being demanded or indicate other demand, such as a preliminary injunction.
Jury Demand.  Check the appropriate box to indicate whether or not a jury is being demanded.

VIII. Related Cases.  This section of the JS 44 is used to reference related pending cases, if any.  If there are related pending cases, insert the docket 

numbers and the corresponding judge names for such cases.

Instructions for Filing a Complaint by a Prisoner
Under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983

I.

42 U.S.C. § 1983

You may file an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to challenge federal constitutional or statutory
violations by state actors.  Lawsuits challenging the conditions of your confinement are generally filed
under this statute.  A § 1983 action may not be used to challenge the length of your sentence or the valid-
ity of your conviction.

II.

Filing a § 1983 Action

To file a § 1983 action, you must submit: (1) an original complaint and (2) a fee of $400.00

($350.00 filing fee and $50.00 administrative fee) (by money order or cashier’s check made payable to
“Clerk, U.S. District Court”) or an original Prisoner's In Forma Pauperis Application.

This packet includes a complaint form and a Prisoner's In Forma Pauperis Application.  When

these forms are fully completed, mail the originals to: Office of the Clerk of Court, United States District
Court for the District of New Hampshire, Warren B. Rudman United States Courthouse, 55 Pleasant
Street, Room 110, Concord, NH  03301-3941.  If granted, the $50.00 administrative fee is waived.

III.

Filing Fees

The fee for each Plaintiff in a § 1983 action is $400.00 ($350.00 filing fee and $50.00
administrative fee), to be paid at the time of filing.  If you are unable to pay the full filing fee at this
time, you may apply to proceed in forma pauperis, using the Prisoner's In Forma Pauperis Application
in this packet.  If you are granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis the $50.00 administrative fee is
waived, but you must still pay the statutory filing fee of $350.00 in several installments.  28 U.S.C. §
1915. You must fully complete the application and sign and declare under penalty of perjury that the
facts stated therein are true and correct.

If the complaint contains more than one inmate plaintiff, each plaintiff must submit a separate 

Prisoner's In Forma Pauperis Application or filing fee.  Inmate plaintiffs must use the Prisoner's In
Forma Pauperis Application provided with this packet and not any other version.

IV.

Complaint Form

The Complaint must be typewritten or legibly handwritten and you must sign and declare under
penalty of perjury that the facts stated in the complaint are true and correct.  Each plaintiff must sign the
complaint.

V.

Pro Se Litigation - Individual and Class Action Lawsuits

As a pro se litigant, you are representing only yourself and presenting only your claims and
defenses.  Under the law, you cannot speak for another person, or other entity.  You may not represent a
class of people in a class action lawsuit.  See Local Rule 83.2(d) & 83.6(b).  A pro se litigant may not
authorize another person who is not a member of the bar of this court to appear on his or her behalf. 
Each pro se litigant must sign the complaint and all additional pleadings filed with the court on his or
her behalf.

In order to assist pro se litigants, the Court has compiled the Pro Se Litigant Guide, which should
be available in the libraries of all New Hampshire correctional facilities.  If your facility does not have a
copy, the Court will mail you a copy upon request.

VI.

Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

Under 42 U.S.C. § 1997e, you are required to exhaust your administrative remedies before filing

a § 1983 action regarding conditions of confinement and other issues relating to prison life.  Failure to
exhaust administrative prison grievance procedures prior to filing your complaint may result in the
dismissal of any unexhausted claims.

VII.

Change of Address After Complaint is Filed

You will be notified as soon as the court issues any order in your case.  It is your responsibility to

keep the court informed of any changes of address to ensure you receive court orders.  Failure to so do
may result in dismissal of your action.

VIII. Copying Requests

Please note that the Office of the Clerk of Court charges fifty cents (.50¢) per page for all copy
requests.  Thus, we recommend that you keep copies of all documents submitted to the court for your
own records.

INTRODUCTION 

The information in this Handout is for individuals who are representing themselves 

in civil actions in the District of Maine without the assistance of an attorney. Parties who 

choose to represent themselves are often referred to as pro se parties or pro se litigants. 

Pro se means “for yourself.”    

Unlike  attorneys,  pro  se  litigants  may  only  represent  themselves  and  may  only 

present  their  own  claims  and  defenses.  Under  the  law,  you  may  not  speak  for  another 

person or entity such as a company or business. This means that you may not file a class 

action lawsuit. A pro se litigant also may not authorize another person who is not a licensed 

attorney to appear for them. This includes a spouse, relative, or another party. 

The Court encourages all self-represented litigants to consult this Handout together 

with  the  Federal  Rules  of  Practice  and  Procedure,  including  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil 

Procedure and  the Federal Rules of Evidence (both are also available in Title 28 of the 

United States Code), the District of Maine Local Rules, and additional resources available 

on the Court’s website, including the forms and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).1 

THE DISTRICT OF MAINE 

The United States District Court for the District of Maine has courtrooms and offices 

in the City of Bangor and the City of Portland. Cases are filed in either the Bangor Federal 

Courthouse  or  the  Portland  Federal  Courthouse  depending  on  the  county  in  which  the 

lawsuit arises. Cases arising out of Aroostook, Franklin, Hancock, Kennebec, Penobscot, 

Piscataquis, Somerset, Waldo and Washington counties are filed and ordinarily heard in 

Bangor.  Cases  arising  out  of  Androscoggin,  Cumberland,  Knox2,  Lincoln,  Oxford, 

Sagadahoc and York counties are filed and ordinarily heard in Portland. 

 

 The Federal Rules, Local Rules, the United States Code, statues, etc. are regularly updated. You are responsible for 
making sure that you are using the most recent version of each. 

 Cases brought by inmates at the Maine State Prison in Warren must be filed in Bangor and are automatically referred 
to the magistrate judge in Bangor.

THE CLERK’S OFFICE 

The  authority  and  responsibilities  of  the  Clerk’s  Office  is  outlined  in  Rules  77 

through 79 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Christa Berry is the Clerk of Court for 

the District of Maine. Eric Storms is the Chief Deputy. When you write or call the Clerk’s 

Office, you will speak with a case manager. Case managers are responsible for maintaining 

 

 

 

3 

 
 

   

 

 

 
 
the official court record. They process paperwork, schedule matters before the judge, and 

 

 

perform work in the courtroom. Each judge has an assigned case manager who assists them 

with their cases. All case-related inquiries should be directed to the case manager to 

whom your case is assigned. You are not permitted to telephone, email, or mail the 

judge’s chambers directly. 

Case  managers  and  other  Clerk’s  Office  staff  may  assist  you  with  some  of  your 

inquiries, but they are not authorized to provide you with legal advice. In general, legal 

advice is advice about what the law is; how to succeed in your case; how to interpret the 

Constitution, statutes, rules or other sources of law.  

In addition to being unable to provide litigants with legal advice, Clerk’s Office staff 

are not allowed to:  

•  Make recommendations or suggest ways to help you win your case.  

Clerk’s  Office  staff  may  provide  assistance  regarding  court  administration  and 

docket management. Clerk’s Office staff may: 

•  Answer general questions about how the Court works.  

•  Give general information about court rules, terminology, procedures 

and practices.  

•  Provide or refer you to available court forms.  

•  Provide general information from your case, such as informing you of 

certain deadlines or if a decision whether order has been issued.  

4 

   

 

•  Fill out or correct any forms for you. 

•  Predict how or when a judge may decide any issue. 

•  Interpret the meaning of any judicial order. 

•  Calculate response times or certain deadlines.  

•  Let you speak to a judge outside of a court hearing.  

•  Give you free copies of documents from your case. 

•  Conduct legal research for you. 

 

 

RESPONSIBILITIES OF SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANTS 

As a self-represented litigant, you have certain responsibilities and take on certain risks. 

In  particular,  you  must  ensure  that  you  conduct  your  case  and  present  your  filings  in 

compliance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (“Fed. R. Civ. P.” or “the Rules”) 

and the Local Rules for the District of Maine (“D. Me. Loc. R.” or “the Local Rules”). In 

addition,  you  should  familiarize  yourself  with  the  Federal  Rules  of  Evidence  (“Fed.  R. 

Evid.” or “the Rules of Evidence”) and any substantive law that governs the merits of your 

civil  action.  The  fact  that  you  do  not  have  an  attorney  does  not  relieve  you  of  these 

responsibilities.  

The following list of responsibilities is not intended to be exhaustive, and only provides 

a few examples of the manner in which self-represented litigants are expected to conduct 

themselves when pursuing an action in this Court:  

.  You are required to diligently prosecute your lawsuit. Unless and until you obtain 

an attorney to represent you, it is your responsibility to do everything necessary to 

prepare  your  case  for  trial.  This  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  responding  to 

discovery  requests  and  motions.  If  the  case  goes  to  trial,  it  will  also  be  your 

responsibility to present your case in court.  

  1

 

2.  Do not expect any correspondence or orders from the Court instructing you about 

how to pursue your lawsuit. If you fail to follow established procedures and orders 

issued by the Court, your case may be subject to dismissal.  

3.  You  must  file  all  pleadings  with  the  Court  and  all  pleadings  must  contain  your 

signature  on  the  last  page  as  provided  in  Rule  5  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil 

Procedure  (Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  5),  you  are  required  to  serve  the  opposing  parties’ 

attorney (or the opposing party themself, if they are self-represented) with copies of 

5 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

all  pleadings  and  motions  filed  with  the  Court.  Likewise,  each  opposing  party  is 

required to serve you with copies of all pleadings they file with the Court. 

4.  Each  pleading  must  contain  the  case  caption,  docket  number,  and  title  of  the 

document.  

5.  Documents filed with the Court are publicly available. As provided in Rule 5.2 of 

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2), you must take special 

care  not  to  disclose  in  your  filings  anyone’s  social  security  number,  taxpayer-

identification number, birth date, the full name of a minor, or a financial account 

number. All such references must be “redacted.”  This means that before you file 

the document with the Court you must make sure that the document contains only 

the last four digits of the Social Security or taxpayer number, only the year of the 

individual’s  birth,  only  the  minor’s  initials  and  only  the  last  four  digits  of  the 

financial  account  number.  The  person  filing  the  document  is  responsible  for 

making  these  redactions.  Rule  5.2  protects  an  individual’s  privacy  because  all 

filings submitted to the Court, whether in electronic or in paper format, will appear 

on the docket and be publicly available.  

6.  You must keep the Court and the all other involved parties advised of any change 

of your address or telephone number. This is done by providing a Notice of Change 

of Address in writing. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, 

which could include the dismissal of your case.   

7.  You  should  retain  for  your  records  a  copy  of  every  document  you  submit  to  the 

Court. You may obtain copies from the Clerk’s Office for a fee. The Clerk’s Office  

may not provide you with copies free of charge.

WHERE TO FIND LEGAL ADVICE 

If you decide that you do not wish to represent yourself but do not know of a lawyer 

who  can  assist  you,  you  should  consult  the  Yellow  Pages  of  your  telephone  directory, 

search  out  a  federally-licensed  attorney  on  the  Internet,  or  call  the  Maine  State  Bar 

Association Lawyer Referral Service (1-800-860-1460). If your income qualifies, you may 

be eligible for free or low-cost legal assistance from an office of Pine Tree Legal Assistance 

(1-800-442-4293) or from the Volunteer Lawyers Project of Maine (207-774-4348). If you 

are over 60 years old, you may be eligible for legal assistance from an office of the Legal 

Services for the Elderly (1-800-750-5353). Some attorneys and law firms also provide “pro 

bono” (free) legal services to persons unable to afford their services. The Court does not 

maintain a list of such attorneys, but you are free to inquire of law firms on your own behalf 

as to if they provide pro bono services.  

 

WHAT IS A FEDERAL CASE? 

The United States  District Court for the  District of Maine is a federal court with 

limited jurisdiction. This means that the Court only has jurisdiction, or legal authority, to 

hear certain types of cases. This makes it unlike the State of Maine “District and “Superior” 

Courts, which have jurisdiction over most legal disputes arising in Maine.  

Cases that may be filed with the United States District Court by private individuals 

include: 

•  Civil cases with at least one claim that arises under the United States Constitution 

and/or federal law. If this is the only basis for jurisdiction, then related state law 

claims, if any, may be included in the case but they must arise out of the same group 

of facts as the federal claim(s) in the case.  

•  Civil cases brought against the United States of America and its agencies, and civil 

cases against federal officers or employees based on acts undertaken in the scope of 

their federal duties, even if the claim or claims in the case arise under state law. 

7 

 
 

 

 

 

•  Civil cases that arise under state law but are between persons who reside in different 

states,  provided  that  the  amount  in  controversy  exceeds  $75,000,  so-called 

“diversity of citizenship” cases.  

•  Cases based on the United States District Court’s admiralty (maritime) jurisdiction. 

If your case does not fall under any of these categories, the United States District Court 

may not be the appropriate court.  

Cases that should not be filed with the Unites States District Court:    

•  Cases between persons who live in Maine involving only state law claims.  

•  Cases  arising  out  of  domestic  relations,  which  include  divorce,  protection  from 

abuse,  and  parental  rights  and  responsibilities.  However,  cases  arising  under  the 

Hague Convention on Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction may be filed 

in the United States District Court.  

•  Cases  by  prisoners  who  seek  relief  based  exclusively  on  state  law,  rules,  and/or 

regulations, that do not allege a violation of the United States Constitution or federal 

law. 

It is your burden to demonstrate that your case belongs in federal court.  If your case 

does  not  belong  in  the  United  States  District  Court,  it  does  not  mean  you  are  without 

recourse. You may be able to file your case in state court.  

HOW TO FILE A CIVIL ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT 

“A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.”  See Fed. R. 

Civ. P. 3. In addition, you must complete certain forms. The following paragraphs explain 

the  components  of  a  Complaint  and  identify  the  administrative  documents  the  Clerk’s 

Office will require you to file to open a new case. (Underlined documents are available as 

downloadable forms on the Court’s website under the “Self-Representation” tab or upon 

request in paper format.) 

 

8 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

1. Complaint. The “Complaint” is the document that the plaintiff needs to file with 

the Court to initiate a lawsuit. You may write your own Complaint or use the complaint 

form provided by the Court.  

A Complaint does not need to be typewritten but must be legible if handwritten. It 

must be submitted on 8 ½″ x 11″ paper. The Complaint should contain:   

a.  A caption or heading specifying the court in which it is being filed. 

All  plaintiffs  and  defendants  must  be  listed  in  the  caption  of  the 

Complaint.  

b.  A title, i.e. ― Complaint. 

c.  The name and address of each plaintiff and defendant.  

d.  One or more paragraphs explaining why this Court has jurisdiction, or 

legal authority, to decide the case.  

e.  Separate  numbered  paragraph(s)  that  set  forth  a  short  and  plain 

statement of the facts that give rise to the complaint and state the nature 

of  the  claim  or  claims  being  advanced.  The  statement  of  facts  should 

include a description of what the defendant(s) did or failed to do and how 

those  acts  or  omissions  caused  injury  or  damage  to  you,  as  well  as  a 

description of any injury sustained by you and what medical treatment, if 

any, was required. If you fail to provide the facts that demonstrate how 

each  defendant  was  personally  involved  in  and/or  responsible  for  the 

alleged  incident  or  harm  to  you,  it    may  result  in  dismissal  of  that 

defendant or the entire case.  

f.  The  date,  with  your  original  signature,  followed  by  your  complete 

mailing  address  and  telephone  number.  You  should  exercise  care  to 

assure that all statements you have give are true and accurate. 

g.  Jury Demand. When filing a Complaint (or an Answer) you should 

consider whether you  want a jury to  decide  your case. If a jury trial is 

desired, a jury demand must be requested and included in the title of the 

Complaint  or  Answer  (you  do  not  need  to  file  a  separate  document 

9 

 
 

 

 

 

demanding a jury trial). If you fail to demand a jury trial you will waive 

your  right  to  a  jury  trial.  In  some  types  of  cases,  such  as  tort  actions 

against the United States, jury trials are not available. 

h.  Rule  11  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  prohibits  filing 

lawsuits that are clearly frivolous or filed with the intent to harass another 

individual. If, after reviewing your Complaint, the Court determines that 

you have filed a lawsuit for an improper or clearly unnecessary purpose, 

it  may  impose  sanctions  against  you.  Those  sanctions  may  include 

ordering you to pay a fine or pay the legal fees of the person or persons 

against whom you filed the lawsuit. 

ote: The initial complaint and accompanying case opening documents must be filed 
with the Court in paper form. Electronic case filing is only available to self-represented 
parties after the complaint has been received.  
 

2. Civil Cover Sheet JS-44. You need to complete this form when you file your 

Complaint with the Court. 

3. Filing Fee or Application to Proceed Without the Prepayment of Fees and 

Costs. Cash, a credit card, money order, cashier’s check, or personal check, (made payable 

to “Clerk, USDC”) are acceptable forms of payment,   

If you are unable to afford the filing fee and service costs, you may ask the Court to 

waive those fees and costs. To do so, you must file an Application for Leave to Proceed in 

District  Court  Without  Prepayment  of  Fees  or  Costs.  The  Application  incorporates  an 

affidavit. An affidavit is a document that you complete and sign under penalty of perjury 

declaring that the information provided is true and accurate. The application must be fully 

completed,  typewritten  or  legibly  handwritten  and  include  your  original  signature.  The 

application to proceed without payment of the filing fee will be docketed in your electronic 

case file, meaning that it will be accessible to members of the public.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? 

After the plaintiff completes and files the Complaint and supporting documentation 

a case manager or other Clerk’s Office staff will: 

1.  File stamp the documents. (The file stamp shows the date and time of filing.) 

2.  Assign a case number and judges (both a district judge and a magistrate judge). 

The case number (for example, 1:22-cv-00123-JAW) is broken down into five 

parts: Bangor (1) or Portland (2); the year the case was filed (here, 22); “cv” 

for  civil  case;  the  sequence  of  case  (here,  “00123”);  and  the  initials  of  the 

District Judge to whom the case is assigned (here, “JAW”).  

3.  Provide  Notice  of  Lawsuit  and  Request  for  Waiver  Service  and  Waiver  of 

Service of Summons forms, or if requested, signed Summons forms. 

 

4.  Write a receipt for the filing fee. 

If the plaintiff is asking that the filing fee be waived, then steps 3 and 4 will not take 

place.  Instead,  a  judge  will  first  conduct  an  initial  review  to  decide  whether  (a)  the 

application to proceed without prepayment of the filing fees and costs should be granted 

and (b) the complaint is subject to dismissal for asserting “frivolous and malicious” claims 

or  for  failure  to  state  a  claim  on  which  relief  may  be  granted.  See  28  U.S.C.  § 

1915(e)(2)(B). 

If the Court grants the application and determines that the complaint states a claim 

against one or more defendants, then the Court will issue an order for service instructing 

the  Clerk’s  Office  to  prepare  the  necessary  paperwork  to  serve  the  defendant(s)  on  the 

plaintiff’s behalf. For purposes of service, it is the plaintiff’s responsibility to provide the 

Court with the address(es) where the defendant(s) can be served.  

11 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If the Court denies the application to proceed without prepayment, the Court will 

issue  an order explaining why. At this point, the case may be dismissed if the plaintiff does 

not pay the filing fee by the date ordered. If a plaintiff is required to pay the filing fee, then 

the plaintiff must make their own arrangements to serve the defendant(s). 

SERVING A COMPLAINT 

As provided in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d), a plaintiff will ordinarily request 

that the defendant waive formal service (that is, the formal delivery of the Complaint or 

other papers to the defendant, officially notifying the defendant of the action). Generally, 

a  plaintiff  will  send  the  defendant  a  copy  of  the  Complaint  together  with  a  Notice  of 

Lawsuit  and  Request  for  Waiver  Service  and  Waiver  of  the  Service  of  Summons. 

Typically, the defendant will sign the waiver of service and return it to the plaintiff who 

then must file it with the Court. The action will then proceed as if service of a summons 

and Complaint has been made.  

If the defendant does not waive service, the plaintiff must complete a Summons, 

present it to a Clerk’s Office staff member to sign and seal, and then have it served upon 

the defendant in accordance with Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Procedure.  

For more information on service of process in a civil case. See Appendix A, Guidance 

Concerning Service of Process. 

  

HOW TO RESPOND TO AN ACTION FILED AGAINST YOU 

The defendant in a lawsuit is the person against whom relief or recovery is sought 

in a Complaint. Like the plaintiff, an individual defendant may be self-represented. If you 

are a self-represented defendant, keep in mind that you should seriously consider obtaining 

professional legal assistance.  

The first step in representing yourself as a defendant is to respond to the Complaint 

by filing a Motion or an Answer. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12. An Answer is a formal written 

statement responding to the Complaint setting forth the grounds for a defense. The Rules 

set a deadline for a defendant to answer or respond to a Complaint. Typically, a defendant 

must  file  an  Answer  or  responsive  motion  within  21  days  after  being  served  with  the 
12 

 
 

 

 

 
 
summons and Complaint. If a defendant receives a request to waive service, and s/he elects 

 

 

to waive formal service s/he must return the form to the plaintiff within 30 days of the date 

the Notice of Lawsuit and Request for Waiver was mailed to the defendant. If the defendant 

signs the “Waiver of Service,” s/he is allowed 60 days from the date the plaintiff mailed 

the waiver to respond to the Complaint. The United States government, its agencies, and 

employees have 60 days from the date of service to respond to a Complaint. 

The  defendant’s  “Answer”  or  responsive  motion  must  be  filed  with  the  Clerk’s 

Office and shall include the case caption that appears on the Complaint. The Answer should 

state any defenses that may exist to the plaintiff’s claims and admit or deny each of the 

allegations in the Complaint. The defendant may request a jury trial, and the request may 

be made within the Answer. The defendant also must mail a copy of the Motion or Answer 

to the plaintiff(s).  

A form Answer and a form Answer with Counterclaim or Crossclaim are available 

as downloadable forms on the Court’s website under the “Self-Representation” tab or upon 

request in paper format. Use the form Answer if you do not have or do not intend to file a 

claim  for  relief  against  the  plaintiff.  Use  the  form  “Answer  with  Counterclaim  or 

Crossclaim” if you intend to answer the Complaint against you and you also want to assert 

your own claim or claims against the plaintiff (claims asserted by a defendant against a 

plaintiff are called “counterclaims”) or against another defendant (called a “crossclaim”). 

If you have a counterclaim, you must file a counterclaim or else you will lose the right to 

assert your claim(s) at a later date. See Rule 13 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  

The defendant must mail a copy of every document that s/he files with the Court to 

the  plaintiff’s  attorney  or  the  plaintiff  (if  the  plaintiff  is  self-represented)  and  to  any 

additional parties involved in the case. The defendant must attach a Certificate of Service 

to these documents. Just as the defendant is required to respond to the plaintiff’s Complaint, 

the  plaintiff  or  crossclaim  defendant  is  also  required  to  respond  to  any  counterclaim  or 

crossclaim filed by the defendant. See Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for 

the required deadlines for these responses.  

 

13 

 

 

Whether  you  are  a  defendant  served  with  a  Complaint,  a  plaintiff  served  with  a 

counterclaim, or a defendant served with a crossclaim, do not delay in filing your response. 

When a party does not file a timely Answer or other response with the Court, the opposing 

party  may  ask  the  Clerk  of  Court  to  enter  a  default  which  may  result  in  the  entry  of  a 

judgment by the Court against the party who failed to answer or otherwise respond. 

 

 

REQUIREMENT TO FILE A DIVERSITY DISCLOSURE STATEMENT 

Diversity of citizenship is when parties on opposing sides of a lawsuit are citizens 

of different states.  

All parties in diversity cases must identify their citizenship by filing a disclosure 

statement with their first appearance in a case. If your citizenship information changes at 

any point during the pendency of your case, you must file a supplemental disclosure 

statement updating your citizenship information with the court. See Rule 7.1(a)(2) of the 

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rule 7.1(a)(2). 

A form Diversity Disclosure Statement is available as a downloadable form on the 

Court’s website under the “Self-Representation” tab or upon request in paper format.  

CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE 

A  Certificate  of  Service  is  a  statement  identifying  who  was  served,  at  what 

address(es), when they were served and the method of service. A certificate of service is 

proof  that  copies  of  documents  for  filing  have  been  sent  to  the  opposing  party  or  the 

opposing party’s attorney.  

Note: A certificate of service is only required for service of documents on parties 

who do not receive filings electronically via the Court’s electronic case filing system (ECF) 

or when serving sealed documents on all parties. A certificate of service is not applicable 

to the filing of the Complaint. Service of the Complaint is a separate process entirely. For 

more  information  regarding  service  of  the  Complaint.  See  Appendix  A,  Guidance 

Concerning Service of Process. Certificates of service apply to documents filed with the 

14 

 
 

 

   

 

 
 
Court after service of the Complaint has been made on the defendant(s). See Federal Rule 

 

 

of Civil Procedure 5 for more information regarding service of documents filed with the 

Court.  

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

Service of Public Documents versus Service of Sealed Documents 

Whenever a public (non-sealed) document is filed using the Court’s electronic case 

filing  system  (ECF),  the  ECF  system,  will  automatically  generate  and  send  a  Notice  of 

Electronic Filing (NEF) to all participants in the case who are registered for electronic case 

filing. All ECF registered participants will be able to click on a link contained in the NEF 

to view the actual  PDF document(s) that have been filed. In this instance, service is being 

made  electronically  via  the  Court’s  ECF  system.  Any  case  participants  who  are  not 

registered for the Court’s ECF system will need to be served another way.  

Whenever  a  sealed  document  is  filed,  the  Court’s  electronic  case  filing  system 

(ECF),  will  automatically  generate  and  send  a  Notice  of  Electronic  Filing  (NEF)  to  all 

participants  in  the  case  who  are  registered  for  electronic  filing.  The  NEF  will  alert 

participants that a sealed filing has been made but participants will not be able to view the 

actual sealed  PDF document(s) that has been filed. Service of sealed documents will need 

to be made by another way.  

AMENDING PLEADINGS 

After a party files a pleading consisting of a Complaint, Answer, counterclaim or 

crossclaim, there is an opportunity to amend the pleading. See Rule 15 of the Federal Rules 

of Civil Procedure and the scheduling order issued in your case willprovide you with more 

information.  

ELECTRONIC FILING 

You  must  have  a  case  pending  to  register  for  electronic  filing.  Self-represented 

plaintiffs must file their initial pleadings (Complaint and Civil Cover Sheet, together with 

the Filing Fee or Application to Proceed Without the Prepayment of Fees and Costs) with 
15 

 
 
the Court in paper form. You may register for electronic filing by submitting a completed 

 

 

ECF Registration Form along with your initial pleadings or at any point thereafter. Persons 

interested in electronic filing should refer to Appendix B, Guidance for Electronic Filing 

in the District of Maine. 

 

SCHEDULING ORDERS 

After all of the defendants have entered their appearances, either by filing an Answer 

or  a  Motion,  the  Court  will  issue  a  Scheduling  Order.  If  a  defendant  files  a  Motion  to 

Dismiss  the  Complaint,  the  Court  will  ordinarily  decide  that  motion  before  issuing  a 

scheduling order. The Scheduling Order will set deadlines for completing different stages 

of the case. The Scheduling Order will also ordinarily specify deadlines for amending the 

pleadings, conducting discovery, and being ready for trial.  

If you are concerned about your ability to comply with deadlines contained in the 

Scheduling Order, you should consult with the other parties (if they are represented, you 

will need to consult with their attorney) to see if they will agree to a modification of the 

schedule.  If  they  all  agree,  you  should  file  a  motion  requesting  a  modification  of  the 

schedule indicating to the Court that the parties are in agreement. Make sure to specify the 

new  deadlines  or  other  modifications  you  are  requesting.  If  one  of  the  parties  does  not 

agree, you should indicate that in your motion requesting a modification of the schedule. 

A Motion is a written request filed by any party in the case who wants to ask the 

Court for an order directing some sort of action in the case.

Representation” tab or upon request in paper format.

CONDUCTING DISCOVERY 

Discovery is the process of obtaining case-related information from the opposing 

party or from non-party witnesses. Discovery is allowable in most civil cases but not in 

Social Security appeals. The process of discovery is governed by Rules 26 through 37 of 

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as well as Local Rule 26. The Scheduling Order will 

contain a deadline for the completion of discovery. There are many different ways to obtain 

discovery. The most common ways include: 

•  Interrogatories (written questions to the opposing party). 

•  Requests for production of documents from the opposing party. 

•  Requests for admissions from the opposing party. 

•  Depositions (a recorded questioning of a party or a potential witness under 

oath). 

•  Requests to examine a person or premises or personal property if the claims 

in the case make such a request appropriate. 

If your case involves discovery, here are some things you should know: 

•  The discovery process takes place between and among the parties. A litigant 

should not provide the Court with copies of discovery requests or responses 

unless an issue arises and the Court requests the materials. 

•  You  should  send  the  opposing  party  or  parties  discovery  requests  promptly 

after the Court issues the Scheduling Order, so the party to whom the discovery 

is  directed  has  sufficient  time  to  answer  or  object  before  the  discovery 

deadline. 

•  You should respond to any discovery requests you receive. A party who does 

not respond to a discovery request may be subject to sanctions. 

•  If  you  object  to  a  discovery  request  made  of  you,  you  should  express  your 

objection in your response to preserve your objection. A party with a discovery 

dispute  must  first  confer  with  the  opposing  party  in  a  good  faith  effort  to 

17 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

resolve  the  issue  in  dispute  by  agreement.  If  that  good  faith  effort  is 

unsuccessful, the moving party (either the party seeking to compel production 

of discovery or the party seeking protection from a discovery request) must file 

a Request for Hearing re Discovery Dispute using the Court’s form seeking a 

prompt hearing with a judicial officer by telephone or in person.  

 

 

There are limits to how much discovery you may request from an opposing party 

and how much discovery may be requested of you. You will need to review the discovery 

section of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Scheduling Order to determine the 

appropriate  scope  of  your  discovery  requests  and  responses.  The  discovery  rules  also 

impose affirmative responsibilities on the parties to disclose certain information without 

being asked for it. Again, you must consult the Rules and you may also need to consult 

related  case  law  to  understand  your  discovery  responsibilities.  Failure  to  comply  with 

disclosure  or  discovery  requirements  during  the  discovery  process  may  expose  you  to 

sanctions, including a sanction that precludes you from using non-disclosed evidence or 

exhibits at a later hearing or trial.  

  

If you believe your case also requires someone other than your opponent to provide 

testimony or produce documents or tangible things, you should also review Rules 34(c) 

and  45  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  and  any  related  law,  to  understand  the 

process for obtaining discovery from third parties. 

 

In the event you and another party to the case cannot agree about disclosures and 

discovery,  you  may  ask  the  Court  to  resolve  the  dispute.  Sometimes  the  party  seeking 

discovery will want to ask the Court to order the other party to produce something that has 

been withheld in discovery. Sometimes the party seeking to withhold something sought by 

the other party will want to ask the Court to issue a protective order relieving the party of 

their responsiblity  obligation to respond. In either case, the parties  must confer in  good 

faith to attempt to resolve their dispute before seeking relief from the Court. If the parties 

cannot resolve their dispute, then typically a magistrate judge will preside over an informal 

telephonic  discovery  conference  to  resolve  the  dispute.  A  party  must  use  this  informal 

18 

 
 

 

 
 
process  initially,  and  must  not  file  a  motion  seeking  discovery-related  relief.  See  Local 

 

 

Rule 7(a). If the presiding Judge concludes that the dispute cannot be resolved through an 

informal discovery conference, the Judge may order that the matter proceed through formal 

motion practice.  

HEARINGS AND TRIALS 

A  “hearing”  is  a  formal  proceeding  in  which  the  parties  are  heard  by  a  judge 

concerning the facts and law that apply to an important issue in the case. A hearing may be 

limited  to  oral  argument  concerning  the  facts  and  law  presented  in  motion  papers,  or  a 

hearing  may  be  a  proceeding  at  which  the  parties  introduce  witness  testimony  and 

documents for the judge’s consideration.  

The  most  common  pretrial  hearing  in  a  civil  case  is  a  hearing  on  a  Motion  for 

Summary  Judgment.  In  this  District,  a  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  is  governed  by 

special rules that require the parties to present the facts in support of their case through 

paper  filings  called  statements  of  material  facts,  along  with  supporting  documents  like 

affidavits and exhibits. These requirements are outlined in Local Rule 56. Typically, if the 

parties request a hearing on a Motion for Summary Judgment, the Court will hold a hearing 

to allow the parties to present oral argument in support of or in opposition to a Motion for 

Summary Judgment, but not to present evidence. If the parties do not request a hearing, 

and  if  the  judge  determines  that  a  hearing  is  not  necessary,  a  Motion  for  Summary 

Judgment may be decided soley based on the paper record.  

 

A “trial” is the most formal kind of hearing. Trials may be a “jury trial”, meaning a 

jury will resolve any factual disputes between the parties, or a “bench trial,” meaning the 

judge will resolve any factual disputes. A trial typically begins with the parties providing 

their opening statements. Thereafter, the parties are required to present the case by calling 

witnesses to the stand, asking them questions, and presenting  them  with exhibits so the 

exhibits can be introduced and admitted for the judge and/or jury to review. A trial may 

involve only a single witness or it may involve many witnesses. The plaintiff will proceed 

first, followed by the defendant. Sometimes the plaintiff will reserve the opportunity to call 

19 

 

 

 

 

 
 
one  or  more  rebuttal  witnesses  in  response  to  the  defendant’s  presentation.  If  the  case 

 

 

involves a bench trial, then after the parties have completed their presentations the judge 

will provide an opportunity for each side to give a closing argument and will either make 

a ruling in open court or may instead take the matter under advisement and issue a written 

decision.  If  the  case  involves  a  jury  trial,  then  after  the  parties  have  completed  their 

presentations the judge will instruct the jury on the law, after which the parties will give 

their closing arguments to the jury, and the jury will then deliberate in private to reach its 

verdict.  

 

Many different issues can arise in the context of a trial. Some issues are addressed 

before the start of a trial, such as the selection of the jury in a jury trial, the exchange of 

witness  and  exhibit  lists,  and  the  potential  resolution  of  evidentiary  disputes  through 

“Motions in Limine.”  Other issues may arise during a trial, such as issues over the proper 

examination of witnesses, evidentiary objections, and motions for judgment as a matter of 

law.  Still  more  issues  can  arise  at  the  conclusion  of  the  trial  process,  such  as  post-trial 

motions,  bills  of  costs,  and  the  filing  of  appeals  after  the  entry  of  judgment.  Except  as 

outlined  below,  these  issues  are  beyond  the  scope  of  this  Handout.  Thus,  you  should 

consider carefully what the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the District of Maine Local 

Rules, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, and any applicable law may require of 

you so that you do not accidently waive any of your rights during or after trial.  

POST-JUDGMENT PROCEEDINGS 

  Once all issues in the case have been determined, the Clerk’s Office will enter the 

Court’s “Judgment” in accordance with Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures. 

At this time the case in the District Court will be closed and the prevailing parties may 

pursue their costs, while parties dissatisfied with the resolution of the case may pursue an 

appeal.  

The party that ultimately  wins a lawsuit may be awarded certain costs of litigation. 

These costs are assessed by the Clerk of Court and must be paid by the losing party. If the 

BILL OF COSTS 

20 

 

 

 
 
plaintiff  wins  the  case,  a  Bill  of  Costs  form  may  be  completed  and  filed  against  the 

 

 

defendant(s). However, if the plaintiff loses, the defendant(s) may complete and file a Bill 

of Costs form against the plaintiff. These costs, which are explained more fully at 28 U.S.C. 

§ 1920 and Local Rule 54.3, include expenses such as deposition(s), printing, witness fees, 

and other costs. Even if the plaintiff was initially granted leave to file their case without 

the prepayment of fees and costs, costs may be assessed against the plaintiff if the defendant 

prevails. To obtain more information, review the District of Maine’s Guidelines for Filing 

Bills of Costs. 

 

APPEAL 

If  you  intend  to  appeal  the  decision  or  verdict  of  the  judge  or  jury,  you  should 

carefully review the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure (Fed. R. App. P.). There is a 

deadline for filing a “Notice of Appeal.”   See Fed. R. App. P. 4.  

If a party believes a jury verdict or decision rendered by the Court was incorrect, 

and they file an appeal, the appeal will be decided by the United States Court of Appeals 

for the First Circuit in Boston, Massachusetts. An appeal of a decision is commenced by 

completing  and  filing  a  Notice  of  Appeal  form  with  this  Court.  The  Notice  of  Appeal 

should contain a description of the party or parties filing the appeal, a description of the 

judgment or order or the part of the order that you wish to dispute. If more than one party 

wishes to appeal the decision or verdict, each party must file a separate Notice of Appeal.  

There is a fee for filing a Notice of Appeal unless the person filing the appeal has 

already been granted leave to proceed without prepayment of fees and costs. A party who 

has  previously  been  granted  such  leave  need  not  file  a  new  motion  to  proceed  without 

prepayment on appeal, unless the District Court certifies that the appeal was not taken in 

good faith,  See Fed. R. App. P. 24(a)(3).  

 

Several forms are referenced in this Handout. In addition to the forms provided by the 

District of Maine, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has created a number of 

FORMS  

21 

 

 
 
forms,  including  some  specialized  forms  for  certain  types  of  cases.  The  Administrative 

 

 

Office’s forms can be found at http://www.uscourts.gov/forms/pro-se-forms  

When using forms, keep in mind the following: 

1.  Not Legal Advice. No form provides legal advice. No form substitutes for having 

or consulting a lawyer. If you are not a lawyer and are suing or have been sued, it is 

best to have or consult a lawyer if possible. 

2.  No  Guarantee.  Using  a  form  as  a  guide  does  not  guarantee  that  any  pleading  is 

legally or factually correct or sufficient. 

3.  No More Than a Template. Forms offer a template for you to use to file documents 

in the format that lawyers and judges are accustomed to using. However, the core 

content will have to come from you, as the forms do not provide examples of, for 

example, how to set forth the elements of a legal claim in a Complaint, or how to 

brief the merits of an issue in a motion or respond to a motion. To create this content, 

you will need to set forth the facts and the law and explain why they lead to the 

relief you are requesting.  

4.  No  Guidance  on  Timing  or  Parties.  The  forms  do  not  give  any  guidance  on 

important issues like deadlines or which parties should be included. For example, a 

form Complaint will not advise you of any applicable statute of limitation or any 

process  you  may  need  to  go  through  before  filing  a  Complaint,  such  as  in  an 

administrative forum. Nor will a form Complaint advise you about who is the proper 

defendant to assert a particular claim against, if the law requires a particular choice.  

5.  Privacy  Requirements.  Remember  that  Rule  5.2  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil 

Procedure requires that every participant in a case that files a document with the 

Court,  has  to  protect  the  privacy  and  security  concerns  of  themselves  and  others 

when filing documents that will be accessible on the public docket. Under this Rule, 

documents filed with the Court should not contain any person’s full social-security 

number or full birth date; the name of a person known to be a minor; or a complete 

financial-account number. A filing may include only the last four digits of a social-

 

22 

 

 

security number and taxpayer identification number; the year of someone’s  birth; a 

minor’s initials; and the last four digits of a financial-account number.

DISTRICT OF MAINE 

 

GUIDANCE CONCERNING SERVICE OF PROCESS 
 
Christa K. Berry, Clerk of Court 
 
March 2022 

 

 

This  information  is  intended  as  an  informative  and  practical  resource.  It 
cannot take the place of an attorney’s legal advice, nor will it answer all of 
your questions about what you need to do to serve a defendant or crossclaim 
defendant with process.  

 

 

   

       

24 

 
 

   

 

 

 

 
 
All parties facing legal action against them must be notified.  
  
“Service of process” involves serving the defendant(s) with a copy of the 
complaint and is the procedure that officially notifies the defendant(s) 
that a lawsuit has been filed. 
  
This section will explain:  
  

  How to notify the defendant(s) that a lawsuit has been filed.  
  When the court will assist with service. 

•  Is there a time limit for serving the complaint?   

  
Yes. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4 establishes a time limit of 90 days 
following the filing of the complaint with the court for service to be made 
on the defendant(s). See Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for 
more information.  
   
If you do not meet this deadline, the court may dismiss all claims against 
any party who has not been timely served. 
  
  

•  Who is responsible for serving the complaint? Will the court 

assist me with making service?  

If… 

Then… 

You applied for leave to 
proceed without prepaying 
the filing fee and your 
application was granted 

The Clerk’s Office will arrange for 
service of the complaint on the 
defendant(s). However, service may 
not be carried out right away 
because complaints filed by persons 
proceeding without prepayment of 
the filing fee are subject to a 
mandatory screening process 
(pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 
1915(e)(2)), and that process can 
delay service. Service will not 
proceed until the judge issues an 
Order for Service.  

service of the complaint on the 
defendant(s). See Rule 4(c) of the 

25 

You have paid the filing fee  You are responsible for coordinating 

   

  

 

 

 

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for 
more information regarding service. 
  

•  I paid the filing fee and am therefore responsible for service. 

How do I go about serving the defendant(s)?  
  

A Summons is a form prepared by the plaintiff(s) and issued by the court 
that informs a defendant(s) that he/she is being sued and has a certain 
number of days to respond to the complaint. There are specific rules that 
must be followed as to who may serve a summons.  
  
You may be able to serve the defendant(s) by waiver of service, but only if 
the defendant(s) agree.  
  
It is critical that service of the complaint be made exactly the way the law 
requires. If the complaint is not served properly on the opposing party, it 
could be subject to dismissal by the court.  
  
The below sections will explain how to request the defendant(s) to waive 
service and how to get a summons issued by the court.  
  
  

WAIVER OF SERVICE 
  
 

•  What is a waiver of service?  

   
A waiver of service of summons means that a party voluntarily enters a 
lawsuit without requiring the opposing party to officially serve them with 
a summons. Waiving service means agreeing to give up the right to 
service in person and instead accepting service by mail.   

•  What are the benefits to waiving service?   

   
One benefit to the plaintiff(s) is avoiding the cost and/or inconvenience of 
having the summons served in person on the defendant(s).  
   
One benefit to the defendant(s) is that they will have more time to answer 
the complaint. When service is made by summons, the answer is due 
within 21 days of service. However, when service is waived, the answer is 

26 

 
 

  
 

  

  

 

 
 
due within 60 days from the date the waiver was sent to the opposing 
party.  

 

 

• 

 May I get the defendant(s) to waive service?   

   
You may ask for a waiver of service from any party except  

•  A minor or incompetent person.  
•  The United States government, its agencies, corporations, officers, 

•  A foreign, state, or local government. See Rule 4 of the Maine Rules 

or employees.  

of Civil Procedure. 
   

•  How do I request that the defendant(s) waive service?   

   
To request waiver of service from the defendant(s), you will need two 
forms, which you can obtain from the Clerk’s Office or download from the 
Court’s website: 
   

•  Notice of Lawsuit and Request to Waive Service of Summons form, 

and  

•  Waiver of Service of Summons form.  

   
To request a waiver of service, complete and send the above-listed two 
forms to the defendant(s) by first-class mail, along with a copy of the 
complaint and supporting documents filed with the court. See Rule 4(d) 
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for more information regarding 
waiver of service. 

  
   
Note:   
   
When completing the Notice of Lawsuit and Request to Waive Service of 
Summons Form, you will need to input on the form a time frame for the 
defendant to return to you the signed waiver form (if he/she elects to 
agree to waive service).  
  
When completing the Waiver of Service of Summons Form, you will need 
to input the date the waiver was sent. This is the date that you place 
your completed request to waive service paperwork in the mail to the 
defendant.  
  

27 

  

   

   

  

 

 

 

•  What do I do if a defendant agrees to waive service and sends 
me back the signed Waiver of Service of Summons Form?   

   
If you receive a signed waiver of service form, you do not need to do 
anything further to serve that defendant. Make a copy for your records 
and file the original waiver of service form with the Court.  

•  What if I requested a waiver of service and the form was not 

sent back?  

   
If a defendant does not return a signed waiver of service form by the due 
date you will need to arrange to serve that defendant by one of the other 
means approved by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  
  
  

SERVICE BY SUMMONS 

•  How do I submit a summons to the Clerk’s Office for Issuance?   

  
In order to serve the complaint, you must first get a Summons “issued” 
by the Clerk’s Office. The Clerk’s Office “issues” the summons by affixing 
the date and seal of the court. The form entitled “Summons in a Civil 
Action” is available in paper form at the Clerk’s Office or electronically on 
the Court’s website here.  
   
Note: Before you may serve the summons, it must be issued by the 
Clerk’s Office. Before submitting the summons to the Clerk’s Office for 
issuance you must prepare the summons by completing the upper 
portion of the form (everything above the date and signature of the Clerk 
lines needs to be completed before the Clerk’s Office will issue the 
summons). If your complaint names more than one defendant, you must 
prepare a separate summons form for each defendant.  
   

If…  

Then…  

You file in paper form (not

issuance by email to 
MaineECFIntake@med.uscou
rts.gov or may be submitted 
to the court in paper form in 
person or by mail  

   
The Clerk’s Office will not issue any summons(es) until the filing fee 
has been paid or until an Order for Service has been entered if you 
have been granted leave to proceed without prepayment of fees or 
costs. 
 

•  Who may serve the summons?   

  
See Rule 4(c)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for information 
regarding who may make service of the summons.  

•  What documents do I include with the Summons?   

   
You are required include a copy of your complaint and any supporting 
documents filed with the court.  
  
  

SERVICE ON THE UNITED STATES, ITS 
AGENCIES, OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES 

•  How do I serve the United States, its agencies, officers or 

employees?   

  
Service may be made by Summons sent by certified mail (return receipt 
required). Service needs to be made upon the U.S. Attorney for the 
district where the action is brought; the Attorney General of the United 
States; and the agency, corporation, officer, or employee in accordance 
with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(i).  

 
 

  

     

 

  
  

         

 

  

29 

 

 

•  What documents do I include when making service by certified 

mail upon the United States, its Agencies, Corporations, 
Officers, or Employees?   

   
You are required to serve a copy of a Summons that has been issued by 
the Clerk of Court, along with a copy of your complaint and any 
supporting documents filed with the court.  
  
Note: A separate summons is required for each entity referenced above 
(U.S. Attorney/Attorney General/Agency). 

•  What do I do when I get the certified mail return receipts?   

   
Once you have received the certified mail return receipts showing that 
the summons has been delivered, you must file them with the court as 
proof of service upon the defendant(s).

•  What are the pros and cons of electronic filing (ECF)?  

 

 

•  You may email your documents for filing, rather than going to the 

courthouse or paying for postage to mail your filings.  

•  You have until 11:59 p.m. for your documents to be electronically 
received by the court (as opposed to 4:30 p.m. for physical delivery 
of paper filings to the court). 

•  You will receive immediate email notification of activity and 

documents filed in your case instead of having to wait for paper 
copies to arrive in the mail.  

 
 

  
Pros:  
  

  
 Cons:  
  

•  There are hardware and software requirements associated with 

electronic filing.  

•  You must have an email address.  
•  You must have access to a Computer with Internet Access.  
•  Your computer must have software to convert documents from a 

word processor format to portable document format (PDF).  

  
Note: All documents for filing are to be created with word processing 
software and then converted to PDF format. A scanner is helpful when 
submitting documents for electronic filing. A scanner is ONLY to be used 
for exhibits (documents you did not/cannot electronically prepare 
yourself for electronic conversion to PDF format). 
  

•  Once registered for electronic filing, you will no longer receive paper 

service of documents in the mail. You will be responsible for 
checking your e-mail to check for filings and court orders.  

•  How do I start with electronic filing?  

  
You must have a pending case in order to register for electronic filing.  
  

ECF Registration Form 

  
Carefully review pages 2-3 of the ECF Registration Form for Pro Se Filers 
(see above link), which contains detailed instructions for electronic filing 
and conditions you must agree to abide by.  
  

32 

 

   

 

 

 
 
If you agree to comply with the instructions and conditions outlined in 
the registration form, complete the form and return the completed form 
to the Clerk’s Office for processing.  
  
Note: Once registered, you will not receive a login and password from the 
court. Instead, you email your documents for filing and a member of the 
Clerk’s Office will upload the filings to the docket. See pages 2-3 of the 
ECF Registration Form for Pro Se Filers for more detailed instructions on 
how to file electronically.  

 

•  Once registered, how do I receive electronic filings in my case?  

  
Once you are registered for electronic filing, whenever there is docket 
activity in your case you will receive an email. This email is a called a 
Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF).  
  
The NEF will include the caption of your case and the case number. 
There are different scenarios you will see within the NEF:  
  
Docket entries with a PDF 
document attached 

Docket entries without a 
PDF document attached 

Whenever a PDF document is 
attached to a docket entry the NEF 
will include a hyperlink to the 
document. Each docket entry with a 
PDF document attached is assigned 
a document number.  
  
Certain docket entries do not have a 
PDF document associated with 
them. These are called text-only 
entries. For text-only entries the 
document number will not contain a 
hyperlink. 
  
Certain text-only docket entries 
made by the Clerk’s Office are not 
assigned a document number, such 
as the resetting of deadlines.  
  

  
Note regarding docket entries with PDF documents attached:  You are 
permitted one “free look” at each PDF document by clicking on the 
associated document number embedded within the NEF. Any 

33 

 

   

 

 

 
 
subsequent viewing of the document will be subject to PACER fees. See 
the FAQ Is there a way to look up my case without going to the courthouse 
for more information regarding PACER. There is a time limit associated 
with your one free look. You must view the document within 15 days of 
receipt of the NEF. After 15 days you will lose your one free look. To 
avoid fees, the best practice is to save and/or print the document 
immediately after accessing your one free look.  

 

•  Are there certain documents I will be unable to receive 

electronically?  

  
Yes. Certain docket entries may be restricted or sealed. An NEF will still 
be generated to alert you to the docket activity but will contain language 
that the document is sealed from public view or that access to the 
document is restricted to case participants only. You will not be able to 
retrieve these kinds of filings electronically. You will instead be served in 
paper form.  

•  What if I no longer wish to be an electronic filer?  

  
A termination request must be made in writing. The termination request 
may be filed via email to MaineECFIntake@med.uscourts.gov or may be 
filed in paper form with the Clerk’s Office.

•  What is a motion and how do I make or respond to 
one?  

  
A motion is a written request filed by any party to a lawsuit asking the 
judge for some sort of action in the case. Motions are the primary way to 
ask the court to act in a case.  
  
 Local Rule 7 – Motions and Memoranda of Law – also provides detailed 
information regarding motion practice.  
   
Every motion should include the case caption, the specific action 
requested (what you want the court to do) and the reason for the request. 
Motions must be submitted separately from other filings and contain the 
word “motion” in the title. The motion should incorporate a 
memorandum of law, which is a brief written summary in support of 
your request. If you are arguing a legal matter, you should include 
citations to supporting authorities, such as rules, statutes (laws), or case 
law that supports your position.  
   
There are two types of motions, dispositive and non-dispositive.  
   
Dispositive Motions   A dispositive motion asks to resolve entirely 

Non-Dispositive 
Motions  

one or more claims in the case. The most 
common types of dispositive motions are 
motions to dismiss and motions for 
summary judgment. Dispositive motions 
and responses to dispositive motions are 
limited to 20 pages. Replies to dispositive 
motions are limited to 7 pages.   
   
Non-Dispositive motions are all other 
motions filed during the course of the case. 
Common examples are motions to extend 
time to file documents and motions to 
exceed page limits. Non-Dispositive motions 
and responses to Non-Dispositive motions 
are limited to 10 pages. Replies to Non-
Dispositive motions are limited to 7 pages.  
  

   
Note: You do not need to make a motion for clerical things such as 
changing your address on the docket or requesting copies. Motions can 

36 

 
 

 

 
 
delay resolution of your case and divert the attention of the parties and 
the court from preparing for trial.  

 

 

•  How do I respond or reply to a motion?   

   
The party who files a motion is called the moving party. A party who does 
not want the motion to be granted is called the opposing party. The Local 
Rules establish time frames for the opposing party to respond to a 
motion and for the moving party to file any reply. Like a motion, the 
response must have an attached memorandum of law with citations to 
any supporting authorities, such as rules, statutes (laws), or case law 
that supports your position. See Local Rule 7 – Motions and Memoranda 
of Law for more detailed information regarding motion practice.  
   
Response   
   

When a motion is filed by a moving party the 
opposing party has 21 days from the date 
the motion was filed with the court to file 
any response to the motion. If no response is 
filed within the 21 days, the opposing party 
is deemed to have waived objection.  
   
Once the response is received by the Court, 
the filer of the motion will have 14 days to 
file any reply. The reply is the final filing 
permitted before the motion is submitted to 
the judge for consideration.  

•  What if I need more time to file something?   

  

If you need additional time to file a document, you must file a written 
motion with the court. Requests for more time may not be made verbally 
in person or over the phone. It is important to file your written motion 
before the current due date for the document expires.  

  

   

   

   

             

 

  

Reply  
   

37 

 

If there is a deadline set in my case and I have requested an 
• 
extension, but the motion has not yet been ruled on, what should 
I do?   

  
 If your motion to extend time was received and filed by the court, then 
you are protected from making the filing that is the subject of your 
motion until your motion to extend time is ruled on by the judge.  
  
   

•  How long will it take to get a ruling on my motion?  

   
The Clerk’s Office is unable to predict or advise on when rulings will be 
made by the judge.

INTRODUCTION 

The information in this Handout is for individuals who are representing themselves 

in civil actions in the District of Maine without the assistance of an attorney. Parties who 

choose to represent themselves are often referred to as pro se parties or pro se litigants. 

Pro se means “for yourself.”    

Unlike  attorneys,  pro  se  litigants  may  only  represent  themselves  and  may  only 

present  their  own  claims  and  defenses.  Under  the  law,  you  may  not  speak  for  another 

person or entity such as a company or business. This means that you may not file a class 

action lawsuit. A pro se litigant also may not authorize another person who is not a licensed 

attorney to appear for them. This includes a spouse, relative, or another party. 

The Court encourages all self-represented litigants to consult this Handout together 

with  the  Federal  Rules  of  Practice  and  Procedure,  including  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil 

Procedure and  the Federal Rules of Evidence (both are also available in Title 28 of the 

United States Code), the District of Maine Local Rules, and additional resources available 

on the Court’s website, including the forms and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).1 

THE DISTRICT OF MAINE 

The United States District Court for the District of Maine has courtrooms and offices 

in the City of Bangor and the City of Portland. Cases are filed in either the Bangor Federal 

Courthouse  or  the  Portland  Federal  Courthouse  depending  on  the  county  in  which  the 

lawsuit arises. Cases arising out of Aroostook, Franklin, Hancock, Kennebec, Penobscot, 

Piscataquis, Somerset, Waldo and Washington counties are filed and ordinarily heard in 

Bangor.  Cases  arising  out  of  Androscoggin,  Cumberland,  Knox2,  Lincoln,  Oxford, 

Sagadahoc and York counties are filed and ordinarily heard in Portland. 

 

 The Federal Rules, Local Rules, the United States Code, statues, etc. are regularly updated. You are responsible for 
making sure that you are using the most recent version of each. 

 Cases brought by inmates at the Maine State Prison in Warren must be filed in Bangor and are automatically referred 
to the magistrate judge in Bangor.

THE CLERK’S OFFICE 

The  authority  and  responsibilities  of  the  Clerk’s  Office  is  outlined  in  Rules  77 

through 79 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Christa Berry is the Clerk of Court for 

the District of Maine. Eric Storms is the Chief Deputy. When you write or call the Clerk’s 

Office, you will speak with a case manager. Case managers are responsible for maintaining 

 

 

 

3 

 
 

   

 

 

 
 
the official court record. They process paperwork, schedule matters before the judge, and 

 

 

perform work in the courtroom. Each judge has an assigned case manager who assists them 

with their cases. All case-related inquiries should be directed to the case manager to 

whom your case is assigned. You are not permitted to telephone, email, or mail the 

judge’s chambers directly. 

Case  managers  and  other  Clerk’s  Office  staff  may  assist  you  with  some  of  your 

inquiries, but they are not authorized to provide you with legal advice. In general, legal 

advice is advice about what the law is; how to succeed in your case; how to interpret the 

Constitution, statutes, rules or other sources of law.  

In addition to being unable to provide litigants with legal advice, Clerk’s Office staff 

are not allowed to:  

•  Make recommendations or suggest ways to help you win your case.  

Clerk’s  Office  staff  may  provide  assistance  regarding  court  administration  and 

docket management. Clerk’s Office staff may: 

•  Answer general questions about how the Court works.  

•  Give general information about court rules, terminology, procedures 

and practices.  

•  Provide or refer you to available court forms.  

•  Provide general information from your case, such as informing you of 

certain deadlines or if a decision whether order has been issued.  

4 

   

 

•  Fill out or correct any forms for you. 

•  Predict how or when a judge may decide any issue. 

•  Interpret the meaning of any judicial order. 

•  Calculate response times or certain deadlines.  

•  Let you speak to a judge outside of a court hearing.  

•  Give you free copies of documents from your case. 

•  Conduct legal research for you. 

 

 

RESPONSIBILITIES OF SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANTS 

As a self-represented litigant, you have certain responsibilities and take on certain risks. 

In  particular,  you  must  ensure  that  you  conduct  your  case  and  present  your  filings  in 

compliance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (“Fed. R. Civ. P.” or “the Rules”) 

and the Local Rules for the District of Maine (“D. Me. Loc. R.” or “the Local Rules”). In 

addition,  you  should  familiarize  yourself  with  the  Federal  Rules  of  Evidence  (“Fed.  R. 

Evid.” or “the Rules of Evidence”) and any substantive law that governs the merits of your 

civil  action.  The  fact  that  you  do  not  have  an  attorney  does  not  relieve  you  of  these 

responsibilities.  

The following list of responsibilities is not intended to be exhaustive, and only provides 

a few examples of the manner in which self-represented litigants are expected to conduct 

themselves when pursuing an action in this Court:  

.  You are required to diligently prosecute your lawsuit. Unless and until you obtain 

an attorney to represent you, it is your responsibility to do everything necessary to 

prepare  your  case  for  trial.  This  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  responding  to 

discovery  requests  and  motions.  If  the  case  goes  to  trial,  it  will  also  be  your 

responsibility to present your case in court.  

  1

 

2.  Do not expect any correspondence or orders from the Court instructing you about 

how to pursue your lawsuit. If you fail to follow established procedures and orders 

issued by the Court, your case may be subject to dismissal.  

3.  You  must  file  all  pleadings  with  the  Court  and  all  pleadings  must  contain  your 

signature  on  the  last  page  as  provided  in  Rule  5  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil 

Procedure  (Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  5),  you  are  required  to  serve  the  opposing  parties’ 

attorney (or the opposing party themself, if they are self-represented) with copies of 

5 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

all  pleadings  and  motions  filed  with  the  Court.  Likewise,  each  opposing  party  is 

required to serve you with copies of all pleadings they file with the Court. 

4.  Each  pleading  must  contain  the  case  caption,  docket  number,  and  title  of  the 

document.  

5.  Documents filed with the Court are publicly available. As provided in Rule 5.2 of 

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2), you must take special 

care  not  to  disclose  in  your  filings  anyone’s  social  security  number,  taxpayer-

identification number, birth date, the full name of a minor, or a financial account 

number. All such references must be “redacted.”  This means that before you file 

the document with the Court you must make sure that the document contains only 

the last four digits of the Social Security or taxpayer number, only the year of the 

individual’s  birth,  only  the  minor’s  initials  and  only  the  last  four  digits  of  the 

financial  account  number.  The  person  filing  the  document  is  responsible  for 

making  these  redactions.  Rule  5.2  protects  an  individual’s  privacy  because  all 

filings submitted to the Court, whether in electronic or in paper format, will appear 

on the docket and be publicly available.  

6.  You must keep the Court and the all other involved parties advised of any change 

of your address or telephone number. This is done by providing a Notice of Change 

of Address in writing. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, 

which could include the dismissal of your case.   

7.  You  should  retain  for  your  records  a  copy  of  every  document  you  submit  to  the 

Court. You may obtain copies from the Clerk’s Office for a fee. The Clerk’s Office  

may not provide you with copies free of charge.

WHERE TO FIND LEGAL ADVICE 

If you decide that you do not wish to represent yourself but do not know of a lawyer 

who  can  assist  you,  you  should  consult  the  Yellow  Pages  of  your  telephone  directory, 

search  out  a  federally-licensed  attorney  on  the  Internet,  or  call  the  Maine  State  Bar 

Association Lawyer Referral Service (1-800-860-1460). If your income qualifies, you may 

be eligible for free or low-cost legal assistance from an office of Pine Tree Legal Assistance 

(1-800-442-4293) or from the Volunteer Lawyers Project of Maine (207-774-4348). If you 

are over 60 years old, you may be eligible for legal assistance from an office of the Legal 

Services for the Elderly (1-800-750-5353). Some attorneys and law firms also provide “pro 

bono” (free) legal services to persons unable to afford their services. The Court does not 

maintain a list of such attorneys, but you are free to inquire of law firms on your own behalf 

as to if they provide pro bono services.  

 

WHAT IS A FEDERAL CASE? 

The United States  District Court for the  District of Maine is a federal court with 

limited jurisdiction. This means that the Court only has jurisdiction, or legal authority, to 

hear certain types of cases. This makes it unlike the State of Maine “District and “Superior” 

Courts, which have jurisdiction over most legal disputes arising in Maine.  

Cases that may be filed with the United States District Court by private individuals 

include: 

•  Civil cases with at least one claim that arises under the United States Constitution 

and/or federal law. If this is the only basis for jurisdiction, then related state law 

claims, if any, may be included in the case but they must arise out of the same group 

of facts as the federal claim(s) in the case.  

•  Civil cases brought against the United States of America and its agencies, and civil 

cases against federal officers or employees based on acts undertaken in the scope of 

their federal duties, even if the claim or claims in the case arise under state law. 

7 

 
 

 

 

 

•  Civil cases that arise under state law but are between persons who reside in different 

states,  provided  that  the  amount  in  controversy  exceeds  $75,000,  so-called 

“diversity of citizenship” cases.  

•  Cases based on the United States District Court’s admiralty (maritime) jurisdiction. 

If your case does not fall under any of these categories, the United States District Court 

may not be the appropriate court.  

Cases that should not be filed with the Unites States District Court:    

•  Cases between persons who live in Maine involving only state law claims.  

•  Cases  arising  out  of  domestic  relations,  which  include  divorce,  protection  from 

abuse,  and  parental  rights  and  responsibilities.  However,  cases  arising  under  the 

Hague Convention on Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction may be filed 

in the United States District Court.  

•  Cases  by  prisoners  who  seek  relief  based  exclusively  on  state  law,  rules,  and/or 

regulations, that do not allege a violation of the United States Constitution or federal 

law. 

It is your burden to demonstrate that your case belongs in federal court.  If your case 

does  not  belong  in  the  United  States  District  Court,  it  does  not  mean  you  are  without 

recourse. You may be able to file your case in state court.  

HOW TO FILE A CIVIL ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT 

“A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.”  See Fed. R. 

Civ. P. 3. In addition, you must complete certain forms. The following paragraphs explain 

the  components  of  a  Complaint  and  identify  the  administrative  documents  the  Clerk’s 

Office will require you to file to open a new case. (Underlined documents are available as 

downloadable forms on the Court’s website under the “Self-Representation” tab or upon 

request in paper format.) 

 

8 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

1. Complaint. The “Complaint” is the document that the plaintiff needs to file with 

the Court to initiate a lawsuit. You may write your own Complaint or use the complaint 

form provided by the Court.  

A Complaint does not need to be typewritten but must be legible if handwritten. It 

must be submitted on 8 ½″ x 11″ paper. The Complaint should contain:   

a.  A caption or heading specifying the court in which it is being filed. 

All  plaintiffs  and  defendants  must  be  listed  in  the  caption  of  the 

Complaint.  

b.  A title, i.e. ― Complaint. 

c.  The name and address of each plaintiff and defendant.  

d.  One or more paragraphs explaining why this Court has jurisdiction, or 

legal authority, to decide the case.  

e.  Separate  numbered  paragraph(s)  that  set  forth  a  short  and  plain 

statement of the facts that give rise to the complaint and state the nature 

of  the  claim  or  claims  being  advanced.  The  statement  of  facts  should 

include a description of what the defendant(s) did or failed to do and how 

those  acts  or  omissions  caused  injury  or  damage  to  you,  as  well  as  a 

description of any injury sustained by you and what medical treatment, if 

any, was required. If you fail to provide the facts that demonstrate how 

each  defendant  was  personally  involved  in  and/or  responsible  for  the 

alleged  incident  or  harm  to  you,  it    may  result  in  dismissal  of  that 

defendant or the entire case.  

f.  The  date,  with  your  original  signature,  followed  by  your  complete 

mailing  address  and  telephone  number.  You  should  exercise  care  to 

assure that all statements you have give are true and accurate. 

g.  Jury Demand. When filing a Complaint (or an Answer) you should 

consider whether you  want a jury to  decide  your case. If a jury trial is 

desired, a jury demand must be requested and included in the title of the 

Complaint  or  Answer  (you  do  not  need  to  file  a  separate  document 

9 

 
 

 

 

 

demanding a jury trial). If you fail to demand a jury trial you will waive 

your  right  to  a  jury  trial.  In  some  types  of  cases,  such  as  tort  actions 

against the United States, jury trials are not available. 

h.  Rule  11  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  prohibits  filing 

lawsuits that are clearly frivolous or filed with the intent to harass another 

individual. If, after reviewing your Complaint, the Court determines that 

you have filed a lawsuit for an improper or clearly unnecessary purpose, 

it  may  impose  sanctions  against  you.  Those  sanctions  may  include 

ordering you to pay a fine or pay the legal fees of the person or persons 

against whom you filed the lawsuit. 

ote: The initial complaint and accompanying case opening documents must be filed 
with the Court in paper form. Electronic case filing is only available to self-represented 
parties after the complaint has been received.  
 

2. Civil Cover Sheet JS-44. You need to complete this form when you file your 

Complaint with the Court. 

3. Filing Fee or Application to Proceed Without the Prepayment of Fees and 

Costs. Cash, a credit card, money order, cashier’s check, or personal check, (made payable 

to “Clerk, USDC”) are acceptable forms of payment,   

If you are unable to afford the filing fee and service costs, you may ask the Court to 

waive those fees and costs. To do so, you must file an Application for Leave to Proceed in 

District  Court  Without  Prepayment  of  Fees  or  Costs.  The  Application  incorporates  an 

affidavit. An affidavit is a document that you complete and sign under penalty of perjury 

declaring that the information provided is true and accurate. The application must be fully 

completed,  typewritten  or  legibly  handwritten  and  include  your  original  signature.  The 

application to proceed without payment of the filing fee will be docketed in your electronic 

case file, meaning that it will be accessible to members of the public. 

 

10

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? 

After the plaintiff completes and files the Complaint and supporting documentation 

a case manager or other Clerk’s Office staff will: 

1.  File stamp the documents. (The file stamp shows the date and time of filing.) 

2.  Assign a case number and judges (both a district judge and a magistrate judge). 

The case number (for example, 1:22-cv-00123-JAW) is broken down into five 

parts: Bangor (1) or Portland (2); the year the case was filed (here, 22); “cv” 

for  civil  case;  the  sequence  of  case  (here,  “00123”);  and  the  initials  of  the 

District Judge to whom the case is assigned (here, “JAW”).  

3.  Provide  Notice  of  Lawsuit  and  Request  for  Waiver  Service  and  Waiver  of 

Service of Summons forms, or if requested, signed Summons forms. 

 

4.  Write a receipt for the filing fee. 

If the plaintiff is asking that the filing fee be waived, then steps 3 and 4 will not take 

place.  Instead,  a  judge  will  first  conduct  an  initial  review  to  decide  whether  (a)  the 

application to proceed without prepayment of the filing fees and costs should be granted 

and (b) the complaint is subject to dismissal for asserting “frivolous and malicious” claims 

or  for  failure  to  state  a  claim  on  which  relief  may  be  granted.  See  28  U.S.C.  § 

1915(e)(2)(B). 

If the Court grants the application and determines that the complaint states a claim 

against one or more defendants, then the Court will issue an order for service instructing 

the  Clerk’s  Office  to  prepare  the  necessary  paperwork  to  serve  the  defendant(s)  on  the 

plaintiff’s behalf. For purposes of service, it is the plaintiff’s responsibility to provide the 

Court with the address(es) where the defendant(s) can be served.  

11 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If the Court denies the application to proceed without prepayment, the Court will 

issue  an order explaining why. At this point, the case may be dismissed if the plaintiff does 

not pay the filing fee by the date ordered. If a plaintiff is required to pay the filing fee, then 

the plaintiff must make their own arrangements to serve the defendant(s). 

SERVING A COMPLAINT 

As provided in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d), a plaintiff will ordinarily request 

that the defendant waive formal service (that is, the formal delivery of the Complaint or 

other papers to the defendant, officially notifying the defendant of the action). Generally, 

a  plaintiff  will  send  the  defendant  a  copy  of  the  Complaint  together  with  a  Notice  of 

Lawsuit  and  Request  for  Waiver  Service  and  Waiver  of  the  Service  of  Summons. 

Typically, the defendant will sign the waiver of service and return it to the plaintiff who 

then must file it with the Court. The action will then proceed as if service of a summons 

and Complaint has been made.  

If the defendant does not waive service, the plaintiff must complete a Summons, 

present it to a Clerk’s Office staff member to sign and seal, and then have it served upon 

the defendant in accordance with Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Procedure.  

For more information on service of process in a civil case. See Appendix A, Guidance 

Concerning Service of Process. 

  

HOW TO RESPOND TO AN ACTION FILED AGAINST YOU 

The defendant in a lawsuit is the person against whom relief or recovery is sought 

in a Complaint. Like the plaintiff, an individual defendant may be self-represented. If you 

are a self-represented defendant, keep in mind that you should seriously consider obtaining 

professional legal assistance.  

The first step in representing yourself as a defendant is to respond to the Complaint 

by filing a Motion or an Answer. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12. An Answer is a formal written 

statement responding to the Complaint setting forth the grounds for a defense. The Rules 

set a deadline for a defendant to answer or respond to a Complaint. Typically, a defendant 

must  file  an  Answer  or  responsive  motion  within  21  days  after  being  served  with  the 
12 

 
 

 

 

 
 
summons and Complaint. If a defendant receives a request to waive service, and s/he elects 

 

 

to waive formal service s/he must return the form to the plaintiff within 30 days of the date 

the Notice of Lawsuit and Request for Waiver was mailed to the defendant. If the defendant 

signs the “Waiver of Service,” s/he is allowed 60 days from the date the plaintiff mailed 

the waiver to respond to the Complaint. The United States government, its agencies, and 

employees have 60 days from the date of service to respond to a Complaint. 

The  defendant’s  “Answer”  or  responsive  motion  must  be  filed  with  the  Clerk’s 

Office and shall include the case caption that appears on the Complaint. The Answer should 

state any defenses that may exist to the plaintiff’s claims and admit or deny each of the 

allegations in the Complaint. The defendant may request a jury trial, and the request may 

be made within the Answer. The defendant also must mail a copy of the Motion or Answer 

to the plaintiff(s).  

A form Answer and a form Answer with Counterclaim or Crossclaim are available 

as downloadable forms on the Court’s website under the “Self-Representation” tab or upon 

request in paper format. Use the form Answer if you do not have or do not intend to file a 

claim  for  relief  against  the  plaintiff.  Use  the  form  “Answer  with  Counterclaim  or 

Crossclaim” if you intend to answer the Complaint against you and you also want to assert 

your own claim or claims against the plaintiff (claims asserted by a defendant against a 

plaintiff are called “counterclaims”) or against another defendant (called a “crossclaim”). 

If you have a counterclaim, you must file a counterclaim or else you will lose the right to 

assert your claim(s) at a later date. See Rule 13 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  

The defendant must mail a copy of every document that s/he files with the Court to 

the  plaintiff’s  attorney  or  the  plaintiff  (if  the  plaintiff  is  self-represented)  and  to  any 

additional parties involved in the case. The defendant must attach a Certificate of Service 

to these documents. Just as the defendant is required to respond to the plaintiff’s Complaint, 

the  plaintiff  or  crossclaim  defendant  is  also  required  to  respond  to  any  counterclaim  or 

crossclaim filed by the defendant. See Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for 

the required deadlines for these responses.  

 

13 

 

 

Whether  you  are  a  defendant  served  with  a  Complaint,  a  plaintiff  served  with  a 

counterclaim, or a defendant served with a crossclaim, do not delay in filing your response. 

When a party does not file a timely Answer or other response with the Court, the opposing 

party  may  ask  the  Clerk  of  Court  to  enter  a  default  which  may  result  in  the  entry  of  a 

judgment by the Court against the party who failed to answer or otherwise respond. 

 

 

REQUIREMENT TO FILE A DIVERSITY DISCLOSURE STATEMENT 

Diversity of citizenship is when parties on opposing sides of a lawsuit are citizens 

of different states.  

All parties in diversity cases must identify their citizenship by filing a disclosure 

statement with their first appearance in a case. If your citizenship information changes at 

any point during the pendency of your case, you must file a supplemental disclosure 

statement updating your citizenship information with the court. See Rule 7.1(a)(2) of the 

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rule 7.1(a)(2). 

A form Diversity Disclosure Statement is available as a downloadable form on the 

Court’s website under the “Self-Representation” tab or upon request in paper format.  

CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE 

A  Certificate  of  Service  is  a  statement  identifying  who  was  served,  at  what 

address(es), when they were served and the method of service. A certificate of service is 

proof  that  copies  of  documents  for  filing  have  been  sent  to  the  opposing  party  or  the 

opposing party’s attorney.  

Note: A certificate of service is only required for service of documents on parties 

who do not receive filings electronically via the Court’s electronic case filing system (ECF) 

or when serving sealed documents on all parties. A certificate of service is not applicable 

to the filing of the Complaint. Service of the Complaint is a separate process entirely. For 

more  information  regarding  service  of  the  Complaint.  See  Appendix  A,  Guidance 

Concerning Service of Process. Certificates of service apply to documents filed with the 

14 

 
 

 

   

 

 
 
Court after service of the Complaint has been made on the defendant(s). See Federal Rule 

 

 

of Civil Procedure 5 for more information regarding service of documents filed with the 

Court.  

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

Service of Public Documents versus Service of Sealed Documents 

Whenever a public (non-sealed) document is filed using the Court’s electronic case 

filing  system  (ECF),  the  ECF  system,  will  automatically  generate  and  send  a  Notice  of 

Electronic Filing (NEF) to all participants in the case who are registered for electronic case 

filing. All ECF registered participants will be able to click on a link contained in the NEF 

to view the actual  PDF document(s) that have been filed. In this instance, service is being 

made  electronically  via  the  Court’s  ECF  system.  Any  case  participants  who  are  not 

registered for the Court’s ECF system will need to be served another way.  

Whenever  a  sealed  document  is  filed,  the  Court’s  electronic  case  filing  system 

(ECF),  will  automatically  generate  and  send  a  Notice  of  Electronic  Filing  (NEF)  to  all 

participants  in  the  case  who  are  registered  for  electronic  filing.  The  NEF  will  alert 

participants that a sealed filing has been made but participants will not be able to view the 

actual sealed  PDF document(s) that has been filed. Service of sealed documents will need 

to be made by another way.  

AMENDING PLEADINGS 

After a party files a pleading consisting of a Complaint, Answer, counterclaim or 

crossclaim, there is an opportunity to amend the pleading. See Rule 15 of the Federal Rules 

of Civil Procedure and the scheduling order issued in your case willprovide you with more 

information.  

ELECTRONIC FILING 

You  must  have  a  case  pending  to  register  for  electronic  filing.  Self-represented 

plaintiffs must file their initial pleadings (Complaint and Civil Cover Sheet, together with 

the Filing Fee or Application to Proceed Without the Prepayment of Fees and Costs) with 
15 

 
 
the Court in paper form. You may register for electronic filing by submitting a completed 

 

 

ECF Registration Form along with your initial pleadings or at any point thereafter. Persons 

interested in electronic filing should refer to Appendix B, Guidance for Electronic Filing 

in the District of Maine. 

 

SCHEDULING ORDERS 

After all of the defendants have entered their appearances, either by filing an Answer 

or  a  Motion,  the  Court  will  issue  a  Scheduling  Order.  If  a  defendant  files  a  Motion  to 

Dismiss  the  Complaint,  the  Court  will  ordinarily  decide  that  motion  before  issuing  a 

scheduling order. The Scheduling Order will set deadlines for completing different stages 

of the case. The Scheduling Order will also ordinarily specify deadlines for amending the 

pleadings, conducting discovery, and being ready for trial.  

If you are concerned about your ability to comply with deadlines contained in the 

Scheduling Order, you should consult with the other parties (if they are represented, you 

will need to consult with their attorney) to see if they will agree to a modification of the 

schedule.  If  they  all  agree,  you  should  file  a  motion  requesting  a  modification  of  the 

schedule indicating to the Court that the parties are in agreement. Make sure to specify the 

new  deadlines  or  other  modifications  you  are  requesting.  If  one  of  the  parties  does  not 

agree, you should indicate that in your motion requesting a modification of the schedule. 

A Motion is a written request filed by any party in the case who wants to ask the 

Court for an order directing some sort of action in the case.

CONDUCTING DISCOVERY 

Discovery is the process of obtaining case-related information from the opposing 

party or from non-party witnesses. Discovery is allowable in most civil cases but not in 

Social Security appeals. The process of discovery is governed by Rules 26 through 37 of 

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as well as Local Rule 26. The Scheduling Order will 

contain a deadline for the completion of discovery. There are many different ways to obtain 

discovery. The most common ways include: 

•  Interrogatories (written questions to the opposing party). 

•  Requests for production of documents from the opposing party. 

•  Requests for admissions from the opposing party. 

•  Depositions (a recorded questioning of a party or a potential witness under 

oath). 

•  Requests to examine a person or premises or personal property if the claims 

in the case make such a request appropriate. 

If your case involves discovery, here are some things you should know: 

•  The discovery process takes place between and among the parties. A litigant 

should not provide the Court with copies of discovery requests or responses 

unless an issue arises and the Court requests the materials. 

•  You  should  send  the  opposing  party  or  parties  discovery  requests  promptly 

after the Court issues the Scheduling Order, so the party to whom the discovery 

is  directed  has  sufficient  time  to  answer  or  object  before  the  discovery 

deadline. 

•  You should respond to any discovery requests you receive. A party who does 

not respond to a discovery request may be subject to sanctions. 

•  If  you  object  to  a  discovery  request  made  of  you,  you  should  express  your 

objection in your response to preserve your objection. A party with a discovery 

dispute  must  first  confer  with  the  opposing  party  in  a  good  faith  effort  to 

17 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

resolve  the  issue  in  dispute  by  agreement.  If  that  good  faith  effort  is 

unsuccessful, the moving party (either the party seeking to compel production 

of discovery or the party seeking protection from a discovery request) must file 

a Request for Hearing re Discovery Dispute using the Court’s form seeking a 

prompt hearing with a judicial officer by telephone or in person.  

 

 

There are limits to how much discovery you may request from an opposing party 

and how much discovery may be requested of you. You will need to review the discovery 

section of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Scheduling Order to determine the 

appropriate  scope  of  your  discovery  requests  and  responses.  The  discovery  rules  also 

impose affirmative responsibilities on the parties to disclose certain information without 

being asked for it. Again, you must consult the Rules and you may also need to consult 

related  case  law  to  understand  your  discovery  responsibilities.  Failure  to  comply  with 

disclosure  or  discovery  requirements  during  the  discovery  process  may  expose  you  to 

sanctions, including a sanction that precludes you from using non-disclosed evidence or 

exhibits at a later hearing or trial.  

  

If you believe your case also requires someone other than your opponent to provide 

testimony or produce documents or tangible things, you should also review Rules 34(c) 

and  45  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  and  any  related  law,  to  understand  the 

process for obtaining discovery from third parties. 

 

In the event you and another party to the case cannot agree about disclosures and 

discovery,  you  may  ask  the  Court  to  resolve  the  dispute.  Sometimes  the  party  seeking 

discovery will want to ask the Court to order the other party to produce something that has 

been withheld in discovery. Sometimes the party seeking to withhold something sought by 

the other party will want to ask the Court to issue a protective order relieving the party of 

their responsiblity  obligation to respond. In either case, the parties  must confer in  good 

faith to attempt to resolve their dispute before seeking relief from the Court. If the parties 

cannot resolve their dispute, then typically a magistrate judge will preside over an informal 

telephonic  discovery  conference  to  resolve  the  dispute.  A  party  must  use  this  informal 

18 

 
 

 

 
 
process  initially,  and  must  not  file  a  motion  seeking  discovery-related  relief.  See  Local 

 

 

Rule 7(a). If the presiding Judge concludes that the dispute cannot be resolved through an 

informal discovery conference, the Judge may order that the matter proceed through formal 

motion practice.  

HEARINGS AND TRIALS 

A  “hearing”  is  a  formal  proceeding  in  which  the  parties  are  heard  by  a  judge 

concerning the facts and law that apply to an important issue in the case. A hearing may be 

limited  to  oral  argument  concerning  the  facts  and  law  presented  in  motion  papers,  or  a 

hearing  may  be  a  proceeding  at  which  the  parties  introduce  witness  testimony  and 

documents for the judge’s consideration.  

The  most  common  pretrial  hearing  in  a  civil  case  is  a  hearing  on  a  Motion  for 

Summary  Judgment.  In  this  District,  a  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  is  governed  by 

special rules that require the parties to present the facts in support of their case through 

paper  filings  called  statements  of  material  facts,  along  with  supporting  documents  like 

affidavits and exhibits. These requirements are outlined in Local Rule 56. Typically, if the 

parties request a hearing on a Motion for Summary Judgment, the Court will hold a hearing 

to allow the parties to present oral argument in support of or in opposition to a Motion for 

Summary Judgment, but not to present evidence. If the parties do not request a hearing, 

and  if  the  judge  determines  that  a  hearing  is  not  necessary,  a  Motion  for  Summary 

Judgment may be decided soley based on the paper record.  

 

A “trial” is the most formal kind of hearing. Trials may be a “jury trial”, meaning a 

jury will resolve any factual disputes between the parties, or a “bench trial,” meaning the 

judge will resolve any factual disputes. A trial typically begins with the parties providing 

their opening statements. Thereafter, the parties are required to present the case by calling 

witnesses to the stand, asking them questions, and presenting  them  with exhibits so the 

exhibits can be introduced and admitted for the judge and/or jury to review. A trial may 

involve only a single witness or it may involve many witnesses. The plaintiff will proceed 

first, followed by the defendant. Sometimes the plaintiff will reserve the opportunity to call 

19 

 

 

 

 

 
 
one  or  more  rebuttal  witnesses  in  response  to  the  defendant’s  presentation.  If  the  case 

 

 

involves a bench trial, then after the parties have completed their presentations the judge 

will provide an opportunity for each side to give a closing argument and will either make 

a ruling in open court or may instead take the matter under advisement and issue a written 

decision.  If  the  case  involves  a  jury  trial,  then  after  the  parties  have  completed  their 

presentations the judge will instruct the jury on the law, after which the parties will give 

their closing arguments to the jury, and the jury will then deliberate in private to reach its 

verdict.  

 

Many different issues can arise in the context of a trial. Some issues are addressed 

before the start of a trial, such as the selection of the jury in a jury trial, the exchange of 

witness  and  exhibit  lists,  and  the  potential  resolution  of  evidentiary  disputes  through 

“Motions in Limine.”  Other issues may arise during a trial, such as issues over the proper 

examination of witnesses, evidentiary objections, and motions for judgment as a matter of 

law.  Still  more  issues  can  arise  at  the  conclusion  of  the  trial  process,  such  as  post-trial 

motions,  bills  of  costs,  and  the  filing  of  appeals  after  the  entry  of  judgment.  Except  as 

outlined  below,  these  issues  are  beyond  the  scope  of  this  Handout.  Thus,  you  should 

consider carefully what the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the District of Maine Local 

Rules, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, and any applicable law may require of 

you so that you do not accidently waive any of your rights during or after trial.  

POST-JUDGMENT PROCEEDINGS 

  Once all issues in the case have been determined, the Clerk’s Office will enter the 

Court’s “Judgment” in accordance with Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures. 

At this time the case in the District Court will be closed and the prevailing parties may 

pursue their costs, while parties dissatisfied with the resolution of the case may pursue an 

appeal.  

The party that ultimately  wins a lawsuit may be awarded certain costs of litigation. 

These costs are assessed by the Clerk of Court and must be paid by the losing party. If the 

BILL OF COSTS 

20 

 

 

 
 
plaintiff  wins  the  case,  a  Bill  of  Costs  form  may  be  completed  and  filed  against  the 

 

 

defendant(s). However, if the plaintiff loses, the defendant(s) may complete and file a Bill 

of Costs form against the plaintiff. These costs, which are explained more fully at 28 U.S.C. 

§ 1920 and Local Rule 54.3, include expenses such as deposition(s), printing, witness fees, 

and other costs. Even if the plaintiff was initially granted leave to file their case without 

the prepayment of fees and costs, costs may be assessed against the plaintiff if the defendant 

prevails. To obtain more information, review the District of Maine’s Guidelines for Filing 

Bills of Costs. 

 

APPEAL 

If  you  intend  to  appeal  the  decision  or  verdict  of  the  judge  or  jury,  you  should 

carefully review the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure (Fed. R. App. P.). There is a 

deadline for filing a “Notice of Appeal.”   See Fed. R. App. P. 4.  

If a party believes a jury verdict or decision rendered by the Court was incorrect, 

and they file an appeal, the appeal will be decided by the United States Court of Appeals 

for the First Circuit in Boston, Massachusetts. An appeal of a decision is commenced by 

completing  and  filing  a  Notice  of  Appeal  form  with  this  Court.  The  Notice  of  Appeal 

should contain a description of the party or parties filing the appeal, a description of the 

judgment or order or the part of the order that you wish to dispute. If more than one party 

wishes to appeal the decision or verdict, each party must file a separate Notice of Appeal.  

There is a fee for filing a Notice of Appeal unless the person filing the appeal has 

already been granted leave to proceed without prepayment of fees and costs. A party who 

has  previously  been  granted  such  leave  need  not  file  a  new  motion  to  proceed  without 

prepayment on appeal, unless the District Court certifies that the appeal was not taken in 

good faith,  See Fed. R. App. P. 24(a)(3).  

 

Several forms are referenced in this Handout. In addition to the forms provided by the 

District of Maine, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has created a number of 

FORMS  

21 

 

 
 
forms,  including  some  specialized  forms  for  certain  types  of  cases.  The  Administrative 

 

 

Office’s forms can be found at http://www.uscourts.gov/forms/pro-se-forms  

When using forms, keep in mind the following: 

1.  Not Legal Advice. No form provides legal advice. No form substitutes for having 

or consulting a lawyer. If you are not a lawyer and are suing or have been sued, it is 

best to have or consult a lawyer if possible. 

2.  No  Guarantee.  Using  a  form  as  a  guide  does  not  guarantee  that  any  pleading  is 

legally or factually correct or sufficient. 

3.  No More Than a Template. Forms offer a template for you to use to file documents 

in the format that lawyers and judges are accustomed to using. However, the core 

content will have to come from you, as the forms do not provide examples of, for 

example, how to set forth the elements of a legal claim in a Complaint, or how to 

brief the merits of an issue in a motion or respond to a motion. To create this content, 

you will need to set forth the facts and the law and explain why they lead to the 

relief you are requesting.  

4.  No  Guidance  on  Timing  or  Parties.  The  forms  do  not  give  any  guidance  on 

important issues like deadlines or which parties should be included. For example, a 

form Complaint will not advise you of any applicable statute of limitation or any 

process  you  may  need  to  go  through  before  filing  a  Complaint,  such  as  in  an 

administrative forum. Nor will a form Complaint advise you about who is the proper 

defendant to assert a particular claim against, if the law requires a particular choice.  

5.  Privacy  Requirements.  Remember  that  Rule  5.2  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil 

Procedure requires that every participant in a case that files a document with the 

Court,  has  to  protect  the  privacy  and  security  concerns  of  themselves  and  others 

when filing documents that will be accessible on the public docket. Under this Rule, 

documents filed with the Court should not contain any person’s full social-security 

number or full birth date; the name of a person known to be a minor; or a complete 

financial-account number. A filing may include only the last four digits of a social-

 

22 

 

 

security number and taxpayer identification number; the year of someone’s  birth; a 

minor’s initials; and the last four digits of a financial-account number.

March 2022 

 

 

This  information  is  intended  as  an  informative  and  practical  resource.  It 
cannot take the place of an attorney’s legal advice, nor will it answer all of 
your questions about what you need to do to serve a defendant or crossclaim 
defendant with process.  

 

 

   

       

24 

 
 

   

 

 

 

 
 
All parties facing legal action against them must be notified.  
  
“Service of process” involves serving the defendant(s) with a copy of the 
complaint and is the procedure that officially notifies the defendant(s) 
that a lawsuit has been filed. 
  
This section will explain:  
  

  How to notify the defendant(s) that a lawsuit has been filed.  
  When the court will assist with service. 

•  Is there a time limit for serving the complaint?   

  
Yes. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4 establishes a time limit of 90 days 
following the filing of the complaint with the court for service to be made 
on the defendant(s). See Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for 
more information.  
   
If you do not meet this deadline, the court may dismiss all claims against 
any party who has not been timely served. 
  
  

•  Who is responsible for serving the complaint? Will the court 

assist me with making service?  

If… 

Then… 

You applied for leave to 
proceed without prepaying 
the filing fee and your 
application was granted 

The Clerk’s Office will arrange for 
service of the complaint on the 
defendant(s). However, service may 
not be carried out right away 
because complaints filed by persons 
proceeding without prepayment of 
the filing fee are subject to a 
mandatory screening process 
(pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 
1915(e)(2)), and that process can 
delay service. Service will not 
proceed until the judge issues an 
Order for Service.

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for 
more information regarding service. 
  

•  I paid the filing fee and am therefore responsible for service. 

How do I go about serving the defendant(s)?  
  

A Summons is a form prepared by the plaintiff(s) and issued by the court 
that informs a defendant(s) that he/she is being sued and has a certain 
number of days to respond to the complaint. There are specific rules that 
must be followed as to who may serve a summons.  
  
You may be able to serve the defendant(s) by waiver of service, but only if 
the defendant(s) agree.  
  
It is critical that service of the complaint be made exactly the way the law 
requires. If the complaint is not served properly on the opposing party, it 
could be subject to dismissal by the court.  
  
The below sections will explain how to request the defendant(s) to waive 
service and how to get a summons issued by the court.  
  
  

WAIVER OF SERVICE 
  
 

•  What is a waiver of service?  

   
A waiver of service of summons means that a party voluntarily enters a 
lawsuit without requiring the opposing party to officially serve them with 
a summons. Waiving service means agreeing to give up the right to 
service in person and instead accepting service by mail.   

•  What are the benefits to waiving service?   

   
One benefit to the plaintiff(s) is avoiding the cost and/or inconvenience of 
having the summons served in person on the defendant(s).  
   
One benefit to the defendant(s) is that they will have more time to answer 
the complaint. When service is made by summons, the answer is due 
within 21 days of service. However, when service is waived, the answer is 

26 

 
 

  
 

  

  

 

 
 
due within 60 days from the date the waiver was sent to the opposing 
party.  

 

 

• 

 May I get the defendant(s) to waive service?   

   
You may ask for a waiver of service from any party except  

•  A minor or incompetent person.  
•  The United States government, its agencies, corporations, officers, 

•  A foreign, state, or local government. See Rule 4 of the Maine Rules 

or employees.  

of Civil Procedure. 
   

•  How do I request that the defendant(s) waive service?   

   
To request waiver of service from the defendant(s), you will need two 
forms, which you can obtain from the Clerk’s Office or download from the 
Court’s website: 
   

•  Notice of Lawsuit and Request to Waive Service of Summons form, 

and  

•  Waiver of Service of Summons form.  

   
To request a waiver of service, complete and send the above-listed two 
forms to the defendant(s) by first-class mail, along with a copy of the 
complaint and supporting documents filed with the court. See Rule 4(d) 
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for more information regarding 
waiver of service. 

  
   
Note:   
   
When completing the Notice of Lawsuit and Request to Waive Service of 
Summons Form, you will need to input on the form a time frame for the 
defendant to return to you the signed waiver form (if he/she elects to 
agree to waive service).  
  
When completing the Waiver of Service of Summons Form, you will need 
to input the date the waiver was sent. This is the date that you place 
your completed request to waive service paperwork in the mail to the 
defendant.  
  

27 

  

   

   

  

 

 

 

•  What do I do if a defendant agrees to waive service and sends 
me back the signed Waiver of Service of Summons Form?   

   
If you receive a signed waiver of service form, you do not need to do 
anything further to serve that defendant. Make a copy for your records 
and file the original waiver of service form with the Court.  

•  What if I requested a waiver of service and the form was not 

sent back?  

   
If a defendant does not return a signed waiver of service form by the due 
date you will need to arrange to serve that defendant by one of the other 
means approved by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  
  
  

SERVICE BY SUMMONS 

•  How do I submit a summons to the Clerk’s Office for Issuance?   

  
In order to serve the complaint, you must first get a Summons “issued” 
by the Clerk’s Office. The Clerk’s Office “issues” the summons by affixing 
the date and seal of the court. The form entitled “Summons in a Civil 
Action” is available in paper form at the Clerk’s Office or electronically on 
the Court’s website here.  
   
Note: Before you may serve the summons, it must be issued by the 
Clerk’s Office. Before submitting the summons to the Clerk’s Office for 
issuance you must prepare the summons by completing the upper 
portion of the form (everything above the date and signature of the Clerk 
lines needs to be completed before the Clerk’s Office will issue the 
summons). If your complaint names more than one defendant, you must 
prepare a separate summons form for each defendant.  
   

If…  

Then…  

You file in paper form (not

The Clerk’s Office will not issue any summons(es) until the filing fee 
has been paid or until an Order for Service has been entered if you 
have been granted leave to proceed without prepayment of fees or 
costs. 
 

•  Who may serve the summons?   

  
See Rule 4(c)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for information 
regarding who may make service of the summons.  

•  What documents do I include with the Summons?   

   
You are required include a copy of your complaint and any supporting 
documents filed with the court.  
  
  

SERVICE ON THE UNITED STATES, ITS 
AGENCIES, OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES 

•  How do I serve the United States, its agencies, officers or 

employees?   

  
Service may be made by Summons sent by certified mail (return receipt 
required). Service needs to be made upon the U.S. Attorney for the 
district where the action is brought; the Attorney General of the United 
States; and the agency, corporation, officer, or employee in accordance 
with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(i).  

 
 

  

     

 

  
  

         

 

  

29 

 

 

•  What documents do I include when making service by certified 

mail upon the United States, its Agencies, Corporations, 
Officers, or Employees?   

   
You are required to serve a copy of a Summons that has been issued by 
the Clerk of Court, along with a copy of your complaint and any 
supporting documents filed with the court.  
  
Note: A separate summons is required for each entity referenced above 
(U.S. Attorney/Attorney General/Agency). 

•  What do I do when I get the certified mail return receipts?   

   
Once you have received the certified mail return receipts showing that 
the summons has been delivered, you must file them with the court as 
proof of service upon the defendant(s).

•  What are the pros and cons of electronic filing (ECF)?  

 

 

•  You may email your documents for filing, rather than going to the 

courthouse or paying for postage to mail your filings.  

•  You have until 11:59 p.m. for your documents to be electronically 
received by the court (as opposed to 4:30 p.m. for physical delivery 
of paper filings to the court). 

•  You will receive immediate email notification of activity and 

documents filed in your case instead of having to wait for paper 
copies to arrive in the mail.  

 
 

  
Pros:  
  

  
 Cons:  
  

•  There are hardware and software requirements associated with 

electronic filing.  

•  You must have an email address.  
•  You must have access to a Computer with Internet Access.  
•  Your computer must have software to convert documents from a 

word processor format to portable document format (PDF).  

  
Note: All documents for filing are to be created with word processing 
software and then converted to PDF format. A scanner is helpful when 
submitting documents for electronic filing. A scanner is ONLY to be used 
for exhibits (documents you did not/cannot electronically prepare 
yourself for electronic conversion to PDF format). 
  

•  Once registered for electronic filing, you will no longer receive paper 

service of documents in the mail. You will be responsible for 
checking your e-mail to check for filings and court orders.  

•  How do I start with electronic filing?  

  
You must have a pending case in order to register for electronic filing.

If you agree to comply with the instructions and conditions outlined in 
the registration form, complete the form and return the completed form 
to the Clerk’s Office for processing.  
  
Note: Once registered, you will not receive a login and password from the 
court. Instead, you email your documents for filing and a member of the 
Clerk’s Office will upload the filings to the docket. See pages 2-3 of the 
ECF Registration Form for Pro Se Filers for more detailed instructions on 
how to file electronically.  

 

•  Once registered, how do I receive electronic filings in my case?  

  
Once you are registered for electronic filing, whenever there is docket 
activity in your case you will receive an email. This email is a called a 
Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF).  
  
The NEF will include the caption of your case and the case number. 
There are different scenarios you will see within the NEF:  
  
Docket entries with a PDF 
document attached 

Docket entries without a 
PDF document attached 

Whenever a PDF document is 
attached to a docket entry the NEF 
will include a hyperlink to the 
document. Each docket entry with a 
PDF document attached is assigned 
a document number.  
  
Certain docket entries do not have a 
PDF document associated with 
them. These are called text-only 
entries. For text-only entries the 
document number will not contain a 
hyperlink. 
  
Certain text-only docket entries 
made by the Clerk’s Office are not 
assigned a document number, such 
as the resetting of deadlines.  
  

  
Note regarding docket entries with PDF documents attached:  You are 
permitted one “free look” at each PDF document by clicking on the 
associated document number embedded within the NEF. Any 

33 

 

   

 

 

 
 
subsequent viewing of the document will be subject to PACER fees. See 
the FAQ Is there a way to look up my case without going to the courthouse 
for more information regarding PACER. There is a time limit associated 
with your one free look. You must view the document within 15 days of 
receipt of the NEF. After 15 days you will lose your one free look. To 
avoid fees, the best practice is to save and/or print the document 
immediately after accessing your one free look.  

 

•  Are there certain documents I will be unable to receive 

electronically?  

  
Yes. Certain docket entries may be restricted or sealed. An NEF will still 
be generated to alert you to the docket activity but will contain language 
that the document is sealed from public view or that access to the 
document is restricted to case participants only. You will not be able to 
retrieve these kinds of filings electronically. You will instead be served in 
paper form.  

•  What if I no longer wish to be an electronic filer?  

  
A termination request must be made in writing. The termination request 
may be filed via email to MaineECFIntake@med.uscourts.gov or may be 
filed in paper form with the Clerk’s Office.

•  What is a motion and how do I make or respond to 
one?  

  
A motion is a written request filed by any party to a lawsuit asking the 
judge for some sort of action in the case. Motions are the primary way to 
ask the court to act in a case.  
  
 Local Rule 7 – Motions and Memoranda of Law – also provides detailed 
information regarding motion practice.  
   
Every motion should include the case caption, the specific action 
requested (what you want the court to do) and the reason for the request. 
Motions must be submitted separately from other filings and contain the 
word “motion” in the title. The motion should incorporate a 
memorandum of law, which is a brief written summary in support of 
your request. If you are arguing a legal matter, you should include 
citations to supporting authorities, such as rules, statutes (laws), or case 
law that supports your position.  
   
There are two types of motions, dispositive and non-dispositive.  
   
Dispositive Motions   A dispositive motion asks to resolve entirely 

Non-Dispositive 
Motions  

one or more claims in the case. The most 
common types of dispositive motions are 
motions to dismiss and motions for 
summary judgment. Dispositive motions 
and responses to dispositive motions are 
limited to 20 pages. Replies to dispositive 
motions are limited to 7 pages.   
   
Non-Dispositive motions are all other 
motions filed during the course of the case. 
Common examples are motions to extend 
time to file documents and motions to 
exceed page limits. Non-Dispositive motions 
and responses to Non-Dispositive motions 
are limited to 10 pages. Replies to Non-
Dispositive motions are limited to 7 pages.  
  

   
Note: You do not need to make a motion for clerical things such as 
changing your address on the docket or requesting copies. Motions can 

36 

 
 

 

 
 
delay resolution of your case and divert the attention of the parties and 
the court from preparing for trial.  

 

 

•  How do I respond or reply to a motion?   

   
The party who files a motion is called the moving party. A party who does 
not want the motion to be granted is called the opposing party. The Local 
Rules establish time frames for the opposing party to respond to a 
motion and for the moving party to file any reply. Like a motion, the 
response must have an attached memorandum of law with citations to 
any supporting authorities, such as rules, statutes (laws), or case law 
that supports your position. See Local Rule 7 – Motions and Memoranda 
of Law for more detailed information regarding motion practice.  
   
Response   
   

When a motion is filed by a moving party the 
opposing party has 21 days from the date 
the motion was filed with the court to file 
any response to the motion. If no response is 
filed within the 21 days, the opposing party 
is deemed to have waived objection.  
   
Once the response is received by the Court, 
the filer of the motion will have 14 days to 
file any reply. The reply is the final filing 
permitted before the motion is submitted to 
the judge for consideration.  

•  What if I need more time to file something?   

  

If you need additional time to file a document, you must file a written 
motion with the court. Requests for more time may not be made verbally 
in person or over the phone. It is important to file your written motion 
before the current due date for the document expires.

If there is a deadline set in my case and I have requested an 
• 
extension, but the motion has not yet been ruled on, what should 
I do?   

  
 If your motion to extend time was received and filed by the court, then 
you are protected from making the filing that is the subject of your 
motion until your motion to extend time is ruled on by the judge.  
  
   

•  How long will it take to get a ruling on my motion?  

   
The Clerk’s Office is unable to predict or advise on when rulings will be 
made by the judge.

•  What are the pros and cons of electronic filing (ECF)?  

•  You can email your documents for filing, rather than going to 
the courthouse or paying for postage to mail your filings.  

•  You have until 11:59 p.m. for your documents to be 

electronically received by the court (as opposed to 4:30 p.m. 
for physical delivery of paper filings to the court). 

•  You will receive immediate email notification of activity and 
documents filed in your case instead of having to wait for 
paper copies to arrive in the mail.  

•  There are hardware and software requirements associated with 

electronic filing.  

•  You must have an email address.  
•  You must have access to a Computer with Internet Access.  
•  Your computer must have software to convert documents from 
a word processor format to portable document format (PDF).  

  
Note: All documents for filing are to be created with word 
processing software and then converted to PDF format.  A scanner 
is helpful when submitting documents for electronic filing. A 
scanner is ONLY to be used for exhibits (documents you did 
not/cannot electronically prepare yourself for electronic conversion 
to PDF format). 
  

•  Once registered for electronic filing, you will no longer receive 

paper service of documents in the mail. You will be responsible 
for checking your e-mail to check for filings and court orders.

•  How do I start with electronic filing?  

  
You must have a pending case in order to register for electronic 
filing.  
  

ECF Registration Form 

  
Carefully review pages 2-3 of the ECF Registration Form for Pro Se 
Filers (see above link), which contains detailed instructions for 
electronic filing and conditions you must agree to abide by.  
  
If you agree to comply with the instructions and conditions outlined 
in the registration form, complete the form and return the 
completed form to the Clerk’s Office for processing.  
  
Note: Once registered, you will not receive a login and password 
from the court. Instead, you email your documents for filing and a 
member of the Clerk’s Office will upload the filings to the docket. 
See pages 2-3 of the ECF Registration Form for Pro Se Filers for 
more detailed instructions on how to file electronically.   
  

•  Once registered, how do I receive electronic filings in my 

case?  

  
Once you are registered for electronic filing, whenever there is 
docket activity in your case you will receive an email. This email is a 
called a Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF).  
  
The NEF will include the caption of your case and the case number. 
There are different scenarios you will see within the NEF:  
  
Docket entries with a 
PDF document attached 

Whenever a PDF document is 
attached to a docket entry the 
NEF will include a hyperlink to 
the document. Each docket entry 
with a PDF document attached is 
assigned a document number.

Guidance for E-Filing in the District of Maine 

Docket entries without a 
PDF document attached 

Certain docket entries do not 
have a PDF document associated 
with them. These are called text-
only entries. For text-only entries 
the document number will not 
contain a hyperlink. 
  
Certain text-only docket entries 
made by the Clerk’s Office are not 
assigned a document number, 
such as the resetting of 
deadlines.  
  

  
Note regarding docket entries with PDF documents attached:  You 
are permitted one “free look” at each PDF document by clicking on 
the associated document number embedded within the NEF. Any 
subsequent viewing of the document will be subject to PACER fees. 
See the FAQ Is there a way to look up my case without going to the 
courthouse for more information regarding PACER. There is a time 
limit associated with your one free look. You must view the 
document within 15 days of receipt of the NEF. After 15 days you 
will lose your one free look. To avoid fees, the best practice is to 
save and/or print the document immediately after accessing your 
one free look. 
   
 

•  Are there certain documents I will be unable to receive 

electronically?  

  
Yes. Certain docket entries may be restricted or sealed. An NEF will 
still be generated to alert you to the docket activity but will contain 
language that the document is sealed from public view or that 
access to the document is restricted to case participants only. You 
will not be able to retrieve these kinds of filings electronically. You 
will instead be served in paper form.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  

DISTRICT OF MAINE 

 

GUIDANCE CONCERNING SERVICE OF PROCESS 
 
Christa K. Berry, Clerk of Court 
 
March 2023 

This  information  is  intended  as  an  informative  and  practical  resource.  It 
cannot take the place of an attorney’s legal advice, nor will it answer all of 
your questions about what you need to do to serve a defendant or crossclaim 
defendant with process.  

 

 

   

Guidance Concerning Service of Process 

 
All parties facing legal action against them must be notified.  
  
“Service of process” involves serving the defendant(s) with a copy of 
the complaint and is the procedure that officially notifies the 
defendant(s) that a lawsuit has been filed. 
  
This section will explain:  
  

  How to notify the defendant(s) that a lawsuit has been filed.  
  When the court will assist with service. 

•  Is there a time limit for serving the complaint?   

  
Yes. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4 establishes a time limit of 90 
days following the filing of the complaint with the court for service 
to be made on the defendant(s). See Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure for more information.   
   
If you do not meet this deadline, the court may dismiss all claims 
against any party who has not been timely served. 
  
  

•  Who is responsible for serving the complaint? Will the 

court assist me with making service?  

If… 
You applied for leave to 
proceed without 
prepaying the filing fee 
and your application was 
granted 

Then… 
The Clerk’s Office will arrange for 
service of the complaint on the 
defendant(s). However, service 
may not be carried out right away 
because complaints filed by 
persons proceeding without 
prepayment of the filing fee are 
subject to a mandatory screening 
process (pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 
1915(e)(2)), and that process can 
delay service.  Service will not 
proceed until the judge issues an 
Order for Service.   

1 

   

  

 

•  I paid the filing fee and am therefore responsible for 
service. How do I go about serving the defendant(s)?  
  

A Summons is a form prepared by the plaintiff(s) and issued by the 
court that informs a defendant(s) that he/she is being sued and has 
a certain number of days to respond to the complaint. There are 
specific rules that must be followed as to who can serve a 
summons.  
  
You may be able to serve the defendant(s) by waiver of service, but 
only if the defendant(s) agree.  
  
It is critical that service of the complaint be made exactly the way 
the law requires. If the complaint is not served properly on the 
opposing party, it could be subject to dismissal by the court.  
  
The below sections will explain how to request the defendant(s) to 
waive service and how to get a summons issued by the court.  
  
  

WAIVER OF SERVICE 

 
•  What is a waiver of service?  

   
A waiver of service of summons means that a party voluntarily 
enters a lawsuit without requiring the opposing party to officially 
serve them with a summons. Waiving service means agreeing to give 
up the right to service in person and instead accepting service by 
mail.    
   

  

2 

You have paid the filing 
fee 

Guidance Concerning Service of Process 

You are responsible for 
coordinating service of the 
complaint on the defendant(s). 
See Rule 4(c) Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure for more 
information regarding service. 
  

 

  
 

 

Guidance Concerning Service of Process 

•  What are the benefits to waiving service?   

   
One benefit to the plaintiff(s) is avoiding the cost and/or 
inconvenience of having the summons served in person on the 
defendant(s).   
   
One benefit to the defendant(s) is that they will have more time to 
answer the complaint. When service is made by summons, the 
answer is due within 21 days of service. However, when service is 
waived, the answer is due within 60 days from the date the waiver 
was sent to the opposing party.   

• 

 Can I get the defendant(s) to waive service?   

   
You can ask for a waiver of service from any party except  

•  A minor or incompetent person.  
•  The United States government, its agencies, corporations, 

•  A foreign, state, or local government. See Rule 4 of the Maine 

officers, or employees.  

Rules of Civil Procedure. 
   

•  How do I request that the defendant(s) waive service?   

   
To request waiver of service from the defendant(s), you will need two 
forms, which you can obtain from the Clerk’s Office or download 
from the Court’s website: 
   

•  Notice of Lawsuit and Request to Waive Service of Summons 

form, and  

•  Waiver of Service of Summons form.   

   
To request a waiver of service, complete and send the above-listed 
two forms to the defendant(s) by first-class mail, along with a copy 
of the complaint and supporting documents filed with the court. See 
Rule 4(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for more 
information regarding waiver of service.   

 

  

   

   

   

 

3 

Guidance Concerning Service of Process 

 
   
Note:   
   
When completing the Notice of Lawsuit and Request to Waive 
Service of Summons Form, you will need to input on the form a 
time frame for the defendant to return to you the signed waiver 
form (if he/she elects to agree to waive service).  
  
When completing the Waiver of Service of Summons Form, you will 
need to input the date the waiver was sent. This is the date that you 
place your completed request to waive service paperwork in the mail 
to the defendant.   
  
   

•  What do I do if a defendant agrees to waive service and 

sends me back the signed Waiver of Service of Summons 
Form?   

   
If you receive a signed waiver of service form, you do not need to do 
anything further to serve that defendant. Make a copy for your 
records and file the original waiver of service form with the Court.   

•  What if I requested a waiver of service and the form was 

not sent back?  

   
If a defendant does not return a signed waiver of service form by the 
due date you will need to arrange to serve that defendant by one of 
the other means approved by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure.   
  
  

SERVICE BY SUMMONS 

•  How do I submit a summons to the Clerk’s Office for 

Issuance?   

  
In order to serve the complaint, you must first get a Summons 
“issued” by the Clerk’s Office. The Clerk’s Office “issues” the 
summons by affixing the date and seal of the court.  The form 

4 

  

   

  
  

 

Guidance Concerning Service of Process 

 
entitled “Summons in a Civil Action” is available in paper form at 
the Clerk’s Office or electronically on the Court’s website here.  
   
Note: Before you can serve the summons, it must be issued by the 
Clerk’s Office. Before submitting the summons to the Clerk’s Office 
for issuance you must prepare the summons by completing the 
upper portion of the form (everything above the date and signature 
of the Clerk lines needs to be completed before the Clerk’s Office 
will issue the summons).  If your complaint names more than one 
defendant, you must prepare a separate summons form for each 
defendant.   
   

If…  

You file in paper form (not 
registered for Electronic 
Case Filing (ECF)  

You are registered for 
Electronic Case Filing (ECF)  

Then…  
Prepared summons(es) can 
be submitted to the court 
for issuance in paper form 
in person or by mail  
Prepared summons(es) can 
be submitted to the court 
for issuance by email to 
newcases.bangor@med.usc
ourts.gov or 
newcases.portland@med.us
courts.gov or may be 
submitted to the court in 
paper form in person or by 
mail  

The Clerk’s Office will not issue any summons(es) until the 
filing fee has been paid or until an Order for Service has been 
entered if you have been granted leave to proceed without 
prepayment of fees or costs. 
 

•  Who can serve the summons?   

  
See Rule 4(c)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  for 
information regarding who can make service of the summons.  

5 

   

  

 

   

 

Guidance Concerning Service of Process 

•  What documents do I include with the Summons?   

   
You are required include a copy of your complaint and any 
supporting documents filed with the court.  
  
  

SERVICE ON THE UNITED STATES, ITS 
AGENCIES, OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES 

•  How do I serve the United States, its agencies, officers or 

employees?   

  
Service can be made by Summons sent by certified mail (return 
receipt required).  Service needs to be made upon the U.S. Attorney 
for the district where the action is brought; the Attorney General of 
the United States; and the agency, corporation, officer, or employee 
in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(i).   
   

•  What documents do I include when making service by 
certified mail upon the United States, its Agencies, 
Corporations, Officers, or Employees?   

   
You are required to serve a copy of a Summons that has been 
issued by the Clerk of Court, along with a copy of your complaint 
and any supporting documents filed with the court.   
  
Note: A separate summons is required for each entity referenced 
above (U.S. Attorney/Attorney General/Agency). 

•  What do I do when I get the certified mail return receipts?   

   
Once you have received the certified mail return receipts showing 
that the summons has been delivered, you must file them with the 
court as proof of service upon the defendant(s).

Duty to Avoid Unnecessary Expenses of Serving a Summons

Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires certain defendants to cooperate in saving unnecessary expenses of serving a summons
and complaint.  A defendant who is located in the United States and who fails to return a signed waiver of service requested by a plaintiff located in
the United States will be required to pay the expenses of service, unless the defendant shows good cause for the failure.

“Good cause” does not include a belief that the lawsuit is groundless, or that it has been brought in an improper venue, or that the court has

no jurisdiction over this matter or over the defendant or the defendant’s property.  

If the waiver is signed and returned, you can still make these and all other defenses and objections, but you cannot object to the absence of

a summons or of service. 

If you waive service, then you must, within the time specified on the waiver form, serve an answer or a motion under Rule 12 on the plaintiff
and file a copy with the court.  By signing and returning the waiver form, you are allowed more time to respond than if a summons had been served.

the United States).

If you do not return the signed waiver within the time indicated, I will arrange to have the summons and complaint

II. 

Basis for Jurisdiction 

Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction (limited power).  Generally, only two 
types of cases can be heard in federal court: cases involving a federal question and cases 
involving diversity of citizenship of the parties.  Under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, a case arising 
under the United States Constitution or federal laws or treaties is a federal question case.  
Under 28 U.S.C. § 1332, a case in which a citizen of one State sues a citizen of another 
State or nation and the amount at stake is more than $75,000 is a diversity of citizenship 
case.  In a diversity of citizenship case, no defendant may be a citizen of the same State 
as any plaintiff.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ATTORNEYS COMPLETING CIVIL COVER SHEET FORM JS 44

Authority For Civil Cover Sheet

The JS 44 civil cover sheet and the information contained herein neither replaces nor supplements the filings and service of pleading or other papers as
required by law, except as provided by local rules of court.  This form, approved by the Judicial Conference of the United States in September 1974, is
required for the use of the Clerk of Court for the purpose of initiating the civil docket sheet.  Consequently, a civil cover sheet is submitted to the Clerk of
Court for each civil complaint filed.  The attorney filing a case should complete the form as follows:

I.(a)  Plaintiffs-Defendants.  Enter names (last, first, middle initial) of plaintiff and defendant.  If the plaintiff or defendant is a government agency, use 

only the full name or standard abbreviations.  If the plaintiff or defendant is an official within a government agency, identify first the agency and 
then the official, giving both name and title.

   (b) County of Residence.  For each civil case filed, except U.S. plaintiff cases, enter the name of the county where the first listed plaintiff resides at the 

time of filing.  In U.S. plaintiff cases, enter the name of the county in which the first listed defendant resides at the time of filing.  (NOTE: In land 
condemnation cases, the county of residence of the ""defendant"" is the location of the tract of land involved.)

   (c) Attorneys.  Enter the firm name, address, telephone number, and attorney of record.  If there are several attorneys, list them on an attachment, noting

in this section ""(see attachment)"".

Jurisdiction.  The basis of jurisdiction is set forth under Rule 8(a), F.R.Cv.P., which requires that jurisdictions be shown in pleadings.  Place an ""X"" 
in one of the boxes.  If there is more than one basis of jurisdiction, precedence is given in the order shown below.
United States plaintiff.  (1) Jurisdiction based on 28 U.S.C. 1345 and 1348.  Suits by agencies and officers of the United States are included here.
United States defendant.  (2) When the plaintiff is suing the United States, its officers or agencies, place an ""X"" in this box.
Federal question.  (3) This refers to suits under 28 U.S.C. 1331, where jurisdiction arises under the Constitution of the United States, an amendment 
to the Constitution, an act of Congress or a treaty of the United States.  In cases where the U.S. is a party, the U.S. plaintiff or defendant code takes 
precedence, and box 1 or 2 should be marked.
Diversity of citizenship.  (4) This refers to suits under 28 U.S.C. 1332, where parties are citizens of different states.  When Box 4 is checked, the 
citizenship of the different parties must be checked.  (See Section III below; NOTE: federal question actions take precedence over diversity 
cases.)

III.   Residence (citizenship) of Principal Parties.  This section of the JS 44 is to be completed if diversity of citizenship was indicated above.  Mark this

section for each principal party.

Nature of Suit.  Place an ""X"" in the appropriate box.  If there are multiple nature of suit codes associated with the case, pick the nature of suit code 
that is most applicable.  Click here for: Nature of Suit Code Descriptions.  

Origin.  Place an ""X"" in one of the seven boxes.
Original Proceedings.  (1) Cases which originate in the United States district courts.
Removed from State Court.  (2) Proceedings initiated in state courts may be removed to the district courts under Title 28 U.S.C., Section 1441.  
When the petition for removal is granted, check this box.
Remanded from Appellate Court.  (3) Check this box for cases remanded to the district court for further action.  Use the date of remand as the filing 
date.
Reinstated or Reopened.  (4) Check this box for cases reinstated or reopened in the district court.  Use the reopening date as the filing date.
Transferred from Another District.  (5) For cases transferred under Title 28 U.S.C. Section 1404(a).  Do not use this for within district transfers or 
multidistrict litigation transfers.
Multidistrict Litigation – Transfer.  (6) Check this box when a multidistrict case is transferred into the district under authority of Title 28 U.S.C. 
Section 1407. 
Multidistrict Litigation – Direct File.  (8) Check this box when a multidistrict case is filed in the same district as the Master MDL docket. 
PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE IS NOT AN ORIGIN CODE 7.  Origin Code 7 was used for historical records and is no longer relevant due to 
changes in statue.

VI. 

Cause of Action.  Report the civil statute directly related to the cause of action and give a brief description of the cause.  Do not cite jurisdictional 
statutes unless diversity.  Example: U.S. Civil Statute: 47 USC 553  Brief Description: Unauthorized reception of cable service

VII.  Requested in Complaint.  Class Action.  Place an ""X"" in this box if you are filing a class action under Rule 23, F.R.Cv.P.

Demand.  In this space enter the actual dollar amount being demanded or indicate other demand, such as a preliminary injunction.
Jury Demand.  Check the appropriate box to indicate whether or not a jury is being demanded.

VIII.  Related Cases.  This section of the JS 44 is used to reference related pending cases, if any.  If there are related pending cases, insert the docket 

numbers and the corresponding judge names for such cases.

Date and Attorney Signature.  Date and sign the civil cover sheet.

Basis for Jurisdiction

Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction (limited power).  Generally, only two types of cases can be
heard in federal court: cases involving a federal question and cases involving diversity of citizenship of the
parties.  Under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, a case arising under the United States Constitution or federal laws or treaties
is a federal question case.  Under 28 U.S.C. § 1332, a case in which a citizen of one State sues a citizen of
another State or nation and the amount at stake is more than $75,000 is a diversity of citizenship case.  In a
diversity of citizenship case, no defendant may be a citizen of the same State as any plaintiff.

This  text  is  not  intended  to  confer  or  create  any  rights,  privileges  or  benefits  to 

prospective  or  actual  parties.    It  is  also  not  intended  to  have  the  force  of  law.    Its  sole 

intention is to provide a general orientation concerning bail bond proceedings at the U.S. 

District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. 

The Clerk's Office is not allowed to give you legal advise, but will try to answer any 

questions about procedure or rules of the Court. 

THE BAIL REFORM ACT OF 1984 

The Bail Reform Act of 1984, as amended (“the Act”), Title 18, United States Code, 

Sections 3141 et seq., governs the release and detention of federal criminal defendants 

before  trial.    The  Act  “establishes  standards  and  procedures  governing  both  the  pretrial 

phase of a case, the period between conviction and sentencing, and the period during the 

pendency  of  an  appeal  by  either  side.    It  prescribes  consecutive  penalties  for  failure  to 

appear and for committing offenses while on release.  It also establishes standards and 

procedures  governing  material  witnesses.”    Weinberg,  Federal  Bail  and  Detention 

Handbook, § 2.03. 

RELEASE AND DETENTION PROCEEDINGS 

 

The  Initial  Appearance  or  Initial  Hearing  is  the  first  court  appearance  where  a 

federal criminal defendant’s release or detention pending trial is determined by a judicial 

officer.    18  U.S.C.  §  3141.    At  the  Initial  Hearing,  the  judicial  officer  may  impose  a 

condition or combination of conditions that should reasonably assure the appearance of

the defendant “unless the judicial officer determines that such release will not reasonably 

assure the appearance of the person as required or will endanger the safety of any other 

person, or the community.”  18 U.S.C. § 3142(b). 

 

The  presiding  judicial  officer  may  also  conduct  a  Detention  Hearing  to  determine 

whether  any  condition  or  combination  of  conditions  of  release  will  apply.    18  U.S.C.  § 

3142  (c)  and  (f).    These  conditions  may  include  a  combination  of  any  of  the  following: 

third party custodian; employment requirements; educational requirements; restrictions on 

personal  associations or  travel;  compliance with  a  curfew;  refraining  from  the  excessive 

use  of  alcohol;  refraining  from  the  unauthorized  use  of  narcotic  drugs  or  controlled 

substances; undergoing medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment; execution of an 

agreement to forfeit property upon failure to appear; execution of a bail bond with solvent 

sureties; electronic monitoring; and, any other reasonable condition. 

United States magistrate judges are the front-line judicial officers who conduct the 

majority  of  initial  appearance  and  detention  hearings.    There  are  4  United  States 

magistrate judges in the District of Puerto Rico. 

A judicial officer may also order a defendant to be temporarily detained to permit 

revocation of conditional release, deportation or exclusion.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(d). 

With  few  exceptions,  once  a  person  has  been  found  guilty  of  an  offense,  the 

judicial officer shall order his or her detention pending imposition of sentence.  18 U.S.C. 

§ 3143.  Likewise, a person who has been found guilty of an offense and sentenced will 

generally be ordered detained pending appeal.  18 U.S.C. § 3144.

RELEASE AND DETENTION FACTORS 

 

The  Act  contains  13  specific  conditions  of  release  which  the  Court  may  impose 

separately or in combination if it finds that a criminal defendant’s personal recognizance 

or unsecured appearance is inadequate.  Some of the factors considered by the Court in 

detention  and  release  proceedings  include:  the  nature  of  the  offense  charged,  such  as 

whether the charged offense is a crime of violence or involves narcotics; the weight of the 

evidence; the personal history and characteristics of the person, such as character, family 

ties,  employment,  criminal  history;  and,  dangerousness,  including  whether  the  person 

poses a threat to others or the community.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)(1)-(3).  The Court may 

also  consider  other  factors,  such  as  the  source  of  any  property  offered  as  collateral  to 

secure a bond.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)(4). 

 

The  U.S.  Probation  Office  for  the  District  of  Puerto  Rico  assists  the  Court  by 

conducting  bail  and  presentence  investigations,  and  supervising  persons  for  whom 

conditional  pretrial  release  has  been  authorized  as  well  as  parolees  and  probationers.  

The U.S. Probation Office is located at:  Room 400 Federico Degetau Federal Building, 

150 Carlos Chardón Street, San Juan, Puerto Rico 00918-1741. 

REVIEW AND APPEAL 
OF RELEASE OR DETENTION ORDERS 
 

 

If  a  person  is  released  by  order  of  a  magistrate  judge,  the  attorney  for  the 

Government may file a motion for revocation of the order or amendment of the conditions 

of  release.    The  person  may  also  file  a  motion  for  amendment  of  the  conditions  of

offense.  18 U.S.C. § 3145(a). 

If a person is ordered detained by a magistrate judge, the person may file a motion 

for  revocation  or  amendment  of  the  detention  order,  with  the  court  having  original 

jurisdiction over the offense.  18 U.S.C. § 3145(b). 

Release or detention orders entered by district judges may be appealed before the 

U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.  18 U.S.C. §§ 3145(c), and 3731; 28 U.S.C. §

SECURING BAIL 

In  ordering  the  release  of  a  criminal  defendant,  the  Court  may  impose  financial 

conditions.  It may authorize an unsecured personal bond whereby the person promises 

to pay the Court a specified sum of money if he or she fails to appear as required.  If an 

unsecured personal bond is authorized the person is released without deposit of cash bail 

or collateral and promises to pay a sum of money if he or she fails to appear as required.  

The Court may require that a solvent co-signer, usually a family member or friend, appear 

where an unsecured personal bond has been authorized. 

 

In  cases  where  release  is  conditioned  upon  security,  the  person  may  secure  a 

commercial bail bond or may deposit at the Clerk’s Office, subject to forfeiture for breach 

of  a  condition  of  release,  cash  or  collateral.    A  person’s  relatives  or  close  friends 

sometimes post their property or act as his or her sureties. 

Fed.  R.  Crim.  P.  46(f)  sets  out  the  procedure  to  declare  a  bail  forfeited  if  a

REQUESTING THE RETURN OF BOND DOCUMENTS 
 

At  the  conclusion  of  a  case,  upon  the  defendant’s  remand  to  begin  serving  any 

sentence  imposed,  a  surety  may  request  the  return  of  any  bond-related  documents 

deposited  at  the  Clerk’s  Office  by  prior  appointment  by  calling  the  Intake  Section  at 

(787)772-3032 or (787)772-3033. 

Return  of  cash  deposited  as  collateral  must  be  requested  at  the  conclusion  of  a 

case, by written motion to the Court.  Said cash will be returned only upon Court order. 

The following information is necessary to schedule an appointment: the complete 

name  of  the  surety;  the  criminal  case  number;  and,  the  Clerk’s  Office  receipt  number.  

Documents  will  be  returned  to  the  person  whose  name  appears  in  the  receipt.    An 

authorized  representative  must  be  designated  in  writing,  under  signature  of  the  surety 

named in the receipt.  The original letter of authorization and original Clerk’s Office receipt 

will  be  kept  by  the  Clerk’s  Office  for  the  record.    Sureties  or  authorized  representatives 

must present a valid photo identification in order to receive bond-related documents. 

 

Documents may only be returned by mail if a surety resides outside the District of 

Puerto Rico.

10. 

To use this form, you must be a person who is currently serving a sentence under a judgment against you in a state 
court.  You are asking for relief from the conviction or the sentence.  This form is your petition for relief.

You may also use this form to challenge a state judgment that imposed a sentence to be served in the future, but 
you must fill in the name of the state where the judgment was entered.  If you want to challenge a federal judgment 
that imposed a sentence to be served in the future, you should file a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 in the federal 
court that entered the judgment.

Make sure the form is typed or neatly written.

You must tell the truth and sign the form.  If you make a false statement of a material fact, you may be 
prosecuted for perjury.

Answer all the questions.  You do not need to cite law.  You may submit additional pages if necessary.  If you do 
not fill out the form properly, you will be asked to submit additional or correct information.  If you want to submit 
any legal arguments, you must submit them in a separate memorandum.  Be aware that any such memorandum may 
be subject to page limits set forth in the local rules of the court where you file this petition.

You must pay a fee of $5.  If the fee is paid, your petition will be filed.  If you cannot pay the fee, you may ask to 
proceed in forma pauperis (as a poor person).  To do that, you must fill out the last page of this form.  Also, you 
must submit a certificate signed by an officer at the institution where you are confined showing the amount of 
money that the institution is holding for you.  If your account exceeds $

 , you must pay the filing fee.

In this petition, you may challenge the judgment entered by only one court.  If you want to challenge a judgment 
entered by a different court (either in the same state or in different states), you must file a separate petition.

When you have completed the form, send the original and 
Court at this address:

copies to the Clerk of the United States District 

Clerk, United States District Court for 
Address
City, State Zip Code

If you want a file-stamped copy of the petition, you must enclose an additional copy of the petition and ask the court
to file-stamp it and return it to you.

CAUTION: You must include in this petition all the grounds for relief from the conviction or sentence that 
you challenge.  And you must state the facts that support each ground.  If you fail to set forth all the grounds 
in this petition, you may be barred from presenting additional grounds at a later date.

CAPITAL CASES: If you are under a sentence of death, you are entitled to the assistance of counsel and 
should request the appointment of counsel.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 (c), (d), (e), and (g) (Effective 12/1/13)

(c) Place of Compliance.

  (1) For a Trial, Hearing, or Deposition. A subpoena may command a
person to attend a trial, hearing, or deposition only as follows:
    (A) within 100 miles of where the person resides, is employed, or
regularly transacts business in person; or
    (B) within the state where the person resides, is employed, or regularly
transacts business in person, if the person
        (i) is a party or a party’s officer; or
        (ii) is commanded to attend a trial and would not incur substantial
expense.

  (2) For Other Discovery. A subpoena may command:
    (A) production of documents, electronically stored information, or
tangible things at a place within 100 miles of where the person resides, is
employed, or regularly transacts business in person; and
    (B) inspection of premises at the premises to be inspected.

(d) Protecting a Person Subject to a Subpoena; Enforcement.

  (1) Avoiding Undue Burden or Expense; Sanctions. A party or attorney
responsible for issuing and serving a subpoena must take reasonable steps
to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person subject to the
subpoena. The court for the district where compliance is required must
enforce this duty and impose an appropriate sanction—which may include
lost earnings and reasonable attorney’s fees—on a party or attorney who
fails to comply.

  (2) Command to Produce Materials or Permit Inspection.
    (A) Appearance Not Required. A person commanded to produce
documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things, or to
permit the inspection of premises, need not appear in person at the place of
production or inspection unless also commanded to appear for a deposition,
hearing, or trial.
    (B) Objections. A person commanded to produce documents or tangible
things or to permit inspection may serve on the party or attorney designated
in the subpoena a written objection to inspecting, copying, testing, or
sampling any or all of the materials or to inspecting the premises—or to
producing electronically stored information in the form or forms requested.
The objection must be served before the earlier of the time specified for
compliance or 14 days after the subpoena is served. If an objection is made,
the following rules apply:
        (i) At any time, on notice to the commanded person, the serving party
may move the court for the district where compliance is required for an
order compelling production or inspection.
        (ii) These acts may be required only as directed in the order, and the
order must protect a person who is neither a party nor a party’s officer from
significant expense resulting from compliance.

  (3) Quashing or Modifying a Subpoena.
    (A) When Required. On timely motion, the court for the district where
compliance is required must quash or modify a subpoena that:
        (i) fails to allow a reasonable time to comply;
        (ii) requires a person to comply beyond the geographical limits
specified in Rule 45(c);
        (iii) requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter, if no
exception or waiver applies; or
        (iv) subjects a person to undue burden.
   (B) When Permitted. To protect a person subject to or affected by a
subpoena, the court for the district where compliance is required may, on
motion, quash or modify the subpoena if it requires:

(i) disclosing a trade secret or other confidential research,

development, or commercial information; or

        (ii) disclosing an unretained expert’s opinion or information that does
not describe specific occurrences in dispute and results from the expert’s
study that was not requested by a party.
    (C) Specifying Conditions as an Alternative. In the circumstances
described in Rule 45(d)(3)(B), the court may, instead of quashing or
modifying a subpoena, order appearance or production under specified
conditions if the serving party:
        (i) shows a substantial need for the testimony or material that cannot be
otherwise met without undue hardship; and
        (ii) ensures that the subpoenaed person will be reasonably compensated.

(e) Duties in Responding to a Subpoena.

  (1) Producing Documents or Electronically Stored Information. These
procedures apply to producing documents or electronically stored
information:
    (A) Documents. A person responding to a subpoena to produce documents
must produce them as they are kept in the ordinary course of business or
must organize and label them to correspond to the categories in the demand.
    (B) Form for Producing Electronically Stored Information Not Specified.
If a subpoena does not specify a form for producing electronically stored
information, the person responding must produce it in a form or forms in
which it is ordinarily maintained or in a reasonably usable form or forms.
    (C) Electronically Stored Information Produced in Only One Form. The
person responding need not produce the same electronically stored
information in more than one form.
    (D) Inaccessible Electronically Stored Information. The person
responding need not provide discovery of electronically stored information
from sources that the person identifies as not reasonably accessible because
of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel discovery or for a protective
order, the person responding must show that the information is not
reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. If that showing is
made, the court may nonetheless order discovery from such sources if the
requesting party shows good cause, considering the limitations of Rule
26(b)(2)(C). The court may specify conditions for the discovery.

(2) Claiming Privilege or Protection.
  (A) Information Withheld. A person withholding subpoenaed information
under a claim that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial-preparation
material must:
      (i) expressly make the claim; and
      (ii) describe the nature of the withheld documents, communications, or
tangible things in a manner that, without revealing information itself
privileged or protected, will enable the parties to assess the claim.
  (B) Information Produced. If information produced in response to a
subpoena is subject to a claim of privilege or of protection as
trial-preparation material, the person making the claim may notify any party
that received the information of the claim and the basis for it. After being
notified, a party must promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified
information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the information
until the claim is resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the
information if the party disclosed it before being notified; and may promptly
present the information under seal to the court for the district where
compliance is required for a determination of the claim. The person who
produced the information must preserve the information until the claim is
resolved.

(g) Contempt.
The court for the district where compliance is required—and also, after a
motion is transferred, the issuing court—may hold in contempt a person
who, having been served, fails without adequate excuse to obey the
subpoena or an order related to it.

For access to subpoena materials, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(a) Committee Note (2013).

documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things, or to
permit the inspection of premises, need not appear in person at the place of
production or inspection unless also commanded to appear for a deposition,
hearing, or trial.

(B) Objections. A person commanded to produce documents or tangible
things or to permit inspection may serve on the party or attorney designated
in the subpoena a written objection to inspecting, copying, testing, or
sampling any or all of the materials or to inspecting the premises—or to
producing electronically stored information in the form or forms requested.
The objection must be served before the earlier of the time specified for
compliance or 14 days after the subpoena is served. If an objection is made,
the following rules apply:

(i) At any time, on notice to the commanded person, the serving party

may move the court for the district where compliance is required for an
order compelling production or inspection.

(ii) These acts may be required only as directed in the order, and the
order must protect a person who is neither a party nor a party’s officer from
significant expense resulting from compliance.

(3) Quashing or Modifying a Subpoena.

(A) When Required. On timely motion, the court for the district where

compliance is required must quash or modify a subpoena that:

(i) fails to allow a reasonable time to comply;
(ii) requires a person to comply beyond the geographical limits

specified in Rule 45(c);

(iii) requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter, if no

exception or waiver applies; or

(iv) subjects a person to undue burden.

(B) When Permitted. To protect a person subject to or affected by a
subpoena, the court for the district where compliance is required may, on
motion, quash or modify the subpoena if it requires:

(i) disclosing a trade secret or other confidential research, development,

or commercial information; or

(ii) disclosing an unretained expert’s opinion or information that does

not describe specific occurrences in dispute and results from the expert’s
study that was not requested by a party.

(C) Specifying Conditions as an Alternative. In the circumstances
described in Rule 45(d)(3)(B), the court may, instead of quashing or
modifying a subpoena, order appearance or production under specified
conditions if the serving party:

(i) shows a substantial need for the testimony or material that cannot be

otherwise met without undue hardship; and

(ii) ensures that the subpoenaed person will be reasonably compensated.

(e) Duties in Responding to a Subpoena.

(1) Producing Documents or Electronically Stored Information. These
procedures apply to producing documents or electronically stored
information:

(A) Documents. A person responding to a subpoena to produce documents

must produce them as they are kept in the ordinary course of business or
must organize and label them to correspond to the categories in the demand.
(B) Form for Producing Electronically Stored Information Not Specified.

If a subpoena does not specify a form for producing electronically stored
information, the person responding must produce it in a form or forms in
which it is ordinarily maintained or in a reasonably usable form or forms.

(C) Electronically Stored Information Produced in Only One Form. The

person responding need not produce the same electronically stored
information in more than one form.

(D) Inaccessible Electronically Stored Information. The person

responding need not provide discovery of electronically stored information
from sources that the person identifies as not reasonably accessible because
of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel discovery or for a protective
order, the person responding must show that the information is not
reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. If that showing is
made, the court may nonetheless order discovery from such sources if the
requesting party shows good cause, considering the limitations of Rule
26(b)(2)(C). The court may specify conditions for the discovery.

(2) Claiming Privilege or Protection.
(A) Information Withheld. A person withholding subpoenaed information
under a claim that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial-preparation
material must:

(i) expressly make the claim; and
(ii) describe the nature of the withheld documents, communications, or

tangible things in a manner that, without revealing information itself
privileged or protected, will enable the parties to assess the claim.
(B) Information Produced. If information produced in response to a
subpoena is subject to a claim of privilege or of protection as
trial-preparation material, the person making the claim may notify any party
that received the information of the claim and the basis for it. After being
notified, a party must promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified
information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the information
until the claim is resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the
information if the party disclosed it before being notified; and may promptly
present the information under seal to the court for the district where
compliance is required for a determination of the claim. The person who
produced the information must preserve the information until the claim is
resolved.

(g) Contempt.
The court for the district where compliance is required—and also, after a
motion is transferred, the issuing court—may hold in contempt a person
who, having been served, fails without adequate excuse to obey the
subpoena or an order related to it.

For access to subpoena materials, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(a) Committee Note (2013).

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 (c), (d), (e), and (g) (Effective 12/1/13)

(c) Place of Compliance.

  (1) For a Trial, Hearing, or Deposition. A subpoena may command a
person to attend a trial, hearing, or deposition only as follows:
    (A) within 100 miles of where the person resides, is employed, or
regularly transacts business in person; or
    (B) within the state where the person resides, is employed, or regularly
transacts business in person, if the person
        (i) is a party or a party’s officer; or
        (ii) is commanded to attend a trial and would not incur substantial
expense.

  (2) For Other Discovery. A subpoena may command:
    (A) production of documents, electronically stored information, or
tangible things at a place within 100 miles of where the person resides, is
employed, or regularly transacts business in person; and
    (B) inspection of premises at the premises to be inspected.

(d) Protecting a Person Subject to a Subpoena; Enforcement.

  (1) Avoiding Undue Burden or Expense; Sanctions. A party or attorney
responsible for issuing and serving a subpoena must take reasonable steps
to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person subject to the
subpoena. The court for the district where compliance is required must
enforce this duty and impose an appropriate sanction—which may include
lost earnings and reasonable attorney’s fees—on a party or attorney who
fails to comply.

  (2) Command to Produce Materials or Permit Inspection.
    (A) Appearance Not Required. A person commanded to produce
documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things, or to
permit the inspection of premises, need not appear in person at the place of
production or inspection unless also commanded to appear for a deposition,
hearing, or trial.
    (B) Objections. A person commanded to produce documents or tangible
things or to permit inspection may serve on the party or attorney designated
in the subpoena a written objection to inspecting, copying, testing, or
sampling any or all of the materials or to inspecting the premises—or to
producing electronically stored information in the form or forms requested.
The objection must be served before the earlier of the time specified for
compliance or 14 days after the subpoena is served. If an objection is made,
the following rules apply:
        (i) At any time, on notice to the commanded person, the serving party
may move the court for the district where compliance is required for an
order compelling production or inspection.
        (ii) These acts may be required only as directed in the order, and the
order must protect a person who is neither a party nor a party’s officer from
significant expense resulting from compliance.

  (3) Quashing or Modifying a Subpoena.
    (A) When Required. On timely motion, the court for the district where
compliance is required must quash or modify a subpoena that:
        (i) fails to allow a reasonable time to comply;
        (ii) requires a person to comply beyond the geographical limits
specified in Rule 45(c);
        (iii) requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter, if no
exception or waiver applies; or
        (iv) subjects a person to undue burden.
    (B) When Permitted. To protect a person subject to or affected by a
subpoena, the court for the district where compliance is required may, on
motion, quash or modify the subpoena if it requires:

(i) disclosing a trade secret or other confidential research,

development, or commercial information; or

        (ii) disclosing an unretained expert’s opinion or information that does
not describe specific occurrences in dispute and results from the expert’s
study that was not requested by a party.
    (C) Specifying Conditions as an Alternative. In the circumstances
described in Rule 45(d)(3)(B), the court may, instead of quashing or
modifying a subpoena, order appearance or production under specified
conditions if the serving party:
        (i) shows a substantial need for the testimony or material that cannot be
otherwise met without undue hardship; and
        (ii) ensures that the subpoenaed person will be reasonably compensated.

(e) Duties in Responding to a Subpoena.

  (1) Producing Documents or Electronically Stored Information. These
procedures apply to producing documents or electronically stored

    (A) Documents. A person responding to a subpoena to produce documents

requesting party shows good cause, considering the limitations of Rule
26(b)(2)(C). The court may specify conditions for the discovery.

(2) Claiming Privilege or Protection.
  (A) Information Withheld. A person withholding subpoenaed information
under a claim that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial-preparation
material must:
      (i) expressly make the claim; and
      (ii) describe the nature of the withheld documents, communications, or
tangible things in a manner that, without revealing information itself
privileged or protected, will enable the parties to assess the claim.
  (B) Information Produced. If information produced in response to a
subpoena is subject to a claim of privilege or of protection as
trial-preparation material, the person making the claim may notify any party
that received the information of the claim and the basis for it. After being
notified, a party must promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified
information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the information
until the claim is resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the
information if the party disclosed it before being notified; and may promptly

motion is transferred, the issuing court—may hold in contempt a person
who, having been served, fails without adequate excuse to obey the
subpoena or an order related to it.

Petition for Relief From a Conviction or Sentence

10.

To use this form, you must be a person who is currently serving a sentence under a judgment against you in a state
court.  You are asking for relief from the conviction or the sentence.  This form is your petition for relief.

You may also use this form to challenge a state judgment that imposed a sentence to be served in the future, but
you must fill in the name of the state where the judgment was entered.  If you want to challenge a federal judgment
that imposed a sentence to be served in the future, you should file a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 in the federal
court that entered the judgment.

Make sure the form is typed or neatly written.

You must tell the truth and sign the form.  If you make a false statement of a material fact, you may be
prosecuted for perjury.

Answer all the questions.  You do not need to cite law.  You may submit additional pages if necessary.  If you do
not fill out the form properly, you will be asked to submit additional or correct information.  If you want to submit a
brief or arguments, you must submit them in a separate memorandum.

You must pay a fee of $5.  If the fee is paid, your petition will be filed.  If you cannot pay the fee, you may ask to
proceed in forma pauperis (as a poor person).  To do that, you must fill out the last page of this form.  Also, you
must submit a certificate signed by an officer at the institution where you are confined showing the amount of
money that the institution is holding for you.  If your account exceeds $

 , you must pay the filing fee.

In this petition, you may challenge the judgment entered by only one court.  If you want to challenge a judgment
entered by a different court (either in the same state or in different states), you must file a separate petition.

When you have completed the form, send the original and
Court at this address:

copies to the Clerk of the United States District 

Clerk, United States District Court for 
Address
City, State Zip Code

If you want a file-stamped copy of the petition, you must enclose an additional copy of the petition and ask the court
to file-stamp it and return it to you.

CAUTION: You must include in this petition all the grounds for relief from the conviction or sentence that
you challenge.  And you must state the facts that support each ground.  If you fail to set forth all the grounds
in this petition, you may be barred from presenting additional grounds at a later date.

CAPITAL CASES: If you are under a sentence of death, you are entitled to the assistance of counsel and
should request the appointment of counsel.

(Name of the plaintiff’s attorney or unrepresented plaintiff)

I have received your request to waive service of a summons in this action along with a copy of the complaint,

two copies of this waiver form, and a prepaid means of returning one signed copy of the form to you. 

I, or the entity I represent, agree to save the expense of serving a summons and complaint in this case.  

I  understand  that  I,  or  the  entity  I  represent,  will  keep  all  defenses  or  objections  to  the  lawsuit,  the  court’s

jurisdiction, and the venue of the action, but that I waive any objections to the absence of a summons or of service.  

I also understand that I, or the entity I represent, must file and serve an answer or a motion under Rule 12 within
, the date when this request was sent (or 90 days if it was sent outside the

60 days from
United States).  If I fail to do so, a default judgment will be entered against me or the entity I represent.

Duty to Avoid Unnecessary Expenses of Serving a Summons

Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires certain defendants to cooperate in saving unnecessary expenses of serving a summons
and complaint.  A defendant who is located in the United States and who fails to return a signed waiver of service requested by a plaintiff located in
the United States will be required to pay the expenses of service, unless the defendant shows good cause for the failure.

“Good cause” does not include a belief that the lawsuit is groundless, or that it has been brought in an improper venue, or that the court has

no jurisdiction over this matter or over the defendant or the defendant’s property.  

If the waiver is signed and returned, you can still make these and all other defenses and objections, but you cannot object to the absence of

a summons or of service. 

If you waive service, then you must, within the time specified on the waiver form, serve an answer or a motion under Rule 12 on the plaintiff
and file a copy with the court.  By signing and returning the waiver form, you are allowed more time to respond than if a summons had been served.

8.

9.

To use this form, you must be a person who is serving a sentence under a judgment against you in a federal court. 
You are asking for relief from the conviction or the sentence.  This form is your motion for relief.

You must file the form in the United States district court that entered the judgment that you are challenging.  If
you want to challenge a federal judgment that imposed a sentence to be served in the future, you should file the
motion in the federal court that entered that judgment.

Make sure the form is typed or neatly written.

You must tell the truth and sign the form.  If you make a false statement of a material fact, you may be prosecuted
for perjury.

Answer all the questions.  You do not need to cite law.  You may submit additional pages if necessary.  If you do
not fill out the form properly, you will be asked to submit additional or correct information.   If you want to submit
any legal arguments, you must submit them in a separate memorandum.  Be aware that any such memorandum
may be subject to page limits set forth in the local rules of the court where you file this motion.

If you cannot pay for the costs of this motion (such as costs for an attorney or transcripts), you may ask to proceed
in forma pauperis (as a poor person).  To do that, you must fill out the last page of this form.  Also, you must
submit a certificate signed by an officer at the institution where you are confined showing the amount of money
that the institution is holding for you.

In this motion, you may challenge the judgment entered by only one court.  If you want to challenge a judgment
entered by a different judge or division (either in the same district or in a different district), you must file a
separate motion.

When you have completed the form, send the original and
Court at this address:

 copies to the Clerk of the United States District 

Clerk, United States District Court for 
Address
City, State Zip Code

If you want a file-stamped copy of the petition, you must enclose an additional copy of the petition and ask the
court to file-stamp it and return it to you.

CAUTION: You must include in this motion all the grounds for relief from the conviction or sentence that
you challenge.  And you must state the facts that support each ground.  If you fail to set forth all the
grounds in this motion, you may be barred from presenting additional grounds at a later date.

10. CAPITAL CASES: If you are under a sentence of death, you are entitled to the assistance of counsel and

should request the appointment of counsel.

Who Should Use This Form.  You should use this form if 
•

you are a federal prisoner and you wish to challenge the way your sentence is being carried out (for
example, you claim that the Bureau of Prisons miscalculated your sentence or failed to properly award
good time credits);
you are in federal or state custody because of something other than a judgment of conviction (for
example, you are in pretrial detention or are awaiting extradition); or
you are alleging that you are illegally detained in immigration custody.   

Who Should Not Use This Form.  You should not use this form if
•

you are challenging the validity of a federal judgment of conviction and sentence (these challenges are
generally raised in a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255);
you are challenging the validity of a state judgment of conviction and sentence (these challenges are
generally raised in a petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2254); or
you are challenging a final order of removal in an immigration case (these challenges are generally
raised in a petition for review directly with a United States Court of Appeals).

Preparing the Petition.  The petition must be typed or neatly written, and you must sign and date it under
penalty of perjury.  A false statement may lead to prosecution. 

Answer all the questions.  You do not need to cite law.  You may submit additional pages if necessary.  If you
do not fill out the form properly, you will be asked to submit additional or correct information.  If you want to
submit any legal arguments, you must submit them in a separate memorandum.  Be aware that any such

pay the filing fee, you must ask the court for permission to proceed in forma pauperis – that is, as a person who
cannot pay the filing fee – by submitting the documents that the court requires.

Submitting Documents to the Court.  Mail your petition and
District Court for the district and division in which you are confined.  For a list of districts and divisions, see 28 
U.S.C. §§ 81-131.  All copies must be identical to the original.  Copies may be legibly handwritten.

10.

To use this form, you must be a person who is currently serving a sentence under a judgment against you in a state
court.  You are asking for relief from the conviction or the sentence.  This form is your petition for relief.

You may also use this form to challenge a state judgment that imposed a sentence to be served in the future, but
you must fill in the name of the state where the judgment was entered.  If you want to challenge a federal judgment
that imposed a sentence to be served in the future, you should file a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 in the federal
court that entered the judgment.

Make sure the form is typed or neatly written.

You must tell the truth and sign the form.  If you make a false statement of a material fact, you may be
prosecuted for perjury.

Answer all the questions.  You do not need to cite law.  You may submit additional pages if necessary.  If you do
not fill out the form properly, you will be asked to submit additional or correct information.  If you want to submit a
brief or arguments, you must submit them in a separate memorandum.

You must pay a fee of $5.  If the fee is paid, your petition will be filed.  If you cannot pay the fee, you may ask to
proceed in forma pauperis (as a poor person).  To do that, you must fill out the last page of this form.  Also, you
must submit a certificate signed by an officer at the institution where you are confined showing the amount of
money that the institution is holding for you.  If your account exceeds $

 , you must pay the filing fee.

In this petition, you may challenge the judgment entered by only one court.  If you want to challenge a judgment
entered by a different court (either in the same state or in different states), you must file a separate petition.

When you have completed the form, send the original and
Court at this address:

copies to the Clerk of the United States District 

Clerk, United States District Court for 
Address
City, State Zip Code

If you want a file-stamped copy of the petition, you must enclose an additional copy of the petition and ask the court
to file-stamp it and return it to you.

CAUTION: You must include in this petition all the grounds for relief from the conviction or sentence that
you challenge.  And you must state the facts that support each ground.  If you fail to set forth all the grounds
in this petition, you may be barred from presenting additional grounds at a later date.

CAPITAL CASES: If you are under a sentence of death, you are entitled to the assistance of counsel and
should request the appointment of counsel.

PUBLIC NOTICE

NOTICE WITH REGARD TO FILING DOCUMENTS IN FEDERAL COURT 

All federal courts are required to maintain public websites that contain a lot of other information, including,
docket information and all written opinions issued by the court.  This is required by the E-Government Act,
first  made  law  in  2002,  and  it  established  a  broad  mandate  for  providing  electronic  public  access  to
government (including the Judiciary’s) information. 

The federal courts have met these requirements due to the implementation of our case management/electronic
case files (CM/ECF) system and the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system.  See also
the information on their web site: http://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov/ 

You are advised to keep private information out of your pleadings and other documents.  If a litigant in a case
believes that sensitive or private information will be contained in a pleading or court order, s/he may file with
the court a motion to seal.  After hearing from both sides, the presiding judge will determine whether it is
appropriate to take the extraordinary precaution of placing one or more documents or an entire case under
seal.  The granting of such relief is unusual, given the mandate referenced above.
