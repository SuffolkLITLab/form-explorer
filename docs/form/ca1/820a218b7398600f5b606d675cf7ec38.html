INTRODUCTION 

The information in this Handout is for individuals who are representing themselves 

in civil actions in the District of Maine without the assistance of an attorney. Parties who 

choose to represent themselves are often referred to as pro se parties or pro se litigants. 

Pro se means “for yourself.”    

Unlike  attorneys,  pro  se  litigants  may  only  represent  themselves  and  may  only 

present  their  own  claims  and  defenses.  Under  the  law,  you  may  not  speak  for  another 

person or entity such as a company or business. This means that you may not file a class 

action lawsuit. A pro se litigant also may not authorize another person who is not a licensed 

attorney to appear for them. This includes a spouse, relative, or another party. 

The Court encourages all self-represented litigants to consult this Handout together 

with  the  Federal  Rules  of  Practice  and  Procedure,  including  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil 

Procedure and  the Federal Rules of Evidence (both are also available in Title 28 of the 

United States Code), the District of Maine Local Rules, and additional resources available 

on the Court’s website, including the forms and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).1 

THE DISTRICT OF MAINE 

The United States District Court for the District of Maine has courtrooms and offices 

in the City of Bangor and the City of Portland. Cases are filed in either the Bangor Federal 

Courthouse  or  the  Portland  Federal  Courthouse  depending  on  the  county  in  which  the 

lawsuit arises. Cases arising out of Aroostook, Franklin, Hancock, Kennebec, Penobscot, 

Piscataquis, Somerset, Waldo and Washington counties are filed and ordinarily heard in 

Bangor.  Cases  arising  out  of  Androscoggin,  Cumberland,  Knox2,  Lincoln,  Oxford, 

Sagadahoc and York counties are filed and ordinarily heard in Portland. 

 

 The Federal Rules, Local Rules, the United States Code, statues, etc. are regularly updated. You are responsible for 
making sure that you are using the most recent version of each. 

 Cases brought by inmates at the Maine State Prison in Warren must be filed in Bangor and are automatically referred 
to the magistrate judge in Bangor.

THE CLERK’S OFFICE 

The  authority  and  responsibilities  of  the  Clerk’s  Office  is  outlined  in  Rules  77 

through 79 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Christa Berry is the Clerk of Court for 

the District of Maine. Eric Storms is the Chief Deputy. When you write or call the Clerk’s 

Office, you will speak with a case manager. Case managers are responsible for maintaining 

 

 

 

3 

 
 

   

 

 

 
 
the official court record. They process paperwork, schedule matters before the judge, and 

 

 

perform work in the courtroom. Each judge has an assigned case manager who assists them 

with their cases. All case-related inquiries should be directed to the case manager to 

whom your case is assigned. You are not permitted to telephone, email, or mail the 

judge’s chambers directly. 

Case  managers  and  other  Clerk’s  Office  staff  may  assist  you  with  some  of  your 

inquiries, but they are not authorized to provide you with legal advice. In general, legal 

advice is advice about what the law is; how to succeed in your case; how to interpret the 

Constitution, statutes, rules or other sources of law.  

In addition to being unable to provide litigants with legal advice, Clerk’s Office staff 

are not allowed to:  

•  Make recommendations or suggest ways to help you win your case.  

Clerk’s  Office  staff  may  provide  assistance  regarding  court  administration  and 

docket management. Clerk’s Office staff may: 

•  Answer general questions about how the Court works.  

•  Give general information about court rules, terminology, procedures 

and practices.  

•  Provide or refer you to available court forms.  

•  Provide general information from your case, such as informing you of 

certain deadlines or if a decision whether order has been issued.  

4 

   

 

•  Fill out or correct any forms for you. 

•  Predict how or when a judge may decide any issue. 

•  Interpret the meaning of any judicial order. 

•  Calculate response times or certain deadlines.  

•  Let you speak to a judge outside of a court hearing.  

•  Give you free copies of documents from your case. 

•  Conduct legal research for you. 

 

 

RESPONSIBILITIES OF SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANTS 

As a self-represented litigant, you have certain responsibilities and take on certain risks. 

In  particular,  you  must  ensure  that  you  conduct  your  case  and  present  your  filings  in 

compliance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (“Fed. R. Civ. P.” or “the Rules”) 

and the Local Rules for the District of Maine (“D. Me. Loc. R.” or “the Local Rules”). In 

addition,  you  should  familiarize  yourself  with  the  Federal  Rules  of  Evidence  (“Fed.  R. 

Evid.” or “the Rules of Evidence”) and any substantive law that governs the merits of your 

civil  action.  The  fact  that  you  do  not  have  an  attorney  does  not  relieve  you  of  these 

responsibilities.  

The following list of responsibilities is not intended to be exhaustive, and only provides 

a few examples of the manner in which self-represented litigants are expected to conduct 

themselves when pursuing an action in this Court:  

.  You are required to diligently prosecute your lawsuit. Unless and until you obtain 

an attorney to represent you, it is your responsibility to do everything necessary to 

prepare  your  case  for  trial.  This  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  responding  to 

discovery  requests  and  motions.  If  the  case  goes  to  trial,  it  will  also  be  your 

responsibility to present your case in court.  

  1

 

2.  Do not expect any correspondence or orders from the Court instructing you about 

how to pursue your lawsuit. If you fail to follow established procedures and orders 

issued by the Court, your case may be subject to dismissal.  

3.  You  must  file  all  pleadings  with  the  Court  and  all  pleadings  must  contain  your 

signature  on  the  last  page  as  provided  in  Rule  5  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil 

Procedure  (Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  5),  you  are  required  to  serve  the  opposing  parties’ 

attorney (or the opposing party themself, if they are self-represented) with copies of 

5 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

all  pleadings  and  motions  filed  with  the  Court.  Likewise,  each  opposing  party  is 

required to serve you with copies of all pleadings they file with the Court. 

4.  Each  pleading  must  contain  the  case  caption,  docket  number,  and  title  of  the 

document.  

5.  Documents filed with the Court are publicly available. As provided in Rule 5.2 of 

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2), you must take special 

care  not  to  disclose  in  your  filings  anyone’s  social  security  number,  taxpayer-

identification number, birth date, the full name of a minor, or a financial account 

number. All such references must be “redacted.”  This means that before you file 

the document with the Court you must make sure that the document contains only 

the last four digits of the Social Security or taxpayer number, only the year of the 

individual’s  birth,  only  the  minor’s  initials  and  only  the  last  four  digits  of  the 

financial  account  number.  The  person  filing  the  document  is  responsible  for 

making  these  redactions.  Rule  5.2  protects  an  individual’s  privacy  because  all 

filings submitted to the Court, whether in electronic or in paper format, will appear 

on the docket and be publicly available.  

6.  You must keep the Court and the all other involved parties advised of any change 

of your address or telephone number. This is done by providing a Notice of Change 

of Address in writing. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, 

which could include the dismissal of your case.   

7.  You  should  retain  for  your  records  a  copy  of  every  document  you  submit  to  the 

Court. You may obtain copies from the Clerk’s Office for a fee. The Clerk’s Office  

may not provide you with copies free of charge.

WHERE TO FIND LEGAL ADVICE 

If you decide that you do not wish to represent yourself but do not know of a lawyer 

who  can  assist  you,  you  should  consult  the  Yellow  Pages  of  your  telephone  directory, 

search  out  a  federally-licensed  attorney  on  the  Internet,  or  call  the  Maine  State  Bar 

Association Lawyer Referral Service (1-800-860-1460). If your income qualifies, you may 

be eligible for free or low-cost legal assistance from an office of Pine Tree Legal Assistance 

(1-800-442-4293) or from the Volunteer Lawyers Project of Maine (207-774-4348). If you 

are over 60 years old, you may be eligible for legal assistance from an office of the Legal 

Services for the Elderly (1-800-750-5353). Some attorneys and law firms also provide “pro 

bono” (free) legal services to persons unable to afford their services. The Court does not 

maintain a list of such attorneys, but you are free to inquire of law firms on your own behalf 

as to if they provide pro bono services.  

 

WHAT IS A FEDERAL CASE? 

The United States  District Court for the  District of Maine is a federal court with 

limited jurisdiction. This means that the Court only has jurisdiction, or legal authority, to 

hear certain types of cases. This makes it unlike the State of Maine “District and “Superior” 

Courts, which have jurisdiction over most legal disputes arising in Maine.  

Cases that may be filed with the United States District Court by private individuals 

include: 

•  Civil cases with at least one claim that arises under the United States Constitution 

and/or federal law. If this is the only basis for jurisdiction, then related state law 

claims, if any, may be included in the case but they must arise out of the same group 

of facts as the federal claim(s) in the case.  

•  Civil cases brought against the United States of America and its agencies, and civil 

cases against federal officers or employees based on acts undertaken in the scope of 

their federal duties, even if the claim or claims in the case arise under state law. 

7 

 
 

 

 

 

•  Civil cases that arise under state law but are between persons who reside in different 

states,  provided  that  the  amount  in  controversy  exceeds  $75,000,  so-called 

“diversity of citizenship” cases.  

•  Cases based on the United States District Court’s admiralty (maritime) jurisdiction. 

If your case does not fall under any of these categories, the United States District Court 

may not be the appropriate court.  

Cases that should not be filed with the Unites States District Court:    

•  Cases between persons who live in Maine involving only state law claims.  

•  Cases  arising  out  of  domestic  relations,  which  include  divorce,  protection  from 

abuse,  and  parental  rights  and  responsibilities.  However,  cases  arising  under  the 

Hague Convention on Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction may be filed 

in the United States District Court.  

•  Cases  by  prisoners  who  seek  relief  based  exclusively  on  state  law,  rules,  and/or 

regulations, that do not allege a violation of the United States Constitution or federal 

law. 

It is your burden to demonstrate that your case belongs in federal court.  If your case 

does  not  belong  in  the  United  States  District  Court,  it  does  not  mean  you  are  without 

recourse. You may be able to file your case in state court.  

HOW TO FILE A CIVIL ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT 

“A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.”  See Fed. R. 

Civ. P. 3. In addition, you must complete certain forms. The following paragraphs explain 

the  components  of  a  Complaint  and  identify  the  administrative  documents  the  Clerk’s 

Office will require you to file to open a new case. (Underlined documents are available as 

downloadable forms on the Court’s website under the “Self-Representation” tab or upon 

request in paper format.) 

 

8 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

1. Complaint. The “Complaint” is the document that the plaintiff needs to file with 

the Court to initiate a lawsuit. You may write your own Complaint or use the complaint 

form provided by the Court.  

A Complaint does not need to be typewritten but must be legible if handwritten. It 

must be submitted on 8 ½″ x 11″ paper. The Complaint should contain:   

a.  A caption or heading specifying the court in which it is being filed. 

All  plaintiffs  and  defendants  must  be  listed  in  the  caption  of  the 

Complaint.  

b.  A title, i.e. ― Complaint. 

c.  The name and address of each plaintiff and defendant.  

d.  One or more paragraphs explaining why this Court has jurisdiction, or 

legal authority, to decide the case.  

e.  Separate  numbered  paragraph(s)  that  set  forth  a  short  and  plain 

statement of the facts that give rise to the complaint and state the nature 

of  the  claim  or  claims  being  advanced.  The  statement  of  facts  should 

include a description of what the defendant(s) did or failed to do and how 

those  acts  or  omissions  caused  injury  or  damage  to  you,  as  well  as  a 

description of any injury sustained by you and what medical treatment, if 

any, was required. If you fail to provide the facts that demonstrate how 

each  defendant  was  personally  involved  in  and/or  responsible  for  the 

alleged  incident  or  harm  to  you,  it    may  result  in  dismissal  of  that 

defendant or the entire case.  

f.  The  date,  with  your  original  signature,  followed  by  your  complete 

mailing  address  and  telephone  number.  You  should  exercise  care  to 

assure that all statements you have give are true and accurate. 

g.  Jury Demand. When filing a Complaint (or an Answer) you should 

consider whether you  want a jury to  decide  your case. If a jury trial is 

desired, a jury demand must be requested and included in the title of the 

Complaint  or  Answer  (you  do  not  need  to  file  a  separate  document 

9 

 
 

 

 

 

demanding a jury trial). If you fail to demand a jury trial you will waive 

your  right  to  a  jury  trial.  In  some  types  of  cases,  such  as  tort  actions 

against the United States, jury trials are not available. 

h.  Rule  11  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  prohibits  filing 

lawsuits that are clearly frivolous or filed with the intent to harass another 

individual. If, after reviewing your Complaint, the Court determines that 

you have filed a lawsuit for an improper or clearly unnecessary purpose, 

it  may  impose  sanctions  against  you.  Those  sanctions  may  include 

ordering you to pay a fine or pay the legal fees of the person or persons 

against whom you filed the lawsuit. 

ote: The initial complaint and accompanying case opening documents must be filed 
with the Court in paper form. Electronic case filing is only available to self-represented 
parties after the complaint has been received.  
 

2. Civil Cover Sheet JS-44. You need to complete this form when you file your 

Complaint with the Court. 

3. Filing Fee or Application to Proceed Without the Prepayment of Fees and 

Costs. Cash, a credit card, money order, cashier’s check, or personal check, (made payable 

to “Clerk, USDC”) are acceptable forms of payment,   

If you are unable to afford the filing fee and service costs, you may ask the Court to 

waive those fees and costs. To do so, you must file an Application for Leave to Proceed in 

District  Court  Without  Prepayment  of  Fees  or  Costs.  The  Application  incorporates  an 

affidavit. An affidavit is a document that you complete and sign under penalty of perjury 

declaring that the information provided is true and accurate. The application must be fully 

completed,  typewritten  or  legibly  handwritten  and  include  your  original  signature.  The 

application to proceed without payment of the filing fee will be docketed in your electronic 

case file, meaning that it will be accessible to members of the public. 

 

10 

 
 

 

 

  N

 

 

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? 

After the plaintiff completes and files the Complaint and supporting documentation 

a case manager or other Clerk’s Office staff will: 

1.  File stamp the documents. (The file stamp shows the date and time of filing.) 

2.  Assign a case number and judges (both a district judge and a magistrate judge). 

The case number (for example, 1:22-cv-00123-JAW) is broken down into five 

parts: Bangor (1) or Portland (2); the year the case was filed (here, 22); “cv” 

for  civil  case;  the  sequence  of  case  (here,  “00123”);  and  the  initials  of  the 

District Judge to whom the case is assigned (here, “JAW”).  

3.  Provide  Notice  of  Lawsuit  and  Request  for  Waiver  Service  and  Waiver  of 

Service of Summons forms, or if requested, signed Summons forms. 

 

4.  Write a receipt for the filing fee. 

If the plaintiff is asking that the filing fee be waived, then steps 3 and 4 will not take 

place.  Instead,  a  judge  will  first  conduct  an  initial  review  to  decide  whether  (a)  the 

application to proceed without prepayment of the filing fees and costs should be granted 

and (b) the complaint is subject to dismissal for asserting “frivolous and malicious” claims 

or  for  failure  to  state  a  claim  on  which  relief  may  be  granted.  See  28  U.S.C.  § 

1915(e)(2)(B). 

If the Court grants the application and determines that the complaint states a claim 

against one or more defendants, then the Court will issue an order for service instructing 

the  Clerk’s  Office  to  prepare  the  necessary  paperwork  to  serve  the  defendant(s)  on  the 

plaintiff’s behalf. For purposes of service, it is the plaintiff’s responsibility to provide the 

Court with the address(es) where the defendant(s) can be served.  

11 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If the Court denies the application to proceed without prepayment, the Court will 

issue  an order explaining why. At this point, the case may be dismissed if the plaintiff does 

not pay the filing fee by the date ordered. If a plaintiff is required to pay the filing fee, then 

the plaintiff must make their own arrangements to serve the defendant(s). 

SERVING A COMPLAINT 

As provided in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d), a plaintiff will ordinarily request 

that the defendant waive formal service (that is, the formal delivery of the Complaint or 

other papers to the defendant, officially notifying the defendant of the action). Generally, 

a  plaintiff  will  send  the  defendant  a  copy  of  the  Complaint  together  with  a  Notice  of 

Lawsuit  and  Request  for  Waiver  Service  and  Waiver  of  the  Service  of  Summons. 

Typically, the defendant will sign the waiver of service and return it to the plaintiff who 

then must file it with the Court. The action will then proceed as if service of a summons 

and Complaint has been made.  

If the defendant does not waive service, the plaintiff must complete a Summons, 

present it to a Clerk’s Office staff member to sign and seal, and then have it served upon 

the defendant in accordance with Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Procedure.  

For more information on service of process in a civil case. See Appendix A, Guidance 

Concerning Service of Process.

The defendant in a lawsuit is the person against whom relief or recovery is sought 

in a Complaint. Like the plaintiff, an individual defendant may be self-represented. If you 

are a self-represented defendant, keep in mind that you should seriously consider obtaining 

professional legal assistance.  

The first step in representing yourself as a defendant is to respond to the Complaint 

by filing a Motion or an Answer. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12. An Answer is a formal written 

statement responding to the Complaint setting forth the grounds for a defense. The Rules 

set a deadline for a defendant to answer or respond to a Complaint. Typically, a defendant 

must  file  an  Answer  or  responsive  motion  within  21  days  after  being  served  with  the 
12 

 
 

 

 

 
 
summons and Complaint. If a defendant receives a request to waive service, and s/he elects 

 

 

to waive formal service s/he must return the form to the plaintiff within 30 days of the date 

the Notice of Lawsuit and Request for Waiver was mailed to the defendant. If the defendant 

signs the “Waiver of Service,” s/he is allowed 60 days from the date the plaintiff mailed 

the waiver to respond to the Complaint. The United States government, its agencies, and 

employees have 60 days from the date of service to respond to a Complaint. 

The  defendant’s  “Answer”  or  responsive  motion  must  be  filed  with  the  Clerk’s 

Office and shall include the case caption that appears on the Complaint. The Answer should 

state any defenses that may exist to the plaintiff’s claims and admit or deny each of the 

allegations in the Complaint. The defendant may request a jury trial, and the request may 

be made within the Answer. The defendant also must mail a copy of the Motion or Answer 

to the plaintiff(s).  

A form Answer and a form Answer with Counterclaim or Crossclaim are available 

as downloadable forms on the Court’s website under the “Self-Representation” tab or upon 

request in paper format. Use the form Answer if you do not have or do not intend to file a 

claim  for  relief  against  the  plaintiff.  Use  the  form  “Answer  with  Counterclaim  or 

Crossclaim” if you intend to answer the Complaint against you and you also want to assert 

your own claim or claims against the plaintiff (claims asserted by a defendant against a 

plaintiff are called “counterclaims”) or against another defendant (called a “crossclaim”). 

If you have a counterclaim, you must file a counterclaim or else you will lose the right to 

assert your claim(s) at a later date. See Rule 13 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  

The defendant must mail a copy of every document that s/he files with the Court to 

the  plaintiff’s  attorney  or  the  plaintiff  (if  the  plaintiff  is  self-represented)  and  to  any 

additional parties involved in the case. The defendant must attach a Certificate of Service 

to these documents. Just as the defendant is required to respond to the plaintiff’s Complaint, 

the  plaintiff  or  crossclaim  defendant  is  also  required  to  respond  to  any  counterclaim  or 

crossclaim filed by the defendant. See Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for 

the required deadlines for these responses.  

 

13 

 

 

Whether  you  are  a  defendant  served  with  a  Complaint,  a  plaintiff  served  with  a 

counterclaim, or a defendant served with a crossclaim, do not delay in filing your response. 

When a party does not file a timely Answer or other response with the Court, the opposing 

party  may  ask  the  Clerk  of  Court  to  enter  a  default  which  may  result  in  the  entry  of  a 

judgment by the Court against the party who failed to answer or otherwise respond. 

 

 

REQUIREMENT TO FILE A DIVERSITY DISCLOSURE STATEMENT 

Diversity of citizenship is when parties on opposing sides of a lawsuit are citizens 

of different states.  

All parties in diversity cases must identify their citizenship by filing a disclosure 

statement with their first appearance in a case. If your citizenship information changes at 

any point during the pendency of your case, you must file a supplemental disclosure 

statement updating your citizenship information with the court. See Rule 7.1(a)(2) of the 

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rule 7.1(a)(2). 

A form Diversity Disclosure Statement is available as a downloadable form on the 

Court’s website under the “Self-Representation” tab or upon request in paper format.  

CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE 

A  Certificate  of  Service  is  a  statement  identifying  who  was  served,  at  what 

address(es), when they were served and the method of service. A certificate of service is 

proof  that  copies  of  documents  for  filing  have  been  sent  to  the  opposing  party  or  the 

opposing party’s attorney.  

Note: A certificate of service is only required for service of documents on parties 

who do not receive filings electronically via the Court’s electronic case filing system (ECF) 

or when serving sealed documents on all parties. A certificate of service is not applicable 

to the filing of the Complaint. Service of the Complaint is a separate process entirely. For 

more  information  regarding  service  of  the  Complaint.  See  Appendix  A,  Guidance 

Concerning Service of Process. Certificates of service apply to documents filed with the 

14 

 
 

 

   

 

 
 
Court after service of the Complaint has been made on the defendant(s). See Federal Rule 

 

 

of Civil Procedure 5 for more information regarding service of documents filed with the 

Court.  

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

Service of Public Documents versus Service of Sealed Documents 

Whenever a public (non-sealed) document is filed using the Court’s electronic case 

filing  system  (ECF),  the  ECF  system,  will  automatically  generate  and  send  a  Notice  of 

Electronic Filing (NEF) to all participants in the case who are registered for electronic case 

filing. All ECF registered participants will be able to click on a link contained in the NEF 

to view the actual  PDF document(s) that have been filed. In this instance, service is being 

made  electronically  via  the  Court’s  ECF  system.  Any  case  participants  who  are  not 

registered for the Court’s ECF system will need to be served another way.  

Whenever  a  sealed  document  is  filed,  the  Court’s  electronic  case  filing  system 

(ECF),  will  automatically  generate  and  send  a  Notice  of  Electronic  Filing  (NEF)  to  all 

participants  in  the  case  who  are  registered  for  electronic  filing.  The  NEF  will  alert 

participants that a sealed filing has been made but participants will not be able to view the 

actual sealed  PDF document(s) that has been filed. Service of sealed documents will need 

to be made by another way.  

AMENDING PLEADINGS 

After a party files a pleading consisting of a Complaint, Answer, counterclaim or 

crossclaim, there is an opportunity to amend the pleading. See Rule 15 of the Federal Rules 

of Civil Procedure and the scheduling order issued in your case willprovide you with more 

information.  

ELECTRONIC FILING 

You  must  have  a  case  pending  to  register  for  electronic  filing.  Self-represented 

plaintiffs must file their initial pleadings (Complaint and Civil Cover Sheet, together with 

the Filing Fee or Application to Proceed Without the Prepayment of Fees and Costs) with 
15 

 
 
the Court in paper form. You may register for electronic filing by submitting a completed 

 

 

ECF Registration Form along with your initial pleadings or at any point thereafter. Persons 

interested in electronic filing should refer to Appendix B, Guidance for Electronic Filing 

in the District of Maine. 

 

SCHEDULING ORDERS 

After all of the defendants have entered their appearances, either by filing an Answer 

or  a  Motion,  the  Court  will  issue  a  Scheduling  Order.  If  a  defendant  files  a  Motion  to 

Dismiss  the  Complaint,  the  Court  will  ordinarily  decide  that  motion  before  issuing  a 

scheduling order. The Scheduling Order will set deadlines for completing different stages 

of the case. The Scheduling Order will also ordinarily specify deadlines for amending the 

pleadings, conducting discovery, and being ready for trial.  

If you are concerned about your ability to comply with deadlines contained in the 

Scheduling Order, you should consult with the other parties (if they are represented, you 

will need to consult with their attorney) to see if they will agree to a modification of the 

schedule.  If  they  all  agree,  you  should  file  a  motion  requesting  a  modification  of  the 

schedule indicating to the Court that the parties are in agreement. Make sure to specify the 

new  deadlines  or  other  modifications  you  are  requesting.  If  one  of  the  parties  does  not 

agree, you should indicate that in your motion requesting a modification of the schedule. 

A Motion is a written request filed by any party in the case who wants to ask the 

Court for an order directing some sort of action in the case.

CONDUCTING DISCOVERY 

Discovery is the process of obtaining case-related information from the opposing 

party or from non-party witnesses. Discovery is allowable in most civil cases but not in 

Social Security appeals. The process of discovery is governed by Rules 26 through 37 of 

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as well as Local Rule 26. The Scheduling Order will 

contain a deadline for the completion of discovery. There are many different ways to obtain 

discovery. The most common ways include: 

•  Interrogatories (written questions to the opposing party). 

•  Requests for production of documents from the opposing party. 

•  Requests for admissions from the opposing party. 

•  Depositions (a recorded questioning of a party or a potential witness under 

oath). 

•  Requests to examine a person or premises or personal property if the claims 

in the case make such a request appropriate. 

If your case involves discovery, here are some things you should know: 

•  The discovery process takes place between and among the parties. A litigant 

should not provide the Court with copies of discovery requests or responses 

unless an issue arises and the Court requests the materials. 

•  You  should  send  the  opposing  party  or  parties  discovery  requests  promptly 

after the Court issues the Scheduling Order, so the party to whom the discovery 

is  directed  has  sufficient  time  to  answer  or  object  before  the  discovery 

deadline. 

•  You should respond to any discovery requests you receive. A party who does 

not respond to a discovery request may be subject to sanctions. 

•  If  you  object  to  a  discovery  request  made  of  you,  you  should  express  your 

objection in your response to preserve your objection. A party with a discovery 

dispute  must  first  confer  with  the  opposing  party  in  a  good  faith  effort  to 

17 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

resolve  the  issue  in  dispute  by  agreement.  If  that  good  faith  effort  is 

unsuccessful, the moving party (either the party seeking to compel production 

of discovery or the party seeking protection from a discovery request) must file 

a Request for Hearing re Discovery Dispute using the Court’s form seeking a 

prompt hearing with a judicial officer by telephone or in person.  

 

 

There are limits to how much discovery you may request from an opposing party 

and how much discovery may be requested of you. You will need to review the discovery 

section of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Scheduling Order to determine the 

appropriate  scope  of  your  discovery  requests  and  responses.  The  discovery  rules  also 

impose affirmative responsibilities on the parties to disclose certain information without 

being asked for it. Again, you must consult the Rules and you may also need to consult 

related  case  law  to  understand  your  discovery  responsibilities.  Failure  to  comply  with 

disclosure  or  discovery  requirements  during  the  discovery  process  may  expose  you  to 

sanctions, including a sanction that precludes you from using non-disclosed evidence or 

exhibits at a later hearing or trial.  

  

If you believe your case also requires someone other than your opponent to provide 

testimony or produce documents or tangible things, you should also review Rules 34(c) 

and  45  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  and  any  related  law,  to  understand  the 

process for obtaining discovery from third parties. 

 

In the event you and another party to the case cannot agree about disclosures and 

discovery,  you  may  ask  the  Court  to  resolve  the  dispute.  Sometimes  the  party  seeking 

discovery will want to ask the Court to order the other party to produce something that has 

been withheld in discovery. Sometimes the party seeking to withhold something sought by 

the other party will want to ask the Court to issue a protective order relieving the party of 

their responsiblity  obligation to respond. In either case, the parties  must confer in  good 

faith to attempt to resolve their dispute before seeking relief from the Court. If the parties 

cannot resolve their dispute, then typically a magistrate judge will preside over an informal 

telephonic  discovery  conference  to  resolve  the  dispute.  A  party  must  use  this  informal 

18 

 
 

 

 
 
process  initially,  and  must  not  file  a  motion  seeking  discovery-related  relief.  See  Local 

 

 

Rule 7(a). If the presiding Judge concludes that the dispute cannot be resolved through an 

informal discovery conference, the Judge may order that the matter proceed through formal 

motion practice.  

HEARINGS AND TRIALS 

A  “hearing”  is  a  formal  proceeding  in  which  the  parties  are  heard  by  a  judge 

concerning the facts and law that apply to an important issue in the case. A hearing may be 

limited  to  oral  argument  concerning  the  facts  and  law  presented  in  motion  papers,  or  a 

hearing  may  be  a  proceeding  at  which  the  parties  introduce  witness  testimony  and 

documents for the judge’s consideration.  

The  most  common  pretrial  hearing  in  a  civil  case  is  a  hearing  on  a  Motion  for 

Summary  Judgment.  In  this  District,  a  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  is  governed  by 

special rules that require the parties to present the facts in support of their case through 

paper  filings  called  statements  of  material  facts,  along  with  supporting  documents  like 

affidavits and exhibits. These requirements are outlined in Local Rule 56. Typically, if the 

parties request a hearing on a Motion for Summary Judgment, the Court will hold a hearing 

to allow the parties to present oral argument in support of or in opposition to a Motion for 

Summary Judgment, but not to present evidence. If the parties do not request a hearing, 

and  if  the  judge  determines  that  a  hearing  is  not  necessary,  a  Motion  for  Summary 

Judgment may be decided soley based on the paper record.  

 

A “trial” is the most formal kind of hearing. Trials may be a “jury trial”, meaning a 

jury will resolve any factual disputes between the parties, or a “bench trial,” meaning the 

judge will resolve any factual disputes. A trial typically begins with the parties providing 

their opening statements. Thereafter, the parties are required to present the case by calling 

witnesses to the stand, asking them questions, and presenting  them  with exhibits so the 

exhibits can be introduced and admitted for the judge and/or jury to review. A trial may 

involve only a single witness or it may involve many witnesses. The plaintiff will proceed 

first, followed by the defendant. Sometimes the plaintiff will reserve the opportunity to call 

19 

 

 

 

 

 
 
one  or  more  rebuttal  witnesses  in  response  to  the  defendant’s  presentation.  If  the  case 

 

 

involves a bench trial, then after the parties have completed their presentations the judge 

will provide an opportunity for each side to give a closing argument and will either make 

a ruling in open court or may instead take the matter under advisement and issue a written 

decision.  If  the  case  involves  a  jury  trial,  then  after  the  parties  have  completed  their 

presentations the judge will instruct the jury on the law, after which the parties will give 

their closing arguments to the jury, and the jury will then deliberate in private to reach its 

verdict.  

 

Many different issues can arise in the context of a trial. Some issues are addressed 

before the start of a trial, such as the selection of the jury in a jury trial, the exchange of 

witness  and  exhibit  lists,  and  the  potential  resolution  of  evidentiary  disputes  through 

“Motions in Limine.”  Other issues may arise during a trial, such as issues over the proper 

examination of witnesses, evidentiary objections, and motions for judgment as a matter of 

law.  Still  more  issues  can  arise  at  the  conclusion  of  the  trial  process,  such  as  post-trial 

motions,  bills  of  costs,  and  the  filing  of  appeals  after  the  entry  of  judgment.  Except  as 

outlined  below,  these  issues  are  beyond  the  scope  of  this  Handout.  Thus,  you  should 

consider carefully what the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the District of Maine Local 

Rules, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, and any applicable law may require of 

you so that you do not accidently waive any of your rights during or after trial.  

POST-JUDGMENT PROCEEDINGS 

  Once all issues in the case have been determined, the Clerk’s Office will enter the 

Court’s “Judgment” in accordance with Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures. 

At this time the case in the District Court will be closed and the prevailing parties may 

pursue their costs, while parties dissatisfied with the resolution of the case may pursue an 

appeal.  

The party that ultimately  wins a lawsuit may be awarded certain costs of litigation. 

These costs are assessed by the Clerk of Court and must be paid by the losing party. If the 

BILL OF COSTS 

20 

 

 

 
 
plaintiff  wins  the  case,  a  Bill  of  Costs  form  may  be  completed  and  filed  against  the 

 

 

defendant(s). However, if the plaintiff loses, the defendant(s) may complete and file a Bill 

of Costs form against the plaintiff. These costs, which are explained more fully at 28 U.S.C. 

§ 1920 and Local Rule 54.3, include expenses such as deposition(s), printing, witness fees, 

and other costs. Even if the plaintiff was initially granted leave to file their case without 

the prepayment of fees and costs, costs may be assessed against the plaintiff if the defendant 

prevails. To obtain more information, review the District of Maine’s Guidelines for Filing 

Bills of Costs. 

 

APPEAL 

If  you  intend  to  appeal  the  decision  or  verdict  of  the  judge  or  jury,  you  should 

carefully review the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure (Fed. R. App. P.). There is a 

deadline for filing a “Notice of Appeal.”   See Fed. R. App. P. 4.  

If a party believes a jury verdict or decision rendered by the Court was incorrect, 

and they file an appeal, the appeal will be decided by the United States Court of Appeals 

for the First Circuit in Boston, Massachusetts. An appeal of a decision is commenced by 

completing  and  filing  a  Notice  of  Appeal  form  with  this  Court.  The  Notice  of  Appeal 

should contain a description of the party or parties filing the appeal, a description of the 

judgment or order or the part of the order that you wish to dispute. If more than one party 

wishes to appeal the decision or verdict, each party must file a separate Notice of Appeal.  

There is a fee for filing a Notice of Appeal unless the person filing the appeal has 

already been granted leave to proceed without prepayment of fees and costs. A party who 

has  previously  been  granted  such  leave  need  not  file  a  new  motion  to  proceed  without 

prepayment on appeal, unless the District Court certifies that the appeal was not taken in 

good faith,  See Fed. R. App. P. 24(a)(3).  

 

Several forms are referenced in this Handout. In addition to the forms provided by the 

District of Maine, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has created a number of 

FORMS  

21 

 

 
 
forms,  including  some  specialized  forms  for  certain  types  of  cases.  The  Administrative 

 

 

Office’s forms can be found at http://www.uscourts.gov/forms/pro-se-forms  

When using forms, keep in mind the following: 

1.  Not Legal Advice. No form provides legal advice. No form substitutes for having 

or consulting a lawyer. If you are not a lawyer and are suing or have been sued, it is 

best to have or consult a lawyer if possible. 

2.  No  Guarantee.  Using  a  form  as  a  guide  does  not  guarantee  that  any  pleading  is 

legally or factually correct or sufficient. 

3.  No More Than a Template. Forms offer a template for you to use to file documents 

in the format that lawyers and judges are accustomed to using. However, the core 

content will have to come from you, as the forms do not provide examples of, for 

example, how to set forth the elements of a legal claim in a Complaint, or how to 

brief the merits of an issue in a motion or respond to a motion. To create this content, 

you will need to set forth the facts and the law and explain why they lead to the 

relief you are requesting.  

4.  No  Guidance  on  Timing  or  Parties.  The  forms  do  not  give  any  guidance  on 

important issues like deadlines or which parties should be included. For example, a 

form Complaint will not advise you of any applicable statute of limitation or any 

process  you  may  need  to  go  through  before  filing  a  Complaint,  such  as  in  an 

administrative forum. Nor will a form Complaint advise you about who is the proper 

defendant to assert a particular claim against, if the law requires a particular choice.  

5.  Privacy  Requirements.  Remember  that  Rule  5.2  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil 

Procedure requires that every participant in a case that files a document with the 

Court,  has  to  protect  the  privacy  and  security  concerns  of  themselves  and  others 

when filing documents that will be accessible on the public docket. Under this Rule, 

documents filed with the Court should not contain any person’s full social-security 

number or full birth date; the name of a person known to be a minor; or a complete 

financial-account number. A filing may include only the last four digits of a social-

 

22 

 

 

security number and taxpayer identification number; the year of someone’s  birth; a 

minor’s initials; and the last four digits of a financial-account number.

GUIDANCE CONCERNING SERVICE OF PROCESS

March 2022 

 

 

This  information  is  intended  as  an  informative  and  practical  resource.  It 
cannot take the place of an attorney’s legal advice, nor will it answer all of 
your questions about what you need to do to serve a defendant or crossclaim 
defendant with process.  

 

 

   

       

24 

 
 

   

 

 

 

 
 
All parties facing legal action against them must be notified.  
  
“Service of process” involves serving the defendant(s) with a copy of the 
complaint and is the procedure that officially notifies the defendant(s) 
that a lawsuit has been filed. 
  
This section will explain:  
  

  How to notify the defendant(s) that a lawsuit has been filed.  
  When the court will assist with service. 

•  Is there a time limit for serving the complaint?   

  
Yes. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4 establishes a time limit of 90 days 
following the filing of the complaint with the court for service to be made 
on the defendant(s). See Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for 
more information.  
   
If you do not meet this deadline, the court may dismiss all claims against 
any party who has not been timely served. 
  
  

•  Who is responsible for serving the complaint? Will the court 

assist me with making service?  

If… 

Then… 

You applied for leave to 
proceed without prepaying 
the filing fee and your 
application was granted 

The Clerk’s Office will arrange for 
service of the complaint on the 
defendant(s). However, service may 
not be carried out right away 
because complaints filed by persons 
proceeding without prepayment of 
the filing fee are subject to a 
mandatory screening process 
(pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 
1915(e)(2)), and that process can 
delay service. Service will not 
proceed until the judge issues an 
Order for Service.

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for 
more information regarding service. 
  

•  I paid the filing fee and am therefore responsible for service. 

How do I go about serving the defendant(s)?  
  

A Summons is a form prepared by the plaintiff(s) and issued by the court 
that informs a defendant(s) that he/she is being sued and has a certain 
number of days to respond to the complaint. There are specific rules that 
must be followed as to who may serve a summons.  
  
You may be able to serve the defendant(s) by waiver of service, but only if 
the defendant(s) agree.  
  
It is critical that service of the complaint be made exactly the way the law 
requires. If the complaint is not served properly on the opposing party, it 
could be subject to dismissal by the court.  
  
The below sections will explain how to request the defendant(s) to waive 
service and how to get a summons issued by the court.  
  
  

WAIVER OF SERVICE 
  
 

•  What is a waiver of service?  

   
A waiver of service of summons means that a party voluntarily enters a 
lawsuit without requiring the opposing party to officially serve them with 
a summons. Waiving service means agreeing to give up the right to 
service in person and instead accepting service by mail.   

•  What are the benefits to waiving service?   

   
One benefit to the plaintiff(s) is avoiding the cost and/or inconvenience of 
having the summons served in person on the defendant(s).  
   
One benefit to the defendant(s) is that they will have more time to answer 
the complaint. When service is made by summons, the answer is due 
within 21 days of service. However, when service is waived, the answer is 

26 

 
 

  
 

  

  

 

 
 
due within 60 days from the date the waiver was sent to the opposing 
party.  

 

 

• 

 May I get the defendant(s) to waive service?   

   
You may ask for a waiver of service from any party except  

•  A minor or incompetent person.  
•  The United States government, its agencies, corporations, officers, 

•  A foreign, state, or local government. See Rule 4 of the Maine Rules 

or employees.  

of Civil Procedure. 
   

•  How do I request that the defendant(s) waive service?   

   
To request waiver of service from the defendant(s), you will need two 
forms, which you can obtain from the Clerk’s Office or download from the 
Court’s website: 
   

•  Notice of Lawsuit and Request to Waive Service of Summons form, 

and  

•  Waiver of Service of Summons form.  

   
To request a waiver of service, complete and send the above-listed two 
forms to the defendant(s) by first-class mail, along with a copy of the 
complaint and supporting documents filed with the court. See Rule 4(d) 
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for more information regarding 
waiver of service. 

  
   
Note:   
   
When completing the Notice of Lawsuit and Request to Waive Service of 
Summons Form, you will need to input on the form a time frame for the 
defendant to return to you the signed waiver form (if he/she elects to 
agree to waive service).  
  
When completing the Waiver of Service of Summons Form, you will need 
to input the date the waiver was sent. This is the date that you place 
your completed request to waive service paperwork in the mail to the 
defendant.  
  

27 

  

   

   

  

 

 

 

•  What do I do if a defendant agrees to waive service and sends 
me back the signed Waiver of Service of Summons Form?   

   
If you receive a signed waiver of service form, you do not need to do 
anything further to serve that defendant. Make a copy for your records 
and file the original waiver of service form with the Court.  

•  What if I requested a waiver of service and the form was not 

sent back?  

   
If a defendant does not return a signed waiver of service form by the due 
date you will need to arrange to serve that defendant by one of the other 
means approved by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  
  
  

SERVICE BY SUMMONS 

•  How do I submit a summons to the Clerk’s Office for Issuance?   

  
In order to serve the complaint, you must first get a Summons “issued” 
by the Clerk’s Office. The Clerk’s Office “issues” the summons by affixing

•  What are the pros and cons of electronic filing (ECF)?  

 

 

•  You may email your documents for filing, rather than going to the 

courthouse or paying for postage to mail your filings.  

•  You have until 11:59 p.m. for your documents to be electronically 
received by the court (as opposed to 4:30 p.m. for physical delivery 
of paper filings to the court). 

•  You will receive immediate email notification of activity and 

documents filed in your case instead of having to wait for paper 
copies to arrive in the mail.  

 
 

  
Pros:  
  

  
 Cons:  
  

•  There are hardware and software requirements associated with 

electronic filing.  

•  You must have an email address.  
•  You must have access to a Computer with Internet Access.  
•  Your computer must have software to convert documents from a 

word processor format to portable document format (PDF).  

  
Note: All documents for filing are to be created with word processing 
software and then converted to PDF format. A scanner is helpful when 
submitting documents for electronic filing. A scanner is ONLY to be used 
for exhibits (documents you did not/cannot electronically prepare 
yourself for electronic conversion to PDF format). 
  

•  Once registered for electronic filing, you will no longer receive paper 

service of documents in the mail. You will be responsible for 
checking your e-mail to check for filings and court orders.  

•  How do I start with electronic filing?  

  
You must have a pending case in order to register for electronic filing.  
  

ECF Registration Form 

  
Carefully review pages 2-3 of the ECF Registration Form for Pro Se Filers 
(see above link), which contains detailed instructions for electronic filing 
and conditions you must agree to abide by.  
  

32 

 

   

 

 

 
 
If you agree to comply with the instructions and conditions outlined in 
the registration form, complete the form and return the completed form 
to the Clerk’s Office for processing.  
  
Note: Once registered, you will not receive a login and password from the 
court. Instead, you email your documents for filing and a member of the 
Clerk’s Office will upload the filings to the docket. See pages 2-3 of the 
ECF Registration Form for Pro Se Filers for more detailed instructions on 
how to file electronically.  

 

•  Once registered, how do I receive electronic filings in my case?  

  
Once you are registered for electronic filing, whenever there is docket 
activity in your case you will receive an email. This email is a called a 
Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF).  
  
The NEF will include the caption of your case and the case number. 
There are different scenarios you will see within the NEF:  
  
Docket entries with a PDF 
document attached 

Docket entries without a 
PDF document attached 

Whenever a PDF document is 
attached to a docket entry the NEF 
will include a hyperlink to the 
document. Each docket entry with a 
PDF document attached is assigned 
a document number.  
  
Certain docket entries do not have a 
PDF document associated with 
them. These are called text-only 
entries. For text-only entries the 
document number will not contain a 
hyperlink. 
  
Certain text-only docket entries 
made by the Clerk’s Office are not 
assigned a document number, such 
as the resetting of deadlines.  
  

  
Note regarding docket entries with PDF documents attached:  You are 
permitted one “free look” at each PDF document by clicking on the 
associated document number embedded within the NEF. Any 

33 

 

   

 

 

 
 
subsequent viewing of the document will be subject to PACER fees. See 
the FAQ Is there a way to look up my case without going to the courthouse 
for more information regarding PACER. There is a time limit associated 
with your one free look. You must view the document within 15 days of 
receipt of the NEF. After 15 days you will lose your one free look. To 
avoid fees, the best practice is to save and/or print the document 
immediately after accessing your one free look.  

 

•  Are there certain documents I will be unable to receive 

electronically?  

  
Yes. Certain docket entries may be restricted or sealed. An NEF will still 
be generated to alert you to the docket activity but will contain language 
that the document is sealed from public view or that access to the 
document is restricted to case participants only. You will not be able to 
retrieve these kinds of filings electronically. You will instead be served in 
paper form.  

•  What if I no longer wish to be an electronic filer?  

  
A termination request must be made in writing. The termination request 
may be filed via email to MaineECFIntake@med.uscourts.gov or may be 
filed in paper form with the Clerk’s Office.

GUIDANCE FOR MOTION PRACTICE

•  What is a motion and how do I make or respond to 
one?  

  
A motion is a written request filed by any party to a lawsuit asking the 
judge for some sort of action in the case. Motions are the primary way to 
ask the court to act in a case.  
  
 Local Rule 7 – Motions and Memoranda of Law – also provides detailed 
information regarding motion practice.  
   
Every motion should include the case caption, the specific action 
requested (what you want the court to do) and the reason for the request. 
Motions must be submitted separately from other filings and contain the 
word “motion” in the title. The motion should incorporate a 
memorandum of law, which is a brief written summary in support of 
your request. If you are arguing a legal matter, you should include 
citations to supporting authorities, such as rules, statutes (laws), or case 
law that supports your position.  
   
There are two types of motions, dispositive and non-dispositive.  
   
Dispositive Motions   A dispositive motion asks to resolve entirely 

Non-Dispositive 
Motions  

one or more claims in the case. The most 
common types of dispositive motions are 
motions to dismiss and motions for 
summary judgment. Dispositive motions 
and responses to dispositive motions are 
limited to 20 pages. Replies to dispositive 
motions are limited to 7 pages.   
   
Non-Dispositive motions are all other 
motions filed during the course of the case. 
Common examples are motions to extend 
time to file documents and motions to 
exceed page limits. Non-Dispositive motions 
and responses to Non-Dispositive motions 
are limited to 10 pages. Replies to Non-
Dispositive motions are limited to 7 pages.  
  

   
Note: You do not need to make a motion for clerical things such as 
changing your address on the docket or requesting copies. Motions can 

36 

 
 

 

 
 
delay resolution of your case and divert the attention of the parties and 
the court from preparing for trial.  

 

 

•  How do I respond or reply to a motion?   

   
The party who files a motion is called the moving party. A party who does 
not want the motion to be granted is called the opposing party. The Local 
Rules establish time frames for the opposing party to respond to a 
motion and for the moving party to file any reply. Like a motion, the 
response must have an attached memorandum of law with citations to 
any supporting authorities, such as rules, statutes (laws), or case law 
that supports your position. See Local Rule 7 – Motions and Memoranda 
of Law for more detailed information regarding motion practice.  
   
Response   
   

When a motion is filed by a moving party the 
opposing party has 21 days from the date 
the motion was filed with the court to file 
any response to the motion. If no response is 
filed within the 21 days, the opposing party 
is deemed to have waived objection.  
   
Once the response is received by the Court, 
the filer of the motion will have 14 days to 
file any reply. The reply is the final filing 
permitted before the motion is submitted to 
the judge for consideration.  

•  What if I need more time to file something?   

  

If you need additional time to file a document, you must file a written 
motion with the court. Requests for more time may not be made verbally 
in person or over the phone. It is important to file your written motion 
before the current due date for the document expires.  

  

   

   

   

             

 

  

Reply  
   

37 

 

If there is a deadline set in my case and I have requested an 
• 
extension, but the motion has not yet been ruled on, what should 
I do?   

  
 If your motion to extend time was received and filed by the court, then 
you are protected from making the filing that is the subject of your 
motion until your motion to extend time is ruled on by the judge.  
  
   

•  How long will it take to get a ruling on my motion?  

   
The Clerk’s Office is unable to predict or advise on when rulings will be 
made by the judge.
