  A pro se party is a person who represents himself or herself in a lawsuit. Most pro se parties 
have difficulty understanding the legal process and legal terms that may be used during a case. 

This  Guide  is  intended  to  provide  some  basic  information  to  assist  pro  se  parties  in 
understanding  generally  how  a  legal  case  progresses,  some  of  the  more  common  court 
procedures that a case may involve, and certain responsibilities parties may have in a case.   
The Guide also includes a glossary of basic legal terms that may be used during a case. See 
Appendix A, Glossary of Terms. 

The  Guide  identifies  documents  you  may  need  to  file  in  a  case.  Forms  and  suggested 
formats for these documents are available at the court clerk’s office, in most libraries in the 
state and federal correctional facilities located in New Hampshire, and on the court’s website:   
www.nhd.uscourts.gov. If you need a document that you cannot find at one of these locations, 
you can prepare the form yourself as outlined in Local Rule 5.1. See Local Rule 4.3(c).     
 

ro se parties, like attorneys who practice before this court, must comply with all 
applicable rules and laws, including the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules 
of Evidence, the Local Rules for the United States District Court for the District of New 
Hampshire, the Administrative Procedures for Electronic Case Filing (“ECF”), and other 
rules or laws which apply to your case.

B.  ROLE OF COURT STAFF IN A PRO SE CASE 

The court clerk’s office is open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. each business day. Although 

the clerk’s office staff can provide you with general information about court rules and how 
the process works, they are prohibited by law from: 

  giving you legal advice,   
  explaining how court rules apply to your case,   

-1- 

I.  INTRODUCTION 

  This section will explain: 

  How to use this Pro Se Guide 
  What court staff can and cannot help you with 
  Where you can find the laws and rules that apply to your case 
  Your responsibilities when you represent yourself 
  How to find an attorney who can represent you 

A. 

PURPOSE OF THIS GUIDE 

 

   

You are prohibited from all private communications with the judge assigned to your case.   

This is known as “ex parte communication.” Ex parte communication occurs when one of 
the parties to a lawsuit, or when that party’s attorney, exchanges information with the judge 
without the opposing party being present or without the knowledge and consent of the 
opposing party.   

ecause of this prohibition, a judge will refuse, with very few exceptions, to speak or 
otherwise communicate ex parte with any party, or that party’s attorney, regarding a pending 
case. You may not communicate directly with a judge by letter. Any communication 
between a litigant and the assigned judge must be made by formal pleading, such as a motion 
or objection, and may not be made in letter format. Local Rule 77.6. Additionally, a copy of 
the pleading must be sent either to the opposing party or that party’s counsel, or must be 
presented in person in the presence of all parties to the action. 

C.  ACCESS TO FEDERAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES AND THIS 
COURT’S LOCAL RULES OF PROCEDURE 

As a pro se party, you must become familiar with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 
the Federal Rules of Evidence, this court’s local rules and administrative procedures for ECF.   
These rules explain the general procedural requirements for litigating cases in all federal 
courts and hard copies are available for you to use in the clerk’s office main lobby. They are 
also available on the court’s website.   

he local rules of this court are available for purchase at the clerk’s office for $4.50 for a 
book version. Federal laws can be found in the United States Code (abbreviated as U.S.C.).   
Pro se parties should be aware that the court’s website also contains frequently used forms, 
frequently asked questions, general information, and other useful reference links. 

Many public libraries have computers with internet services that are available to the 
public for reviewing these publications. For incarcerated pro se parties, the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Evidence, and the local rules of this court should be 
available in the library of all federal and state correctional institutions located in New 
Hampshire.

  T

  recommending a course of action,   
  predicting a judge’s decision on any given matter, or   
  explaining the meaning of a court order or judgment.   

 

 
  Also, the judges of this court cannot give you legal advice.

Self-representation carries certain responsibilities and risks that pro se parties should be 
aware of before they file a case. Individuals who are considering representing themselves are 
encouraged to carefully review the risks associated with self-representation and to educate 
themselves regarding potential consequences. Even if you would like to represent yourself, it 
may help to talk to an attorney who can explain some of the risks applicable to your 
particular case. 

Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure prohibits filing lawsuits that are clearly 
frivolous or filed merely for purposes of harassment. If after reviewing your complaint the 
court determines that you have filed a lawsuit for an improper or clearly unnecessary 
purpose, it may impose sanctions against you, including ordering you to pay a fine to the 
court or to pay the legal fees of the person against whom you filed the lawsuit.   

n certain types of cases, if you lose you may be required to pay the legal fees of the 
winning party. In all cases, if you lose you may be required to pay some of the costs the 
winning party incurred in the course of the lawsuit. See this Guide § VI(B), “Bill of Costs.” 

  I

E.  REQUIREMENTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PRO SE 
PARTY 

The following list of responsibilities a pro se party has when pursuing a civil case before 
this court is not intended to be complete and only provides a few examples of the way pro se 
parties are expected to act when filing and pursuing an action in this court: 

 
D.  CAUTIONARY NOTE 

1.  You are required to diligently prosecute your case. Unless and until you obtain an 
attorney to represent you, it is your responsibility to do everything necessary to prepare 
your case for trial. This includes, but is not limited to, responding to discovery requests 
and motions. It is also your responsibility to present your case in court during the trial. 

2.  Do not expect any instructions from the court explaining procedures for pursuing 
your lawsuit. If you fail to follow established procedures, your case may be dismissed for 
failure to properly and diligently pursue your case. 

3.  You are required to give the defendant’s attorney (or the defendant, if the defendant is 
also appearing pro se) copies of all pleadings and motions filed with the court. Likewise, 
the defendant or the defendant’s attorney is required to give you copies of all pleadings 
and motions filed on behalf of the defendant. This requirement is also referred to in the 
rules as “serving” the opposing party with copies of documents filed with the court. 

4.  You must keep the court and the defendant advised of any change in your address or 
telephone number. Failing to do so immediately may result in sanctions, which may 
include the dismissal of your case. 

-3- 

 

 

 

 

 

   

5.  You should keep a copy of all documents filed with the court for your own records.   
Please note that the court clerk’s office charges fifty cents (.50) per page for all copy 
requests and that this fee applies even when the copies are requested by a party to a case. 

.  The Local Rules of this court specify standard formats for filing. You should try to 

follow these rules. But if you do not have access to forms, a word processor, or a 
typewriter you may file documents in a format substantially similar to the prescribed 
format. 

F. 

ALTERNATIVES TO PROCEEDING PRO SE 

Most people who file and pursue litigation in this court employ an attorney, admitted to 

both the New Hampshire Bar and the bar of this court. These attorneys have appeared in 
court, and are familiar with the rules of procedure that govern court processes.   

ome attorneys may be willing to accept a reduced fee or lenient fee payment schedule. 
Other attorneys may be willing to accept your case on a contingent fee basis, which means 
the attorney would receive a fee based upon a percentage of your recovery if you win your 
case and would receive nothing if you do not win. Some attorneys also offer “limited 
representation,” meaning that they may help you evaluate your case, or draft a pleading, 
without requiring that you hire them for the entire case. Local Rule 83.7. Finally, in some 
limited circumstances the other side may be required to pay your attorney’s fees if you win 
your case. 

If you would prefer to have an attorney represent you but you are unable to retain one, 
you should consider contacting the following services which, in some cases, can provide free 
or low-cost legal assistance:

PLEASE NOTE: If you are represented by an attorney, you may not file pleadings in your 
case unless the court grants a motion allowing you to file a pro se pleading, you are filing a 
motion related to the status of your counsel, or your attorney is providing limited 
representation and you are otherwise acting pro se. See Local Rule 4.3(e). 

G.  WHO YOU MAY REPRESENT AS A PRO SE PARTY 

If you do not want an attorney or are unable to find an attorney to represent you, you 
have the right to pursue your claims in court by appearing pro se. As a pro se party, you are 
representing only yourself and presenting only your claims and defenses. Under the law, 
you cannot speak for another person or other entity such as a company, club, association, or 
trust (unless you are the sole beneficiary of the trust). You may not represent a class of 
people in a class action lawsuit. See Local Rule 83.2(d) & 83.6(b).   

 pro se party may not authorize another person who is not an attorney and a member of 
the bar of this court to appear for them. This includes a spouse, relative, or any other party on 
the same side who is not represented by an attorney. This means that each pro se party must 
personally sign the complaint and all additional pleadings they file with the court. Each pro 
se party must also personally appear in court when ordered to do so for conferences, 
hearings, trials, or other matters.   

H.  ELECTRONIC CASE FILING INFORMATION 

The court has the ability to accept pleadings filed electronically through the Internet. A 
non-prisoner who is a party to a civil action and who is not represented by an attorney may 
file a motion to obtain an Electronic Case Filing (ECF) login and password. A form motion 
to obtain a login and password for ECF is available in the clerk’s office and on the 
Frequently Used Forms section of the court’s website. 

efore filing your motion to obtain an ECF login and password, you should make sure 

that you have the computer systems needed to file and receive electronic documents.   

If you are permitted to file electronically, you will be required to follow the court’s 

Supplemental Rules for Electronic Case Filing, which are located in Appendix A to the Local 
Rules. In addition, you will need to obtain a PACER account to use the ECF system. You can 
obtain a PACER account by calling the PACER service center at (800) 676-6856 or (210) 
301-6440 or you may register for a PACER account online at http://www.pacer.gov.

II.  FILING A LAWSUIT 

  This section will explain: 

  How to figure out which court to file your case in 
  What you need to file to start your lawsuit, which may include: 

o  Complaint, Petition for Habeas Corpus, or Motion to Vacate 
o  Filing Fee or Motion to Proceed In Forma Pauperis 
o  Summonses for each defendant 

  The format your documents should follow 
  Where to file your documents 

A. 

JURISDICTION – ARE YOU IN THE RIGHT COURT? 

The United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire is a federal trial court.   

Federal courts only have jurisdiction, or legal authority, to hear certain types of cases. As is 
the case in all federal trial courts, this court is generally authorized only to hear cases that fall 
into the following four categories: 

1.  Those that deal with a question involving the United States Constitution; 

2.  Those that involve questions of federal law (as opposed to state law, unless there is a 
state law claim related to a federal claim being made, in which case the court may agree 
to consider it); 

3.  Those that involve the United States as a party, whether as a plaintiff or defendant; 
and 

4.  Those that involve a dispute among residents of different states with an amount in 
controversy exceeding $75,000. 

If your case does not fall under any of these categories, you should not file it in this court. 

B.  WHAT TO FILE 

1.  Complaint 

 

The complaint is the document that a plaintiff files with the Clerk of Court to initiate 

 
a lawsuit. Only the original is filed with the court. See Appendix D, Sample Complaint 
Format; Appendix E-1, Complaint Form; Appendix E-2, Instructions & Complaint Form 
for Person in Custody. A fillable PDF version of the Complaint Form is also available on 
the court’s website. All complaints should contain: 

-6- 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

a.  A caption or heading specifying the court in which the suit is brought and the 
names of the parties; 

b.  A title, simply “Complaint” or, if a jury trial is requested, the demand should be 
made immediately following the title to read “Complaint with Jury Demand”; 

.  A numbered paragraph (or paragraphs if there is more than one plaintiff) 
containing the name and address of (each) plaintiff; 

  c

d.  A numbered paragraph (or paragraphs if there is more than one defendant) 
containing the name and address of (each) defendant; 

e.  A numbered paragraph stating why the court has jurisdiction, or legal authority, to 
hear this case (see explanation of “jurisdiction” in Section II(A) of this guide); 

f.  Numbered paragraphs each containing a statement of those facts that are alleged 
to have caused the damage claimed.   

  These allegations, or claims, should be concise and clearly written.   
  There should be a separate numbered paragraph for each factual allegation 

  The statement of facts should include a description of what the defendant(s) 
did or failed to do and how those acts or omissions caused injury or damage, 
as well as a description of any injury sustained and what medical treatment, if 
any, was required.   
It is important to be as specific as possible in stating the facts.     

 
  Names, dates, and events should be described accurately and as succinctly as 

made.   

possible.   

  Failure to allege facts demonstrating that each defendant was personally 

involved in and/or responsible for the alleged incident or harm may result in 
dismissal of that defendant or the case; 

g.  A closing or final paragraph, which is not numbered (note: this is the only 
paragraph in the complaint that is not numbered), outlining the relief being asked of 
the court. This can be money or something the plaintiff wants the court to do to 
correct the situation (or both); and 

h.  The plaintiff’s original signature over the plaintiff’s printed/typed name (followed 
by the words “pro se”), address, and phone number. If there is more than one 
plaintiff, the complaint must contain an original signature for each plaintiff.

A $402.00 fee ($350.00 filing fee plus $52.00 administrative fee) is required 
when filing a complaint. You may use a credit or debit card, money order, cashier’s 
check, or cash to pay the filing fee. Cashier’s checks and money orders should be 
made payable to “Clerk, U.S. District Court.” A personal check is not an acceptable 
form of payment. You should note that filing fees sometimes are changed. A current 
list of filing fees is available on the court’s website: www.nhd.uscourts.gov under the 
Court Information tab, and in the clerk’s office. 

b.    Application to Proceed Without Prepaying Fees/Costs-Non-Prisoner Cases 

If you are legally indigent and cannot afford to pay the $402.00 fee, a request to 

waive the fee can be made by filing, along with the complaint, an Application to 
Proceed Without Prepaying Fees or Costs (AO239) (available in the clerk’s office and 
on the court’s website). The application will be submitted to a magistrate or district 
judge for approval. The court may require you to file additional documents to support 
your declaration that you are unable to pay the filing fee. See Local Rule 4.2(a)(1). 

f the application is denied by a magistrate judge, you may appeal the ruling to a 

district judge, or if it was denied by a district judge you may be able to appeal it to the 
court of appeals; otherwise, the filing fee must be paid. If the application is granted, 
the filing fee will be waived. You remain responsible, however, for all other costs 
associated with the litigation unless an application for an additional waiver is made 
by motion and granted by a judicial officer of this court. See Appendix C, Filing 
Requirements. 

c.  Application to Proceed Without Prepaying Fees/Costs-Prisoner Cases 

Pursuant to federal law, when a prisoner files a civil rights or other civil case, the 
plaintiff shall be assessed a fee of $402.00. If unable to pay the fee, the plaintiff must 
file, along with the complaint, an Application to Proceed Without Prepaying Fees or 
Costs (AO239), a Certificate of Custodial Institution Form, and a Prisoner Litigation 
Reform Act Consent Form (all forms available in the clerk’s office and on the court’s 
website).    Unless the court determines that the complaint presents an emergency 
requiring immediate court action, no action will be taken on the complaint until all of 
these forms have been filed.   

nce these forms are filed, the application will be submitted to either a magistrate 

or district judge for consideration. If the judge grants the application, the judge will 
assess an initial partial filing fee that will be taken from the prisoner's inmate account. 
Thereafter, prison officials will deduct 20% of each preceding month’s income 
credited to the prisoner’s inmate account and will transfer those monies to the Clerk

of Court until the filing fee is paid in full. Because the $52.00 administrative fee does 
not apply to prisoners granted leave to proceed without prepaying fees or costs, the 
amount of the filing fee that must be paid is $350.00.   

f the judge denies the prisoner’s application, a $402.00 fee must be paid or an 

appeal of the denial of application may be taken to either a district judge, if the 
decision had been made by a magistrate judge, or the court of appeals.   

f the application is granted, the plaintiff is still responsible for all other costs 
associated with the litigation, unless an application for additional waiver is made by 
motion and granted by a judicial officer. See Appendix C, Filing Requirements. 

  I

  I

The plaintiff is liable for the full filing fee regardless of the outcome of the case.   

Therefore, once the initial payment toward the filing fee is made, if the complaint is 
dismissed for any reason prior to collection of the full filing fee, the court will 
continue to collect money from the prisoner’s trust account as ordered until the entire 
filing fee is paid. If the prisoner is released from custody, the filing fee still must be 
paid in full. If the initial filing fee is not paid, the action will be dismissed without 
prejudice and the filing fee will not be collected. 

The filing fee for a habeas corpus petition is $5.00, not $350 plus the $52 
administrative fee. If an application to proceed without prepayment is granted in a 
habeas case, the petitioner will not be required to pay any portion of the $5 fee. If the 
request is denied, the petitioner must pay the fee in one payment and not in 
installments. 

All plaintiffs, whether or not they have paid the filing fee or intend to proceed without 

prepaying fees or costs, must complete and submit a summons form (except for the date 
and signature line) for each defendant at the same time the complaint is filed. See Local 
Rule 4.1. Summons forms are available at the clerk’s office and on the court’s website. 
See Appendix F, Sample Summons Form.   

he plaintiff must provide the most complete known name and address for each 
defendant. It is the plaintiff’s responsibility to determine the identity of all defendants. If 
any summons form is missing for any defendant, the plaintiff will be directed to fill out a 
summons form and submit it to the clerk’s office, or that defendant may be dismissed 
from your case.

Amount in Controversy Exceeding $75,000 (Jurisdiction is Based on Diversity of 
Citizenship) 

As noted in Section II (A) above, you may file a civil case in federal court when you 

have a claim based on a violation of the United States Constitution or federal statute, 
which is known as federal question jurisdiction, or if you have a claim against a resident 
of a different state and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, which is known as 
diversity jurisdiction. If the right to file in federal court is based on diversity jurisdiction, 
you must file a Diversity Disclosure Statement. See Local Rule 7.1.1. A Diversity 
Disclosure Statement is available at the clerk’s office and on the court’s website. See 
Appendix G, Diversity Disclosure Statement Form.

FILING REQUIREMENTS - FORMAT OF FILINGS 

The terms “filings” or “pleadings” refer generally to all documents filed with the court.   
Filings must be on 8 x 11 inch paper of good quality. All pleadings shall be submitted in the 
English language unless a translation is provided. Filings should have no less than one inch 
margins, with page numbers on the bottom center of each page, and be double-spaced. They 
must be stapled or otherwise attached but shall not be permanently bound. All affidavits must 
include the title of the document they support or oppose, for example, “Affidavit in Support 
of Objection to Motion to Dismiss.” See Local Rule 5.1. 

All motions or other requests for judicial action must be submitted in pleading format and 

not in letter format. Local Rule 77.6. Although it is preferable that pleadings be typewritten 
(in a font size no smaller than ten characters per inch or, if a proportionately spaced font is 
used, no less than twelve point), handwritten documents are acceptable. So the court may 
fully understand the claims, however, care should be taken with handwritten documents to 
ensure that they are clear and legible. In the case of prisoners, a pleading will not be rejected 
for failure to conform to the exact requirements outlined here, but all reasonable efforts 
should be made to comply with the format required by court rules. 

  All filings must: 

1.  Contain the caption of the case, including the name of the court, the parties, and the 
complete civil action number assigned to the case (once assigned); 

2.  Contain a title describing the contents of the filing; 

3.  Identify the party on whose behalf the filings are made; 

4.  Include the plaintiff’s address and telephone number (if any); 

5.  Contain the original signature of each plaintiff, with the words “pro se” following 
the signature; and 

 

-11- 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

6.  Contain a certificate of service (for paper filings other than the original complaint or 
petition). Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(a), every pleading, 
correspondence or other document filed after the original complaint, unless it is being 
filed ex parte (without the knowledge or notice to the opposing party), must be served 
upon each of the parties who have appeared in the case. Each such pleading must contain 
a certificate of service that states the name and address of the attorney or party served, the 
manner of service, and the date of service. See Local Rule 5.1. This lets the court know 
that the other parties have been served with a copy of the same document filed with the 
court. Note that you do not need a certificate of service for any party served electronically 
using the court's electronic filing system if you have permission to file documents 
electronically in the case. An example of a certificate of service is: 

I certify that a copy of the foregoing (name of the pleading/document) 

was mailed/hand delivered to (name of defendant(s) or counsel for the 
defendant(s)) at (address(es)) on (date). 

Original signature, pro se 
Typed name, address and phone number 

D.  WHERE TO FILE 

The complaint, filing fee or Application to Proceed Without Prepaying Fees or Costs (and 

any supporting material), should be filed with the clerk’s office at the following address: 

Office of the Clerk of Court 
United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire 
Warren B. Rudman United States Courthouse 
55 Pleasant Street - Room 110 
Concord, New Hampshire 03301-3941 

The documents may be mailed or delivered in person. There is also a 24-hour depository 
located at the south entrance of the Cleveland Building. If you utilize the 24-hour depository, 
be sure to stamp the pleading, not just the envelope, with the date/time stamp available at the 
24-hour depository. Pleadings left in the 24-hour depository are retrieved once daily, between 
7:30 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. No filings or letters should ever be mailed directly to the judge 
unless a party is specifically ordered to do so. 

Upon filing, all civil cases will be assigned at random to one of the judges of this court.   

Assignments are made randomly so that no party or lawyer may choose the judge to whom 
the case is assigned.   

 

-12- 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

   

If the case is initially assigned to a magistrate judge, the parties must complete and file a 
"Notice of Assignment to United States Magistrate Judge and Consent Form" (available on-
line and in the clerk's office) and shall indicate whether all parties consent to the case 
assignment to a magistrate judge. If the parties do not consent, the case will be reassigned to 
a district judge. See Local Rule 73.1(b)(2). If the case is initially assigned to a district court 
judge, the parties can voluntarily agree to reassign the case to a magistrate judge by filing a 
"Notice, Consent, and Order of Reference Form" (available on-line and in the clerk’s office) 
stating that all the parties consent to the reassignment. See Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 
73(b); Local Rule 73.1(b).

A. 

FILING FEE PAID   

If a pro se plaintiff pays the filing fee at the time the complaint is filed, the clerk’s office 

 
will sign and seal the summons(es) against the defendant(s) and return the summons(es) to 
the plaintiff, who must serve a summons on each defendant to the action. The only exception 
to this rule is if you are incarcerated AND are suing a government official. In that case, you 
should wait for the judge to complete a preliminary review, after which you will receive an 
order from the court and should follow the instructions in the order regarding service.     

All other pro se plaintiffs who have paid the filing fee must serve the summons and 
complaint on the defendant(s) within 90 days from the date of filing of the complaint, or as 
otherwise ordered, or the case will be subject to dismissal. You must comply with Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 4 or the case can be dismissed for failure to effect proper 
service.   

Summons forms are available at the clerk’s office and on the court’s website. See 

Appendix F, Sample Summons Form. If you are not incarcerated and you have paid the filing 
fee, you may immediately serve the complaint on the defendants.   

Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires you to file proof with the court 

that the complaint has been served on the defendant(s). On the back of the summons is a 
section referred to as the return of service which must be completed by the person who 
served the summons. The person serving the summons must leave a copy of both the 
summons form and the complaint with the defendant(s). The return of service must 
specifically identify the person who served the summons, the name(s) of the person(s) 
served, and the date(s) and time of service. You must then file the original summons form 
with the completed return of service with the court. 

PRO SE PLAINTIFFS PROCEEDING WITHOUT PREPAYMENT 

B. 
OF FEES OR COSTS   

If you are proceeding without prepayment of fees or costs, the court will arrange for 
service on the defendants. After conducting the preliminary review of a complaint, if the 
judge finds that the complaint states a claim upon which relief may be granted, the clerk’s

The judge will then, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(c)(2), appoint a person to 
make service - usually the Clerk of Court or the United States Marshals Office - who shall be 
responsible for doing so. In appropriate cases, a judge may order an alternative means of 
achieving service in accordance with all applicable laws and rules. 

C. 

SECTION 2254 PETITIONS AND § 2255 MOTIONS 

  After the filing of a petition or motion submitted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254 or 28 
U.S.C. § 2255, the magistrate judge or a district judge will review the pleading to determine 
whether it sufficiently states a claim entitling the petitioner to relief. If the judge finds that it 
does, an order will issue directing that the motion or petition be served upon and answered by 
the respondent(s). 

 

-15- 

 

   

   

A defendant’s answer must state any defenses to the complaint and either admit or 

deny the specific facts contained in the complaint. A defendant may choose to file a 
motion to dismiss the complaint instead of filing an answer. If a defendant fails to answer 
or otherwise defend the complaint in a timely fashion, the clerk may enter a default, 
which means that the plaintiff has prevailed on the claims made in the complaint. 

2.  Answer Deadlines 

If service is made on the defendant(s) by summons, the defendant(s) will have 

twenty-one (21) days from the date of service of the complaint to file an answer with the 
court. If the United States or a federal official is a defendant, the answer deadline is sixty 
(60) days from the date of service.   

When the magistrate judge has ordered service of a complaint after conducting a 
preliminary review pursuant to Local Rule 4.3(d)(1)(B) or 4.3(d)(2), or the magistrate or 
district judge has ordered an answer to a petition or motion filed pursuant to Rule 4 of the 
Rules Governing § 2254 Cases or Rule 4 of the Rules Governing § 2255 Cases, the order 
shall set an answer deadline. 

s noted in Section II (A) above, a plaintiff may file a civil case in federal court when 

the claim is based on a violation of the United States Constitution or federal statute, 
which is known as federal question jurisdiction, or if the claim is against a resident of a 
different state and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, which is known as 
diversity jurisdiction. If the plaintiff’s right to file in federal court is based on diversity 
jurisdiction, you must file a Diversity Disclosure Statement. See Local Rule 7.1.1. A

IV. PROCEEDINGS AFTER SERVICE 

  This section will explain: 

  What happens after the defendant is served and proof of service is filed 
  How to ask the court to take a certain action in your case 
  How to ask the court for permission to add to or change your complaint 
  How to object to another party’s request 
  What happens during discovery 
  How you and the court will prepare for trial   

A.  ANSWER   

1.  Generally 

 

 

 

 

   

A motion is a type of pleading, filed by any party to a lawsuit, which requests that the 

court take certain action. Motions are the primary way to ask the court to take some 
action in a case. 

A motion should be made in writing, state the specific reasons for the request made, 

and state what relief or order is being sought. All motions must contain the word 
“motion” in the title. You may not combine multiple motions seeking separate and 
distinct relief into a single motion. Separate motions must be filed.   

 motion must also contain a statement either incorporating an attached 

memorandum of law or a statement explaining why a memorandum is not necessary. If 
you are arguing a legal matter, you should include citations to supporting authorities, 
such as rules, statutes (laws), or case law that supports your position. A memorandum 
filed in support of a nondispositive motion must be less than fifteen (15) pages. A 
memorandum filed in support of a dispositive motion must be less than twenty-five (25) 
pages.   

Appendix H-1 is a sample motion format that incorporates all the necessary elements 
of a motion. This format should be used to avoid possible striking (nonconsideration) of a 
motion because it fails to satisfy the filing requirements. Appendix H-2 is a Motion Form. 
A fillable PDF version of the Motion Form is also available on the court’s website.   

ll motions filed in paper must be signed by the party submitting the motion and 

must contain a certificate of service indicating the date and manner in which the motion 
was served on the defendant(s). See Appendix C, Filing Requirements. Service of 
motions is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.     

he district judge or magistrate judge deciding the motion will ordinarily issue a 
written order without scheduling a hearing on the motion. Hearings are scheduled at the 
discretion of the court. 

Motions will be decided by the judge assigned to the case. Some motions, however, 

may be referred by a district judge to a magistrate judge for consideration. When a 
dispositive motion is referred to a magistrate judge for consideration, the magistrate 
judge will issue a report and recommendation that the motion be either granted or denied 
and stating the reasons for the recommendation. The report and recommendation is

forwarded to the district judge assigned to the case and copies are sent to the parties. As a 
party, you have fourteen (14) days to file any objections you have to the report and 
recommendation. All objections received within the specified time are forwarded to the 
district judge. The district judge reviews the report and recommendation and any 
objections that have been filed and will subsequently issue an order that adopts or rejects, 
in whole or in part, the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation.   

f the motion referred to a magistrate judge is nondispositive, the magistrate judge 
will issue an order granting or denying the motion, or directing other relief as appropriate. 
You may file an objection within fourteen (14) days of being served with a copy of the 
order on a non-dispositive matter. 

Motions can delay resolution of your case and divert the party and the court’s 

attention from preparing for trial. For this reason, motions should not be made frivolously 
or without reason, otherwise, the court may order sanctions against you. Also please note 
that, if you are represented by an attorney, you may not file pleadings in your case unless 
the court grants a motion allowing you to file a pro se pleading, you are filing a motion 
related to the status of your counsel, or an attorney has been granted leave to provide you 
with limited representation and the filing is outside the scope of the limited 
representation. See Local Rule 4.3(e). 

  I

 

2.  Motion to Amend 

 
If you would like to add to or change your complaint, you must file a motion to 
amend the complaint. A motion to amend shall: (1) identify any new facts, claims, or 
parties, (2) explain why any new facts, claims, or parties were not included in the original 
filing, and (3) include as an attachment your proposed amended complaint. The motion to 
amend must include a complete amended complaint as it is impermissible to incorporate 
your original complaint by reference, except with the permission of the court. See 
Appendix C, Filing Requirements. 

3.  Motion to Dismiss 

A motion to dismiss may be filed for any of the reasons set forth in Federal Rule of 

Civil Procedure 12(b). The motion to dismiss must state the specific facts and legal 
arguments supporting the stated reasons for dismissal. Such reasons commonly include 
the following: the court lacks jurisdiction to decide the subject matter of the case, service 
of process was not sufficient, or the complaint failed to state a claim that the law 
recognizes as enforceable. 

-18- 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

4.  Motion for Summary Judgment 

A motion for summary judgment is filed by a party pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil 

Procedure 56 when there are undisputed facts supporting part or all of the case. The 
moving party must state the legal reasons they are entitled to succeed on some or all of 
the issues in the case and state the reasons why they should succeed. If the court finds 
that there is no genuine disagreement over the facts important to one or more of the issues 
in the case, those issues may be disposed of by the court’s ruling on the motion. 

  A memorandum must be filed with a summary judgment motion that contains a short 
and concise statement of material (important) facts and appropriate case law citations. 
See Local Rule 56.1(a). The material facts you rely on must be supported by evidence, 
such as affidavits, depositions, answers to discovery requests, or other documents as 
stated in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. All properly supported material facts in the 
motion for summary judgment may be deemed admitted by the adverse party unless that 
adverse party files an objection, denies the facts in the motion for summary judgment and 
submits evidence (such as affidavits, depositions, answers to discovery requests, or other 
documents) that contradicts those facts. See Local Rule 56.1(b); See also Appendix A, 
Glossary of Terms, “Affidavit.” 
 

In opposing a motion for summary judgment, it usually is not enough for the 

objecting party to merely deny the facts in the other party’s motion. The responding party 
must present to the court evidence, such as affidavits, depositions, answers to 
interrogatories, or documents, which show that the facts are in dispute.     

 

5.  Motion to Extend 

A motion to extend any deadline shall state whether the extension would result in the 

continuance of any hearing, conference, or trial, and the motion shall state the proposed 
extended date. A motion to extend deadlines set in the discovery plan shall include a 
completed Civil Form 3 of the Local Rules. See LR 7.2(a); see also Appendix C, Filing 
Requirements.   

6.   Motion for Expedited Ruling 

On rare occasions a true emergency exists such that a party may need the court to take 
immediate action on a motion. When this occurs, the party filing the motion must note in 
the title of the caption that they are requesting expedited relief and they must explain 
within the motion why expedited relief is needed. See LR 7.1(f). 

-19- 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

7.  Motion for Reconsideration 

A motion to reconsider an order of the court (other than a motion governed by 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59 or 60) must be filed within fourteen (14) days from 
the date of the order in question. 

8.  Response Time 

To determine the date that a response to a motion is due, refer to Appendix B, Time 

Computation Chart. See LR 7.2(d). 

9.  Appeal of an Order Entered by the Court While Case is Pending 

Although most orders issued while a case is still ongoing cannot be appealed 
immediately, there are some exceptions to this general rule. The Federal Rules of 
Appellate Procedure explain when an order is appealable and you should consult those 
rules before filing a notice of appeal. If you file a notice of appeal, you will be required to 
pay a $505 filing fee with this court unless you are permitted to proceed without 
prepayment of fees or costs. If you are permitted to proceed without prepayment of fees 
or costs on appeal, you may still be required to pay certain costs associated with your 
appeal. Filing a notice of appeal prematurely may delay final resolution of your case and 
may add unnecessary expense to your case. For more information regarding appeals, see 
section VII, C of this Guide. 

C.  OBJECTIONS 

 

 

 

Objections to motions, like the motions themselves, must meet certain requirements. To 

assist you in the preparation of objections, Appendix I is a sample objection format that 
incorporates all the necessary elements of an objection. This format should be used when 
preparing objections. See also Appendix C, Filing Requirements. 

Like a motion, each objection must have an attached memorandum of law with citations 
to supporting authorities or must contain a statement explaining why a memorandum is not 
necessary. A memorandum filed in opposition to a nondispositive motion shall not exceed 
fifteen (15) pages. A memorandum filed in opposition to a dispositive motion shall not 
exceed twenty-five (25) pages. See Appendix C, Filing Requirements. 

-20- 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

D.  REPLIES 

A reply memorandum is permitted in response to an objection to a dispositive motion, but 

not in response to an objection to a nondispositive motion without prior permission of the 
court. No surreply (i.e. a reply to a reply) memorandum is permitted without prior permission 
of the court. A reply memorandum on a dispositive motion shall not exceed ten (10) pages, 
while a reply memorandum on a non-dispositive motion and a surreply memorandum may 
not exceed five (5) pages. 

E.  REDACTION OF PERSONAL IDENTIFIERS 

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2 and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 49.1 require 

that all parties refrain from including, or shall partially redact where inclusion is necessary, 
the following personal identifiers from all filings with the court: social security numbers; 
names of minor children; dates of birth; financial account numbers; and address information 
in criminal cases. 

F. 

DISCOVERY PLAN AND PRELIMINARY PRETRIAL 

After the defendant has either answered the complaint or filed a dispositive motion, in 
most cases the court will schedule a preliminary pretrial conference. Pursuant to Federal Rule 
of Civil Procedure 26, at least twenty-one (21) days before the preliminary pretrial 
conference the parties must confer and develop a proposed discovery plan. Within fourteen 
(14) days thereafter, the discovery plan must be filed with the court. Habeas corpus 
petitioners and incarcerated pro se parties are exempt from this requirement. Fed. R. Civ. P. 
26(a)(1)(B). For more specific information regarding the contents of the discovery plan, see 
Civil Form 2 of the Local Rules. If the discovery plan is approved, the preliminary pretrial 
may be cancelled and the parties notified. 

At the preliminary pretrial hearing, all parties should be prepared to discuss discovery 
issues such as expected interrogatories, requests for admission, depositions, use of experts, 
mediation and/or Alternative Dispute Resolution, a trial date, and other case-related issues as 
fully explained in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(c). The district judge or magistrate 
judge will thereafter approve a discovery plan setting forth deadlines. The parties must 
adhere to those deadlines unless otherwise ordered by the court. 

A trial date will be set within the discovery plan and a separate trial notice will be sent 

out. The notice will include the deadline for filing final pretrial statements as well as the 
dates for the final pretrial conference and trial.

G.  DISCOVERY 

1.  Generally 

Discovery is the process of collecting the evidence necessary to support a claim. 
Evidence may be gathered from the opposing party, from non-parties or from public 
records. The parties shall not file discovery materials with the court unless ordered to do 
so or as appropriate in support of a motion for summary judgment or an objection to a 
motion for summary judgment. Motions to the court regarding discovery disputes are 
governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37 and Local Rule 37.1. 

2.  Initial Disclosures 

For nonincarcerated/non-habeas plaintiffs, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a) 

requires the disclosure of certain materials to the adverse party without a discovery 
request or separate court order. The specific materials and information to be disclosed, as 
well as the deadlines for disclosure, are contained in the rule and should be carefully 
reviewed. Failure to comply with discovery rules and orders in a case may result in the 
dismissal of an action and/or other sanctions. 

3.  Depositions 

A deposition is a procedure in which testimony of any witness, whether or not a 
party, is taken under oath and recorded before the trial begins. The witness, called the 
deponent, is examined by the party who asked for the deposition, and then the adverse 
party may cross-examine. The rules and procedures governing depositions are located at 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 27 through 32. 

 

 

4.  Interrogatories   
 
  Up to twenty-five (25) written questions, called interrogatories, may be used to 
discover information from parties in the action. Permission from the court can be sought 
to request additional interrogatories. Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and 
fully, in writing, and under oath. If an interrogatory is objected to, the objecting party 
shall state the reasons for the objection and shall answer to the extent the interrogatory is 
not objectionable. The answers are to be signed by the person making them and the 
objections signed by the attorney or pro se party making them. The interrogatories shall 
be answered within thirty (30) days after they are served. Parties are required to 
supplement their answers to interrogatories as additional information becomes available 

-22- 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 34, a written request to produce records, 

letters, contracts, or other materials, inspect or copy a document, or permit entry upon 
designated land or other property in the possession or control of the party upon whom the 
request is served, may be served on any party. The request shall specify a reasonable 
time, place, and manner of making the inspection or performing the related acts. The 
party upon whom the request is served shall serve a written response within thirty (30) 
days. The response shall state whether the inspection or related activities will be 
permitted as requested. If the request is objected to, the reasons for the objection shall be 
stated. The requesting party may seek, by filing a motion to compel, a court order 
requiring production. A person not a party to the action may be compelled to produce 
documents or things as provided in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45. 

as provided by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(e)(1). The rules and procedures 
governing interrogatories are contained in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 33. 

.  Production of Documents

6.  Physical or Mental Examinations 

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 35, when the mental or physical 

condition of a party or of a person in the custody or under the legal control of a party is in 
controversy, the court in which the action is pending may order the party to submit to a 
physical or mental examination. The order may be made only on motion for good cause 
shown and upon notice to the person to be examined and to all parties and shall specify 
the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the examination and the person by 
whom it is to be made. A mental or physical examination may be conducted by any 
“suitably licensed or certified examiner.” Generally, the party seeking such a report will 
incur the cost for the examination.   

7.  Requests for Admission 

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 36, a party may serve upon any other 
party a written request to admit the truth of certain matters within the scope of Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(1). The matter is admitted unless, within thirty (30) days 
after service of the request, the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the 
requesting party a written answer or objection signed by the party. Failure to answer 
constitutes an admission. The party who requests the admission may file a motion with 
the court to determine the sufficiency of the answers or objections. The court may order 
an answer, amendments to answers given, or even that the matter be deemed admitted.

H. 

FINAL PRETRIAL STATEMENTS 

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(3) and Local Rule 16.2 outline the information that 
is to be included in, and filings to accompany, a final pretrial statement. This document must 
be filed thirty (30) days before trial. Objections to final pretrial statements are governed by 
Local Rule 16.2(d). 

I. 

FINAL PRETRIAL CONFERENCE 

The final pretrial conference will be held approximately ten (10) days prior to trial. This 

conference, held with the trial judge and the parties, will provide an opportunity to discuss 
the following: issues that will be tried, admissibility of exhibits, pending motions, issues 
concerning jury selection, witnesses, possibility of settlement, length of trial, and any other 
relevant issues. The court may enter a final pretrial order outlining issues discussed. 

J. 

TRIAL WITNESSES 

No later than twenty-one (21) days before trial, parties authorized to without prepaying 

fees or costs must file a motion containing the name, address, and a brief statement of the 
expected testimony of each witness they would like to subpoena for trial. If the stated 
testimony of a witness is not material or is repetitive, the court may decline to order the 
issuance of a subpoena for that witness. The court will prepare an order specifying what 
subpoenas may be issued. Parties proceeding without prepayment should see Local Rule 
45.2. 

K.  TRIAL EXHIBITS/EXHIBIT LIST AND FINAL WITNESS LIST 

Trial exhibits, an exhibit list, and a final witness list are to be filed in the clerk's office 
seven (7) days before trial begins. See LR 83.14. Detailed instructions for the marking of 
exhibits are available from the clerk's office or on the court’s website. 

L. 

JUROR QUESTIONNAIRES 

The clerk's office will maintain and make available a complete listing of jurors who will 

be in attendance the day of jury selection as well as a questionnaire for each juror. The 
questionnaire is a document provided by the clerk's office, and completed by each juror, that 
asks for certain personal information. Five (5) working days prior to the first jury selection 
date of each trial period, the list and questionnaires will be made available only to attorneys, 
their agents, and pro se parties actually involved in cases scheduled for trial during that 
period. The questionnaires may not be photocopied or removed from the clerk's office and 
the information in the questionnaires may not be disclosed. Absent leave of the court, after 

-24- 

   

the trial or an appeal, if one is taken, all information taken from the questionnaires must be 

destroyed as required by Local Rule 47.1.

V.   TRIAL 

This section will explain: 

  How a jury is selected 
  How you present your evidence 
  How a decision is reached 

A trial is the examination of evidence and applicable law by a judge or a jury who then 

decide what facts to accept, apply the law to those facts, and determine the result in the case. At a 
trial, the plaintiff attempts to prove the claims in support of the relief requested, and the opposing 
party attempts to prove the opposite. Each party will have the opportunity to present their side of 
the case. At the conclusion of the evidence, if the case was tried before a jury, the jury will 
render its verdict. If there was no jury and a bench trial was held, the judge will render a 
decision. Often, a decision rendered by a judge will be issued at a future date in the form of a 
written order. Of course, at any time before trial, if the matter is disposed of by motion, 
settlement, or otherwise, no trial will be necessary. Local Rule 39.1 sets forth guidelines for the 
length and limits of trial, conduct of counsel/pro se litigants in the courtroom, and many of the 
topics discussed below. 

A. 

JURY SELECTION 

A jury trial begins with the judge giving a brief outline of what the case is about, reading 
witness lists, introducing counsel and the parties, and conducting the voir dire (a preliminary 
examination concerning the eligibility of a prospective juror to serve on the jury). The 
courtroom clerk will then randomly select jurors. After each selection, the judge will ask the 
juror if there are any concerns with or responses to any of the questions asked. If so, the 
judge will question the juror individually at the bench in the presence of counsel and any pro 
se party. After the court has completed its examination, challenges to a prospective juror for 
cause may be made at the bench. A challenge for cause may be allowed if the prospective 
juror lacks a qualification required by law or cannot be fair and impartial in deciding the 
case. This process will continue until the appropriate number of jurors has been selected for 
the panel. 

The parties will then exercise their peremptory challenges (limited to three per side) at 
the clerk's bench out of the hearing of prospective jurors. Peremptory challenges are requests 
by a party that a certain prospective juror not sit on the panel and, unlike challenges for 
cause, no reason need be stated to support the challenge. Jurors who are the subject of a 
peremptory challenge shall be excused. The remaining jurors shall comprise the trial panel, 
will hear the evidence, and will render their verdict at the conclusion of the case. The court 
will seat a jury of not fewer than six persons and all jurors participate in the verdict. 

-26- 

 

   

 

 

   

.  VIEW AND PRE-VIEW STATEMENTS 

  A view to a location relevant to the case may be taken if the judge finds that such a view 
will be helpful to the judge or jury in understanding the evidence presented. If a party wants 
to have a view in the case, that party must specially request it in the final pretrial statement. 
The court will determine at the final pretrial conference whether a view will be allowed. If a 
view is permitted in a jury trial, each party will have the opportunity to make brief, 
nonargumentative statements to the jury to alert them to particular points of interest they may 
see at the view. 

C.  OPENING STATEMENTS 

The purpose of an opening statement is to describe the issues in the case and the facts a 

party intends to prove in support of the claims made or defenses raised. The plaintiff’s 
statement is presented first, because the plaintiff has the burden of proving the facts 
supporting the allegations and that the defendant was responsible for the injury or damage 
alleged. Opening statements shall be nonargumentative and no longer than thirty (30) 
minutes unless otherwise ordered. 

D. 

PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE 

The actual presentation of evidence occurs after the opening statements have been 

completed and consists of witness testimony and exhibits. 

1.  Witness Testimony 

Not all witness testimony is admissible in a trial. It is important that the pro se party 
be very familiar with those portions of the Federal Rules of Evidence which relate to the 
admissibility of witness testimony prior to attempting to introduce such evidence at trial. 

a.  Direct Examination 

b.  Cross-Examination 

When an attorney or pro se party calls a person to the witness stand and asks 
questions, it is called direct examination. The plaintiff is first in presenting witnesses. 

When the other side attempts to discredit the testimony given by a witness after 

the direct examination, it is called cross-examination. 

-27- 

 

  B

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

c.  Redirect Examination 

The initial examiner may elect to re-question the witness on the points covered by 

the cross-examination. This is called redirect examination. 

Exhibits properly presented to the court and admitted into evidence will be considered 

by the judge or jury deciding the case. Because the admission of exhibits is determined 
by the judge, it is important for a pro se party to comply with the Federal Rules of 
Evidence concerning the proper admission of exhibits. 

2.  Exhibits 

3.  Objections 

 
In order to preserve an argument for appeal, you must give the judge an opportunity 
to consider your argument when the basis for it first arises. If you believe that testimony 
or evidence the other party is trying to admit should not be allowed based on the Federal 
Rules of Evidence, you must raise your objection to the testimony or evidence with the 
judge before the testimony is given or the evidence is introduced. If you do not do so, you 
may later be deemed to have waived your opportunity to challenge the admission of the 
testimony or evidence. 

E.  CLOSING ARGUMENTS 

The purpose of the closing argument is to allow each side to summarize the evidence 
presented, to explain how the evidence is relevant to the issues in the case, and to tell the jury 
for whom they should return a verdict based on all the evidence they have heard at trial. The 
closing argument can reiterate crucial testimony that was presented and can highlight why 
the plaintiff's or defendant's version of the event should or should not be believed. In a 
closing argument, a party is not permitted to include personal opinions about the facts or the 
evidence and must be certain not to inadvertently do so. The parties must make their 
arguments based on facts actually presented in evidence during the trial and reasonable 
conclusions that can be drawn from those facts. The defendant shall deliver the first closing 
argument. The plaintiff argues last. 

-28- 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

CHARGE TO THE JURY, DELIBERATIONS, AND VERDICT 

After each side has had the opportunity to present testimony and evidence, the judge 
delivers legal instructions, or a charge, to the jury. The charge explains the law that the jury 
should apply to decide the case. The parties will have an opportunity to discuss the jury 
instructions with the judge prior to the charge. After the charge is delivered, the jury will then 
go to a secure room to conduct its deliberations. Once the jury has reached a verdict, the 
court will be notified. If a jury is unable to reach a verdict, the judge will declare a mistrial 
and the case must then be tried again before a new jury. 

 

-29- 

 
F. 

   

   

The party that ultimately wins a lawsuit may be awarded certain costs of litigation. These 

 
costs are assessed by the court and must be paid by the losing party. If the plaintiff wins the 
case, a Bill of Costs may be filed against the defendant(s). If the plaintiff loses, however, the 
defendant(s) may file a Bill of Costs against the plaintiff. These costs, which are explained 
more fully at 28 U.S.C. § 1920, include expenses such as deposition costs, money for 
printing, witness fees, and costs incurred for summonses and subpoenas. Even if the plaintiff 
was granted leave to file without prepayment of fees or costs, the plaintiff may have to pay 
for the defendant’s costs if the defendant prevails. 

If you win your case, a Bill of Costs form (available in the clerk’s office and on the 
court’s webpage) must be filed with the clerk within twenty-one (21) days after the time for 
appeal has expired. A copy must be served on the opposing attorney or pro se party. The Bill 
of Costs must be supported by a memorandum of law and must be verified by oath stating 
that the items are correct, the costs claimed are allowable by law, the services have been 
actually and necessarily performed, and the disbursements have been necessarily incurred in 
the action or proceeding. An itemization of all costs shall be attached to the Bill of Costs.   

f you lose your case, and the other party files a Bill of Costs, your objection to the Bill 

of Costs is due within fourteen (14) days after service. The Clerk of Court will review 
these submissions and will issue a taxation of costs. The Clerk’s taxation shall be final unless 
modified on review by a judge on a motion filed within seven (7) days after it is issued. The 
rules and procedures related to Bills of Costs are more fully set forth at 28 U.S.C. § 1920, 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54, and Local Rule 54.1. 

  I

 

Once all issues in the case have been disposed of, a document entitled “Judgment” shall 

be entered by the clerk’s office and the case will be closed.

A. 

JUDGMENT 

-30- 

 

 

 

   

If you intend to appeal the decision or verdict of the judge or jury, you should closely 
review the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. These rules are available for review at the 
clerk’s office, at most public libraries, at the libraries of most state and federal correctional 
institutions located in New Hampshire, and online on the website for the United States Court 
of Appeals for the First Circuit at www.ca1.uscourts.gov.   

If a party believes a jury verdict or decision rendered by the court was incorrect, the 
appeal from this court usually lies with the United States Court of Appeals for the First 
Circuit in Boston, Massachusetts. An appeal of a decision is initiated by filing a Notice of 
Appeal in the district court either on a Notice of Appeal form or in a filing with a 
substantially similar format. See Appendix J, Sample Notice of Appeal. A Notice of Appeal 
should contain a description of the party or parties taking the appeal, a description of the 
judgment or order or the part of the order or judgment appealed from, and the name of the 
court to which the appeal is taken. If more than one party wishes to appeal the decision or 
verdict, each party must file a separate notice of appeal. You need to designate the judgment 
and/or appealable order(s) that you want the appellate court to review. If you expressly state 
that you are only appealing part of a judgment or a specific order, then your appeal will be 
limited to that part of the judgment or specific order. 

The fee for filing a Notice of Appeal is $505.00 unless the person taking the appeal has 
been granted leave to proceed without prepayment of fees or costs. Unless the district court 
certifies that the appeal was not taken in good faith, a non-incarcerated party who has 
previously been granted leave to proceed without prepayment in the case need not file a new 
application to proceed without prepayment of fees or costs on appeal. Fed. R. App. P. 
24(a)(3). However, an incarcerated party seeking to appeal in forma pauperis must file a new 
motion requesting permission to do so regardless of whether the litigant was previously 
granted leave to proceed without prepayment by the district court. 28 U.S.C. § 1915(b)(1); 
Fed. R. App. P. 24(a)(3)(B).   

Unless the United States or an officer or agency of the United States is a party to the 
action, the Notice of Appeal in a civil case must be filed within thirty (30) days from the 
date of entry of the judgment that is being appealed. If the United States or an officer or 
agency of the United States is a party to the action, the Notice of Appeal must be filed within 
sixty (60) days from the date of entry of the judgment. The “date of entry” is the day the 
judgment was entered onto the district court’s docket. The date an order or opinion is signed 
is not necessarily the same day that it will be reduced to a judgment or entered onto the 
court’s docket. The parties should consult Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58 to determine 
the date judgment is deemed to be entered in their case. 

The appellate court will only consider issues the district court has considered, so it is 
important to make your argument on an issue to the district court prior to appealing the issue.

C.  APPEAL 

Upon receipt of the Notice of Appeal, the appellate court will notify the parties of any orders 
issued or schedules set in the case.

Instructions for Filing a Complaint by a Prisoner 
Under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 

 
APPENDIX E-2, USDC-11, INSTRUCTIONS & COMPLAINT FORM FOR A 
PERSON IN CUSTODY 

You may file an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to challenge federal constitutional or 

statutory violations by state actors. Lawsuits challenging the conditions of your confinement are 
generally filed under this statute. A § 1983 action may not be used to challenge the length of 
your sentence or the validity of your conviction. 

42 U.S.C. § 1983 

 
Filing a § 1983 Action 

To file a § 1983 action, you must submit: (1) an original complaint and (2) a fee of 
$402.00 ($350.00 filing fee and $52.00 administrative fee) (by money order or cashier’s check 
made payable to “Clerk, U.S. District Court”) or an original Application to Proceed Without 
Prepayment of Fees or Costs (AO239). 
 

This packet includes a complaint form and an Application to Proceed Without 

Prepayment of Fees or Costs. When these forms are fully completed, mail the originals to: Office 
of the Clerk of Court, United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, Warren B. 
Rudman United States Courthouse, 55 Pleasant Street, Room 110, Concord, NH 03301-3941. If 
granted, the $52.00 administrative fee is waived. 

The fee for each Plaintiff in a § 1983 action is $402.00 ($350.00 filing fee and $52.00 

administrative fee), to be paid at the time of filing. If you are unable to pay the full filing fee at 
this time, you may apply to proceed without prepayment of fees or costs, using the Application 
in this packet. If you are granted leave to proceed without prepayment, the $52.00 administrative 
fee is waived, but you must still pay the statutory filing fee of $350.00 in several installments. 28 
U.S.C. § 1915. You must fully complete the application and sign and declare under penalty of 
perjury that the facts stated therein are true and correct. 
 

If the complaint contains more than one inmate plaintiff, each plaintiff must submit a 

separate Application or filing fee. Inmate plaintiffs must use the Application provided with this 
packet and not any other version.

V.  Complaint Form 

The Complaint must be typewritten or legibly handwritten and you must sign and declare 
under penalty of perjury that the facts stated in the complaint are true and correct. Each plaintiff 
must sign the complaint. 

Pro Se Litigation - Individual and Class Action Lawsuits 

As a pro se party, you are representing only yourself and presenting only your claims and 

defenses. Under the law, you cannot speak for another person, or other entity. You may not 
represent a class of people in a class action lawsuit. See Local Rule 83.2(d) & 83.6(b). A pro se 
party may not authorize another person who is not a member of the bar of this court to appear on 
his or her behalf. Each pro se party must sign the complaint and all additional pleadings filed 
with the court on his or her behalf. 
 

In order to assist pro se parties, the Court has compiled the Pro Se Guide, which should 

be available in the libraries of all New Hampshire correctional facilities. If your facility does not 
have a copy, the Court will mail you a copy upon request. 

I. 

Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies 

Under 42 U.S.C. § 1997e, you are required to exhaust your administrative remedies 

before filing a § 1983 action regarding conditions of confinement and other issues relating to 
prison life. Failure to completely exhaust administrative prison grievance procedures prior to 
filing your complaint will result in the dismissal of your suit in its entirety. 

II.  Change of Address After Complaint is Filed 

You will be notified as soon as the court issues any order in your case. It is your 
responsibility to keep the court informed of any changes of address to ensure you receive court 
orders. Failure to so do may result in dismissal of your action. 

III.  Copying Requests 

Please note that the Office of the Clerk of Court charges fifty cents (.50) per page for all 

copy requests. Thus, we recommend that you keep copies of all documents submitted to the court 
for your own records.
