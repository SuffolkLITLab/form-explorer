PREFACE 

This  text  is  not  intended  to  confer  or  create  any  rights,  privileges  or  benefits  to 

prospective  or  actual  parties.    It  is  also  not  intended  to  have  the  force  of  law.    Its  sole 

intention is to provide a general orientation concerning bail bond proceedings at the U.S. 

District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. 

The Clerk's Office is not allowed to give you legal advise, but will try to answer any 

questions about procedure or rules of the Court. 

THE BAIL REFORM ACT OF 1984 

The Bail Reform Act of 1984, as amended (“the Act”), Title 18, United States Code, 

Sections 3141 et seq., governs the release and detention of federal criminal defendants 

before  trial.    The  Act  “establishes  standards  and  procedures  governing  both  the  pretrial 

phase of a case, the period between conviction and sentencing, and the period during the 

pendency  of  an  appeal  by  either  side.    It  prescribes  consecutive  penalties  for  failure  to 

appear and for committing offenses while on release.  It also establishes standards and 

procedures  governing  material  witnesses.”    Weinberg,  Federal  Bail  and  Detention 

Handbook, § 2.03. 

RELEASE AND DETENTION PROCEEDINGS 

 

The  Initial  Appearance  or  Initial  Hearing  is  the  first  court  appearance  where  a 

federal criminal defendant’s release or detention pending trial is determined by a judicial 

officer.    18  U.S.C.  §  3141.    At  the  Initial  Hearing,  the  judicial  officer  may  impose  a 

condition or combination of conditions that should reasonably assure the appearance of

the defendant “unless the judicial officer determines that such release will not reasonably 

assure the appearance of the person as required or will endanger the safety of any other 

person, or the community.”  18 U.S.C. § 3142(b). 

 

The  presiding  judicial  officer  may  also  conduct  a  Detention  Hearing  to  determine 

whether  any  condition  or  combination  of  conditions  of  release  will  apply.    18  U.S.C.  § 

3142  (c)  and  (f).    These  conditions  may  include  a  combination  of  any  of  the  following: 

third party custodian; employment requirements; educational requirements; restrictions on 

personal  associations or  travel;  compliance with  a  curfew;  refraining  from  the  excessive 

use  of  alcohol;  refraining  from  the  unauthorized  use  of  narcotic  drugs  or  controlled 

substances; undergoing medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment; execution of an 

agreement to forfeit property upon failure to appear; execution of a bail bond with solvent 

sureties; electronic monitoring; and, any other reasonable condition. 

United States magistrate judges are the front-line judicial officers who conduct the 

majority  of  initial  appearance  and  detention  hearings.    There  are  4  United  States 

magistrate judges in the District of Puerto Rico. 

A judicial officer may also order a defendant to be temporarily detained to permit 

revocation of conditional release, deportation or exclusion.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(d). 

With  few  exceptions,  once  a  person  has  been  found  guilty  of  an  offense,  the 

judicial officer shall order his or her detention pending imposition of sentence.  18 U.S.C. 

§ 3143.  Likewise, a person who has been found guilty of an offense and sentenced will 

generally be ordered detained pending appeal.  18 U.S.C. § 3144.

RELEASE AND DETENTION FACTORS 

 

The  Act  contains  13  specific  conditions  of  release  which  the  Court  may  impose 

separately or in combination if it finds that a criminal defendant’s personal recognizance 

or unsecured appearance is inadequate.  Some of the factors considered by the Court in 

detention  and  release  proceedings  include:  the  nature  of  the  offense  charged,  such  as 

whether the charged offense is a crime of violence or involves narcotics; the weight of the 

evidence; the personal history and characteristics of the person, such as character, family 

ties,  employment,  criminal  history;  and,  dangerousness,  including  whether  the  person 

poses a threat to others or the community.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)(1)-(3).  The Court may 

also  consider  other  factors,  such  as  the  source  of  any  property  offered  as  collateral  to 

secure a bond.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)(4). 

 

The  U.S.  Probation  Office  for  the  District  of  Puerto  Rico  assists  the  Court  by 

conducting  bail  and  presentence  investigations,  and  supervising  persons  for  whom 

conditional  pretrial  release  has  been  authorized  as  well  as  parolees  and  probationers.  

The U.S. Probation Office is located at:  Room 400 Federico Degetau Federal Building, 

150 Carlos Chardón Street, San Juan, Puerto Rico 00918-1741. 

REVIEW AND APPEAL 
OF RELEASE OR DETENTION ORDERS 
 

 

If  a  person  is  released  by  order  of  a  magistrate  judge,  the  attorney  for  the 

Government may file a motion for revocation of the order or amendment of the conditions 

of  release.    The  person  may  also  file  a  motion  for  amendment  of  the  conditions  of

release.    Any  such  motion must  be filed  with  the  court  with  original  jurisdiction  over  the 

offense.  18 U.S.C. § 3145(a). 

If a person is ordered detained by a magistrate judge, the person may file a motion 

for  revocation  or  amendment  of  the  detention  order,  with  the  court  having  original 

jurisdiction over the offense.  18 U.S.C. § 3145(b). 

Release or detention orders entered by district judges may be appealed before the 

U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.  18 U.S.C. §§ 3145(c), and 3731; 28 U.S.C. § 

1291; Fed. R. App. P. 9. 

SECURING BAIL 

In  ordering  the  release  of  a  criminal  defendant,  the  Court  may  impose  financial 

conditions.  It may authorize an unsecured personal bond whereby the person promises 

to pay the Court a specified sum of money if he or she fails to appear as required.  If an 

unsecured personal bond is authorized the person is released without deposit of cash bail 

or collateral and promises to pay a sum of money if he or she fails to appear as required.  

The Court may require that a solvent co-signer, usually a family member or friend, appear 

where an unsecured personal bond has been authorized. 

 

In  cases  where  release  is  conditioned  upon  security,  the  person  may  secure  a 

commercial bail bond or may deposit at the Clerk’s Office, subject to forfeiture for breach 

of  a  condition  of  release,  cash  or  collateral.    A  person’s  relatives  or  close  friends 

sometimes post their property or act as his or her sureties. 

Fed.  R.  Crim.  P.  46(f)  sets  out  the  procedure  to  declare  a  bail  forfeited  if  a

condition of the bond is breached.  Any property designated as bond security or collateral 

may  also  be  forfeited  to  the  United  States  if  the  person  fails  to  appear.    18  U.S.C.  § 

3146(d); Fed. R. Crim. P. 46(i). 

The general guidelines for criminal bond security are set forth in Loc. Cr. R. 146.  

Once approved by order of the Court, criminal bonds may be secured as follows: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Cash  payment  by  certified  check  or  money  order  issued  within  the  last  5 
days payable to “Clerk, U.S. District Court.” 

By  a  corporation  authorized  to  act  as  surety  by  the  Commonwealth  of 
Puerto Rico, or by the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department pursuant 
to 6 U.S.C. § 113. 

By an individual person bearing a current identification with photograph.

to submission as surety. 
Recent  Property  Registry  certificate,  issued  by  an  authorized

Clerk’s Office will provide the surety or owner of said property a letter 
to the Property Registrar explaining the information that is required. 
An Appraisal Report, prepared and certified by a licensed appraiser, 
bearing his or her original seal and signature, issued no more than 3 
months prior to the date of submission. 
If applicable, a certified copy of the Declaration of Heirs. 
The original of any bearer note encumbering a property. 

Acceptance  of  real  estate  security  always  remains  at  the  discretion  of  the  Court.

as surety.  It is the policy of the Clerk’s Office that, except in cases of corporate surety,

instrument. 

In cases where an estate is the owner of the real estate property to be posted, all 

heirs must appear and sign the necessary court forms and other documents, as required. 

REQUESTING THE RETURN OF BOND DOCUMENTS 
 

At  the  conclusion  of  a  case,  upon  the  defendant’s  remand  to  begin  serving  any 

sentence  imposed,  a  surety  may  request  the  return  of  any  bond-related  documents 

deposited  at  the  Clerk’s  Office  by  prior  appointment  by  calling  the  Intake  Section  at 

(787)772-3032 or (787)772-3033. 

Return  of  cash  deposited  as  collateral  must  be  requested  at  the  conclusion  of  a 

case, by written motion to the Court.  Said cash will be returned only upon Court order. 

The following information is necessary to schedule an appointment: the complete 

name  of  the  surety;  the  criminal  case  number;  and,  the  Clerk’s  Office  receipt  number.  

Documents  will  be  returned  to  the  person  whose  name  appears  in  the  receipt.    An 

authorized  representative  must  be  designated  in  writing,  under  signature  of  the  surety 

named in the receipt.  The original letter of authorization and original Clerk’s Office receipt 

will  be  kept  by  the  Clerk’s  Office  for  the  record.    Sureties  or  authorized  representatives 

must present a valid photo identification in order to receive bond-related documents. 

 

Documents may only be returned by mail if a surety resides outside the District of 

Puerto Rico.
