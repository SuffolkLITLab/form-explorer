Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct a Sentence
By a Person in Federal Custody

(Motion Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255)

Instructions

8.

9.

To use this form, you must be a person who is serving a sentence under a judgment against you in a federal court. 
You are asking for relief from the conviction or the sentence.  This form is your motion for relief.

You must file the form in the United States district court that entered the judgment that you are challenging.  If
you want to challenge a federal judgment that imposed a sentence to be served in the future, you should file the
motion in the federal court that entered that judgment.

Make sure the form is typed or neatly written.

You must tell the truth and sign the form.  If you make a false statement of a material fact, you may be prosecuted
for perjury.

Answer all the questions.  You do not need to cite law.  You may submit additional pages if necessary.  If you do
not fill out the form properly, you will be asked to submit additional or correct information.   If you want to submit
any legal arguments, you must submit them in a separate memorandum.  Be aware that any such memorandum
may be subject to page limits set forth in the local rules of the court where you file this motion.

If you cannot pay for the costs of this motion (such as costs for an attorney or transcripts), you may ask to proceed
in forma pauperis (as a poor person).  To do that, you must fill out the last page of this form.  Also, you must
submit a certificate signed by an officer at the institution where you are confined showing the amount of money
that the institution is holding for you.

In this motion, you may challenge the judgment entered by only one court.  If you want to challenge a judgment
entered by a different judge or division (either in the same district or in a different district), you must file a
separate motion.

When you have completed the form, send the original and
Court at this address:

 copies to the Clerk of the United States District 

Clerk, United States District Court for 
Address
City, State Zip Code

If you want a file-stamped copy of the petition, you must enclose an additional copy of the petition and ask the
court to file-stamp it and return it to you.

CAUTION: You must include in this motion all the grounds for relief from the conviction or sentence that
you challenge.  And you must state the facts that support each ground.  If you fail to set forth all the
grounds in this motion, you may be barred from presenting additional grounds at a later date.

10. CAPITAL CASES: If you are under a sentence of death, you are entitled to the assistance of counsel and

should request the appointment of counsel.

(2)
the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the movant was prevented from making such a
motion by such governmental action;
