II.

Basis for Jurisdiction

Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, you may sue state or local officials for the “deprivation of any rights, privileges, or
immunities secured by the Constitution and [federal laws].”  Under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of
Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), you may sue federal officials for the violation of certain
constitutional rights.

A.

Are you bringing suit against (check all that apply):

’ Federal officials (a Bivens claim)

’ State or local officials (a § 1983 claim)

Section 1983 allows claims alleging the “deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by 
the Constitution and [federal laws].”  42 U.S.C. § 1983.  If you are suing under section 1983, what 
federal constitutional or statutory right(s) do you claim is/are being violated by state or local officials?

B.

C.

Plaintiffs suing under Bivens may only recover for the violation of certain constitutional rights.  If you 
are suing under Bivens, what constitutional right(s) do you claim is/are being violated by federal 
officials?

Page 3 of  11

Pro Se 14 (Rev. 12/16) Complaint for Violation of Civil Rights (Prisoner)

D.

Section 1983 allows defendants to be found liable only when they have acted “under color of any 
statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia.”  
42 U.S.C. § 1983.  If you are suing under section 1983, explain how each defendant acted under color 
of state or local law.  If you are suing under Bivens, explain how each defendant acted under color of 
federal law.  Attach additional pages if needed.

Indicate whether you are a prisoner or other confined person as follows (check all that apply):

III.

Civilly committed detainee

Immigration detainee

Convicted and sentenced state prisoner

Convicted and sentenced federal prisoner

VII. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies Administrative Procedures

The Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”), 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a), requires that “[n]o action shall be brought
with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined
in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are
exhausted.”

Administrative remedies are also known as grievance procedures.  Your case may be dismissed if you have not
exhausted your administrative remedies.

If yes, name the jail, prison, or other correctional facility where you were confined at the time of the 
events giving rise to your claim(s).

Please set forth any additional information that is relevant to the exhaustion of your administrative 
remedies.

(Note:  You may attach as exhibits to this complaint any documents related to the exhaustion of your
administrative remedies.)

VIII. Previous Lawsuits

The “three strikes rule” bars a prisoner from bringing a civil action or an appeal in federal court without paying
the filing fee if that prisoner has “on three or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility,
brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous,
malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under imminent
danger of serious physical injury.”  28 U.S.C. § 1915(g).

To the best of your knowledge, have you had a case dismissed based on this “three strikes rule”?

’ Yes

’ No

If yes, state which court dismissed your case, when this occurred, and attach a copy of the order if possible.
