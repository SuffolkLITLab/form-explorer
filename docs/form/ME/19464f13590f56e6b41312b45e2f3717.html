that the benefits received by the child(ren) meet or exceed the total monthly support obligation, the obligor shall receive a credit for 
the total amount of support due. To the extent that the monthly benefits received by the child(ren) do not satisfy the obligor's monthly

 11. 

 Obligor 

 Obligee 

 Either party (the party who can obtain health insurance FIRST at reasonable cost) shall obtain and 
maintain  private  health  insurance  for  the  benefit  of  the  minor  child(ren)  if  it  is  presently  available  at  reasonable  cost.  If  it  is  not 
presently  available  at  reasonable  cost  then  private  health  insurance  for  the  benefit  of  the  minor  child(ren)  shall  immediately  be 
obtained and maintained when it becomes available at reasonable cost. Proof of such insurance must be furnished to the other party 
within 15 days of receipt of a copy of this order, or if the insurance is not presently available, within 15 days of the date it becomes 
available.  If  the  child(ren)  is  (are)  recipients  of  public  assistance,  proof  of  such  insurance  shall  be  provided  to  the  Department  of 
Health & Human Services within 15 days.    

12. Any uninsured medical expenses of the child(ren), in excess of $250 per calendar year, shall be paid in the following manner:
__________% by the obligor and, __________% by the obligee. The first $250 of annual uninsured medical expenses shall be paid by 
the obligee. 

13. The  child  support  obligation  is  based  on  the  fact  that  the  parents  are  providing  substantially  equal  care  for  their  child(ren).
Uninsured medical expenses shall be shared as follows: _______% to be paid by the higher income parent and ______% to be paid by 
the lower income parent.  

If the Maine Department of Health & Human Services provides support enforcement services and/or the obligor is required to 
pay child support to the Maine Department of Health & Human Services, the obligor shall notify the Department within 15 days of the 
date of this Order of the following: 1. The obligor’s current address; 2. The name and address of the obligor’s current employer, and 3. 
Whether the obligor has access to health insurance at a reasonable cost, and, if so, the health insurance policy information. 

Within 15 days of any change in the obligor’s current address, any change in the name or address of the obligor’s current 
employer, or any change in the health insurance policy information, the obligor shall notify the Department of the change. Failure to 
report  a  change  of  address  or  employer  to  the  Department  within  15  days  of  such  change  is  a  civil  violation  for  which  a 
forfeiture not to exceed $200 may be adjudged for each violation. 

Any party to this action may file with the court a Motion to Modify asking the court to review the amount of child support and 
if appropriate, to modify it in accordance with the state's child support guidelines. If it has been less than 3 years since the child support 
order was issued or modified, the party must prove a substantial change in circumstances. 

14. This Order is (

 not) subject to Immediate Income Withholding as of this date (See Notice below)(If not, see 15 below). 

Notice to Parties Regarding Immediate Income Withholding. Immediate income withholding can only be implemented by serving 
an attested copy of the support order, along with the notice required under § 2655, upon the obligor’s payor of income. 
Notwithstanding this subsection, the department may implement immediate income withholding by serving the notice required under 
§ 2655 upon the obligor’s payor of income without providing an attested copy of the support order. Any party can obtain the payor
notice required under § 2655 by contacting the Department of Support Enforcement & Recovery at 207-624-4100 or
https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/ofi/programs-services/child-support-services. The notice for income withholding may be used to collect
arrearages in addition to current support. The amount of withholding may not exceed the limitations imposed by Title 15 United States
Code, Section 1673(b); and the payor of income shall withhold and send to the department a fee of $2 per week in addition to the
amount withheld for child support.
