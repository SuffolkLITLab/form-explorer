      <pre>STATE OF MAINE 

UNIFIED CRIMINAL DOCKET 
SUPERIOR COURT   
 
DISTRICT COURT 

County:  ____________________ 
Location:  ___________________ 
Docket No.:   

STATE OF MAINE 

v. 

____________________ 

  MAINE TREATMENT COURT 
 PLEA AGREEMENT AND 
   WAIVER OF RIGHTS 

I, the above-named defendant, after full consultation with my attorney, do execute this written plea 
agreement and waiver of rights in this matter, and state as follows: 

1.

2.

I understand the elements of the crime(s) and/or probation violation(s) charged against me,
the maximum possible sentence, and any mandatory minimum sentence.

I  understand  that  by  pleading  guilty  to  the  charges  and/or  admitting  the  probation
violation(s) I am giving up the following rights:

a.
b.

c.

d.

e.

f.

the right to remain silent;
the presumption of innocence, which means that although these charges have been
brought  against  me,  I  am  not  guilty  until  the  State  proves  the  criminal  charges
beyond a reasonable doubt and/or a probation violation by a preponderance of the
evidence, as applicable;
the right to a speedy and public trial, the right to be present at the trial, the right to
see and ask questions of witnesses who would testify against me for the State and
the right but not the obligation to testify myself and to call witnesses to testify on
my behalf;
the right to a jury trial for crime(s) and the right to a unanimous verdict in order for
me to be found guilty, which means all twelve jurors would have to conclude that
the State had proved beyond a reasonable doubt the charge(s) against me;
the right to a jury-waived trial; in order for the judge to find me guilty for crime(s),
he would have to conclude that the State had proved beyond a reasonable doubt the
charge(s) against me; in order to find I violated my probation, the judge would have
to conclude the State had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that I violated
my probation conditions;
the right to appeal any pretrial rulings and to appeal any conviction(s).

3.

I am pleading guilty because I am guilty and for no other reason.

4.

I am entering this plea voluntarily, based on my own free choice; no one has made any
threats  or  promises  to  encourage  me  to  plead  to  the  charge(s)  or  admit  the  probation

CR-238, Rev. 11/19 

Page 1 of 3 

violation(s) other than to tell me about the sentencing agreements made in connection with 
the plea agreement set forth below. 

5.

6.

I am not under the influence or impaired in any way by any drugs, alcohol, or medicine; I
understand this proceeding and am able to make an informed decision.

I  am  satisfied  with  the  services  of  my  attorney.   I  have  had  enough  time  to  discuss  the
Stateâ€™s  evidence  against  me,  the  plea  agreement,  and  the  requirements  of  the  Maine
Treatment Court.  I have had enough time to decide to enter plea(s) of guilty and/or admit
to violating my probation conditions as opposed to having a trial.

7.

I  was  born  in  ___________________________and  I  am/am  not  a  citizen  of  the  United
States.

8.

I understand the following plea agreement applies to my case:

a. Successful completion of the Maine Treatment Court:

__________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________________

b. Unsuccessful completion of the Maine Treatment Court:

__________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________________

9.

I understand I am waiving my right to challenge the continuation of sentencing until either
completion of, or dismissal from, the Maine Treatment Court.  M.R.U. Crim. P. 32(a)(1)

10. I understand that I do not have the right to appeal any sentence I receive pursuant to an

agreed-upon recommendation to the court.

11. I understand that I can withdraw my plea based only on the discretion of the court, and that
such discretion is exercised only in exceptional circumstances.  M.R.U. Crim. P. 32(d)

12. I understand that I must comply with all of the conditions of the Maine Treatment Court
bail contract, and if I do not, I will be in violation of the conditions of my post-conviction
bail incorporated therein, which may result in court-imposed sanctions, including but not
limited to incarceration, expulsion from the Maine Treatment Court, and/or being charged
with a new crime, violation of conditions of release.

13. I understand that the MTC judge and team will discuss me and my case with others while
I am not present.  I understand that the judge involved in the MTC may talk to me when
others  are  not  present.    I  understand  that  this  communication  is  different from  what the
judge would do if I was not participating in the MTC.

CR-238, Rev. 11/19 

Page 2 of 3 

14. I understand that the MTC judge may sanction me to a period of incarceration of up to four
days  if I violate the conditions  of release  imposed  by the court or the MTC  contract.   I
understand that I have the right to have an attorney represent me at any hearing to determine
whether a sanction of incarceration over four days should be imposed.

15. I understand that if I am expelled from the MTC, the court may proceed with the sentencing
pursuant to the plea agreement outlined in paragraph 8(b) above.  I understand that I have
the right to have an attorney represent me at any sentencing proceeding.

16. I have read, or have had read to me, the MTC bail contract and Client Handbook and I

understand all of the provisions of these documents.

17. If requested, an interpreter has been provided to me and I have read, or have had read to
me, the MTC bail contract and Client Handbook and I understand all of the provisions of
these documents.

All  of the  terms  of  this  plea  agreement  and  waiver  of  rights  have  been  explained  to  me  by  my 
attorney and by the court.  I have read and I understand all of the terms in this document.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
