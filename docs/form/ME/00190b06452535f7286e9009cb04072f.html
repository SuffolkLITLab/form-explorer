1.1  Introduction 

Chapter One:  Basic Information 

You have been arrested for a crime or crimes and have been identified as a person who 
may have a substance use disorder and possibly a co-occurring mental health disorder.  You are 
offered the opportunity to participate in a Maine Treatment Court (MTC).  The MTC is a problem-
solving court designed to help a person like you abstain from the use of alcohol and drugs and no 
longer be involved with the criminal justice system.   

This  handbook  is  designed  to  answer  your  questions,  address  your  concerns,  provide 
information about the MTC, and detail the requirements for an MTC participant.  As a participant, 
you will be expected to follow the instructions given by the judge, comply with your treatment 
plan developed by you and your treatment provider, and cooperate with case management. You 
are  required  to  read  and  abide  by  all  rules  and  procedures  outlined  in  this  handbook  and  are 
encouraged to share this handbook with family and friends. 

.2  Program Description 

The  MTC  is  a  court-supervised  comprehensive  treatment  program  for  justice-involved 
individuals presenting with a substance use disorder and/or a co-occurring mental health disorder.  
This is a voluntary program and it is a courageous act on your part to enter this program.   
 

The program includes regular court appearances before a designated and specially trained 
judge, intensive individual or group treatment, possible residential treatment, random and observed 
testing  for  alcohol  and/or  drugs,  and  participation  in  treatment  recommended  recovery  support 
groups such as twelve-step meeting and pro-social events.  The MTC is a combined effort of the 
Judicial Branch, the Office of the Attorney General, the District Attorney’s Office, the defense 
bar,  the  Administrative  Office  of  the  Courts,  the  Department  of  Corrections,  local  law 
enforcement, and community treatment providers.  You will be assisted in obtaining educational 
and job skills assessments and will be provided with referrals for vocational training, educational 
programs, and/or job placement services as well  as transitional/halfway housing.  The program 
length, determined by individual progress, will be at least fourteen months.   

Following arrest, if you are determined to be eligible, you may be offered the option of 
participating  in  the  MTC  as  part  of  your  sentence.    Eligibility  for  participation  in  the  MTC  is 
determined  by  completing  a  screening  process  that  verifies  you  meet  the  clinical,  legal,  and 
suitability requirements of the MTC.  The MTC team consists of the presiding judge, an assistant 
attorney  general  and/or  an  assistant  district  attorney,  a  local  defense  attorney,  a  clinical  case 
manager, a probation officer and/or a local law enforcement officer, a treatment court coordinator, 
and a local treatment provider.  Upon approval for program entry, you will be instructed to report 
to your first MTC status hearing.   
 

Electing  to  enter  the  MTC  is  your  choice  and  is voluntary.    Once  you  have  entered  the 
MTC, you may request to be allowed to withdraw from the MTC; the judge will determine whether 

 

   

   

  1

   

   

CR-249, Rev. 11.19 

3 

you  may  withdraw.   Your  defense  attorney  will review  the requirements  of  the  MTC  and  your 
options prior to the signing of the MTC contract. 
 
On your first MTC court date, you will sign your entry contract and you will be given an 
appointment  for  orientation  with  your  case  manager.    At  your  orientation  you  will  be  given  a 
participant  manual,  which includes  this  handbook,  petitions  to  advance  in  phase,  sober-support 
meeting information, travel forms, and a calendar.  Your case manager will review all materials in 
detail  with  you.    You  must  fill  out  certain  forms,  including  a  release  of  information  form  that 
permits  the  treatment  team  to  talk  with  your  doctors,  a  prohibited  substances  agreement,  and  a 
participant testing policy agreement. 

While in the MTC, you will be supervised by a case manager.  If on probation, you will 
also be supervised by a probation officer and must comply with the conditions of your probation.  
Supervision will include unannounced home visits during which your person and residence may 
be subject to search.  A defense attorney is part of the MTC team and may represent you during 
your participation in the MTC.  If you wish, you may hire your own attorney to appear with you 
at the status hearings. 

If you entered the MTC as part of a plea agreement, when you successfully complete the 
program, the agreed upon best outcome sentence shall be imposed by the Judge.  If you fail to 
successfully  complete  the  program,  or  are  expelled  from  the  program,  your  sentence  shall  be 
determined by the MTC judge unless you request a different judge.  If you entered the MTC as a 
condition  of  probation,  when  you  successfully  complete  the  MTC,  your  remaining  time  on 
probation will be determined by the MTC judge.  

.3  Program Progress, Commencement, Expulsion 

.3.1  Progress 

Once  you  have  successfully  completed  the  criteria  for  each  phase,  as  described  in  the 
Phases  Section,  you  may  apply  to  enter  the  next phase.    Eventually  you  will  be  a  candidate  to 
successfully complete the MTC.  A commencement ceremony to mark your successful completion 
of the MTC will not take place in fewer than fourteen months.  Each time you submit your petition 
to advance in phase or commence, the team will discuss your progress toward your goals and the 
judge will make the final decision as to whether you have met the conditions required to advance 
in phase or commence. 

.3.2  Commencement 

Approval  for  commencement  from  the  program  shall  be  determined  by the  MTC  judge 
with input from the MTC team.  Simply completing each phase of the MTC program does not 
guarantee commencement.  You must demonstrate that you have learned from the structure and 
support  you  have  received  before  the  MTC  team  will  recommend  your  commencement  to  the 
judge.    Your  family  will  be  invited  to  join  you  in  court  for  your  commencement  as  the  judge 
congratulates you on successfully completing the MTC and achieving your goal of establishing an 
alcohol,  drug,  and  crime-free  life.    Before  commencing  from  the  MTC,  you  must  complete  a 
program exit survey.

Expulsion  from  MTC  is  evaluated  on  an  individual  basis  and  depends  on  your 
circumstances and history.  A decision to end your participation will be made by the MTC judge 
after input from the MTC team.   

.3.3  Expulsion 

1.4  Participant Rights 

.4.1  Confidentiality 

Your  identity  and  privacy  will  be  protected  consistent  with  Maine  and  federal  law.    In 
response  to  these  regulations,  policies  and  procedures  have  been  developed  to  guard  your 
confidentiality.    You  will  be  required  to  sign  a  release  of  information  authorizing  transfer  of 
information  among  all  participating  agencies.    Additionally,  an  identification  number  will  be 
assigned to you that will be used in all research and evaluation activities to safeguard your identity.  
If you are employed, you are encouraged to let your employer know that you are part of the MTC 
program as the MTC team will verify your employment.   

You are also expected to respect and maintain the confidentiality of others in the MTC.  
This means you will not reveal any information about participants in the MTC.  You will be held 
accountable  and  sanctioned  for  breaching  confidentiality.    Sanctions  are  discussed  further  in 
section 5.1.2 of this handbook.   

.4.2  Waivers

2.1 Court Appearances 

Chapter Two:  Rules and Expectations 

As an MTC participant, you are required to appear for MTC status review hearings on a 
regular basis.  At these status review hearings, the judge will receive reports on your progress from 
the  MTC  team.    The  judge  will  speak  with  you  about  your  progress  and  discuss  any  specific 
problems you are experiencing.  If you are progressing, you will be encouraged to continue with 
the  program  and  may  earn  incentives  such  as  applause,  recognition,  phase  advancement, 
certificates, or gift cards.  If you are not progressing, the judge will discuss your lack of progress 
with  you  and  the  treatment  team  to  determine  further  action.    If  your  failure  to  progress  is 
determined to be a treatment issue, your treatment plan will be adjusted.  If your failure to progress 
is determined to be a behavioral issue, you will be sanctioned.  Sanctions are discussed further in 
section 5.1.2 of this handbook. 

ou must attend all scheduled court sessions.  Failure to appear in court on the date and 
time you are scheduled will likely result in the issuance of a warrant for your arrest.  If you cannot 
appear in court as scheduled, you must notify your case manager and your probation officer as 
soon  as  possible  to  explain  why  you  cannot  appear.    Claiming  illness  and/or  transportation 
problems will not automatically excuse you from a scheduled court date.  You must also provide 
documentation  of  your  illness  or  transportation  problems.    Your  legal  representation  at  MTC 
review  hearings  will  be  by  the  MTC  attorney,  unless  you  make  arrangements  for  other 
representation.  Your attorney at time of admission to MTC will remain as the counsel of record 
during your time in MTC.   

hroughout  your  time  in  the  MTC,  communication  and  honesty  are  the  keys  to  your 
progress.    The  more  informed  the  treatment  team  is  about  your  circumstances,  the  better  the 
treatment team can assist you. 

ou must attend all treatment sessions and required court-related activities.  This includes 
both individual and group sessions, case management appointments, mental health appointments, 
educational sessions, job placement or training sessions, and pro-social events.  If you are unable 
to  attend  a  scheduled  counseling  session,  you  must  contact  your  treatment  provider  before  the 
session.    If  you  are  unable  to  attend  any  other  scheduled  activity,  you  must  notify  your  case 
manager  before  the  scheduled  activity.    Failure  to  appear  at  scheduled  activity  will  result  in  a 
sanction and you may be required to pay for the cost of the missed session or appointment.

members and/or a significant other, the entire residence shall be subject to search.

.3  Alcohol and Drug Testing 

As part of the MTC program, you will be randomly and frequently tested for the presence 
of metabolites of alcohol and/or drugs in your urine.  Testing will occur at least twice per week, 
but may be more frequent.  Upon entry to the MTC, you will be required to sign the participant

a dilute or positive test, inadvertent exposure by consuming foods or beverages. 
 

8.  At  the  time  of  testing  I  will  disclose  any  prescription  medication,  over-the-counter 

medication, or supplements I am taking.   
 

9.  The inability to produce a urine specimen may be considered a positive test, may result 
in the loss of all my documented negative testing days, and may result in additional 
sanctions. 
 

10. If  I  am  unable  to  provide  a  sufficient  specimen,  I  will  be  asked  to  give  another 
specimen.    My  inability  or  unwillingness  to  provide  a  sufficient  second  specimen 
within one hour of request will be considered a positive test, will result in the loss of 
all my documented negative testing days, and may result in additional sanctions. 
 

11. I am required to give a urine specimen that is within 90F-100F as determined by the 
temperature strip on the test.  If I submit a specimen that does not fall within the proper

The MTC judge will have access to all alcohol and drug test results, including any failures 
to test.  Additionally, any member of the MTC team may order an alcohol and drug test at any 
time.   
 

A positive alcohol and/or drug test will not automatically result in your expulsion from the 
MTC,  but  sanctions  may  be  imposed.    The  MTC  judge  will  review  with  you  your  overall 
performance in the program when deciding whether to impose a sanction.

Maintaining an alcohol and drug free lifestyle is very important in the recovery process. 
You agree to abide by the Prohibited Substances Agreement.  While in MTC, you are prohibited 
from using or possessing any unapproved legal or illegal alcohol or drugs, in any form.   

nless  your  treatment  provider  and/or  case  manager  gives  you  prior  approval,  you  are 
prohibited  from  using  or  possessing  certain  prescription  drugs  or  medications,  including:   
(e.g.:  butabital,  Fioricet); 
amphetamines 
benzodiazepines  (e.g.:  Klonopin,  Valium,  Xanax);  opioids/opioid-based  substances  (e.g.: 
Demerol, Dilaudid, fentanyl, Lortab, morphine, oxycodone, Tylenol 3, Vicodin); and/or marijuana 
and marijuana concentrate. 

(e.g.  Adderall,  pseudoephedrine);  barbituates 

ou are prohibited from using or possessing any “synthetic” or “designer” drugs/stimulants 
that  can  be  purchased  legally  or  illegally.    Any  “smoking  mixtures,”  other  than  products 
specifically designated to contain only tobacco, are also strictly prohibited.  Any products sold or 
marketed  under  false  pretenses  with  the  warning  “not  for  human  consumption”  are  prohibited.  
Violation of this rule may result in immediate expulsion from MTC. 

.5  Medication 

  2

ou  are  prohibited  from  purchasing,  filling  a  prescription,  possessing,  or  using  any 
prescribed  and  over-the-counter  drugs  or  medicines  without  obtaining  approval  from  the  MTC 
prior to purchasing, filling a prescription, or ingesting.  You must be medication compliant. 

n the event you seek medical attention, you are required to inform the physician that you 
are in a court supervised substance use disorder treatment program.  Any medications administered 
by medical professionals in an inpatient or supervised setting, such as an ER visit, hospital stay, 
or  office  visit,  are  at  the  discretion  of  the  physician.    You  must  submit  copies  of  all  medical 
documentation to your case manager within twenty-four hours of release. 
 

If  take  home  narcotic  and/or  addictive  medications  are  determined  to  be  medically 
necessary for your recovery, MTC will monitor your usage of such medications throughout that 
time and may extend your time as an MTC client accordingly. 
 

  It  is  important  that  you  understand  the  connection  between  over-the-counter  (OTC) 
medications and relapse.  OTC medication use can become a serious problem for people recovering 
from  substance  use  disorder.    Improper  use  of  OTC  medications  can  lead  to  relapse,  health 
problems, and death.  A wide variety of OTC medications can be misused in an attempt to self-
medicate or for recreational purposes.   
 

You must obtain approval from your case manager before you purchase or use any OTC 
medications.  OTC medications that contain alcohol or dextromethorphan are prohibited.  OTC

pain relievers that contain acetaminophen and ibuprofen can be toxic if taken too frequently or in 
larger-than-recommended doses.  You must be alert to ingredients in OTC medications to ensure 
that you are properly taking the medication and not risking a relapse.  The first and best rule is to 
talk to the pharmacist.  A pharmacist understands substance use disorder and can direct you to 
medications that are safe and effective.   
 

Homeopathic preparations, vitamins, and other supplements can sometimes interfere with 

drug testing and are prohibited without prior case manager approval. 

You must remain in your county of residence unless you have permission to travel.  You 
may be given permission for day travel outside of your county of residence by your case manager 
or probation officer.  Overnight travel requires permission from the MTC judge 

You may not work or visit places where alcohol is the primary item being dispensed, sold, 

or marketed, including the bar area of a restaurant.

For your benefit, as well as the benefit of all participants, appropriate behavior is expected 
at all MTC locations including the courtroom, treatment centers, case managers’ offices, and any 
court function or event.   
 

While in court, you are expected to wait quietly for your case to be called and listen to the 

proceedings.  You can learn from others’ experiences.  Remember, you are in a courtroom.   
 

Disruptive behavior will not be tolerated in court, treatment sessions, or case management 
meetings.  You will be removed from these sessions or meetings if you are not behaving in an 
acceptable  manner.    Such  behavior  shall  be  documented  and  reported  to  the  MTC  team  and 
considered as a missed treatment session. 

o not engage in conduct, unwanted comments, gestures, writing, or physical contact that 
is  sexual  in  nature  toward  other  participants  or  staff.    Discrimination  on  the  basis  of  race,  sex, 
religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, or gender identity will not be 
tolerated and will be reported to the court.    

o  not  make  threats  toward  other  participants  or  staff  or  behave  in  a  violent  manner.  
Violent or inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated and will be reported to the court.  In most 
cases, this will result in expulsion from the MTC.

All  cell  phones  and/or  electronic  devices  must  be  turned  off  in  the  courtroom  and  at 

treatment sessions.  If found in use, these devices will be removed from your possession.   

.9  Dress Code   

You  must  dress  appropriately  and  conservatively  for  court  and  court-related  activities.  
Revealing clothing is not permitted.  You are expected to wear a collared shirt or blouse, dress 
pants, dress, or skirt.  Shorts, pajama pants, tank-tops, flip-flops, and hats are not permitted for 
court or court-related activities. 

lothes  bearing  alcohol  and/or  drug  related  themes  or  promoting/advertising  alcohol 
and/or drug use are not permitted or allowed.   Sunglasses are not to be worn at court or court-
related activities unless medically approved.  Shoes must be worn at all times.

It is very important to follow all of the MTC rules and instructions given to you by the 
MTC team members.  The judge will frequently remind you that “trying” is not “doing” and that 
just “trying” may result in expulsion from the MTC.  

articipation in the MTC is a privilege.  The MTC cannot accommodate all defendants who 
want to participate; those admitted are fortunate.  It is not a place to waste time and “fake it until 
you make it.”  Doing so may result in you receiving more jail time on program violations than you 
would have received on your underlying charge.   

he rules of this handbook apply to all MTC locations including the courtroom, treatment centers, 
case managers’ offices, and any court function or event.  The rules of the treatment provider or 
housing program apply as if they were issued directly by the MTC judge. 
 

Following the rules is in your best interest.  As you progress, if you consistently follow the 
rules and achieve goals, you will receive incentives from MTC.  These incentives are described in 
section 5.1.1 of this handbook.  In the same manner that poor behavior and choices are sanctioned, 
good behavior and choices are rewarded.

Chapter Three:  Treatment Services 

.1 Treatment Providers 

     

Your treatment will be provided by the treatment provider associated with the MTC or the 
Veterans  Administration.    You  will  be  required  to  complete  court  approved,  evidence-based 
treatment  programs  addressing  substance  use  and  criminal  thinking.    You  may  be  required  to 
purchase certain treatment manuals.  Your treatment provider will assess the level of treatment 
that  will  best  meet  your  needs  and  will  recommend  to  the  MTC  team  that  you  receive  either 
outpatient or residential treatment.  If you are assessed for outpatient services, a multi-component 
outpatient  program  will  be  developed  for  you.    If  you  are  admitted  to  a  residential  treatment 
program, your treatment plan will include the requirements of that program.   

.1.1  Treatment Plans 

An initial treatment plan will be developed by you and your treatment team following an 
overall assessment of your challenges and needs.  The plan will be a guide for your initial treatment 
phase and through it you will set goals, select methods for meeting those goals, and develop target 
dates for meeting those goals.  The plan will be maintained by your treatment provider and will be 
updated as you progress through the program.  You will attend and participate in treatment plan 
reviews with your primary treatment provider as you progress through your plan. 

You should request and receive a copy of your treatment plan and refer to it often.  If, at 
any time, you feel that you are not receiving the services outlined in your treatment plan, or are 
not meeting the goals you have identified, contact your treatment provider and case manager for 
assistance. 

Unexcused absence from treatment is a serious violation and will likely result in a sanction. 

.1.2  Outpatient Treatment 

Outpatient substance use counseling is comprised of two separate formats:  individual and 
group.  You may be required to participate in both types of counseling at various times.  Together 
they  are  designed  to  help  you  develop  self-awareness,  realize  your  self-worth,  and  develop  the 
strength to practice self-discipline. Individual and group counseling sessions will include problem 
identification  and  alternative  solutions.    Your  treatment  provider  may  use  multiple  treatment 
modalities  or  approaches  to  assist  you  in  reaching  your  goals.    All  of  these  approaches  are 
evidence-based best practices and are chosen specifically because of their relevance to your issues.  
Your attendance and participation level in counseling sessions will be reported to the MTC team 
as part of your overall progress.

.1.3  Residential Treatment 

CR-249, Rev. 11.19 

14 

Based  on  clinical  recommendations,  you  may  be  required  to  participate  in  a  residential 
 
program.  Residential treatment programs provide services in a full (24 hour) residential setting.  
The program shall provide a scheduled treatment regimen that consists of diagnostic, educational, 
and counseling services; and shall refer clients to support services as needed.  Clients are routinely 
discharged to various levels of follow-up services. 
 

Residential programs may involve either an unlocked or locked facility.  The length of time 
in  a  residential  program  will  be  determined  by  your  progress  and  clinical  recommendations.  
Leaving or checking yourself out of a residential program without prior approval of the MTC may 
result in a sanction, up to and including expulsion from the MTC. 

.1.4  Medication Assisted Treatment 

Your treatment provider may recommend that you receive medication assisted treatment 
(MAT) for either alcohol use disorder or opioid use disorder.  MAT will be monitored pursuant to 
the MTC policy. 

Your treatment provider may recommend that you meet with a mental health professional 
for  assessment,  evaluation,  and  treatment,  including  medication  management.    If  medication  is 
required to treat your condition appropriately, your physician will consult with the MTC team to 
ensure  that  you  are  provided  with  approved  medication.    Any  prescribed  medicine  will  be 
monitored pursuant to the MTC policy. 
 
3.1.6  Ancillary Services 

 

  Based on your presenting needs, the MTC team may refer you to a variety of ancillary 
services  to  support  your  recovery,  such  as  sober  supportive  housing,  vocational  training,  and 
educational services. 
  
3.2  Recovery Support Groups, Pro-Social Meetings, and Activities 

articipation in recovery support groups, pro-social events, or support meetings is required 
throughout the MTC.  Attending these meetings is an important part of your recovery.  It will help 
familiarize you with recovery philosophies, help you develop levels of trust, help you create social 
bonds with others in recovery, and help you establish a community-based support system for use 
after you commence. 

he  most  common  recovery  support  groups  in  the  recovery  community  are  Alcoholics 
Anonymous  (AA)  and  Narcotics  Anonymous  (NA).    These  organizations  are  considered 
spiritually-based due to their identification of a higher power.  Alternatively, you have the option 
of  attending  secular  meetings  that  are  recognized  as  recovery  support  meetings  or  pro-social 
meetings.  You will discuss your choice of recovery support meetings with your case manager.

Brunswick,  Canada.    Keep  in  mind  that  you  must  have  permission  to  leave  your  county  of 
residence. 

You must provide proof of attendance at the treatment recommended number of recovery 
support  or  pro-social  meetings.    You  will  be  required  to  submit  a  form  containing  information 
about  all  meetings  attended  to  your  case  manager.   Do  not  submit falsified  meeting  attendance 
slips, this is dishonest and will result in a sanction.

4.1 Program Phases 

 

Chapter Four:  Program Phases 

The MTC is a five-phase, highly structured, court-supervised treatment program lasting a 
minimum  of  fourteen  months,  regardless  of  the  amount  of  time  you  spend  in  each  phase.  
Completion of all requirements is necessary before you may successfully complete the MTC and 
this  may  require  significantly  more  than  fourteen  months.    Each  phase  consists  of  specified 
objectives, therapeutic and rehabilitative activities, and specific requirements for advancement into 
the next phase.  The components and requirements for advancement from each phase are described 
below.   

You are responsible for completing all phase requirements before advancement can occur.  
You may submit a petition to move to the next phase only after you have completed each task 
listed on the applicable phase-up petition.  It is important to remember that even if you can check 
off every task on the phase-up petition, you still may not be approved to advance in phase if you 
are not fully compliant with the program.

in phase only after you have completed each individual phase requirement and can initial each task 
on your phase-up petition.  It is your responsibility to track your progress and know when you

5.1 Program Responses 

Chapter Five: Program Responses 

An  effective  system  of  program  responses  promotes  your  ability  to  account  for  your 

actions.  Program responses will be applied in a way that is immediate, predictable, and consistent.    
Program responses must be appropriate for your developmental level, graduated as you progress 
through the program, and tailored to your individual progress or needs.   
 

Program responses will also be based on your specific capabilities.  The MTC team will 
determine whether you are capable of meeting a goal or adhering to rules as you progress through 
the MTC.  You will not be held accountable for failing to meet a goal or adhere to a rule that you 
are not capable of meeting at the current time.  Your goals will be based on your phase.  As you 
move  through  the  phases,  what  is  expected  of  you  will  increase  as  you  become  capable  of 
accomplishing greater things. 

.1.1 Incentives 

The  MTC  program  recognizes  the  effort  required  to  improve  behaviors,  choices,  and 
lifestyles.    Incentives  help  promote  compliance  and  success  in  case  outcomes.    Incentives 
emphasize desired compliance and help build trust between you and the MTC team.  With that in 
mind, the MTC program recognizes all markers of success, even if in a small way.  Examples of 
behaviors and accomplishments that lead to incentives are included below: 
 

Behaviors and Accomplishments 
 

•  Honesty 
•  1  day  of  abstinence  from  alcohol 

and/or drugs 

•  Violation free for 60+ days 
•  Maintaining employment 
•  Multiple  days

•  Outstanding accomplishment 
•  Paying restitution 
•  Perfect attendance 
•  Phase advancement 
•  Recognition  of  investment  in  MTC 

program 

Possible Incentives and Responses 

•  Applause 
•  MTC  outings,  including  game  days,

CR-249, Rev. 11.19

If  you  fail  to  comply  with  bail  contract  conditions,  the  judge  may  order  sanctions.  
Sanctions are graduated and individualized.  Sanctions are not negotiable and are imposed in an 
effort to modify your behavior.  With repeated violations of bail contract conditions, and a failure 
to  progress  satisfactorily,  the  judge  may  impose  the  ultimate  sanction  of  expulsion  from  the 
program.   

Treatment responses and sanctions are very different.  A court response that increases the 
level of treatment is considered a treatment response and is imposed to help and not punish you. 
If you continue to struggle with substance use issues, the judge will work with you to adjust your 
treatment plan.  Honesty is the fundamental key to your progress with substance use issues.  If you 
are  struggling  with  your  sobriety  and  are  honest  with  the  MTC  team,  the  MTC  will  provide 
assistance in the form of treatment responses. 
 

A  court  response  that  imposes  a  sanction  as  a  consequence  for  improper  behavior  is  an 
attempt to modify your behavior so that you learn to make better choices.  While sanctions may 
be viewed as punishment, the intent is to teach and inspire changes in your behavior.  Sanctions 
are  not  imposed  arbitrarily  and  are  imposed  after  detailed  discussion  among  the  team  and 
discussion between you and the judge. 

Sanctions are imposed on an individual basis.  Other participants in similar circumstances 
may receive different sanctions for conduct that may appear to be the same violation.  This is usual 
and appropriate.  You are viewed as an individual and your individual progress, attendance, and 
history are taken into account before any sanction is imposed. 
 

If you commit behavioral program violations, such as dishonesty, positive or missed drug 
tests, failing to attend individual or group treatment sessions, failing to attend court or pro-social 
activities, or failing to report to your probation officer, the judge will impose sanctions.  

Examples of infractions that lead to sanctions are listed below.  This is not a complete list 
and represents only possible sanctions that may be imposed.  As needs arise and different situations 
occur, new sanctions may be developed and added to this list.

hese are examples only.  The judge makes the final determination for all sanctions. 

.1.3  Treatment Responses 

If  you  are  not  responding  to  treatment  interventions,  but  are  otherwise  compliant  with 
treatment  and  supervision  requirements,  punitive  sanctions  will  not  be  imposed.    Treatment 
responses that increase your level of treatment are not sanctions.  They are imposed to help you 
learn  from  your  choices  and  to  not  repeat  them  and  are  designed  to  improve  the  overall 
effectiveness and response to the treatment episode. 

Treatment-oriented  responses  for  substance  use  while  in  the  MTC  are  based  on  the 
recommendation  of  treatment  providers  with  input  from  other  team  members.    Examples  of 
behaviors  that  lead  to  treatment  responses  are  listed  below.    This  is  not  a  complete  list  and 
represents only possible treatment responses that may be recommended.

• 

As a result of noncompliance with the rules, or as a method of additional monitoring for 
 
specific circumstances, you may be required by court order to wear a monitoring device.  Such a 
device may be a GPS ankle monitor, a SCRAM alcohol monitoring device, or a drug testing patch.  
MTC has established policies and procedures pertaining to the application and removal of such 
devices. 

If you are required to wear a monitoring device, you should expect to do so at your own 
expense and maintain current payments with the device provider.  If you are unable to maintain 
payments and this inability is due to a legitimate and verifiable difficulty, you should speak with 
your case manager as soon as possible. 

.1.5  Sanction Hearing Procedure 

If your behavior is not in compliance with the MTC rules, the MTC team will discuss this 
with the MTC judge and make a recommendation on a sanction.  If the sanction is fewer than five 
days incarceration, the issue will be addressed during your regularly scheduled status review.   
 

If a sanction of more than five days incarceration or expulsion is being considered, further 
discussion of the matter will be continued until the next MTC session and your counsel will be 
notified.  The MTC judge will determine whether you are to be incarcerated pending the outcome 
of the sanction hearing.  At any sanction hearing, the District Attorney shall have the burden of 
proof and must convince the MTC judge of the violation of MTC rules by a preponderance of the 
evidence.  You will be represented by your attorney or the assigned MTC attorney. 

.1.6  Motion to Revoke Bail 

When  there  is  an  alleged  violation  of  the  MTC  rules,  which  is  also  a  violation  of  your 
conditions of release, the District Attorney may file a motion to revoke bail.  If a motion to revoke

bail  is filed  and  approved  by  a  judge,  a  warrant will  be  issued  for  your  arrest,  and  you  will  be 
arrested and held until the next regularly scheduled MTC court session.  If a motion to revoke bail 
is not filed, the alleged violation will be considered at your next regularly scheduled MTC meeting. 

CR-249, Rev. 11.19 

27 

                                                                                     

6.1 Conclusion 

Chapter Six: Conclusion & Contacts 

The  MTC  was  developed  to  help  you  abstain  from  use  of  alcohol,  drugs,  and  criminal 
activity.   The program is designed to promote self-sufficiency and to return you to the community 
as a productive and responsible member.  The judge, court staff, and treatment team are present to 
guide and assist you, but the final responsibility is yours.  You must be motivated to change and 
be committed to a substance-free, crime-free life.   
 

If you are unable or unwilling to complete the program, you will not remain in the program 
long.  You may request to withdraw from the MTC, and the judge will determine whether you may 
withdraw.  If expelled from the program as a result of noncompliance, you will likely be taken into 
custody to await final disposition of your case. 

Honesty is always the best policy, especially when it comes to the MTC’s response to your 
actions and behaviors.  When you are honest, you build credibility and trust and the team knows 
how  to  design  a  program  to  help  you  address  your  issues.    When  you  are  dishonest,  you  lose 
credibility and trust.  Credibility and trust have a direct impact on how the MTC responds when 
you have an issue.  The MTC is a strict program and is not for those who do not want to change 
and improve their lives.  If you want help and are willing to let us help, we will help you to recover.  
If,  after  learning  about  this  program  and  completing  an  orientation  meeting  with  your  case 
manager, you decide that you do not want help, please speak with your attorney about your options.   

he rules outlined in this handbook apply to you at all times and wherever you are. 

  T

Upon completion of the MTC, you will be contacted by an MTC team member for an exit 
interview.  The purpose of this exit interview is to obtain feedback about the MTC, to learn how 
participants perform after they successfully complete the MTC, and to measure how well the MTC 
is doing.  We ask that you provide your contact information upon program completion and that 
you update the MTC program if that information changes.  You will not be identified individually 
or sanctioned in any way for your answers. 

We  hope  this  handbook  has  been  helpful  and  answered  your  questions.    If  you  have 

additional questions, speak to your attorney or a member of the MTC team.   
 

Welcome to the Adult Drug Treatment Court, the Co-Occurring Disorders Court, or the 

Veterans Treatment Court.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
