 a problem

 As a participant,

 by the j
 udge, 
 comply with your
 treatment 
 plan developed 
 by you and 
 your treatment 
 provider
 , and cooperate with case management

 1. 2 Program Description
 The 
 MTC is a court
 -supervised comprehensive treatment program for 
 justice
 -involved 
 individuals p
 resenting with 
 a substance use disorder and/or 
 a co occurring mental health disorder
 . 
 This is a voluntary program and it 
 is 
 a courageous act on your part 
 to 
 enter this program. 
 The program includes regular court appearances before a designated and 
 spec
 ially 
 trained 
 judge, intensiv
 e individual or group treatment
 , possible residential treatment
 , random and observed 
 testing for alcohol and/or drugs, and participation
 in treatment recommended recovery support 
 groups such as twelve
 -step meeting and
 pro
 -socia
 l events
 . 
 The 
 MTC is a combined effort of the 
 Judicial Branch
 , the 
 Office of the Attorney General, 
 the 
 District AttorneyÕs Office, 
 the 
 defense 
 bar, the Administrative Office of the Courts, the Department of Corrections, local law 
 enforcement, and communit
 y treatment providers. 
 You will be assisted in obtaining educational 
 and job skills
 assessments and will be provided with referrals for vocational training, educational 
 programs, and/or job placement services as well as transitional/halfway housing. The 
 program 
 length, determined by individual progress, will be 
 at least 
 fourteen months
 . 
 Following arrest, if you are determined to be eligible, you may be offered the option of 
 part
 icipating in
 the 
 MTC as part of your sentence. Eligibility for participat
 ion in 
 the 
 MTC is 
 determined by 
 completing a 
 screening
 process that verifies 
 you meet the clinical, legal, and 
 suitability requirements of 
 the 
 MTC. The M
 TC team consists of the presiding 
 judge, an 
 assistant 
 attorney 
 general and/or an 
 assistant 
 district a
 ttorney, a local defense attorney, a clinical case 
 manager, a probation officer and/or a local law enforcement officer, a 
 treatment 
 court coordinator,

 ucted to report 
 to your
 first M

 Electing to enter 
 the 
 MTC is your choice 
 and is
 voluntary. 
 Once
 you have entered 
 the 
 MTC, you may 
 request to be allowed to 
 withdraw from
 the M
 TC; the 
 judge 
 will determine whether

 prior to the signing of the M

 part of the 
 MTC 
 team and 
 may
 represent
 you during
 your participation in the M
 TC. I

 you may hire your own attorney to appear with you 
 at the status hearings.

 agreed upon 
 best 
 outcome sentence shall be i

 Chapter Two: Rules and Expectations
 2. 1 Court Appearances
 As an M
 TC participant, you are required to appear for 
 MTC status review 
 hearings 
 on a 
 regular basis. At these status review hearings, the judge will receive repo
 rts on your p
 rogress from 
 the M

 ak with you about your progress
 and discuss any specific 
 problems you 
 are 
 experiencing. If you are
 progressing
 , you will be encouraged to continue with 
 the program and may earn incentives such as applause, rec
 ognition, phase advancement, 
 certificates, 
 or 
 gift cards. If you are not
 progressing
 , the judge will discuss your 
 lack of 
 progress
 with you and the treatment team to determine further action. If your failure to progress is 
 determined to be a treatment is
 sue, your treatment plan will be adjusted. If your failure to progress 
 is determined to be a behavioral issue, you will 
 be 
 sanctioned
 . Sanction
 s are discussed further in 
 section 5. 1. 2 of this handbook. 
 You must attend all
 scheduled court sessions. Fail

 time you are scheduled will likely result in 
 the issuance of 
 a warrant for your arrest. If you cannot 
 appear in court as scheduled, you must notify your case manager and your probation officer as 
 soon as possible to 
 explain why you cannot appear. Claiming illness and/or transportation 
 problems will not automatically excuse you from a scheduled court date. You 
 must
 also provide 
 documentation of your illness
 or 
 transportation problem
 s. Your legal representation at MT
 C review hearings 
 will be by the 
 MTC attorney

 during your time in MTC. 
 Throughout your time in

 your 
 progress. The more informed the treatment te
 am is about your circumstances
 , the better the 
 treatment team can assist you.

 ent sessions and required court
 -related activities. This includes 
 both 
 individual and group sessions, 
 case management appointments, 
 mental health appointments, 
 educational sessions, job placement or training sessions, and pro

 to attend a scheduled counseling session, you must contact your tre
 atment provider
 before the 
 session
 . If you are unable to attend any other scheduled activity, you must notify your case 
 manager befor

 2. 4 Prohibited Substances 
 Maintaining an alcohol and drug free lifestyle is very important in th
 e recovery process. 
 You agree to abide by the Prohibited Substances Agreement. 
 While in M
 TC, you are prohibited 
 from using or possessing any unapproved
 legal or illegal alcohol 
 or drugs
 , in any form
 . Unless your treatment provider and/or case manager gives you prior approval
 , you are 
 prohibited from using or possessing certain pr
 escription drugs or medications, including: 
 
 amphetamines (
 e. g. Adderall, pseudoephedrine) ; b
 arbituates (e. 
 g. : b
 utabital
 , F
 ioricet) ; 
 benzodiazepines (
 e. g. : Klonopin, 
 Valium, 
 Xanax) ; 
 opioids/opioid
 -based substances (
 e. g. : Demerol, Dilaudid, fentanyl, L
 orta
 b, morphine, oxycodone, 
 Tylenol 3, V
 icodin) 
 ; and/or marijuana 
 and
 marijuana concentrate
 . You are 
 prohibited from
 using or possessing any
 ÒsyntheticÓ or Òdesigner
 Ó drugs/stimulants
 that can be purchased legally or illegally. 
 Any
 Òsmoking mixtures, Ó 
 other 
 than products 
 specifically designated to contain only tobacco
 , are also strict
 ly prohibited. Any
 products sold or 
 marketed under false pretenses with the warning Ònot for human consumptionÓ are prohibited. 
 Violation of this rule may resul
 t in immediate e
 xpulsion from M
 TC. 
 2. 5 Medication
 You are prohibited from purchasing, filling a prescription, possessing
 , or using any 
 prescribed and over
 -the
 -counter drugs or 
 medicines without obtaining approval from 
 the 
 MTC prior to purchasing, filling a prescription
 , or ingesting. You must 
 be medication compliant
 . In the event you seek
 medical attention, you are required to inform the physician that you 
 are in a 
 court supervised 
 substance use disorder 
 treatment program
 . 
 Any m
 edications administered 
 by medical prof
 essionals in 
 an inpatient or 
 supervised setting, such as an 
 ER visit, hospital stay, 
 or office visit
 , are at the discretion of the physician. You must submit copies of all medical 
 documentation to your case manager wi
 thin twenty
 -four
 hours of release. 
 If take home narcotic and
 /or
 addictive medications are determined to be medically
 necessary for your recovery, M
 TC will monitor your usage of such medications 
 throughout that 
 time a
 nd may extend your time as an M
 TC client accordingly
 . It is important that
 you understand the connection between over
 -the
 -counter (OTC) 
 medications and relapse. OTC medication use can become a serious problem for people recovering 
 from substance use disorder. Improper use of OTC medications can lead to re
 lapse, health 
 problems
 , and
 death. A wide variety of OTC medications can be misused in an attempt to self
 -medicate or for recreational purposes. 
 You must obtain
 approval from your case manager before you purchase or use any OTC 
 medications. OTC medications that contain alc
 ohol or dextromethorphan are prohibited. OTC 
 ! #"CR 249, Rev. 11. 19
 pain relievers that contain acetaminophen and ibuprofen can be toxic if taken too frequently or in 
 larger
 -than
 -recommended doses. You must be alert to ingredients in OTC medications to ensure 
 that you are prop
 erly taking the medication and not risking a relapse. The first and best rule is to 
 talk to the pharmacist. A pharmacist understands subs
 tance use disorder and can direct
 you to 
 medications that are safe and effective. 
 Homeopathic preparations, vitami
 ns, and other supplements can sometimes interfere wi
 th 
 drug testing and are
 prohibited without prior case manager approval. 
 2. 6 Travel 
 You must remain in your county of residence unless you have permission to travel. You 
 may be given permission for da
 y travel outside of your county of residence by your case manager 
 or probation officer. Overnight travel
 requires permission from the M
 TC judge
 2. 7 Inappropriate Places 
 You may not work or visit places where alcohol is the primary item being dispense
 d, sold, 
 or marketed
 , including the bar area of a restaurant
 . 
 You may not work or visit places where drugs, legal or illegal, are the primary item being 
 dispensed, sold, or marketed. 
 2. 8 Behavior 
 For your benefit, as well as the ben
 efit of all par
 ticipants, appropriate
 beha
 vior is expected 
 at all M
 TC locations including the courtroom, treatment centers, 
 case managersÕ offices, and
 any

 Disruptive behavior will not be tolerated in 
 court, 
 treatment sessions
 , or case management 
 meetings
 . You
 will be removed from these 
 sessions
 or 
 meetings
 if 
 you are not behaving in an 
 acceptable manner. Such behavior shall be d
 ocumented and reported to the M
 TC team and 
 considered as a missed treatment session. 
 Do not engage in conduct, unwanted comments, gestures, writing, or physical contact that 
 is sexual 
 in nature toward other participan
 ts or staff. D

 religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, or gender identity will not be

 ! $"CR 249, Rev. 11. 19
 All cell phones and/or electr
 onic devices must be turned off in the courtroom and at 
 treatment sessions. If found in use, these devices will be removed from your possession.

 participation in the M
 TC. 2. 1
 1 Follow the Rules
 It is very important to follow
 all of the M
 TC rules and 
 instructions given to you by 
 the 
 MTC team members. The judge will frequently remind you that ÒtryingÓ is not ÒdoingÓ and that 
 just ÒtryingÓ may result in expulsion from 
 the 
 MTC. Participation in 
 the 
 MTC is a privilege. 
 The M
 TC cannot accommodate all defendants who 
 want to participate; those admitted are fortunate. 
 It is not a place to waste time and Òfake it until 
 you make it. Ó Doing so may result in you receiving more jail
 time on program violations than you 
 would have received on your underlying charge. 
 The rules of this handbook apply to 
 all MTC locations including the courtroom, treatment centers, 
 case managersÕ offices, and any court function or event. 
 The rules of 
 the treatment provider
 or 
 housing program apply as if the
 y were issued directly by the M
 TC judge. 
 Following the rules is in your best interest. As you progress, 
 if you 
 consistently follow the 
 rules and achieve goals, you
 will receive incentives from M
 TC. 
 These incentives are described 
 in 
 section 5. 1. 1 of
 this handbook. In the same manner that poor behav
 ior and 
 choices are
 sanctioned, 
 good behavior and 
 choices are
 rewarded.

 updated as you progress through the program. You will attend and participat
 e in treatment plan 
 reviews
 with your primary 
 treatment provider
 as yo
 u progress through your plan. 
 You should request and receive a copy of your treatment plan and refer to it often. If, at 
 any time, you feel that you are not r
 eceiving the services outlined i
 n your treatment plan, or are 
 not meeting the goals you have id
 entified, 
 contact
 your 
 treatment provider
 and case manager for 
 assistance. 
 Unexcused absence from treatment is a serious 
 violation 
 and will likely result in a sanction. 
 3. 1. 2 
 Outpatient Treatment
 Outpatient s
 ubstance use counseling is comprised of tw
 o separate formats: individual and 
 group. 
 You may
 be required to participate in both types of counseling at various times. Together 
 they are designed to help you develop self
 -awareness, realize your self
 -worth, and develop 
 the 
 strength to practice self
 -discipline. 
 Individual and group counseling sessions will include problem 
 identification and alternative solutions. Your 
 treatment provider 
 may u
 se multiple treatment 
 modalities
 or 
 approaches to assist you in reaching your goals. All of these approaches 
 are 
 evidence
 -based 
 best 
 practices and are chosen specifically because of their relevance to your issues. 
 Your attendance and participation level in counseling sessions will be reported to the 
 MTC team 
 as part of your overall progress.

 , and Activities
 Participation 
 in 
 recovery support groups, 
 pro
 -social events
 , or 
 support 
 meetings is required

 your recovery. It will help 
 familiarize you with recovery philosophies, help you develop levels of trust, 
 help you create social 
 bonds with others in recovery, 
 and help you establish a 
 community
 -based 
 support system 
 for 
 use 
 after you 
 commence
 . The most common 
 recovery support groups 
 in the recovery community are Alcoholics 
 Anonymous 
 (AA) 
 and Narcotics Anonymo
 us (NA) 
 . These organizations are considered 
 spiritually
 -based due to the
 ir identification of a higher power. 
 Alternatively, y
 ou have the option 
 of attending secular meetings that are recognized as 
 recovery 
 support meetings
 or pro
 -social 
 meetings. 
 You wi
 ll discuss your choice of

 Chapter Five: Program Responses
 5. 1 Program Responses
 An effective system of program responses promotes your ability to account for your 
 actions. 
 Program responses will be applied in a way that is immed
 iate, predictable, and consistent. 
 Program responses must be appropriate for your developmental level
 , graduate
 d as you progress 
 through the program
 , and 
 tailo
 red to your individual progress or 
 needs. 
 Program responses will also 
 be based on
 your spec
 ific capabilities. The M
 TC tea
 m will 
 determine 
 whether 
 you are capable of meeting a goal
 or 
 adhering to rule
 s as you progress through 
 the 
 MTC. You will not be held accountable
 for
 failing to 
 meet a goal or adher
 e to a rule that you
 are
 not capable of mee
 ting 
 at the current time. 
 Your goals will be based on your phase. As you 
 move through the phases, 
 what is expected of you will increase as you become capable of 
 accomplishing greater things
 . 5. 1. 1 Incentives
 The M
 TC program recognizes the ef
 fort requi
 red
 to improve behaviors, choices, and 
 lifestyles. Incentives help 
 promote 
 compliance and success in case
 outcomes. Incentives 
 emphasize desired compliance and help
 build trust between you and the M
 TC team
 . With that in 
 mind, the 
 MTC program recognizes 
 all markers of success, even if in a small way. Examples of 
 behavi
 ors and 
 accomplishments that lead to incentives are included below: 
 Behaviors and 
 Accomplishments
 ¥! Honesty
 ¥! 1 day of abstinence from alcohol 
 and/or drugs
 ¥! Violation free for 60+ days

 5. 1. 2
 Sanctions
 If you fail to comply with bail contract conditions, the judge may order sanctions. 
 Sanctions 
 are 
 grad
 uated 
 and individualized. Sanctions are not negotiable and are imposed in an 
 effort to modify your behavior. 
 With repeated violations of bail contract conditions, and a failure 
 to progress satisfactorily, the judge may i
 mpose the ultimate sanction of exp
 uls
 ion from the 
 program. 
 Treatment responses and s
 anctions a
 re very different. A 
 court response 
 that increase
 s the 
 level of treatment 
 is considered 
 a treatment response and 
 is imposed to help and not
 punish you. 
 If you continue to struggle with substa
 nce use issues
 , the judge will work with you t
 o adjust
 your 
 treatment plan. Honest
 y is t
 he 
 fundamental 
 key to your progress with
 substance use issues
 . If you 
 are struggling with your sobriety 
 and are honest
 with the M
 TC 
 team, the M
 TC will provide 
 assista
 nce in the form of treatment responses. 
 A court response that imposes a 
 sanction as a consequence 
 for improper behavior 
 is an 
 attempt
 to modify 
 your 
 behavior
 so that you learn to make better choices. While sanctions may 
 be vi
 ewed as punishment, the inten
 t is to teach
 and
 inspire changes in your behavior. Sanctions 
 are not imposed arbitrarily and are imposed after detailed discussion among the team and 
 discussion 
 between you and 
 the judge. 
 Sanctions are imposed on an individual basis. Other participant
 s in similar circumstances 
 may receive different sanctions 
 for conduct that may appear 
 to 
 be the same violation. This is usual 
 and 
 appropriate. You are v
 iewed as an individual and
 your individual prog
 ress, attendance, and 
 history are
 taken into account 
 before any sanction is imposed
 . If you commit
 behavioral program violations, 
 such as dishonesty, positive or missed drug 
 tests, failing to attend individual or group treatment sessions, failing to attend court or pro
 -social 
 activities, 
 or 
 failing to report
 to your probation officer, 
 the judge will impose sanctions
 . Examples of infractions that lead to sanctions are listed below. This 
 is not a complete list 
 and 
 represents
 only
 possible sanctions that may be imposed. As needs arise and different situatio
 ns 
 occur, new sanctions may be developed and added to this list. 
 Examples of Typical 
 Violations
 ¥! Dishonesty or deliberately omitting 
 giving information to the court
 ¥! Behavioral i
 ssues, including 
 poor 
 attitude and being disruptive
 ¥! Providing a dilute or 
 altered alcohol 
 and/or drug test
 ¥! Failing to abide by curfew
 ¥! Failing to attend scheduled events
 ¥! Failing to appear at scheduled court 
 session
 s ¥! Failing to complete community 
 service hours
 ¥! Failing to engage in services
 ¥! Failing to follow

 . 5. 1. 3
 Treatment Responses
 If you are not responding to treatment interventions, but are otherwise compliant with 
 treatment and supervision requirements, punitive sanctions will not be imposed. Treatm
 ent 
 responses that increa
 se your level of treatment are not
 sanctions. They are imposed to help you 
 learn from your choices and to not repeat them and are designed to improve the overall 
 effectiveness and response to the treatment episode. 
 Treatment
 -ori
 ented responses for substance use while in 
 the 
 MTC are based on the 
 recommend
 ation of treatment providers with i
 nput
 from other team members
 . Examples of 
 behaviors that lead to treatment responses are listed below. This 
 is not a complete list and 
 represe
 nts
 only
 possible treatment responses that may be recommended.

 5. 1. 4 Monitoring Devices
 As a result of non
 compliance with the rules, or as a method of additional monitoring for 
 specific circumstances, you may be required by court order to wear a monitoring devic
 e. Such a 
 device may be a GPS ankle monitor, a SCRAM alcohol monitoring device, or a drug testing patch. 
 MTC has established policies and procedures pertaining to the application and removal of such 
 devices. 
 If you are required to wear a monitoring dev
 ice, you should expect to do so at your own 
 expense and maintain current payments with the device provider. If you are unable to maintain 
 payments and this inability is due to a legitimate and verifiable difficulty, you should speak with 
 your case manager
 as soon as possible. 
 5. 1. 5 
 Sanction Hearing 
 Procedure
 If your behavior is not in compliance with the MTC rules, the MTC team will discuss this 
 with the MTC judge and make a recommendation 
 on a sanction. 
 If the sanction is fewer than five 
 days
 incarce
 ration
 , the issue will be addressed during 
 your regularly scheduled status review. 
 If a sanction of 
 more than five 
 days 
 incarceration 
 or expuls
 ion is being considered, further 
 discussion of the matter will be continued until the next MTC session and you
 r counsel will be 
 notified. 
 The MTC judge will determine whether you are to be 
 incarcerated
 pending the outcome 
 of the sanction hearing. At any sanction hearing, the District Attorney shall have the burden of 
 proof and must convince the MTC judge of the 
 violation of MTC rules by a preponderance of the 
 evidence. 
 You will be represented by your attorney or the assigned MTC attorney. 
 5. 1. 6
 Motion to Revoke Bail
 When there is an alleged violation of the MTC rules
 , which is also a violation of your 
 conditi
 ons of release, the District Attorney may file a 
 motion to 
 revoke 
 bail. If a 
 motion to 
 revoke 
 # ("CR 249, Rev. 11. 19
 bail is filed and 
 approved
 by a judge, a warrant will be issued for your arrest, and you will be 
 arrested and held until the next regularly scheduled MTC court s
 ession. If a 
 motion to 
 revoke 
 bail 
 is not filed, the alleged violation will be considered at your next regularly scheduled MTC meeting. 
 #) "CR 249, Rev. 11. 19
 Chapter Six: Conclusion & Contacts
 6. 1 Conclusion
 The 
 MTC w
 as 
 developed t
 o help you abstain
 from
 use of alcohol, drugs, and
 criminal 
 activity. 
 The 
 program is designed to promote self
 -sufficiency and to return you to the community 
 as a productive and responsible member. The judge, court staff, and treatment team are present t
 o guide and assist you, but the final responsibility is yours. You
 must be motivated to 
 change 
 and 
 be committed to a substance
 -free
 , crime
 -free
 life. 
 If you are unable or unwilling to complete the program, you wil
 l not remain in the program 
 long. 
 You 
 may
 request to withdraw from the M
 TC, and the judge will det
 ermine whether you may 
 withdraw
 . If 
 expelled
 from
 the program as a result of non
 compliance, you wil
 l likely be taken into 
 custody 
 to await final disposition of your case. 
 Honesty is always the 
 best policy, 
 especially when it comes to 
 the 
 MTCÕs respon
 se 
 to your 
 actions
 and 
 behavior
 s. When you are honest
 , you build credibility and trust and 
 the team knows 
 how to design a program to help you address your issues. 
 When you are dishonest
 , you lose 
 credibility and trust
 . Credibility and trust have a direct impact on how 
 the 
 MTC 
 responds when 
 you have an issue
 . 
 The 
 MTC is a 
 strict program and is not fo
 r those who do not want to change 
 and 
 impro
 ve their lives. If you want
 help and are
 willing to let 
 us help, we will help 
 you to recover. 
 If, after learning about this program and completing an orientation meeting with your case 
 manager, you decide that you do not want help, please speak with your attorney about your options. 
 The
 rules outlined in th
 is handbook apply to
 you at all times and
 wherever you are. 
 Upon completion of 
 the 
 MTC
 , you will be contacted by an M
 TC team member for an exit 
 interview. The
 purpose of this 
 exit interview 
 is to obtain
 feedback about 
 the M
 TC, to learn how 
 participants 
 perform
 after they 
 successfully complete the MTC
 , and to measure how well 
 the 
 MTC is doing. W
 e ask that you provide your contact information upon program compl
 etion and that 
 you update the M
 TC program if that information changes. You will not be identifi
 ed individually 
 or sanctioned in any way for your answers. 
 We hope this handbook has been help
 ful and answered 
 your questions. 
 If you have 
 addition
 al questions, speak to you
 r attorney or a member of the M
 TC team.
