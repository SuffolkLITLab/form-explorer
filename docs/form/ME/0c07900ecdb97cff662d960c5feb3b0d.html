reported  to  appropriate  authorities  in  accordance  with  federal  regulations.    Federal  law  and 
regulations  do  not  protect  any  information  about  a  crime  committed  by  a  patient  either  at  the

crime.  Federal laws and regulations do not protect any information about suspected child abuse 
or neglect from being reported under state law to appropriate state or local authorities.

investigation of patient.  Except as authorized by a court order granted under subsection (b)(2)(C) 
of this section, no record referred to in subsection (a) of this section may be used to initiate or

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
