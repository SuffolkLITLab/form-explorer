Notice to Parties Regarding Immediate Income Withholding. Immediate income withholding can only be implemented 
by serving an attested copy of the support order, along with the notice required under § 2655, upon the obligor’s payor 
of income. Notwithstanding this subsection, the department may implement immediate income withholding by serving 
the notice required under § 2655 upon the obligor’s payor of income without providing an attested copy of the support 
order. Any party can obtain the payor notice required under § 2655 by contacting the Department of Support 
Enforcement & Recovery at 207-624-4100 or https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/ofi/programs-services/child-support-
services. The notice for income withholding may be used to collect arrearages in addition to current support. The 
amount of withholding may not exceed the limitations imposed by Title 15 United States Code, Section 1673(b); and the 
payor of income shall withhold and send to the department a fee of $2 per week in addition to the amount withheld for 
child support.
