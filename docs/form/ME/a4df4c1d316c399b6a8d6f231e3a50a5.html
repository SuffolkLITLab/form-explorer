PARENTAL RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES CASE:  
What to do with these Court Forms 

Here are a few tips for filling out the forms: 

•  Always use full legal names, not nicknames. 
•  Type or print neatly.   

o  Fillable versions of the forms are available on our website at: http://courts.maine.gov/fees_forms/forms.  

•  You will file each form with the Court.  Before you do that, make copies of your completed forms—one for 

yourself and one copy for each of the other parties.  You will need to find a place to make copies (like a library).  
The court clerk cannot make copies for you. 

STEP ONE: Fill out the Forms 

amily Matter Summary Sheet (FM-002) 
This form is required for the clerk to start an action. In order to fill out this form you need to enter contact information 
for yourself and for the defendant.  

omplaint for Determination of Parentage, Parental Rights & Responsibilities, Child Support (FM-006) 

The section at the top of the form is called the "caption."  Fill in the location of the District Court (for example: 
"Bangor").  The clerk will fill in the Docket Number later.  You are the plaintiff and the other party is the defendant. If 
there are other parties involved, they will be listed as “Other Party.” Write your full legal name in the blank before 
"Plaintiff."  Write the other party's full name in the blank before "Defendant."  Fill in the other blanks on the form.  Near 
the end, where it says, "Plaintiff requests," check all the boxes that apply.  (If you are not sure, check the box; you can 
drop that request later.) You must sign this form in front of a notary public. You can find a notary at a bank, a legal 
services office, through your town office, or at the court clerk's office. 

hild Support Affidavit (FM-050) 

Fill out the "caption" the same way that you did on the complaint form. Fill out the rest of the form to the best of your 
knowledge. Note that you list last year's earned income and this year's expected earned income separately under #1.  
Also note that you list other income under #2 and in-kind income under #3. You may have to look at your records to get 
financial information. After the defendant gets your complaint, the Court will ask the defendant to fill out the same 
financial form and send you a copy. 

amily Matter Summons and Preliminary Injunction (FM-038) 
You must use the original form you got from the clerk.  It has the clerk’s original signature and seal.  You cannot use a 
photocopy or on-line version of this form.   

ill out the "caption" as you did on the complaint.  Fill in the name and address of the Court.  Date and sign the form.  
Leave the spaces on the second page empty. 

ocial Security Number Disclosure Form (CV-CR-FM-PC-200) 
You are required by both State and Federal law to provide your social security number along with your children’s social 
security numbers. This information is collected on the Social Security Number Disclosure form, which will be confidential 
in the court file. This form is included in your packet. 

ADA Notice: The Maine Judicial Branch complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). If you need a reasonable 
accommodation contact the Court Access Coordinator, accessibility@courts.maine.gov, or a court clerk.

Notice Regarding Electronic Service (CR-CV-FM-255) 
This packet contains two copies of this form. You have the choice to allow the opposing party to serve documents on 
you by email. To do this, you must complete one of the copies of the Notice Regarding Electronic Service (CR-CV-FM-
255) and include that in the packet of forms that you serve on the opposing party. Make sure to also include the second 
blank copy of this form in the packet of forms that you serve on the opposing party. If the opposing party wants to allow 
you to serve documents by email, the opposing party must complete the form and send it back to you. Do not file this 
form with the court. 

PLEASE NOTE: Receiving filings by email in your case is completely optional. If you wish to receive paper filings in your 
case, you do not have to complete this form. However, if you do complete the form, you do not need to file it with the 
court.  

STEP TWO: Serve the Forms 

ow you must give copies to the other party or parties.  This is called "serving" the court papers.  Court rules say you can 

do this in one of three ways: (1) You can mail the papers, asking the other party to agree to "service;" (2) you can send 
the papers by certified mail, restricted delivery; or (3) you can pay a sheriff to give the copies to the other party. You 
must file proof of service with the court. 

f the child for whom you are seeking to determine parentage has or may have parents or guardians other than the party 
to the proceeding you must also serve the other possible parents or guardians with all of your pleadings. For example, if 
you are bringing a parentage case for a child and a court has already determined that another person is the child’s 
parent, you must serve your action on that adjudicated parent. You must also serve your pleadings on any intended or 
presumed parents.    

ervice by Mail 
Mail or hand-deliver these papers to the other party or parties: 

•  Copy of Complaint 
•  Copy of Summons and Preliminary Injunction 
•  Copy of Child Support Affidavit 
•  Two copies of Acknowledgment of Receipt of Summons and Complaint (after you have filled in the "caption" 

on both copies) 

•  Blank copy of the Notice Regarding Electronic Service (CR-CV-FM-255) 
•  Completed copy of the Notice Regarding Electronic Service (CR-CV-FM-255) (only if you want to agree to email 

receipt of documents filed by the opposing party in your case) 

•  Stamped, self-addressed envelope 

he Acknowledgment of Receipt form asks the other party to sign it, showing he/she got the papers, and to return 
the form to you within 20 days.  If you get the signed Acknowledgment back within 20 days, go on to Step 3.  If not, 
then you will need to serve the papers another way.

MAINE JUDICIAL BRANCH 
 

receipt of documents filed by the opposing party in your case) 

Tell the postal clerk that you want to send the papers by certified mail.  Make sure you ask for a “Return Receipt” and 
“Restricted Delivery.”  This costs more and involves a few extra steps.  The certified restricted mail forms are available 
at your post office. File with the court clerk the green card you get back from the post office, to prove that the other 
party got the papers. 

ervice by Sheriff 
Mail or take to your county sheriff's office: 

•  Copy of Complaint 
•  The original Summons and Preliminary Injunction, plus one copy 
•  Copy of Child Support Affidavit 
•  Blank copy of the Notice Regarding Electronic Service (CR-CV-FM-255) 
•  Completed copy of the Notice Regarding Electronic Service (CR-CV-FM-255) (only if you want to agree to email 

receipt of documents filed by the opposing party in your case) 

In a letter, or in person, ask the sheriff’s office to serve the papers on the other party (the defendant).  Give the 
defendant’s home address.  If you think the defendant will be hard to find at home, give the defendant’s work address.  
The deputy who "serves" the papers will complete page two of the Summons and return the original to you. There is a 
charge for this service - please contact the sheriff’s office for the county where the defendant lives to get information 
on costs of service.  

TEP THREE: File the Forms 

Within 20 days after serving the other party or parties, file these forms with the court: 

 

 

 
 Summary Sheet  
 Complaint 
 
 SSN Disclosure Form     
 Child Support Affidavit 
 Summons (REQUIRED regardless of how service was completed, and should be filed with deputy's signature if 
you used sheriff's service) 
 Acknowledgment of Receipt (if you used service by mail)   
 Green card you got back from the post office (if you used certified mail for service) 

Please note: you must file at least one type of proof of service for each other party to the case. 

The Court charges a fee to file your papers.  Later you may be charged a mediation fee (shared by the parties).  You 
should contact the court clerk for exact fee amounts. If you cannot afford the court fees, you can ask the clerk for an 
Application to Proceed Without Payment of Fees and an Affidavit.  Then file the forms with the clerk along with your 
other papers.  A judge will review your financial information and decide whether you qualify for a fee waiver.  If the 
waiver is denied, you must pay the filing fee within 7 days.  If the waiver is granted, you won't have to pay some or all of 
the court fees. 

ADA Notice: The Maine Judicial Branch complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). If you need a reasonable 
accommodation contact the Court Access Coordinator, accessibility@courts.maine.gov, or a court clerk.

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
