 : What to do with these Court Forms
 MOTION TO 
 ENFORCE
 : What to do with these Court Forms
 Here are a few tips for filling out the forms: 
 Always use full legal names, not nicknames. 
 Type or print neatly. 
 o Fillable versions of the forms
 are available on our website at: 
 http
 s: //
 www. 
 courts. maine. go
 v/fees forms/forms
 . You will file each form with the Court. Before you do that, make copies of your completed forms
 Šone for 
 yourself and one 
 copy for each of the other parties. You will
 need to find a place to make copies (like a library) . 
 The court cl
 erk cannot make copies for you. 
 STEP ONE: Fill 
 out the Forms
 Family Matter Summary Sheet (FM
 -002) 
 This form is required for the clerk to 
 start an action
 . In order to fill out this form 
 you need to enter contact information 
 for yourself and for any other 
 party. 
 
 Motion to

 (FM
 -070) The section at the top of the form is called the "caption. " Look at the caption on your original Court Order and copy 
 the court location, docket numbe
 r and names of Plaintiff and Defendant. (This information stays the 
 same. If you 
 were the 
 defendant befo
 re, you are still the 
 defendant, even though you are the one filing th
 e motion to 
 enforce
 . ) If 
 you can't find your original order, you can obtain a cop
 y from the clerk. If you are trying to change the amount of child 
 support 
 only
 , check that box that reads "Child Support Only" under the words ﬁMotion to 
 Enforce
 . ﬂ 
 Please complete 
 pages 1 through 3 as instructed. 
 You must sign

 a notary 
 public. You can find a 
 notary at a 
 bank, a legal services 
 office, th
 rough your town office, or at the court clerk's office.

 the Social Security Number Disclosure form, which will be 
 placed in a confidential envelope in the court file. 
 This form is included in your packet. 
 Child Support Affidavit 
 (FM
 -050) 
 (for 
 cases
 with minor children) 
 Fill out the "caption" the same way that you did on the complaint form. Fill out the rest of the form to the best of your 
 knowledge. Note that you list last year's earned income and this 
 year's expected earned income separately unde
 r #1. 
 Also note that yo
 u list other income under #2 and fringe benefits under #3. You may have to look at your records, if 
 you have them, to get financial information. You must sign this form in front of a 
 notary 
 public. After 
 the defendant
 gets your C
 omplaint, the Court will
 ask 
 the defendant
 to fill out the same financial form and send you a copy.

 . Do 
 not
 file this 
 form with the court. 
 PLEASE NO
 TE: Receiving filings by email 
 in your case is 
 completely optional
 . If 
 you wish to receive paper filings in your 
 case, you
 do 
 not
 have t
 o complete th
 is form. However, if you do complete the form, you do 
 not
 need to file it with the 
 court. 
 STEP TWO: Serve the Forms
 Now you must give copies to 
 the defendant
 . This is called "serving" the court paper
 s. Court rules say you can do this in 
 one of three ways: (1) You ca
 n mail the papers, asking 
 the other party
 to agree to "service
 ; " (2) 
 you can send the papers 
 by certified mail
 ; or (3) 
 you can pay a sheriff to g
 ive the copies to 
 the other party

 file proof of service with 
 the court

 The Acknowledgment of Receipt form asks
 the other party 
 to sign it, 
 showing he/she got the papers, and to return the 
 form to you within 20 days. 
 If you get the signed Acknowledgment bac
 k within 20 days, go on to Step 3. If not, then you 
 will need
 to serve the papers another way. 
 Service by Certified Mail

 Take these papers to the post office along w
 ith an envelope:

 in your case
 ) Tell the postal clerk that you want t
 o send the papers by certified mail. 
 Make 
 sure you ask for a ﬁReturn Receiptﬂ and 
 ﬁRestricted Delivery. 
 ﬂ 
 This costs more and involves a few extra steps. Get forms and help 
 from your post office. File 
 with the court clerk the green card you get back fro
 m the post office, to prove that 
 the other 
 party
 got the papers.
