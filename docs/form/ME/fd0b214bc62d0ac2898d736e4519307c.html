 6. Plaintiff/Petitioner 
 Defendant/Respondent 
 Other (
 ) objects to the 
 fee arrangement 
 below but, after careful consideration, the court concludes the following factors in M. R. G. A. L. 
 4 (b) (4) (C) support the fee arrangement: 
 GAL™S
 INVESTIGATIVE
 DUTIES
 AND
 RESPONSIBILITY
 FOR
 WRITTEN
 REPORT
 7. DUTIES
 A. 
 If this appointment is made due to a finding of incompetence, and the GAL believes the finding should be 
 reconsidered, the GAL shall file a motion to that effect with the Court. 
 B. 
 The GAL shall be provided access to all pleadings, reports, and records relevant to the case to which 
 the p
 arty 
 for whom 
 this
 GAL is appointed has access. 
 C. 
 The GAL shall be relieved of: 
 (i) any duty or obligation to conduct an independent investigation of any facts 
 related to this proceeding; 
 (ii) any duty or obligation to have face
 -to face contact with 
 the 
 party
 for whom a 
 GAL is appointed 
 on a set scheduled basis
 ; and 
 (iii) any duty or ob
 ligation to report to the parties and the 
 court in writing. 
 D. 
 The GAL shall have face
 -to face contact with
 the 
 party
 for whom a GAL is appointed pursuant to this Order 
 as 
 often as events and developments in this case warrant. The GAL shall conduct such in
 vestigation of the facts 
 related to this proceeding that, in his/her independent judgment, is reasonably necessary to serve her 
 interests. 
 E. The GAL shall attend and observe all court proceedings in this case. The GAL shall have the right to be heard 
 in 
 any court proceeding in this case. 
 The GAL is further authorized to appear on the same basis as the party 
 for whom this GAL is appointed in the present action, to present and defend any claims or causes of action on 
 behalf of the party, including the pres
 entation and submission of testimony and evidence at trial, and to 
 make binding decisions on behalf of the party in this matter, including the compromise of any of the party™s 
 
 claims. 
 F. The GAL may file such motions, and take such other steps as are necessa
 ry to obtain legal counsel for
 the 
 party
 for whom 
 this
 GAL is appointed. 
 G. 
 The GAL shall be relieved of the rights, duties, and responsibilities provided by the Maine Rules of Guardian 
 ad Litem
 , and more particularly, the Standards of Practice for Guardians
 ad Litem in Maine Courts
 because
 they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Order. The obligations of a Rule 17 (b) Guardian 
 are more 
 closely aligned with those of a fiduciary, such as a GAL appointed for an incapacitated person by the Probate 
 Cour
 t. However, a Rule 17 (b) GAL™s authority and obligations concern only the present litigation and no 
 other aspects of the 
 life of the p
 arty
 for whom this GAL is appointed
 . H. The Order shall serve as authorization for the GAL to communicat
 e with the 
 medical 
 treatment providers
 of 
 the party for whom this GAL is appointed
 as necessary to understand the nature and extent of th
 at party™s 
 illness, the impact of that illness on the party™s ability to act on the party™s own behalf, and the impact of the 
 party™s illness on the relief that the party may seek in the proceeding.
