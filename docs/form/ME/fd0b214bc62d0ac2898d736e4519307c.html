not capable of meaningfully participating in the proceeding that has been commenced and does not have a 
duly appointed representative; 
 is a minor who does not have a duly appointed representative; or

GAL’S INVESTIGATIVE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR WRITTEN REPORT 

7. DUTIES

A.

If this appointment is made due to a finding of incompetence, and the GAL believes the finding should be
reconsidered, the GAL shall file a motion to that effect with the Court.

B. The GAL shall be provided access to all pleadings, reports, and records relevant to the case to which the party

for whom this GAL is appointed has access.

C. The GAL shall be relieved of: (i) any duty or obligation to conduct an independent investigation of any facts
related to this proceeding; (ii) any duty or obligation to have face-to-face contact with the party for whom a
GAL is appointed on a set scheduled basis; and (iii) any duty or obligation to report to the parties and the
court in writing.

D. The GAL shall have face-to-face contact with the party for whom a GAL is appointed pursuant to this Order as
often as events and developments in this case warrant.  The GAL shall conduct such investigation of the facts
related to this proceeding that, in his/her independent judgment, is reasonably necessary to serve her
interests.

E. The GAL shall attend and observe all court proceedings in this case.  The GAL shall have the right to be heard
in any court proceeding in this case.  The GAL is further authorized to appear on the same basis as the party
for whom this GAL is appointed in the present action, to present and defend any claims or causes of action on
behalf of the party, including the presentation and submission of testimony and evidence at trial, and to
make binding decisions on behalf of the party in this matter, including the compromise of any of the party’s
claims.

F. The GAL may file such motions, and take such other steps as are necessary to obtain legal counsel for the

party for whom this GAL is appointed.

G. The GAL shall be relieved of the rights, duties, and responsibilities provided by the Maine Rules of Guardian
ad Litem, and more particularly, the Standards of Practice for Guardians ad Litem in Maine Courts because
they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Order.  The obligations of a Rule 17(b) Guardian are more
closely aligned with those of a fiduciary, such as a GAL appointed for an incapacitated person by the Probate
Court.  However, a Rule 17(b) GAL’s authority and obligations concern only the present litigation and no
other aspects of the life of the party for whom this GAL is appointed.

H. The Order shall serve as authorization for the GAL to communicate with the medical treatment providers of
the party for whom this GAL is appointed as necessary to understand the nature and extent of that party’s
illness, the impact of that illness on the party’s ability to act on the party’s own behalf, and the impact of the
party’s illness on the relief that the party may seek in the proceeding.

LENGTH OF APPOINTMENT
