      <pre>Enforcing Your Parenting Plan 
Note: Use these instructions and forms to make changes to your Parenting 
Plan.

These instructions and forms may not be right for your case. They can not 
take the place of advice from a lawyer. Talk to a lawyer if you have any
questions.

Do not change these forms.  If you change the forms, you might lose language 
you need.

What Forms Will I Need to Enforce My Parenting Plan?
If the other parent is not following your Parenting Plan ordered by the court, you 

will need to fill out and file the following forms: 

(cid:120)  Petition for Contempt 

(cid:120)  Supporting Affidavit 

(cid:120)  Order to Show Cause 

(cid:120)  Request to Serve Documents 

(cid:120)  Contempt Citation 

(cid:120)  Affidavit of Inability to Pay (only if you cannot afford filing fees) 

The Petition for Contempt asks the court to force the other parent to follow your 

parenting plan and punish the other parent for failing to follow the court’s order. 

The Supporting Affidavit tells the court why you need help enforcing your 

parenting plan.  It explains how the other parent has failed to follow your final 

parenting plan. 

The Order to Show Cause will be filled out by the judge.  This order schedules a 

hearing on your Petition for Contempt, and tells the other parent that he or she 

must show up and tell the court why he or she should not be held in contempt.

© 2008 Montana Supreme Court Commission on Self-Represented Litigants and Montana Legal Services 
Association. Use of this form is restricted to not-for-profit purposes.  

Last updated 11/21/2008 

The Request to Serve Documents should be given to your local sheriff or a 

process server so the other parent can be given copies of your forms. 

The Contempt Citation will be filled out by the judge.  It tells the other parent 

what the punishment will be for failing to follow your Parenting Plan.  It also tells 

the other parent how to avoid being punished. 

The Affidavit of Inability to Pay asks the court to waive filing fees in your case. 

What Words Do I Need to Know? 

 

Petitioner- A Petitioner is someone who files an action in court.  You are the 

Petitioner in this contempt action. 

Respondent- A Respondent is someone who has been filed against in court.

The other parent is the Respondent in this contempt action. 

Contempt- Contempt is a finding by a court that someone has failed to follow a 

court order.  In your case, you are asking that the other parent be held in 

contempt for failing to follow your court-ordered Parenting Plan. 

Who Can Use the Forms? 

You can use these forms if: 

(cid:120)  You have a Parenting Plan ordered by a court; 

(cid:120)  The other parent is not following the Parenting Plan; and 

(cid:120)  You need the court’s help to make the other parent follow the 

Parenting Plan.

What if the Other Parent Does Not Live in Montana? 

If you know where the other parent lives, you will need to contact the sheriff in 

the county where the other parent lives and ask how much they charge to serve 

documents on someone.  Some states will waive the fee if you have an Order of 

Inability to Pay, but some may not.  You should mail the documents to be served 

on the other parent to the sheriff of the county where the other parent lives, along 

with the fee or your Order of Inability to Pay.  Once the other parent is served, 

the sheriff will return your Proof of Service.  If you do not know where the other 

parent lives, it can be very difficult to enforce your parenting plan. 

What Do I Do with the Forms? 

1 

Fill out the Forms 

 

 

Fill out all the blanks on the Petition for Contempt, Supporting 

Affidavit, and Request to Serve Documents. 

Put your name and the other parent’s name in the caption of the 

Order to Show Cause and the Contempt Citation.  The caption 

looks like this:

Sign, date, and notarize your Supporting Affidavit.  Sign and date 

your Petition for Contempt and Request to Serve Documents. 

Do not put in full birth dates of anyone, the children’s full names, or 

full social security numbers of anyone. You can put in the year of 

birth for anyone and the children’s initials. You will need to use 

another form called a “sensitive data sheet” to give the court more 

information. You can get that form from your local court or from the 

place you got this form. 

2 

Make Copies 

  Make at least two copies of each form once you have them filled 

out.  You will need to have one copy of the forms served on the 

other parent.  You will need to bring the other copy with you to the 

Show Cause hearing. 

3 

File Forms at the Courthouse 

 

File the original Petition for Contempt, Supporting Affidavit, Order to 

Show Cause, and Contempt Citation with the Clerk of District Court 

in the county where your original Parenting Plan was filed, or in the 

county where you live. 

 

If you can’t afford the filing fees, ask the Clerk of District Court for 

an Affidavit of Inability to Pay. This form may be called something 

different in your county. 

 

Give the Clerk of Court a self-addressed, stamped envelope.  Be 

sure to ask the Clerk of Court to mail two copies of the Order to 

Show Cause to you after the judge signs it.  If you do not have an 

Order of Inability to Pay from the judge, you may be charged a fee 

for these copies.

Give all your copies to the Clerk of District Court and ask her to 

stamp them as “Filed.”  Keep the copies in a safe place.  You 

should bring the copies with you to your Show Cause hearing. 

4 

Wait for the Order to Show Cause 

 

The court will set a hearing date and will fill out and sign your Order

to Show Cause.  The Clerk of Court will mail you the copies you 

requested when you filed. 

5 

Serve the Other Parent 

 

Have the Petition for Contempt, Supporting Affidavit, and the Order 

to Show Cause that was filled out by the judge served on the other 

parent.  Sheriffs in Montana will serve the other parent for free if 

you have an Order of Inability to Pay from the judge.  If you do not 

have this, you will need to pay the sheriff to serve your forms. 

  Mail or hand-deliver your original Request to Serve Documents and 

other documents to the sheriff’s office in the county where the other 

parent lives.

they can mail you Proof of Service after they give your forms to the 

Note: When the other parent gets your documents, s/he will be able to file a 
Response with the Court explaining why s/he disagrees with your Petition for 
Contempt.  S/he will also be able to go to the hearing and tell the Court his or 
her side of the story.

File the Proof of Service 

 

Once the sheriff returns Proof of Service to you, make a copy and 

file the original with the Clerk of District Court in the county where 

you filed your Petition for Contempt.  Have the Clerk stamp your 

copy of the Proof of Service as “Filed.”  This step is important.  The 

Judge will need to see proof that the other parent was served 

before finding him or her in contempt.

Legal Basis

Jurisdiction 

2 

Civil Contempt 

This Court ordered a final parenting plan in this action.  This Court has

 

exclusive and continuing jurisdiction under Mont. Code Ann. § 40-7-202. 

a. 

Montana law says that disobeying any lawful judgment, process, or 

order of the court is in contempt of the court’s authority.  Mont. 

Code Ann. § 3-1-501(1)(e). 

b. 

Contempt can be criminal or civil.  Contempt is civil if the purpose 

for imposing a penalty is to force compliance with a court order.  

The penalty can be ended or avoided by complying with the court’s 

order in civil contempt. Mont. Code Ann. §3-1-501(3). 

c. 

My Motion for Contempt should be granted to force the other 

parent’s compliance with the final parenting plan ordered by this 

court.

Interference with Parent-Child Contact 

a. 

Montana law says that it is not in the child(ren)’s best interest when 

one parent does not allow the other parent to see the child(ren) or 

tries to keep the other parent from seeing the child(ren). Mont. 

Code Ann. ' 40-4-219(3).

b. 

The law says the offense of interference with parent-child contact 

happens when someone given parent-child contact under a 

parenting plan knowingly or purposely prevents, obstructs, or 

frustrates the rights of another person given parent-child contact 

under the parenting plan.  Mont. Code Ann. § 45-5-631(1). 

c. 

The punishment for a conviction of interference with parent-child 

contact may be a fine of $500 or less, or imprisonment in the 

county jail for 5 days or less, or both.  Mont. Code Ann. § 45-5-

631(2).

d. 

My Motion for Contempt should be granted to remind the other 

parent that preventing, obstructing, or frustrating my contact with 

the child does not serve the best interests of our minor child(ren) 

and is considered an offense under Montana law. 

I respectfully ask this Court to: 

1. 

Schedule a hearing and order the other parent to appear and show why 

my Petition for Contempt should not be granted;

2. 

Hold the other parent in civil contempt for failing to follow our Parenting 

Plan; and 

3. 

Order any other relief the Court deems is just and proper.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
