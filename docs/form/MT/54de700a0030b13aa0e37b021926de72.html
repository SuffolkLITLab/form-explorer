      <pre>Montana Common Law 
Marriage & Estate Planning

by Marsha A. Goetting, Ph.D., CFP®, CFCS, Professor and Family Economics 
Specialist, Montana State University Extension
The purpose of this MontGuide is to explore Montana common law marriages 
from an estate planning perspective. Topics include: The definition of common 
law marriage, what establishes a common law marriage, what documentation 
is necessary for a common law marriage, and what amount the surviving 
spouse of a common law marriage inherits. 

 MT201408HR  Revised 11/19

John and Mary, an unmarried couple, lived together 
for 15 years prior to John’s death. They never obtained a 
marriage license or had a wedding. John had two children 
from a previous marriage while Mary had no children. 
They did not have any children together. All property was in 
John’s name only. He died without a written will. Does the 
property valued at $2 million pass to John’s two children or 
to Mary? It depends....

Mary filed in district court as a surviving spouse because 
she believed she and John had a common law marriage. If 
Mary “wins,” she inherits $1,075,000 while John’s children 
from his previous marriage inherit $925,000.

Why the difference in amounts? Under Montana law the 
estate of a person who dies without a will is divided between 
his spouse and children from a prior marriage. If Mary is 
not a “wife,” all of John’s estate passes to his children.
John’s two children asserted in district court that a 
common law marriage between their dad and Mary 
definitely did not exist. If they “win,” they inherit their 
father’s estate – all $2 million. Nothing passes to Mary.

The district court must decide: did Mary and John 
have a common law marriage?

After the death of one party, there may be confrontations 
between the “surviving spouse” of a perceived common 
law marriage and the deceased person’s other heirs – 
children, grandchildren, parents and/or siblings. An 
estate plan could help prevent these conflicts. Also, 
court costs and attorney fees could be avoided from a 
contentious court case to determine the existence of a 
common law marriage. 

The purpose of this MontGuide is to explore Montana 

common law marriages from an estate planning 
perspective. Topics included are: 

•  The definition of common law marriage;
•  What establishes a common law marriage;
•  What documentation is necessary for a common law 

marriage; and

•  What amount the surviving spouse of a common law 

marriage inherits.
The MontGuide does NOT examine federal or state 
rules for common law marriages for the determination of 
benefits established by the Social Security Administration 
or the Montana Workers’ Compensation Bureau or the 
determination of income taxes by the Internal Revenue 
Service or Montana Department of Revenue.

What is a common law marriage?
A common law marriage is one formed without a license 
and solemnization by a minister, a priest, a judge of 
a court of record or by a public official whose powers 
include solemnization of marriages (mayor, city judge, or 
justice of the peace). 

The State of Montana recognizes both formal 

marriages which comply with the marriage statutes and 
common law marriages which do not comply with the 
marriage statutes, but nonetheless meet the requirements 
set out in Montana case law. Montana is one of nine 
states that allow common law marriages.

What establishes a common law 
marriage in Montana?
The Montana Supreme Court has established three 
elements for creating a common law marriage. The party 
asserting the existence of a common law marriage must 
prove the following three elements to the district court. 

First, the parties were competent to enter into a marriage. 

The competency requirements for a common law 
marriage are the same as those in a traditional marriage. 
The parties cannot be related. They cannot be already and 

MontGuideFor More Online MontGuides, Visit www.msuextension.orgfor them as a family, the three of them were able married 
to someone else. They must have the mental capacity to 
enter into a marital relationship. 

Second, the parties assumed a marital relationship 
by mutual consent and agreement. This means the two 
people expressed their intent to be married and also each 
expressed this desire to the other. The mutual consent of 
the parties does not need to be expressed in any particular 
form and can be implied from the conduct of the parties. 
Other ways of expressing mutual consent vary from 
marriage to marriage. The agreement may occur privately 
without anyone else present or it could be witnessed by 
many. However, in Montana two people cannot create an 
unintended common law marriage. 

Third, the parties confirmed their marriage by 

cohabitation and public repute. Common law marriages 
validated by the Montana Supreme Court typically 
have focused on this element. Because the common law 
marriage elements cannot be established immediately, 
particularly cohabitation and public repute, the Court 
does not require the party seeking to establish the 
common law marriage to prove they all happened 
immediately or instantly.

While cohabitation is one issue the court will consider, 

it is not the determining factor. The perception that if a 
couple lives together for a certain number of years, they 
automatically have a common law marriage is wrong. 
There is no specific length of time of living together that 
creates a common law marriage in Montana.

To determine whether a couple has held themselves out 

to the public as married, the Montana Supreme Court 
considers a number of actions including, but not limited 
to, exchanging rings, taking the partner’s last name, filing 
joint tax returns, referring to one another as husband and 
wife or spouses, and filling out documents/forms with a 
signature line indicating “spouse.”

Having different last names is not proof positive 
one way or the other of the existence of a common 
law marriage. Maintaining separate financial accounts 
or having joint accounts may not matter. Holding 
themselves out as married to the public, friends, and 
family would be an indicator of marriage.

The best case for common law marriage would be 
a combination of all these factors. However in some 
court cases only one or two of the factors existed for the 
marriage to be considered common law. The clearer the 
proof, for example all the neighbors said they thought the 
couple were married, or both wore wedding rings, or they 
had the same last name, the more likely the district court 
will rule the marriage as common law.

Two competent individuals could live together their 
whole adult lives and never form a common law marriage. 

If they never represented themselves to the community at 
large as spouses; if they never acted as if they were a married 
couple rather than a pair living together; and if they never 
said “we are married;” then a common law marriage does 
not exist. District courts and ultimately the Montana 
Supreme Court consider all the facts presented in each case.

What documentation could provide 
proof of a Montana common law 
marriage while both parties are living?
A couple wanting to demonstrate a marital relationship 
by mutual consent and agreement (the second element of 
a common law marriage) could complete the Affidavit of 
Common Law Marriage form from the Montana State 
Law Library (https://courts.mt.gov/forms/marriage).  
Click on Forms.

The form is signed by the couple and sworn before a 
notary public for the State of Montana. The form states: 

“Your signature on this document may be considered proof 
of a common law marriage. A common law marriage carries 
the same rights and responsibilities as a solemnized marriage. 
If you have any questions about the effects of the document, 
you should contact an attorney.” 

The completed form can be used in situations where 
proof of marriage is required, such as applying for Social 
Security benefits. The affidavit could also be used by 
a surviving spouse of a common law marriage who is 
applying for appointment as a personal representative for 
the deceased’s estate.

The Montana Legislature has created another 

method that can be used to document a common law 
marriage. A couple may file a Declaration of Marriage 
without Solemnization with the Clerk of the District 
Court. The document serves as an official record of 
the marriage of the two parties and the date the two 
agreed they were married. The declaration can be 
typed or handwritten. The information to be included 
in a Declaration of Marriage is listed in a fact sheet 
at this site: www.co.yellowstone.mt.gov/clerk_court/
DeclarationofMarriageInformationSheet.pdf. In 2019 the 
cost to file a declaration is $53, the same as a marriage 
license.

Is a common law marriage recognized 
on reservations in Montana?
Twelve tribal nations are within the boundaries of 
Montana. These tribal nations govern seven reservations. 
Each reservation has a tribal code that either validates 
or prohibits common law marriages. Individuals should 
review the most current version of the tribal code on their 
reservation to determine whether a common law marriage 
is recognized.

2

Is a Montana common law marriage 
legal in other states?
A common law marriage recognized in Montana will 
be accepted by every state in the nation. Eight other 
states and the District of Columbia recognize common 
law marriages formed within their borders: Alabama, 
Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Rhode Island, South Carolina, 
Texas, and Utah. Montana also accepts common law 
marriages recognized in these states.

How is a common law marriage 
terminated?
A common law marriage is a real marriage and requires a 
legal Dissolution of Marriage (commonly referred to as a 
divorce) to terminate the marriage. The State Law Library 
provides the appropriate forms for ending a marriage in 
Montana. An attorney could also be consulted to assure 
the legal rights of each party are protected (http://courts.
mt.gov/forms/end_marriage).  

Upon a separation or dissolution of marriage, the rights 

and duties of the parents of the children are outlined 
in a Parenting Plan. The State Law Library of Montana 
provides the appropriate forms for developing a Parenting 
Plan http://courts.mt.gov/forms/dissolution/kid. The legal 
advice of an attorney could also be helpful to protect the 
rights of the children.

Are children of a common law marriage 
“legitimate?”
Children of a common law marriage are “legitimate” 
children of the marriage. Even without a formal or 
common law marriage, Montana law considers all 
children “legitimate.” Children have the same inheritance 
rights as outlined in scenarios one through six on pages 
5-7 in this MontGuide.

May the spouse in a common law 
marriage be appointed as personal 
representative?
Each party in a common law marriage can write a 
will and nominate the other to carry out his or her 
plan for the settlement of the estate. In Montana, the 
individual who performs this function is called a personal 
representative. The district judge or the clerk of court 
makes the appointment based on the nomination in the 
written will. In performing his or her duties, a personal 
representative must follow procedures set out in the 
Montana Uniform Probate Code (UPC).

If an individual dies without writing a will, the district 

judge appoints a personal representative based on a 
priority order in the Montana UPC. The surviving spouse 

of a common law marriage has priority over all other 
relatives to be appointed as personal representative.

What amount does a surviving spouse in 
a common law marriage inherit?
The surviving spouse of a common law marriage has the 
same rights of inheritance under the Montana Uniform 
Probate Code (UPC) as any other surviving beneficiaries. 
However, the amount passing to a surviving spouse 
depends upon whether the decedent (person who died) 
has surviving parents or lineal descendants (children, 
grandchildren or great grandchildren). Different family 
situations are described in scenarios one through six. Each 
scenario assumes the decedent had property titled in his 
or her name only.

What other factors determine the 
distribution of the estate in a common 
law marriage?
The Montana UPC as outlined in scenarios one through 
six provides for the distribution of a deceased Montanan’s 
property assuming he/she died without a written will or 
trust. For further information see the MSU Extension 
Montguides, Wills (MT198906HR) and Revocable Living 
Trusts (MT199612HR).

The distribution of the estate also depends upon two 

additional factors.

1.   How the property is titled. In other words, whose 
name appears on the real property, checking and 
savings accounts, stocks, bonds, and mutual funds? 
Is the property solely owned? Is the property titled 
as joint tenancy with right of survivorship or as 
tenants in common? For further information see 
the Montguide, Property Ownership: Estate Planning 
(MT198907HR).

  If the property is held in joint tenants with right of 
survivorship between the couple, the property passes 
automatically to the survivor.  Proof of common law 
marriage is not necessary.

2.   Presence of a beneficiary designation. In other 

words, did the deceased owner designate who was to 
receive the asset upon his/her death with a transfer 
on death deed on his/her real property, payable on 
death designation (POD) on bank and credit union 
accounts, transfer on death registration (TOD) on 
stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, and/or beneficiary 
designations on life insurance and retirement 
accounts? For further information, see the Montguide, 
Designating Beneficiaries Through Contractual 
Arrangements (MT199901HR).

Revisit John and Mary’s situation
Let’s examine the situation of John and Mary, the couple 
mentioned at the beginning of this MontGuide who had 
lived together for 15 years. When John died he had a $2 
million ranch. Let’s see how these additional factors and 
“what ifs” determine the distribution of John’s estate.

What if John titled the property in his name and he 
had written a will?
Assume John titled the $2 million ranch in his name 
only. He wrote a will leaving the ranch to his children. 
In Montana a person cannot completely disinherit a 
spouse. If Mary proves a common law marriage, she, as 
the surviving spouse, could be entitled up to 100 percent. 
The percentage varies depending upon how long the 
court determines they were in a common law marriage. 
For further information see the Montguide, Dying 
Without a Will in Montana: Who Receives Your Property 
(MT198908HR).

On the other hand, a person can completely disinherit 

children. If John had written a will leaving the ranch 
to Mary, (whether or not she qualified as a common 
law spouse), she receives the ranch. His children receive 
nothing. For further information see the Montguide, 
Property Ownership: Estate Planning (MT198907HR).

What if John titled the ranch in his name and he 
filed a transfer on deed on the property?
In 2019, Montana legislature authorized transfer on 
death deeds as a way for people to transfer at death 
their real property (located in Montana) to one or more 
designated beneficiaries without probate. For further 
information, see the Montguide, Transfer on Death Deeds 
in Montana (MT200707HR).

From 2007 until October 1, 2019 the term beneficiary 
deeds was used to transfer real property on death.  Those 
deeds are still effective.

•  Mary as designated beneficiary: If John had the 

ranch titled in his name only and later filed a transfer 
on death deed naming Mary as the designated 
beneficiary, upon his death the ranch automatically 
becomes Mary’s. Why? Because the transfer on death 
deed listed her as the designated beneficiary. His 
children receive nothing. 

•  Transfer on Death Deed and a Will: If John wrote 
a will leaving the ranch to his two children; they 
would not receive it if Mary is listed as the designated 
beneficiary on the transfer on death deed. A transfer 
on death deed overrides John’s will. His children 
receive nothing. For further information see the 
Montguide, Transfer on Death Deeds in Montana 
(MT200707HR).

•  John’s children as designated beneficiaries: If 

John titled the property in his name only and later 
decided he didn’t want Mary to receive the ranch, 
he could file a new transfer on death deed naming 
his children as the designated beneficiaries. In this 
case, the children receive the ranch automatically 
after his death. This is true even if John wrote a will 
leaving the ranch to Mary. The transfer on death deed 
overrides John’s will.

However, if Mary proves a common law marriage 
existed, then she could claim she was disinherited by 
John’s transfer on death deed. Under the Montana UPC, 
she could claim she was a surviving spouse and receive up 
to 100 percent of the value of the ranch depending upon 
the number of years the common law marriage existed.

What if John titled the property in joint tenancy 
with right of survivorship with Mary?
Under Montana contract law, property titled in joint 
tenancy with right of survivorship automatically passes to 
the surviving joint tenant. Assume the $2 million ranch 
was titled in joint tenancy with right of survivorship 
between John and Mary. Upon the death of John, the 
$2 million ranch automatically passes to Mary. John’s 
children do not inherit anything. For further information 
see the Montguide, Property Ownership: Estate Planning 
(MT198907HR).

What if John wrote a will leaving the ranch to 
his two children after the joint tenancy with right 
of survivorship title on the ranch with Mary was 
formed?
Whether John wrote a will or after the joint tenancy 
doesn’t matter.

The joint tenancy with right of survivorship with 
Mary overrides John’s written will. Upon John’s death 
Mary becomes owner of the ranch because she was the 
surviving joint tenant. John’s children do not inherit.

What if John titled the property in joint tenancy 
with right of survivorship with his children?
Assume John titled his ranch property in joint tenancy 
with right of survivorship with his children. If Mary 
proves a common law marriage existed, then she could 
claim she was disinherited because of joint tenancy 
contract. Under the Montana UPC the percentage that 
a surviving spouse receives depends on the number of 
years of the marriage. For example, if the common law 
marriage was established as lasting 15 years the surviving 
spouse could receive 100 percent of the augmented estate.

1. Under the Montana UPC, if the survivor is a common law spouse and the decedent has no surviving descendants 

(children, grandchildren, great grandchildren) or surviving parent(s), the surviving spouse receives all the 
decedent’s estate.

SCENARIO 1a – Common Law Marriage: Melissa and Frank 
have lived together for seven years. Melissa has property 
solely in her name valued at $400,000. While she does 
not have children or living parents, she does have two 
living brothers and two living sisters. Assume Melissa dies 
without a will and Frank claims he is a surviving spouse. If 
a common law marriage is proven, all $400,000 passes to 
Frank.

Legal Heir: Frank, Common Law Spouse

SCENARIO 1b – No Common Law Marriage: However, if the 
court rules Melissa and Frank did NOT have a common law 
marriage, Melissa’s two brothers and two sisters inherit all 
$400,000. Each sibling receives $100,000.
Figure for Scenario 1b: No Common Law Marriage
Legal Heirs: Melissa’s Brothers and Sisters

2. Under the Montana UPC, if the survivors are a common law spouse and descendants of both the decedent and 

surviving common law spouse, all of the estate passes to the spouse.

SCENARIO 2a – Common Law Marriage: John and Mary 
have lived together for 25 years. While they have three 
children, they are not married. Neither have children from a 
previous marriage. John has an estate valued at $300,000 
titled in his name only.
     Assume John dies without a will. In district court Mary 
asserts a common law marriage. If Mary’s claim is proven, 
all $300,000 passes to her. The children of John and Mary 
do not inherit because they are descendants of both John 
and Mary and neither John nor Mary has any other surviving 
descendants.

Legal Heirs: Mary, Common Law Spouse; John and Mary’s

SCENARIO 2b – No Common Law Marriage: However, if 
the common law marriage between John and Mary is NOT 
proven, all property passes equally to John’s children (who 
are the three from his relationship with Mary). Mary receives 
nothing.

3.  Under the Montana UPC, if the survivors are a spouse, (whether common law or formally married) and the 

decedent’s parents, the estate is divided as follows: the first $300,000 and ¾ of the balance passes to the 
spouse. The decedent’s parents share the remaining ¼. If the estate is valued at $300,000 or less, the common 
law spouse receives all. The parents receive nothing.

SCENARIO 3a – Common Law Marriage: Tim and Sharon 
have lived together for 10 years. Tim has property valued at 
$600,000 titled in his name only. They do not have children. 
Tim’s parents are living. 
Assume Tim dies without a will. If Sharon proves to the 
district court she is Tim’s common law marriage wife, she 
receives the first $300,000 and ¾ of the balance for a total 
of $525,000.* Tim’s parents share the remaining ¼ with 
$37,500 to each.**
Figure for Scenario 3a: Common Law Marriage
Legal Heirs: Tim’s Parents; Sharon, Common Law Spouse

SCENARIO 3b – No Common Law Marriage: However, if 
the district court determines a common law marriage did 
NOT exist between Tim and Sharon, all Tim’s property 
valued at $600,000 passes to his parents in equal shares 
($300,000). Sharon receives nothing.
Figure for Scenario 3b: No Common Law Marriage
Legal Heirs: Tim’s Parents

*Calculation for Sharon’s share as the surviving spouse.
  $600,000 - $300,000 = $300,000 balance
  $300,000 balance x .75 = $225,000
  $225,000 + $300,000 = $525,000

**Calculation for Tim’s parents shares.
    $600,000 - $525,000 (Sharon’s share) = $75,000
    $75,000 ÷ 2 = $37,500 for each parent

4.  Under the Montana UPC, if the survivors are the spouse (whether common law or formally married), and 

descendants of both the decedent and surviving spouse; AND if the surviving common law spouse has one or 
more surviving descendants who are not descendants of the decedent, the common law spouse receives the first 
$225,000 plus ½ of the balance. The decedent’s children share the remaining ½. Stepchildren do not inherit.

SCENARIO 4a – Common Law Marriage: Gail has an estate 
valued at $600,000 titled in her name only. Gail and Fred 
have lived together for eight years and have two children 
together. Fred also has a daughter from a prior marriage. 
Assume Gail dies without a will. If Fred proves in district 
court he is the surviving spouse of a common law marriage, 
he receives $225,000 and half of the balance for a total 
of $562,500.* Gail’s children share the remaining portion 
of the estate, $37,500; $18,750 each.** Fred’s daughter 
from his previous marriage does not receive any of Gail’s 
estate.
Figure for Scenario 4a: Common Law Marriage
Legal Heirs: Fred, Common Law Spouse; Fred and Gail’s 
children

SCENARIO 4b – No Common Law Marriage: However, if 
the common law marriage is NOT recognized between Gail 
and Fred, Gail’s two children from her relationship with Fred 
inherit the entire $600,000. Neither Fred nor his child from 
a prior marriage inherits anything from Gail’s estate.
Figure for Scenario 4b: No Common Law Marriage
Legal Heirs: Gail’s two children

*Calculation for Fred’s share as the surviving spouse.
  $600,000 - $225,000 = $375,000 balance
  $375,000 balance x .50 = $187,500
  $375,000 + $187,500 = $562,500

**Calculation for shares for Gail’s children.
     $600,000 - $562,500 (Fred’s share) = $37,500

5. Under the Montana UPC, if the survivors are the spouse (whether common law or formally married) and 

descendants of the decedent who are not descendants of the spouse; the spouse of the common law marriage 
receives the first $150,000 plus ½ of the balance. The decedent’s children share the remaining ½.

SCENARIO 5a – Common Law Marriage: Ron and Donna 
have lived together for three years. Ron has two children 
from a previous marriage. Donna has no children. Ron’s 
estate is valued at $600,000 and titled in his name 
only. Assume Ron dies without a will. Donna proves she 
is surviving spouse of their common law marriage. She 
receives the first $150,000 and half of the remaining 
balance for a total of $375,000.* Ron’s two children from 
a previous marriage split the remaining balance of the 
estate of $225,000. Each child receives $112,500.**

Legal Heirs: Donna, Common Law Spouse and Ron’s two 
children from his previous marriage

SCENARIO 5b – No Common Law Marriage: However, if 
the common law marriage between Donna and Ron is NOT 
recognized, Ron’s two children share $600,000. Each child 
receives $300,000. Donna receives nothing from Ron’s 
estate.

Legal Heirs: Ron’s two children from previous marriage

*Calculation for Donna’s share as surviving spouse.
  $600,000 - $150,000 = $450,000
  $450,000 x .50 = $225,000
  $150,000 + $2250,000 = $375,000

**Calculation for shares to the children of Ron.
     $600,000 - $375,000 (Donna’s share) = $225,000
     $225,000 ÷ 2 = $112,500 each to Ron’s children

6.  Under the Montana UPC, if the decedent does not have a surviving spouse, descendants or parents, the property 
passes to his/her brothers and sisters and to their descendants by representation. By representation means the 
descendants take the share the parent would have received had the parent lived.

SCENARIO 6a – Common Law Marriage: Jeff and Laura 
have lived together for 12 years. Laura has a $2 million 
ranch titled in her name only. She does not have children. 
She has two living brothers and two nephews and a niece 
from two brothers who passed away years ago.
     Assume Laura dies without a will. Jeff proves he is a 
surviving spouse of a common law marriage. He receives 
the $2 million ranch. Laura’s brothers, nephews, and her 
niece receive nothing.
Figure for Scenario 6a: Common Law Marriage
Legal Heir: Jeff, Common Law Spouse

SCENARIO 6b – No Common Law Marriage: However, if the 
district court rules Jeff and Laura did NOT have a common 
law marriage, Laura’s two brothers each receive a ¼ interest 
in the ranch. The other ½ passes by representation to the 
children of Laura’s deceased brothers. Her niece receives 
¼ and her two nephews each receive a ¹/8 interest in the 
ranch.
Figure for Scenario 6b: No Common Law Marriage
Legal Heirs: Laura’s two living brothers; two nephews and a 
niece from two brothers who are deceased

The ranch is then owned by five people. The new ownership 
raises important questions. Who is the decision maker 
for the ranch? Will each heir want his/her inheritance in 
dollars? Will one party buy out the other and at what price?

Summary
Couples living together should be aware that a court 
could later find their actions constitute a marriage. 
They should be careful not to hold themselves out as 
married unless they are willing to accept the possible legal 
ramifications. 

Common law marriages have estate planning 

consequences, not only for the couple, but also for their 
family members. Children may be concerned about 
their inheritance rights if one of their parents is “living 
together” with someone who is not their parent. One of 
the partners may also wonder if “living together” for a 
certain number of years proves the existence of a common 
law marriage. 

If an estate planning goal is to protect the inheritance 

rights of a surviving spouse, then a signed Affidavit of 
Common Law Marriage form is one method of proving 
mutual consent and agreement. A Declaration of 
Marriage without Solemnization also serves as an official 
record of the marriage of the two parties.

If an estate planning goal is to protect the inheritance 

rights of children, grandchildren, parents, and siblings, 
or others, then a will can be written or a trust established. 
The drafting of a will or trust and the related broader 
matter of estate planning involves decisions requiring 
professional skill and judgment, which can be obtained 
only through years of training, study and experience. An 
attorney is the appropriate professional to consult about 
legal documents such as wills, trusts, or contracts that are 
best suited for your individual situation. 

By waiting until after death to take action, the 

survivor must prove to the district court the existence of a 
common law marriage based on three elements. First, the 
parties were competent to enter into a marriage. Second, 
the parties assumed a marital relationship by mutual 
consent and agreement. Third, the parties confirmed their 
marriage by cohabitation and public repute. Proof may 
vary from case to case depending on the statements of the 
witnesses and what exhibits are presented to the district 
court. A wiser course of action for cohabiting couples is 
to obtain legal advice while both are alive to clarify their 
legal status.
