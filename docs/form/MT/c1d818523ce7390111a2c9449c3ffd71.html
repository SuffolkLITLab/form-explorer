agreement.

ho can use this form letter? 

 

You can use this form letter if the tenant has (at least 

one of the following):  

•  a month-to-month or week-to-week tenancy; 

•  not paid rent; 
• 

received  notice  of  a  lease  violation  within  the 

last 6 months and has committed substantially the same violation again; 

•  engaged or knowingly allowed any person to engage in an activity on the 

premises  that  creates  a  reasonable  potential  of  damage  to  the  rental  or 

injury to neighbors (see Section 70-24-321(3), MCA);

•  an unauthorized pet or person living in the rental; 

•  destroyed,  defaced,  damaged,  impaired  or  removed  any  part  of  the 

premises; 

•  refused to give you lawful access to the rental; 

•  removed, replaced, or added a lock to the rental and not given you a key; 
OR 
•  committed  some  other  non-compliance  or  violation  of 

the  rental 

agreement.   

 

You cannot use this form letter if you are renting only a lot to the tenant for the 

tenant’s  own  mobile  home.    But  you  can  use  this  form  letter  if  you  are  renting 

both the lot and the mobile home to the tenant. 

fter I give notice of termination, when does the tenant need to 

After you give the tenant notice of termination, the time the tenant has to move 

depends on the reason given in the notice.  In some situations the tenant has the 

right  to remedy  or fix  the  violation  instead of  moving  out.    See  the  chart  below.  

The form letter you fill out will give the tenant notice of how much time they have 

to move out.  Remember: if your rental agreement gives a longer notice time than 

this  chart,  you  must  give  the  tenant  the  notice  time  required  by  the  rental 

agreement. 

o  I  have  to  give  the  tenant  the  opportunity  to  remedy  the 

violation after receiving my notice of termination? 

Maybe  –  it  depends  on  the  kind  of  violation  alleged  in  the  notice.  Montana  law 

provides,  “If  the  noncompliance  [alleged  in  the  notice  of  termination]  is 

remediable  by  repairs,  the  payment  of  damages,  or  otherwise  and  the  tenant 

adequately remedies the noncompliance before the date specified in the notice, 

the rental agreement does not terminate.” Section 70-24-422(1)(a), MCA.

What  can  I  do  if  the  tenant  does  not  move  out  or  fix  the 

violation? 

You  can  sue  the  tenant  in  court  for  possession  of  the  rental  if  they  have  not 

moved  out  or  fixed  the  violation  in  the  time  given  in  your  notice  of  termination.  

You may not remove a tenant without a court order.  You may not have someone 

else remove the tenant without a court order.  You may not shut off the tenant’s 

utilities or change the locks on the rental without a court order.

Hand-delivery of the letter to the tenant.  If you choose this option, 

you  must  actually  hand  the  letter  to  the  tenant.  The  law  does  not 

allow you to tape it to the door to the rental, to leave it with a child 

or other person at the rental, or to leave it inside the rental.  It is a 

good  idea  to  bring  two  copies  of  the  letter.    If  possible,  ask  the 

tenant to sign and date one copy of the letter as “received.”  Keep

that copy as proof that the tenant got your letter and give the tenant 

the second copy.  In case the tenant will not sign the letter, it is a 

good  idea  to  bring  someone  with  you  when  you  hand-deliver  it.  

That person  can  testify  in  court  later  if the  tenant  denies  receiving 

your  letter.    If  you  choose  to  hand-deliver  the  letter,  the  notice 

period starts on the day after you hand the letter to the tenant.  For 

example, if you hand-deliver a letter giving  a 3-day notice on April 

2, the tenant is not required to vacate until April 5. 

 

  Mail  the  letter  to  the  tenant,  by  first-class  mail  with  a  certificate  of 

mailing,  or  by  certified  mail.  Keep  the  receipt  you  get  from  the 

Postal  Service.    The  receipt  is  your  proof  that  you  sent  the  letter. 

With  a  certificate  of  mailing,  the  tenant  will  not  have  to  sign 

anything to get the letter. 

If  you  choose  to  mail  the  notice,  then  the  notice  period  begins  to 

run  on  the  3rd  day  after  the  date  that  you  mailed  the  letter.    For 

example,  if  you  mail  a  letter  giving  a  3-day  notice  on  April  2,  the 

tenant is not required to vacate until April 8 (April 2 + 3 days mailing 

= April 5 + 3 days notice = April 8).   

 

Email the letter to the tenant, if the tenant provided their electronic 

mail address  in  the  rental  agreement.  Notice  by  email  is  complete 

upon  receipt  of  a  read  receipt  generated  by  an  email  system,  or 

upon  an  email  reply  other  than  an  automatically  generated  email

here can I get more information? 

The  laws  of  Montana  are  called  the  Montana  Code  Annotated  or  “MCA.”  The 

laws about giving notice to a tenant to vacate are located in the MCA at Title 70, 

Chapter 24, Section 422 and Section 441.  An easier way to write that is: § 70-

24-422,  MCA,  and §  70-24-441,  MCA.   The symbol  § means  section.   You  can

The letter to the tenant refers to specific sections of the law.  It is a good idea to 

read those sections of the law before you give the letter to the tenant.

If  you  don’t  remedy  the  noncompliance  within  the  14  days,  then  I  am 

ending  your  tenancy  and  you  must  move  out  within  14  days  after  you 

receive this notice.  Sections 70-24-422(1)(a) and -422(1)(d), MCA. 

OTE:  If I mailed this letter to you, you may add 3 days to the date of mailing 

before  you  start  counting  the  days  in  the  notice  period  given  above.    For 

example, if I mailed a letter giving  you a 3-day notice on April 2, you would not 

have to move out until April 8 (April 2 + 3 days mailing = April 5 + 3 days notice = 

April 8).  If I hand-delivered this letter to you, start counting the days in the notice 

period on the day after you received the letter.  For example, if I hand-delivered a 

letter giving you a 3-day notice on April 2, you would not have to move out until 

f you have not remedied your lease violation or moved out in the number of days 

given above, I may file an eviction lawsuit against you in court.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
