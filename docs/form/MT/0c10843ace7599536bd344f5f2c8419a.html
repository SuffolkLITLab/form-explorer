      <pre>What Are Your Rights 
Over Your Remains?

By Marsha A. Goetting, Ph.D., CFP®, CFCS, Professor and Family Economics 
Specialist, and Jane Wolery, MSU Teton County Extension Agent

The Montana Right of Disposition Act allows a person to provide instructions 
for disposing of his or her remains or to designate an agent with authority to 
make such decisions.

MontGuide

 MT200918HR Revised 1/17

During a family get-together, Margaret announced to her four 
children that she wanted to be cremated after she died. Two 
years later, Margaret passed away. While her daughter wanted 
to follow her mom’s wishes, Margaret’s three sons disagreed. 
Because the local mortician was faced with following the 
direction of the majority of the children, Margaret was 
buried in the local cemetery. Years later Margaret’s daughter 
still refuses to communicate with her three brothers because 
they didn't honor their mother's wishes about what she 
wanted done with her body after she died.

Jack told his two children from his first marriage that he 

wanted to be buried in the small cemetery that bordered 
his ranch land. After Jack’s death his present wife decided 
that he would be cremated and that she would keep the 
urn containing the remains. While Jack’s children strongly 
objected, the surviving spouse’s preferences prevailed over the 
wishes of his children.

These are examples of situations that have occurred because 
of uncertainty under prior law about who has the right 
to make decisions about a deceased’s remains. With the 
enactment of the Montana Right of Disposition Act, 
Montanans can now provide “disposition directions” and 
know that their choice has legal priority over any of their 
survivors’ wishes.

Methods of providing “disposition 
directions”
The act allows Montanans who are 18 years of age or older 
and of sound mind to arrange for funeral goods and services 
as well as to indicate what they wish to be done with their 
bodies or remains after death. Any one of the four methods 
below provides legal authority for the deceased’s wishes to 
have priority over the preferences of survivors:
1.  Prepaid funeral contract:  Prior to death, a person can 
make a prepaid funeral contract with a licensed mortuary. 
There are two types of prepaid funeral contracts recognized 
under Montana law – a funeral trust and a funeral insurance 

policy. On either document the licensed mortuary is listed 
as the beneficiary. In return, the mortuary promises to 
provide the prepaid funeral goods or services that were 
specified in the contact. 
Example A:  Carl visited his local mortuary and made 
arrangements for his funeral and burial. He signed a 
prepaid funeral contract and placed a copy with his letter 
of last instructions. He also briefly explained his wishes 
to his wife and children and told them these documents 
were in his file drawer in a folder labeled “Letter of 
Last Instruction.” For further information, see the 
MSU Extension Montguide, Letter of Last Instructions, 
MT198904HR.

2.  Written Disposition Direction:  A second method 
for making a disposition direction under Montana law is 
a written instrument that can be typed, handwritten, or 
computer generated. The person and two witnesses (all must 
be at least 18 years of age and of sound mind) must sign the 
written instrument. Letters of last instructions, a will, a trust 
document, a power of attorney, or a health care directive 
that contains specific instructions about the disposition of 
the deceased’s remains, will qualify as a written instrument if 
signed by the deceased and two witnesses. 
Example B:  Robin wrote a letter of last instructions in 
which she indicated that she wanted to be buried in 
Highwood Cemetery in a coffin made of white pine 
harvested from the family’s forest land. Robin requested 
that during the funeral service her good friends, Jane and 
Katelyn, share a couple of funny incidents about their 
years of growing up together. Robin signed the letter, and 
asked two of her neighbors, both of whom were over 18 
years old, to witness and sign it. 

3.  Signed Affidavit:  The third method of making a 
disposition direction under Montana law is an affidavit. 
A person can authorize another person to control the 
disposition of his or her remains in an affidavit that is signed 
before a notary public. 

For More Online MontGuides, Visit www.msuextension.orgExample C:  Jeff wants his wife to decide how to dispose of 
his remains. He feels that his wife would reach a decision 
that would comfort her, their five children and other family 
members. Jeff prepared a written affidavit designating his 
wife as his agent to dispose of his remains and signed it 
before a notary public. If Jeff wanted to limit his wife’s 
decisions, he could attach specific instructions to the 
affidavit. For example, he could direct her to choose whether 
to have his remains cremated and scattered among the 
wildflowers or have his body buried in the local cemetery. 

Figure 1 is a sample affidavit that is provided in the Montana 
statute for granting authority to another person to make 
decisions about the disposition of a deceased’s remains.

montana.edu/estateplanning/documents/sampleaffidavit.pdf.

4.  Videotaped Disposition Direction:  A fourth method 
of providing a disposition direction under Montana law 
is a video. A person can record a video in which his or her 
disposition preferences are described. A written confirmation 
of the video’s existence and accuracy must be signed by two 
witnesses who are at least 18 years of age and of sound mind. 
Example D:  John asked a friend to videotape him 

explaining that he wanted to be cremated after his death. 
John requested that his family have a “Celebration of 
Life” service. He asked his wife and two children to 
scatter his ashes along his favorite riding trail. John’s two 
close friends, who were over age 18, were present at the 
videotaping. John’s friends each signed and dated a written 
confirmation of the existence of the videotape.

Who has priority for decisions about the 
disposition of remains? 
If a Montanan dies without providing disposition directions 
in one of the four methods listed previously, then the 
authority passes to individuals in the following priority, 
provided that they are 18 years or older and of sound mind:
1) Surviving spouse of the deceased;
2) Sole surviving child of the deceased or, if there is more 
than one child of the deceased, the majority of the surviving 
children. However, less than one-half of the surviving 
children may assume “right of disposition,” if those children 
have used reasonable efforts to notify all other children and 
they are not aware of opposition of more than one-half of all 
children.
3) Surviving parent or parents of the deceased. If one of 
the surviving parents is absent, the remaining parent may 
dispose of the remains if that parent’s reasonable efforts have 
been unsuccessful in locating the absent surviving parent.
4) Surviving sibling of the deceased or, if there is more than 
one sibling of the deceased, the majority of the surviving 
siblings. However, less than one-half of the surviving 
siblings may dispose of remains, if those siblings have used 
reasonable efforts to notify all other siblings and they are not 
aware of any opposition of more than one-half of all siblings.
5) If the deceased is not survived by a spouse, children, or 
siblings, the statute provides priority to others, including 
grandparents, a legal guardian, a personal representative, or 
more distant relatives. 

Arrangements provided by survivors
The survivors can choose at their own expense, arrangements 
for funeral services that do not conflict with the prepaid 
funeral contract, written instrument, video, or affidavit 
“disposition directions” of the deceased.

Loss of “right of disposition”
Under certain circumstances (as outlined below) a person 
can lose his or her right to make disposition decisions. If a 
person loses “right of disposition,” it is passed to the next 
qualifying individual.
1) If the person does not exercise his or her “right of 
disposition” within two days after notification of the death 
of the deceased or within three days after the deceased's 
death, whichever is earlier, then the right is forfeited.
2) A surviving spouse loses his or her “right of disposition” if 
a petition to dissolve the marriage was pending at the time of 
the deceased's death.
3) If the district court determines that the person entitled to 
the “right of disposition” was estranged from the deceased 
at the time of death, then the right is forfeited. Estranged 
is defined in the statute as meaning that the person had a 
physical and emotional separation from the deceased. The 

estrangement must have existed for a period of time prior 
to death and clearly demonstrates an absence of the person’s 
affection, trust, and regard for the deceased.
4) If the person is charged with deliberate or negligent 
homicide in connection with the deceased's death, then he 
or she must forfeit his or her “right of disposition” unless the 
charges are dismissed, or if the person is acquitted prior to 
the exercise of a “right of disposition” by others with priority.

Disputes among those sharing “right of 
disposition”
If there is a dispute as to who has priority, or if a majority of 
those having priority (such as siblings or children) cannot 
reach a decision about what should be done with the 
deceased’s remains, they may file a petition for an order of 
disposition with the district court. A mortician with custody 
of the remains may also file a petition for an order of 
disposition. 

In making a determination about who has “right of 
disposition,” the district court considers several factors 
including:

•  Reasonableness and practicality of any proposed funeral 

arrangements and disposition;

•  Degree of the personal relationship between the deceased 

and each of the persons who are claiming “right of 
disposition;”

•  Desires of the person(s) willing to pay the costs of the 

funeral arrangements and disposition. 

•  Convenience and needs of other family and friends 

wishing to pay respects to the deceased;

•  Desires of the deceased; and

•  Degree to which the funeral arrangements would allow 
maximum participation by all those wishing to pay their 
respects to the deceased.

•  The fact that a person has paid or agreed to pay for all 
or part of the funeral arrangements or disposition of a 
deceased’s remains does not give him or her a greater “right 
of disposition” than he or she would otherwise have.

Responsibilities of morticians, if there is 
a dispute
If a dispute arises among family members about who has 
“right of disposition,” a mortician may not be held liable 
for refusing to accept the remains of the deceased. A 
mortician may also not be liable for refusing to complete 
the arrangements for final disposition until the parties come 
to an agreement or the district court issues an order for 
disposition. If the mortician retains the deceased’s remains 
while the parties are in disagreement, the mortician may 
preserve the body pending resolution of the dispute and add 
such expenses to the final disposition bill. 

3

A mortician may act according to the instructions of 
the first person with priority to contact him or her unless 
and until others (such as children who share priority) 
notify the mortician of any objections in writing. A person 
who represents that he or she has priority as to “rights of 
disposition” is considered to be giving a warranty as to the 
truthfulness of his or her identity and authority. The Act 
protects morticians who rely in good faith on the instructions 
of an individual claiming a “right of disposition.”  

Summary
The Montana Right of Disposition Act allows Montanans 
who are 18 years of age or older and of sound mind to direct 
the disposition of their remains and to arrange for funeral 
goods and services by any of the following methods:   

•  Prepaid funeral contract;  

•  Written disposition direction; that is signed by the 

deceased and two witnesses

•  Signed affidavit before a notary that authorizes another 

person to make disposition decisions for the deceased; or  

•  Videotaped disposition direction 

The Montana statute lists a ranking order of individuals 
who can assume the “right of disposition” if a Montanan does 
not make prior arrangements. If a majority of the people 
with the right to make decisions cannot agree, they can file 
a petition for an order of disposition. The district judge then 
makes a decision about disposing of the deceased’s remains or 
determines who has priority to make the decision.
