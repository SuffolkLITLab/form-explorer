 MT199213HR  Revised 11/18

RETIREMENT…WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU?   
Time to do what you want… when you want to? More 
time for family and friends? Travel to places on your 
“bucket-list?” New hobbies and pursuits? Perhaps a 
vacation home? Regardless of how you visualize your 
“golden years,” achieving your retirement goals won’t 
happen overnight. You have to make a plan and revise 
it periodically based on your changing situation and/or 
what is happening in the economy. 

Many people achieve success by depositing money 
in a number of different retirement savings “building 
blocks” such as Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), 
Keoghs, and company pension plans (401(k), 403(b), 
SEPs, SIMPLES). After they have taken advantage of 
these “building blocks” to provide income to supplement 
Social Security, some have also chosen to purchase 
an annuity outright or utilize their pension funds to 
purchase one. 

What is an annuity?
Basically, an annuity is a contract between an individual 
and an insurance company or another person. The 
individual pays a premium, and in return, the other party 
agrees to make payments to the individual during that 
person’s lifetime and/or to the individual’s survivors. 

Basic types of annuities
The most common type of annuity is termed a 
commercial annuity. It is typically issued by an insurance 
company for cash. An individual pays a sum of money to 
the company (the insurer) that promises to make periodic 
payments for the remainder of the annuitant’s life (the 
purchaser). Annuitants may elect to have the payments 
continue for survivors for a higher premium. Or, for the 
same premium, annuitants may choose a reduced beneﬁt 
so survivor beneﬁts can be provided.

A private annuity differs from a commercial annuity in 

two ways: 1) property other than cash is used to acquire 
the annuity, and 2) the promise to make the payments is 
made by an individual rather than an insurance company. 
Payments from a private annuity are not insured by 
the Montana Life and Health Insurance Guaranty 
Association.

A private annuity could be used by parents who want 

to transfer a farm, ranch or other business to a younger 
family member in exchange for a guaranteed income 
for life. The transferred asset receives a new income tax 
basis for the purchaser equal to the present value of the 
annuity payments to be made. 

While a private annuity usually ceases upon death 

of the annuitant, there are some drawbacks and tax 
ramiﬁcations. If the parent(s) live longer than their life 
expectancies, the younger family member will have paid 
out more than the value of the asset he/she acquired. 
The parents’ future income ﬂow is secured only by 
the annuity agreement and not by a mortgage on the 
property. Annuity payments made to the parents are not 
like mortgage payments whereby the interest portion is 
tax deductible. 

If the younger family member dies before the parent, 

his estate is legally obligated to continue to pay the 
annuity until the parent dies. Competent legal and 
accounting advice is recommended for Montanans who 
want to set up a private annuity to minimize potential 
adverse legal and tax consequences for all parties 
involved.

A charitable gift annuity is a contract between 
an individual and a charity (instead of an insurance 
company). An individual or married couple gives 
money or property to a charity and receives an income 
tax deduction at the time of the gift (donation) equal 
to the portion anticipated to go to charity when the 

MontGuideFor More Online MontGuides, Visit www.msuextension.organnuitant(s) dies. The charity agrees to pay an annuity to 
one or more individuals and/or other annuitant(s) for his/
her/their lives. Unless the charity commercially reinsures 
the annuity, it is backed only by the charity’s total assets. 
There is no guarantee of payment if the charity goes 
bankrupt, which is why Montana law only permits 
charities above a certain threshold of ﬁnancial strength to 
issue gift annuities. 

Individuals considering a charitable gift annuity should 

have the contract examined by an attorney to make sure 
it meets their retirement and estate planning goals. This 
planned gift instrument is generally preferred by older 
individuals who want the security of a ﬁxed payment, 
and want the tax beneﬁts now, but do not want to 
beneﬁt the charity until they pass away. A gift annuity 
is a also a planned gift which will entitle the purchaser 
to the 40 percent Montana Endowment Tax Credit for 
the charitable gift portion of the transaction if the other 
requirements of the credit are met. For more information 
see the MSU Extension MontGuide, Save Montana 
Income Taxes with a Charitable Gift Annuity: A Legacy 
qualifying for the Montana Endowment Tax Credit (METC) 
(MT201807HR). 

Categorization of annuities
Annuities are typically categorized by: timing of 
income payments, purchase payments, and investment 
performance. 
Timing of payments.  An immediate annuity starts 
payments to an individual within 12 months of the 
annuity purchase date. Immediate annuities are generally 
purchased by people who have reached retirement age. A 
deferred annuity starts payments more than 12 months 
after the purchase date as stated in the contract or policy. 
Deferred annuities are often purchased by people who are 
saving money towards retirement. A longevity annuity 
pays an income for life, but only if the annuitant lives to a 
certain age. For example, a person could pay an insurance 
company a lump-sum of money at age 65 for an annuity 
in return for a monthly income starting at age 85.
Purchase payments.  An annuity can be purchased 
with a single sum or with a series of payments. One 
purchased with a single sum is called a single payment or 
single premium annuity. Immediate annuities are always 
purchased with a single sum. An annuity purchased with 
a series of payments is called a periodic payment, multiple 
premiums or a ﬂexible premium annuity. Deferred 
annuities are generally purchased with a series of payments.
Investment performance.  There are three types of 
annuities categorized by investment performance: ﬁxed, 
equity-indexed, and variable. 

A ﬁxed or guaranteed annuity provides an interest rate 

guaranteed by the insurance company. The amount of 
income paid to the annuitant is generally set when the 
payments begin and does not change. An interest rate is 
locked in for an initial period, typically one to three years. 
When the period ends, the insurance company designates 
a new rate of return for the next time period. 

Most ﬁxed annuities have a minimum guaranteed rate 

the insurance company will pay regardless of economic 
conditions. However, the guarantee is only as good as the 
company. There is no guarantee that a ﬁxed annuity will 
pay more than the rate of inﬂation. Because the payment 
is ﬁxed, it is not likely to keep pace with inﬂation 
especially over a long period of time. A ﬁxed annuity does 
not protect an annuitant’s assets from lawsuits or seizures.
An equity-indexed annuity is a variation of a ﬁxed 

annuity. The interest rate is based on one of the published 
stock market indexes, such as Standard & Poor’s 500 or 
Vanguard 500. The value of any index varies from day-
to-day and is not predictable. The annuity promises to 
pay a minimum interest rate, but the rate of return could 
be higher if the stock market index increases in value. An 
equity-indexed annuity does not protect an annuitant’s 
assets from lawsuits or seizures.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners and 
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) provide 
two publications for those considering the purchase of 
equity-indexed annuities. Buyer's Guide to Fixed Deferred 
Annuities with Appendix for Equity-Indexed Annuities 
explains indexing methods, terms, participation rates, and 
cap rates (www.naic.org/documents/prod_serv_consumer_
anb_le.pdf). Equity-Indexed Annuities-A Complex Choice 
explains: index methods annual reset, high water mark 
and point-to-point (www.finra.org/investors/alerts/equity-
indexed-annuities_a-complex-choice).

Variable annuities are securities registered with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. The purchaser, 
rather than the insurance company, decides how 
to allocate the annuity premium among possible 
investments. Typically an annuitant will select a family of 
mutual funds that invest in stocks, bonds, money market 
instruments, or a combination of the three. A variable 
annuity does not protect an annuitant’s assets from 
lawsuits or seizures.

Variable annuities offer the potential to earn more 
than a ﬁxed annuity, but the value of the annuity can also 
decrease with changes in the mutual funds’ values. The 
guaranteed minimum return is typically 87.5 percent of 
the premium paid with 1 to 3 percent interest. 

2

If the value of the underlying mutual funds and the 
rate of return are adjusted with inﬂation, a variable rate 
annuity may provide some protection against inﬂation. 
There is no guarantee that variable annuities will keep 
pace with inﬂation. 

 Some variable annuities have a death beneﬁt. If the 

annuitant dies before the insurer has started making 
payments, the beneﬁciary receives a speciﬁed amount – 
typically the amount of the annuitant’s purchase payments. 
When money is withdrawn from a variable annuity, the 

annuitant is taxed on the earnings at an ordinary income 
tax rate rather than a lower capital gains rate that would 
be paid on a direct investment. In general, the beneﬁts of 
tax-deferral outweigh the costs of a variable annuity only 
if it is held as a long-term investment to meet retirement 
and other long-range goals.

FINRA provides two publications about variable annuities:

hard-sell)

 

 

and, Should You Exchange Your Variable Annuity?

variable-annuity)

information in Variable Annuities (www.investor.gov/
additional-resources/general-resources/publications-
research/publications/variable-annuities)

Charges for Annuities
There are a variety of charges that should be considered 
when purchasing an annuity: surrender charges, annual 
charges, fees and expenses, and charges for special features. 
Surrender charge.  This is the amount charged if funds are 
withdrawn before a certain period of time. The surrender 
charge is typically a percentage of the amount withdrawn 
during the ﬁrst 7 to 15 years of the annuity contract. The 
charge declines gradually over a period of several years, 
known as the surrender period. For example, a 10 percent 
charge could apply in the ﬁrst year after a purchase of 
the annuity, and decline by one percent per year until it 
reaches zero percent 10 years later. Some contracts allow 
an annuitant to withdraw a part of the account value 
each year, for example 10 percent or 15 percent, without 
paying surrender charges.
Annual charge.  This is the amount charged annually 
for the cost of administering the annuity contract. 
Annual charges may range from $25 to $40 depending 

on amount in the annuity. Some companies charge a 
percentage of the account value (typically in the range of 
0.15 percent per year).
Fees and expenses.  The interest rate quoted for a ﬁxed 
annuity is the amount to be paid to the annuitant after 
the insurance company deducts fees and expenses from 
the rate earned on the underlying investments. The 
expenses for a variable annuity are frequently called 
mortality and expense risk charges. The fees may range 
annually from 1 to 2 percent of the amount of assets in 
the annuity. There are also speciﬁc mutual fund fees for 
variable annuity contracts that include maintenance and 
management investment advisory fees. The management 
advisory fees are calculated as a percentage of the fund 
assets. Be sure to ask if the historical rates of returns 
quoted are after expenses.
Other Charges.  Special features offered by some variable 
annuities (for example death beneﬁt, bonus credit, 
long-term care insurance) carry additional fees. Other 
annuities have fees for initial sales load (similar to a 
commission investors pay when they purchase any type of 
security from a broker) or fees for transferring part of the 
account from one investment option to another. Annual 
fees can reach 2 percent or more of the annuity’s value. 
The prospectus of a variable annuity describes fees and 
expenses. The potential purchaser should insist that all 
fees be explained by the sales representative. 

Methods of paying benefits 
There are 5 methods of paying beneﬁts provided in a 
typical annuity: (1) straight life or lifetime-only; (2) 
installment-refund annuity; (3) cash-refund annuity; 
(4) life-and-period-certain annuity; and (5) joint-and-
survivor annuity.

A straight-life or lifetime-only annuity pays the 

annuitant until death, regardless of whether he or she lives 
to age 100 or dies shortly after signing the contract. This 
type of annuity is usually used by people who need larger 
monthly incomes, who do not have dependents, or who 
plan to provide ﬁnancial resources for their dependents in 
another way.

An installment-refund annuity provides lifetime income 

to the annuitant, and if the annuitant dies, pays the 
remainder of the original investment to the beneﬁciary in 
monthly installments. This type is often used by people 
who want to provide a lifetime income for a beneﬁciary, 
rather than a lump sum payment.

A cash-refund annuity works like an installment-

refund except that the survivor receives the balance of the 
premiums the annuitant paid to the company in a lump 
sum. This option is often used by an annuitant who believes 
a beneﬁciary is capable of managing a lump sum of money.

3

A life-and-period-certain annuity pays the annuitant and 
a beneﬁciary for a speciﬁed number of years with a typical 
amount of time of 10, 15, or 20 years. If an annuitant 
purchases a 15-year life-and-period-certain annuity and 
dies after 8 years, his/her beneﬁciary will receive monthly 
payments for the remaining 7 years of the contract. This 
type is used by an annuitant who wants money to last for 
a certain number of years and wants his/her beneﬁciaries 
to receive the balance as an inheritance.

A joint-and-survivor annuity pays until both the 
annuitant and his or her beneﬁciary are deceased. The 
amount of the monthly check is based on the ages of 
the annuitant and the beneﬁciary. Joint-and-survivor 
contracts can pay 100 percent, 75 percent, 67 percent 
or 50 percent of the monthly beneﬁt to a survivor. This 
type is used to provide a lifetime income to a survivor to 
supplement his/her other sources of income.                     

Tax Consequences: Income, Estate and 
Inheritance
Income.  An annuitant is not taxed annually on the 
interest earnings that are held in an annuity. Federal and 
state income tax on interest earning annuities is deferred 
until the annuitant starts receiving monthly payments, 
then the earnings are taxable. 
Tax-deferred Contributions.  Annuities that meet speciﬁc 
legal requirements can offer the additional tax advantage 
of pre-tax contributions, typically termed tax-deferred 
annuities. Types of employer plans permitting pre-tax 
contributions include: 401(a), 401(k), 403(a), 403(b), 
and 402(b) plans; Simpliﬁed Employee Pension Plans; 
and 457 Deferred Compensations Plans. 

The major advantage of a tax-deferred annuity is that 
neither contributions nor interest earned are subject to 
federal or state income taxation until withdrawn. This 
effectively lowers gross income of the employee and 
reduces annual state and federal income tax liabilities 

similar to traditional (ordinary) Individual Retirement 
Accounts (IRAs). 

When an employee withdraws funds from a tax-
deferred annuity, the amount is subject to state and 
federal income taxation (See Chart 1). There may be 
an additional 10 percent federal penalty for amounts 
withdrawn before age 59½ unless the annuitant becomes 
totally and permanently disabled, takes out the money in 
a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the 
annuitant’s life or the joint lives of the annuitant and his/
her designated beneﬁciary, or dies.
Tax-Free 1035 Exchange.  Annuitants can exchange 
an existing variable annuity contract for a new contract 
without paying any tax on the income and investment 
gains. A 1035 exchange can be useful if another annuity 
has better features, such as a larger death beneﬁt, different 
annuity payout, or a wider selection of investment choices. 
The new annuity will impose a new surrender charge 
period that generally begins when the exchange is made. 
Generally an annuitant should exchange an annuity 
only after asking these questions and comparing beneﬁts 
with an existing policy:
•  What is the total cost of this exchange?

•  What is the new surrender period?

•  What new features are being offered? 

•  Do I need or want these features? 

•  Could a feature such as long-term care insurance be 

purchased separately at less cost?

•  Are additional features worth the increased cost?

•  What is the length of the free-look period?

Investors should not sign any form to agree to 
exchange an annuity until their options are carefully 
studied, their questions are answered, and they are 
satisﬁed the exchange is better than their current 
contracts.

FINRA provides a publication with more information about 
exchanging a variable annuity, Should You Exchange Your 
Variable Annuity (www.finra.org/investors/alerts/should-
you-exchange-your-variable-annuity).  

Federal Estate Tax.  The value of an annuity is included 
in a decedent’s gross estate for federal estate tax purposes, 
unless it is the type of annuity that stops payment upon 
the death of the annuitant. The amount that can be 
included is based on the proportion of the purchase price 
contributed by the decedent and the determination of the 
present value of the future payments to the beneﬁciary 
using appropriate IRS annuity tables and regulations.
However, if the value of the deceased’s total estate 
including lifetime taxable gifts and the annuity is less 
than $11,180,000 (in 2018, adjusted annually for 
inﬂation), no federal estate tax return is required to be 
ﬁled (unless the decedent is survived by a spouse and the 
deceased spouse’s unused exemption is to be allocated to 
the surviving spouse) and no tax is due. 

The underlying mutual funds of variable annuities 

do not receive a “step-up” in cost basis when the 
owner dies like they would if the mutual funds were 
purchased outside the annuity. Any deferred income in 
the policy will be taxable to the beneﬁciaries as ordinary 
income at their tax rates. For more information see 
the MSU Extension MontGuide, Federal Estate Tax 
(MT199104HR).
State Inheritance Tax.  Because Montana no longer has a 
state inheritance tax, proceeds of an annuity pass to his/
her beneﬁciaries inheritance tax-free. 
Probate.  If an annuitant has selected a survivor beneﬁt 
with a named beneﬁciary, the proceeds are not subject to 
the probate process in Montana. The annuity contract 
with a named beneﬁciary has priority, so a provision in a 
will naming a different beneﬁciary would be invalid. 

Who’s selling that annuity? 
Commercial annuities are only as good as the company 
selling them. Investigate the rating of the company before 
making a purchase. There are ﬁve major rating businesses 
that grade insurance companies on their ﬁnancial health 
and ability to pay claims: 
•  A.M. Best Company, www.ambest.com 

•  Duff & Phelps, www.duffandphelps.com

•  Moody’s, www.moodys.com

•  Standard & Poor’s (S&P), www.standardandpoors.com 

•  Weiss, www.weissratings.com 

The challenge for consumers is that each rating service 

has a different deﬁnition for ﬁnancial stability and also 
different rating codes. As an example, A++ is the top 
grade from A.M. Best, but second on S&P’s. While a 
high rating does not guarantee the company will remain 
in business, it is one of the best indicators available for 
consumers to gauge an insurance company’s balance sheet 
strength and operating performance.

Montana Protections
Montana law provides protections for consumers 
considering the purchase of an annuity. These legal 
protections are enforced by the Montana Commissioner 
of Securities and Insurance, available online at www.csi.
mt.gov or by calling 800-332-6148.
Licensing.  The person who sells an annuity to a 
Montanan is required to be a licensed life insurance agent 
and, in the case of a variable annuity, also a licensed 
securities broker. The company selling the annuity must 
also be licensed in Montana. To determine if your agent/
dealer and company are licensed in Montana see the 
FINRA BrokerCheck online at https://brokercheck.
ﬁnra.org/ or call 800-289-9999. You can also contact the 
Montana Commissioner of Securities and Insurance at 
producerlicensing@mt.gov or call toll-free 800-332-6148. 
Montana Life & Health Insurance Guaranty 
Association. If a life insurance company becomes 
insolvent and is ordered by a court to liquidate, the 
Montana Life & Health Insurance Guaranty Association 
provides protection for Montana residents who hold 
covered policies and contracts with the insolvent insurer. 
The limit is $250,000 per person. However, the coverage 
does not extend to any portion of a policy or contract 
that the insurer does not guarantee, such as investments 
in a variable annuity contract. All insurers licensed to sell 
annuities in the state are members of the Montana Life & 
Health Insurance Guaranty Association.
Montana Annuity Disclosure Act.  The Montana 
legislature passed this Act to provide standards for the 
disclosure of minimum information about annuity 
contracts. When the application for an annuity contract 
is made in a face-to-face meeting, the applicant must be 
given a disclosure document and a buyer’s guide. 

When the application is taken by means other than in a 
face-to-face meeting such as mail, email, or by the internet, 
the applicant must be sent both the disclosure document 
and buyer’s guide not later than ﬁve business days after the 
completed application is received by the insurer. 

When a disclosure document and buyer’s guide are not 

provided at or before the time of application, a free-look 
period of 15 days must be provided for the applicant 
to return the annuity contract without penalty. Many 

5

companies have a free-look period starting after the policy 
is physically delivered.           

Items required in a disclosure document are the 

following:
1. Name of the contract, the company product name (if 
different), the form number and the fact that it is an 
annuity.

2. Insurer’s name and address.

3. Speciﬁc dollar amount of percentage charges and fees 

with an explanation of how they apply. 

4. Information about the surrender guaranteed rate for 

new contracts that contains a clear notice that the rate 
is subject to change.

5. Description of the contract and its beneﬁts, 
emphasizing its long-term nature, including: 
a.  Guaranteed elements, nonguaranteed elements and 
determinable elements of the contract and their 
limitations, if any; and, an explanation of how the 
elements operate;

b.  Explanation of the initial crediting rate, specifying 
any bonus or introductory portion, the duration 
of the rate and the fact that rates may change from 
time to time and are not guaranteed;

c.  Periodic income options both on a guaranteed and 

nonguaranteed basis;

d.  Any value reductions caused by withdrawals from 

or surrender of the contract;

e.  How values in the contract can be accessed;
f.  Death beneﬁt, if one is available, and how it will be 

calculated;

g.  Summary of the federal tax status of the contract 

and any penalties applicable on withdrawal of values

Cautions for Annuity Investors
To help you determine whether an annuity is appropriate 
for your situation, the National Association of Insurance 
Commissioners suggests you ask the following questions:
•  What is my life expectancy? Are there any factors 

to indicate that I will live longer or shorter than the 
life expectancy tables indicate? Life expectancy is 
particularly important when considering a private 
annuity. If your life expectancy is not long and you 
have enough assets, an annuity may not be necessary.

•  How much retirement income will I need in addition 
to what I will receive from Social Security, my pension 
plan, and potential income from assets including 
investments?

•  Do I need to provide supplementary income for other 

family members?

•  How long do I plan to leave money in the annuity?

•  When do I plan to need income payments?

•  Will the annuity allow me to gain access to the money 

when I need it?

•  What is my level of risk tolerance?

1.  Do I want a ﬁxed annuity with a guaranteed interest  
 rate and little or no risk of losing the principal? 
2.  Do I want a variable annuity with the potential     

for higher earnings that are not guaranteed and the        
possibility that I may lose principal? 

3.  Or, am I somewhere in between a ﬁxed or variable  
annuity and willing to take some risks with an   
equity-indexed annuity?

•   Did the insurance agent provide a history of the 

company’s guaranteed renewal rates? 

•   Have I considered all the tax consequences of 

purchasing an annuity, including the effect of annuity 
payments on my tax status during retirement?

Summary
Annuities can be an effective retirement and estate 
planning tool for some people. Compare information 
for similar contracts from several companies. Comparing 
products and their costs may help you make a better 
decision. Consult a ﬁnancial advisor for further 
information about commercial and private annuities 
for your speciﬁc situation. Discuss legal implications of 
private and charitable annuities with an attorney. Contact 
a certiﬁed public accountant about the tax implications of 
a commercial, private, or charitable annuity.

To assure that your annuity is accomplishing 
your ﬁnancial goals, the contract should be reviewed 
periodically, as part of your estate and retirement 
planning process. When there is a dramatic change in 
your ﬁnancial situation (divorce, death of spouse or other 
beneﬁciary, or birth of a child), your plans should be 
reviewed.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
