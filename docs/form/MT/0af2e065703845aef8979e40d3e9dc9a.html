Petitioner – The Petitioner is the person who first asked the court for 
something by filing a petition. If you are using this form to  respond to 
a Petition for Dissolution of Marriage, the Petitioner      is your current 
spouse. 

espondent – The Respondent is the person who must respond to a 

court case by filing a Response. You are the Respondent in your 
case because you must file a Response to Petition for Dissolution of 
Marriage or Petition for Parenting Plan.  

ro Se – This term is used to notify the court and the Petitioner that 
you are representing yourself and that you are not being represented 
by a lawyer in your dissolution of marriage case.  

issolution of Marriage – This is the legal term for “divorce” used by 

the courts in Montana.  

arenting – Montana no longer uses the words “custody” and 

“visitation,” instead, it uses the terms “parenting” or “parenting time.”   

efault Judgment – This is a judgment granted to a Petitioner when 
the Respondent does not file a Response within the 21 day deadline.

equitable and in the best interests  of the children. 

ounter-Petition – The Counter-Petition allows the Respondent to 
ask the court for something just as if the Respondent were filing an 
original Petition. The Counter-Petition should be used to ask the court 
to decide on issues that may have been left out of the original 
Petition.

How Do I Use The Response To Petition For Dissolution 
Of Marriage or Parenting Plan Form? 
Complete the following steps: 

tep One: Fill In The Response Form And Other Documents 

[ ] Fill in the Response to Petition for Dissolution of Marriage or 
Petition for Parenting Plan form completely. The paragraph numbers 
match up exactly so you are either agreeing or disagreeing with the 
information in each paragraph of the Petition.  

tep Two: File Your Response With The Court 

[ ] You will need to file the original and two copies of all of your 
documents with the Clerk of  District Court. 

 ] Upon payment of the filing fee, the Clerk of District Court will 
docket and return your copies to you.  In the event you are submitting 
an application for a Fee Waiver your original documents will not be 
filed until the Fee Waiver is approved or your fee is paid. 

tep Three: Send A Copy To The Petitioner (Your Spouse or 

Other Parent) 
Once you have filed your Response, and the other documents, it is 
your responsibility to send copies to the Petitioner.

other party in the manner you have indicated in your Certificate of 
Service (first class mail or hand delivery) and you need to keep a 
copy for your records. Mail a copy to the Petitioner at the address 
listed on the Petition you were served with.

mediation before their dissolution or parenting plan case will be heard 
by the Court. You will find out if you are required to attend mediation 
through a Scheduling Order.

attend mediation. If you are a victim of domestic violence at the 
hands of the Petitioner, you have the option of notifying the Judge

that you chose not to attend the mediation. This means your case will 
go directly to the hearing stage, described below.  

tep Six: Prepare For A Hearing In Front Of The Judge

Parenting Plan action is contested and a Judge will hold a hearing to

evidence should include any paperwork or witnesses that will 
persuade the Judge to decide the contested issues in your favor.

a contested issue.

marital property is a contested issue. 

-  Bring documentation proving that you owned property before 

the marriage, if that property is a contested issue.  

vidence about your child: 

-  Report cards 
-  Attendance records from school/daycare 
-  Progress reports from school/daycare 
-  Health care providers’ progress/treatment reports 
-  Mental health care providers’ notes/diagnoses/treatment 

reports 

vidence about parents/family members/others who play a 

significant role in your child’s life: 

-  Health care providers’ treatment reports 
-  Mental health care providers/chemical dependency providers’ 

notes/diagnoses/treatment reports

 ] You should write down and practice the questions that you want to 
ask your spouse at the hearing. Important: Only ask questions that 
you think will help your case.  

 ] You should also practice what you want to say to the Judge. 
Practice with a friend until you feel comfortable with everything that 
you want to say.  

tep Seven: Go To The Hearing 

[ ] The time and date for the hearing will be sent to you on a court 
document normally called a “Scheduling Order.” You must attend that 
hearing. Be at the courthouse at least 15 minutes before your 
scheduled hearing time. Dress as you would for an important job 
interview. Ask the Clerk of District Court which courtroom your Judge 
is in. Go to the appropriate courtroom and wait for the Judge to call 
your name and cause number. Be calm and polite and address the 
Judge as “Your Honor.” 

 ] Bring all of your court papers to the hearing.

the Judge with ask him/her to be sworn in and take the witness stand. 
The Petitioner will be allowed to tell his/her side of the story. Then 
you will be allowed to ask the Petitioner any questions you have 
prepared. 

he judge will then ask you to take the witness stand. You should 
bring your evidence with you. You will then be allowed to tell your 
side of the story. The Petitioner will be given the opportunity to ask 
you any question he/she has prepared.  

fter the hearing, the Judge will enter a final ruling on the contested 
issues in your Dissolution or Parenting Plan case. It may take awhile 
for the Judge to enter a final ruling. However, once the ruling has 
been made, the Judge will mail a copy to you.

necessarily a dollar for dollar credit. 

.  Contingency Medical Support. 

If the minor child(ren) are either (i) covered by Medicaid, (ii) are not covered under an 

existing insurance plan, or (iii) if the existing coverage becomes no longer available, the 

following provisions shall apply: 

a. 

The Petitioner must provide medical coverage for the child(ren), as long 

as it is available at reasonable cost, and as long as there is no other 

insurance plan that will better serve the parties.   

b. 

The Respondent must provide medical coverage for the child(ren), as long 

as it is available at reasonable cost, and as long as there is no other 

insurance plan that will better serve the parties.   

c. 

Both parties must provide insurance, if both parents have insurance plans 

that are at a combined reasonable cost and whose benefits are 

complementary or compatible with each other. 

e.  

If the primary parent has obtained individual insurance or a health benefits 

plan for the child, both parents may agree in writing to share the costs of 

maintaining the coverage. 

f. 

If circumstances change and a party believes that changes in cost are not 

reasonable or cost-beneficial, the party may ask the court to change the 

medical support order.
