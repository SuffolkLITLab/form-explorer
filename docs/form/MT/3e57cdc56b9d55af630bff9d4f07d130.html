      <pre>Telling  Your  Landlord  that  the  Notice  to 
Vacate was Improper 
(You  should  not  use  this  form  letter  if  you  own  a  mobile  home  and 
rent only the lot that it sits on from your landlord.) 

Note: Use these instructions and form letter to write a letter to the landlord.  In 
the letter you will tell the landlord that the notice to vacate that the landlord gave 
you is not proper under the law.

These instructions and form letter may not be right for your case.  They cannot 
take the place of advice from a lawyer.  Talk to a lawyer if you have any
questions.

Do not change this form letter. If you change the form letter, you might lose 
language you need.  

Do not use these instructions and form letter if you own a mobile home and rent 
only the lot from your landlord, or if you have a federal rent subsidy such as 
Section 8 (also known as “Housing Choice Voucher”).  The laws are different 
laws for those situations.

What form will I need? 

You  only  need  one  form.    The  form  is  the  form  letter  that  follows  these 

instructions.  The form letter begins on page 7 of this packet. 

Who can use this form letter? 

You can use this form letter if:  

(cid:120)  You  rent  an  apartment,  house,  room,  or  mobile 

home  (NOTE:  If  you  rent  both  a  mobile  home 

and a lot, you can use this form.  But if you own 

your  mobile  home  and  only  rent  the  lot,  do  not 

use this form); AND 

(cid:120) The landlord is trying to evict you; AND 

(cid:120)  The landlord’s notice to vacate did not meet all of the requirements of the 

Montana Residential Landlord Tenant Act.

How do I know if the landlord’s notice is proper under the law? 

Any notice to vacate from the landlord must: 

(cid:120)  Be in writing; AND 

(cid:120)  Specify  the  correct  number  of  days  for  you  to  vacate,  depending  on  the 

reason  for  the  notice  as  set  out  in  Montana  law.    The  next  section  gives 

the correct number of days for the most common situations.

What if the landlord orally told me to move but did not give me a 
written notice? 

The  law  requires  a  landlord  to  give  a  tenant  written  notice  to  vacate  a  rental.  

Requiring a written notice helps avoid arguments between landlords and tenants 

about  whether  a  landlord  actually  gave  notice.    The  law  also  helps  avoid 

arguments  about  whether  the  landlord  included  all  the  information  the  law 

requires in the notice.

What are the requirements for the landlord’s notice to vacate in 
the most common situations?

1. Month-to-month  tenancy.    You  have  a  month-to-month  tenancy  if  (1)  the 

rental agreement is oral (spoken, not written) and you pay your rent by the 

month,  or  (2)  the  rental  agreement  is  written  and  its  term  is  month-to-

month.    According  to  Section  70-24-441(2),  MCA,  the  landlord  must  give 

you  written  notice  at  least  30  days  before  the  date  the  landlord  wants  to 

end  the  tenancy.    (“MCA”  stands  for  “Montana  Code  Annotated.”)    The 

landlord  does  not  need  to  have  a  good  reason  to  end  the  tenancy.    The 

landlord can end a month-to-month tenancy for no reason at all. 

2. Week--to-week  tenancy.    You  have  a  week-to-week  tenancy  if  (1)  the 

rental agreement is oral (spoken, not written) and you pay your rent by the 

week, or (2) the rental agreement is written and its term is week-to-week.

Association. Use of this form is restricted to not-for-profit purposes. 

Last updated: 09/22/2009

According  to  Section  70-24-441(1),  MCA,  the  landlord  must  give  you 

written  notice  at  least  7  days  before  the  date  your  landlord  wants  to  end 

the  tenancy.    The  landlord  does  not  need  to  have  a  good  reason  to  end 

the tenancy.  The landlord can end a week-to-week tenancy for no reason 

at all. 

3. Nonpayment  of  rent.  If  you  are  behind  on  the  rent,  the  notice  must  give 

you at least 3 days to pay the rent, according to Section 70-24-422, MCA.

4. Repeated  violation.    A  repeated  violation  of  the  rental  agreement  means 

that the landlord gave you a notice for violating the rental agreement and 

you  committed  the  same  violation  again  within  six  months.    According  to 

Section  70-24-422,  MCA,  the  new  notice  of  the  repeated  violation  must 

give you at least 5 days to vacate.

5. Arrest.  The landlord may give you notice to vacate if you were arrested or 

charged  with  one  of  the  three  criminal  offenses  provided  under  Section 

70-24-321(3),  MCA:  1)  criminal  production  or  manufacture  of  dangerous 

drugs, 2) operation of an unlawful laboratory, or 3) gang-related activities.  

The notice must say that the landlord is ending the tenancy because of the 

arrest  or  charge.    The  notice  must  also  say  what  you  were  arrested  or 

charged with.  According to Section 70-24-422, MCA, the notice must give 

you at least 3 days to vacate. 

6. Unauthorized  pet  or  person.    You  have  an  unauthorized  pet  or  person  if 

you have a person or pet living with you that is prohibited under the rental 

agreement.  Section 70-24-422, MCA, says that the landlord’s notice must 

give  you  at  least  3  days  to  either  vacate  the  premises  or  get  rid  of  the 

unauthorized pet or person.

7. Destruction of the rental property.  If you have destroyed or removed any 

part  of  the  rental  property,  Section  70-24-422,  MCA,  says  the  landlord’s 

notice must give you at least 3 days to vacate.  The law is not clear about 

whether you have the right to fix the problem within those 3 days to avoid 

eviction.  If you prefer to fix the problem within 3 days rather than to move, 

talk to the landlord.  

8. Other  violations.    For  any  violation  not  specifically  mentioned  in  the  law, 

the landlord must give you at least 14 days to vacate. 

How do I use the form letter? 

1 

Complete the form letter and sign it 

Make  sure  all  of  the  blanks  on  the  form  letter  are  filled  in 

completely.

Sign the form letter on the blank that says “(sign your name).”

2 

Make a copy 

Make  one  copy  of  the  completed  and  signed  letter  for  yourself.  

Keep  the  copy  in  a  safe  place.    It  may  be 

important if you have to go to court.

3

Deliver the letter 

 

 

You have two choices of how to deliver the letter to the landlord: 

 

Hand-deliver  the  letter  to  the  landlord.    If  you  choose  this  option, 

you must either (1) actually hand the letter to the landlord in person, 

or  (2)  leave  it  at  the  landlord’s  place  of  business  if  the  landlord 

made the rental agreement through that business.  It is a good idea 

to bring two copies of the letter.  If possible, ask the landlord to sign 

and  date  one  copy  of  the  letter  as  “received.”    Keep  that  copy  as

Association. Use of this form is restricted to not-for-profit purposes.

proof  that  the  landlord  got  your  letter,  and  give  the  landlord  the 

second  copy.    In  case  the  landlord  will  not  sign  the  letter,  it  is  a 

good  idea  to  bring  someone  with  you  when  you  hand-deliver  the 

letter  to  the  landlord.    That  person  can  testify  in  court  later  if  the 

landlord denies receiving your letter.

OR

Mail the letter to the landlord.  It is a good idea to mail the letter by 

first-class  mail  with  a  Certificate  of  Mailing.    The  post  office  will 

charge  you  more  for  the  Certificate  of  Mailing,  but  it  is  worth  it.  

Keep the Certificate of Mailing receipt. The Certificate of Mailing is 

your proof that you sent the letter.  With a Certificate of Mailing, the 

landlord  will  not  have  to  sign  anything  to  get  your  letter.    The 

landlord cannot refuse delivery.

Where can I get more information? 

The  laws  of  Montana  are  called  the  Montana  Code  Annotated  or  “MCA.”    The 

laws about giving notice to a tenant to vacate are located in the MCA at Title 70, 

Chapter 24, Section 422 and Section 441. An easier way to write that is: § 70-24-

422, MCA, and § 70-24-441, MCA.  The symbol § means section.  The MCA can 

be  found  at  your  local  library  or  on  the  Montana  State  Law  Library  website  at 

www.lawlibrary.mt.gov.    Click  on  the  “Laws”  option  near  the  top  of  the  page  on 

that website, and then click on “MCA.”

The letter to the landlord refers to specific sections of the law.  It is a good idea to 

read those sections of the law before you send the letter to the landlord.

Your  recent  notice  of  termination  of  my  tenancy  was  improper  according  to  the

4.  Your notice did not give me the opportunity to correct the violation,

5.  Your notice did not comply with the law for other reasons. 

Because  your  notice  of  termination  of  my  tenancy  was  improper,  you  cannot 

legally  evict  me  at  this  time.    I  may  raise  this  as  a  defense  if  you  sue  me  for 

eviction.

Sincerely,
