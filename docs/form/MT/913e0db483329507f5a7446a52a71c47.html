      <pre>Adopting Your Step-Child 

Note: Use these instructions and forms to adopt your step-child. 

These instructions and forms may not be right for your case. They can not 
take the place of advice from a lawyer. Talk to a lawyer if you have any
questions.

Do not change these forms.  If you change the forms, you might lose language 
you need.

What Forms Will I Need to Adopt My Step-Child? 

You will need to fill out and file the following forms to adopt your step-child: 

(cid:120)  Petition for Stepparent Adoption 

(cid:120)  Agreement to Accept Temporary Custody 

(cid:120)  Waiver of Parental Rights (unless the other parent’s rights have 

(cid:120)  Child’s Consent to Stepparent Adoption (only if your stepchild is 12 

already been terminated) 

(cid:120)  Consent to Stepparent Adoption 

or older) 

(cid:120)  Order Setting Hearing 

(cid:120)  Stepparent Adoption Decree 

(cid:120)  Affidavit of Inability to Pay (only if you cannot afford filing fees) 

The Petition asks the court to create a parent/child relationship between you and 

your step-child. It also asks the court to end the parent/child relationship between 

one of the parent’s of the child and the child.

Association. Use of this form is restricted to not-for-profit purposes.  

Last updated 09/03/2008 

The Agreement to Accept Temporary Custody tells the parent who is giving 

up parental rights to the child that you will accept temporary custody of and 

provide care and support for your stepchild until the Court makes a decision 

about the adoption. 

The Waiver of Parental Rights is filled out by the parent giving  

up custody, care, and control of the child. It tells the court that the parent is 

knowingly waiving his or her rights to the child. 

The Consent to Stepparent Adoption is filled out by your spouse, the child’s 

other parent.  It tells the court that your spouse wants you to adopt the child and 

understands that the other natural parent’s rights to the child are ended by the 

stepparent adoption. 

The Child’s Consent must be completed by the child you are adopting if the 

child is 12 years of age or older.  It tells the court that the child wants to be 

adopted by you. 

The Order Setting Hearing will be filled out by the Judge after s/he reads your 

Petition and decides when your hearing should be.

The Stepparent Adoption Decree is filled out by the Court once the stepparent 

adoption is complete.  It ends the child’s parent/child relationship with one parent 

and creates a new parent/child relationship between the stepparent and the child. 

What Words Do I Need to Know? 

Petitioner- A Petitioner is someone who files an action in court.  If you are the 

stepparent wanting to adopt your stepchild, you are the Petitioner.

Relinquishing Parent- The relinquishing parent is the parent who is giving up 

custody, care, and control of the child so that the stepparent may adopt. 

Who Can Use the Forms? 

You can use these forms if: 

(cid:120)  your spouse has legal and physical custody of the child; and

(cid:120) 

the child has lived with you and your spouse during the 60 days 

before the Petition is filed; and

(cid:120) 

the other parent of the child agrees in writing to give up his or her 

parental rights, or, the parental rights of the other parent have 

(cid:120) 

if the child being adopted is 12 years old or older, he or she wants 

already been terminated; and

to be adopted by you.

Note: It may be possible to adopt your stepchild even if you 
have not met all of the conditions above.  However, you can 
not use these forms to do so.  You should talk to a lawyer if 
you have any questions.

4. 

By signing this, I know that I am relinquishing or giving up all of my 

parental rights and agreeing to the stepparent adoption.  I am agreeing to 

the transfer of permanent physical and legal custody to, and the adoption 

of the child by, the child’s stepparent.  I am doing this voluntarily and 

unequivocally.  In other words, this is my choice and I have not been 

forced by anyone to make it.  I am completely sure about my decision.

I know that I cannot change my mind once this is signed.  Any failure by 

the stepparent or other parent to allow me to visit or talk with the child will 

have no affect on my waiver, except as provided for in § 42-2-411, MCA. 

5. 

I know that, upon the child’s adoption, all of my parental rights and

obligations to the child will be ended, except for any child support that is 

past due, unless waived.

6. 
7. 

I have not been offered money to complete this waiver. 
I waive my right to notice of any court action dealing with the child.  This 

waiver includes any hearing ending my parent/child relationship with the 

child and awarding custody to the stepparent and the other parent.  Any 

adoption of the child may be heard at any time without giving me notice. 

8. 

I have been given a copy of this document. 

9. 

I have been given a copy of the adoptive parent’s agreement to accept 

temporary custody of the child and to provide support and care for the 

child until the adoption is either granted or denied.

I want my spouse to adopt my child.  My consent to the adoption is 

voluntary and unequivocal.  In other words, I am completely sure that I

5.   

I understand and agree that the adoption will not end my parent-child 

relationship with the child. 

6. 

I understand and agree that the adoption will end the parent-child 

relationship between the other parent and the child.  I understand that the 

adoption will end any existing court orders for custody, visitation, or 

communication by the other parent and the child.

I understand and agree that even after the adoption, the child will still have 

rights to inherit from the other parent. The child’s descendants (children, 

grandchildren, etc.) will still have rights to inherit from the other parent.

8. 

I understand and agree that this stepparent adoption will not affect court 

orders for visits or communication with the child by the other parent’s 

family or other people.  However, failing to comply with those orders does 

not affect this consent or the adoption.
