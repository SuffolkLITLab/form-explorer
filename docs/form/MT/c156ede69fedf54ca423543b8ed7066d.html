Who Can Use the Form? 

You can use these forms if: 

•  Facts have changed since the parenting plan was entered; or 

•  Facts were not known to the court when the parenting plan was entered; 

•  The change in the parenting plan is needed to serve the best interests of 

the child(ren). (Mont. Code Ann. § 40-4-219(1)).  

Note:  If your child is in immediate danger, you may be able 
to get a change to your parenting plan faster than this 
process allows.  You can not request an emergency change 
using these forms.  Talk to a lawyer if you have an 
emergency or have any questions.   

hat if the Other Parent Does Not Live in Montana? 

If you know where the other parent lives, you will need to contact the sheriff in 

the county where the other parent lives and ask how much they charge to serve 

documents on someone.  Some states will waive the fee if you have an Order of 

Inability to Pay, but some may not.  You should mail the documents to be served 

on the other parent to the sheriff of the county where the other parent lives, along 

with the fee or your Order of Inability to Pay.  Once the other parent is served, 

the sheriff will return your Proof of Service. 

f you are not sure where the other parent lives, you may be able to serve him or 

her by publication.  You will need to fill out an Affidavit for Publication of 

Summons and fill in the caption on an Order for Publication of Summons and a 

Summons for Publication.  These forms are available online separately.  You 

should file these forms with the Clerk of District Court in the county where your 

original parenting action was filed.

affect his or her ability to defend the country.  This does not mean you cannot

Change in Circumstances 

Circumstances have changes since the Court entered our prior parenting 

plan.   I explain the changes in my Supporting Affidavit, which I am filing 

with this Motion. 

 

Legal Basis 

1 

Jurisdiction 

a. 

Montana law says the court may change a prior parenting plan if: 

•  Facts have changed since the parenting plan was entered; or 

•  Facts were not known to the court when the parenting plan was 

entered; and 

•  The change in the parenting plan is needed to serve the best 

interests of the child(ren). (Mont. Code Ann. § 40-4-219(1). )).  

•  The circumstances of the child(ren) have changed.  These changes 

are outlined in my Supporting Affidavit. 

b. 

Choose Any That Apply (Optional): 

  Montana law says that it is not in the child(ren)’s best 

interest when one parent does not allow the other parent to 

see the child(ren) or tries to keep the other parent from 

seeing the child(ren). Mont. Code Ann. ' 40-4-219(3)  

This Court ordered a final parenting plan in this action.  This Court has 

exclusive and continuing jurisdiction under Mont. Code Ann. ' 40-7-202. 

Amendment of Parenting Plan 

 

  2

 

 

  Montana law says that a parenting plan can be changed if  

one of the parents has died.  Mont. Code Ann. '' 40-4-
219(6) and 40-4-221.

of a child, endangering the welfare of children, partner or 

family member assault, or sexual abuse of children.  Mont. 

Code Ann ' 40-4-219(3) and (8)   

c. 

My Proposed Amended Parenting Plan is necessary to serve the 

best interests of our minor child(ren).  

 respectfully ask this Court to: 

1. 

Change our final parenting plan and adopt my Proposed Amended 

Parenting Plan, filed with this motion;

Both parties must provide insurance, if both parents have insurance plans 

that are at a combined reasonable cost and whose benefits are 

complementary or compatible with each other. 

e.  

If the primary parent has obtained individual insurance or a health benefits 

plan for the child, both parents may agree in writing to share the costs of 

maintaining the coverage. 

f. 

If circumstances change and a party believes that changes in cost are not 

reasonable or cost-beneficial, the party may ask the court to change the 

medical support order.
