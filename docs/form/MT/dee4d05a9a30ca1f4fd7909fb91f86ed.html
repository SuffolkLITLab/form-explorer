Case 4:14-cv-00040-BMM   Document 44   Filed 11/19/14   Page 2 of 18

BACKGROUND 

Montana voters amended the Montana Constitution in 2004 to ban same-sex 

marriage. The Montana Constitution provides that “[o]nly a marriage between one 

man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in this state.” Mont. 

Const. Art. XIII, § 7. Montana statutory law also prohibits same-sex marriage. 

Montana Code Annotated section 40-1-401(1)(d) prohibits “marriage between 

persons of the same sex.” Similarly, Montana Code Annotated section 40-1-103 

defines marriage as “a personal relationship between a man and a woman arising 

out of a civil contract to which the consent of the parties is essential.” 

Previous litigation in the courts of the State of Montana has highlighted the 

multitude of benefits and responsibilities that arise from a valid civil marriage 

contract. See Donaldson v. Montana, 292 P.3d 364 (Mont. 2012). These benefits 

include tax preferences that reflect society’s desire for the families of married 

couples to succeed financially. See, e.g., Mont. Code Ann. § 19-17-405 

(survivorship benefits for surviving spouses); Mont. Code Ann. § 33-20-1402 

(spouse qualifies as dependent under life insurance); Mont. Code Ann. § 39-51-

2205 (surviving spouse eligible to receive payments of accrued unemployment 

insurance benefits); Mont. Code Ann. § 39-71-723 (surviving spouse eligible to 

receive payment of workers’ compensation benefits); Mont. Code Ann. § 72-2-112 

(providing first priority to surviving spouse under intestate secession); and Mont. 

 

2 

Case 4:14-cv-00040-BMM   Document 44   Filed 11/19/14   Page 3 of 18

Code Ann. § 15-30-2114 (providing exemption for taxpayer’s spouse under state 

tax code). These responsibilities reflect society’s recognition that married couples 

stand in the best position to make life and death decisions regarding the well-being 

of their family. See, e.g., Mont. Code Ann. § 2-18-601 (allowing leave time for 

state employees to care for sick spouses); Mont. Code Ann. § 50-9-106 

(authorizing spouse to consent to, or withhold consent of, medical treatment); and 

Mont. Code Ann. § 15-30-2366 (providing tax credit for qualified elderly care 

expenses for care of taxpayer’s spouse).  

Plaintiffs Angela Rolando and Tonya Rolando, a same-sex couple, live in 

Great Falls, Montana. (Doc. 1 at 6). The couple attempted to obtain a marriage 

license at the Cascade County Clerk of Court’s office on May 19, 2014. The 

Cascade County Clerk of Court’s office denied the Rolandos a marriage license 

because Montana law prohibits the marriage of same-sex couples. (Doc. 36 at 1).  

Plaintiffs Chase Weinhandl and Benjamin Milano, Susan Hawthorne and 

Adel Johnson, and Shauna Goubeaux and Nicole Goubeaux are same-sex couples 

who reside in Montana. Each couple, while living in Montana, traveled outside 

Montana to marry. The couples legally married under the laws of Hawaii, 

Washington, and Iowa, respectively. (Doc. 36 at 1-2). The State of Montana 

refuses to recognize these marriages of same-sex partners.  

 

3 

Case 4:14-cv-00040-BMM   Document 44   Filed 11/19/14   Page 4 of 18

Plaintiffs initially asked the Court to declare that Montana laws that prohibit 

same-sex marriage violate Plaintiffs’ right to equal protection of the laws enshrined 

in the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs alleged that the Montana laws violated 

their right to equal protection by discriminating against them on the basis of both 

sexual orientation and on the basis of gender. Plaintiffs further requested that this 

Court declare that Montana laws that ban same-sex marriage violate Plaintiffs’ 

fundamental right to marry. After Plaintiffs filed their complaint, the Ninth Circuit 

determined that laws that banned same-sex marriage in Idaho and Nevada violated 

the constitutional right of same-sex couples to equal protection of the laws. Latta v. 

Otter, ___ F.3d ____, 2014 WL 4977682 (9th Cir. 2014).  

Plaintiffs now have filed a motion for summary judgment on their equal 

protection claim. (Doc. 35). Plaintiffs argue that the State of Montana has 

discriminated against them on the basis of sexual orientation. The Court would not 

need to reach Plaintiffs’ fundamental right to marry claim, or decide whether 

Montana has discriminated against Plaintiffs on the basis of gender, if it determines 

that Montana laws that ban same-sex marriage violate Plaintiffs’ right to equal 

protection of the laws.  

STANDARD OF REVIEW 

A party is entitled to summary judgment when “there is no genuine dispute 

as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” 

4 

 

 

Case 4:14-cv-00040-BMM   Document 44   Filed 11/19/14   Page 5 of 18

Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Material facts could affect the outcome of a case. Factual 

disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary to the outcome of the case will not be 

counted. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). 

 

The Court first must assess whether it possesses jurisdiction to hear 

ANALYSIS 

Plantiffs’ challenges. 

A. Baker v. Nelson 

Defendants argue that Baker v. Nelson, 409 U.S. 810 (1972), a 1972 

Supreme Court decision, precludes this Court from considering Plaintiffs’ claims. 

The Minnesota Supreme Court earlier had rejected due process and equal 

protection challenges to a state law that prohibited same-sex marriage. Baker v. 

Nelson, 191 N.W.2d 185 (Minn. 1971). The plaintiffs sought review from the 

United States Supreme Court. The Court summarily dismissed the petition “for 

want of a substantial federal question.” Baker, 409 U.S. at 810. 

A federal court lacks jurisdiction to hear a claim that fails to present a 

substantial federal question. Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U.S. 332, 343-44 (1975). The 

Supreme Court typically remains the final arbiter of whether a claim presents a 

substantial federal question. New doctrinal developments must occur to indicate 

that the question has become substantial in order to revive the issue. Hicks, 422 

U.S. at 344.  

 

5 

Case 4:14-cv-00040-BMM   Document 44   Filed 11/19/14   Page 6 of 18

Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ complaint presents the same issue 

rejected in Baker: whether a constitutional right to same-sex marriage exists. The 

Court agrees. Defendants further argue that no sufficient doctrinal developments 

have occurred to render this issue a substantial federal question. The Court 

disagrees. 

The Ninth Circuit directly considered this issue in Latta. Latta, *2. The court 

reviewed United States v. Windsor, ___ U.S. ___, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013), in which 

the Supreme Court addressed a challenge to the federal Defense of Marriage Act 

(DOMA). DOMA recognized opposite-sex marriages under federal law, but not 

same-sex marriages. This distinction violated the Fifth Amendment. Windsor 

explained that DOMA’s “principal purpose and . . . necessary effect” served “to 

demean” legally married same-sex couples. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2695. “[N]o 

legitimate purpose” behind DOMA could overcome such an injury to same-sex 

couples. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2696.  

The court in Latta also reviewed Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 578-79 

(2003), where the Supreme Court recognized a due process right to engage in 

intimate conduct with a same-sex partner. The court finally considered Romer v. 

Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 631-34 (1996), where the Supreme Court determined that a 

law that barred enactment of any statute or ordinance that would protect the civil 

rights of gays and lesbians violated equal protection.  

 

6 

Case 4:14-cv-00040-BMM   Document 44   Filed 11/19/14   Page 7 of 18

The court concluded that these recent decisions of the Supreme Court had 

produced sufficient doctrinal developments to determine that same-sex marriage 

now presents a substantial federal question. Latta, *3. Federal district courts in 

Arizona and Alaska permanently enjoined enforcement of same-sex marriage bans 

in those states after Latta. See Connolly v. Jeanes, 2014 WL 5320642 (D. Ariz. 

2014), and Hamby v. Parnell, 2014 WL 5089399 (D. Alaska 2014). These 

decisions comport with the outcome of litigation of same-sex marriage bans in 

other federal courts in states in the Ninth Circuit. See Perry v. Brown, 725 F.3d 

968, 970 (9th Cir. 2013) (dissolving stay of order that had enjoined California’s 

marriage ban); Geiger v. Kitzhaber, 994 F. Supp. 2d 1128, 1147-48 (D. Or. 2014) 

(overturning Oregon’s marriage ban). The legislatures in Hawaii and Washington 

passed laws to permit same-sex marriage. See Haw. Rev. Stat. § 572-1 and Wash. 

Rev. Code § 26.04.010(1). Montana now stands as the lone state in the Ninth 

Circuit to prohibit the marriage of same-sex couples and to prohibit the recognition 

of same-sex marriages that validly have taken place in other jurisdictions. 

Defendants argue that Latta misinterprets these Supreme Court cases and 

arrives at the erroneous conclusion that Baker no longer serves as binding 

precedent. This Court has reviewed the analysis in Latta and agrees that Baker no 

longer precludes consideration of challenges to the constitutionality of laws that 

prohibit same-sex marriage. Nevertheless, even if the Court disagreed with the 

 

7 

Case 4:14-cv-00040-BMM   Document 44   Filed 11/19/14   Page 8 of 18

analysis in Latta, that analysis represents “binding authority” that “must be 

followed unless and until overruled.” Hart v. Massanari, 266 F.3d 1155, 1170 (9th 

Cir. 2001). The Court thus must consider Plaintiffs’ equal protection challenge to 

the Montana laws that prohibit same-sex marriage. 

B. Constitutional Right to Equal Protection of the Laws 

Plaintiffs contend that Montana laws and the Montana Constitution violate 

their right to equal protection of the laws by prohibiting same-sex marriage. The 

Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State shall 

“deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. 

Const. amend. XIV, § 1.  

The Supreme Court has developed tiers of judicial scrutiny to evaluate 

whether a law violates an individual’s right to equal protection of the laws. The 

first step involves a determination as to what classification the law makes. Clark v. 

Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461 (1988). The classification made in the law indicates what 

level of scrutiny the Court should apply when evaluating the law. Jeter, 486 U.S. at 

461.  

1. Form of Classification 

Plaintiffs argue that Montana’s laws that ban same-sex marriage 

discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. Defendants contend that these 

 

 

8 

Case 4:14-cv-00040-BMM   Document 44   Filed 11/19/14   Page 9 of 18

facially neutral laws apply with equal force to all persons. Defendants concede that 

the laws may have a disparate impact as applied to gays and lesbians.  

 

Montana’s laws that ban same-sex marriage distinguish on their face 

between opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples. Montana law permits 

opposite-sex couples to marry. Montana law similarly recognizes the out-of-state 

marriages of opposite-sex couples. Montana law bans same-sex couples from 

marrying. Montana law further prohibits the recognition of out-of-state marriages 

by same-sex couples.  

The Ninth Circuit in Latta analyzed laws in Idaho and Nevada that imposed 

nearly identical prohibitions on same-sex marriages as the laws in Montana. Latta 

determined that these Idaho and Nevada laws discriminate on the basis of sexual 

orientation. Latta, *3. Montana’s laws that ban same-sex marriage likewise 

discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.  

2. Level of Scrutiny 

The Ninth Circuit applied heightened scrutiny in Latta to classifications 

based on sexual orientation. Latta, *4. Defendants contend that Latta misapplied 

Ninth Circuit precedent. Defendants filed a notice of supplemental authority in 

which they cited to the Sixth Circuit’s recent decision in DeBoer v. Snyder, 2014 

WL 5748990 (6th Cir. 2014). The court in DeBoer applied rational basis scrutiny 

in rejecting a challenge to bans on same-sex marriage in four states. Latta 

 

9 

Case 4:14-cv-00040-BMM   Document 44   Filed 11/19/14   Page 10 of 18

represents binding Ninth Circuit precedent and provides the framework that this 

Court must follow. Hasbrouck v. Texaco, Inc., 663 F.2d 930, 933 (9th Cir. 1981). 

The Ninth Circuit previously had determined that rational basis review 

should apply to classifications based on sexual orientation. High Tech Gays v. Def. 

Indus. Sec. Clearance Office, 895 F.2d 563, 574 (9th Cir. 1990). There a class of 

plaintiffs challenged the Department of Defense’s policy of “refusing to grant 

security clearances to known or suspected gay applicants.” High Tech Gays, 895 

F.2d at 565. The court acknowledged that gays and lesbians had suffered a history 

of discrimination. The court nevertheless determined that gays and lesbians failed 

to meet the definition of a suspect class that would warrant application of 

heightened scrutiny. High Tech Gays, 895 F.2d at 573. 

The Ninth Circuit recently revisited this issue in SmithKline Beecham Corp. 

v. Abbott Labs., 740 F.3d 471, 480-84 (9th Cir. 2014). The court acknowledged 

that the Supreme Court in Windsor had failed to articulate the precise level of 

scrutiny that should apply to classifications based on sexual orientation. 

SmithKline, 740 F.3d at 480. The court determined that the Supreme Court, in fact, 

had applied heightened scrutiny in analyzing DOMA. SmithKline, 740 F.3d at 483. 

The court reasoned that Windsor now required it “to apply heightened scrutiny to 

classifications based on sexual orientation for purposes of equal protection.” 

SmithKline, 740 F.3d at 484.  

 

10 

Case 4:14-cv-00040-BMM   Document 44   Filed 11/19/14   Page 11 of 18

The court in Geiger hesitated to apply the heightened scrutiny standard 

demanded in SmithKline in evaluating Oregon’s ban on same-sex marriage. The 

court noted that the panel’s decision in SmithKline was “not yet a truly final and 

binding decision” based upon the fact that the mandate had not issued. Geiger, 994 

F. Supp. 2d at 1141. The court nonetheless proceeded to strike down Oregon’s 

same-sex marriage ban under rational basis review. Geiger, 994 F. Supp. 2d at 

1147-48. The Court faces no similar quandary here as the mandate has issued in 

SmithKline. See SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Labs., 759 F.3d 990 (9th Cir. 

2014) (denying rehearing en banc). 

Defendants suggest that the Ninth Circuit misinterpreted Windsor in 

SmithKline. Defendants argue that the rational basis review required under High 

Tech Gays represents the appropriate level of scrutiny. Defendants maintain that 

Latta should have applied rational basis review pursuant to High Tech Gays rather 

than heightened scrutiny required under SmithKline. The decision in Latta to apply 

heightened scrutiny to classifications based on sexual orientation, as developed in 

SmithKline, represents binding precedent. Hart, 266 F.3d at 1170. This Court must 

evaluate Montana’s ban on same-sex marriage using the heightened scrutiny 

analysis.  

 

The discriminatory means employed by a law must relate substantially to the 

achievement of important governmental objectives in order to survive heightened 

11 

Case 4:14-cv-00040-BMM   Document 44   Filed 11/19/14   Page 12 of 18

scrutiny. United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996). This Court must 

examine the actual purpose of the law. SmithKline, 740 F.3d at 483. The Court also 

must consider carefully any inequality that may result from the law. SmithKline, 

740 F.3d at 483. 

3. Asserted Justifications  

 

Defendants argue that the laws that ban same-sex marriage in Montana 

should survive rational basis review. As discussed above, however, heightened 

scrutiny represents the appropriate level of review for classifications based on 

sexual orientation. Latta, *4. Defendants fail to put forth any persuasive argument 

that the discriminatory means employed by these laws relate substantially to the 

achievement of any important governmental objectives.  

Latta considered several arguments in support of the bans on same-sex 

marriage in Idaho and Nevada. The defendants in Latta argued that the laws help 

ensure that parents of different genders raise children. The court reasoned that the 

defendants really argued that same-sex couples do not make suitable parents. Latta, 

*8. The court noted that both Nevada and Idaho already allowed adoption by gays 

and lesbians. Latta, *8. The court determined that to allow same-sex couples to 

adopt children and then to “label their families as second-class” is “cruel as well as 

unconstitutional.” Latta, *9.  

 

12 

Case 4:14-cv-00040-BMM   Document 44   Filed 11/19/14   Page 13 of 18

In a concurring opinion, Judge Berzon considered the defendants’ argument 

that parents of different genders should raise children. Judge Berzon dismissed this 

justification as being laden with the “baggage of sexual stereotypes” that the 

Supreme Court repeatedly has rejected. Latta, *24 (Berzon, J, concurring).  Judge 

Berzon noted that the Supreme Court has struck down laws that make 

generalizations about “the way women are” or “the way men are” as justifications 

for the legislation. Latta, *24 (Berzon, J, concurring).   

The defendants also argued that permitting same-sex marriage will 

encourage opposite-sex couples to opt-out of marriage. The defendants argued that 

a father who sees a child being raised by two women will decide that it is 

unnecessary for his children to have a father. The court disparaged this proposition 

as a “crass and callous view of parental love.” Latta, *5.  

An expert presented data from Massachusetts, where same-sex marriage has 

been permitted since 2004. No decrease in marriage rates or increase in divorce 

rates have occurred in the past decade. Latta, *5. This outcome follows the 

conclusion of other courts that “permitting same sex couples to marry will not 

affect the number of opposite-sex couples who marry, divorce, cohabit, have 

children outside of marriage or otherwise affect the stability of opposite-sex 

marriages.” Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 704 F. Supp. 2d 921, 972 (N.D. Cal. 2010). 

 

13 

Case 4:14-cv-00040-BMM   Document 44   Filed 11/19/14   Page 14 of 18

The defendants in Latta next argued that the bans on same-sex marriage 

further the stability of family structures by targeting benefits at couples who 

possess biological procreative capacity. The court noted that “to say that marriage 

is simply about the capacity to procreate” demeans married couples, especially 

those who are childless. Latta, *7. The laws banning same-sex marriage also are 

“grossly over- and under-inclusive” of the purported goal of targeting benefits at 

families who may have children. Latta, *7. Opposite sex couples who lack 

reproductive capacity, or choose not to have children, are allowed to marry, but 

same-sex couples who already have children are not allowed to marry. Latta, *7.  

The court concluded that laws that prevent same-sex couples with children 

from marrying “materially harm and demean same-sex couples and their children.” 

Latta, *8 (emphasis added). As the Court recognized in Windsor, prohibiting same-

sex couples from joining in marriage “humiliates” children being raised by same-

sex couples and makes it even more difficult for those children “to understand the 

integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in 

their community and in their daily lives.” Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2694.  

Latta considered several other purported justifications for banning same-sex 

marriage. The court summarily rejected these justifications as being 

“unpersuasive.” Latta, *9.  Defendants have put forth no persuasive arguments that 

the laws that ban same-sex marriage in Montana relate substantially to the 

 

14 

Case 4:14-cv-00040-BMM   Document 44   Filed 11/19/14   Page 15 of 18

achievement of an important governmental objective. Defendants have failed to 

meet their burden under heightened scrutiny to justify the discrimination 

engendered by the Montana laws that ban same-sex marriage. 

Plaintiffs who challenge these Montana laws that ban same-sex marriage 

come from diverse points across Montana. They hale from communities large and 

small – Butte, Great Falls, Helena, Bozeman, Billings, Charlo, and Philipsburg. 

Plaintiffs come from families that have lived in Montana for generations and from 

recently arrived families. They represent different walks of life that range from 

public employees, to military veterans, to retail managers, to marketers, to health 

care workers. They spend their free time engaged in activities that thousands of 

Montana families enjoy. These couples recreate in the beautiful outdoors that 

Montana offers. They cheer for their favorite teams at local sporting events. They 

practice their faiths freely as guaranteed by our Constitution. 

And like many families in Montana, some of these same-sex couples raise 

children. Some of these children come to the families from previous relationships 

with opposite-sex partners. Others arrive to the families through the gift of 

adoption. Montana law allows, however, only one person from a same-sex couple 

to serve as the adoptive parent. See Mont. Code Ann. § 42-1-106; Kulstad v. 

Maniaci, 220 P.3d 595 (Mont. 2009). The available social science indicates that 

the children raised by these same-sex couples will “fare just as well as their peers

physically, psychologically, emotionally, cognitively, and socially.” Kulstad, 220 

P.3d at 601; see also Perry, 704 F. Supp. 2d at 980-81 and DeBoer v. Snyder, 973 

F. Supp. 2d 757 (E.D. Mich. 2014), rev’d on other grounds, 2014 WL 5748990 

(6th Cir. 2014) (recognizing that the overwhelming scientific consensus 

demonstrates “no differences” in outcomes for children raised in opposite-sex 

households and children raised in same-sex households).  

These families want for their children what all families in Montana want. 

They want to provide a safe and loving home in which their children have the 

chance to explore the world in which they live. They want their children to have 

the chance to discover their place in this world. And they want their children to 

have the chance to fulfill their highest dreams. These families, like all of us, want 

their children to adventure into the world without fear of violence; to achieve all 

that their talent and perseverance allows without fear of discrimination; and to love 

themselves so that they can love others. No family wants to deprive its precious 

children of the chance to marry the loves of their lives. Montana no longer can 

deprive Plaintiffs and other same-sex couples of the chance to marry their loves. 

This Court recognizes that not everyone will celebrate this outcome. This 

decision overturns a Montana Constitutional amendment approved by the voters of 

Montana. Yet the United States Constitution exists to protect disfavored minorities 

from the will of the majority. Equal protection of the laws will not be achieved

through “indiscriminate imposition of inequalities.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 633. Our 

constitutional tradition does not permit laws to single out a certain class of citizens 

for “disfavored legal status.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 633. 

Montana’s laws that ban same-sex marriage impose a “disfavored legal 

status” on same-sex couples. The time has come for Montana to follow all the 

other states within the Ninth Circuit and recognize that laws that ban same-sex 

marriage violate the constitutional right of same-sex couples to equal protection of 

the laws. Today Montana becomes the thirty-fourth state to permit same-sex 

marriage. 

ORDER 

The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. 35).  

The Court hereby DECLARES that Montana’s laws that ban same-sex 

marriage, including Article XIII, section 7 of the Montana Constitution, and 

Montana Code Annotated section 40-1-103 and section 40-1-401, violate 

Plaintiffs’ rights to equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the Equal 

Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. 

The Court PERMANENTLY ENJOINS the State of Montana and its 

officers, employees, agents, and political subdivisions from enforcing Article XIII, 

section 7 of the Montana Constitution, Montana Code Annotated section 40-1-103 

and section 40-1-401, and any other laws or regulations, to the extent that they 

 

17 

Case 4:14-cv-00040-BMM   Document 44   Filed 11/19/14   Page 18 of 18

prohibit otherwise qualified same-sex couples from marrying in Montana, and to 

the extent that they do not recognize same-sex marriages validly contracted outside 

Montana. This injunction shall take effect immediately. 

DATED this 19th day of November, 2014.
