The Supreme Court 
of 
Montana 

This booklet is designed to assist individuals who are unable to obtain 

the assistance of an attorney to navigate through the appellate process.  These 
materials provide the minimum amount of information you need to pursue a 
case in the Montana Supreme Court. 

Neither this handbook nor the attached forms are intended to provide 

legal advice.  Nor are they a proper substitute for having an attorney advise 
you or represent your interests before the Court. 

Appellate practice is complicated and failure to follow proper appellate 

procedure can result in your case being dismissed.  We recommend you 
consult an attorney if at all possible. 

The Court understands that sometimes an attorney is not available to 
provide you with all of the assistance you need.  In those situations, we hope 
you will find this handbook useful. 

Good luck with your appeal. 

Mike McGrath 
Chief Justice 

P.S.  Pay close attention to the filing deadlines listed on page 33.  Failure to file 
the proper papers on time is the most common reason for an appeal to be 
dismissed.

 list of legal terms appears on pages 19-27 
of  this  Handbook.      This  list,  or  Glossary, 
defines  many  of  the  legal  terms  that  are 
used  by  parties  and  by  the  courts.      For 
example,  the  Glossary  defines  the  terms 
Appellant  and  Appellee.  The  Appellant  is 
the  person  appealing  the  district  court’s 
decision   because   he   or   she   lost   in   the 
district  court.    The  Appellant  is  asking  the 
Supreme  Court  to  reverse  or  change  the 
district court’s decision.  The Appellee is the 
person  who  won  in  the  district  court.   The 
Appellee  will  argue  that  the  district  court 
got  it  right  and  the  Supreme  Court  should 
affirm,   meaning   agree   with   the   district 
court.   When  you  don’t  understand  a  word 
used  in  the  Rules,  this  Handbook,  or  your 
research,  you  should  first  refer  to  the 
Glossary.

The  Montana  Supreme  Court  is  the  highest 
court  in  Montana  and  is  the  final  court  of 
appeals.   The  purpose  of  a  court of  appeals 
is  to  review  decisions  of  lower  courts  or 
administrative   agencies   to   determine   if 
those  decisions  were  legally  correct.   Seven 
judges,    called    justices,    serve    on    the 
Montana  Supreme  Court.   When  an  appeal 
is  filed  with  the  Court,  the  justices  review 
the briefs filed by the parties and then issue 
a ruling, called an opinion. 

When  the  Court  reviews  the  district  court’s 
decision, it does not hold a new trial or take 
new evidence.  It only looks at the record on 
appeal.      The  record  includes  the  original 
documents   and   exhibits   filed   with   the 
district  court,  the  orders 
issued  by  the 
district  court  judge,  and  the  transcripts  of 
any  hearings  or  trials  that  have  been 
prepared by a court reporter. 

The  Supreme  Court  has  written  rules 
in  an 
regarding  documents  to  be  filed 
appeal.   These rules are called the Montana 
Rules  of  Appellate  Procedure  (M.  R.  App. 
P.).      Anyone  filing  an  appeal,  petition  or 
motion with the Supreme Court must follow 
these rules.

opposed to a criminal appeal, from a district

4.  Pay  a  $100  filing  fee  to  the  Clerk  of 
the  Supreme  Court  at  the  time  you 
file your Notice of Appeal. 

a.     If  you  cannot  afford  to  pay 
the filing fee, you may ask the Court 
for  permission  to  appeal  without 
paying  the  fee.        (The  following 
section explains how to do this.) 

b.     If   you   file   the   Notice   of 
Appeal  by  fax,  you  must  either  pay 
the  filing  fee  or  file  a  motion  to 
proceed without paying the filing fee 
(the  following  section  explains  more 
about  this)  with  the  Clerk  of  the 
Supreme  Court  within  5  business 
days.      Otherwise,  the  Clerk  of  the 
Supreme  Court  will  not  file  your 
appeal. 

MPORTANT:  If  you  do  not  pay  the  filing 
fee  or  file  the  motion  to  proceed  without 
paying  the  filing  fee,  the  Clerk  of  the 
Supreme Court will not file your appeal. 
 

5.  Serve    a    copy    of    the    Notice   of 
Appeal,  Form  4(2),  and  the  original 
transcript request, Form  8(3), on  the 
clerk of the district court.  Also serve 
a  copy  of  each  on:  (1)  the  other 
parties    in    the    case,    or    their 
attorneys,  and    (2)    the    court 
reporter.   For  more  information, see 
SERVING  DOCUMENTS  and  RECORD 
AND TRANSCRIPTS on page 6. 

6.    Some  cases  require  mediation.   See 
pages  8-10  for  more  information. 
Also  now  is  the  time  to  decide  if 
you’re  going  to  ask  for  a  stay  of 
execution  of  your  judgment.      See 
page 6 for more information.

STARTING AN APPEAL 

What can be appealed? [Rules 4 and 6] 
Most appeals are from a district court’s final 
judgment.   That is the written order issued 
at the end of a case that settles all claims of 
both parties. It’s also called an order or final 
order.   It  may  be  the  verdict of  a  jury  or  a 
ruling made by the trial judge. 

Also, people may appeal from an order that 
is issued after the final judgment.  These are 
called postjudgment orders. 

Often  the  district  court  makes  many  rulings 
before  the  case  is  over.    These  rulings  are 
called  prejudgment  rulings.            Most 
prejudgment  orders  are  not  appealable  at 
the  time  they  are  issued  but  some  are. 
Review Rule 6 if in doubt. 

How do I file an appeal? [Rule 4] 
Once  the ruling  you  are appealing has  been 
issued,   you   must   do   the   following   five 
things: 

1.  Complete a Notice of Appeal.   Form 
4(2)  is  included  in  this  Handbook. 
(Form numbers match the applicable 
Rule.) 

2.  Complete  a  request  for  transcripts. 
Form    8(3)    is    included    in    this 
Handbook. 

IMPORTANT: The following steps 3 – 5 
must be done on the same day. 

3.  File   the   original   Notice   of   Appeal 
and  a  copy  of  the  request  for 
transcripts  with    the    Clerk    of 
Supreme  Court.    Address  of  Clerk’s 
office can be found on page 5.

fee. 
proceed  without  paying  the  filing 
However, you must pay all other costs, such 
as the costs of transcripts. 

f  the  Court  denies  your  motion,  you  will 
receive  an  order  telling  you  that  you  must 
pay the fee by a certain date.   If you do not 
pay the fee by the date stated in the order, 
the  Clerk  of  the  Supreme  Court  will  not  file 
your appeal. 

hen do I file a Notice of Appeal? [Rule 4] 
The  answer  to  this  question  depends  on 
who the other party to the case is and what 
kind of case it is. 

n most cases, you have 30 calendar days to 
file  your  Notice  of  Appeal  after  the  ruling 
you  are  appealing  was  filed  in  the  district 
court.  However, 
if  any  government  or 
government  agency  or  employee  is  a  party, 
including  the  United  States,  the  State  of 
Montana,  a  city  or  a  county  and  any 
governmental  officer  or  agency,  you  must 
file    your    Notice    of    Appeal    within    60 
calendar  days.      If  your  appeal  involves  a 
“youth    in    need    of    care,”    and    the 
government is the other party, you must file 
your  Notice  of  Appeal  within  30  calendar 
days. For information on counting the 30 or 
60 days, see the following section. 

ow do I count the days? [Rule 3] 

It is very important that you file all required 
documents,  not  just  the  Notice  of  Appeal, 
with  the  Clerk  of  the  Supreme  Court  on 
time.       If    you   do    not    file    a    required 
document    on    time,    the    Clerk    of    the 
Supreme  Court  can  refuse  to  file  the 
document  and  the  Court  may  deny  or 
dismiss your appeal.

IMPORTANT: Be sure to keep a copy of the 
Notice  of  Appeal  and  all  other  documents 
that  you  file  during  your  appeal  for  your 
own records. 

I can’t afford to pay the filing fee.   How do 
I  ask  the  Court  for  permission  to  appeal 
without paying the fee? [Rule 5] 
If  you  cannot  afford  to  pay  the  $100  filing 
fee  when  you  file  your  Notice  of  Appeal, 
you may file a “motion” asking the Court to 
allow   you   to   appeal   your   case   without 
paying  the fee.  Form 5(a)  is  included  in  this 
Handbook. 

Form   5(a)   is   a   combined   Motion   and 
Affidavit  in  Support  of  Motion  to  Proceed 
on  Appeal  without  Paying  the  Filing  Fee. 
Use  this  form  to  explain  your  financial 
circumstances  to  the  Court  and  prove  that 
you  cannot  afford  to  pay  the fee.  You  must 
swear  that  everything  in  the  motion  is  true 
and  you  must  sign  the  motion  in  front  of  a 
notary  public.   (A  notary  public  is  a  special 
official    who    is    allowed    to    witness    a 
signature  and  testify  that  it  is  authentic. 
Banks,  insurance  companies  and  State  and 
federal  government  offices  usually  have  a 
notary public who can notarize the form for 
you.) 

File your notarized Form 5(a) with the Clerk 
of the Supreme Court at the same time you 
file  your  Notice  of  Appeal.  If  you  are  an 
inmate  filing  a  civil  appeal,  file  Form  5(a)I 
which   does   not   need   to   be   notarized. 
Unlike  most  other  motions  (discussed  later 
in  this  Handbook),  you  need  to  file  your 
original  motion  but  you  do  not  need  to  file 
copies 
supporting 
your  motion, 
documents, a proposed order or envelopes.

If  the  Court  grants  your  motion,  you  will 
receive  an  order  telling  you  that  you  may

you  to  lose  your  right  to  appeal,  you  must

o  ask  the  Court’s  permission, 
file  a 
document  called  a  “Petition  for  An  Out-of- 
Time  Appeal,”  also  called  a  “Petition  for 
Late Appeal.” Form 4(6) of  this  Handbook  is 
a   sample   Petition   to   help   you.      In   the 
petition  explain  why  you  did  not  file  your 
appeal  on  time  and  why  you  should  be 
allowed  to  file  a  late  appeal.    Explain  how 
you  will  be  harmed  if  the  Court  doesn’t  let 
you file your appeal. 

he  Court  does  not  usually  allow 
late 
appeals.    And  it  will  not  let  you  file  a  late 
appeal  if  you  simply  forgot  to  file  on  time, 
you  were  unsure  whether  you  needed  to 
file a Notice, or you didn’t know how to file 
an appeal. 

ttach  any  records,  partial  transcripts  and 
other  evidence  that  proves  that  what  you

know how to count the days.   The following 
example may help: 

If  you  want  to  appeal  a  judgment  or  order 
that was filed in the district court record on 
March 1 and you are allowed 30 days to file 
your  appeal,  begin  counting  the  days  on 
March 2.  March 31 would then be the 30th 
day  and  the  day  on  which  the  Notice  of 
Appeal must be filed. 

for 

  all 

  documents. 

This  same  counting  method  is  used  for  all 
deadlines 
  Just 
remember,  do  not  count  the  day  that  your 
appealable  judgment  or  order  was  filed. 
Also,  don’t  count  the  day  the  brief  or 
document you are responding to was filed. 

If  the  day  your  document  is  due  falls  on  a 
weekend  or  a  legal  holiday,  you  must  file 
your  document  on  the  next  business  day. 
For  example,  if  your  filing  date  falls  on 
Thanksgiving,  you  must  file  by  close  of 
business  on  the  Friday  after  Thanksgiving. 
All filings must be made between 8 a.m. and 
5  p.m.     
If  you  are  going  to  mail  your 
document  to  the  Clerk,  allow  enough  time 
for  the  mail  to  deliver  it.   The  Clerk  of  the 
Supreme  Court  must  receive  the  document 
by 5 p.m. on the day it is due. 

If  you  think  you’re  running  out  of  time  and 
might not  be  able  to  file  your document on 
time, you may file a Motion for Extension of 
Time.      To  learn  how  to  do  this,  see  the 
Motion for Extension of Time section of this 
Handbook on page 16. 

What if I didn’t file my Notice of Appeal on 
time? [Rule 4(6)] 
If you did not file your Notice of Appeal on 
time,  the  Court  will  probably  not  consider 
your  appeal,  but  you  may  ask  the  Court  to 
let you file a late appeal.

on  the  same  day  you  file  or  send  the 
document   to   the   Clerk   of   the   Supreme 
Court. 

o   prove   that   you   served   a   document, 
attach  a  “Certificate  of  Service”  to  the 
document you’re filing.   This  certificate also 
may  be  called  a  Proof  of  Service,  Proof  of 
Mailing,  or  Certificate  of  Mailing.        A 
Certificate  of  Service  is  included  in  each 
form   provided   in   this   Handbook.     Form 
10(4)  is  an  example  of  a  Certificate  of 
Service.   The  certificate lists  the  names  and 
addresses  of  the  people  served.   If  you  are 
serving  a  party  who  has  an  attorney,  you 
must  serve  the  attorney,  NOT  the  party. 
The    Certificate    of    Service    also    states 
whether you mailed the document or hand- 
delivered  it  and  the  date  you  mailed  or 
delivered it. 

ou  will  use  this  Certificate  of  Service  on

hat  happens  after  I  file  my  Notice  of 

Appeal? [Rule 8 and 9] 
Several  things  happen  after  you  file  your 
Notice  of  Appeal.      First,  the  clerk  of  the 
district  court  begins  preparing  your  trial 
record.    This  record  is  made  up  of  all  the 
original   documents   and   exhibits   filed   in 
your  case  with  the  district  court.  In  other 
words,  all  documents  from  the  complaint

Does  filing  an  appeal  stop  the  district 
court’s 
judgment  from  being  enforced? 
[Rules 22 and 23] 
No.  To stop the judgment against you from 
being  enforced  while  you  appeal,  you  must 
file  one  of  the  following  with  the  district 
court: 

●  a  motion  for  a  stay  of  execution  of 
judgment     or     order     during 

the 
appeal; 

●  a  bond  for  enough  money  to  cover 
the  amount     of     the     judgment, 
interest and costs, or 

●  a motion for injunctive relief. 

The  order  of  the  district  court  granting  or 
denying  a  stay  of  execution  of  judgment 
must be filed promptly with the Clerk of the 
Supreme Court. 

If  the  district  court  grants  you  a  stay  of 
execution, the Court may require you to file 
a  bond  for  enough  money  to  cover  the 
judgment,  interest  and  costs  on  appeal.   A 
mere  promise  to  pay  if  you  lose  the  appeal 
is  not  enough.  The  rule  for  bonds  is  very 
technical. If you want to use this method to 
stay  your  judgment,  read  Rule  24  carefully 
and  make  sure  you 
file  all  necessary 
documents  on  time.  If  you  can’t  afford  a 
bond, you can file a motion asking the Court 
to allow you to appeal without a bond. 

SERVING DOCUMENTS 

What  does  “serve”  mean  and  how  do  I 
prove I served someone? [Rules 10 and 13] 
“Serving” a document means to give a copy 
of it, and any attachments to it, to the other 
parties.  You   may   either   mail   or   hand- 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  you  cannot  afford  the  whole  transcript, 
you  may  be  able  to  work  with  the  court 
reporter  to  get  a  partial  transcript.    If  you 
can’t  get  a  partial  transcript,  you  may  go 
forward  with  your  appeal,  but  know  that 
without  the  transcript  you  may  not  be  able 
to show that the trial court made a mistake. 

hat  if  the  court  reporter  can’t  get  the 

transcript prepared on time? [Rule 9(4)] 
At times, the court reporter may be so busy 
that  he  or  she  cannot  get  your  transcript 
prepared  and  sent  to  the  Court  within  40 
calendar  days.    If  this  happens,  the  court 
reporter  will  ask  the  district  court  for  an 
extension  of  time.      The  district  court  will 
probably  give 
reporter  an 
the  court 
to  complete  your 
additional  50  days 
transcript.   If the transcript is still not ready 
when the extension expires, you must file  a 
Motion  for  Extension  of  Time  to  Transmit 
the  Record  with  the  Clerk  of  the  Supreme 
Court.   The  court  reporter  must  prepare  an 
affidavit explaining why the transcript is late 
and when it will be ready.   You must attach 
this  affidavit  to  your  motion.      See  the 
MOTIONS section of this Handbook on page 
14  for  information  on  filing  motions  with 
the Supreme Court.

hat if there is no transcript? [Rule 8] 

Sometimes there  is  no  transcript  available. 
For  example,  if  the  judge  decides  the  case 
based    upon    documents    filed    with    the 
district court,  rather than  at a  hearing  or  a 
trial,  there  may  not  be  a  transcript.   If  this 
happens, review Rules 8(7) and 8(8) to see if 
you should use another method to get your 
statement of the evidence before the Court. 

hat  else  should  I  be  doing  while  the 
record and  transcripts are  being  prepared? 
You must decide whether:

judgment,  plus  any 
through 
postjudgment  rulings.      The  clerk  of  the 
district  court  also  keeps  a  list  of  all  the 
documents and the date they are filed.  This 
list  is  called  a  docket,  or  case  register.   On 
the  docket sheet, each  document  is  given  a 
number. 

While  the  clerk  of  the  district  court 
is 
preparing    the    trial    record,    the    court 
reporter  is  preparing  the  transcript  you 
requested. (See subparagraph 5 of How do I 
file  an  appeal?)      When  the  transcript  is 
ready, the court reporter may send it to the 
clerk  of  the  district  court  or  send  it  directly 
to the Supreme Court. 

The  trial  record,  the  docket,  and  the 
transcript  make  up the  record  on  appeal. 
The  record  on  appeal  must  be  sent  to  the 
Supreme  Court  within  40  calendar  days  of 
the  day  you  filed  your  Notice  of  Appeal. 
The  clerk  of  the  district  court  usually  sends 
the  record  automatically,  but  you  should 
check  to  make  sure.    Under  the  rules,  the 
Appellant is responsible for making sure the 
Supreme  Court  gets  the  record  and  any 
transcripts.  The Appellant is required to pay 
the  district  court’s 
fee.  The 
Appellant is not required to pay the costs of 
mailing the record to the Supreme Court but 
is  required  to  pay  the  mailing  costs  when 
the record is returned to the district court at 
the end of the appeal. [Rule 9] 

transfer 

Do   I   have   to   pay   for   the   transcripts   I 
request? [Rule 8] 
Yes,  you  must  either  pay  for  the  transcript 
at  the  time  you  order  it  or  make  payment 
arrangements  with 
the  court  reporter. 
Transcripts  can  be  expensive  and  generally 
cost about $1,000 for a full day of trial.  The 
Supreme  Court  will  not  order  a  court 
reporter  to  give  you  a  transcript  if  you 
cannot afford to pay for it.

Do I appeal and mediate at the same time? 
[Rule 7(3)(b)] 
Yes.    You  must  file  your  Notice  of  Appeal, 
request  transcripts,  and  meet  all  briefing 
deadlines 
in  your  appeal  while  you  go 
through  mediation.       Then,  if  you  don’t 
settle your case in mediation, the Court has 
everything it needs to decide your appeal. 

Know that your Opening Brief with the Clerk 
of  the  Supreme  Court  may  be  due  before 
mediation is complete. 

ow  does  the  mediation  process  begin? 

[Rule 7(4)] 
If your case must be mediated, you and the 
other party must choose a  mediator within 
15 calendar days  after the Notice of  Appeal 
is  filed. The  Clerk of the Supreme Court  can 
give  you  the  names  of  mediators  that  may 
be able to help you. 
 
If  you  and  the  other  party  agree  upon  a 
mediator,  you  must  notify  the  Clerk  of  the 
Supreme  Court,  in  writing  with  signatures 
from all parties. 

f you and  the other party cannot or do not 
agree   on   a   mediator   within   the   time 
allowed, the Clerk of the Supreme Court will 
appoint one. 

s the mediator paid? [Rule 7(4)] 
In  most  cases,  the  parties  must  share  the 
cost  of  the  mediator.        But  in  money 
damages  cases  where  less  than  $5,000  was 
awarded  to  a  party,  the  mediator  does  not 
get paid. 
 

What happens after a mediator is chosen? 
[Rule 7(5)] 
Within 15 calendar days after the mediator 
is  selected,  you  must  write  a  statement  of 
position and give it to the mediator and the 
other  party.     The  other  party  will  respond

●  your  case  involves  a  constitutional 
question  that  requires  a  special 
notice (see Rule 27), 

●  your case requires mediation, or 
●  you want to ask the district court to 
stay execution of your judgment. 

MEDIATION [Rule 7] 
The  Rules  require  that  parties  to  certain 
types of cases go through mediation as part 
of    the    appeals    process.    The    goal    of 
mediation is to see if the parties can resolve 
their  differences  before  the  Court  actually 
considers the issues on appeal. 

What is mediation? 
Mediation  is  a  process  where  the  parties 
meet  in  person  or  by  telephone  with  a 
“mediator” and try to settle their case. 

IMPORTANT: Mediation takes  place  at  the 
same time you are appealing your case. 

What is a mediator? 
A  mediator  is  someone  who  is  trained  to 
help  people  who  are  having  a  legal  dispute 
find  an  agreeable  solution.   A  mediator is  a 
neutral  third  party  who  does  not  represent 
either  side.      He  or  she  will  conduct  the 
meeting  with  the  parties  and  try  to  help 
them settle the case. 

What cases must be mediated? [Rule 7(2)] 
The  types  of  cases  that  must  go  through 
mediation are: 

●  workers’ compensation cases; 
●  cases where one of the parties asked 
for  money  damages  or  money 
damages  were  awarded  by 
the 
district court to one of the parties; 
●  cases involving certain family issues, 
such  as  divorce  and  child  custody. 
Child  abuse  and  neglect  cases, 
paternity disputes, and adoptions do 
not require mediation.

everyone together in person, he or she may

he  mediator  will  choose  how  to  conduct 
the  meeting  and  will  explain  the  process  to 
the parties.  The mediator will ask questions 
to  see  if  there  is  anything  in  the  case  the 
parties  agree  upon.   The  mediator  is  trying 
to  find  common  ground  that  may  let  the 
parties settle the case without the expense, 
time,  and  stress  of  preparing  briefs  and 
getting an opinion from the Supreme Court. 
The mediator is also trying to make sure the 
Court  doesn’t  waste  time  on  issues  not  in 
dispute.   Mediation may last one full day or 
more. 

fter  the  mediation  meeting,  the  mediator 
files  a  report with the Clerk of the Supreme 
Court  telling  the  Court  whether  the  case 
settled  or  not.      The  mediator  gives  the 
parties  a  copy  of  this  report.        If  the  case 
settled, the Court will dismiss the appeal 30 
calendar  days  after  settlement  unless  one 
of  the  parties  files  a  motion  to  keep  the 
case open.

What  is   a   statement  of   position?   [Rule 
7(5)] 
A  statement  of  position  tells  the  mediator 
what  issues  you  will  be asking  the  Supreme 
Court  to  rule  on  and  why  you  think  the 
Court  should  rule  in  your  favor.            Your 
statement  must  “cite  legal  authority.”   This 
means  that  you  must  find  cases  or  statutes 
that  support  your  argument  and  include 
these  citations  in  your  statement.   Refer  to 
“Citation  to  Authority”  in  the  Glossary  for 
an  example  of  how  to  cite  a  case  and  a 
statute. 

The  other  party’s  response  should  contain 
his  or  her  argument  why  the  Court  should 
rule in his or her favor. 

The  statement of  position  cannot  be  longer 
than  10  typewritten  pages  and  must  be 
double spaced. 

At  the  same  time  you  give  your  statement 
of  position  to  the  mediator  and  the  other 
party,  you  may  also  give  the  mediator  a 
separate  Confidential  Statement.          If  you 
choose  to  give  a  Confidential  Statement,  it 
cannot  be 
longer  than  5  double-spaced 
pages.  The  Confidential  Statement  would 
include  any  additional  information  that  you 
think could help settle the case.  You do not 
have to serve the Confidential Statement on 
the  other  party  and  the  mediator  will  not 
share this information with the other party. 

What  happens  after  the  mediator  gets  the 
statements? [Rule 7(5)] 
After      the      mediator      receives      both

notice to you. 

hat   is   the   purpose   of   an   Appellant’s 

Brief? 
Your   brief   is   your   chance   to   tell   the 
Supreme  Court  why  you  think  the  district 
court’s  decision  is  wrong.   You  need  to  tell 
the  Court  what  mistake  or  mistakes  the 
district    court    made.    You    should    be 
respectful to the opposing party, the district 
court and  the Supreme Court.   The focus of 
the brief should be on the law and the facts. 
You  need to  explain  how  the law  applies  to 
the  facts  of  your  case.  You  must  not  lie  or 
misrepresent  the  facts.            You  may  not 
include  new  facts  that  were  not  presented 
to the district court. 

he    Supreme  Court    will    not    do    legal 
research  for  you  or  try  to  guess  what  your 
argument is.   Also, you need to know that a 
district  court’s  decision  is  presumed  to  be 
correct.    You  have  the  burden  of  showing 
that  the  district  court  was  wrong.      If  the 
Court  can’t figure  out  what you  are  arguing 
in your brief, you will lose.

If  the  case  does  not  settle,  what  happens 
next? 
Your appeal goes forward.  While mediation 
was  taking  place,  you  probably  received  a 
notice  from the Clerk of  the Supreme Court 
telling  you  that  the  Clerk  had  received  the 
district  court  record.    That  notice  told  you 
that   you   had   to   file   your   opening   brief 
within  30  calendar  days  after  the  Clerk 
received  the  record.     You  must  file  your 
brief by the date it is due even if mediation 
is still taking place. 

You may file a motion for extension of time 
to  file  an  opening  brief  on  appeal.     The 
Court  will  give  you  a  30  day  extension  if

I.   If I am the Appellant, when do I file my 
Appellant’s Brief? [Rule 13] 
The  Clerk  of  the  Supreme  Court  will  send  a 
“Notice  of  Filing”  to  all  the  parties  when  it 
receives   the   district   court   record.   This 
notice will  state that the Appellant’s brief is 
due  30  calendar  days  from  the  date  the 
record  was  filed.    The  Notice  will  not  tell 
you  the  actual  date  your  brief  is  due.   You 
must figure that out yourself.   Use the How 
do  I  count  the  days?  section  on  page  4  of 
this Handbook. 

If  you  cannot  file  your  brief  within  30  days 
of  the  date  the  Notice  was  filed,  you  may 
ask  the  Court  for  more  time  by  filing  a 
Motion for Extension of Time.   Form 26 is a 
sample Motion for Extension of  Time.   Also, 
the  MOTIONS  section  of  this  Handbook  on

If  the  Court  determines  that  you  didn’t 
sufficiently  comply  with  these  Rules,  your 
brief   may   be   returned   to   you.   If   it   is 
returned  to  you,  the  Court  will  bill  you  for 
the  costs  of  postage.  The  Court  will  attach 
an  order  telling  you  what  you  did  wrong. 
The  order  will  also  tell  you  how  long  you 
have  to  correct  your  brief  and  re-file  it.   If 
you don’t correct it and re-file it in time, the 
Court will probably dismiss your appeal. 

If  your  argument  is  so  confusing  or  poorly 
developed  that  the  Court  is  left  to  guess 
what  your  argument  is  and  what  law  might 
support  it,  the  Court  will  probably  dismiss 
your appeal.

that are not in the district court record. The 
Supreme  Court  will  not  consider  testimony, 
documents,  exhibits  or  records  that  the 
district  court  did  not  see  or  hear.      The 
purpose  of  your  appeal  is  to  show  that  the 
district court made a mistake.  If you did not 
ask the district court to consider a fact or an 
issue,  you  may  not  ask  the  Supreme  Court 
to rule on it. 

f  you  or  your  trial  counsel  failed  to  include 
an   important   fact,   or   evidence   in   the 
record,  you  have  no  right  to  appeal  based 
on that fact or evidence because it was your 
mistake,  not  the  district  court’s.   However, 
if  the  district  court  refused  to  admit  and 
consider  evidence  you  offered,  you  may 
include  the  court’s  refusal  as  an  issue  in 
your appeal.

efore   you   present   any   arguments,   you 
must tell the Court how it should review the 
district  court’s  decision.   How  the  Supreme 
Court  reviews  a  district  court’s  judgment  is 
called  the  Standard  of  Review.    The  Court 
has  several  different  standards  it  uses.   For 
example, 
reviews 
the  Supreme  Court 
whether the district court wrongly admitted 
evidence  for  an  abuse  of  discretion.      It 
reviews  whether  the  district  court  got  the 
facts  wrong for  clear  error.   And  it  reviews 

It  then  lists  the  statutes  or  rules  that  you 
refer to.  It also shows which page the cases 
and  statutes  are  referenced  in  your  brief. 
is  a  sample  Table  of 
Form  12(1)(a) 
Authorities. 

Usually  the  issues  in  the  Statement  of  the 
Issues are questions that tell the Court what 
mistake  the  district  court  made.        For 
example:      Did  the  district  court  err  in 
granting  Appellee  John  Smith’s  motion  for 
summary judgment? 

The  Statement  of  the  Case  is  usually  a 
paragraph  or  two  telling  the  Court  what 
type of case it is and what the district court 
decided.     For   example,  the   type  of   case 
could be a child support case.  Or it could be 
breach  of  contract  or  a  disagreement  over 
property rights. 

In  your  Statement  of  Facts,  you  may  not 
rely  upon  any  facts  that  the  district  court 
did not have before it.    The Supreme Court 
will decide your case based on the evidence 
in  the  record  on  appeal.    Therefore,  each 
time  you  list  a  fact  in  your  case,  you  must 
tell  the  Court  where  that  fact  can  be  found 
in the transcript or district court record.  For 
example, if  you  want  to  use  a  fact that  you 
gave   the   district   court   during   trial,   you 
would  find  that  fact  in  the  record  or  trial 
transcript.  You would then tell the Supreme 
Court in  your Statement of  Facts what page 
it   is   on.     If   it   was   on   page   57   of   the 
transcript, it would look like this: Tr. 57. 

If  the  fact  you  wish  to  tell  the  Supreme 
Court  is  in  a  document  you  filed  in  your 
case,  you  would  tell  the  Court  the  name  of 
the  document  and  the  docket,  or  case 
register, number the district court gave that 
document.    The  document  number  usually 
appears  in  the  bottom  right  corner  of  the

You must tell the Supreme Court the proper 
standard of  review for  each issue  you  raise. 
Give  the  name  of  at  least  one  case  that 
shows  you  have 
identified  the  correct 
standard.        This  is  called  “citing  legal 
authority.” 

Only    cite  published  Montana    Supreme 
Court  Opinions.   If  the first  paragraph of  an 
opinion  states  that  it  “shall  not  be  cited  as 
precedent,”  it  is  a  non-published  opinion 
and  you  may  not  cite  it.   Examples  of  case 
citations are: 

In  re  Marriage  of  Maxwell, 248 Mont.  189, 
810 P.2d 311 (1991). 

State v. Abe, 1998 MT 206, 290 Mont. 393, 
965 P.2d 882. 

The Argument section of your brief is where 
you  explain  why  the  district  court  wrongly 
decided each of the issues you  raise.   Make 
your  argument  as  understandable  as 
possible.   You  must recite the facts and  law 
that  support  each  argument.      Refer  to 
Montana  case 
law,  statutes,  rules,  or 
sections  of  the  Montana  constitution  that 
support your argument. 

Your  Conclusion  should  tell  the  Court  what 
you  are  asking  it  to  do.    For  example:  The 
Court  should  reverse  the  judgment  of  the 
district  court  and  remand  the  case  to  the 
district court for a trial on the merits.

When all the briefs have been filed with the 
Clerk  of  the  Supreme  Court,  the  Clerk  will 
deliver them to  the  Supreme Court  justices. 
The Chief Justice will then assign the case to 
a  panel  of  five  justices  or  to  the  entire 
Court.    This  process  is  called  classification. 
After the Court decides how the case will be 
classified,  it  will  issue  an  Order  letting  the 
parties   know   the   Court   is   reviewing   the 
case.      The   Court   may   issue   its   Opinion 
within   days   or   months   of   receiving   the 
briefs,  depending  on  the  complexity  of  the 
case. 

OTIONS 

hat is a motion? 

This Handbook has stated several times that 
parties  to  an  appeal  may file  a  motion  with 
the  Court.   A  motion  is  a  written document 
a party files with the Court asking the Court 
to  do  something or  to  permit the  parties  to 
do something. 

hat  kinds  of  motions  can  be  filed  with 

the Supreme Court? 
Motions  typically  filed  during  a  civil  appeal 
are: 

●  Motion  to  Proceed  without  Paying 

the Filing Fee 

●  Motion for Extension of Time 

hat must a motion contain? [Rule 16] 

If you file a motion with the Court, you must 
clearly  tell  the  Court  what  you  want,  and 
why you need it. 

ou  must  also  tell the  Court  in  your  motion 
whether  any  of  the  other  parties  object  to 
your motion. This means you must ask each 
opposing  party  if  he  or  she  objects  to  it.   If 
the party has  an  attorney, ask  the attorney. 
If you do not tell the Court whether another 
party  objects,  the  Clerk  will  not  file  your 
motion.    (If  you  or  the  other  party  is  an

On  the  same  day  you  mail  or  hand-deliver 
your  brief  to  the  Clerk’s  office,  serve  your 
brief  on  the  other  parties.   See  the  section 
above  called  What  does  “serve”  mean  and 
how do I prove I served someone? 

II.   What  if  I  am  the  Appellee?  [Rules  11, 
12 and 13] 
If  you  are  the  Appellee  in  a  case,  after 
receiving   a   copy   of   Appellant’s   opening 
brief,  you  will  have  30  calendar  days  from 
the date  on  the  Certificate of  Service  in  the 
Appellant’s  brief  to  file  your  answer.   Your 
brief  is  called  Appellee’s  Response  Brief. 
You may file a Motion for Extension of Time 
if you can’t file the brief on time. 

Unlike  the  Appellant,  you  may  file  only  one 
brief  on  appeal—your  Appellee’s  Response 
Brief. 

The  Appellee’s  brief  must  have  a  salmon- 
colored  cover.  Other  than  the  color  of  the 
cover  page,  all  the  requirements  for  the 
Appellant’s  brief  apply  to  the  Appellee  as 
well. 

If I am the Appellant, may I respond to the 
Appellee’s Brief? [Rules 11 and 13] 
Yes,  you  may  file  a  reply  brief,  but  you  are 
not required to do so.  You must file it and 9 
copies  within  14  calendar  days  of  the 
Certificate  of  Service  date 
in  Appellee’s 
response brief.   In your reply brief, you may

ONLY  address  arguments  raised 
Appellee’s brief.  You may not raise any new 
arguments or rehash issues that were raised 
in your opening brief.    Your reply brief may 
not  be  longer  than  14  typewritten pages  or 
contain  more  than  5,000  words.   The  cover 
page must be gray.

Just  because  the  other  party  objects,  this 
does not mean that the Court will deny your 
motion.         The   Court   will   rule   on   your 
motion,  prepare  an  order,  and  send  it  to

If  you  have  any  documents  that  support

What does a motion look like? [Rule 11] 
The  following  rules  that  apply  to  briefs  also 
apply  to  most  motions,  including  motions 
for extension of time discussed below:

●  1 inch margins 
●  Double spaced 
●  Each page numbered 
●  14  point  Times  New  Roman  font  if

●  Sign the original motion 
●  Attach Certificate of Service 
●  Attach Certificate of Compliance 
●  Staple in the top left corner 
●  Serve all the parties 

The following rules apply just to motions: 

●  5 typewritten pages or no more than 

1,250 words 
●  No cover sheet 

How do I file a motion? [Rule 10] 
If  the  other  party  does  not  object  to  your 
motion,  file  your  original  motion,  with  any 
supporting  documents  you  may  have,  with 
the Clerk of the Supreme Court.  You do not 
need  to  include  extra  copies  of  the  motion, 
but  you  should  include  a  proposed  order 
that you would like the Court to sign.  There 
are  examples  of  several  motions  in  the 
Forms  section  of  this  Handbook.     At  the 
time  you  file  your  motion,  give  the  Clerk 
envelopes  that  are  addressed  to  yourself 
and  to  each  party,  or  his  or  her  attorney. 
Make sure to put stamps on the envelopes.

If  the  other  party  does  not  object  to  the 
Court  giving  you  extra  time,  the  Clerk  will 
grant  your  motion  and  give  you  30  more 
days  to  complete  the  task.   Thirty  calendar 
days  is  usually  the  most  the  Clerk  or  the 
Court will grant in extensions. 

ust  because  the  other  party  objects  does 
not mean that the Court will not grant your 
motion for extension of time. 

f  you  ask for  a  second extension, you must 
have  a  very  good  reason.   You  also  have  to 
attach  a  notarized  affidavit  to  your  motion 
explaining  in  detail  the  reasons  why  you 
need more time than  the  Court  gave  you  in 
your  first  extension.  A  statement  that  you 
were  busy,  or  had  other  business  that  kept 
you from filing the brief on time will not be 
good enough to persuade the Court to grant 
your motion. 

fter you file the motion for more time, the 
other  party  may  file  an  objection  to  the 
extension  of  time,  or  move  to  dismiss  the 
appeal because you did not follow the Court 
Rules, or both. 

ISMISSING AN APPEAL [Rule 16] 

hat if I want to dismiss my appeal? 

At  any  time  during  the  appeal  before  the 
Court   has   issued   its   Opinion,   you   may 
dismiss  your  appeal.   To  do  this,  you  must 
file  a  motion  to  voluntarily  dismiss.    Form 
16(4)  is  included  in  this  Handbook.    Also 
review  the  How  do  I  file  a  Motion?  section

Motion for Extension of Time 

What is a Motion for Extension of Time and 
how do I file one? [Rule 26] 
If    you    have    a    good    reason    for    not 
completing  a  task  during  the  time  allowed, 
you  may  ask  the  Court  for  more  time.  You 
do  this  by  filing  a  Motion  for  Extension  of 
Time.    You  may  ask  for  extra  time  to  file 
your opening brief, a response, or to comply 
with a deadline or order from the Court. 

In your motion, tell the Court: 

●  what  task  you  need  more  time  to 

complete, 

●  when the task was due, 
●  how much more time you need, 
●  why    you    should    be    allowed    to 

complete the task late, and 

●  whether   or   not   the   other   party 
objects  to  the  Court  granting  you 
extra time. 

Also, be sure to: 

●  sign and date your motion, 
●  attach a Certificate of Service, 
●  attach     a     proposed     order     with 
enough  copies  of  the  order  to  be 
sent  to  you  and  the  other  party  (or 
his or her attorney), 

●  provide  addressed  and  stamped 
envelopes  for  each  party  (or  his  or 
her attorney) and yourself, and 

●  serve      your      motion      with      all 
supporting  documents  on  the  other 
parties.

an the Supreme Court order a losing party 
to   pay   the   costs   of   the   winning   party? 
[Rule 19] 
Three types of money issues may arise in an 
appeal—costs  of  the  appeal,  interest  on 
judgments, and sanctions. 

 winning party may ask the Supreme Court 
to  make  the  losing  party  repay  it  for  the 
money  spent  on  the  appeal.    Typical  costs 
include: 

●  copying briefs and documents 
●  mailing or sending the record 
●

pays  its  own  attorney.  A  self-represented 
litigant   is   not   an   attorney   licensed   to 
practice  law  and  is  not  entitled  to  claim 
attorney’s  fees.   However,  if  your  appeal  is 
determined  to  be  frivolous,  you  may  be 
ordered  to  pay  the  other  party’s  attorney 
fees. 

f you are appealing a money judgment, and 
you  lose  in  the  Supreme  Court,  you  must 
pay interest on the judgment from the time 
the  judgment  was  made  final  in  the  district

FINAL DECISION BY THE SUPREME COURT 

What kind of rulings does the Court issue? 
[Rule 19] 
After the Court decides a case on appeal, it 
issues  its  ruling,  called  an  Opinion.  The 
Court’s    Opinion    may    be    one    of    the 
following: 

●  The  Court  may  uphold,  or  “affirm,” 
the  district  court’s  decision.      This 
the  Supreme  Court 
that 
means 
agreed  with 
the  district  court’s 
decision. 

●  The  Court  may  “reverse”  the  district 
court’s  decision.   Sometimes  after  a 
reversal,  the  Court  may  “remand,” 
meaning it will send the case back to 
the  district     court,     for     another 
hearing  or  entry  of  a  judgment  in 
your favor. 

●  The Court may reverse some of what 
the  district  court  decided  and  affirm 
some of it. 

  prejudice  and 

●  The  Court  may  dismiss  the  appeal. 
There  are  two  types  of  dismissals: 
with 
  without 
prejudice.    Dismissal  with  prejudice 
means  the  case  is  over.   The  parties 
cannot    litigate    the    issues    again 
either  in  the  district  court  or  the 
Supreme  Court.      An  appeal  that  is 
dismissed  without  prejudice  can  be 
re-filed  later.      This  usually  occurs 
when the appeal  was filed  too  soon, 
for   example,   before   a   final   order 
was issued. 

○  Dismissal  can  occur  for  other 
reasons   too.     For   example,

the  Court  to  do,  but  you  should  know  the 
Court has the power to do it. 

If the Court awards costs, fees, or sanctions, 
the    district    court    will    determine    the 
amount. 

What  if  I  don’t  agree  with  the  Supreme 
Court’s decision? [Rule 20] 
Rule  20  allows  a  party  to  ask  the  Supreme 
Court  to  reconsider  its  ruling  only  if  the 
Court made one of the errors listed in Rule 
20. 

Generally,  a  Supreme  Court  ruling  is  the 
final decision in a case. 

As  noted  above,  the  Clerk  of  the  Supreme 
Court will  return the district court record to 
the  clerk  of  the  district  court  at  the  end  of 
the appeal.  The Clerk of the Supreme Court 
will  charge  the  Appellant  for  the  mailing 
costs of returning the record.

GLOSSARY OF LEGAL TERMS 

Administrative  Agency:  A  public  agency  usually  associated  with  the  State  or  Federal 
government.  For example, the Montana Department of Labor is an administrative agency. 

Affidavit:  A voluntary written statement that the writer swears contains only the truth.  It must 
be signed in front of a notary public. 

Affirm:  To confirm or agree with the decision or action taken by the district court. 

Anders  Brief:      A  brief  filed  by  a  court-appointed  criminal  defense  attorney  who  wants  to 
withdraw from the case on appeal because the attorney believes the appeal is frivolous. 

Appeal:  A review of a case requested by one of the parties to the Montana Supreme Court.  In 
the appeal, the Montana Supreme Court will review what happened before the district court to 
determine if errors occurred that were significant enough to require some form of relief to the 
party that filed the appeal. 

Appellant:   The party appealing a decision.   This is the party who lost in  the district court and 
wants  the  Supreme  Court  to  reverse  or  modify  the  judgment  of  the  district  court.    The 
Appellant has the burden of proving that a significant error or mistake occurred in district court. 

Appellee:  The party who won in the district court.  This party usually wants the Supreme Court 
to agree with the decision of the district court. 

Attorney:   A  person  who  has  been  trained  and  licensed  to  represent  others  in  legal  matters. 
Also known as a lawyer or counsel.

are appealing if you lose your appeal. 

Burden of Proof:  The duty to prove a disputed claim or charge.  It includes burden to produce 
information  and  the  burden  to  persuade.   For  example,  if  you  file  an  appeal  in  the  Montana

clerk to send the district court file to the Clerk of Supreme Court. 

Clerk of Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court official who keeps court records and official files. 
When  an  appeal  is  filed,  the  Appellant’s  and  Appellee’s  briefs  are  filed  with  the  Clerk  of

appeal is over. 

Complaint:    A  document  filed  with  a  district  court  or  justice  court  to  begin  a  civil  case.    A

Counsel:  An attorney or a lawyer. 

Counterclaim:     After  a   plaintiff   sues   a   defendant,  the  defendant  will   be   served  with   a 
complaint.   The  defendant  will  answer  the  complaint  but  may  also  counter-sue  the  plaintiff. 
This countersuit is called a counterclaim. 

Criminal  Case:    A  case  brought  by  the  government  against  a  person  accused  of  violating 
Montana’s criminal laws.  An appeal of a criminal case is called a criminal appeal. 

Cross-Appeal:   An  appeal  by  the  Appellee.   After  an  Appellant  files  an  appeal,  if  the  Appellee 
believes the district court also made an error that hurts the Appellee, the Appellee will answer 
the Appellant’s Brief but will also file a cross-appeal. 

Defendant:   In a civil case, the person against whom damages or another solution is sought.  In 
a criminal case, the person who is charged with a crime. 

Designation of party:  What role the parties have in a case.  The party designations are usually 
the Plaintiff (the person suing or the State prosecuting), the Defendant (the person being sued 
or  being  prosecuted),  the  Appellant  (the  person  appealing),  and  the  Appellee  (the  person  or 
party who won in the district court). 

Discretionary Duty:  A duty performed by a public officer that allows the exercise of judgment. 
In  other  words,  the  public  officer  may  choose  to  perform  that  task  or  may  choose  to  not 
perform it.  Compare with Ministerial Duty. 

District Court:  In most cases, the district court is the trial court.  However, trials may be held in

This Handbook is only for civil appeals from district court to the Montana Supreme Court. 

Department of Corrections (DOC) Commitment:   When a defendant is found guilty of a felony 
offense  based  upon  a  verdict  of  guilty,  a  plea  of  guilty  or  nolo  contendere,  the  district  court 
may commit the defendant to  the DOC  for  placement in  an  appropriate  program or  facility to 
serve a sentence.  The DOC then assesses the defendant and determines whether the sentence 
will  be  served  in  prison,  in  a  special  program,  on  intensive  supervision  or  probation.    See 
Section 46-18-201(3)(a)(iv)(A), MCA, for exceptions.   A DOC  commitment may also be  imposed 
when a revocation of a previous sentence is ordered.   All except five years must be suspended 
on a DOC commitment.  If the suspended portion of the DOC commitment is revoked, however, 
the district court does not have to suspend any portion of the commitment. 

Docket:   A list  of  documents filed with the Clerk’s office  which shows the date on  which each 
document was filed.

14.   The petitioner must establish that urgency or emergency factors exist and the petitioner is 
entitled  to  an  order  requiring  a  party  or  parties  to  do  something,  or  refrain  from  doing 
something.   The petitioner has the burden of proving entitlement to relief, including providing 
the Montana Supreme Court with arguments and documents supporting the petition. 

Facially Invalid Sentence:  A sentence that the court lacked authority to impose.  The sentence 
is enhanced beyond the term allowed by state law or constitutional limitations.  Facial invalidity 
can be determined by reviewing only the law or  constitutional provision (such as the guaranty

Findings of Fact/Conclusions of Law:   Frequently the district court’s final order or judgment is 
called “Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order.”  It is a written order where the district 
court decides which of the facts are true and relevant and what law applies. 

Habeas Corpus:   A petition for a writ of habeas corpus may be filed directly with the Supreme 
Court as an original proceeding asking the Court to issue a writ of habeas corpus that concludes 
that  a  person  is  being  unlawfully  imprisoned  or  detained.    Unless  your  sentence  is  facially 
invalid, you will not be entitled to habeas relief if your argument was raised or could have been 
raised on appeal or in a timely petition for postconviction relief.

must  work  with  a  mediator  to  try  to  settle the  case  while, at  the  same  time, proceeding  with 
the appeal. 

22 

Mediator:  A person, often an attorney, who is skilled in resolving conflicts between people.

but there are issues the Supreme Court will sometimes review before the district court decides 
the case.   An original petition may be filed by a party to request a form of extraordinary relief 
not available through an appeal.  Montana Rule of Appellate Procedure 14 explains the Court’s 
original jurisdiction. 

Parole  revocation:    When  a  parolee  has  violated  conditions  of  parole  supervision,  there  are

generally NOT considered in an appeal. 

Question  of  Law:   A  question  that  depends  on  analyzing,  interpreting  and  applying  the  law.

Sentence Review Division. 

Serve:  To mail or hand-deliver documents in a law suit or an appeal to the other parties, and at 
times other relevant persons such as the clerk of the district court and the court reporter.  If the 
other party has an attorney, you must serve the attorney and NOT the party. 

Standard of  Review:   How  the  Supreme  Court  reviews the  decision  of  the  district  court.   The 
applicable standard may be whether the district court abused its discretion, the district court’s 
decision was clearly erroneous, whether the findings of fact are correct and the court correctly 
interpreted the law or others. 

Statement of Position:  A written statement issued by the parties during mediation setting out 
the disputed issues and each party’s legal position on those issues.

about all the relevant facts or the judge concludes that no important facts are in dispute.   The 
judge’s  ruling  relates  only  to  legal  issues.    It  usually  provides  a  faster  resolution  to  a  case 
because no trial is held. 

Supervisory  Control:    The  control  exercised  by  the  Supreme  Court  over  the  other  courts  in 
Montana.  A  petition  for  supervisory  control  asks  the  Supreme  Court  to  supervise  the  work  of

Table of Authorities:   A listing of the legal cases, statutes and other sources used in the brief, 
and the page on which each authority was cited. 

Time Bar:  When the time for raising an issue in a criminal proceeding has passed.  For example, 
a  postconviction  petition  must  be  filed  within  one  year  of  when a  conviction became final.   If 
the defendant fails to file a petition for postconviction relief within that time, the defendant is 
usually “barred” from litigating all postconviction issues.  Another time bar is when the time for 
filing a notice of appeal has elapsed.  See section 46-21-105, MCA. 

Transcript:   The  typewritten version of  everything that  was  said  at  the trial  or  hearings  in  the 
case.      The  transcript  is  prepared  by  a  court  reporter.    A  CD  that  recorded  all  the  spoken 
proceedings may be  in the record when you  appeal from small  claims court, a  city court or a 

26 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justice  court.  The  Appellant  is  responsible  for  ensuring  the  transcript  is  prepared  and  sent  to 
the Supreme Court. 

Trial Record:  All original documents—from the complaint to the judgment—filed during a case 
by the parties to the case in justice, city, or district court. 

Venue:  The proper place for a trial to be held or a lawsuit to be filed. 

Verify: To prove to be true or to swear to the truthfulness of. 

Verified  Petition:  A  petition  filed  with  the  Court  that  the  petitioner  swears  in  an  affidavit  is 
truthful.      Records,  transcripts,  and  other  evidence  may  be  attached  to  help  prove  the 
truthfulness of the petition statements. 

Weapon Enhancement:  When the use of a weapon can be used to increase a sentence for an 
offense that did not require the use of a weapon. 

Writ:  When a court grants relief in a written order in response to a Petition for a Writ.

access  to  either  Westlaw  or  Lexis online  legal  research  service  is  available  at  both  Law 
Libraries.  Access  to  Westlaw  or  Lexis  is important so that you can check whether the cases 
and laws that you are relying upon are still good law. 

These are some good beginning books about legal research which self-represented litigants will 
find useful.

Information on Legal Citation 
Lawyers have their own method of “citing” materials in their writing. It will help you to do your 
research and  writing  if  you  understand  citation  shorthand.   There  are  two  style  manuals  used 
by lawyers presently – 

The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation, 20th ed; and 

ALWD Citation Manual: A Professional System of Citation, 5th ed. 

Either  system  can  be  used  when  writing  for  the  Montana  Supreme  Court.    Pick  one  style 
manual and then be consistent.   The best way to learn the basics about citation is through the 
Internet.  These are good sites to help you get started.
