Introduction
Turning 18 is an exciting time in your life. You’re getting closer to graduation and you’re taking your first steps into early 

adulthood. As fun a time as it is, you should keep this in mind: in the eyes of the state of Montana, you are an adult! This is 

great news for you, but with it comes a new set of responsibilities. All the laws are different and your obligations are different, 
too. Included in this guide are some helpful tips and pointers to help you make your transition into the adult world. This guide 
doesn’t have all the answers, but it can help point you in the right direction.

A note about the Montana laws – you will see a series of letters and numbers beginning with MCA. That stands for Montana 

Code Annotated, which is the multi-volume set of Montana laws. The numbers refer to volume, chapter, and section. The 
Montana Code Annotated provides more details about laws referred to in this Guide. Find them at  
www.leg.mt.gov or at your local library.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The information in this guide to is a summary of a few Montana and Federal laws and procedures; it is 

not meant to be legal advice. To receive legal advice about a situation that affects you, consult an attorney.

Getting Arrested and  
the Criminal Court

What happens if I’m arrested?
If you have committed a crime, or are suspected of 

committing a crime, for which the penalty could include 
jail time, you will be taken into police custody. If the police 
have “probable cause” (which means a police officer having a 
reasonable reason to believe you committed the crime), they 
can arrest you on the spot. Otherwise, the police will issue 
an arrest warrant and a police officer will locate you and take 
you into custody, no matter where you happen to be at the 
time (home, work, school, etc.). 

It is VERY IMPORTANT to go peacefully, or you could 

be subject to additional criminal charges for things like 
resisting arrest or assault on a police officer. Some people 
escalate a misdemeanor arrest into a felony (a more serious 
crime than a misdemeanor that you will face a more harsh 
sentence for if convicted of the crime) simply by fighting 
with the police, trying to run away, or otherwise not 
allowing themselves to be peacefully taken into custody. 

Once you are in custody, the police will read you your 
Miranda rights. Under the 5th Amendment of the U.S. 
Constitution, you have the right to avoid self-incrimination. 
The U.S. Supreme Court decision Miranda v. Arizona and 
later cases outlined the police’s legal obligation to remind 
anyone taken into custody of his rights. The reading of the 
Miranda warning will sound like this: 

You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can 
and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the 
right to have an attorney present during questioning. If you 
cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.

 If the police do not read you these rights at the time you 

are taken into custody, any incriminating statements you 
might make are presumed to be involuntary and usually 
cannot be used as evidence at your trial. However, you have 
the right to an attorney, and it is highly advisable that you 
request one immediately.

When can I request an attorney? 
You may ask for an attorney to be present at any time, 

even if you have not been arrested and are just being 
questioned. Your right to not incriminate yourself is one of 
the strongest rights you have under the U.S. Constitution. 

You can also request that an attorney be appointed for you 
at any time. If you are arrested and require an attorney while 
you are in jail, you will be given the opportunity to call one. 
If you don’t know one, or cannot get a private attorney to 
represent you, the Public Defender’s Office often can provide 
you short-term legal counsel through your initial court 
appearance. However, for them to represent you further, 
you have to prove that you cannot afford to hire a private 
attorney. 

What happens at the jail?
When you arrive at the jail, you will be fingerprinted, 

have your photograph taken, and may be questioned 
further. You may – and should – request the presence of an 
attorney before agreeing to answer any questions. 

Sometimes a person may be released on his own 

recognizance if he is charged with a very minor offense 
(particularly if the jail is already full). Being released on your 
own recognizance means that you are released from police 
custody upon your agreement that you will go to court when 
you are supposed to, and you do not have to pay any bail 
in order to be released. Usually, however, you will have to 
stay in jail or in police custody until you can go in front of 
a judge and have bail set. When you are checked into jail, 
you must surrender all of your personal effects and put on 
jail-issued clothing (typically a jumpsuit and flip-flop shoes). 
And you will be fingerprinted and photographed.

What is an arraignment?
In Montana, the procedures for an “arraignment” – where 

you enter a plea of guilty or not  

guilty – vary depending on whether you have been charged 
with a misdemeanor or a felony. In general terms, a 

4

misdemeanor is a crime that is punishable by more than 
five days but less than one year in jail. Any crime where you 
could be imprisoned for more than a year is a felony. Any 
crime where you would serve less than five days, or serve no 
jail time at all, is generally called an infraction. 

In Montana, misdemeanors are usually tried in city court 
or justice court. A felony is generally tried in a state district 
court. 

In district court, before you would go to trial, you 

would face a three-part process: an initial appearance, the 
commencement of prosecution, and the arraignment. 

First, you have an initial appearance, where the charges 
you were arrested for are made public and you are informed 
of your right to an attorney, the bail that is set, and other 
legal rights you may have. If you haven’t been given an 
attorney yet, this is another time when you can make a 
request for one. 

Bail is money or property (or a bond provided by a bail 

bondsman) that you give to the court to persuade it to 
release you from jail before your trial date. When you show 
up for all your court dates, the bail is returned to you. If you 
fail to show up, the court seizes your bail. You usually have 
a right to post bail unless you are charged with a crime that 
could be subject to the death penalty. Usually, you will be 
released on bail with a number of specific requirements that 
you must follow if you want to avoid staying in jail until your 
trial. 

If you have been arrested for a serious crime that will be 
tried in district court, your initial appearance is followed by 
proceedings where the prosecution formally requests leave 
to file charges against you. Usually this is a “preliminary 
examination,” where you appear in front of the judge and the 
prosecution presents the evidence they have to support their 
charge.

Once formal charges have been filed, you have an 

“arraignment,” where you enter a plea. You usually only have 
two options for a plea: guilty or not guilty. (A third type of 
plea, “nolo contendere,” is commonly called “no contest” 
plea. In this instance, a defendant does not dispute the 
charges against him, but does not openly accept guilt. It has 
the same effect as a guilty plea. You should have an attorney 
advise you whether it is appropriate. As a rule, you should 
have the advice of an attorney before you enter any kind of 
plea.) 

If you are charged with a minor crime where you did not 

get put into jail and instead are asked to appear in justice 
court or city court on a certain day, these proceedings are 
often completed in a single hearing. For example, if the 
police give you a citation (often called a “ticket”), the citation 
itself is the complaint, and when you appear in front of the 

judge, you will be asked to make a plea on the spot.

What happens after I plead “guilty” or 
“not guilty”?
If you plead “guilty,” you will usually be sentenced on the 

spot by the judge for a misdemeanor – though for complex 
misdemeanors and most felonies, they often set a sentencing 
hearing for a later date. If you plead “not guilty,” the judge 
will set a trial date for you, and usually asks if you want a 
“bench trial” – a trial in front of the judge, who makes a 
decision without a jury – or a “jury trial” – where a jury of 
six to twelve people decides if you are guilty or innocent. 
An attorney should also advise you on whether to request a 
bench or jury trial; there are advantages and disadvantages 
to each.

What is a “plea bargain”?
If you plead “not guilty,” sometimes instead of going to 

trial, your attorney and the prosecuting attorney may 

reach an agreement where you will agree to change your plea 
to guilty, sometimes to a lesser charge, and accept a sentence 
that is less than what you might otherwise have served. 
It is not a good idea to try and reach a plea agreement on 
your own; an attorney is in the position to know how to 
get the best possible outcome for you, depending on your 
circumstances. However, be aware that if a plea agreement 
is offered to you, you can choose not to accept it, and go to 
trial instead. Furthermore, a judge is not obligated to accept 
a plea agreement, though they usually do. If the judge does 
reject the plea agreement, you are given the opportunity to 
also withdraw your guilty plea. MCA §46-12-211.

What happens if I go to trial?
You should have an attorney if you go to trial, though 

for minor charges, such as a traffic ticket, some people 
represent themselves. (You do not have the right to a free 
attorney unless you are facing jail time as part of your 
sentence if found guilty.) When you go to trial, there will 
almost always be a prosecuting attorney who will present the 
witnesses and evidence against you, and your attorney will 
have a chance to cross-examine them. You will also have the 
opportunity to put on witnesses in your own defense; the 
prosecutor will get to cross-examine them. At the end of the 
trial, if you are found not guilty, you are free to go. If you are 
found guilty, then the judge usually sets a separate hearing 
for later to determine your sentence.

G218Lawsuits and the Civil Court

How do I file a lawsuit?
Before you take any action, you need to seriously consider 

whether or not you should hire a lawyer. Filing a 
lawsuit, or even deciding whether or not you should file 
one, is not simple. While having a lawyer is not required, 
if you choose to proceed on your own, you must read and 
follow Montana’s Rules of Civil Procedure located in the 
Montana Code Annotated (MCA), as well as any local rules 
that individual courts may have. Failure to follow these 
rules, which include deadlines and procedures necessary to 
advance your claim, can result in the court dismissing your 
claim. 

Often, lawyers will offer free initial consultations 

to help you and the lawyer decide whether or 
not you have a claim that is worth pursuing. 
If you believe you cannot afford a lawyer, 
your community may have programs in 
which local lawyers volunteer their time 
or offer reduced rates depending on 
your income. Your local legal services 
agency should be able to tell you if such 
a program exists. 

Equally important is determining 

whether you have a good case that you can 
win. If you decide to hire a lawyer, he will 
advise you on this threshold question. If you 
choose to proceed without a lawyer, you must 
research the legal theories that apply to your case. You 
can find many of the forms you need for free online. You 
must also determine whether you have enough evidence, 
which may or may not include witnesses, to prove your case. 

Whether you hire a lawyer or proceed on your own, you 
must seriously consider the expense of the lawsuit and the 
sources for paying these expenses. Lawsuits are not only 
expensive but are often time-consuming and require a 
considerable amount of physical and emotional energy. For 
these reasons, it is generally not a good idea to file a lawsuit 
“to prove a point.” 

What are some reasons for filing a 
lawsuit?

•  You were injured.

•  Your property was damaged.

•  Merchandise you purchased was defective.

•  A person or company did not comply with an oral or 

written contract with you.

•  Work you paid someone to do was not completed.

•  You were not paid for your work.

•  A professional – for example, a doctor, lawyer, or real 

estate agent – did not comply with the standards for 
his profession and you suffered damages as a result.

A civil lawsuit can be filed on behalf of a person who 

is injured (emotionally or physically) or whose 

property is damaged because of another person’s 

negligence. A civil suit seeks financial 

compensation from the person that is 

being accused of causing the harm. If 

A civil lawsuit can be 
filed on behalf of a person who 
is injured (emotionally or physically) 
or whose property is damaged because 
of another person’s negligence. A civil 
suit seeks financial compensation from 
the person that is being accused of 
causing the harm.

that person (the defendant) is found to 
be guilty, he or she will be responsible 
for paying the damages.

Once you have decided to go 
forward with your lawsuit, you can 
expect the following events:

First, the plaintiff – the person who 

files the lawsuit – must decide which 
court is the proper one to hear the claim. 

Montana has state courts, federal courts, 
justice courts, and small claims courts, among 
others. Which court is proper depends on both the 
nature of the claim and the amount of damages the plaintiff 
is seeking. 

Generally, small-claims courts and justice courts hear cases 

where the plaintiff is claiming a small amount of damages, 
usually less than $5,000. State courts (which are located in 
county seats) are not limited by the amount of damages 
claimed. In order to file a claim in federal court (located 
in Missoula, Butte, Great Falls, Helena, and Billings), the 
plaintiff must generally either be suing someone who is not a 
Montana resident or the claim must be one based on federal 
law, such as the Constitution or a federal statute. 

Next, the plaintiff must ensure that the time to file the 
lawsuit has not expired. Each type of claim has a specific 
period of time or a “statute of limitations.” Once this time 
period has passed, the plaintiff can no longer sue. The 
time generally begins to run when the event leading to the 

6

G218lawsuit, such as a car accident or the signing of a contract, 
occurs. Statutes of limitation generally range from six 
months to ten years in Montana. Check the MCA for the 
statute of limitations for your particular action.

A lawsuit actually begins when the plaintiff files a 

complaint with the clerk of court. The complaint must list 
the grounds for the claim, including the identities of those 
who are being sued – the defendants – and the reasons for 
the lawsuit. If the plaintiff desires to have a jury decide the 
case, he usually must request this in the complaint. The 
complaint may also address the specific amount of money 
or other relief that the plaintiff is requesting. The 
plaintiff must pay a fee (often more than $100) to 
file a complaint. 

After the complaint is filed, the 

defendant is served with a “summons,” 
which is issued by the clerk of court 
and informs the defendant that the 
plaintiff has filed a lawsuit against 
him. A summons generally must be 
delivered in person to the defendant. A 
sheriff, other law enforcement officer, 
or a “process server” (one who is in 
the business of serving court documents 
on people) makes this delivery. Once the 
lawsuit has been filed, the plaintiff must 
actively prosecute his claim in order to avoid 
having the court dismiss it.

What happens if you are sued?
The following information is a general outline of what 

happens when a person is sued. Rules and procedures 
vary, even within Montana, depending in which court the 
action occurs, as well as according to the subject matter of 
the claim and the identity of the parties. 

When a plaintiff files a lawsuit, the defendant has a 

specified period of time to respond to the complaint with 
an “answer.” The defendant can, of course, choose not to 
respond to the court. Failure to respond will, however, most 
likely result in a “default judgment” being entered against the 
defendant. A default judgment may mean that if the plaintiff 
is seeking a certain sum of money from the defendant, the 
court will order the defendant to pay this amount to the 
plaintiff. Because a default judgment is not desirable, the 
defendant will usually answer the complaint within the 
required time. 

In the answer, the defendant may deny the plaintiff ’s 

claims or may assert a defense to these claims. Some 
defenses may include, but are not limited to, the defendant’s 
objections to personal jurisdiction (whether that particular 

court has authority over the defendant), venue (whether the 
action was filed in the proper court), service (whether the 
complaint and summons were delivered to the defendant 
properly), and whether the plaintiff ’s complaint actually 
states a claim against the defendant. The defendant generally 
cannot use these defenses if he fails to address them in the 
answer. 

If the defendant has claims against the plaintiff, known 

as “counterclaims,” he must generally assert these on or 
before the time to answer has expired. An example of a 
counterclaim is when both a plaintiff and a defendant are 

injured in a car accident and both allege that the other 
caused the accident. The defendant generally 
must bring his counterclaim for his own 

injuries in conjunction with his answer to 

the plaintiff ’s claim of injuries. 

A lawsuit actually begins 
when the plaintiff files a complaint 
with the clerk of court. The complaint 
must list the grounds for the claim, 
including the identities of those who are 
being sued – the defendants – and 
the reasons for the lawsuit. 

When the court receives the 
defendant’s answer and any 
counterclaims, the judge sets a trial 
date (which is usually more than a 
year from the time the complaint 
is filed) and the “discovery” process 
begins. Discovery is intended to allow 

both the plaintiff and defendant to 

obtain information – from witnesses and 
documents, and from each other. Unlike trials 
in television shows, discovery generally prevents 
either side from being surprised by undisclosed facts 

or unknown witnesses. Both sides must comply with the 
other’s discovery requests if the requests are allowed under 
the Rules of Civil Procedure contained in the MCA. Again, if 
you choose to proceed without a lawyer, you must read and 
follow these rules, which can often be complex. 

In the time before the trial, the plaintiff and defendant 
may file various motions with the court. These motions 
generally ask the court to make a certain ruling or to order 
the other party to take a certain action. Common motions 
include requests for the court to order the other party to 
answer discovery requests, to dismiss the claims against a 
party under a particular legal theory, or to exclude certain 
evidence at trial. 

Often a judge requires that the parties participate in a 
settlement conference before the date of trial. At such a 
conference, a “mediator,” who is generally an experienced 
lawyer or a retired judge, works with both parties to help 
them reach a settlement without going to trial. 

If a trial is necessary, the jury will be selected on the first 
day of trial, unless the parties have agreed to have a judge 
decide the case or unless the law does not allow for a jury 
for that claim. After the jury is selected, the lawyer for each 
side (or you, if you have no lawyer) makes an opening 

7

G218statement, which explains what evidence will be presented 
and the reasons that party believes he should win. Because 
the plaintiff has the burden of proving his case in a civil 
trial, he presents his opening statement before the defendant 
presents his. 

judgment, which will usually be a monetary award. If the 
defendant fails to pay, the court has various powers to seize 
any of the defendant’s assets located within its jurisdiction 
via such methods as bank account garnishments, liens, and 
wage garnishments.

The plaintiff also presents his evidence first. The plaintiff 
gets to question his own witnesses, after which the defendant 
gets to “cross-examine” the plaintiff ’s witnesses. 

A losing party can generally appeal to a higher court from 

a judgment only when the judge incorrectly ruled on the 

The process then reverses: the defendant 
asks questions of his witnesses, followed by 
the plaintiff ’s cross-examination. 

After the presentation of evidence, 
each side makes a closing statement, 
which summarizes its arguments and 
case and asks the court or the jury to 
decide in its favor. 

If a jury is deciding the case, the judge 

will instruct the jury on the law after 
closing arguments. These instructions 
include a recitation of the law that governs 
the case, the way the jury must apply the law 
to the facts, and the burden of proof that must be 
met in order for the plaintiff to win. In a civil case, the 
plaintiff generally must prove his case by a “preponderance 
of the evidence,” a standard that means that the defendant 
“more likely than not” is liable for the plaintiff ’s damages. 

In civil cases, unlike criminal cases, the jury usually 

does not have to reach a unanimous decision. In Montana 
state courts, only two-thirds of the jurors have to agree on 
a verdict. Jury verdicts are read in the courtroom in the 
presence of the judge, the parties, and the parties’ lawyers. 

Once the jury returns a verdict, the judge enters it as a 
“judgment.” If the judgment is for the plaintiff, then the 
defendant must comply under penalty of law with the 

parties’ motions, inappropriately admitted or failed 
to admit certain evidence, or when the judge 
improperly instructed the jury on the law. 
Losing parties in Montana’s state courts 
appeal to the Montana Supreme Court, 
and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals 
hears appeals from federal courts 
in Montana. Losing parties at the 
Montana Supreme Court and the Ninth 
Circuit may appeal to the United States 
Supreme Court.

 
In civil cases, 
unlike criminal cases, the jury 
usually does not have to reach a

Why the government 

does not provide you with a 

lawyer when you are sued
As the United States Supreme Court decided in Gideon v. 

Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, a landmark 1963 decision, the 
U.S. Constitution’s Sixth Amendment mandates that the state 
must provide a lawyer for a defendant who is exposed to the 
possibility of imprisonment. Most states uphold their Sixth 
Amendment duties by instituting a public defender’s office 
and ensuring that defendants exposed to imprisonment 
are provided with a public defender. Civil cases, however, 
involve “someone suing someone for something” and do not 
carry the risk of imprisonment. Because of this, there is no 
Sixth Amendment right to a lawyer in civil cases.

Search and Seizure

The Montana Constitution provides the same privacy 

rights for those individuals under the age of 18 as it does 

for adults. Article II, Section 10 states: 

Right of Privacy. The right of individual privacy is 
essential to the wellbeing of a free society and shall not 
be infringed without the showing of a compelling state 
interest

Article II, Section 15 states: 

Rights of persons not adults. The rights of persons 
under 18 years of age shall include, but not be limited 
to, all the fundamental rights of this Article unless 
specifically precluded by laws which enhance the 
protection of such persons.

The courts in Montana recognize an individual’s 

reasonable expectations of privacy in the individual’s own 
home. This means the police cannot come and search your 

8

G218home without a warrant or some other compelling state 
interest. 

However, if you allow officers into your home and permit 

them to search, you have waived your right to privacy. 

Similarly, the police cannot search your car without a 
warrant, or probable cause and a warrant exception, or 
your consent. “Probable cause” means the officer has some 
reasonable belief, based on the facts and circumstances, that 
you have committed an offense. The “warrant exceptions” 
recognized in Montana include illegal items located in plain 
view – such as a marijuana joint on the dashboard or a beer 
can on the floor that a police officer can see from the outside 
of the car – and a search conducted after a lawful arrest. 
Searches also may be made if officers believe a danger of 
bodily harm or the imminent destruction of evidence exists. 

Dealing with the police can be an overwhelming and 
sometimes frightening experience, but it is important 
for you to remember your rights, regardless of your age. 

Always be polite and respectful, but do not let the officer 
take advantage of you. You do not have to let an officer 
search your vehicle, home, or person without a warrant or 
one of the warrant exceptions recognized in Montana. The 
investigating officer must apply to a judge to get a warrant 
and the process takes some time. Even if the officer tells 
you he has a warrant, ask to see the document. You do not 
have to answer any questions if the officer does arrest you. 
You should always request and wait to speak to an attorney 
before answering any questions from arresting officers or 
investigators. 

At school, your privacy interests are less likely to be 

protected. Be aware of this fact. School officials may conduct 
locker, backpack, classroom, and person searches if they 
have reasonable grounds to believe the search will provide 
evidence that the student has violated or is violating some 
law or school rule. The search will be permissible so long as 
it is not excessively intrusive in light of the student’s age, sex, 
and the nature of the alleged violation.

Consumer Protection

It seems that everyone has received an e-mail from Prince 

Ngobe Ngayaka of Zimbabwe who has “an immediate 

business proposal” for you, worth millions. This is an 
example of blatant fraud. But what about something less 
obvious? Say you go online and unknowingly navigate to a 
fake website that looks exactly like your financial institution’s 
real website, and you give away your log-in and password? 

Some fraud is easy to see through. Some isn’t. The result is 
the same, though: the victim of the fraud will often lose his 
or her identity, money, reputation, or credit. This section will 
show some common fraud schemes and how being a victim 
of fraud can affect you.

When you turn 18, fraud can have damaging effects. It 
becomes more difficult to “remove” financial and criminal 
records. For instance, if someone steals your identity and 
then uses it to commit a crime, you might be wanted for a 
crime you’ve never committed. As an adult, it is a difficult 
process to undo the damages of identity theft.

Credit-card fraud and your credit rating
Another complication is your credit report and credit 

rating (or credit score). A credit score is a number 
assigned to every individual, and provides a general idea of 
how well you handle your credit cards and other finances. 

9

The biggest company assigning credit scores is called the Fair 
Isaac Corporation, developed in 1956 by an engineer and a 
mathematician. A score created by this organization is called 
a FICO score, and ranges between 300 and 850. There are 
some parts of the score that you simply can’t influence; for 
instance, part of your score is based on how long you’ve had 
credit cards. By far the most important factors that decide 
your credit score are your punctuality of payment and how 
much debt you carry compared to the amount of credit you 
have available. 

Although you are 18, you may have to show your proof 
of income, show that you have the ability to pay any debt 
that you charge on a credit card or have a co-signer when 
applying for a credit card. Other restrictions can apply 
depending on the financial institution. These restrictions 
may remain until you are 21. See more detailed information 
on credit cards on Page 7. If someone else gets your credit 
card number or identity, your credit score could be ruined. 
Removing, disputing, and investigating information on 
your credit report is difficult. The best policy as far as fraud 
is concerned is prevention; cleaning up the mess is more 
difficult than taking cautionary steps.

G218Online-auction fraud
According to the National Consumer’s League, online 

auction fraud is one of the most common types of fraud 

faced by 18-year-olds.

One of the most popular online scams involving auction 
sites is sending a check for more than the asking price of the 
item you are selling. For instance, let’s say that you are selling 
your iPod online for $150. You get an e-mail from someone 
who wants to buy it, but the funds are tied up and the person 
needs you to withdraw the funds. The person will send you a 
check; you keep the money for the iPod and send the leftover 
money back. For your troubles, you get to keep $50 extra. 
The bank clears the check without any problem, so you send 
the iPod as well as the extra money to the buyer. 

In reality, there is a delay in the U.S. check clearing 
system. When the bank finds out in a few weeks that the 
check is fake, it will come back to YOU for the money. Even 
though you and the financial institution were duped by the 
bad check, the responsibility stops with you and you are 
obligated to produce the money. The bottom line is, stay 
away from any deal where the buyer offers to send you a 
check for more than you are asking – chances are it’s a scam.

What happens if you feel you’ve been 
the victim of a scam?
If the scam involves your credit card, the very first thing 

you should do is cancel your credit card and report the 
fraud to your financial institution. It’s a good idea to write 
down the toll-free number on the back of your credit cards 
in case your wallet or purse is stolen. You should also have 
the phone number of your financial institution readily 
available. Being prompt in reporting a lost or stolen credit 
card is very important.

If you are having trouble reporting a lost or stolen credit 
card, you can call the Federal Trade Commission helpline 
to get assistance. Its number is 877-FTC-HELP (877-382-
4357).

You should also send a  letter to confirm the lost or stolen 
credit card. In the letter, include your account number, the 
date you noticed your card was missing, and when you 
reported the loss. Under federal law, you are only responsible 
for $50 if your credit card was used to purchase anything. If 
only the number was stolen, or if your card was used after 
you reported it missing, you are not liable for any charges. 
If your debit card was used, the loss will depend on how 
quickly you reported the loss. Make sure you make a report 
as soon as you are aware of suspicious activity.

If you have been the victim of a fraud, you should always 

file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. 
Complaint forms, and information on identity theft, can be 
found at the FTC consumer website at: www.ftc.gov/bcp/
consumer.shtm. On that site, there is also a link to report 
identity theft.

If you have been a victim of online fraud, there is another 
website set up to help you report internet scams, located at: 
www.ic3.gov. You can always call the Montana Legal Services 
HelpLine for any legal advice regarding fraud or suspected 
fraud at 1-800-666-6899.

Buying a Vehicle

www.cars.com, which provide you with information and 
a quote from a local dealer. Make sure you are informed 
and comfortable with your decision before you approach a 
dealer.

What should I know before I buy a 
vehicle?
Buying a vehicle is a big decision. It’s your responsibility 

to do research and be a well-informed consumer. 
Know about the car you want to buy and take your time in 
making a decision. Check out car-buying websites like www.
edmunds.com or  

10

G218What about buying a used vehicle?
If you are buying a used vehicle, getting a history report – 

which lists accidents and major repairs on a specific car 
or truck – is a good idea. You may even be able to convince 
the seller to provide the vehicle history as a courtesy. Be sure 
that the report comes from a reputable source like www.
carfax.com. If you have to buy a report, it might cost you 
about $30. But keep in mind that it could end up saving you 
hundreds of dollars in the future.

What is a “lemon law”?
A “lemon law” is a protection you have against purchasing 

a substantially defective new automobile. If the defects 
are the fault of the manufacturer and you have met certain 
requirements, then Montana law requires them to repair or 
replace the vehicle. However, it is important to keep in mind 
that the Montana lemon law does not apply to used vehicles.

What should I be prepared to do 
financially?
When buying your first vehicle, make sure of two things. 

First, that you are able to put at least 20 percent down 
on the vehicle. If you are unable to do this, you may want to 
buy a cheaper vehicle. Putting anything less than 20 percent 
down will make you susceptible to an “upside down” loan, 
which means that you will end up owing more than the car 

is worth.  Second, make sure that you are able to pay off the 
loan and other costs within 48 months.

What are some other tips I should 
know?
Read everything thoroughly when signing paperwork. 

Some dealers may offer to sell you gap insurance that 
covers the difference between what your insurance company 
says your car is worth (actual cash value) if your car is 
totaled, and what you still owe on your loan or lease. Dealers 
also may offer to sell you an extended service contract, 
which covers repairs to your vehicle for a set number of 
months or miles after the original warranty expires, and 
credit life insurance, which will pay the loan balance if the 
borrower dies. If you are interested in these products, you 
should compare the rates offered for the products from 
a variety of companies. It is your responsibility to be an 
informed and educated consumer. When budgeting for a 
vehicle, you should keep in mind the costs of maintenance 
and repairs. If you don’t account for these things, you may 
get in over your head.

The bottom line is to buy a car within your means that gets 

you where you need to go. Check out www.carbuyingtips.
com for a thorough guide on what to do when buying 
a car. You should also refer to “Car Shopping Tips and 
Understanding Vehicle Financing,” published by the 
National Auto Dealers Association. It can be found at www.

Credit Cards

Credit cards are basically a relationship built on trust 

between four people: you, the merchant, the card issuer 
(such as VISA, MasterCard, or American Express), and the 
financial institution that provides credit.

The financial institution that gave you credit is vouching 
for your ability to pay your bills. In exchange, they pay the 
merchant immediate funds expecting you to pay off your 
tab at the end of the month. This is what happens when you 
write your check for the amount of  purchases you bought 
with your credit card. The merchant trusts your financial 
institution because the transaction is made through a well 
known card issuer.

Say that you spent $500 dollars for the month of May, and 

at the beginning of May you had $550 in your checking 
account. No problem, right? Well, unexpectedly you came 
down with a terrible toothache and you had to pay $500 to 
have the tooth fixed. You only have $50 in your checking 
account to put towards your credit card bill. Luckily, the 
creditor has a system to allow for these situations.

In this case, they will send you a bill that details the 

transactions you made over the past month. It will give you 
a total due, but then it will also give you an option to make a 
minimum payment, which is typically 2 or 3 percent of what 
you owe. Sounds like a great deal, right? Well, before you 
rack up the credit card, consider the interest you accrue with 
each minimum payment made.

11

G218The interest is what the financial institution charges you 

as a fee for loaning you money, which is essentially what 
credit cards do. They charge something called an Annual 
Percentage Rate (APR). Let’s say you decide to make a 
minimum payment of $10, which is 2 percent of $500, and 
the creditor charges a 15 percent APR. If you continue to 
pay only $10, it will take you 6 1/2 years (79 payments) to 
pay off the original balance. Most credit cards have a higher 
APR, and many will even change their rate over time (almost 
always going up).

As a result, you will have paid nearly $300 in interest 
charges to the bank after 6 years. If you decide to pay $50 
dollars a month instead of the minimum payment, you will 
be debt-free within a year and having paid the financial 
institution only $38 in interest charges. So coughing up a few 
extra bucks a month makes a big difference in paying down 
debt.

When are credit cards useful?
Sometimes a credit card can save you from a disaster. Most 

people will turn to a credit card if they have exhausted 

their other options for borrowing.

Say you have a broken leg and haven’t been able to afford 
health insurance. It might not sound like much, but a single 
hospital visit can rack up thousands of dollars in debt.

If you have discussed your situation with the hospital 

billing department and have done your best to set up 
manageable payments, but they just won’t budge, credit 
cards can be very useful, as long as you set up a reasonable 
time span to repay the debt and pay more than the 
minimum payment.

It is important, in case you ever charge a few thousand 

dollars onto your credit card, that you develop good 
credit in order to have a higher balance. Your first credit 
card probably won’t have a very high balance limit, a few 
hundred dollars perhaps. But as you continue to make timely 
payments and keep your debt down, you can request or 
be given a higher limit. Developing your credit score (see 
definition on Page 5) and credit limits will help you in the 
future, when you decide to buy a car or a house. 

A good credit score actually influences a lot of important 

things in your life; most employers will ask permission to 
check your credit before hiring you, and landlords routinely 
check credit as part of their decision to rent.

Why keep the card balance paid down?
It is very important to pay back more than just the 

minimum payment; carrying a balance and spending 
so much money on interest is not the way to build your 

credit score. Most people who end up in over their heads in 
credit card debt failed to have a sizeable emergency savings 
account, or they cannot resist the temptation of having easy 
credit at their disposal. Once they rack up debt on one credit 
card, many people will open another credit card in order 
to pay off the other card. Before long, they have a dozen 
cards with high balances and no way to make the monthly 
payments.

A single late payment will snowball into bigger problems 

very quickly; it affects your credit score, incurs a late-fee 
charge, and adds finance charges to your bill. Unless you 
have absolute proof that the late payment resulted because 
of things out of your control, the credit card issuer will not 
wipe out the fees, so don’t count on it.

Most credit card companies offer an automatic payment 

that draws from a checking or savings account.

What to do if you end up deep in debt
In the case that you do end up in severe debt, the first plan 

of attack is to use an online calculator to figure out how 

much and how long you need to make payments to get 
out of debt. You can find a reliable calculator online, and a 
link to one will be included at the end of this chapter. The 
calculator will help to put into perspective just how much 
you are paying in interest on top of your debt and will be a 
real eye opener. 

At all costs, you want to avoid bankruptcy. It tarnishes 

your credit report for at least seven years, and in most 
cases you won’t be able to get rid of all of your debt anyway. 
There are many alternatives to declaring bankruptcy, such 
as setting up a repayment plan with the creditor. Many are 
willing to negotiate a reasonable payment schedule if you set 
a goal for when you plan to be debt-free and you make the 
payments on time.

Owning a credit card can be a real lifesaver if you find 
yourself in a pinch, but just remember not to rely on them 
or spend beyond what you can reasonably pay back. Credit 
card companies are in the business of issuing credit cards, 
but you need to research the rates, penalties, and benefits 
of the credit card before you sign the first application that 
comes your way.

G218Employment

What types of employment  
can I accept at age 18?
When you turn 18, you may work in almost any 

occupation. However, the protections of Montana’s 

child labor laws no longer apply to you. Therefore, you 
may be asked to work unusual hours that could 
interfere with your schooling. You are also able 
to obtain employment in fields that involve 
hazardous tasks such as the handling of 
explosives, use of power-driven cutting 
machinery, logging, mining, roofing, 
and meat processing.

It is important to have a realistic 

understanding of your skills and 
physical abilities and be aware of ways 
you can be taken advantage of, because 
the law will no longer prevent you from 
performing dangerous work. MCA §41-2-
107.

Do I have to be paid at least “minimum 
wage”?
Yes, under Montana law, unless you are a farm worker, 

you have to be paid the legal minimum wage for each 
hour you work. MCA §39-3-404. The minimum wage 
in Montana as of January 2013 is $7.80 an hour. 
It will rise to $7.90 as of 1/1/2014. However, 
there are some exceptions to this law, 

During your 
initial probationary 
period (typically six months), you 
may be fired for any reason or for no 
reason, as long as the reason does not 
constitute illegal discrimination on the 
basis of sex, marital status, age, physi-
cal or mental disability, race, creed, 
religion, color, or national 
origin.

particularly for apprenticeships and other 

types of job-training programs. The 
types of employment excluded from the 
standard minimum wage are listed at 
MCA §39-3-406.

When do I have to be paid 
overtime?
You must be paid overtime whenever 

you work more than 40 hours in a 
single week. Overtime is to be paid at a rate 

Can I work in an establishment  
that sells alcohol?
Even though you cannot purchase or consume alcohol 

until you are 21, you may be employed as a bartender, 

waiter, or waitress whose duty is to serve customers 
purchasing alcoholic beverages. MCA §39-2-306.

What does my employer have  
the right to expect of me?
You must use “ordinary care and diligence” in performing 

your job. You must also substantially comply with 
all job-related directions of your employer, except when 
it is impossible, unlawful, or would impose “new and 
unreasonable” burdens (as defined by the general public, 
not by your own opinion) upon you. You are also expected 
to exercise a reasonable degree of skill and use such skill as 
you possess, to the best of your ability, to perform the job 
required. MCA §39-402, -404 & -406.

of 1½  times your usual hourly wage. MCA §39-3-
405. Some exceptions to the usual standard for overtime 
compensation, are listed at MCA §39-3-406. Some 
occupations (like bus drivers or miners) have limits on how 
many hours can be worked, usually for safety reasons. See 
MCA Title 39, chapter 4 for details. 

How often must I be paid?
If no other period of time is specified, you are to be paid 

semimonthly (twice a month, approximately every two 
weeks). You must be paid within 10 days of the end of your 
pay period. MCA §39-3-204.

Can I be fired for any reason?
During your initial probationary period (typically six 

months), you may be fired for any reason or for no 
reason, as long as the reason does not constitute illegal 
discrimination on the basis of sex, marital status, age, 
physical or mental disability, race, creed, religion, color, or 
national origin. MCA §39-2-904,49-2-303.

After your initial probationary period (which could be less 
than six months or up to a year if the employer has a specific 

13

G218policy), you can only be fired for “good cause.” MCA §39-
2-904. “Good cause” means reasonable job-related grounds 
for dismissal based on a failure to satisfactorily perform 
job duties, disruption of the employer’s operation, or other 
legitimate business reason. MCA §39-2-903.

Do I have to be provided breaks or 
vacation time?
Although breaks or rest periods are common in the 

industry, an employer has no obligation to provide such 
breaks. If your employer does give you a break or rest period 
of less than 30 minutes, the time must be paid. An employer 
also has no obligation to give you a meal break. However, 
if your employer does give you a meal break, the break is 
only unpaid (i.e. you clock out) if the break is 30 minutes 
or longer and you must be completely relieved from your 
job duties. Admin. R. Mont. 24.16.1006. Employers are not 
required to provide vacation time or paid holidays.

Can I be drug tested on the job?
Yes, but the employer must follow a very detailed set of 

guidelines, and make a written copy of their policies and 

procedures available to you. All drug testing is to be at the 
employer’s expense. MCA §39-2-207.

Can my employer make me take a lie 
detector test?

No. See MCA §39-2-304.

What is worker’s compensation?
“Work comp” is insurance that will cover your 

medical expenses if you are injured or develop an 
occupational disease while on the job. It is not the same as 
a general health insurance policy. Work comp also provides 
payment for wages lost because you were injured on the job.

Work comp does not cover your medical expenses if you 

get sick or are injured off the job. You cannot be fired for 
filing a worker’s compensation claim and your employer 
cannot prohibit you from filing. MCA §39-71-317.

A few specific occupations are not required to carry 
worker’s compensation insurance, and they are listed at 
MCA §39-71-401. If you are supposed to be covered by work 
comp and are injured on the job, but your employer does 
not carry a policy, the State of Montana has a special fund to 
help cover your injuries. MCA§39-71-501 & -503.

What is an “independent contractor”?
Put simply, an independent contractor is someone who is 

self-employed. For example, you have set up your own 
business to design web pages for others. A person who hires 
an independent contractor does not have to carry work 
comp on that person. MCA §39-71-417. However, to be an 
independent contractor, you must apply for an independent-
contractor exemption certificate and meet certain criteria. 
Without one, you are usually considered an employee of the 
person hiring you.

This is an area where many employers are tempted to not 
follow the law. You may be told that you are an “independent 
contractor” for both tax and work comp purposes even if 
your employer dictates the conditions of your employment, 
such as the hours you work, the methods by which you 
complete tasks, and so on. However, this violates Montana 
law.

What is unemployment insurance and 
how do I get it?
Unemployment insurance is a partial compensation for 

your wages that you may receive if you are laid off from 

a job through no fault of your own. It does not cover you if 
you quit, are fired for certain misconduct, or cannot work 
due to illness. If your employer lays you off, you may apply 
to the Unemployment Insurance Division at  
http://app.mt.gov/ui4u/index.

What is sexual harassment?
It is a form of unlawful discrimination prohibited by 

federal and state law. In general, it is unwelcome sexual 
behavior on the part of a supervisor, co-worker, or customer. 
Such conduct could be sexual comments, pressure for sexual 
favors, inappropriate touching, or even a sexual assault. Or 
it might be one employee subjecting another to unwelcome 
sexual jokes or degrading posters of women or men. MCA 
Title 49.

Can I be fired for getting pregnant or 
having a child?
Absolutely not. An employer cannot terminate an 

employee for getting pregnant, cannot refuse to grant a 
reasonable period of maternity leave, and cannot force you 
to take maternity leave for an unreasonable period of time. 
As a general rule, when you return to work, you must be 
reinstated to your original job or to an equivalent position 
with equivalent pay and accumulated seniority. MCA §49-2-

14

G218310 & -311.

discrimination in the workplace?

Can my employer deduct anything from 
my paycheck?
Yes, but only for certain purposes. For example, your 

employer could deduct funds for the following:

• 

State and federal income tax.

•  Union dues.

•  Any losses caused by your dishonesty, willful 

misconduct, or gross negligence. 

• 

Specific deductions for which you previously gave 
written authorization to the employer to make.

What is FICA?
The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), 

commonly called Social Security, is a payroll tax that 
provides retirement, disability, and death benefits to workers. 
The employer pays half of the premium and you pay the 
other half.

Do I need a Social Security number to 
get employment?
Yes, unless you are a legal resident who is not a U.S. 

citizen, in which case you need an Individual Taxpayer 

Identification Number (ITIN). Your employer is required 
to report your wages to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
— the agency that collects federal taxes from taxpayers. The 
IRS, in turn, uses your Social Security number or ITIN to 
process your federal tax payment. For more information, 
check with your local Social Security office or go to www.ssa.
gov. Or you could call 1-800-772-1213.

Taxes

How do my tax obligations change when 
I turn 18?
You are obligated to pay state and federal income tax 

regardless of age, even when you were a child, if you 
have taxable income. Your family may have handled this 
responsibility for you in the past. However, once you are 18, 
you are responsible for your own taxes. The penalties for not 
paying taxes (which could include fines and even jail time) 
become your responsibility. If you have income, it is best to 
assume that you will need to file tax returns.

How do I file tax returns?
You can download forms from the Internet, or purchase 

special computer software that helps you through the 
process. You can also obtain tax forms at your local public 
library, and free assistance in filling out tax returns is usually 

offered in most communities. There are booklets containing 
detailed step-by-step directions that come with these forms. 
For most people between the ages of 18 and 21, filing a 
return is fairly uncomplicated.

How do I know how much tax I owe?
In most cases, if you have a job, your employer will 

withhold taxes from each paycheck. At the end of the year, 

you will get a form from your employer called a W-2 that 
shows how much tax was withheld. In many cases, especially 
if you work only part-time, you will have had more tax 
withheld than you actually need to pay and are eligible for 
a tax refund at the end of the year – but only if you file a tax 
return with the IRS and with the Montana Department of 
Revenue. 

In some cases, you will have income from other sources. 
If you worked for yourself and were paid by your customers 
instead of by an employer, you will have to track your own 

15

G218income and pay taxes on it. If you were an independent 
contractor, that is, you worked for yourself, and no one 
withheld taxes from your earnings, the people for whom 
you did work may send you a Form 1099 instead of a W-2 
(See Employment section for a more detailed definition of 
an independent contractor). A 1099 tells the IRS how much 
money they paid to you. The IRS will cross check these 
forms, and you are responsible for paying your own taxes on 
income where there was no withholding.

My parents are still claiming me as a 
dependent, does that change my taxes?
Even before you turned 18, you paid taxes on any income 

you earned, and could file a tax return at the end of 
the year if you owed additional taxes or were entitled to 
a refund. However, your parent(s) or legal guardian(s) 
probably claimed you as a dependent and thus were able to 
obtain a small tax deduction by doing so. As an adult, when 
you file a tax return, you may claim a type of tax deduction 
called a personal exemption for yourself, but only if no one 
else claims you as a dependent. Even if you are over 18, 
you might still be claimed as a dependent on a parent’s or 
guardian’s tax returns. If you are claimed, you will need to 
avoid making the personal exemption claim.

IRS Publication 501 explains this in more detail. It is 

available on the internet at: http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/
p501.pdf.

Where can I get help?
Most people who rent a home and only have earned 

income from a job and perhaps a small savings 
account can do their own taxes. However, if you have 
questions about taxes, you may have to pay for professional 
help.

Attorneys and certified public accountants (CPAs) have the 

highest qualifications and can provide you with specialized 
expertise. They can also refer you to free resources if your 
finances are limited. If you own a home or other valuable 
property, have stock in a company, run your own business, 
inherited a large sum of money, or otherwise have a 
complicated tax situation, you should seek professional 
assistance.

Housing

Buying A House
Unless you have several hundred thousand dollars saved 

up, you will most likely need to take out a mortgage 

loan from a bank, a mortgage company, or some other 
lender to purchase a home. Lenders will require you to sign 
a promissory note. The promissory note legally requires you 
to pay the loan back.

When purchasing a home, the lender will require a 
mortgage on the property. Ask your lender about their 
mortgage options and decide which one will work best 
for you. The mortgage is the lender’s way of ensuring you 
continue to make your payments on the loan. Missed 
payments may result in the lender foreclosing on your 
property – that is, taking the property away from you. 

Now, on to house-hunting…

If you choose to use a real estate agent to show you homes, 
remember that the agent represents and is paid by the seller 

of the home. You may want to hire your own buyer’s agent 
to make sure your interests are represented fairly. Real estate 
agents only get paid when a sale is completed, so a buyer’s 
agent is probably a good idea if you can afford it.

What must the seller tell you about the 
home?
So, you have a loan, a buyer’s agent, and you have found 

what you think might be the home of your dreams. There 

are several things you should do before drafting a Purchase 
Agreement. First, a seller of a home in Montana is required 
by law to disclose all pertinent facts known to the seller 
about the home and should disclose any known defects. Ask 
not only the seller’s real estate agent, but the seller himself 
about the home. Do not be afraid to be specific. Ask if the 
home has been remodeled or added on to. Ask about the 
plumbing, heating, and electrical systems in the home. Ask 
if the seller has had any problems at all with any part of the 

16

G218property. Even if you forget to ask, the seller is required 
to fill out a disclosure statement and if he knows of any 
problems, he must list them on the disclosure. 

What if the seller says he does not know of any problems 
with the home or the property? You can choose to take his 
word for it, or you can hire an independent home inspection 
service to check the place out for you. If you can afford an 
inspection service, it may save you from extensive repair 
costs to your new home in the future.

The Purchase and Sale Agreement
When you are satisfied that the home you wish to 

purchase is in good condition, you will need a 

Purchase and Sale Agreement. This Agreement should 
contain at least the following: buyers’ and sellers’ names 
and addresses; purchase price; mortgage or financing 
information of buyer; legal description of the property; 
assurance of good title to the property; condition of the 
property at closing; the expenses and how they will be 
divided; method of handling escrow; seller’s statement 
about the condition of the property; closing date; date of 
buyer’s possession; closing costs statement; sales agent and 
commission due; and the parties’ signatures. Reviewing the 
agreement with a real estate attorney before closing can be 
helpful if you can afford to pay for it.

Renting a property
Before you decide to rent an apartment, house, or any 

piece of property, you need to be aware of your rights 
and responsibilities as a tenant. You also need to know the 
rights and responsibilities of your landlord. Most landlords 
require you to sign a written rental agreement or lease before 
allowing you to move in, but verbal rental agreements can be 
just as valid. Read over the written agreement or review the 
terms of your verbal agreement with your landlord carefully. 
In order to be valid, the terms of the lease must comply 
with Montana law. Your landlord cannot require you to be 
responsible for things the law says he must do.

What are your responsibilities toward 
your rental home?
As a tenant, you will be required to keep your rental 

property in a reasonably clean and safe condition. 
This includes disposing of waste appropriately, keeping 
plumbing fixtures clean, and using the facilities provided 
by the landlord in a reasonable manner. Not only are you 
responsible for your own behavior, but you and your guests 
are expected not to unnecessarily disturb your neighbors. 
You and your guests should not damage, deface, impair, 

destroy, or remove any part of the property. The law 
prohibits you and your guests from engaging in any activity 
that may result in damage to the property or injury to your 
neighbors.

Tenants are specifically prohibited from manufacturing 
illegal drugs, operating an unlawful clandestine laboratory, 
and participating in gang activity within a rental property. 
If you violate the above conditions, your landlord may 
terminate your rental agreement by providing you with 
written notice of the specific reasons for termination at least 
three days prior to termination of the agreement. 

Your landlord is required to do whatever is necessary to 

keep the rental property in a fit and habitable condition. 
The landlord is responsible for keeping any common 
areas on the premises clean and safe. The upkeep of the 
electrical, heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and existing 
appliances are all the landlord’s responsibility. The landlord 
must have an approved smoke detector in good working 
order in each unit and must supply hot water and heat at all 
times between Oct. 1 and May 1.

Can you get out of a rental agreement 
early?
If for some reason you decide to terminate your rental 

agreement before the term of your lease has expired, you 
may be liable to the landlord for the rent to the end of the 
term. You might also have to pay any actual damages the 
landlord suffered because of your decision to break the 
rental agreement. To avoid having to pay, you might try 
talking to your landlord and explaining why you need to 
terminate the rental agreement early. If you do not have 
a rental agreement and you pay rent weekly, you or the 
landlord can terminate the tenancy by providing the other 
with written notice at least 7 days before the termination 
date. If you pay rent monthly and do not have a rental 
agreement, the written notice of termination must be 
provided to the other party at least 30 days, prior to the date 
of termination.

What happens to the security deposit?
After you or your landlord terminates the rental 

agreement, the law outlines specific procedures for the 

return or retention of the security deposit. An inspection 
of the premises must be performed either by the landlord 
and tenant together, or the landlord himself. Following the 
inspection, the landlord must provide a written notice of any 
cleaning that still needs to be done to restore the unit to its 
original condition. 

Your landlord must allow you 24 hours to perform the 

17

G218additional cleaning.  If there is no need for additional 
cleaning and no other reason to hold the security deposit, 
your landlord must return the full amount to you within 10 
days. After allowing you to clean, the landlord has 30 days to 
send you an itemized list of any deductions from the security 
deposit and return the remaining amount.

What if the landlord wants to evict you?
When the landlord terminates the rental agreement and 

you refuse to leave, the landlord may file an action 

for possession of the premises. This is the beginning of the 
eviction process in Montana. The landlord must serve you 
with a copy of the action for possession. Regardless of the 
circumstances, you should always file an answer with the 
court in order to avoid a default judgment against you. You 
have 10 days from the date you are served with the petition 
to file your answer. The court must hear the case within 
20 days of your first appearance or the answer date on the 

summons. The court will issue a ruling on the case within 5 
days of the hearing.

Without a judgment in court, your landlord is not 
permitted to physically remove you from the premises, 
make threats, change the locks, or cut off services to the 
unit. Your landlord may be liable for damages in court for 
these behaviors. If the court issues a judgment in favor of the 
landlord, you must move out and pay any damages awarded 
by the court.

Sexual Relationships

offender is 3 or more years older than the victim, an act 
charged as sexual assault is a felony with a penalty of 4 years 
to life in prison and a fine of $50,000. MCA §45-5-502. If 
you are over 18, then anyone under the age of consent is 3 
years younger than you.

If the victim is under the age of 16 and the offender is 4 
or more years older, an act of sexual intercourse without 
consent is a felony and also has a penalty of 4 years to life in 
prison and a fine of $50,000. MCA §45-5-503. Further, when 
the victim is under age 14, you cannot claim as a defense you 
didn’t know the victim was underage.

Sixteen- and 17-year-olds can consent to sexual acts, but a 
person may be charged with a crime if he engages in a sexual 
act of any type while the other party, regardless of age, is 
incapacitated by drugs or alcohol and unable to give consent. 
Furthermore, if someone over 18 provided the drugs or 
alcohol to someone underage, they could also be charged 
with endangering the welfare of children and assorted 
crimes related to unlawful transactions with children.

Age of consent and rape laws
Anyone under the age of 16 is considered legally 

incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse or any 
other type of sexual contact or conduct. MCA §45-5-501, 
45-2-101, 45-5-625. The law applies to people who are under 
18 as well as those over 18, and the age gap between the two 
parties does not matter. 

Therefore, having sexual intercourse with someone under 

the age of 16 can be charged as sexual intercourse without 
consent (commonly known as rape), no matter how old you 
are, and even if they tell you that they consent.

Sexual intercourse is very broadly defined and includes 

penetration of almost any body orifice of one person by 
almost any body part of another person – or a foreign object 
manipulated by another to cause bodily injury or humiliate, 
harass, degrade, or cause sexual arousal. Any penetration, 
however slight, is sufficient. MCA §45-2-101. 

Other types of sexual conduct or contact with someone 
under age 16, no matter how old you are and even if they 
say they consent, may be charged as sexual assault or sexual 
abuse of children. MCA §45-5-502, 45-5-503, 45-5-625.

 Further, if the victim is under the age of 16 and the 

18

G218How does the law protect me if I am of 
legal age?
Friendship, dating, or even marital status do not convey an 

invitation to sexual intercourse. Date or no date, it is rape 

if one of you says “no.” 

Further, if you have been subjected to a sexual act without 

your consent, you should seek help from your local rape 
crisis hotline, domestic violence shelter, police, or hospital.

Marriage and Families

What is the age of consent to marriage 
in Montana?
No one under the age of 16 can get married in Montana. 

People who are 16 or 17 can only get married with 

parental permission or approval from a judge. MCA§40-3-
402(1)(c).

How do I get married in Montana?
You have to get a marriage certificate at the county 

courthouse and present proof of age. Women must 
also provide a medical certificate that states that they have 
had a blood test for immunity from rubella (also known as 
German measles), a disease that can harm an unborn child 
in the womb if the mother contracts it during pregnancy. 
MCA §40-1-203. 

You may have the marriage ceremony performed by a 
minister of any religious denomination, a judge, or any 
public official whose powers include solemnization of 
marriages. MCA §40-1-301.

  Montana also recognizes common-law marriages. 

MCA §40-1-403. There is no specific definition of a 
common-law marriage other than a man and woman 
holding themselves out to the public as husband and wife. 
This can be done with one instance, i.e., signing into a motel 
as Mr. and Mrs., or by a series of such “displays.” There is no 
legal requirement that it take place over a period of time. The 
circumstances of a common-law marriage are determined 
on a fact basis with each case. A common-law marriage 
should not be confused with a declaration of marriage and is 

a written statement declaring the marriage of the parties and 
must conform to the statute. MCA §40-1-323 and 324.

What types of marriages are prohibited 
in Montana?
Marriages between brothers and sisters or half-brothers 

and half-sisters, first cousins, those between an 

uncle and a niece or between an aunt and a nephew, and 
marriages between persons of the same sex are not allowed 
in Montana. You cannot be married to someone who is 
married to someone else until there has been a formal 
dissolution of the previous marriage (commonly known as a 
divorce). MCA §40-1-401.

Does my spouse have a duty to support 
me?
Both spouses are obligated to provide for the support of 

the other and for any minor children (below the age of 

18). MCA §40-2-102.

I am in a gay/lesbian (GLBT) 
relationship. Is that illegal?
No. Although, until recently Montana Code contained 

an entry that prohibited “deviate sexual conduct.” 
Regardless of the law on the books, Montana Supreme Court 
decision Gryczan v. Montana (1997) protected consenting 
acts in the privacy of one’s home. The 2013 Montana 
Legislature passed Senate Bill 107, and on April 18, 2013, 

19

G218Gov. Steve Bullock signed the bill into law, which struck the 
outdated language from Montana Code.

as well as women. Remember, NO ONE has the right to hurt 
you.

You may obtain additional legal protection for yourself 
and your partner – such as a right of visitation should one 
of you be hospitalized, or a power of attorney if one of you 
is incapacitated – by consulting with a private attorney. 
Gay/lesbian partners can also make provision for 
their partner in wills and other estate planning 
devices to protect their financial interest. 
Sample documents for legal planning for 
GLBT couples in Montana are available at: 
http://www.gaymontana.org/family/estate.
html. 

The Human Rights Campaign can 
provide you with further assistance and 
referrals to resources in Montana.  
http://www.hrc.org/issues/marriage. 

You may also provide for a partner in a 

testamentary device such as a will to ensure that 
they will not be left out financially in the event of their 
partner’s death.

What is domestic violence?
Partner and family-member assault is against the law. 

MCA §45-5-206. It occurs whenever someone causes 

bodily injury to a partner or family member or causes 
reasonable fear of bodily injury.

Domestic violence can also include stalking, which is 

following someone around after being told not to, harassing, 
threatening, or intimidating someone in person or by mail, 
or by any electronic communication (including telephone 
and e-mail). MCA §45-5-220. 

Domestic violence is abuse that cuts across all cultures, 
ethnic backgrounds, education levels, and income brackets. 
It impacts gay and lesbian people as often as heterosexuals. 
It happens to teenagers as well as senior citizens, and to men 

What resources are available to me if I 
am in an abusive relationship?

Physical or 
psychological violence 
against another person, spouse, 
partner, or child is not acceptable 
and should be reported. It requires 
fortitude and courage on the 
part of the victim. 

Most Montana communities have a shelter 

or support system for people who are 
in need of help. You may contact your local 
police department or hospital. If you have 
been abused, you need to call the police 
immediately, seek hospital treatment 
and keep a record of injuries and, when 
possible, the names of witnesses, police 
officers, and medical attendants. Also 
keep copies of all medical reports and take 
pictures of any physical evidence of abuse.

In many cities, such as Missoula, the YWCA 

or a women’s resource center can either provide 
assistance or be able to direct you and any children 

to a safe location and other resources available in your 
community. Physical or psychological violence against 
another person, spouse, partner, or child is not acceptable 
and should be reported. It requires fortitude and courage on 
the part of the victim. A child who witnesses or experiences 
abusive behavior becomes impacted and has an independent 
right of protection even separate from the adults.

Pregnancy and Parenting

Is abortion legal in Montana?
Yes. You must be informed of the medical risks associated 

with the procedure and sign a consent form. MCA §50-

20-104, 106. Parental notice or judicial waiver is required 

for people under 18 or those who have been declared 
incompetent by a court. MCA §50-20-240, 205, 212. If you 
are over 18, there is no notice requirement. The father of the 
child does not have to be notified.

20

G218If I have a child, do I have to reveal the 
identity of the child’s father?
If you seek child support enforcement, apply for public 

assistance, or otherwise wish to obtain help supporting 

your child, you usually will be required to identify the 
child’s father. If you put the child up for adoption, the state 
has an obligation to try to locate and notify the father of 
the child prior to terminating the parental rights of either 
or both birth parents. You may be subject to civil or 
criminal penalties if you fraudulently conceal 
information.

bureau of the Department of Public Health & Human 
Services. If registered, he will receive notice if the child is to 
be placed for adoption. Beyond that, it is the responsibility 
of the father to assert any parental rights. MCA §42-2-230.

A father may also bring a civil action to determine his 

parental rights and duties. MCA §40-6-101 et seq. In 
addition to the father, if there is no presumed father, a 
number of other persons may institute such an action. MCA 
§40-6-107(2).

Reporting child abuse or 

neglect

Both parents are responsible 
for support and education of the 
child until it is 18. MCA §40-6-211. If 
one of you fails to provide required sup-
port, the State of Montana Child Support 
Enforcement division or the other par-
ent can take the case to court.

If you have reasonable cause to 

suspect that a child has been abused 
or neglected, you may call the State of 
Montana’s 24-hour child abuse hotline 
at: 1-866-820-5437 (KIDS). You may 
also contact the Department of Health 
and Human Services Child Services 
Division, the county attorney, or local 
law enforcement offices, police, and 

sheriff.

However, if you are a survivor of 
domestic violence, the father of your 
child does not need to know where 
you are. Your personal information 
and location will be protected if you 
request it.

If my girlfriend gets 
pregnant and we are 
not married, do I have to 
support the child?
Yes. Both parents are responsible for support and 

education of the child until it is 18. MCA §40-6-211. 
If one of you fails to provide required support, the State of 
Montana Child Support Enforcement division or the other 
parent can take the case to court. A judge can also order a 
portion of your wages to be deducted from your paycheck 
and used for child support payments. MCA Title 40, Chapter 
5.

Does an unmarried father have any 
parental rights?
Under Montana law, anyone who engages in an act of 

sexual intercourse with a person of the opposite sex is 
presumed to be aware that a pregnancy could result. MCA 
§42-2-204. A person named on a child’s birth certificate 
or the husband of the child’s mother is presumed to be the 
father of the child unless proven otherwise by paternity 
testing and court action. Any party may bring an action for 
the determination of paternity or the existence of a father-
child relationship. MCA §40-6-105, 107. 

A father who wishes to preserve his parental rights in the 
event that a child is born may register with the putative (or 
supposed) father registry that is part of the vital statistics 

What is the Newborn Safe 

Haven law?

The Montana Safe Haven Newborn Protection Act, 

sometimes called a “baby drop-off law,” is a law that 
helps prevent mothers who cannot care for their infants 
from abandoning an unwanted newborns in dumpsters, 
cardboard boxes, or other unsafe locations. A newborn’s 
parent (or other individual with legal custody) can now 
voluntarily surrender the infant to any “emergency services 
provider” and not risk prosecution for child abuse or 
abandonment. MCA Title 40, Chapter 6. A “newborn” 
is a child who reasonably appears to be no more than 30 
days old. An emergency services provider is a uniformed 
or otherwise identifiable employee of a fire department, 
hospital, or law enforcement agency when the individual 
is on duty inside the fire department, hospital, or law 
enforcement agency; or any law enforcement officer who is 
in uniform or is otherwise identifiable. MCA §40-6-402.

Can my parental rights ever be taken 
away?
Yes. Montana law has determined that it is the policy of 

the state of Montana to provide for the protection of 
children whose health and welfare are or may be at risk. 

21

G218MCA §40-3-101. In these instances, the state of Montana 
has the authority to step in and assume a parental role 
for the welfare of the child. This becomes a separate legal 
proceeding and is of a “quasi” criminal nature. Some of the 
reasons you could lose your parental rights include:

•  Abandonment.

• 

Severe abuse (which includes but is not limited to 

abandonment, torture, chronic abuse, sexual abuse, or 
chronic, severe neglect of a child. MCA §41-3-423.)

•  Repeated incidents of abuse resulting in a court 
ordered treatment plan, and failure to comply.

•  Conduct or condition of the parents rendering them 
unfit that is unlikely to change within a reasonable 
time.  MCA §41-3-609.

Divorce

How and why you can get divorced
Only one person in a relationship has to believe that the 

union is irreparably damaged to obtain a divorce. There 

are a few ways to go about getting a divorce.

Option of mediation
Mediators cost anywhere from $60 to $250 an hour. The 

amount of time it takes to get through a mediation 
depends entirely on your willingness to reach settlement. 

Divorce in Montana is called “Dissolution of 

Marriage.” This is what the court documents 
you are looking for will say. 

The first, and most highly 

recommended, way to get divorced is 
to hire a private attorney. This will cost 
quite a bit of money with fees ranging 
from perhaps less than $1000 to fees 
without any upper limit, plus any costs. 
It is much cheaper and easier to get 
married in most cases than it is to get 
divorced! The details of each marriage 
impact the complexity and expense of a 
dissolution with such factors as length of 
marriage, assets, debts, children, and a large 
variety of factors with each one in scrutiny.

In the event that you 
do not reach an amicable 
settlement, the district court has 
the authority and ability to divide and 
distribute all assets and obligations of 
the marriage as well as determine the 
parenting rights and duties of each 
parent. 

The average divorce mediation takes about six hours, 
but many take much longer. One should go into 
mediation with an open mind, ready and 
willing to give and take with the spouse 

partner. 

Mediators will not fill out court 
paperwork for you, so if you are using 
mediation to help you through a pro 
se divorce, you should go through 
the Parenting Plan and Debt & Asset 
division paperwork FIRST, then go to 
the mediator to help you work out the 
things you can’t agree on. The courts have 

a list of mediators on hand for referrals.

The second way to get divorced is pro se, meaning 
representing yourself without hiring a lawyer. In order 
to have a pro se divorce, the partners should agree 
on EVERYTHING (division of debts and assets, who 
will have the children when, etc.) You can go to www.
MontanaLawHelp.org and print out the divorce packet if 
you want to do things pro se. Be ready though, the packet is 
over 100 pages long. It includes instructions on how to fill 
the form out and how to file it with the local district court 
clerks. You can also get these forms at some court clerks’ 
offices.

If you are unable to pay the filing fees you may file a 
petition of inability to pay costs and be relieved of that 
obligation.

What are your obligations to 
your spouse (or children) after the 

divorce?
This depends entirely on the settlement you reach with 

your spouse or the judgment issued by the court. In 
the event that you do not reach an amicable settlement, the 
district court has the authority and ability to divide and 
distribute all assets and obligations of the marriage as well as 
determine the parenting rights and duties of each parent. 

In contested cases, the district court has the authority to 
appoint a Guardian ad Litem to represent the interests of any 
child(ren) of the parties. The district court in either case has 
continuing jurisdiction over that dissolution proceeding in 
the event that issues arise after the Decree of Dissolution has 

22

G218been entered. 

Normally, a spouse will have to either pay a part of the 

children’s expenses or send money to the other parent 
for said expenses (child support). You will also have an 
obligation to visit the children at times specified in the 
Parenting Plan. You might also have to pay maintenance 
(alimony) to a spouse who has been living off of your 
paycheck for a long time. Finally, you might be responsible 
for taking the kids to school, or taking them to the doctor, or 
buying them clothing, or some other specific parenting duty.

The most important thing to remember is to follow your 
divorce paperwork. IT IS A COURT ORDER. If you do not, 
you can be charged with contempt of court, which could get 
you a $500 fine and 6 months in jail.

Child support must be determined according to the 

Montana Uniform Child Support Guidelines and may not be 

established outside those guidelines except in very limited 
circumstances. MCA §40-4-204. Child support is always 
subject to review within the provisions of the law and the 
Child Support Enforcement Division of the Department of 
Health and Human Services will assist you in determining 
and collecting child support.

Parenting, child support, maintenance, determination, and 

distribution of marital assets and obligations can become 
a very complex matter and require the assistance of a 
competent attorney familiar with this type of law.

Driving, and Driving  
Under the Influence

Driving is a privilege granted to you and regulated 

by the State of Montana. It is your responsibility 
and obligation to be a safe driver. Never drive under the 
influence of drugs or alcohol. (NOTE: People caught driving 
under the influence of drugs other than alcohol – marijuana 
or meth, for example – are subject to the same penalties as a 
DUI based on drinking.) 

Here are some important things you need to know.

when you first got your license. Their liability ends 

Are my parents still liable for accidents 
I get in after I turn 18?
Typically no, not even if they signed as your sponsor 
when you turn 18. 
Are all owners of a motor vehicle 
required to have insurance?
Yes. An owner of a motor vehicle that is registered and 

operated in Montana, and is used by the owner or by 

another with permission, has to have proof of financial 
responsibility or insurance. 

Insurance must provide for liability coverage of at least 
$25,000 per person and $50,000 for two or more persons 
because of bodily injury or death in any one accident; and 
$10,000 because of damage to the property of others in any 
one accident. 

Proof of responsibility or insurance is required – you 
should carry your proof-of-insurance coupon from the 
insurance company in your glove box, wallet or purse. The 
person operating the vehicle is the person responsible for 
making sure the vehicle is insured before driving the vehicle. 
This means that the driver will get a ticket for no insurance 
– not the owner. Penalties for not having insurance include 
fines from $250 to $500 and imprisonment up to 6 months 
and suspension of the car’s registration and your driver’s 
license. MCA §61-6-301.

What happens if I get stopped for drunk 
drinking?
A person of legal drinking age in Montana (21 years old) is 

inferred to be under the influence of alcohol (DUI) with 

a blood-alcohol level of .08. 

23

G218Without making an arrest, the officer might ask you to 
perform sobriety tests at the spot where he stopped you, 
or ask you to submit to a preliminary breathalyzer test to 
determine your blood-alcohol level. 

For a third or subsequent conviction, a fine of not less than 

$300 or more than $500, incarceration for not less than 24 
consecutive hours or more than 60 days, and suspension of 
driver’s license for 1 year. MCA §61-8-410.

If you are a driver in Montana, you have already given 
consent to a blood or breathalyzer test. You may refuse to 
submit to such a test, but if you refuse Montana law allows 
a peace officer to seize your driver’s license. The officer will 
issue a five-day temporary driving permit. Your license will 
then be subject to suspension or revocation. You have the 
right to appeal within 30 days and have a hearing in district 
court.

Proof of refusal to submit to a test by a person under 

arrest is admissible in any court action. If you do not request 
a hearing, or if after hearing the court determines that 
you are not entitled to a license, your driver’s license will 
be suspended for six months on the first refusal to take a 
breathalyzer test – and you will not receive a provisional 
license, meaning you can’t drive to work, school, or 
anywhere else. It’s no driving, period. MCA §61-8-402, 403, 
404

Can I only get a DUI while driving in 
my truck or car?
No. The term “vehicle” is loosely used to describe any 

vehicle that can be used for transportation on a public 

highway. The only exception is for bicycles.

What happens if I get a DUI when I’m 
under the age of 21?
If you have a blood-alcohol level of .08, you are subject 

to the full DUI penalties, including jail time (see section 

below), even if you are only 18. 

However, if you are under 21 years old, you can receive a 
“baby DUI” if your blood-alcohol level is only .02, equivalent 
of one alcoholic drink or less. 

The penalties for a “baby DUI” will be: For the first 

conviction, a fine of not less than $100 or more than $500 
and suspension of driver’s license for 90 days.

For a second conviction, a fine of not less than $200 or 

more than $500, incarceration of not more than 10 days, and 
suspension of driver’s license for 6 months.

What are the full DUI penalties at age 
21 or at .08 blood-alcohol level?
For the first offense, the penalty is jail time of 24 hours to 

6 months, except if a passenger is 16 years or younger, 
the penalty is jail time of 48 hours to 12 months. The fine 
for a first offense is not less than $300 or more than $1000, 
and if a passenger is 16 years or younger, not less than $600 
or more than $1200. Except for the initial 24 hours of the 
jail term, the imprisonment sentence may be suspended for 
a period of up to 1 year pending successful completion of 
court-ordered chemical dependency assessment, education, 
or treatment. 

For the second offense, a fine of not less than $600 or more 

than $1000, imprisonment of not less than 7 days or more 
than 6 months, with at least 48 consecutive hours in a county 
jail. Except for the initial 5 days of the imprisonment term, 
the imprisonment sentence may be suspended for a period 
of up to 1 year pending successful completion of a chemical 
dependency treatment program.

For the third offense, imprisonment of not less than 30 
days or more than 1 year with 48 consecutive hours in a 
county jail, a fine of not less than $1000 or more than $5000.

These penalties double if there are one or more passengers 

in the vehicle who are under age 16. MCA §61-8-714.

What happens if I get a fourth DUI or excessive alcohol 

concentration violation?

On conviction you are found guilty of a felony and shall be 
punished by imprisonment of 13 months with no suspension 
and no eligibility for parole. And the fines and other 
penalties become much stiffer.

What happens to my insurance rates if 
I’m convicted of a DUI?
If you are convicted of DUI or any other serious driving 

infraction, an insurance company is likely to cancel your 
auto insurance policy, or at least sharply increase the amount 
you pay for the policy.

G218Possession of Alcohol

If you are caught drinking 
underage you will be charged with a 
misdemeanor offense. If you are caught 
attempting to purchase alcohol, you 
also will be charged, even if you didn’t 
succeed in obtaining it. 

What is the current legal drinking age 
in Montana?
Montana’s Constitution allows the establishment of the 

legal age for purchasing, consuming, or possessing 
alcoholic beverages. In 1987, Montana’s legal drinking age 
changed from 19 to 21. MCA §45-5-624.

Are there any exceptions to 
this?
Yes. The only exception to the 

consumption rule in Montana is 

if your parents, a religious official, 
or medical professional provide you 
non-intoxicating quantities of alcohol 
for religious or medicinal purposes. 
A “non-intoxicating quantity” is 
defined as a blood alcohol level of .05 
or less. However, the blood alcohol level 
for operating a motor vehicle when you 
are under the age of 21 is .02. That equates 
to virtually any alcohol in your system, in an 
intoxicating quantity or not.

May the state change the drinking age?
Yes. Montana’s Constitution allows the establishment of 

the legal age for purchasing, consuming, or possessing 

alcoholic beverages. Buying beer or liquor is considered 
a privilege rather than a right, so a state may change the 
drinking age. 

What are some examples of underage 
drinking violations?

•  Being in possession of alcoholic beverages.

•  Obtaining or attempting to obtain alcoholic beverages.

•  Being on the premises of a liquor-serving 

establishment, like a bar or saloon, without a parent, 
guardian, or spouse who is of legal drinking age.

•  Falsely representing age to obtain alcoholic beverages.

•  Carrying, obtaining, making, altering, duplicating, or 

presenting a false identification card.

•  Operating a vehicle, motorboat, sailboat, water skis, 

surfboard, or similar device while under the influence 
of alcohol.

What will likely happen if I’m 
arrested for a drinking 

violation?
If you are caught drinking underage 

you will be charged with a 

misdemeanor offense. If you are 
caught attempting to purchase alcohol, 
you also will be charged, even if you 
didn’t succeed in obtaining it. Your 
sentence will vary depending on your 
circumstances, but you almost always 
will have to perform community service, 
take a substance abuse information course, 

and pay a minimum fine. 

In some cases, you might be ordered to obtain a 

chemical dependency evaluation and you can also lose your 
driver’s license. Section reference: MCA §61-8-410, 45-5-
624, 16-6-305.

Are there situations where someone 
under 21 can be on the premises of an 
establishment that sells alcohol?
Yes. You may be on the premises if you are accompanied 

by a parent, a guardian, or your spouse and provided 
that this person is above the age of 21. You also must be at 
the premises with the intent of buying food or nonalcoholic 
beverages.

There also is an exception if you are 18 and you are 
employed at a location that is licensed to serve alcohol.

There are also a number of locations that are provided 
general exceptions; such as restaurants, hotels, bowling 
alleys, public athletic fields, or public buildings.

25

G218Drug Laws

Once you turn 18, you are considered an adult under 

state and federal law. Except for the possession and 
consumption of alcoholic beverages, you have all of the 
responsibilities and benefits of adulthood. Further, if you 
violate state or federal criminal laws, including drug laws, 
you will be prosecuted as an adult. 

A person convicted of distribution of dangerous drugs 
faces a wide range of potential penalties, depending how a 
drug is listed in Montana law. The penalties range from not 
less than one year to more than life in the state prison. In 
addition, an individual is also subject to a fine of not more 

than $50,000.

This section attempts to provide an overview 

of the potential penalties to which you may 
be subject should you be convicted of 
violating the drug laws of the state of 
Montana. Not covered are the potential 
penalties for the violation of federal 
drug laws. You should understand 
that punishments under federal drug 
laws are significantly more severe than 
Montana drug laws.

Under 
state law, it is not 
uncommon for first-time drug 
offenders to receive a suspended 
sentence, or a deferred imposition of 
sentence. Such is not the case in the fed-
eral system. If you are convicted of a drug 
crime in federal court, you most likely 
will go to prison. Further, there is 
no parole in the federal 
system.

Also, if an individual has one or more prior 
convictions for criminal distribution of 
certain dangerous drugs, the potential 

penalties increase.

Moreover, as an adult, if you are 
convicted of distributing certain types 
of dangerous drugs to a minor, the law 
provides for sentences of not less than 
two years and up to life in state prison. 
For example, if you are convicted of 
distributing methamphetamine to a 
17-year-old, and you have a prior drug 
distribution conviction, the law provides for 

a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years.

Should you be convicted of a federal 
drug offense, even if you are a first-time 
offender, you cannot expect to be able to 
enter into some type of pretrial diversion 
program. Under state law, it is not uncommon 
for first-time drug offenders to receive a suspended 
sentence, or a deferred imposition of sentence. Such is not 
the case in the federal system. If you are convicted of a drug 
crime in federal court, you most likely will go to prison. 
Further, there is no parole in the federal system. In the 
federal system, if you do the crime, you will do the time.

This being said, the following provides a synopsis of the 
potential penalties for violation of drug laws of the state of 
Montana.

Criminal distribution of dangerous 
drugs
Under MCA §45-9-101, it is a crime to sell, barter, 

exchange, give away, or offer to sell, barter, exchange, 

or give away any dangerous drug. As defined under the 
law, the list of “dangerous drugs” is broad. However, the 
definition includes, but is not limited to, methamphetamine, 
marijuana, cocaine, hallucinogenic mushrooms, LSD, heroin 
and other opiates (including prescription opiates), ecstasy, 
anabolic steroids, and depressants.

Criminal possession of dangerous 

drugs
The penalties for criminal possession of dangerous drugs 

(having the drugs with no intent to sell or give them to 
someone else) also vary. Under Montana Code Annotated, 
the penalties vary depending upon the type and quantity of 
the illicit substance. MCA §45-9-102.

In the case of first-time possession of marijuana, if 
the weight of the marijuana does not exceed 60 grams, 
it is treated as a misdemeanor and an individual can be 
sentenced to up to 6 months in the county jail and a fine of 
between $100 and $500. A second offense is punishable by a 
fine of not more than $1000 or a jail term of 1 to 3 years, or 
both.

In the case of first-time possession of an anabolic steroid, 
a conviction is treated as a misdemeanor, with a $100-$500 
fine or a term in the county jail of not more than 6 months, 
or both. Possession of other dangerous drugs – for example, 
methamphetamine, cocaine, or ecstasy – is punishable by up 
to 5 years in prison and a $50,000 fine.

26

G218Going to Canada

One of the great perks of living in Montana is our close 

proximity to our northern neighbors in Canada. 
Because of our two nations’ history of friendly relations, it 
is relatively easy for U.S. citizens to travel across the border. 
However, there are some things you should keep in mind 
when traveling into Canada.

First, you should be aware of what documentation is 

required to cross the border by land. Canadian law requires 
that all person entering Canada carry both proof of 
citizenship and proof of identity. If you are a U.S. citizen, 
make sure you carry proof of citizenship such as a passport, 
birth certificate, a certificate of citizenship or naturalization, 
a U.S. Permanent Resident Card, or a Certificate of Indian 
Status along with photo identification. Generally speaking, 
as long as you don’t have any outstanding warrants in the 
U.S. or Canada, or any criminal conviction in either country, 
you will be granted access.

Both the U.S. and Canadian governments urge frequent 

travelers to join the NEXUS trusted traveler program. 
NEXUS members receive a special travel card that allows 
expedited border crossings for both private and commercial 
travelers throughout both U.S. and Canadian border 
controls. Or you might consider a “passport card.” This is a 
special form of identification offered by the U.S. Department 
of State to ease identification requirements for border 
communities. When crossing the border by land or sea, your 
passport card will satisfy all identification requirements. You 
can apply for passport cards at numerous locations across 
Montana including several post offices and courthouses. To 
find a location, see http://iafdb.travel.state.gov/. The passport 
card can only be used for travel by land or sea. You cannot 
use the passport card when traveling by air; you must have a 
passport book.

What am I allowed to take across the 
border?
You should know what you can transport, or rather can’t 

transport, across the border. Any prescription drug 
brought across the border must be accompanied by a valid 
prescription and must be in the original packaging. If it isn’t, 
it will likely be confiscated and there could be a potential 
fee involved. If you are importing or exporting monetary 
instruments equal to or greater than CAN $10,000 (or the 
equivalent in foreign currency), you must report the amount 

to the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) when you 
arrive or before you leave Canada. This applies to either cash 
or other monetary instruments. 

You are required to have written authorization and 

permits to bring explosives, fireworks, and certain types of 
ammunition into Canada. 

You are allowed to import only one of the following 
amounts of alcoholic beverages free of duty and taxes:

53 ounces of wine; or

A total of 40 ounces of alcoholic beverages; or

Up to 24 ounces of beer or ale.

You are allowed to bring all of the following amounts of 
tobacco into Canada free of duty and taxes: 50 cigars, 200 
cigarettes, 6.4 ounces of tobacco, and 200 tobacco sticks. If 
you are a visitor to Canada, you cannot import prohibited 
firearms under any circumstances. You have to declare all 
firearms or weapons when you enter Canada. If you do not 
declare all firearms or weapons, they will be seized and you 
could face criminal charges. You need documents to prove 
that you are entitled to possess a firearm in Canada and 
you must transport it safely. Some examples of prohibited 
weapons/devices include: replica firearms, taser/stun guns, 
switchblades, butterfly knives, mace or pepper spray, nun 
Chaka sticks, shuriken (throwing stars), crossbows, brass 
knuckles, silencers, and cartridge magazines above a given 
capacity.

Returning to the U.S. 
There are also restrictions on what you can bring back to 

the United States on your return from Canada. If you 
have been in Canada for less than 48 hours you may bring 
back goods up to $200 in value. The goods will remain tax 
and duty free as long as they do not exceed the $200 value. 
This exemption includes no more than 50 cigarettes, 10 
cigars, 4 fluid ounces (150 milliliters) of alcoholic beverages, 
or 150 milliliters of perfume containing alcohol. If your 
purchases exceed the exemption, you will be subject to 
paying duties on all items purchased. All goods purchased in 
Canada must be declared. Keep your receipts!

You are prohibited from bringing back items that are 
deemed detrimental to the general welfare of the U.S. This 
includes narcotics, drugs, drug paraphernalia, obscene 
publications, seditious or treasonous material, lottery tickets, 

27

G218fireworks, poisonous or toxic substances, and switchblade 
knives.

What happens if you are arrested in 
Canada?
You will be arrested and given the opportunity to speak 

to a lawyer and, depending on your offense, you may 
or may not be released on bail. An arrest based out of the 
Coutts border crossing has court proceedings at Lethbridge, 
Alberta. Penalties vary depending on the offense you 
committed. Underage drinkers will be fined. The drinking 
age is 18 in Alberta, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, and 
Quebec. It is 19 in Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, 
and Newfoundland. If you are caught with a controlled 
substance, the penalty depends on your past criminal record. 
You could face jail time or a substantial fee.

Although the charges will not carry over into the U.S., and 

Canada cannot extradite you for minor offenses, it is still in 
your best interest to return for your court date and comply 
with any penalty you are faced with. If you do not return for 
your court date, Canadian authorities will issue a warrant for 
your arrest. Having an outstanding warrant on your record 
will prevent you from being able to travel internationally. 
Regardless of the offense, it is likely that any penalty will 
include your permanent barring from entry into Canada.

Canada:

into Canada, call the Canadian Border Information 
Service at 204-983-3500 or 506-636-5064 (long distance

be obtained through matters of simple 

courtesy. Be sure to give the landowner 
proper notice of when you intend to 
hunt on his property. It is illegal to hunt 
on private land without the owner’s 
permission. Since property ownership 
changes frequently, you should always 
do local research before you go on a 
hunting trip. Visit the website for the 
Montana Cadastral Mapping Project at 
http://svc.mt.gov/msl/mtcadastral to check 

land status.

It is also important to be aware of the different 

hunting seasons. Different species have different seasons; 
you can find out more information about hunting seasons at 
the Montana Fish, Wildlife, & Parks website, or at any place 
where a license is sold.

Hunting on public land is a very common 
practice in Montana. Although it might be regulated 

differently depending on the site, most lands that are 
accessible by a public road or a navigable river are available 
to hunting by the general public. You should be aware of 
the status of the land you intend to hunt on. It is highly 

28

G218recommended that you obtain a copy of the Montana Access 
Guide to State and Federal lands before your hunting trip. 
The guide is available for download at the Montana Fish, 
Wildlife & Parks website and is also available at regional 
offices.

Fishing
Before you go fishing, be sure that you have a proper 

license. Be aware of any species-specific fishing 
regulations. You should be sure to have a copy of the 
Montana Fishing Guide which is available at the Montana 

Fish, Wildlife & Parks website or at any place where fishing 
licenses are sold.

You are allowed to fish on every river and stream in 
Montana. However, you should be aware of public access 
points. The Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks department 
has placed a multitude of access points across the state. If 
you visit its website, you can find any public access point 
in your area. The best fishing websites are: The Montana 
Fishing Guide at http://fwp.mt.gov/fishing/guide and  
Public Access Points for Fishing at

However, gun dealers are subject to federal 
laws that do require them to obtain 
information from you for background 
checks and a record of purchase. 
There is no waiting period for gun 
purchases in Montana beyond the 
federal “instant check.” There are no 
waiting periods or background checks 
for purchases at gun shows, gun swaps, 
or gun re-sale through newspaper or 
other advertisements. Background checks 
are only completed if guns are purchased at 
federally licensed gun stores.

You do not need a permit to carry an unconcealed 

weapon, such as a rifle or shotgun, but you also cannot bring 
ANY weapon to certain places, such as a place where alcohol 
is served, a commercial carrier (such as a train or bus), 
school grounds (including having a hunting rifle in your 
vehicle in the school’s parking lot!), banks, or government 
buildings. 

You must have a permit to carry a concealed weapon. A 
“concealed weapon” is any weapon from the list below that

permit or license before you purchase a 
handgun, rifle, or shotgun. However, gun 
dealers are subject to federal laws that

from you for background checks and

carrying a concealed weapon without a 
permit is a fine not exceeding $500 or 
imprisonment in the county jail for a 
period not exceeding six months, or 
both. 

To obtain a concealed weapons 
permit, you apply through your local 
sheriff ’s department.

Other facts about gun laws
While it is generally easy to own a gun in 

Montana, you can have your gun rights 

taken away, particularly if you commit certain crimes. 
If you are convicted of any domestic violence offense in 
Montana, your gun rights will be taken away FOR LIFE! 
Also, punishment is often much stiffer if a crime you 
committed involves the use of a gun. 

Gun rights are somewhat restricted if you are under 18. 
Guardians can be held partially liable if their child is under 
14 and has a gun unsupervised in public.

G218Tribal Law

There are seven reservations within the borders of the 

state of Montana: (1) Blackfeet, (2) Chippewa-Cree, (3) 
Confederated Salish & Kootenai, (4) Crow, (5) Fort Belknap, 
(6) Fort Peck, and (7) Northern Cheyenne. Each of these 
reservations is a sovereign nation in its relationship with 
the federal government and the state government. The State 
of Montana recognizes an additional tribe, the Little Shell 
Chippewa, which is headquartered in Great Falls.

average citizen of Montana is that interactions with tribal 
members and tribal entities, either on or off the reservation, 
may cause you to be subject to Indian tribal law. Tribal 
courts may have civil jurisdiction over nonmembers if they 
have entered into certain business transactions or live within 
the reservation’s confines. Each tribe as an independent 
sovereign can establish its own laws, subject of course to the 
limitations of the U.S. Government.

Chief Justice John Marshall (the first chief justice of the 

Be aware that activities within the confines of a reservation 

U.S. Supreme Court) defined Indian tribes as “domestic 
dependent nations.”

Because of an Indian tribe’s sovereignty, an Indian tribe has 
the right to exercise criminal and civil jurisdiction over their 
own tribal members. In addition, tribes can also exercise 
criminal and civil jurisdiction over members of other tribes 
and non-Indians.

“Indian law” is extremely complex and is constantly 

evolving. The most important piece of information for the 

– such as hunting and fishing – or with a tribal member 
off the reservation may have legal consequences exposing 
you to tribal court jurisdiction. You should be generally 
aware of reservations located in your vicinity and have a 
basic understanding of the legal ordinances within that 
reservation.

G218Joining the Military and 
Selective Service

When you turn 18, you are eligible for military service. 

The U.S. military offers a great deal of benefits to young 
individuals entering the adult world. Some of these benefits 
include travel, job training, health insurance, money for 
college, a steady income, and retirement packages if you 
wish to be a career soldier. You can serve on active duty at 
military bases around the world or part-time in the Reserves 
or National Guard, close to home while you work or go to 
college. The military isn’t right for everyone, but it might 
be right for you. If this is a career you wish to pursue, you 
should contact a local recruitment officer in your area. 
Check out these websites to find out more about military 
service:

What is Selective Service?
Selective service is the mechanism by which the United 

States military “drafts” soldiers during a time of war. A 
registry is kept of all men between the ages of 18 and 25 and 
when a conscription act is passed by Congress, a lottery is 
used to pull citizens into involuntary service. Currently, the 
draft is not in effect, but Selective Service registration is still 
required. 

Male citizens of the United States are required to register 
for Selective Service within 30 days of their 18th birthday. 
Failure to do so can result in serious legal repercussions. 
These penalties include up to 5 years in jail and up to 
$250,000 in fines. 

However, prosecution is rare. Instead, a more conventional 

mechanism is used to encourage registration. In order to 
qualify for federal or Montana student financial aid, you 
must provide proof of selective service registration. No 
registration, no financial aid.

Voting

What are the requirements for voting?
You must be 18 or older, a U.S. citizen, and a resident of 

Montana. You also must have lived for at least 30 days in 
the county you intend to vote in. You also must be registered 
to vote. MCA §13-1-111.

How do I register to vote? 
There are a number of ways to register to vote in 

Montana. You can register in person at your county 

election office or you can register by mail. To register to vote, 
visit the Montana Secretary of State website  
(www.sos.mt.gov/Elections) to find the address of your 
county election office or to complete and print a voter 
registration card. Fill out and sign the voter registration card 
and drop it off or mail it to your county election office 30 
days before the election. If you miss the deadline, you can 
late register and vote at your county election office up to 
and including Election Day.

31

G218What information do I need to provide 
when registering to vote in Montana? 
You will need to provide your Montana driver’s license 

number when you register to vote. If you do not have a 

Montana driver’s license, you can provide the last 4 digits 
of your social security number. If you do not have a driver’s 
license or a social security number, you can provide either 
a current and valid photo ID (example: tribal ID, school 
district ID), a current utility bill, bank statement, paycheck, 
or other government document that shows your name and 
current address.

Can I vote if I have not registered before 
Election Day? 

Yes. The deadline for regular registration is 30 days before 
any election. If you miss that deadline, you can still register 
and vote in the election by late-registering at your county 
election office. Late registration is available at any time right 
up through the close of polls on Election Day.

Where do I vote?
You can visit My Voter Page at https://app.mt.gov/

voterinfo/ to find out if you are registered to vote, where 

you are registered to vote, and the location or directions 

to your polling location. You can also contact your county 
elections administrator to find out where you vote.

I am heading off to college; can I 
register to vote in the county where I 
am going to school? 
Yes. You can update your address with the election office 

in the county where you go to school, if you meet the 
30-day residency requirement. However, you cannot vote 
in two places – your parents’ house and at school. Choose 
the location you consider your residence. If you will be in 
another county or state for school, you can apply for an 
absentee ballot.

Can I vote absentee? If yes, how do I 
sign up? 
Yes. Montana has no-excuse absentee voting, meaning 

that you can request and receive an absentee ballot, 
even if you are not going to be absent from your place of 
residence on Election Day. If you want to vote by absentee 
ballot, fill out an Application for Absentee Ballot at  
sos.mt.gov (or sign up to be on the Annual Absentee List) 
and return it to your county election office. You can also sign 
up for the Annual Absentee List by checking the appropriate 
box when filling out a voter registration card.

Jury Service

The only contact most citizens will ever have with the 

court system is through jury service. The right to a trial 

by jury is one of our most important rights and is guaranteed 
by the United States and Montana Constitutions. By serving 
as a juror, citizens are helping to preserve this freedom.

If you are required to serve on a jury, you may be asked to 
make decisions that affect others’ civil or property rights, or 
you may be asked to determine someone’s right to freedom 
or even to life itself. Jurors’ contributions are invaluable to 
the court and to our democratic tradition. Jurors are selected 
for municipal court, justice court, district court, and federal 
court.

To be eligible to serve as a juror in Montana, a person 
must be a citizen of the state and a resident of the county, 
and be 18 years of age or older. They must be mentally and 
physically competent, be able to understand English, and not 
have been convicted of a felony or high crime, the sentence 
of which has not yet expired or the fine unpaid.  

If you receive a summons to appear for a trial as a juror, 

you will have to appear on the day and time listed, and 
participate in the questioning and selection process so that a 
fair and unbiased jury can be selected. Although some trials 
may extend for a week or more, most trials only last for two 
to three days.

Jury lists are prepared using the lists of registered voters 
and licensed drivers. Citizens’ names are randomly selected 
and jury summons are issued for those whose names are 
drawn.

Although employers are not required to pay employees 
while on jury duty, state law prevents an employer from 
firing or demoting any employee because of the employee’s 
service as a juror.

G218 Court Summons
A summons is the official document coming from the 

court informing the recipient that a lawsuit has been 

filed and they have been named as the respondent, the 
person who is being sued. Service of summons is essential 
for the court to acquire jurisdiction over the respondent. 
Failure to serve summons will lead to a dismissal. If 
improperly served, any judgment arising from the 
case cannot bind the respondent. This is usually 
the situation in cases where there are multiple 
respondents; those not properly served 
with summons cannot be held liable for 
the awards in the decision.

The general rule is that the summons 

must be served personally to the 
respondent. This means that the 
document must be handed to the 
respondent himself. The rule is not 
absolute however, and there are some 
exceptions. In special cases, where 
the respondent cannot be located or 
is in hiding, summons may be served by 
leaving a copy at his residence. Aside from 
absence of the respondent, it must also be shown 
that the sheriff performed reasonable effort to serve the 
summons personally. In case the respondent is out of reach 
or is abroad, service of summons can be made through 
publication in a newspaper of general circulation.

On the other hand, when a summons is correctly served, 
the recipient has no choice but to answer. The respondent 
is usually given 20 days to file a response, depending on 
the specific rule of each state. The period is counted from 

A summons is the  
official document coming 
from the court informing the recipi-
ent that a lawsuit has been filed and 
they have been named as the respondent, 
the person who is being sued. Service 
of summons is essential for the court 
to acquire jurisdiction over the 
respondent.

the day the respondent received the summons. If the last 
day of the period of filing a response falls on a weekend or 
a holiday, the respondent can still file the response on the 
following day.

The response will either directly contest the allegations 
in the case or deny the fact that the summons was properly 
served. Either way, the response must be made or else the 
respondent will be declared in default. A default order 

means that the respondent can no longer participate 
in the trial. His/her failure to file a response 
is a waiver of his right to contradict the 

allegations of the plaintiff. The respondent 

is then prohibited from presenting 
evidence and yet will be bound by the 
outcome. This is the worst scenario that 
can happen to the respondent because 
they cannot even defend themselves. 
The court will decide the case based 
solely on the evidence presented by the 
plaintiff. 

IT IS IMPORTANT to file a response 
within the time period, so carefully read the 
summons.  The document will usually indicate 

the date of receipt and the last day for filing a 

response. As a matter of practicality, it is always better 

to file an answer as soon as possible. 

However, if you are not sure of the contents of the 
summons, you should contact a lawyer. A lawyer will 
advise you on what is the best step to take after receiving 
a summons. A lawyer will not only tell you the deadline 
for filing but can also help you draft the content of your 
response.
