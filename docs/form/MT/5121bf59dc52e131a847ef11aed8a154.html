[1] An independent, fair, and impartial judiciary is indispensable to our system of justice.  The United States legal system is based upon the principle 
that an independent, impartial, and competent judiciary, composed of men and women of integrity, will interpret and apply the law that governs our 
society. Thus, the judiciary plays a central role in preserving the principles of justice and the rule of law. Inherent in all the Rules contained in this 
Code are the precepts that judges, individually and collectively, must respect and honor the judicial ofﬁ ce as a public trust and strive to maintain 
and enhance conﬁ dence in the legal system. 
[2] Judges should maintain the dignity of judicial ofﬁ ce at all times, and avoid both impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in their profes-
sional and personal lives.  They should aspire at all times to conduct that ensures the greatest possible public conﬁ dence in their independence, 
impartiality, integrity, and competence.
[3] The Code of Judicial Conduct establishes standards for the ethical conduct of judges and judicial candidates.  It is not intended as an exhaustive 
guide for the conduct of judges and judicial candidates, who are governed in their judicial and personal conduct by general ethical standards as well 
as by the Code.  The Code is intended, however, to provide guidance and assist judges in maintaining the highest standards of judicial and personal 
conduct, and to provide a basis for regulating their conduct through disciplinary agencies.

PREAMBLE

SCOPE

[1] The Code of Judicial Conduct consists of four Canons, numbered Rules under each Canon, and Comments that generally follow and explain each 
Rule.  Scope and Terminology paragraphs provide additional guidance in interpreting and applying the Code.  An Application paragraph establishes 
when the various Rules apply to a judge or judicial candidate.  The Code is not designed or intended as a basis for civil or criminal liability.  Neither 
is it intended to be the basis for litigants to seek to change a judge’s decision, to seek collateral remedies against each other, or to obtain tactical 
advantages in proceedings before a court.
[2] The Canons state overarching principles of judicial ethics that all judges must observe.  Although a judge may be disciplined only for violating 
a Rule, the Canons provide important guidance in interpreting the Rules. Where a Rule contains a permissive term, such as “may” or “should,” the 
conduct being addressed is committed to the personal and professional discretion of the judge or candidate in question, and no disciplinary action 
should be taken for action or inaction within the bounds of such discretion.
[3] The Comments that accompany the Rules serve two functions.  First, they provide guidance regarding the purpose, meaning, and proper 
application of the Rules.  They contain explanatory material and, in some instances, provide examples of permitted or prohibited conduct.  Comments 
neither add to nor subtract from the binding obligations set forth in the Rules.  Therefore, when a Comment contains the term “must,” it does not mean 
that the Comment itself is binding or enforceable; it signiﬁ es that the Rule in question, properly understood, is obligatory as to the conduct at issue. 
 [4] Second, the Comments identify aspirational goals for judges.  To implement fully the principles of this Code as articulated in the Canons, judges 
should strive to exceed the standards of conduct established by the Rules, holding themselves to the highest ethical standards and seeking to 
achieve those aspirational goals, thereby enhancing the dignity of the judicial ofﬁ ce. 
[5] The Rules of the Code of Judicial Conduct are rules of reason that should be applied consistent with constitutional requirements, statutes, other 
court rules, and decisional law, and with due regard for all relevant circumstances.  The Rules should not be interpreted to impinge upon the essential 
independence of judges in making judicial decisions.  
[6] Although the black letter of the Rules is binding and enforceable, it is not contemplated that every transgression will result in the imposition of 
discipline.  Whether discipline should be imposed should be determined through a reasonable and reasoned application of the Rules, and should depend 
upon factors such as the seriousness of the transgression, the facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the transgression, the extent of any 
pattern of improper activity, whether there have been previous violations, and the effect of the improper activity upon the judicial system or others.

TERMINOLOGY

The ﬁ rst time any term listed below is used in any given Rule in its deﬁ ned sense, it is followed by an asterisk (*).  

“Appropriate authority” means the authority having responsibility for initiation of disciplinary process in connection with the violation to be reported.  
See Rule 2.16. 

“Contribution” means both ﬁ nancial and in-kind contributions, such as goods, professional or volunteer services, advertising, and other types of 
assistance, which, if obtained by the recipient otherwise, would require a ﬁ nancial expenditure.  See Rules 3.7, 4.1, and 4.4. 

“Courts of limited jurisdiction” means justice courts, justice courts of record, city courts and municipal courts.  Where the context allows and for 
simplicity, the justices of the peace and judges of such courts may be collectively referred to as judges.  See Rules 2.9 and 2.10.

“De minimis,” in the context of interests pertaining to disqualiﬁ cation of a judge, means an insigniﬁ cant interest that could not raise a reasonable 
question regarding the judge’s impartiality.  See Rule 2.12.

“Domestic partner” means a person with whom another person maintains a household and an intimate relationship, other than a person to whom 
he or she is legally married.  See Rules 2.12, 3.13, and 3.14.

“Economic interest” means ownership of more than a de minimis legal or equitable interest.  Except for situations in which the judge participates 
in the management of such a legal or equitable interest, or the interest could be substantially affected by the outcome of a proceeding before a 
judge, it does not include: 

(1) an interest in the individual holdings within a mutual or common investment fund; 
(2) an interest in securities held by an educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, or civic organization in which the judge or the judge’s  
spouse, domestic partner, parent, or child serves as a director, an ofﬁ cer, an advisor, or other participant; 
(3) a deposit in a ﬁ nancial institution or deposits or proprietary interests the judge may maintain as a member of a mutual savings 
association or credit union, or similar proprietary interests; or 
(4) an interest in the issuer of government securities held by the judge. 

See Rules 1.3, 2.12, and 3.2.

“Ex parte communication” is any oral communication to a judge concerning a pending or impending matter, outside the presence of all the parties 
to the proceeding or their attorneys or outside the conﬁ nes of a duly noticed proceeding, or any written communication received by a judge that is 

not simultaneously provided to all parties or their attorneys.  See Rules 2.9 and 2.10.
“Fiduciary” includes relationships such as executor, administrator, trustee, or guardian.  See Rules 2.12, 3.2, and 3.8. 

“Impartial,” “impartiality,” and “impartially” mean absence of bias or prejudice in favor of, or against, particular parties or classes of parties, as 
well as maintenance of an open mind in considering issues that may come before a judge.  See Canons 1, 2, and 4, and Rules 1.2, 2.2, 2.9, 2.11, 
2.12, 2.14, 3.1, 3.12, 3.13, 4.1, and 4.2.

“Impending matter” is a matter that is imminent or expected to occur in the near future.  See Rule 2.9.

“Impropriety” includes conduct that violates the law, court rules, or provisions of this Code, and conduct that undermines a judge’s independence, 
integrity, or impartiality.  See Canon 1, and Rules 1.2 and 3.10.

“Independence” means a judge’s freedom from inﬂ uence or controls other than those established by law.  See Canons 1 and 4, and Rules 1.2, 
3.1, 3.12, 3.13, and 4.2.

“Independent candidate” means a candidate for a non-judicial public ofﬁ ce who is not a member or representative of a political organization.  See 
Rules 4.1 and 4.2.

“Integrity” means probity, fairness, honesty, uprightness, and soundness of character.  See Canons 1 and 4, and Rules 1.2, 3.1, 3.12, 3.13, and 4.2. 

“Judicial candidate” means any person, including a sitting judge, who is seeking selection for or retention in judicial ofﬁ ce by election or appointment.  
A person becomes a candidate for judicial ofﬁ ce as soon as he or she makes a public announcement of candidacy, declares or ﬁ les as a candidate 
with the election or appointment authority, authorizes or, where permitted, engages in solicitation or acceptance of contributions or support, or is 
nominated for election or appointment to ofﬁ ce.  See Rules 2.12, 4.1, 4.2, and 4.4.

“Knowingly,” “knowledge,” “known,” and “knows” mean actual knowledge of the fact in question.  A person’s knowledge may be inferred from 
circumstances.  See Rules 2.12, 2.16, 2.17, 3.2, 3.5, 3.6, and 4.1. 

“Law” encompasses court rules as well as statutes, constitutional provisions, and decisional law.  See Rules 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.6, 2.7, 2.9, 2.10, 3.1, 
3.2, 3.4, 3.7, 3.9, 3.10, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14, 4.1, 4.2, and 4.4.

“Member of the judge’s family” means a spouse, domestic partner, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, or other relative or person with whom 
the judge maintains a close familial relationship.  See Rules 3.7, 3.8, 3.10, and 3.11. 

“Member of a judge’s family residing in the judge’s household” means any relative of a judge by blood or marriage, or a person treated by a 
judge as a member of the judge’s family, who resides in the judge’s household.  See Rules 2.12 and 3.13. 

“Nonpublic information” means information that is not available to the public.  Nonpublic information includes any information regarding rulings 
or decisions the court is inclined to or intends to make, and any communications shared among judges during the decision-making process.  It may 
also include, but is not limited to, information that is sealed by statute or court order or impounded or communicated in camera, and information 
offered in grand jury proceedings, presentencing reports, dependency cases, or psychiatric reports.  See Rule 3.5. 

“Partisan candidate” means a candidate for public ofﬁ ce who seeks election as a member of or representing a political organization.  See Rules 
4.1 and 4.2.

“Pending matter” is a matter that has commenced.  A matter continues to be pending through any appellate process until ﬁ nal disposition.  See 
Rules 2.9, 2.11, and 4.1. 

“Political organization” means a political party or other group sponsored by or afﬁ liated with a political party or candidate, the principal purpose 
of which is to further the election or appointment of candidates for political ofﬁ ce.  For purposes of this Code, the term does not include a judicial 
candidate’s campaign committee created as authorized by Rule 4.4.  See Rules 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3. 

“Public election” includes primary and general elections, partisan elections, nonpartisan elections, and retention elections.  See Rule 4.4. 

“Third degree of relationship” includes the following persons:  great-grandparent, grandparent, parent, uncle, aunt, brother, sister, child, grandchild, 
great-grandchild, nephew, and niece.  See Rule 2.12.

CANON 1

CANON 2

A JUDGE SHALL UPHOLD AND PROMOTE THE INDEPENDENCE, 
INTEGRITY, AND IMPARTIALITY OF THE JUDICIARY, AND SHALL 
AVOID IMPROPRIETY AND THE APPEARANCE OF IMPROPRIETY. 
RULE 1.1 - COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW

A judge shall comply with the law,* including the Code of Judicial Conduct. 
RULE 1.2 - PROMOTING CONFIDENCE IN THE JUDICIARY

A judge shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public conﬁ dence 
in the independence,* integrity,* and impartiality* of the judiciary, and shall 
avoid impropriety* and the appearance of impropriety. 

COMMENT 
[1] Public conﬁ dence in the judiciary is eroded by improper conduct and 
conduct that creates the appearance of impropriety.  This principle applies 
to both the professional and personal conduct of a judge.
[2] A judge should expect to be the subject of public scrutiny that might 
be viewed as burdensome if applied to other citizens, and must accept 
the restrictions imposed by the Code.
[3] Conduct that compromises or appears to compromise the 
independence, integrity, and impartiality of a judge undermines public 
conﬁ dence in the judiciary.  Because it is not practicable to list all such 
conduct, the Rule is necessarily cast in general terms.
[4] Judges should participate in activities that promote ethical conduct 
among judges and lawyers, support professionalism within the judiciary 
and the legal profession, and promote access to justice for all.
[5] Actual improprieties include violations of law, court rules, or provisions 
of this Code.  The test for appearance of impropriety is whether the 
conduct would create in reasonable minds a perception that the judge 
violated this Code or engaged in other conduct that reﬂ ects adversely 
on  the  judge’s  honesty,  impartiality,  temperament,  or  ﬁ tness  to  serve 
as a judge. 
[6] A judge should initiate and participate in community outreach activities 
for the purpose of promoting public understanding of and conﬁ dence in 
the  administration  of  justice.    In  conducting  such  activities,  the  judge 
must act in a manner consistent with this Code.

RULE 1.3 - AVOIDING ABUSE OF PRESTIGE OF JUDICIAL 
OFFICE

A  judge  shall  not  abuse  the  prestige  of  judicial  ofﬁ ce  to  advance  the 
personal or economic interests* of the judge or others, or allow others 
to do so. 

COMMENT
[1] It is improper for a judge to use or attempt to use his or her position 
to  gain  personal  advantage  or  deferential  treatment  of  any  kind.    For 
example, it would be improper for a judge to allude to his or her judicial 
status  to  gain  favorable  treatment  in  encounters  with  trafﬁ c  ofﬁ cials.  
Similarly, a judge must not use judicial letterhead to gain an advantage 
in conducting his or her personal business.
[2] A judge may provide a reference or recommendation for an individual 
based upon the judge’s personal knowledge.  The judge may use ofﬁ cial 
letterhead  if  the  judge  indicates  that  the  reference  is  personal  and  if 
there is no likelihood that the use of the letterhead would reasonably be 
perceived as an attempt to exert pressure by reason of the judicial ofﬁ ce.
[3] Judges may participate in the process of judicial selection by 
cooperating with appointing authorities and screening committees, and 
by responding to inquiries from such entities concerning the professional 
qualiﬁ cations of a person being considered for judicial ofﬁ ce.
[4] Special considerations arise when judges write or contribute to 
publications of for-proﬁ t entities, whether related or unrelated to the law.  
A judge should not permit anyone associated with the publication of such 
materials to exploit the judge’s ofﬁ ce in a manner that violates this Rule 
or other applicable law.  In contracts for publication of a judge’s writing, 
the judge should retain sufﬁ cient control over the advertising to avoid 
such exploitation.

A  JUDGE  SHALL  PERFORM  THE  DUTIES  OF  JUDICIAL  OFFICE 
IMPARTIALLY, COMPETENTLY, AND DILIGENTLY.

RULE  2.1  -  GIVING  PRECEDENCE  TO  THE  DUTIES  OF 
JUDICIAL OFFICE

The duties of judicial ofﬁ ce, as prescribed by law,* shall take 
precedence over all of a judge’s personal and extrajudicial activities.

COMMENT
[1] To ensure that judges are available to fulﬁ ll their judicial duties, judges 
must conduct their personal and extrajudicial activities to minimize the risk 
of conﬂ icts that would result in frequent disqualiﬁ cation.  See Canon 3.
[2] Although it is not a duty of judicial ofﬁ ce unless prescribed by law, 
judges  are  encouraged  to  participate  in  activities  that  promote  public 
understanding of and conﬁ dence in the justice system.
RULE 2.2 - IMPARTIALITY AND FAIRNESS
A judge shall uphold and apply the law,* and shall perform all duties of 
judicial ofﬁ ce fairly and impartially.*

COMMENT
[1]  To  ensure  impartiality  and  fairness  to  all  parties,  a  judge  must  be 
objective and open-minded.
[2] Although each judge comes to the bench with a unique background 
and personal philosophy, a judge must interpret and apply the law without 
regard  to  whether  the  judge  approves  or  disapproves  of  the  law  in 
question.
[3] When applying and interpreting the law, a judge sometimes may make 
good-faith errors of fact or law.  Errors of this kind do not violate this Rule.
[4] A judge should manage the courtroom in a manner that provides all 
litigants the opportunity to have their matters fairly adjudicated in 
accordance with the law.  
[5] A judge may make reasonable accommodations to ensure 
self-represented litigants the opportunity to have their matters fairly heard.  
Steps that are permissible in ensuring a self-represented litigant’s right to 
be heard according to law include but are not limited to:  liberally 
construing pleadings; providing brief information about the proceeding and 
evidentiary and foundational requirements; modifying the traditional order 
of taking evidence; attempting to make legal concepts understandable; 
explaining the basis for a ruling; and making referrals to any resources 
available to assist the litigant in preparation of the case.  Self-represented 
litigants are still required to comply with the same substantive law and 
procedural requirements as represented litigants.
RULE 2.3 - BIAS, PREJUDICE, AND HARASSMENT
(A) A judge shall perform the duties of judicial ofﬁ ce, including 
administrative duties, without bias or prejudice.
(B) A judge shall not, in the performance of judicial duties, by words or 
conduct manifest bias or prejudice, or engage in harassment, 
including but not limited to bias, prejudice, or harassment based upon 
race, sex, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual 
orientation, marital status, socioeconomic status, or political afﬁ liation, 
and shall not permit court staff, court ofﬁ cials, or others subject to the 
judge’s direction and control to do so.
(C) A judge shall require lawyers in proceedings before the court to refrain 
from manifesting bias or prejudice, or engaging in 
harassment, based upon attributes including but not limited to race, sex, 
gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual 
orientation, marital status, socioeconomic status, or political 
afﬁ liation, against parties, witnesses, lawyers, or others.
(D) The restrictions of paragraphs (B) and (C) do not preclude judges or 
lawyers from making legitimate reference to the listed factors, or similar 
factors, when they are relevant to an issue in a proceeding.

COMMENT
[1] A judge who manifests bias or prejudice in a proceeding impairs the 
fairness of the proceeding and brings the judiciary into disrepute.
[2] Examples of manifestations of bias or prejudice include, but are not 
limited to, epithets; slurs; demeaning nicknames; negative stereotyping; 
attempted humor based upon stereotypes; threatening, intimidating, or 
hostile acts; suggestions of connections between race, ethnicity, or na-
tionality and crime; and irrelevant references to personal characteristics.  

Even facial expressions and body language can convey to parties and 
lawyers in the proceeding, jurors, the media, and others an appearance 
of bias or prejudice.  A judge must avoid conduct that may reasonably 
be perceived as prejudiced or biased.
[3] Harassment, as referred to in paragraphs (B) and (C), is verbal or 
physical conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward 
a person on bases such as race, sex, gender, religion, national origin, 
ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, marital status, socioeconomic 
status, or political afﬁ liation.
[4] Sexual harassment includes but is not limited to sexual advances, 
requests  for  sexual  favors,  and  other  verbal  or  physical  conduct  of  a 
sexual nature that is unwelcome.
RULE 2.4 - EXTERNAL INFLUENCES ON JUDICIAL CONDUCT

(A) A judge shall not be swayed by public clamor or fear of criticism.
(B) A judge shall not permit family, social, political, ﬁ nancial, or other 
interests  or  relationships  to  inﬂ uence  the  judge’s  judicial  conduct  or 
judgment. 
(C) A judge shall not convey or permit others to convey the impression 
that any person or organization is in a position to inﬂ uence the judge. 

COMMENT
[1] An independent judiciary requires that judges decide cases according 
to the law and facts, without regard to whether particular laws or litigants 
are popular or unpopular with the public, the media, government ofﬁ cials, 
or the judge’s friends or family.  Conﬁ dence in the judiciary is eroded 
if  judicial  decision  making  is  perceived  to  be  subject  to  inappropriate 
outside inﬂ uences.  
RULE 2.5 - COMPETENCE, DILIGENCE, AND COOPERATION
(A) A judge shall perform judicial and administrative duties competently 
and diligently.
(B) A judge shall cooperate with other judges and court ofﬁ cials in the 
administration of court business.

COMMENT
[1] Competence in the performance of judicial duties requires the legal 
knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary 
to perform a judge’s responsibilities of judicial ofﬁ ce. 
[2] A judge should seek the necessary docket time, court staff, 
expertise, and resources to discharge all adjudicative and administrative 
responsibilities.
[3] Prompt disposition of the court’s business requires a judge to devote 
adequate time to judicial duties, to be punctual in attending court and 
expeditious in determining matters under submission, and to take 
reasonable measures to ensure that court ofﬁ cials, litigants, and their 
lawyers cooperate with the judge to that end.
[4] In disposing of matters promptly and efﬁ ciently, a judge must 
demonstrate due regard for the rights of parties to be heard and to have 
issues  resolved  without  unnecessary  cost  or  delay.   A  judge  should 
monitor and supervise cases in ways that reduce or eliminate dilatory 
practices, avoidable delays, and unnecessary costs.  In accomplishing 
these  critical  goals  in  the  increasing  number  of  cases  involving  self-
represented litigants, a judge may take appropriate steps to facilitate a 
self-represented litigant’s ability to be heard.  See Rule 2.6, Comment 1.
RULE 2.6 - ENSURING THE RIGHT TO BE HEARD

(A) A judge shall accord to every person who has a legal interest in a 
proceeding, or that person’s lawyer, the right to be heard according to law.*
(B) A judge may encourage parties to a proceeding and their lawyers to 
settle matters in dispute but shall not act in a manner that coerces any 
party into settlement.

COMMENT
[1] The right to be heard is an essential component of a fair and 
impartial system of justice.  Substantive rights of litigants can be protected 
only if procedures protecting the right to be heard are observed.  Steps 
judges may consider in facilitating the right to be heard include, but are 
not limited to:  (1) providing brief information about the proceeding and 
evidentiary and foundational requirements; (2) asking neutral questions 
to elicit or clarify information; (3) modifying the traditional order of taking 
evidence; (4) refraining from using legal jargon; (5) explaining the basis 
for a ruling; and (6) making referrals to any resources available to assist 
the litigant in the preparation of the case.
[2] The  judge  plays  an  important  role  in  overseeing  the  settlement  of 

disputes, but should be careful that efforts to further settlement do not 
undermine  any  party’s  right  to  be  heard  according  to  law.   The  judge 
should keep in mind the effect that the judge’s participation in 
settlement discussions may have, not only on the judge’s own views of 
the case, but also on the perceptions of the lawyers and the parties if the 
case remains with the judge after settlement efforts are unsuccessful.  
Among the factors that a judge should consider when deciding upon an 
appropriate settlement practice for a case are:  (1) whether the parties 
have requested or voluntarily consented to a certain level of 
participation  by  the  judge  in  settlement  discussions,  (2)  whether  the 
parties  and  their  counsel  are  relatively  sophisticated  in  legal  matters, 
(3)  whether  the  case  will  be  tried  by  the  judge  or  a  jury,  (4)  whether 
the parties participate with their counsel in settlement discussions, (5) 
whether any parties are unrepresented by counsel, and (6) whether the 
matter is civil or criminal.
[3] Judges must be mindful of the effect settlement discussions can have, 
not only on their objectivity and impartiality, but also on the appearance 
of their objectivity and impartiality.  Despite a judge’s best efforts, there 
may be instances when information obtained during settlement 
discussions could inﬂ uence a judge’s decision making during trial, and, in 
such instances, the judge should consider whether disqualiﬁ cation may 
be appropriate.  See Rule 2.12(A)(1). 
RULE 2.7 - RESPONSIBILITY TO DECIDE

A judge shall hear and decide matters assigned to the judge, except when 
disqualiﬁ cation is required by Rule 2.12 or other law.*

COMMENT
[1]  Judges  must  be  available  to  decide  the  matters  that  come  before 
the court.  Although there are times when disqualiﬁ cation is necessary 
to  protect  the  rights  of  litigants  and  preserve  public  conﬁ dence  in  the 
independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary, judges must be 
available to decide matters that come before the courts.  Unwarranted 
disqualiﬁ cation may bring public disfavor to the court and to the judge 
personally.  The dignity of the court, the judge’s respect for fulﬁ llment of 
judicial duties, and a proper concern for the burdens that may be imposed 
upon the judge’s colleagues require that a judge not use disqualiﬁ cation 
to avoid cases that present difﬁ cult, controversial, or unpopular issues. 

RULE 2.8 - DECORUM, DEMEANOR, AND COMMUNICATION 
WITH JURORS

(A) A judge shall require order and decorum in proceedings before the 
court.
(B) A judge shall be patient, digniﬁ ed, and courteous to litigants, jurors, 
witnesses,  lawyers,  court  staff,  court  ofﬁ cials,  and  others  with  whom 
the judge deals in an ofﬁ cial capacity, and shall require similar conduct 
of lawyers, court staff, court ofﬁ cials, and others subject to the judge’s 
direction and control.
(C) A judge shall not commend or criticize jurors for their verdict other 
than in a court order or opinion in a proceeding.

COMMENT
[1] The duty to hear all proceedings with patience and courtesy is not 
inconsistent with the duty imposed in Rule 2.5 to dispose promptly of the 
business of the court.  Judges can be efﬁ cient and businesslike while 
being patient and deliberate.
[2] Commending or criticizing jurors for their verdict may imply a judicial 
expectation in future cases and may impair a juror’s ability to be fair and 
impartial in a subsequent case.
[3] A judge who is not otherwise prohibited by law from doing so may 
meet with jurors who choose to remain after trial but should be careful 
not to discuss the merits of the case.

RULE 2.9 - EX PARTE COMMUNICATIONS; 
*INVESTIGATIONS - COURTS OF LIMITED JURISDICTION*

(A) Except as permitted in paragraph (C) of this Rule, a judge of a court 
of limited jurisdiction shall not investigate the substantive facts, 
circumstances, or merits of a pending* or impending* matter.  
(B) Except as permitted in paragraph (D) of this Rule, a judge of a court 
of limited jurisdiction shall not initiate, permit, or consider ex parte 
communications.*
(C)  When  circumstances  or  the  interests  of  justice  require  it  or  when 
expressly authorized by law,* a judge of a court of limited jurisdiction may 

examine the criminal record, driving record, and on-line court records 
repository pertaining to a defendant in a pending or impending matter 
which is on ﬁ le within an agency of the state of Montana for the purpose 
of determining whether the charge is lawful or for purposes of setting bail 
or sentencing.  A judge may not amend the charge except on motion of 
the prosecutor and as otherwise provided by law. 
(D)  When  circumstances  or  the  interests  of  justice  require  it  or  when 
expressly authorized by law, a judge of a court of limited jurisdiction may: 
 
(1) engage in ex parte communications involving administrative, 
ministerial or scheduling matters provided: 

(a) the judge reasonably believes that no party will gain a 

procedural or tactical advantage as a result of the ex parte 
communication; and 

(b) the judge notiﬁ es all other parties, if necessary to prevent any 

party from gaining a procedural or tactical advantage.  
 
(2) consult with court staff and court ofﬁ cials whose functions are to 
aid the judge in carrying out the judge’s adjudicative responsibilities, with 
other judges or with peace ofﬁ cers, prosecutors, and defense counsel 
provided: 

(a) that the judge avoids receiving factual information that is  

not a part of the record or part of the defendant’s criminal or   
driving record; and 

(b) that the judge does not abrogate his or her responsibility  

to personally adjudicate the matter fairly and impartially.*
 
the prosecutor is not present, provided:

(3) receive ex parte communications in proceedings in open court if 

(a) that the prosecutor has not otherwise informed the judge  

in writing of his or her desire or willingness to appear; and  

(b) that the judge shall not try a case to the court or to a jury  

(4) verify whether a party has a valid driver’s license and 

without the presence of a prosecutor.
 
mandatory automobile insurance and whether a party is complying with 
any restitution requirement or conditions imposed in a sentence. 
 
(5) receive ex parte communications in proceedings involving 
temporary orders of protection provided that the respondent has been 
given notice and an opportunity to appear to the extent required by law.
 
(6) Except as set forth in subparagraphs (1) through (5), if a judge 
receives an ex parte communication or other information having a 
potentially signiﬁ cant bearing upon the substance of a matter, the judge 
shall make provision promptly to notify the parties of the content of the 
communication or information and provide the parties with an opportunity 
to respond.  If such communication or information is in writing, a copy of 
it shall be made available to the parties and retained. 
(E) A judge shall make reasonable efforts, including providing appropriate 
supervision, to ensure that this Rule is not violated by court staff, court 
ofﬁ cials, and others subject to the judge’s direction and control.

COMMENT
[1] This Rule is tailored to accommodate the unique circumstances in 
which Montana’s courts of limited jurisdiction operate.  This Rule 
acknowledges  that  these  courts  exist  in  both  large  metropolitan  and 
isolated rural locations; that the judges of these courts may or may not 
have clerks or other staff; that prosecutors may or may not be able to 
be present at all proceedings of the court; that it is necessary for these 
judges to sometimes speak directly with a party, peace ofﬁ cer, 
administrative personnel, or insurance agent to verify or clarify 
administrative or ministerial facts; and that such courts must administer 
large case loads consisting primarily of misdemeanor criminal and trafﬁ c 
offenses and civil matters involving amounts limited by law. 
[2] This Rule provides some ﬂ exibility to the judges of courts of limited 
jurisdiction in dealing with procedural, administrative, and ministerial 
matters, while retaining requirements that the judge may not 
independently investigate the substantive facts or merits of any pending 
or impending matter; that notice and opportunity to be heard be provided 
if the judge receives or obtains information which may have a signiﬁ cant 
bearing upon an pending or impending matter; and that the judge 
personally adjudicate the matter at issue impartially and fairly.  While the 
judge may use discretion and common sense, those must be exercised in 
accordance with the law and keeping in mind constitutional rights of the 
parties.  Nothing in this Rule abrogates the judge’s obligation to comply 
with all applicable laws, court rules, or administrative regulations.
[3] The prohibition against a judge independently investigating the 
substantive facts or merits of any matter that is or may come before the 
court extends to information available in all mediums, including electronic.
[4] Judges are admonished that they are members of a distinct branch of 

government—the judiciary; that they are always to perform their duties 
as neutral and detached magistrates; and that they do not function as 
arms of local government, law enforcement, or as members of either the 
prosecution or defense “team.”  Judges do not and may not “represent” 
either party.
[5] This Code also controls the conduct of a judge if and when the judge 
functions as the court clerk or administrator.
RULE 2.10 - EX PARTE COMMUNICATIONS* - ALL 
COURTS EXCEPT FOR COURTS OF LIMITED 
JURISDICTION*

(A) A judge shall not initiate, permit, or consider ex parte 
communications, except as follows:
 
(1) When circumstances require it, ex parte communication for 
scheduling, administrative, or emergency purposes, which does not 
address substantive matters, is permitted, provided:

(a)  the  judge  reasonably  believes  that  no  party  will  gain  a 
procedural, substantive, or tactical advantage as a result of the ex parte 
communication; and

(3) A judge may initiate, permit, or consider any ex parte 

(b) the judge makes provision promptly to notify all other 
parties of the content of the ex parte communication, and gives the 
parties an opportunity to respond.
 
(2) A  judge  may  consult  with  court  staff  and  court  ofﬁ cials  whose 
functions  are  to  aid  the  judge  in  carrying  out  the  judge’s  adjudicative 
responsibilities, or with other judges, provided the judge avoids receiving 
factual information that is not part of the record, and does not abrogate 
the responsibility personally to decide the matter. 
 
communication  when  expressly  authorized  by  law*  to  do  so,  or  when 
serving on therapeutic or problem-solving courts, mental health courts, 
drug courts, or the water court.  In this capacity, judges may assume a 
more interactive role with parties, treatment providers, probation ofﬁ cers, 
social workers, and others.
(B) If a judge receives an ex parte communication having a potentially 
signiﬁ cant bearing upon the substance of a matter, the judge shall make 
provision promptly to notify the parties of the content of the 
communication and provide the parties with an opportunity to respond.  
If such communication is in writing, a copy of it shall be made available 
to the parties and retained.  
(C) A judge shall not investigate matters independently.*
(D) A judge shall make reasonable efforts, including providing appropriate 
supervision, to ensure that this Rule is not violated by court staff, court 
ofﬁ cials, and others subject to the judge’s direction and control.

COMMENT
[1] Whenever notice to a party is required by this Rule, it is the party’s 
lawyer, or if the party is unrepresented, the party to whom notice is to 
be given.
[2] The proscription against communications concerning a proceeding 
includes communications with lawyers, law teachers, and other persons 
who are not participants in the proceeding, except to the limited extent 
permitted by this Rule.
[3] A  judge  may  initiate,  permit,  or  consider  ex  parte  communications 
expressly  authorized  by  law,  such  as  when  serving  on  therapeutic  or 
problem-solving courts, mental health courts, drug courts, or the water 
court.  In this capacity, judges may assume a more interactive role with 
parties, treatment providers, probation ofﬁ cers, social workers, and others.
[4] A judge must avoid ex parte discussions of a case with judges who 
have previously been substituted or disqualiﬁ ed from hearing the matter, 
and with judges who have trial or appellate jurisdiction over the matter.
[5]  The  prohibition  against  a  judge  investigating  the  facts  in  a  matter 
extends to information available in all mediums, including electronic.  The 
prohibition does not apply to a judge’s effort to obtain general information 
about a specialized area of knowledge that does not include the 
application of such information in a speciﬁ c case.  Nor does the 
prohibition  apply  to  interstate  or  state-federal  communications  among 
judges  on  the  general  topic  of  case  management  decisions  in  mass 
torts  or  other  complex  cases,  such  as  discovery  schedules,  standard 
interrogatories,  shared  discovery  depositories,  appointment  of  liaison 
counsel, committee membership, or common fund structures.
[6]  Consultations  with  ethics  advisory  committees,  outside  counsel, 
or legal experts concerning the judge’s compliance with this Code are 
permitted.  
[7] It is acknowledged that judges frequently receive unsolicited ex parte 

communications.    Judges  should  apply  their  discretion  and  common 
sense when called upon to determine whether any such communication 
qualiﬁ es  as  one  having  a  potentially  signiﬁ cant  bearing  upon  the 
substance of a matter, for purposes of paragraph (B).

RULE  2.11  -  JUDICIAL  STATEMENTS  ON  PENDING  AND 
IMPENDING CASES

(A) A judge shall not make any public statement that might reasonably be 
expected to affect the outcome or impair the fairness of a matter pending* 
or impending* in any court, or make any nonpublic statement that might 
substantially interfere with a fair trial or hearing.
(B) A judge shall not, in connection with cases, controversies, or issues 
that  are  likely  to  come  before  the  court,  make  pledges,  promises,  or 
commitments  that  are  inconsistent  with  the  impartial*  performance  of 
the adjudicative duties of judicial ofﬁ ce.
(C) A judge shall require court staff, court ofﬁ cials, and others subject to 
the judge’s direction and control to refrain from making statements that 
the judge would be prohibited from making by paragraphs (A) and (B).
(D) Notwithstanding the restrictions in paragraph (A), a judge may make 
public statements in the course of ofﬁ cial duties, may explain court 
procedures, and may comment on any proceeding in which the judge is 
a litigant in a personal capacity.
(E) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (A), a judge may respond 
directly or through a third party to allegations in the media or elsewhere 
concerning the judge’s conduct in a matter.

COMMENT
[1] This Rule’s restrictions on judicial speech are essential to the 
maintenance  of  the  independence,  integrity,  and  impartiality  of  the 
judiciary.
[2] This Rule does not prohibit a judge from commenting on proceedings 
in which the judge is a litigant in a personal capacity.  In cases in which 
the judge is a litigant in an ofﬁ cial capacity, such as a writ of mandamus, 
the judge must not comment publicly.
[3] Depending upon the circumstances, the judge should consider whether 
it may be preferable for a third party, rather than the judge, to respond or 
issue statements in connection with allegations concerning the judge’s 
conduct in a matter.
RULE 2.12 - DISQUALIFICATION
(A) A judge shall disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which 
the judge’s impartiality* might reasonably be questioned, including but 
not limited to the following circumstances:
 
(1) The judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party 
or a party’s lawyer, or personal knowledge* of facts that are in dispute in 
the proceeding.
(2) The judge knows* that the judge, the judge’s spouse or domestic 
 
partner,* or a person within the third degree of relationship* to either of 
them, or the spouse or domestic partner of such a person is:

(a) a party to the proceeding, or an ofﬁ cer, director, general 

partner, managing member, or trustee of a party;

(b) acting as a lawyer in the proceeding;
(c) a person who has more than a de minimis* interest that 

could be substantially affected by the proceeding; or

 
(3) The judge knows that he or she, individually or as a ﬁ duciary,* 
or the judge’s spouse, domestic partner, parent, or child, or any other 
member of the judge’s family residing in the judge’s household,* has an 
economic interest* in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to 
the proceeding.
 
(4) The judge, while a judge or a judicial candidate,* has made a 
public statement, other than in a court proceeding, judicial decision, or 
opinion, that commits or appears to commit the judge to reach a particular 
result or rule in a particular way in the proceeding or controversy.
 

(5) The judge:

(a)  served  as  a  lawyer  in  the  matter  in  controversy,  or  was 
associated with a lawyer who participated substantially as a lawyer in 
the matter during such association;

(b) served in governmental employment, and in such 

capacity participated personally and substantially as a lawyer or public 
ofﬁ cial  concerning  the  proceeding,  or  has  publicly  expressed  in  such 
capacity  an  opinion  concerning  the  merits  of  the  particular  matter  in 
controversy;

(c) was a material witness concerning the matter; or

(d) previously presided as a judge over the matter in another 

court.
(B) A judge shall keep informed about the judge’s personal and ﬁ duciary 
economic interests, and make a reasonable effort to keep informed about 
the personal economic interests of the judge’s spouse or domestic partner 
and minor children residing in the judge’s household.
(C) A judge subject to disqualiﬁ cation under this Rule, other than for bias 
or prejudice under paragraph (A)(1), may disclose in writing or on the 
record the basis of the judge’s disqualiﬁ cation and may ask the parties 
and their lawyers to consider, outside the presence of the judge and court 
personnel, whether to waive disqualiﬁ cation.  If, following the disclosure, 
the parties and lawyers agree, without participation by the judge or court 
personnel, that the judge should not be disqualiﬁ ed, the judge may 
participate in the proceeding.  The agreement shall be incorporated into 
the record of the proceeding.

COMMENT
[1] Under this Rule, a judge is disqualiﬁ ed whenever the judge’s 
impartiality might reasonably be questioned, regardless of whether any 
of the speciﬁ c provisions of paragraphs (A)(1) through (5) apply.
[2] A judge’s obligation not to hear or decide matters in which 
disqualiﬁ cation  is  required  applies  regardless  of  whether  a  motion  to 
disqualify is ﬁ led.
[3] The rule of necessity may override the rule of disqualiﬁ cation.  For 
example, a judge might be required to participate in judicial review of a 
judicial salary statute, or might be the only judge available in a matter 
requiring immediate judicial action, such as a hearing on probable cause 
or a temporary restraining order.  In matters that require immediate action, 
the judge must disclose on the record the basis for possible 
disqualiﬁ cation  and  make  reasonable  efforts  to  transfer  the  matter  to 
another judge as soon as practicable.
[4] The fact that a lawyer in a proceeding is afﬁ liated with a law ﬁ rm with 
which a relative of the judge is afﬁ liated does not itself disqualify the judge.  
If, however, the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned under 
paragraph (A), or the relative is known by the judge to have an interest in 
the law ﬁ rm that could be substantially affected by the proceeding under 
paragraph (A)(2)(c), the judge’s disqualiﬁ cation is required.
[5] A  judge  should  disclose  on  the  record  information  that  the  judge 
believes the parties or their lawyers might reasonably consider relevant 
to a possible motion for disqualiﬁ cation, even if the judge believes there 
is no basis for disqualiﬁ cation.
[6] “Economic interest,” as set forth in the Terminology paragraph, means 
ownership of more than a de minimis legal or equitable interest.  Except 
for situations in which a judge participates in the management of such a 
legal or equitable interest, or the interest could be substantially affected 
by the outcome of a proceeding before a judge, it does not include

(a)  an  interest  in  the  individual  holdings  within  a  mutual  or 

common investment fund;

(b) an interest in securities held by an educational, religious, 
charitable, fraternal, or civic organization in which the judge or the judge’s 
spouse, domestic partner, parent, or child serves as a director, ofﬁ cer, 
advisor, or other participant;

(c) a deposit in a ﬁ nancial institution or deposits or proprietary 

interests the judge may maintain as a member of a mutual savings 
association or credit union, or similar proprietary interests; or

the judge.
RULE 2.13 - SUPERVISORY DUTIES

(A) A judge shall require court staff, court ofﬁ cials, and others subject to 
the judge’s direction and control to act in a manner consistent with the 
judge’s obligations under this Code.
(B) A judge with supervisory authority for the performance of other judges 
shall  take  reasonable  measures  to  ensure  that  those  judges  properly 
discharge their judicial responsibilities, including the prompt disposition 
of matters before them.

COMMENT
[1] A judge is responsible for his or her own conduct and for the conduct 
of others, such as staff, when those persons are acting at the judge’s 
direction or control.  A judge may not direct court personnel to engage in 
conduct on the judge’s behalf or as the judge’s representative when such 
conduct would violate the Code if undertaken by the judge.
[2] Public conﬁ dence in the judicial system depends upon timely justice.  
To promote the efﬁ cient administration of justice, a judge with supervisory 

(d) likely to be a material witness in the proceeding.

(d) an interest in the issuer of government securities held by 

authority must take the steps needed to ensure that judges under his or 
her supervision administer their workloads promptly.
RULE 2.14 - ADMINISTRATIVE APPOINTMENTS
(A) In making administrative appointments, a judge:
 
basis of merit; and
 
(2) shall avoid nepotism, favoritism, and unnecessary appointments.
(B) A judge shall not approve compensation of appointees beyond the 
fair value of services rendered.

(1) shall exercise the power of appointment impartially* and on the 

COMMENT
[1] Appointees  of  a  judge  include  assigned  counsel,  ofﬁ cials  such  as 
referees,  commissioners,  special  masters,  receivers,  and  guardians, 
and personnel such as clerks, secretaries, and bailiffs.  Consent by the 
parties to an appointment or an award of compensation does not relieve 
the judge of the obligation prescribed by paragraph (A).
[2] Unless otherwise deﬁ ned by law, nepotism is the appointment or hiring 
of any relative within the third degree of relationship of either the judge 
or the judge’s spouse or domestic partner, or the spouse or domestic 
partner of such relative.
RULE 2.15 - DISABILITY AND IMPAIRMENT
A judge having a reasonable belief that the performance of a lawyer or 
another judge is impaired by drugs or alcohol, or by a mental, emotional, 
or physical condition, shall take appropriate action, which may include a 
conﬁ dential referral to a lawyer or judicial assistance program.

COMMENT
[1] “Appropriate action” means action intended and reasonably likely to 
help the judge or lawyer in question address the problem and prevent 
harm to the justice system.  Depending upon the circumstances, 
appropriate action may include, but is not limited to, speaking directly to 
the impaired person, notifying an individual with supervisory responsibility 
over the impaired person, or making a referral to an assistance program.
[2] Taking or initiating corrective action by way of referral to an assistance 
program may satisfy a judge’s responsibility under this Rule.  Assistance 
programs have many approaches for offering help to impaired judges 
and lawyers, such as intervention, counseling, or referral to appropriate 
health care professionals.  Depending upon the gravity of the conduct that 
has come to the judge’s attention, however, the judge may be required 
to take other action, such as reporting the impaired judge or lawyer to 
the appropriate authority, agency, or body.  See Rule 2.16.

RULE  2.16  -  RESPONDING  TO  JUDICIAL  AND  LAWYER 
MISCONDUCT

(A) A  judge  having  knowledge*  that  another  judge  has  committed  a 
violation of this Code that raises a substantial question regarding the 
judge’s honesty, trustworthiness, or ﬁ tness as a judge in other respects 
shall inform the appropriate authority.*
(B) A judge having knowledge that a lawyer has committed a violation 
of the Rules of Professional Conduct that raises a substantial question 
regarding the lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness, or ﬁ tness as a lawyer 
in other respects shall inform the appropriate authority.
(C) A judge who receives information indicating a substantial likelihood 
that  another  judge  has  committed  a  violation  of  this  Code  shall  take 
appropriate action.
(D) A judge who receives information indicating a substantial likelihood 
that  a  lawyer  has  committed  a  violation  of  the  Rules  of  Professional 
Conduct shall take appropriate action.

COMMENT
[1] Taking action to address known misconduct is a judge’s obligation.  
Paragraphs (A) and (B) impose an obligation on the judge to report to 
the appropriate disciplinary authority the known misconduct of another 
judge or a lawyer that raises a substantial question regarding the honesty, 
trustworthiness, or ﬁ tness of that judge or lawyer.  Ignoring or denying 
known misconduct among one’s judicial colleagues or members of the 
legal  profession  undermines  a  judge’s  responsibility  to  participate  in 
efforts to ensure public respect for the justice system.  This Rule limits 
the reporting obligation to those offenses that an independent judiciary 
must vigorously endeavor to prevent.
[2] A judge who does not have actual knowledge that another judge or 
a lawyer may have committed misconduct, but receives information 

indicating a substantial likelihood of such misconduct, is required to take 
appropriate action under paragraphs (C) and (D).  Appropriate action may 
include, but is not limited to, communicating directly with the judge who 
may have violated this Code, communicating with a supervising judge, 
or reporting the suspected violation to the appropriate authority or other 
agency or body.  Similarly, actions to be taken in response to information 
indicating that a lawyer has committed a violation of the Rules of 
Professional Conduct may include, but are not limited to, 
communicating  directly  with  the  lawyer  who  may  have  committed  the 
violation, or reporting the suspected violation to the appropriate authority 
or other agency or body.

RULE 2.17 - COOPERATION WITH DISCIPLINARY 
AUTHORITIES

(A) A judge shall cooperate and be candid and honest with judicial and 
lawyer disciplinary agencies.
(B) A  judge  shall  not  retaliate,  directly  or  indirectly,  against  a  person 
known* or suspected to have assisted or cooperated with an 
investigation of a judge or a lawyer.

COMMENT
[1] Cooperation with investigations and proceedings of judicial and lawyer 
discipline agencies, as required in paragraph (A), instills conﬁ dence in 
judges’ commitment to the integrity of the judicial system and the 
protection of the public.

CANON 3

A JUDGE SHALL CONDUCT THE JUDGE’S PERSONAL AND EXTRA-
JUDICIAL ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF CONFLICT WITH 
THE OBLIGATIONS OF JUDICIAL OFFICE.
RULE 3.1 - EXTRAJUDICIAL ACTIVITIES IN GENERAL

A judge may engage in extrajudicial activities, except as prohibited by 
law* or this Code.  However, when engaging in extrajudicial activities, 
a judge shall not:

(A) participate in activities that will interfere with the proper performance 
of the judge’s judicial duties;
(B)  participate  in  activities  that  will  lead  to  frequent  disqualiﬁ cation  of 
the judge;
(C) participate in activities that would appear to a reasonable person to 
undermine the judge’s independence,* integrity,* or impartiality;*
(D) engage in conduct that would appear to a reasonable person to be 
coercive; or
(E) make use of court premises, staff, stationery, equipment, or other 
resources, except for incidental use for activities that concern the law, the 
legal system, or the administration of justice, or unless such additional 
use is permitted by law.

COMMENT
[1]  To  the  extent  that  time  permits,  and  judicial  independence  and 
impartiality  are  not  compromised,  judges  are  encouraged  to  engage 
in appropriate extrajudicial activities.  Judges are uniquely qualiﬁ ed to 
engage in extrajudicial activities that concern the law, the legal system, 
and the administration of justice, such as by speaking, writing, teaching, 
or participating in scholarly research projects.  In addition, judges are 
permitted and encouraged to engage in educational, religious, charitable, 
fraternal,  or  civic  extrajudicial  activities  not  conducted  for  proﬁ t,  even 
when the activities do not involve the law.  See Rule 3.7.
[2] Participation in both law-related and other extrajudicial activities helps 
integrate judges into their communities, and furthers public understanding 
of and respect for courts and the judicial system.
[3]  Discriminatory  actions  and  expressions  of  bias  or  prejudice  by  a 
judge, even outside the judge’s ofﬁ cial or judicial actions, are likely to 
appear to a reasonable person to call into question the judge’s integrity 
and impartiality.  Examples include jokes or other remarks that demean 
individuals based upon their race, sex, gender, religion, national origin, 
ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status.  For 
the same reason, a judge’s extrajudicial activities must not be conducted 
in connection or afﬁ liation with an organization that practices invidious 
discrimination.  See Rule 3.6.
[4] While engaged in permitted extrajudicial activities, judges must not 
coerce  others  or  take  action  that  would  reasonably  be  perceived  as 

coercive.  For example, depending upon the circumstances, a judge’s 
solicitation of contributions or memberships for an organization, even as 
permitted by Rule 3.7(A), might create the risk that the person solicited 
would feel obligated to respond favorably, or would do so to curry favor 
with the judge.

RULE 3.2 - APPEARANCES BEFORE GOVERNMENTAL BODIES 
AND CONSULTATION WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS

A judge shall not appear voluntarily at a public hearing before, or 
otherwise  consult  with,  an  executive  or  a  legislative  body  or  ofﬁ cial, 
except:

(A) in connection with matters concerning the law,* the legal system, or 
the administration of justice;
(B) in connection with matters about which the judge acquired knowledge* 
or expertise in the course of the judge’s judicial duties; or
(C) when the judge is self-representing in a matter involving the judge’s 
legal or economic interests,* or when the judge is acting in a ﬁ duciary* 
capacity.

COMMENT
[1] Judges possess special expertise in matters of law, the legal system, 
and the administration of justice, and may properly share that expertise 
with governmental bodies and executive or legislative branch ofﬁ cials.
[2] In appearing before governmental bodies or consulting with 
government ofﬁ cials, judges must be mindful that they remain subject to 
other provisions of this Code, such as Rule 1.3, prohibiting judges from 
using the prestige of ofﬁ ce to advance their own or others’ interests, Rule 
2.11, governing public comment on pending and impending matters, and 
Rule 3.1(C), prohibiting judges from engaging in extrajudicial activities 
that  would  appear  to  a  reasonable  person  to  undermine  the  judge’s 
independence, integrity, or impartiality.
[3] In general, it would be an unnecessary and unfair burden to prohibit 
judges from appearing before governmental bodies or consulting with 
government ofﬁ cials on matters that are likely to affect them as private 
citizens, such as zoning proposals affecting their real property.  In 
engaging in such activities, however, judges must not refer to their 
judicial positions, and must otherwise exercise caution to avoid using 
the prestige of judicial ofﬁ ce.
RULE 3.3 - TESTIFYING AS  CHARACTER WITNESS

A judge shall not testify as a character witness in a judicial, administrative, 
or other adjudicatory proceeding or otherwise vouch for the character of 
a person in a legal proceeding, except when duly summoned.

COMMENT
[1] A  judge  who,  without  being  subpoenaed,  testiﬁ es  as  a  character 
witness abuses the prestige of judicial ofﬁ ce to advance the interests 
of another.  See Rule 1.3.  Except in unusual circumstances where the 
demands  of  justice  require,  a  judge  should  discourage  a  party  from 
requiring the judge to testify as a character witness.
RULE 3.4 - APPOINTMENTS TO GOVERNMENTAL POSITIONS

A judge shall not accept appointment to a governmental committee, board, 
commission, or other governmental position, unless it is one that concerns 
the law,* the legal system, or the administration of justice.

COMMENT
[1] Rule 3.4 implicitly acknowledges the value of judges accepting 
appointments to entities that concern the law, the legal system, or the 
administration of justice.  Even in such instances, however, a judge should 
assess the appropriateness of accepting an appointment, 
paying particular attention to the subject matter of the appointment and 
the availability and allocation of judicial resources, including the judge’s 
time  commitments,  and  giving  due  regard  to  the  requirements  of  the 
independence and impartiality of the judiciary.
[2] A judge may represent his or her country, state, or locality on 
ceremonial  occasions  or  in  connection  with  historical,  educational,  or 
cultural activities.  Such representation does not constitute acceptance 
of a government position.
RULE 3.5 - USE OF NONPUBLIC INFORMATION
A  judge  shall  not  intentionally  disclose  or  use  nonpublic  information* 
known* or acquired in a judicial capacity for any purpose in contravention 
of or unrelated to the judge’s judicial duties.

COMMENT
[1] A judge is, by deﬁ nition, uniquely privy to the inclination of the court 
to resolve a matter or issue pending before it in a particular manner.  A 
judge shall not, under any circumstances, disclose such information to a 
third party in advance of the court’s release of its decision.  With respect 
to the parties in the case, a judge shall not disclose such information to a 
party or counsel unless the court simultaneously shares such information 
openly with all parties to the proceeding.
[2] In the course of performing judicial duties, a judge may acquire 
information of commercial or other value that is unavailable to the public.  
The judge must not reveal or use such information for personal gain or 
for any purpose unrelated to his or her judicial duties.
[3] This rule is not intended, however, to affect a judge’s ability to act on 
information as necessary to protect the health or safety of the judge or 
a member of a judge’s family, court personnel, or other judicial ofﬁ cers 
if consistent with other provisions of this Code.

RULE 3.6 - AFFILIATION WITH DISCRIMINATORY 
ORGANIZATIONS

(A) A judge shall not hold membership in any organization that practices 
invidious discrimination on the basis of race, sex, gender, religion, national 
origin, ethnicity, or sexual orientation.
(B) A judge shall not use the beneﬁ ts or facilities of an organization if the 
judge knows* or should know that the organization practices invidious 
discrimination on one or more of the bases identiﬁ ed in paragraph (A).  
A judge’s attendance at an event in a facility of an organization that the 
judge is not permitted to join is not a violation of this Rule when the judge’s 
attendance is an isolated event that could not reasonably be perceived 
as an endorsement of the organization’s practices.
(C) A judge’s membership in a religious organization as a lawful exercise 
of the freedom of religion is not a violation of this Rule.  This Rule does 
not apply to national or state military service.

COMMENT
[1] A judge’s public manifestation of approval of invidious discrimination 
on any basis gives rise to the appearance of impropriety and diminishes 
public conﬁ dence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.  A judge’s 
membership  in  an  organization  that  practices  invidious  discrimination 
creates the perception that the judge’s impartiality is impaired.
[2] An organization is generally said to discriminate invidiously if it 
arbitrarily excludes from membership on the basis of race, sex, gender, 
religion, national origin, ethnicity, or sexual orientation persons who would 
otherwise be eligible for admission.  Whether an organization practices 
invidious discrimination is a complex question to which judges should be 
attentive.  The answer cannot be determined from a mere 
examination of an organization’s current membership rolls, but rather, 
depends upon how the organization selects members, as well as other 
relevant factors, such as whether the organization is dedicated to the 
preservation of religious, ethnic, or cultural values of legitimate 
common interest to its members, or whether it is an intimate, purely private 
organization whose membership limitations could not 
constitutionally be prohibited.
[3] When a judge learns that an organization to which the judge belongs 
engages in invidious discrimination, the judge must resign immediately 
from the organization.

RULE 3.7 - PARTICIPATION IN EDUCATIONAL, RELIGIOUS, 
CHARITABLE,  FRATERNAL,  OR  CIVIL  ORGANIZATIONS  AND 
ACTIVITIES
(A) Subject to the requirements of Rule 3.1, a judge may participate in 
activities sponsored by organizations or governmental entities concerned 
with the law,* the legal system, or the administration of justice, and those 
sponsored by or on behalf of educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, 
or civic organizations not conducted for proﬁ t, including but not limited 
to the following activities:
 
(1)  assisting  such  an  organization  or  entity  in  planning  related  to 
fund-raising, and participating in the management and investment of the 
organization’s or entity’s funds;
 
(2)  soliciting*  contributions*  for  such  an  organization  or  entity,  but 
only from members of the judge’s family,* or from judges over whom the 
judge does not exercise supervisory or appellate authority;
(3) appearing or speaking at, receiving an award or other recognition 
 
at, being featured on the program of, and permitting his or her title to be 

used in connection with a non-fund-raising event of such an organization 
or entity;
 
(4) serving as an ofﬁ cer, director, trustee, or nonlegal advisor of such 
an organization or entity, unless it is likely that the organization or entity:
(a) will be engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come 

before the judge; or

(b)  will  frequently  be  engaged  in  adversary  proceedings  in 
the court of which the judge is a member, or in any court subject to the 
appellate jurisdiction of the court of which the judge is a member.
 
(5)  soliciting  membership  for  such  an  organization  or  entity,  even 
though the membership dues or fees generated may be used to support 
the objectives of the organization or entity, but only if the organization or 
entity is concerned with the law, the legal system, or the administration 
of justice;
 
(6) making recommendations to such a public or private fund-granting 
organization or entity in connection with its programs and activities, but 
only  if  the  organization  or  entity  is  concerned  with  the  law,  the  legal 
system, or the administration of justice; and
 
(7) appearing or speaking at, receiving an award or other recognition 
at, being featured on the program of, and permitting her or his title to be 
used in connection with a fund-raising event of an organization which 
concerns the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice.
(B) A judge may encourage lawyers to provide pro bono publico legal 
services.

COMMENT
[1]  The  activities  permitted  by  paragraph  (A)  generally  include  those 
sponsored by or undertaken on behalf of public or private not-for-proﬁ t 
educational institutions, and other not-for-proﬁ t organizations, including 
law-related, charitable, and other organizations.  The activities 
permitted  by  paragraph  (A)  do  not  include  those  sponsored  by  or  on 
behalf of organizations which have as a primary purpose advocating in 
political processes for or against change in the laws related to limited 
subject areas.  Activities relating to such political advocacy organizations 
are subject to the requirements of Rule 3.1, as well as Canon 4 and the 
Rules thereunder.
[2] Even for law-related organizations, a judge should consider whether 
the membership and purposes of the organization, or the nature of the 
judge’s participation in or association with the organization, would conﬂ ict 
with the judge’s obligation to refrain from activities that reﬂ ect adversely 
upon a judge’s independence, integrity, and impartiality.
[3] Mere attendance at an event, whether or not the event serves a 
fund-raising purpose, does not constitute a violation of paragraph (A).  
It  is  also  generally  permissible  for  a  judge  to  serve  as  an  usher  or  a 
food server or preparer, or to perform similar functions, at fund-raising 
events sponsored by educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, or civic 
organizations.  Such activities are not solicitation and do not present an 
element of coercion or abuse the prestige of judicial ofﬁ ce.
[4] Identiﬁ cation of a judge’s position in educational, religious, charitable, 
fraternal,  or  civic  organizations  on  letterhead  used  for  fund-raising  or 
membership solicitation does not violate this Rule if comparable 
designations are used for other persons.
[5] In addition to appointing lawyers to serve as counsel for indigent 
parties  in  individual  cases,  a  judge  may  promote  broader  access  to 
justice by encouraging lawyers to participate in pro bono publico legal 
services, if in doing so the judge does not employ coercion, or abuse the 
prestige of judicial ofﬁ ce.
[6]  Subject  to  the  requirements  of  Rule  3.1  and  paragraph  (A),  a 
judge may provide leadership in improving equal access to the justice 
system;  developing  public  education  programs;  engaging  in  outreach 
activities  to  promote  the  fair  administration  of  justice;  and  convening 
and participating in advisory committees and community collaborations 
devoted to the improvement of the law, the legal system, the provision 
of legal services, and/or the administration of justice.
RULE 3.8 - APPOINTMENTS TO FIDUCIARY POSITIONS 

(A) A judge shall not accept appointment to serve in a ﬁ duciary* 
position,  such  as  executor,  administrator,  trustee,  guardian,  attorney 
in fact, or other personal representative, except for the estate, trust, or 
person of a member of the judge’s family,* and then only if such service 
will not interfere with the proper performance of judicial duties.
(B) A judge shall not serve in a ﬁ duciary position if the judge as ﬁ duciary 
will likely be engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come before 
the judge, or if the estate, trust, or ward becomes involved in adversary 
proceedings  in  the  court  on  which  the  judge  serves,  or  one  under  its 

appellate jurisdiction.
(C) A judge acting in a ﬁ duciary capacity shall be subject to the same 
restrictions  on  engaging  in  ﬁ nancial  activities  that  apply  to  a  judge 
personally.
(D) If a person who is serving in a ﬁ duciary position becomes a judge, 
he or she must comply with this Rule as soon as reasonably practicable, 
but in no event later than one year after becoming a judge.

COMMENT
[1] A  judge  should  recognize  that  other  restrictions  imposed  by  this 
Code  may  conﬂ ict  with  a  judge’s  obligations  as  a  ﬁ duciary;  in  such 
circumstances, a judge should resign as ﬁ duciary.  For example, serving 
as  a  ﬁ duciary  might  require  frequent  disqualiﬁ cation  of  a  judge  under 
Rule 2.12 because a judge is deemed to have an economic interest in 
shares of stock held by a trust if the amount of stock held is more than de 
minimis.  This Rule does not prohibit a judge from assuming guardianship 
of a minor child, as authorized by law.
RULE 3.9 - SERVICE AS ARBITRATOR OR MEDIATOR
A  judge  shall  not  act  as  an  arbitrator  or  a  mediator  or  perform  other 
judicial functions apart from the judge’s ofﬁ cial duties unless expressly 
authorized by law.*

COMMENT
[1] A “judge’s ofﬁ cial duties” may include acting as a mediator in a case 
pending before another judge.
RULE 3.10 - PRACTICE OF LAW
(A) A  judge  authorized  by  law  to  engage  in  the  practice  of  law*  must 
scrupulously avoid conduct in the practice of law which may create a 
conﬂ ict with judicial duties or create the appearance of impropriety.*  If a 
conﬂ ict arises between the judge’s obligations as judge and the private 
practice of law, the judge shall resolve the conﬂ ict in such a way that 
accomplishes the fulﬁ llment of judicial duties.  
(B) A  judge  may  self-represent  and  may,  without  compensation,  give 
legal  advice  to  and  draft  or  review  documents  for  a  member  of  the 
judge’s  family,*  but  is  prohibited  from  serving  as  the  family  member’s 
lawyer in any forum.

COMMENT
[1] A  judge  may  self-represent  in  all  legal  matters,  including  matters 
involving  litigation  and  matters  involving  appearances  before  or  other 
dealings with governmental bodies.  A judge must not use the prestige of 
ofﬁ ce to advance the judge’s personal or family interests.  See Rule 1.3.

RULE 3.11 - FINANCIAL, BUSINESS,  OR REMUNERATIVE 
ACTIVITIES

(A) A judge may hold and manage investments of the judge and members 
of the judge’s family.*
(B) A  judge  shall  not  serve  as  an  ofﬁ cer,  director,  manager,  general 
partner, advisor, or employee of any business entity except that a judge 
may manage or participate in:
 
family; or
 
resources of the judge or members of the judge’s family.
(C) A judge shall not engage in ﬁ nancial activities permitted under 
paragraphs (A) and (B) if they will:

(2) a business entity primarily engaged in investment of the ﬁ nancial 

(1) a business closely held by the judge or members of the judge’s 

(1) interfere with the proper performance of judicial duties;
(2) lead to frequent disqualiﬁ cation of the judge;
(3) involve the judge in frequent transactions or continuing business 
relationships with lawyers or other persons likely to come before the court 
on which the judge serves; or

(4) result in violation of other provisions of this Code.

COMMENT
[1]  Judges  are  generally  permitted  to  engage  in  ﬁ nancial  activities, 
including  managing  real  estate  and  other  investments  for  themselves 
or  for  members  of  their  families.    Participation  in  these  activities,  like 
participation in other extrajudicial activities, is subject to the requirements 
of this Code.  For example, it would be improper for a judge to spend so 
much time on business activities that it interferes with the performance 
of judicial duties.  See Rule 2.1.  Similarly, it would be improper for a 
judge to use his or her ofﬁ cial title or appear in judicial robes in business 

advertising, or to conduct his or her business or ﬁ nancial affairs in such a 
way that disqualiﬁ cation is frequently required.  See Rules 1.3 and 2.12.
[2] As soon as practicable without serious ﬁ nancial detriment, the judge 
must divest himself or herself of investments and other ﬁ nancial interests 
that might require frequent disqualiﬁ cation or otherwise violate this Rule.

RULE 3.12 - COMPENSATION FOR EXTRAJUDICIAL 
ACTIVITIES

A judge may accept reasonable compensation for extrajudicial activities 
permitted by this Code or other law* unless such acceptance would 
appear to a reasonable person to undermine the judge’s independence,* 
integrity,* or impartiality.*

RULE  3.13  - ACCEPTANCE  AND  REPORTING  OF  GIFTS, 
LOANS, BEQUESTS, BENEFITS, OR OTHER THINGS OF VALUE

(A) A judge shall not accept any gifts, loans, bequests, beneﬁ ts, or other 
things of value, if acceptance is prohibited by law* or would appear to a 
reasonable person to undermine the judge’s independence,* integrity,* 
or impartiality.*
(B) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, or by paragraph (A), a judge may 
accept the following:
 
trophies, and greeting cards;
 
(2)  gifts,  loans,  bequests,  beneﬁ ts,  or  other  things  of  value  from 
friends, relatives, or other persons, including lawyers, whose appearance 
or interest in a proceeding pending* or impending* before the judge would 
in any event require disqualiﬁ cation of the judge under Rule 2.12;

(1)  items  with  little  intrinsic  value,  such  as  plaques,  certiﬁ cates, 

(3) ordinary social hospitality;
 
(4)  commercial  or  ﬁ nancial  opportunities  and  beneﬁ ts,  including 
special pricing and discounts, and loans from lending institutions in their 
regular course of business, if the same opportunities and beneﬁ ts or loans 
are made available on the same terms to similarly situated persons who 
are not judges;

(5) rewards and prizes given to competitors or participants in random 
drawings, contests, or other events that are open to persons who are not 
judges;

(6) scholarships, fellowships, and similar beneﬁ ts or awards:

(a) related to training in the law, the legal system or the 

administration of justice; or

(b) available to similarly situated persons who are not judges, 

based on the same terms and criteria;
 
(7)  books,  magazines,  journals,  audiovisual  materials,  and  other 
resource materials supplied by publishers on a complimentary basis for 
ofﬁ cial use;
 
(8) gifts, awards, or beneﬁ ts associated with the business, profession, 
or other separate activity of a spouse, a domestic partner,* or other family 
member of a judge residing in the judge’s household,* but that incidentally 
beneﬁ t the judge;

(9) gifts incident to a public testimonial; and
(10) invitations to the judge and the judge’s spouse, domestic partner, 

or guest to attend without charge:

(a) an event associated with a bar-related function or other 
activity relating to the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice; 
or

(b) an event associated with any of the judge’s educational, 
religious, charitable, fraternal, or civic activities permitted by this Code, 
if the same invitation is offered to nonjudges who are engaged in similar 
ways in the activity as is the judge.

COMMENT
[1] Whenever a judge accepts a gift or other thing of value without 
paying fair market value, there is a risk that the beneﬁ t might be viewed as 
intended to inﬂ uence the judge’s decision in a case.  Gift-giving between 
friends and relatives is a common occurrence, and ordinarily does not 
create  an  appearance  of  impropriety  or  cause  reasonable  persons  to 
believe that the judge’s independence, integrity, or impartiality has been 
compromised.  In addition, when the appearance of friends or relatives in 
a case would require the judge’s disqualiﬁ cation under Rule 2.12, there 
would be no opportunity for a gift to inﬂ uence the judge’s decision making.
[2] Businesses and ﬁ nancial institutions frequently make available 
special pricing, discounts, and other beneﬁ ts, either in connection with a 
temporary promotion or for preferred customers, based upon longevity 
of the relationship, volume of business transacted, and other factors.  A 

judge may freely accept such beneﬁ ts if they are available to the general 
public, or if the judge qualiﬁ es for the special price or discount according 
to the same criteria as are applied to persons who are not judges.  As an 
example, loans provided at generally prevailing interest rates are not gifts, 
but a judge could not accept a loan from a ﬁ nancial institution at below-
market interest rates unless the same rate was being made available to 
the general public for a certain period of time or only to borrowers with 
speciﬁ ed qualiﬁ cations that the judge also possesses.
[3] Rule 3.13 applies only to acceptance of gifts or other things of value 
by a judge.  Nonetheless, if a gift or other beneﬁ t is given to the judge’s 
spouse, domestic partner, or member of the judge’s family residing in the 
judge’s household, it may be viewed as an attempt to evade Rule 3.13 
and inﬂ uence the judge indirectly.  Where the gift or beneﬁ t is being made 
primarily to such other persons, and the judge is merely an incidental 
beneﬁ ciary, this concern is reduced.  A judge should, however, remind 
family and household members of the restrictions imposed upon judges, 
and urge them to take these restrictions into account when making 
decisions about accepting such gifts or beneﬁ ts.
[4] Rule 3.13 does not apply to contributions to a judge’s campaign for 
judicial ofﬁ ce.  Such contributions are governed by other Rules of this 
Code.

RULE 3.14 - REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES AND 
WAIVERS OF FEES OR CHARGES

(A) Unless otherwise prohibited by Rules 3.1 and 3.13(A) or other law,* a 
judge may accept reimbursement of necessary and reasonable expenses 
for travel, food, lodging, or other incidental expenses, or a waiver or 
partial waiver of fees or charges for registration, tuition, and similar items, 
from sources other than the judge’s employing entity, if the expenses 
or charges are associated with the judge’s participation in extrajudicial 
activities permitted by this Code.
(B) Reimbursement of expenses for necessary travel, food, lodging, or 
other incidental expenses shall be limited to the actual costs reasonably 
incurred  by  the  judge  and,  when  appropriate  to  the  occasion,  by  the 
judge’s spouse, domestic partner,* or guest.

COMMENT
[1] Educational, civic, religious, fraternal, and charitable organizations 
often sponsor meetings, seminars, symposia, dinners, awards 
ceremonies, and similar events.  Judges are encouraged to attend 
educational programs, as both teachers and participants, in law-related 
and academic disciplines, in furtherance of their duty to remain competent 
in the law.  Participation in a variety of other extrajudicial activity is also 
permitted and encouraged by this Code.
[2]  Not  infrequently,  sponsoring  organizations  invite  certain  judges  to 
attend seminars or other events on a fee-waived or partial-fee-waived 
basis, and sometimes include reimbursement for necessary travel, food, 
lodging, or other incidental expenses.  A judge’s decision whether to 
accept reimbursement of expenses or a waiver or partial waiver of fees 
or charges in connection with these or other extrajudicial activities must 
be based upon an assessment of all the circumstances.  The judge must 
undertake a reasonable inquiry to obtain the information necessary to 
make an informed judgment about whether acceptance would be 
consistent with the requirements of this Code.
[3] A judge must assure himself or herself that acceptance of 
reimbursement or fee waivers would not appear to a reasonable person 
to  undermine  the  judge’s  independence,  integrity,  or  impartiality.   The 
factors that a judge should consider when deciding whether to accept 
reimbursement  or  a  fee  waiver  for  attendance  at  a  particular  activity 
include: 

(a) whether the sponsor is an accredited educational institution 

or bar association rather than a trade association or a for-proﬁ t entity; 

(b) whether the funding comes largely from numerous 

contributors rather than from a single entity and is earmarked for programs 
with speciﬁ c content; 

(c) whether the content is related or unrelated to the subject 
matter of litigation pending or impending before the judge, or to matters 
that are likely to come before the judge;

(d)  whether  the  activity  is  primarily  educational  rather  than 
recreational,  and  whether  the  costs  of  the  event  are  reasonable  and 
comparable to those associated with similar events sponsored by the 
judiciary, bar associations, or similar groups; 

(e) whether information concerning the activity and its funding 

sources is available upon inquiry; 

(f) whether the sponsor or source of funding is generally 

associated with particular parties or interests currently appearing or likely 
to appear in the judge’s court, thus possibly requiring disqualiﬁ cation of 
the judge under Rule 2.12;

COMMENT
General Considerations
[1] Even when subject to public election, a judge plays a role different 
from that of a legislator or executive branch ofﬁ cial.  Rather than 
making decisions based upon the expressed views or preferences of the 
electorate, a judge makes decisions based upon the law and the facts of 
every case.  Therefore, in furtherance of this interest, judges and judicial 
candidates must, to the greatest extent possible, be free and appear to be 
free from political inﬂ uence and political pressure.  This Canon imposes 
narrowly tailored restrictions upon the political and campaign activities 
of  all  judges  and  judicial  candidates,  taking  into  account  the  various 
methods of selecting judges.
[2] When a person becomes a judicial candidate, this Canon becomes 

applicable  to  his  or  her  conduct.    If  a  judicial  candidate  who  is  not  a 
judge violates this Canon and is elected, he or she may be referred to 
the Judicial Standards Commission for discipline on assuming ofﬁ ce.[3] 
Public conﬁ dence in the independence and impartiality of the judiciary 
is  eroded  if  judges  or  judicial  candidates  are  perceived  to  be  subject 
to political inﬂ uence.  Judges and judicial candidates are prohibited by 
paragraph (A)(1) from assuming leadership roles in political organizations.
[4] Paragraphs (A)(2) and (A)(3) prohibit judges and judicial candidates 
from  making  speeches  on  behalf  of  political  organizations  or  publicly 
endorsing or opposing partisan candidates for public ofﬁ ce, respectively, 
to prevent them from abusing the prestige of judicial ofﬁ ce to advance the 
interests of others.  See Rule 1.3.  These Rules do not prohibit candidates 
from campaigning on their own behalf, or from endorsing or opposing 
candidates for a judicial ofﬁ ce, because judges are in the unique position 
to know and share with interested persons the qualiﬁ cations of judicial 
candidates.  See Rule 4.2(B)(2) and (3).  However, note that while it is 
acceptable for candidates for judicial ofﬁ ce to seek and accept 
endorsements from another judge, and have the supportive judge attend 
the candidate’s dinners, judges are prohibited from soliciting or collecting 
money on their behalf.
[5] Although members of the families of judges and judicial candidates are 
free to engage in their own political activity, including running for public 
ofﬁ ce, there is no “family exception” to the prohibition in paragraph (A) 
(3) against a judge or candidate publicly endorsing candidates for public 
ofﬁ ce.   A  judge  or  judicial  candidate  must  not  become  involved  in,  or 
publicly associated with, a family member’s political activity or campaign 
for public ofﬁ ce.  To avoid public misunderstanding, judges and judicial 
candidates should take, and should urge members of their families to 
take, reasonable steps to avoid any implication that they endorse any 
family member’s candidacy or other political activity.
[6] Judges and judicial candidates retain the right to participate in the 
political process as voters in both primary and general elections.
Statements and Comments Made During a Campaign for Judicial 
Ofﬁ ce
[7] Judicial candidates must be scrupulously fair and accurate in all 
statements made by them and by their campaign committees.  Paragraph 
(A)(10) obligates candidates and their committees to refrain from making 
statements that are false or misleading, or that omit facts necessary to 
make the communication considered as a whole not materially misleading.
[8] Judicial candidates are sometimes the subject of false, misleading, 
or unfair allegations made by opposing candidates, third parties, or the 
media.    For  example,  false  or  misleading  statements  might  be  made 
regarding  the  identity,  present  position,  experience,  qualiﬁ cations,  or 
judicial rulings of a candidate.  In other situations, false or misleading 
allegations may be made that bear upon a candidate’s integrity or ﬁ tness 
for judicial ofﬁ ce.  As long as the candidate does not violate paragraphs 
(A)(10), (A)(11), or (A)(12), the candidate may make a factually accurate 
public response.  In addition, when an independent third party has made 
false attacks on a candidate’s opponent, the candidate should disavow 
the attacks, and request the third party to cease and desist.
[9]  Subject  to  paragraph  (A)(11),  a  judicial  candidate  is  permitted  to 
respond directly to false, misleading, or unfair allegations made against 
him or her during a campaign, although it is preferable for someone else 
to respond if the allegations relate to a pending case.
[10] Paragraph (A)(11) prohibits judicial candidates from making 
comments that might impair the fairness of pending or impending judicial 
proceedings.  This provision does not restrict arguments or statements 
to the court or jury by a lawyer who is a judicial candidate, or rulings, 
statements, or instructions by a judge that may appropriately affect the 
outcome of a matter.
Pledges,  Promises,  or  Commitments  Inconsistent  With  Impartial 
Performance of the Adjudicative Duties of Judicial Ofﬁ ce
[11] The role of a judge is different from that of a legislator or executive 
branch ofﬁ cial, even when the judge is subject to public election.  
Campaigns for judicial ofﬁ ce must be conducted differently from 
campaigns for other ofﬁ ces.  The narrowly drafted restrictions upon 
political and campaign activities of judicial candidates provided in Canon 4 
allow candidates to conduct campaigns that provide voters with sufﬁ cient 
information to permit them to distinguish between candidates and make 
informed electoral choices.
[12]  Paragraph  (A)(12)  makes  applicable  to  both  judges  and  judicial 
candidates the prohibition that applies to judges in Rule 2.11(B), 
relating to pledges, promises, or commitments that are inconsistent with 
the impartial performance of the adjudicative duties of judicial ofﬁ ce.
[13] The making of a pledge, promise, or commitment is not dependent 

ofﬁ ce-holder or candidate for public ofﬁ ce.
[4]  Judicial  candidates  are  permitted  to  attend  or  purchase  tickets  for 
dinners and other events sponsored by political organizations or judicial 
candidates, but not by partisan or other independent ofﬁ ce-holders or 
candidates for public ofﬁ ce.
[5]  In  endorsing  or  opposing  another  judicial  candidate,  the  judge  or 
judicial  candidate  doing  so  must  abide  by  the  same  rules  governing 
campaign conduct and speech as apply to the candidate’s own campaign.

RULE 4.3 - ACTIVITIES OF CANDIDATES FOR APPOINTIVE 
JUDICIAL OFFICE

A candidate for appointment to judicial ofﬁ ce may:
 
(A) communicate with the appointing or conﬁ rming authority, including 
any selection, screening, or nominating commission or similar agency; 
and
 
organization other than a political organization.*

(B)  seek  endorsements  for  the  appointment  from  any  person  or 

COMMENT
[1] When seeking support or endorsement, or when communicating 
directly with an appointing or conﬁ rming authority, a candidate for 
appointive judicial ofﬁ ce must not make any pledges, promises, or 
commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the 
adjudicative duties of the ofﬁ ce.  See Rule 4.1(A)(12).
RULE 4.4 - CAMPAIGN COMMITTEES
(A) A judicial candidate* subject to public election* may establish a 
campaign committee to manage and conduct a campaign for the 
candidate, subject to the provisions of this Code.  The candidate is 
responsible for ensuring that his or her campaign committee complies 
with applicable provisions of this Code and other applicable law.*
(B) A  judicial  candidate  who  establishes  a  campaign  committee  shall 
direct his or her campaign committee:
 
permitted by law;
 
in an amount or in a manner that is prohibited by law; and
 
(3) to comply with all applicable statutory requirements for disclosure 
and divestiture of campaign contributions, and to ﬁ le all reports required 
by law with the ofﬁ cial or agency prescribed by law.

(1) to solicit and accept only such campaign contributions* as are 

(2) not to solicit or accept contributions for a candidate’s campaign 

COMMENT
[1] This  Rule  recognizes  that  judicial  candidates  may  raise  campaign 
funds in an amount and in a manner permitted by law to support their 
candidacies, and permits candidates, other than candidates for 
appointive judicial ofﬁ ce, to solicit ﬁ nancial or in-kind campaign 
contributions personally or to establish campaign committees to solicit 
and accept such contributions.
[2] Campaign committees may solicit and accept campaign 
contributions, manage the expenditure of campaign funds, and generally 
conduct  campaigns.    Candidates  are  responsible  for  compliance  with 
the requirements of election law and other applicable law, and for the 
activities of their campaign committees.
[3] If a campaign committee is established, the candidate must instruct 
the campaign committee to solicit or accept contributions in conformity 
with applicable law.

upon, or limited to, the use of any speciﬁ c words or phrases; instead, the 
totality of the statement must be examined to determine if a reasonable 
person would believe that the candidate for judicial ofﬁ ce has speciﬁ cally 
undertaken to reach a particular result.  Pledges, promises, or 
commitments must be contrasted with statements or announcements of 
personal views on legal, political, or other issues, which are not 
prohibited.  When making such statements, a judge should acknowledge 
the overarching judicial obligation to apply and uphold the law, without 
regard to his or her personal views.
[14] A judicial candidate may make campaign promises related to judicial 
organization, administration, and court management, such as a promise 
to dispose of a backlog of cases, start court sessions on time, or avoid 
favoritism in appointments and hiring.  A candidate may also pledge to 
take action outside the courtroom, such as working toward an improved 
jury selection system, or advocating for more funds to improve the 
physical plant and amenities of the courthouse.
[15]  Judicial  candidates  may  receive  questionnaires  or  requests  for 
interviews from the media and from issue advocacy or other community 
organizations that seek to learn their views on disputed or controversial 
legal or political issues.  Paragraph (A)(12) does not speciﬁ cally address 
judicial responses to such inquiries.  Depending upon the wording and 
format of such questionnaires, candidates’ responses might be viewed as 
pledges, promises, or commitments to perform the adjudicative duties of 
ofﬁ ce other than in an impartial way.  To avoid violating paragraph (A)(12), 
therefore, candidates who respond to media and other inquiries should 
also give assurances that they will keep an open mind and will carry out 
their adjudicative duties faithfully and impartially if elected.  Candidates 
who do not respond may state their reasons for not responding, such as 
the danger that answering might be perceived by a reasonable person 
as undermining a successful candidate’s independence or impartiality, or 
that it might lead to frequent disqualiﬁ cation.  See Rule 2.12.

RULE  4.2  -  POLITICAL  AND  CAMPAIGN  ACTIVITIES  OF 
JUDICIAL CANDIDATES IN PUBLIC ELECTIONS

(1) act at all times in a manner consistent with the independence,* 

(A) A judicial candidate* shall:
 
integrity,* and impartiality* of the judiciary;
 
(2) comply with all applicable election, election campaign, and 
election campaign fund-raising laws* and regulations of this jurisdiction;
 
(3) review and approve the content of all campaign statements and 
materials produced by the candidate or his or her campaign committee, 
as authorized by Rule 4.4, before their dissemination; and
 
(4) take objectively reasonable measures to ensure that other 
persons  do  not  undertake  on  behalf  of  the  candidate  activities,  other 
than those described in Rule 4.4, that the candidate is prohibited from 
doing by Rule 4.1.
(B) A candidate for elective judicial ofﬁ ce may, unless prohibited by law:
 
(1) establish a campaign committee pursuant to the provisions of 
Rule 4.4;
 
(2) speak on behalf of his or her candidacy through any medium, 
including but not limited to advertisements, websites, or other campaign 
literature;

(3) publicly support or oppose candidates for judicial ofﬁ ce;
(4) attend or purchase tickets for dinners or other events sponsored 

 
by a political organization* or a candidate for judicial ofﬁ ce;

(5) seek, accept, or use endorsements from any person or 

organization other than a partisan political organization or partisan* or 
independent* ofﬁ ce-holder or candidate for non-judicial public ofﬁ ce; and
 
(6) contribute to a candidate for judicial ofﬁ ce, but not more than the 
amount prescribed by law.

COMMENT
[1] Paragraph (B) permits judicial candidates in public elections to engage 
in some political and campaign activities otherwise prohibited by Rule 4.1.
[2] Despite paragraph (B), judicial candidates for public election remain 
subject to many of the provisions of Rule 4.1.  For example, a candidate 
continues to be prohibited from soliciting funds for a political organization, 
or any partisan or independent ofﬁ ce-holder or candidate for public ofﬁ ce, 
from knowingly making false or misleading statements during a campaign, 
or making certain promises, pledges, or commitments related to future 
adjudicative duties.  See Rule 4.1(A), subparagraphs (4), (10), and (12).
[3] In judicial elections, paragraph (B)(5) prohibits a candidate from 
seeking, accepting, or using nominations or endorsements from a partisan 
political organization or a partisan or independent non-judicial
