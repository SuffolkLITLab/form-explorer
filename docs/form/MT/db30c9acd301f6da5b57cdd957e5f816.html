Health Care Power of Attorney

END-OF-LIFE AND HEALTH CARE DECISIONS ARE PERSONAL. They are based upon our family and life 
experiences, spiritual and religious beliefs, and knowledge gained throughout life. You may have shared feelings 
about medical and end-of-life issues with your health care providers, family and friends. However, when it 
comes to the legalities surrounding formal decision-making, talking simply isn’t enough. If you should become 
incapacitated or have difficulty communicating when a decision needs to be made, your health care wishes need 
to be in writing. Written legal documents will ensure your wishes are followed by those making decisions with 
and for you. 

One challenge often encountered is the difference in terminology used by the legal profession and health care 
providers. Many of us have heard about or seen different forms on the Web, in hospitals or physicians’offices. Some 
documents are the latest versions, while others may not be recognized by health care providers. The documents 
may also not adequately communicate your wishes.

To address these concerns, several organizations have collaborated to develop a model Health Care Power 
of Attorney (Form A) for Montanans. They have also created two optional forms (Form B and Form C) along 
with a worksheet. These forms should be used to appoint health care agent(s) and assist others in understanding 
your health care preferences. 

This publication specifically explains a Health Care Power of Attorney for Montanans. For information about a 
financial power of attorney, see the MSU Extension MontGuide “Power of Attorney (Financial)” (MT199001HR) 
available from your local MSU Extension office.

Forms
Worksheet. The purpose of the worksheet is to provide 
questions that, when answered, help you, your agent, 
family, health care providers, and others who are in-
volved, to make decisions about your health care. You 
may want to complete the worksheet before designating 
a health care agent or before making end of life decisions.
Form  A. This  form  is  a  model  Health  Care 
Power of Attorney. The form provides a formal, legal 
way to appoint your health care agent(s) to assist 
you and make health care decisions for you. The 
form also provides information to your agent(s) 
about  your  health  care  and  end-of-life  wishes.  

       Forms B and C. Montanans who want to provide 
additional directions to their families about specific 
health care treatments and related decisions will want 
to complete these forms.

Forms B and C are optional. If you do not fill them 
out, your agent still has authority to make treatment 
decisions based on your Health Care Power of Attorney.

Instructions for Form A
The following pages describe sections of the model 
Health Care Power of Attorney (Form A). After you 
have filled out and signed Form A, your Health Care 
Power of Attorney becomes a legal document. 

 

Health Care Power of Attorney | 3

1 Appointment of  

an Agent 

Identify yourself and your agent. Appointing an agent to 
act as your health care power of attorney is an important 
decision. If you want your spouse to be your agent, 
identify him/her in this section. Write your spouse’s 
full legal name, not a nickname. Do not use social 
titles, for example, my wife, my husband, or my spouse. 

2 Appointment of  

Back-up Agent(s)

Identify your back-up agents. In case your agent is 
unable to perform his/her duties, naming a back-up 
agent is a good idea. As an example, your agent could 
become ill or be traveling outside the United States 
when you need him/her to make a health-related 
decision. If you want an adult child or a close friend 
to be a back-up agent, list the name of each person 
in order of priority. 

You may cancel (revoke) the authority of your 
agent or back-up agent at any time. You may revoke 
your health care power of attorney either in writing, 
signed by you or by a verbal statement in the presence 
of a person relying on the revocation, such as telling 
your physician or nurse, “I revoke my health care 
power of attorney.” 

Your revocation is effective after individuals who 
rely on your Health Care Power of Attorney see your 
revocation in writing or hear you revoke your power 
of attorney. After you revoke your Health Care Power 
of Attorney, your agent will no longer have authority 
to make health care decisions for you.

3   Agent’s Authority  

and Obligations 

Describe your agent’s authority. Your agent should 
make decisions about your health care based on your 
wishes and best interests. Once your agent’s authority 
is effective, he/she can act on your behalf about any 
health matters you have listed. Your agent can receive 

and disclose information about your health condition 
to others. Your agent can talk with your physician and 
other health care providers, as well as staff in insurance, 
billing, and medical records on your behalf. 

A Health Care Power of Attorney gives your agent 
authorization to act for you under the state and federal 
law, including the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act, commonly called HIPAA. 

4 When An Agent’s  

Authority Becomes Effective

Decide when your agent’s authority to take actions 
for you becomes effective. You have two options. On 
Form A choose ONLY Option A or Option B. 

CHOOSING OPTION A
Option A makes your agent’s authority effective as 
soon as you sign the document. 
1.   Allows your agent to take actions for you imme-
diately, without having to prove you are incapable of 
making your own health care decisions.
2.   Allows your agent to have the authority to help 
you, even while you are able to make your own health 
care decisions. You always keep the ability to make 
your own health care decisions, for as long as you 
want and are able.
3.   Means your agent will not have to ask a physician, 
other health care provider, or person designated by 
you whether you are incapable of making health care 
decisions before the appointment becomes effective.
4. 
 Makes it clear to health care providers and in-
surance company personnel your agent has authority 
to take actions, even if the health care provider or 
insurance company does not know whether you are 
able to make your own health decisions. 
5.   Allows personnel from an insurance company 
or a billing or medical records office or your health 
care  provider  to  speak  with  your  agent  (includ-
ing over the telephone), without knowing if you 
are able to make your own health care decisions.  

4 | Health Care Power of Attorney

6.   Allows your agent to receive information about 
your health care when you want help scheduling 
appointments, doing what the physician asks you to  
do, moving between physicians, understanding and 
paying medical bills, getting medications, and other 
similar matters. 

CHOOSING OPTION B
Option B makes your agent’s authority effective 
only when you are not able to make health care 
decisions for yourself. 

Your primary care or attending physician, advanced 
practice registered nurse or other person designated by 
you is the one to determine whether you are capable 
of making health care decisions for yourself. 

Until such a determination is made, health care 
providers and health plans will be prohibited by state 
and federal laws, including HIPAA, from disclosing 
health care information about you to your designated 
agent (except in limited circumstances), unless you 
sign a separate written authorization for the agent. 

Do not choose Option B if you want your agent’s 
authority to be effective during periods when it is 
unclear whether you are capable of making your own 
health care decisions. Such situations may include being 
under the influence of strong medications, when you 
are experiencing pain or stress, or when dementia or 
a mental illness worsens.

5 Guidance and  

Preferences

Provide additional directions to your agent. Express 
guidance and your preferences about specific matters of 
health care treatments and other decisions not covered 
on Forms A, B, or C.

6 Nomination of  

Legal Guardian 

Nominate your chosen agent or a back-up agent as your 
legal guardian. Nominating a guardian is important if 
it becomes necessary for the district court to appoint a 
legal guardian for you. Your guardian makes additional 
decisions for you such as living arrangements. Your 

nominated guardian has priority over other persons 
for appointment by the district court as your guardian.

7 Determination of My  

Capacity to Make Decisions

Indicate who has authority to determine your ability 
to make your own decisions. This section allows 
you to designate one or more persons to determine 
whether you are capable of making your own health 
care decisions. You may grant such authority to your 
primary care physician, attending physician or ad-
vanced practice registered nurse. If you prefer to grant 
“capability” authority to your spouse, adult, child, or 
other trusted person, ask an attorney to explain the 
pros and cons of allowing a person without medical 
training to make the determination. 

8 Administrative  

Provisions

Enforcement of your Health Care Power of Attorney. 
This section covers miscellaneous issues such as the 
validity of the form in other states, compensation for 
services for your agent(s), and how to revoke a Health 
Care Power of Attorney you signed previously.

9 Instructions for  

Forms B and C. 

Optional Forms B and C provide additional information 
that could be relevant to you and your family members. 
On Form B, you indicate the termination or con-
tinuation of life-sustaining treatment which is your 
right under the Montana Rights of the Terminally Ill 
Act. For additional information about this Act, see 
MSU Extension MontGuide “Montana Rights of the 
Terminally Ill Act” (MT199202HR).

Form C allows you to provide additional instruc-
tions about religious preference and preferred place 
of death. You may provide how you want your body 
disposed of (e.g. burial, cremation) under the Montana 
Rights of Disposition Act. For information about this 
Act, see MSU Extension MontGuide “What Are Your 
Rights Over Your Remains?” (MT200918HR).

Health Care Power of Attorney | 5

10 Signature  

and Notary 

Sign your Health Care Power of Attorney. In Montana, 
a Health Care Power of Attorney is effective upon your 
signature, without having your signature notarized or 
witnessed. However, notarization provides proof your 
signature is genuine should any questions arise from 
family members and/or health care professionals. For 
this reason, a notary section is included on Form A.

Unique Situations
Although the worksheet and Forms A, B, and C are 
designed to apply to all Montanans, everyone’s health 
situation is different. Ask an attorney to provide further 
clarification about information in the worksheet and 
forms. An attorney could customize a Health Care 
Power of Attorney and related documents for your 
specific situation. You, your health care providers 
and your attorney should review these documents 
when there is a change in your health condition or 
life circumstance such as a divorce. 

Who Should Have a Copy  
of Your Health Care  
Documents
You should give copies of your health care documents 
to the following:
•  Appropriate family members;
•  Your health care agent;
•  Your physician and other health care providers;
•  Your local hospital; and
•  Your attorney

You may also want to store your health care 
documents with the Montana End-of-life Registry. 
The registry is a place where advance directives are 

electronically stored. Registered health care providers 
can access them 24 hours a day. You and your family 
members can also access your documents with a code 
you provide. The Montana Attorney General’s Office 
oversees registry filings, security and operations. 

Because of the difficulty of accessing documents 
when needed, a safe deposit box is NOT a wise 
place to store Health Care Power of Attorney and  
related documents.

For  additional  information,  see  the  MSU  
Extension  MontGuide  “Montana’s  End-of-life  
Registry,” (MT200602HR); and the “Montana Rights 
of Terminally Ill Act,” (MT199202HR).

Agent’s Authority and Obligations.

My Agent has the authority to make health care decisions for me and to act as my personal representative, as 
the term is used in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This Health Care Power 
of Attorney is durable and will continue to be effective if I become disabled, incapacitated or incompetent.

My Agent knows my goals and wishes based on our conversations and on any other guidance I have provided, 
including this Health Care Power of Attorney, and any other documents I have signed relating to my health 
care or end-of-life decisions. My guidance also includes any declarations about life-sustaining treatment (see 
Form B or similar document), directions about disposition of my remains, religious preferences, or where I 
prefer to die (see Form C or similar document). My Agent has full authority to make decisions for me about 
my health care according to my goals and wishes. If the choice is unclear, my Agent should decide based on 
what he or she believes to be in my best interests. My Agent’s authority to interpret my goals and wishes and 
to act for me is intended to be broad and includes, but is not limited to, the following authorities: 

a.  To agree to, refuse, or withdraw consent to any type of medical care, treatment, surgical procedures, tests, 
or medications. This includes decisions about using mechanical or other procedures affecting any bodily 
function, such as artificial respiration, artificially supplied nutrition and hydration (for example, tube 
feeding), cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or other forms of medical support, even if the decision is to stop 
or withhold treatment that could result in my death.

b.  To have access to medical records and information to the same extent I am entitled, including the right to 

c.  To authorize my admission to or discharge from any hospital, nursing home, residential care, assisted

USE OF LIFE-SUSTAINING TREATMENT 
(DECLARATION)
FORM B

Instructions: Form B is optional.  If you do not fill out Form B, your Agent still has authority to make 
treatment decisions based on your Health Care Power of Attorney. 

The purpose of this form is to express your preference about the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining 
treatment.  Form B follows the Montana Rights of the Terminally Ill Act (MCA §§ 50-9-101 et seq.).  
Form B guides your Agent and your health care providers about life-sustaining treatment decisions at the 
end of life.  Do not fill out this form if you want your attending physician, attending physician’s assistants, or 
attending advanced practice registered nurse to provide life-sustaining treatment within the limits of accepted 
medical practice, even if it only serves to prolong dying.  (Additional information is in the MSU Extension 
MontGuide “Montana Rights of Terminally Ill Act,” MT199202HR).

My Declaration on Use of Life-Sustaining Treatment. 

I, ________________________________________ [print your legal name], aged 18 years or older and of 
sound mind, state that if:

1.  I have an incurable and irreversible condition; and

2.  In the opinion of my attending physician, attending physician’s assistants, or attending advanced practice 

registered nurse,

a.  This condition will cause my death within a relatively short time if life-sustaining treatment is not  
administered, and

 

b.  I am no longer able to make decisions regarding my medical treatment, whether from incapacity, 
disability, or any other reason, then:

[Instructions: Mark only one of the next two boxes. See witness requirements on page 2.] 

I direct my attending physician, attending physician’s assistants, or attending advanced practice 
registered nurse to withhold or withdraw treatment that only prolongs the process of dying and is not 
necessary for my comfort or to alleviate pain.

I appoint _______________________________________ [print designee’s legal name], or,  
if that person is not reasonably available or is unwilling to serve as my designee, 
_______________________________________ [print alternate designee’s legal name], to make 
decisions on my behalf to withhold or withdraw treatment that only prolongs the process of dying 
and is not necessary for my comfort or to alleviate pain.
