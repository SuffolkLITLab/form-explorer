y filing these forms in court, you are deciding to represent yourself in you guardianship 

case.  These instructions and forms are written to help you give the court the right

hese forms are designed to help with a simple guardianship case where everybody 

agrees that you should be the guardian of the child.  If you think that somebody will 
object to your guardianship – for example, one of the child’s parents – then it would be 
better to be represented by a lawyer in court.   

ead all of the instructions and forms before beginning to fill them out. 

o not change these forms.  If you change the forms, you might lose important language 

you need.  If the forms do not seem right for you, talk to a lawyer.  

•  The child is under 18 years old and not married; 

•  The child’s parents have died without naming a guardian in their wills, or 

the living parents’ custody rights have been terminated, suspended, or 

limited by circumstances or court order; 

•  The child is not (1) an enrolled member of an Indian tribe, or (2) the 

biological child of a tribal member and eligible for enrollment; and  

•  Making you the child’s guardian would be in the child’s best interests.

Note: If the child is (1) an enrolled member of an Indian tribe, or (2) the 
biological child of a tribal member and eligible for enrollment, the Indian 
Child Welfare Act (ICWA) may apply.  Talk to a lawyer if this is your 
situation.

est interest of the child – What is best for the child.  To determine the best interest of 

a child a judge may consider things like: what the child wants; what the parents want; 

the child’s family relationship; how the child is doing at home, in school and in the 

community; the mental and physical health of the child, caregivers and parents; who 

has been caring for the child and for how long; and the developmental needs of the 

child.  The judge may not consider all of these factors and the judge may consider other 

factors.  No one factor will control the judge’s decision.  See § 40-4-212 MCA.

Limited by circumstances – A parent’s ability to care for a minor child may be limited 

by things outside the parent’s control.  For example, a parent may be in prison, in drug 

treatment or be unable to care for the child for several months due to a job transfer or 

long term medical condition.  

CA - The laws of Montana are called the Montana Code Annotated or “MCA.” The 

laws related to guardianship of a minor can be found in Title 72, Chapter 5, Part 2.  An 

easier way to write one of these laws is § 72-5-222 MCA.  The symbol § means section.  

The MCA can be found at your local library or on the Montana State Law Library 

website at: courts.mt.gov/library. 

inor Child- A minor child is a person who is under 18 years old.  

etitioner or Petitioner Pro Se - A Petitioner is someone who files a petition in court. If 

you are asking the court to make you the guardian of a minor child, you are the 

Petitioner.  A Petitioner Pro Se is a Petitioner who is representing himself or herself in 

court – that is, appearing in court without a lawyer. 

ard -  A minor child who has a guardian is called a “ward.”  If the court makes you a 

guardian of a child, the child will be your “ward.”

he Consent to Guardianship of a Minor Child tells the court that the parents who

parents should fill out a consent form.  You will need to make a copy of the consent

Court”). The Petitioner is responsible for filling in their personal information at the top

child (only if the child is over 14 years old), the child’s parents (only if still living), and the 

person who has had care and custody of the child for the 60 days before you filed the 

action (only if this person is not you).  If you do not know the names and addresses of

The Order for Guardianship will be signed by the judge after the Petitioner completely 

fills out the document with the parties’ information.  The Order will legally make you the 

guardian of the minor child.   

he Letters of Guardianship will be signed by the Clerk of Court after the Petitioner 

has filled out the caption and gotten the letters notarized.  The Letters are proof that you 

have been appointed by the court as the guardian of the minor child.  You will have to 

sign the Letters in front of the clerk after the judge issues an order at your hearing. 

he Affidavit of Inability to Pay asks the court to waive filing fees in your case (which 

means you may file the petition and other court forms without paying the usual fees).  If 

you cannot afford to pay the filing fees, ask your Clerk of Court for an Affidavit of 

Inability to Pay. This form may be called something else in your district. 

hat do I do with the Forms? 

Fill out the Forms 

 

Fill out the judicial district, county, and caption on the documents you will 

be filing.  The judicial district and county where you are filing is in the 

county where the child lives. The Clerk of Court can tell you if the court 

wants you to call the child “Child” in court papers, or if you should use the 

child’s initials or full name.  

The caption looks like this:

older unless the court believes that guardian is not in the child’s best 

interests.

should have an original, a copy to keep in a safe 

place and enough copies to mail to anyone else 

who is a part of the case.  For example, if you are

Give Notice of the Hearing 

  When the judge sets a hearing date, you will get an Order Setting Hearing

copy.   

 

Based on the information you provided in the Petition for Guardianship, 

the court will determine whether you know the names and addresses of 

the people who must get a copy of the Notice of Hearing.  If you know the 

names and addresses, send your copies by mail (ordinary first-class or 

certified mail) or deliver them by hand.  You should also give each person 

a copy of the filed Petition for Guardianship and the Sensitive Data Form.   

The copies of the Notice of Hearing must be mailed or hand-delivered at 

least 14 days before the scheduled hearing.   

 

Fill in a Certificate of Mailing or Delivery of Notice of Hearing as proof that 

you have given the Notice of Hearing to the people who must get a copy. 

You must file the Certificate with the Clerk of Court before the hearing, or 

give it to the judge at the hearing.  If possible, you should try to get a 

signed statement from each person saying that they have received the 

Notice, and attach these statements to the Certificate.     

 

If you do not know the names and addresses of the people who must get 

a copy of the Notice of Hearing and you cannot find them, the court may 

let you publish the Notice in a newspaper.  The court will say this in the 

Order Setting Hearing.

If the court tells you to publish the Notice, the newspaper will charge you

Get a receipt or other proof that your Notice was published.  Keep the

Check with the Clerk of Court. 

 

Bring the minor child with you to the hearing.  The judge may ask the child 

some questions.  If the child is 14 or older, the judge will appoint the

Check with the Clerk of Court’s office to find the right courtroom for your 

hearing.  Go to that courtroom and wait for the judge to call your name 

and case number.  Remember to call the judge “Your Honor.” 

Be prepared to tell the judge why you think making you guardian would be 

in the child’s best interests.  If you have already been taking care of the 

child, be sure to give the judge information about that.  Bring any 

important papers, photos, or things to the hearing with you.  The judge will 

expect you to bring your evidence and witnesses to the hearing.  If you 

bring documents you will need enough copies to give one to the judge and 

a copy to each person who is part of the case. 

 

Important: Immediately after your hearing, take your signed 

Order for Guardianship and Letters of Guardianship to the Clerk 

of Court.  You may want to ask the clerk for several certified 

copies of the order and letters.

If you become the child’s guardian, be prepared to make reports on the 

Some courts will require you to report on the condition of the child and any 

property you have control over.  You must report whenever the court orders you 

to, or as required by court rule. Some courts will require you to report every year.  

See § 72-5-231(4), MCA.   

Note: Even if the court says you are the child’s guardian, your guardianship may not 
be permanent.  The court can end your guardianship by “removing” you as guardian.   

he guardianship may also end for other reasons.  You can resign from being a 

guardian, effective when the court approves your resignation.  The guardianship will 
automatically end if the child: (1) dies, (2) gets married, (3) is adopted, or (4) turns 18.  
If the guardianship ends, you will still be responsible for your acts during the 
guardianship.  You will also need to account for the child’s property or money that you 
controlled.  See § 72-5-233, MCA.

You may want to ask the court to name your husband, wife, or another relative as 

a successor guardian, to act as guardian if you are unable to do so because of 

an unexpected emergency, such as illness or death.  A successor guardian 

would only have custody of the child until a new Petition for Guardianship is filed 

and the court has the opportunity to appoint a new guardian.  These forms have 

included boxes to check if you want to include a request for a successor guardian 

in your Petition, but a court does not have to appoint one.  You should be 

prepared to tell the judge at the hearing why you want a successor guardian to 

If you are married and living with your husband or wife, you may want to ask the 

court to name him or her as a co-guardian (joint guardian).  These forms are not 

written to include that kind of request. However, if you want to request a co-

guardian, you may do so by listing both your names wherever the Petitioner’s 

name must appear (you will both be Petitioners), and having both of you sign 

each of the papers filed in court, including a separate Oath and Affirmation of 

Guardian for each of you.  The court does not have to make both of you 

guardians, and may choose to name only one of you.  You should both be 

prepared to tell the judge at the hearing why you want both of you to be made co-

guardians.   The proposed co-guardian should sign each paper filed in court as 

 declare under penalty of perjury and under the laws of the state of 

Montana that the information in this document is true and correct.  I 

understand that it is a crime to give false information in this document.
