ignored.  Or, 

An important goal for many Montana farm/ 
ranch  family  enterprises  is  transferring  land 
and  business  to  the  next  generation.  The 
process  is  challenging  because  it  includes  a 
complex  web  of  economic,  legal,  and  family 
social  decisions.  Often  taxes  and 
legal 
decisions become the focus of attention while 
the family’s social decisions about succession 
planning  are 
individuals 
assume  that  any  problems,  disagreements  or 
differences among family members regarding 
succession  will  be  worked  out  when  the 
legal  and  tax  processes  are  in  order.  Serious 
problems can arise for both the younger and 
older  generations  however,  if  the  transfer 
and  succession  processes  never  begin.  Often 
families  avoid  planning  because  they  do  not 
want  to  deal  with  the  conflict  that  arises 
because  of  the  differences  among  members 
regarding  goals,  values  and  perceptions  of 
fairness and equity.

This publication emphasizes the interdependence 
of  the  family  and  the  business  rather  than 
viewing them as two separate entities, because 
transfer planning and succession planning are 
important to both.

Transfer  planning  includes  the  legal  and 
economic  decisions  involved  in  turning  over 
the ownership of the business, land and other 
property to the next generation.
Succession  planning  includes  the  family 
social  decisions  involved  in  managing  the 
value  and  role  conflicts  that  normally  arise 
when  families  discuss  the  transfer  of  farm/ 
ranch business, land and other property to the 
next generation.

Getting Started

Younger generations often find it difficult to 
initiate  a  discussion  about  the  farm/ranch 
transfer and succession processes because they 
fear  older  generations  may  perceive  them  as 
being  overly  interested  in  their  inheritances. 
On  the  other  hand,  when  older  generations 
bring up the topic, younger generations may 
not  be  responsive  because  they  do  not  want 
to think about their grandparents or parents 
dying.  MSU  Extension  has  a  packet  called 
Estate Planning: The Basics that could be used 
as  conversation  starters  for  both  generations 
(see p. 17 for ordering information). Magazine 
and  newspaper  articles  about  farm/ranch 
transfers are other sources of discussion topics. 
An  estate  planning  seminar  could  provide 
an  opportunity  for  family  members  to  learn 
about  legal  and  tax  issues  regarding  transfer 
planning. Follow-up discussions can then be 
held among family members who could voice 
concerns from their various perspectives.

Family  members  are  not  always  aware  of 
all  the  issues  that  need  to  be  considered, 
discussed  between  generations,  and  decided 
upon within the farm/ranch transfer process. 
Often  there  is  a  certain  level  of  denial 
involved. That denial can be caused by issues 
that are hard for individuals to discuss, such as 
change,  money,  disability,  mental  incapacity 
or death. Every family also has certain issues 
that  bring  strong  emotions  to  the  surface  or 
are  points  of  disagreement  among  various 
family  members.  The  MSU  Extension 
MontGuide  (MT199324HR),  “Talking  with 
Aging Parents about Finances” may be helpful 
to  both  generations.  The  fact  sheet  provides 

Transferring your 
farm or ranch to the 
next generation can 
be a complex web 
of economic, legal 
and family social 
decisions.

•  Transfer planning 
includes the legal 
and economic 
decisions.

•  Succession 

planning includes 
family social 
decisions and 
managing value 
and role conflicts.

Transferring Your Farm or Ranch to the Next GenerationDiscovering Expectations

strategies to help overcome barriers that often 
hinder  conversations  when  family  members 
want to initiate a discussion about money.

Families who have been through the transfer 
and succession planning processes suggest that 
first, issues need to be decided at an individual 
level. Next, these issues need to be discussed 
at the couple level. Finally a discussion needs 
to  held  at  the  family  level  for  each  unit  in 
each generation. If this is accomplished before 
a discussion at the business level, negotiation 
often  proceeds  more  smoothly,  although 
not  necessarily  without  times  of  tension  or 
value  and  role  conflict.  The  processes  are 
more effective when all parties who could be 
involved in the transfer have an opportunity 
to identify and express their needs.

Members  of  the  older  generation  will  still 
make the final decision, but without hearing 
the  needs  and  concerns  of  the  other  family 
members,  they  may  make  assumptions  that 
are not necessarily true. And, at the same time, 
members of the younger generation will realize 
that their needs are being acknowledged and 
considered by the older generation.

Take the quiz in the box at the right to discover 
how well you know – or think you know – the 
expectations of your family members.

Discovering Expectations Quiz

Families who have worked together in a business for years often 
think  they  know  what  the  others’  expectations  are,  but  may 
never have really asked them. For example, what would be each 
family member’s responses to these questions?

1. 

 
Which child(ren) intends to operate the farm/ranch or 
will be involved in the farm/ranch?

2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

6. 

Will non-farming/non-ranching children have 
 
ownership of significant farm/ranch assets currently 
owned by the parents?

What are the feelings of on-ranch/farm family 
 
members compared with off-ranch/farm members 
regarding the ownership of the business property?

 
What would happen to land and/or equipment that 
was transferred to a child who then prematurely died? 
(Would the property go to a spouse, the children, or be 
returned to the parents?)

 
Do parents or grandparents need full income, partial 
income or no income from the farm/ranch when they 
retire?

 
When do the parents intend to give up control over the 
land (After they have both died? After the first parent 
dies? At retirement? When the children ask for it?)

7. 

 
Do parents want to own assets separately from or 
jointly with their children?

8.   Who has control over major decisions in the farm/

ranch, such as the purchase of business assets, 
mortgages (The parents? The children? Parents and 
the children?)

9. 

 
What consideration has been given to the “in-laws” in 
the ownership of the business property?

10.  What consideration has been given to the legacy 
of the older generation? What are ways the older 
generation can be involved without “taking over”?

management  for  both  farm/ranch  business 
viability  and 
functioning.  Goal 
setting  is  especially  critical  when  succession 
planning is a part of the farm/ranch transfer 
process.  Goals  are  based  on  an  individual’s 
values and beliefs. A value is something that 
an  individual  holds  in  high  regard.  Having 
a  farm  business  meeting  about  transfer  and 
succession  planning  can  be  very  frustrating 
if individual members of the units within the 
generations  have  not  identified  what  values 
and  goals  are  really  important  to  them—
first  individually  and  then  as  a  family.  The 
worksheets  in  this  publication  provide  each 
member of the older and younger generations 
an  opportunity  to  focus  their  thoughts  and 
examine 
feelings  about  succession 
planning  issues.  Worksheet  1A  (pp.  6-8)  is 
for  the  older  generation;  Worksheet  1B  (pp. 
9-11) is for the younger generation. Items that 
are  not  of  concern  can  be  skipped.  Space  is 
also provided for each person to identify other 
issues that are important.

their 

The general categories of succession planning 
issues for the older generation and the younger 
generation  are  fairly  similar,  but  individual 
items within them are often quite different.

The categories for the older generation 
include:

•  Continuation of the family farm/ranch
•   Expectations related to the transfer 

process

•   Maintaining control of farm 

management decisions

•  Security for both generations
•  Concerns about children

•  Continuation of the family farm
•   Expectations related to the transfer 

process

•   Current and future involvement with 
farm/ranch management decisions

•  Security for both generations
•  Concerns about parents

Once 
the 
individuals  have  determined 
importance of items under each category, they 
will be more prepared to determine goals that 
would  move  them  forward  in  the  succession 
planning  process.  Some  of  the  items  could 
also serve as a way for the older generation to 
gradually begin the transition of management 
decisions.  Members  of  the  older  generation 
often think about transfer in terms of complete 
control  or  no  control  rather  than  as  partial 
control.  Under  Section  C  of  Worksheets  1A 
and 1B, there are four major divisions of farm/
ranch management decisions:

2.  Financial

way.  By  breaking  out  the  various  aspects  of

explored that were not there before.

Worksheet  2  (pp.  12-14)  helps  individuals 
identify  their  high  priority  personal,  family 
and  business  goals.  Because  goals  are  value-
based, completing Worksheets 1A and 1B first 
will  help  individuals  within  the  farm/ranch 
business  team  identify  values  and  goals  that

are most important to them. When goals are 
written,  they  need  to  be  specific,  prioritized 
and  identified  as  short-term,  intermediate, 
and long term. Short term goals can usually 
be accomplished in less than six months. They 
contribute to the intermediate and long-term 
goals and are seen as vitally important at the 
time. Intermediate goals can be six months to 
a year. They also contribute to the long term 
goals.  Long-term  goals  usually  take  more 
than  a  year  to  accomplish.  Resources  must 
usually  be  accumulated,  and  there  is  a  great 
commitment  of  time,  energy,  and  money 
involved to accomplish them.

Check to see if the goals listed on Worksheet 
2  reflect  the  items  in  Worksheet  1A  or  1B 
that each generation thought was important. 
If  there  is  some  similarity,  then  your  goals 
are  clarified.  If  there  is  little  similarity, 
then  rethink  what 
important  within  
is 
the  categories  of  Worksheet  1A  or  1B  or  
re-examine  your  goal  statements.  Once  each 
individual  has  completed  Worksheet  2,  then 
couples  need  to  come  together  and  share 
their  high  priority  personal  goals. That  way 
everyone  will  have  some  idea  of  the  level  of 
resources (time, money, energy and skills) that 
may be needed to achieve them.

The  next  step  is  to  write  down  your  high 
priority  family  and  business  goals.  After 
a  discussion,  write  down  the  agreed-upon 
family  goals  and  the  agreed-upon  business 
goals. Your family unit then is ready to take 
these  agreed-upon  business  goals  to  the 
farm/ranch  family  business  meeting  where 
succession planning will be discussed.

Succession planning requires changes for both 
generations.  Furthermore,  if  all  concerned 
parties  are  involved,  the  process  may  take 
longer. But, at the same time, the probabilities 
are  increased  that  the  group  will  be  pulling 

together to achieve the same long-term goals 
rather than many individuals plotting to meet 
only their needs.

Examine Ownership Options

Another aspect of the transfer and succession 
process  is  an  examination  of  the  present 
ownership  of  the  land  and  other  property. 
Should  titles  be  changed?  What  about  the 
business  structure-is  it  appropriate  for  your 
goals?  Although  you  will  want  to  check  the 
tax implications, legal ramifications, financial 
soundness  and  so  on  with  professionals, 
only  you  and  other  family  members  can 
decide what ownership method and business 
structure best suits your situation.

accountants; 

Advice  about  ownership  can  be  obtained 
from  the  following  professionals:  attorneys; 
certified 
certified 
financial  planners;  insurance  representatives; 
and  farm/ranch  management  consultants. 
Although  experts  are  excellent  at  analyzing 
the alternatives from legal and tax viewpoints, 
sometimes 
they  do  not  give  adequate 
consideration  to  family  members’  “feelings” 
about how property is titled. Ownership may 
represent  power,  control  and  a  sense  of  self-
worth. Ignoring or discounting these feelings 
may result in family members’ resentment and 
lack  of  cooperation  in  the  transfer  planning 
process.  For  example,  one  father  feared  that 
turning over control of the property to his son 
would result in his life holding little meaning. 
He wrote “ if I hand over control of my property, 
I might as well be dead.”

important  but  the  connectedness  among  the 
family business members and the working out 
of  future  management  strategies  (succession 
planning)  is  also  absolutely  critical  to  the 
success of any transfer plan.

Because  of  the  strong  bonds  inherent  with 
the  heritage,  land  and  lifestyle,  generation 
transfers are more frequent in agriculture than 
other  business.  When  people  work  together 
as  closely  and  for  as  many  hours  as  they  do 
in a farm/ranch operation, disagreements are 
normal; conflicts are normal, too.

However, unresolved conflicts can have major 
impacts on the long-term success and viability 
of  the  farm/ranch  operation.  They  certainly 
can  have  repercussions  on  any  transfer  plan 
as  well.  The  older  generation  may  reach  the 
conclusion  that  no  matter  what  is  done, 
some  member  of  the  younger  generation  is 
going  to  be  unhappy.  The  older  generation 
should  not  let  this  stop  them  from  reaching 
a  decision  about  the  transfer  and  succession 
plan,  however.  Remember,  members  of  the 
older generation have worked hard to increase 
the value of their business – it is their property 
and,  as  such,  they  have  a  right  to  own  and 
dispose of it as they deem appropriate.

Transferring Your Farm or Ranch to the Next GenerationWORKSHEET 1A
Identifying What is Important
Older Generation

Goal setting is essential to effective management for both farm/ranch business viability and family functioning. Goal 
setting is especially critical in molding succession planning within the farm/ranch transfer process. Goals are based 
on our values and beliefs. A value is something that we hold in high regard. Many people are so busy with everyday 
business and family activities that they have not taken time to think about what is important. Doing that is essential 
to succession planning within the farm/ranch transfer process. This worksheet will help you identify the importance of 
a series of family farm/ranch transfer issues under these five categories:

•  Continuation of the family farm/ranch

•  Expectations related to transfer process

•  Maintaining control of farm/ranch management decisions

•  Security for both generations

•  Concerns about children

For  each  issue,  identify  how  important  the  issue  is  to  you  by  circling  a  number  on  a  scale  from  0  to  5  where  “0” 
indicates that it is “not at all important” to a “5” which indicates that the issue is “very important.” In each category, 
there is space to identify additional issues. Be sure to answer these questions on your own without consulting others 
within the transfer process. Then compare your answers with other family members and begin discussions about what 
has already occurred and what are the most important goals within the transfer process.

 A. Continuation of the Family Farm/Ranch

How important is it to you. . .

 1.  That the farm/ranch remain in your family’s possession? 

 2.  That your farm/ranch continue to operate after your death? 

 3.  To receive what your farm/ranch is “worth” when it’s transferred? 

 4.  That your children take over the management of the  
farm/ranch? (Do they have the desire and ability?)

 5.  That your children have the opportunity to continue the  

operation of the family farm/ranch? (And if so, which children?)

WORKSHEET 1B

Identifying What is Important
Younger Generation

Goal setting is essential to effective management for both farm/ranch business viability and family functioning. Goal 
setting is especially critical in molding succession planning within the farm/ranch transfer process. Goals are based 
on our values and beliefs. A value is something that we hold in high regard. Many people are so busy with everyday 
business and family activities that they have not taken time to think about what is important. Doing that is essential 
to succession planning within the farm/ranch transfer process. This worksheet will help you identify the importance of 
a series of family farm/ranch transfer issues under these five categories:

•  Continuation of the family farm/ranch

•  Expectations related to transfer process

•  Maintaining control of farm/ranch management decisions

•  Security for both generations

•  Concerns about parents

For  each  issue,  identify  how  important  the  issue  is  to  you  by  circling  a  number  on  a  scale  from  0  to  5  where  “0” 
indicates that it is “not at all important” to a “5” which indicates that the issue is “very important.” In each category, 
there is space to identify your own issues. Be sure to answer these questions on your own without consulting others 
within the transfer process. Then compare your answers with other family members and begin discussions about what 
has already occurred and what are the most important goals within the transfer process.

 A. Continuation of the Family Farm/Ranch

 1.  That the farm/ranch remain in your family’s possession?

Transferring Your Farm or Ranch to the Next GenerationWORKSHEET 2
Identification of Individual Goals
DIRECTIONS: Without discussions with other family members, write out your individual, high priority long-term 
goals within each of the categories below. Long-term goals require resources to be accumulated and are usually over 
a year.  Next enter your intermediate goals (from six months to a year) in the appropriate columns on page 13. Then 
enter your short term goals on page 14. Short term goals (less than six months) usually contribute to the accumulation 
of resources for the intermediate and long-term goals.

Identification of Mutual Family Level Goals
DIRECTIONS: First, share high priority individual goals from Worksheet 2 with family members. That way everyone 
will have some idea of the money and time that could potentially be needed to achieve them. Next, use Worksheet 3 
to identify each of your high priority family and business goals. After discussion, write the agreed-upon family goals 
and the agreed-upon business goals on page 16. Take those agreed-upon business goals to your next farm/ranch team 
meeting. The farm/ranch business goal-setting session will be far less confusing if each family unit has established 
agreed-upon business goals.
