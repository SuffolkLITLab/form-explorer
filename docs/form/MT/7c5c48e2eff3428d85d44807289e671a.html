How to Transfer Real Property  
Owned in a Joint Tenancy
or in a Life Estate Without Probate
by Marsha A. Goetting, Ph.D., CFP®, CFCS, Professor and Family Economics 
Specialist; Jackie Rumph, MSU Yellowstone County Family and Consumer 
Sciences Extension Agent; and Keri Hayes, MSU Extension Publications Assistant
When real property is owned as joint tenants or is subject to a life estate, the 
distribution method is determined by Montana Law.  This process is described 
in this MontGuide.

MontGuide

 MT201606HR  New 2/16

WHEN A PERSON DIES WITHOUT A VALID WRITTEN 
will, Montana law provides for the distribution of his or 
her real property (including a house or a parcel of land) 
and personal property (including savings and checking 
accounts, certificates of deposit) to legal heirs. The original 
intestacy statutes (meaning dying without a will) have been 
substantially revised to recognize the increasing portion 
of Montanans who have been married more than once 
and have stepchildren and children by previous marriages. 
Under certain conditions, Montana law also provides for the 
deceased person’s parents to receive some property.

The property of a Montana resident who dies without 
a valid written will passes to his or her heirs by the priority 
listing in the intestacy statutes outlined in Table 1 of the MSU 
Extension MontGuide, Dying without a Will in Montana: 
Who Receives Your Property (MT198908HR). 

However, when real property is owned as a joint tenant 

or is subject to a life estate, the distribution method is 
determined by other provisions of Montana law.

•  If the deceased person owned an interest in real property 
in joint tenancy with others, that ownership interest 
automatically ceases upon his or her death and passes to 
the surviving joint tenant or joint tenants. 

•  If the deceased person was a life tenant (meaning holding 
real property in a life estate), the life estate automatically 
terminates upon the death of the life tenant and the 
property passes to the remainderman. Remainderman 
is a legal term for someone who is entitled to receive 
property at the death of the life tenant. 
Probate is not required to transfer a deceased person’s real 
property held in a joint tenancy or in a life estate. Although 
the real property transfers automatically, there is a legal 
procedure provided by the Montana legislature to update 
the public record to show the new ownership. This update 
needs to be recorded with the clerk and recorder in the 
county where the property is located. 

If a surviving joint tenant or remainderman of a life 
estate decides to sell the real property, the removal of the 
deceased person’s name clears the title so the property may 
be sold. 

Real property owned as joint tenants 
with right of survivorship 
Joint tenancy with right of survivorship is a form of co-
ownership in which two or more persons own the same 
property. A joint tenancy in real property can be held 
between married couples, siblings, parents and children, or 
persons who are not related. 

The typical wording used to create a joint tenancy in 
real property is “John Jones and Mary Jones as joint tenants 
with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common.” 
The word “or” between the owners’ names is not typically used 
on a title or deed for real property. 

If the deed or title is worded as “John Jones and Mary 
Jones,” with no mention of a joint tenancy, Montana law 
defines the ownership of the real property as tenants in 
common. This method of co-ownership is described in the 
section “Real property titled as tenants in common” on page 2.
When real property is owned in joint tenancy with right 

of survivorship, the property passes automatically to the 
surviving joint tenant or tenants upon death of one of the 
joint tenants. Even if the deceased person had written a 
will naming someone other than the surviving joint tenant 
to receive the real property, the real property automatically 
transfers by Montana law to the surviving joint tenant. 
Example A: Donna and Jim owned their house and two 

acres of land as “Donna Chambers and Jim Chambers as 
joint tenants with right of survivorship.” Later Jim wrote 
a will leaving that same property to his son from a prior 
marriage. Jim’s son did not receive the house or the two 
acres of land. Donna automatically became the owner 
because the house and land were held in joint tenancy with 
right of survivorship between Donna and Jim.

right of survivorship to surviving joint tenant. 
Although property held as joint tenants with right of 
survivorship passes automatically to the surviving joint 
tenant or tenants without passing through the district court 
probate process, the Montana legislature has provided a 
way for the public records to reflect such a transfer. The 
surviving joint tenant or tenants can file a document with 
the clerk and recorder in the county where the real property 
is located. The surviving joint tenant provides the following 
information in the document: 

1. A statement that one holder of the joint tenancy interest 
is deceased, the date of death, and that the deceased 
holder’s interest in the property is terminated; and, 

2. A legal description of the real property held by the 

deceased person and surviving joint tenant or tenants.
An example document, Acknowledged Statement of 
Termination of Joint Tenancy is available at the Senior and 
Long Term Care Division, Department of Public Health and 
Human Services website, http://dphhs.mt.gov/SLTC/aging/
legalservicesdeveloper/legal-forms.

The Acknowledged Statement must be signed and 
acknowledged before a notary public before it will be 
accepted by the clerk and recorder in the county where the 
property is located. The recording fee for the Acknowledged 
Statement is $7 per page if it meets the legislative “standard” 
format. The form at the Senior and Long Term Care 
Division website meets the legislative “standard.” 

The surviving joint owner must also present a completed 
Montana Realty Transfer Certificate (Form 488) to the clerk 
and recorder. This confidential tax document is required by 
the Department of Revenue from any party transferring real 
property. The form is available at any Montana county clerk 
and recorder’s office or online www.revenue.mt.gov, Search 
"Realty Transfer Certificate” or “Form 488."

After the Acknowledged Statement is recorded, title to 

the property appears in the name of the surviving joint 
tenant or tenants. Future real estate tax bills from the county 
treasurer’s office will be sent to the surviving joint tenant or 
tenants who now hold title to the property. 

Brief review of ownership in joint tenancy with right 
of survivorship. 
The transfer of ownership to real property held as joint 
tenants with right of survivorship is often overlooked until 
the surviving joint tenant (very often the surviving spouse) or 
beneficiaries of the surviving joint tenant decide to sell it or 
encumber it (for example, use the real property as collateral 
for a loan). At that point they may be faced with the time 
consuming process of proving one or all joint tenants are 
deceased so the public records in the clerk and recorder’s 
office can be updated. Closings can be delayed while 
beneficiaries submit proof of the death of the joint tenants. 

2

The surviving joint tenant can submit a document, such 

as the Acknowledged Statement of Termination of a Joint 
Tenancy to make the process easier for him or her and future 
heirs (persons who are entitled under intestate succession 
statutes to the property of a person who died) or devisees 
(persons designated in a will to receive real or personal 
property). 

Real property owned as tenants in 
common 
Another way property can be owned between co-owners, 
including married couples, siblings, parents and children, or 
persons who are not related, is a tenancy in common. When 
property is owned as tenants in common each person owns 
an undivided interest in the same real property. After one of 
the co-owners dies, his or her share becomes part of his or 
her estate. 

A tenancy in common in real property in Montana 
is typically created by using the word “and” between the 
names, for example, “John Jones and Mary Jones.” Some 
owners make it absolutely clear by adding the phrase “as 
tenants in common,” for example, “John Jones and Mary 
Jones as tenants in common.”

When two or more persons co-own real property 
as tenants in common, there is no automatic right of 
survivorship for the surviving tenant in common to receive 
the deceased co-owner’s share. The deceased person’s interests 
must pass through the probate process or an intestacy 
proceeding to determine the legal heirs or devisees.

Transferring interest in real property owned as 
tenant in common. 
The simplified method used to terminate a joint tenancy is 
not available for real property owned as tenants in common. 
The transfer process depends on whether the deceased tenant 
in common died with a written will or without a written will.
Written will. If the deceased co-owner had written a will 
leaving his or her real property titled as tenants in common 
to his or her devisees, the will must be declared valid by the 
district court during probate. After the will has been declared 
valid, the deceased person’s tenant in common interest may be 
transferred to his or her designated devisee or devisees. 
Example B: John and his wife, Mary, owned a section of 
land as tenants in common. Each owns an undivided 
interest of fifty percent. John died with a written will 
leaving his fifty percent interest in the land to their son, 
Matt. After John’s will was declared valid during the 
probate process, the personal representative of John’s 
estate executed a new deed and filed it with the clerk and 
recorder. The title is now held as tenants in common by 
Matt and Mary. 

No written will. If a landowner who held real property 
as a tenant in common died without a written will, the legal 
heir or heirs are determined during a district court intestacy 
proceeding. MSU Extension has a website that can be used to 
discover who receives property under state law if a Montana 
resident passes away without a written will (as do 7 out of 10 
Americans): www.montana.edu/dyingwithoutawill.
Example C: Tim and Lucy owned a vacation home on 

Flathead Lake as tenants in common. Together they had 
three children, all of whom are living. Because Tim died 
without a written will, the heir to his ownership of the 
property as a tenant in common is determined in an 
intestacy proceeding. Although Tim and Lucy have three 
children, the priority heir is Tim’s wife, Lucy. After Lucy 
submitted a marriage license proving she was Tim’s wife, 
the Administrator of Tim’s estate recorded a new deed for 
the vacation home with the clerk transferring the property 
to Lucy. 

Brief review of ownership as tenant in common. 
When real property is owned by two or more persons 
as tenants in common, each co-owner has an undivided 
interest in the property. His or her interest can be left to 
others with a written will. If there is no will, the legal heirs 
of the undivided interest are determined during an intestacy 
proceeding in accordance with Montana intestacy statutes. 
The simplified method used to terminate a joint tenancy is 
not available for real property owned as tenants in common. 

Real property subject to a life estate
A life estate in real property can be created in two ways: 
1. By a direct grant (such as a deed or provisions in a will) of a 
life estate to a person by the owners of the real property, or 

2. By reserving a life estate as part of the transfer of the real 

property.

A life estate is the right to the possession, use and income 
from a property for the duration of a person’s life. The owner 
of a life estate is called a life tenant. When property is subject 
to a life estate, the life estate interest is terminated at death of 
the life tenant and the interest transfers to the remainderman 
without the necessity of a probate proceeding.
Example D: Jane had a house titled in her name only. In her 
will Jane left the house to her husband, Jack, for his life, 
and then at his death to Susan, her daughter from another 
marriage. 

Jack is not the owner of the house; he is only the life 
tenant. Therefore, he cannot sell, gift or leave the house 
to someone else in his written will. As the life tenant he is 
responsible for paying property taxes, insurance premiums, 
and needed repairs on the house.

Susan is termed the remainderman because she receives 
the house upon the death of Jack. Susan becomes responsible 
for paying real estate taxes, insurance premiums, and needed 
repairs on the house.

If a life tenant writes a will naming someone other than 
the remainderman as devisee of the property, that provision 
in the will is disregarded. The property interest transfers by 
law from the life tenant to the remainderman without the 
necessity for a probate proceeding. 
Example E: Rob has a life estate in ranch land left to him 

by his father. Rob’s son, Doug, is the remainderman. Rob 
wrote a handwritten will leaving the land to his new wife. 
The will is ineffective for the life estate. Doug received the 
land upon the death of his father, not Rob’s new wife.

Transferring real property that is subject to a life 
estate. 
The Montana legislature has provided a way to update the 
public record ownership of real property on the death of 
a life tenant without probate. The remainderman can file 
a document indicating the life tenant is deceased and the 
identity of the remainderman. The following information is 
provided: 

•  a statement that the holder of the life estate interest has 
died, date of death, and that the life tenant’s interest in 
the property is terminated; and

•  a legal description of the real property held in a life estate.
An example document, Acknowledged Statement of 

Termination of Life Estate form is available at the Senior and 
Long Term Care Division, Department of Public Health and 
Human Services website, http://dphhs.mt.gov/SLTC/aging/
legalservicesdeveloper/legal-forms.

Like the Acknowledged Statement for joint tenancy, 

the Termination of a Life Estate must be signed and 
acknowledged before a notary public before it will be 
accepted by the clerk and recorder in the county where the 
property is located. The remainderman must also present a 
completed Montana Realty Transfer Certificate (Form 488) 
to the clerk and recorder (see page 2). The form is available 
at any Montana county clerk and recorder’s office or online 
www.revenue.mt.gov, Search "Realty Transfer Certificate” or 
“Form 488."

After the Acknowledged Statement is recorded, the public 

record is updated to reflect that the title to the property is 
now in the name of the remainderman. Future real estate 
tax bills will be sent by the county treasurer’s office to the 
remainderman who now holds title to the property.

Brief review of a life estate. 
A life estate allows one person to have possession of property 
(typically land, a home or buildings on the land) during 
his or her lifetime. After the death of the life tenant, his 
or her interest in the property terminates. A life estate is

The life tenant retains the use and/or the possession of the 
property held in the life estate for the duration of his or 
her life. An individual who receives the ownership rights 
of the real property upon the death of the life tenant is the 
remainderman.

Once an Acknowledged Statement to Terminate a Life 
Estate is recorded, the public record is updated to show that 
the life estate has been terminated. Future property tax bills 
will be sent to the remainderman.

Summary
If a deceased person owned real property as a joint tenant 
with right of survivorship with another individual, or 
possessed real property in a life state as a life tenant, the 
Montana legislature has provided a way for their survivors 
to update the public record of ownership. This procedure 
allows the surviving joint tenant or remainderman to update 
the public record outside the probate process. 

By filing the appropriate documents with the clerk and 

recorder’s office in the county where the land is located, 
the legal record will show the property is owned by the 
survivor(s). The simplified method used to terminate a joint 
tenancy or life estate is not available for real property held as 
tenants in common.
