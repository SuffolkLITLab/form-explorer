      <pre>Selecting an Organizational 
Structure for Your Business

by Joel Schumacher, Extension Economics Associate Specialist, and 
Marsha Goetting, Ph.D., CFP®, CFCS, Extension Family Economics Specialist 
and Professor, Montana State University-Bozeman

This MontGuide explains the main characteristics of each organizational 
structure.  Before reaching a decision you may want to seek additional 
information and discuss your specific circumstances with an attorney and/or 
certified public accountant. 

 MT199708HR Revised 2/19

SELECTING THE BEST ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 
for a new business is only one of the many challenges that 
business owners will face. The type of business and needs 
of the owner often will influence the selection. No one 
organizational structure is best for all businesses, because 
each business and business owner is unique. The four 
common types of organizational structure in Montana 
include (Montana Census of Agriculture, 2012):

1.  Sole Proprietorship (individual, family), 79 percent
2.  Partnership, 8 percent
3.  Corporation (S or C), 13 percent 
4.  Limited Liability Company, data not available

Prioritize Needs
The most important step to choosing the appropriate 
organizational structure is to determine the needs of your 
business and prioritize them. Each business has unique 
needs that will help determine which structure is most 
appropriate. 

•  What type of decision making or management 

•  How important is liability for personal injury and 

structure is needed?

product liability?

•  How important are taxation issues? (for example: 

treatment of profits/losses and deducibility of employee 
benefits – health insurance, group term life insurance)
•  How important is the transfer of the business to new 

owners or heirs?

1. Sole Proprietorships
A sole proprietorship is the most common type of business 
structure. A sole proprietorship is owned and controlled 
by one person. The business is not distinguished from the 
owner, so in many ways the owner is the business.

The funds to establish and operate a sole proprietorship 

come from the owner’s personal funds. The owner may 
obtain funds from a variety of sources such as personal 

savings, a personal loan or from a credit card to finance the 
business. Any revenue or debts generated by the business are 
not distinguished from the owner’s personal assets. 

Personal assets include an owner’s home, land, vehicles, 

investments and bank or credit union account balances. 
All of the owner’s personal assets can be used to satisfy 
the debts and any type of tax liability incurred by the sole 
proprietorship. The owner’s personal assets may also be 
used to pay any legal damages resulting from activities of 
the business. Liability insurance for business activities is an 
important risk management tool for sole proprietors.

Income or losses generated by a sole proprietorship are 

reported annually as part of the owner’s personal federal 
income tax return on a Schedule C, C-EZ or Schedule 
F
. Sole proprietors are required to pay self-employment 
taxes on their “before-tax” income. The self-employment 
tax rate is equal to one-half of the social security tax rate 
(12.4 percent in 2019) and the Medicare tax (2.9 percent 
in 2013). For example, a sole proprietor with before-tax 
income of $20,000 would pay $1,530 in self employment 
taxes (12.4% + 2.9% = 15.3% x ½ = 7.65%; $20,000 x 
7.65% = $1,530).

A sole proprietor is eligible to establish an “employer” 
sponsored retirement plan. Retirement plans available to 
sole proprietors include Simplified Employee Pensions 
(SEP), SIMPLE 401(k) Plans, Profit Sharing Plans, 401(k) 
Plans and Defined Benefit Plans. Information about 
retirement plans is available from the Employee Benefits 
Security Administration at www.dol.gov/ebsa, or by phone 
at (866) 444-3272.

A sole proprietorship limits the options an owner has for 
estate planning and business continuity decisions. Because 
the owner is the business, the business ends when the owner 
dies. The business assets are considered part of the owner’s 
estate when he or she dies and are subject to probate and 
federal estate taxes. Selling or transferring the business 
may also be difficult because the business assets are not 
distinguished from the owner’s personal assets.

A partnership is a voluntary association of two or more 
individuals for the purpose of operating a business. Each 
individual (partner) contributes his or her money, property, 
labor or other skills to the new business and has an interest 
in the financial profits or losses generated by the business. 
Although a partnership is not a taxable entity, the 
partnership is required to file an informational return 
(Form 1065) annually with the IRS. This form reports the 
partnership’s profits or losses for the year. Each partner 
reports his or her share of the profits or losses from the 
partnership on his or her individual state and federal tax 
returns. A partner is required to pay self-employment taxes 
on his or her “before-tax” income in the same manner as a 
sole proprietor (see page 1).

A partnership can be formed with a written or oral 

agreement. A written agreement is a legally binding 
document that helps avoid misunderstandings and conflicts 
among the partners. The following items are often included:

•  Name and address of each partner
•  Purpose of the partnership
•  Duration of the partnership (events resulting in 

termination of the partnership and how the partnership 
assets will be divided upon termination)

•  Name of who is contributing the resources (cash, 

personal property, land, labor, etc.), amount of the 
resources and how they will be contributed (transfer of 
ownership, rental, use-only basis)

•  Method of how profits and losses will be calculated and 

shared

•  Description of how decisions will be made
•  Limitations on partners’ activities
•  Procedures to add or remove partners (including 

procedures for dealing with the death of a partner, such 
as an option for current partners to buyout the former 
partner’s interest in the partnership).

•  Plan outlining how to resolve disagreements among the 

partners

Several types of partnerships are available in Montana.

•  General Partnership
•  Joint Venture
•  Limited Liability Partnership

A general partnership is similar to a sole 

proprietorship for tax and liability purposes. Each 
partner has unlimited personal liability for all debts and 
obligations of the partnership and acts of all partners, 
even if he or she was not directly involved in a particular 
debt or decision.

General partners share the management, profits and losses 
of the partnership. If a general partner dies or withdrawals the 
partnership may be subject to dissolution. If a partner dies, 
that partner’s interest is subject to probate and federal estate 
taxes. If, however, the deceased’s estate is valued at less than 
$11.4 million in 2019 then there is no federal estate tax due.
The partnership agreement may include provisions to 
assist the remaining partners in continuing the business. 
These provisions may include buy-sell agreements that allow 
or require the surviving partners to purchase the deceased 
partners interest in the business. Basic partnership provisions 
for issues not addressed by the partnership agreement are 
provided in Title 35 of the Montana Code Annotated (https://
leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/title_0350/chapters_index.html). 

A joint venture is a specific type of partnership that is 
similar to a general partnership. However, the scope of the 
partnership is limited to a specific project or time period. 
Upon completion of the project or time period, the joint 
venture is dissolved. 

Another type of partnership is a limited liability 
partnership (LLP). LLP partners are not subject to 
unlimited personal liability for actions of the partnership. 
This limited personal liability is a major advantage to a LLP 
as compared to a general partnership. Partners in a LLP are 
still liable for their own negligence and the negligent acts of 
those under their direct supervision. Other aspects of a LLP 
are similar to that of a general partnership. 

An application for registration or renewal of a limited 

liability partnership must be filed with the Montana 
Secretary of State to establish a limited liability partnership. 
Contact the Secretary of State at 406-444-2034 or by email 
at sos@mt.gov or at https://sosmt.gov.

A partnership may also be a limited partnership. There 
are two types of partners in a limited partnership. A limited 
partnership must have one or more general partners. The 
general partners in a limited partnership have similar 
responsibilities to the partners in a general partnership. A 
limited partnership also allows for limited partners. Limited 
partners are typically investors in the partnership and do 
not take an active role in the management of the business. 
Their liability is limited to the amount of their investment. 
The partnership agreement limits their share in the profits 
and losses incurred by the business. A certificate of domestic 
limited partnership must be filed with the Montana 
Secretary of State to establish a limited partnership. Contact 
the Secretary of State at 406-444-2034, by email at   
sos@mt.gov or at https://sosmt.gov/. 

3. Corporations
A corporation has a legal and tax identity separate from its 
owners, who are called shareholders. Montana law requires 
that corporations be chartered by the state and that articles 
of incorporation be filed with the Secretary of State.  The 
articles of incorporation should include the following items:

2

•  Name of the corporation
•  Names and addresses of the incorporators
•  Location of the registered office
•  Name of the registered agent
•  Duration of the corporation
•  Amount and kinds of stock (such as common or 

preferred stock) that may be issued

•  Description of voting rights of shareholders

Once the corporation has been established, annual 

meetings of directors and shareholders are required. 
Written minutes reflecting important transactions 
or decisions are also necessary. Montana law requires 
corporations to file an annual report with the Secretary 
of State. This report lists the names and addresses of the 
directors and officers. The number of shares outstanding is 
also reported. This report can be updated on the Secretary 
of State’s website. More information about annual 
reporting requirements is available from the Secretary 
of State (at 406-444-2034, by email at sos@mt.gov, or 
https://sosmt.gov). Corporations are also required to file 
federal and state income tax returns each year.

One of the most attractive features of a corporation is the 
limited liability provided to its shareholders. The corporation 
itself is fully liable for any obligations or debts incurred by 
the business, while the shareholders are liable only to the 
amount of their investment in the corporation. However, 
many small corporations are unable to obtain financing unless 
shareholders personally guarantee the debts of the corporation. 
Although a corporation offers shareholders some protection 
from liability claims, this type of business structure does not 
eliminate the need for a comprehensive business and personal 
liability insurance program. 

A corporation offers several options to shareholders for 
transferring ownership of the business. Shares of stock in the 
business can be sold, gifted, or bequeathed to individuals or 
other corporations while allowing the business to continue. 
The continuity of the business is not linked to the life of 
the original or current owners. Businesses often change over 
time and these changes may cause a business to expand, 
downsize, merge or change ownership. Each of these reasons 
may necessitate a change in a business structure. Seek legal 
and tax advice when considering liquidating a corporation or 
pursuing major changes. 

For income tax purposes, the shareholders must choose 
whether the corporation will be a “C” or an “S” corporation. 
Corporations, that elect to be a C corporation, pay taxes 
on income earned by the corporation. Shareholders of a C 
corporation do not report the profits or losses incurred by 
the business on their personal tax returns. However, they 
must report the wages and/or dividends paid to them by the 
corporation on their personal tax returns. 

In contrast, an S corporation does not pay taxes on 

income earned by the corporation. Instead each shareholder 

reports his or her share of the corporate income on his or her 
personal income tax return. Although the corporation does 
not pay income taxes directly, the corporation is required to 
file IRS Form 1120S annually. 

Only certain corporations are eligible to be an S 
corporation. An eligible corporation must have less than 
100 shareholders and each shareholder must be a citizen 
or resident of the United States. The corporation must also 
have only one class of stock and use the calendar year as its 
fiscal year. If a corporation meets these requirements and 
prefers to be an S corporation, Form 2553 needs to be filed 
with the IRS. 

Another benefit of the corporation as an organizational 

structure is the ability to establish an Employee Stock 
Ownership Plan or a company stock investment option 
in other types of retirement plans. Because other types of 
organizational structures do not have ownership represented 
by stock, they are unable to offer retirement plans with 
company stock as investment option.

Establishing a business as a corporation can simplify the 

transfer of the business to new owners or heirs. A share of 
stock represents a piece of ownership in the corporation. 
These shares can be sold, gifted or bequeathed individually 
or in large quantities. This allows ownership to be transferred 
to single or multiple owners in small or large amounts at a 
specific time or over a longer period of time. Other forms of 
organizational structure do not offer this flexibility. 

There may be a significant tax advantage of using an 
"S" corporation over an LLC or a partnership in certain 
circumstances. When the owner of a business is also going to 
perform services for the business (e.g., a plumber who owns 
a plumbing business), then there may be a reason to choose 
the "S" corporation rather than an LLC or partnership. 
The reason is that owners of LLCs and partnerships are 
considered to be self-employed and therefore must pay a 
"self-employment tax." The entire net income of the LLC 
and partnership business is subject to self-employment 
tax. In contrast, in an "S" corporation only the salary paid 
to the owner-employee is subject to employment tax. The 
remaining income is paid as a distribution and is not subject 
to employment tax under IRS rules. Therefore, an employee 
owner of an "S" corporation may realize substantial 
employment tax savings.

4. Limited Liability Company (LLC)
The limited liability company (LLC) blends the limited 
liability offered by corporations with the operational 
flexibility and pass-through taxation provide by partnerships, 
without the restrictions of an S corporation or a limited 
liability partnership. 

In Montana, one or more persons may form an LLC by 
signing and filing articles of organization with the Secretary 
of State. The articles of organization must include:

3

          

•  Name of the LLC
•  Latest date on which the LLC is to dissolve
•  Address of its principle place of business in Montana 

and, if different, its registered office and the name and 
address of its resident agent at the Montana registered 
office

•  Statement of whether the LLC is to be managed by a 

manager or its members

•  Names and addresses of managers (if managed by 

managers) and of the initial members (if managed by 
members)

The LLC may choose to create an operating agreement, 

which is an internal document governing an LLC’s 
operations and respective rights and obligations of its 
members. LLCs in Montana are not required to adopt 
their own operating agreement. LLCs that do not adopt 
their own operating agreement are subject to the default 
provisions contained in Title 35 of the Montana Code 
Annotated (https://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/title_0350/
chapters_index.html).  

Owners of an LLC are referred to as members and 
have both economic and management rights (including 
voting rights) and may constitute the management of an 
LLC. A manager is the person charged with management 
responsibility for an LLC. The manager may or may not be a 
member. 

Laws governing limited liability companies differ from 
state to state. Because of these differences, care should be 
taken to ensure that the LLC legal documents meet the 
specific requirements of Montana law.

Summary
When starting a new business or evaluating changing the 
structure of an existing business, consider the advantages 
and disadvantages of each type of business structure from a 
perspective of business, personal, and family goals.  The best 
business structure will not always be the same for different 
types businesses and the most appropriate business structure 

 

 
 
 

 

 

 
 
 

 

may change as business and personal needs change over 
time. After evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of 
each type of business structure discuss your situation with 
tax and legal professionals. Their recommendations may 
assist you in selecting the appropriate business structure for 
your circumstances.
