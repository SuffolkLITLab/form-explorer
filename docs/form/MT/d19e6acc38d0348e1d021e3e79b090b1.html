      <pre>FACT SHEET 

Least Restrictive Approaches 
to Supporting Individuals as 
Decision Makers

Too often full guardianship is the default option for individuals who need 
assistance with decision-making, which is very restrictive. There are 
alternative approaches to guardianship that are flexible and can adapt to 
the changing needs an individual may experience. 

September 2019

No matter what the individual’s preferences, abilities, and communication style, there is an 
option that will work for them. 

Alternative approaches to guardianship

Least Restrictive

Less Restrictive

More Restrictive

Most Restrictive

•  Limited or 

•  Full Guardianship

•  Supported 

Decision Making

•  Advocacy Forms
•  Online or Bill 

Payment Service

•  Joint Checking 
Account

Individual retains full 
independence and 
full decision-making 
power, and is able to 
access support as 
needed. 

•  Power of Attorney
•  Representative 

•  Special Needs 

Payee

Trust

•  Healthcare or 
Advanced 
Directives

Individual retains 
some, but not 
all, control over 
decisions. A 
representative is 
designated to make 
decisions “for” an 
individual in specific 
areas. 

Temporary 
Guardianship

A guardian is limited 
in which areas they 
act as the decision 
maker for the 
individual, or serves 
for a specific amount 
of time. The order is 
tailored by the court. 

A guardian has full 
decision-making 
control over all areas 
of an individual’s 
life. Requires a court 
order. 

See Page 4 for decision-making resources. 

How to determine which approach is the best fit
Every person needs different types of supports in order to make their own decisions and participate as 
they wish in their community. In order to create an individualized support system, it is essential to answer 
the following questions about the person being supported. 

•  What are their current skills and strengths? 
•  What skills need development? 
•  What are the concerns and fears of those who 

provide support or assistance? 

•  What is the least restrictive form of decision-
making assistance available that takes into 
account the person’s welfare and safety, and 
opportunity for skill development and growth? 

Why consider alternatives to guardianship? 

There are many reasons to consider less 
restrictive options than guardianship. For example, 
people who have the opportunity to make their 
own decisions become more independent, have 
successful employment, and are more integrated 
into their communities (Jameson et al., 2015). 
As individuals develop new skills, adjustments to 
decision-making supports can be made without 
going to court.

What is guardianship? 
Guardianship is a legal process in which the 
court determines that an individual does not 
have the capacity to make decisions either 
generally or in specific areas. The court then will 
appoint a guardian. Establishing and changing a 
guardianship requires going to court and can be 
expensive. 

What does a guardian do? 

A guardian is someone who is responsible 
for making decisions about the person under 
guardianship. There are different levels of 
guardianship. Guardians might have the legal right 
to sign contracts and make financial, medical, 
educational, and other types of decisions for the 
person under guardianship. The guardian may 
need to occasionally show a court they are making 
good decisions on behalf of the person under 
guardianship. 

Myths about decision-making supports

Myth:  
It is full guardianship or nothing.

Reality: 

There are many 
different supports 
available to assist 
people with 
decision-making. 

Guardianship is 
only one of several 
options, and even 
within guardianships there are options such as 
full, partial, and temporary.

Myth:  
If a person can’t communicate without support, 
they need a guardian.

Reality: 
If a person uses an 
alternative form of 
communication that 
does not automatically 
mean they need a guardian. It is important 
that the individual doesn’t lose their right to 
advocate for themselves because it’s ‘easier’ for 
another person to communicate on their behalf. 

Use a person-centered planning approach 
to identify how the individual prefers to 
communicate, and use those communication 
methods in the decision-making process.

The importance of 
empowering language
The words and language we use can 
impact others, and may have unintended 
meanings. Guardianship is often thought 
of as a logistical decision, so it can be 
easy to forget how this influences an 
individual’s self-worth and perception of 
how others value their opinions. 

It is important for families and 
service providers to remember to use 
empowering language as they talk with 
individuals about guardianship and other 
alternative approaches. For more on this 
topic: 

•  What is in a word? The evolution 

of disability language, by Glenda 
Watson Hyatt

•  Respectful Disability Language: Here’s 
What’s Up! from the National Youth 
Leadership Network (NYLN) and Kids 
As Self Advocates (KASA)

Myth:  
Support person or guardian = decision maker

Reality: 
The concept of providing support or serving 
as a guardian is shifting. In the past, family 
members, support staff, guardians, or others 
might make all of the 
decisions for, and about, 
a person who needed 
assistance. 

Those who support 
individuals or serve as 
guardians are responsible for making decisions 
based on what the individual would choose. 
Instead of “What do I think is best for this 
person?”  the question becomes, “How would 
this person make this decision?”

Myth:  
Guardianship laws are updated when laws for 
individuals with disabilities are updated.

Reality: 
Unfortunately, 
guardianship laws 
have not progressed 
at the same pace 
as civil rights for 
individuals with 
disabilities. 

Every state has different guardianship laws. 
Find out what alternative approaches are 
supported in your state, and how the state 
views guardianship. Every state can have 
different protocols, requirements, and available 
resources. 

For example, Texas requires that guardianship 
be reviewed and approved each year, rather 
than for life, which makes sure that the 
approach more closely matches the individual’s 
skills and needs. See: A Texas Guide to Adult 
Guardianship (PDF) and Texas Guardianship 
Reform (PDF). Other states, such as Maine, 
have adopted the Uniform Law Commission’s 
standard as their state standard.

Some states have created state-specific toolkits 
as resources for families to understand what 
is offered in their state. See Montana’s toolkit 
here: Alternatives to Guardianship Toolkit 
(website, PDF available) (2018). 

Efforts to promote national 
standards

The Uniform Law Commission (ULC) 
established recommended national 
standards for guardianship. 

See Guardianship, Conservatorship, 
and Other Protective Arrangements 
Act for more information and to view 
an interactive map of states that have 
enacted or introduced this legislation.
