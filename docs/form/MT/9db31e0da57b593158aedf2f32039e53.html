      <pre>Transferring a Montana Vehicle 
Title After the Death of an Owner

The paperwork to transfer a Certificate of Title, also known as the title, for a 
motor vehicle to the deceased’s legal heirs depends upon the circumstances. 
The purpose of this MontGuide is to describe the process for common 
situations occurring in Montana. 

MontGuide

 MT201613HR  New 10/16

AFTER A MONTANA RESIDENT PASSES AWAY,  
there are many tasks to be completed to settle his/her estate. 
One question family members often ask is: How is the title 
of a vehicle transferred to the person who inherited it?
The term "appropriate fee" is used throughout the 
MontGuide because the actual amounts may be subject to 
change. More information about fees can be found on page 4. 

Initial Steps 
There are four initial steps for survivors to follow to activate 
the process of transferring the title of a vehicle to the person 
who inherited it. 

STEP 1: Determine if a title is necessary for the 
vehicle.
Family members first need to determine if the vehicle 
owned by the deceased person is one that requires a title 
to be registered with the Montana Motor Vehicle Division 
(MVD). There are very few items that are not titled in 
Montana. Examples of vehicles requiring a title include the 
following: 

•  Motor vehicle (automobile, pickup, motorcycle, ATV, 
motor home); trailer; semi-trailer; pole trailer; camper; 
mobile home (unless attached to a foundation); 
motorboat; personal watercraft; sailboat; and 
snowmobile.

STEP 2: Determine how the title was “owned” by  
the deceased.
Family members need to find the original title to determine 
how the vehicle was titled. Was it issued only in the 
deceased’s name (sole ownership) or were there other owners 
(joint ownership)? Was it registered in the name of a trust? 
Or, if the vehicle was used in a business, was it registered in 
the name of the business?

The title could be stored in the deceased’s safe deposit 
box, a fireproof file box, a file drawer containing important 
papers, a shoe box at the top of the closet, or perhaps the 
glove compartment of the vehicle. 

For More Online MontGuides, Visit www.msuextension.org

If the original title cannot be found, the Montana Driver 

Privacy Protection Act allows the MVD to provide title 
information. A family member, a Personal Representative 
(appointed by the district court to settle the deceased’s 
estate), or someone who believes he/she has inherited a 
vehicle can complete Form MV210, Release of Motor 
Vehicle Records. The MVD will then provide the applicant 
with ownership information of the vehicle in question. 
Form MV210 is in a format that can be completed 
online, then printed for the applicant’s signature. The 
form provides checkboxes in which the person making the 
request indicates the type of information requested and 
intended use. 

The person making the request signs a certification 
statement indicating he/she understands the provisions of 
the Montana Driver Privacy Protection Act. The form must 
be notarized unless the applicant attaches a copy of a state 
or government-issued photo ID such as a driver license, 
identification card, or passport (none of which can be 
expired for more than four years). 

The completed form and check are sent to the Title and 
Registration Bureau. The fee varies by the type and number of 
records being requested. For example, the fee for requesting 
the last six years’ record of vehicle information is $25 per 
vehicle. The fee for requesting one other person’s current 
vehicle information is $6 per vehicle. 

MVD also has an online Vehicle Search Service, https://

app.mt.gov/dojvs/public, that allows for a search of a 
vehicle registered in the State of Montana. The applicant 
must provide his/her first and last name, Montana driver’s 
license number and last four digits of his/her Social Security 
Number. The requestor must declare the specific use that 
legally allows him/her to receive the requested vehicle 
record. The fee (varies by the type and number of records 
being requested) for the online search can only be paid by a 
credit card. 

The use of the online Vehicle Search Service is not 
recommended if the applicant is from out of state because 
the program links driver’s license information of the person 
making the request to the Montana’s driver license database. 

If the original title can be found, the Personal 

Representative can sign off the title if he/she provides a 
copy of the certified letter of appointment. The surviving 
owner can use a death certificate to release the deceased’s 
interest. And, any remaining owner can sign the title to 
release his/her interest if the vehicle is being sold. The 
personal representative could also provide a certified letter 
of appointment and use form MV7: Application for 
Replacement Certificate of Title.

STEP 3. Determine the legal heir(s) of the vehicle(s). 
After the type of ownership held by the deceased person is 
confirmed, the next step is to determine the legal heir(s) of 
the vehicle. 

•  If the deceased person owned the vehicle with another 

individual, his/her ownership automatically ceases upon 
death and the survivor becomes the sole owner.
Example 1: Eric Smith and Julie Smith owned an SUV 
that was titled in both of their names. When Eric died, 
Julie became the sole owner of the SUV.

•  If the deceased person owned the vehicle with another 
individual, but left the vehicle in a written will to a 
third party not listed on the title, that provision in the 
will is not enforceable. The ownership of the vehicle 
automatically transfers to the surviving joint owner.
Example 2: Donna and Jim titled their four-wheel drive 
truck in both their names. Two years later, Jim wrote a will 
in which he left the truck to his son from a prior marriage. 
After Jim’s death his son did not receive the truck. Donna 
automatically became the owner because the truck was 
in both her and Jim’s names. Jim’s provision in the will 
leaving the truck to his son was not enforceable. 

•  If the deceased person was a sole owner who died with a 
written will that had been validated by the district court, 
the Personal Representative transfers the vehicle to the 
devisee (legal term for a person who inherits under a will).
Example 3: Joe Lind left his motor boat to his grandson 
Blake in a written will. The Personal Representative 
transferred the boat to Blake, the devisee.

•  If the vehicle was titled in the name of a trust, the trustee 
distributes the vehicle to the beneficiary listed in the trust 
document.
Example 4: Erik Peterson, age 17, was listed as the 
beneficiary of a snowmobile that was titled in the name 
of the Peterson Family Trust dated January 4, 2016. 
The trust document instructs the trustee to deliver the 
snowmobile to Erik when he reaches the age of 18.

2

•  If the deceased person was the sole owner of the vehicle 

and died without a written will, ownership of the vehicle 
passes to his/her heirs by Montana intestacy statutes 
outlined in Table 1 of the MSU MontGuide, Dying 
without a Will in Montana: Who Receives Your Property 
(MT198908HR). An MSU Extension interactive website 
also provides this information (www.montana.edu/
dyingwithoutawill/).
Example 5: Bernie Wilson died without a written will 
and had an automobile titled in her name only. Under 
the Montana Uniform Probate Code, Bernie’s husband is 
the priority heir, not her three children or her parents.

STEP 4. Complete the Transfer Paperwork: 
After the legal heir(s) of the vehicles are determined, the final 
step is to complete the appropriate paperwork with the Title 
and Registration Bureau of the Motor Vehicle Division. 

Motor Vehicle Division (MVD):  
Transfer Process and Forms 
The specific paperwork required by the MVD to transfer 
title from a deceased owner to his/her legal heirs depends 
upon how the vehicle was titled and the dollar value of 
his/her estate. Situations A – E provide the processes for 
common circumstances occurring in Montana. 

Situation A: What if a vehicle is titled in the name of a 
deceased person (sole ownership) and his/her estate is 
valued at $50,000 or less? 
A Personal Representative is not required to be appointed by 
the district court to administer an estate valued at $50,000 
or less. An heir who becomes the legal owner should 
complete Form MV12, Application for Title of a Vehicle by 
Right of Survivorship. 

The following information about the vehicle must be 
provided on the form: year; make or manufacturer; model; 
body style/length; ton (weight); identification number; and 
title number. The heir must also include his/her driver’s 
license number; federal employer identification number; 
tribal identification; or corporate identification number.

A death certificate does not have to be included with the 
form. However, the heir must report the deceased’s date of 
death along with the city, county, state, and zip code where 
he/she died in an Affidavit of Death. An heir must certify 
that the vehicle was not left in the deceased’s written will 
to anyone else other than the signer. Or, if the deceased 
person did not have a written will, the heir must certify by 
signing the form that he/she is entitled to the vehicle under 
Montana’s intestacy statutes.

The heir submits the completed Form MV12 and a check 
for the appropriate fee to the Title and Registration Bureau. 
If there is a lien on the vehicle, a lien release or letter of 
permission on the lender’s letterhead is required with Form 
MV12. After the Title and Registration Bureau confirms the 
information, a Certificate of Title is sent to the new owner.

Situation B: What if a vehicle is titled in the name of the 
deceased person (sole ownership) and the value of his/her 
estate exceeds $50,000? 
Montana law requires a Personal Representative (PR) to be 
appointed to administer the estate if the deceased’s assets are 
valued at $50,000 or more. If the eligible heirs do not want 
the vehicle and prefer to receive money from its sale, they 
can authorize the PR to sell it. 

If a PR is not named in the deceased’s will, or if the 
deceased person died without writing a will, the district 
judge will appoint one based on the order provided in the 
Montana Uniform Probate Code. The MontGuide, Personal 
Representative Responsibilities (MT199008HR), provides the 
priority list for appointment as a PR and describes the PR’s 
duties. 

Montana UPC priority is the following: surviving spouse 

who is a devisee (named in the will) of the decedent; the 
custodial parent of a minor decedent; other devisees of the 
decedent; the surviving spouse of the decedent; other heirs 
of the decedent; and public administrator. 

If the original title cannot be found, the PR completes 
Form MV1, Application for Certificate of Title for a Motor 
Vehicle, to request the vehicle be placed in the name of the 
legal heirs or purchasers if he/she is a Montana resident. 
The individual appointed as PR must enter the name of the 
person they are representing and sign their signature as the 
Personal Representative.

The PR signs the deceased’s name beside his/her name in 
the odometer/statement of sale. The PR draws a line through 
the word “dealer” and writes “Personal Representative” in 
its place. This process allows the PR to complete the title 
and registration without requesting and paying the fee 
for a replacement title. A certified copy of the Personal 
Representative’s Letter of Appointment should accompany 
Form MV1, as well as a check for the appropriate transfer 
fee to the Title and Registration Bureau. 

If there is a lien on the vehicle, a lien release or letter of 
permission on the lender’s letterhead needs to be included. 
The Title and Registration Bureau informs the new 
owners of any additional fees and taxes that are due upon 
registration of the vehicle and sends a Certificate of Title to 
the new owner.

If the vehicle is being sold, the PR completes form 
MV1 and submits it and the court certified personal 
representative papers to the Mother Vehicle Division with 
the appropriate fee.

Situation C: What if a vehicle is titled in two or more 
names and one of those is the deceased person? 
The appointment of a PR to handle the transfer of a vehicle 
title is not necessary if the title is held in multiple names. 
Montana laws assumes joint tenancy. 

If the surviving owner wants to keep the vehicle, he/she 
completes Form MV12, Application for Title of a Vehicle 
by Right of Survivorship. The surviving joint owner sends 
the completed MV12 form and a check for the appropriate 
transfer fee to his/her local Motor Vehicle Department or to 
the Title and Registration Bureau.

If there is a lien on the vehicle, a lien release or letter 
of permission on the lender’s letterhead will need to be 
included with Form MV12 before the Motor Vehicle 
Division will remove the name of the deceased person. 
The surviving owners are responsible for paying title or 
registration fees if the taxes are not current. However, if the 
registration shows both the name of the survivor and the name 
of the deceased person and if the license plates are current, the 
surviving owner pays only the title fee. The registration receipt 
is issued in the survivor’s name. 

If the surviving owner wants to sell the vehicle, he or 
she sends the completed Form MV12 and a check for the 
appropriate fee to his/her local Montana Motor Vehicle 
Department or the Title and Registration Bureau. The 
funds are deposited into an escrow account in the surviving 
owner’s name until titles can be provided. 

Situation D: What if a vehicle is titled in the name of a 
business that the deceased person owned? 
If the title is in the deceased owner’s name followed by DBA 
(doing business as) then the actual owner of the vehicle is 
the person listed, rather than the business. For example, Jack 
Smith, DBA Yellowstone Fertilizer Company), means that Jack 
Smith is doing business as Yellowstone Fertilizer Company. 
In this case the DBA has no ownership and the procedure 
described in Situation A would apply.

If the title is issued in the deceased’s name along with an 
actual business name, (for example, Jack Smith, Jack Smith’s 
Fertilizer Company) the business retains an ownership 
interest in the vehicle. In this case the business name remains 
on the title and a death certificate is used for transfer of the 
title. Or, if a PR was appointed for the deceased person, the 
PR would sign the title and have his/her signature notarized. 
A certified copy of the PR letter of appointment must also 
be provided to the MVD. This process will transfer the title 
of the vehicle to the business. 

If the title is issued in only a business name and it is a sole 
proprietorship, the heirs submit an affidavit that the business 
was a sole proprietorship and follow the procedure in 
Situation B. Form MV12, Application for Title of a Vehicle 
by Right of Survivorship can be used to indicate that the 
business is a sole proprietorship.

If there is a lien on the vehicle owned by the proprietor, a 
lien release or letter of permission on the lender’s letterhead 
should be included with Form MV12 before the Motor 
Vehicle Division will remove the name of the business. 

3

Situation E: What if a vehicle is titled in the name of a 
trust and if a person for whom the trust was created or 
the trustee dies?
The secondary or successor trustee is responsible for 
completing Form MV40, Statement of Trustee. On this 
form the trustee indicates he/she is acting as a trustee of the 
trust with authority to transfer the title of the vehicle. 

The trustee sends the completed form, the title, and a 
check for the appropriate transfer fee to his/her local MVD 
or to the Title and Registration Bureau. 

Summary
This MontGuide has described the process of transferring 
a vehicle’s title from the name of a deceased person to legal 
heirs for common situations occurring in Montana. The 
paperwork to transfer title for vehicle in Montana depends 
upon how the title was listed by the deceased person and the 
value of his/her estate. In many cases an heir can use form 
MV12, Application for Title by Right of Survivorship to 
transfer title into his/her name.
