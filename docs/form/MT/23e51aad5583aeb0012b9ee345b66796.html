POL-Internet Privacy and Security Policy 

I. 

Purpose 

 

The Montana Information Technology Act (MITA) assigns the responsibility of establishing and 
enforcing statewide IT policies and standards to the Department of Administration (DOA). The 
purpose of this Policy is to implement the Internet Privacy and Security Policy for defining 
actions to fulfill the responsibility. 

This Policy applies to the CIO as required under 2-17-521(4), MCA, and to executive branch 
agencies, excluding the university system, as required under Section 2-17-524(3), MCA.  

II. 

Scope 

III. 

Policy Statement 

This policy has been developed for the state’s enterprise information systems maintained by 
DOA based on the Montana Information Technology Act (MITA). This policy is in cooperation 
with the federal and local governments with the objective of providing seamless access to 
information and services to the greatest degree possible 2-17-505 (3).  

IV. 

Roles and Responsibilities 

Roles and responsibilities are required by this policy and in accordance with POL-Information 
Security Policy - Appendix B (Security Roles and Responsibilities). 

V. 

Requirements 

he State of Montana respects each individual website user's right to privacy. Any personal 

information that is collected will not be disclosed to any third party except as required by 
applicable law, unless the website user has expressly permitted the disclosure or "opted in" 
to allow the disclosure. The purpose of this statement is to inform website users of the use of 
information that may be collected while they are visiting this or any State of Montana 
website. 

itizens and businesses are not routinely asked to provide personal information to visit State 

of Montana websites or to download information. This includes mt.gov as well as agency 
websites. Government agencies may request personally identifiable information from you in 

 

 

 

 

 

  T

  C

 

 

order to provide requested specialized services, but such information is handled as it would 
during an in-person visit to a government office. 

ontana law controls the level of access to personally identifiable information maintained in 
public records at state and local levels of government. Information that is generally available 
under Montana law may be posted for electronic access through mt.gov and associated 
agency websites. 

  M

Use of Constituent Email Addresses 

Email addresses obtained as a result of a request to the state website will not be sold or given 
to other private companies for marketing purposes unless it is specifically stated when the 
email address is requested and the user "opts in" to having their email used in the stated 
fashion. The information collected is subject to the access and confidentiality provisions of 
Montana Code and Federal law. Email or other information requests sent to a state website 
may be maintained in order to respond to the request, forward that request to the appropriate 
agency, communicate updates to the state web page that may be of interest to citizens, or to 
provide the website designers with valuable customer feedback to assist in improving the site. 
Individuals will be provided with the ability to "opt in" at any time to receive communication 
regarding new service updates. 

Transaction Information 
The state uses secured servers for conducting online transactions. All credit card and other 
payment information that is transmitted is protected by encryption technology, provided the 
website user's browser is properly configured and the user's computer is operating properly. 

Data Security and Quality 

The State of Montana is committed to data security and the data quality of personally 
identifiable information that is either available from or collected by governmental web sites, 
and has taken reasonable precautions to protect personally identifiable information from loss, 
misuse or alteration. Any third parties responsible for this information are committed to the 
same principles, and also are required by contract to follow the same policies and guidelines 
as the State of Montana in protecting this information. Unless otherwise prohibited by state or 
federal law, rule or regulation, the individual is granted the ability to access and correct 
personally identifiable information whether or not the information inaccuracy was accidental or 
created by unauthorized access. 

Non-State Websites 

Various non-state websites may be linked through mt.gov and other state maintained 
websites. Since the state has no control over these non- state websites, visitors to those sites 
are advised to check their privacy statements and be cautious about providing personally 
identifiable information without a clear understanding of how the information will be used. The 
state accepts no liability for other entities that are linked to the state's websites. Visitors may 
also wish to consult privacy guidelines such as those recommended by the Online Privacy 
Alliance. 

 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

For information security purposes, the computer systems that host mt.gov and other state 
websites employ software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized 
attempts to compromise its devices. These attempts to cause damage could be subject to 
legal action.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
