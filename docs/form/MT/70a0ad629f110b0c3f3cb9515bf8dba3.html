In order to facilitate electronic legal research via the Internet; in order to make the

opinions  and  substantive  orders  issued  by  this  Court  more  accessible  to  the  print  and

broadcast media and to members of the public; and in order to more effectively implement

the  “Right  to  Know”  provisions  of  the  Constitution  of  the  State  of  Montana,  Article  II,

Section  9,  this  Court,  pursuant  to  its  authority  under  Article  VII,  Section  2(3)   of  the

Constitution  of  the  State  of  Montana,  has  determined  to  make  an  addition  to  its  current

citation  format.  Accordingly,

IT  IS  ORDERED  that,  from  and  after  January  1,  1998:

(1) At the time of issuance, this Court shall assign to all opinions and to those orders

designated  by  this  Court  for  publication  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  substantive  orders),  a

citation  which  shall  include  the  calendar  year  in  which  the  opinion  or  substantive  order  is

issued followed by the Montana U.S. Postal Code (MT) followed by a consecutive number

beginning each year with “1” (for example, 1998 MT 1). This citation shall be known as the

public domain or neutral-format citation and shall appear on the title page of each opinion

and on the tirst  page ofeach  substantive order issued by this Court. State Reporter  Publishing

Company  and  West  Group  arc  requested  to  publish  this  public  domain,  neutral-format

citation  within  the  heading  of  each  opinion  or  substantive  order  published  by  those

companies.

(2)  Beginning  with  the  first   paragraph  of  text,  each  paragraph  in  every  such  opinion

and substantive order shall be numbered consecutively beginning with a  1 symbol followed

by  an  Arabic  numeral,  flush  with  the  left  margin,  opposite  the  first  word  of  the  paragraph.

Paragraph numbers shall continue consecutively throughout the text of the majority opinion

or  substantive  order  and  any  concurring  or  dissenting  opinions  or  rationale.  Paragraphs

within  footnotes  shall  not  be  numbered  nor  shall  markers,  captions,  headings  or  Roman

numerals  which  merely  divide  opinions  or  sections  thereof.  Block-indented  single-spaced

portions  of  a  paragraph  shall  not  be  numbered  as  a  separate  paragraph.  State  Reporter

Publishing  Company  and  West  Group  are  requested  to  publish  these  paragraph  numbers  in

each opinion or substantive order published by those companies.

(3) In the case of opinions which are not to be cited as precedent (variously referred

to  as  unpublished,  “noncite,”  or  memorandum  opinions)  and  in  the  case  of  all  substantive

orders  (unless  otherwise  specifically  designated  by  this  Court),  the  consecutive  number  in

the public domain or neutral-format citation shall be followed by the letter “N” to indicate

that the opinion or substantive order is not to be cited as precedent in any brief, motion or

document filed with this Court or elsewhere (for example, 1998 MT  1N).  Any “N” citation,

2

nevertheless,  shall be listed along with the result, case title and Supreme Court cause number

in the quarterly table of noncitable cases issued by this Court and published by State Reporter

Publishing  Company  and  West  Group.

(4) In the case of opinions or substantive orders which are withdrawn or vacated by

a  subsequent  order  of  this  Court,  the  public  domain,.  neutral-format  citation  of  the

withdrawing or vacating order shall be the same as the original public domain, neutral-format

citation but followed by a letter “W” (for example, 1998 MT 1 W). An opinion or substantive

order  issued  in  place  of  one  withdrawn  or  vacated  shall  be  assigned  the  next  consecutive

number appropriate to the date on which it is issued.

(5) In the case of opinions or substantive orders which are amended by a subsequent

order of this Court, the public domain, neutral-format citation of the amending order shall

be  the  same  as  the  original  public  domain,  neutral-format  citation  but  followed  by  a  letter

“A” (for example, 1998 MT IA). Amended paragraphs shall contain the same number as the

paragraph  being  amended.  Additional  paragraphs  shall  contain  the  same  number  as  the

immediately  preceding  original  paragraph  but  with  the  addition  of  a  lower  case  letter  (for

example,  if  two  new  paragraphs  are  added  following  paragraph  13  of  the  original  opinion;

the new paragraphs will be numbered  113a  and  113b).  If a paragraph is deleted, the number

of  the  deleted  paragraph  shall  be  skipped  in  the  sequence  of  paragraph  numbering  in  any

subsequently  published  version  of  the  amended  opinion  or  substantive  order,  provided  that

3

at  the point where the paragraph was  d&ted,  there shall be a note indicating the deletion of

that  paragraph.

_____________

Pursuant to its authority under Article VII, Section 2(3) of the Constitution of the 

State of Montana, this Court filed an order on December 16, 1997, adopting citation formats 

for use in its opinions, including a public domain or neutral-format citation.  The Court has 

now  determined  to  simplify  the  format  set  forth  in  that  order  for  pinpoint  citations  to 

opinions  decided  after  January  1,  1998,  by  eliminating  the  requirement  that  paragraph 

number(s) be repeated for all three sources cited. 

THEREFORE,

IT IS ORDERED that, effective immediately, proper pinpoint citations to opinions  

decided by this Court after January 1, 1998, shall be in the form shown in the following 

example:

Doe v. Roe, 1998 MT 12, ¶¶ 44-45, 286 Mont. 175, 989 P.2d 1312

In all other respects, the Court’s order filed December 16, 1997, shall remain unchanged.

The Clerk is directed to provide copies of this order to:

The Code Commissioner and Director of Legal Services for the Montana Legislative 

Services Division;

The District Judges of the State of Montana;
The Clerks of the District Courts of the State of Montana;
The Clerk of the United States District Court of the State of Montana;
The State Law Librarian;
The Librarian for the University of Montana School of Law;
The Dean of the University of Montana School of Law;
The Attorney General for the State of Montana;
The Office of Public Defender for the State of Montana;
The President and Executive Director of the State Bar of Montana, with a request that 

notice of this Order be published in the next available issue of the Montana Lawyer;

LexisNexis and West.

______________

IN RE THE MATTER OF OPINION FORMS
AND CITATION STANDARDS OF THE 
SUPREME COURT OF MONTANA
     

___________

)
)
)

O R D E R

On December 16, 1997, this Court entered an order adopting a public domain and 

neutral-format  citation form  for  its  Opinions,  to  be  used  with  all  Opinions  issued  after 

January 1, 1998.  As part of that order, the Court gave examples of proper citation format for 

Montana cases decided before January 1, 1998, in which, as was the Court’s practice at that 

time, the year of the opinion appeared immediately after the case title.  

We continue to use the public domain and neutral format citation form we adopted in 

1997 for our cases today, and our December 16, 1997 order remains in full force and effect 

in that regard.  Several years ago, however, the Court internally adopted the generally-used 

format for citations of cases from other courts and pre-1998 Montana cases, in which the 

year of publication of a case appears at the end of the citation.  For example:  Doe v. Roe, 

284 Mont. 301, 989 P.2d 472 (1997).  We have never formally announced that our December 

16, 1997 Order is superseded in that regard.  We do so now.  

IT IS ORDERED that we encourage the use of the above  “date-last”  format  for 

citations to pre-1998 Opinions issued by this Court, and for Opinions issued by all other 

courts, in all briefs, memoranda, and other documents filed in this Court.

The Clerk is directed to provide copies of this Order to the Code Commissioner and 

Director  of  Legal  Services  for  the  State  of  Montana;  the  District  Judges  of  the  State of 

Montana; the Clerks of the District Courts of the State of Montana; the Clerk of the United 

States District Court of the State of Montana, the Clerk of the United States Circuit Court of 
Appeals, 9th Circuit; Jim Goetz, Chair of the Advisory Commission on Rules of Civil and 

Appellate Procedure; the State Law Library; the Librarian for the University of Montana 

School of Law; the Attorney General for the State of Montana; the Office of the State Public 

Defender; the Executive Director of the State Bar of Montana; and Thomson Reuters.
