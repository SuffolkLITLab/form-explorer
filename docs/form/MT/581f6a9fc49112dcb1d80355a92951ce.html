      <pre>Cremation

by Marsha Goetting, Ph.D., CFP®, CFCS, Professor and Extension Family
Economics Specialist; and Keri D. Hayes, MSU Extension Publications
Assistant

Thinking about the loss of a loved one or our own mortality raises many 
emotional issues. This MontGuide focuses on the option of cremation and 
explores personal and family concerns, state and federal regulations, and costs. 

 MT200201HR  Revised 11/18

How many people chose cremation?
Cremation has continued to increase in acceptance in the 
United States since 1876, when the first crematory was built 
in Pennsylvania. During 2016, Montana had a cremation 
rate of 74 percent compared to Nevada (77 percent), 
Washington (77 percent), Oregon (76 percent), Maine (74 
percent), and Hawaii (73 percent). In 2018, the national 
cremation rate is predicted to be over 53 percent.

Why do people choose cremation?
In a national survey cited by the Cremation Association of 
North America, respondents who preferred to be cremated 
listed the following reasons: to save money (30 percent); 
to save land (13 percent); because it is simpler and more 
convenient (8 percent); body not in earth (6 percent); and 
personal preference (6 percent). Other reasons that were 
given included concerns for the environment, cold-weather 
constraints, and ease of transportation to distant burial sites.

What questions do people ask about 
cremation?
Montana funeral directors indicate that people considering 
cremation often ask the following questions: Does my body 
have to be embalmed? Is a casket required? Should a cremation 
be followed by a memorial service? Would it be best for the 
family to have a traditional funeral and have the cremation 
afterwards? What is the cost for a cremation compared to 
other alternatives? If I have in writing my wish to be cremated, 
can my family disregard my request? Should I have my 
cremated remains scattered, buried or entombed? If so, where?
Similar questions are often asked by family members or 
friends who are faced with decisions about cremation when 
the deceased had not expressed a preference prior to his or 
her death.

The answers to some of these questions are determined 

by regulations established under the authority of state 
and federal statutes. The answers to other questions are 
influenced by the personal preferences of individuals who 

wish to be cremated or by the people authorized to make 
decisions for the deceased. Finally, the services and options 
available from local crematories and funeral directors may 
be the deciding factors. 

Who regulates cremations?
The Montana Board of Funeral Service has established 
administrative rules and standards for cremation based on 
Montana statutes. The Board is under the auspices of the 
Montana Department of Labor and Industry. The Board 
licenses and governs crematories, crematory operators and 
technicians, as well as mortuaries, morticians, and privately 
owned, for-profit cemeteries. For more information, go 
to the Montana Board of Funeral Service website: http:// 
boards.bsd.dli.mt.gov/fnr.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has established 
trade regulation rules requiring that consumers be provided 
with itemized price information and other disclosures about 
funeral goods and services, including cremations. For more 
information go to Federal Trade Commission website: 
https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/
complying-funeral-rule. 

After I die, who can authorize the removal 
of my body to the crematory? 
After a death occurs in Montana, the Vital Statistics 
Bureau of the Montana Department of Public Health 
and Human Services (DPHHS) requires the submission 
of a form, Authorization for Removal, Transportation 
and Final Disposition of a Dead Body. The form requires 
the signature of one of the following: the coroner having 
jurisdiction; a mortician; the physician in attendance at 
death or the physician's designee; or a certified advanced 
practice registered nurse. Typically, the mortician submits 
the form with the appropriate signature to DPHHS. The 
form must be submitted regardless of the method chosen 
for disposition of the deceased’s body.

Montana? 
In Montana, human remains may not be cremated except 
in a licensed crematory. As of September 2018 there are 35 
licensed crematories in the state. Crematories are located in 
the following communities (the number within each city is 
provided in parentheses)1:
Anaconda (1)  Great Falls (3)  Malta (1)
Big Timber (1)  Hamilton (2)  Miles City (1) 
Billings (5) 
Havre (1) 
Bozeman (2)  Helena (1) 
Butte (2) 
Dillon (1) 
Glendive (1)

Kalispell (3) 
Lewistown (1)  Whitehall (1)

Missoula (2)
Plains (1)
Polson (2)

What are the costs of cremation?
The charge for cremation is somewhat less than a traditional 
burial. However, total cost depends on the services desired 
by the family and products requested from the crematory.  
The cost of cremation typically ranges from $2,800 to 
$4,000. 

State and federal rules require funeral homes to provide 
a disclosure form or a contract itemizing the expenses for 
professional funeral services, facilities, and equipment. Most 
crematories in Montana also provide similar information for 
cremation products and services.

People who are considering cremation can request price 
disclosures for services and products from the crematories in 
their area or from a local funeral director.

Does my body have to be embalmed?
Embalming is not a requirement for cremation or burial in 
Montana. However, embalming may be necessary under 
certain circumstances. If a family desires cremation after a 
funeral service with a private or public viewing, then the 
body may need to be embalmed. If the body is going to 
be in route more than eight hours or if the termination 
of common carrier transport occurs more than 36 hours 
after the time of death, the body must be embalmed or 
refrigerated. If the body is being transported privately and 
will not reach final destination within 48 hours after the 
time of death, the body must be embalmed or refrigerated.

Is a casket required?
According to the Cremation Association of North America, 
about 90 percent of cremations do not have a casket. The 
State of Montana does not require a casket for cremation but 
does require a durable cremation container. For health and 
safety considerations, however, Montana does require that 
a deceased person being delivered for cremation be encased 
in an enclosed, rigid and leak-proof container. Cremation 
containers are usually made of readily combustible substances 

1: Cremation Association of North America: www.cremationassociation.org

such as fiberboard, pressed wood or cardboard. The casket or 
cremation container must be cremated with the body.

The Montana Board of Funeral Service has established 
standards regarding caskets and alternative containers for 
cremation (see definition of terms, cremation container, p. 8).
Under Federal Trade Commission rules, funeral directors 

who offer cremations:

•  may not tell you that the state or local law requires a 

casket for direct cremation;

•  must disclose in writing your right to buy an unfinished 

wood box or an alternative container for direct 
cremation; and

•  must make an unfinished wood box or other alternative 

container available for cremation.

Do all my family members have to sign a 
form to have my body cremated?
To avoid misunderstandings, people who desire to be 
cremated should list their request in a prepaid funeral 
contract, a written disposition direction, a signed affidavit 
or a videotaped disposition direction. Further information is 
available in the MSU Extension MontGuide What Are Your 
Rights Over Your Remains? (MT200918HR).

If a person does not leave directions by one of the 
methods above, Montana statute (§37-19-904) states that 
the right for another person to control the disposition of the 
remains of the deceased, unless other directions have been 
provided by the deceased, is in the following order:

•  a spouse
•  a majority of adult children
•  a parent
•  a close relative of the deceased, or
•  in the absence of a person listed previously, a personal 
representative, a public administrator or others as 
designated by the Montana Board of Funeral Service.

What is done with the body before 
cremation?
All personal possessions of value, such as jewelry or 
mementos, should be removed by a family member or the 
authorizing agent before the body is taken to the crematory.
Pacemakers must be removed by licensed morticians 
prior to placement of the body in the chamber because these 
items could damage the crematory during the process. If a 
crematory is not notified about the presence of pacemakers 
and not instructed to remove them, the authorizing agent 
could be held responsible for any damages caused to the 
crematory equipment or personnel.

Most prostheses and mechanical devices or mechanical 
implants are generally cremated with the body and removed 
before the remains are placed in an urn.

2

Human remains may not be cremated until 24 hours 
have passed after the time of death. The crematory must 
have a death certificate signed by the coroner and the 
cremation authorization form signed by the authorizing 
agent. Human remains delivered to a crematory may not be 
removed from the cremation container, as the container is 
cremated with the body. 

What happens during cremation?
During cremation, the body is exposed to intense heat 
(1,400 to 2,000°F). Cremation time varies with the size and 
weight of the body being cremated. A typical time span is 
one and one-half hours to four hours.

After the cremation is complete, the remains are allowed 
to cool and then are removed from the cremation chamber. 
All human remains are separated from non-human items. 
The remains are then pulverized and placed in a container 
selected by the authorizing agent. The cremated remains 
appear similar to crushed seashells or egg shells and can 
weigh between four and ten pounds depending upon the 
size of the body being cremated.

To verify the identity of the deceased, many crematories 

recommend that a family member personally identify the 
deceased in the funeral home prior to cremation.

How can my family be assured that my 
ashes are the ones given to them?
Montana law requires that an identifying metal disc be 
attached by the crematory operator or technician to each 
receptacle containing a body. Prior to cremation, the disc is 
mounted to the head end of the casket or alternate container. 
During the cremation process, the disc is secured on the 
control panel outside the chamber.

Once the cremation process is completed, the disc 
is placed with the cremated human remains inside a 
receptacle, such as an urn. The number of the identifying 
metal disc is also written on the outside of the receptacle 
containing the remains.

Which survivors receive my ashes? 
Cremated human remains must be turned over to the 
individual specified by the authorizing agent on the 
cremation authorization form. If the deceased did not express 
a preference for the disposition of the cremated remains, the 
authorizing agent is responsible for making the decision.
If the authorizing agent has not specified the ultimate 
disposition or claimed the cremated remains after 90 days, the 
crematory has the authority for disposition. A record of the 
disposition must be made and kept by the crematory operator.
A representative of the crematory and the individual 
designated to receive the cremated remains must sign a 
delivery receipt. The receipt indicates the name of the 
deceased and the date, time, and place the remains were 
delivered. The crematory retains a copy of the receipt. The 

original is given to the authorizing agent. After the cremated 
remains are delivered to the person designated on the 
authorization form, they may be transported in Montana 
without a permit. 

What can my family do with my ashes?
Some families may prefer a container for the ashes that 
reflects the personality of the deceased. Cookies jars, lunch 
boxes, camera cases and ammo boxes are examples of 
containers that have been used.

Some families prefer to retain the cremated remains at 
the family residence until weather permits the scattering or 
burial of the remains at a place significant to the deceased.
Other families prefer to place the urn in an outdoor 
columbarium niche that is located in a cemetery. A niche 
is a recessed compartment enclosed by glass to protect the 
engraved urn or by a metal ornamental or granite front 
upon which the name and birth and death dates can be 
engraved. The cost of a columbarium niche depends on its 
size, location, and quality. There may be additional charges 
for endowment care, a flower vase, or nameplate.
Another option is a biodegradable urn. Some 

biodegradable urns are designed to float in water for one-
to-five minutes before descending. Others are designed to 
break down over time when left in the open.
Urn burial. Burial of the urn in a family cemetery plot or 
urn garden are other alternatives. Many cemeteries have 
facilities ranging from simple to elaborate.

Some families prefer to hold the cremated remains for 
burial at a later date, so they can be placed in the casket of 
the spouse or mingled together with the cremated remains 
of a deceased spouse in a preselected urn. 
Personal or keepsake memorials. When family members 
desire to have a remembrance, one option is jewelry, such as 
a pendant that holds a token amount of cremated remains. 
Another option is a miniature cast bronze keepsake urn that 
holds a small portion of the remains.

Scattering cremated human remains
The Cremation Society of North America reports that of those 
who prefer cremation, 59 percent said they planned to have 
their remains scattered. Of these, 30 percent responded that 
they preferred to be scattered over water, while 20 percent 
desired land. Regardless of the site chosen, scattering should 
be done in a manner that does not affect the rights of others.
Because some people may find it difficult to scatter 
the remains of a loved one, people who wish to have their 
cremated remains scattered by friends or relatives should 
discuss their wishes with them. In addition, those planning 
cremation should decide whether they want a permanent 
memorial for the deceased.

Where can I have my ashes scattered?
Montana's abundance of land, rivers, and lakes provides 
many opportunities for the scattering or burial of cremated 
human remains. However, any city, county, state and federal 
regulations should be followed.
Privately-owned lands. Scattering cremated remains on 
land a person owned prior to death is legal in Montana. 
Families should consider whether the land could be sold in 
the future.
Church-owned lands. Contact the church where the 
cremated remains are to be scattered or buried to determine 
specific rules for that church.
City lands, parks, and lakes. Most Montana cities do not 
have specific regulations against the scattering of cremated 
human remains. Persons considering city-owned property to 
scatter cremated remains should check with the city attorney 
or city commission to determine if permission is required 
and whether forms must be completed before the scattering.
County lands, parks, and lakes. Most Montana counties 
do not have specific regulations against the scattering of 
human cremated remains on county-owned lands. People 
who want to scatter cremated remains on county-owned 
property should check with the county attorney or county 
commission about possible regulations.
School trust lands. The spreading of cremated human 
remains on state school trust lands administered by 
the Montana Department of Natural Resources and 
Conservation (DNRC) is allowed with the permission of the 
Department. Typically, these lands are located in sections 
16 and 36 in each township. Call the Helena office (406-
444-2074) to be directed to the appropriate DNRC unit or 
area office. A land use license must be obtained with a $25 
minimum application fee. An additional fee will be charged 
by the area office that administers the land on which the 
cremated remains are to be scattered.
State rivers and lakes. The Montana Department of 
Environmental Quality does not require a permit for spreading 
cremated human remains in state creeks, rivers, or lakes.
State lands and parks. The Fish, Wildlife and Parks 
(FWP) Commission has a policy that does not allow for 
the spreading of cremated human remains or burials within 
state parks unless authorized by the commission. The 
commission accepts petitions for exceptions to the rule in 
the case of family ties to the property.

Tribal Trust Lands. While there are no regulations 
under the Bureau of Indian Affairs that dictate disposal 
of cremated human remains, the Native American Grave 
Protection and Repatriation Act dictates that the Tribes have 
ownership of reservation lands and may set code regulations. 
Non-tribal members should seek authority from the 
appropriate tribal council before attempting to scatter the 
ashes of human remains on tribal lands within any of the 
seven reservations in Montana.

Can I have my ashes shipped to another 
town, state or country?
The United States Postal Service offers the only legal 
method of shipping cremated remains domestically 
or internationally. There are specific requirements for 
preparing, packaging, and shipping human or animal 
cremated remains. If you plan to ship cremated remains, 
you will need to have padding and two containers – an 
inner container and an outer container.

While NOT a requirement, the Postal Service 

recommends that you put the sift-proof container in a sealed 
plastic bag. 

The postal service recommends you use a Priority Mail 

Express box. The Postal Service offers the boxes free to 
customers who use Priority Mail Express service. Also use 
the Postal Service Cremated Remains label (Label 139), 
which is available at your local post office. 

For more information on Postal Service's requirements 
for shipping cremated remains, Google "U.S. Postal Service 
Publication 139"

Summary 
People who desire cremation should place their requests 
in writing and provide copies of the written instructions 
with relatives. Price disclosures for services and products for 
cremation can be obtained from Montana crematories and 
funeral directors. Contact the Montana Board of Funeral 
Service for mailing addresses and phone numbers.

Regardless of whether cremation is the method of final 
disposition chosen, one member of the Montana Funeral 
Directors Association suggests that:

"When planning to honor and memorialize a person 
who has died, the family should plan a funeral, memorial,

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
