      <pre>Asking the Court to Appoint a Lawyer for You in a 
Lawsuit to Terminate Your Parental Rights 

Note: Use these forms and instructions to ask the court to appoint a 
lawyer  for  you  in  a  lawsuit  requesting  termination  of  your  parental 
rights, and/or for adoption of your child.  You may have a right to be 
represented  by  a  lawyer  if  a  court  is  considering  terminating  your  
parental rights.  

hese  instructions  and  forms  may  not  be  right  for  your  case.  They 
cannot take the place of advice from a lawyer. Talk to a lawyer if you 
have any questions.   

rint the forms in this packet single-sided, with writing on one side of 
the page.  Do not change these forms.  If you change the forms, you 
might lose language you need.  
 

  T

  P

ho Can Use These Forms? 

You  can  use  these  forms  if  you  are  low-income  and  someone  has  asked  the  court  to 

terminate your parental rights and/or let him or her adopt your child.  These forms are 

designed for use only in termination or adoption lawsuits where the State of Montana is 

not part of the case.     If the State of Montana through the Department of Public Health 

and Human Services has filed the lawsuit to terminate your parental rights, then these 

forms are not right for you.  [NOTE: If the State is the petitioner in the lawsuit, you can 

ask the judge to appoint a public defender to represent you in that lawsuit, and you don’t 

need  these  forms.]    These  forms  are  intended  for  use  when  an  individual  has  filed  a 

termination or adoption lawsuit against you. Usually that individual is your child’s other 

parent,  step-parent,  or  other  relative.  If  a  court  has  already  terminated  your  parental 

rights by court order, these forms are not right for you. 

hat Forms Will I Need to Ask the Court to Appoint a Lawyer for Me? 

You  will  need  to  fill  in  and  file  with  the  court  the  following  forms  to  ask  the  court  to 

appoint a lawyer to represent you:

•  Affidavit of Inability to Pay Filing Fees and Other Costs 
•  Order Appointing Counsel 

he  Motion  and  Supporting  Brief  to  Appoint  Counsel  is  for  you  to  complete  and 

sign.    It  asks  the  court  to  appoint  a  lawyer  to  represent  you.    It  also  explains  why  the 

court  is  required  to  appoint  a  lawyer  for  you.    After  you  complete  the  Motion  and 

Supporting  Brief,  you  must  send  a  copy  of  it  to  the  Petitioner(s)  and  any  other 

Respondents. 

he Affidavit of Inability to Pay is a form you can use to ask the court for permission 

to  not  pay  the  fees  the  court  charges  for  you  to  file  documents  and  participate  in  a 

lawsuit. Courts may use different names for this form.  The Affidavit of Inability to Pay 

Costs requires you to provide information about your income and expenses.  After you 

fill out the affidavit and sign it, the clerk of court will give it to the judge to review.  If the 

judge decides that you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, the judge will allow you to file 

documents and participate in the lawsuit without paying the filing fee.  You must be low-

income to have a lawyer appointed to represent you.   

The Order Appointing Counsel is for the judge to fill in, except for the caption that you 

will fill in.  The Order tells you that a lawyer has been appointed to represent you.   

hat Words Do I Need to Know? 

 

  Petitioner  is  someone  who  files  a  termination  or  adoption  lawsuit  in  court.    If 

someone has asked the court to terminate your parental rights and/or to let him or her 

adopt  your  child,  that  person  is  the  Petitioner.    If  more  than  one  person  is  seeking 

termination and/or adoption, there will be more than one petitioner in the lawsuit. 

A  Respondent  is  someone  who  is  required  to  answer,  or  respond,  to  a  petition.    If 

someone has asked the court to terminate your parental rights and/or to let him or her

Make Copies 

  Make two copies of your Motion and Supporting Brief to Appoint Counsel.  

You will need additional copies if there is more than one Petitioner or more 

than one Respondent.  You will need one copy of each document for each 

Petitioner and Respondent. 

  Make  one  copy  of  the  Order  to  Appoint  Counsel  and  your  Affidavit  of

Ask  the  clerk  to  date-stamp  your  copies  of  the  Motion,  to  show  the  date 

the Motion was filed.  The date-stamped copy of each is for you to keep.

Give the Order Appointing Counsel to the clerk.  Ask the clerk to lodge the 

Order  Appointing  Counsel  in  the file.    “Lodging”  means  that  the  clerk  will 

not officially file the document in your court file, but will just keep the Order 

Appointing  Counsel  inside  the  court file  so  the  judge  can  look  at  it  in  the 

future.  If  the  clerk  will  not  lodge  the  Order  Appointing  Counsel,  you  will 

need  to  keep  the  Order  Appointing  Counsel  in  a  safe  place  until  your 

hearing.  You will need to take the Order Appointing Counsel with you to 

the hearing so you can ask to give it to the judge then. 

Mail your Motion and Supporting Brief to Appoint Counsel 

 

On  the  same  day  you  file  with  the  Clerk  of  Court  your  Motion  and 

Supporting  Brief  to  Appoint  Counsel,  mail  a  copy  of  your  Motion  and

in  the  “certificate  of  service”  section  at  the  end  of  the  Motion.    Mail  the 

documents to the name and address for each petitioner as shown on the 

court  papers  filed  by  each  petitioner.    If  there  is  another  respondent 

besides  you,  mail  the  documents  to  the  name  and  address  for  each 

respondent as shown on the court papers filed by each respondent.  The 

name  and  address  for  each  party  in  the  lawsuit  is  usually  in  the  top  left 

hand corner of the first page of the court paper filed by that party.  If the 

petitioner  or  other  respondent  has  a  lawyer,  this  will  be  the  lawyer’s 

address.   

 

It is a good idea to have proof that you actually mailed your Motion to each 

petitioner and any other respondent, or their attorneys.  You can get proof 

by  using  the  United  States  Postal  Service’s  “Certificate  of  Mailing.”    The 

post office charges more for the Certificate of Mailing than a regular letter.  

The post office receipt that you get from the post office is your proof that 

you actually mailed your Motion to the correct address on a certain date.  

Be  sure  to  keep  the  post  office  receipt,  and  take  it  with  you  to  your

The  laws  of  Montana  are  called  the  Montana  Code  Annotated  or  “MCA.”    The  laws

Brief 

The Montana Supreme Court has held that indigent parents like me are entitled 

to court-appointed counsel in termination proceedings.  In the Matter of the Adoption of 

A.W.S. and K.R.S., 2014 MT 322, 377 Mont. 234, 339 P.3d 414.   In that case, the 

district court had terminated a mother’s rights after the children’s stepmother filed a 

petition for adoption.  The Montana Supreme Court reversed the termination of the 

mother’s rights, and remanded the case to the district court to appoint counsel for the 

mother, if she was found financially eligible.  The Court considered Article II, Section 4, 

of the Montana Constitution and concluded that “Montana’s right to equal protection 

requires that counsel be appointed for indigent parents in termination proceedings 

brought under the Adoption Act.”  A.W.S., 2014 MT 322, ¶26.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
