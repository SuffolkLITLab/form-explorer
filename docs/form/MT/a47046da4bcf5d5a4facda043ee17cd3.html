No. AF 08-0203

IN THE MATTER OF THE 2008 MONTANA 
CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT

O R D E R

_________________

In  June  of  2003,  observing  that  Montana  was  the  only  jurisdiction  in  the  nation 

which  continued  to  subscribe  to  the  Canons  of  Judicial  Ethics,  this Court  established  a 

Commission on the Code of Judicial Conduct (the Commission) to study and consider the 

adoption of a version of the American Bar Association Model Code of Judicial Conduct

(ABA  Code).    The  Court  determined  that  adopting  a  version  of  the  ABA  Code  would 

serve  the  current  needs  of  Montana’s  judicial  branch,  provide  uniformity,  and  provide 

access to a national database of decisions and ethics opinions.

The  Commission  was  chaired  by  Justice  Patricia  Cotter  and  included  as  its 

members Chief Justice Karla Gray, Justice James C. Nelson, Justice John Warner, Hon. 

Katherine Curtis, Hon. Blair Jones, Hon. Karen Orzech, G. Lewis Scott, Esq., Richard J. 

Dolan, Esq., Professor David J. Patterson, and Holly Kaleczyc.

The  Commission’s work  was  delayed  while  the  ABA  undertook  a  significant 

revision  of the existing  ABA Model Code of  Judicial Conduct.  It was the desire of the

Commission to tailor the Montana Code as closely as possible to the ABA national code, 

as  revised,  while  adapting  it  to  the  realities  of  the  operation  of  the  judicial  system  and 

judicial  elections  in  the  state  of  Montana.    Once  the  ABA  Code  was  finalized,  the 

Commission convened  duly  noticed  open  meetings  on  eight  occasions.    Ultimately,  the 

Commission’s  recommendations  for  the  Montana  Code  of  Judicial  Conduct  were 

approved  by  the  members  of  the  Commission,  and  then  submitted  for  comment  to  the 

1

members  of  the  judiciary  and  the  members  of  the  State  Bar,  with  a  comment  period 

closing on June 18, 2008.  Thereafter, the Commission revisited its recommendations in 

light of the comments received.  Certain changes to the recommended rules were made as 

a result of the comments, and the final proposed Code was then presented to this Court 

for 

its 

review  and  approval. 

  Having  now  considered 

the  Commission’s 

recommendations, and with our thanks and gratitude to the Commission for its hard work 

and service, we adopt the following Order:

IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  the  2008  Montana  Code  of  Judicial  Conduct, 

attached hereto as Exhibit A, is approved and adopted.  The comments to the rules are not 

adopted as rules, but are provided for interpretation and guidance only.  These rules shall 

be effective January 1, 2009.

IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  a  copy  of  t h i s   Order,  together  with 

Concurrences and Dissent, and with the attached Exhibit A in Word and PDF document 

links,  be  electronically  published  on 

the  website 

for 

the  Judicial  Branch, 

http://www.courts.mt.gov, 

and 

on 

the  State  Bar 

of  Montana  website, 

http://www.montanabar.org,  and  that  a  copy  of  this Order  be  published  in  the  next 

available issue of The Montana Lawyer, the next Lawyer’s Deskbook and Directory, and 

in  the  next  available  issue  of  the  Montana  Reports.    Persons  unable  to  access  these 

documents  electronically  may  request  a  paper  copy  of  the  same  through  the  State  Law 

Library,  P.O.  Box 203004,  Helena,  MT,  59620-3004  (406-444-1977)  upon  advance 

payment of reasonable photocopying and postage charges. 

IT  IS  FURTHER ORDERED  that  the  Clerk  of  this Court  send  a  copy  of  this 

Order, together with Concurrences and Dissent and Exhibit A, either electronically or by 

U.S. mail to the following persons and organizations:  

the Clerk of each District Court of the state of Montana; 

each District Court Judge of the state of Montana;

the Judge of the Workers’ Compensation Court;

the Chief Judge of the Water Court; 

2

the State Bar of Montana;

of Limited Jurisdiction;

the chairperson of the Commission on Courts of Limited Jurisdiction;

the Presidents of the Montana Judges’  Association and the Montana Magistrates’ 
Association;

Justice W. William Leaphart, concurring.

I concur in the Court’s adoption of the 2008 Montana Code of Judicial Conduct.  I 

write separately to point out what I see as an internal inconsistency in Rule 3.6.  We, as 

United States citizens have a constitutionally protected right to the freedom of association 

and the free exercise of religion.  First Amendment, U.S. Const. Rule 3.6(A) restricts the 

freedom  of  association  by  requiring  that  a  judge  “shall  not  hold  membership  in  any 

organization  that  practices  invidious  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  race,  sex,  gender, 

religion, national origin, ethnicity or sexual orientation.”  Rule 3.6(C) however, provides 

that a judge’s membership in a religious organization as a lawful exercise of the freedom 

of religion and is not a violation of this Rule.  

It goes without saying that there are many religious organizations that discriminate 

on  the  basis  of  gender,  race  and/or  sexual  orientation.    If,  under  the  auspices  of  free 

exercise  of  religion,  i t   is  permissible  to  belong  to  a  religious  organization  that 

discriminates  against  gays  or  prohibits  women  from  being  part  of  the  church  clergy,  it 

would  seem  that  the  freedom  of  association  would  likewise  allow  one  to  belong  to  a 

nonreligious  private  club  or  “klan”  that  discriminates  on  the  basis  of  race,  gender  or 

sexual orientation. 

If, in the spirit of the Code of Judicial Conduct, affiliation with entities that engage 

in  discriminatory  conduct  is  abhorrent,  the  Code  should  be  consistent  in  its  prohibition 

and  not  carve  out  an  exception  for  organizations  that  practice  invidious  discrimination 

under the name of religion. 

/S/ W. WILLIAM LEAPHART

Justice Jim Rice, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

I join the Court in expressing thanks to the Commission for its work in crafting a 

code  of  judicial  conduct  for  Montana.    I  support  adoption  of  the  Code  and  have  only  a 

couple concerns, as follows:  

1.    Rule  2.11.    Although  I  have  reservations  about  this Rule  in  light  of  the  U.S. 

Supreme Court’s decision in Republican Party v. White, I accept it as a good faith effort 

to provide a rule which conforms with White, as represented in the ABA’s Annotations to 

the Model Code, Canon 5A(3)(d), p. 355, and thus support the Rule as written.  In light of 

pending  litigation,  I  would  caution  that  the  Rule  may  need  to  be  revisited  to 

accommodate future court decisions. 

2.    Rule  3.6(A).    This Rule  prohibits  a  judge  from  holding  membership  in  an 

organization  which  practices  discrimination  (see  also  Comment  [3]  to  Rule  3.1,  which 

similarly  provides  that  “a  judge’s  extrajudicial  activities  must  not  be  conducted  in 

connection  or  affiliation  with  an  organization  that  practices  invidious  discrimination.”).  

These rules list out the bases on which the organizations may not discriminate, including 

sexual  orientation.    Unlike  the  other  listed  bases,  sexual  orientation  is  not  a  protected 

class  under  Montana  law  (see  generally,  Title  49,  MCA) and  the  extension  of  such 

protection is a controversial public policy issue, as evidenced by legislative measures and 

voter initiatives addressing aspects of the issue here and around the country.  Montana’s 

most  recent  statement  related  to  the  issue  was  the  adoption  in  2004  of  CI-96,  a 

constitutional prohibition on same-sex marriage.  For these reasons, I believe we should 

5

use the law as our guide, and not restrict a judge’s constitutional right to be a member of 

an organization that may be perceived as practicing discrimination, but on a basis which 

is not prohibited by  law.  The  anomaly here  created is that a judge would  be subject to 

sanction  because  of  membership  in  an  organization  which  is  doing  nothing  illegal.  

Although the Code contains a religious exemption, some nonreligious organizations also 

restrict membership for legal reasons.  If Montana law would change in this regard, that 

would present a different situation.

3.  Rule 4.1(A)(5).  I would delete this provision from the Code and allow judges 

or  judicial  candidates  to  attend  events  sponsored  by  a  partisan  political  candidate.    I 

believe such practices reflect the reality of Montana culture, particularly within our many 

small, rural communities.  There, judicial candidates often buy tickets or appear at a local 

politician’s  event,  and  do  so  without  endorsing  the  candidate.    I  recall  attending  a 

Republican  dinner  in  a  rural  county  which  was  also  attended  by  a  large  contingent  of 

local  Democrats.    Everyone  was  grinning  from  ear  to  ear,  because  it  was  more  about 

community  than  anything  else.    Further,  events  such  as  campaign  visits by  presidential 

candidates are often historical events which judges should be able to observe without fear 

of sanction.

/S/ JIM RICE

Justice John Warner joins in the concurrence and dissent of Justice Jim Rice.  

I  too  thank  the  many  that  have  worked  very  hard  to  draft  long  overdue  updated 

Code  of  Judicial  Conduct  for  Montana.    It was  truly  a  difficult  task  which  was  well 

performed.  I understand that no written canons of judicial ethics can be perfect.  I have 

every  confidence  that  the  Montana  Judicial  Standards  Commission  and  this Court  will 

interpret and apply the Code adopted today in a fair and reasonable manner, considering 

the  myriad  difficulties  facing  Montana’s  judicial  officers,  and  to  the  benefit  of  the 

citizens of Montana.  I join in Justice Rice’s concurrence and dissent.

2008 MONTANA CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT

PREAMBLE

[1] An  independent, fair, and  impartial  judiciary  is  indispensable to our system of  justice.  The 
United  States  legal  system  is  based  upon  the  principle  that  an  independent,  impartial,  and 
competent judiciary, composed of men and women of integrity, will interpret and apply the law 
that governs our society. Thus, the  judiciary plays a central role  in preserving the principles of 
justice and the rule of law. Inherent in all the Rules contained in this Code are the precepts that 
judges, individually and collectively, must respect and honor the judicial office as a public trust 
and strive to maintain and enhance confidence in the legal system. 

[2] Judges should maintain the dignity of judicial office at all times, and avoid both impropriety 
and the appearance of impropriety in their professional and personal lives.  They should aspire at 
all times to conduct that ensures the greatest possible public confidence  in their  independence, 
impartiality, integrity, and competence.

[3]  The  Code  of  Judicial  Conduct  establishes  standards  for  the  ethical  conduct  of  judges  and 
judicial  candidates.  It  is  not  intended  as  an  exhaustive  guide  for  the  conduct  of  judges  and 
judicial  candidates,  who  are  governed  in  their  judicial  and  personal  conduct  by  general  ethical 
standards as well as by the Code.  The Code is intended, however, to provide guidance and assist 
judges  in  maintaining  the  highest  standards  of  judicial  and  personal  conduct,  and  to  provide  a 
basis for regulating their conduct through disciplinary agencies.

1

SCOPE

[1] The Code of Judicial Conduct consists of  four Canons,  numbered Rules under each Canon, 
and Comments that generally follow and explain each Rule.  Scope and Terminology paragraphs 
provide  additional  guidance  in  interpreting  and  applying  the  Code.   An  Application  paragraph
establishes  when  the  various  Rules  apply  to  a  judge  or  judicial  candidate.    The  Code  is  not 
designed or intended as a basis for civil or criminal liability.  Neither is it intended to be the basis 
for litigants to seek to change a judge’s decision, to seek collateral remedies against each other, 
or to obtain tactical advantages in proceedings before a court.

[2]  The  Canons  state  overarching  principles  of  judicial  ethics  that  all  judges  must  observe.  
Although  a  judge  may  be  disciplined  only  for  violating  a  Rule,  the  Canons  provide  important 
guidance in interpreting the Rules. Where a Rule contains a permissive term, such as “may” or 
“should,” the conduct being addressed  is committed to the personal and professional discretion 
of  the  judge  or  candidate  in  question,  and  no  disciplinary  action  should  be  taken  for  action  or 
inaction within the bounds of such discretion.

[3] The Comments that accompany the Rules serve two functions.  First, they provide guidance 
regarding the purpose, meaning, and proper application of the Rules.  They contain explanatory 
material  and,  in  some  instances,  provide  examples  of  permitted  or  prohibited  conduct. 
Comments  neither  add  to  nor  subtract  from  the  binding  obligations  set  forth  in  the  Rules. 
Therefore, when a Comment contains the term “must,” it does not mean that the Comment itself 
is binding or enforceable; it signifies that the Rule in question, properly understood, is obligatory 
as to the conduct at issue. 

[4]  Second,  the  Comments  identify  aspirational  goals  for  judges.  To  implement  fully  the 
principles of this Code as articulated in the Canons, judges should strive to exceed the standards 
of  conduct  established  by  the  Rules,  holding  themselves  to  the  highest  ethical  standards  and 
seeking to achieve those aspirational goals, thereby enhancing the dignity of the judicial office. 

[5]  The  Rules  of  the  Code  of  Judicial  Conduct  are  rules  of  reason  that  should  be  applied 
consistent  with  constitutional  requirements,  statutes,  other  court  rules,  and  decisional  law,  and 
with due regard for all relevant circumstances.  The Rules should not be interpreted to impinge 
upon the essential independence of judges in making judicial decisions.  

[6] Although the black letter of the Rules is binding and enforceable, it is not contemplated that 
every  transgression  will  result  in  the  imposition  of  discipline.  Whether  discipline  should  be 
imposed should be determined through a reasonable and reasoned application of the Rules, and 
should  depend  upon  factors such  as  the  seriousness  of  the  transgression,  the  facts  and 
circumstances that existed at the time of the transgression, the extent of any pattern of improper 
activity,  whether  there  have  been  previous  violations,  and  the  effect  of  the  improper  activity 
upon the judicial system or others. 

2

TERMINOLOGY

The first time any term listed below is used in any given Rule in its defined sense, it is followed 
by an asterisk (*).  

“Appropriate authority” means the authority having responsibility for initiation of disciplinary 
process in connection with the violation to be reported.  See Rule 2.16. 

“Contribution” means  both financial and  in-kind contributions, such as goods, professional or 
volunteer services, advertising, and other types of assistance, which, if obtained by the recipient 
otherwise, would require a financial expenditure.  See Rules 3.7, 4.1, and 4.4. 

“Courts of limited jurisdiction”  means  justice courts, justice courts of record, city courts and 
municipal  courts.    Where  the  context  allows  and  for  simplicity,  the  justices  of  the  peace  and 
judges of such courts may be collectively referred to as judges.  See Rules 2.9 and 2.10.

“De  minimis,”  in  the  context  of  interests  pertaining  to  disqualification  of  a  judge,  means  an 
insignificant interest that could not raise a reasonable question regarding the judge’s impartiality. 
See Rule 2.12.

“Domestic partner”  means a person with whom another person maintains  a household and an 
intimate relationship, other than a person to whom he or she is legally married.  See Rules 2.12, 
3.13, and 3.14.

“Economic  interest”  means  ownership  of  more  than  a  de  minimis  legal  or  equitable  interest. 
Except  for  situations  in  which  the  judge  participates  in  the  management  of  such  a  legal  or 
equitable interest, or the interest could be substantially affected by the outcome of a proceeding 
before a judge, it does not include: 

(1) an interest in the individual holdings within a mutual or common investment fund; 

(2)  an  interest  in  securities  held  by  an  educational,  religious,  charitable,  fraternal,  or  civic 
organization in which the judge or the judge’s spouse, domestic partner, parent, or child serves as 
a director, an officer, an advisor, or other participant; 

(3) a deposit in a financial institution or deposits or proprietary interests the judge may maintain 
as a member of a mutual savings association or credit union, or similar proprietary interests; or 

(4) an interest in the issuer of government securities held by the judge. 

See Rules 1.3, 2.12, and 3.2.

“Ex  parte  communication”  is  any  oral  communication  to  a  judge  concerning  a  pending  or 
impending  matter, outside the presence of all the  parties to the proceeding or their attorneys or 
outside the confines of a duly  noticed proceeding, or any written communication received  by  a 
judge that is not simultaneously provided to all parties or their attorneys.  See Rules 2.9 and 2.10.

3

“Fiduciary”  includes  relationships  such  as  executor,  administrator,  trustee,  or  guardian.   See 
Rules 2.12, 3.2, and 3.8.

6

CANON 1

A  JUDGE  SHALL  UPHOLD  AND  PROMOTE  THE  INDEPENDENCE,  INTEGRITY, 
AND  IMPARTIALITY  OF  THE  JUDICIARY,  AND  SHALL  AVOID  IMPROPRIETY 
AND THE APPEARANCE OF IMPROPRIETY. 

A judge shall comply with the law,* including the Code of Judicial Conduct. 

RULE 1.1
Compliance with the Law

RULE 1.2
Promoting Confidence in the Judiciary

A  judge  shall  act  at  all  times  in  a  manner  that  promotes  public  confidence  in  the 
independence,* integrity,* and impartiality* of the judiciary, and shall avoid impropriety*
and the appearance of impropriety. 

COMMENT 

[1] Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by improper conduct and conduct that creates the 
appearance of impropriety.  This principle applies to both the professional and personal conduct 
of a judge.

[2]  A  judge  should  expect  to  be  the  subject  of  public  scrutiny  that  might  be  viewed  as 
burdensome if applied to other citizens, and must accept the restrictions imposed by the Code.

[3]  Conduct  that  compromises  or  appears  to  compromise  the  independence,  integrity,  and 
impartiality  of  a  judge  undermines  public  confidence  in  the  judiciary.  Because  it  is  not 
practicable to list all such conduct, the Rule is necessarily cast in general terms.

[4]  Judges  should  participate  in  activities  that  promote  ethical  conduct  among  judges  and 
lawyers,  support  professionalism  within  the  judiciary  and  the  legal  profession,  and  promote 
access to justice for all.

[5] Actual  improprieties  include  violations of  law, court rules, or provisions of this Code.  The 
test  for  appearance  of  impropriety  is  whether the  conduct  would  create  in  reasonable  minds  a 
perception that the judge violated this Code or engaged  in other conduct that reflects adversely 
on the judge’s honesty, impartiality, temperament, or fitness to serve as a judge. 

[6]  A  judge  should  initiate  and  participate  in  community  outreach  activities  for  the  purpose of 
promoting public understanding of and confidence in the administration of justice.  In conducting
such activities, the judge must act in a manner consistent with this Code.

7

RULE 1.3
Avoiding Abuse of the Prestige of Judicial Office

A judge shall not abuse the prestige of judicial office to advance the personal or economic 
interests* of the judge or others, or allow others to do so. 

COMMENT

[1]  It  is  improper  for  a  judge  to  use  or  attempt  to  use  his  or  her  position  to  gain  personal 
advantage or deferential treatment of any kind.  For example, it would be improper for a judge to 
allude to his or her judicial status to gain favorable treatment in encounters with traffic officials. 
Similarly, a judge must not use judicial letterhead to gain an advantage in conducting his or her 
personal business.

[2] A judge may provide a reference or recommendation for an individual based upon the judge’s 
personal  knowledge.  The  judge  may  use  official  letterhead  if  the  judge  indicates  that  the 
reference is personal and if there is no likelihood that the use of the letterhead would reasonably 
be perceived as an attempt to exert pressure by reason of the judicial office.

[3]  Judges  may  participate  in  the  process  of  judicial  selection  by  cooperating  with  appointing 
authorities  and  screening  committees,  and  by  responding  to  inquiries  from  such  entities 
concerning the professional qualifications of a person being considered for judicial office.

[4]  Special  considerations  arise  when  judges  write  or  contribute  to  publications  of  for-profit 
entities, whether related or unrelated to the  law.  A  judge should  not permit anyone associated 
with the publication of such materials to exploit the judge’s office in a manner that violates this 
Rule or other applicable law.  In contracts for publication of a judge’s writing, the judge should 
retain sufficient control over the advertising to avoid such exploitation.

8

A JUDGE SHALL  PERFORM THE DUTIES OF JUDICIAL OFFICE IMPARTIALLY, 
COMPETENTLY, AND DILIGENTLY.

CANON 2

RULE 2.1
Giving Precedence to the Duties of Judicial Office

The  duties  of  judicial  office,  as  prescribed  by  law,*  shall  take  precedence  over  all  of  a 
judge’s personal and extrajudicial activities.

COMMENT

[1] To ensure that judges are available to fulfill their  judicial duties,  judges  must conduct their 
personal and extrajudicial activities to minimize the risk of conflicts that would result in frequent 
disqualification.  See Canon 3.

[2] Although it is not a duty of judicial office unless prescribed by law, judges are encouraged to 
participate  in  activities  that  promote  public  understanding  of  and  confidence  in  the  justice 
system.

RULE 2.2 
Impartiality and Fairness

COMMENT

A  judge  shall  uphold  and  apply  the  law,*  and  shall  perform  all  duties  of  judicial  office 
fairly and impartially.*

[1] To ensure impartiality and fairness to all parties, a judge must be objective and open-minded.

[2] Although each judge comes to the bench with a unique background and personal philosophy, 
a  judge  must  interpret  and  apply  the  law  without  regard  to  whether  the  judge  approves  or 
disapproves of the law in question.

[3] When applying and  interpreting the  law, a  judge sometimes  may  make good-faith errors of 
fact or law.  Errors of this kind do not violate this Rule.

[4] A judge should manage the courtroom in a manner that provides all litigants the opportunity 
to have their matters fairly adjudicated in accordance with the law.  

[5]  A  judge  may  make  reasonable  accommodations  to  ensure  self-represented  litigants  the 
opportunity to have their matters fairly heard.

9

RULE 2.3
Bias, Prejudice, and Harassment

(A)  A  judge  shall  perform  the  duties  of  judicial  office,  including  administrative duties, 
without bias or prejudice.

(B) A judge shall not, in the performance of judicial duties, by words or conduct manifest 
bias or prejudice, or engage in harassment, including but not limited to bias, prejudice, or 
harassment based upon race, sex, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age, 
sexual orientation, marital status, socioeconomic status, or political affiliation, and shall not 
permit court staff, court officials, or others subject to the judge’s direction and control to 
do so.

(C)  A  judge  shall  require  lawyers  in  proceedings  before  the  court  to  refrain  from 
manifesting bias or prejudice, or engaging in harassment, based upon attributes including 
but  not  limited  to  race,  sex,  gender,  religion,  national origin,  ethnicity,  disability,  age, 
sexual  orientation,  marital  status,  socioeconomic  status,  or  political  affiliation,  against 
parties, witnesses, lawyers, or others.

(D)  The  restrictions  of  paragraphs  (B)  and  (C)  do  not  preclude  judges  or  lawyers  from 
making legitimate reference to the listed factors, or similar factors, when they are relevant 
to an issue in a proceeding.

COMMENT

[1]  A  judge  who  manifests  bias  or  prejudice  in  a  proceeding  impairs  the  fairness  of  the 
proceeding and brings the judiciary into disrepute.

[2] Examples of manifestations of bias or prejudice include, but are not limited to, epithets; slurs; 
demeaning  nicknames;  negative  stereotyping;  attempted  humor  based  upon  stereotypes; 
threatening,  intimidating, or hostile acts; suggestions of connections  between race, ethnicity, or 
nationality  and  crime;  and  irrelevant  references  to  personal  characteristics.  Even  facial 
expressions and body language can convey to parties and lawyers in the proceeding, jurors, the 
media,  and  others  an  appearance  of  bias  or  prejudice.  A  judge  must  avoid  conduct  that  may 
reasonably be perceived as prejudiced or biased.

[3]  Harassment,  as  referred  to  in  paragraphs  (B)  and  (C),  is  verbal  or  physical  conduct  that 
denigrates  or  shows  hostility  or  aversion  toward  a  person  on  bases  such  as  race,  sex,  gender, 
religion,  national  origin,  ethnicity,  disability,  age,  sexual  orientation,  marital  status, 
socioeconomic status, or political affiliation.

[4] Sexual harassment includes but is not limited to sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, 
and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that is unwelcome.

10

RULE 2.4
External Influences on Judicial Conduct

(A) A judge shall not be swayed by public clamor or fear of criticism.

(B)  A  judge  shall  not  permit  family,  social,  political,  financial,  or  other  interests  or 
relationships to influence the judge’s judicial conduct or judgment. 

(C) A judge shall not convey or permit others to convey the impression that any person or 
organization is in a position to influence the judge. 

COMMENT

[1]  An  independent  judiciary  requires  that  judges  decide  cases  according  to  the  law  and  facts, 
without regard to whether particular  laws or  litigants are popular or unpopular with the public, 
the media, government officials, or the judge’s friends or family.  Confidence in the judiciary is 
eroded if judicial decision making is perceived to be subject to inappropriate outside influences.  

RULE 2.5
Competence, Diligence, and Cooperation

(A) A judge shall perform judicial and administrative duties competently and diligently.

(B) A judge shall cooperate with other judges  and court officials in the administration of 
court business.

COMMENT

[1]  Competence  in  the  performance  of  judicial  duties  requires  the  legal  knowledge,  skill, 
thoroughness,  and  preparation  reasonably  necessary  to  perform  a  judge’s  responsibilities  of 
judicial office. 

[2]  A  judge  should  seek  the  necessary  docket  time,  court  staff,  expertise,  and  resources  to 
discharge all adjudicative and administrative responsibilities.

[3] Prompt disposition of the court’s business requires a judge to devote adequate time to judicial 
duties,  to  be  punctual  in  attending court  and  expeditious  in  determining  matters  under 
submission,  and  to  take  reasonable  measures  to  ensure  that  court  officials,  litigants,  and  their 
lawyers cooperate with the judge to that end.

[4] In disposing of matters promptly and efficiently, a judge must demonstrate due regard for the 
rights of parties to be  heard and to have  issues resolved without unnecessary  cost or delay.  A 
judge  should  monitor  and  supervise  cases  in  ways  that  reduce  or  eliminate  dilatory  practices, 
avoidable delays, and unnecessary costs.  In accomplishing these critical goals in the increasing 

11

number  of  cases  involving  self-represented  litigants,  a  judge  may  take  appropriate  steps  to 
facilitate a self-represented litigant’s ability to be heard.

RULE 2.6
Ensuring the Right to Be Heard

(A) A judge shall accord to every person who has a legal interest in a proceeding, or that 
person’s lawyer, the right to be heard according to law.*

(B) A judge may encourage parties to a proceeding and their  lawyers to settle matters in 
dispute but shall not act in a manner that coerces any party into settlement.

COMMENT

[1]  The  right  to  be  heard  is  an  essential  component  of  a  fair  and  impartial  system  of  justice. 
Substantive rights of litigants can be protected only if procedures protecting the right to be heard 
are observed.

[2]  The  judge  plays  an  important  role  in  overseeing  the  settlement  of  disputes,  but  should  be 
careful that efforts to further settlement do not undermine any party’s right to be heard according 
to  law.  The  judge  should  keep  in  mind  the  effect  that  the  judge’s  participation  in  settlement
discussions may have, not only on the judge’s own views of the case, but also on the perceptions 
of  the  lawyers  and  the  parties  if  the  case  remains  with  the  judge  after  settlement  efforts  are 
unsuccessful.  Among  the  factors that  a  judge  should  consider  when  deciding  upon  an 
appropriate  settlement  practice  for  a  case  are:    (1)  whether  the  parties  have  requested  or 
voluntarily consented to a certain level of participation by the judge in settlement discussions, (2) 
whether the parties and their counsel are relatively sophisticated in legal matters, (3) whether the 
case will be tried by the judge or a jury, (4) whether the parties participate with their counsel in 
settlement discussions, (5) whether any parties are unrepresented by counsel, and (6) whether the 
matter is civil or criminal.

[3]  Judges  must  be  mindful  of  the  effect  settlement  discussions  can  have,  not  only  on  their 
objectivity  and  impartiality,  but  also  on  the  appearance  of  their  objectivity  and  impartiality. 
Despite  a  judge’s  best  efforts,  there  may  be  instances  when  information obtained  during 
settlement  discussions  could  influence  a  judge’s  decision  making  during  trial,  and,  in  such 
instances,  the  judge  should  consider  whether disqualification  may  be  appropriate.   See  Rule 
2.12(A)(1). 

12

RULE 2.7
Responsibility to Decide

COMMENT

A judge shall hear and decide matters assigned to the judge, except when disqualification is 
required by Rule 2.12 or other law.*

[1] Judges must be available to decide the matters that come before the court.  Although there are 
times  when  disqualification  is  necessary  to  protect  the  rights  of  litigants  and  preserve  public 
confidence  in  the  independence,  integrity,  and  impartiality  of  the  judiciary,  judges  must  be 
available to decide matters that come before the courts.  Unwarranted disqualification may bring 
public  disfavor  to the  court  and  to  the  judge  personally.  The  dignity  of  the  court, the  judge’s 
respect  for  fulfillment  of  judicial  duties,  and  a  proper  concern  for  the  burdens  that  may  be 
imposed upon the judge’s colleagues require that a judge not use disqualification to avoid cases 
that present difficult, controversial, or unpopular issues. 

RULE 2.8
Decorum, Demeanor, and Communication with Jurors

(A) A judge shall require order and decorum in proceedings before the court.

(B) A judge shall be patient, dignified, and courteous to litigants, jurors, witnesses, lawyers, 
court staff, court officials, and others with whom the judge deals in an official capacity, and 
shall  require  similar  conduct  of  lawyers,  court  staff,  court  officials,  and  others  subject  to 
the judge’s direction and control.

(C)  A  judge  shall  not  commend  or  criticize  jurors  for  their  verdict  other  than  in  a  court 
order or opinion in a proceeding.

COMMENT

[1] The duty to hear all proceedings with patience and courtesy is not inconsistent with the duty 
imposed in Rule 2.5 to dispose promptly of the business of the court.  Judges can be efficient and 
businesslike while being patient and deliberate.

[2] Commending or criticizing jurors for their verdict may imply a judicial expectation in future 
cases and may impair a juror’s ability to be fair and impartial in a subsequent case.

[3]  A  judge  who  is  not otherwise  prohibited  by  law  from  doing  so  may  meet  with  jurors  who 
choose to remain after trial but should be careful not to discuss the merits of the case.

13

RULE 2.9
Ex Parte Communications;* Investigations—Courts of Limited Jurisdiction*

(A)  Except  as  permitted  in  paragraph  (C)  of  this  Rule,  a  judge  of  a  court  of  limited 
jurisdiction  shall  not  investigate  the  substantive  facts,  circumstances,  or  merits of  a 
pending* or impending* matter.  

(B)  Except  as  permitted in  paragraph  (D)  of  this  Rule,  a  judge  of  a  court  of  limited 
jurisdiction shall not initiate, permit, or consider ex parte communications.*

(C) When circumstances or the interests of justice require it or when expressly authorized 
by law,* a judge of a court of limited jurisdiction may examine the criminal record, driving 
record,  and  on-line  court  records  repository  pertaining  to  a  defendant  in  a  pending  or 
impending matter which is on file within an agency of the state of Montana for the purpose 
of determining whether the charge is lawful or for purposes of setting bail or sentencing.  A 
judge  may  not  amend  the  charge  except  on  motion  of  the  prosecutor  and  as  otherwise 
provided by law. 

(D) When circumstances or the interests of justice require it or when expressly authorized 
by law, a judge of a court of limited jurisdiction may: 

(1)  engage  in  ex  parte  communications  involving  administrative,  ministerial  or 
scheduling matters provided: 

(a)  the  judge  reasonably  believes  that  no  party  will  gain  a  procedural  or 
tactical advantage as a result of the ex parte communication; and 

(b) the judge notifies all other parties, if necessary to prevent any party from 
gaining a procedural or tactical advantage.  

(2) consult with court staff and court officials whose functions are to aid the judge in 
carrying  out  the  judge’s  adjudicative  responsibilities,  with  other  judges  or  with 
peace officers, prosecutors, and defense counsel provided: 

(a)  that  the  judge  avoids  receiving  factual  information  that  is  not  a  part  of 
the record or part of the defendant’s criminal or driving record; and 

(b)  that  the  judge  does  not  abrogate  his  or  her  responsibility  to  personally 
adjudicate the matter fairly and impartially.*

(3) receive ex parte communications in proceedings in open court if the prosecutor is 
not present, provided:

(a) that the prosecutor has not otherwise informed the judge in writing of his 
or her desire or willingness to appear; and 

14

(b)  that the  judge  shall  not  try  a  case  to  the  court  or  to  a  jury  without  the 
presence of a prosecutor.

(4)  verify  whether  a  party  has  a  valid  driver’s  license  and  mandatory  automobile 
insurance  and  whether  a  party  is  complying  with  any  restitution  requirement  or 
conditions imposed in a sentence. 

(5)  receive  ex  parte  communications  in  proceedings  involving  temporary  orders  of 
protection provided that the respondent has been given notice and an opportunity to 
appear to the extent required by law.

(6)  Except  as  set  forth  in  subparagraphs  (1)  through  (5),  if  a  judge  receives  an  ex 
parte communication or other information having a potentially  significant bearing 
upon the substance of a  matter, the judge shall  make provision promptly to notify 
the  parties  of  the  content  of  the  communication  or  information  and  provide  the 
parties with an opportunity to respond.  If such communication or information is in 
writing, a copy of it shall be made available to the parties and retained. 

(E) A judge shall make reasonable efforts, including providing appropriate supervision, to 
ensure that this Rule is not violated by court staff, court officials, and others subject to the 
judge’s direction and control.

COMMENT

[1] This Rule is tailored to accommodate the unique circumstances in which Montana’s courts of 
limited  jurisdiction  operate.    This  Rule  acknowledges  that  these  courts  exist  in  both  large 
metropolitan  and  isolated  rural  locations;  that  the  judges  of  these  courts  may  or  may  not  have 
clerks or other staff; that prosecutors may or may not be able to be present at all proceedings of 
the  court;  that  it  is  necessary  for  these  judges  to sometimes  speak  directly  with  a  party,  peace 
officer,  administrative  personnel,  or  insurance  agent  to  verify  or  clarify  administrative  or 
ministerial  facts;  and  that  such  courts  must  administer large  case  loads  consisting  primarily of 
misdemeanor criminal and traffic offenses and civil matters involving amounts limited by law. 

[2] This Rule provides some flexibility to the judges of courts of limited jurisdiction in dealing 
with  procedural,  administrative,  and  ministerial  matters,  while  retaining  requirements  that  the 
judge  may  not  independently  investigate  the  substantive  facts  or  merits  of  any  pending  or 
impending  matter; that notice and opportunity to be  heard  be provided  if the  judge receives or 
obtains information which may have a significant bearing upon an pending or impending matter; 
and  that  the  judge  personally  adjudicate  the  matter  at  issue  impartially  and  fairly.    While  the 
judge may use discretion and common sense, those must be exercised in accordance with the law 
and  keeping  in  mind  constitutional  rights  of  the  parties.  Nothing  in  this  Rule  abrogates  the 
judge’s obligation to comply with all applicable laws, court rules, or administrative regulations.

[3] The prohibition against a judge independently investigating the substantive facts or merits of 
any matter that is or may come before the court extends to information available in all mediums, 
including electronic.

15

[4] Judges  are  admonished  that  they  are  members  of  a  distinct  branch  of  government—the 
judiciary; that they are always to perform their duties as  neutral and detached  magistrates; and 
that they do not function as arms of local government, law enforcement, or as members of either 
the prosecution or defense “team.”  Judges do not and may not “represent” either party.

[5] This Code also controls the conduct of a judge if and when the judge functions as the court 
clerk or administrator.

RULE 2.10
Ex Parte Communications*—All Courts Except for Courts of Limited Jurisdiction*

(A)  A  judge  shall  not  initiate,  permit,  or  consider  ex  parte  communications,  except as 
follows:

(1)  When  circumstances  require  it,  ex  parte  communication  for  scheduling, 
administrative, or emergency purposes, which does not address substantive matters, 
is permitted, provided:

(a)  the  judge  reasonably  believes  that  no  party  will  gain  a  procedural, 
substantive, or tactical advantage as a result of the ex parte communication; 
and

(b)  the  judge  makes  provision promptly  to  notify  all  other  parties  of  the 
content of the ex parte communication, and gives the parties an opportunity 
to respond.

(2) A judge may consult with court staff and court officials whose  functions are to 
aid the judge in carrying out the judge’s adjudicative responsibilities, or with other 
judges,  provided  the  judge  avoids  receiving  factual  information  that  is  not part  of 
the record, and does not abrogate the responsibility personally to decide the matter. 

(3)  A  judge  may  initiate,  permit,  or  consider  any  ex  parte  communication  when 
expressly authorized by law* to do so, or when serving on therapeutic or problem-
solving  courts,  mental  health  courts,  drug  courts,  or  the  water  court.    In  this 
capacity,  judges  may  assume  a  more  interactive  role  with  parties,  treatment 
providers, probation officers, social workers, and others.

(B) If a judge receives an ex parte communication having a potentially significant bearing 
upon  the  substance  of  a  matter,  the  judge  shall  make  provision  promptly  to  notify  the 
parties of the content of the communication and provide the parties with an opportunity to 
respond.  If such  communication is in writing, a copy of it shall be  made available to the 
parties and retained.  

(C) A judge shall not investigate matters independently.*

16

(D) A judge shall make reasonable efforts, including providing appropriate supervision, to 
ensure that this Rule is not violated by court staff, court officials, and others subject to the
judge’s direction and control.

COMMENT

[1] Whenever notice to a party is required by this Rule, it is the party’s lawyer, or if the party is 
unrepresented, the party to whom notice is to be given.

[2] The proscription against communications concerning a proceeding includes communications 
with lawyers, law teachers, and other persons who are not participants in the proceeding, except 
to the limited extent permitted by this Rule.

[3] A  judge  may  initiate, permit, or consider ex  parte communications expressly authorized  by 
law, such as when serving on therapeutic or problem-solving courts, mental health courts, drug 
courts,  or  the  water  court.  In  this  capacity,  judges  may  assume  a  more  interactive  role  with 
parties, treatment providers, probation officers, social workers, and others.

[4]  A  judge  must  avoid  ex  parte  discussions  of  a  case  with  judges  who  have  previously  been 
substituted or disqualified  from  hearing the  matter, and with  judges who have trial or appellate 
jurisdiction over the matter.

[5]  The  prohibition  against  a  judge  investigating  the  facts  in  a  matter  extends  to  information 
available in all mediums, including electronic.  The prohibition does not apply to a judge’s effort 
to  obtain  general  information  about  a  specialized  area  of  knowledge  that  does  not  include  the 
application of such information in a specific case.  Nor does the prohibition apply to interstate or 
state-federal communications among judges on the general topic of case management decisions 
in  mass  torts  or  other  complex  cases,  such  as  discovery  schedules,  standard  interrogatories, 
shared  discovery  depositories,  appointment  of  liaison  counsel,  committee  membership,  or 
common fund structures.

[6] Consultations with ethics advisory committees, outside counsel, or legal experts concerning 
the judge’s compliance with this Code are permitted.  

[7]  It  is  acknowledged  that judges  frequently receive  unsolicited  ex  parte  communications.  
Judges should apply their discretion and common sense when called upon to determine whether 
any  such communication  qualifies  as  one  having  a  potentially  significant  bearing  upon  the 
substance of a matter, for purposes of paragraph (B).

RULE 2.11
Judicial Statements on Pending and Impending Cases

(A)  A  judge  shall  not  make  any  public  statement  that  might  reasonably  be  expected to 
affect the outcome or impair the fairness of a matter pending* or impending* in any court, 

17

or  make  any  nonpublic  statement  that  might  substantially  interfere  with  a  fair  trial  or 
hearing.

(B)  A  judge  shall  not,  in  connection  with  cases,  controversies,  or  issues  that  are  likely  to 
come before the court, make pledges, promises, or commitments that are inconsistent with 
the impartial* performance of the adjudicative duties of judicial office.

(C)  A  judge  shall  require  court  staff,  court  officials,  and  others  subject  to  the  judge’s 
direction  and  control  to  refrain  from  making  statements  that  the  judge  would  be 
prohibited from making by paragraphs (A) and (B).

(D) Notwithstanding the restrictions in paragraph (A), a judge may make public statements 
in  the  course  of  official  duties,  may  explain  court  procedures,  and  may  comment  on  any 
proceeding in which the judge is a litigant in a personal capacity.

(E) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (A), a judge may respond directly or through 
a third party to allegations in the media or elsewhere concerning the judge’s conduct in a 
matter.

COMMENT

[1]  This  Rule’s  restrictions  on  judicial  speech  are  essential  to  the  maintenance  of  the 
independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary.

[2] This Rule does not prohibit a judge from commenting on proceedings in which the judge is a 
litigant  in a personal  capacity.  In cases  in which the  judge  is a  litigant  in  an official  capacity, 
such as a writ of mandamus, the judge must not comment publicly.

[3] Depending upon the circumstances, the  judge  should consider whether  it  may  be preferable 
for  a  third  party,  rather  than  the  judge,  to  respond  or  issue  statements  in  connection  with 
allegations concerning the judge’s conduct in a matter.

RULE 2.12
Disqualification

(A)  A  judge  shall  disqualify  himself  or  herself  in  any  proceeding  in  which  the  judge’s 
impartiality*  might  reasonably  be  questioned,  including  but  not  limited  to  the  following 
circumstances:

(1)  The  judge  has  a  personal  bias  or  prejudice  concerning  a  party  or  a  party’s 
lawyer, or personal knowledge* of facts that are in dispute in the proceeding.

(2) The judge knows* that the judge, the judge’s spouse or domestic partner,* or a 
person  within  the third  degree  of  relationship*  to  either  of  them,  or  the  spouse  or 
domestic partner of such a person is:

18

(a)  a  party  to  the  proceeding,  or  an  officer,  director,  general  partner, 
managing member, or trustee of a party;

(b) acting as a lawyer in the proceeding;

(c)  a  person  who  has  more  than  a  de  minimis*  interest  that  could  be 
substantially affected by the proceeding; or

(d) likely to be a material witness in the proceeding.

(3)  The judge  knows  that  he  or  she,  individually  or  as  a  fiduciary,*  or  the  judge’s 
spouse,  domestic partner,  parent,  or  child,  or  any  other  member  of  the  judge’s 
family  residing in the judge’s household,* has an economic interest* in the subject 
matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding.

(4) The judge, while a judge or a judicial candidate,* has made a public statement, 
other  than  in  a  court  proceeding,  judicial  decision,  or  opinion,  that  commits  or 
appears to commit the judge to reach a particular result or rule in a particular way 
in the proceeding or controversy.

(5) The judge:

(a) served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy, or was associated with a 
lawyer who participated substantially as a lawyer in the matter during such 
association;

(b)  served  in  governmental  employment,  and  in  such  capacity  participated 
personally  and  substantially as  a  lawyer  or  public  official  concerning  the 
proceeding, or has publicly expressed in such capacity an opinion concerning 
the merits of the particular matter in controversy;

(c) was a material witness concerning the matter; or

(d) previously presided as a judge over the matter in another court.

(B)  A  judge  shall  keep  informed  about  the  judge’s  personal  and  fiduciary  economic 
interests,  and  make  a  reasonable  effort  to  keep  informed  about  the  personal  economic 
interests  of  the  judge’s  spouse  or  domestic  partner  and  minor  children  residing  in  the 
judge’s household.

(C)  A  judge  subject  to  disqualification  under  this  Rule,  other  than  for  bias  or  prejudice 
under paragraph (A)(1), may disclose in writing or on the  record the basis of the judge’s 
disqualification and may ask the parties and their lawyers to consider, outside the presence 
of  the  judge  and  court  personnel,  whether  to  waive  disqualification.  If,  following  the 
disclosure,  the  parties  and  lawyers  agree,  without  participation  by  the  judge  or  court 

19

personnel,  that  the  judge  should  not  be  disqualified,  the  judge  may  participate  in  the 
proceeding.  The agreement shall be incorporated into the record of the proceeding.

COMMENT

[1] Under this Rule, a judge  is disqualified whenever the  judge’s  impartiality  might reasonably 
be questioned, regardless of whether any of the specific provisions of paragraphs (A)(1) through 
(5) apply.

[2]  A  judge’s  obligation  not  to  hear  or  decide  matters  in  which  disqualification  is  required 
applies regardless of whether a motion to disqualify is filed.

[3] The rule of necessity may override the rule of disqualification.  For example, a judge might 
be required to participate in judicial review of a judicial salary statute, or might be the only judge 
available in a matter requiring immediate judicial action, such as a hearing on probable cause or 
a temporary restraining order.  In matters that require immediate action, the judge must disclose 
on the record the basis  for possible disqualification and  make reasonable efforts to transfer the 
matter to another judge as soon as practicable.

[4] The fact that a lawyer in a proceeding is affiliated with a law firm with which a relative of the 
judge is affiliated does not itself disqualify the judge.  If, however, the judge’s impartiality might 
reasonably be questioned under paragraph (A), or the relative is known by the judge to have an 
interest  in  the  law  firm  that  could  be  substantially  affected  by  the  proceeding  under  paragraph
(A)(2)(c), the judge’s disqualification is required.

[5] A judge should disclose on the record information that the judge believes the parties or their 
lawyers might reasonably consider relevant to a possible motion for disqualification, even if the 
judge believes there is no basis for disqualification.

[6]  “Economic  interest,”  as  set  forth  in  the  Terminology  paragraph,  means  ownership  of  more 
than a de minimis legal or equitable interest.  Except for situations in which a judge participates 
in  the  management  of  such  a  legal  or  equitable  interest,  or  the  interest  could  be  substantially 
affected by the outcome of a proceeding before a judge, it does not include:

(a) an interest in the individual holdings within a mutual or common investment fund; 
(b) an interest in securities held by an educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, or civic 
organization in which the judge or the judge’s spouse, domestic partner, parent, or child 
serves as a director, officer, advisor, or other participant; 
(c) a deposit  in a  financial  institution or deposits or proprietary  interests the  judge  may 
maintain  as  a  member  of  a  mutual  savings  association  or  credit  union,  or  similar 
proprietary interests; or 
(d) an interest in the issuer of government securities held by the judge.

20

RULE 2.13
Supervisory Duties

(A)  A  judge  shall  require  court  staff,  court  officials,  and  others  subject  to  the  judge’s 
direction and control to act in a manner consistent with the judge’s obligations under this 
Code.

(B)  A  judge  with  supervisory  authority  for  the  performance  of  other  judges  shall  take 
reasonable  measures  to  ensure  that  those  judges  properly  discharge  their  judicial 
responsibilities, including the prompt disposition of matters before them.

COMMENT

[1] A judge is responsible for his or her own conduct and for the conduct of others, such as staff, 
when those persons are acting at the judge’s direction or control.  A judge may not direct court 
personnel to engage in conduct on the judge’s behalf or as the judge’s representative when such 
conduct would violate the Code if undertaken by the judge.

[2]  Public  confidence  in  the  judicial  system  depends  upon  timely  justice.  To  promote  the 
efficient administration of justice, a judge with supervisory authority must take the steps needed 
to ensure that judges under his or her supervision administer their workloads promptly.

RULE 2.14
Administrative Appointments

(A) In making administrative appointments, a judge:

(1) shall exercise the power of appointment impartially* and on the basis of merit; 
and

(2) shall avoid nepotism, favoritism, and unnecessary appointments.

(B) A judge shall not approve compensation of appointees beyond the fair value of services 
rendered.

COMMENT

[1]  Appointees  of  a  judge  include  assigned  counsel,  officials  such  as  referees,  commissioners, 
special masters, receivers, and guardians, and personnel such as clerks, secretaries, and bailiffs.
Consent by the parties to an appointment or an award of compensation does not relieve the judge 
of the obligation prescribed by paragraph (A).

[2] Unless otherwise defined by law, nepotism is the appointment or hiring of any relative within 
the third degree of relationship of either the judge or the judge’s spouse or domestic partner, or 
the spouse or domestic partner of such relative.

21

RULE 2.15
Disability and Impairment

COMMENT

A  judge  having  a  reasonable  belief  that  the  performance  of  a  lawyer  or  another  judge  is 
impaired by drugs or alcohol, or by a mental, emotional, or physical condition, shall take 
appropriate  action,  which  may  include  a  confidential  referral  to  a  lawyer  or  judicial 
assistance program.

[1] “Appropriate action” means action intended and reasonably likely to help the judge or lawyer 
in  question  address  the  problem  and  prevent  harm  to  the  justice  system.   Depending  upon  the 
circumstances,  appropriate  action  may  include,  but  is  not  limited  to,  speaking  directly  to  the 
impaired  person,  notifying  an  individual  with  supervisory  responsibility  over  the  impaired 
person, or making a referral to an assistance program.

[2] Taking or initiating corrective action by way of referral to an assistance program may satisfy 
a judge’s responsibility under this Rule.  Assistance programs have many approaches for offering 
help to impaired judges and lawyers, such as intervention, counseling, or referral to appropriate 
health  care  professionals.   Depending  upon  the  gravity  of  the  conduct  that  has  come  to  the 
judge’s attention, however, the judge may be required to take other action, such as reporting the 
impaired judge or lawyer to the appropriate authority, agency, or body.  See Rule 2.16.

RULE 2.16
Responding to Judicial and Lawyer Misconduct

(A) A judge having knowledge* that another judge has committed a violation of this Code 
that raises a substantial question regarding the judge’s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness 
as a judge in other respects shall inform the appropriate authority.*

(B)  A  judge  having  knowledge  that  a  lawyer  has  committed  a  violation  of  the  Rules  of 
Professional  Conduct  that  raises  a  substantial  question  regarding  the  lawyer’s  honesty, 
trustworthiness, or  fitness  as  a  lawyer  in  other  respects  shall  inform  the  appropriate 
authority.

(C) A judge who receives information indicating a substantial likelihood that another judge 
has committed a violation of this Code shall take appropriate action.

(D) A judge who receives information indicating a substantial likelihood that a lawyer has 
committed a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct shall take appropriate action.

22

COMMENT

[1] Taking action to address known misconduct is a judge’s obligation.  Paragraphs (A) and (B) 
impose an obligation on the  judge to report to the appropriate disciplinary authority the known 
misconduct of another judge or a lawyer that raises a substantial question regarding the honesty, 
trustworthiness,  or  fitness  of  that  judge  or  lawyer. 
Ignoring  or  denying  known  misconduct 
among  one’s  judicial  colleagues  or  members  of  the  legal  profession  undermines  a  judge’s 
responsibility to participate in efforts to ensure public respect for the justice system.  This Rule 
limits  the  reporting  obligation  to  those  offenses  that  an  independent  judiciary  must  vigorously 
endeavor to prevent.

[2]  A  judge  who  does  not  have  actual  knowledge  that  another  judge  or  a  lawyer  may  have 
committed  misconduct,  but  receives  information  indicating  a  substantial  likelihood  of  such 
misconduct,  is  required  to take  appropriate  action  under  paragraphs  (C)  and  (D).   Appropriate 
action may include, but is not limited to, communicating directly with the judge who may have 
violated this Code, communicating with a supervising judge, or reporting the suspected violation 
to the appropriate authority or other agency or body.  Similarly, actions to be taken in response to 
information  indicating  that  a  lawyer  has  committed  a  violation  of  the  Rules  of  Professional
Conduct may include, but are not limited to, communicating directly with the lawyer who may 
have committed the violation, or reporting the suspected violation to the appropriate authority or 
other agency or body.

RULE 2.17
Cooperation with Disciplinary Authorities

(A) A judge shall cooperate and be candid and honest with judicial and lawyer disciplinary 
agencies.

(B) A judge shall not retaliate, directly or indirectly, against a person known* or suspected 
to have assisted or cooperated with an investigation of a judge or a lawyer.

COMMENT

[1] Cooperation with  investigations and proceedings of  judicial and  lawyer discipline agencies, 
as  required  in  paragraph  (A),  instills  confidence  in  judges’  commitment  to the  integrity  of  the 
judicial system and the protection of the public.

23

CANON 3

A  JUDGE  SHALL  CONDUCT  THE  JUDGE’S  PERSONAL  AND  EXTRAJUDICIAL 
ACTIVITIES  TO  MINIMIZE  THE  RISK  OF  CONFLICT  WITH  THE  OBLIGATIONS 
OF JUDICIAL OFFICE.

RULE 3.1
Extrajudicial Activities in General

A judge may engage in extrajudicial activities, except as prohibited by law* or this Code. 
However, when engaging in extrajudicial activities, a judge shall not:

(A) participate in activities that will interfere  with the proper performance of the judge’s 
judicial duties;

(B) participate in activities that will lead to frequent disqualification of the judge;

(C)  participate  in  activities  that  would  appear  to  a  reasonable  person  to  undermine  the 
judge’s independence,* integrity,* or impartiality;*

(D) engage in conduct that would appear to a reasonable person to be coercive; or

(E) make use of court premises, staff, stationery, equipment, or other resources, except for 
incidental use for activities that concern the law, the legal system, or the administration of 
justice, or unless such additional use is permitted by law.

COMMENT

[1]  To  the  extent  that  time  permits,  and  judicial  independence  and  impartiality  are  not 
compromised, judges are encouraged to engage in appropriate extrajudicial activities.  Judges are 
uniquely qualified to engage in extrajudicial activities that concern the law, the legal system, and 
the administration of justice, such as by speaking, writing, teaching, or participating in scholarly 
research  projects.  In  addition,  judges  are  permitted  and  encouraged  to  engage  in  educational, 
religious,  charitable,  fraternal,  or  civic  extrajudicial  activities  not  conducted  for  profit,  even 
when the activities do not involve the law.  See Rule 3.7.

[2] Participation in both law-related and other extrajudicial activities helps integrate judges into 
their  communities,  and  furthers  public  understanding  of  and  respect  for  courts  and  the  judicial 
system.

[3]  Discriminatory  actions  and  expressions  of  bias  or  prejudice  by  a  judge,  even  outside  the 
judge’s  official  or  judicial  actions,  are  likely  to  appear  to  a  reasonable  person  to  call  into 
question  the  judge’s  integrity  and  impartiality.  Examples  include  jokes  or  other  remarks  that 
demean  individuals  based  upon  their  race,  sex,  gender,  religion,  national  origin,  ethnicity, 
disability,  age,  sexual  orientation,  or  socioeconomic  status.  For  the  same  reason,  a  judge’s 

24

extrajudicial  activities  must  not  be  conducted  in  connection  or  affiliation  with  an  organization 
that practices invidious discrimination.  See Rule 3.6.

[4]  While  engaged  in  permitted  extrajudicial  activities,  judges  must  not  coerce  others  or  take 
action  that  would  reasonably  be  perceived  as  coercive.  For  example,  depending  upon  the 
circumstances, a  judge’s solicitation of contributions or memberships  for an organization, even 
as permitted by Rule 3.7(A), might create the risk that the person solicited would feel obligated 
to respond favorably, or would do so to curry favor with the judge.

RULE 3.2
Appearances before Governmental Bodies and Consultation with Government Officials

A judge shall not appear voluntarily at a public hearing before, or otherwise consult with, 
an executive or a legislative body or official, except:

(A) in connection with matters concerning the law,* the legal system, or the administration 
of justice;

(B) in connection with matters about which the judge acquired knowledge* or expertise in 
the course of the judge’s judicial duties; or

(C) when the judge is self-representing in a matter involving the judge’s legal or economic 
interests,* or when the judge is acting in a fiduciary* capacity.

COMMENT

[1] Judges possess special expertise in matters of law, the legal system, and the administration of 
justice,  and  may  properly  share  that  expertise  with  governmental  bodies  and  executive  or 
legislative branch officials.

[2]  In  appearing  before  governmental  bodies  or  consulting  with  government  officials,  judges 
must  be  mindful  that  they  remain  subject  to  other  provisions  of  this  Code,  such  as  Rule  1.3, 
prohibiting  judges  from  using  the  prestige  of  office  to  advance  their  own  or  others’  interests, 
Rule  2.11,  governing  public  comment  on  pending  and  impending  matters,  and  Rule  3.1(C), 
prohibiting  judges  from  engaging  in  extrajudicial  activities  that  would  appear  to  a  reasonable 
person to undermine the judge’s independence, integrity, or impartiality.

[3] In general, it would be an unnecessary and unfair burden to prohibit judges from appearing 
before governmental bodies or consulting with government officials on matters that are likely to 
In 
affect  them  as  private  citizens,  such  as  zoning  proposals  affecting  their  real  property. 
engaging in such activities, however, judges must not refer to their judicial positions, and must 
otherwise exercise caution to avoid using the prestige of judicial office.

25

RULE 3.3
Testifying as a Character Witness

A  judge  shall  not  testify  as  a  character  witness  in  a  judicial,  administrative,  or  other 
adjudicatory  proceeding  or  otherwise  vouch  for  the  character  of  a  person  in  a  legal 
proceeding, except when duly summoned.

COMMENT

[1] A judge who, without being subpoenaed, testifies as a character witness abuses the prestige 
of  judicial  office  to  advance  the  interests  of  another.  See  Rule  1.3.  Except  in  unusual 
circumstances  where  the  demands  of  justice  require,  a  judge  should  discourage  a  party  from 
requiring the judge to testify as a character witness.

RULE 3.4
Appointments to Governmental Positions

A judge shall not accept appointment to a governmental committee, board, commission, or 
other governmental position, unless it is one that concerns the law,* the legal system, or the 
administration of justice.

COMMENT

[1] Rule 3.4 implicitly acknowledges the value of judges accepting appointments to entities that 
concern  the  law,  the  legal  system,  or  the  administration  of  justice.  Even  in  such  instances, 
however,  a  judge  should  assess  the  appropriateness  of  accepting  an  appointment,  paying 
particular attention to the subject matter of the appointment and the availability and allocation of 
judicial  resources,  including  the  judge’s  time  commitments,  and  giving  due  regard  to  the 
requirements of the independence and impartiality of the judiciary.

[2]  A  judge  may  represent  his  or  her  country,  state,  or  locality  on  ceremonial  occasions  or  in 
connection  with  historical,  educational,  or  cultural  activities.  Such  representation  does  not 
constitute acceptance of a government position.

RULE 3.5
Use of Nonpublic Information

COMMENT

A judge shall not intentionally disclose or use nonpublic information* known* or acquired 
in  a  judicial  capacity  for  any  purpose  in  contravention  of  or  unrelated  to  the  judge’s 
judicial duties.

[1] A judge is, by definition, uniquely privy to the inclination of the court to resolve a matter or 
issue  pending  before  it  in  a  particular  manner.    A  judge  shall  not,  under  any  circumstances, 

26

disclose such information to a third party in advance of the court’s release of its decision.  With 
respect to the parties in the case, a judge shall not disclose such information to a party or counsel 
unless the court simultaneously shares such information openly with all parties to the proceeding.

[2] In the course of performing judicial duties, a judge may acquire information of commercial or 
other value that is unavailable to the public.  The judge must not reveal or use such information 
for personal gain or for any purpose unrelated to his or her judicial duties.

[3]  This  rule  is  not  intended,  however,  to  affect  a  judge’s  ability  to  act  on  information  as 
necessary  to  protect  the  health  or  safety  of  the  judge  or  a  member  of  a  judge’s  family,  court 
personnel, or other judicial officers if consistent with other provisions of this Code.

RULE 3.6
Affiliation with Discriminatory Organizations

(A)  A  judge  shall  not  hold  membership  in  any  organization  that  practices  invidious 
discrimination  on  the  basis  of  race,  sex,  gender,  religion,  national origin,  ethnicity,  or 
sexual orientation.

(B) A judge shall not use the benefits or facilities of an organization if the judge knows* or 
should know that the organization practices invidious discrimination on one or more of the 
bases  identified  in  paragraph  (A).  A  judge’s  attendance  at  an  event  in  a  facility  of  an 
organization that the judge is not permitted to join is not a violation of this Rule when the 
judge’s  attendance  is  an  isolated  event  that  could  not  reasonably  be  perceived  as  an 
endorsement of the organization’s practices.

(C) A judge’s membership in a religious organization as a lawful exercise of the freedom of 
religion is not a violation of this Rule.  This Rule does not apply to national or state military 
service.

COMMENT

[1] A judge’s public manifestation of approval of invidious discrimination on any basis gives rise 
to  the  appearance  of  impropriety  and  diminishes  public  confidence  in  the  integrity  and 
impartiality of the  judiciary.  A  judge’s  membership  in  an organization that practices  invidious 
discrimination creates the perception that the judge’s impartiality is impaired.

[2]  An  organization  is  generally  said  to  discriminate  invidiously  if  it  arbitrarily  excludes  from 
membership  on  the  basis  of  race,  sex,  gender,  religion,  national  origin,  ethnicity,  or  sexual 
orientation  persons  who  would  otherwise  be  eligible  for  admission.  Whether  an  organization 
practices  invidious  discrimination  is  a  complex  question  to  which  judges  should  be  attentive. 
The  answer  cannot  be  determined  from  a  mere  examination  of  an  organization’s  current 
membership  rolls,  but  rather,  depends  upon  how  the  organization  selects  members,  as  well  as 
other  relevant  factors,  such  as  whether  the  organization  is  dedicated  to  the  preservation  of 
religious, ethnic, or cultural values of legitimate common interest to its members, or whether it is 

27

an intimate, purely private organization whose membership limitations could not constitutionally 
be prohibited.

[3]  When  a  judge  learns  that  an  organization  to which  the  judge  belongs  engages in  invidious 
discrimination, the judge must resign immediately from the organization.

RULE 3.7
Participation  in  Educational,  Religious,  Charitable,  Fraternal,  or  Civic  Organizations  and 
Activities

(A)  Subject  to  the  requirements  of  Rule  3.1,  a  judge  may  participate  in  activities 
sponsored  by  organizations  or  governmental  entities  concerned  with  the  law,*  the 
legal system, or the administration of justice, and those sponsored by or on behalf of 
educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, or civic organizations not conducted for 
profit, including but not limited to the following activities:

(1)  assisting  such  an  organization  or  entity  in  planning  related  to  fund-
raising,  and  participating  in  the  management  and  investment  of  the 
organization’s or entity’s funds;

(2)  soliciting*  contributions*  for  such  an  organization  or  entity,  but  only 
from members of the judge’s family,* or  from judges over whom the judge 
does not exercise supervisory or appellate authority;

(3)  appearing  or  speaking  at,  receiving  an  award  or  other  recognition  at, 
being featured on the program of, and permitting his or her title to be used in 
connection with a non-fund-raising event of such an organization or entity;

(4)  serving  as  an  officer,  director,  trustee,  or  nonlegal  advisor  of  such  an 
organization or entity, unless it is likely that the organization or entity:

(a) will be engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come before 
the judge; or

(b) will frequently be engaged in adversary proceedings in the court of 
which the judge is a member, or in any court subject to the appellate 
jurisdiction of the court of which the judge is a member.

(5) soliciting membership for such an organization or entity, even though the 
membership dues or fees generated may be used to support the objectives of 
the organization or entity, but only if the organization or entity is concerned 
with the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice;

(6)  making  recommendations  to  such  a  public  or  private  fund-granting 
organization or entity in connection with its programs and activities, but only 

28

if the organization or entity is concerned with the law, the legal system, or the 
administration of justice; and

(7)  appearing  or  speaking  at,  receiving  an  award  or  other  recognition  at, 
being featured on the program of, and permitting her or his title to be used in 
connection with a fund-raising event of an organization which concerns the 
law, the legal system, or the administration of justice.

(B) A judge may encourage lawyers to provide pro bono publico legal services.

COMMENT

[1] The activities permitted by paragraph (A) generally include those sponsored by or undertaken 
on  behalf  of  public  or  private  not-for-profit  educational  institutions,  and  other  not-for-profit 
organizations, including law-related, charitable, and other organizations.  The activities permitted 
by paragraph (A) do not include those sponsored by or on behalf of organizations which have as 
a primary purpose advocating  in political processes  for or against change  in the  laws related to 
limited subject areas.  Activities relating to such political advocacy organizations are subject to 
the requirements of Rule 3.1, as well as Canon 4 and the Rules thereunder.

[2]  Even  for  law-related  organizations,  a  judge  should  consider  whether the  membership  and 
purposes of the organization, or the nature of the judge’s participation in or association with the 
organization,  would  conflict  with  the  judge’s  obligation  to  refrain  from  activities  that  reflect 
adversely upon a judge’s independence, integrity, and impartiality.

[3] Mere attendance at an event, whether or not the event serves a fund-raising purpose, does not 
constitute a violation of paragraph (A).  It is also generally permissible for a judge to serve as an 
usher  or  a  food  server  or  preparer,  or  to  perform  similar  functions,  at  fund-raising  events 
sponsored by educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, or civic organizations.  Such activities 
are  not  solicitation  and  do  not  present  an  element of  coercion  or  abuse  the  prestige  of  judicial 
office.

[4]  Identification  of  a  judge’s  position  in  educational,  religious,  charitable,  fraternal,  or  civic 
organizations on letterhead used for fund-raising or membership solicitation does not violate this 
Rule if comparable designations are used for other persons.

[5] In addition to appointing lawyers to serve as counsel for indigent parties in individual cases, a 
judge may promote broader access to justice by encouraging lawyers to participate in pro bono 
publico legal services, if in doing so the judge does not employ coercion, or abuse the prestige of 
judicial office.

[6] Subject to the requirements of Rule 3.1 and paragraph (A), a judge may provide leadership in 
improving equal access to the justice system; developing public education programs; engaging in 
outreach activities to promote the fair administration of justice; and convening and participating 
in  advisory  committees  and  community  collaborations  devoted to the  improvement  of  the  law, 
the legal system, the provision of legal services, and/or the administration of justice.

RULE 3.8
Appointments to Fiduciary Positions

(A) A judge shall not accept appointment to serve in a fiduciary* position, such as executor, 
administrator, trustee, guardian, attorney in fact, or other personal representative, except 
for  the  estate,  trust,  or  person  of  a  member  of  the  judge’s  family,*  and  then  only  if  such 
service will not interfere with the proper performance of judicial duties.

(B)  A  judge  shall  not  serve  in  a  fiduciary  position  if  the  judge  as  fiduciary  will  likely  be 
engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come before the judge, or if the estate, trust, 
or ward becomes involved in adversary proceedings in the court on which the judge serves, 
or one under its appellate jurisdiction.

(C)  A  judge  acting  in  a  fiduciary  capacity  shall  be  subject  to  the  same  restrictions  on 
engaging in financial activities that apply to a judge personally.

(D)  If  a  person  who  is  serving  in  a  fiduciary  position  becomes  a  judge,  he  or  she  must 
comply with this Rule as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than one year 
after becoming a judge.

COMMENT

[1]  A  judge  should  recognize  that  other  restrictions  imposed  by  this  Code  may  conflict  with  a 
judge’s obligations as a fiduciary; in such circumstances, a judge should resign as fiduciary.  For 
example,  serving  as  a  fiduciary  might  require  frequent  disqualification  of  a  judge  under  Rule 
2.12 because a judge is deemed to have an economic interest in shares of stock held by a trust if 
the  amount  of  stock  held  is  more  than  de  minimis.    This  Rule  does  not  prohibit  a  judge  from 
assuming guardianship of a minor child, as authorized by law.

RULE 3.9
Service as Arbitrator or Mediator

COMMENT

A  judge  shall  not  act  as  an  arbitrator  or  a  mediator  or  perform  other  judicial  functions 
apart from the judge’s official duties unless expressly authorized by law.*

[1] A “judge’s official duties” may include acting as a mediator in a case pending before another 
judge.

30

RULE 3.10
Practice of Law

(A) A judge authorized by  law to engage in the practice of  law* must  scrupulously avoid 
conduct in the practice of law which may create a conflict with judicial duties or create the 
appearance  of  impropriety.*    If  a  conflict  arises  between  the  judge’s  obligations  as  judge 
and  the  private  practice  of  law,  the  judge  shall  resolve  the  conflict  in  such  a  way  that 
accomplishes the fulfillment of judicial duties.  

(B)  A  judge  may  self-represent  and  may,  without  compensation,  give  legal  advice  to  and 
draft  or  review  documents  for  a  member  of  the  judge’s  family,*  but  is  prohibited from 
serving as the family member’s lawyer in any forum.

COMMENT

[1]  A  judge  may  self-represent  in  all  legal  matters,  including  matters  involving  litigation  and 
matters involving appearances before or other dealings with governmental bodies.  A judge must 
not use the prestige of office to advance the judge’s personal or family interests.  See Rule 1.3.

RULE 3.11
Financial, Business, or Remunerative Activities

(A)  A  judge  may  hold  and  manage  investments  of  the  judge  and  members  of  the  judge’s 
family.*

(B)  A  judge  shall  not  serve  as  an  officer,  director,  manager,  general  partner,  advisor,  or 
employee of any business entity except that a judge may manage or participate in:

(1) a business closely held by the judge or members of the judge’s family; or

(2)  a  business  entity  primarily  engaged  in  investment  of  the  financial  resources  of 
the judge or members of the judge’s family.

(C) A judge shall not engage in financial activities permitted under paragraphs (A) and (B) 
if they will:

(1) interfere with the proper performance of judicial duties;

(2) lead to frequent disqualification of the judge;

(3)  involve  the  judge  in  frequent  transactions  or  continuing  business  relationships 
with  lawyers  or  other  persons  likely  to  come  before  the  court  on  which  the  judge 
serves; or

(4) result in violation of other provisions of this Code.

31

COMMENT

[1]  Judges  are  generally  permitted  to  engage  in  financial  activities,  including  managing  real 
estate  and  other  investments  for  themselves  or  for  members  of  their  families.  Participation  in 
these activities, like participation in other extrajudicial activities, is subject to the requirements of 
this Code.  For example,  it would  be  improper for a  judge to spend so  much time on  business 
activities  that  it  interferes  with  the  performance  of  judicial  duties.  See  Rule  2.1.   Similarly,  it 
would  be  improper  for  a  judge  to  use  his  or  her  official  title  or  appear  in  judicial  robes  in 
business  advertising,  or  to  conduct  his  or  her  business  or  financial  affairs  in  such  a  way  that 
disqualification is frequently required.  See Rules 1.3 and 2.12.

[2] As soon as practicable without serious financial detriment, the judge must divest himself or 
herself of investments and other financial interests that might require frequent disqualification or 
otherwise violate this Rule.

RULE 3.12
Compensation for Extrajudicial Activities

A judge may accept reasonable compensation for extrajudicial activities permitted by this 
Code  or  other  law*  unless  such  acceptance  would  appear  to  a  reasonable  person  to 
undermine the judge’s independence,* integrity,* or impartiality.*

RULE 3.13
Acceptance and Reporting of Gifts, Loans, Bequests, Benefits, or Other Things of Value

(A) A judge shall not accept any gifts, loans, bequests, benefits, or other things of value, if 
acceptance is prohibited by law* or would appear to a reasonable person to undermine the 
judge’s independence,* integrity,* or impartiality.*

(B)  Unless  otherwise  prohibited  by  law,  or  by  paragraph  (A),  a  judge  may  accept  the 
following:

(1)  items  with  little  intrinsic  value,  such  as  plaques,  certificates,  trophies,  and 
greeting cards;

(2) gifts, loans, bequests, benefits, or other things of value from friends, relatives, or 
other  persons,  including  lawyers,  whose  appearance  or  interest  in  a  proceeding 
in  any  event  require 
pending*  or 
disqualification of the judge under Rule 2.12;

impending*  before 

judge  would 

the 

(3) ordinary social hospitality;

32

(4) commercial or financial opportunities and benefits, including special pricing and 
discounts, and loans from lending institutions in their regular course of business, if 
the same opportunities and benefits or loans are made available on the same terms 
to similarly situated persons who are not judges;

(5)  rewards  and  prizes  given  to  competitors  or  participants  in  random  drawings, 
contests, or other events that are open to persons who are not judges;

(6) scholarships, fellowships, and similar benefits or awards:

(a) related to training in the law, the legal system or the administration of 
justice; or

(b) available to similarly situated persons who are not judges, based on the 
same terms and criteria;

(7) books, magazines, journals, audiovisual materials, and other resource materials 
supplied by publishers on a complimentary basis for official use;

(8)  gifts,  awards,  or  benefits  associated  with  the  business,  profession,  or  other 
separate  activity  of  a  spouse,  a  domestic  partner,*  or  other  family  member  of  a 
judge residing in the judge’s household,* but that incidentally benefit the judge;

(9) gifts incident to a public testimonial; and

(10)  invitations  to  the  judge  and  the  judge’s  spouse,  domestic  partner,  or  guest  to 
attend without charge:

(a) an event associated with a bar-related function or other activity relating 
to the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice; or

(b)  an  event  associated  with  any  of  the  judge’s  educational,  religious, 
charitable,  fraternal,  or  civic  activities  permitted  by  this  Code,  if  the  same 
invitation  is  offered  to  nonjudges  who  are  engaged  in  similar  ways  in  the 
activity as is the judge.

COMMENT

[1]  Whenever  a  judge  accepts  a  gift  or  other  thing  of  value  without  paying  fair  market  value, 
there is a risk that the benefit might be viewed as intended to influence the judge’s decision in a 
case.  Gift-giving between friends and relatives is a common occurrence, and ordinarily does not 
create  an  appearance  of  impropriety  or  cause  reasonable  persons  to  believe  that  the  judge’s 
independence,  integrity,  or  impartiality  has  been  compromised.
  In  addition,  when  the 
appearance of friends or relatives in a case would require the judge’s disqualification under Rule 
2.12, there would be no opportunity for a gift to influence the judge’s decision making.

33

[2] Businesses and financial institutions frequently make available special pricing, discounts, and 
other benefits, either in connection with a temporary promotion or for preferred customers, based 
upon  longevity  of  the  relationship,  volume  of  business  transacted,  and  other  factors.  A  judge 
may  freely  accept  such  benefits  if  they  are  available  to  the  general  public,  or  if  the  judge 
qualifies for the special price or discount according to the same criteria as are applied to persons 
who are not judges.  As an example, loans provided at generally prevailing interest rates are not 
gifts,  but  a  judge  could  not  accept  a  loan  from  a  financial  institution  at  below-market  interest 
rates unless the same rate was being made available to the general public for a certain period of 
time or only to borrowers with specified qualifications that the judge also possesses.

[3]  Rule  3.13  applies  only  to  acceptance  of  gifts  or  other  things  of  value  by  a  judge.
Nonetheless, if a gift or other benefit is given to the judge’s spouse, domestic partner, or member 
of the judge’s family residing in the judge’s household, it may be viewed as an attempt to evade 
Rule 3.13 and influence the judge indirectly.  Where the gift or benefit is being made primarily 
to such other persons, and the judge is merely an incidental beneficiary, this concern is reduced.  
A  judge  should,  however,  remind  family  and  household  members  of  the  restrictions  imposed 
upon judges, and urge them to take these restrictions into account when making decisions about 
accepting such gifts or benefits.

[4]  Rule  3.13  does  not  apply  to  contributions  to  a  judge’s  campaign  for  judicial  office.   Such 
contributions are governed by other Rules of this Code.

RULE 3.14
Reimbursement of Expenses and Waivers of Fees or Charges

(A) Unless otherwise prohibited by Rules 3.1 and 3.13(A) or other law,* a judge may accept 
reimbursement  of  necessary  and  reasonable  expenses  for  travel,  food,  lodging,  or  other 
incidental  expenses,  or  a  waiver  or  partial  waiver  of  fees  or  charges  for  registration, 
tuition,  and  similar  items,  from  sources  other  than  the  judge’s  employing  entity,  if  the 
expenses or charges are associated with the judge’s participation in extrajudicial activities 
permitted by this Code.

(B)  Reimbursement  of  expenses  for  necessary  travel,  food,  lodging,  or  other  incidental 
expenses  shall  be  limited  to  the  actual  costs  reasonably  incurred  by  the  judge  and,  when 
appropriate to the occasion, by the judge’s spouse, domestic partner,* or guest.

COMMENT

[1] Educational, civic, religious,  fraternal, and  charitable organizations often  sponsor  meetings, 
seminars, symposia, dinners, awards ceremonies, and similar events.  Judges are encouraged to 
attend  educational  programs,  as  both  teachers  and  participants,  in  law-related  and  academic 
disciplines, in furtherance of their duty to remain competent in the law.  Participation in a variety 
of other extrajudicial activity is also permitted and encouraged by this Code.

34

[2] Not infrequently, sponsoring organizations  invite certain  judges to attend seminars or other 
events  on  a  fee-waived  or  partial-fee-waived  basis,  and  sometimes  include  reimbursement  for 
necessary  travel,  food,  lodging,  or  other  incidental  expenses.  A  judge’s  decision  whether to 
accept reimbursement of expenses or a waiver or partial waiver of fees or charges in connection 
with  these  or  other  extrajudicial  activities  must  be  based  upon  an  assessment  of  all  the 
circumstances.  The  judge  must  undertake  a  reasonable  inquiry  to  obtain  the  information 
necessary to make an informed judgment about whether acceptance would be consistent with the 
requirements of this Code.

[3]  A  judge  must  assure  himself  or  herself  that  acceptance  of  reimbursement  or  fee  waivers 
would  not  appear  to  a  reasonable  person  to  undermine  the  judge’s  independence,  integrity,  or 
impartiality.  The  factors that  a  judge  should  consider  when  deciding  whether to  accept 
reimbursement or a fee waiver for attendance at a particular activity include: 

(a) whether the sponsor  is an  accredited educational  institution or bar association rather 
than a trade association or a for-profit entity; 
(b)  whether the  funding  comes  largely  from  numerous  contributors  rather  than  from  a 
single entity and is earmarked for programs with specific content; 
(c) whether the content is related or unrelated to the subject matter of litigation pending 
or impending before the judge, or to matters that are likely to come before the judge; 
(d) whether the activity is primarily educational rather than recreational, and whether the 
costs of the event are reasonable and comparable to those associated with similar events 
sponsored by the judiciary, bar associations, or similar groups; 
(e) whether information concerning the activity and its funding sources is available upon 
inquiry; 
(f) whether the sponsor or source of funding is generally associated with particular parties 
or  interests  currently  appearing  or  likely  to  appear  in  the  judge’s  court,  thus  possibly 
requiring disqualification of the judge under Rule 2.12; 
(g) whether differing viewpoints are presented; and 
(h) whether a broad range of  judicial and  nonjudicial participants are invited, whether a 
large number of participants are invited, and whether the program is designed specifically 
for judges.

CANON 4

A  JUDGE  OR  CANDIDATE  FOR  JUDICIAL  OFFICE  SHALL  NOT  ENGAGE  IN 
POLITICAL  OR  CAMPAIGN  ACTIVITY THAT  IS  INCONSISTENT  WITH  THE 
INDEPENDENCE, INTEGRITY, OR IMPARTIALITY OF THE JUDICIARY. 

RULE 4.1
Political and Campaign Activities of Judges and Judicial Candidates in General

(A)  Except  as  permitted  by  law,*  or  by  Rules  4.2,  4.3,  and  4.4,  a  judge  or  a  judicial 
candidate* shall not:

(1) act as a leader in, or hold an office in, a political organization;* 
(2)  make  speeches  on  behalf  of  a  political  organization,  or  any  partisan*  or 
independent* non-judicial office-holder or candidate for public office;
(3)  publicly  endorse  or  oppose  a  partisan  or  independent  candidate  for  any  non-
judicial public office;
(4)  solicit  funds  for,  pay  an  assessment  to,  or  make  a  contribution*  to  a  political 
organization,  or  to  or  on  behalf  of  any  partisan  or  independent  office-holder  or 
candidate for public office;
(5) attend or purchase tickets for dinners or other events sponsored by a partisan or 
independent candidate for non-judicial public office;

(7)  seek,  accept,  or  use  endorsements  from  a  political  organization,  or  partisan  or 
independent non-judicial office-holder or candidate;
(8)  use  or  permit  the  use  of  campaign  contributions  for  the  private  benefit  of  the 
judge, the candidate, or others;
(9)  use  court  staff,  facilities,  or  other  court  resources  in  a  campaign  for  judicial 
office;
(10)  knowingly,*  or  with  reckless  disregard  for  the  truth,  make  any  false  or 
misleading statement;
(11) make any statement that would reasonably be expected to affect the outcome or 
impair the fairness of a matter pending* or impending* in any court; or
(12) in connection with cases, controversies, or issues that are likely to come before 
the  court,  make  pledges,  promises,  or  commitments  that  are  inconsistent  with  the 
impartial* performance of the adjudicative duties of judicial office. 

(B)  A  judge  or  judicial  candidate  shall  take  reasonable  measures  to  ensure  that  other 
persons  do  not  undertake,  on  behalf  of  the  judge  or  judicial  candidate,  any  activities 
prohibited under paragraph (A).

36

COMMENT

General Considerations

[1] Even when subject to public election, a judge plays a role different from that of a legislator or 
executive  branch  official.  Rather  than  making  decisions  based  upon  the  expressed  views  or 
preferences of the electorate, a judge makes decisions based upon the law and the facts of every 
case.  Therefore,  in  furtherance  of  this  interest,  judges  and  judicial  candidates  must,  to  the 
greatest  extent  possible,  be  free  and  appear  to  be  free  from  political  influence  and  political 
pressure.  This  Canon  imposes  narrowly  tailored  restrictions  upon  the  political  and  campaign 
activities  of  all  judges  and  judicial  candidates,  taking  into  account  the  various  methods  of 
selecting judges.

[2]  When  a  person  becomes  a  judicial  candidate,  this  Canon  becomes  applicable  to  his  or  her 
conduct.  If a judicial candidate who is not a judge violates this Canon and is elected, he or she 
may be referred to the Judicial Standards Commission for discipline on assuming office.

Participation in Political Activities

[3] Public confidence in the independence and impartiality of the judiciary is eroded if judges or 
judicial  candidates  are  perceived  to  be  subject  to  political  influence.    Judges  and  judicial 
candidates  are  prohibited  by  paragraph  (A)(1)  from  assuming  leadership  roles  in  political 
organizations.

[4] Paragraphs (A)(2) and (A)(3) prohibit judges and judicial candidates from making speeches 
on  behalf  of  political  organizations  or  publicly  endorsing  or  opposing  partisan  candidates  for 
public  office,  respectively,  to  prevent  them  from  abusing  the  prestige  of  judicial  office  to 
advance  the  interests  of  others.  See  Rule  1.3.  These  Rules  do  not  prohibit  candidates  from 
campaigning on their own behalf, or from endorsing or opposing candidates for a judicial office, 
because  judges  are  in  the  unique  position  to  know  and  share  with  interested  persons  the 
qualifications of judicial candidates.  See Rule 4.2(B)(2) and (3).  However, note that while it is 
acceptable for candidates for judicial office to seek and accept endorsements from another judge, 
and  have  the  supportive  judge  attend  the  candidate’s  dinners,  judges  are  prohibited  from 
soliciting or collecting money on their behalf.

[5] Although members of the families of judges and judicial candidates are free to engage in their 
own political activity, including running for public office, there is no “family exception” to the 
prohibition  in  paragraph  (A)(3)  against  a  judge  or  candidate  publicly  endorsing  candidates  for 
public office.  A judge or judicial candidate must not become involved in, or publicly associated 
with,  a  family  member’s  political  activity  or  campaign  for  public  office.  To  avoid  public 
misunderstanding, judges and judicial candidates should take, and should urge members of their 
families  to  take,  reasonable  steps  to  avoid  any  implication  that  they  endorse  any  family 
member’s candidacy or other political activity.

37

[6] Judges and judicial candidates retain the right to participate in the political process as voters 
in both primary and general elections.

Statements and Comments Made During a Campaign for Judicial Office

[7]  Judicial  candidates  must  be  scrupulously  fair  and  accurate  in  all  statements  made  by  them 
and by their campaign committees.  Paragraph (A)(10) obligates candidates and their committees 
to  refrain  from  making  statements  that  are  false  or  misleading,  or  that  omit  facts  necessary  to 
make the communication considered as a whole not materially misleading.

[8] Judicial candidates are sometimes the subject of false, misleading, or unfair allegations made 
by opposing candidates, third parties, or the media.  For example, false or misleading statements 
might  be  made  regarding  the  identity,  present  position,  experience,  qualifications,  or  judicial 
rulings of a candidate.  In other situations, false or misleading allegations may be made that bear 
upon  a  candidate’s  integrity  or  fitness  for  judicial  office.  As  long  as  the  candidate  does  not 
violate  paragraphs  (A)(10),  (A)(11),  or  (A)(12),  the  candidate  may  make  a  factually  accurate 
public  response. 
In  addition,  when  an  independent  third  party  has  made  false  attacks  on  a 
candidate’s  opponent,  the  candidate  should  disavow  the  attacks,  and  request  the  third  party  to 
cease and desist.

[9]  Subject  to  paragraph  (A)(11),  a  judicial  candidate  is  permitted  to  respond  directly  to  false, 
misleading,  or  unfair  allegations  made  against  him  or  her  during  a  campaign,  although  it  is 
preferable for someone else to respond if the allegations relate to a pending case.

[10]  Paragraph  (A)(11)  prohibits  judicial  candidates  from  making  comments  that  might  impair 
the  fairness  of  pending  or  impending  judicial  proceedings.  This  provision  does  not  restrict 
arguments or statements to the court or jury by a lawyer who is a judicial candidate, or rulings, 
statements, or instructions by a judge that may appropriately affect the outcome of a matter.

Pledges,  Promises,  or  Commitments  Inconsistent  With  Impartial  Performance  of 
Adjudicative Duties of Judicial Office

the 

[11] The role of a  judge  is different from that of a  legislator or executive  branch official, even 
when the  judge  is  subject to public election.  Campaigns  for  judicial office  must be conducted 
differently  from  campaigns  for  other  offices.  The  narrowly  drafted  restrictions  upon  political 
and campaign activities of judicial candidates provided in Canon 4 allow candidates to conduct 
campaigns that provide voters with sufficient information to permit them to distinguish between 
candidates and make informed electoral choices.

[12] Paragraph (A)(12) makes applicable to both judges and  judicial  candidates the prohibition 
that  applies  to  judges  in  Rule  2.11(B),  relating  to  pledges,  promises,  or  commitments  that  are 
inconsistent with the impartial performance of the adjudicative duties of judicial office.

[13] The making of a pledge, promise, or commitment is not dependent upon, or limited to, the 
use of any specific words or phrases; instead, the totality of the statement must be examined to 
determine  if  a  reasonable  person  would  believe  that  the  candidate  for  judicial  office  has 

38

specifically undertaken to reach a particular result.  Pledges, promises, or commitments must be 
contrasted  with  statements  or  announcements  of  personal  views  on  legal,  political,  or  other 
issues, which are not prohibited.  When making such statements, a judge should acknowledge the 
overarching judicial obligation to apply and uphold the law, without regard to his or her personal 
views.

[14]  A  judicial  candidate  may  make  campaign  promises  related  to  judicial  organization, 
administration, and court management, such as a promise to dispose of a backlog of cases, start 
court  sessions  on  time,  or  avoid  favoritism  in  appointments  and  hiring.  A  candidate  may  also 
pledge to take action outside the courtroom, such as working toward an improved jury selection 
system,  or  advocating  for  more  funds  to  improve  the  physical  plant  and  amenities  of  the 
courthouse.

[15]  Judicial  candidates  may  receive  questionnaires  or  requests  for  interviews  from  the  media 
and  from  issue  advocacy  or  other  community  organizations  that  seek  to  learn  their  views  on 
disputed  or  controversial  legal  or  political  issues.  Paragraph  (A)(12)  does  not  specifically 
address  judicial  responses  to  such  inquiries.  Depending  upon  the  wording  and  format  of  such 
questionnaires, candidates’ responses might be viewed as pledges, promises, or commitments to 
perform  the  adjudicative  duties  of  office  other  than  in  an  impartial  way.  To  avoid  violating 
paragraph  (A)(12), therefore,  candidates  who  respond  to  media  and  other  inquiries  should  also 
give  assurances  that  they  will  keep  an  open  mind  and  will  carry  out  their  adjudicative  duties 
faithfully and impartially if elected.  Candidates who do not respond may state their reasons for 
not responding, such as the danger that answering might be perceived by a reasonable person as 
undermining  a  successful  candidate’s  independence  or  impartiality,  or  that  it  might  lead  to 
frequent disqualification.  See Rule 2.12.

RULE 4.2 
Political and Campaign Activities of Judicial Candidates in Public Elections

(A) A judicial candidate* shall:

(1)  act  at  all  times  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  independence,*  integrity,*  and 
impartiality* of the judiciary;

(2)  comply  with  all  applicable  election,  election  campaign,  and  election  campaign 
fund-raising laws* and regulations of this jurisdiction;

(3)  review  and  approve  the  content  of  all  campaign  statements  and  materials 
produced by the candidate or his or her campaign committee, as authorized by Rule 
4.4, before their dissemination; and

(4)  take  objectively  reasonable  measures  to  ensure  that  other  persons  do  not 
undertake on behalf of the candidate activities, other than those described in Rule 
4.4, that the candidate is prohibited from doing by Rule 4.1.

(B) A candidate for elective judicial office may, unless prohibited by law:

39

(1) establish a campaign committee pursuant to the provisions of Rule 4.4;

(2) speak on behalf of his or her candidacy through any medium, including but not 
limited to advertisements, websites, or other campaign literature;

(3) publicly support or oppose candidates for judicial office;

(4)  attend  or  purchase  tickets  for  dinners  or  other  events  sponsored  by  a  political 
organization* or a candidate for judicial office;

(5) seek, accept, or use endorsements from any person or organization other than a 
partisan  political  organization  or  partisan*  or  independent*  office-holder  or 
candidate for non-judicial public office; and

(6)  contribute  to  a  candidate  for  judicial  office,  but  not  more  than  the  amount 
prescribed by law.

COMMENT

[1] Paragraph (B) permits judicial candidates in public elections to engage in some political and 
campaign activities otherwise prohibited by Rule 4.1.

[2] Despite paragraph (B), judicial candidates for public election remain subject to many of the 
provisions of Rule 4.1.  For example, a candidate continues to be prohibited from soliciting funds
for a political organization, or any partisan or independent office-holder or candidate for public 
office,  from  knowingly  making  false  or  misleading  statements  during  a  campaign,  or  making 
certain  promises,  pledges,  or  commitments  related  to  future  adjudicative  duties.  See  Rule 
4.1(A), subparagraphs (4), (10), and (12).

[3] In judicial elections, paragraph (B)(5) prohibits a candidate from seeking, accepting, or using 
nominations or endorsements from a partisan political organization or a partisan or independent 
non-judicial office-holder or candidate for public office.

[4]  Judicial  candidates  are  permitted  to  attend  or  purchase  tickets  for  dinners  and  other  events 
sponsored  by  political  organizations  or  judicial  candidates,  but  not  by  partisan  or  other 
independent office-holders or candidates for public office.

[5] In endorsing or opposing another judicial candidate, the judge or judicial candidate doing so 
must abide by the same rules governing campaign conduct and speech as apply to the candidate’s 
own campaign.

40

RULE 4.3
Activities of Candidates for Appointive Judicial Office

A candidate for appointment to judicial office may:

(A)  communicate  with  the  appointing  or  confirming  authority,  including  any  selection, 
screening, or nominating commission or similar agency; and

(B) seek endorsements for the appointment from any person or organization other than a 
political organization.*

[1] When seeking support or endorsement, or when communicating directly with an appointing 
or  confirming  authority,  a  candidate  for  appointive  judicial  office  must  not  make  any  pledges, 
promises, or  commitments  that  are  inconsistent  with  the  impartial  performance  of  the 
adjudicative duties of the office.  See Rule 4.1(A)(12).

COMMENT

RULE 4.4
Campaign Committees

(A) A judicial candidate* subject to public election* may establish a campaign committee 
to  manage  and  conduct  a  campaign  for  the  candidate,  subject  to  the  provisions  of  this 
Code.  The  candidate  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  his  or  her  campaign  committee 
complies with applicable provisions of this Code and other applicable law.*

(B)  A  judicial  candidate  who  establishes  a  campaign  committee  shall  direct  his  or  her 
campaign committee:

(1) to solicit and accept only such campaign contributions* as are permitted by law;

(2) not to solicit or accept contributions for a candidate’s campaign in an amount or 
in a manner that is prohibited by law; and

(3)  to  comply  with  all  applicable  statutory  requirements  for  disclosure  and 
divestiture  of  campaign  contributions,  and  to  file  all  reports  required  by  law  with 
the official or agency prescribed by law.

COMMENT

[1] This Rule recognizes that judicial candidates may raise campaign funds in an amount and in a 
manner  permitted  by  law  to  support  their  candidacies,  and  permits  candidates,  other  than 
candidates  for  appointive  judicial  office,  to  solicit  financial  or  in-kind  campaign  contributions 
personally or to establish campaign committees to solicit and accept such contributions.

41

[2]  Campaign  committees  may  solicit  and  accept  campaign  contributions,  manage  the 
expenditure  of  campaign  funds,  and  generally  conduct  campaigns.  Candidates  are  responsible 
for  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  election  law  and  other  applicable  law,  and  for  the 
activities of their campaign committees.

[3] If a campaign committee is established, the candidate must instruct the campaign committee 
to solicit or accept contributions in conformity with applicable law.
