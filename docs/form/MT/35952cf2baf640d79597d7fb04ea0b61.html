Instructions 

The petition must be neatly handwritten or typed.  You  must tell  the truth 
and sign the  form.  If you make a false  statement of a material fact  you 
may be prosecuted for  perjury. 

You must attach  affidavits, records,  or other evidence establishing the 
facts to  support your claims.  You may use the  FORM AFFIDAVIT IN 
SUPPORT OF A  PETITION FOR POSTCONVICTION RELIEF or 
other records or evidence.  Attach any documents you have that would 
support your claim(s). 

You must set  forth  all  grounds for relief known to  you at  this time, along 
with the facts  that support each ground.  If you fail  to  set forth all the 
grounds in  this petition you may be  barred from  presenting additional 
grounds at a later date.  The most common grounds are (a)  ineffective 
assistance of trial counsel; (b) ineffective assistance of appellate counsel 
and (c) the  prosecutor withheld exculpatory evidence. 

4. 

5. 

6. 

7. 

8 . 

You must also  file  a written memorandum explaining the  grounds for 
relief.  You  may use  the FORM MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF 
THE PETITION FOR POSTCONVICTION RELIEF or prepare your 
own. 

You are  not entitled to appointment of counsel in postconviction 
proceedings unless you are a  poor person and  the court determines that a 
hearing is  necessary, or that the  interests of justice require appointment of 
counsel.  If, however, you are sentenced to  death you are entitled to legal 
representation and should request the appointment of counsel. 

The petition must be filed  in  the district court in the county where you 
were convicted.  When you have completed the  forms,  mail them to the 
clerk of the district court in the county where you were convicted.  Also, 
mail  a copy of the petition to each person listed on the Certificate of 
Service. 

In  this petition, you may challenge the judgment entered by only one 
court.  If you want to  challenge judgments entered by different courts 
(either in  this state or in  different states) you have to  file  separate 
petitions. 

You must  file  for postconviction relief within one year of the date  your 
conviction becomes final.  Otherwise, the court has  no  authority to 
consider it.  Use the following mles to determine when a conviction is 
final: 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

If you appealed to  the Montana Supreme Court, the conviction 
becomes final  when the time for appealing to  the U.S.  Supreme 
Court expires.  This is  90 days from  the date the Montana 
Supreme Court's opinion was issued or,  if a petition for 
rehearing was filed,  90  days from  the date rehearing was 
denied. 

If you  did not appeal to  the Montana Supreme Court, the 
conviction becomes final  when the time for  appeal expires. 
This is  60 days from  the date the written judgment is entered. 

If you appealed to  the  United States Supreme Court after an 
appeal to  the Montana Supreme Court, the conviction becomes 

final  on the date that the U.S.  Supreme Court issues its final 
order in the  case. 

9. 

The only exception to the one-year filing deadline is  where you  have 
newly discovered evidence that proves you did not commit the criminal 
conduct for which you were convicted (see paragraph 8).  In  that case, the 
petition must be filed  within one year of the date the conviction becomes 
final,  or within one year of the date when you discover the new evidence, 
whichever is  later. 

10.  You  may amend your petition only once.  If you  need to amend your 

original petition, you should do so as  soon as you learn of the additional 
grounds for relief.

MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PETITION FOR 
POSTCONVICTION RELIEF 

INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF TRIAL COUNSEL: 

Criminal defendants are entitled the assistance of counsel at trial.  This right 

exists under the Montana Constitution,  Article II,  section 24,  as well as the  Sixth 

Amendment of the United States Constitution.  The Montana Supreme Court has 

recognized that the right to counsel under the  Montana Constitution is  broader than 

the  right afforded by the United States Constitution.  State v.  Spang,  2002  MT  120, 

~22, 310 Mont.  52, ~22, 48  P.  3d 727, ~22 CIting State v.  Johnson, 221  Mont.  503, 

514-515,719 P.  2d  1248,  1255  (1986)~ see also State v.  Garcia, 2003  MT 211, ~37, 

317  Mont.  73,  ~37, 75  P.3d 313,  ~37. 

The right to  counsel means the right  to  effective assistance of counsel.  State 

v.  Rogers,  200 I  MT  165, ~7, 306 Mont.  130,  ~7, 32  P.  3d 724, ~7, citing Strickland 

v.  Washington, 466 U.S.  668,  686 (1984).  "The effective assistance of counsel is 

critical to  our adversarial system of justice~ a lack of effective counsel may 

impinge the  fundamental  fairness  of the proceeding being challenged."  State v. 

Henderson,  2004 MT 173,  ~4, 322 Mont.  69,  ~4, 93  P.  3d  1231,  ~4.  Whether 

counsel's representation is  constitutionally sound is analyzed under the two-part 

standard from  Strickland v.  Washington, supra. 

Under the  ftrst prong,  a criminal defendant is  denied effective assistance of 

counsel if:  (1) his counsel's conduct falls  short of the range reasonably demanded 

in  light of the  Sixth  Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, 

Section 24  of the  Montana Constitution.  State v.  Jefferson,  2003  MT 90,  ~43, 315 

Mont.  146, ~43, 69 P.3d 641, ~43.  Under the second prong, the defendant must 

show a  reasonable probability exists that,  but for counsel's unprofessional errors, 

the result of the  proceedings would have been different.  Rogers, ~14. "'A 

reasonable probability is  a probability  sufficient to  undermine confidence in  the 

outcome', but  it  does not require that a defendant demonstrate that he would have 

been acquitted."  Id.  (citation omitted). 

Generally,  the defendant must establish both prongs of the  Strickland 

standard to  prevail.  State v.  Jones, 278  Mont.  121,  133, 923  P.2d 560,  567  (1996). 

However, in  some cases counsel's performance is  so  deficient a presumption of 

ineffectiveness arises and proving the  second prong becomes unnecessary.  United 

States v.  Cronic, 466 U.S.  648, 660 (1984)  "[O]nly when surrounding 

circumstances justify a presumption of ineffectiveness can a Sixth Amendment 

claim be sufficient without inquiry  into counsel's actual perfonnance at trial." 

Cronic,  466  U.S.  at 661.  The Montana Supreme Court  has  recognized that an 

irreconcilable conflict between attorney and client constitutes the type of situation 

that gives rise to a presumption of prejudice.  Wilson v.  State,  1999 MT 271, ~17, 

296 Mont.  465, ~17, 989 P.2d 813, ~17 

In situations  in which a conflict of interest exists between counsel and the 

defendant, a third test applies.  In conflict of interest cases a defendant must show: 

(1) that counsel actively represented conflicting interests, and (2) that an  actual 

conflict of interest adversely affected counsel's performance.  State v.  Christenson, 

250 Mont.  351, 355, 820  P.2d 1303,  1306 (1991) (citing  Cuyler v.  Sullivan, 446 

U. S.  335, 350 (1980)).  Where an  ineffective assistance of counsel  claim is  based 

on a conflict of interest, rather than  lack of reasonable competence, prejudice is 

presumed if the defendant satisfies both prongs of the Cuyler test.  Prejudice is 

presumed "since the  harm  may not consist solely of what counsel does, but of 

'what the advocate finds  himself compelled to  refrain from  doing."  Sanders v. 

Ratelle, 21  F.3d 1446,1452 (9th Cif.  1994), quoting Holloway v.  Arkansas, 435 

U.S.  475,490,98 S.Ct.  ] 173,1181,55 L.Ed.2d 426 (1978). 

Petitioner asserts that counsel was ineffective.  The facts  in  support of this 

claim are set forth  in  the  Petition for Postconviction Relief and  supporting 

affidavit. 

INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF APPELLATE COUNSEL. 

In Montana, the  right to counsel on appeal includes the right to effective 

assistance of counsel."  Hans v.  State 283  Mont.  379,408, 942 P.2d 674,  692 

(l997)(citing Anders v.  California, 386 U.S.  738, (1967).  Failure to preserve a 

defendant's right to  appeal when the  defendant has requested notice be filed  is 

error.  State v.  Rogers,  2001  MT  165,~24, 306 Mont.  130,  ~24, 32  P.3d 724,  ~24 

(citing Roe v.  Flores-Ortega, 528  U.S.  470,477 (2000)).  Moreover, when,  but for 

counsel's deficient performance, a defendant would have appealed,  such error is 

prejudicial. Rogers, ~24 (citing Roe,  528  U.S.  at  484). 

The remedy for the  abandonment of an appeal by counsel is  a petition for 

postconviction relief.  In  the  petition,  the  defendant  is  allowed to  raise all  claims 

that were foreclosed  by the abandonment and all claims that are  typically  raised in 

a petition  for  postconviction relief.  Petition of Hans,  1998 MT 7, ~19, 288  Mont. 

168, ~19, 958 P.2d  1175  ~19.  When defense counsel failed to  preserve the 

defendant's right to  appeal, the  interests of justice require that counsel be 

appointed to  assist him throughout his postconviction proceedings.  State v. 

Adams, 2002  MT 202, ~20, 311  Mont.  202, ~20, 54  P.3d 50, ~20. 

Petitioner asserts that  appellate counsel was ineffective for  failing  to 

preserve the right of appeal.  The facts  in support of this claim are set forth  in the 

Petition for Postconviction Relief and supporting affidavit. 

]F AlLURE OF THE PROSECUTOR TO DISCLOSE MATERIAL 

EVIDENCE. 

The  State has several affirmative duties to disclose evidence to a defendant. 

Pursuant to the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, the 

prosecution must disclose all evidence favorable  to  the accused that  is  material to 

either guilt or punishment.  Brady v.  Maryland,  373  U.S.  83,  86-87 (1963) 

("suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable  to an accused upon  request 

violates due process where the evidence is  material either to guilt or to  punishment, 

irrespective of the good faith  or bad faith  of the prosecution. ").  Second, Montana 

has adopted a statutory scheme that places affirmative duties on both the  State and 

a defendant.  State v.  Stewart, 2000 MT 379, ~21, 303  Mont.  507, ~21, 16  P.3d 391, 

~21, clting  §46-15-322, MCA. 

Unlike Brady, Montana's statutory requirements do not hinge on whether the 

evidence is exculpatory or inculpatory.  The  plain language of §46-15-327, MCA, 

simply  mandates that the  State disclose all  additional  information or material 

within the  State's possession.  Stewart, ~23.  The duty to discover favorable 

evidence, even in  possession of the police or other's acting on the government's 

behalf,  rests  with the prosecutor.  "But whether the prosecutor succeeds or fails  in 

meeting this  obligation (whether, that  is,  a failure  to  disclose in  good faith  or bad 

faith  (citation omitted)) the prosecution's responsibility for failing to  disclose 

known, favorable  evidence rising to  a material level of importance is  inescapable." 

Kyles  v.  Whitley,  514  U.S.  419,437-38. (1995). 

Evidence is  material  if there is a reasonable probability that the result would 

have been different had the evidence been disclosed to  the defense.  Strickler v. 

Greene, 527 U.S.  263, 289- 90 (1999).  "A 'reasonable probability' of a different 

result is accordingly  shown when the government's evidentiary suppression 

'undermines confidence in the outcome of the  trial.'  " Kyles,  514 U.S.  at 434. 

Thus, the prosecutorial duty to  disclose  favorable  material evidence encompasses 

impeachment evidence.  United States  v.  Bagley, 473  U.S.  667  (1985). 

Petitioner alleges that the  prosecutor failed  to  disclose material evidence, 

and that there is  a reasonable probability that the  result  would have been different 

had the evidence been disclosed to  the defendant.  The  facts  in  support of this 

claim are set forth  in the Petition  for  Postconviction Relief and supporting 

affidavit. 

CONCLUSION 

Petitioner requests that this Court order a responsive pleading from  the State 

responding to these allegations.  Petitioner further requests that the Court appoint 

counsel, set an  evidentiary hearing,  and grant postconviction relief and any other 

relief to which Petitioner is  entitled.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
