WHAT IS PATERNITY? 

“Paternity”  means  fatherhood.    Paternity  may  be  presumed  by  law  or 
 
determined by a court if it is disputed. 

WHY IS PATERNITY 
DETERMINATION IMPORTANT? 

Parents have the right to know their child and to contribute to that child’s 
future success.  Children need and are entitled to: 

  

Financial Support.  The law requires both parents to support their child, 
even if the pregnancy was unplanned or if the parents are not married to 
each other.   Children who are supported by only one parent often do not 
have enough money to meet their basic needs. 

 

  

Benefits. Children have the right to receive benefits from both parents if they 
 
are available.  Benefits may include but are not limited to:  Social Security, 
insurance, inheritance, and the Veterans’ Administration.  If paternity has 
not been presumed or determined by a court, a child might not be able to 
claim benefits from the father. 

 

 

Identity.  Children have the right to know their parents.  Children have the 
right to enjoy the sense of belonging that comes from knowing both parents. 

Medical History.  Children have the right to know if they have inherited 
any special health problems. 

  

WHAT IS A 
PRESUMPTION OF PATERNITY? 

A presumption of paternity is an assumption the law makes that a particular 
 
man is the father of a particular child.  The paternity of a child is presumed 
under the following circumstances of birth: 

1.  If the child’s mother is married, the mother’s husband is presumed to 

 

be the father of the child. 

1 

 

2.  If the mother is married but separated from her husband, and a court 
has issued a decree of separation within 10 months before the birth, the 
mother’s husband is presumed to be the father of the child. 

 

3.  If  the  child’s  mother  is  not  married,  but  she  was  married  within  10 
months before the birth, her latest husband before the birth is presumed 
 
to be the father of the child. 

 

4.  If the child’s mother is not married, there are several ways a particular 
man can be presumed to be the father of the child.  Most require that 
the man sign an acknowledgment and that the mother consent.  Two of 
the situations where a man is presumed to be the father of a child even 
when he has not acknowledged or claimed paternity in writing are: 

 

 

a.  A man may be presumed to be the father of a child if he receives 
the child into his home during the child’s minority and openly says 
the child is his. 

 

b.  A man may be presumed to be the father of a child on the basis 
of  genetic  tests.    Tissue  samples  (usually  cheek  cells,  taken  by 
 
 
cotton swab) are taken from the child, the child’s mother, and the 
man alleged to be the child’s father.  If the results of tests on these 
samples establish, by currently accepted scientific standards, that 
it is at least 95 percent probable that the man is the father of the 
child, he is presumed to be the father. 

5.  A man may be presumed to be the natural father of a child under the 

 

laws of the state or Indian territory in which the child is born. 

CAN A PRESUMPTION OF 
PATERNITY BE CHALLENGED? 
A rebuttable presumption of paternity can be challenged in court.  A court 
can consider evidence that may contradict the presumption, including, for 
example,  scientific  evidence  from  genetic  tests,  or  testimony  about  the 
 
whereabouts of the presumed father at the time of conception. In the law, 
a rebuttable presumption is not the same as a final court decision.  Most 
rebuttable presumptions,  including (in  Montana)  those  on  paternity,  can 
be challenged, or rebutted.  But a court decision on paternity can be final, 
as it can be altered only by that court or through review by a higher court. 

 

 

2 

An irrebuttable presumption is created if the parents sign an acknowledgment 
 
of  paternity  and  do  not  withdraw  it  within  60  days  or  before  a  support 
order is entered, whichever comes first.  Either parent can withdraw the 
acknowledgment.  An irrebuttable presumption has the same force and 
effect as a final district court order of paternity. An irrebuttable presumption 
 
can be challenged only if a party to the acknowledgment can prove fraud, 
duress,  or material mistake of fact. 

  

 

 

WHAT ABOUT 
COMMON LAW MARRIAGE? 

 
Montana recognizes common law marriage, though not all states do.  A 
common law marriage is as legally binding as a marriage performed by a 
minister or a justice of the peace—a “solemnized” marriage.  Marriage at 
common law would have the same effect on determining paternity as that 
of a solemnized marriage.  A common law marriage must be dissolved by 
a court before the parties are legally free to marry again.  There is no such 
thing as a common law divorce. 

 

 

Parties may be married by common law if: 

 

1.  Both parties are competent to marry (“competent to marry” means that 
the parties are of legal age to marry, that they are not already married to 
someone else, and that they are not closely related to each other—they 
are not brother and sister or first cousins); 

4. 

the parties tell other people, such as their friends, family, neighbors, or 
business people in their community, that they are married. 

2.  both parties agree to be married to each other; 

3. 

the parties live together as husband and wife; 

     

 
All of these requirements must be met before a common 
law marriage exists.  A common law marriage cannot 
happen  unless  the  parties  act  as  if  and  say  they  are 
married.  Simply living in the same household does 
not of itself create a common law marriage.  Like a 
 
solemnized marriage, a common law marriage creates 
a legally binding change in status.

ESTABLISHING PATERNITY 
—AFTER A CHILD IS BORN 
A man who believes he is the father of a child can create a presumption 
that  he  is  the  father  by  completing  a  form  that  is  called  a  “paternity 
 
acknowledgment .”  A man can acknowledge paternity even if he is not yet 
eighteen years old. If a minor chooses to sign, the minor’s parent(s) should 
sign the acknowledgment below the minor’s signature. Acknowledgments 
are available at hospitals, because the law requires a hospital to provide an 
unmarried mother and the alleged father an opportunity to complete one. 
Acknowledgments  are  also  available  from  the  Montana  Department  of 
 
Public Health and Human Services. An acknowledgment of paternity can 
allow the state to name the man as the child s natural father on the birth 
certificate and can create the same obligations and rights toward a child as 
those created when a child is born to married parents. 

 

A man may file an acknowledgment of paternity signed by him and the 
mother. What happens after that depends upon whether there is already a 
presumed father: 

1.   If there is no presumed father, the acknowledgment creates an immediate 
 
presumption of paternity under law. 

2.  If there is already a presumed father, the acknowledgment can still be 
effective.  In  this  situation,  the  written  consent  of  the  already-presumed 
 
father  must  be  obtained,  or  the  presumption  that  already  exists  must  be 
successfully challenged or rebutted in a court proceeding. 

 

A completed acknowledgment is sent to the Office of Vital Statistics of the 
Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services and becomes 
an irrebuttable presumption of paternity. An irrebuttable presumption has 
the same force and effect as a district court order and may be set aside only 
for fraud, duress or material mistake of fact. 

Legal  responsibilities  created  by  signing  the  paternity  acknowledgment 
 
may not be stopped while an action to set aside a presumption is pending. 

 

 

 

 

 

  

An acknowledgment of paternity may be withdrawn by either the mother 
or the father within 60 days after it was signed, or before a support order is 
entered, whichever comes first.  The parent withdrawing the acknowledgment 
 
must file a “Notice of Withdrawal of Paternity Acknowledgment” with the 
Department of Public Health and Human Services. A “Notice of Withdrawal 
of Paternity Acknowledgment” form is provided to both parents at the same 
time as the opportunity to sign the paternity acknowledgment.  Additional 
forms are also available at any regional Child Support Office.

WHAT IF THE IDENTITY OF 
THE FATHER IS NOT CERTAIN? 
If a mother is uncertain about the identity of her child’s father, she should 
not agree to sign a paternity acknowledgment naming the father.  Instead, 
she should contact the Department of Public Health and Human Services, 
Child Support Services Division (CSSD) for help.  The CSSD can help the 
 
mother  determine  what  steps  are  necessary  to  determine  paternity  for 
her child. A CSSD worker will ask questions about men who may be the 
father.  The mother’s  information is confidential, though it can be used 
in a closed administrative or judicial hearing to help establish paternity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A man who is uncertain about whether he is the father of a child may choose 
 
to  undergo  genetic testing.    Genetic tests  compare characteristics of  the 
man’s body tissue with the mother’s  and child’s.  Either the man or the 
 
mother may choose to have the tests done at his or her expense.  Or, the 
parties may agree to share the costs of the testing. 

  

 

If the CSSD begins an action to determine paternity, the CSSD may ask 
the parent who denies a particular man’s paternity to pay for testing.  If 
the  CSSD  begins  an  action  and  the  parent  cannot  afford  the  costs  of 
testing, the CSSD may initially pay for the tests. However, the state may 
later  ask  the parent (either the mother or the alleged father) who denies 
paternity to repay the state for the costs of the genetic tests. 

Current medical studies show that genetic tests to establish paternity are 
very accurate. Usually tissue for the tests is taken at sites throughout the 
state, and it is then sent to an out-of-state laboratory.  The test results are 
usually received several weeks after the tissue is taken. 

Under Montana law, a presumption of paternity may be created by the test 
results.  If the laboratory results show that the tested man’s probability of 
paternity is 95 percent or more, then that man is presumed to be the father. 

  

The presumption of paternity that is created by genetic 
test results may be challenged in court.  To successfully 
rebut the presumption, the person challenging it must 
produce evidence that would disprove paternity.   For 
example, a man may offer evidence that during the time 
the child would have been conceived, it would not have 
been possible for him to have been with the mother.

WHO PAYS CHILD SUPPORT? 

Under Montana law,  both parents are responsible for the support of their 
child.  If the parents do not live together with the child, either parent may 
seek to have a support order established. 

 

 

A  support  order  can  be  set  by  either  a  Montana  district  court  or  the 
CSSD. The  amount  of  support,  whether  set  by  a  court  or  the  CSSD, 
 
 
will  be determined by using the Montana Child Support Guidelines; it is 
based on the income and earning ability of each parent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

State  law  requires  that  child  support  payments  be  made  by  mandatory 
deduction  from  a  parent’s  pay  check  unless  the  order  permits  another 
method of payment. 

If a parent is subject to the jurisdiction of a tribal court, that court may set 
or enforce child support. 

WHAT IF A PARENT 
GETS BEHIND IN SUPPORT 
PAYMENTS? 

If  a  parent  falls  behind  in  paying  child  support,  steps  may  be  taken  to 
 
enforce the order. If the CSSD is enforcing the order, it will require that 
an employer withhold the support from the parent’s paycheck.  Payments 
can  also  be  withheld  from  a  parent’s  unemployment  compensation  or 
 
workers’  compensation  benefits.  Federal  and  state  income  tax  refunds 
can also be taken  to  pay  past-due  child  support,  and  other  property  can 
be seized and sold. 

 

If a parent who owes or should pay child support lives in another state, 
there are agreements between the states to help collect and set the amount 
of  child  support,  locate  absent  parents,  and  establish  paternity.    A 
parent who needs these services should contact the CSSD for help. 

6 

 DOES CHILD SUPPORT STOP 
WHEN A PARENT MARRIES 
SOMEONE ELSE? 

No. Unless a child is adopted, child support does not change automatically 
if one or both parents enter into other families or have other children. 

HOW IS THE AMOUNT OF CHILD 
SUPPORT DETERMINED? 

 

Montana, like all states, has Child Support Guidelines, which are rules for 
setting a standard amount of child support based on the child’s needs and 
the parents’ ability to pay. Some of the things that determine the amount 
of child support are the number of children included in the support order 
calculation, who the children reside with, and the amount of income earned 
by each parent. If there are child care expenses or health insurance expenses, 
 
those will also be taken into consideration.  A complete list of the items 
that are used to determine the amount of child support may be found in the 
Administrative Rules of Montana, or other reference materials published 
by the Department of Public Health and Human Services. 

 

DOES THE AMOUNT OF CHILD 
SUPPORT EVER CHANGE? 

When  a  parent’s    income  and  expenses  change,  it  may  be  possible  for 
a  court  or  the  CSSD  to  change  the  amount  of  child  support.  A  parent 
who  is  concerned  about  that  should  consult  an  attorney  or  contact  the 
CSSD,  or examine the Guidelines found in the Administrative Rules of 
Montana. The Guidelines are available on the website listed on the front 
cover  (select  Forms). Also,  parents  can  obtain  copies  of  the  Guidelines, 
 
and of the financial affidavit and guidelines worksheet used to determine 
the  support  amount,  by  calling  the  CSDD  at  the  numbers  on  the  front 
cover.

Detailed information about custody and visitation is beyond 
the  scope  of  this  booklet,  but  establishing  paternity  is  a 
necessary  first  step  toward  gaining  custody  or  visitation 
rights. Montana law does not automatically grant custody 
to either parent. 

Parents may wish to consult an attorney for help regarding 
custody  or  visitation,  though  any  person  has  a  right  to 
 
represent himself or herself before a court. 

WHAT ABOUT 
CUSTODY AND VISITATION? 

WHAT ABOUT 
HEALTH INSURANCE FOR A CHILD? 

In addition to monetary support, parents also have an obligation to provide 
health insurance for their child(ren).  A health insurance obligation 
will usually be established at the same time a parent’s child support 
 
obligation  is  established.  Both  parents  are  responsible  for  health 
insurance coverage, just as both are responsible for child support. 

  

Parents who have insurance available to them at a reasonable cost will be 
ordered to obtain coverage for the children.  Parents who do not have 
reasonably-priced coverage available to them will be ordered to obtain 
coverage whenever it becomes available to them in the future. 

The costs of insurance coverage are considered when calculating the child 

support obligation only if the insurance is actually in place.
