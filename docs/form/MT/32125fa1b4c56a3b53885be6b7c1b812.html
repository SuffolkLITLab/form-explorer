What is long-term care?
Long-term care means helping people of any age with 
their medical needs or daily activities over a long period 
of time. It includes a wide variety of services and support 
that can be provided in your home, in an adult day care, 
or in other living arrangements, such as continuing care 
retirement communities, home health, assisted living 
facilities, or nursing homes. 

Long-term care services help with chronic illness, 
disabilities or other conditions that may be limiting 
physically or mentally. Most long-term care is for 
assistance with “activities of daily living” (ADLs). 
The six ADLs include eating, bathing, dressing, 
toileting, transferring (getting up from bed, chairs), 
and maintaining continence. Persons with cognitive 
impairments such as Alzheimer’s disease or other 
dementias may require long-term care services.

How can I provide for the cost of long-
term care?
Once you become aware of the startling costs of long-
term care, you may ask yourself, “How will I ever be able 
to afford long-term care if I need it?” Some Montanans 
are able to pay for their long-term care from present 
income, savings and investments. Others, who own real 
property such as a home, could sell it and use the proceeds 
to pay for care. A reverse mortgage is another possibility. 
This special type of loan allows home owners to convert 
a portion of the equity in their home into cash with 
payments that are typically made on a monthly basis.
Some elderly persons plan to depend on a spouse 
or adult children to care for them, while others would 
not want to place such a burden and responsibility on 
their family members. A spouse may be in ill health and 
unable to provide caregiving. Adult children may be 

raising their own children or may be located too far away 
to provide day-to-day assistance for parents who need 
continuous care.

Another option often discussed at the local coffee 
shop is for people to “use up” or “give away” their assets 
to their children to qualify for Medicaid. The goal is 
to become “impoverished” and let the government 
pay for their long-term care. However, Medicaid has 
restrictions such as “eligibility requirements,” “look-back 
rules on transferred property,” “uncompensated asset 

FACT: 70 percent of persons age 65 or older are expected 
to need some type of long-term care during their lifetime.

FACT: Nationally, the average nursing home stay is 2.5 
years,  with  one  in  five  persons  staying  more  than  five 
years.  During  2017  the  average  length  of  residency  in 
Montana was about 2.4 years.

FACT:    The  average  cost  of  care  for  an  individual  in  a 
nursing facility in Montana during 2017 was $7,209 per 
month ($86,505  annually) for a semi-private room. 

FACT:  The average monthly cost of hiring a home health 
care  aide  in  the  United  States  is  $4,099;  in  Montana, 
$4,648. 

FACT:    Nursing  home  residents  and  their  families  in 
Montana pay about 32 percent of their total long-term 
care costs; Medicaid pays about 61 percent; Medicare 
pays 7 percent. 

FACT:  Only 10 percent of Americans age 65 and older 
had private long-term care insurance coverage in 2017.

other regulations are described in the MSU Extension 
MontGuide, Medicaid and Long-Term Care Costs 
(MT199511HR). 

Another alternative is the purchase of long-term care 
insurance. Policies may be purchased individually from 
a licensed insurance agent who represents one or more 
companies. Some employers provide an opportunity for 
the employee to purchase a long-term care group policy at 
the workplace.

Typically, policies reimburse the insured for long-term 
care expenses up to a maximum amount, such as $100 or 
$150 per day with a cap on benefits between $100,000 
and $300,000. Other policies reimburse the insured on a 
monthly basis.

Since 1997 most long-term care insurance policies are 
“tax qualified;” a few are not. The tax qualified status will be 
stated on the face of the policy. A policy that is tax qualified 
means the premium payments qualify as an itemized 
deduction on a federal income tax return up to a defined 
limit, based on the age of the policyholder and inflation. 
Montana allows a dollar-for-dollar reduction in adjusted 
gross income for premiums paid for qualified long-term 
care insurance for the benefit of a Montana taxpayer, the 
taxpayer’s dependents, parents or grandparents (more 
about Montana tax benefits on page 6).

A new alternative for Montanans to pay the cost 
of long-term care is the purchase of a long-term care 
partnership insurance policy. The purpose of this 
MontGuide is to provide basic information about the 
development of the Montana long-term care partnership 
insurance program and how it works. Tax benefits and 
shopping tips are also highlighted.

How did the long-term care partnership 
insurance program develop?
Montana’s long-term care partnership insurance program 
was authorized by the legislature and became effective on 
July 1, 2009. The collaboration consists of:
•  Private insurance companies; 
•  Insurance Division, Montana Commissioner of 

Securities and Insurance; and 

•  Montana Medicaid program, Department of Public 

Health and Human Services (DPHHS). 
Because partnership policies help pay for purchasers’ 
expenses for long-term care, they are less likely to need 
Medicaid, thus eventually reducing costs for the state. 
The partnership program also benefits purchasers of these 
policies because they are allowed to keep some or all of 
what they have worked a lifetime to accumulate. 

How does long-term care partnership 
insurance work?
Montanans who purchase a long-term care partnership 
insurance policy are protected from the requirement 
that they have to “use up” almost all their financial 
resources to qualify for Medicaid. When a Montanan 
who has purchased a qualified long-term care partnership 
insurance policy needs care, benefits will help cover the 
costs of care up to the maximum lifetime limit (often 
called pool) of the policy. 

If the lifetime limit is reached and the individual still 
needs care, any assets equal to the value of the policy limit 
will not be included when a determination is being made 
about the person’s eligibility for Medicaid. Examples of 
how a long-term care partnership insurance policy could 
benefit single and married persons are described below. 

Example 1: Single Person. Betty Lou is a widow who 
purchased a long-term care partnership insurance 
policy when she was age 45 with a maximum lifetime 
benefit pool of $100,000. By age 72, Betty Lou’s 
remaining assets include $50,000 in certificates of 
deposit (CDs) that she wants to leave to her two 
grandchildren and $2,000 in her checking account. 
When Betty Lou needed long-term care, first in 
her home and later in a nursing home, the benefits 
of the partnership policy covered her expenses until 
the maximum lifetime pool of $100,000 was reached. 
When Betty became responsible for the payments 
to the nursing home, her daughter visited the local 
Office of Public Assistance (OPA) and provided 
documentation from the insurance company of Betty 
Lou’s use of a maximum lifetime benefit pool of 
$100,000 from a qualified long-term care partnership 
insurance policy. The OPA excluded the benefit of 
$100,000 paid to Betty Lou from the “countable 
resource” calculation for her Medicaid eligibility. 
Betty Lou was able keep the CDs ($50,000) to 
leave to her grandchildren and the $2,000 in her 
checking account because she had purchased and used 
the $100,000 benefit of her qualified long-term care 
partnership insurance policy. Betty Lou did not have 
to “spend down” all of her remaining resources before 
becoming eligible for Medicaid. 

Example 2: Married Couple. Shirley and Bud own a 
ranch in eastern Montana. Their son has stayed on the 
ranch and contributed to the financial success of the 
business. As Shirley and Bud have grown older, their 
son has taken on more of the ranch responsibilities. 
One of Shirley and Bud’s estate planning goals is for 
their son to inherit the ranch valued at $600,000. 

2

Shirley and Bud decided to purchase a long-term 
care partnership insurance policy. Their goal was to 
provide insurance benefits for up to $600,000 of long-
term care costs if one of them needed such care. 
While the long-term care partnership insurance 
policy they purchased is in place, the benefits would 
help cover the cost of care at home, in an assisted living 
facility, or in a nursing home. (Not all policies offer 
these alternative care options.) Then, if the long-term 
care partnership insurance policy reaches the maximum 
benefit limit, Shirley or Bud could apply for Medicaid 
(depending on who was in the nursing home). 

In the Medicaid eligibility calculation, the equity 
in their ranch is excluded up to the full amount of 
the long-term care partnership policy. This means if 
their policy had paid $600,000 in benefits, the value 
of their ranch would not be included as an asset in the 
calculation of Bud or Shirley’s eligibility for Medicaid. 
After the death of Shirley and Bud, their son could 
inherit the ranch. Medicaid would not place a lien on 
the ranch for the reimbursement of $600,000 of benefits 
paid. However, if the value in the ranch had increased to 
$800,000 at the time their deaths, and if Shirley or Bud 
had nursing home expenses above $600,000 that were 
paid by Medicaid, Medicaid would place a lien against 
the increase of $200,000 in value of the ranch. 

The value of $600,000 in benefits would be excluded 

from any estate recovery procedures by the Montana 
Medicaid program because Shirley and Bud had 
purchased and used the full benefits of a qualified long-
term care partnership insurance policy. 
In summary, resources up to the amount of benefits 

paid from a qualified long-term care partnership 
insurance policy are “protected” in the resource eligibility 
determination for Medicaid.

Why not just give away all my assets to 
become qualified for Medicaid instead of 
paying for a long-term care partnership 
insurance policy?
Federal law requires a period of Medicaid “ineligibility” if 
people give away assets or transfer them for less than fair 
market value within a certain time period (known as the 
“look-back period”). In 2006, the look-back period for 
the transfer of assets changed from 36 months (3 years) to 
60 months (5 years). 

This brief description of the look-back period eligibility 

rules is general in nature. Exceptions exist under which 
no ineligibility period is imposed. For example, there 

are exceptions relating to transfers to spouses, disabled 
children of any age, siblings with an ownership interest in 
a house, children who provided care to keep a parent out 
of a nursing home for two years, and transfers done for a 
purpose other than becoming Medicaid eligible. 
Further information about Medicaid eligibility 

requirements in Montana is available in the MontGuide, 
Medicaid and Long-Term Care Costs (MT199511HR). Free 
copies can be obtained from your local county Extension 
office or ordered from MSU Extension Publications at 
(406) 994-3273 or online, http://store.msuextension.org.
The following examples show how the look-back rules 

apply for single and married persons.

Example 3: Assume Betty Lou (from Example 1) had 
gifted the $50,000 CDs to her grandchildren before she 
applied for Medicaid. The “uncompensated asset transfer 
penalty” and ineligibility period rules would apply. 
The ineligibility period is set at the number of 
months that would otherwise be required to spend 
the “uncompensated value” of the transferred assets 
($50,000 in CDs in Betty Lou’s situation) on nursing 
home care. During 2017 the Montana average 
monthly cost of nursing home care is $6,819. 

The ineligibility period is one month for every  
$6,819 of “uncompensated” value Betty Lou gave 
away. If she had given the CDs to her grandchildren, 
Betty Lou would not have received Medicaid coverage 
for about seven months after she entered the nursing 
home ($50,000 ÷ $ $6,819 = 7.33 months).

Example 4: Assume Shirley and Bud (from Example 
2) had transferred the ranch to their son. A year 
later Bud suffered a severe brain trauma after he was 
thrown from a horse. He was eventually placed in the 
local nursing home. Bud would have been subject to 
an “uncompensated asset transfer penalty” resulting 
in an ineligibility period before he would qualify for 
Medicaid. 

The ineligibility period for Bud would have been a 
little over nine years ($600,000 ÷  $6,819 = 88 months 
÷ 12 = 7.33 years). In addition there would have been 
gifting “tax consequences.” The son would have had 
to assume Shirley and Bud’s basis in the ranch. This 
means that if he sold the ranch, there would be tax 
due on the capital gain (the difference between the 
basis and the fair market value of the ranch at the date 
of sale). More details are outlined in the Montguide, 
Gifting (MT199105HR).

Will the purchase of a long-term 
care partnership insurance policy 
automatically qualify me for Medicaid?
No. The purchase of a long-term care partnership 
insurance policy may help protect your assets up to 
the amount of benefits paid, if you become eligible for 
Medicaid, but it does not automatically qualify you for 
Medicaid. 

Call your local county Office of Public Assistance 
with specific questions about Medicaid eligibility rules 
or visit the DPHHS website, http://dphhs.mt.gov/
MontanaHealthcarePrograms/MemberServices. Medicaid 
application materials are also available at www.dphhs.
mt.gov/sltc/programs/Medicaid/IndexMedicaid.shtml.

What companies provide long-term 
care partnership insurance policies in 
Montana?
The Montana Commissioner of Securities and Insurance 
website lists companies that sell partnership policies at 
http://csimt.gov/your-insurance/long-term-care/. Call 
800-332-6148. Your insurance agent should also have the 
list. General information about other types of insurance 
and securities is also available at http://csimt.gov. 
While information specific to long-term care 

partnership insurance policies may not be easily found at 
the companies’ websites, each provides a toll-free number 
to assist you in your search for specific information. You 
may also want to contact your insurance agent to request 
information about available long-term care partnership 
insurance policies. 

Montana insurance professionals must have special 
training before they can sell long-term care partnership 
insurance policies from any of the companies with 
endorsement approvals. They must be licensed as a 
producer for life or disability insurance. They must have 
completed a one-time training course of at least eight 
hours. And, they must complete ongoing training of no 
less than four hours every 24 months. 

How can the financial stability of 
insurance companies that sell long-
term care partnership policies be 
determined?
Understandably, Montanans who purchase long-term 
care partnership insurance policies from a company want 
some assurance that the company will be in business to 
pay their claims in the future when they need long-term 
care. While there are no guarantees, ratings provided by 
credit agencies such as A.M. Best Company, Standard & 

Poor’s Corporation, and Moody’s Investor Services can be 
a guide. Each agency has a system for rating an insurer’s 
financial strength and viability to meet claims obligations 
based on a variety of factors such as underwriting, 
expense control, reserve adequacy, and investments. 
The American Association for Long-Term Care 
provides a summary from the three rating agencies for 
many insurance companies, available online at www.
aaltci.org/long-term-care-insurance/learning-center/
company-ratings.php.

What is the cost of a long-term care 
partnership insurance policy?
The cost of premiums for a partnership policy will 
depend on your age when the policy is purchased and 
the type of coverage chosen. The 2017 Montana Long-
Term Care Rate Comparison Guide from the Montana 
Commissioner of Securities and Insurance is a good place 
to start at http://csimt.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017-
LTC-Rate-Guide.pdf. Rates from a variety of companies 
are provided. While these rates are for regular long-term 
care policies and from companies that don’t necessarily 
sell partnership policies, the charts can provide a 
basis for comparison. You can order the publication 
from the Montana Commissioner of Securities and 
Insurance (see page 5), or by calling (800) 332-6148. 
CSI also has an informative booklet on Long-Term 
Care Insurance at http://csimt.gov/wp-content/uploads/
ConsumerGdeLTC_newlogo.pdf. 

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners 
has a publication that also provides a table revealing how 
premiums can fluctuate from company to company, A 
Shopper’s Guide to Long-Term Care Insurance. This guide 
can be ordered for free from www.naic.org/documents/
prod_serv_consumer_ltc_lp.pdf. Your actual premium 
may be higher or lower than those listed because your age 
and coverage desired may be different.  

Premiums will not increase due to changes in your 
health. However, they can increase, on a class basis (for 
example all policy-holders age 75 or older), with the 
approval of the Montana Commissioner of Securities and 
Insurance. 

How much of my income should be 
spent on long-term care insurance?
Not everyone can afford long-term care insurance. 
Whether or not long-term care insurance is a viable 
alternative depends on a person's current assets, monthly 
income and financial goals. Key questions to consider are:
•  Do I have assets that I want to protect?
•  Is the premium affordable given my monthly income? 

4

•  Will I be able to afford the premium in the future?
•  Do I want to protect assets for my spouse, children or 

grandchildren?

•  Do I want to leave an inheritance to family and/or a 

charitable organization?
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners 

(NAIC) recommends that long-term care insurance 
premiums should consume no more than seven percent 
(7%) of annual gross income. 

Example 5: Joe and Debbie have a gross income of 
$84,000. Based on the recommendation of NAIC, 
the amount spent for their long-term care insurance 
policies should not exceed $5,880 annually ($84,000 
x 7% = $5,880). Their monthly insurance premiums 
should not exceed $490. 

What questions should be asked before 
purchasing a long-term care insurance 
policy? 
While some policies cover only nursing home stays, others 
are more comprehensive, paying benefits for home care, 
adult day care and care provided in assisted living facilities. 
Policies also offer various options for the benefit amount 
paid for care each day and over a person’s lifetime, the 
length of the elimination or waiting (deductible) period 
and the type of inflation adjustment provided. 

There are many resources that provide additional 

information about features to consider when shopping for 
a long-term care insurance policy. Some are booklets that 
can be mailed to you. Other publications are available for 
download from websites. Addresses are provided if you 
do not have access to a computer and the Internet. The 
publications are free unless otherwise noted.

A Long-Term Care Insurance Policy Comparison Tool 

This tool is part of a Web-based educational program 
from the University of Illinois Extension Service and 
is designed to help consumers compare up to three 
different long-term care insurance policies, www.
longtermcare.illinois.edu. 

Are premiums paid for a long-term 
care partnership insurance policy tax 
deductible?
The federal government and state of Montana provide 
tax incentives to those who purchase regular tax qualified 
long-term care insurance or partnership policies. 
Federal. Premium payments for tax qualified long-term 
care insurance or long-term care partnership policies are 
deductible on Schedule A (Form 1040) for individuals 
who have itemized medical expenses exceeding 10 percent 
of their adjusted gross income (AGI) in 2019. However, 
there are also limits on the deductible amount based 
on the taxpayer’s age (Table 1). The limits are adjusted 
annually for inflation.

Example 6: Dan (age 68) and Marlene (age 65) paid 
$8,537 for tax qualified long-term care partnership 
insurance policies in 2018. Each has a tax deductible 
premium of $4,196 (Table 1). The amount included 
on “Schedule A: Itemized Deductions” (Form 1040) is 
$8,320 ($4,160 + $4,160 =$8,320). 

Itemized medical expenses exceeding 10 percent of 
Dan and Marlene’s adjusted gross income are deductible. 
With their combined income of $85,000 they are in a 
federal marginal tax rate of 22 percent. Federal tax rates 
for various income levels can be found at https://www.irs.

itemized medical expenses) [$85,000 x 10% = $8,500 
(the amount above $8,500 would be the amount of 
the premium that is deductible). 

Montana. A tax deduction is allowed for premiums paid 
for a tax qualified or partnership long-term care insurance 
for the benefit of a Montana taxpayer and the taxpayer’s 
dependents, parents or grandparents. Montana allows 
a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the Montana adjusted 
gross income for qualified long-term care premiums. The 
total amount for the premiums is entered on Form 2 
“Schedule III – Montana Itemized Deductions,” line 6 
(the line number may change from year to year). 

Example 7: The amount Dan and Marlene (Example 
6) can deduct from adjusted gross income on their 
Montana tax return is $8,320, the total cost of their 
long-term care partnership insurance premiums. The 
amount of Montana tax savings is about $574 ($8,320 
x 6.9% [The Montana tax rate on income above 
$17,900 is 6.9%] = $574). Montana tax rates are 
available at www.revenue.mt.gov  

Are the benefits received from a long-
term care partnership insurance policy 
taxable?

Long-term care benefits paid to the insured are 

generally excluded from income if the policy is designated 
as “tax qualified.” Most long-term care insurance and 
all long-term care partnership insurance policies are 
tax qualified. To exclude payments from income, the 
insured must file IRS Form 8853 with the 1040 return. 
The amount is provided on Form 1099-LTC sent by 
the insurance company. However, the exclusion amount 
is subject to a limit. Under this limit, the excludable 
amount is calculated by subtracting any reimbursement 
received (through insurance or otherwise) for the cost of 
qualified long-term care services during the year from the 
larger of the following amounts: 
•  The actual cost of qualified long-term care services 

during the period.

•  The dollar amount of benefits for the period ($360 per 

day for any period in 2017; $131,400 annually).
Example 8: Nora met the definition of her long-term 
care policy of needing assistance and moved into an 
assisted living facility. During 2017 she received 12 
monthly payments on a daily per diem basis from her 
qualified long-term care contract. The payment of 
$3,000 per month ($36,000 total) was listed on Form 
1099-LTC. None of her long term-care benefits were 
taxable in 2017.

Is a long-term care policy purchased 
before the partnership program began 
in Montana considered a partnership 
policy?
If you purchased a long-term care policy before July 1, 
2009, the policy could be eligible for certification as a 
long-term care partnership insurance policy. First, the 
company would need to decide if it wants to comply 
with the partnership rules at the state and federal levels 
and reissue or exchange your policy for a long-term care 
partnership insurance policy. 

If the company decides “yes,” the next step is to submit 
the policy for certification by the Montana Commissioner 
of Securities and Insurance. If the Commissioner certifies 
the revised policy, the company should provide you with 
a “Partnership Status Disclosure Notice.” 

Contact your insurance agent to see if a previously 

purchased long-term policy could be reissued or exchanged 
for a “certified partnership policy.” You can also ask the 
Montana Commissioner of Securities and Insurance. 

Is a long-term care partnership 
insurance policy purchased in another 
state certified in Montana?
A long-term care partnership insurance policy issued 
when you lived in another state may be “certified” if 
you later become a Montana resident. To determine if 
the policy is certified in Montana, contact the Montana 
Commissioner of Securities and Insurance. 

Representatives from the Montana Commissioner 

of Securities and Insurance will review the policy to 
determine if all of the following conditions are met:
•  If the insured person was a resident of a partnership state 
when coverage first became effective under the policy,
•  If the policy meets the IRS definition of a “qualified 

long-term care insurance policy,”

•  If the policy issue date was issued, re-issued, or 

exchanged on July 1, 2009 or thereafter, 

•  If the policy meets specific rules of the National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners, and

•  If the policy includes an inflation protection clause.  
This requirement varies depending on the age of the 
insured at the time of purchase:

- If the purchaser is under 61 years of age, compound      
   annual inflation protection must be provided.

- If the purchaser is between 61-76 years of age, some  
   level of inflation protection must be provided. 

- If the purchaser is over 76 years of age, inflation  
   protection is optional.

What if I want to make changes to my 
long-term care partnership insurance 
policy after it is purchased? 
Any changes made to a long-term care partnership 
insurance policy could affect whether the policy continues 
to be certified under Montana regulations. Before you 
make any modifications, consult your insurance agent to 
determine the effect of proposed changes. Be sure to get 
any responses in writing so you will have documentation 
should questions arise later about whether the policy 
remains certified in Montana.

Summary
Montana has initiated a long-term care partnership 
insurance program allowing persons to protect some or 
all of their assets (depending on the plan purchased), if 
they need long-term care. The long-term care partnership 
insurance program helps Montanans pay for their long-
term care without having to spend down their assets, as 
they would have to do if they relied totally on Medicaid 
to pay for their long-term care. 

By allowing Montanans to keep some or all of what 

they’ve worked hard to accumulate and by reducing 
Medicaid costs for the state, the partnership program 
provides benefits for everyone. State and federal laws 
also allow for deductions for qualified long-term care 
premiums when calculating annual income taxes.
