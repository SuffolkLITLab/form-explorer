      <pre>Outlines the legal and tax ramifications, as well as impacts on 
emotional and physical health, of financing long-term care.

A MAJOR CONCERN FOR OLDER ADULTS is the cost for 
long-term care. They are afraid those costs will diminish their life 
savings. Some fear if their assets become depleted by a long-term 
illness, the dignity, security, and independence they worked a 
lifetime to achieve will also disappear. 

According to the U. S. Department of Health and Human 

Services:

•  Someone turning age 65 today has a 70 percent chance of 

needing long-term care services.

•  Women need care longer (3.7 years) than men (2.2 years).
•  One-third of today’s 65-year-olds may never need long-term 
care, but 20 percent will need it for longer than 5 years. 

Nursing home care is the largest out-of-pocket health care 
expense for seniors. The standard cost in Montana is $7,670.48 
per month ($252.18 per day from July 2020 - June 2021), almost 
$92,046 per year. Medicaid pays about 61 percent of the cost 
while Medicare only pays about 7 percent. Nursing home residents 
and their families pay about 32 percent.

This MontGuide explains:

•  options for covering long-term care costs; 
•  eligibility requirements for the Medicaid application process;
•  role of trusts in the protection of assets; and
•  consequences of giving away assets to qualify for Medicaid.

Ways to provide for long-term care costs 

There are four alternatives for individuals to consider for 

covering long-term care expenses.

First, some Montanans pay the annual cost of about $92,046 
per person from their present income, savings, and investments. 
Those with real property or other assets could sell them and use 
the proceeds to pay for long-term care. 

Second, some Montanans buy a regular long-term care 
insurance policy or a long-term care partnership insurance policy.

For more information, see the MSU Extension Montguide, 
Long-term Care Partnership Insurance in Montana (https://store.
msuextension.org/Products/Long-Term-Care-Partnership-
Insurance-in-Montana-MT201202HR__MT201202HR.aspx, 
MT201202HR). Partnership policies allow purchasers to keep 
some or all of what they have worked a lifetime to accumulate, 
while still qualifying for Medicaid. 

The Montana Office of the Commissioner of Securities and 
Insurance has information about long-term care insurance. To 
request a copy of the Montana Consumer’s Guide to Long-Term Care 
and the Long-Term Care Insurance Rate Comparison Guide, call 
800-332-6148 or download at https://csimt.gov/your-insurance/
long-term-care/. Aging Services in DPHHS also has information 
about long-term care insurance https://dphhs.mt.gov/sltc/aging/
longtermcareinsurance.

Third, Montanans may depend on adult children to pay for 
their long-term care costs. This could create financial hardships 
for family members who are paying their own bills, paying 
for their children’s college education, saving for retirement, or 
making mortgage payments on a home, family farm/ranch or 
other business. 

Adult children, however, may feel they are not responsible 
for the cost of their parents’ long-term care. Unless there is a 
contractual agreement between the parents and children, Montana 
law does not require adult children to pay for their parents’ long-
term care costs.

Fourth, some Montanans plan to apply for Medicaid when 
they go into a nursing home or assisted living facility. Medicaid 
is a federal and state program providing comprehensive medical 
care, including nursing home care, to low-income individuals. 

Eligibility requirements for Medicaid 

Montana sets rules for Medicaid eligibility but follows 
federal guidelines because Congress provides about 66 percent 
of Medicaid funding. The Montana Legislature gives funds for 
the remaining 34 percent.

FAMILY FINANCIAL MANAGEMENTMT199511HR, CURRENT AS OF 4/21Medicaid and Long-Term Care CostsBy Marsha A. Goetting, Ph.D., CFP®, CFCS, Professor and Family Economics Specialist, MSU ExtensionMontGuidePatti GoroskiAssets test 

The assets test measures whether the dollar amount of an 
applicant’s assets (resources) fall within Medicaid eligibility levels. 
An applicant’s assets (resources) are either countable or excluded 
for Medicaid eligibility purposes.

Countable resources. These consist of all real and personal 
property owned (solely or jointly with others) by the person 
applying for Medicaid. Examples of countable resources include: 
non-home real estate; vehicles; checking and savings accounts; 
certificates of deposit; cash value in life insurance; stocks, bonds, 
and mutual funds; individual retirement accounts (IRAs); Keogh 
accounts; contracts for deed; life estates; oil and mineral rights; 
items of unusual value (such as jewelry, coins and art work); and 
any other assets over which the individual has control (such as 
assets in a revocable living trust). An applicant must use countable 
resources exceeding the limit to pay for nursing home care before 
Medicaid benefits can become available. 

Excluded  resources.  Montana  Medicaid  eligibility 
requirements categorize certain assets as excluded resources. 
These resources do not count towards the Medicaid resource 
limit of $2,000. Examples of excluded resources include a home 
the applicant has been living in and expects to return to (as 
long as the home is valued at $603,000 or less); a home used as 
a primary residence by the spouse or other dependents of the 
nursing home resident (there is no value limit on this home); 
most personal effects and ordinary household goods; cash value 
of all life insurance with a total face value of less than $5,000; all 
term insurance; burial plots regardless of value; burial fund of up 
to $1,500; an irrevocable burial contract with a funeral home on 
a state approved form; and one vehicle used for transportation.
Property used by the owner of a trade or business is not a 
countable asset if the property is for self-employment. Income 
producing property up to $6,000 of the equity may be eligible 
for exclusion. The $6,000 exclusion applies to the total value 
of all income-producing property, not against each property 
individually. The value of livestock used to produce income 
necessary for employment or raised for home consumption is an 
excluded resource. Livestock pets are also an excluded resource.
Marital assets. For married couples, the assets of both the 
husband and wife are countable resources for Medicaid eligibility 
purposes, regardless of whose name appears on the titles. Countable 
resources include all separately owned property of each spouse. All 
jointly owned property (whether held as tenancy in common or in 
joint tenancy with right of survivorship) is a countable resource. 
Property held in joint tenancy with others, such as children or 
grandchildren, is also a countable resource for the full value of 
the joint tenancy. 

Example 1: John has $50,000 in certificates of deposit 
in his name only. His wife, Mary, has $40,000 in U.S. 
savings bonds in her name only. They also own $60,000 in 

2

mutual funds held as joint tenants with right of survivorship 
in four names – John, Mary, and their two sons. John owns 
a minority stock interest in the family ranch corporation 
valued at $100,000. 

The total value of their assets is $250,000 ($50,000 + 
$40,000 + $60,000 + $100,000 = $250,000). If John applies 
for Medicaid, the value of the minority stock ($100,000) is 
their only excluded resource. Their other resources including 
the CDs, savings bonds, mutual funds ($150,000), however, 
are countable resources for Medicaid eligibility purposes.

Premarital agreement. Couples who marry later in life 
often have a premarital agreement because, as parents, they wish 
to protect assets for their children. The premarital agreement 
or contract typically says the property will remain separately 
owned by each spouse if the marriage ends in divorce or death. 
More information about Premarital Agreements is available 
from your local MSU Extension office or the MontGuide can be 
downloaded, https://store.msuextension.org/Products/Premarital-
Agreement-Contracts-in-Montana-Financial-and-Legal-Aspects-
MT201212HR__MT201212HR.aspx.

Even with the pre-marital contract, all property titled in their 
separate names are countable resources for Medicaid eligibility 
purposes after they are married. 

Example 2: Andy and Nancy each have adult children 
from an earlier marriage. They signed a premarital agreement 
saying their property would remain in separate names. Each 
had a will having a provision saying individually-owned 
property would pass to their children. 

Four years after they were married, Andy developed 
Alzheimer’s disease. Nancy had to make the difficult decision 
to place Andy in a nursing home because she could no 
longer care for him safely at the ranch. Although they had 
a premarital agreement, all property Nancy and Andy owned 
separately was countable resources in the determination 
of Andy’s eligibility for Medicaid. Andy had $100,000 in 
countable resources in his name only. Nancy had $900,000 
in countable resources in her name only. Their combined 
countable resources for Medicaid eligibility purposes was 
$1 million ($100,000 + $900,000 = $1,000,000). 

Protections for community spouse. In Medicaid jargon 
the spouse who lives outside the nursing home is the community 
spouse. The spouse in the nursing home is the institutionalized 
spouse. In Montana, the community spouse can keep one-half of 
the countable combined resources up to a maximum of $130,380.
However, if resources totaled less than $49,440, then the 
community spouse may keep up to the minimum of $26,076, even 
if the amount is more than one-half of the countable resources.  

These countable resource limits are for the year 2021. They change 
annually according to the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). 

needs allowance. A veteran who receives a pension may keep $90 
plus a $50 personal needs allowance. 

Example 3: Sara and Budd have combined countable 
resources valued at $314,000. If Budd applies for Medicaid, 
Sara gets to keep assets valued up to $130,380. Budd gets to 
keep $2,000. For Medicaid eligibility purposes, Sara cannot 
keep the $181,620 exceeding the maximum of $130,380 
of the couple’s combined countable resources ($314,000 - 
$130,380 - $2,000 = $181,620).

Medicaid considers any of the couple’s countable resources 
valued at more than the asset limitations mentioned previously 
as accessible resources of the institutionalized spouse. An 
institutionalized spouse is eligible to receive Medicaid when 
those resources are less than or equal to $2,000. Resources could 
be “spent down” by paying for nursing home care or by paying 
for home repairs.  

Example 4: Frank and Catherine have combined 
countable resources valued at $300,000. Catherine may 
keep the maximum of $130,380. Frank may keep $2,000. 
Catherine plans to use the remainder of their resources, 
$167,620, to pay for Frank’s medical expenses not covered 
by their health insurance plan and pay off the mortgage on 
their home ($300,000 - $130,380 - $2,000 = $167,620).

Example 5: Carlos and Maria each have children from an 
earlier marriage. Maria has $100,000 in countable resources 
in her name. Carlos has $800,000 in countable resources 
in his name. Maria may keep a maximum of $130,380. 
Carlos may keep $2,000. The rest of both of their combined 
countable resources of $767,620 must be “spent down” to 
$2,000 before Carlos is eligible for Medicaid ($800,000 + 
$100,000 = $900,000 - $130,380 = $767,620).

Income test 

The income test examines the Medicaid applicant’s countable 
income. Countable income includes funds received in the name 
of the Medicaid applicant. Applicants whose monthly nursing 
home costs are greater than their countable monthly income 
meet the income test. 

Examples of countable income include: Social Security 
or other retirement pensions; railroad retirement; Veteran’s 
Administration benefits; lease or rental income; dividends; interest 
earned on savings; trust income; and monthly annuity payments. 
An individual in a nursing home who has income must use 
it to pay for nursing home care. A nursing home resident can 
pay the monthly cost of health insurance out of the income. 
Medicaid allows residents to keep $50 each month as a personal 

Example 6: Bruce has a monthly income of $2,000. He 
can keep $50 each month for personal needs such as shaving 
cream, toothpaste, clothing, and magazines. Bruce’s remaining 
income of $1,950 goes toward his nursing home costs. His 
monthly nursing home bill is $7,670. Medicaid will pay the 
balance of $5,720 each month ($7,670 - $1,950 = $5,720).

Marital income 

All income received solely in the name of the community 
spouse is not considered income of the institutionalized spouse 
and, therefore, is excluded for Medicaid eligibility purposes. Any 
income paid to both spouses is usually equally divided; one-half 
is income to the institutionalized spouse and the remaining half 
is income to the community spouse. 

The community spouse may also qualify for a monthly 
allowance from the income of the institutionalized spouse up to a 
maximum of $3,260 (2021). The allowance is the amount necessary 
for home maintenance costs (rent or mortgage, taxes, insurance, 
and utility charges). If the community spouse has enough income 
to cover these home maintenance costs, no allowance is granted 
from the income of an institutionalized spouse.

Application process for Medicaid 

The application process for Medicaid includes several forms: 
a resource assessment, a pre-screening medical determination, 
and an application for assistance. 

Resource Assessment. When a person enters a nursing home, 
a family member (spouse, adult child) or friend should contact 
the local Office of Public Assistance for a resource assessment 
appointment. Even if the individual does not plan to apply for 
Medicaid, there is a required resource assessment. 

The resource assessment is based on the individual’s financial 
situation on the first day of the month when entering the nursing 
home for a period of more than 30 days. The resource assessment 
is critical, because it determines the amount of a married 
couple’s resources the community spouse may keep, should the 
institutionalized spouse apply for Medicaid.

Pre-screening determination. A pre-screening determines 
if the applicant needs long-term care before Medicaid will pay. 
The screening also specifies whether there is a diagnosis of mental 
illness showing a need for other services. 

Montana contracts with the Mountain-Pacific Quality 
Health Foundation (phone: 800-219-7035) to conduct screening 
determinations.

Application for assistance. An application for Medicaid 
assistance is available from the Office of Public Assistance in any  

3

Montana county. An applicant can also apply online at https://
apply.mt.gov/ or over the phone 1-888-706-1535. 

Eligibility decisions 

DPHHS decides about the eligibility of the applicant within 
45 days of the date of application. Specific instances may occur to 
extend this deadline, such as client’s inability to supply verification 
within the 45-day period, the evaluation of a trust or annuity, or 
an asset transfer requiring more information. 

If the nursing home resident passes the prescreening 
determination, assets and income eligibility tests, Medicaid 
may begin payments to coincide with the date the person entered 
a nursing home. 

An applicant denied Medicaid may request a hearing before a 
hearing officer. The request for a hearing must be in writing within 
90 days of the mailing of the notice of Medicaid determination.

Gifting property 

Some Montanans believe the best protection against depleting 
their assets for long-term care costs is to become “impoverished” 
by giving away all their property, so they qualify for Medicaid. 
Before giving property to others, however, consider the advantages 
and disadvantages of such gifts. Each potential gift has legal, 
emotional, and tax consequences. 

Remember, after assets are gifted to someone else, the assets 
are beyond your control. The friend or family member who 
received the property is under no legal obligation to use the asset 
to support you during the time you need nursing home care. The 
family member could sell or rent out the property or put it to 
another use. In addition, creditors of your family member could 
attach a lien to the property to satisfy the family member’s debts 
or other obligations. In short, unexpected things could happen 
to your gifted property. You could be without enough resources 
if nursing home care did become necessary. 

Look-back rules 

There is a period of Medicaid ineligibility if the applicant 
gifted an asset to others during the look-back period. Any asset 
transfer made on or after February 8, 2006 has a look-back period 
of 5 years dating back from the Medicaid application date.

The period of ineligibility for the Medicaid applicant during 
the look-back period depends on the value and the date of the 
gift. The period of ineligibility is the number of days required to 
spend the value of the transferred assets on nursing home care. The 
Montana average daily cost of nursing home care in Montana is 
$252.18 from July 2020-September 2021. The period of ineligibility 
period is one day for every $252.18 of uncompensated value the 
applicant gave away. 

Example 7: Etta is considering a gift of $15,000 to each 
of her five grandchildren. If Etta applied for Medicaid after 

making the gifts to her grandchildren, she would have a 
period of ineligibility of about 10 months (5 grandchildren 
x $15,000 = $75,000 ÷ $252.18 daily cost of nursing home 
care = 297.41 days ÷ 30 days in a month = 9.91 months). If 
Etta applies for Medicaid, she will need to be sure she has 
the resources to cover her nursing home costs for about 10 
months before Medicaid will begin payment. 

Any transfer after February 8, 2006 within the 5-year look-
back period could result in a period when individuals are not 
only ineligible for Medicaid, but also have no additional assets, 
other than income, to pay for their nursing home care. Transfers 
made before the applicable 5-year look-back period do not affect 
Medicaid eligibility.

Example 8: John gifted his stocks and mutual funds 
worth $195,000 to his grandchildren, adult children, and their 
spouses. If John applied for Medicaid within 5 years of the 
gift, his gifts are subject to the Medicaid eligibility look-back 
rules. John would have a little over 2 years of ineligibility 
for Medicaid ($195,000 amount of gift ÷ $252.18 daily cost 
of nursing home care = 773.26 days ÷ 365 = 2.12 years). 

Excluded transfers. There are three types of transfers under 

Medicaid eligibility rules excluded from the look-back rules: 

•  A home transferred to the community spouse, a child less than 
21 years of age, or an adult child who is blind or permanently 
disabled.

•  A home transferred to a child (regardless of age) if the child 
lived in the home for two years prior to the admission of the 
parent to a nursing home. The child should be prepared to 
send documentation that without the child’s care, the parent 
would have had to move into a nursing home. The parent’s 
attending doctor must confirm in a written statement the care 
by the child delayed the parent’s entry in the nursing home. 
•  A home transferred to a sibling, if the sibling already owns 
an equity interest in it and has lived there for at least a year 
before the sibling entered a nursing home.

Trusts and asset protection 

Promoters claim a trust is the ideal solution for Montanans 
who wish to protect assets from the cost of long-term care. 
Other promoters use a door-to-door approach in rural Montana 
communities to sell living trusts ranging in price from $750 to 
$3,500. They claim if individuals transfer property into a living 
trust, the nursing home or Medicaid cannot take their assets. 
This information is inaccurate. 

A trust is a legal arrangement in which an individual (the 
trustor or settlor) changes the titles of assets into the name of 
a trust. A trustee manages the assets for the beneficiaries listed 

4

in a trust agreement. Beneficiaries named in a trust agreement 
can include the individual who formed the trust, friends, family 
members, a university, a charity, or other organization.

Revocable living trusts 

An individual can create a revocable living trust during 
life and be the trustee. In Montana, unless the trust agreement 
makes the trust irrevocable, it is revocable. Income and assets 
in a living trust are countable resources in a Medicaid eligibility 
determination. Because the trustor/trustee can change the terms 
of a revocable living trust at any time, the funds are a countable 
resource for Medicaid eligibility purposes. 

The trustee is not eligible for Medicaid until the depletion 
of the assets in the living trust to $2,000. For additional 
information request the MontGuide: Revocable Living Trusts 
from your local MSU Extension office or download here: https://
store.msuextension.org/Products/Revocable-Living-Trusts-
MT199612HR__MT199612HR.aspx.

Irrevocable trusts 

The person who sets up an irrevocable trust has no power 
to amend, cancel or remove assets from it. Transfers of assets 
into irrevocable trusts are subject to the 5-year look-back period. 
For Medicaid eligibility purposes, if income from the irrevocable 
trust could benefit the individual applying for Medicaid then it 
is countable income available to the individual. 

Limitations of trusts 

In general, Medicaid considers resources held in trust as 

available to the couple when the: 

•  creation of the trust agreement is by an applicant for Medicaid 

•  applicant, the spouse, or both, are beneficiaries of the trust; 

or by the spouse; 

and 

•  distributions are to the beneficiaries. 

Before forming any type of trust, contact an attorney to 

obtain legal advice. 

Consequences of giving away assets 

Although some Montanans may wish to give assets to 
family members, to a university, or to a charity for the purpose 
of qualifying for Medicaid, there are several personal and emotional 
reasons why they may not want to totally deplete their resources. 
Medicaid patients may be more difficult to place in nursing 
homes than private paying patients. The only space open for a 
Medicaid recipient may be hours away from family and friends. 
Private paying patients can avoid the tedious task of applying for 
Medicaid themselves or by a family member, a time-consuming 
procedure some consider an invasion of privacy. 

Having an older person change from familiar surroundings in a 
private pay single room to a double room because of Medicaid  
qualification can be detrimental to their psychological and social 
well-being. 

Example 9: When John was a private pay resident of the 
nursing home, he had a private room. After all his resources 
became depleted by paying for his care, he became eligible 
for Medicaid. The facility moved John to a double room. 
Because of the activity revolving around his ill roommate, 
John could not sleep. He was angry he did not have privacy 
he enjoyed previously. John continues to ask his children, 
“Why can’t I have a private room like I used to?” He does 
not understand Medicaid will not cover the costs of a private 
room. The small nursing home in John’s community cannot 
afford to take the monetary loss resulting from his placement 
in a private room.  

 

Medicaid lien and estate recovery program 

Federal law requires each state to develop a Medicaid estate 
recovery program to recoup the costs of nursing home care and 
other medical services from the estates of recipients who have 
died. In Montana, Medicaid makes a creditor’s claim during the 
probate process. The personal representative or attorney overseeing 
the estate will use the proceeds from the sale of estate property 
to repay the Medicaid program for medical expenses paid on 
the decedent’s behalf. 

Example 10: Robert, a widower, left his only property, a 
home valued at $75,000 to his son. At the time of his death, 
Medicaid had supplied $24,000 for Robert’s medical and 
nursing home care. In  addition to this claim, there was a 
$10,000 funeral bill and $3,000 expenses for probating his 
estate. Robert’s son received $38,000 ($75,000 - $24,000 - 
$10,000 - $3,000 = $38,000). 

If a spouse, a child under the age of 21, or a blind or disabled 
child survives a Medicaid recipient, there is no estate recovery. 
After Medicaid files a claim, individuals affected by the proposed 
estate recovery have a right to apply for a hardship waiver. 

Montana has also adopted Medicaid cost recovery procedures 
to take place while the recipient is living. The state wants to secure 
its right to recover assets a recipient kept while receiving Medicaid. 
Montana  secures  this  right  by  filing  liens  on  rea l 
property owned by Medicaid recipients who are “permanently 
institutionalized” in a nursing home facility. The lien is the 
amount of Medicaid payments made on behalf of the person 
receiving care. Before the property sells or transfers to heirs the 
owner must pay the lien.

Example 11: Before Millie went into a nursing home, 
she lived alone. She qualified to receive Medicaid payments 
for her nursing home care. Later a medical determination said 
she could not return to her home. The Montana Medicaid

Estate Recovery Program placed a lien on her home. A year 
later the home sold for $79,000. 

During this time Medicaid paid $81,828 for Millie’s 
care. At the time of the sale, part ($79,000) of the state’s 
$81,828 lien was satisfied by the sale proceeds. Because 
the lien was for an amount greater than the sale proceeds, 
no money remained from the sale of Millie’s home for her 
personal use or for her to leave to heirs.
