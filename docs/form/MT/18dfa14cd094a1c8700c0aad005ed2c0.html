      <pre>* * * WARNING* * *  

The following information is not legal advice.  This 
information is not being provided on behalf of the 
Montana Courts or any particular Judge.  The Judge in 
your case may require you to change a form or to 
submit a different one, and you always must follow the 
Local Rules for the Court where your case is pending.  
If you have questions about Local Rules, you should 
contact the local Clerk of Court or the State Law Library 
Reference Librarian.  If you need help filling out your 
forms or other legal advice, you are strongly urged to 
contact an attorney.  

 
bout Motions 

A Motion is the name of a document that you must file to ask a Judge to make a 
ruling or to take some other action for you once you have started a lawsuit.  A Motion 
does not start a lawsuit.  To start a lawsuit, you need to file a Complaint or, in certain 
family law cases like divorce and parenting plan cases, a Petition.  There are only two 
acceptable ways to communicate with the Judge about your lawsuit once it is started: 
 

In writing by filing a Motion or responding to a Motion; or  

In person at a hearing scheduled by the Judge, with both sides present. 

Because both sides must have an opportunity to speak and let the Judge know 

how they feel about an issue, you MUST provide a copy of all of the paperwork that you 
file in Court to the opposing party(ies) by either 1st class mail or hand delivery.  See 
Montana Rule of Civil Procedure 5 for more information.  Common types of Motions 
include: 
 

Motion to Dismiss:  This asks the court to throw out a lawsuit filed against 
you.  See Montana Rule of Civil Procedure 12 for more information. 

Motion for a Continuance:  This asks the Court to postpone a deadline, 
such as a hearing date or when a certain paper must be filed in Court.   

Motion for an Interim Order:  Asks the Court to enter an Order that will last 
only until the Judge has a chance to make a final decision on your case (in 
other words, an Order that will last throughout the lawsuit but not after it is 
over).   

Motion for Expedited Consideration: This asks the Court to speed up the 
process and to decide an issue (usually another Motion) on a faster 
schedule than normal.  Motions for Expedited Consideration are not 
usually granted and should be used only when a true emergency exists.  
See Frequently Asked Questions below for more information.

When you file a MOTION, you start a three-step process known as Motion 
Practice.  See Montana Rule of Civil Procedure 7(b) and Montana Uniform District Court 
Rule 2.   The person who wants the Court to grant the Motion and issue an Order will 
follow the steps #1 and #3 in this motion packet.  The person who does not want the 
Court to enter the Order will follow step #2.   

tep #1:  Filing a Motion  

  S

 

To begin the process, you must fill out three forms:  a Motion, an Affidavit, and 

a proposed Order.   

*NOTE:  After you file your Motion, Affidavit, and proposed Order with the Clerk of Court, if the 
other party files a RESPONSE (as defined in Step #2) you are responsible for filing a REQUEST 
FOR  CONTESTED  HEARING.    If  the  other  party  does  not  file  a  RESPONSE,  you  will  file  a 
REQUEST FOR UNCONTESTED HEARING.  Filing the Request for Hearing is what will move 
your motion forward to be heard by the Court.  Specific information about the Request for Hearing 
is contained below.*** 

ll SIX of the following described forms are included for you in this packet.  
Information regarding the process of filing them is contained on the following page 
under Motion Instructions. 
 

The MOTION tells the Judge what you want and why you should get it.  
Be sure to tell the Judge all the important facts and to make any argument 
that helps to support your request for an order.  You should tell the Judge 
what law or laws your Motion is based on.  If you are unsure of the law, 
you should contact the Reference Librarian at the State Law Library for 
help finding the law that applies to your Motion.  You will also tell the 
Judge what other documents are attached to the Motion and whether you 
want the Court to hold a hearing on the Motion.   

The AFFIDAVIT is a statement signed by you which must be filed 
simultaneously with your Motion.  You will be declaring under penalty of 
perjury that all matters contained in your statement are true and correct.  
This statement is where you tell the Judge all of the important and relevant 
facts in support of your Motion.  An Affidavit is a form of evidence that the 
Court can consider when making decisions, just like live testimony in 
Court and exhibits.  Your Affidavit must include only the facts that you 
know from personal experience.   

The proposed ORDER is the document that you are asking the Judge to 
sign.  It tells anyone who reads it exactly what the Judge has ordered in 
very simple, clear terms.  It should be short and to the point.  Basically, 
you act like the Judge’s secretary – you draft an Order for the Judge to 
sign so that the Judge does not need to write one.  However, the Judge 
may not like the Order that you have written and as a result the Judge 
may change your Order or sign a different Order altogether.  You MUST 
submit stamped, self-addressed envelopes for all parties (including 
yourself) along with your proposed Order.

If the other party files a RESPONSE  to your Motion,  you have the option 
of filing a REPLY TO RESPONSE TO MOTION.  This is your opportunity 
to respond to the opposing party’s response to your Motion.    

The REQUEST FOR CONTESTED HEARING or a REQUEST FOR 
UNCONTESTED HEARING is necessary to move your MOTION forward 
to be heard by the Judge and to obtain a Court Order.  As the party who 
filed the Motion, it is your responsibility to file the Request for Hearing.  If 
the opposing party does not file a Response, the matter is uncontested.  If 
the opposing party files a Response, the matter is contested.  

A proposed ORDER must also be submitted along with your Request for 
Contested/Uncontested Hearing. It must be submitted with self-addressed, 
stamped envelopes to all parties in your case.

o  You will complete and file the original Motion, the original Affidavit, and the 
original proposed Order with the Clerk of Court.  However, before filing the 
originals you will need to make copies for all parties, including yourself.  
Submit the originals to the Clerk of Court.  On the same day you must mail 
or hand-deliver copies of all filed documents to all other parties in your 
case (as you indicate in the Certificate of Service).  The proposed 
Order and all copies of the proposed Order (along with self-addressed 
stamped envelopes) will be kept by the Court.  
 

o  From  that point you will simply wait.  If you hand deliver the Motion and 
Affidavit to the opposing party, they will have 14 days to respond to your 
Motion and in their RESPONSE tell the Judge their side of the story.  If 
you mailed your Motion and Affidavit to the opposing party, they will have 
an extra 3 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays) to respond – 
or in other words 17 days.    See “HOW TO CALCULATE TIME” in Step 
#2 below.  

If the other party files a RESPONSE to your Motion go to Step #3.  If the 
other party does not file a Response within the time frame as calculated 
above, you will need to immediately file the Request for Uncontested 
Hearing and the proposed Order setting the hearing (along with self-
addressed, stamped envelopes for all parties). 

If you receive an Order scheduling a Contested or Uncontested Hearing, 
be certain to note the date and time on your calendar as the Judge will 
expect you to appear and provide testimony.  If you fail to appear on the 
date and time set for the hearing, the Judge may dismiss your MOTION or 
enter an Order in favor of the opposing party.

tep #2:  Responding to a Motion 

If you receive a Motion from an opposing party, you have the right to respond 
and tell the Judge whether you agree or disagree with the other side’s Motion.  If you 
disagree, you must file a RESPONSE TO MOTION within a specific period of time.  If 
you do not respond to a Motion on time, the Court may take that to mean that you 
agree with the Motion. 
 

How to calculate time:  See also Montana Rule of Civil Procedure 6(a) 

o 

o 

If the Motion was hand-delivered to you, count the following day as day 
one and you have up to and including the 14th day to file your 
Response.  Example: if you were hand-delivered a Motion on Tuesday, 
October 1, 2013, begin counting October 2nd as day 1 and forward 14 
days.  Your Response is due by 5:00 p.m. on October 15th.  If the date 
your Response is due falls on a weekend or a Court holiday, you still 
have until the next business day to file your Response.  
 
If the Motion was mailed to you, you have 17 days to respond (3 extra 
days for mailing).  Count the day following the date on the Certificate of 
Service as day 1 and forward and you have up to and including the 
17th day to file your Response.  Example:  the Certificate of Mailing 
states that the Motion was mailed to you on October 1, 2013.   Begin 
counting October 2nd as day 1 and your Response is due by 5:00 p.m. 
on October 18th.    If the date your Response is due falls on a weekend 
or a Court holiday, you still have until the next business day to file your 
Response.     

Note:  the counting method and deadlines above may be different if you are filing 
something other than the documents discussed herein. 

o properly respond to a Motion, you will fill out the following forms:  a 
RESPONSE TO MOTION and an AFFIDAVIT.  Both of those forms are provided in this 
packet. 
 

The RESPONSE TO MOTION tells the Judge what you disagree with in 
the other side’s Motion, Affidavit, and proposed Order; what you would like 
the Court to do instead; and why you should get what you want.  Be sure 
to tell the Judge all of the important and relevant facts and to make any 
argument that helps to support your position.  You should tell the Judge 
what law or laws your Response is based on.  If you are unsure of the law, 
you should contact the Reference Librarian at the State Law Library for 
help finding the law that applies to your Motion.  You will also tell the 
Judge what other documents are attached to your Response.

o  You will complete and file the original Response to Motion and the original 
Affidavit with the Clerk of Court.  HOWEVER, before filing the originals 
you will make copies for all parties, including yourself.  Submit the 
originals to the Clerk of Court.  On the same day you must mail or hand-
deliver copies of all filed documents to all other parties in your case (as 
indicated in the Certificate of Service).   
 

o  From that point you simply wait.  The opposing party has 14 days to 

REPLY to your Response from the date you hand delivered it to them, or 
17 days from the date you mailed your Response to them.  See “How to 
Calculate Time” above.   

o  The other party may file a REPLY or they may simply file a REQUEST 

FOR CONTESTED HEARING.   In either event, you will receive copies of 
those documents from the other party.  If you receive an Order scheduling  
a contested hearing, be certain to note the date and time on your calendar 
as the Judge will be expecting you to appear at the hearing and present 
your side.  If you fail to appear, the Judge may enter an Order without 
hearing your testimony.  

The AFFIDAVIT is a statement signed by you which must be filed along 
with your Response.  You will be declaring under penalty of perjury that all 
matters contained in your statement are true and correct.  This statement 
is where you tell the Judge all of the important and relevant facts in 
support of your Response.  An Affidavit is a form of evidence that the 
Court can consider when making decisions, just like live testimony in 
Court and exhibits.  Your Affidavit must include only the facts that you 
know from personal experience.

o 

If the other party fails to file a Reply or a Request for Contested Hearing 
within the time allowed frame, you may file a REQUEST FOR 
CONTESTED HEARING to move the matter forward and be heard by the 
Judge.  The party who files the Request for Contested Hearing must also 
submit a proposed Order and stamped, self-addressed envelopes for all 
parties (including yourself) along with your Request for Contested 
Hearing.

Step #3:  Replying to the Response & Filing a Request 
for Contested Hearing 

f you are the party that filed the Motion, you can file a Reply to the Response to 

Motion if you think it is necessary.  Your Reply must be filed within 14 days if the 
Response was hand delivered to you or within 17 days if the Response was mailed to 
you.  See above “HOW TO CALCULATE TIME” if you have questions.     

 Reply is not required – HOWEVER YOU MUST AT THIS TIME FILE THE 

REQUEST FOR CONTESTED HEARING if the other party has not already done so.  

EPLY INSTRUCTIONS: 

o  A Reply cannot raise new facts that were not previously discussed by one 
of the parties, and you cannot file another Affidavit in support of your 
Motion. 

o  The Reply should contain only your response to the arguments raised by 
the opposing party in his/her Response and should not contain completely 
new arguments.   
 

o  You must serve a copy of the Reply on the opposing party (or his/her 

attorney if the other side has one). 

o  You must file the Request for Contested Hearing and the proposed Order 
(along with self-addressed, stamped envelopes for all parties) at this time.  
If you fail to file the Request for Contested Hearing, your case may not 
move forward.  A copy of the Request for Contested Hearing must be 
served on the opposing party (or his or her attorney).           

Frequently Asked Questions about Motion Practice  
 

1)  When will the Judge decide my Motion? 

here are many factors that affect how long a decision takes, including how 

complicated the Motion is and how busy the Judge’s schedule is.   
 

If the deadline for filing the Response passes and no Response is 
filed, the Court will decide the Motion at that time.  

If a Response is filed on time, the Court will wait until after the 
deadline for filing a Reply passes before scheduling the Contested 
Hearing or ruling.   

o  Usually a decision will be issued within a few weeks, or the Court 
will schedule a Contested Hearing. In that case, there will be no

decision until after the hearing.  It may take several weeks to get a 
hearing set on the Court’s calendar.  The Judge may issue a 
decision orally from the bench during your hearing or the Judge 
may take the matter under advisement and issue a decision in 
writing later.  Again, it may take weeks or even months for a written 
decision to be issued. 

2)  What if there is an emergency and I need my 

Motion decided right away? 
 

If a true emergency exists, you can file a Motion for Expedited Consideration of 
your Motion.  If the Judge grants your Motion for Expedited Consideration, it will speed 
up the process; it does NOT prevent the other side from having a chance to tell his/her 
side of the story, however.  Keep in mind that these Motions are rarely granted and you 
must have a very good reason to file one.  Special rules may apply to these Motions for 
Expedited Consideration.  Before you fill out this type of Motion, you should contact the 
local Clerk of Court for assistance or the State Law Library Reference Librarian for a 
copy of the Local Rules that apply where your case is filed.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
