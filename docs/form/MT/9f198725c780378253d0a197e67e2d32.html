      <pre>How do I get a divorce? 

What about legal separation? 

How do I start a dissolution? 

First, you must file a petition for 
dissolution with the Clerk of the District 
Court. You can find the Clerk of Court’s 
office at the local county courthouse. You 
must have the petition and a summons 
officially delivered (served) to your 
spouse. The petition tells the court and 
your spouse what you are asking for in 
the dissolution. Depending on your case, 
you may need to file other forms. These 
must then be served on your spouse.  
 

Is there a fee to file for 
dissolution? 

Yes. The court charges fees to file the 
petition. The court also charges a fee 
when the dissolution decree is issued.  
For more information about the court 
fees, you should contact your local Clerk 
of District Court. There may also be costs 
to serve the petition on your spouse. If 
you cannot afford to pay the fees and 
costs, you can ask the judge to excuse 
you from paying them.  
 

How long will my dissolution 
take? 
If you and your spouse both agree on the 
terms, it can go fairly quickly. The 
dissolution may be finalized 20 days after 
the other spouse is served with the 
dissolution papers.  But if the parties don’t 
agree, it can take much longer. 

If you don’t want a dissolution, you could 
get a legal separation. If you get a 
separation, you will still be legally 
married. Still, the judge makes the same 
kinds of decisions as in a dissolution. 

ou cannot get married to another person 
until you get a dissolution. Either side can 
ask for the separation to be changed to a 
dissolution. This can’t happen until six 
months after the court says you are 
officially separated.  
 

What about having the marriage 
declared invalid? 

  Y

A judge can void a marriage. This is also 
called an annulment. An annulment says 
that the marriage never existed. The 
judge may call this a, “declaration of 
invalidity.” You need to meet certain 
conditions to do this. 
Some examples of when you can annul 
are: 
• 

If one spouse was too young to 
marry 
If one spouse is married to 
someone else 
If the spouses are related by blood 

• 

• 

here are other reasons you can get an 

annulment, too.  
 

  T

In Montana, the legal name for divorce is 
dissolution.  The court can give you a 
dissolution even if your spouse does not 
want one.  Before you can do this, you 
must be sure that: 
•  You are legally married. This includes 

common law marriage. 

•  The one who wants the dissolution 
must have lived in Montana for at 
least 90 days before filing for 
dissolution. 
If you have children from the 
marriage, usually they must have lived 
in Montana for six months. 

• 

•  One spouse must believe that the 

marriage cannot be fixed. 

What does a dissolution solve? 

In a dissolution, the judge will end the 
marriage. The judge will also:  
•  Divide the property and debts of the 

two sides 

•  Order any alimony (spousal support) 

or child support 

•  Change the name of the wife, if she 

asks for it to be changed 

•  Decide living arrangements and 

support for the children

access to justice.

You do not need a lawyer to get a 
dissolution. But a lawyer can help protect 
your rights. This is very important if you 
and your spouse disagree on the terms of 
the dissolution. You may also have rights 
that you do not know about. You could 
lose these if you do not get expert advice. 

f you and your spouse agree on all 
issues, you may get a dissolution fairly 
easily without a lawyer. 
These next two actions may help you: 
  
Summary dissolution proceedings 
This action is for people who agree on the 
terms of the dissolution. This process is 
good for people who do not have 
children. It can also work for people who 
do have children, but you and your 
spouse need to already agree on 
parenting arrangements. You must also 
have a child support order. Both sides 
must have a low income. You need to 
already know how to divide your money, 
property, and debts.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
