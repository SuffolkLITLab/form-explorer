      <pre>Settling an Estate: What 
Do I Need To Know?

by Joel Schumacher, M.S. Associate Specialist, and Marsha Goetting, 
Ph.D., CFP®, CFCS, Professor and Extension Family Economics Specialist

This MontGuide is designed to help survivors start the process of settling an 
estate and ease the burden following the death of a loved one. It discusses 
tasks in the order they are commonly completed.  The order presented is 
not necessarily the correct order for every estate because each estate is 
different.

MontGuide

 MT201004HR Revised 2/17

John, a single father of three, had a heart attack and died at the 
age of 68. His children were shocked by John’s passing. A couple 
of days after John’s death the funeral director made a comment 
to John’s daughter about seeing John riding his horse each 
morning. John’s daughter quickly realized with all the tasks that 
had consumed her time she hadn’t checked on John’s horse in 
days. She immediately went to the pasture and was dismayed to 
see that the tank was out of water. The horse survived but John’s 
daughter felt terrible and wondered if she was forgetting other 
important tasks.

MOST OF US ARE NOT EXPERTS AT WHAT NEEDS 
to be done after a loved one passes away. However, at some 
point in our lives many of us will find ourselves faced with 
settling an estate for a family member or friend. Many 
people think that if the decedent left a will or a trust then 
the process for settling their estate will be simple and easy. 
But often overlooked in legal documents are the many 
decisions that need to be made in the first few days after a 
death and also many of the minor tasks (such as canceling 
magazine subscriptions and forwarding mail) that may need 
to be completed. 

This MontGuide is designed to help survivors start the 
process of settling an estate and ease the burden following 
the death of a loved one. Some tasks are time sensitive, 
such as ensuring that a pet is cared for in the days following 
a pet owner’s death. Other tasks, such as distributing the 
decedent’s IRA, are less urgent. This MontGuide discusses 
tasks in the order they are commonly completed. The order 
presented is not necessarily the correct order for every estate 
because each estate is different. 

The First Few Days
The first few days after the death of a loved one should be 
devoted to tasks that are time sensitive. The first task is 
to arrange for the care of the survivor’s children, spouse, 
pets and livestock. These arrangements do not have to be 
permanent but temporary care may be needed immediately.

After the survivors’ immediate needs have been met, then 
someone will need to search for any final instructions left by 
the decedent. Did he or she leave a letter of last instructions, 
a will, a funeral or burial contract, funeral or memorial 
instructions? For further information read MSU Extension 
MontGuide Letter of Last Instructions (MT198904HR). 

These documents are commonly stored in a safe deposit 

box, in a ‘special’ place in the home or with a friend or 
relative. The attorney or funeral director that helped draft 
these documents may also have copies. Although these 
documents often contain information about many issues, 
only the information relevant to the memorial service, 
funeral arrangements, and other immediate concerns are 
important during the first few days.

If final instructions cannot be found, surviving family 

members are faced with making arrangements for the 
memorial service or funeral and burial based on their best 
judgment of what the decedent would have wanted.

Below is a list of tasks that may need to be completed in 

the first days following the death of family members.
 Children: Are there children that need to be cared for?

 Spouse: Is there an incapacitated spouse (Alzheimer’s, 

dementia, etc.) that needs care?

 Other Dependants: Are there other dependants who now 

need immediate care?

 Pets and Livestock: Was the decedent responsible for caring 

for any animals?

 Final Instructions: Did the decedent leave a will, trust, 

funeral or burial contract, letter of last instruction? If yes, 
where are these documents located?

 Memorial Service and Burial Plans: Did the decedent leave 
any memorial service plans, a funeral trust or a funeral 
insurance contract? 

 Death Notification: Are there out-of-town friends or 
relatives that should be notified so they can attend 
services? What newspapers should print the obituary?

Beneficiary: A person (or legal entity) who is entitled 
to the benefit of a trust, proceeds of retirement funds, 
insurance policy, payable on death account or transfer on 
death registration upon the owner’s death.
Decedent: A deceased person.
Devisee:  A person or entity designated in the decedent’s 
will to receive property passing under the decedent’s will.
Estate: A term used to describe all of a person’s 
possessions. An estate includes both probate and non-
probate assets (real estate, personal property, financial 
accounts, etc.) and debts (credit cards, loans, phone bill, 
etc.) owed to others.
Estate Administration: The process, including probate, of 
the personal representative gathering all the property of 
someone who died, paying all just debts and taxes, and 
distributing the balance to the devisees designated in the 
will or the heirs as prescribed by the legislature where 
there is no will or if the will is declared invalid by the 
district court.
Personal Representative: A person nominated in a will 
and then appointed by the district court to administer 
the estate of a decedent. Personal representatives were 
formerly referred to as executors or administrators. 
Probate: A judicial proceeding to determine if the 
decedent had a valid legal will, to appoint a personal 
representative to administer the estate, and to determine 
the creditors, devisees, or heirs who are entitled to the 
decedent’s property. 

After the Funeral
The process of settling the decedent’s estate can proceed after 
the immediate needs of the survivors have been met and 
after the funeral. State and federal laws play an important 
role in what needs to be done to legally settle an estate. 
These rules and regulations not only determine the steps 
and paperwork required, but also who is responsible for the 
variety of tasks that need to be accomplished.

Who is responsible for settling an 
estate?
When an individual dies, with or without a will, Montana 
law provides legal procedures for settling his or her estate. If 
probate is required, the process takes place under jurisdiction 
of the district court in the county where the decedent was 
considered as a resident.

A probate may not be required, however, if all of the 
decedent’s property was owned as a joint tenant with right 
of survivorship with another person, in a revocable living 
trust, or designated to pass to survivors according to some 
non-probate transfer mechanism such as a payable-on-death 
designation, a transfer on death registration, a beneficiary 
deed, or a life insurance beneficiary designation. For more 
information refer to the MSU Extension MontGuide, 
Probate in Montana (MT199006HR). 

2

If probate is required, the personal representative is 
responsible for most estate settlement tasks. The personal 
representative is often a family member or friend but can be 
an employee of a bank or other corporate entity. Typically, a 
personal representative is nominated in a will and appointed 
by the district court. If no personal representative was 
nominated in a will or if a person died without a valid will, 
then the district court will appoint one based on the priority 
list provided by Montana law. For more information refer 
to the MSU Extension MontGuide Personal Representative 
Responsibilities. (MT199008HR).

After the Second Week and Beyond
After one or two weeks have passed the personal 
representative should arrange for the decedent’s mail 
to be forwarded and start gathering information and 
notifying people (and companies) that did business with 
the decedent of the death. A decedent who planned ahead 
and communicated information to family members makes 
the process much easier for the survivors. Important papers 
should be located, such as:
•  Birth Certificate (for the decedent and any minor 

children)

•  Marriage Certificate (if applicable)

•  Divorce Decrees (if applicable)

or more is common)

•  Social Security Card (or number)

•  Military Discharge Papers

•  Death Certificate(s) (multiple copies should be obtained 6 

•  Union or Professional Membership Information

•  Will or Trust Document

•  Copy of Recent State and Federal Income Tax Returns

•  List of Business Contacts: 

-  Certified Public Accountant
-  Attorney
-  Investment Advisor
-  Current and Past Employers

•  List of Accounts and Assets (and contact information for 

each):
-  Checking and Savings Accounts
-  Credit Card Accounts 
-  Investment Accounts
-  Loan Accounts
-  Retirement Accounts
-  Insurance Policies (Auto, Home, Health, Disability  

 

        and Life)

-  Stock or Bond Certificates

-  Certificates of Deposit
-  U.S. Savings Bonds
-  Cooperatives that pay dividends (rural electric,  

        phone, etc.)
-  Real Estate
-  Vehicles
-  Personal Assets (art, coins, major household items,  

        jewelry)

•  Other Important Items:

-  Utility Company Accounts (phone, cable, power,  

        gas, water, sewer, garbage, internet)

-  Periodical Subscriptions (magazines, newspapers)
-  Safe Deposit Box (location and contents)

 

 

 

Estate Overview
Compiling this information creates an overview of the 
estate’s assets and liabilities, size and complexity. The 
personal representative can then identify tasks that he or she 
is capable of handling and those that will require professional 
assistance (a certified public accountant, attorney or others).  
After the various tasks have been assigned, appropriate 

financial institutions should be notified of the death. In 
many cases they can provide information about the necessary 
steps to freeze, transfer, re-title or close the decedent’s 
accounts including whether a probate will be necessary to 
transfer the property.

Additional information about this process can be found 

in the MSU Extension MontGuide Accessing a Deceased 
Person’s Financial Accounts (MT200301HR). Insurance 
companies can provide information 
about the process of claiming 
benefits that beneficiaries are 
entitled to receive. 

Completed First Week

The Social Security Administration (SSA) should be notified 

because payments to the deceased recipient will need to be 
stopped and a determination of what benefits survivors are 
entitled to receive must be completed. For more information 
about the Social Security benefits visit www.ssa.gov.

The personal representative will need to determine the tax 
status of the estate (this may involve an attorney or certified 
public accountant) during the settlement process. There is 
no Montana state inheritance or estate tax. No federal estate 
taxes are due if the estate’s value is less than the applicable 
threshold ($5.49 million in 2017). For more information 
on estate taxes refer to MSU Extension MontGuide Federal 
Estate Tax (MT199104HR). 

The personal representative also needs to distribute the 
estate’s assets to the beneficiaries named in the will, POD 
or TOD. If no beneficiaries are named, then Montana law 
determines who receives the decedent’s assets. For more 
information refer to the MSU Extension MontGuide Dying 
Without a Will in Montana: Who Receives Your Property 
(MT198908HR). An interactive website illustrating how 
a deceased person's estate is distributed when a Montanan 
passes away without a will is at www.montana.edu/
dyingwithoutawill.

Summary
The process of settling an estate can be a time consuming 
and complex process. Planning and communication by the 
decedent before his or her death can simplify the process 
for the survivors, but even if little or no planning has taken 
place someone must take action to assure that the decedent’s 

Checklist of estate settlement tasks

other professional organization. 

Current and past employers may 
also be able to provide information
