TEP TWO: File Documents.   

Court documents for a Notice of Intent to Move are filed at the Clerk of 
District Court office in the county where your parenting plan was ordered. 
After filling out the appropriate forms, make two sets of copies (three sets of 
forms total) of the form. Take all of the copies with you to the Clerk of District 
Court office.     

he original set of forms will be kept by the Clerk of Court. One copy you will 
keep in a safe place, and you will serve the other copy on the other parent in 
Step Three. 

ere is a list of the forms you need to bring to the Clerk of District Court to 

file a Notice of Intent to Move: 

Notice of Intent to Move - MP 904 
Proposed Amended Parenting Plan - MP 300 
Request for Sheriff to Serve Documents - MP 401 (The original of this 
document will be given back to you for Step Three.) 

There is a charge for filing a Notice of Intent to Move in Montana. If you did 
not file an “Affidavit of Inability to Pay Filing Fee” when you filed your original 
Petition or Response, you may have to pay a fee to file your Notice of Intent 
to Move.    If you have financial hardship and cannot afford to pay the court, 
you may fill out a form titled “Affidavit of Inability to Pay Filing Fee,” available 
at http://courts.mt.gov/library and at www.MontanaLawHelp.org or by calling 
or visiting your local Self Help Law Center.

STEP THREE: Serve your Spouse.     
A.  Serving your Spouse. 
You must serve your Spouse with the following documents by one of the four 
options described below: 

Notice of Intent to Move - MP 904   

ND copies of the following document that you filed with the Court in Step One: 

Proposed Amended Parenting Plan - MP 300 

ou may serve your Spouse by one of two methods: (1) Service by Sheriff, or (2). By 
Certified Mail.    You must also serve your Spouses attorney of record if there is one.    The 
method of service most appropriate depends on the details of your case and your 
relationship. 

OTE:    The law requires you to serve the other parent at least 30 days before you intend 

to move.    You can find this law at MCA § 40-4-217 

OPTION #1: Service by the Sheriff. 

Service by Sheriff is accomplished by delivering or mailing to the Sheriff in the 
county where your Spouse resides:   

1. 

Copies of all documents listed above,   

2. 
Original and Copy of the Request for Sheriff to Serve Documents - 
MP 401. The original was given back to you after approved by the Clerk of 
District Court in Step Two.   

he Sheriff’s Department usually charges a fee for service of process. If you have 
an “Affidavit of Inability to Pay your Filing Fee” approved by the Court, the Sheriff 
may waive the service fee.   

PTION #2: By Certified Mail 

ervice by Certified Mail is accomplished by sending the other parent via Certified, 

Return Receipt mail: 
1. 

Copies of all documents listed above.   

TEP FOUR: Wait and work towards a resolution. 

After you’re the other parent is served, they have 21 days to respond or object to the 
Proposed Parenting Plan. If the other parent disagrees with any part of your Proposed 
Parenting Plan they may file their own Proposed Parenting Plan.    At that time, you can 
decide whether there is any room for agreement on some or all of your proposals.

EDIATION: If you do not agree, but you think you could come to some 

agreement, you may choose go to mediation. Some courts require litigants to go to 
mediation before setting a hearing to finalize the case. Mediation is a process 
where a neutral facilitator (called a “mediator”) helps both people come up with a 
shared solution. Mediation is confidential and agreements made in mediation will 
only be filed in Court when both you and your Spouse agree. Mediation can be a 
cost effective way to find a compromise and speed up the dissolution process. 

  M

f, at any time, you change your mind, you may “amend” your proposal by filing a motion 
and a new version of your proposal. The other parent will have additional time to respond 
to new proposals. If you come to an agreement, you can file a Notice of Agreement - MP 
612 with the Court, along with the proposed agreement in writing. 

fter the Court receives your Notice of Intent to Move and any objections or Responses 
the court may choose to hold a hearing.    When the court reaches a decision it will issue 
an Order.    You should provide the court with a copy of form MP 300 that you have filled 
out for the judge to sign.    This form should be filled out just like the proposed parenting 
plan you filed with the court.    It is a good idea to provide the court with a self addressed 
stamped envelope so that they can mail you a copy of the parenting plan after the judge 
signs it.
