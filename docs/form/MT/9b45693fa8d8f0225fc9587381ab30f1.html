      <pre>Giving Your Tenant Post-Move Out Notice of 
Additional Cleaning 

Note: Use these instructions and form letter to write a letter to the tenant.  In 
the letter you will tell the tenant that additional cleaning must be done. 

These instructions and form letter may not be right for your case. They cannot 
take the place of advice from a lawyer. Talk to a lawyer if you have any
questions.

Do not change this form letter.  If you change the form letter, you might lose 
language you need.  

The tenant is not responsible for normal wear to the rental or cyclical 
maintenance performed by you.  Deducting amounts from the tenant’s security 
deposit for these tasks may violate the Montana Residential Tenants’ Security 
Deposits Act. 

What form will I need? 

You  only  need  one  form.    The  form  is  the  form  letter  that  follows  these 

instructions.  The form letter starts on page 7 of this packet.

Who can use the form letter? 

 

You can use the form letter if the tenant: 

(cid:120)  Has moved out of your rental property; AND 

(cid:120) Has left cleaning tasks undone that are not 

part  of  normal  wear  to  the  rental  or  part  of 

your cyclical maintenance responsibility.

What steps do I need to take to deduct cleaning expenses from 

the security deposit? 

1.  Inspect the rental after the tenant vacated it.

2.  Give the tenant a written notice telling the tenant what additional cleaning 

needs  to  be  done.    In  the  notice,  say  the  tenant  has  24  hours  to  do  the

cleaning,  or  you  will  deduct  the  costs  of  the  additional  cleaning  from  the 

tenant’s  security  deposit.    You  can  use  the  form  letter  after  these 

instructions as the written notice. 

3.  Give  the  tenant  24  hours  after  receiving  the  notice  to  do  the  required 

cleaning.  The 24 hours begins either when you hand-deliver the notice to 

the tenant or 3 days after you mail the notice.

If the tenant does not do the cleaning within 24 hours, you can deduct from the 

tenant’s  security  deposit.    You  can  deduct  the  actual  cleaning  expenses, 

including a reasonable charge for your labor if you do the cleaning yourself. 

Note:  You do not have to send the tenant a notice of additional cleaning if the 

tenant did not tell you he or she planned to move out.  In this situation, you can 

deduct actual cleaning charges from the tenant’s security deposit without giving a 

24-hour notice of additional cleaning. 

What  cleaning  expenses  may  I  NOT  deduct  from  the  tenant’s 

security deposit?  

You may NOT deduct from the tenant’s security deposit for: 

(cid:91) Normal maintenance performed on a cyclical basis;  

OR

(cid:91) Normal wear to the rental. 

What cleaning expenses MAY I deduct from the tenant’s security 

deposit?

You MAY deduct from the tenant’s security deposit for: 

Any maintenance you have to do because the tenant was 

(cid:59)

(cid:59)

negligent;

AND

The actual and necessary cost of cleaning you do based

on  the  tenant’s  failure  to  bring  the  rental  to  the  condition  it 

was in when the tenant first rented it.  You cannot deduct for 

normal wear to the rental.

How do I use the form letter? 

1 

Complete the form letter and sign it 

Check the box that applies to your situation.

Make  sure  all  of  the  blanks  on  the  form  letter  are  filled  in 

completely.

Sign the form letter on the line that says “(sign your name).”

2 

Make a copy 

Make  one  copy  of  the  completed  and  signed  letter  for  yourself.  

Keep the copy in a safe place.  It may be important if you have to 

go to court. 

3

Deliver the letter to the tenant    

You  have  two  choices  in  how  to  send  the  letter  to  the 

tenant:

Hand-deliver the letter to the tenant.  If you choose this option, you 

must actually hand the letter to the tenant in person. The law does 

not  allow  you  to  tape  it  to  the  door  to  the  rental,  to  leave  it  with  a 

child or other person at the rental, or to leave it inside the rental.  It 

is a good idea to bring two copies of the letter.  If possible, ask the 

tenant to sign and date one copy of the letter as “received.”  Keep 

that  copy  as  proof  that  the  tenant  got  your  letter,  and  give  the 

tenant the second copy.  In case the tenant will not sign the letter, it 

is a good idea to bring someone with you when you hand-deliver it.  

That person can testify in court later if the tenant denies receiving

Association.  Use of this form is restricted to not-for-profit purposes.  Last updated 09/22/2009 

your letter.  If you choose this option, the tenant has 24 hours after 

you hand the letter to the tenant to do the cleaning.  For example, if 

you  hand-deliver  a  letter  on  April  2,  the  tenant  is  not  required  to 

complete the cleaning until April 3.

OR

Mail the letter to the tenant.  It is a good idea to mail the letter by 

first-class  mail  with  a  Certificate  of  Mailing.    The  post  office  will 

charge  you  more  for  the  Certificate  of  Mailing,  but  it  is  worth  it.  

Keep the Certificate of Mailing receipt.  That is your proof that you 

sent the letter.  With a Certificate of Mailing, the tenant will not have 

to  sign  anything  to  get  your  letter.    The  tenant  cannot  refuse 

delivery.    If  you  choose  this  option,  the  tenant’s  24  hours  begin  to 

run  on  the  3rd  day  after  the  date  that  you  mailed  the  letter.    For 

example, if you mail the letter on April 2, the tenant is not required 

to  complete  the  cleaning  until  April  6  (April  2  +  3  days  mailing  = 

April 5 + 24 hours notice = April 6). 

Where can I get more information? 

The  laws  of  Montana  are  called  the  Montana  Code  Annotated  or  “MCA.”    The 

laws about giving notice to a tenant about post-move out additional cleaning are 

located  in  the  MCA  at  Title  70,  Chapter  25,  Section  201  and  Section  206.    An 

easier  way  to  write  that  is:  §  70-25-201,  MCA,  and  §  70-25-206,  MCA.    The 

symbol  §  means  section.    You  can  find  the  MCA  at  your  local  library  or  on  the 

Montana  State  Law  Library  website  at  www.lawlibrary.mt.gov.    Click  on  the 

“Laws” option near the top of the page on that website, and then click on “MCA.”   

The letter to the tenant refers to specific sections of the law.  It is a good idea to 

read those sections of the law before you send the letter to the tenant.

You  have  recently  moved  out  of  my  property  located  at  (write  the  rental’s

I  have  completed  my  inspection  of  the  rental  property  and  this  is  your  24-hour 

notice of required cleaning.

Section 70-25-201, MCA, states that I cannot charge you for normal maintenance 

performed on a cyclical basis by me.  But I can charge you for any maintenance I 

must do because of your negligence.  It is your responsibility to bring the rental to 

the  condition  it  was  in  at  the  time  when  you  started  renting.    You  are  not 

responsible for cleaning needs that are caused by normal wear.

your deposit the actual cleaning expenses, including a reasonable charge for my 

labor if I do the work myself.  This is allowed under Section 70-25-201, MCA.
