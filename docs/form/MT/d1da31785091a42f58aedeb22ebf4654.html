Dear Interested Party: 
 

 

 

You may appeal the CSSD’s final decision or order by filing a Petition for 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Judicial Review in District Court. 

 

 

 

 
1. 

 
Before requesting judicial review, you must: 

 

 

 

 

 

 
have exhausted all administrative remedies available within the CSSD; and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been aggrieved by the CSSD's decision. (2-4-702(1)(a) and 40-5-
 
 
253(1) MCA) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2. 
 

Your petition for judicial review must contain: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a statement of the facts upon which jurisdiction and venue are based; 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
a statement describing how you have been aggrieved; 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
a statement of your grounds for relief; you must show that your substantial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
rights were prejudiced because: 

 
 
  the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are: 
)
i
(

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
- in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
- in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
- made upon unlawful procedure; 

 

 

 

 
 
- affected by other error of law; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
- clearly in error based on the reliable, 

 
probative, and substantial evidence on the 
 
whole record; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
- arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or 
 
clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion; or 
 

 

) 
i
i
(
 

the findings of fact essential to the decision were not made, although 
 
you requested them. (2-4-704(2) MCA) 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

d. 
 

the relief which you believe you are entitled to. (2-4-702(2)(b) MCA) 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A sample copy of a Petition for Judicial Review is enclosed as Sample Form A. 
 

 

 

 

3. 
 

 

 

You must file your Petition for Judicial Review in District Court within 30 days after 
 
service of the CSSD's final agency decision.  This time period commences the day 
 
after the date indicated in the Certificate of Mailing portion of the agency decision. 
 
 
After calculating the 30 days, add an additional 3 days to compensate for the agency 
 
 
decision being served by mail. 
 

 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A petition for judicial review is an original action and may not be filed under a pre-
 
 
existing cause number or joined with any other action. (40-5-253(3) MCA)  You must 
 
file your petition either: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a. 
 

b. 
 

 

in the District Court for the county where you reside or have your principal 
 
place of business, or 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the District Court for the county where the CSSD maintains its principal 
 
office, which is in Lewis and Clark County. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You must serve copies of the petition on the CSSD and all parties of record within 30 days 
after the petition is filed. (2-4-702(2)(a) & 40-5-253(4)MCA) 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

) 
i
(
 

) 
i
i
(
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
  

When filing your Petition for Judicial Review, you will have to submit to 
 
 
 
the District Court a filing fee of $120.00 (this is the standard fee, 
 
 
 
In some limited 
regardless  of  which District Court you file in). 
 
 
instances, the Court may waive the filing fee based on inability to pay. 
 
You may want to ask the Clerk of Court about this prior to filing your 
 
 
petition. 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

For your convenience, a listing of Montana cities, towns, counties and 
 
judicial districts as well as a listing of the address for each Montana 
 
judicial district court is attached. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

At the time you file your Petition with the Court, you also need to 
 
request that the Clerk of the District Court issue a Summons. (Rule 
 
4(c), Montana Rules of Civil Procedure) A sample copy of a Summons 
 
is enclosed as Sample Form C. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4. 
 

 

 

 

 
 

The summons must be served under Rule 4, Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, upon 
 
 
the CSSD and each party along with the petition for judicial review.  The district court 
 
does not obtain jurisdiction unless service on all parties is within 30 days after the 
 
petition is filed with the district court. (40-5-253(4) MCA) 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

In order to serve the CSSD, you must serve both the Attorney General and the 
CSSD. You can formally serve these documents by having a process server or the 
 
sheriff serve them upon the Attorney General's office and the CSSD and pay the 
costs associated with such service. Or, instead of formal service, you can request 
 
that the Attorney General's office and the CSSD acknowledge service by mailing to 
 
 
 
each (via first class mail, postage prepaid) a copy of the summons, a copy of the 
 
petition, an original and one copy of a Notice and Acknowledgment, and a return 
 
envelope postage prepaid addressed to you. 
 
 
Procedure) 
 
In order to serve parties other than the CSSD (such as the parent to whomsupport 
 
 
is owed or the parent who owes a support obligation), you can formally serve these 
 
 
documents by having a process server or the sheriff serve them uponthe party. Or, 
 
instead, you can request that the party acknowledge service by mailing to each (via 
 
first class mail, postage prepaid) a copy of the summons, a copy of the petition, an 
 
 
original and one copy of a Notice and Acknowledgment, and a return envelope 
postage prepaid addressed to you. 
 

(Rule 4(d), Montana Rules of Civil 
 

 
   
 

 
   

   
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A sample copy of a Notice and Acknowledgment is enclosed as Sample Form B. 
 

 

 

 

5. 
 

6. 
 

The filing of a Petition for Judicial Review does not stop enforcement of the ALJ's 
decision. The CSSD or the court may order a stay, following notice to the affected 
 
parties and an opportunity for hearing. (2-4-702(3) MCA) 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The CSSD has 42 days to answer your petition.  Individual respondents have 21 days 
 
to answer the petition. (Rule 12(a) Montana Rules of CivilProcedure) 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7. 
 

a. 
 

 

Except as provided in 7.b. below, no new evidence will be considered by the 
 
Court. The court will conduct the review without a jury and will limit the review 
 
 
to the record at hand. (2-4-704(1) MCA) 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The court will set a briefing schedule. A reference in a brief to the 
administrative record must be to specific pages of a particular part of the 
 
record. References to exhibits must be to the pages of the administrative 
 
transcript where the exhibit is identified, offered in evidence, and received or 
 
rejected. (40-5-253(5) MCA) 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

After briefs have been filed, and upon motion of a party, the court may order 
 
oral argument. (40-5-253(5) MCA) 
 

 

 

 

 

 

b. 
 

You may present additional evidence if: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) 
 

(ii) 
 

you request permission from the court allowing you to present 
 
additional evidence, and 
 

 

you show, to the satisfaction of the court, that the additional evidence 
is material and that there were good reasons why you did not present 
 
 
the evidence in the agency hearing.  (2-4-703 MCA) 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

c. 
 

 

 

 

If the court allows additional evidence to be presented, the court may refer the 
 
 
 
 
case to the agency to hear the additional evidence; the agency may modify 
 
 
 
its findings and decision based on the evidence. (2-4-703 MCA) 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8. 
 

 

 

   

You may obtain a review of the District Court's judgment, if you have been aggrieved 
by the District Court's order, by appealing to the Supreme Court within 60 days after 
 
 
entry of District Court's judgment. (2-4-711 MCA)

APPLICABLE MONTANA CODE ANNOTATED SECTIONS 
 

 

 

40-5-253. Administrative findings and order -- administrative remedies -- judicial review. (1) It is the 
 
intent of this part that administrative findings and orders be subject to judicial review, but 
 
administrative remedies must be exhausted prior to judicial review. The administrative procedures 
 
described in this part are subject to review in the appropriate district court. Except as provided in 
 
subsections (3) through (5), the review must be conducted pursuant to the Montana Administrative 
 
Procedure Act. Upon a showing by the department that administrative remedies have not been 
 
exhausted, the district court shall refuse review until the remedies are exhausted. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(2) This part may not be construed to abridge or in any way affect the obligor's right to counselduring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any and all judicial or administrative proceedings pursuant to this part. 
 

 

(3) A petition for judicial review is an original action and may not be filed under a preexisting cause 
 

 

 

 

 
number or joined with any other action. 
 

 

 

 

 

(4) A summons must be issued and served under Rule 4, Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, upon the 
 
child support enforcement division of the department and each party, along with the petition for judicial 
 
 
review. The division may be served through any of its employees. The district court does not obtain 
 
 
jurisdiction unless the petition for judicial review is served on all parties within 30 days after the petition 
 
is filed with the district court. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(5) The district court shall set a briefing schedule for a petition for judicial review. A reference in a 
brief to the administrative record must be to a particular part of the record, suitably designated, and to 
 
specific pages of that part of the record. Intelligible abbreviations may be used. A reference to an exhibit 
 
 
must be to the pages of the transcript on which the exhibit is identified, offered in evidence, and 
 
received or rejected. After briefs have been filed and upon motion of a party, the district court may 
 
order oral argument. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2-4-702. Initiating judicial review of contested cases. (1) (a) Except as provided in 75-2-213 and 75-20-
 
223, a person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is 
 
aggrieved by a final written decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review under this chapter. 
 
 
This section does not limit use of or the scope of judicial review available under other means of review, 
 
 
redress, relief, or trial de novo provided by statute. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) A party who proceeds before an agency under the terms of a particular statute may not be 
 
precluded from questioning the validity of that statute on judicial review, but the party may not raise 
 
any other question not raised before the agency unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that 
there was good cause for failure to raise the question before the agency. 
 

 
(2) (a) Except as provided in 75-2-211, 75-2-213, and subsection (2)(c) of this section, proceedings for 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

review must be instituted by filing a petition in district court within 30 days after service of the final 
written decision of the agency or, if a rehearing is requested, within 30 days after the written decisionis 
 
rendered. Except as otherwise provided by statute or subsection (2)(d), the petition must be filed in the 
district court for the county where the petitioner resides or has the petitioner's principal place of 
 
business or where the agency maintains its principal office. Copies of the petition must be promptly 
 
served upon the agency and all parties of record. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The petition must include a concise statement of the facts upon which jurisdiction and venueare 
 

 

 

 

 

 

based, a statement of the manner in which the petitioner is aggrieved, and the ground or grounds 
 
specified in 2-4-704(2) upon which the petitioner contends to be entitled to relief. The petition must 
 
 
demand the relief to which the petitioner believes the petitioner is entitled, and the demand for relief 
 
may be in the alternative. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) If a petition for review is filed pursuant to 33-16-1012(2)(c), the workers' compensation court, 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather than the district court, has jurisdiction and the provisions of this part apply to theworkers' 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 

compensation court in the same manner as the provisions of this part apply to the district court. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) If a petition for review is filed challenging a licensing or permitting decision made pursuant to Title 
 
 
 

75 or Title 82, the petition for review must be filed in the county where the facility is located or 
 
proposed to be located or where the action is proposed to occur. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(3) Unless otherwise provided by statute, the filing of the petition may not stay enforcement of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency's decision. The agency may grant or the reviewing court may order a stay upon terms that it 
 
considers proper, following notice to the affected parties and an opportunity for hearing. A stay may be 
 
issued without notice only if the provisions of 27-19-315 through 27-19-317 are met. 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(4) Within 30 days after the service of the petition or within further time allowed by the court, the 
 
agency shall transmit to the reviewing court the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the 
 
proceeding under review. By stipulation of all parties to the review proceedings, the record may be 
 
 
shortened. A party unreasonably refusing to stipulate to limit the record may be required by the court to 
 
pay the additional costs. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the 
 
 
record. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

2-4-703. Receipt of additional evidence. If, before the date set for hearing, application is made to the 
 

 

 

 

 

court for leave to present additional evidence and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the 
additional evidence is material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the 
 
proceeding before the agency, the court may order that the additional evidence be taken before the 
agency upon conditions determined by the court. The agency may modify its findings and decision by 
 
 
reason of the additional evidence and shall file that evidence and any modifications, new findings, or 
 
decisions with the reviewing court. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2-4-704. Standards of review. (1) The review must be conducted by the court without a jury and must 
 
be confined to the record. In cases of alleged irregularities in procedure before the agency not shown in 
 
the record, proof of the irregularities may be taken in the court. The court, upon request, shall hear oral 
 
argument and receive written briefs. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(2) The court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence 
 

 

 

 

 

 

on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further 
 
proceedings. The court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have 
 
been prejudiced because: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a) the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are: 
 
(i) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; 
 
(ii) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; 
 
(iii) made upon unlawful procedure; 
 
(iv) affected by other error of law; 
 
(v) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; 
 
(vi) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) findings of fact, upon issues essential to the decision, were not made although requested. 
 
(3) If a petition for review is filed challenging a licensing or permitting decision made pursuant to Title 
 
 

75 or Title 82 on the grounds of unconstitutionality, as provided in subsection (2)(a)(i), the petitioner 
 
shall first establish the unconstitutionality of the underlying statute. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2-4-711. Appeals -- staying agency decision. An aggrieved party may obtain review of a final judgment 
 
of a district court under this part by appeal to the supreme court within 60 days after entry of judgment. 
 
Such appeal shall be taken in the manner provided by law for appeals from district courts in civil cases. 
 
Unless otherwise provided by statute or unless the agency has granted a stay through the completion of 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
discretion; or 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
the judicial review process: 

 

(1) if appeal is taken from a judgment of the district court affirming an agency decision, the agency 
 
decision shall not be stayed except upon order of the supreme court; except that, in cases where a stay 
 
is in effect at the time of the filing of notice of appeal, the stay shall be continued by operation of law for 
 
 
20 days from the date of filing of the notice; 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(2) if appeal is taken from a judgment of the district court reversing or modifying an agency decision, 
 
the agency decision shall be stayed pending final determination of the appeal unless the supreme court 
 
 
orders otherwise.

the claim for relief is pending: 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(A) an  affidavit  reciting  that  none  of  the  persons  designated  in  Rule  4(i)  can  be  found 
 
within Montana, as well as a recitation of either: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) the last known address of any person designated under Rule 4(i); or 
 
(ii) a  statement  that  no  address  for  any  person  designated  under  Rule  4(i)  could  be 
 
found after the exercise of reasonable diligence; and 
 
 

 
(B) $10 deposited with the clerk to be paid to the secretary of state as a fee for each 
 
 
defendant for whom the secretary of state is to receive service. When service is requested at 
more than one address, an additional $10 must be paid for each party to be served at each 
 
 
additional address. 
 
 
 

(4) An affidavit filed pursuant to Rule 4(j)(3)(A) reciting that diligent inquiry was made is 
 
sufficient evidence of the diligence of inquiry. The affidavit need not detail the facts constituting 
 
such inquiry. The affidavit may also be combined in the same instrument with the affidavit 
 
required under Rules 4(o)(3)(A)(ii) and 4(p), should an affidavit under these Rules be required. 
 
(5) Upon receiving the necessary affidavit and fees as required under Rule 4(j)(3), the clerk of 
court must: 
 
 
 

(A) issue an order directing process to be served upon the Montana secretary of state or, in 
 
the secretary of state's absence, upon the Montana deputy secretary of state; and 
 
(B) mail to the secretary of state at the office of the secretary of state: 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
(i) the original summons; 
 
(ii) one copy of the summons and affidavit for the files of the secretary of state; 
 
(iii) one copy of the summons attached to a copy of the complaint for each of the 
 
 
defendants to be served by service upon the secretary of state; and 
 
(iv) the fee for service. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

(6) (A) Upon receiving the materials required under Rule 4(j)(5)(B), the secretary of state must 
 
mail a copy of the summons and complaint by certified mail, return receipt requested, either: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) to the last known address of any of the persons designated in Rule 4(i); or 
 
(ii) if the corporation or liability company is not organized in Montana and no address for 
a person designated under Rule 4(i) is known, to the secretary of state of the state in 
 
which the corporation or limited liability company was originally incorporated, if known. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(B) The secretary of state must also make a return as provided in Rule 4(p). 
 
 

(7) Service made in accordance with this Rule is deemed personal service on the corporation 
 
or limited liability company and the secretary of state, or a deputy in the absence of the 
 
 
secretary of state, is thereby appointed agent of the corporation or limited liability company 
 
for service of process. 
 
(8) (A) If a person designated in Rule 4(i) is located and served personally as provided by this 
 
Rule, service is deemed complete upon the corporation or limited liability company regardless of 
 
the receipt of any return receipt or advice by the postal authority of refusal of the addressee to 
 
receive the process mailed. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(B) If a person designated in Rule 4(i) is not located or served personally as provided by this 
 
Rule, service by publication must also be made as provided in Rules 4(c)(2)(D) and 4(o)(4). 
 
Such publication must first be made within 60 days from the date the original summons is 
 
mailed to the secretary of state. If such first publication is not made, the action shall be 
 
deemed dismissed as to any corporation or limited liability company intended to be served by 
 
such publication. Service by publication in accordance with this Rule is complete upon the date 
 
of the last publication of summons. 
 
 
 

(9) When service of process is made in accordance with this Rule, and there is no appearance 
 
thereafter made by any attorney for such corporation or limited liability company, service of 
all other notices required by law to be served in such action may be served upon the secretary 
 
of state. 
 
 
(1) For purposes of this Rule, a local government entity includes the following: 
 

(k) Serving a Local Government Entity. 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
(A) a city; 
 
(B) a village; 
 
(C) a town; 
 
(D) a school district; 
 
(E) a county; or 
 
(F) a public agency or board of any such entity. 
 
 

 
 
 
 
   
 

 

 

 

 
(2) A local government entity must be served by delivering a copy of the summons and 
 
complaint to any of the following: 
 

 
(A) a commissioner; 
 
(B) a trustee; 
 
(C) a board member; 
 
 
(D) a mayor; or 
 
(E) a head of the legislative department thereof. Whenever an officer or employee of the 
local government entity is sued in an individual capacity for an act or omission occurring in 
 
connection with duties performed on the local government entity's behalf (whether or not the 
 
 
officer or employee is also sued in an official capacity), a party must 
 

 
   
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
serve the local government entity and also serve the officer or employee under Rules 4(e), 
 
4(f), 4(g), 4(h), or 4(n). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(l) Serving the State. The state, as well as any state board or agency, must be served by delivering 
 
a copy of the summons and complaint to the attorney general and any other party prescribed by 
 
statute. Whenever an officer or employee of the state is sued in an individual capacity for an act or 
 
omission occurring in connection with duties performed on the state's behalf (whether or not the 
officer or employee is also sued in an official capacity), a party must serve the state and also serve 
 
the officer or employee under Rules 4(e), 4(f), 4(g), 4(h), or 4(n). 
 
 
(m) Serving an Estate or Trust. 
 
 
(1) An estate must be served by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to the 
 
personal representative. 
 
(2) A trust must be served by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to any of the 
 
 
 
trustees. 
 
 
(1) When a person cannot, with due diligence, be served personally within Montana, service may 
 
be made outside Montana in the manner provided for service within Montana. Such service has 
 
the same force and effect as though it had been made within Montana. 
 
 
(2) Where service by publication is permitted, personal service of the summons and 
 
complaint upon the defendant outside Montana is equivalent to and dispenses with the 
 
 
procedures, publication, and mailing provided for in Rules 4(o)(3), 4(o)(4), and 4(o)(5). 
 
 
(1) When Permitted. A defendant who has not been served under the foregoing sections of Rule 
 
4 can only be served by publication in the following situations: 
 

(n) Personal Service outside Montana. 
 
 

(o) Service by Publication. 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

(A) when  the  subject  of  the  action  is  real  or  personal  property  in  Montana  in  which  the 
 
defendant  has  or  claims  an  actual  or  contingent  lien  or  interest,  or  the  relief  demanded 
 
consists wholly or partially in excluding the defendant from any interest therein; 
 
(B) when the action is to foreclose, redeem from, or satisfy a mortgage, claim, or lien upon 
 
real or personal property within Montana; 
 
(C) when the action is for dissolution, legal separation or a declaration of invalidity of a 
marriage of a Montana resident, or for modification of a decree of dissolution or order on 
 
custody, visitation, support, or a parenting plan granted by a Montana court; or 
 
(D) when the defendant has property within Montana which has been attached or has a 
 
debtor within Montana who has been garnished. Jurisdiction under this subsection may be 
 
independent of or supplementary to jurisdiction acquired under Rules 4(o)(1)(A), 4(o)(1)(B), 
 
or 4(o)(1)(C). 
 
 

(2) Effect of Service by Publication. When a defendant has been served by publication as 
 
provided in this Rule, any Montana court having jurisdiction may render a decree adjudicating 
any interest of such defendant in the status, property, or thing acted upon. Such a decree does 
 
not bind the defendant personally to the personal jurisdiction of the court unless some ground 
 
for the exercise of personal jurisdiction exists. 
 
(3) Filing of Pleading and Affidavit for Service by Publication; Order for Publication. 
 

 
(A) Before service of the summons by publication is authorized, the following must be filed 
 
with the clerk of the district court of the county in which the action is commenced: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) a pleading setting forth a claim in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant in 
 
one of the situations defined in Rule 4(o)(1); and 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 

(ii) (a) in situations defined in Rules 4(o)(1)(A), 4(o)(1)(B), and 4(o)(1)(C), upon return of 
 
the summons showing the failure to find any defendant designated in the complaint, an 
 
 
affidavit stating that either: 
 
1. such defendant resides out of Montana; 
 
2. such defendant has departed from Montana; 
 
 
3. such defendant cannot, after due diligence, be found within Montana; 
 
4. such defendant conceals the defendant's person to avoid the service of 
 
summons; 
 
5. the defendant is a business or nonprofit entity as defined in Rule 4(i)(1) of which 
 
none of the persons in Rule 4(i) can, after due diligence, be found within Montana; or 
 
6. the defendant is an unknown claimant and the affiant has made diligent search 
 
and inquiry for all persons who claim or might claim any present or contingent right, 
 
title, estate, interest in, lien, or encumbrance upon such property or any part 
 
thereof, adverse to plaintiff's ownership, or any cloud upon plaintiff's title thereto, 
 
including any right of inchoate or accrued dower, and that the affiant has specifically 
 
named as defendants in such action all such persons whose names can be 
 
ascertained. 
 
 

(b) Such affidavit is sufficient evidence of the diligence of any inquiry made by the 
 
affiant if it recites the fact that diligent inquiry was made. The facts constituting such 
 
inquiry need not be detailed. 
 
(c) Such affidavit may be with the affidavit required under Rules 4(j)(3)(A) and 4(p), 
 
 
should an affidavit under these Rules be required. 
 
 

(iii) In the situation defined in Rule 4(o)(1)(D), proof that a valid attachment or 
garnishment has been effected must first be presented to the court. 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(B) Upon complying herewith, the plaintiff must obtain an order, issued either by the judge 
or clerk of court, for the service of summons to be made upon the defendants by 
 
publication. 
 
 

(4) Number of Publications. Service by publication must be made by publishing the summons 
 
once a week for three successive weeks in a newspaper published in the county in which the 
 
action is pending or, if no newspaper is published in such county, then in a newspaper 
 
published in an adjoining county that has a general circulation therein. 
 
(5) Mailing Summons and Complaint. A copy of the summons and complaint, at any time after 
 
the filing of the affidavit for publication but not later than 14 days after the first publication of the 
 
summons, must be mailed, postage prepaid, to the defendant at defendant's place of residence, 
 
 
unless the affidavit for publication states that the residence of the defendant is unknown. If the 
 
defendant is a business or nonprofit entity as defined in Rule 4(i)(1), and personal service cannot 
 
with due diligence be effected within Montana on any of the persons designated in Rule 4(i), then 
 
the secretary of state must be served pursuant to Rule 4(j). 
 
(6) Time When First Publication or Service outside Montana Must Be Made. The first 
 
publication of summons or personal service of the summons and complaint upon the defendant 
 
 
out of Montana must be made within 60 days after the filing of the affidavit for publication. If 
not, the action must be dismissed as to any party intended to be served by such publication. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(p) Serving the Secretary of State. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(7) When Service by Publication or Outside Montana Complete. Service by publicationis 
 
complete on the date of the last publication of the summons or, in case of personal service of the 
 
 
summons and complaint upon the defendant out of Montana, on the date of such service. 
 
 
 
 
(1) Whenever service is to be made as provided in Rules 4(i) and 4(o)(5), the requirements of 
 
Rule 4(i) must be met. 
 
(2) In all other cases, unless otherwise provided by statute, whenever the Montana secretary of 
state has been appointed, or is deemed by law to have been appointed, as the agent to receive 
service of process for any person who cannot with due diligence be found or served personally 
 
within Montana, the party or the party's attorney must file with the clerk of court in which the 
 
claim for relief is pending the following: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(A) an affidavit stating the facts showing that the secretary of state is such agent, as well as 
 
 
the residence and last known address of the person to be served; 
 
 
(B) sufficient copies of the affidavit, summons, and complaint for service upon the 
 
secretary of state; and 
 
(C) $10 to be paid to the secretary of state as a fee for each of the defendants for whom the 
secretary of state is to receive service. Where service is requested at more than one address, 
 
an additional $10 must be paid for each party to be served at each additional address. 
 
(3) Upon receipt of the materials specified in Rule 4(p)(2), the clerk must forward to the 
 
 
 
secretary of state the following: 
 
(A) the original summons; 
 
(B) a copy of both the summons and the affidavit for the files of the secretary of state; 
 
 
(C) a copy of the summons attached to a copy of the complaint for each of the 
 
defendants to be served by service upon the secretary of state; and 
 
(D) the fee. 
 
 

(4) Such service on the secretary of state is sufficient personal service upon the person to be 
served provided that either: 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

(A) notice of such service, a copy of the summons, and a copy of the complaint are sent from 
 
the secretary of state or a deputy to the party to be served at the party's last known address 
 
by registered or certified mail, marked "Deliver to Addressee Only" and "Return Receipt 
 
Requested." Either such return receipt purportedly signed by the addressee must be received 
 
by the secretary of state, or the postal authority must advise the secretary of state that 
 
delivery of the registered or certified mail was refused by the addressee, except in those cases 
 
where compliance is excused under the provisions of Rule 4(i). The date upon which the 
 
secretary of state receives either the return receipt or the advice of the postal authority is 
 
deemed the date of service; or 
 
(B) the secretary of state, or a deputy, may cause a copy of the summons and complaint to 
 
be  served  by  any  qualified  law  enforcement  officer  in  accordance  with  the  applicable 
 
procedure from Rules 4(e)-(n). 
 
 

(5) The  secretary  of  state  or  a  deputy  must  make  an  original  and  two  copies  of  an  affidavit 
 
 
reciting the following: 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(A) the fact of service upon the secretary of state by the clerk of court, including the day and 
 
hour of such service; 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(B) the fact of mailing a copy of the summons, complaint, and notice to the defendant, 
 
including the day and hour thereof, except in those cases where such mailing is excused under 
 
Rule 4(i), in which cases the affidavit must so recite; and 
 
(C) the fact of receipt of a return from the postal department, including the date and 
 
hour thereof. A copy of such return must be attached to the affidavit. 
 
 
 
 

(6) The secretary of state, or a deputy, must then transmit to the clerk of court the 
following, which the clerk must file in the claim for relief: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
(A) the original summons; 
 
 
(B) the original affidavit; and 
 
(C) a copy of the notice to the defendant, when such notice was required. 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

(7) The secretary of state or a deputy must also transmit to the plaintiff's attorney a copy of the 
 
secretary of state's or deputy's affidavit, along with a copy of the notice to the defendant where 
such notice was required. 
 
(8) The secretary of state must keep on file in the secretary of state's office copies of the 
 
following: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

(A) the summons; 
 
(B) the affidavit served on the secretary of state by the clerk of court; and 
 
(C) a copy of the affidavit executed and issued by the secretary of state or a deputy. 
 
(9) Continuance to Allow Defense. In any of the cases provided for in either this Rule or Rule 
 
 
4(i), the court in which the claim for relief is pending may order any continuance necessary to 
 
 
afford a reasonable opportunity to defend the action. 
 
 
(q) Amendment. Upon such notice and terms as it deems just, the court in its discretion may allow 
 
 
any process or proof of service thereof to be amended at any time, unless it appears that material 
 
prejudice would result to the substantial rights of the party against whom the process issued. 
 
(r) Proof of Service. 
 

 
(1) Proving service of the summons and the complaint or notice accompanying the same, if any, 
 
must be accomplished as follows: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

(A) if by the sheriff or other officer, the sheriff's or other officer's certificate including the 
 
time, date, and place of service; 
 
 
(B) if by any other person, that person's affidavit; 
 
(C) if by publication, an affidavit of the publisher and an affidavit of the deposit of a copy of 
the summons and complaint in the post office as required by law, if deposited; or 
 
 
(D) the written admission of the defendant showing the date and place of service. 
 
   

(2) If service is made under Rule 4(d)(3), the sender must file with the court the 
acknowledgment received. 
 
(3) Failure to make proof of service does not affect the validity of service. 
 
(4) The required affidavit of service must state the time, date, place, and manner of service. 
 
 
 
 
When service is by a person other than the sheriff or person designated by law, the affidavit must 
 
 
also state that the person serving is of legal age and knew the person served to be the person 
 
named in the papers served and the person intended to be served. 
 
(s) Procedure Where Not All Defendants Served. 
 
 
 
(1) If the summons is served on one or more, but not all, defendants, plaintiff may proceed to 
 
trial and judgment against the served defendant(s). 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(2) At any time thereafter, plaintiff may serve summons to cause the unserved defendant(s) to 
 
appear to show cause why the unserved defendant(s) should not be made a party to such 
 
judgment. The court must then hear and determine the matter in the same manner as if the 
unserved defendant(s) had been originally brought into court. The unserved defendant(s) must 
 
also be allowed the benefit of any payment or satisfaction made on the recovered judgment. 
 
(t) Time Limit for Issuance and Service of Process. 
 
 
(1) A plaintiff must accomplish service within three years after filing a complaint. Absent an 
 
appearance by defendant(s), the court, upon motion or on its own initiative, must dismiss an 
 
 
action without prejudice if the plaintiff fails to do so. 
 
(2) A plaintiff who names a fictitious defendant in the complaint pursuant to section 25-5- 103 
may, within three years of filing the original complaint, amend the complaint to substitute a real 
defendant for the fictitious defendant. The three-year time period set forth in Rule 4(t)(1) begins 
 
to run as to the newly identified defendant from the date of the filing of the original complaint. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule 12. Defenses and Objections: When and How Presented; Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings; 
 
 
Consolidating Motions; Waiving Defenses; Pretrial Hearing. 

 

(a) Time to Serve a Responsive Pleading. 
 

 
(1) In General. Unless another time is specified by this rule or a statute, the time for 
 
serving a responsive pleading is as follows: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

(A) A defendant must serve an answer within 21 days after being served with the 
 
summons and complaint, unless the court orders otherwise under Rule 4(c)(2)(C). 
 
 
(B) A party must serve an answer to a counterclaim or crossclaim within 21 days after being 
 
served with the pleading that states the counterclaim or crossclaim. 
 
(C) A party must serve a reply to an answer within 21 days after being served with an order 
 
 
to reply, unless the order specifies a different time. 
 
 
(2) State of Montana and Its Agencies, Officers, or Employees Sued in an Official Capacity. The 
 
 
State of Montana, a state agency, or a state officer or employee sued only in an official capacity 
 
must serve an answer to a complaint, counterclaim, or crossclaim within 42 days after service on 
 
the attorney general. 
 
(3) State Officers or Employees Sued in an Individual Capacity. A state officer or employee 
 
 
sued in an individual capacity for an act or omission occurring in connection with duties 
 
performed on the states behalf must serve an answer to a complaint, counterclaim, or 
crossclaim within 42 days after service on the officer or employee or service on the attorney 
 
general, whichever is later. 
 
(4) Effect of a Motion. Unless the court sets a different time, serving a motion under this rule 
 
 
alters these periods as follows: 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

(A) if the court denies the motion or postpones its disposition until trial, the responsive 
pleading must be served within 14 days after notice of the courts action; or 
 
(B) if the court grants a motion for a more definite statement, the responsive pleading 
 
must be served within 14 days after the more definite statement is served.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
