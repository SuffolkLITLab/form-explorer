      <pre>Quitclaim Deeds. What are they? When are they used? 
What are the risks? What could be some of the unintended  
tax consequences? 

A MONTANA QUITCLAIM DEED IS A LEGAL FORM THAT 
allows for the transfer of real property (land and buildings) 
from a person typically called the grantor, to another person, 
usually called the grantee. The word “person” also includes 
an entity such as a trust or limited liability company (LLC). 
After the transfer, the grantee then holds title to the property. 
This MontGuide answers questions commonly asked about 
quitclaim deeds filed in Montana.

Does a quitclaim deed have the 
same features as a warranty 
deed?
No. A quitclaim deed is different from a warranty deed for 
real property. As its name suggests, a warranty deed usually 
includes several warranties. Warranties are a guarantee or 
promise. The grantor of a warranty deed makes promises or 
guarantees to the grantee about the title of the real property 
and its transfer to the grantee. 

A quitclaim deed does not include any promises or 
guarantees to the grantee. Whatever interest the grantor has 
in the real property – even if the interest is nothing – that 
is what the grantee receives. 

The grantee of a quitclaim deed accepts the risk of any 
known or unknown problems with the real property. The 
real property the grantee receives from a quitclaim deed can 
present problems. Unknown claims against the property 
could include a defect in a title, collection liens, missing heirs, 
unknown easements, survey disputes or a previous mortgage. 
The previous owners of the property may create other 
problems for a grantee. An owner may have placed restrictions 
on the use of the property, commonly called covenants. A 
former owner may have established rules against parking a 
recreational vehicle in a driveway or having a car on blocks 
for a repair job on the lawn. 

When is a quitclaim deed used?
Quitclaim deeds are rarely used for traditional real estate 
transfers by land title companies in Montana. A title company 
researches property records in a title search to verify the 
valid owner of real property. A title company also issues 
title insurance to protect the lender and/or owners against 
lawsuits or claims against the property that result from issues 
with quitclaim deeds discussed previously. Before issuing 
title insurance, some title companies may use a quitclaim 
deed to clear up some of these problems. 

Quitclaim deeds are sometimes used between spouses 
to ensure both spouses names appear on the property. A 
quitclaim deed transfers any interest the person may have 
in the real property to the borrower-spouse. Lenders may 
require a quitclaim deed so that names on loans and property 
match. Other common reasons Montanans file a quitclaim 
deed include: 
•  Clear up questions or correct problems with the title;
•  Sell or transfer property to family members;
•  Add a new spouse to the title;
•  Transfer of ownership between divorcing spouses;
•  Remove a name from the title;
•  Correct a spelling mistake of owners on the title; 
•  Correct an owner’s name in the case of a name change 

or a gender reassignment; 

•  Transfer legal ownership of real property to an ex-spouse 

or a business organization;

•  Remove a deceased person’s name
•  Transfer ownership of land to a trust.

Are there are any taxes due when 
a quitclaim deed is filed?
Quitclaim deed transfers to a spouse or to a qualifying charity 
are not taxed. However, if the grantor owes property taxes 
or has a federal or state income tax lien, the grantor must 
pay the taxes. 

While no money typically changes hands with a quitclaim 
deed, the Internal Revenue Service applies federal gift tax 
rules to the transfer if a gift is involved. Suppose a parent files

FAMILY FINANCIAL MANAGEMENTMT202102HR, NEW 1/21Quitclaim Deeds in MontanaBy Marsha A. Goetting, PhD, CFP®, CFCS, Professor and Extension  Family Economics Specialist, Montana State University-Bozeman and  Jane Wolery, Family Consumer Science, 4-H Youth Development,  Community Development Agent in Teton CountyMontGuidePatti Goroskia quitclaim deed for a house to a child. Individuals have an 
annual gift tax exclusion of $15,000. Married couples who 
share ownership of gifted property have an annual exclusion 
of $30,000. Under IRS rules, only the money above the 
annual exclusion amount is taxed. In most cases the federal 
gift tax is not a concern. Individuals can gift $11,580,000 
beyond the annual exclusion over their lifetimes without 
owing a federal gift tax. Married couples can gift a total of 
$23,160,000 without owing a federal gift tax.

Using a quitclaim deed for the sale of real property is 
treated differently. In that case, a grantee may owe state and 
federal income tax on any profit from the sale.

Example 1. Carry-over basis with gifting while 
alive: Bertha gifted her home to her granddaughter, 
Kala, using a quitclaim deed. Bertha paid $40,000 for 
the home 30 years ago and that amount is her basis. 
Kala assumed Bertha’s basis of $40,000 in the home. 
This is known as the carry-over basis. Kala sold the 
home for $500,000. Kala now has a taxable capital 
gain of $460,000 on the sale ($500,000 -$40,000 = 
$460,000). Kala could owe about $91,400 (assuming 
an effective state rate of 4.9%; federal rate of 15%) in 
state and federal income taxes because of the capital 
gain of $460,000 on the sale. 

Example 2. Stepped-up basis: Grandma Bertha 
died and left her home to Kala in a will. At the time 
of Bertha’s death, her home was valued at $500,000. 
Several months later, Kala sold the home for $500,000. 
Kala does not pay any federal or state income tax on the 
sale. Why? Because Kala received a stepped-up basis in 
the home when Bertha died. Upon Bertha’s death, the 
basis she had in the home ($40,000) was stepped up to 
its current fair market value, or $500,000. 

Because the sale price was not more than the stepped-
up basis of $500,000, there was no capital gain for Kala 
to report. Bertha’s estate will not owe a federal estate 
tax because of the exclusion amount ($11,580,000 in 
2020). Because Montana no longer has an inheritance 
tax, Kala did not owe any taxes to the state either. 

Filers of quitclaim deeds should be aware of any potential 

income tax consequences before filing a quitclaim deed. 

Where can I get a quitclaim deed 
form?

MSU Extension does not provide a quitclaim deed form 
because the legislature has not passed a provision for a 
statutory form. A local attorney can draft a quitclaim deed 
and inform about the specific problems that may happen 
by using a quitclaim deed. 

Some Montana County Clerk and Recorders offices 
have a quitclaim deed form on their websites. The office of 

2

the Clerk and Recorder in Jefferson County provides one: 
http://www.jeffersoncounty-mt.gov/clerk_recorder.html. 
There are also many forms available on the internet offering 
a “do-it-yourself” quitclaim deed form with costs ranging 
from $0 to $50.

What information does a quitclaim 
deed contain?

A quitclaim deed includes the legal name and mailing 
address of each grantor and each grantee. The grantor must  
also provide a complete legal description of the property. A 
grantor should use the legal description from a previously 
recorded deed. 

A complete legal description is available from the Office of 
the Clerk and Recorder in the county where the real property 
is located. The description appearing on the property tax 
bill sent annually by the county treasurer does not provide 
the complete legal description for real property because of 
a lack of space on the form. Montana Cadastral, an online 
mapping and land ownership database, can be another source 
for the legal land description.

When there is more than one 
grantee, how is property titled on 
a quitclaim deed?
All documents resulting in a change in property ownership 
must provide names of all grantees. The most common 
ways to hold title to real property with multiple owners in 
Montana are tenants in common or joint tenancy with 
right of survivorship. A grant of real property in a quitclaim 
deed to more than one grantee is assumed to be as “tenants in 
common” unless otherwise clearly stated on the quitclaim deed. 

What is the meaning of tenants in 
common on a quitclaim deed?

A real property interest as tenants in common means that two 
or more persons hold undivided interests in the same real 
property with no right of survivorship for the surviving tenant 
in common. An undivided interest means each grantee 
owns a portion of the total value of the real property. If there 
are two grantees on the quitclaim deed, their undivided 
interest is 50 percent each; if there are four grantees, 25 
percent each; and so on. 

One tenant in common cannot simply draw a line on a 
map and say the property on the left side of the line is theirs 
and the property on the right side is the other owners. Nor, 
can one tenant in common claim to own the valuable portion 
of the real property with an oil well and say the other tenant 
in common only owns the portion with noxious weeds. All 
tenants in common own an undivided interest in all the 
real property containing both the oil well and the section 
with noxious weeds. 

When title to real property is held by tenants in common, 
all the co-tenants have equal rights to manage and live on the 
property. Each tenant in common has the right to transfer 
their proportional share of the real property by sale or gift. 
When a tenant in common dies, the deceased’s interest in the 
real property passes to the deceased’s heirs. This assumes the 
deceased died without a will. If the deceased had a written 
will, the property passes to their devisees (beneficiaries). 

Upon death of a tenant in common the deceased’s 
interests must pass through probate unless the tenant used 
a transfer on death deed (previously called a beneficiary deed) 
to avoid probate. https://store.msuextension.org/publications/
FamilyFinancialManagement/MT202010HR.pdf

The grantee can request the grantor to create a tenancy 
in common on a quitclaim deed by using the words “to Laila 
Smith and Kim Smith.” While the grantor does not need to 
provide additional wording, adding the words “as tenants in 
common” clarifies ownership. This wording makes it clear 
the owners do not own the property as joint tenants with 
right of survivorship.  

Example 3: Michael and Jennifer are siblings. Both 
are married and have children. They own land they 
inherited from their parents as tenants in common. 
If Michael dies, his interest of 50% of the tenant in 
common property passes to his spouse. Then Michael’s 
spouse and his sister, Jennifer, equally own the property 
as tenants in common—each owning 50% interest. 

What is the meaning of joint 
tenancy with right of survivorship 
on a quitclaim deed? 

Instead of holding property as a tenant in common, multiple 
grantees may specify to the grantor they want the title to 
appear as a joint tenancy with right of survivorship 
(JTWROS). That means if one of the joint tenants dies, 
the surviving joint tenant(s) becomes owner(s) of the real 
property. For example, if there were three joint tenants and 
one joint tenant died, the survivors own 50 percent each. A 
joint tenancy with right of survivorship also avoids probate, 
unlike holding the property as a tenant in common. 

Typical wording on a quitclaim deed to create joint 
tenancy between two grantees would be “to Christopher James 
and Becky James as joint tenants with right of survivorship 
and not as tenants in common.” If Becky dies, Christopher 
becomes the sole owner of the property. If Christopher dies, 
Becky becomes the sole owner. Christopher and Becky should 
seriously consider whether this result is what they intended.
If Christopher and Becky are married, then having the 
joint tenant inherit the property is probably what they wanted. 
However, if Christopher and Becky are siblings, having the 
property in joint tenancy means upon Christopher’s death 
his heirs would not inherit his share in the joint tenancy. The 

property automatically passes to his sister because of the joint 
tenancy. Christopher’s spouse has no right to the property 
because of the joint tenancy with right of survivorship with 
Becky, his sister. 

Who signs a quitclaim deed?
The grantor must sign a quitclaim deed and acknowledge it 
before a notary public. The grantor then records the deed 
with the Clerk and Recorder in the county where the real 
property is located. Recording a quitclaim deed provides 
notice to all subsequent mortgagees and purchasers there is 
a new owner of the property. 

If I have a mortgage on my 
property, may I file a quitclaim 
deed?
A quitclaim deed only transfers ownership of the property. 
The deed does not mean the grantee has any responsibility 
for the underlying mortgage or outstanding liens against 
the property. While the new owner (grantee) has title 
to the property, the grantor is still liable for paying the 
outstanding mortgage.

How is a new owner of property 
notified about the property tax? 

Any person transferring real property with a quitclaim 
deed in Montana must file a Realty Transfer Certificate 
(Form 448) that is available from the Montana Department 
of Revenue at https://app.mt.gov/myrevenue/Endpoint/
DownloadPdf?yearId=857. The Department uses this form to 
change the name on ownership records used for the assessment 
and taxation of real property. This form must accompany 
the quitclaim deed when it is filed with the County Clerk 
and Recorder in the county where the land is located. 

The Realty Transfer Certificate form also provides for a 
Water Right Disclosure for the grantor to sign. The Montana 
Legislature requires both the buyer and seller of property to 
know the water right situation for the property. Do any water 
rights exist? And, are the water rights transferred with or 
withheld from the property? For information about property 
water rights, contact the Water Rights Bureau at http://dnrc.
mt.gov/divisions/water/water-rights. 

What is the cost of recording a 
quitclaim deed in Montana?

The recording fee in 2020 for a quitclaim deed is $7 per 
page, assuming the deed meets the statutory standards for 
recorded documents. The standards contain requirements 
about margins, color of ink, and size of paper used for 
recorded documents. Details about the standard format 
are available at any Montana County Clerk and Recorder’s

Summary
A Montana quitclaim deed is a legal form that transfers 
real property (land and buildings) without warranties or 
promises about the validity of title. The grantor(s) must sign 
a quitclaim deed and acknowledge it before a notary public. 
The grantee(s) submits the deed for recording in the Clerk and 
Recorder’s office in the county where the property is located.

May I change my mind about a 
quitclaim deed after it is filed?

Generally, the answer is no. After the grantor files the 
quitclaim deed with the County Clerk and Recorder’s Office, 
the title legally passes from the grantor to the grantee. Unless 
the new owner willingly files a quitclaim deed to reverse 
ownership back to the grantee, there are not many options. 
One possible way to reverse a quitclaim deed is to file a 
petition with the district court and submit proof the grantor 
was experiencing undue pressure when signing the deed.
