DNet Overview 

e are all better able to serve the children and families of Arkansas if we have more accurate and timelier 
information.  DNet is a web-based information system that has been created with a Court Improvement Project 
grant to achieve several purposes: 
 

1.  To enable information sharing between the courts and the Department of Human Services  
2.  To provide timely permanency outcome data to judges and others working in the juvenile court system 
3.  To enable attorneys and judges to efficiently produce court orders 
4.  To collect management information for the attorney ad litem program, the parent counsel program, the 

Office of Chief Counsel, and the CASA program 

5.  To collect more accurate data about processes and outcomes in juvenile court and to reduce duplication 

6.  Increased protection of confidentiality and privacy as documents no longer need to be emailed or sent in 

of data entry. 

other non-secure methods. 

he following basic principles have guided development of this system: 

1.  DNet does not change what information a person may access, but only how it is accessed.  
2.  Privacy and confidentiality are paramount concerns.  For this reason, most users have access only to the 

cases to which they are assigned. 

3.  Wherever possible, check boxes have been provided to speed data entry.  However, text boxes are also 

available (and in some cases, required) so that court orders may be tailored to the needs of the 
individuals involved in specific cases.  

4.  Whoever “owns” the information is responsible for maintaining it. 

5.  DNet is not the official court record, nor is it the official DHS record for information viewable from 

CHRIS.

Security 

rotecting the privacy of individuals and honoring confidentiality are critically important.  The security of any 
system is only as strong as its weakest link, so it is vital that EVERY user of DNet follow the security rules for 
DNet.   

he DNet system does not change what information is available to users, it merely changes how that 

information is accessed. DNet is not the official court record.  It is designed to make information accessible and 
easy to use for parties. All DNet users are required to sign an agreement prior to using the system.   

sers must agree: 

1.  Confidential information may be used only as permitted by applicable state and federal laws, including 
A.C.A. § 12-18-201-209 (Child Maltreatment:  Offenses & Penalties), A.C.A. § 9-27-309 (Juvenile 
Code: Confidentiality of Records), and A.C.A. § 9-28-407 (Juvenile Code: Licenses Required & Issued) 
as well as Arkansas Supreme Court Administration Order 19 (Access to Court Records).   

2.  Any disclosure, use, or attempted use of confidential information for any purpose unrelated to the D-N 

case will be subject to any remedy at law. 

3.  No one with access to DNet may share his or her username or password with anyone for any purpose. 
4.  No one with access to DNet may store his or her username and password together. 
5.  DNet is to be used only: 

a.  to serve or represent a party or a party’s clients in connection with official duties, 
b.  to monitor permanency outcome measures for one’s court or county/area, 
c.  to make administrative reports as required, and 
d.  to produce court orders. 

6.  Any computer, including laptops, used for DNet must have: 

a.  Password protection 
b.  Updated anti-virus software 
c.  Updated anti-spyware software 

encrypted. 

7.  Any documents downloaded from DNet or information collected from DNet shall not be emailed unless 

8.  Care must be taken so that others do not see information on the computer screen.  Don’t leave DNet up 
on your screen when visitors may be able to see it.  When using DNet in court, turn your computer so 
that unauthorized individuals cannot see what is on the screen.  Log off when leaving your computer 
unattended, even for a short time. 

9.  If you suspect ANY security problem such as unauthorized access or a compromised password, contact 

your supervisor and the DNet help desk immediately. 

 security agreement is at the end of this document and must be signed prior to receiving a password.

ou should see a screen that looks like this: 

nter your user name, which you have received from the AOC (for most users it is first initial, middle initial, 

last name). If you do not have a password, contact Makeisha Davis at makeisha.davis@arkansas.gov.

This is the main page. To access new removals, click on "Active Case List" in the menu on the left side. 

his will bring you to a list of cases.  On the right side, you will see an area labeled "New Abuse/Neglect Cases 
from CHRIS." CHRIS is the database used by the Division of Children and Family Services, and when a child's 
removal is entered in CHRIS the information is shared with DNet. This occurs four times daily. You should 
only see cases from your county or counties.

n the area with new abuse/neglect cases from CHRIS, you will see the county, CHRIS case number, case name, 
and the date the case was received by DNet. As with active cases, you can search for a removal by entering a 
name in the search box.  

o open a case, click on the pencil and paper icon to the left of the county name. The case information screen 

will come up.

In the case info box, make sure the county is correct. You can change it at this stage if the case was filed in a 
different county. 

n the DCFS Clients/Staff box you will see the case participants who came over from the CHRIS system.  

dding Parties 

f a juvenile is missing: 

- if you have Contexte, look up their ID number and add them to 

the case (see box to the right). 

- if you do NOT have Contexte, email dnet@arkansas.gov. AOC 
staff will need to look up the juvenile's CHRIS ID number and 
initiate the case. 

f a parent is missing: 

- please add that person to the case by clicking on "Add 

Participants" (see box to right). 

- if you do not have Contexte, you can still initiate the case, but 
please email dnet@arkansas.gov to ask AOC staff to add the 
parent(s). 

f a DCFS staff person is missing: 

- do nothing. It is likely to come over as an updated record later. 

n the Legal Counsel box, choose the judge, OCC, AAL, and PC. 
The choices in these boxes are based on the county selected in the 
case info box. If you don't see the person you need, there are two 
options: 
 

Adding family participants  
(if you have access to Contexte): 
1. Click on "add participants" 
2. click the arrow next to the type of 
participant you are adding. 
3. Look up the person's ID number in 
Contexte. Enter that ID number in the 
ID field and click "search." Leave the 
rest of the fields blank. 
This step is important because 
individuals sometimes have multiple 
IDs in Contexte, and it's important to 
connect to the correct one for this 
case. 
4. Click on the ID number in the left 
column. 
5. Select the participant role.  
 

1. If this is someone who is routinely assigned to cases in your county, please email that information to 

dnet@arkansas.gov. It is difficult to keep our lists up-to-date and we will appreciate your help with that. 
2. If it's an unusual appointment, then click "Add Participants" in the DCFS Clients/Staff box. (You can also 

do this while you're waiting for a participant to be added to the default lists.)   
- For judges, click the arrow next to  "Judge Search." For judge search, the easiest way to find the judge 
is by putting in the judicial district number followed by a % sign. Then click the ID number in the left 
column and select the participant role. 

- For attorneys, click the arrow next to  "Attorney Search." Enter the bar number if you know it, or the 
last name and first name if you don't. Click the number in the left column and choose the participant 
role. 

- For more detailed instructions, see "Adding case participants" in the main DNet user manual.  

f you enter someone in error, use the delete box within the legal counsel box.

and the file date of the case. To enter the date, you can click on the calendar to the right of the date field and 
choose the date or type in the date in MM/DD/YYYY format. Click "Save petition info".  

n the next box (Official Court Case Info), complete the docket number. The first part of the docket number is 
generated based on county and is not changeable. The year defaults to the current year, but can be changed if 
necessary. Fill in the sequence number in the yellow box. Enter the case name, which should be the last name(s) 
of the juveniles from oldest to youngest. 

elect the hearing type of the first hearing (adjudication or probable cause), the date of the hearing (again, click 

on the calendar or fill it in MM/DD/YYYY format), and the time of the hearing. For now, ignore the location 
room field. Click on create case/add hearing. This makes the case official in DNet, and this page will appear:

cases lists of all the legal counsel appointed to the case in DNet. Once orders have been uploaded they will be 
visible to DCFS caseworkers. 

lease note that you cannot create a case if the judge, AAL, and OCC have not been entered! 

plitting a case 

ccasionally multiple juveniles will come in one removal record that are actually more than one case. If this 

occurs, make a note (or print a screen shot) of the juveniles' ID numbers as well as the ID numbers of the 
parent(s) and the DCFS caseworker and supervisor. 

o ahead and initiate a case for one juvenile (or several juveniles who should be on the same case). You'll then 

need to create a totally new case for the remaining juvenile(s).
