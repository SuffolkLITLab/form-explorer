II.    AOC'S DUTIES 

A.  Selected Extracts. AOC will provide, based upon acceptance of LICENSEE'S request, the 

Contexte and CMS extracts, as defined in Article I of this Agreement. 

B.  Exclusions. Unless LICENSEE is eligible for data pursuant to Administrative Order VI (B) 
(3) and/or VI (B) (5), each compiled data extract will exclude the following: all records that 
are not public records under the Administrative Order 19; all records exempt from disclosure 
by other statute; all records sealed by order of the court for which they are maintained, and 
full social security numbers, driver’s license or equivalent state identification card numbers, 
account numbers and PINs of specific assets, liabilities, accounts, and credit cards. 

C.  User Manual. AOC will provide an inquiry user manual to LICENSEE as applicable for the 

D.  Documentation. AOC will provide file layout and documentation for each data extract 

data extracts provided. 

provided. 

E.  Offense Codes. AOC will provide its most current list of offense codes to any 

LICENSEE provided with any data extract. 

F.  Implementation Dates. AOC will provide a list of dates of implementation of Contexte 

and CMS for each court, as applicable for the data extracts provided. 

G.  Limited Technical Support. AOC will provide limited support to LICENSEE for the 

purpose of resolving technical support problems with downloading the data extract files from 
AOC's file servers. 

H.  Support Limitations. Support for use and interpretation of any data received is limited to the 

documentation provided pursuant to this Article. 
 

III.   LIMITS ON AOC'S DUTIES 

A.  Data Limits. The data in each data extract provided pursuant to this Agreement are subject 

to the following limitations: 

1.  Data availability is based on the dates Contexte and CMS were implemented in a 

particular court; those dates are provided pursuant to Article II of this Agreement. In 
some courts, the clerk of court has chosen to enter into Contexte or CMS case data 
from dates prior to that court's implementation of Contexte or CMS; for those counties 
that data will be included in the relevant extracts. 

2.  The official custodian of all official court records for each court is the clerk of court. AOC 
is not the official custodian of any record provided in any Contexte data extract where 
the court is indicated as a full Contexte user. Each data extract may contain data 
entered by AOC into the Contexte or CMS databases as reported to AOC by the court. 
AOC warrants that the records in each data extract are accurate reflections of the 
databases from which they were extracted, but does not warrant the accuracy of the 
databases themselves. 

3.  Use of the data contained in a data extract may not be classified as a certified record 
check. A certified report of a criminal record search of a person's record in a particular 
county may be obtained from the clerk of court of that county, upon payment of a 
statutory search and/or certification fee.  

4.  AOC is not liable for any damages incurred by LICENSEE resulting from the inaccuracy 
or incompleteness of any information in any official court record, provided the extract of 
any data matched the relevant database at the time of extraction. It is expressly 
understood by the parties that it is LICENSEE'S responsibility to verify information or 
data obtained in any data extract with official information reposing at the court of record. 
5.  AOC is not liable for any demand or claim, regardless of form of action, for any damages 
arising from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of AOC. 

6.  AOC is not liable for any demand or claim, regardless of form of action, for any 

Revised September 28, 2012 

 

Page 3 

Compiled Records License Agreement 

damages resulting from the use by LICENSEE of any computer programs or other 
materials provided under this Agreement. AOC has no obligation to maintain or 
upgrade any such computer programs provided under this Agreement, except as AOC 
deems necessary. 
If AOC is in disaster recovery mode, AOC is not liable for any demand or claim, 
regardless of form of action, for any damages arising from denial of access or inability 
to access data from the AOC system. 

7. 

8.  AOC is not liable to LICENSEE for any damages resulting from LICENSEE'S alteration 

or modification of data supplied pursuant to this Agreement, unless AOC made, 
directed, or required such modification or alteration. 

9.  AOC is not liable to LICENSEE or any other party for any loss, including revenue; 

profits; time; goodwill; computer time; destruction, damage, or loss of data; or any other 
indirect, special, or consequential damage that may arise from the use, operation, or 
modification of AOC data extracts. 

B.  Access Limits. LICENSEE'S access to all data extracts provided pursuant to this 

Agreement is subject to the following limits: 

1.  AOC may at any time delay, limit, or deny LICENSEE'S access to the data in the event 
the demand on the system resources for LICENSEE'S access would significantly 
impair the ability of priority users to perform their normal business functions. 
2.  Whenever AOC enters disaster recovery mode for any AOC information system, 

LICENSEE will not have access to data extracts from any AOC information system 
while AOC is operating any information system in disaster recovery mode. 

3.  LICENSEE'S access to extract files may be suspended temporarily in the event of 

system maintenance, system outages, or interruptions of service that does not require 
activation of disaster recovery mode. 

4.  AOC shall make reasonable efforts to provide LICENSEE with prompt written notice of 

any delay, limitation, or denial of access and of its anticipated duration, and will 
promptly notify LICENSEE when full access is again available. 

5.  AOC is not liable for any damages incurred by LICENSEE resulting from any delay, 

limitation or denial of access, or inability to access, referred to in this Article. 

C.  No Warranty. Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, AOC 
makes no warranty whatsoever, of any kind or nature, express or implied, to 
LICENSEE. Without limitation on the generality of the foregoing, AOC specifically 
disclaims any warranty of merchantability or of fitness for a particular purpose with 
respect to any data extract provided pursuant to this Agreement, or with respect to 
the data in any such extract. The AOC also specifically disclaims any warranties, 
express or implied, for any computer programs and associated materials provided 
hereunder, or that the information or data accessed are accurate, correct, or 
complete. 

D.  Limitation of Liability. LICENSEE agrees that any remedy available to LICENSEE 

will be limited to a refund of the purchase price of the license. 

E.  No Assistance to LICENSEE'S Customers. AOC will not provide any support or 

assistance of any kind to LICENSEE'S subscribers or customers. 
 

IV.   LICENSEE'S PAYMENT DUTIES 

A.  Fees and Fee Changes. LICENSEE agrees to pay all amounts due under this 
Agreement, as described in "Attachment A - Extract Fees," appended to this 
Agreement.

received before the extract program is executed. Payment for any compiled extract 
must be made to the "Arkansas Administrative Office of the Courts" at the following 
address: 

Arkansas Administrative Office of the Courts  
625 Marshall Street, Justice Building 
Little Rock, AR 72201 

C.  Performance Bond. LICENSEE agrees to execute a performance bond, as described in 
Article V, Section B, and as provided on form AOC-A-204 (Performance Bond for License 
Agreement), and to be bound by the terms and conditions thereof. Agencies of the State 
of Arkansas are exempt from this performance bond requirement. 

D.  Late Fee. If payment is not received within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice, a late 

fee, as specified in Attachment A, will be assessed and is due and payable immediately upon 
notice from the AOC. 
 

A.  Duties. The following are LICENSEE'S duties. 

V.    LICENSEE'S DUTIES 

1.  LICENSEE shall NOT provide case information or personal information excluded from 

public access by Section VII of Administrative Order 19 to its customers, subscribers, or 
other persons without the express written permission of AOC or a court order. 

2.  LICENSEE shall NOT provide personal identifying information to customers, 

subscribers, or other persons without the express written permission of AOC or a court 
order.    

3.  LICENSEE shall only use case information and personal information excluded from 
public access by section VII of Administrative Order 19 for a scholarly, journalistic, 
political, governmental, research, evaluation, or statistical purpose and will not directly 
or indirectly use that information to sell an individual service to any individual, group of 
individuals, or the general public. 

4.  LICENSEE shall notify AOC in writing when returning or destroying the compiled data 

extract. The date of receipt by AOC of said written notice shall be the date of 
termination of the Agreement for purposes of termination of the performance bond 
pursuant to (B) (6) below. 

B.  Liquidated Damages and Performance Bond 

1.  LICENSEE acknowledges that any breach of its duties may 

a)  Cause it to provide its subscribers and customers with inaccurate data, creating the 
potential for substantial harm to persons whose records are affected and to others 
who rely on those records. 

b)  Cause AOC to incur personnel, technology, and other costs in receiving, 

investigating, and responding to complaints; verifying inaccuracies and identifying 
their source; and enforcing LICENSEE'S compliance with its duties under this 
Agreement. 

c)  Cause AOC to incur further expense in dealing with claims arising from 

LICENSEE'S breach. 

2.  The parties agree that any damages incurred by AOC as a result of any such breach 

are to some extent speculative and difficult to determine after the breach. 

3.  Therefore, in order to avoid litigation concerning the nature and extent of the damages 
resulting from each such breach, to provide AOC with reasonable compensation for 
those damages, to limit LICENSEE'S exposure to an agreed amount, and to provide an 
incentive to LICENSEE to provide only accurate data, for each verified breach of 
LICENSEE'S duties, LICENSEE will pay to AOC, immediately upon AOC's verification 
of the breach, liquidated damages in the amount set out in Attachment A. 

Revised September 28, 2012 

 

Page 5 

Compiled Records License Agreement 

4.  To secure the payment of liquidated damages, as provided in Subsection 3 above, 

LICENSEE, upon the execution of this Agreement, must submit to AOC a completed 
Form AOC-A-204 (Performance Bond for License Agreement).[See Section IV C 
exempting agencies of the State of Arkansas.]  The performance bond in following form 
must be deposited with AOC at the same time: 

A performance bond in the amount specified in Attachment A under 
“Performance Bond”, in the form of a Corporate Surety Bond secured by at 
least one corporate surety, or an irrevocable letter of credit from a federally 
insured financial institution. 

Upon notification to LICENSEE that the AOC has verified a breach of LICENSEE'S 
duties, as described in Section A of this Article, LICENSEE shall immediately pay to the 
AOC the liquidated damages amount indicated in Attachment A to this Agreement. If 
the AOC has not received payment of the liquidated damages within thirty (30) days of 
notice and demand to the LICENSEE, the AOC shall pursue forfeiture of LICENSEE'S 
bond posted pursuant to this Section, of which the enforcement costs, including, but not 
limited to, court costs and attorney fees, shall be borne by LICENSEE. 
In the event of initiation of forfeiture proceedings against LICENSEE'S bond due to 
breach of its duty to pay liquidated damages upon AOC's verification of breach, 
LICENSEE will be required to deposit with AOC a new performance bond, in the 
amount specified in Attachment A, in order to continue access to AOC's extract files. 
If LICENSEE again breaches one or more of its duties under Section V (A)  within two 
years of a previous breach, LICENSEE'S bond will be forfeited and this Agreement will 
terminate. 

5. 

6.  Thirty (30) days after termination of the Agreement under conditions that do not require 

the forfeiture of the bond, the bond will terminate. 

C.  Response to Complaints - Investigation, Suspension, and Termination. LICENSEE 
acknowledges and agrees that reports of errors in data provided by LICENSEE to its 
subscribers or customers or any other failure to comply with LICENSEE'S duties will be 
subject to investigation and response by the AOC, as described in this Section. 
1.  Upon any report or complaint that data provided directly or indirectly by LICENSEE to any 

person are inaccurate, AOC will first investigate to verify the following: 

a)  LICENSEE'S data referenced by the complainant are, in fact, inaccurate; 
b)  The data were obtained from AOC; and 
c)  The data were accurate in the data extract files provided by AOC. 

2.  Upon such verification, AOC will notify one of LICENSEE'S contact persons of the 

inaccuracy, as well as LICENSEE'S duty to pay liquidated damages in the amount set out in 
Attachment A, pursuant to Section B.3 of this Article. These liquidated damages are due and 
payable independent of LICENSEE'S corrective action, as explained in Section C.3 below. 

3.  Upon such notification, LICENSEE will have a reasonable time to correct the inaccuracy. 
Correction may require, in the sole discretion of AOC's Chief Information Officer, 
reapplication of extract files, including, but not limited to, a complete erasure of 
LICENSEE'S records from AOC and restoration of those records from any compiled data 
extracts provided to LICENSEE under this Agreement or purchase of a new compiled 
data extract. 

4.  When AOC is satisfied that LICENSEE'S records are accurate and the data that were the 
source of the complaint have been corrected, AOC will so notify LICENSEE'S contact 
person and the complainant of the correction. Pursuant to Sections B.4 and B.5 of this 
Article, LICENSEE, to continue its access to AOC's extract files, will be required to provide 
a new performance bond if it forfeited its initial performance bond due to breach of its duty 
to pay liquidated damages.

9.

Upon a subsequent report or complaint that data provided by LICENSEE to any person are
inaccurate, AOC will investigate and verify the inaccuracy as provided above.
If  LICENSEE provides inaccurate data within two years of a previous verified inaccuracy,
and the subsequent inaccuracy is verified as provided in Subsection 1, above, this
Agreement will immediately terminate and may not be reinstated.
In order to allow AOC to conduct the investigation and verification provided for in this Article,
as well as random security checks, LICENSEE shall provide to AOC complete records from 
LICENSEE'S database(s), upon receipt from AOC of a list of names or case numbers, as
part of AOC's investigations or security checks.
AOC is under no obligation to notify LICENSEE of any complaint during the course of AOC's
investigation or after its conclusion, should AOC determine that LICENSEE'S data are 
accurate, or that the source of the data was an entity other than AOC.
AOC is under no obligation to identify the specific data that are the source of a
complaint, and may, in fact, be prohibited by law from doing so.

10. Any failure by LICENSEE to comply with an instruction given by AOC pursuant to this

Article will result in immediate termination of this Agreement.

11. By investigating, verifying, and confirming a correction as provided in this Article, AOC 
assumes no obligation to LICENSEE with regard to LICENSEE'S potential liability to a 
complainant or any other person as a result of the dissemination of inaccurate data
under investigation.

VI. LICENSEE'S OTHER DUTIES
A.  Required Disclaimer. LICENSEE shall prominently display a disclaimer in each report of a 
record search provided to a subscriber, with each transfer of data to a customer or other 
person, and at each search access portal made available to a subscriber. The disclaimer

disposition activity on a case. The AOC does not warrant the accuracy of the data. To 
verify a record's accuracy, contact the clerk of the court of record."

customers all of the duties specified in Article V, Section A of this Agreement, as 
well as the duty specified in Section B of this Article.

confidential property of AOC, subject to the proprietary rights of AOC, and is 
provided for the sole internal use of LICENSEE in making use of the data extracts provided 
pursuant to this Agreement. LICENSEE shall hold all proprietary information in the strictest 
confidence. LICENSEE shall exercise at all times the same care with respect to all 
proprietary information that LICENSEE would exercise in the protection of LICENSEE'S own 
proprietary information. LICENSEE shall not release or disclose any proprietary information 
to any other person without the express prior written consent of AOC. 

E.  LICENSEE'S Subsidiaries. As part of this Agreement (see Attachment B), LICENSEE shall 
provide AOC with a list of all of LICENSEE'S websites, subsidiaries that use or distribute 
information obtained from AOC, and all other names by which LICENSEE does business.

addition to the signatory(ies) to this Agreement (if different), permitted to contact the 
AOC on LICENSEE'S behalf for any reason other than reset of a password for the user ID 
of a password administrator, as provided in Section E below. At least one of these contact 
people shall be available to the AOC on weekdays from 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m., Central 
Time, with the exception of legal holidays on which Arkansas state government offices 
are not open. LICENSEE expressly represents that any person designated as a contact person 
is its legal agent with full authority to act individually on LICENSEE'S behalf for 
performance and fulfillment of LICENSEE'S obligations under this Agreement, including, 
but not limited to, notifying the AOC of changes to LICENSEE'S contact information, 
contact persons, and password administrators; receiving any and all notices from the 
AOC under this Agreement; and responding to the AOC's requests for information or 
action from LICENSEE. 

D.  Password Administrators. LICENSEE shall designate up to two (2) password administrators 
in Attachment C. At no time shall there be more than two password administrators for 
LICENSEE. 

E.  Contacts Limited to Password Administrators. LICENSEE'S password administrators are 
responsible for resetting revoked or expired passwords for all user IDs provided to 
LICENSEE pursuant to this Agreement. The AOC Help Desk will reset passwords for no 
user ID provided to LICENSEE pursuant to this Agreement, except for the two user IDs 
assigned to the individual password administrators, and then only upon confirmation 
satisfactory to the AOC that the individual requesting the reset of a password for a 
specific user ID is the password administrator to whom that user ID was assigned by the 
AOC. LICENSEE acknowledges and agrees that it is within the sole discretion of the 
AOC to delay the reset of the password for a password administrator's user ID for a 
reasonable time until AOC Help Desk staff or the Remote Public Access Coordinator is 
satisfied that a request for such reset has originated with the individual password

administrator to whom the user ID in question was assigned by the AOC. This verification 
process may include a demand for a written request from a contact person or signatory to 
this Agreement for reset of the password in question. 

F.  Dual Roles. An individual may be both a contact person and a password administrator for 

LICENSEE, but such individual must be designated separately as both in Attachment C, and 
LICENSEE must provide all information requested for that individual in both roles. 

G.  Change in Information. Any change to LICENSEE'S contact information, contact person 
information, or password administrator information shall be communicated to the AOC by 
any means of communication listed in Section I of this Article. 

H.  Notices to LICENSEE. Any notice or other communication from the AOC to LICENSEE shall 
be deemed sufficient if sent to either contact person or to any signatory to this Agreement 
using the contact information provided in Attachment C, and via any means of 
communication listed in Section I of this Article. 

I.  Notices to AOC. Any notice or other communication from LICENSEE to AOC shall be
