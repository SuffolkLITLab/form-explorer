or violation. 
Offense  Classification:  Indicate  the  class  of  the  felony,  misdemeanor  or  violation  for  which  the 
defendant was convicted.  Class Y, A, B, C, D, or U (unclassified).

criminal  history  score  will  be  the  score  calculated  at  the  time  of  the  original  sentencing.  For 
instance, if the offender had a zero criminal history score at the time he/she was originally placed 
on  probation,  the  criminal  history  score  of  the  revocation  would  still  be  zero.    A  copy  of  the 
Criminal  History  Worksheet  and  instructions  for  completing  the  worksheet  may  be  found  at 
doc.arkansas.gov/sentencing-commission/forms-tips. 
Seriousness  Level:  Indicate  the  seriousness  level  of  offense.  Refer  to  the  manual  entitled 
Arkansas  Sentencing  Commission  Sentencing  Standards  Grid,  Offense  Seriousness  Rankings  and 
Related Material. If the commitment is the result of a probation revocation, the seriousness level 
must  still  be  entered.  Although  the  sentencing  guidelines  are  not  applicable  to  revocations, 
transfer eligibility is still determined by the seriousness level of the offense.

commit the current offense.

county jail (County Jail). Indicate the number of months imposed.   

•  Do not use this space to indicate periods of confinement for a sentence of probation 

plus. 

•  The box for county jail should only be checked when sentencing the Defendant for a 
misdemeanor  offense.    ADC  time  should  not  be  an  imposed  sentence  for  a 
misdemeanor.    If  ADC  time  is  indicated,  the  form  will  be  returned  for  corrections.  
See A.C.A. § 5-4-402 for further explanation on place of incarceration. 

•  Do not include time for Suspended Imposition of Sentence.  For example, a 10 year 
sentence with 5 years suspended and 5 years to serve  would be listed as Imposed 
ADC = 60 months, SIS = 60 months, and total time to serve = 60 months.  

Probation: Indicate the number of months on probation.

manufacturing  methamphetamine  is  subject  to  an  enhancement  for  doing  so  in  the  presence  of 
certain persons, this entry would be as follows: “120 months pursuant to A.C.A. § 5-64-411.”  

Enhancement is to run Concurrent/Consecutive: Indicate if the enhancement is to run 
concurrent or consecutive to the substantive sentence imposed. 

Habitual  Offender:  If  the  defendant  is  sentenced  as  a  habitual  offender  as  defined  in  Arkansas 
Code Annotated § 5-4-501, indicate which subsection applies. 
Victim Information:  Do not enter the name of any victim.  If there is no victim or if the victim is a 
business,  check  not  applicable.    Indicate  if  the  offense  involved  multiple  victims.  If  there  is  only 
one victim per offense, enter the victim information with the offense.  If there are multiple victims 
on one offense, please complete the Additional Victim Information Form.

guilty at a jury trial and sentenced by the court or a jury; or was found guilty of a lesser included 
offense by the court or a jury. 
Sentence  is  a  Departure:  Indicate  whether  or  not  the  sentence  is  a  departure  from  the 
sentencing standards. If yes, the remaining information in this box must be completed.  Departure 
information  is  not  required  if  the  sentence  given  is  a  presumptive  sentence,  the  sentence  is 
recommended by a jury, the sentence is a result of a Probation/SIS Revocation, or the offense is 
not a felony. 
Durational or Dispositional Departure: Indicate if departure is Durational or Dispositional.  A 
durational departure occurs when the imposed months are higher or lower than the presumptive 
ADC time.   A dispositional departure occurs when the type of sanction given (AS, CCC, or ADC) is 
not  listed  as  an  option  for  the  presumptive  sentence.  If  the  sentence  is  a  durational  departure, 
indicate  the  number  of  months  above  or  below  the  presumptive  sentence.  For  example,  if  the 
presumptive sentence is 24-60 months in ADC and the sentence imposed is  120 months in ADC, 
indicate  on  the  form  that  the  sentence  imposed  would  be  60  months  above  the  presumptive 
sentence (120 – 60 = 60).   
Departure  Reason:   Act  423  of  2017  requires  a  "thorough  recitation  of  the  facts"  underlying  a 
departure.  In order to satisfy this mandate, please select at least one of the enumerated departure 
reasons  provided  with  the  Sentencing  Order.   Please  only  select  aggravating  or  mitigating 
reason(s), never both for the same offense.  If "other" is selected, additional information MUST be 
provided in order to satisfy the "thorough recitation of the facts" standard required by Act 423.  
Please provide this information on the line below the boxes for departure reason.  If more space is 
necessary, write "see additional info" and explain in the additional information section on the back 
page  of  the  order.   If  the  additional  information  section  does  not  provide  enough  space,  please 
write "see attached recitation of facts" and attach a sheet of paper explaining the facts underlying

victim requested leniency."

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
