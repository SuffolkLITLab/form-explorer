EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

This Continuity of Operations Plan (Plan) is authorized under the authority of the [name of 
the court] and is one of the preparedness and operations plans (e.g., IT disaster recovery, 
shelter-in-place, critical incident, evacuation plans) used to prevent, prepare for, respond to, 
and recover from a disaster. 

his Plan encompasses the [name the court offices that comprise the ‘‘parent’’ court] and all 

personnel and operations of those court offices. It presents a management framework to 
establish operational procedures to sustain each court office and judicial essential functions if 
normal operations performed at the courthouse(s) or other court related buildings are not 
feasible.  It also guides the recovery and reconstitution of the court’s operations to pre-event 
status, focuses on actions that must be initiated after an incident to ensure continued 
operations of essential functions, and provides for sustained essential functions operations, 
which could be 30 days or more.  The plan recognizes that full recovery and reconstitution of 
the court’s activities may take weeks or months. 

  T

INTRODUCTION 
A broad range of disruptive events have, in recent years, affected court operations and staff at 
the state and federal level.  For this reason this court has an increased focus on emergency 
management, preparedness and response planning, and training. 

Although the [name of court] is not required to adhere to guidance for federal or state 
executive branch agencies, such guidance provides a widely recognized, useful and practical 
foundation for the courts’ planning efforts.  In particular, Federal Preparedness Circular 
(FPC) 65  was used as guidance for COOP planning efforts that are relevant within this court.   

PURPOSE 
The purpose of establishing a COOP plan within this court is to ensure that the capability 
exists for each court office and the court as a whole to respond effectively to a broad array of 
potential operational disruptions.  The key purposes of this COOP plan are to: 

  Ensure continuous performance of essential functions and operations, whether in 
the courthouse, at an alternate site, by telecommuting, or some other electronic 
means. 

  Protect court facilities, equipment, records, and other assets. 

  Reduce or mitigate disruptions to operations. 

 

Identify and designate principals and staff to serve as the Emergency Response 
Team (ERT) to be relocated to alternate facilities or assigned to the primary court 
facility to perform essential functions. 

  Train and cross-train all key personnel responsible for the execution of this plan.

A sudden emergency, such as an explosion, fire, act of violence, or prisoner incident, may 
require the evacuation of a courthouse with little or no advance notice. Courthouse 
evacuation and response to other critical incidents will be accomplished in accordance with 
existing critical incident, evacuation, and other emergency procedures for the building.   

The COOP is not an evacuation plan; rather, it is a deliberate and pre-planned movement 
of designated staff (Emergency Response Team) to an alternate site.  In the event of a 
pandemic, only the Emergency Response Team likely will remain in the court facility to 
ensure delivery of essential functions.  The outline that follows provides an overview of 
the sequence of events for the [insert court] COOP plan activation and execution. 

An Emergency Response Team (ERT), comprised of [insert name of positions e.g., the 
chief justice/judge and court leadership] serves as the leadership group.  This team is 
comprised of an Advance Team responsible for preparing and maintaining the alternate 
site(s) for the arrival of the leadership group and the Essential Functions Team.  The 
Essential Functions Team is responsible for the performance of the prioritized essential 
functions identified in this plan.

Following an incident so severe that the courthouse [courthouse location] is rendered 
unusable or inaccessible, or if such an event appears imminent, the [insert name of position 
e.g., chief justice/judge] will direct the [insert name of court executive position e.g., court 
administrator] to activate the COOP Plan. The [insert name of position e.g., court 
administrator] will notify the [insert name of position e.g., court administrator] in each court 
office that the plan is to be executed. 

Following a decision to activate the court COOP plan, the [insert name of position of court 
executive] and designee will ensure that all judges and office managers are notified, and that 
office managers execute their respective internal alert and notification plans.  Simultaneously 
the [insert name e.g., justices’/judges’] chambers will execute their internal alert and 
notification plans. 

The [insert name of court executive] has the responsibility for the [insert court name] COOP 
Plan execution which includes: 

  Phase I–Activation and Relocation 

  Phase II–Alternate Site Operations 

  Phase III–Recovery and Reconstitution 

Based on alternate site capacity, it is unlikely that all judicial officers and the Emergency 
Response Team will move to the same relocation site. Some [justices/judges] and court 
personnel may be relocated to multiple alternate sites or they may perform the functions from 
home. 

Court personnel who are not part of the Emergency Response Team may be directed to 
remain at home pending further instructions. 

Planning Assumptions 

This plan assumes four basic scenarios that may cause a disruption of normal court 
operations. Examples of these scenarios are contained in Figure 3.  The scenarios are: 

  Courthouse only is affected 

  Courthouse and immediate vicinity are affected 

  Geographic region is affected 

  Pandemic Influenza

Building on these planning scenarios, the plan incorporates the following assumptions: 

 

  The worst-case scenario is the loss of access to [insert court location]. 

  Supreme Court, Courts of Appeal, and the Trial Court COOP Plans will be 

coordinated if the courts are co-located in one alternate site. 

  The Emergency Response Team will be available to provide leadership, and 

continue court office essential functions. 

  The sheriff’s office will provide security to the judges, staff, and court facilities. 

  Once relocated to an alternate site(s), judges will adjust their dockets to assume 

matters from others who may not have survived or are unavailable.  

  Activation of the COOP plan may be required at any time e.g., business hours or 

non-business hours. Following activation, the Emergency Response Team 
members may be required to travel from their home or other non-duty location(s) 
directly to an alternate site. 

  Some or all information and communications systems may be degraded or 

  COOP activation does not affect the pay or benefits of court personnel. 

unavailable 

COOP Plan Phases 

Phase I - Activation 

The COOP plan is activated by a significant event or by the receipt of information regarding 
a credible threat that jeopardizes the safe and continuous operations of the court and/or the 
court’s ability to continue to perform essential functions at the primary facility. The extent 
to which activation will be possible depends on the warning received, whether personnel 
are at the court or another location, and the extent of damage to the affected court facility 
and surrounding areas. 

The following positions, in order of priority, are each authorized to direct responses to 
emergencies including evacuation (partial or total), and closing of court operations: 
[insert names of positions e.g., Chief Justice/Judge, court administrator, clerk of court, 
sheriff, building manager.] 

  Chief Justice/judge 

  Court Administrator 

  Sheriff 

  Building manager 

The positions listed above are referred collectively as the “Leadership Group.” They will 
report to [insert pre-designated location] as they learn of an emergency which may require 
any evacuation or activation of the COOP plan. The team should first report to [insert 

National Center for State Courts

location]; if that site is unavailable the second location is [insert location]; and the third 
location is [insert location]. 

If the disruption or crisis event occurs during office hours and the COOP plan is activated, all 
court personnel will be alerted and notified by [insert position/IT system], and the Emergency 
Response Team will be directed by the [court executive] to relocate immediately to an 
alternate site. Non-essential personnel may be directed to go home or move to other 
designated location(s) to await further instructions.  Each court manager must account for 
personnel within his/her court office. 

If the event occurs during non-office hours, most court personnel will be located at home, 
which also requires alert, notification, and accountability procedures. 

The [court leader] is responsible for communicating with staff so they know what to do, 
where to go, and what to expect. Emergency notification may be communicated through a 
variety of means including: 

  Public announcement system 

  Court website(s) [www.] 

  Electronic mail (email) 

  Recorded telephone messages [telephone #] 

  Public [1 -800 -xxx-xxxx] 

  Announcements on local radio and television outlets.   

  During an emergency, the [court leaders] will continue to keep court personnel 
and the public informed on specific topics using a variety of the mechanisms. 

Initial Actions Following Emergency Notification are as follows: 

 

[Court leader] verifies the availability of a selected alternate site, and notifies the 
host site to expect the arrival of the Emergency Response Team. 

  The team ensures that Go Kits are accessible, complete, (pre-positioned when 

possible) with current documents, supplies, and equipment. 

  The team gathers documents required for the performance of essential functions, 

including checklists. 

  Personnel and the IT team coordinate the immediate transfer of the most recent 

version of essential documents, databases to online system(s) to be accessed from 
the alternate sites.  Essential files may also be transferred to removable storage 
media (flash drive, CDs) or transported in hardcopy. 

  Each court office secures the vacated work areas in the main court facility if 

possible. 

  The sheriff should take appropriate measures to ensure security of staff, 
courthouses, and equipment or records remaining in the courthouse. 

 

If a trial is in progress during an emergency, it may be necessary to relocate all 
individuals, including the jury.

The [Court] COOP plan has [list number of facilities] relocation sites from which essential 
court operations may be conducted.  Because space and support capabilities at these sites are 
limited, the number of personnel to be relocated must be restricted to the Emergency 
Response Team.  Some personnel may move to another site to continue to support essential 
functions, while others may be asked to work from home.  As the crisis situation stabilizes, 
additional essential functions and personnel to support them will be acquired. 

The order in which the Emergency Response Team will relocate to an alternate site is as 
follows: 

  Advance Team 

  Leadership Group 

  Essential Function Team 

 

Phase II – Alternate Site Operations 

Upon arrival at the relocation site, the [name position] will evaluate the capabilities and take 
appropriate action to correct deficiencies and prepare the facility/facilities for the arrival of 
leadership and the essential functions team.  The [name position] disseminates 
administrative and logistics information to arriving court members, who will then move to 
designated spaces and commence essential operations.  As appropriate, court members begin 
to retrieve pre-positioned information and data and activate information, data systems, and 
equipment.  

During COOP plan activation, it is expected that the working hours of the Emergency 
Response Team most will be similar to normal non-emergency periods. Some support 
operations may be required on a 24-hour-per-day, seven-day-per-week basis and work 
schedules will be adjusted accordingly. 

The performance of essential functions is the key focus for operations at the alternate site.  It 
is important to establish priorities prior to an emergency to enable the Essential Functions 
Team to perform essential functions.  To make certain that essential functions continue as 
soon as possible, each court office has identified and prioritized the essential functions, and 
designated those who will perform the functions.  Tasks deemed not essential will be deferred 
until normal operations are feasible.  Resource and staffing requirements, critical data, and 
systems necessary for conducting the essential functions were identified and integrated so 
that essential functions can be performed seamlessly. 

hase III – Recovery/Reconstitution 

  P

Depending  on  the  nature  of  the  emergency  or  disaster,  there  may  be  loss  of  life  and/or 
destruction of physical property, and it may be necessary to rebuild or reconstitute the court. 
The options include: 

  Continue to operate from the current alternate site(s) 

  Begin an orderly phased return to the [courthouse] and pre-event status 

National Center for State Courts 

 

8 

  

  Begin to establish a reconstituted court at another location in [courthouse 

location] 

A recovery and reconstitution procedure commences when the [name position] confirms that 
the emergency has ended and is unlikely to recur.  It is the responsibility of the [name 
position] to ensure coordination of recovery and reconstitution decisions with appropriate 
state and local authorities.  

ECTION 2 - COOP PLAN TEMPLATES  

This section provides a description of operational actions for activation and recovery activities.  
The templates form the completed COOP Plan that provides a combination of detailed and 
operational information critical to the successful implementation of the Plan.    

COOP Plan Elements 

1. Alert and Notification 

This Element sets forth policies and procedures for the formal emergency notification 
to employees through a system or variety of systems that an incident may or has 
occurred.  The alert and notification system also provides response directions to 
employees and external stakeholders regarding acquisition of future information.  The 
systems may include, but are not limited to, an organization’s emergency telephone 
notification system; public announcement system; broadcast email; automated 
telephone messaging; call trees; in person contacts; or use of contracted alert and 
notification services. 

2.  Essential Functions 

Essential functions are those court functions that, if not performed, would result in 
failure of the court or court unit’s mission.  When considering which functions are 
essential, they should be prioritized according to their impact on life, death, and 
freedom (vis-à-vis detention), and those that are required to maintain civil authority 
and public safety.  Each court office/department should identify and prioritize its 
essential functions, and essential functions team including alternates. 

3.  Order of Succession 

Order of succession ensures a seamless court command structure so that all internal 
and external stakeholders always know who is in charge.  While Order of Succession 
and delegations of authority are often closely linked and are considered vital records 
of the court because they identify the leadership or ‘next-in- command’ structure, and 
provide for specific authorities, they do not serve duplicate purposes and should be 
treated separately.  For example, the successors, who most often are in decision 
making positions and effect policy, may not be the same person delegated authority to 
address administrative matters such as payroll or procurement.  Orders of Succession 

  S

should be written and are in effect only until the primary command structure is 
resumed.  

.  Delegations of Authority 

Ensures seamless transfer of leadership decision-making, administrative approval, 
and procurement powers and are limited to the period of COOP Plan activation.  To 
facilitate an immediate response to an emergency situation, the courts should pre-
delegate authority for making administrative decisions at all organizational levels, but 
particularly at the procurement and human resource levels.  Delegations should be 
written and be effective only until the primary authority is resumed. 

.  Alternate Facilities 

With the exception of a pandemic, essential court functions may be relocated to pre-
screened and pre-approved alternate facilities because the primary facility is 
unavailable.  Where necessary, memoranda of understanding should be executed with 
the alternate site managers and updated annually. 

.  Communications 

Notification of COOP Plan activation must be conveyed to external agencies, e.g., the 
public, bar, state, local and federal authorities.  Internal communications involve 
notifying employees that activation of the COOP Plan occurred.  Procedures must be 
established to gather and verify information (situational awareness) to ensure that 
judicial officers and court leadership have credible information on which to base 
decisions.  A designated person(s) should be assigned to disseminate information to 
employees and external constituents to ensure the continuity of message. 

7.  Interoperable Communications  

The ability to communicate with internal (court personnel) and external stakeholders 
(e.g., law enforcement, first responders, emergency management agencies) is 
imperative.  Multiple and redundant technologies should be employed when possible 
because communications failures are inevitable in a disaster. 

.  Vital Records, Databases, and Information Systems 

The protection and availability of vital records, databases, and information systems 
such as orders of succession, delegations of authority, financial, budget, personnel, 
case files, and property and procurement records required to support the court’s 
essential functions.

This Element addresses the plans and procedures that apply to court staff who are not 
directly involved with emergency response teams or operations particularly at an 
alternate facility.  It also addresses available crisis management services and any 
court sponsored network of services for employees and their families.

Element 10 ensures that the capability exists to transfer authority and responsibility 
for essential functions from a specific court office and primary work locations to 
other court personnel in another court or at an alternate facility to sustain that court 
office’s operational capability for an extended period of time if the primary office 
and/or personnel are unavailable or incapacitated. 

11.  Recovery/Reconstitution 

The element lists the steps to return operations to pre-event status.  This may include 
a phased activation of HVAC systems, voice and data systems, mail services, 
personnel, and operational and administrative activities. 

Training encompasses tests of plans and emergency operating procedures, simulated and 
scenario based exercises to rehearse the response plans, and training and education of all 
staff and the ERT.  Training, testing and exercising COOP plan capabilities are necessary 
activities to identify gaps, improve the ability of the court to execute its essential functions, 
train all personnel to create a culture of preparedness, and rehearse plan activation through 
simulated disaster exercises. 

Training 

To maintain a viable COOP plan, court staff will be trained to perform designated 
essential functions at an acceptable level of proficiency, particularly if the essential 
function is not the person’s primary, routine function. Proficiency in COOP plan 
activities is achieved by selecting and training key individuals; then by training the 
group that will be involved in COOP plan activation; and finally, by training the 
court as a whole. Training and educating the entire staff about response plans and 
precautionary activities such as those that relate to security and a pandemic are 
important and help create a culture of preparedness.  The training portion of the 
program includes: 

  An emergency preparedness (including a pandemic) and COOP plan 

awareness workshop for all court staff 

  A COOP plan senior leadership orientation 

National Center for State Courts

raining 

 

 

  T

  A comprehensive readiness program to ensure the preparedness of 

court personnel assigned to carry out essential functions during COOP 
plan activation. 

Tests 

The court will conduct regularly scheduled testing of the court’s plans and 
procedures, equipment and information systems that will support the essential 
functions during COOP plan activation to identify and correct gaps and weaknesses. 
The testing portion of the program provides the following: 

  Quarterly evaluations of “alert systems,” including instructions for 

relocation to pre-designated facilities, with and without warning, and during 
business and non-business hours. 

  Evaluations of the court’s ability to access vital records, information 

systems, and the data management software and equipment necessary to 
perform essential functions. 

  Evaluations of Alert and Notification and communication systems. 

  Evaluations of the support services at the alternate site (e.g., water, 

electrical power, IT infrastructure, and HVAC) at the alternate facility(s). 

Exercises 

Exercises are a variety of simulated disasters designed to keep the COOP plan viable 
and to improve the ability of court staff to execute the plan.  The exercise portion of 
the TT&E program includes: 

  Bi-annual activation of the COOP plan requiring notification and verbal 

walk-through of the activation procedures 

  Annual activation of the court COOP plan for physical relocation to an 

  Annual tabletop exercises for the court staff which also may include select

This long range plan is designed to ensure that adequate resources (e.g., people and equipment) 
necessary to build and strengthen essential functions capabilities are identified and obtained.  
The plan also sets forth the annual COOP plan maintenance schedule to ensure the plan 
remains viable.  Figure 4 sets forth the maintenance schedule.

COOP Plan Templates 

1. Alert and Notification 

This template identifies the specific means to alert and notify staff that a crisis or disaster is 
about to occur, or has occurred, and that the COOP plan was activated.  

Name the person(s), and their position, responsible for initiating the alert and notification 
process and the processes used. (Note:  this could be a public information officer or 
information technology officer, upon direction from the chief justice, coordinating the 
activation of an automatic or electronic messaging system.) Pre-scripted messages are helpful 
in crisis situations because they disseminate the same information and directions to all staff.  

One person should be responsible for the alert and notification activities to ensure 
consistency of information. Messages should provide information about the event and 
instructions to staff and the response teams.  Electronic alert and notification systems should 
be coordinated with the IT staff.  If call trees are used, provide detailed information about 
who initiates the call, the cascade order, and contact information.  Similarly, if a combination 
of methods is used, check that box and describe the combination system in a brief narrative. 

One template may be completed for the overall plan if there is only one Alert and 
Notification system for the entire court (all court offices).  If each court office has a separate 
system, a template should be completed by each office and incorporated into the overall plan.

 2. Essential Functions 

Essential functions are those tasks, functions or activities that, if not performed, would result 
in the court failing to meet its legal and constitution requirements.  Each court office 
completes an essential function template.  For a pandemic, sufficient alternates should be 
identified and trained to perform the essential functions and entered into the template because 
of anticipated high absenteeism (perhaps 40% over 18-24 months). 

Each court office should decide how soon after COOP plan activation (also known as 
recovery time objective) each prioritized essential functions should be available.  Essential 
functions must be ranked according to their priority so the Emergency Response Team 
knows how to prioritize response efforts.  For example, the court offices could categorize 
essential functions according to priority levels with recovery time objectives that are practical 
for each court’s unique situation:  For example, those functions classified as one, may be 
those that impact life, death, safety, and freedom.  The chart below illustrates five priority 
levels:

3. Order of Succession 

Each court unit completes this template to ensure a continuous leadership structure.  Orders 
of Succession should be deep enough to respond to the impact of a pandemic where high 
absenteeism and mortality rates are expected. The order should be written and revert to the 
original leadership when conditions return to the pre-event status.  When feasible, court 
offices and judicial officers should consider successors located in other geographical areas to 
avoid successors being affected by the same disastrous event.

Each court office completes this template to ensure administrative matters are accomplished 
seamlessly.  Delegations should be deep enough to respond to a pandemic.  Contact 
information should include cell phone, home phone, contact information outside the area, 
home email, and work email and phone information.  Delegations should be written and 
revert to the original designee as soon as possible following the event.

At least three alternate sites should be identified.  When possible, two of the sites should be 
located outside the geographical area of the primary facility.  The court should develop a list 
of criteria required for suitable alternate sites (see Tables 1 and 2 in Appendix C), and 
identify the location and logistics of each.  Maps to each site should be provided to the 
Emergency Response Team, and where required, Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) 
should be executed and remain current.

6. Communications  

The overall purpose of the communications and public information effort is twofold:  (1) to 
provide consistent, timely, accurate, and easy-to-understand information to employees, 
lawyers and litigants, building tenants, other courts and external agencies, and to the general 
public during an emergency; and (2) to gather, analyze, and disseminate event information to 
the court’s decision makers.  Communications objectives are to achieve the following: 

  Provide up-to-date information about the impact of the disaster or emergency on 

court operations 

procedures 

  Provide current information on revised or amended court processes and 

 

 

Instill confidence that the courts will continue to function 

Inform the public on the execution of the court’s activities 

  Respond to unsubstantiated rumors with accurate information 

A single point-of-contact should be designated to disseminate information to the Emergency 
Response Team, all employees, the media, public, and external stakeholders.  The following 
templates may be used to capture internal, media, and external contact information.

. Interoperable Communications 

During an emergency and the activation of the COOP plan, communications with external 
agencies and stakeholders will be necessary but may not be available through regular means.  
Redundancy of communications equipment is essential.  Therefore, it is imperative that 
communications devices be interoperable and redundant, internally as well as externally, pre-
programmed with the phone numbers of key internal and external contacts, and that back-up 
interoperable systems are available.  Members of the Emergency Response Team must know 
how to use the devices and store them away from the court facility.  This template provides 
the court with a means to list each device, to whom it is assigned, and with whom it is 
compatible.

  Emergency Operating Records - COOP Plans and procedures for response teams 

  Legal and Financial Records - personnel, payroll, contact, and vendor lists 

  Classified or sensitive data necessary to perform essential functions and activities 

and reconstitute operations 

This template should capture all information about each court office’s vital records,

and any response team support networks.   

o reduce the conflict between family and emergency response team roles and 

responsibilities, the court might consider developing a support network for response team 
families.  The emergency response team members should also be encouraged to develop a 
family support plan.  Programs should also be in place to help staff return to the court 
following a disruption. 

0.  Devolution

Devolution is the process to ensure the capability exists to transfer authority and 
responsibility for essential functions from one court office to another (or one chambers to 
another) in the event the primary office/chambers is unavailable.  In this section, describe the 
process and procedures of how and to whom each court office/judicial officer essential 
functions will devolve. As soon as a catastrophic event renders court facilities and personnel

incapacitated, the devolution plan should address the essential functions that must 
automatically be transferred to a pre-determined office or chambers. 

If a court office or chambers operations are not feasible because of the loss of personnel, 
temporary leadership of the court office or chambers should be passed to a pre-designated 
court office or chambers.  The devolution office and personnel must be capable of supporting 
all the COOP essential functions and activities of the devolving court office.

In this section the court creates a plan to transition from COOP to pre-event status after the 
threat or disruption subsides or ends. Where relocation to an alternate(s) was necessary, the 
procedures should ensure a smooth transition from the relocation site to the original or new 
court facility.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
