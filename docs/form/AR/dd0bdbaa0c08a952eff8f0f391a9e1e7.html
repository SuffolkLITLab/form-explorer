      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre>Covenant Marriage act 2001 
Act  1486  of  2001  created  an  option  for  couples  in  Arkansas  to  choose  a  Covenant  Marriage.    The  couple  entering  into  a 
Covenant  Marriage  agrees  to  be  bound  by  two  limitations  on  obtaining  a  divorce  or  separation  which  do  not  apply  to  other 
couples married in  Arkansas:  The couple agrees to seek marital counseling if  problems develop during the marriage; and  the 
couple can seek a divorce or legal separation only for limited reasons, as set out in the Act and explained in this pamphlet, which 
outlines  the  consequences  of  entering  into  a  Covenant  Marriage  under  Arkansas  law.    Additionally,  couples  bound  by  a 
Covenant Marriage, unless judicially separated, may only sue each other for certain causes of action.  Couples who are already 
married may execute a declaration of intent to designate their marriage a Covenant Marriage.  They must sign a recitation and 
an  affidavit  such  as  the  one  included  in  this  pamphlet,  after  receiving  counseling,  to  which  the  counselor  must  attest.    This 
intent to designate their marriage a Covenant Marriage must be filed with the official who issues marriage licenses in the county 
in which the couple is domiciled. 

EGAL SEPARATION IN A COVENANT MARRIAGE 

In order to obtain a legal separation (which is not a divorce and does not end the marriage), a spouse to a Covenant Marriage 
must first obtain counseling and then must prove: 

) Adultery by the other spouse; 
2) Commission of a felony by the other spouse which results in a sentence of imprisonment of death; 
3) Physical or sexual abuse of the spouse or a child of either spouse; 
4)  The spouses have lived separate and apart continuously without reconciliation for two years; or 
5) Habitual drunkenness for one year, cruel and barbarous treatment or such indignities as to render the 
spouse’s condition intolerable. 

IVORCE IN A COVENANT MARRIAGE 

In a Covenant Marriage a spouse may get a divorce only after receiving counseling and only for the following reasons: 

) Adultery by the other spouse; 
2) Commission of a felony by the other spouse which results in a sentence of imprisonment of death; 
3) Physical or sexual abuse of the spouse or a child of either spouse; 
4)  The spouses have lived separate and apart continuously without reconciliation for two years; or 
5)  The  spouses  are  judicially  separated  and  have  lived  separate  and  apart  continuously  without 
reconciliation since the legal separation for: 
 
 
 

a) Two years and six months if there is a minor child or children of the marriage; 
b) One year if the separation was granted for abuse of a child of either spouse; 
c) Two years in all other cases. 

UITS AGAINST SPOUSES IN A COVENANT MARRIAGE 
Unless judicially separated, spouses in a covenant marriage may only sue each other for causes of action pertaining to contracts, 
for restitution of separate property, for judicial separation, for divorce, for declaration of nullity of the marriage, or for causes of 
action pertaining to spousal support of support or custody of a child while the spouses are living separate and apart, although 
not judicially separated. 

ECLARATION OF INTENT 

In order to enter into a Covenant Marriage, the couple must sign a recitation that provides: 

COVENANT MARRIAGE” 
 
A
We do solemnly declare that marriage is a covenant between a man and a woman who agree to live together as husband and wife for so long as they 
both may live.  We have chosen each other carefully and disclosed to one another everything which could adversely affect the  decision to enter into this 
marriage.   We have received authorized counseling on the nature, purposes, and responsibilities of marriage.  We have read the Covenant Marriage 
Act 94 2001, and we understand that a covenant marriage is for life.  If we experience marital difficulties, we commit ourselves to take all reasonable 
efforts to preserve our marriage, including  marital counseling.  With full knowledge of what this commitment means, we do hereby declare that our 
marriage will be bound by Arkansas law on covenant marriages and we promise to love, honor, and care for one another as husband and wife for the 
rest of our lives.”

fter discussing the meaning of the Covenant Marriage with a counselor, the couple must also sign a notarized affidavit with an 

attestation by the counselor.  The following is the suggested form of the affidavit:

counselor, which marriage counseling included: A discussion of the seriousness of Covenant Marriage; Communication of the 
fact that a Covenant Marriage  is a commitment for life; The  obligation of  a Covenant Marriage  to take reasonable efforts to 
preserve the marriage if marital difficulties arise; and That the affiants both read this pamphlet, developed and promulgated by 
the Administrative Office of the Courts, which provides a full explanation of a Covenant Marriage, including the obligation to 
seek marital counseling in times of marital difficulties and the exclusive grounds for legally terminating a Covenant Marriage by 
divorce or divorce after judgment of separation from bed or board.

Counselor Title/professional credential

the official who issues the marriage license with the couple’s application for marriage license.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
