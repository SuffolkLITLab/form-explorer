Purpose: 

Every person who attends or is present in a circuit or district court proceeding is 
entitled to a safe and secure environment.  An Emergency Response Plan 
establishes policies and procedures to be followed by city, county, and court 
personnel in order to report and respond to critical incidents (fire, severe weather, 
major medical emergencies, etc.). 

Authority: 

II. 
 

Act 576 of 2007 provides that city and county governments adopt and implement 
security and emergency preparedness plans for their circuit and district courts.

B. First Responders:  State and local law enforcement personnel, fire department  
 
 
 
 

personnel, and emergency medical personnel who will be  
deployed to bioterrorism attacks, terrorist attacks, catastrophic or  
natural disasters, and emergencies. 

 
 
 

 

C. Phone Tree:  A prearranged system for activating a group of people by   
 
 
 

telephone. Using the phone tree system can spread a brief message  
quickly and efficiently to a large number of people.   

 
 

D. All Clear:  A spoken or otherwise conveyed message from a First Responder  
 
 

           or Court Facility Administrator that the facility is safe to reenter. 

E. Contact List:  A current list of contact information for those court personnel  
defined as Court Facility Administration.  The list should be in  
 
“chain of command” order.

If you know the source of the water and are confident in your  

ability to stop it, do so cautiously. 

Step 5.  

Take only steps needed to avoid or reduce immediate water  

damage.   

Step 6.  
 
 

If the facility must be evacuated, follow Facility Evacuation  
Procedures.

O. 

Terrorists Events 

  

It is difficult to know with certainty in what form a terrorist event will take place.  
It could be an obvious event involving an explosion and release of hazardous 
materials, or it could involve a covert method, such as mailing letters or packages 
containing hazardous material. 
 
The following are guidelines for generic suspicious activities that should be 
reported: 

  Anonymous tips, phone calls, or notes indicating threatening events. 
  People watching officials or offices. 
  Unidentified or unattended packages. 
  Requests for plans, blueprints, or specifications for facilities by people who have 

no reason for this information. 

  People in places where they do not belong. 
  Packages or heavy mail which has a peculiar odor or appearance. 
  Confrontations with angry, aggressively belligerent or threatening persons. 
  Extremely threatening or violent behavior by co-workers who indicate they may 

resort to revenge or more violence. 

. 

Hazardous Material/Chemical Spill Procedures 

Step 1.  

Remain calm and alert others.  If hazardous materials or toxic  

chemicals come in contact with your skin, immediately flush the  

affected area with clean water. 

Step 2.  

Call 911, or have someone call for you.  Do not call the Haz-Mat  

unit directly; the First Responder will make that determination. 

Step 3.  

If you are contaminated, do not leave the area or let others in. If  

possible, do what you can to contain the spill without endangering  

yourself.   

Step 4.  

Wait for instructions from First Responders.

Q. 

After Hours Emergency Procedures 

  

There is significant chance an emergency may occur outside normal business 
hours.  While the structure of this plan remains precisely the same, its 
implementation may vary depending upon available resources and manpower 
until proper officials can be notified.   
 
Step 1.  

An updated phone contact list of Court Facility Administrators  

should be provided to the alarm company (if applicable), local  

police, sheriff’s, and fire departments. 

Step 2.  

Court Facility Administrators should respond to the facility as soon 

as possible to assess the situation and determine course of action.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
