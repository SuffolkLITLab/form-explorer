DNet Overview 

e are all better able to serve the children and families of Arkansas if we have more accurate and timelier 
information.  DNet is a web-based information system that has been created with a Court Improvement Project 
grant to achieve several purposes: 
 

1.  To enable information sharing between the courts and the Department of Human Services  
2.  To provide timely permanency outcome data to judges and others working in the juvenile court system 
3.  To enable attorneys and judges to efficiently produce court orders 
4.  To collect management information for the attorney ad litem program, the parent counsel program, the 

Office of Chief Counsel, and the CASA program 

5.  To collect more accurate data about processes and outcomes in juvenile court and to reduce duplication 

6.  Increased protection of confidentiality and privacy as documents no longer need to be emailed or sent in 

of data entry. 

other non-secure methods. 

he following basic principles have guided development of this system: 

1.  DNet does not change what information a person may access, but only how it is accessed.  
2.  Privacy and confidentiality are paramount concerns.  For this reason, most users have access only to the 

cases to which they are assigned. 

3.  Wherever possible, check boxes have been provided to speed data entry.  However, text boxes are also 

available (and in some cases, required) so that court orders may be tailored to the needs of the 
individuals involved in specific cases.  

4.  Whoever “owns” the information is responsible for maintaining it. 

5.  DNet is not the official court record, nor is it the official DHS record for information viewable from 

CHRIS.

Security 

rotecting the privacy of individuals and honoring confidentiality are critically important.  The security of any 
system is only as strong as its weakest link, so it is vital that EVERY user of DNet follow the security rules for 
DNet.   

he DNet system does not change what information is available to users, it merely changes how that 

information is accessed. DNet is not the official court record.  It is designed to make information accessible and 
easy to use for parties. All DNet users are required to sign an agreement prior to using the system.   

sers must agree: 

1.  Confidential information may be used only as permitted by applicable state and federal laws, including 
A.C.A. § 12-18-201-209 (Child Maltreatment:  Offenses & Penalties), A.C.A. § 9-27-309 (Juvenile 
Code: Confidentiality of Records), and A.C.A. § 9-28-407 (Juvenile Code: Licenses Required & Issued) 
as well as Arkansas Supreme Court Administration Order 19 (Access to Court Records).   

2.  Any disclosure, use, or attempted use of confidential information for any purpose unrelated to the D-N 

case will be subject to any remedy at law. 

3.  No one with access to DNet may share his or her username or password with anyone for any purpose. 
4.  No one with access to DNet may store his or her username and password together. 
5.  DNet is to be used only: 

a.  to serve or represent a party or a party’s clients in connection with official duties, 
b.  to monitor permanency outcome measures for one’s court or county/area, 
c.  to make administrative reports as required, and 
d.  to produce court orders. 

6.  Any computer, including laptops, used for DNet must have: 

a.  Password protection 
b.  Updated anti-virus software 
c.  Updated anti-spyware software 

encrypted. 

7.  Any documents downloaded from DNet or information collected from DNet shall not be emailed unless 

8.  Care must be taken so that others do not see information on the computer screen.  Don’t leave DNet up 
on your screen when visitors may be able to see it.  When using DNet in court, turn your computer so 
that unauthorized individuals cannot see what is on the screen.  Log off when leaving your computer 
unattended, even for a short time. 

9.  If you suspect ANY security problem such as unauthorized access or a compromised password, contact 

your supervisor and the DNet help desk immediately. 

 security agreement is at the end of this document and must be signed prior to receiving a password.

To generate a report: 
1. Click on the report name.  
2. If you work in more than one district or county, you can select the district or county (arrow #2). The default 

is that you will see information pertaining to all cases for which you are a participant.  

3. If relevant, you can select a date range (arrow #3).  

otes on dates: 

  N

If dates aren't entered for a report that requires dates, it will default to providing information from October 2010 
to present. The system requires dates in the following format: MM/DD/YYYY.  You may find it easier to click 
on the calendar icon to select the date (arrow #4) or to click on "TODAY" which will insert today's date. 
 

     

 

 

 

 

 

 
When you request a report, it is run at that moment from the DNet database. You will get up-to-date 
information, but depending on your internet connection and how much traffic is hitting the database it may take 
up to two minutes to run. Please be patient.
