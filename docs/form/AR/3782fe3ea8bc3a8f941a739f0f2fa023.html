DNet Overview 

 

 

e are all better able to serve the children and families of Arkansas if we have more accurate and timelier 
information.  DNet is a web-based information system that has been created with a Court Improvement Project 
grant to achieve several purposes: 
 

1.  To enable information sharing between the courts and the Department of Human Services  
2.  To provide timely permanency outcome data to judges and others working in the juvenile court system 
3.  To enable attorneys and judges to efficiently produce court orders 
4.  To collect management information for the attorney ad litem program, the parent counsel program, the 

Office of Chief Counsel, and the CASA program 

5.  To collect more accurate data about processes and outcomes in juvenile court and to reduce duplication 

6.  Increased protection of confidentiality and privacy as documents no longer need to be emailed or sent in 

of data entry. 

other non-secure methods. 

he following basic principles have guided development of this system: 

1.  DNet does not change what information a person may access, but only how it is accessed.  
2.  Privacy and confidentiality are paramount concerns.  For this reason, most users have access only to the 

cases to which they are assigned. 

3.  Wherever possible, check boxes have been provided to speed data entry.  However, text boxes are also 

available (and in some cases, required) so that court orders may be tailored to the needs of the 
individuals involved in specific cases.  

4.  Whoever “owns” the information is responsible for maintaining it. 

5.  DNet is not the official court record, nor is it the official DHS record for information viewable from 

CHRIS.

Security 

rotecting the privacy of individuals and honoring confidentiality are critically important.  The security of any 
system is only as strong as its weakest link, so it is vital that EVERY user of DNet follow the security rules for 
DNet.   

he DNet system does not change what information is available to users, it merely changes how that 

information is accessed. DNet is not the official court record.  It is designed to make information accessible and 
easy to use for parties. All DNet users are required to sign an agreement prior to using the system.   

sers must agree: 

1.  Confidential information may be used only as permitted by applicable state and federal laws, including 
A.C.A. § 12-18-201-209 (Child Maltreatment:  Offenses & Penalties), A.C.A. § 9-27-309 (Juvenile 
Code: Confidentiality of Records), and A.C.A. § 9-28-407 (Juvenile Code: Licenses Required & Issued) 
as well as Arkansas Supreme Court Administration Order 19 (Access to Court Records).   

2.  Any disclosure, use, or attempted use of confidential information for any purpose unrelated to the D-N 

case will be subject to any remedy at law. 

3.  No one with access to DNet may share his or her username or password with anyone for any purpose. 
4.  No one with access to DNet may store his or her username and password together. 
5.  DNet is to be used only: 

a.  to serve or represent a party or a party’s clients in connection with official duties, 
b.  to monitor permanency outcome measures for one’s court or county/area, 
c.  to make administrative reports as required, and 
d.  to produce court orders. 

6.  Any computer, including laptops, used for DNet must have: 

a.  Password protection 
b.  Updated anti-virus software 
c.  Updated anti-spyware software 

encrypted. 

7.  Any documents downloaded from DNet or information collected from DNet shall not be emailed unless 

8.  Care must be taken so that others do not see information on the computer screen.  Don’t leave DNet up 
on your screen when visitors may be able to see it.  When using DNet in court, turn your computer so 
that unauthorized individuals cannot see what is on the screen.  Log off when leaving your computer 
unattended, even for a short time. 

9.  If you suspect ANY security problem such as unauthorized access or a compromised password, contact 

your supervisor and the DNet help desk immediately. 

 security agreement is at the end of this document and must be signed prior to receiving a password.

op-up blockers:  Some pages of DNet require your pop-up blocker to be disabled.  To do this in Internet 
Explorer, look in your toolbar for the “tools” menu, then choose “Pop-up Blocker” and “Pop-up Blocker 
Settings.” 

 

hen you click on “Pop-up Blocker Settings,” a pop-up box will appear.  In the space labeled “Address of

Adding Case Participants 

here are two choices for where to add people important to the case.  Those who are party to the case, their 
attorneys, and CASA volunteers/staff should be listed as case participants.  Case contacts are those who are not 
officially part of the case but whose information you want to keep handy.  This might include other relatives, 
foster parents, or a teacher.  Anyone with access to the case will be able to see the case contacts page. 

he parents, children, FSW, and DCFS supervisor are brought over from the CHRIS system.  You may need to 

add other individuals.  Please note that there must be a judge on the case to be able to add hearings.   

lick on “Add participants.”  When you do, this screen will appear. 

udge:  If the judge is an active (not retired) judge in that county, use the judge search.  If the judge is a special 
judge, follow the procedures for finding an attorney, and then select “special judge” for participant type. 

ttorneys:   If an attorney needs to be added, click on attorney search.  You can find the attorney based on name 

or bar number.  The more information you have (including the city, for example), the quicker the search is 
likely to be.  When entering the bar number, include AR in front of the number.

Once you’ve entered the information, click on the search button.  When you see the correct attorney, click on 
the bar number in the ID column.  The bar number is the official identifier for attorneys in the DNet system. 

lease note: multiple addresses may come up.  Choose the office address of the attorney.   

or attorneys, the participant role must be entered using the dropdown menu.  Also enter the start date using the 

calendar, make sure the address is correct, and click “add.”   

dd any other attorneys to the case. 

ther participants:  Adding other participants to the case is also easier the more information you have.  For 

adults, the system is searching drivers’ records.  The ID number is the Driver’s License Number.  In this 
example, we will add the CASA volunteer.

he less information you entered, the more records you’ll have to look through.  In this example, I entered 
Robinson as the last name and Dian% as the first name.  This is a good strategy if you're not sure how the first 
name is spelled (could be Diann, Dianne, Diane). The % is a "wild card" character.  In this case, it brought up 
90 individuals, two of them with all information identical except for address.   

f you are searching by name and it is a common name, it will bring up many responses.  If this happens, you 
can page through the records using “next,” “previous,” or by using the drop down menu.  Do NOT guess on the 
person if you are not sure.

In this case, I know the correct one and can click on the ID number.  For people you work with frequently 
keeping their ID numbers (driver’s license) handy might save you some time.  In that case, just enter the 
Driver's License number in the ID box. 

hen you have identified the person, click on their ID number.  You’ll then need to add their role using the 

dropdown box and add the start date, either by typing it in or clicking on the calendar, and click “add.”   

mportant points regarding case participants 

-  When viewing the case participants, you can sort the list by participant type, start date, or end date.  

- 

- 

- 

Simply click the heading you wish to sort by. 
If there are more than 10 case participants, they will not all display on the first page.  Click on the Next 
button at the bottom of the list of case participants. 
If a minor mother is both a parent and a juvenile in the same case, she should be entered twice: once as a 
parent and once as a juvenile. 
If a parent’s rights have been terminated, it is critical to enter an end date for that parent (and associated 
parent counsel) when the termination happens. 

-  You can add interveners, secondary caseworkers, adoption specialists, or ILP coordinators as 

participants to the case as needed.

Removing or Changing Case Participants 
Associating Parties 

nding a participant on a case:  It is very important to put an “end date” for anyone no longer involved in a 

case.  Examples might include when an attorney leaves or changes caseload, when a judge steps down, or when 
a parent’s rights are terminated. 

ssociating participants: Attorneys/clients and parents/children should be associated in DNet.   

n the case overview page, click on the edit button to the right of the end date column. 

his will bring up this page, where you can enter the end date.  If you are entering an end date for a juvenile on 

the case, you’ll also need to enter a reason (see the section on closing a case).

Putting an end date does the following: 

 

 

 

  The person will no longer be able to access the case in DNet. 
  The person will not show up on the list of people attending hearings for any future hearings. 
  The person will not appear on any other pages for hearings after the end date, including on the orders 

pages or on the notice section. 

f someone’s role in the case changes, you must put an end date to her first role, and then enter her as a “new” 
participant with their new role in the case. 

dding a new judge to a case: If the judge on a case changes, you must enter a new judge when you put an end 

date for the previous judge or you will not be able to access hearing pages.  When adding a judge, follow the 
instructions for adding an attorney, but select “judge” for participant role.  

The same page allows you to associate parties. 
 

 

imply click on the parties who should be associated. In this case, it is the page for the attorney ad litem, whose 
name is at the top, so I clicked the juveniles she represents.  Then click "Save Party Associations."  This should 
be done to associate attorneys ad litem and parent counsel with clients and also to associate parents with 
children.

Case Contacts 
 
The case contacts is a text field in which you can add names, addresses, email addresses, or phone numbers of 
anyone else useful to the case.  All participants to the case will be able to see this field.  Individuals in the case 
contacts section will not receive any sort of notifications from the system, however, and they will not appear as 
potential attendees at a hearing.  Using this feature is optional.

Uploading documents 

ourt orders must be uploaded to the system.  Other documents may be uploaded for the convenience of the 

parties to the case, but are not required. 

here are three places to upload documents into DNet.  The first is the "Court Orders" section, which is the 
required one.  The second is "Admitted Documents," and the third is "Shared Documents."  The judge will be 
able to see documents only in the "Court Orders" and "Admitted Documents" sections but will not be able to see 
those in the "Shared Documents" section.  All other individuals assigned to the case and who have either DNet 
or CHRIS access will be able to see any uploaded document. 

 

 

ll documents should be uploaded as PDF files.  See information in the next section about creating PDF files. 

To upload court orders, click on the "upload" button in the "Court Orders" box.  This screen will appear:

All court orders must be associated to a specific hearing.  Click the down arrow next to Hearing Types to select 
the type of hearing, then click the appropriate related hearing date.  The hearing MUST have been entered into 
DNet prior to associating an order!  Once the hearing type and date have been selected, choose the PDF file 
from your computer using the "browse" button.  Include a few words to describe the document, and click 
upload.  Once the document is successfully uploaded, the name will appear in a table on the screen.  Click 
"Finish" to return to the case overview.  If you have an agreed order, connect it to the most recent hearing and 
indicate in the abstract box that it is an agreed order after the hearing. 

dmitted documents include any documents admitted as evidence to the case.  Click on "Admitted Documents."  

The following screen will appear: 
 

hoose the document sub-type (petition, evidence, other), then enter the date the document was admitted. 

 

 

lick browse, find the PDF document on your computer, click upload, and then finish. 

he "Shared Documents" section is for documents you may wish to share with others prior to a court hearing.

Creating PDF Files 

 

 

pload all documents as PDF files.  There are at least four ways to create a PDF file 
1.   Use Adobe Acrobat. 
2.   If you have Microsoft Office 2010 or later, first save your document as a Word document.  Then choose 

"save as" and select PDF as the type.  This will not be editable, which is why it's so important to first save 
it as a Word document! 

3.   Scan a document (recommended for documents with original signatures, such as court orders) and save it 

4.   Use a program such as “doPDF” available free online.  With this program, go to the print menu, and select 

to your computer. 

“doPDF” as the printer and click “OK”.

Adding a Hearing 

 

 

dding a hearing in DNet does the following things: 

  Allows participants to update hearing information. 
  Adds the hearing to your calendar on the main page of DNet. 
  Sends the hearing date, time, and type to the CHRIS system so that FSWs can see it. 

For these reasons, it is important to add a hearing to DNet as soon as it is scheduled. 

To add a hearing: 

-  From your case list, choose the case you want to work on.  This brings you to the case overview page. 
-  From the case overview page, click “add hearing.”

type).  If the adjudication and disposition are held as two separate hearings, enter them as separate hearings.  
Use the disposition hearing type for the second hearing. 

 

nter the date of the hearing and the start time of the hearing.   

lick “add hearing”.  You will then go back to the case overview page. 

pecial note: if two hearing types are being held simultaneously, enter two hearings with same date but with 
the time different by 15 minutes.  For example, if the PPH and TPR are being held simultaneously at 1 p.m., 
enter the PPH hearing at 1 p.m. and the TPR hearing at 1:15 p.m.

Education/Visitation (this tab is OPTIONAL)  

 

 

 

he Visitation section looks the same regardless of the hearing type.  The education portion appears beginning 

at the adjudication hearing.  Once it is completed, it will not change unless a case participant changes it: the 
default will be that it is unchanged from the previous hearing. 

ne warning: once it is changed, it does not keep a history of what was entered previously.  You would need to 

go back and look at the relevant court order to see the history. 

ducational permissions are specific to the parent and child and must be completed for each. These include 

-  Whether the parent can learn the child’s placement from school records,  
-  Whether the parent can make decisions for the child under IDEA, 
-  Whether the parent may participate in school activities, 
-  And whether the parent may view school records.

hours weekly with father.” in the text box, it would appear in the order as: “The 
Court finds the visitation plan is appropriate for the juvenile(s) and the parent(s) 
and the siblings, if separated.  Specifically, visitation shall be:  
supervised for two hours weekly with mother, unsupervised for two hours weekly 
with father.”

that child does not have visitation with anyone.

same text for more than 
one child, type it in the 
first box, then highlight 
it and press Ctrl c.  
Then click in the next 
box and press Ctrl v. 

If a parent’s rights have been terminated and the judge has ordered a goodbye visit, put that in the visitation text 
box.  It might read something like, “The mother shall have a goodbye visit, lasting no more than one hour, in 
the presence of the children’s therapist.” 

he visitation section is specific to the juvenile.  Complete the text box, which will go into the court order 

exactly as it is written, following the sentence: “The Court finds the visitation plan is appropriate for the 
juvenile(s) and the parent(s) and the siblings, if separated.  Specifically, visitation shall be:”

there are different options for the noncustodial parent, which means noncustodial before the case began, and the 
parent/guardian from whom the child was removed.  Please do not use the option "OTHER" if you can possibly 
avoid it.  If you are uncertain what reason to use, please contact Jeff Cotton (jeff.cotton@arkansas.gov).

Special Notes 

 

 

equired Fields 

Certain fields are required in DNet.  These are: 

-  County, filing date, docket number, case name 
-  Parties to the case 
-  Date and type of each hearing and whether it was held. 
-  Findings of hearings  
-  Case goals 
-  Closing reason and date 

 
Data Exchange 
The information exchange will occur at the following times: 

9:00 a.m. 
12:00 p.m. 
3:00 p.m. 
11:00 p.m.   

This means that any information entered into CHRIS at 8 a.m. would be able to be viewed in DNet after 9 a.m.  
Any information entered into CHRIS at 9:45 a.m. would be viewable in DNet after noon. 

If you get an error that starts with “ORA,” please contact the help desk. It will be most helpful if you do a 
screen print of the screen with the error and send the screen print.  To do a screen print, look for a key with 
“PrtSc” or “PrtScn” on your keyboard.  It’s usually in the upper right section, and you’ll need to hold the “Ctrl” 
key while pushing the “PrtScn” key.  Then go to your word processing program, open a new document, and 
press “Ctrl” and the “V” key to paste the screen shot in 

This system is not yet connected with the Court of Appeals, so this will have to be entered and maintained by 
one of the case participants. 

If a FINS case becomes a dependency-neglect case, then it needs to be initiated as such in CHRIS.  If the child 
is placed in foster care it will come over to DNet as a new removal and we can initiate the case.  If the child is 
not placed in foster care, then you can “call” the case by putting in the CHRIS ID on the case initiation page.
