counsel of record for that party in this court, except where 

(A) the notice of appeal contains a statement indicating that counsel has not been 
retained for purposes of appeal, or 

(B) counsel who filed the notice of  appeal was  assigned in the  court of original 
instance, and that assignment has not been extended to the appeal by statute, order 
or rule.

in connection with any cause or matter pending in this Court. 

 

 

(4) Counsel of record may be changed by: 

(A)  The  filing  of  a  consent  to  change  attorney  or  substitution  of  counsel  in  this 
Court  which  is  on  notice  to  all  parties,  executed  by  both  counsel  of  record  and

party; or 

(B) By successfully moving this Court for permission to withdraw as counsel.

670.2   Settlement or Withdrawal of Motion, Appeal or Proceeding; Notice of Change in 
Circumstances

(1)  A  stipulation  withdrawing  an  appeal  or  proceeding  which  has  been  placed  on  the 
Court’s calendar must be filed with the court prior to the calendar date. Absent such a stipulation, 
an appellant may, prior to the calendar date, move for permission to withdraw such an appeal or 
proceeding.      

2)  An  appeal  which  has  been  placed  on  the  court’s  calendar  cannot  subsequently  be 
withdrawn  based  upon  a  settlement  which  occurred  prior  to  the  calendar  date,  except  upon  a 
showing of good cause.  

3) An application for permission to withdraw an appeal subsequent to the calendar date 
must be supported by (i) a stipulation withdrawing the appeal, (ii) documentation which establishes 
when  the  event  upon  which  the  withdrawal  is  based  occurred,  and  (iii)  where  appropriate,  an 
explanation regarding why there was a delay in notifying the court of that event.  Such applications 
shall be granted only in limited circumstances and upon a showing of good cause.  

(b)    Notice  of  Change  of  Circumstances.  For  the  purposes  of  section  1250.2(c)  of  the  Practice 
Rules of the Appellate Division (22 NYCRR § 1250.2[c]), settlement includes, but is not limited

one copy, and serve one copy, of the papers referred to in section 1250.3(a) of the Practice Rules 
of the Appellate Division (22 NYCRR §1250.3[a]). 

(2) Where an appeal is taken in a criminal matter, the clerk of the court of original instance 
shall execute an initial information statement on a form approved by the court and shall transmit 
it together with a copy of the notice of appeal and the order of sentence and commitment, if any, 
to the clerk of this court. 

 
(3)  An  initial  informational  statement  relating  to  attorney  matters  shall  be  filed  in 
connection with attorney disciplinary proceedings instituted in this court and applications made to 
this court pursuant to sections 690.17 and 690.19 of the rules of this court. 

(4)  In all other actions or proceedings instituted in this court, and applications pursuant to 

 
CPLR 5704, an initial informational statement shall be filed.

under the provisions of CPLR 214-g, counsel for the appellant shall so indicate in the “Case Type” 
section of the informational statement.  The clerk of the court from which the appeal is taken shall 
notify  this  Court  when  transmitting  such  an  informational  statement  to  this  Court  pursuant  to 
section 1250.3(a) of the Practice Rules of the Appellate Division (22 NYCRR 1250.3[a]). 

(b)  Active Management.   

(1)  The following appeals shall be actively managed: 

 

 

(a)  All appeals from orders of the Family Court, and any other proceedings in which 
the welfare, custody or parental access of children is at issue; and 

(b)  All appeals from orders and judgments issued in actions commenced under CPLR 
214-g. 

(2)    In  all  actively  managed  matters,  the  clerk  shall  issue  a  scheduling  order  or  orders 
 
directing the parties to take specified action to expedite the prosecution thereof, including but not 
limited  to  the  ordering  of  the  transcript  of  the  proceedings  and  the  filing  of  proof  of  payment 
therefor,  the  making  of  motions,  the  perfection  of  the  cause,  and  the  filing  of  briefs.  
Notwithstanding any of the time limitations set forth in this part or Part 1250 (22 NYCRR 1250), 
a scheduling order shall set forth the date or dates on or before which such specified action shall 
be taken. 

 
(3)    If  any  party  shall  establish  good  cause  why  there  cannot  be  compliance  with  the 
provisions of a scheduling order, the clerk may amend the same consistent with the objective of 
insuring expedited prosecution of the cause.  An application to amend a scheduling order shall be 
made  by  letter,  addressed  to  the  clerk,  with  a  copy  to  the  other  parties  to  the  cause.    The 
determination  of  the  clerk  in  amending  or  declining  to  amend  a  scheduling  order  shall  be 
reviewable by motion to the court on notice pursuant to section 1250.4 of the Practice Rules of the 
Appellate Division (22 NYCRR § 1250.4). 

 
(4)  Upon the default of any party in complying with the provisions of a scheduling order, 
the clerk shall issue an order to show cause, on notice, why the cause should not be dismissed or 
such other sanction be imposed as the court may deem appropriate. 

(c)  Pre-Perfection Civil Appeals Management Program  

(1) The court, in those cases in which it deems it appropriate, shall issue a notice directing 
 
the attorneys for the parties and/or the parties themselves, as well as any other individual whose 
attendance the  court may  require, to  attend  a pre-perfection  conference  before a Justice of this 
court  or  such  other  person  as  it  may  designate,  to  consider  the  possibility  of  settlement,  the 
limitation  of  the  issues,  and  any  other  matters  which  the  designated  Justice  or  other  person 
determines may aid in the disposition of the appeal or proceeding.  

(2)    Requests  for  adjournments  shall  be  addressed  to  the  Pre-Perfection  Civil  Appeals 
 
Management Program Administrator.  Such requests shall be determined by the Administrator or 
Special Referee designated to conduct the conference, whose determination shall be final.  Absent 
unusual circumstances, no adjournment shall be granted unless requested at least three business 
days prior to the scheduled date.   

   

 

4 

(3)  Pre-perfection  conferences  shall  be  deemed  appearances  before  this  court.    Any 
attorney or party who, without good cause shown, fails to appear for a regularly scheduled pre-
perfection  conference,  or  who  fails  to  comply  with  the  terms  of  a  stipulation  or  order  entered 
following  a  pre-argument  conference,  shall  be  subject  to  the  imposition  of  such  costs  and/or 
sanctions as the court may direct.   Pre-perfection conferences shall constitute actual engagements 
before this court for the purposes of Part 125 of the Rules of the Chief Administrator of the Courts 
(22 NYCRR Part 125). 

(d) Mandatory Civil Appeals Mediation Program 

(1)  Establishment, Purpose and Scope of Program 

The Appellate Division, Second Department hereby establishes a Mandatory Civil Appeal 
 
Mediation Program (the Program).  Appeals from orders of the Family Court are excluded from 
this requirement, provided, however, that counsel and the parties to perfected Family Court appeals 
involving the custody of, or access to, children may jointly request, by letter application to the 
Clerk of the Court, that the particular appeal be designated for mediation. 

   

 

(2)  Mandatory Mediation; Notice of Reference  

(i)  The Clerk of the Court shall cause civil appeals which have been perfected to 

 
be designated for mandatory mediation.  

 
(ii)  Upon such designation, the Clerk of the Court, shall cause to be issued a Notice 
of Reference, which shall direct the parties to the appeal and their counsel, as well as any 
other individual whose attendance the court may require, to attend an initial, ninety-minute 
session, without charge, before a designated Special Master identified in that Notice. The 
Notice of Reference shall set forth the date, time, and place of the initial mediation session.  
Counsel  with  knowledge  of  the  matter  on  appeal  and  who  is  prepared  to  engage  in 
meaningful  settlement  discussions  and  parties  who  are  natural  persons  are  required  to 
attend the mediation in person.  In the event that a party is not a natural person but a legal 
entity, such as a corporation or limited liability company, such entity is required to have 
present at the mediation a representative of the entity who has the authority to make binding 
decisions on behalf of the entity.    

 
(iii)  Parties and counsel who wish to continue mediation beyond the initial ninety-
minute session may continue that session or schedule additional sessions as agreed upon 
with the Special Master.  Special Masters shall be entitled to receive such compensation 
from the parties for such continued or additional sessions as may be agreed upon in writing, 
provided  that  the  initial  session  shall  remain  free-of-charge.    At  the  conclusion  of  the 
mediation the Special Master shall not serve in any other capacity relative to the litigation 
that was the subject of the mediation without the consent of the parties. 

(iv)  Requests for adjournments shall be addressed by e-mail to the Special Master, 
 
with copies sent simultaneously to all counsel or unrepresented parties.  Such requests shall 
be determined by the Special Master, whose determination shall be final.  Absent unusual 
circumstances,  no  adjournment  shall  be  granted  unless  requested  at  least  three  business 
days prior to the scheduled date.  In no event may the initial mediation be adjourned more 
than three (3) times or for a total of more than 30 days. 

 
(v)  Mediation sessions shall be deemed appearances before this court.  Failure of 
the parties to the appeal and/or their counsel with knowledge of the matter on appeal who 

is prepared to engage in meaningful settlement discussions to appear or to appear on time 
may result in the imposition of sanctions pursuant to Part 130 of the Rules of the Chief 
Administer  of  the  Courts  (22  NYCRR  Part  130).    The  initial  mediation  session  shall 
constitute an actual engagement before this court for the purposes of Part 125 of the Rules 
of the Chief Administrator of the Courts (22 NYCRR Part 125).    

 
(vi)  At least five (5) business days prior to the initial session, counsel to the parties, 
or a self-represented party, shall provide the Special Master with copies  of the order or 
judgment appealed from, the decision of the trial court, the briefs or memoranda submitted 
by  the  parties  to  the  trial  court,  the  briefs,  if  any,  filed  with  this  court,  and  any  other 
information necessary for the effective negotiation and resolution of the issues involved.  
The  Special  Master  may  request  a  conference  call  with  both  counsel  regarding  any 
preliminary matters. 

 
(vii)  Within five (5) business days after the conclusion of the mediation sessions, 
the Special Master shall send a Report (“Report of the Special Master”) to the Clerk of the 
Court and to counsel for the parties stating the date of the initial session and whether each 
party and counsel appeared at the initial session, the dates of any subsequent scheduled 
sessions, whether the parties reached partial, complete, or no agreement on the issues, and 
whether a stipulation of withdrawal of the appeal has been executed.  The Special Master 
shall not disclose any other information discussed during the Mediation to the court, and 
the use of any such information is subject to CPLR § 4547  

(3)   The Role of the Court 

 
The Program is conducted under court auspices and pursuant to these rules.  The pendency 
of mediation will not affect, or delay, the progress of the appeal on the court’s calendar.  Unless 
an agreement is reached in mediation and the appeal is wholly or partially withdrawn, the appeal 
will  proceed  in  accordance  with  the  regular  processes  of  the  Court  and  will  be  heard  and 
determined.  

(4)  The Roster of Special Masters 

 
The Clerk of the Court shall maintain a list of approved Special Masters.  It shall consist 
of individuals who the Presiding Justice of this court has concluded possess the requisite training 
and  experience  as  well  as  the  appropriate  temperament,  character,  and  discretion.      Approved 
Special Masters may be add to and removed from the Roster of Special Masters at the discretion 
of the Presiding Justice. 

 

(5)  Immunity 

 
Special  Masters  serving  in  this  Program  shall  be  immune  from  suit  as  a  result  of  any 
conduct or omission during the performance of duties in that capacity to the extent permissible by 
law. 

 
(1)  Notice.  To the extent practicable, the notice required by section 1250.4(b)(2) of the 
Practice Rules of the Appellate Division (22 NYCRR § 1250.4[b][2]) shall be accompanied by a

lack of success.  If the applicant is unwilling to give notice and/or to make the required service, 
the affidavit or affirmation shall state the reasons for such unwillingness. 

 
(2)  Oral argument.  Where the notice required by subdivision (1) has been given, the party 
seeking relief and/or the party opposing the relief sought may request the opportunity to present 
argument  to  the  justice  to  whom  the  application  will  be  presented,  which  request  shall  be 
determined in the discretion of that justice. 

(b)  Permission to Appeal to the Appellate Division in a Civil Matter.  A motion for permission to

is effectuated pursuant to the Electronic Filing Rules of the Appellate Division (22 NYCRR Part 
1245), no hard copy submission shall be made unless requested by the Court. Exempt attorneys

propriety,  or  excessiveness  of  sentence,  the  appeal  may  be  prosecuted  by  submitting  a  concise 
statement setting forth the reasons urged in support of the reversal or modification of sentence.  
Such statement shall contain the information required by CPLR 553l and by section 1250.8(b)(3) 
of the Practice Rules of the Appellate Division (22 NYCRR § 1250.8[b][3]) and shall contain a 
statement by counsel for the appellant that no other issues are asserted. 

 
(l)  Such appeals may be brought on as though they were motions made in accordance with 
the provisions of section 1250.4 of the Practice Rules of the Appellate Division (22 NYCRR § 
1250.4) and shall be placed upon a special calendar for appeals submitted in accordance with this 
subdivision.  The respondent shall serve and file papers in opposition within l4 days after service 
of the motion papers. 

 
(2)  The  appellant  shall  submit  the  transcript  of  the  sentence  proceeding  and  of  the 
underlying plea or trial.  The parties shall file an original and one digital copy of their respective 
papers, including the necessary transcripts.

670.15   Calendar Preference; Calendar Notice; Oral Argument; Post-Argument 
Submissions 

a)  Oral Argument.  A maximum of 15 minutes shall be allowed for argument to each attorney 
who has filed a brief, except as set forth in subdivision (b). 

(b)  Argument Proscribed.  Argument is not permitted on issues involving maintenance; spousal 
support;  child  support;  counsel  fees;  the  legality,  propriety  or  excessiveness  of  sentences; 
determinations made pursuant to the sex offender registration act; grand jury reports; and calendar 
and  practice  matters  including  but  not  limited  to  preferences,  bills  of  particulars,  correction  of 
pleadings, examinations before trial, physical examinations, discovery of records, interrogatories, 
change of venue, and transfers of actions to and from the Supreme Court.   

(c)  Who May Argue.  Not more than one attorney shall be heard for each brief filed unless, upon 
application made in writing at least seven days before the matter appears on the court’s calendar, 
the court shall have granted permission to allow more than one attorney to argue. 

(d)  Adjournment of Oral Argument.  After filing a brief and until a matter has been placed on the 
court’s  calendar,  counsel  shall  advise  the  court,  in  writing  and  on  a  continuing  basis,  of 
commitments that will interfere with counsel’s ability to appear on a particular date.  Requests for 
leave to adjourn oral argument of an appeal or proceeding which appears on the court’s calendar 
are  strongly  disfavored.    Such  requests  may  be  granted  only  where  unusual  circumstances  are 
present, as explained in a writing in which counsel indicates why he or she cannot appear for oral 
argument,  why  no  other  attorney  can  appear  in  his  or  her  place,  and  why  oral  argument  is 
necessary.  Requests for leave to adjourn oral argument of an appeal or proceeding are within the 
discretion of the court. 

(e)  Submission.  A party who originally elected to argue may notify the clerk of the intention to 
submit the cause without argument and need not appear at the call of the calendar. 

(f) Rebuttal.  Rebuttal argument shall not be permitted, except with leave of the court given at the 
time of argument.   

(g)  Citations to Recent  Authority.  After a cause has been placed on the calendar and prior to 
argument or submission of that cause, any party who previously submitted a brief may inform the 
court by letter, a copy of which is contemporaneously provided to the other parties to the appeal, 
of the citation to any decisions, statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, or other similar matter not 
previously  cited  in  that  party’s  brief  which  arose  subsequent  to  the  filing  thereof,  without 
additional argument.  Except for good cause shown, the court will not accept precedent at the call 
of the calendar where a copy thereof has not previously been given to the other parties.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
