      <pre>SUPREME COURT, CIVIL BRANCH 
QUEENS COUNTY 
COURT HELP CENTER 

NOTE:  All persons involved in a legal action should consult an attorney.  Neither 
the Office of Public Information nor any member of the court's staff may give you 
legal advice, prepare your papers or act as your attorney. 

To properly answer a motion, you must take the following steps: 

HOW TO ANSWER A MOTION 

1. 

Write  answering  papers,  also  referred  to  as  opposing  papers.    These 
papers  consist  of  a  copy  of  your  affidavit  in  opposition  with  exhibits  attached  and 
lettered e.g. A,B etc.; a memo of law (optional); and a litigation cover (also called a blue 
back). 

2. 

Have copies of the answering papers served upon all other parties to the 

case. 

3. 
4. 

Obtain affidavits of service. 
Submit  the  original  answering  papers  to  the  court,  with  affidavits  of 
service attached.  This is done at the time and place indicated in the Notice of Motion or 
Order to Show Cause.  Below are details for each of these steps. 

1.  PREPARING THE ANSWERING PAPERS 

Answering papers must include an "affidavit in opposition."  This affidavit must be 
carefully  written  and  organized,  since  motions  (unless  Temporary  Restraining  Orders 
TRO's for short are involved) are usually decided "upon the papers," which means that 
the parties will not appear personally in court to present their arguments. 

After  it  is  written,  an  affidavit  in  opposition  must  be  notarized.    Any  exhibits 
(documents which support your position) must be attached to the affidavit.  The exhibits 
must be labeled Exhibit A, Exhibit B, and so forth.  Exhibit tabs are recommended; they 
may be purchased at any legal stationery store. 

If appropriate, you may submit affidavits of other people together with your affidavit 
in opposition.  For example, a person with personal knowledge of issues raised by the 
motion  may  provide  you  with  an  affidavit  to  support  your  allegations.    This  is  only 
appropriate, however, where the person submitting the affidavit has first-hand knowledge 
of the dispute.  Affidavits by  well-meaning friends, politicians, and others who have no 
firsthand knowledge of the issues will likely only hurt, not help your case, and should be 
avoided. 

Any legal, as opposed to factual issues, raised by the motion should be addressed 
(presented) in a separate memo (referred to as a "Memorandum of Law").  If the moving 
party (your opponent in the case) has submitted a Memorandum of Law, you should go 
to  a  law  library  (one  is  located  at  the  main  courthouse  88-11  Sutphin  Blvd.,  6th  Floor, 
Jamaica, New York), research the legal arguments presented, and answer them in your 
own Memorandum of Law in Opposition. 

When are opposing papers due?  Opposing papers must be served on the date 
indicated in the Notice of Motion or Order to Show Cause.  If the Notice of Motion does 
not demand service by a specific date, opposing papers must be served at least two days 
before the return date of the motion.  See the Civil Practice Laws and Rules (CPLR for 
short) Section 2214(b).  If the motion was been made by Order to Show Cause, opposing 
papers must be served by the return date of the Order to Show Cause, or sooner, if the 
Order to Show Cause requires earlier service. 2.  SERVICE OF OPPOSING PAPERS 

It is usually proper to serve answering papers by mail.  See,  CPLR Rule 2103. 
However, if the court orders some other means of service, you must follow the directive 
of the court.  Legal papers must be served by a person who is not a party to the lawsuit 
(i.e., not you).  CPLR 2103(a).  You must have a New York State resident who is over the 
age  of eighteen  serve  the  papers for you  and  give  you  a  signed, notarized  Affidavit  of 
Service.  You  may  obtain  a  blank  Affidavit  of  Service  from  the  Queens  Supreme  Court 
Office of Public Information.  Please note:  when the opposing party is represented by an 
attorney, opposing papers may be served upon the attorney by mail, by delivery at the 
attorney's office, or in any other manner permitted by CPLR 2214. 

3.  OBTAINING AFFIDAVITS OF SERVICE 

The  person  serving  your  Affidavit  in  Opposition  must  give  you  an  Affidavit  of 
Service  which  includes  the  details  of  service  for  each  person  served.    An  Affidavit  of 
Service states the item served (in this case, your Affidavit in Opposition), the manner of 
service (whether by mail or personal service) and other details of service.  The affidavit 
must  be  notarized,  and  attached  to  the  original  opposition  papers  before  they  are 
submitted to the court. 

Another  acceptable  way  to  prove  service  of  papers  is  the  Acknowledgment  of 
Service.  If the party receiving opposing papers is willing to sign an Acknowledgment of 
Service (printed on most litigation covers), the signed, dated Acknowledgment of Service 
can  serve  as  proof  of  service.    The  term  "proof  of  service"  is  defined  by  the  CPLR  to 
include  Affidavits  of  Service  and  Acknowledgments  of  Service.    A  litigant  cannot, 
therefore, assume that any other "proof" will be acceptable to the court. 

4.  SUBMITTING OPPOSING PAPERS TO THE COURT. 

On the return date of the motion, you must come to court and hand up to the original 
affidavit  in  opposition,  with  affidavit(s)  of  service  attached.    Without  affidavits  or 
acknowledgments  of  service,  the  opposing  papers  will  not  be  accepted.    If  the  Justice 
assigned  to decide  the  motion  wishes  to hear the motion  orally  argued,  that  argument 
may take place immediately at calendar call or at some other date.  If the argument is 
adjourned (postponed) you will be notified of the date of argument.  Once the motion is 
submitted it is your responsibility to keep track of it until a decision is rendered.  You may 
do this by checking the N.Y. Law Journal or calling the Motion Support Office 718-298-
1009 (for Matrimonial Matters call 718-298-0950).
