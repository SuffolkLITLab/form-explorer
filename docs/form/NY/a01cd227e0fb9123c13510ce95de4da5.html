Each party acknowledges receipt of the following notice from the Court:  

If your divorce was commenced on or after January 25, 2016, this Notice is required to be 
given to you by the Supreme Court of the county where your divorce was filed to comply 
with the Maintenance Guidelines Law ([S. 5678/A. 7645], Chapter 269, Laws of 2015) 
because you may not have counsel in this action to advise you. It does not mean that your 
spouse is seeking or offering an award of “Maintenance” in this action. Maintenance” 
means the amount to be paid to the other spouse for his or her support, either during 
the pendency of the divorce action as temporary maintenance or after the divorce is 
final as post-divorce maintenance.

You are hereby given notice that under the Maintenance Guidelines Law (Chapter 269, 
Laws of 2015), there is an obligation to award the guideline amount of maintenance on 
income up to $203,000 to be paid by the party with the higher income (the maintenance 
payor) to the party with the lower income (the maintenance payee) according to a formula, 
unless the parties agree otherwise or waive this right. Depending on the incomes of the 
parties, the obligation might fall on either the Plaintiff or Defendant in the action.

There are two formulas to determine the amount of the obligation. If you and your spouse 
have no children, the higher formula will apply. If there are children of the marriage, the lower 
formula will apply, but only if the maintenance payor is paying child support to the other spouse 
who has the children as the custodial parent. Otherwise the higher formula will apply.

Lower Formula

(a)  Multiply Maintenance Payor’s Income by 20%.

(b)  Multiply Maintenance Payee’s Income by 25%.

(c)  Subtract Line b from Line a: = Result 1 

(d)  Subtract Maintenance Payee’s Income from 40 % of Combined Income* = 

Result 2. 

(e)  Enter the lower of Result 2 or Result 1, but if less than or equal to zero, enter zero.

THIS IS THE CALCULATED GUIDELINE AMOUNT OF MAINTENANCE 
WITH THE LOWER FORMULA

Page 10 

[UCS eff. 7/1/22]Higher Formula

(a)  Multiply Maintenance Payor’s Income by 30%

(b)  Multiply Maintenance Payee’s Income by 20%

(c)  Subtract Line b from Line a= Result 1 

(d)  Subtract Maintenance Payee’s Income from 40 % of Combined Income*= 

Result 2

(e)  Enter the lower of Result 2 or Result 1, but if less than or equal to zero, enter zero. 

THIS IS THE CALCULATED GUIDELINE AMOUNT OF MAINTENANCE 
WITH THE HIGHER FORMULA

* Combined Income equals Maintenance Payor’s Income up to $203,000 plus 
Maintenance Payee’s Income

The Court is not bound by the Guideline Amount of Maintenance and may deviate 
therefrom in the Court’s discretion as set forth in the statute.

The Court will determine, in its discretion, how long maintenance will be paid in 
accordance with the statute.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
