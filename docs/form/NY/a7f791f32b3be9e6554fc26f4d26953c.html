      <pre>SUPREME COURT, CIVIL BRANCH
QUEENS COUNTY

SELF REPRESENTED INFORMATION OFFICE

HOW TO COMMENCE A SPECIAL PROCEEDING

NOTE:  ALL  PERSONS  WITHOUT  COUNSEL  ARE  ADVISED  TO  CONSULT  AN
ATTORNEY.  NEITHER THE SELF REPRESENTED INFORMATION OFFICE NOR ANY
MEMBER OF THE COURT'S STAFF MAY OFFER LEGAL ADVICE, PREPARE YOUR
PAPERS, OR ACT AS YOUR ATTORNEY.

In order to commence the kind of lawsuit known as a special proceeding, a person

must prepare a document called a petition, which is a statement of the person's charges

or the grievance of which the person complains.  The person bringing the case is called the

petitioner.

Preparing the Petition

Every document served in a case in this court, including the petition, should be

typed or printed legibly in English, in black ink, on 8 Â½ x 11 inch paper, double spaced,

using one side of the paper only.

The top left hand corner of the petition should designate the court and county of the

proceeding.  Next comes the caption, a box inside in which appears the names of all the

parties,  the  petitioner  first  and  the  party  sued,  called  the  respondent,  below.    The

respondent or respondents named should be those persons claimed to have made the

determination or decision at issue.  A space should be left on the right hand side for the

insertion of an identifying number, called the index number, which number will be filled in

later as explained below.  Attached as Appendix A is a blank form of petition.

The  petition  should  set  forth  the  allegations  in  the  case  in  separate,  numbered

paragraphs.  Each paragraph should be short and contain only one material allegation. 

The petition should begin with a brief identification of the petitioner and the respondent(s).

The petition should next set forth a factual description of the determination or events

upon which the claim is based in chronological order (including the dates of key events). 

The petitioner should be certain to set out his or factual assertions in a clear and coherent

fashion.  Although the petitioner is familiar with the facts, he or she should keep in mind

that the court will be unaware of them except insofar as they are presented to the court in

the petition.  Accuracy is important and errors may be damaging to the petitioner's cause. 

Legible copies of any pertinent documentary evidence should be included as exhibits, with

index  tabs  annexed  to  each  such  exhibit.    If  the  proceeding  concerns  a  claim  that  a

government agency acted incorrectly or illegibly, A PHOTOCOPY OF THE AGENCY'S

FINAL DETERMINATION WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THE PROCEEDING AND ANY

INTERMEDIATE RULINGS MUST BE INCLUDED.

Generally speaking, a petitioner may only obtain relief in this court in the form of

review (and if successful, reversal) of a final agency action.  In the case of a parking ticket,

for example, the petitioner will likely be unsuccessful in this court if he or she failed to take

an appeal entirely through the Parking Violations Bureau appeal process.  The petitioner

should clearly describe each step in the administrative process that the petitioner took,

each decision made by the agency along the way, and what the final action by the agency

was.  There are time limitations of varying lengths within which lawsuits must be brought. 

2

In the case of Article 78 proceedings, the limitation generally is four months from the final

agency action.1  The petition must make clear when the final agency action took place.

The petition should conclude with a demand for a form of relief.  Frequently, the

petitioner will seek a reversal of the agency's action (e.g., setting aside and vacating the

parking ticket).  In such proceeding, the petition should, therefore, state, in so many words

or 

in  effect, 

that 

the  "petitioner  prays  (requests) 

that 

the  decision  of 

the

______________________  agency,  dated  _______________  providing

_________________________________ be set aside and annulled."

In a special proceeding challenging a decision of a government agency in regard

to some claimed right of the petitioner, the petition should specifically state, in detail, why

the petitioner contends that the agency action was wrong and must be annulled.  The court

may overturn agency action only if the determination or action made or taken (i) was in

contravention of law, (ii) was arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion, or (iii) (where

a hearing was held at the agency level) was not supported by substantial evidence in the

The petitioner should attach to the petition a verification, which is a sworn statement

by the petitioner, under penalty of perjury, that the facts contained in the petition are all

true.  This document must be signed by the petitioner in front of a notary public, who must

acknowledge, stamp and sign the verification.  An example of a verification is included in

record.

Appendix A.

1 C

ertain  substantive  statutes  mandate  different  time
limitations.    A  review  of  the  pertinent  statute  (law)  should  be
made prior to commencement of such a proceeding.

3

In addition to the above, the petitioner should also be sure that he or she brings the

special proceeding in the proper county.  There are a number of rules about what is a

proper venue for a case that generally relate to the residence of the various parties and

where the underlying subject matter of the lawsuit arose.  See, Article 5 of the Civil Practice

Law and Rules.  Generally, the petitioner must commence a special proceeding against

a public body or officer in any county within the judicial district in which the respondent

made  the  determination  complained  about  or  refused  to  perform  the  duty  allegedly

violated, or where the underlying proceedings were brought, or where the material events

took place, or where the principal office of the respondent is located.  The judicial district

of our court is the same as the County of Queens (i.e., 11th Judicial District).

Once the petitioner has prepared a petition, he or she must start the case.  This is

done as follows:

How to Set the Wheels in Motion

New York law requires that papers commencing a special proceeding must be filed

with the County Clerk and that an identifying number, an Index Number, be obtained.  The

petitioner should go to the County Clerk's Office (Room 106).  The petitioner will have to

fill  out  an  Index  Number  Cover  Sheet  form  and  purchase  an  Index  Number  from  the

cashier (cost $210).  The petitioner must write in the Index Number assigned by the County

Clerk in the Index Number space to the right of the caption on each of the documents

prepared by petitioner.  A copy of all of these documents must be filed with the County

Clerk, who will open a court file for the case.  The Clerk will stamp the petitioner's copies

to show that the papers were filed and will issue a receipt for the purchase of an Index

4

Number.  The petitioner needs to file with the Clerk the following initial legal papers: (i) a

copy of a petition and a notice of petition, or (ii) a copy of the petition and a copy of an

order to show cause.

In  order  to  bring  the  proceeding  before  a  Justice  (the  proper  title  of  a  Judge

assigned to Queens Supreme Court is Justice) of this court, the petitioner needs to request

that the case be placed before a Justice on a calendar.  This is done in either of two ways: 

(1) by serving and filing a notice of petition cause(the notice of Petition, Verified Petition

and RJI must be served, and an affidavit of service prepared and attached to the

papers, before submitting the papers to the Motion Support Office) , or (2) proceeding

by order to show.  A notice of petition is a document directed to the respondent(s) that

advises the respondent(s) of where and when the petition is to be submitted to a Justice

and identifies all papers upon which the special proceeding is based.  An example of a

notice of petition is included in Appendix A.  An order to show cause also serves to give

notice to all parties, but the form of the document is different.  Annexed as Appendix B is

an  example  of  an  order  to  show  cause  in  the  context  of  a  special  proceeding.    This

document, unlike the notice of petition, is in reality a court order and must be presented to

and be signed by a Justice of the court at the outset of the process in the court.

Filing in Court - Moving by Order to Show Cause

When moving by order to show cause, the petitioner should prepare the petition as

explained  above  and  also,  an  order  to  show  cause  in  a  form  similar  to  the  example

annexed as Appendix B.  The petitioner should bring the original and two copies of the

5

papers to court.  One copy should be filed with the County Clerk, as explained above.  The

petitioner must also complete and file a form known as a Request for Judicial Intervention

("RJI," for short).  The purpose of this form is to make clear to the court the kind of case

involved and to formally request the intervention of a Justice.  The filing fee for the RJI is

$95 (to be paid in Room 106).  An RJI form may be obtained from the Self Represented

Information Office.

At this point, a filing with the County Clerk has been made, but a filing with the Court

has not yet occurred.  The petitioner should next proceed to the Ex Parte Office of the

Court (Room 140).  The original petition and order to show cause must then be presented

to a clerk in that office, together with proof of the previous filing with the County Clerk, proof

of purchase of an Index Number and a completed RJI form together with a certified check

or money order for $95 payable to the Queens County Clerk.  The Ex Parte Office will then

review the petitioner's papers to make sure that they are in proper form, and if so, will

assign the case to a Justice on a random basis.  If emergency relief is requested, petitioner

must also submit an emergency affidavit which briefly explains the  nature  of  the  relief

requested  and  why  immediate  or  emergency  relief  is  needed.    (Sample  Emergency

Affidavit forms are available from the Office of Public Information.)

The papers will then be delivered to the assigned Justice for immediate review and

if found acceptable, signed by him or her and then given to you so you can copy them

(return the originals to the Ex Parte Office) and arrange to have them served in the manner

directed by the Court.  If immediate emergency is not required, the papers are simply left

with the Ex Parte staff.

After the papers are reviewed, they will be either:

6

a)

b)

Marked to be returned to you for correction, or

sent to the assigned Justice for signature.  

You can  check the  status  of your Order to Show Cause  by calling the  Ex parte

Clerk's office at (718) 298-1018.  (Wait at least 48 hours before calling.)

If your papers need corrections, you should return to the Clerk's office, pick them

up, correct them as needed and resubmit them.

If your papers are correct as to form, they will be forwarded by the Ex Parte Office

staff  to  the  assigned  Justice's  Chambers  for  signature.    If  the  Justice  finds  them

satisfactory, he/she will sign them, then fill in the return date and specify when and how the

papers are to be served.

When the order has been signed, the petitioner must "conform a copy," that is,

reproduce on a copy of the papers with each and every marking made thereon by the

Justice.  This copy must then be photocopied and served upon the attorneys for all parties

to the case in the manner and within the deadline set by the Justice.  (For information

about service, ask the Self Represented  Information Office about its brochure, How to

Serve Legal Papers.)

After service is made, the petitioner must see to it that an affidavit of service is

prepared.  The original must be presented to the Court on the return date.  (The case will

be called in the assigned Justice's courtroom.)  The petitioner must be present at that time

especially if the Court granted him/her/it a stay (TRO) until the hearing date of the motion

and the petitioner wishes it to continue until the motion is decided.  Petitioners must ask

for this when the order to show cause is called before the Court at calendar call.  If the

other parties do not submit opposing papers and do not appear on the return date, the

7

court may take action on the order to show cause provided that it is satisfied from the

affidavit of service that the other parties were properly served with the order to show cause

and supporting papers.

The other parties may submit papers in opposition to the petition (usually in the form

of an answer together with opposing affidavits and exhibits).  This ordinarily will be done

within the time specified by the  Justice when  the  Order to Show  Cause is signed.   All

opposition papers must also be properly served on the petitioner as well as all other parties

to the case.

Moving by Notice of Petition

The proceeding can be brought before the court without need for a Justice to sign

an order to show cause  at the  outset.   Instead,  the petitioner  may proceed  directly by

notice of petition, as follows.

The petition should prepare a notice of petition and petition and an RJI.  Since the

initiating papers will not first be presented to a Justice, the petitioner must select a return

date and identify the place at which the matter is to be heard.  That place is the Courtroom

of the assigned Justice.  The return date can be any weekday at 9:30 A.M., but the return

date must be selected keeping in mind that the respondent(s) must be given adequate time

to prepare an opposing or answering papers.  Therefore, the return date selected must be

at least 8 days after  service of the initiating papers has been made on all respondents.2

n an Article 78 proceeding, 20 days advance notice must be
provided.  Also, if a notice of petition that was served at least
12 days prior to the return date expressly demands that the answer
be served days prior to the return date, the respondents must serve

2 I

8

As explained earlier, the petitioner should file one copy of these papers with the

County Clerk (Room 106) and should purchase an Index Number before service is made. 

Next, the petitioner should cause a copy of the papers and an RJI form to be served upon

all respondents.  Then the petitioner should file the originals of all of the papers and the

original RJI with the court.  Since the petitioner is not proceeding by order to show cause,

he  or  she  should  file  the  papers  in  the  Motion  Support  Office  (Room  140),  not  in  the

Ex Parte Office.  At the same time, the petitioner must file two duplicate original affidavits

of service; one with the Motion Support Office and one with the County Clerk (Room 100,

Law & Equity Counter).  The petitioner will also have to pay the $95 RJI fee at that time by

certified check or money order payable to the Queens County Clerk.

The Motion Support Office will randomly assign the matter to a Justice and will place

it on a calendar for the return date selected by the petitioner.  For more on this subject, see

How  to  File  a  Request  for  Judicial  Intervention  which  is  available  from  the

Self Represented Information Office.

The original papers  must be delivered  to the  Motion  Support  Office Information

Window (Room 140) at least nine business days prior to the return date so that the petition

may be recorded in the court's computer system and placed on the calendar.  In the first

instance,  the  place  at  which  the  motion  will  be  returnable  is  the  Assigned  Justice's

Courtroom.  Oral (spoken) argument may take place there but usually oral argument takes

place only when, where and if the assigned Justice directs.  This is so for all petitions

his/her/its answer at least 7 days prior thereto.  In that event,
the  petitioner  will  have  a  right  to  serve  affidavits  and  a
memorandum  of  law  in  response  to the answer  (called  a  reply) at
least one day prior to the return date.

9

brought in our court by notice of petition.  The parties are free upon agreement to adjourn

petitions (within limits) so as to accommodate their schedules.  Answering and reply papers

are to be served upon all other parties to the case within the deadlines applicable.  The

original answering and reply papers (to which must be attached proof that the papers were

served on all other parties) must be delivered to the Courtroom at the call of the calendar

at 9:30 A.M. on the return date.

A word of caution on return dates.  Sometimes the assigned Justice and/or the

Court Clerk's Office will direct or require a change in the return date you selected.

Accordingly, a few days after you submit your notice of petition you must check with

the Motion Support Clerk's Office to see if this happened.

You can do this by:

1.    Checking  the  Court's  website  WWW.COURTS.STATE.NY.US/FUTURE

APPEARANCE.  This is recommended, or 

2.  Calling the Motion Support Clerk's Office at 718-298-1009 (Have your Docket

Number ready).

Once the motion is marked submitted, it is either sent to the Justice assigned to the

case for decision or is scheduled for oral argument in front of that Justice.  This depends

upon the procedures adopted by the Justice in question.

Remember, you are responsible for keeping track of the status of your petition after

it is submitted and doing whatever follow-up is necessary after it is decided.

To check the status of your petition, call the Motion Support Clerk's office at 718-

298-1009 (have your Index Number ready).  For information on follow-up steps that are

10

required if the petition is granted, obtain the brochure from the Office of Public Information

called, Submit-Settle-Enter Orders.
