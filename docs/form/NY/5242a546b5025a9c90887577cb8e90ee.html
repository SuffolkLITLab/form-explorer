      <pre>CHECKLIST 

  Make sure you are eligible (see next page). 

  Complete the whole application. 

  Get your application notarized. 

  Make two copies of your application. 

 

 

 

“Serve” the prosecutor. 
Before you file your application with the court, a copy of your full 
application must either be mailed or hand-delivered to the 
prosecutor’s office.  This is called “serving” them. 

NOTE:  If the application is hand-delivered in person, bring the 
original and both copies of the completed application.  
Give one copy to the clerk at the prosecutor’s office and 
ask the clerk to stamp both your copy and the original 
application that you will file with the clerk of the court as 
“received.”  This proves the application was served, and 
you will not need to submit an Affidavit of Service form. 

OR 

If the application is not stamped “received” at the 
prosecutor’s office or if it is served by mail, then you 
must submit the Affidavit of Service form with your 
application.  The Affidavit of Service must be completed 
and then signed in front of a notary by the person who 
mailed or hand-delivered the application to the 
prosecutor’s office. 

File your original application with the clerk of the court where 
you were convicted of the marihuana charge. 
NOTE:  Make sure that your original application is either 

stamped “received” by the prosecutor’s office, or if it is 
not stamped “received” by the prosecutor’s office, that 
you have attached a completed and notarized Affidavit 
of Service to prove it was served.  The clerk of the court 
should also stamp your copy of the papers “received.” 

Keep copies of all the papers you filed with the court for your 
records.

 

C.P.L. §440.46-a APPLICATION 

PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS COMPLETELY BEFORE STARTING THE 
APPLICATION 

You do not need to file this form to receive automatic expungement. 
If you were convicted of violating Sections 221.05, 221.10, 221.15, 221.20, 221.35, or 
221.40 of the Penal Law, you are entitled to automatic expungement and sealing.  
These convictions currently will not appear in a criminal history search requested 
through the Courts or the Division of Criminal Justice Services.  Automatic 
expungement of these charges will be completed on or before March 31, 2023. 

You may wish to speak with an immigration attorney before submitting this form 
if you have any concerns about the impact that this motion may have on your 
immigration status. 

ARE YOU ELIGIBLE? 

WERE YOU CONVICTED OF A MARIHUANA OFFENSE UNDER ARTICLE 221 OF 
THE PENAL LAW AND EXPERIENCING SEVERE OR ONGOING CONSEQUENCES 
RELATED TO EITHER THE CONVICTION OR THE SENTENCE?   Yes   No 

If you answered NO, you are not eligible to have your conviction vacated under 
section 440.46-a of the Criminal Procedure Law.  Your application will be DENIED. 

If you answered YES, COMPLETE THE ATTACHED APPLICATION, have it 
notarized, serve a copy on the prosecutor’s office (see link to the statewide address 
list for all prosecutor’s offices below), and file the original with the clerk of the court. 

WHAT DO I NEED TO DO? 

1.  COMPLETE and NOTARIZE your application. 

NOTE:  If you attach supporting documents in addition to the Affidavit of Service, 

these documents do not need to be notarized. 

2.  MAKE 2 FULL COPIES (for a total of three, the original plus two copies) of 

your application, including any supporting documents. 

3.  SERVE THE PROSECUTOR.  Before you file your application with the court, a copy 
of your full application must either be mailed or hand-delivered to the prosecutor’s 
office.  This is called “serving” them.  A list of prosecutors’ offices can be found 
online at: 
http://www.nycourts.gov/FORMS/cpl_160.59_sealing_application/pdfs/List_of_Distric
t_Attorneys_Offices.pdf 
NOTE:  If you want to vacate a marihuana conviction in more than one case, you 
must complete, serve, and file a separate application for each case.  You 
must serve each application on the appropriate prosecutor’s office.  The 
prosecutor is usually the District Attorney of the county where the court is 
located, but, if your case was prosecuted by the New York State Attorney 
General or a Special Narcotics Prosecutor, serve them instead.

file with the court as “received.” 

• 

If serving by mail:  

Mail one copy of your full application, including copies of any supporting 
documents, to the appropriate prosecutor’s office.  Certified mail is 
recommended so that you have proof of mailing. 

4.  GET PROOF OF SERVICE.  If the application was hand-delivered and time-

stamped “received” by the prosecutor’s office, this is proof of service, and you do not 
need to submit an Affidavit of Service form.  If your application was not time-
stamped “received” by the prosecutor’s office, you must attach the Affidavit of 
Service form (at the end of this application).  The Affidavit of Service must be 
completed and then signed in front of a notary by the person who served (mailed or 
hand-delivered) the application to the prosecutor’s office.

supporting documents do not need to be notarized. 

•  You may file your application by mail or in person at the court clerk’s office.  

You can find court addresses online at:

7.  KEEP PROOF OF FILING. 

1.  Save one copy of the application for your records. 
2.  If you file your application in person, ask the court clerk to time stamp your 

copy “received.” 

3.  If you file your application by mail, it is best to use certified mail so that you 

will have a receipt showing that mailing occurred.  Save the receipt. 

8.  HEARING OR DECISION.  If the prosecutor opposes your application, the court 

may contact you to schedule a hearing.  At the hearing, the court will consider any 
evidence offered by you or by the prosecutor that would help the court to decide 
whether to vacate your conviction.  If the prosecutor does not oppose your 
application, the court will mail a decision to you.  If you provide your email address, 
the court will also email the decision to you.
