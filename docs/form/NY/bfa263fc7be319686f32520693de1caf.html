Notice to Parties in Small & Commercial Claims Actions

ADJOURNMENTS
Requests for adjournments must be made in writing to the court with notice of the request given to all
parties.  Requests may also be made in person on the court date.  No requests for adjournments will be
accepted by phone.  All requests for adjournments are submitted to the judge/arbitrator on the court date
for approval.  The court does not notify the parties of the new court date if the adjournment request is
granted.  You must contact the court to ascertain the new date.

PROOF OF CLAIM; DEFENSES TO CLAIM
On the court date you must submit all items necessary to prove the claim or to defend against the claim. 
Contracts, agreements, receipts, cancelled checks, photographs and other documents should be produced
at trial.  Property damage may be proven by two itemized written estimates or by one itemized paid bill. 
Persons having actual knowledge of the facts and circumstances of the claim, or who are experts in a
field may be present to testify.  Expert witnesses cannot be subpoenaed to testify since most require
compensation to appear in court.

DUTY TO PAY JUDGMENTS
(A)  Any person, partnership, firm or corporation which is sued in a small/commercial claims court for
any cause of action arising out of its business activities, shall pay any judgment rendered against
it in its true name or in any name in which it conducts business.  "True name" includes the legal
name  of  a  natural  person  and  the  name  under  which  a  partnership,  firm  or  corporation  is
licensed, registered, incorporated or otherwise authorized to do business.  "Conducting business"
as used in this section shall include, but not limited to, maintaining signs at business premises
or on business vehicles; advertising; entering into contracts; and printing or using sales slips,
checks,  invoices  or  receipts.    Whenever  a  judgment  has  been  rendered  against  a  person,
partnership, firm or corporation in other than its true name and the judgment has remained
unpaid  for  thirty-five  days  after  receipt  by  the  judgment  debtor  of  notice  of  its  entry,  the
aggrieved judgment creditor shall be entitled to commence an action in small/commercial claims
court against such judgment debtor, notwithstanding the jurisdictional limit of the court, for the
sum of the original judgment, costs, reasonable attorney's fees, and one hundred dollars.

(B)  Whenever a judgment which relates to activities for which a license is required has been rendered
against a business which is licensed by a state or local licensing authority and which remains
unpaid for thirty-five days after receipt by the judgment debtor of notice of its entry and the
judgment has not been stayed or appealed, the state or local licensing authority shall consider
such failure to pay, if deliberate or part of a pattern of similar conduct indicating recklessness,
as a basis for the revocation, suspension, conditioning or refusal to grant or renew such license. 
Nothing  herein  shall  be  construed  to  preempt  an  authority's  existing  policy  if  it  is  more
restrictive.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
