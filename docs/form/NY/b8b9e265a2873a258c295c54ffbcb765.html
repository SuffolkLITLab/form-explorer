      <pre>SUPREME COURT, CIVIL BRANCH
QUEENS COUNTY
COURT HELP CENTER
NOTE:    ALL  PERSONS  INVOLVED  IN  A  LEGAL  ACTION  SHOULD  CONSULT  AN
ATTORNEY.  NEITHER THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC INFORMATION NOR ANY MEMBER
OF THE COURT'S STAFF MAY OFFER LEGAL ADVICE, PREPARE YOUR PAPERS OR
ACT AS YOUR ATTORNEY.

HOW TO RESPOND TO A COMPLAINT

Once  a  summons  and  complaint  or  a  summons  with  notice  have  or  has  been

served, the defendant (the person being sued) must take certain responsive action within

20 or 30 days (depending on how the papers were served).  If the defendant fails to do so,

the plaintiff (the person bring the lawsuit) may quickly be able to obtain the relief (e.g.

money, divorce) he or she seeks in the form of what is called a Judgment by default (also

called a default judgment).

A.

How a Default Judgment is Obtained

A plaintiff may take one or two routes to obtain a default judgment, depending on

the circumstances.  Once the deadline for action by the defendant has passed without

such action being taken, the plaintiff in certain cases may apply directly to the Judgment

Clerk in the County Clerk's Office (Room 106) for such a judgment.  This can only be done

where the relief sought is purely money damages and the amount sought is either a sum

certain or one that, by calculation, can be made certain (e.g., suit upon a promissory note). 

The plaintiff must present a statement for judgment including an affidavit explaining the

nature of the case, showing that a summons with  notice or a summons and complaint

were served properly, establishing the fact that defendant has defaulted (that is failed to

properly answer) and explaining how the sum sought in the complaint is calculated.

1

In the alternative, the plaintiff may make an application to the court for a default

judgment.  This is done by way of a motion for a default judgment.  This motion must be

accompanied by  an affidavit (an affidavit is merely a written statement sworn to in the

presence of a notary public) by the party establishing the merits of the claim and the sum

due and an affidavit establishing the fact of the default.  See Civil Practice law and Rules

(Sec. 3215 (or the CPLR for short).  If the plaintiff's papers are in proper form and if there

is no opposition from the defendant, or if the opposition is unconvincing, the court is likely

to  grant  the  motion.    A  judgment  for  the  relief  sought  is  likely  to  be  entered  shortly

thereafter.

B.  How to Avoid a Default

In order to avoid a default, the defendant must take certain responsive actions upon

being served with either the summons with notice or the summons and complaint within

the applicable deadline.  These deadlines are found in the CPLR.  The action to be taken

differs depending on whether the case started with a summons with notice or a summons

and complaint.

Where the plaintiff has served a summons with notice, the defendant may serve a

document called a notice of appearance.  This document formally announces that  the

defendant is appearing in the case in order to defend him/her/itself and indicates who the

defendant's attorney is or that the defendant is appearing on his or her own behalf.  A

corporation must appear through an attorney.  There is no such thing as a corporation

appearing in a self-represented capacity.  A corporation that attempts to so appear may

lose the case for this reason.  If a defendant serves and files a notice of appearance, then

he or she has formally appeared in the case but is generally not aware (beyond the brief

are

the judge is called the return date).  See CPLR 2214(a).  An example of a notice of motion

should

write

their agreement

down (the agreement is called a stipulation).  The stipulation should contain all terms of

the agreement including the name of the case, the index number and a statement that both

 

 

 

parties agree that the defendant has asked for and been given an extension of time to

serve his/her answer or make a motion concerning the complaint  and  that  the  new

 
deadline is (whatever date has been agreed to.)

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8

 

 

If

the

plaintiff

will

not

agree

to

the

extension,

the

defendant

can

ask

the

court

for

an

extension

using

one

of

the

 
two

 
procedures

outlined

below.  Remember

merely

asking

the

 
court

for

an

extension

 

 
 
does

not

 

 
 
automatically

 

 
give

you

 
one

 
   
temporarily

or

stop

 
the

 
time

in

 
which you must act from running out.

 

 

 

 

 

 
THE

IF

TIME

 
TO

 
 
ANSWER

 

OR

 
MAKE

THE

 
 
MOTION

HAS

NOT

PASSED

(Run

out).

The

defendant

must

submit

an

affidavit

(in

general

an

affidavit

is

a

written

statement

sworn

 
to

 
before

 

 
notary

a

 

public)

 
requesting

 

 

the

 
extension.  (Fill in the blank affidavit forms

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are

 
available

 
from

 
the

 
 
Self-Represented

 

 

 
Information

 
Office.)  After putting the name of the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case and the Index Number on the top of the affidavit, the defendant must explain:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1) Why he/she needs more time

2)

 
What

 
 
happened

 
when

 
he/she

 
asked

 
the

 
plaintiff's

 
attorney

 
(or

 
if

 
the plaintiff has no

 

attorney

 
the

plaintiff

 
 
for
himself/herself)

 

 

 

 

 

 

an

extension.  This must include a brief summary

 

 

 

 

 
of the actual conversation between the defendant and the plaintiff or his/her attorney; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
A

3)

statement

 

 
that

 
the

case

 
involved

is

not

 
one

for

summary

judgment  in  lieu  of  a

complaint.  (If the complaint does not specifically say it is a motion for summary judgment

in lieu of a complaint it isn't);

 
4)

 
Whether

or

not

 
the

 

defendant

 
has

 

 

previously

 
asked

the

 
 
Queens

 
Supreme

Court

or

any

 

 

 

 

 

 

other court for an extension in this case and if so what happened as a result of that request

or requests.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In addition to the affidavit, the defendant must submit a proposed order that the

justice assigned to the case could sign granting the extension.    (Attached  to  these

instructions is a proposed fill in the blanks form order you can complete and submit with
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9

the

affidavit).

The

completed

affidavit

and

proposed

order

are

then

submitted

to

the

Ex-

parte

 
 
Support  Office  Rm 140. (In this context "Ex-parte" means the proposed order is

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

submitted to the court without first giving notice (telling) the other parties to the lawsuit).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
If

the

request

 

 

is

 

 
granted,

the

 
 
Justice

 
assigned

to

 
the

case

will

sign the proposed

order and direct you (that

is

the

party

who

submitted

the proposed order ) to give notice

 

of

 
the

signed

 
 
order

to

all

the

 
other

 
parties

 
involved

 
in the case by serving a copy of the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
signed

order

on

each

party's

attorney

(or

if

a

party

does

not

have

an

attorney

on

the

party

himself

or

herself).

In

the

order

the

justice

will

specifically

tell

you

how

and

when

the

order

is to be served.

THIS PROCEDURE MAY ONLY BE USED ONCE.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

NOTE:  If

a

 
Request

 
for

 
 
Judicial

Intervention

 
(RJI for short) has not already been

 
filed

 
for

your case, you will have to submit one.  There is a separate instruction sheet

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
available  from  the  Self  Represented  Information  Office  on  how  to  do  this  and  it  does

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
require a $95.00 filing fee.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IF

THE

TIME

TO

ANSWER

HAS

ALREADY

PASSED

(Run

out) OR IF ONE OR

MORE

EXTENSIONS  HAVE  ALREADY  BEEN  GRANTED.    USE  THE  PROCEDURE

BELOW:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If the time to answer the complaint or make a motion has already passed or if you

already received an extension before, the defendant (you) must make a formal written

motion with proper prior notice on all the other parties to the lawsuit asking the court for

permission to serve your answer late or make the motion you weren't able to make on time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(Remember a motion is merely a request that the court sign an order granting you the relief

 

 

 

you seek).

 

 

 

10

Motions

on notice  are made either by using a Notice of Motion plus supporting

papers

OR

an

Order

to

Show

Cause

and

supporting

papers.  If you use an Order to Show

Cause

you
 

can
 

 

 

 

 

 

include

an

immediate (but temporary) request that the court freeze the

   

running

time

for

of
 

you
 
 

to

answer
 

 

 

the

complaint

or

make

your

motion

until

the

court

holds

a hearing on your actual application for an extension of time.

 

 

 

 

 

 

The

moving
 

 

party
 

or
 

movant
 

(which
 
 

is

you
 

-

the
 

person
 

making
 

the
 

motion)
 

 

may
 

also
 

request

that

the
   

court
 

make
 

an

immediate

 

but
 

again  temporary  order  prohibiting  the
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

plaintiff

and/or

his/her

attorney

from

filing

and

entering

a

default

judgment

until

there

is

a

hearing

on

your

motion
 

(request)

for

an

extension.  The Self Represented Information

Office

can
 

supply

you

 

with
 
 

fill

in
 

the

blank
 

forms
 

for

a

Notice
 

of

Motion or Order

To

Show

Cause

together

 

with
 

the

needed
 
 

supporting

papers.  Again, if an RJI has not been filed for

the

case

you
 
 

will
 

need
 

to
 

 

submit

one.    There  is  a  $95.00  fee  required  and  separate
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions

on

how

to

do

this

are

available

from

the

Self

Represented

Information

Office.

 

 

You

may
 

also

more
 

detailed
 

instructions
