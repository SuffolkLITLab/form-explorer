      <pre>CHECKLIST 

  Make sure you are eligible (see next page). 

  Gather any supporting documents you think will help your application.  
These can include documents such as a Certificate of Relief from 
Disabilities or a Certificate of Good Conduct; verification of employment; 
community service, volunteer or charity work; educational transcripts; letters 
of recommendation or commendation from employers, teachers/professors, 
community leaders, faith leaders, or charitable organizations; certificates of 
successful completion of training programs, drug or alcohol treatment 
programs; etc.  Attach copies (not originals!) to your application. 

  Complete the application, but do not sign it until you get it notarized. 

  Get your application notarized.  If you use additional pages for your sworn 

statement of your reasons for sealing, then you must also sign, date and 
have this notarized on the last page of your statement. 

  Make two copies of your full application. 

 

 

 

“Serve” the prosecutor:  Before you file your application with the court, you 
or another person must mail or deliver a copy of your full application to the 
prosecutor(s).  This is called “serving” them.  If the application is served in 
person, make sure your copy and the copy you will file with the court are 
stamped “received.” 

If you did not get your copy stamped “received” at the prosecutor’s office, or 
if you mailed the application to the prosecutor’s office, then you must 
complete the Affidavit of Service, get it notarized and attach it to the 
application.  The Affidavit of Service must be completed by the person who 
delivered or mailed the application to the prosecutor’s office. 

File your original application with attached copies of supporting documents 
with the court.  Make sure that your original is stamped “received” by the 
prosecutor or that you have attached the Affidavit of Service if you 
submitted your application to the prosecutor by mail or did not get it 
stamped “received.” 

 

Keep copies of all the papers you filed for your records.

If you are ELIGIBLE, complete an application, have it notarized, serve a copy on 
the prosecutor’s office (see link to statewide list of prosecutor’s addresses on next 
page), and file the original with the court. 

NOTE:  Before deciding this application, the court may request a criminal history report 
(rap sheet), which will include any sealed or suppressed criminal cases and any criminal 
history information that occurred in jurisdictions outside of New York. 

Criminal Procedure Law section 720.10 (2) & (3): 

2. “Eligible youth” means a youth who is eligible to be found a youthful offender. Every youth is so eligible unless: 

(a)  the conviction to be replaced by a youthful offender finding is for (i) a class A-I or class A-II felony, or (ii) an armed 

felony as defined in subdivision forty-one of section 1.20, except as provided in subdivision three, or (iii) rape in the 
first degree, criminal sexual act in the first degree, or aggravated sexual abuse, except as provided in subdivision 
three, or 

(b)  such youth has previously been convicted and sentenced for a felony, or 
(c)  such youth has previously been adjudicated a youthful offender following conviction of a felony or has been 

adjudicated on or after September first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight a juvenile delinquent who committed a 
designated felony act as defined in the family court act. 

3. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision two, a youth who has been convicted of an armed felony offense or of rape 

in the first degree, criminal sexual act in the first degree, or aggravated sexual abuse is an eligible youth if the court 
determines that one or more of the following factors exist: (i) mitigating circumstances that bear directly upon the manner 
in which the crime was committed; or (ii) where the defendant was not the sole participant in the crime, the defendant's 
participation was relatively minor although not so minor as to constitute a defense to the prosecution. Where the court 
determines that the eligible youth is a youthful offender, the court shall make a statement on the record of the reasons for 
its determination, a transcript of which shall be forwarded to the state division of criminal justice services, to be kept in 
accordance with the provisions of subdivision three of section eight hundred thirty-seven-a of the executive law. 

WHAT DO I NEED TO DO? 

1.  COMPLETE and NOTARIZE your application.  If you used additional page(s) for your 

statement, you must sign, date and notarize the last page of your statement as well. You do 
NOT need to notarize documents you attach in support of your application, such as letters of 
reference or training certificates. 

2.  MAKE 2 FULL COPIES (for a total of three, the original plus two copies) of your 
application, including any attached documents.  You will need one copy for the 
prosecutor, one copy for yourself, and you will file the original application with the court. 

3.  SERVE THE PROSECUTOR.  Before you file your application with the court, you or another 
person must mail or deliver a copy of your full application to the prosecutor.  This is called 
“serving” them.  A list of prosecutor’s offices can be found online at: 
http://www.nycourts.gov/FORMS/cpl_160.59_sealing_application/pdfs/List_of_District_Attorneys_Offi
ces.pdf 
NOTE:  The prosecutor is usually the District Attorney, but if your case was prosecuted by 

the Attorney General or a Special Narcotics Prosecutor, serve them instead. 

• 

If you or another person are serving the application on the prosecutor in person: 
1.  Bring the original and both copies of your application to the appropriate 

prosecutor’s office. 

2.  Ask the prosecutor’s office to stamp all three applications “received” and leave one 

copy with the clerk of that office. 

• 

If you or another person are serving by mail:  

Mail one copy of your full application to the appropriate prosecutor’s office.  
Certified mail is recommended so you have proof of mailing.  Save the return 
receipt. 

4.  GET PROOF OF SERVICE.  If your application was served in person and stamped 

“received” by the prosecutor’s office, this is proof of service.  If your application was not 
stamped “received” by the prosecutor’s office, you must complete the Affidavit of Service 
(the last page of the application), sign it, and have it notarized.  If a person other than you 
served the application and it was not stamped “received” by the prosecutor’s office, that 
person must complete the Affidavit of Service. 

5.  FILE YOUR APPLICATION. 

•  Attach the original Affidavit(s) of Service (if served on the prosecutor by mail or if 

served in person but not stamped “received”) to your original application and file it with 
the court. 

•  You may send your application to the court by mail, or you may file your application in 

person at the court clerk’s office. 

6.  KEEP PROOF OF FILING. 

1.  Save one copy of the application for your records. 
2.  If you file your application in person, ask the court clerk to stamp your copy “received.” 
3.  If you file your application by mail, certified mail is recommended so you have proof of 

mailing.  Save the return receipt. 

7.  HEARING OR DECISION.  After you serve your application, the prosecutor has 45 days to 
oppose your request for a youthful offender determination.  An in-person hearing is not 

 

 

required for the court to decide your application, but the court may order an in-person 
hearing.  You or the prosecutor may also request an in-person hearing.  If an in-person 
hearing is scheduled, the court will contact you with the date and time of the hearing.  At the 
hearing, the court will consider any evidence offered by you or the prosecutor that would 
help the court decide whether to grant or deny your request for a youthful offender 
determination.  If an in-person hearing is not scheduled, you will receive a decision from the 
court by mail. 

8.  CONFIRM YOUTHFUL OFFENDER ADJUDICATION AND SEALING.  If the court grants 
your application and you want to verify that the case has been properly sealed in your 
criminal history record, contact the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services at: 

NYS Division of Criminal Justice Services 
Correspondence Unit – 5th Floor 
80 South Swan Street 
Albany, NY 12210

you were convicted and sentenced (this is called “serving” them).  If you serve them 
in person and have your copy stamped “received,” you have proof of service.  If you 
do not obtain a “received” stamp, an Affidavit of Service must be completed by the 
person who served the application and attached to your application when you file it 
with the court. 

2-8.  You are not required to submit additional supporting documents, but if you have

organizations; certificates of successful completion of training programs, drug or 
alcohol treatment programs; etc. 

⓫ You must tell the court why you believe a youthful offender determination should be 

granted. 
YOU MUST WRITE SOMETHING.  If you don’t answer this question, your application will be 
denied.  For example, you can tell the court about positive changes you have made in your 
life and things you have accomplished since the conviction took place, such as positive work 
history, participating in training programs, drug or alcohol treatment programs, work or 
schooling, performing community service, participating in faith-based programs, or volunteer 
work.  If you need more space or wish to attach your statement separately, you can write 
your statement on a separate sheet of paper, but any additional page(s) you write must also

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
