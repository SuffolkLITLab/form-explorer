Second Judicial Department 
45 Monroe Place 
Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201 
(718) 875-1300

NOTICE TO ASSIGNED COUNSEL 
Criminal Cases 

The enclosed decision and order assigns you to prosecute a criminal appeal. Your work as an assigned 
counsel  is  an  important  public  service for  which  you  have the  thanks  of  the  Court.  The  defendant  is  now your 
client and he or she is depending upon you to prosecute the appeal promptly and to the best of your ability. 

Assigned  counsel  must  work  diligently  to  perfect  the  appeal  as  soon  as  is  reasonably  possible.  Your 
progress  will  be  carefully  monitored  and  you  should  communicate  with  the  court,  by  letter  addressed  to  the 
attention of the Assigned Counsel Clerk, regarding any difficulties that might delay perfection of the case. You 
may not reject this assignment or delay perfection of the appeal based on any view of your own as to its relative 
lack  of  merit.  You  may  only  be  relieved  of  your  assignment  upon  motion,  after  a  showing  of  good  cause.  Six 
major  steps  in  your  representation  of  the  defendant  can  be  identified,  namely,  (1)  communicating  with  the 
defendant, (2) insuring that the stenographic minutes of the proceedings in the case are transcribed and filed, (3) 
preparing the brief, (4) perfecting the appeal by serving and filing the brief and issuing a subpoena for the original 
papers, (5) protecting the rights of a defendant who has been released pursuant to a stay of the execution of the 
judgment of conviction, and (6) complying with your post-decision responsibilities. 

Communicate with the defendant. Promptly advise the defendant of your assignment as counsel and ask 

1. 
for any suggestions that he or she may have as to the points to be presented on the appeal. Based on your own 
examination of the record and the defendant’s suggestions, decide upon the issues to be presented in your brief. If 
you believe certain issues are frivolous, you should so advise the defendant in your correspondence with the 
defendant, but should make no mention of those issues in your brief. 

This Court may not be in possession of current information as to the whereabouts of criminal defendants. 
If your client is at liberty, obtain that client’s last known address from the file in the trial court. If your client was 
sentenced to a term of imprisonment in a State prison, you may use the inmate lookup internet page of the New 
York  State  Department  of  Correctional  Services  at  http://nysdoccslookup.doccs.ny.gov/  .  If  you  do  not  have 
internet access, you may contact the State Inmate Locator of the Department of Correctional Services at 518 457-
0043.  Before  you  attempt  to  obtain  current  information  by  telephone  from  that  office,  you  must  know  the 
defendant's name and date of birth, or NYSIS Number or Prisoner Identification Number. An examination of the 
case file in possession of the clerk of the trial court should provide the appropriate information. 

2. 
Insure that the stenographic minutes of the proceedings in the case are transcribed and filed. The 
decision and order that assigns you as counsel for the defendant also directs the court reporters to prepare and file 
two copies of the transcript of the stenographic minutes of the proceedings in the case. A copy of the order has 
been sent directly to the trial court. To insure it is received and acted upon, you should also send a copy to the 
court.  If  you are  not  notified  within  a  reasonably  short time  that  the transcripts have been  prepared,  it  is  your 
responsibility to follow up with the trial court. If your efforts in the trial court are unavailing, contact one of the 
following persons: 
Kings County 
Queens County 
Richmond County 
Nassau County 
Suffolk County 
Westchester County 
Dutchess 
Orange 
Putnam 
Rockland 

Kelly Melin or Nicole Sahr 
Tanisha LaCruise or Judy Boscia 
Mary-Jane Delberian

The order of assignment directs the clerk of the trial court to furnish you with one of the copies of the 
transcript. You will use it to prepare the defendant's brief. When you serve that brief on the District Attorney, you 
must also turn over to him or her the copy of the transcript furnished to you by the clerk of the trial court. 

3. 
Prepare the brief. Upon receipt of the minutes you should promptly prepare the defendant's brief. The 
form and content of an appellant's brief are covered at length in §1250.8 of the Practice Rules of the Appellate 
Division and the brief you prepare must comply with that section. 

When  you  prepare  a  brief  raising  substantive  issues  you  should  mail  a  copy  to  the  defendant  together 
with a letter advising that he or she may apply to this Court, within 45 days after the date you mail the brief, for 
permission to file a pro se brief in which any additional issues may be set forth. Your attention is directed to the 
Court of Appeals decision in People v Vasquez (70 NY2d l). 

If, however, after carefully examining the record you are unable to find a non-frivolous issue, you must 
nevertheless submit a brief pursuant to Anders v California (386 US 738) setting forth a digest  of the essential 
facts, a statement that you have found no non-frivolous issues which could be raised on the appeal, a request to be 
relieved, and a statement that you have communicated with the defendant advising him or her of your views. Send 
a copy of your brief to the defendant, annexing to it a letter explaining that you have been unable to find a non- 
frivolous issue and advising that he or she may, as of right, file a pro se supplemental brief and receive a copy of 
the  minutes and may exercise that right  by advising the Appellate Division in writing of  the intention to do so 
within 30 days of the date of mailing of your letter (see Anders v California, supra; People v Gonzalez, 47 NY2d 
606; People v Casiano, 67 NY2d 906; 22 NYCRR 1250.11[f][1]). File the brief, with the annexed letter, in the 
office of the clerk of the court. An example of an appropriate Anders letter is available on the Court’s web site at 
www.nycourts.gov/courts/ad2/formsandpracticeaids.shtml. In regard to the filing of an Anders brief, your 
attention is directed to this Court’s decision in Matter of Giovanni S., (89 AD3d 252). 

The order of assignment directs the probation department, upon service on it of a copy of that order, to 
provide you with a copy of the report prepared in connection with the defendant’s sentencing. If the sole viable 
issue  on  appeal  is  the  excessiveness  or  legality  of  the  sentence  imposed,  perfect  the  appeal  expeditiously  by 
motion pursuant to § 670.l1(b) of the rules of this Court. If other issues are presented, you should advance any 
viable issue concerning the sentence in the defendant’s brief. In either case, if you have raised an issue concerning 
the excessiveness or legality of the defendant’s sentence, you must serve a copy of the probation report upon the 
District Attorney with your brie f and file a copy of that report in this Court. 

4. 
Perfect the appeal. After the brief is completed, send a copy to the defendant (see 22 NYCRR 1250.11 
[d][3]).  Serve  one  copy  on  the  District  Attorney  (see  22  NYCRR  1250.9[a])  together  with  the  copy  of  the 
transcript that you received from the clerk of the trial court (see 22 NYCRR 670.11[a]). 

Subpoena the papers constituting the original record from the clerk of the trial court and cause them to be 

filed in this Court prior to the filing of the brief (see 22 NYCRR 1250.9[a][4][i]). 

File six hard copies and one digital copy of the brief in this Court, including proof of mailing of a copy to 
the defendant, proof of service upon the District Attorney, and an extra copy of the statement required by CPLR 
5531 (see 22 NYCRR 1250.9[a][4]; 1250.11). If you are filing an Anders brief, you must also include a copy of 
your letter sent pursuant to § 1250.11(f). 

5. 
Protect the rights of a defendant who has been released pursuant to a stay of the execution of the 
judgment of conviction. If the defendant has been released on a stay of execution of judgment (CPL 460.50) and 
the  appeal  cannot  be  perfected  within  120  days  of  the  issuance  of  the  stay,  you  must  make  a  motion  for  an 
extension of the stay prior to the expiration of the 120-day period or the defendant will be subject to arrest. In the 
event that such an application becomes necessary, your supporting papers must detail your efforts to perfect the 
appeal within the time limited, the reasons for the delay, and the steps that you have taken or will take in order to 
overcome any obstacles to perfection. 

6. 
Comply  with  your  post-decision  responsibilities.  You  must  notify  the  defendant  of  this  Court’s 
determination on the appeal and fulfill your responsibilities under § 671.4 of the rules of this Court (22 NYCRR 
671.4), which require that you advise the defendant of his or her right to apply for a certificate granting leave to 
appeal to the Court of Appeals and to make that application if the defendant so requests.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
