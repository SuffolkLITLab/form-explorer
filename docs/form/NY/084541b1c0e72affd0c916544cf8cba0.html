NOTICE OF GUIDELINE MAINTENANCE  

ach party acknowledges receipt of the following notice from the Court:   

f your divorce was commenced on or after January 25, 2016, this Notice is required to be 
given to you by the Supreme Court of the county where your divorce was filed to comply 
with  the Maintenance Guidelines Law ([S. 5678/A. 7645],  Chapter 269, Laws of 2015) 
because you may not have counsel in this action to advise you.  It does not mean that 
your spouse is seeking or offering an award of “Maintenance” in this action.  
Maintenance” means the amount to be paid to the other spouse for his or her support, 
either during the pendency of the divorce action as temporary maintenance or after 
the divorce is final as post-divorce maintenance.  

You are hereby given notice that under the Maintenance Guidelines Law (Chapter 269, 
Laws of 2015), there is an obligation to award the guideline amount of maintenance on 
income up to $203,000 (eff. 3/1/22)  to be paid by the party with the higher income (the 
maintenance payor) to the party with the lower income (the maintenance payee) 
according to a formula, unless the parties agree otherwise or waive this right.  Depending 
on the incomes of the parties, the obligation might fall on either the Plaintiff or Defendant 
in the action.   

There are two formulas to determine the amount of the obligation. If you and your spouse 
have no children, the higher formula will apply.  If there are children of the marriage, the 
lower formula will apply, but only if the maintenance payor is paying child support to the 
other spouse who has the children as the custodial parent.  Otherwise the higher formula 
will apply.   

Lower Formula 

(a)  Multiply Maintenance Payor’s Income by 20%. 

 

(b) Multiply Maintenance Payee’s Income by 25%. 

(c)  Subtract Line b from Line a: = Result 1  

(d) Subtract Maintenance Payee’s Income from 40 % of Combined Income* =

  Result 2.  

(e) 

Enter the lower of Result 2 or Result 1, but if less than or equal to zero, 
enter zero. 
 

THIS  IS  THE  CALCULATED  GUIDELINE  AMOUNT  OF  MAINTENANCE 
WITH THE LOWER FORMULA

he Court is not bound by the Guideline Amount of Maintenance and may deviate 

therefrom in the Court’s discretion as set forth in the statute. 

he Court will determine, in its discretion, how long maintenance will be paid in 

accordance with the statute.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
