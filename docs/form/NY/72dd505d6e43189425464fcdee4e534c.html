District Court Room 373

 Part Rules & Procedures

Acting Supreme Court Justice: 
Principle Law Clerk:
Secretary:

Honorable Conrad D. Singer
Jennifer Ferraro, Esq.
Lynell Giovannello

Phone: 516-493-3865
Fax: 516-493-3949

The Nassau County Youth Part of the Supreme Court of the State of New York
has  been  created  pursuant  to  Chapter  59  of  the  Laws  of  2017  (Raise  the  Age
Legislation) to hear and determine Felony cases involving Adolescent Offenders (16
year  olds  as  of  October  1,  2018  and  17-  year-olds  as  of  October  1,  2019)  and
Juvenile Offenders (13,14 and 15 year olds).

All Felony Arraignments involving Adolescent Offenders (AO’s) and Juvenile
Offenders (JO’s) will be conducted by the Youth Part Judge on weekdays and by an
Accessible Magistrate on weekends and holidays.  In the event that an arraignment
is conducted by an Accessible Magistrate, the case will be adjourned to the Youth
Part on the next business day at 2:00 p.m.  The Youth Part shall be open Monday
through Friday 9:30 am to 5:00 pm.   After the first appearance in the Youth Part,
adjourned  cases  will  be  scheduled  on  Tuesdays  at  2:00  pm.    Unless  advised
otherwise by the Court, all weekly arraignments shall take place at 12:30 pm in the
Arraignment Part of the District Court. 

COURT APPEARANCES

Calendar Call for all cases will commence at 2:00 pm.  Attorneys, AO’s/JO’s
and the AO’s/JO’s parent or legal guardian must be present in the Courtroom at
2:00 pm on each and every court date, unless otherwise directed by the Court.  Late
appearances will not be permitted without good cause.  Final calendar call will be
at 2:45 pm.  Issued Bench Warrants will not be recalled.  

Attorneys must sign in for their cases with the Courtroom Clerk prior to the
calendar call.  All cases should be conferenced  with the District Attorney’s office
and Probation before the court date.  Conferences with the Court will be conducted
at the bench during calendar call.  Attorneys appearing on each court date must be
fully familiar with the case and all of the outstanding issues regarding the case. 

At arraignment or the next court date after arraignment a  bench conference
will be conducted to determine whether the case will be sent to Family Court or
Probation for adjustment.  If the case cannot be resolved on that initial court date,

1

the case will be adjourned as follows:

a.    For  Violent  Felonies  and  Class  A  Felonies  (except  Murder  and  cases
involving Controlled Substances), the case will be adjourned to the sixth (6th) day
from  the arraignment date  for  a  review of  the accusatory instrument and  other
relevant  facts  to  determine  whether  the  case  involves  the  Display  or  Use  of  a
Weapon, a Sex Offense, or Significant Physical Injury.

b.  For Non-Violent Felonies and Felonies involving Controlled Substances,
the  case  will  be  adjourned  approximately  two  weeks  for  the  District  Attorney’s
office  to determine whether they will make a motion to prevent removal. 

After thirty (30) days from the arraignment date, all cases not removed to
Family Court or Probation for adjustment will proceed in the Youth Part as a Felony. 
Cases  will  next  be  marked  as  Held  for  the  action  of  the  Grand  Jury.    Upon  an
Indictment,  the  case  will  be  expeditiously  scheduled  for  motions,  discovery,
hearings and then trial. 

ADJOURNMENTS

A. Court Dates:

1.  No adjournments for court dates will be accepted or effective without the
prior approval of the Court.  No adjournment or modification of a court date will be
granted unless based on unforeseeable or extraordinary circumstances.  

2.  A request for an adjournment of a court date shall be made by either a
letter to chambers by counsel with a copy to opposing counsel which states that the
adjournment is on consent and shall contain at least four (4) dates convenient to
both counsel, or by an Attorney conference call to chambers no later than 12:00 pm
on the business day immediately preceding the scheduled court date. 

3.  All attorneys must be advised of and consent to proposed adjournment

requests and agree upon proposed adjournment dates.  

4.  Upon approval by the Court of an adjournment request, the requesting
Attorney must immediately forward a confirmation letter to the Court (via fax and
first class mail), and notify all Attorneys, by phone call and letter (via fax and first
class mail), that the Court has adjourned the court date on consent of all counsel
and all parties.  Each Attorney is responsible for notifying his/her respective client. 

5.  Upon denial of an adjournment request by the court, or upon approval by
the court for the adjournment, all Attorneys and AO’s/JO’s must appear in court on
the scheduled court date.  

6.  Unless an adjournment request is specifically granted by the Court prior

2

to the court date, all parties must appear in Court on the scheduled court date.

7.  In addition to the above procedure, adjournment requests based on the
unanticipated  engagement  of  counsel  on  another  hearing  or  trial  must  be
accompanied by an Affirmation of Engagement in conformity with 22 NYCRR § 125,
specifying the Court the Attorney is engaged in, the name of the Judge, the name
of the case, the type of case, whether the engagement is on a Hearing or Trial, and
the expected duration of the engagement.  The Affirmation must be forwarded to
Chambers no later than 12:00 pm on the business day immediately preceding the
scheduled court date (via fax and first class mail).  Attorneys are directed not to
send their clients to Court with an Affirmation of Engagement without previously
notifying Chambers of the engagement.  Phone call notification to Chambers on the
morning of the scheduled court date is unacceptable.  

Motions:

Hearing and Trials:

Applications  to  adjourn  motion  dates  will  follow  the  same  procedure  as

adjournment requests for court dates as indicated above.  

Attorneys  must  be  ready  to  proceed  with  scheduled  hearings  and  trials. 
Hearings  and  trials  will  continue  day  to  day  until  completed.    There  will  be  no
adjournment  of  hearings  and  trials  without  exceptional  circumstances. 
Applications  to  adjourn  hearings  and  trials  will  follow  the  same  procedure  as
adjournment requests for court dates as indicated above.  

MOTIONS

Pre-Motion conferences: 

1. Prior to making or filing any motions, including non-emergency Order to
Show  Cause  applications,  Counsel  for  the  moving  party  must  arrange  for  a
conference call  to  be  held  with  his/her  adversary  and  the  Court  to  discuss  the
issues involved and the possible resolution thereof.  Counsel fully familiar with the
matter and with authority to bind their client must be available to participate in the
conference.  

2.    If  the  issue  can  be  resolved  during  the  conference  call,  an  Order
consistent with  such  resolution will  be  issued.    If  the  issue  cannot  be  resolved
during the conference call, the Court will set a motion schedule for the motion. 

3.    There  will  be  no  oral  arguments  on  motions  or  Order  to  Show  Cause

applications unless specifically indicated by the Court.

3

Submission of Motions and Motion Papers:

1.  Appearances of all Attorneys and AO’s/JO’s are required on all motions

dates, unless otherwise indicated by the Court.

2.  Motions are to be served and filed in conformity with C.P.L.R. §2214.  In
addition, the various branches of the motion, as delineated in the Notice of Motion
or  Order  to  Show  Cause,  are  to  be  preceded  by  a  number  or  letter  which
corresponds  to  a  number  or  letter  in  the  supporting  affirmations  and  affidavits
containing the numbered paragraphs dealing with the particular relief sought.  All
exhibits  must  be  clearly  tabbed.    The  moving  party  is  directed  to  append  a
proposed order as an exhibit to the motion.  

3.  No sur-reply affidavit, affirmation, memorandum of law or letter will be

accepted or considered by the Court without leave of the Court.  

4.  All original motion papers are to be timely filed with the Clerk of the Court. 

5.  Within 24 hours after filing of any motion papers with the Clerk, Attorneys
are  directed  to  provide  chambers  (at  Nassau  County  Family  Court,  1200  Old
Country Road, Westbury 11590) with a courtesy copy of all motions and supporting
papers.  Additionally, printed copies of all cases and statutes cited therein should
be attached to all papers.   

 

6.  Motions not consistent with these rules will be rejected and returned to
Counsel. 

Interim Partial or Full Settlement: 

If all or part of a submitted motion is settled, a written Stipulation signed by
all  of  the Attorneys and  parties, together with  a  proposed  Order  with Notice of
Settlement (on at least ten [10] days notice), or a signed Waiver of Settlement, shall
be submitted with a copy to be conformed along with a self-addressed, stamped
envelope.  In addition, the forgoing shall be accompanied by a letter setting forth
the date the motion was submitted, what aspects  of the motion have been settled
and what issues, if any, remain to be decided.  If the motion is resolved, in whole or
part,  on  the  record,  Counsel  shall  submit  a  proposed  Order  regarding  same
together with a copy of the minutes of the proceeding.  Alternatively, the parties
may submit a written Stipulation signed by all Attorneys and parties and same shall
be “So Ordered.”

4

Search Warrant Requests

All  proceedings  relating  to  search  warrants,  including  applications  for
warrants and returns on warrants, must be scheduled with the Court in advance. 
All requests to schedule search warrant proceedings must be made by letter to the
Court via fax to chambers. 

Communication with Chambers

In all communications with Chambers by letter, the title of the action, the
docket  number,  the  next  court  date  the  matter  is  on,  and  the  full  names  and
addresses  of  the  Attorneys  and  AO’s/JO’s  shall  be  set  forth,  with  copies
simultaneously delivered to all Counsel.  Ex-parte communications with Chambers,
whether  by  telephone,  fax,  e-mail  or  otherwise,  are  improper  and  will  be
disregarded.  

Copies of correspondence between Counsel shall not be sent to the Court. 
Such  copies  if  received  by  the  Court  shall  be  discarded  and  not  placed  in  the
Court’s file.  

The Court will not accept fax communications or submissions without prior

permission.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
