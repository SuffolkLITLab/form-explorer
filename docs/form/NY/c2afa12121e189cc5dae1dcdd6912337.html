      <pre>SUPREME COURT, CIVIL BRANCH
QUEENS COUNTY 

COURT HELP CENTER

Note: All persons involved in a legal action should consult an attorney. This office provides
forms and information on court procedures. Since we are an office of this court we cannot give
legal advice or act as your attorney or advocate. 

HOW TO SERVE PAPERS WHEN COMMENCING AN ACTION OR PROCEEDING  

     The providing of legal papers to other parties in a case is known as service.  Service of papers

that commence a case is referred to as service of process and must be accomplished in a

special manner, described below.  Service of subsequent papers, however, may usually be done

by mailing.  Rules regarding service must be strictly observed, especially with respect to service

of process, since such  service gives notice of the existence of the case.  

A. Service of the Initiating Papers  

     The summons with notice, summons and complaint, or notice of petition and petition are

referred to as initiating papers. Basic fairness (and the law) require that, before a plaintiff or

petitioner may obtain the relief demanded, all other parties must be formally notified that a case

has  been  commenced.    Therefore  initiating  papers  must  be  served  on  all  defendants  or

respondents in the manner required by the Civil Practice Law and Rules (“CPLR”).  

     A person serving papers must be 18 years of age or older and must not be a party to the

case.  CPLR 2103(a). Papers may be served by a process server or friend or relative who is not

a party to the case.

     Service upon a governmental agency: The City of New York shall be served by personal

delivery of the initiating papers to Corporation Counsel (at 100 Church Street, New York, New

York) or to any person designated to receive process in a writing, filed in the County Clerk’s

Office,  New  York  County.    Personal  service  on  the  State  of  New  York  shall  be  made  by

delivering the process to an Assistant Attorney Genera1 at an office of the Attorney General or to

-1-

the Attorney General in the State.  Service on a State officer who is sued solely in an official

capacity or  a  State  agency  shall  be  made  by  personal  delivery  to  such  officer,  or  to  the  chief

executive officer of such agency, or to a person designated by the chief executive officer to receive

service.  As an alternative, service on such officer may be made by taking the following two steps: 

1) mailing the papers by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the officer or chief executive

officer of the agency and  2) persona1 service on the State of New York in the manner described

in the preceding paragraph.  See, CPLR 307. 

     Service on a corporation shall be made by delivering the process to an officer, director, or

general agent, or cashier or assistant cashier (as defined in cases interpreting this law) or any other

agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service.  CPLR 311.  

     Persona1 service on a natural person (CPLR 308) shall be made by one of the following

methods: 

     1) Personal Delivery: Delivering the process within New York to the person to be served(this

is the highest form of personal service), or 

     2) Substituted Service (a two step procedure) [First] Delivering the papers within New York

to a person of suitable age and discretion at the actual place of business, dwelling place or

usual place of abode of the person to be served and [Second] by mailing the papers by first class

mail to the person to be served at his or her last known residence or   mailing them at his or her

actual place of business. (See NOTE, p. 3.) 

     3) Serving an Agent: Delivering the process within New York to a designated agent for the

service of process. CPLR 308(3). In divorce cases, neither this method, nor “nail and mail” service

may be used.         

     4)“Nail and Mail” service:  If repeated, genuine attempts at personal and substituted service

have failed, the papers may be served  by using the following two step procedure:

[First]affix the summons to the door of either the 
actual place of business, dwelling place, or usual  
place of abode within New York State of the person 
to be served and

-2-

[Second]  mail the process by first class mail to the  
person to be served at his or her last known residence 
or mail the process to such person at his or her actual
place of business.  See, CPLR 308(4). 

NOTE: The envelope used for the mailing (in second step of Substituted Service or the second

step of nail and mail service)  must be marked “PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL” and must

not indicate that the matter concerns a legal action against the person being served.  The affidavit

of service by “nail and mail” should describe in detail the prior attempts at personal service.

B. Timeliness and the Filing Proof of Service of Initiating Papers  

     Before the papers are served, you must file your papers and obtain an index number in the

County  Clerk’s Office  (Room  106)  before  the  statute  of limitations  has  expired.    If  you  are

bringing a special proceeding or an action in which the statute of limitations is four months or less,

the papers must, after timely filing with the County Clerk, be served no later than 15 days after

the date when the statute of limitations expires.  A summons with notice or summons and

complaint must be served within 120 days of filing with the County Clerk.

     After service of process, the person who served the papers must fill out a statement, called an

affidavit of service, which is sworn to and signed in front of a notary. The affidavit of service must

state the date, place, and time when the papers were served, and include a description of the

person served.  The description must state the  sex, skin color, hair color, and approximate age and

weight of the person served.  If substituted  or nail and mail service were used, the affidavit of

service must be filed with the County Clerk, Room 100, within 20 days of the date of service.  

C. Serving an Order to Show Cause  

     When a case is begun by order to show cause, service is performed in the manner ordered by

the Court.  Personal service is usually ordered.  A original of the affidavit of service should be filed

with  the  County  Clerk  immediately  after  service,  and  a  duplicate  original  affidavit  of  service  is

submitted to the court when the case is called on the return date.  If service cannot be made as

-3-

described  on  page  two,  paragraphs  1,  2  or  4,  the  court  may,  after  written  application  by

plaintiff/petitioner, permit service by other means. 

D. Service of Subsequent Papers

     After the case is commenced and all parties have received notice of its existence, papers may

usually be served with less formality.  A person aged 18 or over who is not a party to the case shall

serve papers, but mailing or delivering papers to the office of the opposing attorney or other self

represented party is permitted.  Subsequent papers must be served on all parties to the case, even

if the focus of the papers is only one party or a few parties; everyone has a right to know what is

taking place in the case.

E. Service of a Subpoena 

     A subpoena is used to compel a person who is not a party to a case to testify at a trial or

hearing, or to submit to a deposition (unless the person agrees to testify voluntarily).  A subpoena

may also require production of documents.  A self-represented person must prepare the subpoena

and  submit  it  to  the  court  to  be  “So  Ordered,”  (CPLR  2302).  After  issuance  by  the  court,  the

subpoena  must  be  served  in  the  same  manner  as  a  summons.    (See,  How  to  Prepare  a

Subpoena, available from the Self Represented Information Office in room 109.)
