      <pre>SUPREME COURT, CIVIL BRANCH
QUEENS COUNTY

COURT HELP CENTER

HOW TO COMMENCE A CIVIL ACTION
(WHICH MAY ALSO BE CALLED A CIVIL CASE OR A LAWSUIT)

NOTE: PERSONS WITHOUT COUNSEL ARE ADVISED TO CONSULT AN ATTORNEY. 
NEITHER THE SELF REPRESENTED INFORMATION OFFICE NOR ANY MEMBER OF
THE COURT'S STAFF MAY OFFER YOU LEGAL ADVICE, PREPARE YOUR PAPERS
OR ACT AS YOUR ATTORNEY.

As a general proposition, a self-represented person who wishes to obtain money

damages or some other form of legally-authorized relief from a private person or entity (for

example, a corporation) because that person or entity violated the self-represented rights

or negligently injured the self-represented person or property may commence a civil action

in this court.

The Summons and Complaint

The complaining party, the plaintiff, starts a civil  action by purchasing an index

number (exception:  if the plaintiff obtains a poor person order, the index number fee may

be waived) and then filing and serving either:  (i) a summons with notice, or (ii) a summons

and complaint.

An ordinary summons is served with a complaint and together they formally call

upon and require the alleged wrongdoer(s), the defendant(s), to answer the allegations

and claims of the plaintiff(s).  A summons with notice is a document that formally calls and

requires the defendant(s) to serve a notice of appearance in the lawsuit, after which the

complaint must be served.  Both types of summons contain the name of the court, the

caption of the case (a sort of box at the top containing the names of the parties), the Index

Number (an identifying number explained below) on the right side, a space for the date the

summons is filed with the Office of the County Clerk, and the name, address and telephone

number of the plaintiff's lawyer or the self-represented plaintiff.  The defendant(s) named

should be the person (or other legal entity, e.g., a corporation) claimed by the plaintiff to

be  the  wrongdoer.    Legal  responsibility  is  based  upon  breach  of  some  legal  duty  or

obligation owed by the defendant(s) to the plaintiff(s).  A copy of an example of a summons

is attached as Exhibit A.

A "summons with notice" is a special type of summons.  It contains all of the items

referred to above plus a brief description of the type of case and the relief the plaintiff(s)

is/are seeking.  (In the case of a plain summons, such a description is unnecessary since

the summons is accompanied by the complaint, which sets forth the plaintiff's case in some

detail.    The  summons  with  notice  is  not  accompanied  by  the  complaint.)    After  the

summons with notice is served, the defendant(s) can demand that the plaintiff(s) serve a

formal complaint, which must be done within 20 days after service of the demand or the

case  may  be  dismissed.    See,  Civil  Practice  Law  and  Rules  (the  "CPLR  for  short),

Section 3012(b).  An example of a summons with notice is attached as Appendix B.

The  complaint  is  the  document  that  sets  out  the  plaintiff's  charges  against  the

defendant(s).    The  law  determines  the  allegations  that  are  essential  to  setting  forth  a

legally  sound  claim.    Each  defendant  sued  must  be  alleged  to  have  taken  part  in  the

2

wrongdoing claimed to have damaged the plaintiff(s).  It is not enough to succeed that a

plaintiff(s) feels he or she has been wronged by the conduct of someone else.  A person,

for  instance,  ordinarily  may  not  sue  for  damages  because  a  supermarket  clerk  spoke

rudely to him or her.

If  a  plaintiff(s)  sets  forth  in  the  complaint  a  legal  theory  that  the  defendant(s)

believes to be unsound, the defendant(s) may make an application to the court to end the

case promptly for that reason, which is known as a motion to dismiss.  If the plaintiff's case

survives such a motion, the case is not over; the plaintiff must still prove the truth of the

allegations contained in the complaint.

A complaint (and every other document served in a case in this court) should be

typed or legibly printed in English, in black ink, on 8 Â½ x 11 inch paper, double spaced,

using one side of the paper only.  Papers should be stapled or otherwise bound securely. 

CPLR 2101.

The  complaint  should  set  forth  the  plaintiff's  claims  in  separate,  numbered

paragraphs.  Each paragraph should be short and contain only one material (i.e., relevant

and meaningful) allegation.  The complaint should begin with a brief identification of the

plaintiff(s).  This should be followed by an identification of the defendant(s).

The complaint should next set forth a brief description of the events upon which the

claim is based; what each defendant did or failed to do; how the actions or inactions of the

defendant(s) harmed the plaintiff; and the type and extent of injuries suffered.  The facts

should be recited in chronological order, including specific dates.  The plaintiff(s) should

be certain to set out his/her/their assertions in a clear and coherent fashion.  Although the

3

plaintiff(s) is/are familiar with the facts, he/she/they should keep in mind that the court will

be unaware of them except insofar as they are presented to the court in the complaint. 

Accuracy is important and errors may be damaging to the plaintiff's case.  The allegations

must be clear, to the point and comprehensible.1

The  court  has  the  power  to  grant  a  variety  of  remedies  depending  upon  the

circumstances.  The court, may, for example, order a defendant to compensate a plaintiff

for injuries suffered by payment of a sum of money, known as damages.  The court may

also, or in the alternative, order a party to do, or to refrain from doing, certain acts.  This

is known as injunctive relief.  The court may declare the rights of parties to a dispute.  This

is known as declaratory relief.  The complaint should conclude with a paragraph in which

the plaintiff(s) sets forth all of the relief against the defendant(s) that he/she/they is/are

seeking from the court.2

Attached  as  Appendix  C  is  a  form  of  complaint.    This  is  illustrative  only.    A

self-represented  plaintiff(s)  will  have  to  draft  (write  out)  a  complaint  suited  to  the

circumstances of his/her/their case.

t is important to point out that an individual desirous of
bringing  a  tort  claim  (e.g.,  for  personal  injury)  against  a
municipality  may  be  obligated  to  file  a  written  Notice  of  Claim
prior to commencing the lawsuit and within a deadline that may be
quite short.  FAILURE TO FILE A NOTICE OF CLAIM ON TIME MAY RESULT
IN DISMISSAL OF THE ACTION.  For more information on this subject,
the self-represented person is advised to consult an attorney.  The
Queens  Supreme  Court  Self  Represented  Information  Office  has
additional information as well.

n certain circumstances, pleadings must be verified, that is,
signed in a certain format under oath, in the presence of a notary
public.  See, CPLR 3020.

If a self-represented person intends to bring a case, he or she should prepare the

summons with notice or summons and complaint and deliver the original of that document

or documents to the County Clerk (Room 106),  submit these items to the clerk and pay

the fee ($210).3  The plaintiff should write the Index Number and the date of the filing of

the summons on a copy of the summons with notice or the summons and the complaint,

and  cause  this  item  or  these  items  to  be  served  upon  each  defendant  in  the  manner

provided by law.

Service of the Summons with Notice or the Summons and Complaint

Basic notions of fairness require that before the plaintiff(s) may succeed in obtaining

the relief demanded in the summons with notice or complaint, the defendant(s) be formally

notified of the fact that a case has been commenced against him or her and be afforded

an opportunity to put a defense before the court.  The formal notification is accomplished

by what is known as service of a copy of the summons with notice, or the summons and

complaint.  (This is sometimes shortened and called service of process.)  Proof of such

service must be filed with the County Clerk or the case may be dismissed.  For information

on service, see How to Serve Legal Papers.

f the plaintiff claims to be financially unable to proceed
with the action, he or she may apply to the court for a court order
relieving him or her of the obligation to pay filing fees and costs
connected with the lawsuit.  This is known as a poor person order.

The Defendant's Response

If the steps described above are performed properly, a civil case/action is now in

existence.  The defendant is then allotted 20 or 30 days (see, CPLR 320) within which to

serve a responding document, the answer, or to make a motion to dismiss the complaint. 

For more on the response process, see How to Respond to a Summons and Complaint.

Requests for Judicial Intervention

Although a lawsuit is in existence upon filing and service of a summons with notice

or summons and complaint, the matter has not yet initialized into the court's computer

system and is still unknown to the court.  The court will only learn about the case when a

party (plaintiff or defendant) files a "Request for Judicial Intervention Form" (an "RJI" for

short), pays the fee therefor, and asks the court to take some immediate action in regard

to the case.  A civil action may proceed for a considerable time before judicial intervention

becomes  necessary  and  before  the  case  is  actually  brought  before  the  court.    The

complaint and the answer set the frame of the dispute; however, some additional action

is required to bring the lawsuit to a head, or to put the plaintiff to his or her proof before the

court or jury.

A point at which many cases first appear before the court is when a motion is made. 

See the outline entitled Motions.  If the case does not come before the court for some other

reason, the plaintiff may, at an appropriate time, cause the case to be placed on the trial

calendar.  Until the case is placed on the trial calendar, it can never be called for trial.
