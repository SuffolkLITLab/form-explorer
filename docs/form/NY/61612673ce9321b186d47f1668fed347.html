SUPREME COURT, CIVIL BRANCH
QUEENS COUNTY

HOW TO TAKE AN APPEAL

A person who is dissatisfied with an order or judgment of the court in his or

her case may, under certain circumstances, take an appeal to a higher court. This

summary attempts to outline what is appealable, where an appeal is prosecuted and how

the appellate process should be initiated. This summary does not, however, purport to

address the prosecution of appeals in detail. Anyone thinking about an appeal should

consult an attorney. Information about how to appeal is to be argued, how many copies

of appellate briefs must be filed and similar matters may be obtained from the

Appellate Division, Second Department, 215 Monroe Place, Brooklyn, New York 11201

(Tel. No. 718-875-1300).

What is an Appeal?

'

(cid:127)

i

,

An appeal is a procedure by which a party who has been adversely affected

by what he or she believes to have been an error by a Justice of one court may seek to

have that judgment overturned(Reversed) ion a higher court. The party whoproceeds with

the appeal is called the appellant. All parties against whom the appellant seeks reversal

(cid:127)

]

(cid:127)

f

.

(regardless of their posture in this Court) are referred to as "respondent" with respect to the

appeal. The appeal is not a form of new trial. Basically, the same evidence that was

!

before the trial court is placed before the appellate court (unless the appeal concerns a

t

V

V

it

i

claim that the trial Justice improperly admitted or excluded certain evidence) and the

parties to the appeal argue, on papers and at a brief oral argument, that the trial Justice,

in reaching his or her decision on that evidence, did or did not commit an error that requires

reversal. This evidence is called the record on appeal (or the record).

The Appellate Court Structure

The appellate court that hears appeals from the Supreme Court,CivilBranch,

Queens County is, almost without exception, the Appellate Division, Second Department.

The next level in the appellate hierarchy is occupied by the Court of Appeals, Albany, New

York, which is the State's highest court. An appeal from the Supreme Court, Civil Branch,

Queens County should be prosecuted in the Appellate Division, Second Department.

Thereafter, it may be possible to pursue an appeal in the Court of Appeals, but the

conditions for doing so are beyond the scope of this summary. The Court of Appeals will

hear almost no appeals that do not first make their way through the appellate process in

the Appellate Division.

What Rulings are Appealable?

The general rule is that the only thing that may be appealed from is a

judgment or order. An order, roughly speaking, is a written determination of the court that

resolves a request of a party for some relief prior to trial. This sort of request is called a

motion.

, ;

i

.
: ;

i
i:

(cid:127)

A judgment is, generally speaking, a determination by the court that sets forth

the results of an entire case or of a discrete claim for relief in a case. A judgment might,

for instance, award plaintiff a sum of money or award judgment to defendant dismissing

2

-i

i V

k

t

a case. A judgment may resolve only one or some of a number of claims made in a case.

Generally speaking, a judgment

is signed by a Justice or by the County Clerk in

accordance with a written directive issued by the Justice.

The mere signing of an order or judgment does not set running the time

period during which an appeal must be instituted. Generally speaking, an appeal may only

be taken from an order or judgment that has been entered, and the deadline to take the

first steps in an appeal depends upon the date that a copy of the judgment or order was

served upon the parties to the case together with formal written notice that it has been

entered. In this context, "entry" is the formal filing in the Office of the County Clerk and

recording in the Clerk's records of the order or judgment in question. The "entry" date is

reflected by the date stamped by the Clerk on the original order or judgment.

Generally speaking,

in contrast with most orders, judgments are not

automatically "entered." The prevailing (winning) party must appear before the Judgment

Clerk in the Office of the County Clerk (Room 100) and request entry of the judgment.

When the papers are in proper form, the Judgment Clerk will enter the judgment formally

in the records of the County Clerk, at which point the judgment officially becomes binding

and is appealable. Ordinarily, it is the responsibility of the prevailing party to prepare the

form of judgment that is to be signed by the Justice and/or entered by the Clerk.

« .

.

' l

Only a party to a case who is "aggrieved" (i.e., has been harmed) by an order

or judgment may pursue an appeal of it. Generally speaking, all judgments are appealable

as a matter of right. Many orders are appealable as a mater of right, even if they are not

appeal has been served with a copy of the judgment or order from which the appeal is to

Usually, the party who succeeded is the one who serves the copy of the order

or judgment with notice of entry. However, the losing party may do so if he or she wishes.

In that case, the 30-day period commences from the time of this service.2

With only a few, very narrow exceptions, this 30-day period may not be

altered. The parties cannot extend this time by their agreement, nor may the court grant

a motion to extend the time.

The failure of the appellant to take the appeal in timely fashion will deprive

the Appellate Division of jurisdiction to hear the appeal. That court will and must dismiss

the appeal. The appeal may not be pursued even if all other parties to the case wish that

to happen.

IN SHORT, THE SELF-REPRESENTED PERSON IS ADVISED AS

STRONGLY AS WORDS PERMIT TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE CALENDAR

WHEN THINKING ABOUT TAKING AN APPEAL.

How to Take an Appeal

2The 30-day period applies to appeals as of right and those
brought by permission. As to appeals that require permission, a
notice of appeal is not served and filed at the outset ;
permission must be obtained; first.
permission must be made and the motion must be made within the
3 0-day period or else the opportunity to appeal will be lost.
If
the motion is made on time, the fact that it is not decided until
after the 30-day period has expired does not affect the
opportunity to appeal.

To obtain this, a motion for

»*

*

5

An aggrieved party who wishes to take an appeal as of right must do so by

serving and filing a document known as a notice of appeal. Annexed to this summary as

Appendix B is a copy of a form of notice of appeal.

Copies of this notice must be served upon all of the other parties to the case.

Service in this instance may be by regular first class U.S. mail or by personally delivering

it to the attorney(s) for each of the other parties, or upon the party himself or herself if

unrepresented by an attorney. Service (i.e., mailing or personal deliver) must be made by

someone who is over 18 years of age and is not a party to the case fi.e.. the party

appealing may not himself or herself effect service).

The party appealing must also file the original notice of

appeal, together with an original affidavit proving that the notice was served. This affidavit

must be made by the person who served the paper stating under oath when and how the

paper was served and upon whom it was served. The affidavit must be signed before a

notary public. The filing of the original notice of appeal with attached original affidavit(s)

of service and a copy of the order or judgment appealed from must take place in the office

of the Queens County Clerk.

In order to complete the filing, the appellant must also file a document known

as a pre-argument statement A copy of a form of pre-argument statement is annexed
(The pre-argument statement and its attachments will be
transmitted to the Appellate Division and will summarize for that court the appeal being

hereto as Appendix C.

brought.)

The appellant must also pay a fee to the County Clerk of $50.00. This fee

(as well as there expenses) may be avoided only if the appellant obtains a court order

6

!

known as a poor person order. Some complexity is involved in obtaining such an order.

A poor person order for relief from fees on appeal must be obtained from the Appellate

Division, not from this court. A poor person order received from this court at the outset of

a case will not relieve an appellant of the obligation to pay this $50 fee. It is not certain that

the Appellate Division will be wiling to sign a poor person order in any particular case. In

addition, some time will be consumed in obtaining such an order and, as noted above,

there is a rigid time limit within which an appeal must be taken. Failure to take an appeal

in a timely fashion will result in the dismissal of the appeal.

Cross-Appeals

A party who has not initiated an appeal may, upon receipt of a notice of

appeal, wish to taken an appeal too, that is, cross-appeal. Any party taking a cross-appeal

must also be "aggrieved" in some way, i.e., he or she must have actually been harmed in
some respect by what is contended to have been an error of the court. The cross-

appealing party must also serve and file a notice of appeal (or make a motion for

permission to appeal if permission is required) within 30 days after service of the order or

judgment with notice of entry, or within 10 days after service upon him or her of the

adverse party's notice of appeal or motion for leave to appeal, whichever is longer.

Effect of the Appeal on the Order or Judgment

The taking of an appeal does not necessarily halt the effectiveness of the

order or judgment from which the appeal is taken. If an appeal is taken by the State of

New York or any of its governmental subdivisions, the order or judgment which is the
subject of the appeal is automatically stayed, that is, put on "hold." CPLR 5519(a). Other

7

litigants will receive an automatic stay if they put up monies or other asserts or post a bond

sufficient to satisfy the judgment and commit to paying over in the event the appeal is

unsuccessful.

In an appropriate case, if the appealing party makes a motion to stay the

effective date of the order or judgment during the appeal, this court (or the Appellate

Division) may, in its discretion, issue an order granting the stay. See CPLR 5519(c).

"Perfecting" the Appeal

appeal.

In addition to taking the appeal in the manner described above, the appealing

party must pursue the appeal in certain defined ways. This is known as "perfecting" the

If the appeal is taken from a judgment or order arising out of a trial or hearing

at which sworn testimony was taken in open court, the appellant must "order" the transcript

(the court reporters's minutes) of those proceedings, so that the Appellate Division can

have it before it and can review the record of what transpired in the trial court. Most

decisions issued by the Supreme Court, Civil Branch, Queens County are issued on the

basis of motion papers only and therefore in such instances no transcript is required.

In cases where the order or judgment arose out of a trial or hearing at which

oral evidence was taken in open court before a court stenographer (reporter), the

appealing party must serve on the stenographer (Court Reporter) (the office of the Court

Reporters is Room 301/303 and the phone number is (718) 520-3450) a written request

for the transcript and must deposit the fee for the transcript, which is calculated based

upon the length of the transcript. THIS REQUEST MUST BE SERVED WITHIN THE

PERIOD ALLOWED FOR THE TAKING OF THE APPEAL, DISCUSSED ABOVE.

sort.

The parties may agree that only a portion of the proceedings will be

transcribed (typed). This agreement should be in writing and should identify the portions

of the transcript to be transcribed. The transcript is often very expensive and it may be in

the interests of both sides to a case to limit expense by entering into an agreement of this

Once the court reporter has transcribed the record of the proceedings in

response to a request, he or she will deliver an original and one coy of the transcript to the

appealing party. The appealing party should review it for errors. The appealing party

should then serve a copy of the transcript on the other party, together with a list of

suggested corrections, identified by page and line. The parties should consult one another

and endeavor to agree as to what corrections should be made. If the parties cannot agree,

the dispute will have to be resolved by the trial Justice, but it is strongly suggested that the

parties should not impose this burden on the court. See CPLR 5525.

If the parties can agree, they can prepare a written statement of the case,

which may be used in place of a transcript.

The appealing party must also prepare and submit the "record on appeal."

The appellant should review Article 55 of the CPLR and the rules of the Appellate Division

for additional information about the record, deadlines for briefs, and other things. The

appellant may also contact the office of the Clerk of the Appellate Division, Second

Department (718) 875-1300 for additional information.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
