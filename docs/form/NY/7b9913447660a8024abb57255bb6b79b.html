applications:  such number as required by court rule in matters not subject 
to e-filing. 
  

(2)  Authorized e-filers shall delay the filing of such additional hard copies of 
documents until receipt of email notification that the clerk has reviewed and 
approved the electronic version of the document, and shall file the hard copies

file those documents within three business days after restoration of normal 
operations at that site.

245.7. 

Timeliness of Filing and Service; Rejection by Clerk.   

(a)  Filing of E-filed documents.  For purposes of timeliness under a statute or court rule 
or directive, an e-filed document is deemed filed when:  

(1) the document has been electronically transmitted to the NYSCEF site; and  

(2) the appropriate fee, if any, has been paid to the court either through the 
NYSCEF site or, where permitted, by delivery to the office of the Clerk. 

(b)  Service of E-filed Documents.  Upon receipt of an e-filed document and appropriate 
fee, if any, NYSCEF shall immediately notify all e-filers in the matter of the receipt and 
location of the document.  For purposes of timeliness of service under a statute or court 
rule, at the issuance of such notification the document shall be deemed served upon all 
parties other than exempt attorneys and exempt litigants. 

(c)  Rejection by the Clerk.  An e-filed document deemed filed for purposes of timeliness 
under this Part may thereafter be reviewed and rejected by the Clerk for any reason 
provided by this Part or any applicable statute, rule or order, or as otherwise unsuitable 
for filing.   

(d)  Hard Copy Filing or Service.  The timeliness of service or filing in hard copy 
pursuant to these rules shall be as provided by statute or court directive. 

245.8.  

Confidentiality; Sealed Documents; Redaction.   

E-filed matters deemed confidential by statute or court directive, as well as sealed 
documents or documents that are the subject of an application to seal in an e-filed matter, 
shall be filed and maintained on the NYSCEF site in a manner that precludes viewing by 
the public and such other persons as the case may require.  In all matters, authorized e-
filers shall attest to compliance with statutory redaction requirements (e.g., General 
Business Law § 399-ddd) and relevant sealing requirements in filings.   

245.9. 

Authorized Record; Scanning of Documents by Clerk. 

(a)  The court may deem documents e-filed or uploaded by the parties to be the official 
record of a cause or matter.  

(b)  The clerk may scan and upload hard copy filings in a cause, and may deem such 
uploaded documents to be the official record copy of the filing.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
