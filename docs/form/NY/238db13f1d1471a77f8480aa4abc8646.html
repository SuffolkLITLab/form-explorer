1.  Introduction. 

 
This  pamphlet  is  intended  as  a  general  guide  to  assist  a  person  in  prosecuting  a 
civil  matter  in  the  Appellate  Division,  Second  Department.    It  is  not  intended  to  cover  all 
situations but, rather, to assist in the general steps needed to invoke the jurisdiction of this court, 
to  perfect  an  appeal,  and  to  submit  a  motion.    For  more  information,  the  reader’s  attention  is 
directed  to  the  Civil  Practice  Law  and  Rules  (CPLR)  articles  55  and  57  and  the  Rules  of  this 
court. 

§ 1.1 

Jurisdiction; counties; courts. 

 
The  Appellate  Division  is  an  intermediate  appellate  court.    There  are  four 
departments  of  the  Appellate  Division  in  New  York  State:    the  First  Department  is  located  in 
Manhattan, the Second Department in Brooklyn, the Third Department in Albany, and the Fourth 
Department in Rochester.  The jurisdiction of the Second Department encompasses the counties 
of  Richmond,  Kings,  Queens,  Nassau,  Suffolk,  Westchester,  Dutchess,  Orange,  Rockland,  and 
Putnam. 

 
The Second Department hears appeals in civil cases from orders, judgments, and 
decrees of the Court of Claims, the Supreme Court, the Family Court, and the Surrogate's Court 
and,  if  permission  is  granted,  of  the  Appellate  Terms  of  the  Supreme  Court.    In  addition,  the 
court  has  original  jurisdiction  in  a  limited  number  of  other  matters  (e.g.,  CPLR  article  78 
proceedings  against  a  Supreme  Court  Justice  or  County  Court  Judge  and  CPLR  5704[a] 
applications). 

2.  Standing; Aggrievement. 

There are certain limitations on a party's right to appeal.  To take an appeal a party 
 
must have standing, meaning that the party is "aggrieved" by the determination made by the trial 
court  (CPLR  5511).    Basically,  a  party  is  "aggrieved"  if  an  application  that  party  made  was 
denied or not fully granted, or if an application made by the party's adversary, which the party 
opposed, was fully or partially granted. 

3.  Appealability. 

§ 3.1 

Appealable paper. 

An  appeal  may  be  taken  only  from  an  "appealable  paper,"  that  is,  an  order, 
 
judgment, or decree of a court, signed by a Judge, which formally grants or denies relief after a 
hearing or trial, or requested in a motion made on notice.  A decision, whether transcribed in the 
minutes  or  in  writing,  is  not  appealable.    Rulings  made  during  a  hearing  or  trial  are  not 
appealable.  Often a Judge will issue a written memorandum which concludes "submit order" or 
"settle order on notice"; such a paper is merely a decision from which no appeal lies. 

§ 3.2 

Appeal as of right. 

 
permission of this court, others may not be appealed at all. 

Not  all  orders  are  appealable  as  a  matter  of  right;  some  may  be  appealed  with 

1

 

 2

Generally,  an  appeal  may  be  taken  as  of  right  from  a  final  or  interlocutory 
 
judgment  and  from  an  order  which  determines  a  motion  made  on  notice  and  which  adversely 
affects a substantial right of the appellant (CPLR 5701). 

§ 3.3 

Appeal by permission. 

 
The most common orders which are not appealable as of right but which may be 
appealed  with  permission  of  this  court  include  orders  made  in  CPLR  article  78  proceedings 
(CPLR 5701[b][1]), and nondispositional orders of the Family Court, other than those made in an 
abuse or neglect proceeding (Family Court  Act § 1112[a]).  Orders of the Appellate Term that 
determine an appeal from a judgment or order of a lower court are appealable by permission of 
the Appellate Term or, in case of refusal, by order of this court (CPLR 5703[a]); other orders of 
the Appellate Term are not appealable.  Leave to appeal may be sought from this court by motion 
on  notice  to  the  other  parties  (a  discussion  on  motion  practice  may  be  found  in  Part  8  of  this 
pamphlet). 

§ 3.4 

Nonappealable orders. 

 
No  appeal  at  all  lies  from  an  order  entered  upon  the  default  or  consent  of  the 
appealing  party,  or  from  an  order  that  denies  reargument,  or  from  an  order  which  denies  an 
adjournment of an ongoing proceeding. 

4.  Invoking the Appellate Jurisdiction of the Court. 

§ 4.1 

Notice of appeal. 

 
If a party decides to appeal as of right from an order, judgment, or decree, he or 
she must file a notice of appeal in duplicate.  The notice of appeal must be filed in the office of 
the clerk of the court which made the paper appealed from and an additional copy must be served 
on each adversary (CPLR 5515; 22 NYCRR 1250.3[a]; § 670.3[a]; a sample notice of appeal is 
annexed to this pamphlet).  On an appeal from a judgment or order of the Supreme Court, CPLR 
8022(a) requires a party to pay a filing fee of $65 to the County Clerk upon the filing of a notice 
of  appeal.    A  notice  of  appeal  must  be  filed  and  served  within  30  days  after  the  appellant  is 
served with a copy of the order, judgment, or decree, with notice of its entry, or, if the appellant 
has served a copy of that paper on his or her opponent with notice of its entry, within 30 days 
after such service (CPLR 5513[a]). 

§ 4.2 

Informational Statement. 

 
The  appellant  in  a  civil  cause  must  file  an  Informational  Statement  (see  22 
NYCRR 1250.03[a]; § 670.3[a]) with the notice of appeal.  A copy of the form is annexed to this 
pamphlet and available on the court’s website.  The notice of appeal must be filed in duplicate 
and annexed must be the Informational Statement, a copy of the paper appealed from, and a copy 
of  the  decision  leading  to  that  paper,  if  any.    If  a  party  wishes  to  appeal  from  more  than  one 
paper, made in the same case, with the same notice of appeal, he or she must attach to each Form 
A  an  Additional  Appeal  Information  form  (Form  B,  a  copy  of  which  is  annexed  to  this 
pamphlet). 

 

 

Where a proceeding commenced in the Supreme Court is transferred to this court, 
 
the  petitioner  must  file  forthwith  in  this  court  two  copies  of  the  order  of  transfer,  to  each  of 
which must be affixed an Informational Statement and any opinion or decision of the transferring 
court (22 NYCRR 1250.3[a]; § 670.3[a]). 

 
On the Informational Statement, the title should be set forth as it appears on the 
summons, notice of petition or order to show cause commencing the civil cause. The names of 
all  parties  must  be  listed,  together  with  their  status  in  the  trial  court  (e.g.,  plaintiff,  petitioner, 
claimant, defendant, respondent, defendant third-party plaintiff, third-party defendant) and their 
status  in  the  Appellate  Division  (e.g.,  appellant,  respondent,  appellant-respondent,  respondent-
appellant).  If a party to the action has no status in the Appellate Division, the word "none" is to 
be  entered  in  the  space  provided  on  the  form.    Where  the  Appellate  Division  is  the  court  of 
original instance (e.g., the matter is a proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 against a Supreme 
Court Justice or County Court Judge commenced in this court pursuant to CPLR 506[b][1] or an 
application  for  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus)  only  the  column  entitled  "Appellate  Division  Status" 
need be completed. 

§ 4.3 

Docket Number 

An Appellate Division docket number will be assigned to each cause.  The docket 
 
number  must  appear  in  the  upper  right-hand  corner,  opposite  the  title,  on  all  papers  thereafter 
filed with the court.  If the papers relate to multiple causes, they must bear the docket numbers of 
all those causes. 

5.  Perfecting an Appeal. 

An appeal is perfected by the filing of a brief and a record.  The record may be a 
 
full  reproduced  record,  an  appendix,  an  agreed  statement  of  facts,  or,  when  authorized,  the 
original papers. 

§ 5.1 

Preparing to perfect — the record. 

 
judgment or order, stating in relevant part: 

CPLR  5526  specifies  the  papers  which  constitute  the  record  on  appeal  from  a 

“The  record  on  appeal  from  a  final  judgment  shall  consist  of  the 
notice of appeal, the judgment-roll,  the corrected transcript of the 
proceedings  *  *  *  if  a  trial  or  hearing  was  held,  any  relevant 
exhibits,  or  copies  of  them,  in  the  court  of  original  instance,  any 
other reviewable order, and any opinions in the case. The record on 
appeal from an interlocutory judgment or any order shall consist of 
the  notice  of  appeal,  the  judgment  or  order  appealed  from,  the 
transcript,  if  any,  the  papers  and  other  exhibits  upon  which  the 
judgment or order was founded and any opinions in the case.” 

Generally,  the  judgment,  order,  or  decree  will  specify  the  papers  upon  which  it 
 
was  made.    It  is  the  appellant’s  responsibility  to  obtain  accurate  and  complete  copies  of  the 
papers comprising the record on file in the office of the clerk of the court that made the paper 

3

appealed from, and in the event that it was made after a trial or hearing, to obtain the transcript of 
the proceedings. 

§ 5.2 

Obtaining and settling the transcript. 

 
In  general,  if  the  appeal  is  from  a  judgment,  order,  or  decree  that  was  made 
following a trial or hearing, the party taking the appeal will have to furnish the court and his or 
her  adversary  with  a  copy  of  the  minutes.    The  minutes  taken  by  the  court  reporter  in 
stenographic  form  or  recorded  on  tape  must  be  transcribed  into  English.  The  rates  of 
compensation of court reporters for transcribing stenographic minutes are set forth in § 108.2 of 
the  Rules  of  the  Chief  Administrator  of  the  courts  (22  NYCRR  §  108.2).    Different  rates  are 
specified for furnishing minutes in the regular course of the reporter’s business and for expedited 
production of the transcript.  In order to meet the time limits for perfecting an appeal set by the 
rules of the court, it is imperative that the transcript be ordered from the court reporter promptly 
after the filing of the notice of appeal. 

 
After the transcript is received from the court reporter, it must either be stipulated 
as correct  by the parties or settled pursuant to CPLR  5525.  The procedure for  settlement of  a 
transcript is set forth in CPLR 5525(c), which states: 

“(c) Settlement of transcript. 

“1. Within fifteen days after receiving the transcript from the court 
reporter  or  from  any  other  source,  the  appellant  shall  make  any 
proposed amendments and serve them and a copy of the transcript 
upon  the  respondent.  Within  fifteen  days  after  such  service  the 
respondent shall make any proposed amendments or objections to 
the proposed amendments of the appellant and serve them upon the 
appellant. At any time thereafter and on at least four days' notice to 
the adverse party, the transcript and the proposed amendments and 
objections thereto shall be submitted for settlement to the judge or 
referee before whom the proceedings were had if the parties cannot 
agree  on  the  amendments  to  the  transcript.  The  original  of  the 
transcript shall be corrected by the appellant in accordance with the 
agreement  of  the  parties  or  the  direction  of  the  court  and  its 
correctness shall be certified to thereon by the parties or the judge 
or referee before whom the proceedings were had. When he serves 
his  brief  upon  the  respondent  the  appellant  shall  also  serve  a 
conformed  copy of  the transcript or  deposit it  in the office of  the 
clerk of the court of original instance who shall make it available 
to respondent. 

“2.  If  the  appellant  has  timely  proposed  amendments  and  served 
them  with  a  copy  of  the  transcript  on  respondent,  and  no 
amendments  or  objections  are  proposed  by  the  respondent  within 
the time limited by paragraph 1, the transcript, certified as correct 
together  with  appellant's  proposed 
by 
amendments,  shall  be  deemed  correct  without  the  necessity  of  a 
stipulation  by  the  parties  certifying  to  its  correctness  or  the 

the  court  reporter, 

 

 4

 

 

settlement of the  transcript by the judge  or  referee. The  appellant 
shall  affix  to  such  transcript  an  affirmation,  certifying  to  his 
compliance  with  the  time  limitation,  the  service  of  the  notice 
provided  by  paragraph  3  and  the  respondent's  failure  to  propose 
amendments or objections within the time prescribed. 

“3. Appellant shall serve on respondent together with a copy of the 
transcript  and  the  proposed  amendments,  a  notice  of  settlement 
containing a specific reference to subdivision (c) of this  rule, and 
stating  that  if  respondent  fails  to  propose  amendments  or 
objections within the time limited by paragraph 1, the provisions of 
paragraph 2 shall apply.”  

§ 5.3 

Time limitations. 

 
1250.10 (a) of the Practice Rules of the Appellate Division provides: 

The court has imposed time limits upon the perfection of a civil cause.  Section 

"(a) Civil Matters. In the event that  an appellant fails to perfect  a 
civil matter within six months of the date of the notice of appeal, 
the  order  of  transfer,  or  the  order  granting  leave  to  appeal,  as 
extended pursuant to section 1250.9(b) of this Part, the matter shall 
be deemed dismissed without further order." 

A party needing additional time to perfect an appeal or serve and file a brief must 
 
obtain an extension of time to do so.  Such an extension may be obtained by agreement with the 
other  parties  to  the  appeal,  embodied  in  a  written  stipulation  filed  with  the  court,  or  by  an 
application in the form of a letter addressed to the clerk setting forth a reason why more time is 
needed (22 NYCRR § 1250.9[b],[g]; 670.9[b]). 

§ 5.4 
1250.6, 1250.7, 1250.8; 670.9, 670.10.1). 

General requirements of records, appendices, briefs (see, 22 NYCRR §§ 

 
An appeal may be prosecuted upon a full reproduced record (CPLR 5528[a][5]), 
an appendix (CPLR 5528[f][5]), an agreed statement of facts in lieu of record (CPLR 5527), or, 
where  authorized  by  statute,  the  Rules  of  this  court,  or  an  order  of  this  court,  upon  a  record 
consisting of the original papers. 

 
A party must file six copies of a record, appendix, or agreed statement, and of the 
brief,  one  of  which  should  be  marked  "original",  with  proof  of  service  of  one  copy  on  each 
adversary (22 NYCRR  §1250.9[a],[c],[d]).  In addition, one digital copy  of each brief must be 
submitted  to  the  court  (22  NYCRR  §§  1250.9[a],[c],[d];  670.9[a]).    The  document  must  be 
bound on the left side; the pages must be 8 l/2 by 11 inches; no metal fasteners or similar hard 
material may protrude; volumes may not exceed two inches in thickness. 

 
There must be a cover which, among other things, sets forth the title of the action 
with  the  parties'  status  in  the  trial  court  as  well  as  in  the  Appellate  Division  (e.g.,  plaintiff-
appellant; defendant-respondent).  The cover of a record, appendix, or agreed statement should 
include  the  names,  addresses,  telephone  numbers  and  e-mail  addresses  of  all  attorneys  and

identify the parties they represent, and the index number of the matter in the trial court (a sample 
cover for a record is annexed to this pamphlet). 

 
A record, appendix, agreed statement and brief must contain a statement pursuant 
to CPLR 553l, setting forth the information required by that statute (a sample statement pursuant 
to CPLR 5531 is annexed to this pamphlet). 

 
The  clerk  may  refuse  to  accept  any  document  which  does  not  comply  with  the 
Rules,  is  incomplete,  untimely,  is  not  legible  or  otherwise  fails  to  comply  with  any  applicable 
statute, rule or order (22 NYCRR § 1250.1[g]). 

 
If appeals  are  taken from  more than one  paper  in the same  matter, they may be 
consolidated and prosecuted in one record and brief (22 NYCRR § 1250.9[f][3]).  Each appeal 
must be timely perfected in accordance with the Rules (22 NYCRR § 1250.9[f][3]).  

 
A  record  or  appendix  may  not  contain  a  transcript  of  testimony  given  at  a  trial, 
hearing, or deposition reproduced in a condensed format such that two or more pages in standard 
format appear on one page unless the transcript was submitted in that format to the court from 
which the appeal is taken (22 NYCRR § 1250.7[e])

appeal  (or  order  of  transfer,  or  order  granting  leave  to  appeal),  a  copy  of  the  paper  appealed 
from,  the  underlying  decision,  if  any,  and  the  papers  submitted  to  the  trial  court  (e.g.,  motion 
papers, trial testimony).  Materials not submitted to the trial court are not part of the record. 

 

The record and brief may not be bound together and filed as a single document. 

§ 5.8 

The appendix. 

Like a record, an appendix must contain a table of contents, a statement pursuant 
 
to  CPLR  5531,  a  copy  of  the  notice  of  appeal  (or  order  of  transfer,  or  order  granting  leave  to 
appeal), a copy of the paper appealed from, and the underlying decision, if any.  However, unlike 
a record, a party need only submit so much of the papers (or testimony) that were before the trial 
court  as  the  party  deems  necessary  to  permit  the  court  to  fully  consider  the  issues  raised;  the 
party  must  include  papers  (or  testimony)  benefitting  the  adversary  as  well  as  his  or  her  own 
position (CPLR 5528[a][5]; 22 NYCRR § 1250.7[a]).   

When an appendix is filed, the party must arrange with the clerk of the court from 
 
which the appeal was taken to send the entire original file to the Appellate Division (22 NYCRR 
§ 1250.9(a)[2][i]).  If a trial or hearing was held and all of the testimony is not included in the 
appendix,  a  complete  set  of  the  minutes  must  be  submitted  to  this  court  (22  NYCRR 
1250.7[d][4]). 

§ 5.9 

The agreed statement.  

 
The statement, in proper form and properly bound,  must be submitted as a joint 
appendix.  It must also contain a table of contents, a statement pursuant to CPLR 5531, a copy of 
the notice of appeal (or order of transfer, or order granting leave to appeal), a copy of the paper 
appealed  from,  the  underlying  decision,  if  any,  and  a  statement  of  the  issues  to  be  determined 
(CPLR 5527; 22 NYCRR § 1250.5[d]). 

§ 5.10 

The original record. 

 
Certain matters may be prosecuted as a matter of right upon a record consisting of 
the original papers.  These include appeals from Family Court orders (Family Court Act § 1116), 
appeals  under  the  Human  Rights  Law  (Executive  Law  §  298),  and  appeals  arising  under  the 
Election Law.  In addition, an appellant or petitioner may be granted leave to perfect using the 
original record method by order of this court upon motion (22 NYCRR § 1250.5[e]). 

§ 5.11 

Briefs. 

 
Briefs  prepared  on  a  computer  shall  be  printed  in  either  a  14-point  serifed, 
proportionally spaced typeface (expect that footnotes may be printed in type of no less than 12 
points), or a 12-point serifed, monospaced typeface containing no more than 10½ characters per 
inch (except that footnotes may be printed in type of no less than 10 points).  Typewritten briefs 
shall be neatly prepared in clear type of no less than elite in size and in a pitch of no more than 
12 characters per inch.  Computer-generated appellant’s and respondent’s briefs must not exceed 
14,000  words,  and  reply  and  amicus  curiae  briefs  must  not  exceed  7,000  words,  inclusive  of 
point headings and footnotes and exclusive of pages containing the table of contents or table of 
citations.  Typewritten appellants’ and respondents’ briefs must not exceed 50 pages, and reply 

7

 

 8

briefs and amicus curiae briefs must not exceed 25 pages, exclusive of pages containing the table 
of contents or table of citations.  If a party’s brief exceeds these limitations, he or she must seek 
advance permission from the clerk of the Appellate Division by a letter annexed to a draft of the 
brief (22 NYCRR § 1250.9[h]).  

 
In the upper right-hand corner of the cover of a brief, the party upon whose behalf 
it is filed must state the time requested for argument and who will argue, or the court will deem 
that  brief  submitted  without  oral  argument  (a  sample  cover  for  a  brief  is  annexed  to  this 
pamphlet). 

 
The appellant's brief must contain a statement pursuant to CPLR 5531; a table of 
contents, including the points urged in the brief; a concise statement of the facts of the case; a 
statement of the questions raised; the arguments divided by the points urged; and, if the appeal is 
being  prosecuted  on  the  original  record,  a  copy  of  the  paper  appealed  from,  the  underlying 
decision, if any, and a copy of the notice of appeal (22 NYCRR § 1250.8[b]). 

The respondent's brief must contain a table of contents, including the points urged 
 
in  the  brief;  and  argument  arranged  under  the  point  headings  urged  (22  NYCRR  §  1250.8[c]).  
The  respondent's  brief  is  due  30  days  after  service  of  the  appellant's  brief  (22  NYCRR  § 
1250.9[c]). 

 
The  reply  brief  must  contain  a  table  of  contents  and  reply  to  the  respondent's 
arguments  (22  NYCRR  §  1250.8[d]).    A  reply  brief  may  be  filed  no  later  than  10  days  after 
service of the respondent's brief (22 NYCRR § 1250.9[d]). 

A  party  must  file  six  copies  of  the  brief  and  serve  one  on  each  adversary  (22 

 
NYCRR § 1250.9). 

 
Briefs must be signed in accordance with § 130-1.1-a(a) of the Rules of the Chief 
Administrator  of  the  Courts  (22  NYCRR  §  130-1.1-a[a];  see,  §  10.3  of  this  pamphlet).    All 
briefs, except those that are handwritten, must also contain a printing specifications statement. 22 
NYCRR § 1250.8[j].           

§ 5.12 

Constitutionality of statute. 

 
If the constitutionality of a State statute is involved, and the State is not a party, 
the party raising the issue must serve a copy of his or her brief on the State Attorney-General (22 
NYCRR § 1250.9[i]). 

§ 5.13 

Filing fee. 

 
CPLR 8022(b) requires that a fee of $315 be paid upon the perfection of a civil 
appeal.  The fee must be paid irrespective of the method by which an appeal is perfected, i.e., by 
the full  record,  appendix, or original  papers method, unless the party is  exempt (e.g., has been 
granted poor person relief pursuant to CPLR 1102). 

§ 5.14 

Request for argument. 

A party who wishes to argue a cause must make a request for time to do so.  The 
 
request  is  made  at  the  time  the  brief  is  filed  in  the  form  of  a  notation  in  the  upper  right-hand 
corner of its cover stating that the cause is to be argued, the time actually required for argument, 

 

 

and the name of the attorney or party pro se who will argue (22 NYCRR § 1250.8[a]; a sample 
cover of a brief is annexed to this pamphlet).  Parties who do not wish to argue should mark their 
brief: “To be submitted.” 

 
is allowed (22 NYCRR § 670.15[a]). 

Court rules permit argument of up to 15 minutes on all appeals in which argument 

 
Rules of the Second Department provides: 

Argument  is  not  allowed  as  to  certain  issues.    Section  670.15(b)  of  the  Practice 

the 

"(b)  Argument proscribed.  Argument is not permitted on issues 
involving  maintenance;  spousal  support;  child  support;  counsel 
fees; 
legality,  propriety  or  excessiveness  of  sentences; 
determinations made pursuant to the sex offender registration act; 
grand jury reports; and calendar and practice matters including but 
not  limited  to  preferences,  bills  of  particulars,  correction  of 
trial,  physical  examinations, 
pleadings,  examinations  before 
discovery  of  records,  interrogatories,  change  of  venue,  and 
transfers of actions to and from the Supreme Court." 

A  party  who  has  not  filed  a  brief  may  not  orally  argue  (22  NYCRR 
 
1250.15[c][1]).    The  court  retains  the  right  to  deny  oral  argument  of  any  cause  (22  NYCRR 
1250.15[c][1]). 

6.  Special Proceedings. 

§ 6.1 

Original CPLR article 78 proceedings. 

 
The  most  common  form  of  invoking  the  original  jurisdiction  of  this  court  is  a 
CPLR article 78 proceeding against a Supreme Court Justice or County Court Judge commenced 
in this court pursuant to CPLR 506(b)(1) (e.g., to prohibit the Justice or Judge from performing 
an  act  or  to  compel  him  or  her  to  perform  an  act  mandated  by  law).    The  proceeding  may  be 
commenced  by  notice  of  petition  and  petition  or  by  order  to  show  cause  and  petition.    If  the 
proceeding is commenced by notice of petition, the party must give the adversary 20 days notice 
(CPLR 7804[c]).  Orders to show cause are explained in § 8.2 of this pamphlet. 

§ 6.2 

Transferred CPLR article 78 proceedings. 

One of the issues that may be raised in a CPLR article 78 proceeding commenced 
 
in the Supreme Court is whether an administrative determination made after a hearing at which 
evidence is taken is supported by substantial evidence (CPLR 7803[4]).  Where such an issue is 
raised, the proceeding must be transferred to this court for disposition (CPLR 7804[g]). 

 
A  CPLR  article  78  proceeding  transferred  to  this  court  must  be  perfected  by  a 
method specified by section 670.9 of the Rules, e.g., upon a full reproduced record, an appendix, 
an agreed statement or, if authorized by statute, rule, or order of this  court,  the original  record 
(see, 22 NYCRR § 1250.12[a]). 

9

 

§ 6.3 

Writ of habeas corpus. 

 
A  Justice  of  this  court  may  issue  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus  or  an  order  to  show 
cause  commencing  a  habeas  corpus  proceeding  to  challenge  the  legality  of  the  detention  of  a 
person held within the jurisdiction of this Department (CPLR 7002[b][2]).  Generally, this court 
will  entertain  original  jurisdiction  over,  and  hear  argument  on,  only  those  habeas  corpus 
proceedings  challenging  bail  as being excessive.   Ordinarily, the resolution of a habeas  corpus 
proceeding raising issues other than the excessiveness of bail will involve disputed questions of 
fact and an application for a writ in such a case should be presented to the appropriate trial level 
court in the county in which the individual who is the subject of the writ is detained. If presented 
to  a  Justice  of  this  court  for  signature,  such  a  writ  will  usually  be  made  returnable  in  the 
appropriate trial level court. 

§ 6.4 

Other special proceedings. 

Various  State  statutes  permit  a  limited  number  of  other  proceedings  to  be 
 
commenced  in  this  court.    Litigants  should  refer  specifically  to  those  provisions  for  more 
information and to section 1250.13 of the Practice Rules of the Appellate Division. 

§ 6.5 

Filing fee. 

 
petition or order to show cause commencing a special proceeding in this court. 

CPLR 8022(b) requires that a fee of $315 be paid upon the filing of a notice of 

7.  CPLR 5704. 

CPLR 5704(a) gives this court authority to review ex parte orders of a Justice of 
 
the Supreme Court, a Judge of a Family Court or Court of Claims, or a Surrogate.  If both parties 
submitted papers to the Justice, Judge, or Surrogate, the order is not ex parte and CPLR 5704(a) 
review does not lie. 

 
If the trial court granted relief ex parte (e.g., granted a temporary restraining order 
in an order to show cause), then one Justice of the Appellate Division may vacate or modify the 
order.  A panel of Justices is needed to grant relief that the trial court declined to grant. 

Section 1250.4(b)(2) of the Practice Rules of the Appellate Division requires that 
 
the party seeking relief pursuant to CPLR 5704(a) give his or her adversary reasonable notice of 
the date, time and place that the application will be made and of the relief being requested.  The 
papers must include an affidavit describing the notice given and the position of the other party.  
If the party submitting the application is unwilling to give notice, he or she must state the reason 
for such unwillingness.  Section 670.4(a)(1) of the Rules of Practice of the Second Department 
requires that this notice be accompanied by a copy of the papers the party seeking relief intends 
to present to the court for filing to the extent practicable. 

 
for at the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court. 

The Appellate Division will not review an ex parte order to show cause  applied 

 10

 

 

8.  Motion Practice. 

 
If a party needs to seek relief from the court prior to or after the filing of records 
and briefs, the party must proceed by way of a motion, which may be brought on by a notice of 
motion or order to show cause.   

 
Oral argument is not permitted on motions.  On the return date they are deemed 
submitted  and  counsel  or  self-represented  parties  should  not  appear  at  the  courthouse  (22 
NYCRR § 1250.4[a][8]). 

§ 8.1 

Notice of motion. 

If time is not of the essence and interim relief with a temporary restraining order 
 
(TRO) is not needed, the movant should proceed by notice of motion (a sample notice of motion 
is annexed to this pamphlet).  Motions prosecuted by notice of motion may be made returnable at 
10:00 A.M. on any Monday, except holidays (22 NYCRR § 1250.4[a][1]).  The party making the 
motion  is  required  to  give  his  or  her  adversary  at  least  eight  days  notice  if  the  papers  are 
delivered in person, and at least l3 days notice if they are served by mail.  The moving papers 
should  be  filed  with  the  court  at  least  one  week  before  the  return  date  and  opposition  papers 
should  be  filed  by  4:00  P.M.  on  the  business  day  before  the  return  date  (22  NYCRR  § 
1250.4[2],[5]). 

 
The  motion  papers  must  contain  a  copy  of  the  notice  of  appeal  and  the  paper 
appealed from (22 NYCRR §1250.4[a][3]), an affidavit setting forth the background of the case 
and  why  the  relief  requested  should  be  granted,  any  other  exhibits  or  affidavits  deemed 
necessary, and an affidavit stating that the papers were served upon the adversary. 

 
must be served and filed three business days prior thereto (22 NYCRR § 1250.4[a][6]). 

A cross motion must be made returnable the same day as the original motion and 

§ 8.2 

Order to show cause. 

If time is of the essence or a TRO is needed, the moving party should proceed by 
 
order to show cause (a sample order to show cause is annexed to this pamphlet).  The order to 
show cause must be signed by a Justice of this court.  The TRO should be set forth in a separate 
paragraph.  The granting of a TRO lies within the discretion of the Justice who signs the order to 
show cause; it is not granted as a matter of course.  The court will insert the return date of the 
application  and  it  will  usually  be  a  shorter  period  than  if  the  motion  were  made  by  notice  of 
motion.    The  signing  of  an  order  to  show  cause  is  discretionary,  and,  if  it  is  not  signed,  the 
movant may proceed by notice of motion. 

 
The  movant  must  include  with  the  order  to  show  cause  a  copy  of  the  notice  of 
appeal  and paper appealed from, an affidavit setting forth the background of the case and why 
the relief requested should be granted, if a TRO is requested what immediate harm would result 
if it is not granted, and any other exhibits or affidavits deemed necessary.   

§ 8.3 

Temporary restraining order. 

 
As  with  an  application  pursuant  to  CPLR  5704  (see,  Part  7  of  this  pamphlet), 
section  670.5(e)  of  the  Rules  requires  that  an  applicant  for  a  TRO  give  his  or  her  adversary 

11

reasonable notice of the date, time, and place that the application for the order to show cause will 
be  made,  and  the  nature  of  the  relief  requested.    The  motion  papers  must  include  an  affidavit 
describing the notice given and the position of the other party.  Section 670.4(a)(1) of the Rules 
of Practice of the Second Department requires that this notice be accompanied by a copy of the 
papers the party seeking relief intends to present to the court for filing to the extent practicable.  
If  the  movant  is  unwilling  to  give  notice,  he  or  she  must  set  forth  the  reasons  for  such 
unwillingness.  If  an  attorney  or  a  party  pro  se  is  seeking  a  TRO,  he  or  she  must  personally 
appear unless excused (22 NYCRR § 1250.4[b][1]). 

§ 8.4 

Motions to reargue, resettle, amend. 

Motions for reargument or to resettle or amend a decision and order of this court 
 
shall be made within 30 days after service of a copy of the decision and order with notice of its 
entry in the office of the clerk of this court (22 NYCRR § 1250.16[d][1]).   

§ 8.5 

Filing fee for motions. 

 
CPLR 8022(b) provides that the fee for filing a motion or cross motion regarding 
a civil appeal or special proceeding is $45.  However, no fee is payable for a motion which seeks 
poor person relief pursuant to CPLR 1101(a). 

9.  The Calendar. 

§ 9.1 

The general calendar. 

When a matter is perfected it is placed on the court’s general calendar to await the 
 
filing  of  answering  and  reply  briefs,  if  any,  before  it  can  be  placed  on  the  day  calendar  for 
argument  or  submission  to  a  panel  of  Justices.  Unless  a  preference  is  granted,  matters  are 
generally heard in the order in which they are perfected. 

§ 9.2 

Preferences. 

 
It  will  take  several  months  after  a  matter  is  perfected  before  it  will  appear  on  a 
day calendar.  A party who is entitled by law to a preference (to have the matter taken out of turn 
and heard on a date certain) may serve and file a demand for that relief at the time the matter is 
perfected,  setting  forth  the  provision  of  law  relied  upon  and  the  basis  for  the  preference  (22 
NYCRR § 1250.15[a][1]).  In all other cases, if a party desires an early calendar date, he or she 
must move for a preference on papers showing good cause why the case should be preferred over 
other matters (22 NYCRR § 1250.15[b]). 

§ 9.3 

The day calendar; notice. 

 
The  court  schedules  cases  for  a  hearing  before  a  particular  panel  of  Justices  by 
publishing  its  day  calendars  in  the  New  York  Law  Journal  and  on  its  web  site  at 
www.nycourts.gov/courts/ad2/calendar/.  No  other official  notice is  provided to litigants.  Oral 
argument will not be rescheduled because of the failure of a litigant to obtain actual prior notice 
of the appearance of a cause on the day calendar. 

 

 12

 

 

§ 9.4 

The call of the day calendar and argument or submission. 

 
Unless otherwise ordered, the court convenes at 10 o’clock in the morning in the 
courtroom in its courthouse located at 45 Monroe Place in Brooklyn, New York. Court sessions 
are held every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and 
Friday,  excepting  public  holidays  and  during 
certain recess periods (22 NYCRR § 670.1[b]). 

The first  order of business  is  the 
 
call of the day calendar by the Justice Presiding.  
Parties who marked the cover of their brief with 
an argument request and who still wish to argue 
must  answer  the  calendar  call  and  state  the 
amount  of  time  required.    Those  who  made  an 
argument  request  on  their  brief  but  who  no 
longer wish to argue, may submit simply by not 
appearing  in  court  at  the  call  of  the  calendar.  
The court will then mark their appeal submitted 
without argument.  Thereafter the cases will be 
heard  in  the  order  that  they  appear  on  the  day 
calendar. 

10.  Frivolous Conduct — Costs & Sanctions; 
the Signing Requirement. 

 
attorneys  who 
prosecute  frivolous  appeals  or  proceedings  or 
engage in frivolous motion practice in this court 
are subject to the imposition of an award to their 
opponent of costs in the form of reimbursement 
of actual expenses reasonably incurred and reasonable attorneys fees, and to a sanction of up to

11.  Miscellaneous. 

§ 11.1 

Poor person relief; relief from printing requirement. 

If a party wishes to be exempt from payment of  the $315 filing  fee  to perfect  a 
 
civil appeal or special proceeding, the $45 filing fee for motions and cross motions, and/or the 
requirement that a civil appeal or proceeding be perfected using a printed record or appendix, he 
or she must move for poor person relief (CPLR 1101, 1102).  The papers must be served on the 
Corporation Counsel if the appeal arises from a court in New York City or the County Attorney 
if not in the city (CPLR 1101[c]).  If a party is unable to afford the expense of printing a record 
or  appendix,  but  would  not  qualify  for  poor  person  relief,  he  or  she  may  submit  a  motion  for 
permission to prosecute the appeal on the original record. 

§ 11.2 

Filings. 

All papers required to be filed at the court (e.g., records, briefs and motions) are 
 
deemed filed only as of the time they are actually received and stamped by the office of the Clerk 
(22 NYCRR § 1250.1[c][ii]).

Supreme Court of the State of New York 
Appellate Division: Second Judicial Department 

COMPLYING WITH THE SIGNING REQUIREMENT OF 22 NYCRR 130-1.1-a 

Papers filed with this court in most civil causes must be signed.  The signature constitutes 
a certification by the signer that the presentation of the paper or the contentions therein are not 
frivolous (22 NYCRR 130-1.1-a). 

The  requirement  applies  to  civil  appeals,  habeas  corpus  proceedings,  original  and 
transferred CPLR article 78 proceedings, most Family Court proceedings (e.g., support, custody, 
visitation,  abuse  and  neglect),  and all  other  actions  or  proceedings  commenced  in  this  court  in 
the first instance. 

The requirement is not applicable to criminal cases, to Family Court cases arising under 
articles 3 (juvenile delinquency), 7 (PINS), and 8 (family offenses) of the Family Court Act, and 
to appeals in cases originating in a town or village court or a small claims part (see, 22 NYCRR 
130-1.1[a]). 

When a signature is required, any attorney with the firm can sign.  The signature must be 
an autograph in ink and must be on the original of the paper that is to be filed in the office of the 
clerk of this court.  The attorney's name must be typed or printed below the signature.

Records & Appendices 

Records and appendices on appeals and on proceedings transferred to this court need not 
be  signed,  the  papers  contained  therein  having  been  subject  to  the  application  of  the  signature 
rule in the court of original instance. 

Briefs 

The "original" of the brief to be filed with the court must bear an ink autograph signature.

Motions in General 

Motions 

There are four preferred methods of signing: (1) by signing the actual paper, such as an 
affidavit,  (2)  by  signing  a  cover  paper,  such  as  a  notice  of  motion,  (3)  by  signing  a  space 
provided for that purpose on a litigation back that encloses the motion papers to be filed, or (4) 
by  signing  a  separate  form  that  lists  the  accompanying  papers.  A  form  for  this  purpose  is 
available in the office of the clerk.  Some of these methods are better adapted than others for use 
in different types of motion practice.  

Motions Prosecuted by Notice of Motion. 

The  preferred  method  for  complying  with  the  signing  requirement  on  a  motion 
prosecuted  by  notice  of  motion  is  a  signature  on  the  notice  of  motion  itself.    Alternatively, 
signing a litigation back or a separate form is appropriate. The notice of motion, litigation back, 
or separate form must recite the papers that accompany the notice of motion. 

If the only affidavit or affirmation in support of the motion is that of the attorney or party 
pro se, the original signature on that paper is sufficient compliance with the rule and a separate 
signature is not required. 

Motions Prosecuted by Order to Show Cause 

An  order  to  show  cause  is  not  signed  by  the  party  or  attorney  on  whose  behalf  it  is 
submitted for signature.  Accordingly, compliance with the signing requirement is necessary in 
one of the following ways: (1) if the only supporting paper is an affidavit or affirmation of an 
attorney  or  a  party  pro  se,  by  signature  on  that  paper,  (2)  by  signature  on  a  litigation  back 
enclosing  the  motion  papers,  or  (3)  by  signature  on  a  separate  form.    If  the  second  or  third  of 
these methods is used, the litigation back or form must recite the papers covered by the signature.  
If  the  only  paper  submitted  in  support  of  a  motion  prosecuted  by  order  to  show  cause  is  the 
affidavit or affirmation of a party who is represented by counsel, or the affidavit or affirmation of 
a  nonparty,  compliance  with  the  signing  requirement  by  an  attorney  is  required.  The  signature 
may  be  made  either  on  a  litigation  back  or  on  a  separate  form,  each  of  which  must  recite  the 
papers covered by the signature. 

Opposition & Reply Papers 

If the only paper submitted in opposition to the motion or in reply to opposition papers is 
an  affidavit  or  affirmation of  an  attorney  or  a  party  pro  se,  the  signature  on  that  paper  will  be 
sufficient.    If,  however,  the  only  paper  submitted  in  opposition  or  reply  is  the  affidavit  or 
affirmation of a party who is represented by counsel, or the affidavit or affirmation of a nonparty,  
or if more than one affidavit or affirmation is submitted, the signature of an attorney is necessary. 
That signature may be made either on a litigation back or on a separate form, each of which must 
recite the papers covered by the signature.
