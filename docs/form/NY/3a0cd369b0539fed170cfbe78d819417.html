COURT HELP CENTER

NOTE:  PERSONS WITHOUT COUNSEL ARE ADVISED TO CONSULT AN ATTORNEY.

HOW TO MAKE A MOTION

A motion is a request to the court for a specific order that is made within an

existing lawsuit.  A motion may seek the taking of some procedural step within the case

or, under appropriate circumstances, request that the case be brought to a head before

the court on the merits.  The kinds of motions that may be made are defined by the Civil

Practice Law and Rules.  (called the CPLR for short).

To illustrate what a motion is, how it is made and responded to, this summary

will discuss a motion to dismiss.  At the conclusion of this discussion, this summary will

describe certain other common types of motions.  The procedures described in Section A

applies to may other motions as well.

The  person  who  makes  a  motion  may  be  called  the  moving  party  or  the

movant.  A person who opposes a motion is called the opposing or answering party.

A.  The Motion to Dismiss

Generally speaking, a motion to dismiss challenges the legal adequacy of

a complaint or petition.1  A motion to dismiss may also be used when a defendant claims

1  A plaintiff may also use such a motion to strike an

affirmative defense contained in answer.

that the court has no jurisdiction over him/her (in this context "no jurisdiction" means that

the court lacks the power to order the person involved to do something") by virtue of some

impropriety in the service of process or because the action was not commenced on time,

or for other procedural reasons.

As  to  timeliness,  every  case  must  be  brought  within  one  of  the  various

deadlines spelled out in the law, which are known as statutes of limitations.  For example,

an action for breach of contract must be brought within six years of the breach.  CPLR 213. 

Most personal injury actions must be brought within three years of the injury complained

of.  CPLR 214.  For other limitations, see CPLR Article 2.

All papers on motions must be typed, or printed legibly, in English, using

black ink on 8 Â½ by 11 inch paper, one side only, double spaced.

Except  when  proceeding  by  order  to  show  cause  (discussed  below),  the

moving party must prepare a notice of motion, a document which advises all the other

parties to the action that the motion is being brought, what the movant wants the Court to

order (e.g., dismiss the case) what the supporting papers are, what the reasons for the

motion  are  (these  are  usually  called  the  movant's  grounds)  and  when  and  where  the

motion will be heard, when, that is, it will be formally presented to the court for decision

(the return date).  See CPLR 2214(a). 

The moving party must submit with the notice of motion, an affidavit (which

is a written statement made under oath and sworn to in the presence of a Notary Public)

or other  proof that explains the nature of the motion and the reasons therefor and to which

is attached copies of all documents necessary to understand the motion and the movant's

2

grounds that support the motion.  For example, if it is contended that the action was not

timely commenced, the affidavit must state the facts that show this.  If the movant wants

to  also  present  argument  about  a  point  of  law,  he/she  should  submit  a  separate

memorandum of law (or "brief").  Legal argumentation and citations to prior court decisions

and/or statutes (laws) should be contained only in the memoranda of law, not in affidavits

or exhibits (these should be limited to factual statements and documentary evidence).

The CPLR sets forth deadlines for the service of papers on motions.  There

are  three  things  to  keep  in  mind  here.    First,  there  are  the  basic  deadlines  set  forth;

therefore the moving party should choose a return date so that he or she will comply with

those  deadlines.  Second, in most circumstances when papers are mailed rather than

served personally, the rules add five additional days to the deadline(s) for a response to

allow  for  receipt  of  the  papers.    Third,  the  moving  party  may  obtain  additional  time  to

prepare and serve a reply.  That is, if the moving papers are served a set time in advance

and if the notice of motion contains a demand in accord with CPLR 2214(b),2 then the

movant is allowed additional time to review the answering papers and may put in a reply

in response to those papers.  The following is a summary of the deadlines:

Standard Time(s)

Moving papers:  must be served by hand (that is personal service) at least

8 days before return date or by mail 13 days (8 + 5) before the return date.

2The demand should state the following:  "Please take
further notice that you are hereby required to serve copies of
your answering papers on the undersigned no later than the
seventh day prior to the return date set above."

3

Answering papers:  must be served (by mail or by hand) 2 days before return

date.

Reply papers:  not provided for.

Additional Time - Papers in Accord with Demand (2214(b))

Moving papers:  must be served by hand at least 12 days before return date

or  17  days  in  advance  if  sent  by  mail  (12  +  5)  notice  of  motion  must  contain  2214(b)

demand.

before return date.

Answering  papers:  must be served (by hand or by mail) at least 7 days

Reply papers:  must be served (by hand or by mail) at least 1 day before.

No other papers are permitted by the CPLR on a motion.3

Attorneys  and  self-represented  persons  are  free  to,  and  indeed  are

encouraged to, consult with one another and agree in writing on a schedule that suits the

needs  of  all  which  of  course  may  be  different  than  the  times  listed  above.    Our  court

strongly disfavors disputes over the service of motion papers.

A defendant needs to be careful that he or she does not inadvertently waive

any defense depending upon how he or she makes a motion or otherwise responds to the

complaint.  (See CPLR 3211(e)).

3However, the CPLR does provide that when a motion is made,

another party may make a motion of his or her own in response,
known as a cross-motion.  CPLR 2215.

4

A timely motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) extends the defendant's

time to serve the pleading known as the answer until ten days after an order issued by the

court in regard to the motion has been entered and notice of entry has been provided.

All motion papers must be served by mail or by hand upon all parties to the

case who have not defaulted in appearing (that is, all parties except those whose time to

answer has already expired and who are now in default), even if the motion does not seek

relief against some of them.  An affidavit of service must be prepared:  one original should

be retained by the moving party and the other duplicate should be attached to the papers

submitted to the court so that the court can be certain that timely notice was given to all

other parties to the case.

Before a motion can be filed the movant must pay a filing fee of $45.00. If the

case  has  never  come  to  court  before,  the  movant  will  have  to  cause  a  Justice  to  be

assigned to the case.  This is done by the filing of a Request for Judicial Intervention. 

(called an RJI for short).  It costs $95.00 to file an RJI. Both the filing fee for the motion

and the RJI fee(if required) are paid to the County Clerks Office in room 106,   For more

on this subject, see How to File a Request for Judicial Intervention which is available from

the Self-Represented Information Office.

The original moving papers must be delivered to the Motion Support Office

Information Window (Room 140) at least five business days prior to the return date so that

the motion may be recorded in the court's computer system and placed on the calendar. 

In  the  first  instance,  the  place  at  which  the  motion  will  be  returnable  is  the  Assigned

Justice's  Courtroom.    Oral  (spoken)  argument  may  take  place  there  but  usually  oral

5

argument takes place only when, where and if the assigned Justice directs.)  This is so for

all motions brought in our court by notice of motion.  The parties are free upon agreement

to adjourn motions (within limits) so as to accommodate their schedules.  Answering and

reply  papers  are  to  be  served  upon  all  other  parties  to  the  case  within  the  deadlines

applicable.  The original answering and reply papers (to which must be attached proof that

the papers were served on all other parties) must be delivered to the Courtroom at the call

of the calendar at 9:30 AM on the return date.

A word of caution on return dates.  Sometimes the assigned Justice and/or

the Court Clerk's Office will direct or require a change in the return date you selected.

Accordingly, a few days after you submit your notice of motion you must

check with the Clerk's Office to see if this happened.

You can do this by:

1.  Checking the Court's website   www.nycourts.gov ,  selecting E-courts 

and following the instructions.(Using the website is recommended), 

                                                            -or- 

2.  Calling the Motion Support Clerk's Office at 718-298-1009 (Have your

Docket Number ready). 

Once the motion is marked submitted, it is either sent to the Justice assigned

to the case for decision or is scheduled for oral argument in front of that Justice.  This

depends upon the procedures adopted by the Justice in question.

6

Another means by which to make a motion is an order to show cause.  This

device is intended to be used when there is urgency or when the movant seeks a stay

(often called a Temporary Restraining Order or "TRO" for short) of some sort from the

court, that is, a temporary prohibition (e.g., a stay against a bank's freezing the defendant's

bank account). 

If you are seeking a stay of an act and want a Temporary Restraining Order,

you must give your adversary advance notice of this (pursuant to 202.7 of the Uniform

Rules for the Supreme and County Courts).  You must also swear out an affidavit in the

presence of a notary public stating who you notified, how you notified them, when you

notified them and what their response was.  A form affidavit for this purpose is available

from the Office of Public Information and it is recommended that you use it. 

An order to show cause is a request for relief by motion, but, unlike a notice

of motion, it is presented to a judge and signed by him or her before it is served on the

other parties to the case.  It requires the other parties to the case to appear on a certain

date at a certain time (the return date) at a certain place and to state reasons why the

movant should not receive the relief asked for in the order to show cause.

Any party who wants to proceed by order to show cause must prepare a

proposed order to show cause and submit it to the court for his or her case.  the return

date should be left blank since that will be filled in by the Justice who signs it.  Attached

to the order should be the affidavit in support, as described above, and any necessary

attachments to that affidavit (e.g., a copy of the complaint).  If there is a memorandum of

7

law, it should be submitted at this time as well.  these papers must then be presented to

the court.

When the papers are ready, they must be presented to the Ex Parte Office

(Room 140).  That office will review the papers for form.  If emergency relief is requested

the movant must also submit an emergency affidavit which explains both the nature of the

relief sought (e.g., an order preventing any former spouse from taking my child/children

to another country) and why immediate relief is needed (e.g., my former spouse has plane

tickets to leave the country tonight and says I will never see my child/children again).  The

papers will be delivered to the Justice and, if found satisfactory, signed by him or her.  The

Justice will fill in the return date and will specify when  and  how the papers should be

served on all other parties.

the Exparte staff.

If immediate emergency relief is not required the papers are simply left with

After the papers are reviewed they will be either:

a)  Marked to be returned to you for correction
    or

b)  sent to the assigned Justice for signature.

You can check the status of your order to Order to Show Cause by calling

the Clerk's Office at (718) 298-1018 (wait at least 48 hours before calling).

If your papers need corrections you should return to the Clerk's Office, pick

them up, correct them as needed and resubmit them.

If your papers are correct as to form they will be forwarded by the Exparte

office staff to the assigned Justice's Chambers for signature.  If the Justice finds them

8

satisfactory he/she will sign them, then fill in the return date and specify when and how the

papers are to be served.

When the order has been signed, the movant must "conform a copy, " that

is, reproduce on a copy of the papers with each and every marking made thereon by the

Justice.  This copy must then be photocopied and served upon the attorneys for all parties

to the case in the manner and within the deadline set by the Justice.  

After service is made, the movant must see to it that an affidavit of service

is prepared.  The original must be presented to the Court on the return date.  (The case

will be called in the assigned Justice's courtroom).  The moving party must be present at

that time especially if the Court granted him/her/it a stay (TRO) until the hearing date of

the motion and the movant wishes it to continue until the motion is decided.  Movants must

ask for this when the order to show cause is called before the Court at calendar call.  If the

other parties do not submit opposing papers and do not appear on the return date, the

court may take action on the order to show cause provided that it is satisfied from the

affidavit of service that the other parties were properly served with the order to show cause

and supporting papers.

The other parties may submit papers in opposition to the motion (usually in

the form of opposing affidavits and exhibits).   This ordinarily will be done within the time

specified by the Justice when the Order to Show Cause is signed.  Opposition papers must

also be properly served on the original moving party as well as all other parties to the

case:

B.  The Motion for Summary Judgment

9

A motion for summary judgment attempts to bring to a head the merits of the

case or a part thereof on the basis of the pleadings (the complaint and answer in most

cases) together with affidavits and exhibits without the necessity of a trial.  The moving

party to such a motion, who may be the plaintiff or the defendant, asserts, in effect, that

there is or can be any real dispute about any relevant fact that would require a trial, and

that the facts show that moving party is entitled to a judgment in his or her favor as a

matter of law.  This motion may only be made after an answer has been served.  CPLR

3212(a).  If the motion is made before the adversary has had a chance to request or to

obtain  discovery  about  relevant  issues,  the  adversary  may  oppose  the  motion  on  the

ground that it is premature and the court might deny the motion with leave to renew after

discovery or hold the motion in abeyance.  CPLR 3212(f).  (if you are unsure about what

"discovery  means,  the  Self-Represented  Information  Office  has  a  handout  that  helps

explain it.  As for it if you need it).

In support of the motion, the moving party must submit a copy of all pleadings

in the case, an affidavit, and any other available proof (e.g., documentary evidence).  The

affidavit must be made by a person with  knowledge of the facts and must set forth all

relevant facts.  CPLR 3212(b).  The aim of the moving papers on a motion for summary

judgment is to show that there are no material facts in dispute and that the facts require

judgment in favor of the moving party as a matter of law.

The party opposing the motion for summary judgment is not required to show

that he or she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  it is enough if the opponent shows

that one or more questions of material fact require a trial before the movant could win.  In

10

that event, the motion must be denied and the case must proceed to trial.  On a motion for

summary judgment,  the job of the Court is to determine whether there are issues that

require a trial, not to decide those issues.  The party opposing such a motion may not state

part of his or her proof and hold back some other parts for another day.  There may be no

other day.  The opponent is obliged to lay bare his or her proof and if that is not sufficiently

done so as to show that there is at least one real issue of fact in dispute that must be tried,

the motion will be granted.

A motion for summary judgment (like nearly all motions) may be denied or

granted or it may be granted in whole or in part.  CPLR 3212(e).

C.  Other Motions

There are many other types of motions.  Another common one is:

(a)  Motion to Amend or correct a pleading (e.g., complaint or answer):  A

party to a case may make a motion to change  his  or her pleading (motion to amend). 

Court  approval  (or  a  written  agreement  of  all  parties  to  the  case  (which  is  called  a

stipulation) is usually required before such a change may be made.  CPLR 3025(b).  The

movant  must  attach  a  copy  of  the  existing  pleading  and  a  copy  of  the  proposed  new

pleading  and  include  an  affidavit  showing  the  merits  of  (the  good  reasons  for)  the

proposed amendment.
