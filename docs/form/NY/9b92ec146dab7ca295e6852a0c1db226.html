      <pre>☐  Make sure you are eligible (see next page). 

CHECKLIST 

☐  Gather any supporting documents you think will help your application.  
These can include documents such as a Certificate of Relief from 
Disabilities or a Certificate of Good Conduct; verification of employment; 
community service, volunteer or charity work; educational transcripts; letters 
of recommendation or commendation from employers, teachers/professors, 
community leaders, faith leaders, or charitable organizations; certificates of 
successful completion of training programs, drug or alcohol treatment 
programs; etc.  Attach copies (not originals!) to your application. 

☐  Get a “certificate of disposition” for each conviction you want to seal.  Attach 

copies to your application. 

☐  Complete the application. 

☐  Get your application notarized (page 3 of the application).  If you use 

additional pages for your sworn statement of your reasons for sealing, then 
you must also sign, date and have this notarized on the last page of your 
statement.  Make two copies of your full application. 

☐ 

☐ 

☐ 

“Serve” the prosecutor:  Before you file your application with the Court, you 
or another person must mail or deliver a copy of your full application to the 
prosecutor(s).  This is called “serving” them.  If the application is served in 
person, make sure your copy and the copy you will file with the court are 
stamped “received.” 

If you did not get your copy stamped at the prosecutor’s office by appearing 
in person, then you must complete the Affidavit of Service, get it notarized 
and attach it to the application.  The Affidavit of Service must be completed 
by the person who mailed the application to the prosecutor’s office. 

File your original application with attached copies of supporting documents 
with the court.  Make sure that your original is stamped “received” by the 
prosecutor or that you have attached the Affidavit of Service if you 
submitted your application to the prosecutor by mail or did not get it 
stamped “received.” 

☐ 

Keep copies of all the papers you filed for your records.

C.P.L. §160.59 PRO SE APPLICATION 
PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS COMPLETELY BEFORE STARTING THE APPLICATION 

ARE YOU ELIGIBLE? 

DO YOU HAVE MORE THAN TWO (2) CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (MISDEMEANOR OR FELONY)? 
(If you have more than one conviction that was “committed as part of the same criminal transaction,” they count as a single 
conviction under this law.) 
 
 

 
Yes   No 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

DO YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE FELONY CONVICTION? 
(If you have more than one conviction that was “committed as part of the same criminal transaction,” they count as a single 
conviction under this law.) 
 
 

 
Yes   No 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

HAVE LESS THAN TEN YEARS PASSED SINCE YOUR LAST CRIMINAL CONVICTION? 
(Start counting the ten-year period from the date you were sentenced OR, if you were incarcerated after being sentenced, from 
the date you were released from incarceration. Time spent on probation or parole counts toward the ten-year period.) 
 

 
Yes   No 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ARE YOU REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS A SEX OFFENDER? 

 

Yes   No 

ARE YOU APPLYING TO SEAL AN INELIGIBLE OFFENSE? 
(INELIGIBLE offenses include sex offenses, sexual performance by a child, homicide, violent felonies, Class A felonies, felony 
level conspiracy cases to commit an ineligible offense, and attempts to commit ineligible offenses if the offense still constitutes a 
Yes   No 
felony.  There is a complete list of ineligible offenses at the end of these instructions.)  

 

 

DO YOU CURRENTLY HAVE AN OPEN CRIMINAL CASE? 

 

Yes   No 

 

 

 

 

If you answered YES to any of the above questions, you are not eligible to have your record 
sealed.  Your application will be DENIED. 

If you answered NO to all the questions, COMPLETE THE ATTACHED APPLICATION, have it 
notarized, serve a copy on the prosecutor’s office (see link to list of prosecutors’ addresses statewide, 
next page) and file the original with the court. 

Note:  Before deciding this motion, the law requires the court to have a fingerprint-based criminal 
history report (rap sheet), which will include any sealed or suppressed cases, and any criminal history 
information that occurred in jurisdictions outside of New York.  By filing this Notice of Motion, you are 
agreeing to be fingerprinted if required.  When the motion is filed, the court clerk will give you 
instructions if you must be fingerprinted. 

Note:  IF YOU ARE NOT A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES, sealing a conviction under C.P.L. 
§160.59 DOES NOT seal the conviction for immigration purposes.

WHAT DO I NEED TO DO? 

1.  GET A CERTIFICATE OF DISPOSITION FOR EACH CASE YOU ARE APPLYING TO SEAL.  You may 
already have a Certificate of Disposition.  If not, contact the clerk’s office of the court where you will apply 
to seal your case, which is the court where you were convicted and sentenced.  If you are applying to seal 
more than one case, you must get a Certificate of Disposition for each case.  If you cannot get a Certificate 
of Disposition, you must attach a written explanation of why you cannot get one.  A form to request a 
Certificate of Disposition from the court is available online at: 
https://www.nycourts.gov/LegacyPDFs/forms/criminal/pdfs/CoDRequestForm-fillable.pdf 

2.  COMPLETE and NOTARIZE your application.  If you used additional page(s) for your statement, you 
must sign, date and notarize the last page of your statement as well. You do NOT need to notarize 
documents you attach in support of your application, such as letters of reference or training certificates. 

3.  MAKE 2 FULL COPIES (for a total of three, the original plus two copies) of your application, 

including all attached documents.  If you have cases from 2 different counties, make 3 (for a total of 
four, the original plus three copies) full copies. 

4.  SERVE THE PROSECUTOR.  Before you file your application with the Court, you or another person must 
mail or deliver a copy of your full application to the prosecutor(s).  This is called “serving” them.  A list of 
prosecutors’ offices can be found online at: 
http://www.nycourts.gov/FORMS/cpl_160.59_sealing_application/pdfs/List_of_District_Attorneys_Offices.pdf 
NOTE: 

If you are applying to seal convictions from two different counties, you must serve your motion on 
the prosecutor of each county. The prosecutor is usually the District Attorney, but if your case was 
prosecuted by the Attorney General or Special Narcotics Prosecutor, serve them instead. 

• 

If you or another person are serving the motions on the prosecutor in person: 
1.  Bring all copies to the appropriate prosecutor’s office(s). 
2.  Ask the prosecutor’s office to stamp all copies as “received” and leave one copy with the clerk of 
that office.  If you are serving more than one prosecutor, the copy you keep for yourself and the 
copy you file with the court should be stamped as “received” by both prosecutors’ offices. 

• 

If you or another person are serving by mail:  

Mail one copy of your full application to the appropriate prosecutor’s office.  You will need to mail 
a copy to each prosecutor’s office if you are applying to seal cases from different counties.  
Certified mail is recommended, so you have proof of mailing. 

5.  GET PROOF OF SERVICE.  If your application was served in person and time stamped by the 

prosecutor’s office, this is proof of service.  If your application was not time stamped by the prosecutor’s 
office, you must complete the Affidavit of Service (at the back of this application), sign and have it 
notarized.  If a person other than you served the application and it was not time stamped by the 
prosecutor’s office, that person must complete the Affidavit of Service.  If more than one prosecutor’s office 
was served, the person who served the application must complete a separate Affidavit of Service for each 
prosecutor that was served. 

6.  FILE YOUR APPLICATION. 

•  Attach the original Affidavit(s) of Service (if served on the prosecutor by mail or if served in person but 

not stamped “received”) to your original completed application and file it with the court. 

•  You may file your application by mail or in person at the clerk’s office of the appropriate courthouse.

7.  WHERE TO FILE:  DO NOT FILE IN MORE THAN ONE COURT.  If you are applying to seal two cases, 
your motion must be filed in the court where the most serious conviction was entered. If both cases were 
the same level of crime (e.g., two class “A” misdemeanors (AM) or two class “B” misdemeanors (BM)), the 
motion must be filed in the court where the most recent conviction was entered.  You can find courts’ 
addresses online at: http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/index.shtml 

8.  KEEP PROOF OF FILING. 

1.  Save one copy of the application for your records. 
2.  If you file your motion in person, ask the court clerk to time stamp your copy “received.” 
3.  If you file your motion by mail, it is best to send it via certified mail, so you get a receipt showing 

that mailing occurred.  Save this receipt. 

9.  HEARING OR DECISION.  If your case is eligible for sealing but the prosecutor opposes your application, 
the court will contact you to schedule a hearing.  At the hearing, the court will consider any evidence 
offered by you or the prosecutor that would aid the court in deciding whether to seal your conviction(s).  If 
the prosecutor does not oppose your application or you are not eligible for sealing, you will receive a 
decision from the court by mail. 

10. CONFIRM SEALING.  After your record has been sealed by the court, if you want to check on whether 

your case record is properly sealed in the NYS Division of Criminal Justice Service’s database (from which 
official rap sheets are generated), you should: 

1.  Get a copy of your sealing order from the court. 
2.  Send a duplicate copy of the order with the "Request for CPL §160.59 Verification Form" to the 

address on the form.  This form is available online at: 
https://www.nycourts.gov/FORMS/cpl_160.59_sealing_application/pdfs/160.59_Seal_Verification_Form_DCJS.pdf 
3.  You will receive a letter from the NYS Division of Criminal Justice Service confirming that your 
sealing was correctly processed and that the case will not appear on rap sheets provided to 
outside agencies.  The sealed case will still appear on a rap sheet you order for yourself and will 
still be visible to law enforcement.

ITEMIZED FORM INSTRUCTIONS 

The instruction for each number below refers to the field number in the “Notice of Motion in Support of Sealing 
Pursuant to CPL §160.59” and the “Affidavit in Support of Sealing Pursuant to CPL §160.59” forms. 
For additional help, and to find versions of these forms completed online and then printed, go to the Unified 
Court System’s website at: http://www.nycourts.gov/forms/index.shtml 

Notice of Motion in Support of Sealing Pursuant to CPL §160.59 

❶  Enter your full legal name. 

❷  If you used a different name than your legal name on a case you are applying to seal, list that name here. 

❸  Enter your New York State Identification Number (NYSID) if known.  This number may be found on the 

Certificate of Disposition you obtained from the court where your conviction occurred. 

❹  Enter your date of birth. 

❺  Enter the court’s docket number if you were convicted and sentenced in a city, town or village court, or 

enter the indictment/SCI number if you were convicted and sentenced in a supreme or county court.  The 
case number will be on the Certificate of Disposition you get from the court. 
NOTE: If you were convicted of a charge in another case that was part of the same incident, enter the 
information for that case in the same row.  For example, you were arrested for DWI and 
Unauthorized Use of a Vehicle.  Both crimes occurred in the same incident, but you were convicted 
for a misdemeanor DWI in the City Court, and you were also convicted for a felony Unauthorized 
Use of a Vehicle in the County Court.  Because these convictions were part of the same incident, 
they count as one conviction for sealing purposes, and they should be listed together.) 

❻  Enter the name of the court where you were convicted and sentenced.  The name of the court will be on 

the Certificate of Disposition you get from the court. 

Affidavit in Support of Sealing Pursuant to CPL §160.59 

❼  You are telling the court that you have not been convicted in more than two criminal cases, and that no 

more than one of those cases was a conviction for a felony charge. 
NOTE: 

A felony level offense will have a charge weight of AF, BF, CF, DF or EF. 
An attempt to commit a crime is displayed on your Certificate of Disposition as “Attempted” and 
will have the number 110 before the penal law section and subsection.  For example, Attempted 
Robbery 2° will be displayed as PL §110-160.10. 

❽  You are telling the court that you are not trying to seal an ineligible charge.  If you were convicted of any of 
the crimes listed below, the conviction is NOT ELIGIBLE for CPL §160.59 sealing.  Check your Certificate 
of Disposition to verify that your conviction is not for any of the following charges:

❾ Your last criminal conviction and sentence must be more than ten years ago. Any time you spent on 

probation or parole counts toward the ten years. However, if you served time in jail or prison after you were 
sentenced, that time does not count.  For example, your last conviction was 11 years ago, and you served 
2 years in state prison (11 – 2 = 9), that is only 9 years, and you are not eligible for sealing until next year. 

❿ If you previously filed an application for sealing under CPL §160.58 or CPL §160.59 with this court or any 

other court, attach a copy of that application regardless of whether it was granted, denied or is still pending. 

⓫ If you intend to file another application for sealing under CPL §160.58 or CPL §160.59 with this court or any 

other court, list the cases that you will ask to have sealed and check the applicable sealing section. 

⓬ A Certificate of Disposition (item 1) for each conviction you seek to seal is required and must be attached 
to your application.  An Affidavit of Service (item 2) is required if you do not have a “received” stamp from 
the prosecutor’s office.  You may also attach additional documents (items 3-10) that you think will help the 
court decide the motion in your favor. 

1. 

2. 

Certificate of Disposition.  You must attach a Certificate of Disposition for each case you are 
asking the court to seal.  An accurate and legible photocopy is permitted.  You may already 
have a Certificate of Disposition.  If not, contact the court where you were convicted and 
sentenced.  If you are applying to seal more than one case, you must get a Certificate of 
Disposition for each case.  If you cannot get a Certificate of Disposition, you must attach an 
explanation of why a Certificate of Disposition is not available.  The form to request a Certificate of 
Disposition from the court is available at: 
https://www.nycourts.gov/LegacyPDFs/forms/criminal/pdfs/CoDRequestForm-fillable.pdf 

Affidavit of Service (page 4 of the application form).  BEFORE you file your motion with the court, 
you or another person must mail or hand-deliver a copy of your motion and supporting papers to 
the prosecutor in the county where you were convicted and sentenced (this is called “serving” 
them).  If you serve them in person and had your copy stamped “received,” you have proof of 
service.  If you do not obtain a stamp, the Affidavit of Service is required. 
If you are applying to seal two cases, and you were convicted in different counties, you or another 
person must serve the prosecutor of BOTH counties. 
NOTE: If you served more than one prosecutor, you must have the application stamped 
“received” by each prosecutor’s office OR the person who served the application must complete 
and attach a separate Affidavit of Service for each prosecutor that was served.  This is only 
required if you did not serve the prosecutors’ offices in person and get a “received” stamp. 

3-10.  You are not required to submit additional supporting documents, but if you do have additional 

documents showing positive changes or accomplishments in your life since the conviction(s) took 
place, you should attach copies of them.  These can include documents such as a Certificate of 
Relief from Disabilities or a Certificate of Good Conduct; verification of employment; community 
service, volunteer or charity work; educational transcripts; letters of recommendation or 
commendation from employers, teachers/professors, community leaders, faith leaders, or 
charitable organizations; certificates of successful completion of training programs, drug or 
alcohol treatment programs; etc. 

⓭  You must tell the court why you believe your prior conviction(s) should be sealed. 

YOU MUST WRITE SOMETHING.  If you don’t answer this question, your application must be 
automatically denied.  For example, you can tell the court about positive changes you have made in your 
life and things you have accomplished since the conviction took place, such as positive work history, 
participating in training programs, drug or alcohol treatment programs, work or schooling, performing 
community service, participating in faith-based programs, or volunteer work.  If you need more space or 
wish to attach your statement separately, you can write your statement on a separate sheet of paper, but 
any additional page(s) you write must be signed, dated and notarized.
