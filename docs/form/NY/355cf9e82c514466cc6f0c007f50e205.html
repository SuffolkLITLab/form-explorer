INTRODUCTION 

Following the release in March 2004 of the Report of the Grand Jury of the Supreme 

Court,  Queens  County  Concerning  Thefts  from  Guardianships,  the  Guardianship  Task 

Force was convened to examine the practices and  procedures currently employed in the 

Guardianship  Parts  throughout  the  Second  Judicial  Department  and  to  report  and 

recommend  proposals to improve,  uniform and  strengthen these practices. 

The Guardianship Task Force's  Report and  Recommendations was delivered on 

November 30,2004 and made available at the courthouse and on the court's website.  The 

50-day period for public comment expired on  February 9,  2005. 

As a result of the Task Force's recommendations and in consideration of the public 

comments received, this "Best Practices Handbook" has been developed.  It is intended 

to serve as a guide for Administrative Judges,  Guardianship Justices and  Judges,  court 

personnel  and  members  of the  bar who  practice  in  the  dedicated  guardianship  parts 

throughout the Second Judicial Department.  This is an  important first step in  addressing 

the issues which require our ongoing attention.  These issues received substantial attention 

from our Chief Judge in  her State of the Judiciary 2005 and are also being addressed by 

the  First  Deputy  Chief Administrative  Judge  Ann  1.  Pfau,  the  Office  of Guardian  and 

Fiduciary  Services,  and 

the  Commission  on  Fiduciary  Appointments  ("Birnbaum 

Commission").  Our  mutual  goal  is  to  provide  the  most  professional  of  services  to  a 

segment of our community which  needs our assistance during some of the most difficult 

times in their lives. 

I personally extend a debt of gratitude to the co-chairs, Hon. H.  Patrick Leis III  and 

Matthew G.  Kiernan,  Esq., and the members of the Guardianship Task Force.

COMPLIANCE WITH COURT ORDERS 

Active case management can play an important role in assisting the Guardianship Parts 

to  effectively  monitor  the  status  of  proceedings  and  to  assure  compliance  with  all  court 

directives. 

Accordingly,  each  District Administrative  Judge,  upon  consultation  with  the justices or 

judges assigned to their Guardianship Parts, should establish procedures to insure compliance 

with the court's directives, particularly with respect to the court's requirements for the filing of a 

Bond and  Commission. 

Whether the preference chosen by the District Administrative Judge  is to utilize the Court 

Examiner Specialist (and/or other court staff)  to  actively monitor compliance with  the  court's 

orders or establish  a compliance part to conduct compliance conferences (scheduled within a 

reasonable  time  from  the  entry  of  the  Order  and  Judgment  appointing  the  Guardian),  a 

procedure must be established to monitor compliance with the court's directives to assure the 

Incapacitated Person's well-being and to  protect his or her assets. 

Page -1-

CONTINUING LEGAL EDUCATION (CLE) 

Providing adequate education and training for fiduciaries and all Part 36 appointees (i.e., 

Court Examiners, Court Evaluators, etc.) is of primary concern. I n order to insure that the quality 

of the training programs remains high and to achieve a degree of uniformity among the training 

programs offered by the various CLE providers, the Office of Guardian and  Fiduciary Services 

should mandate that,  in  order to qualify for accreditation, each training program include a one 

(1) credit hour (50 minutes) component of a videotaped presentation by a representative of the 

Office of Guardian and  Fiduciary Services. 

Furthermore,  an  instructional handbook for Guardians and  Court Examiners, which will 

include  sample  documents  and/or  forms  (i.e.,  initial  and  final  accountings,  initial  and  final 

reports) is being developed.  It is expected that the handbook will be another useful tool in  the 

training of Guardians and  Court Examiners. 

The practice of Guardianship Justices and Judges meeting as a group to discuss matters 

of  mutual  concern  can  be  a  valuable  resource.  The  Guardianship  Justices  and  Judges 

throughout the Second Judicial Department should establish a regular schedule of roundtable 

discussions.  The Honorable Joel K. Asarch has graciously agreed to coordinate the scheduling 

of these roundtable discussions, to  be convened on  a quarterly basis. 

Many  of  the  decisions  rendered  by  the  Guardianship  Justices  and  Judges  remain 

unpublished.  As a result,  there is  a strong  likelihood that the sound  reasoning  enunciated  by 

the  court in  the  unpublished  decisions will  go  unnoticed  by  other Guardianship Justices and 

Judges.  Therefore,  the  Guardianship Justices and  Judges should  forward  their unpublished 

decisions which they consider noteworthy or of instructional value to the Office of Guardian and 

Fiduciary Services for posting on  its website.

COURT EXAMINERS 

Compensation 

Establishing  uniformity in  the  manner in  which  Court Examiners are compensated  is a 

worthy  goal.  The  chart  issued  by the Appellate  Division  in  1991  and  thereafter utilized  as  a 

guide throughout the  Second Judicial Department must now be  adjusted for inflation.  While 

sensitive to  the  concern  not to  unnecessarily deplete the  assets of the  Incapacitated  Person, 

the  increase  in  compensation  is further warranted  to  insure that quality Court Examiners are 

retained and to attract new Court Examiners which  have been  necessitated by the Part 36 fee 

limitations.  Accordingly,  effective  immediately,  the  revised  chart,  which  is  attached  as  an 

Appendix  to  this  handbook,  should  be  used.  The  revised  chart  has  also  been  amended  to 

provide that the minimum compensation for a Court Examiner be increased to $200.  Where a 

request  for  extraordinary  compensation  is  justified,  Court  Examiners should  be  permitted  to 

submit an  affidavit of services in  support of such  request. 

In  addition,  the  following  guidelines  should  be  used  in  establishing  the  value  of the 

Incapacitated  Person's  "estate,"  a  necessary  function  in  determining  Court  Examiner 

compensation. 

1.  Real  Property 

In  general,  the  value  of real  property owned  by  the  Incapacitated  Person  is  not to  be 

included when  calculating the value  of the  IncapaCitated  Person's "estate."  Where,  however, 

the  Guardian  has  rendered  substantial  services  in  connection  with  the  management  and/or 

disposition of the Incapacitated Person's real property, other than the real property which is the 

Incapacitated  Person's principal  residence,  the value  of the  real  property may be  included  in 

calculating the value of the  Incapacitated Person's estate. 

2.  Trust Assets 

In  calculating the  Incapacitated  Person's "estate," the value of assets in  a pre-existing 

trust  (that  is,  a trust which  was  in  existence  and  funded  prior to  the  commencement  of the 

Page -3-

proceeding  for the  appointment  of a  Guardian)  is  not to  be  included.  However,  where  the 

creation  and/or funding  of the  trust  is  incidental  to  the  proceeding  for the  appointment  of a 

Guardian (Le., the approval of a Supplemental Needs Trust), then the value of the assets to be 

placed in  the trust is  to  be  included in  calculating the  Incapacitated Person's "estate." 

Additional Duties of Court Examiners 

Court Examiners have been given additional duties and  responsibilities  with respect to 

the review of initial and annual reports.  In  view of these new tasks and  responsibilities,  which 

include making recommendations to the court with respect to the Guardian's compensation and 

examining  disbursements  and  expenditures,  Court  Examiners  are  entitled  to  be  additionally 

compensated. The following formula is suggested: where the guardianship is valued at $1 00,000 

and above, the Court Examiner is to be paid the sum of $500 for the review of the initial report 

and where the guardianship is valued at less than  $100,000, the Court Examiner is to be paid 

$250 for the review of the initial report. 

Court Examiners are to be given the additional duty of confirming, upon receipt from the 

Guardian  of a  certified  copy  of the  Commission,  that  the  Commission  mirrors  the  authority 

conferred  on  the Guardian  by the Order and  Judgment.  Thereafter,  the Court Examiner is to 

report such confirmation in writing to the court. 

Annual Court Examiner Designations and  Evaluations 

The new policy with respect to the annual evaluation and designation of Court Examiners 

has already been  implemented.  The  policy provides that all  designations as  Court Examiner 

expire annually on  December 31  and that re-designation for the following year depends on the 

receipt by the  Presiding Justice of a favorable evaluation from the Guardianship Justices and 

Judges in the Judicial District in which the Court Examiner has been designated.  An evaluation 

form on which the Court Examiner's performance is to be graded by the Guardianship Justices 

and Judges (presumably with the assistance of their staff) was developed (see Appendix). This 

policy has already produced tangible results.

COMPENSATION OF  GUARDIANS 

Establishing  uniformity  in  the  manner in  which  Guardians are  compensated will  be  of 

great service to the public. 

A.  Part 36  Guardians 

SCPA 2307 should be applied where the services rendered by the Part 36 Guardian are 

best described as executorial in  nature and  SCPA 2309 should be applied where the services 

rendered by the Part 36  Guardian are best described as services that might be  rendered by a 

trustee. 

duties. 

The duties and functions of an  executor of an  estate differ from those of a trustee of a 

trust.  An executor's main objective is to prevent waste while acting expeditiously to wind up the 

affairs of the estate.  An executor is required to marshal assets, pay reasonable administration 

expenses and make distribution.  An executor typically will make short-term investments that can 

be readily liquidated.  A trustee's duties, on the other hand, generally span a longer time period 

and  involve developing  a  long-term  investment strategy  and  on-going  property management 

In  fixing  a compensation  plan,  it can  be difficult for the court to  predict,  at the inception 

of the Guardianship proceeding, the full extent of the work to be performed or the amount of the 

assets that,  in  the  final  analysis,  will  be  managed.  Furthermore,  the  court cannot know with 

certainty whether the duties of the Guardian will be more like those of a trustee or of an executor 

until the proceeding is concluded.  Thus, even if a plan for compensation is fixed at the outset, 

the court should modify the plan during the course of the Guardianship and/or at its conclusion, 

if appropriate,  based  upon the services actually rendered. 

Where  a Guardianship  involves substantial  assets and  strict adherence to  a statutory 

formula (be it either SCPA 2307 or SCPA 2309) would result in  a windfall to the Guardian, the 

compensation  awarded should be commensurate with the services actually rendered. 

Page -5-

Lastly,  in  those cases where neither the application of SCPA 2307 nor SCPA 2309 can 

provide adequate or reasonable compensation, the court should rely on the submission by the 

Part 36  Guardian  of an  affidavit of services to  support a  request for compensation  based  on 

"quantum meruit." 

B.  Personal Needs Guardians Not Governed  by Part 36  (Family Members) 

When  a  family  member serves  as  a  Personal  Needs  Guardian  (particularly  in  those 

situations where the  Incapacitated Person's disability is extreme), the court should  require the 

submission of an  affidavit of services. 

It is suggested that $90 per hour would not be unreasonable where sufficient assets are 

available to support such a rate.  In addition, it was agreed that there are circumstances where 

the court could consider establishing a reasonable monthly stipend in  lieu of setting an  hourly 

rate. 

Needs Guardians: 

The following  nine factors are relevant in  determining compensation for these Personal 

1.  Type of disability of the  Incapacitated Person; 

2.  Composition of household; 

3.  Income of household - budget; 

4.  Amount of assets in  the Guardianship; 

5.  Whether a parent has given up a job (or forgone a lifestyle); 

6.  Anticipated duration of the Guardianship; 

7.  Necessity to  preserve assets based  on  life expectancy of the  Incapacitated 

Person; 

8.  Nature of services provided;  and 

9.  Cost of comparable services. 

The Guardian should have input with respect to which method the court uses to calculate 

his or her compensation. The court may either orally advise the Guardian, on the record, of the 

Page -6-

different methods of calculating compensation at the initial hearing and direct the Guardian to 

advise  the  court  of his  or  her preference  in  the  ninety  (90)  day  report  or,  in  lieu  thereof,  a 

prepared form may be developed by the court on which the methods of calculation is explained 

and  on  which  the  Guardian's  preference  could  be  selected.  The  court  should  distribute the 

prepared form to the Guardian at the hearing or mail it to the Guardian at a later date.  However, 

the ultimate determination of both the method and amount of compensation rests in the sound 

discretion of the court. 

Unless compensation  has been  set by the court at the  hearing, the court should  direct 

the  Court  Examiner to  recommend  to  the  court,  in  his or her initial  report,  both  the  preferred 

method  of compensation,  based  on  the  services  rendered  and  expected  to  be  rendered  and 

calculate the estimated amount of the Guardian's compensation. 

Page -7-

DUTIES OF COURT EXAMINER SPECIALIST 

The  newly-created  position  of  the  Court  Examiner  Specialist  will  report  to  the 

Administrative  Judges  and  Guardianship  Justices  and  Judges  and  be  responsible  for  the 

oversight  of  Court  Examiners  in  their  Judicial  District.  The  duties  of  the  Court  Examiner 

Specialist will  include,  but not be  limited to,  monitoring the timeliness and  quality of the Court 

Examiner reports. 

The duties of the Court Examiner Specialist may also include monitoring the timely filing 

of the Order and Judgment, Bond and the issuance of the Commission as well as assisting the 

Guardianship Justices and Judges in completing the Annual Court Examiner Evaluation forms. 

The responsibility of the Court Examiner Specialist to monitor the timeliness and quality 

of  the  Court  Examiner's  report  with  respect  to  the  status  and  safety  of  the  Incapacitated 

Person's assets is crucial.  Equally important,  however,  is  that the Court Examiner Specialist 

monitor that  the  Court  Examiner  is  confirming  that the  personal  needs  of the  Incapacitated 

Person are being satisfied.  Therefore,  the Court Examiner Specialist should confirm that the 

Court  Examiner has  determined  that the  Guardian  is  attending  to  the  personal  needs of the 

Incapacitated  Person,  particularly  where  the  Incapacitated  Person  is  not  residing  with  the 

Guardian. 

A significant number of the Guardianship proceedings commenced each year are brought 

by petitioners who are family members and  involve situations where the Incapacitated Person 

has few assets.  The petitioner in these situations is frequently unaware of the procedural duties 

and responsibilities of a Guardian.  Typically, it is not their intent to ignore the court's directives, 

but it is their lack of familiarity with what is required  of a Guardian which  is the cause of their 

noncompliance  with  the  court's  directives.  Accordingly,  when  the  Administrative  Judge,  in 

consultation with the Guardianship Justices and Judges, assigns duties to the Court Examiner 

Specialist,  those duties may include assisting  lay Guardians in  complying with  the procedural 

directives in the Order and Judgment and conducting periodic training of lay Guardians (and of 

attorneys) at bar association seminars. 

Page -8-

The  Court  Examiner  Specialist  may  also  be  given  additional  responsibilities  in  the 

discretion of the Administrative Judge and the Guardianship Justices and Judges. 

Page -9-

COURT EVALUATORS 

The  Court  Evaluator  plays  a  crucial  role  in  a  proceeding  for  the  appointment  of  a 

Guardian.  Below are  suggestions designed to further enhance the responsibility of the Court 

Evaluator  and  which,  when  implemented,  will  serve  to  better  protect  the  interests  of  the 

Incapacitated Person. 

First,  the  Court  Evaluator should  be  provided  with  the  tools  necessary  to  completely 

investigate the nature,  location  and  extent of the  Incapacitated Person's assets,  including the 

use of a subpoena.  Second, in preparing his or her Report, the Court Evaluator should prepare 

a separate medical and  mental  addendum which  will  be  provided  only to  the  court in  the first 

instance and which may be made available to the parties at the hearing, unless the court directs 

otherwise.  This new procedure will  prevent the accidental disclosure of privileged  information 

which  may  tend  to  embarrass  the  Incapacitated  Person  and  will  facilitate  the  court's 

determination of whether to seal the medical and mental addendum.  Third, in order to facilitate 

the dissemination of the Report, the Court Evaluator should submit to the court three copies of 

his or her Report. 

The  issue of the manner of service of the Court Evaluator's Report should  be  resolved 

in  the discretion of the Guardianship Justice or Judge. 

Page -10-

ORDER AND JUDGMENT APPOINTING THE GUARDIAN 

The Order and Judgment appointing the Guardian is a crucial document in a proceeding 

commenced  pursuant to  Article  81.  Establishing  uniformity throughout  the  Second  Judicial 

Department with  respect to the contents of the  Order and  Judgment appointing the Guardian 

will  result in  increased efficiency for both the court and the practicing bar. 

All the provisions set forth within the Order and Judgment are important.  It is particularly 

imperative,  however,  that  the  appointment  of the  Court  Examiner  be  made  at  the  earliest 

opportunity.  In  any event,  such  appointment should  be  made  no  later than  in  the  Order and 

Judgment.  Provisions requiring the Guardian to be bonded as well as  provisions establishing 

a date in the Order and Judgment by which the Commission,  Designation  and  Consent to Act 

are to  be  obtained are also of primary importance. 

A Guardianship Task Force Subcommittee is  hereby established to  develop a uniform 

form for the Order and Judgment.  The Subcommittee shall be composed of the following nine 

(9)  members:

PRO BONO GUARDIANS 

The problem of finding  Guardians who are willing to serve pro bono is becoming more 

acute.  The only real solution may be either to establish an Office of Public Guardianship which 

can operate in a fashion similar to the Office of the Public Administrator or to allow not-for-profit 

groups to playa more active role. 

With  respect  to  establishing  an  Office  of Public  Guardianship,  a  dialogue  has  been 

initiated  with  the  Office  of  Court  Administration  to  explore  the  feasibility,  economic  and 

otherwise, of launching a pilot program in one of the judicial districts within the Second Judicial 

Department.

TERMINATION OF  INACTIVE AND/OR ABANDONED GUARDIANSHIPS 

The court's calendars remain congested with numerous Guardianships which, as a result 

of the  death  of the  Guardian  and/or the  Incapacitated  Person  or the depletion  of assets,  are 

essentially  inactive  or abandoned.  The  continued  presence  of these  matters  on  the  court's 

calendars is  an  unnecessary drain on judicial and  non-judicial resources. 

Accordingly, the Court Examiner Specialist should conduct Abandoned Case Calendars 

on  a regular basis.  In deciding which  matters to  calendar, the Court Examiner Specialist may 

act sua sponte or rely on the recommendations of a Court Examiner.  In either event, the Court 

Examiner is to submit a recommendation as to whether to deem the Guardianship abandoned 

or whether a motion for the  removal  of the Guardian  is  appropriate.  In  either case,  the  Bond 

should  not be cancelled  until a final  accounting has been approved. 

In Judicial Districts where a Compliance Part has been established, the Justice or Judicial 

Hearing Officer assigned to preside therein should work in conjunction with the Court Examiner 

Specialist to calendar and  resolve the inactive and/or abandoned matters.

MODEL GUARDIANSHIP PART 

A pilot program to  establish  a Model Guardianship Part has  recently been  launched in 

Suffolk County.  The Model Guardianship Part is a multi-tiered approach  involving: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

Specialized training for family members appointed as Guardians; 

Introducing mediation alternatives to Article 81; 

Opening  lines  of  communication  to  social  service  agencies  and  the  District 

4. 

Enlisting trained volunteers to monitor the status of the Incapacitated Person after 

5. 

Using the  Court Examiner Specialist to  monitor the timeliness and  quality of the 

Attorney's Office; 

the appointment of the Guardian; 

Court Examiner reports; 

6. 

Integrating the Guardianship Part to accept all litigation involving the Incapacitated 

Person,  including  but  not  limited  to,  matrimonial,  foreclosures,  landlord-tenant 

proceedings and  criminal proceedings. 

This  pilot  program  should  be  closely  monitored  to  determine  whether  it  warrants 

expansion to  Guardianship Parts throughout the  Second Judicial Department.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
