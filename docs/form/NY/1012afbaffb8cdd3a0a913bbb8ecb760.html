INSTRUCTIONS
FOR THE SIMPLE ORDER FOR A STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT

The Court’s Rules and Forms

This form is designed for settlements where there is only one defendant (and its insurer)

participating in the settlement and in the funding of the purchase of the annuity.  If there is a

different number of defendants, or  more than one annuity is being purchased, the form must be

modified accordingly; or the alternate form order (for complex settlements), should be used. 

Before completion and submission of the application to settle a claim or action of an

infant or impaired person, counsel is cautioned to read the court’s rules and to use the court’s

forms; all of which are available on the OCA website.  If counsel has any question, or is unsure

of how to proceed, counsel is invited to call Chambers and arrange for an appointment to discuss

the matter  before an application is filed. 

After a hearing has been conducted you will be required to serve a  copy of the proposed

structured settlement order on all defendants and insurance carriers, with a Notice of Settlement

so that they will have an opportunity to be heard and object before being bound by its terms.

Note: only the proposed order need be served, not the underlying supporting papers.

Preamble (Whereas) Clause

The terms of the  settlement and other relevant information and requirements are outlined

in the “Whereas” clauses. Note: This form complies with the requirements of the Internal

Revenue Code and  explains in its opening ”Whereas” clauses, the significant difference between

the “Total Settlement Payout” and the “Total Settlement Cost.” Decretal Paragraph 1 has been

specifically designed to comply with Internal Revenue Code requirements and should not be

modified, (except however, to conform it to the specific periodic payments proposed in this

application). Note, that when all future periodic payments are guaranteed, the amount set forth in

the Whereas Clauses for “future periodic payments” and for “guaranteed periodic payments” will

obviously be identical. However, if any of the future periodic payments will terminate upon

death, the above amounts will be different. In any event, the whereas clauses can be modified

accordingly.

 All information set forth in the proposed “Order” must be supported  by the underlying

affidavits and affirmations as well as in the required exhibits. The proposed implementing

structured settlement documents must be appended as exhibits to the application.  These exhibits

must identify all the necessary parties thereto as well as the annuity payout being proposed. 

A structured settlement plan will be approved  by the court after a hearing has been

conducted.  In most instances defendants insist that a structure plan be provided by a structure

broker that  is selected by defendant and/or its insurer. The Court requires that plaintiff’s counsel

retain a structure broker before discussing a structured settlement with the defendants, [See, City

Part Rules for Settlement of Claims By Infants and Impaired Persons].  Both brokers can be

compensated by a splitting of the annuity commission so there is no cost to the plaintiff or the

attorney. If there is a dispute regarding commissions, request a hearing and request or subpoena all

necessary persons to be present. 

The application to settle the claim must be supported by an affidavit by  the structure broker

whose structure plan is recommended to the court by plaintiff’s counsel to be best for the

infant/impaired person.    This affidavit must conform to the form affidavit provided by this court

on the OCA website.  After a hearing and review of all submitted plans, and all circumstances

leading up to the proposed plan this court will select and approve one of the plans, as well

determine the appropriate apportionment of commissions. 

Decretal Paragraph No. 1

 Modify the form to comport with the proposed periodic payments which are described in

the underlying documents, but do not otherwise modify the format since this paragraph was

designed to comply with Internal Revenue Code requirements.

The Guarantees

The “guaranteed” payments mentioned in this paragraph (as well as in the preamble 

“Whereas” clauses) refer  to that part of periodic payments that will not terminate upon the death of

the infant/impaired person.  Upon death, these “guaranteed” payments will be made to the estate of

the infant/impaired person, or to the designated beneficiary of said person. The “guarantee”

mentioned in this paragraph is not to be confused with the  guaranty which is provided by a

“guarantor” company which will guarantee the obligation of the assignee company to make all of

the future periodic payments [See, decretal paragraph No. 6]. Nor should the guarantee mentioned

in decretal paragraph 1 be confused with the additional guaranty provided under New York

Insurance Law, Article 77.

  Under N.Y. Ins. Law Article 77,  the Life Insurance Company Guaranty Corporation of

New York provides $500,000 of protection with respect to an annuity in the event an annuity issuer

becomes insolvent if the annuity issuer is licensed in New York and the plaintiff is a New York

resident.  See N.Y.S. Ins. Dept. O.G.C. Opinion 95-65 (9/24/95); See also N.Y.S. Ins. Dept.

O.G.C. Opinion 5-1-96 (May 1, 1996), General Counsel Opinion 2-20-2003 (February 20, 2003). 

In view of this, where the amount structured is more than $500,000, it is prudent, but not required

by law, to purchase annuities from more than one issuer to keep the cost of each annuity below

$500,000. The court is informed, however, that purchasing more than one annuity generally results

in lower payments to the plaintiff.

The Payee  

At the end of decretal paragraph No. 1, insert the name of the “payee.”  Here you should

insert the name the infant plaintiff individually if payments commence on or after infant’s 18th

birthday.  If payments commence before the 18  birthday or if payments are to an impaired person,

th

provisions must be made for payments to the parent or guardian together with a Bank Officer; or to

a guardian appointed pursuant to Article 81 of the Mental Health Law. In cases where an infant or

impaired person is receiving , or may in the future receive, needs based governmental benefits,

such as Medicaid or Supplemental Security income, Counsel should consider making  provision

for, and the order should provide for, the creation of a Supplemental Needs Trust to preserve

eligibility for such benefits, in which event the trust should be named as the payee in this

paragraph. 

Decretal Paragraph No. 2 

Paragraph (A) sets forth  the up-front money to be paid by defendants, to cover the

costs for plaintiff’s counsel fees, disbursements, liens and up front money to the plaintiff, if any.  If

other up-front money  must be added, the form should be modified accordingly. Paragraph (B)

provides for the payment by defendant to fund the purchase of an annuity which will provide the

future periodic payments.  If this defendant is purchasing  more than one annuity, then an

additional subparagraph should be added for each payment toward an annuity.

Decretal Paragraphs No. 3 and No. 4

  The “Assignor’, The “Assignee” and The “Annuity Issuer”

  The defendant (or its insurer), the “assignor”, usually assigns the obligation to make the

periodic payments to an “assignee” company, which is usually a shell affiliate of the annuity issuer.

That “assignee” company will then purchase the annuity contract from the annuity issuer.

 The “annuity issuer” must be licensed to do business in the State of New York, in order for

the annuity to be protected by the Life Insurance Company Guaranty Corporation of New York

discussed above, and it should have an A.M. Best Company rating of no less than A++ or A+,

which are the two highest ratings.  The ratings of the proposed annuity issuer must be described in

the broker’s affidavit and must be supported by an appropriate exhibit attached thereto.

The “Settlement Agreement” and the “Assignment Agreement”
                 

The “Settlement Agreement” and the “Assignment Agreement” will provide among other things, that

the defendant (or its insurer) will assign the obligation to make the future periodic payments to an assignment

company which is usually an affiliate of the annuity insurer.  In decretal  paragraph No.3  that assignment

company (the “assignee”) must be identified, and in decretal paragraph No. 4, the life insurance company (the

“annuity issuer”) and its A.M. Best Company  rating must be set forth.

The Court’s Rules for a structured settlement require a copy of each of the proposed agreements to be

submitted as exhibits to the structured settlement broker’s affidavit, which is submitted in support of the

application to settle the claim or action. There is no standard form of “settlement agreement.” However, there

are several forms of assignment agreements generally used in structured settlements.  The plaintiff should

request that the form known as the Uniform Qualified Assignment, Release and Pledge Agreement be used,

since it grants the plaintiff a security interest in the annuity. Most annuity issuers will use such a form, if

requested.  If the annuity issuer does not offer a security interest, then the “Uniform Qualified Assignment

and Release Agreement” must be used, and the plaintiff will be a general, unsecured creditor of the Assignee. 

 Please note, that decretal paragraph No.8 of the order requires, among other things that, after all of the

documents have been signed, a copy of each must be provided to plaintiff by plaintiff’s counsel; and proof of

service of same must be filed with the Clerk of the Court.

Decretal Paragraph No. 6

The “Guarantor”

Here insert the name of the “guarantor” company. The obligations of the “assignee” company to make

the periodic payments are guaranteed by the annuity issuer or a substantial affiliated  company unless the

assignee is a substantial company.

Notice of Settlement

After a hearing has been conducted  you will be required to serve a  copy of the proposed structured

settlement order on all defendants and insurance carriers, with a Notice of Settlement so that they will have

an opportunity to be heard and object before being bound by its terms. Note: only the proposed order need be

served, not the underlying supporting papers.

The order will be signed on the “settlement”date, if no issue or objection has been raised by the

defendant or the insurance carriers involved in the transaction. 

Compliance With  Remainder of Decretal Paragraphs 

Counsel should carefully read and implement the remainder of the decretal paragraphs after the order

has been signed. The order will be signed on the “settlement date” if no issue or objection has been raised by

the defendants or the insurance carriers involved in the transaction. 

Counsel should take special notice of the obligations imposed by decretal paragraphs No. 8 and 11

which, among other things,  require service of the documents on plaintiff, and the filing of the documents

with the Clerk for the Court, with proof of compliance.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
