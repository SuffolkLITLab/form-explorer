      <pre>INTRODUCTION TO
UNCONTESTED DIVORCE INSTRUCTIONS (Rev. 1/13)

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
BEFORE STARTING YOUR DIVORCE ACTION

Important Note Before you Begin

If you want to stay out of court and you have parenting or economic issues to work out
with your spouse, in appropriate cases where there is no domestic violence or abuse, you
may want to consider divorce mediation or collaborative law.  These processes can improve
communication and reduce the cost, stress, and trauma of divorce.  
Visit www.nycourts.gov/adr for more information. 

This section will outline:

The “basics”: the important things you will need to know before starting your
divorce action. (See pages 1-5)

The schedule of filing fees for an uncontested divorce. (See page 5)

The documents and papers needed to obtain an uncontested divorce. (See page 6)

The instructions for starting the action. (See pages 7-11)

The instructions for filing the action with the court and placing the case on the
court’s calendar. (See pages 10-12)

THE BASICS

There are two requirements that must be met before you can file for a divorce in New

York State:

You must satisfy the residency requirements as set forth in Domestic Relations
Law Section 230. The Domestic Relations Law is the law that governs divorces in
New York State.

AND

You must satisfy one of the grounds for divorce set forth in Domestic Relations
Law Section 170.  Note that New York State law was amended effective October
12, 2010 to add a seventh ground for divorce commonly known as “no-fault
divorce.”  See Grounds For Divorce on the next page.

RESIDENCY

To file for a divorce in New York you must satisfy one of the following residency requirements:

1.  You or your spouse must have been living in New York State for a continuous period of at

least two years immediately before the date you start your divorce action;  OR

2.   You or your spouse must have been living in New York State on the date you start your

divorce action and for a continuous period of at least one year immediately before the date
you start the divorce action, and at least one of the following must also be true: 

a) Your marriage ceremony was performed in New York State; OR

b) You lived in New York State with your spouse as married persons; OR

3.  You or your spouse must have been living in New York State for a continuous period of at
least one year immediately before the date you start your divorce action and  your grounds
for divorce must have happened in New York State. (“Grounds” means a legal reason for
the divorce); OR

4.  You and your spouse must be residents of New York State (no matter how long) on the
date you start your divorce action, and your grounds for divorce must have happened in
New York State.  (“Grounds” means a legal reason for the divorce).

DEFINITION OF PLAINTIFF AND DEFENDANT

Where you are the person seeking the divorce, you are the Plaintiff and your spouse is called the
Defendant.

GROUNDS FOR DIVORCE

In order to file for a divorce in New York State you must have a ground (a legally acceptable
reason) for the granting of a divorce by the New York courts. The seven legally acceptable
reasons, or grounds for divorce, in New York are described in Domestic Relations Law §170.
Listed with the most recently enacted no-fault divorce ground first and then following the order
listed in the Domestic Relations Law, they are: 
DRL §170 (7) irretrievable breakdown in relationship for a period at least six months (commonly
known as “no-fault divorce”); 
DRL §170 (1) cruel and inhuman treatment; 
DRL §170 (2) abandonment; 
DRL §170 (3) imprisonment; 
DRL §170 (4) adultery; 
DRL §170 (5) living separate and apart pursuant to a separation judgment or decree; 
DRL §170 (6) living separate and apart pursuant to a separation agreement.

Page 3

THE NEWEST GROUND: COMMONLY CALLED “NO-FAULT DIVORCE”
IRRETRIEVABLE BREAKDOWN IN RELATIONSHIP DRL §170 (7)

•

•

To get a divorce on this ground, your relationship with the Defendant must have broken
down irretrievably (so that it is impossible to repair or reconcile) for a period of at least six
months. 
This type of divorce is not automatic even though it is commonly called “no-fault       
      divorce.”  The court will not grant you a divorce based on this ground unless and      
      until: 

a) one of the parties has sworn under oath that the relationship has broken down
irretrievably for a period of at least six months;  AND 

b) you and your spouse have either resolved all the economic issues of  distribution of
property, spousal support, child support, and counsel and/or experts fees and
expenses, and the custody and visitation with the minor children of the marriage OR
these issues have been decided by the court and incorporated into the final judgment
of divorce. 

THE OTHER GROUNDS LISTED IN THE DOMESTIC RELATIONS LAW

•

•

•

      •

     •

CRUEL AND INHUMAN TREATMENT DRL §170 (1)

The treatment of the Plaintiff by the Defendant must rise to the level that the
physical or mental well being of the Plaintiff is endangered and making it unsafe or
improper for the Plaintiff to continue living with the Defendant.

You cannot obtain a divorce on this ground simply because you have arguments or
because of an isolated act in an otherwise long and peaceful marriage.  

If all or some of the acts occurred more than five years ago and your spouse
opposes the divorce, your case may be dismissed.

In describing the specific acts of cruelty, you must be clear and to the point. You
must supply the court with details like dates and places. If you do not remember
the exact date, use the words "on or about".

After describing the acts of cruelty you should conclude with the following
language: "The conduct of the Defendant was cruel and inhuman and so
endangered the physical or mental well being of the Plaintiff as to render it unsafe
or improper for the Plaintiff to cohabit with the Defendant."

Page 4

ABANDONMENT DRL §170 (2)

An action for divorce may be maintained where the Defendant abandons the Plaintiff for
a period of one year or longer prior to commencing the action and continuing to the
present.

Abandonment may take the form of your spouse physically departing your marital home
without any intention of returning for a period of one year or longer prior to
commencing the action, and continuing to the present, without any good reason for
doing so and without your consent.

Another form of abandonment is called constructive abandonment, which involves one
spouse's refusal to engage in sexual relations with the other spouse continuously for one
year or longer prior to commencing the action, and continuing to the present, without
consent, good cause or justification and despite your repeated requests.

Another form of abandonment is called a lock out, which involves one spouse's refusal
to allow the other spouse into the home continuously for more than one year prior to
commencing the action and continuing to the present.

IMPRISONMENT DRL §170 (3)

An action for divorce may be maintained by Plaintiff only where the Defendant is
imprisoned for a period of at least three consecutive years. The imprisonment must have
commenced after the date of the marriage.  If your spouse was released more than five
years ago and your spouse opposes the divorce, your case may be dismissed.

ADULTERY DRL §170 (4)

       An action for divorce may be maintained based on adultery, which is an act of sexual or   
      deviate sexual intercourse voluntarily performed by the Defendant with a person other      
     than his or her spouse during the course of the marriage.

The ground of adultery can be difficult and expensive to prove because the testimony of the
Plaintiff is not enough and other evidentiary requirements must be satisfied (the Defendant's
admission is not enough). A corroborating affidavit of a 3rd party witness or other proof
should be attached to the papers you submit to the court. You should keep in mind that acts
of adultery may qualify as acts of cruelty and entitle you to maintain a divorce action on the
grounds of cruel and inhuman treatment. 

Note: if you found out about the adultery more than five years ago and your spouse
opposes the divorce, your case may be dismissed.

CONVERSION OF A JUDGMENT OF SEPARATION DRL §170 (5)

This ground is not used often. It involves a judgment of separation of the Supreme Court. 

To maintain a divorce action the parties are required to live separate and apart. They must
satisfy the terms of the judgment of separation for more than one year after the judgment was
granted.

CONVERSION OF A WRITTEN SEPARATION AGREEMENT DRL §170 (6)

A separation agreement is an agreement between the spouses that sets forth the terms and
conditions by which the parties will live apart. The agreement must be signed by the parties
before a notary and filed with the County Clerk in the county where one of the parties resides.

If you and your spouse have lived apart for more than one year according to the terms and
conditions of a properly executed separation agreement, you may maintain an action for
divorce. It may be advisable to consult an attorney regarding this ground for divorce.

After you have determined that you have met the requirements for residency and grounds for
divorce, you may use the forms in this packet to file for a divorce. The instructions in this packet will help
you in completing these forms, starting your action and satisfying the other requirements for obtaining a
divorce.

The instructions for completing each individual form can be found on pages 13-41 of this Packet 

A COPY OF EACH COMPLETED FORM SHOULD BE RETAINED FOR YOUR RECORDS.

STARTING THE DIVORCE ACTION:

   

1. 

This packet should be filled out either by typing or printing the information. Printing should be
legible and in BLACK ink only.

   

2. 

If you need additional space on any form, you may use an addendum sheet. Be sure to note on the
particular form that an additional sheet is being attached to that form.

   

3. 

Attach to your papers any court orders regarding this marriage and child support/custody/visitation.
All unemancipated children of the marriage are entitled to receive child support.  The court must
decide custody and visitation of all minor children of the marriage. Whenever these instructions
and forms refer to:

(i) “children of the marriage,”  they include all children under the age of twenty one born to or
adopted by the parties before or during the marriage. 

(ii)“unemancipated children,” they include all children of the marriage under the age of twenty
one  born to or adopted by the parties before or during the marriage and entitled to child support.
Upon sufficient proof, a court might consider a child under the age of twenty one “emancipated”
and therefore not entitled to support if the child marries, enters the military, or is at least eighteen
years old and is self-supporting. It is up to the court to decide whether the child is emancipated.    

(iii)“minor children of the marriage,” they include all children under the age of eighteen born to
or adopted by the parties before or during the marriage.

4.

Please refer to the attached glossary, which defines many of the other terms and phrases used in this
packet.

IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND WISH TO KEEP YOUR
ADDRESS CONFIDENTIAL, PLEASE CHECK WITH THE SUPREME COURT CLERK’S
OFFICE FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO OBTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY.  IF
CONFIDENTIALITY IS GRANTED BY THE COURT, YOU SHOULD NOT FILL OUT YOUR
ADDRESS OR OTHER PRIVATE INFORMATION ON ANY OF THESE FORMS.

Page 8

FOLLOW STEPS 1-7 TO START THE DIVORCE ACTION

STEP 1:  Prepare an original and two copies of the Summons With Notice (Form UD-1) or the

Summons and Verified Complaint (Form UD-1a and Form UD-2).

STEP 2:  Purchase an index number at the County Clerk's Office and file the original of the Summons

With Notice or the original of the Summons and Verified Complaint with the County Clerk.
Unless you are granted a poor person's waiver, you will be required to pay $210 for the index
number. Check with the County Clerk regarding acceptable forms of payment. Many County
Clerks also will require that you fill out an Index Number Application Form at the time of filing,
so be sure to bring with you the names, addresses and telephone numbers of all of the attorneys
or, if unrepresented, of the parties themselves.

STEP 3:  Put the index number and the date of the filing on the two copies of the Summons With Notice

(or the Summons and Verified Complaint) if this is not done by a clerk upon filing the papers.

STEP 4:  Where the Defendant agrees to the divorce, he or she will need to sign the Affidavit of

Defendant (Form UD-7). This may be done by submitting the form to the Defendant together
with the Summons With Notice or Summons and Verified Complaint and Notice of Automatic
Orders.. The Plaintiff should send the form to the Defendant with a copy of the instructions on
how to fill it out. The Defendant must send the completed form back to the Plaintiff prior to
having the case placed on the calendar so that the form can be filed with the other forms. If the
Defendant does not return the signed form to Plaintiff, follow STEP 5 below.

STEP 5:

 Have the Defendant served with one copy of the Summons With Notice or Summons and
Verified Complaint, and both the Notice of Automatic Orders and the Notice Concerning
Continuation of Health Care Coverage, by being personally handed the papers.

•

If your spouse lives in New York State:   The server must be a resident of New York State, over
eighteen years of age, and cannot be a party to the action (this means you may not serve your spouse
with the Summons).

Page 9

•

If your spouse is presently residing outside of New York State:   You must still ensure that he or she
is personally served with the summons. If you use a non-New York State resident to serve your spouse
outside of New York State, the server must be a person authorized to make service pursuant to the laws
of that jurisdiction or a duly qualified attorney in that jurisdiction, and you must submit a copy of the
authorization that allows that person to serve the summons. You are encouraged to check with the local
sheriff and, if necessary, with a country's Consulate or Embassy as to any local requirements for service.

Service upon the Defendant of the Summons With Notice or Summons and Verified Complaint and
Notice of Automatic Orders must be made within 120 days of their filing with the County Clerk's
Office. If you do not know where the Defendant is located, you may wish to delay filing the Summons With
Notice or Summons and Verified Complaint until he or she is located, so that the 120-day period does not
begin running while you search for your spouse.   

IMPORTANT: If there are children of the marriage under the age of 21 (see the definition on page 7),
you must also serve a copy of the Child Support Standards Chart on the Defendant. The Chart is
available at:

https://newyorkchildsupport.com/quick_links.html

STEP 6: 

If you had to follow STEP 5 above because the Defendant would not agree to complete and return
the Affidavit of Defendant, the person that served the Defendant must prepare an "Affidavit of
Service" (Form UD-3), which attests to the service of the Summons With Notice or Summons
and Verified Complaint, Notice of Automatic Orders, and any other documents served.  This
affidavit must be submitted along with the full set of divorce papers when you place your case on
the court's calendar. There is a 40-day waiting period from date of service to place the matter on
the court's calendar. If the Defendant does not sign Form UD-7 to waive the 40 day period, you
must wait the full 40 days.

STEP 7:  If the parties were married in a civil ceremony or if the Defendant signs the Affidavit of

Defendant (Form UD-7), SKIP THIS STEP.  If the parties were married in a religious
ceremony, the Defendant must be served with a copy of the Sworn Statement of Removal of
Barriers to Remarriage (Form UD-4).  The Plaintiff must fill out the original and make a copy of
the form. The copy then must be served on the Defendant either by personal service along with the
Summons With Notice or the Summons and Verified Complaint, or by mail. If you serve the form
by mail, it must be done prior to your placing your action on the court's calendar, because you will
need to file the original form with the other required forms. Service by mail must be done by
someone other than the Plaintiff who is over the age of 18 and not a party to the action. When you
file this form, you must attach to the form the Affidavit of Service (Form UD-4a). 

If the Defendant 

to this action:

Page 10

    

* Then your matter is no longer an uncontested matrimonial and you will be unable to           
obtain an uncontested divorce. You may want to consult an attorney at that point.

STEPS FOR PLACING YOUR DIVORCE CASE ON THE COURT CALENDAR

   After you have completed Steps 1-7, you are ready to place your case on the court's calendar. If the

Defendant consents to the action by signing the Affidavit of Defendant (Form UD-7), you may place your
case on the court's calendar immediately. Otherwise, you will have to wait until 40 days after the date of the
service of the summons.

You must complete the following steps to place your case on the calendar:

   STEP 8: You must complete Forms UD-3 through UD-12 (include UD-7 only if signed by the Defendant).
Form UD-3 (Affidavit of Service) and Form UD-4 (Sworn Statement of Removal of Barriers to Remarriage)
need not be completed, or filed, if the Defendant has signed Form UD-7 (Affidavit of Defendant) and
checked Box 6b on the form. Form UD-8 (Child Support Worksheet), Form UD-8a (Support Collection
Unit Information Sheet) and Form UD-8b (Qualified Medical Child Support Order) need not be completed,
or filed, if there are no unemancipated children of the marriage (see the definition on page 7).

   STEP 9: You also must complete the Request for Judicial Intervention (Form UD-13) and, if there are

children under the age of 18 who are subject to the matrimonial action, the Addendum Form 840M.

   STEP 10: You also must complete the Certificate of Dissolution of Marriage, the postcard, and,
   where applicable, the UCS 111 (Divorce and Child Support Summary Form). If a party is requesting

child support payable to a person or entity other than a child support collection unit, the party must
complete, as well, the New York State Case Registry Form.

   STEP 11: You must file the completed forms, including a copy of the Summons With Notice or the

Summons and Verified Complaint, with the County Clerk's Office. Include three (3) copies of the Note of
Issue (Form UD-9).

Page 11

STEP 12:  Unless you are granted a poor person's waiver, you must pay a filing fee for filing the Note of

Issue (Form UD-9) and the Request for Judicial Intervention (Form UD-13). See page 5 for the
schedule of filing fees.

   All of the papers filed with the County Clerk's Office will be submitted to the judge. If the papers are

approved, the judge will sign the Judgment of Divorce (Form UD-11).

   If you are asking for maintenance, custody, visitation, or distribution of property, the court may
require a hearing, even if there is a prior court order or a prior agreement between you and your
spouse. If there is no prior court order or agreement, you and your spouse can try to settle these
issues by signing a written agreement , but any agreement with your spouse is subject to judicial
approval prior to the court issuing a Judgment or an order incorporating the parties' agreement.
Prior to making a decision about approval of the agreement, the court may also require a hearing.
The court will notify you and your spouse to appear, if a hearing is required. 

SUPPLEMENTAL FORMS

  This packet contains additional forms that you may be required to file depending upon the special

requirements in the county where you are bringing the action.

a. Income Withholding Order / Child Support Enforcement Services 

  When MUST the Court Issue an Income Withholding Order 

When the Court issues an order of support, the Court must in every case issue an immediate income

withholding order unless:

 i) child support services are being applied for, or provided through, the child support enforcement program 

(often referred to as the “IV-D” program)  from a  local district Support Collection Unit; or 

ii) the Court finds and sets forth in writing (1) the reasons why there is good cause not to require immediate

income withholding, or (2) an agreement providing for an alternative arrangement has been reached between
the parties.  See Domestic Relations Law § 240(2)(b)(2), Family Court Act § 440(1)(b)(2), and CPLR §
5242(c)(1). 

   Where an income withholding order is required, the Court shall direct that the support be paid by

automatically deducting moneys from the paying spouse’s income through the use of an Income Withholding
Order/Notice of Support.

  The child support enforcement program (often referred to as the “IV-D” program) is a state-supervised,

county-run program. Each local social services district has a Support Collection Unit that assists litigants in
obtaining the child support (or enforcing child and spousal support combined) that has been ordered by the
court.

  To learn about and apply for child support services, use Form LDSS - 4882. You may download a copy
of this form from the Divorce Resources website of the New York State Unified Court System under Child
Support Resources at http://www.nycourts.gov/divorce/ The application form has two sections.  The first
section provides a detailed description of the child support services provided and other important
information you need to know. A child support brochure (Pub.1950) is also available that provides a brief
description of the program which may also be found at the court website. 

Page 12

As an alternative to using Form LDSS 4882, you may also apply for child support services by using the

Plaintiff’s Affidavit (Form UD-6). See instructions at Field 20. 

If you wish to apply for child support services at this time, or you are already receiving such services,

DO NOT fill out this Income Withholding Order/Notice for Support; an Income Withholding Order / Notice
for Support will be prepared and sent by the Support Collection Unit on your behalf

. 
If you do not wish to apply for child support services at this time, you may choose to apply for such

services through your local Support Collection Unit in the future. 

If you do not apply for child support services at this time, and are not already receiving them, the Court may
nonetheless decide after consideration of relevant factors that an Income Withholding Order/Notice for
Support is required by law.

If the Court notifies you that an Income Withholding Order/Notice for Support is required, or you decide to

ask the Court to issue one, follow the procedure for completing and serving the Income Withholding
Order/Notice for Support set forth in the Supplemental Appendix of Forms Instructions at page 34, and
submit the order to the Supreme Court Clerk's Office.

b. Notice of Settlement

In some instances, the court will not sign the Judgment of Divorce until the Defendant is served with a
copy of the unsigned Judgment and any other proposed orders and is permitted an opportunity to object to
or comment on them. In that situation, the court will notify you that the Judgment and the proposed orders
are to be served upon the Defendant with a Notice of Settlement (see Supplemental Appendix of Forms at
page 34). Follow the procedure set forth in the Supplemental Appendix of Forms for completing and serving
a Notice of Settlement.

AFTER THE JUDGMENT HAS BEEN SIGNED BY THE COURT

The Judgment of Divorce (Form UD-11) needs to be filed and entered in the County Clerk’s Office. 
The manner in which this occurs depends upon the procedure of the county in which you brought the action.
Consult the Supreme Court Clerk's Office for information regarding your obligations for the retrieval and/or
entry of the signed judgment and supporting papers. Should you receive notice that the papers have been
filed on your behalf by the court, or if you file the papers, you may go to the County Clerk's Office to obtain
a certified copy of the judgment. You must bring identification with you, because matrimonial files are
confidential and information will be released only to a party or his or her attorney. The certified copy will
cost between $4.00 and $10.00, but the fee will be waived if you obtained a poor person waiver.

A copy of the judgment of divorce must be served on the Defendant. To do this, you must mail to the

Defendant a copy of the signed and entered Judgment of Divorce (Form UD-11), together with the
completed Notice of Entry (Form UD-14).

CHILD SUPPORT WORKSHEET (Form UD-8):

The Plaintiff must submit this document where there are unemancipated children of the marriage (see the

definition on page 7).  It lists the amount of child support that must be paid to the custodial parent by the
non-custodial parent. If you have a Family Court order that directs the payment of a specified amount of
child support, you do not have to fill in this worksheet. A copy of that order must be submitted with your
papers.

This form requires you to list financial information. You may use a tax return, pay stub, W- 2 or any

financial document that will assist you in completing the form. You may also use other information that you
have to assist you. For example, if the Defendant was earning $20,000 per year at the time you separated or
if you know someone with the same job making $20,000, you should list that amount and state the source
of your information in Field 7 or Field 8.

If you do not know the Defendant's income at present, write the number 0 in all relevant sections with the

word "unknown" next to that amount. Fill out the remainder of the form to the best of your ability. When
you reach Field 35, you will be receiving $300 per year, the statutory minimum. You may return to this
Court or the Family Court should you learn Defendant's income at a later date. The Defendant may also
return to court to show that he/she cannot pay this minimum amount.

Although this document looks complicated, a careful, step-by-step approach should help you complete it

properly and without too much trouble. When things become complicated, examples will be given. You
should complete this form before your prepare the summons, so that you can give the Defendant the
required notice as to the amount of child support demanded or offered, as the case may be. It may help to
read through the form before you begin. All statutory references in the form are to Domestic Relations Law
§ 240(1-b).

Insert the Plaintiff's name. Please note that in some cases the Defendant prepares
this form; if so, put the Defendant's name here.
Check the appropriate box to show whether the Plaintiff or the Defendant is
signing this document. This check will correspond to field 6.

Plaintiff has income listed in Items 2-14 that he does not include in Item number
1, then put that yearly dollar amount next to the appropriate numbered category.
Add up all of the items to get the "total mandatory income". Here are two
examples:

    

    

* Example One: The Plaintiff is a truck driver who earns $30,000 per year, which is his
total income. Put $30,000 in the blank next to number 1. Put -0- in the blanks next to
numbers 2-14. The total mandatory income is $30,000.
* Example Two: The Plaintiff is a teacher and earns $30,000 per year but also receives a
$10,000 pension from a prior profession. Put $30,000 in the blank next to number 1; put
$10,000 in the blank next to number 8, and put -0- in all the other blanks. The total

Insert the Plaintiff's non-mandatory income. The form designates various kinds
of non-mandatory income. If there is any income of this nature, you must list it.

List the Defendant's total non-mandatory income.
This is the total of Field 7 and Field 9.
This is the total of Field 8 and Field 10.
List the Plaintiff's total deductions. These deductions are itemized in numbers 19
to 27. The deductions used most often are: number 26 (New York City or
Yonkers income tax) and number 27 (Social Security taxes). Read each item to
see which deductions apply, then total all the Plaintiff's deductions and put that
figure in line D (Total Deductions). Remember, these figures are yearly totals.
List the Defendant's total deductions.
List the Plaintiff's adjusted income - his total gross income from field 11 minus
his total deductions from field 13.

minus her total deductions from field 14.
Insert the combined income of both the Plaintiff and the Defendant. Add field 15
and Field 16.
Insert the combined child support of the Plaintiff and the Defendant.  To find the
correct amount, multiply the combined income in field 17 by the appropriate
percentage listed in field 18. (If the combined income in field 
17 is over $136,000, then disregard the amount exceeding $136,000 for now and
multiply the appropriate percentage by $136,000).

    

    

* For Example: If the Plaintiff's adjusted income is $30,000 (field 15) and the Defendant's
adjusted income is $20,000 (field 16), then their combined income is $50,000 (field 17).
Suppose there is one child. Looking at field 18, you see: For 1 child...17%. You multiply
$50,000 x 17% = $8,500. You now have the combined child support of $8,500; this number
will be put in field 18.

Field 19: 

Field 20: 
Field 21: 

Insert the non-custodial parent's income. To do this, take the adjusted income of
the person who does not have the child and insert this (either field 15 or field 16)
in field 19.
Insert the combined income. Whatever is in field 17 will be repeated in field 20.
This amount is the result of simple division. Divide the non-custodial income
(field 19) by the combined parental income (field 20) to arrive at a percentage -
sometimes called "the prorated share".

* For Example: Suppose the Plaintiff is the non-custodial parent; his adjusted income is
$30,000, and the Defendant's income is $20,000. The combined income is $50,000. You
divide $30,000 [non-custodial parent's income] by $50,000 [Combined income]. $30,000 /
$50,000 = .60 or 60%. Put this percentage in field 21. This percentage is important, because
it will be used later to determine obligations of the non-custodial parent.

    

* For Example: Using the figures in the last two examples, $8,500 x 60% = $5,100.

    

* For Example: If field 21 is 60% and field 25 is $1,000 then field 26 would be $1,000 x
60% = $600.

Multiply the combined child support (field 18) times the non-custodial parent's
percentage [prorated share] (field 21) and insert the result in field 22. This is the
non-custodial parent's share of the total child support.

Insert the amount of child support on the amount over $136,000. Look at Step
11 of the Child Support Worksheet to see what factors might affect the child
support on amounts over $136,000. Some people decide to simply use the same
formula that was used in field 22 and hope the court goes along with that.
Insert the sum of field 22 and field 23.
Insert the cost of child care for certain items. If you pay for any of those items,
put a check in the appropriate box and place the total annual expense in field 25.
Insert the non-custodial parent's share of the child care check in field 25. To do
this, multiply the total child care expense (field 25) by the non-custodial parent's
prorated share (field 21), and put the number in field 26.

Insert the amount for future annual health care expenses not covered by
insurance.
Insert the non-custodial parent's share of the health care as listed in field 27. To
do this, multiply the total future health care expenses in field 27 by the
percentage in field 21.
List the annual amount for educational expense. Use Step 11(b) as a guide to
decide if it is appropriate to put any amount in field 29.
Insert the non-custodial parent's income. This is the same amount as in field 19.
Insert the total amount of support, child care, future health care and educational
expense attributable to the non-custodial parent. This field is the addition of field
24 + field 26 + field 28 + field 29.
Field 32 = field 30 - field 31. This amount is used to determine whether or not
the low income exemptions apply to this case. If the deduction from the
non-custodial parent's income of child support, child care, future health care and
educational expense brings his income below poverty level or below the
self-support reserve, then a different formula, as determined by fields 33-36, is
used to determine the appropriate child support.

Page 24

   To see whether you have to use that different formula in fields 33-36, you first have to determine what are
the poverty level and the self-support reserve. Every April 1st the poverty level as well as the self support
reserve changes. You may obtain the most current figures from the Child Support Standards Chart, which
is available at https://newyorkchildsupport.com/quick_links.html

   Now you can see whether any of the low income exemptions apply. There are three possibilities. First -- If
the figure you get in field 32 is larger than the self-support reserve, then you are finished with this form
except for signing and notarization. Second -- If the figure you get in field 32 is less than the poverty level,
then you must complete field 33 and field 34 before you are finished. Third -- If the figure you get in field
32 falls between the poverty level and the self-support reserve, skip field 33 and field 34 and move on to
field 35 and field 36.

Field 33: 

Field 34: 

Field 35: 

Field 36: 

Field 37: 

Field 38: 

List the adjusted income of the non-custodial parent as set forth in field 30, but
only when field 32 is below the poverty level. Otherwise, skip this field.
Insert the amount of the self-support reserve, as calculated using the
instructions in the footnotes at the bottom of page four of the form.
This amount is the remainder after subtracting the self-support reserve (field
34) from the non-custodial parent's income (field 33). If the amount on field 34
is greater than $300, then the correct child support is field 34. If the amount in
field 34 is $300 or less, then the correct child support is $300 per year unless
the Court decides this amount is “unjust or inappropriate”  based on the non-
numerical factors in Step 11 of the form. Keep in mind that the amount on field
34 may be less than $0, which occurs when the non-custodial parent's income
is less than the self support reserve. Treat any figure below $0 as $0. As noted,
that will result in child support of $300 per year unless the Court decides this
amount is “unjust or inappropriate” based on the non-numerical factors in Step
11 of the form.
List the adjusted income of the non-custodial parent as set forth in field 30, but
only when field 32 was below the self support reserve and above the poverty
level. Otherwise skip this field.
Insert the amount of the self-support reserve, as calculated using the
instructions in the footnotes at the bottom of page four of the form.
Insert the remainder after subtracting the self-support reserve (field 37) from
the non-custodial parent's income (field 36). If the amount in field 36 is greater
than $600, then the correct child support is field 36. If the amount in field 36 is
$600 or less, then the correct child support is $600 per year.  In addition, the
Court has discretion to award child care expenses, health care expenses, and
college, post - secondary private, special or enriched education expenses
pursuant to Step 9 of this form.

It is strongly advised that you attach to this document the latest income tax returns, W-2's, 1099's, pay

stubs -- or whatever documentation you have -- to confirm the amounts you state in this form.

If you or your spouse is to receive child support only or combined child support and maintenance (spousal
support), and if no child support enforcement services are already being provided through a local district
Support Collection Unit (see Instructions on page 11 about whether and how to apply for such services), you
or your spouse may ask the Court to issue an Income Withholding Order/Notice for Support or the Court may
decide to issue such an order on its own.  In either case, the Income Withholding Order/Notice for Support
form is the form approved by the federal Office of Management and Budget and must be used.  No other form
of Income Withholding Order/Notice for Support can be used If you are the person making the payment, you
are the employee/obligor (or debtor).  If you are the person receiving the payment, you are the custodial
party/obligee (or creditor).  Follow the instructions below:

Note: This is the actual Form - Use the Numbered Reference Copy IWO Form Non-IV-D b as a Guide
when filling it out)

If you or your spouse is to receive maintenance (spousal support) only, and if no child support enforcement
services are already being provided through a local district Support Collection Unit (see Instructions on page
11 about whether and how to apply for such services), you or your spouse may ask the Court to issue an
Income Withholding Order/Notice for Support or the Court may decide to issue such an order on its own.  In
either case, the Income Withholding Order/Notice for Support form is the form approved by the federal Office
of Management and Budget. While not required, this form is recommended for use in New York State for
Spousal Support Only IWO’s.  On IWO Form Non-IV-D a (for Spousal Support Only IWOs) areas not
applicable to Spousal Support Only have been grayed out.  In addition to graying out fields not applicable to
the Spousal Support Only IWO, the other difference from the IWO Form Non-IV-D  is that Spousal Support
Only IWOs are payable to the “obligee,”  not the New York State Child Support Processing Center (SDU). If
you are the person making the payment, you are the employee/obligor (or debtor).  If you are the person
receiving the payment, you are the obligee (or creditor).   Follow the instructions below:

Page 36

  If you are certain of the employer’s pay cycle, enter the value of the obligation in the                      
  appropriate field. Only one field need be filled in.
  If you are not certain of the employer’s pay cycle, you must enter a value in each of these               
  fields.  To do this, follow these instructions:

     

     

First calculate the amount of the obligation on a yearly basis (i.e., if the amount of the
obligation is weekly, multiply it by 52; if biweekly, multiply it by 26; if semimonthly multiply
it by 24; or if monthly, multiply it by 12); then take the yearly amount and divide it by the
appropriate pay cycle (i.e., if weekly, by 52; if biweekly, by 26; if semimonthly, by 24; and if
monthly, by 12). Then enter the recalculated amount in the proper field.

 Example 1:  Assume the support obligation is $100.00 biweekly.  You know that the   employer’s
pay cycle is monthly.  Then you should multiply $100.00 by 26 to get the yearly   obligation
($2,600.00).  Then divide that by 12 to get the monthly obligation ($216.67).  You   would then
enter that value in field 13d.  
 Example 2: Maybe you’re not sure of the employer’s pay cycle.  Then you should again  
multiply $100.00 by 26 to get the yearly obligation ($2,600.00).  Then divide $2,600.00 by 52 to
get the value for the weekly value ($50.00); divide $ 2,600.00 by 26 to get the biweekly value  
($100.00.); divide $2,600.00 by 24 to get the semimonthly value ($108.33); and divide $2,600.00  
by 12 to get the monthly value ($216.67).  You should enter these values in fields 13a - 13d.

Field 13a:

 If the employer’s pay cycle does not correspond with Field 12b, enter the total amount the              

employer should withhold if the employee is paid weekly

 If the employer’s pay cycle does not correspond with Field 12b, enter the total amount the               

 If the employer’s pay cycle does not correspond with Field 12b, enter the total amount the               

Field 13b: 
            employer should withhold if the employee is paid twice a month
Field 13c:
            employer should withhold if the employee is paid every two weeks.
Field 13d:
            employer should withhold if the employee is paid once a month.
Field 14:
 Complete if 1c, above, has been selected.
Fields 15- 24:  These Fields have been pre-filled to make it easier for you.  For this reason, Fields 15-24

Now that you have finished completing the Income Withholding Order/Notice for Support, you should submit it to
the Supreme Court Clerk for signature by the Judge. After it is signed by the Judge, you must serve a certified
copy of the Income Withholding Order/Notice for Support on the employer and the Defendant.  
A certified copy of the Child Support and Combined Child and Spousal Support orders (IWO Form Non-IV-
D) must also be served on the New York State Child Support Processing Center, PO Box 15365, Albany, N.Y.
12212-5365. You may use regular mail, but it is suggested that you file an Affidavit of Service of the IWO
order with the Clerk of the Court.  Spousal Support Only IWO orders (IWO Form Non-IV-D a)  should NOT
be served on the New York State Child Support Processing Center.

Important Note: The NYS Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance advises that the Federal Office of
Child Support Enforcement has confirmed that if the IWO is issued by a Court, a copy of the underlying order
need not be attached to the IWO even in instances where the IWO is served by a litigant or his/her
representative acting on the Court’s instructions. See Field 1(f) on the first page of the IWO and Fields 26-29
on the second page of the IWO which identify the Issuer.    If you have continuing questions about this
instruction, you may contact the New York State Child Support Customer Service Helpline at  1-888-208-4485
(TTY: 1-866-875-9975) Monday through Friday 8:00 a.m.  -  7:00 p.m.

(Important Note: Do not complete this form.  Use it as a guide when filling out the actual Forms)

B. NEW YORK STATE CASE REGISTRY FILING FORM:
Information about child support orders must be filed with the State Case Registry by filing a New York State
Registry Filing Form.  If a party to the order is receiving child support services from the support collection unit
(known as a IV-D case), the support collection unit will report the information.  A case is receiving support
collection services if: 1) the County Department of Social Services (or, in New York City, HRA) is a party to the
order because a child is receiving public assistance benefits, Medicaid or is in foster care; or 2) a party has applied
for services including collection and enforcement of the support order.  If you are unsure whether the case is
receiving child support services, contact the court clerk.

You MUST complete and submit the State Case Registry form:
a) if your case involves child support or combined spousal and child support and the Court issues an Income          
 Withholding Order/Notice for Support that requires the employer to remit payments to the NYS Child              
Support Processing Center; or
b) if the court determines that immediate income withholding is not required by statute and payments are made      
directly to the custodial party/obligee. 

Note: If your support order is generated (or prepared) by Family Court, the court will take care of filing the form,
but if your support order is from Supreme Court, you must complete and use the form posted on the Divorce
Resources website at: http://www.nycourts.gov/divorce/forms_instructions/case-reg.pdf 

You should NOT complete and submit the State Case Registry form:
a) if your case involves spousal support only; or
b) if a party to the order is applying for, or receiving, support services from, a local Support Collection Unit            
 pursuant to the child support enforcement program.

POOR PERSON STATUS / WAIVER OF FILING FEES:

     The State of New York recognizes that some individuals may lack the financial resources needed to pay the
filing fees and court costs associated with filing for an uncontested divorce. The law permits an application for
poor person status, thus relieving the person of the obligation to pay those fees, costs and expenses required. You
will not be allowed an exemption from the obligation to pay merely because your circumstances are difficult.
Rather, you must fill out an affidavit that indicates you are unable to pay the fees and costs associated with the
lawsuit and as such will not be able to proceed in the absence of an order granting an exemption.

     To request poor person status, you must fill out the Affidavit in Support of Application to Proceed as a
Poor Person and the Poor Person Order and file these papers with the County Clerk's Office when you file the
summons with notice or summons and verified complaint. Before you file the papers, check with the County
Clerk's Office or Supreme Court clerk’s office for further instructions and to see if any additional papers are
needed to obtain poor person status.    Be sure to make and retain copies of the papers. You may be required to
serve a copy of each set of papers upon the County Attorney (outside of New York City) or Corporation Counsel
(within the City of New York) and your spouse or his/her attorney. You are allowed to serve these papers by mail.

NOTE: If you are incarcerated, you cannot submit the poor person’s waiver forms included in this packet.
You will need to submit an application pursuant to C.P.L.R. 1101(f).

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
