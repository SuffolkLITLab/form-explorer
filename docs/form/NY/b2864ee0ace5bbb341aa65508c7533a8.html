FOR THE  COMPLEX  STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT ORDER

INSTRUCTIONS

The Court’s Rules and Forms

This form is designed for settlements where there is more than one defendant (and its insurer),

participating in the settlement and in the funding of the purchase of the annuity.  If there is a different

number of defendants, or  more than one annuity is being purchased, the form must be modified

accordingly. If only one defendant (and its insurer) is involved in the settlement use the alternate non-

complex form order. 

Before completion and submission of the application to settle a claim or action of an infant or

impaired person, counsel is cautioned to read the court’s rules and to use the court’s forms; all of which

are available on the OCA website. If counsel has any question, or is unsure of how to proceed, counsel is

invited to call Chambers and arrange for an appointment to discuss the matter  before an application is

filed. 

After a hearing has been concluded you will be required to serve a  copy of the proposed

structured settlement order on all defendants and insurance carriers, with a Notice of Settlement so that

they will have an opportunity to be heard and object before being bound by its terms. Note: only the

proposed Order need be served, not the underlying supporting papers.

Preamble (Whereas) Clause

The terms of the  settlement and other relevant information and requirements are outlined in the

“Whereas” clauses. Note: This form complies with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and 

explains in its opening ”Whereas” clauses, the significant difference between the “Total Settlement

Payout” and the “Total Settlement Cost.” Decretal Paragraph 1 has been specifically designed to comply

with Internal Revenue Code requirements and should not be modified, (except however, to conform it to

the specific periodic payments proposed in this application). Note, that when all future periodic payments

are guaranteed, the amount set forth in the Whereas Clauses for “future periodic payments” and for

“guaranteed periodic payments” will obviously be identical. However, if any of the future periodic

payments will terminate upon death, the above amounts will be different. In any event, the whereas

clauses can be modified accordingly.

 All information set forth in the proposed “Order” must be supported  by the underlying affidavits

and affirmations as well as in the required exhibits. The proposed implementing documents must be

appended as exhibits to the application.  These exhibits must identify all the necessary parties thereto as

well as the annuity payout being proposed.  

A structured settlement plan will be approved  by the court after a hearing has been

conducted.  In most instances defendants insist that a structure plan be provided by a structure

broker that  is selected by defendant and/or its insurer. The Court requires that plaintiff’s counsel

retain a structure broker before discussing a structured settlement with the defendants, [See, City

Part Rules for Settlement of Claims By Infants and Impaired Persons at pages 16 to 21].  Both

brokers can be compensated by a splitting of the annuity commission so there is no cost to the

plaintiff or the attorney.   If there is a dispute regarding commissions, request a hearing or

subpoena all necessary persons to be present.

The application to settle the claim must be supported by an affidavit by  the structure broker

whose structure plan is recommended to the court by plaintiff’s counsel to be best for the

infant/impaired person.  This affidavit must conform to the form affidavit provided by this court on

the OCA website. After a hearing and review of all submitted plans, and all circumstances leading

up to the proposed plan, the court will select and approve one of the plans as well as the proposed

apportionment of commissions..

Decretal Paragraph No. 1

 Modify the form to comport with the proposed periodic payments which are described in

the underlying documents, but do not otherwise modify the format since this paragraph was

designed to comply with Internal Revenue Code requirements.

The Guarantees

The “guaranteed” payments mentioned in this paragraph (as well as in the preamble 

“Whereas” clauses) refer  to that part of periodic payments that will not terminate upon the death of

the infant/impaired person.  Upon death, these “guaranteed” payments will be made to the estate of

the infant/impaired person, or to the designated beneficiary of said person. The “guarantee”

mentioned in this paragraph is not to be confused with the  guaranty which is provided by a

“guarantor” company which will guarantee the obligation of the assignee company to make all of

the future periodic payments [See, decretal paragraph No. 8]. Nor should the guarantee mentioned

in decretal paragraph 1 be confused with the additional guaranty provided under New York

Insurance Law, Article 77.

  Under N.Y. Ins. Law Article 77,  the Life Insurance Company Guaranty Corporation of

New York provides $500,000 of protection with respect to an annuity in the event an annuity issuer

becomes insolvent if the annuity issuer is licensed in New York and the plaintiff is a New York

resident.  See N.Y.S. Ins. Dept. O.G.C. Opinion 95-65 (9/24/95); See also N.Y.S. Ins. Dept.

O.G.C. Opinion 5-1-96 (May 1, 1996), General Counsel Opinion 2-20-2003 (February 20, 2003). 

In view of this, where the amount structured is more than $500,000, it is prudent, but not required

by law, to purchase annuities from more than one issuer to keep the cost of each annuity below

$500,000. The court is informed, however, that purchasing more than one annuity generally results

in lower payments to the plaintiff.

The Payee  

At the end of decretal paragraph No. 1, insert the name of the “payee.”  Here you should

insert the name the infant plaintiff individually if payments commence on or after infant’s 18th

birthday.  If payments commence before the 18  birthday or if payments are to an impaired person,

th

provisions must be made for payments to the parent or guardian together with a Bank Officer; or to

a guardian appointed pursuant to Article 81 of the Mental Health Law. In cases where an infant or

impaired person is receiving , or may in the future receive, needs based governmental benefits,

such as Medicaid or Supplemental Security income, Counsel should consider making  provision

for, and the order should provide for, the creation of a Supplemental Needs Trust to preserve

eligibility for such benefits, in which event the trust should be named as the payee in this

paragraph.

Decretal Paragraph No. 2

subparagraphs.

Decretal Paragraphs No. 3 And 4 

Insert the  amount that each defendant is required to pay towards the “Total Settlement

Cost.”  If more than two defendants that are contributing to the settlement, add additional

Paragraph (A) in decretal paragraphs 3 and 4 are the up front sums to be paid by

defendants, (or their insurers) to cover  the plaintiff’s counsel fees, disbursements, liens and up

front money to the plaintiff, if any.  If other up front costs must be added, the form should be

modified accordingly.  Paragraph (B) in decretal paragraph 3 is for the payment by defendant to

fund an annuity which will provide the future periodic payments.  If this defendant is purchasing or

(contributing to the purchase of) more than one annuity, then an additional subparagraph should be

added for each payment toward an annuity. If a second defendant is also contributing to the funding

of the annuity and/or funding a separate new annuity a paragraph 4 (B) should be utilized. 

Decretal Paragraphs No. 5 and No. 6

The “Assignor, The “Assignee” and The “Annuity Issuer”

  The defendant (or its insurer), the “assignor”, usually assigns the obligation to make the

periodic payments to an “assignee” company, which is usually a shell affiliate of the annuity issuer.

That “assignee” company will then purchase the annuity contract from the annuity issuer.

 The “annuity issuer” must be licensed to do business in the State of New York, in order for

the annuity to be protected by the Life Insurance Company Guaranty Corporation of New York

discussed above, and it should have an A.M. Best Company rating of no less than A++ or A+,

which are the two highest ratings.  The ratings of the proposed annuity issuer must be described in

the broker’s affidavit and must be supported by an appropriate exhibit attached thereto..

In decretal paragraph No.5 the assignment company (the “assignee”) must be identified,

and in decretal Paragraph No. 6, the life insurance company (the “annuity issuer”) and its A.M.

Best rating must be set forth.

Note: If a second defendant is also purchasing and/or contributing to the funding of an

annuity, paragraphs 4,5,6,7 and 8 should be modified accordingly.

The Settlement Agreement and The Assignment Agreement”

The “Settlement Agreement” and the “Assignment Agreement” will provide among other

things, that the defendant (or its insurer) will assign the obligation to make the future periodic

payments to an assignment company which is usually an affiliate of the annuity insurer.  In

decretal  paragraph No.5,  that assignment company (the “assignee”) must be identified, and in

decretal paragraph No. 6,  the life insurance company (the “annuity issuer”) and its A.M. Best

Company  rating must be set forth.

The Court’s Rules for a structured settlement require a copy of each of the proposed

agreements to be submitted as exhibits to the structured settlement broker’s affidavit, which is

submitted in support of the application to settle the claim or action. There is no standard form of

“settlement agreement.” However, there are several forms of assignment agreements generally

used in structured settlements.  The plaintiff should request that the form known as the Uniform

Qualified Assignment, Release and Pledge Agreement be used, since it grants the plaintiff a

security interest in the annuity. Most annuity issuers will use such a form, if requested.  If the

annuity issuer does not offer a security interest, then the “Uniform Qualified Assignment and

Release Agreement” must be used, and the plaintiff will be a general, unsecured creditor of the

Assignee.   Please note, that decretal paragraph No.10 of the order requires, among other things

that, after all of the documents have been signed, a copy of each must be provided to plaintiff by

plaintiff’s counsel; and proof of service of same must be filed with the Clerk of the Court.

Decretal Paragraph No. 8

The “Guarantor”

Here insert the name of the “guarantor” company.  The obligations of the “assignee”

company to make the periodic payments are guaranteed by the annuity insurer or  by a substantial

affiliated  company unless the assignee is a substantial company. 

Notice of Settlement

 After a hearing has been conducted  you will be required to serve a  copy of the proposed

structured settlement order on all defendants and insurance carriers, with a Notice of Settlement

so that they will have an opportunity to be heard and object before being bound by its terms.

Note: only the proposed order need be served, not the underlying supporting papers.

The order will be signed on the “settlement”date, if no issue or objection has been raised

by the defendant or the insurance carriers involved in the transaction. 

Compliance With Remainder Of Decretal Paragraphs 

Counsel should carefully read and implement the remainder of the decretal paragraphs

after the order has been signed. The order will be signed on the “settlement date” if no issue or

objection has been raised by the defendant(s) or the insurance carriers involved in the transaction. 

Counsel should take special notice of the obligations imposed by decretal paragraphs No.

10 and 13 which require service of the documents on plaintiff and the filing of documents with

the Clerk for the Court, with proof of compliance.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
