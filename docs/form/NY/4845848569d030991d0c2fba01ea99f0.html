      <pre>INTRODUCTION TO
UNCONTESTED DIVORCE INSTRUCTIONS (Rev. 9/30/18)

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
BEFORE STARTING YOUR DIVORCE ACTION

Important Note Before you Begin

If you want to stay out of court and you have parenting or economic issues to work out
with your spouse, in appropriate cases where there is no domestic violence or abuse, you
may want to consider divorce mediation or collaborative law.  These processes can improve
communication and reduce the cost, stress, and trauma of divorce.  
Visit www.nycourts.gov/adr for more information. 

This section will outline:

The “basics”: the important things you will need to know before starting your
divorce action. (See pages 1-5)

The schedule of filing fees for an uncontested divorce. (See page 5)

The documents and papers needed to obtain an uncontested divorce. (See page 6)

The instructions for starting the action. (See pages 7-11)

The instructions for filing the action with the court and placing the case on the
court’s calendar. (See pages 10-12)

THE BASICS

There are two requirements that must be met before you can file for a divorce in New

York State:

You must satisfy the residency requirements as set forth in Domestic Relations
Law Section 230. The Domestic Relations Law is the law that governs divorces in
New York State.

AND

You must satisfy one of the grounds for divorce set forth in Domestic Relations
Law Section 170.  Note that New York State law was amended effective October
12, 2010 to add a seventh ground for divorce commonly known as “no-fault
divorce.”  See Grounds For Divorce on the next page.

RESIDENCY

To file for a divorce in New York you must satisfy one of the following residency requirements:

1.  You or your spouse must have been living in New York State for a continuous period of at

least two years immediately before the date you start your divorce action;  OR

2.   You or your spouse must have been living in New York State on the date you start your
divorce action and for a continuous period of at least one year immediately before the
date you start the divorce action, and at least one of the following must also be true: 

a) Your marriage ceremony was performed in New York State; OR

b) You lived in New York State with your spouse as married persons; OR

3.  You or your spouse must have been living in New York State for a continuous period of at
least one year immediately before the date you start your divorce action and  your grounds
for divorce must have happened in New York State. (“Grounds” means a legal reason for
the divorce); OR

4.  You and your spouse must be residents of New York State (no matter how long) on the
date you start your divorce action, and your grounds for divorce must have happened in
New York State.  (“Grounds” means a legal reason for the divorce).

DEFINITION OF PLAINTIFF AND DEFENDANT

Where you are the person seeking the divorce, you are the Plaintiff and your spouse is called the
Defendant. 

GROUNDS FOR DIVORCE

In order to file for a divorce in New York State you must have a ground (a legally acceptable
reason) for the granting of a divorce by the New York courts. The seven legally acceptable
reasons, or grounds for divorce, in New York are described in Domestic Relations Law §170.
Listed with the most recently enacted no-fault divorce ground first and then following the order
listed in the Domestic Relations Law, they are: 
DRL §170 (7) irretrievable breakdown in relationship for a period at least six months (commonly
known as “no-fault divorce”); 
DRL §170 (1) cruel and inhuman treatment; 
DRL §170 (2) abandonment; 
DRL §170 (3) imprisonment; 
DRL §170 (4) adultery; 
DRL §170 (5) living separate and apart pursuant to a separation judgment or decree; 
DRL §170 (6) living separate and apart pursuant to a separation agreement

Page 3 of 45 Rev.9/30/18

THE NEWEST GROUND: COMMONLY CALLED “NO-FAULT DIVORCE”
IRRETRIEVABLE BREAKDOWN IN RELATIONSHIP DRL §170 (7)

•

•

To get a divorce on this ground, your relationship with the Defendant must have broken
down irretrievably (so that it is impossible to repair or reconcile) for a period of at least
six months. 
This type of divorce is not automatic even though it is commonly called “no-fault       
      divorce.”  The court will not grant you a divorce based on this ground unless and      
      until: 

a) one of the parties has sworn under oath that the relationship has broken down
irretrievably for a period of at least six months;  AND 

b) you and your spouse have either resolved all the economic issues of  distribution of
property, maintenance, child support, and counsel and/or experts fees and expenses,
and the custody and visitation with the minor children of the marriage OR these
issues have been decided by the court and incorporated into the final judgment of
divorce. 

THE OTHER GROUNDS LISTED IN THE DOMESTIC RELATIONS LAW

•

•

•

      •

     •

CRUEL AND INHUMAN TREATMENT DRL §170 (1)

The treatment of the Plaintiff by the Defendant must rise to the level that the
physical or mental well being of the Plaintiff is endangered and making it unsafe
or improper for the Plaintiff to continue living with the Defendant.

You cannot obtain a divorce on this ground simply because you have arguments
or because of an isolated act in an otherwise long and peaceful marriage.  

If all or some of the acts occurred more than five years ago and your spouse
opposes the divorce, your case may be dismissed.

In describing the specific acts of cruelty, you must be clear and to the point. You
must supply the court with details like dates and places. If you do not remember
the exact date, use the words "on or about".

After describing the acts of cruelty you should conclude with the following
language: "The conduct of the Defendant was cruel and inhuman and so
endangered the physical or mental well being of the Plaintiff as to render it unsafe
or improper for the Plaintiff to cohabit with the Defendant.

Page 4 of 45 Rev.9/30/18

ABANDONMENT DRL §170 (2)

An action for divorce may be maintained where the Defendant abandons the Plaintiff
for a period of one year or longer prior to commencing the action and continuing to the
present.

Abandonment may take the form of your spouse physically departing your marital home
without any intention of returning for a period of one year or longer prior to
commencing the action, and continuing to the present, without any good reason for
doing so and without your consent.

Another form of abandonment is called constructive abandonment, which involves one
spouse's refusal to engage in sexual relations with the other spouse continuously for one
year or longer prior to commencing the action, and continuing to the present, without
consent, good cause or justification and despite your repeated requests.

Another form of abandonment is called a lock out, which involves one spouse's refusal
to allow the other spouse into the home continuously for more than one year prior to
commencing the action and continuing to the present.

IMPRISONMENT DRL §170 (3)

An action for divorce may be maintained by Plaintiff only where the Defendant is
imprisoned for a period of at least three consecutive years. The imprisonment must have
commenced after the date of the marriage.  If your spouse was released more than five
years ago and your spouse opposes the divorce, your case may be dismissed.

ADULTERY DRL §170 (4)

       An action for divorce may be maintained based on adultery, which is an act of sexual or  
       deviate sexual intercourse voluntarily performed by the Defendant with a person other    
       than his or her spouse during the course of the marriage.

The ground of adultery can be difficult and expensive to prove because the testimony of
the Plaintiff is not enough and other evidentiary requirements must be satisfied (the
Defendant's admission is not enough). A corroborating affidavit of a 3rd party witness or
other proof should be attached to the papers you submit to the court. You should keep in
mind that acts of adultery may qualify as acts of cruelty and entitle you to maintain a
divorce action on the grounds of cruel and inhuman treatment. 

Note: if you found out about the adultery more than five years ago and your spouse
opposes the divorce, your case may be dismissed.

Page 5 of 45 Rev.9/30/18

CONVERSION OF A JUDGMENT OF SEPARATION DRL §170 (5)

This ground is not used often. It involves a judgment of separation of the Supreme Court. 

To maintain a divorce action the parties are required to live separate and apart. They must
satisfy the terms of the judgment of separation for more than one year after the judgment was
granted.

CONVERSION OF A WRITTEN SEPARATION AGREEMENT DRL §170 (6)

A separation agreement is an agreement between the spouses that sets forth the terms and
conditions by which the parties will live apart. The agreement must be signed by the parties
before a notary and filed with the County Clerk in the county where one of the parties resides.

If you and your spouse have lived apart for more than one year according to the terms and
conditions of a properly executed separation agreement, you may maintain an action for
divorce. It may be advisable to consult an attorney regarding this ground for divorce.

After you have determined that you have met the requirements for residency and grounds for

divorce, you may use the forms in this packet to file for a divorce. The instructions in this packet will help
you in completing these forms, starting your action and satisfying the other requirements for obtaining a
divorce.

The instructions for completing each individual form begin at page 14 and go

 through the end of this Packet 

A COPY OF EACH COMPLETED FORM SHOULD BE RETAINED FOR YOUR RECORDS.

STARTING THE DIVORCE ACTION:

   

1. 

This packet should be filled out either by typing or printing the information. Printing should be
legible and in BLACK ink only.

   

2. 

If you need additional space on any form, you may use an addendum sheet. Be sure to note on the
particular form that an additional sheet is being attached to that form.

   

3. 

Attach to your papers any court orders regarding this marriage and child support/custody/visitation.
All unemancipated children of the marriage are entitled to receive child support.  The court must
decide custody and visitation of all minor children of the marriage. Whenever these instructions
and forms refer to:

(i) “children of the marriage,”  they include all children under the age of twenty one born to or
adopted by the parties before or during the marriage. 

(ii)“unemancipated children,” they include all children of the marriage under the age of twenty
one  born to or adopted by the parties before or during the marriage and entitled to child support.
Upon sufficient proof, a court might consider a child under the age of twenty one “emancipated”
and therefore not entitled to support if the child marries, enters the military, or is at least eighteen
years old and is self-supporting. It is up to the court to decide whether the child is emancipated.    

(iii)“minor children of the marriage,” they include all children under the age of eighteen born to
or adopted by the parties before or during the marriage.

4.

Please refer to the attached glossary, which defines many of the other terms and phrases used in
this packet. 

IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND WISH TO KEEP YOUR
ADDRESS CONFIDENTIAL, PLEASE CHECK WITH THE SUPREME COURT CLERK’S
OFFICE FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO OBTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY.  IF
CONFIDENTIALITY IS GRANTED BY THE COURT, YOU SHOULD NOT FILL OUT YOUR
ADDRESS OR OTHER PRIVATE INFORMATION ON ANY OF THESE FORMS.

Page 8 of 45 Rev.9/30/18

FOLLOW STEPS 1-7 TO START THE DIVORCE ACTION

STEP 1:  Prepare an original and two copies of the Summons With Notice (Form UD-1) or the

Summons and Verified Complaint (Form UD-1a and Form UD-2).

STEP 2:  Purchase an index number at the County Clerk's Office and file the original of the Summons

With Notice or the original of the Summons and Verified Complaint with the County Clerk.
Unless you are granted a poor person's waiver, you will be required to pay $210 for the index
number. Check with the County Clerk regarding acceptable forms of payment. Many County
Clerks also will require that you fill out an Index Number Application Form at the time of filing,
so be sure to bring with you the names, addresses and telephone numbers of all of the attorneys
or, if unrepresented, of the parties themselves.

STEP 3:  Put the index number and the date of the filing on the two copies of the Summons With

Notice (or the Summons and Verified Complaint) if this is not done by a clerk upon filing the
papers.

STEP 4:  Where the Defendant agrees to the divorce, he or she will need to sign the Affidavit of

Defendant (Form UD-7). This may be done by submitting the form to the Defendant together
with the Summons With Notice or Summons and Verified Complaint and Notice of Automatic
Orders and Notice of Guideline Maintenance, if the divorce was commenced on or after
1/25/16.  The Plaintiff should send the form to the Defendant with a copy of the instructions on
how to fill it out. The Defendant must send the completed form back to the Plaintiff prior to
having the case placed on the calendar so that the form can be filed with the other forms. If the
Defendant does not return the signed form to Plaintiff, follow STEP 5 below.

STEP 5:

 Have the Defendant served with one copy of the Summons With Notice or Summons and
Verified Complaint, and the Notice of Automatic Orders, the Notice of Guideline Maintenance,,
if the divorce was commenced on or after 1/25/16, and the Notice Concerning Continuation of
Health Care Coverage, by being personally handed the papers.  NOTE: The Maintenance
Guidelines apply only to divorces commenced on or after 1/25/16, and therefore you should not
serve the Notice of Guideline Maintenance with the Summons if your divorce was commenced
before 1/25/16.  “Maintenance” means support paid by one party to the marriage
(“spouse”) for the support of the other party pursuant to a final Judgment of Divorce.

•

If your spouse lives in New York State:   The server must be a resident of New York State, over
eighteen years of age, and cannot be a party to the action (this means you may not serve your spouse
with the Summons).

Page 9 of 45 Rev.9/30/18

•

If your spouse is presently residing outside of New York State:   You must still ensure that he or she  
is personally served with the summons. If you use a non-New York State resident to serve your spouse
outside of New York State, the server must be a person authorized to make service pursuant to the laws  
of that jurisdiction or a duly qualified attorney in that jurisdiction, and you must submit a copy of the
authorization that allows that person to serve the summons. You are encouraged to check with the local
sheriff and, if necessary, with a country's Consulate or Embassy as to any local requirements for service.

Service upon the Defendant of the Summons With Notice or Summons and Verified Complaint and  
Notice of Automatic Orders must be made within 120 days of their filing with the County Clerk's     
Office. If you do not know where the Defendant is located, you may wish to delay filing the Summons With
Notice or Summons and Verified Complaint until he or she is located, so that the 120-day period does not     
begin running while you search for your spouse.   

IMPORTANT: The  Notice of Guideline Maintenance must also be  served with the Summons With
Notice or Summons and Verified Complaint BUT ONLY if Your Action Was Commenced on or after
January 25, 2016.  

IMPORTANT: If there are children of the marriage under the age of 21 (see the definition on page 7), 
you must also serve a copy of the Child Support Standards Chart on the Defendant. The Chart is
available at:

https://newyorkchildsupport.com/quick_links.html

STEP 6: 

If you had to follow STEP 5 above because the Defendant would not agree to complete and return
the Affidavit of Defendant, the person that served the Defendant must prepare an "Affidavit of
Service" (Form UD-3), which attests to the service of the Summons With Notice or Summons     
and Verified Complaint, Notice of Automatic Orders, Notice of Guideline Maintenance if the
divorce was commenced on or after 1/25/16, and any other documents served.  This affidavit must be
submitted along with the full set of divorce papers when you place your case on  the court's calendar.
There is a 40-day waiting period from date of service to place the matter on    the court's calendar. If
the Defendant does not sign Form UD-7 to waive the 40 day period, you   must wait the full 40 days.

STEP 7:  If the parties were married in a civil ceremony or if the Defendant signs the Affidavit of

Defendant (Form UD-7), SKIP THIS STEP.  If the parties were married in a religious    
ceremony, the Defendant must be served with a copy of the Sworn Statement of Removal of
Barriers to Remarriage (Form UD-4).  The Plaintiff must fill out the original and make a copy of
the form. The copy then must be served on the Defendant either by personal service along with the
Summons With Notice or the Summons and Verified Complaint, or by mail. If you serve the form 
by mail, it must be done prior to your placing your action on the court's calendar, because you will
need to file the original form with the other required forms. Service by mail must be done by
someone other than the Plaintiff who is over the age of 18 and not a party to the action. When you
file this form, you must attach to the form the Affidavit of Service (Form UD-4a). 

Page 10 of 45 Rev.9/30/18

If the Defendant 

to this action:

    

* Then your matter is no longer an uncontested matrimonial and you will be unable to           
obtain an uncontested divorce. You may want to consult an attorney at that point.

STEPS FOR PLACING YOUR DIVORCE CASE ON THE COURT CALENDAR

   After you have completed Steps 1-7, you are ready to place your case on the court's calendar. If the Defendant
consents to the action by signing the Affidavit of Defendant (Form UD-7), you may place your case on the
court's calendar immediately. Otherwise, you will have to wait until 40 days after the date of the service of the
summons.

You must complete the following steps to place your case on the calendar:

   STEP 8: You must complete Forms UD-3 through UD-12 (include UD-7 only if signed by the Defendant).
Form UD-3 (Affidavit of Service) and Form UD-4 (Sworn Statement of Removal of Barriers to Remarriage)
need not be completed, or filed, if the Defendant has signed Form UD-7 (Affidavit of Defendant) and checked
Box 6b on the form, Form UD-8(3) Child Support Worksheet,  Form UD-8a (Support Collection Unit
Information Sheet) and Form UD-8b (Qualified Medical Child Support Order) need not be completed, or
filed, if there are no unemancipated children of the marriage (see the definition on page 7). Form UD-8(2)
(Maintenance Guidelines Worksheet) need not be completed or filed  if neither party seeks maintenance as
payee under the Maintenance Guidelines Law. Form UD-8(1) (Annual Income Worksheet) is not required if
neither party seeks maintenance or child support. 

   STEP 9: You also must complete the Request for Judicial Intervention (Form UD-13) and, if there are

children under the age of 18 who are subject to the matrimonial action, the Addendum Form 840M.

   STEP 10: You also must complete the Certificate of Dissolution of Marriage, the postcard, and,
   where applicable, the UCS 111 (Divorce and Child Support Summary Form). If a party is requesting child
support payable to a person or entity other than a child support collection unit, the party must complete, as
well, the New York State Case Registry Form.

   STEP 11: You must file the completed forms, including a copy of the Summons With Notice or the Summons
and Verified Complaint, with the County Clerk's Office. Include three (3) copies of the Note of Issue (Form
UD-9).

   STEP 12: Unless you are granted a poor person's waiver, you must pay a filing fee for filing the Note of  Issue
(Form UD-9) and the Request for Judicial Intervention (Form UD-13). See page 5 for the schedule of filing
fees.

   All of the papers filed with the County Clerk's Office will be submitted to the judge. If the papers are

approved, the judge will sign the Judgment of Divorce (Form UD-11).

Page 11 of 45 Rev.9/30/18

   If you are asking for maintenance, custody, visitation, or distribution of property, the court may
require a hearing, even if there is a prior court order or a prior agreement between you and your
spouse. If there is no prior court order or agreement, you and your spouse can try to settle these     
issues by signing a written agreement , but any agreement with your spouse is subject to judicial
approval prior to the court issuing a Judgment or an order incorporating the parties' agreement.   
Prior to making a decision about approval of the agreement, the court may also require a hearing.    
The court will notify you and your spouse to appear, if a hearing is required. 

   This packet contains additional forms that you may be required to file depending upon the special       

requirements in the county where you are bringing the action.

SUPPLEMENTAL FORMS

a. Income Withholding Order / Child Support Services 

  When MUST the Court Issue an Income Withholding Order 

When the Court issues an order of support, the Court must in every case issue an immediate income 

withholding order unless:

 i) child support services are being applied for, or provided through, the child support enforcement program 

(often referred to as the “IV-D” program)  from a  local district Support Collection Unit; or 

ii) the Court finds and sets forth in writing (1) the reasons why there is good cause not to require immediate

income withholding, or (2) an agreement providing for an alternative arrangement has been reached between 
the parties.  See Domestic Relations Law § 240(2)(b)(2), Family Court Act § 440(1)(b)(2), and CPLR § 5242©

   Where an income withholding order is required, the Court shall direct that the support be paid by    

automatically deducting moneys from the paying spouse’s income through the use of an Income Withholding
Order.

  The child support program (often referred to as the “IV-D” program) is a state-supervised, county-run program.

Each local social services district has a Support Collection Unit that assists litigants in obtaining the child
support (or enforcing child and spousal support combined) that has been ordered by the court.

  To learn about and apply for child support services, use Form LDSS - 4882. You may download a copy    
of this form from the Divorce Resources website of the New York State Unified Court System under Child
Support Resources at http://www.nycourts.gov/divorce/.  The application form has two sections.  The first 
section provides a detailed description of the child support services provided and other important       
information you need to know. A child support brochure (Pub.1950) is also available that provides a brief
description of the program which may also be found at the court website. 

As an alternative to using Form LDSS 4882, you may also apply for child support services by using the

Plaintiff’s Affidavit (Form UD-6). See instructions at Field 20. 

Page 12 of 45 Rev.9/30/18

If you wish to apply for child support services at this time, or you are already receiving such services, 

DO NOT fill out this Income Withholding Order; an Income Withholding Order  will be prepared and sent by
the Support Collection Unit on your behalf

. 
If you do not wish to apply for child support services at this time, you may choose to apply for such 

services through your local Support Collection Unit in the future. 

If you do not apply for child support services at this time, and are not already receiving them, the Court may
nonetheless decide after consideration of relevant factors that an Income Withholding Order is required by
law.

If the Court notifies you that an Income Withholding Order is required, or you decide to ask the Court to issue

one, follow the procedure for completing and serving the Income Withholding Order set forth in the
Supplemental Appendix of Forms Instructions, and submit the order to the Supreme Court Clerk's Office.

b. Notice of Settlement

In some instances, the court will not sign the Judgment of Divorce until the Defendant is served with a
copy of the unsigned Judgment and any other proposed orders and is permitted an opportunity to object to    
or comment on them. In that situation, the court will notify you that the Judgment and the proposed orders  
are to be served upon the Defendant with a Notice of Settlement (see Supplemental Appendix of Forms at
page 34). Follow the procedure set forth in the Supplemental Appendix of Forms for completing and serving 
a Notice of Settlement.

AFTER THE JUDGMENT HAS BEEN SIGNED BY THE COURT

The Judgment of Divorce (Form UD-11) needs to be filed and entered in the County Clerk’s Office.   The

manner in which this occurs depends upon the procedure of the county in which you brought the action.
Consult the Supreme Court Clerk's Office for information regarding your obligations for the retrieval and/or
entry of the signed judgment and supporting papers. Should you receive notice that the papers have been  filed
on your behalf by the court, or if you file the papers, you may go to the County Clerk's Office to obtain a
certified copy of the judgment. You must bring identification with you, because matrimonial files are
confidential and information will be released only to a party or his or her attorney. The certified copy will cost
between $4.00 and $10.00, but the fee will be waived if you obtained a poor person waiver.  A copy of the
judgment of divorce must be served on the Defendant. To do this, you must have served on  the Defendant a
copy of the signed and entered Judgment of Divorce (Form UD-11), together with the completed Notice of
Entry (Form UD-14).  Service by mail is sufficient. You should ask the person who serves the Judgment of
Divorce with Notice of Entry  to sign the Affidavit of Service of Judgment of Divorce (Form UD-15) before
a Notary Public. A copy of the Judgment of Divorce and Notice of Entry must be attached to the signed and
notarized Affidavit of Service. Keep the Affidavit with your important papers.

Page 13 of 45 Rev.9/30/18

TRANSFER OF MARITAL HOME, CO-OP OR CONDO

Real property, including a house or a condominium apartment, or a cooperative apartment, is not

legally transferred just because a stipulation of settlement has been signed or the court has

determined that title shall be transferred. In order to transfer such property certain forms, such as a

deed and transfer tax forms and other required forms, must be obtained and must be filled out with

the required information.  If a cooperative apartment is being transferred, the stock certificate and

proprietary lease must be assigned to the transferee and approval of the Cooperative Board may be

required. The transferor must then sign the deed or assignment and other required forms in front of a

Notary Public.  The transfer will be complete when the signed, notarized deed or assignment, and

other required forms are filed in the County where the property is located, either in the office of the

City Register in Kings, Queens, New York or Bronx Counties, or in the local County Clerk’s office

in all other New York State Counties. If there is a mortgage on the marital residence it is important

that you speak with an attorney as well as the bank before the transfer is made. You may need the

bank or lender’s written consent before making any transfer.  Be aware that when you transfer real

property out of your name by signing and filing a deed or assignment and other required forms, this

does not relieve or excuse you from your obligations on any mortgage which you may have placed

on the property.

SUMMONS WITH NOTICE (Form UD-1):

    This form is used when commencing an action for divorce without a Verified Complaint. The Notice of

Automatic Orders, Notice of Guideline Maintenance if the divorce was commenced on or after 1/25/16,
and Child Support Standards Chart if applicable must, and the Notice Concerning Continuation of
Health Care Coverage should, be served with the Summons with Notice. Note:  if your action was
commenced before January 25, 2016 ,  the Maintenance Guidelines Law will not apply. 

Field 1:  Put the index number in the space provided.
Field 2: Print the county in which you are bringing this action.

Field 4:  The same as field 2.
Field 5:  Print the Plaintiff's name.
Field 6:  You must state the basis of venue, that is, why this case may be heard in the county you select. You

have several options: Plaintiff's residence (Plaintiff lives in the county), Defendant's residence
(Defendant lives in the county), or CPLR §509 (any other county so long as the Defendant does not
object and the court accepts the case). If you choose a county where neither party resides, you must
write in CPLR §509. The court must accept  the case if it is brought in the county where either the
Plaintiff or the Defendant resides. If you choose CPLR §509 and the other side does not challenge the
basis for venue, then the action may go forward in that county, but you should be aware that the court
may reject your case based on specific venue rules in the county where you are filing.

Field 7: 

Provide where either the Plaintiff or the Defendant resides depending on which party's              
residence was chosen as the basis of venue. For example, if the Plaintiff's residence is listed as the    
basis for venue, place the Plaintiff's address in this space. If Defendant's residence is chosen, list the
Defendant's address in this space. If CPLR §509 is chosen, list the Plaintiff's address in this space.

to custody, visitation, child support,  equitable distribution of specific property from the marriage,  maintenance,
counsel and/or experts fees, orders of protection, pension benefits, use of a former last name, exclusive
occupancy of the marital residence, and a request for transfer of title to the marital residence (whether a house,
cooperative aparment or condominium apartment). If there are unemancipated children of the marriage (see the
definition on page 7), child support must be listed in this section. You should also list any presently existing 
court orders (including the docket /case/index number) that you wish to be continued. (Note: when minor
children of the marriage reside in New York State, custody must be     determined). You should also list any
stipulations or agreements that you have made in writing with  the Defendant that you wish to become a part of
the judgment.  If you are waiving the distribution  of marital property or if marital property is being distributed
pursuant to an agreement/stipulation,  check the appropriate box.  If you are not seeking maintenance as
described in the Notice of Guideline Maintenance other than what was already agreed to in a written

Note: do not check these boxes if your action was commenced before January 25, 2016 because the
Maintenance Guidelines Law will not apply.  If your action was commenced before that date, and if you    seek
maintenance, instead include your request on the Lines for “Ancillary” or Other  Relief at Field 14 together
with your reasons. The court will decide your request in its discretion after considering certain factors.   If you
are not requesting “Ancillary” or Other Relief,  check the appropriate box.

 Important Note: If you do not ask for a type of “Ancillary” or Other  Relief in this section, you may be 
giving up your rights to things you may be entitled to.

MAINTENANCE GUIDELINES WORKSHEET

          CHILD SUPPORT WORKSHEET

   If the divorce was commenced on or after January 25, 2016 and if either party is seeking maintenance,

Form (UD-8-(1)and Form UD-8((2) are required forms.  If there are children of the marriage, Form UD-8(3)
is also required. If the Defendant seeks maintenance or child support, the Defendant must fill out the
applicable forms.

   To help you make the calculations on these forms, you may Use the Court’s  Maintenance and Child

Support Calculators available  online on  the Court’s Divorce Resources Website at 
http://www.nycourts.gov/divorce/MaintenanceChildSupportTools.shtml 

   (the “Calculators”).  They are provided for your convenience as a tool. They have been tested with many

scenarios to assure accuracy  with appropriate entry of data. You may wish to make the calculations
yourself on the applicable Appendices to  these Worksheets.  Neither these Worksheets nor the Calculators
are meant to predict what the court will order as to maintenance or child support in your case.

IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT USING THE CALCULATORS:      

   If you use the Calculators to make the calculations on the Worksheets, you must copy the
figures onto the applicable Appendices to the Worksheets so that the Court will have the
figures available when reviewing your divorce papers.  Work cannot be saved on the 
Online Calculator so it is a good idea to print out the work from the Calculators for your
records.  

   Make sure you read the Instructions on the above Website  at

 Appendix A is divided into three Parts: 

 Appendix A Section I - Gross Annual Income:  You must fill out all the items of Income 
     for both Plaintiff and Defendant on Appendix A Section I, if you know of them.  You may use a  tax return,
pay stub, W- 2 or any financial document that will assist you in completing the form. You     may also use
other information that you  have to assist you. For example, if the Defendant was    earning $20,000 per year
at the time you separated or if you know someone with the same job    making $20,000, you should list that
amount and state the source  of your information on Appendix   A.  If you do not know the Defendant's
income at present, write the  number “0" in all relevant sections with the word "unknown" next to that
amount. You may return to this  Court  or the Family Court should you learn Defendant's income at a later
date.  

Appendix A Section II  - Annual Deductions: Fill out all the Deductions for both Plaintiff and The
deductions used most often are: New York City or Yonkers income tax and Social Security taxes. 

ppendix A Section III - Subtract the total Deductions of Plaintiff from the total Income of Plaintiff to get
Plaintiff’s Net Annual Income and insert that amount in Section 1A of the Worksheet on   page 1.  Subtract
the total Deductions of Defendant from the total Income of Defendant to get Defendant’s Net  Annual
Income and insert that amount in Section 1B of the Worksheet on page 1.  Although Appendix A looks
complicated, a careful, step-by-step approach should help you complete it properly and without too much
trouble.

Special Instructions for Appendix G  

I. ADJUSTMENT FOR MAINTENANCE AND CALCULATION OF ANNUAL BASIC CHILD

SUPPORT OBLIGATION
In Line 1, enter the amount of the guideline award of maintenance on Income of  the Maintenance  Payor 
from  Line 3B on page 2 of the Maintenance  Worksheet (Form UD-8(2)), but if you and your spouse
have a written agreement as to maintenance, enter the agreed amount instead and check the
applicable box and submit the agreement to the Court to prove the correct amount. Note: if neither
party seeks maintenance, enter zero instead. Then adjust for maintenance to be  paid or received, if any,
by adding or subtracting the amount from Line 1 to  the income amounts of the party with the lower annual
income you enter in Line 2 and the party with the higher annual income you enter in Line 3 as instructed on
Lines 2 and 3.  Take the annual income amounts from Line 1A and  1B of Annual Income Worksheet
(Form UD-8(1)) that you have already filled out.  
In Line 4, Add Lines 2 and 3 to get the Combined Parental Income.
In Line 5,  enter the Income of the Non-Custodial Parent (the NCP).  The NCP is  the parent who does not have
the child.  To do this, copy the Net Annual Income from Section 2 of the Maintenance Guidelines Worksheet.   
Copy the income of the Maintenance Payor      

   or the Maintenance Payee, depending on which parent  does not  have the child.  The parent that

has the child will be the Custodial Parent (CP). 

    In Line 5a, Compute the NCP’s Percentage Share of Combined Income
     In  Line 5b, Compute the CP’s Percentage  Share of Combined Income by following the  directions 
     on the form.  This requires simple division. *

   * For Example: Suppose the Plaintiff is the NCP; his adjusted income is 

 

$30,000, and the Defendant's income is $20,000. The combined  income is 
$50,000.  You divide $30,000 [NCP income] by $50,000 [Combined income]. 
$30,000 / $50,000 = .60 or 60%.   To get the CP’s Percentage you divide $20,000 by $50,000    
[Combined Income]. $20,000/$50,000 = .40 or 40%. 

  These percentages are important, because  they will be  used later to determine obligations   
  of the parents for child support. 
 On Line 6, fill in the percentage that applies. The Child Support laws require certain percentages based on the  
number  of children.  Suppose you have one Child. The  percentage  would be 17%.
 On Line 7,  multiply the combined income up to $148,000 by the  percentage you entered in                           Line
6.  If the combined income is over $148,000, then disregard the amount exceeding  $148,000         
   for now and   multiply the appropriate percentage by $148,000. 
     * For Example: If the Plaintiff's adjusted income is $30,000 and the Defendant's adjusted  income is
$20,000 , then their combined income is $50,000.  Suppose there is one child.    You entered 17% on
Line 6 for 1 child.   You multiply $50,000 x 17% = $8,500. You now have the combined child support of
$8,500;

 On Line 8, multiply the combined child support from Line 7 by the NCP percentage in Line 5a to               
get the NCP’s Percentage Share of Child Support on Income Up to $148,000. *  

Page 27 of 45 Rev.9/30/18

    * For Example: Using the figures in the last two examples, $8,500 x 60% = $5,100.

On lines 9 -9c, compute  the amount of child support on Combined Parental Income  over $148,000, if any, that
you are asking the court to award.   Some people decide to simply use the same formula that was used in  Line 7 
and hope the court goes along with that, but the court might decide instead to consider the 10 child support
adjustment  factors in Appendix D.   Line 9c computes what that amount would be if the court uses the
percentages.  List the factors you would like the court to consider on Section 2  of the Child Support Worksheet
(see Field 8 above). 

II. Appendix G II. Determine Whether Low Income Exemption Applies

In lines 1-3, follow the instructions by subtracting the NCP’s Annual Basic Child Support  from the NCP’s
Annual  Income.   Enter the Result in Line 3.  Treat any negative number as  zero. 
There are three possibilities to see whether the Low Income Exemption Applies.

First -- If the figure you get in Line 3 of Section II  falls between the Poverty Level and the Self-Support

Reserve,* proceed to Line 4a to compute the difference between NCP Income and the Self Support      Reserve,
and  enter the greater of $600 or the difference on Line 4b of Section II.  Then Proceed to Section III  to compute
Add-on   Expenses. Note the Court has discretion whether to award the Add-on Expenses. 

Second -- If the figure you get in Line 3 of Section II is equal to or larger than the  Self-support Reserve,  then 

there will no low income adjustment. Go on to Section III.  

Third -- If the   figure  you get in Line 3b of Section II  is less than the poverty level, enter   $300 in  Line 4b of

Section II.  This will result in a child support of $300 per year unless the    Court decides this amount is “unjust
or inappropriate” based on the 10 child support adjustment factors in Appendix F to the Worksheet.  Skip
Section III and go on to Section IV. 

*Note: Every March 1st, the Poverty Level and Self-Support Reserve changes.  You may obtain                  the

most      Current figures from the Child Support Standards Chart available by April 1st at
https://childsupport.ny.gov/dcse/child_support_standards.html

III. Appendix G- III.  Child Support Add-On Expenses (Skip this Section if the Basic Child Support 

Obligation with Low Income Exemption is $300).
 There are two types of Child Support Add-on Expenses: “Mandatory” (or Required) Expenses (Sections           A
and B) and Discretionary Expenses. A pro rata share of Unreimbursed Health Insurance Expenses          and
Health Insurance Premiums for the children are mandatory expenses, as  are child care expenses     leading to
employment or while the custodial parent is working.  The Court has authority to award or apportion
additional reasonable expenses for child care and other education and extraordinary  expenses that do not
qualify as Mandatory Add-On Expenses.  However, If Line 3 of Section II is less than the Self Support
Reserve but greater than the poverty level, the Court has discretion whether or not to award the 
Mandatory Add- On Expenses.  (See DRL 240-(1-b)(d).    

   In Line A (1) , enter the cost of child care for child care expenses  leading to employment or while the

custodial parent is working   If you pay for any of those items, enter the total annual expense.  

    In Line A(2) enter NCP’s Percentage Share from Line 5a of Section I.
     In Line A(3) multiply the total child care expense (Line A(1)) by the non-custodial parent's Percentage    

  Share from Line A(2), and put the number in LineA(3).

* For Example: If NCP’s Percentage Share  is 60% and Line A(1)) is $1,000 then          

    
Line A(3)  would    be $1,000 x 60% = $600.
    In Lines B(4a) and B(4b)  enter the Non- Custodial Parent (NCP)’s  and the Custodial Parent (CP)’s

Percentage Shares of both health insurance premiums and future unreimbursed health    expenses.              
To do this, copy the NCP Percentage Share from Line 5a of Section 1 and CP’s Percentage Share           
from Line 5b of Section 1.   Note: this should be a percentage, not a dollar figure.
In Line 5, enter the annual cost of health insurance for the children. 

Page 28 of 45 Rev.9/30/18

In Line 6, enter yes or no to the question whether the NCP provides the health insurance for the children.
In Lines 6a and 6b follow the instructions to add or deduct the Percentage Share of health insurance         
    for the children.  If the NCP does not provide the insurance, multiply Line 4a by Line 5 and enter  the   
result.  If the NCP does provide the insurance, multiply Line 4b by  Line 5 and   enter the    result as a
negative number. 
In Line 7, enter the health insurance adjustment from Line 6a or 6b whichever applies.
In Line 8, total lines 3 and 7 to equal the total Add-On Expenses.
In Line 9, enter the total Discretionary Expenses for Child Care and education and extraordinary
expenses you are asking the Court to award, if any.  These amounts are up to the court’s discretion     and
will not be added to the totals.    

IV. Appendix G IV. Basic Annual Child Support Obligation

Line 1: Add Line 4b of Section II and Line 8 (consisting of the total of Lines 3 and 7) of Section III. To do this,
add Line 4b of Section II, and  Line 3 of Section III, and Line 7 of Section III.  Complete the total and enter this
amount on Line 5B of the Worksheet. However, if Line 3 of Section II is less than the Self Support Reserve but
greater than the poverty level, the total may be less after the Court  decides whether to award the add- on
expenses.  In that case, do not copy the amounts from Lines 3 and 7 of Section III but leave them blank for the
court to fill in and to complete the total to be entered on Line 5B of the Worksheet.   Now complete the rest of
the Worksheet starting with Section 2 at Field 8.

SUPPLEMENTAL APPENDIX OF FORMS INSTRUCTIONS

A. Income Withholding Order and Applying for Child Support Services 
A-1 Application for Child Support Services available at:
http://www.nycourts.gov/divorce/divorce_withchildrenunder21.shtmlA-2 Income Withholding
Order form for Child Support and Combined Child and Spousal Support -  LDSS-5037 (Non-IV-D
IWO)
.(Important Note: This is the actual Form - Use the LDSS-5039 as a Guide when filling it out.

If you or your spouse is to receive child support only or combined child support and maintenance (spousal
support), and if no child support services are already being provided through a local district Support
Collection Unit (see Instructions on page 11 about whether and how to apply for such services), you or your
spouse may ask the Court to issue an Income Withholding Order or the Court may decide to issue such an
order on its own.  In either case, the Income Withholding Order/Notice form is the form promulgated by the
NYS Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance pursuant to CPLR §§5241 and 5242 and must be used. 
No other form of Income Withholding Order can be used.  If you are the person making the payment, you
are the employee/obligor (or debtor).  If you are the person receiving the payment, you are the custodial
party/obligee (or creditor).  Follow the instructions in LDSS 5039, including the numbered instructions
for IWO Form LDSS-5037. 

A-2A Income Withholding Order for Spousal Support only- LDSS-5038 (Spousal Support Only IWO)

 (Important Note: This is the actual Form - Use the LDSS-5039 as a Guide when filling it out.
If you or your spouse is to receive maintenance (spousal support) only, and if no child support enforcement
services are already being provided through a local district Support Collection Unit (see Instructions on
page 11 about whether and how to apply for such services), you or your spouse may ask the Court to issue
an Income Withholding Order or the Court may decide to issue such an order on its own.  In either case, the
Income Withholding Order form is the form promulgated by the NYS Office of Temporary and Disability
Assistance pursuant to CPLR §§5241 and 5242. While not required, this form is recommended for use in
New York State for Spousal Support Only IWO’s.  On IWO Form LDSS-5038  (for Spousal Support Only
IWOs) areas not applicable to Spousal Support Only have been grayed out.  In addition to graying out fields
not applicable to the Spousal Support Only IWO, the other difference from LDSS-5037 is that Spousal
Support Only IWOs are payable to the “obligee,”  not the New York State Child Support Processing Center
(SDU). If you are the person making the payment, you are the employee/obligor (or debtor).  If you are the
person receiving the payment, you are the obligee (or creditor).   Follow the instructions in IWO Form
LDSS -5039, including the numbered instructions for IWO Form 5038.  
A-2B  Income Withholding for Support: General Information and Instructions for Issuing-LDSS-
5039
(Important Note: Do not complete this form.  Use it as a guide when filling out the actual Form LDSS-
5037      or LDSS-5038. )

Court Clerk for signature by the Judge. After it is signed by the Judge, you must serve a certified copy of
the Income Withholding Order on the parties listed in Part A of LDSS-5037 or LDSS-5038.  You may use
regular mail, but it is suggested that you file an Affidavit of Service of the IWO order with the Clerk of
the Court.  Spousal Support Only IWO orders (LDSS- 5038)  should NOT be served on the New York
State Child Support Processing Center (SDU).

B. NEW YORK STATE CASE REGISTRY FILING FORM:
Information about child support orders must be filed with the State Case Registry by filing a New York
State Registry Filing Form.  If a party to the order is receiving child support services from the support
collection unit (known as a IV-D case), the support collection unit will report the information.  A case is
receiving support collection services if: 1) the County Department of Social Services (or, in New York City,
HRA) is a party to the order because a child is receiving public assistance benefits, Medicaid or is in foster
care; or 2) a party has applied for services including collection and enforcement of the support order.  If you
are unsure whether the case is receiving child support services, contact the court clerk.

You MUST complete and submit the State Case Registry form:
a) if your case involves child support or combined spousal and child support and the Court issues an
Income            Withholding Order that requires the employer to remit payments to the NYS Child Support
Processing Center (SDU); or
b) if the court determines that immediate income withholding is not required by statute and payments are
made       directly to the custodial party/obligee. 

Note: If your support order is generated (or prepared) by Family Court, the court will take care of filing the
form, but if your support order is from Supreme Court, you must complete and use the form posted on the
Divorce Resources website at: http://www.nycourts.gov/divorce/forms_instructions/case-reg.pdf .  The
instructions are attached to the form.

You should NOT complete and submit the State Case Registry form:
a) if your case involves spousal support only; or
b) if a party to the order is applying for, or receiving, support services from, a local Support Collection Unit  
           pursuant to the child support program. 

If you are required to complete and submit the State Case Registry Form, follow the instructions
attached

POOR PERSON STATUS / WAIVER OF FILING FEES:

     The State of New York recognizes that some individuals may lack the financial resources needed to pay
the filing fees and court costs associated with filing for an uncontested divorce. The law permits an
application for poor person status, thus relieving the person of the obligation to pay those fees, costs and
expenses required. You will not be allowed an exemption from the obligation to pay merely because your
circumstances are difficult. Rather, you must fill out an affidavit that indicates you are unable to pay the
fees and costs associated with the lawsuit and as such will not be able to proceed in the absence of an order
granting an exemption.

     To request poor person status, you must fill out the Affidavit in Support of Application to Proceed as
a   Poor Person (with proof of income attached such as your W-2  or benefit statement),  and the Poor Person
Order and file these papers with the County Clerk's Office when you file the summons with notice or
summons and verified complaint. Before you file the papers, check with the County Clerk's Office or
Supreme Court clerk’s office for further instructions and to see if any additional papers are  needed to obtain
poor person status.    Be sure to make and retain copies of the papers. You may be required to serve a copy
of each set of papers upon the County Attorney (outside of New York City) or Corporation Counsel (within
the City of New York) and your spouse or his/her attorney. You are allowed to have these papers served  by
mail. Service by mail must be done by someone other than the Plaintiff who is over the age of 18 and
not a party to the action. The server may use the Affidavit of Service of Proposed Poor Person’s Order
included in this packet.  The Affidavit in Support of Application to Proceed as a Poor Person with proof of
income attached and the Poor Person Order must be attached to it.   Ask the person serving it to fill it out
and sign it before a notary public and return it to you.  

NOTE: If you are incarcerated, you cannot submit the poor person’s waiver forms included in this packet.
You will need to submit an application pursuant to C.P.L.R. 1101(f).
