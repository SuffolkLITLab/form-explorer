      <pre>SUPREME COURT, CIVIL BRANCH
QUEENS COUNTY
SELF-REPRESENTED INFORMATION OFFICE

NOTE:  PERSONS WITHOUT COUNSEL ARE ADVISED TO CONSULT AN ATTORNEY
ON  ALL  LEGAL  MATTERS.    NEITHER  THE  SELF-REPRESENTED  INFORMATION
OFFICE  NOR  ANY  MEMBER  OF  THE  COURT'S  STAFF  MAY  GIVE  YOU  LEGAL
ADVICE, PREPARE YOUR PAPERS OR ACT AS YOUR ATTORNEY.

THE DISCOVERY PROCESS

In many civil actions, before the case is resolved there takes place a process

known as pretrial discovery.  This summary describes this process.

A  lawsuit  should  not  be  a  contest  in  the  dark.    Justice  is best  served  by

having all the relevant facts known to all the parties (the plaintiff(s) and the defendant(s))

before trial.  Therefore, the Civil Practice Law and Rules (the "CPLR" for short)

(Article 31) provides that the parties to a lawsuit may obtain certain information from one

another  about  the  merits  of  the  case.    For  example,  if  a  plaintiff  sues  a  defendant(s)

claiming to have suffered personal injuries and as a result of the defendant's negligence

(lack of ordinary care), the defendant(s) are normally permitted to examine copies of the

plaintiff's  medical  records  concerning  the  injuries  in  question  and/or  have  the  plaintiff

examined by a doctor chosen by the defendant.  The plaintiff is normally permitted to ask

oral questions of the defendant or his/her/its employee about his/her conduct at the scene

of the accident on the day in issue.

The key discovery devices (methods) are:

(a) Interrogatories:   These are written, numbered questions posed by a party. 

A space is left after each question in which the opposing party is required to insert an

answer.  Each question must be answered separately and fully.  The person answering is

obligated to swear to the truth of the answers given and to return them to the sender within

20 days from service of the interrogatories (25 if the service was by mail), although this

period is often extended by the agreement of the parties.  CPLR 3130 to 3133.  The party

served with the questions may object to them rather than answer them if they are defective

(e.g.,  a  question  is  incomprehensible).    All  objections  must  be  stated  with  reasonable

particularity.  If a party objects only to some of the interrogatories, he or she must answer

those as to which he or she does not object. 1  

(b)

Document Demand:  As the name indicates, this is a written demand

in which one party demands that the other produce certain documents for inspection and

copying.  (This device is also referred to as a "notice of discovery and inspection").  The

demand must define the items sought with reasonable particularity.  CPLR 3120.  The

same time is allowed to answer as with interrogatories.  Objections may be made to the

demand  but  they  too  must  be  set  forth  with  reasonable  particularity.    CPLR  3122(a). 

Where  documents  are  withheld  because  an  objection  is  made,  the  party  doing  the

withholding must specify the  ground(s)/reason(s)  for withholding each  such document. 

See CPLR 3122(b).

(c)

Depositions:  Depositions (also known as examinations before trial (or

EBTs for short) are sessions conducted in almost the same manner as a trial (however a

judge is not present) CPLR 3113 in which a party poses oral questions to an adversary or

a  nonparty  witness  about  relevant  issues.    The  person  to  whom  the  questions  are

addressed is placed under oath, and the questions and the spontaneous answers thereto

are recorded by a court reporter for transcription into a written text.  The person answering

the questions does so under oath.  A deposition on written questions is one in which the

questioner submits written questions and an unrelated party, usually the court reporter,

poses the questions as written and records and transcribes the oral answers.

Frequently, the Justice presiding over a case will issue an order scheduling

the  discovery  to  be  taken  in  the  case  at  a  so-called  preliminary  conference.    such  a

1To be distinguished from interrogatories but perhaps likely

to be confused by the lay person is the bill of particulars. 
This is typically used in personal injury litigation, in which
the complaint often contains vague claims.  Frequently, a
defendant who remains uncertain of the nature of the plaintiff's
claims will serve a series of written questions on the plaintiff
known as a demand for a bill of particulars.  The purpose of the
bill is to amplify or particularize the allegations of the
complaint.  The plaintiff is obliged to supply a bill within 30
days (35 if mail was used by the sender) to the extent that he or
she does not object to any aspects of the demand.

conference can be requested by serving a notice to that effect on all parties and presenting

the original to the Trial Support Office (Room 140) together with proof of service.  If a

Request for Judicial Intervention (an "RJI" for short) has not previously been filed for the

case,  the  party  requesting  the  RJI  must  file  one  and  pay  the  required  fee  ($75.00). 

Instructions on how to file an RJI are available from the Office of Public Information.

At times a party to a case may fail to provide discovery requested by another

party or may obstruct the other party's attempts to obtain that discovery.  Should that occur,

the aggrieved party should, in the first instance, contact counsel for the adversary -- or, if

the adversary is self-represented, the adversary himself or herself -- and attempt to reach

an amicable resolution to the dispute.  If that does not succeed, the aggrieved party may

wish to consider a motion to compel the adversary to provide the missing discovery and/or

to penalize the adversary for obstructive conduct.  Furthermore, the Administrative Judge

of Supreme Court, Civil Branch, Queens County  has issued a directive stating that parties

who have a dispute regarding discovery in a case where an RJI has not been filed must

request  a  preliminary  conference  instead  of  proceeding  by  motion.    A  copy  of  Justice

Fisher's rule (Part I) is attached as an Appendix.

If a motion is to proceed, a motion to compel is one available as a remedy. 

See CPLR 3124.  CPLR 3126 provides for the imposition of certain penalties upon a party

who fails to obey a discovery order or willfully fails to disclose information in a case.  A

motion made pursuant to either of these sections must be accompanied by an affidavit of

good  faith,  that  is,  an  affidavit  setting  forth  in  detail  the  efforts  that  were  made  by  the

parties to resolve the discovery dispute without court intervention (that is, what contacts

were made or attempted and their outcome).

Once either all necessary discovery has been completed or the allotted time

for doing so has expired, a party to the case (usually the plaintiff) should press for some

substantive disposition of the case.  Most frequently, this is done by trying to settle the

case, making a motion for summary judgment, if one is well-founded, or noticing the case

for trial.

Instructions on how to notice a case for trial (which requires the filing of a

Note of Issue) is available from the Self-Represented Information Office.

3

Also in certain instances the Justice assigned to a particular case may order

that a Note of Issue be filed and if one is not, dismiss the case.  Should that happen, the

only motion that will be accepted by the Court will be a motion to vacate (or set aside) that

dismissal.  A copy of Justice Fisher's rule to that effect is attached as an Appendix (Rule

II).
