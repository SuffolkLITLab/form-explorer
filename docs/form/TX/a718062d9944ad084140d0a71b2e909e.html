      <pre>Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions

Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision

APPEAL NO.:

00-001

RESPONDENT:

J. B. Marshall, Jr., Presiding Judge, Pflugerville Municipal Court

DATE:

February 4, 2000

SPECIAL COMMITTEE:

Judge Pat McDowell, Judge Olen Underwood, Judge B. B. Schraub,
Judge Darrell Hester, Judge Ray D. Anderson

The applicant is an individual who has requested that the Pflugerville Municipal Court allow him to
view traffic citations for research he is conducting regarding “how the city of Pflugerville does business
regarding traffic citations.”  The presiding judge of the municipal court has refused access to the traffic
citation records on the ground that they are exempt under the provisions of Rule 12.5(d) of the Rules of
Judicial Administration.  The applicant has filed a petition for review of this denial of access.

The threshold issue in a Rule 12 appeal is whether the records are “judicial records,” which are

defined by Rule 12.2(d) as follows:

“Judicial record means a record made or maintained by or for a court or judicial agency
in its regular course of business but not pertaining to its adjudicative function, regardless
of  whether  that  function  relates  to  a  specific  case.    A  record  of  any  nature  created,
produced, or filed in connection with any matter that is or has been before a court is not
a judicial record.”

Traffic citation records pertain to the municipal court’s adjudicative function and are created,
produced, and filed in connection with matters that are or have been before the municipal court.  Thus, they
are not judicial records within the meaning of Rule 12, and we cannot decide the question of whether they
are exempt from disclosure.  Accordingly, we can neither grant the petition in whole or in part nor sustain
the denial of access to the requested record.  Nevertheless, we will explain the duties of a court in relation
to public access to case records of this type.

As previously discussed, Rule 12 is a new rule designed to define public access to judicial records,
which are those records not related to a court’s adjudicative function.  Other records, which are related
to a court’s adjudicative function, are subject to other rules or laws.  For purposes of this discussion, we
will call those records “court records.”  

Rule 76a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure governs public access to civil court records. It
provides that civil court records “are presumed to be open to the general public.”  They may be sealed only
upon a showing of  “a specific, serious and substantial interest which clearly outweighs . . . this presumption
of openness; [and] any probable adverse effect that sealing will have upon the general public health or

safety; [and that] no less restrictive means than sealing records will adequately and effectively protect the
specific interest asserted.”

Public access to criminal court records, such as those at issue here, are governed by common law
and constitutional law.  The common law right to public access was articulated by the United States
Supreme Court in Nixon v. Warner Communications, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597, 98 S.C t. 1306, 1312
(1978), as follows:

“It is clear that the courts of this country recognize a general right to inspect and
copy public records and documents, including judicial records and documents.  In contrast
to the English practice, . . . American decisions generally do not condition enforcement of
this right on a proprietary interest in the document or upon a  need for it as evidence in a
lawsuit.  The interest necessary to support the issuance of a writ compelling access has
been found, for example, in the citizen’s desire to keep a watchful eye on the workings of
public agencies . . . .”

The constitutional law relating to public access to criminal court records was summarized by the
court in  Express-News Corp. v. MacRae, 787 S.W.2d 451, 452 (Tex. App.–San Antonio 1990), as
follows:

“The public’s right to public trials under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the
United States Constitution includes a presumption that judicial records will be open to
inspection by the press and public.   Nixon v. Warner Communications, Inc., 435 U.S.
589, 597, 98 S.C t. 1306, 1312 (1978).  This presumption of openness may be overcome
by a countervailing interest, such as the defendant’s right to a fair trial, but the reason for
closure or sealing must be apparent and clearly articulated.  Richmond Newspapers v.
Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 581, 100 S.Ct. 2814, 2829-30 (1980);  Houston Chronicle
Publishing Co. v. Hardy, 578 S.W.2d 495, 499 (Tex. App.–Corpus Christi, 1984),
cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1052, 105 S.Ct. 1754 (1985).”

In  Star-Telegram, Inc. v. Walker, 834 S.W.2d 54, 57 (Tex. 1992), the court conditionally
granted a writ of mandamus against a trial court which had prohibited a newspaper from publishing the
identity of a rape victim which had already been disclosed in an indictment, a motion in limine, and a charge
to the jury.  The court held that once they are filed with the court, court records become public records.

Although court records are not records covered by the Public Information Act (formerly “Open
Records Act”), Texas Government Code §552.001 et seq., several attorney general open records letters
have discussed the issue, and found a right to public access.  OR99-1825 (traffic citations are subject to
disclosure  under  common-law  right  to  copy  and  inspect  court  records  and  statutory  law  governing
municipal  courts);  OR99-2611  (personal  information  such  as  place  of  employment,  work  and  home
telephone numbers of the accused which are found in traffic citations maintained by police department are
not  exempt  from  disclosure);  OR99-0766  (traffic  citations  maintained  by  city  are  subject  to  Public
Information Act); OR99-3698 (distinguishing between records maintained solely by municipal court and
those also maintained by city).

For the reasons stated, this review committee can neither grant the petition in whole or in part nor

sustain the denial of access to the requested records.
