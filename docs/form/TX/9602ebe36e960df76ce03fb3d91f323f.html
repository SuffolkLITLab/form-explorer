5 

5

Court of Criminal Appeals 
Rules of Judicial Education 
-Continued-

curriculum is pertinent to the duties and responsibilities of each office. 
The  determination  of  the  applicability  of  the  course  to  each  or  either

jurisdiction  over  each  office  in  accordance  with  that  committee’s

*Amended  3/2008:  the  amendment  to  Rule  5  clarifies  and  memorializes  a  long-held
construction  by  the  Municipal  Courts  Education  Committee.  Specifically,  all  municipal
judges,  including  judges  who  serve  in  the  dual  capacity  as  a  municipal  judge  and  as
justice of the peace are required first to complete two years of instruction pertaining to the
duties of the office of municipal judge from the Texas Municipal Courts Education Center
before  being  eligible  to  meet  judicial  education  requirements  pursuant  to  Rule  5b.  As
amended, Rule 5 parallels the provision of Rule 3a (1) – (2), requiring that justices of the
peace  obtain  their  first  two  years  of  instruction  from  the  Texas  Justice  Court  Training
Center.

The  Education  Committee  has  long  construed  the  provisions  of  Rule  5  collectively. 
Accordingly, this amendment is not intended as a substantive change. Rather, it merely 
clarifies that Rule 5b and Rule 5c are construed respectively in light of the provisions of 
Rule 5a. 

RULE 6. 

COURT COORDINATORS. 
a. Each court coordinator of a district or statutory county court shall annually
complete 16 hours of continuing education, unless the court coordinator
files with the Texas Center for the Judiciary, Inc., the prescribed form, 
signed by the judge or commissioners court of the county employing the 
court coordinator certifying that state and local funds are not available 
for the court coordinator's continuing education. 

 

b.

In  addition  to  the  programs  provided  in  Rule  2c,  programs  of  the
following  organizations  can  be  utilized  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of
Rule 6a:
(1) The Texas Association of Court Administration
(2) The Texas Office of Court Administration
(3) The National Association for Court Management

c. Instruction  credit  completed  during  any  fiscal  year  in  excess  of  the 
minimum number of hours required may be applied to the following fiscal 
year's requirement.

d. Each court coordinator who attends an approved program or performs

education that fiscal year of the deficiency. 

f.

16-hour requirement by August 31, the Texas Center will notify the 
sitting judge of that court of the delinquency.

waiver  for  good  cause  shown,  it  will  report  the  name  of  the  judge  or 
judicial  officer  to  the  State  Commission  on  Judicial  Conduct  by 
November 1. 

b.  Thereafter,  the  applicable  Committee  shall  not  communicate  with  the 
judge  or  judicial  officer  as  to  their  status  except  to  refer  them  to  the 
Commission on Judicial Conduct.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
