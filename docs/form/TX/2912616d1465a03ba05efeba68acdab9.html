I.  Introduction and Executive Summary 
 

This  is  the  sixth  annual  report  of  the  Texas  Forensic  Science  Commission  (“FSC”  or 

“Commission”).  The Commission is required to publish an annual report by December 1st every 

year in accordance with its statute.  (See Exhibit A, TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art 38.01, § 8.)  The 

first annual report provided a historical assessment of the Commission’s work since the agency 

was  created  in  2005,  covering  Commission  decisions  through  the  April  2012  meeting.    The 

second report covered Commission activities from May 1, 2012 through November 1, 2013.  The 

third report covered Commission activities from November 2, 2013 through November 30, 2014.

3.  Forensic development activities; and 

4.  A description of activities in forensic reform at the national level. 

 

II.  Legal Duties and Investigative Scope 
 

A.  Historical Perspective 

For a complete historical perspective on the creation and evolution of the Texas Forensic 

Science Commission, please see Section II of our first annual report, which may be obtained on 

the Commission’s website, or by emailing Commission staff at info@fsc.texas.gov. 

B.  Investigative Jurisdiction 
 
The  Commission  is  responsible  for  implementing  a  system  through  which  crime 

 

 

laboratories  may  report  professional  negligence  or  professional  misconduct.    The  Commission 

requires  crime  laboratories  that  conduct  forensic  analyses  to  report  professional  negligence  or 

professional misconduct to the Commission through its self-disclosure program. 

 

 

The Commission may also investigate complaints received from outside parties or initiate 

an  investigation  on  its  own  depending  on  the  circumstances.    The  statute  divides  the 

Commission’s investigative responsibilities into the following three categories: 

a)  Investigations  Initiated  by  the  Commission:  The  Commission  may  initiate  an 
investigation  of  a  forensic  analysis  for  educational  purposes  without  receiving  a 
complaint  if  the  Commission  determines  by  majority  vote  that  the  investigation 
would advance the integrity and reliability of forensic science in Texas.  
 

b)  Complaints Involving Unaccredited Labs or Unaccredited Forensic Fields: The 
Commission  may  investigate  a  complaint  involving  a  crime  laboratory  that  is  not 
accredited  by  the  Commission,  or  conduct  an  investigation  in  response  to  an 
allegation  involving  a  forensic  method  or  methodology  that  is  not  an  accredited 
field of forensic science. 

c)  Complaints  Involving  Accredited  Labs  and  Accredited  Forensic  Disciplines:  
The  Commission  is  also  charged  with  investigating  allegations  of  professional 
negligence or misconduct against accredited crime laboratories involving accredited 
forensic disciplines.   

5 

or the first two investigative categories set forth above, Commission reports are limited 

  F

to: (1) observations regarding the integrity and reliability of the forensic analysis conducted; (2) 

best  practices  identified  during  the  course  of  the  investigation;  and  (3)  other  relevant 

recommendations as determined by the Commission. 

Under  the  third  category  of  investigations  involving  accredited  crime  laboratories  and 

accredited  forensic  disciplines,  Commission  reports  must  be  more  extensive.    Required 

categories  per  the  Commission’s  statute  include:  (1)  a  description  of  the  alleged  negligence  or 

misconduct; (2) whether negligence or misconduct occurred; (3) any corrective action required 

of the laboratory; (4) observations regarding the integrity and reliability of the forensic analysis 

conducted; (5) best practices identified during the course of the investigation; (6) other relevant 

recommendations, as determined by the Commission; and (7) the methods and procedures used 

by the Commission to identify the items listed above. 

 

 

In addition, the statute provides that reports may include: (1) retrospective reexamination 

of  other  forensic  analyses  conducted  by  the  laboratory  that  may  involve  the  same  kind  of 

negligence  or  misconduct;  and  (2)  follow-up  evaluations  of  the  laboratory  to  review:  (a) 

implementation  of  any  corrective  action  required;  or  (b)  conclusion  of  any  retrospective 

reexamination. 

 

 

The Commission may not issue a finding relating to the guilt or innocence of any party in 

a civil or criminal trial involving conduct investigated by the Commission.  Commission reports 

are  not  admissible  in  a  civil  or  criminal  action.    Information  filed  or  obtained  as  part  of  a 

complaint or laboratory self-disclosure is not subject to release under the Public Information Act 

until the conclusion of a Commission investigation.1

III. Legislative Changes and Related Initiatives 

  A. Administrative Attachment Move from SHSU to OCA 

 

Effective September 1, 2017, Senate Bill 1124 changed the Commission's administrative 

attachment from Sam Houston State University ("SHSU") to the Office of Court Administration 

("OCA").  Though the Commission did not change locations physically, it is now part of OCA 

and the Commission's employees are employees of OCA.  OCA provides the Commission with 

valuable support services such as budget management, information technology management and 

human resources support. 

  B. Funding for Implementation of the Forensic Analyst Licensing Program 

 

In  addition  to  moving  the  Commission's  administrative  attachment  to  OCA,  the  85th 

Legislature  also  allocated  the  Commission  an  additional  $138,000  to  implement  its  Forensic 

Analyst  Licensing  program  for  fiscal  year  2018,  including  contracting  for  appropriate  content 

management  software,  hiring  a  senior  scientific  advisor  with  forensic  expertise  to  assist  in 

managing the program and other items necessary to implement the program as required by law.  

The  Commission  expects  to  receive  some  revenue  from  licensing  fees  in  future  fiscal  years, 

beginning  in  fiscal  year  2019,  with  the  expectation  that  the  licensing  program  may  eventually 

become self-sustaining.  The Commission's allotted funds for fiscal year 2019 will be reduced to 

$528,000 with the expectation the Commission will receive fee revenue to support the licensing 

program. 

  C. Studies Regarding Use of Drug Field Test Kits and Crime Scene Investigations  

  With  the  passage  of  House  Bill  34,  the  85th  Legislature  required  the  Commission  to 

conduct a study regarding the use of drug field test kits by law enforcement agencies in Texas. 

Specifically, the Commission is required to (1) evaluate the quality, accuracy, and reliability of 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

drug field test kits; (2) identify any common problems with drug field test kits; (3) evaluate the 

availability and adequacy of training for law enforcement officers regarding the use of drug field 

test  kits  and  the  interpretation  of  the  test  results;  and  (4)  develop  legislative  recommendations 

regarding  the  use  of  drug  field  test  kits  by  law  enforcement  agencies  and  regarding  related 

training for law enforcement officers.  The Commission will issue its findings by December 1, 

2018 as required by HB-34. 

 

 

In addition to the drug field test kit study, HB-34 required the Commission to conduct a 

study regarding the manner in which crime scene investigations are conducted in Texas.  In its 

second  quarter  this  year,  the  Commission  received  a  crime  scene  investigation  laboratory  self-

disclosure  from  the  Houston  Forensic  Science  Center.    The  Commission  voted  at  its  May  26, 

2017 meeting to review the self-disclosure as part of its crime scene investigation study and issue 

best practices in the field of crime scene investigations in response to the issues identified in the 

self-disclosure.  The Commission expects to issue a report by December 1, 2018 as required by 

HB-34. 

  D. Crime Laboratory Accreditation Program 

 

The  Commission  is  responsible  for  establishing  procedures,  policies  and  practices  to 

improve  the  quality  of  forensic  analyses  conducted  in  Texas.    The  Commission  currently 

recognizes accreditation for 102 laboratories located both in and outside of Texas. Please see the 

accreditation page on the Commission’s website for more information about the crime laboratory 

accreditation program, its requirements and a list of accredited labs in and outside of Texas.  

  E. Forensic Analyst Licensing Program 

  All forensic analysts in Texas are required to be licensed under Texas law by January 1, 

2019.  The term “forensic analyst” is limited by statute to “a person who on behalf of a crime 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

laboratory  accredited  under  this  article  technically  reviews  or  performs  a  forensic  analysis  or 

draws  conclusions  from  or  interprets  a  forensic  analysis  for  a  court  or  crime  laboratory.    The 

term  does  not  include  a  medical  examiner  or  other  forensic  pathologist  who  is  a  licensed 

physician.”   

 

 

In  December  2015,  the  Commission  selected  a  licensing  advisory  committee  consisting 

of one prosecutor, one defense attorney and seven individuals who are forensic scientists, crime 

laboratory directors or crime laboratory quality managers representative of city, county, state and 

private  laboratories.    For  a  list  and  biographies  of  the  selected  licensing  advisory  committee 

members,  please  visit  the  Commission’s  website  here.    The  licensing  advisory  committee  has 

met  more  than  twenty  times  since  its  creation  in  December  2015.  The  Committee  presented  a 

formal  rule  proposal  on  the  licensing  program  to  the  full  Commission  at  its  May  26,  2017 

meeting.  Commission  members  adopted  the  proposal  with  some  changes  and  the  licensing 

program's  administrative  rules  were  proposed  in  the  Texas  Administrative  Code.  The 

Commission  received  many  comments  in  response  to  its  proposed  rules  for  the  licensing 

program  and  made  adjustments  to  the  licensing  requirements  in  response  to  many  of  the 

comments.  Full  responses  were  issued  for  each  comment  and  addressed  universally  to  all 

stakeholders. The Commission posted a new version of the revised licensing program rules for 

comment  in  the  December  15th  issue  of  the  Texas  Register.    For  developmental  updates  and 

additional information related to the Commission’s Forensic Analyst Licensure Program, please

B.  New Staff Member 

In November 2018, the Commission hired a Senior Scientific Advisor, D. Jody Koehler, 

to  assist  the  Commission  and  its  staff  with  the  technical  aspects  of  the  Commission's 

investigative, accreditation and licensing programs.  Koehler has over 18 years of experience as a 

forensic  biologist,  including  work  as  a  DNA  Technical  Leader,  DNA  Section  Manager,  and 

Laboratory  Manager.  She  currently  serves  as  a  lead  assessor  for  the  ANSI-ASQ  National 

Accreditation  Board.    Koehler  is  a  member  of  the  American  Society  of  Crime  Laboratory 

Directors and the American Association of Forensic DNA Analysts and Administrators and has 

authored various publications on validation and analysis of forensic casework.   

C. Annual Budget 

The FSC’s annual budget was increased during the 85th Legislative Session to $638,000 

for  fiscal  year  2018  to  support  the  development  and  implementation  of  the  licensing  program, 

but  will  be  reduced  to  $528,000  for  fiscal  year  2019  in  anticipation  that  fee  revenue  will  be 

received to offset part of the cost of administering the program.  A copy of the FSC’s projected 

budget (major categories) for FY2018 is attached as Exhibit B.  The Commission will dedicate 

funds to the following critical priorities during FY2018: (1) funding of staff salary and overhead; 

(2)  complaint  and  disclosure  investigative  activities;  (3)  management  of  the  accreditation 

program; (4) development and implementation of the Forensic Analyst Licensing Program; (5) 

statewide  reviews  of  forensic  disciplines  such  as  crime  scene  investigation,  blood  stain  pattern 

     

 

 

analysis  and  field  drug  testing;  and  (6)  collaborative  training  projects  with  the  Texas  Criminal 

Justice  Integrity  Unit  (“TCJIU”)  and  other  stakeholders.    Exhibit  B  provides  a  breakdown  of 

projected costs in major categories. 

V. Summary of Complaints and Disclosures 

 

 

Commission staff receives complaints from a range of sources, including but not limited 

to attorneys (both defense and prosecution), current inmates and their families/friends, national 

advocacy groups, former laboratory employees, other laboratories and interested members of the 

public.  The Commission relies upon accredited crime laboratories and interested members of the 

public to bring issues of concern to the Commission’s attention.  

A. Complaint/Disclosure Tally 

To date, the Commission has received a total of 203 complaints and 40 self-disclosures, 

and has disposed of 195 complaints and disclosures, either through dismissal, investigation and 

release  of  a  report,  and/or  referral  to  another  agency.   Of  the  179  total  complaints  and  self-

disclosures received, 63 were received from December 2, 2016 through the date of this report. 

The  Commission  currently  has  12  open  complaints/self-disclosures;  this  number  includes  4 

active investigations involving 7 cases, not including the discipline-specific reviews described in 

Section  VII  below.   A  complete  spreadsheet  detailing  the  disposition  and  status  of  each 

complaint is provided at Exhibit C. 

B.  Complaint/Disclosure Screening Process 

Pursuant  to  Section  3  of  the  Commission’s  Policies  and  Procedures,  the  Commission’s 

Complaint  and  Disclosure  Screening  Committee  conducts  an  initial  review  of  complaints  and 

disclosures before each meeting. After discussion, the Committee makes a recommendation on 

what  further  action  (if  any)  is  merited  for  each  complaint  or  self-disclosure  received.    The 

 

12 

Committee’s  opinion  is  presented  to  the  full  Commission  for  consideration  and  deliberation 

during the quarterly meeting. 

As  previously  described,  the  Commission  may  only  review  allegations  of  professional 

negligence or misconduct for those cases involving accredited crime laboratories and accredited 

forensic disciplines.  The Commission receives many complaints falling outside those statutory 

requirements, and typically will only review cases involving unaccredited disciplines and entities 

if  a  majority  of  the  Commission  determines  the  review  would  be  an  effective  use  of  public 

resources  and  is  likely  to  benefit  the  criminal  justice  system  in  Texas.    Many  complaints  are 

dismissed  because  they  do  not  meet  these  standards.    Other  complaints  are  dismissed  because 

they  lack  fundamental  information  or  simply  fail  to  state  an  actual  complaint  for  which  the 

Commission  has  jurisdiction.    Finally,  the  Commission  must  dismiss  any  complaint  involving 

the portion of an autopsy conducted by a medical examiner or other forensic pathologist who is a 

licensed physician.  See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. 38.01, § 2(4). 

VI. Summary of Pending Complaint and Self-Disclosure Investigations and Reports 

 

At this time, one complaint and one disclosure are pending investigation and release of a 

final  report  by  the  Commission:  (1)  a  complaint  by  a  Harris  County  Public  Defender’s  Office

VII. Discipline-Specific Reviews 

A.  Microscopic Hair Analysis 

1.   Background 

At  its  November  1,  2013  meeting,  the  Commission  appointed  an  investigative  panel  to 

coordinate a review of testimony in Texas hair microscopy cases in response to a similar review 

conducted by the FBI.  The Commission's investigative panel convened a team of subject matter 

experts  and  attorneys  to  develop  case  review  criteria  and  review  testimony  in  identified  hair 

cases.    The  review  panel  limited  its  review  of  cases  to  those  in  which  an  individual  was 

convicted of a crime, there was a positive, probative association made by a hair examiner in a 

laboratory report, the association was in any way significant to the outcome, and the examiner 

provided subsequent testimony as an expert witness at trial.   

2.  Review Criteria 

The team asked the following questions regarding the cases it reviewed:  

1.  Did the report or testimony contain a statement of identification? 
2.  Did the report or testimony assign probability or statistical weight? 
3.  Did the report or testimony contain any other potentially misleading statements or 

inferences? 

If  the  answer  to  any  of  these  questions  was  affirmative,  the  Commission  notified 

interested  parties  of  the  review  team’s  specific  findings.  For  a  complete  background  on  the 

Commission's  hair  microscopy  review,  please  refer  to  the  Commission's  Fifth  Annual  Report 

published on December 1, 2016. 

3.  Case Review Process 

The  Commission  approved  a  sub-sampling  approach  to  case  identification  that  allowed 

for  the  generation  of  a  reasonable  number  of  cases  for  review  without  adding  to  existing 

laboratory backlogs.  Staff requested that each laboratory provide the first 10 cases from every 

 

 

14 

decade for which the laboratory performed microscopic hair comparisons and received responses 

from 20 Texas labs. The lab responses were timely and thorough, but not uniform. In total, the 

labs submitted 693 cases to the Commission. In addition to the lab submissions, staff conducted 

case research on LexisNexis.  Specific case submissions are described below: 

•  Texas  DPS  –  412  cases  total  representing  10  cases  from  each  decade  for  each 

•  Bexar  County  –  61  cases  representing  all  positive  associations  from  1989  to 

regional lab (est. 20% of total) 

present 

•  Fort Worth PD – 50 cases up to 1995 
•  Harris County IFS – 7 cases representing all cases from 1988 to  
•  Houston PD – 65 of 220 cases where a report was issued 
•  Jefferson County – 51 cases representing all hair cases 
•  Pasadena – 8 cases representing all hair cases 
•  SWIFS  –  36  cases  representing  all  cases  from  1991  where  positive  probation 

•  Tarrant County ME – 22 cases representing 10 per decade where hair microscopy 

associations were made 

was performed 

•  LexisNexis – 120 cases 

 

Further  investigation  and  screening  of  these  cases  was  necessary  to  facilitate  trial 

testimony review.  In Texas, there is no central repository of information on criminal convictions 

or  trial  transcripts.    Each  local  jurisdiction  keeps  its  own  records  and  does  not  always  retain 

copies of trial transcripts for old cases. If post-conviction action was taken, it is possible one of 

the higher courts stored a transcript.  Even for cases that went to trial, if no appeal was filed there 

is a strong likelihood the transcript was never prepared by the court reporter.   

Retroactive  case  reviews  starting  with  lab  reports  presented  certain  challenges.    The 

biggest  challenge  was  that  a  lab  report  has  very  limited  information  concerning  the  ultimate 

outcome  of  the  criminal  case.    There  is  no  information  concerning  whether  a  criminal 

prosecution  followed,  the  form  the  prosecution  took  (plea  or  trial)  or  the  ultimate  disposition.  

Staff  utilized  several  steps  of  screening  and  investigation  to  narrow  down  the  list  of  cases  to 

those involving positive probative associations where a conviction was obtained. 

 

15 

To tackle the lab submissions, the team split into two sub-teams to identify which reports 

contained positive probative associations.  Each sub-team was assigned approximately half of the 

693 lab reports for review.  This first round of case screening resulted in 287 total cases where a 

positive probative association was made.   

The  LexisNexis/Westlaw  list  of  120  cases  provided  more  information  because  it 

consisted of criminal convictions that were appealed where hair microscopy or hair comparison 

evidence  was  mentioned  in  the  reported  opinion.    Further  screening  of  this  set  of  cases  was 

necessary to determine if the cases fit the parameters of the review.  Staff conducted additional 

investigation and greatly reduced the number of cases on this list. 

The next step involved further research of the 287 positive probative association cases to 

determine if a criminal conviction was obtained, whether it was by plea or trial, and finally if a 

trial  transcript  was  available  for  review.    Staff  meticulously  investigated  each  case  utilizing 

various resources.  Many counties have digitized criminal case records making it easier to search 

for a criminal defendant in a jurisdiction.  The Texas appellate courts have a robust system-wide 

online case search database providing information on criminal post-conviction proceedings, both 

at the appellate courts and at the Court of Criminal Appeals.  Other publicly available resources 

such as the Texas Sex Offender Registry, news websites, and Google searches provided further 

useful information.  

Staff conducted further screening and investigation of the positive probative association 

list and the LexisNexis/Westlaw list, narrowing the final list to 79 criminal convictions by trial 

where a trial transcript may be available for review. Staff requested and collected all available 

trial records.  It is important to note not all cases on the final list had trial transcripts available for 

 

16 

review. Six cases on the final list did not have a trial transcript available for review, bringing the 

total cases available for review down to 73.   

In addition to those cases that went to trial, staff determined that at least 29 cases were 

disposed  of  by  plea  bargain.    No  problematic  statements  of  association  were  noted  in  the  lab 

reports for these cases, and it was not possible to assess the impact (if any) the hair analysis may 

have had on the defendant’s decision to enter a plea agreement. 

The  final  stage  of  the  review  required  the  team  to  analyze  trial  testimony  for  the 

remaining  cases,  answer 

the 

three  review  criteria  questions,  and  make  notification 

recommendations  to  the  Commission.    Staff  secured  assistance  with  this  task  from  Latham  & 

Watkins’s  Houston  office.    On  October  28,  2015,  staff  and  members  of  the  team  provided 

training for Latham & Watkins attorneys.  

4.  Case Review Results 

One of the first steps taken by the team and Commission staff was to identify those cases 

in which individuals are still incarcerated.  Among those individuals, an even higher priority was 

to identify those individuals who are currently on death row.  Because they have been sentenced 

to  the  ultimate  penalty,  the  team  felt  a  review  of  their  cases  should  be  prioritized.  The  team 

obtained laboratory reports and reviewed relevant testimony in all death penalty cases on the list 

while the criteria review process was still in development for other cases.  The team did not want 

an administrative or procedural issue (i.e., finalization of the criteria checklists) to delay reviews 

for cases in which defendants have been sentenced to death.  It is important to note that because 

the sub-sampling approach yielded a relatively small group of cases (for example, approximately 

20%  at  the  DPS  labs),  the  five  death  penalty  cases  reviewed  do  not  necessarily  represent  all 

inmates  on  death  row  who  may  have  had  hair  microscopy  as  a  component  of  their  cases.  

 

17 

However, they do represent the team’s best efforts at prioritizing capital cases that appear on the 

list of cases collected to date within the framework of the sub-sampling approach. 

Along with the five death penalty cases, the team reviewed an additional 45 cases (two 

cases  involve  two  co-defendants  tried  jointly),  totaling  50  transcript  reviews.    No  notifiable 

errors  were  found  in  the  five  pending  death  penalty  cases  reviewed.    Of  the  45  reviewed  non-

pending death penalty cases, notifiable error was found in 22 cases and notification letters were 

sent to the interested parties.  A final report describing the review process and conclusions will 

be considered by the Commission during the first quarter of 2018. 

B.  DNA Mixture Interpretation Analysis 

1.  Background 

In  May  2015,  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  (FBI)  issued  a  notification  to 

laboratories  across  the  country  stating  it  had  identified  certain  errors  in  the  database  used  by 

laboratories  to  calculate  DNA  match  statistics  in  criminal  cases.    As  described  on  the  FSC’s 

website  here,  the  statistical  impact  of  those  errors  was  minimal  as  demonstrated  through 

empirical studies at the national and state level.   

In  an  abundance  of  caution,  Texas  laboratories  notified  prosecutors  they  would  re-

calculate  statistics  for  any  case  using  the  corrected  data.    Some  prosecutors  requested  new 

reports  reflecting  the  re-calculations,  particularly  for  cases  currently  scheduled  for  trial.    The 

reports confirmed the statistical insignificance of the FBI database errors. 

However, when the amended reports were issued some prosecutors noticed a significant 

difference  in  statistical  results  for  a  few  of  their  cases,  such  as  a  change  from  an  inclusion  or 

“cannot be excluded” result with an accompanying population statistic to an inconclusive result, 

or a major change in a population statistic.  When the affected prosecutors inquired how this type 

 

18 

of  change  could  be  possible  when  the  FBI  database  issues  were  supposed  to  be  statistically 

minimal, they were informed the changes were attributable not to the FBI database corrections 

but rather to changes in mixture interpretation protocols over time.   

While some variation in laboratory interpretation policies and protocols is acceptable and 

to  be  expected,  mixture  interpretation  protocols  in  years  past  may  not  have  adequately 

considered  certain  important  scientific  issues  affecting  interpretation,  such  as  allele  dropout, 

stutter,  allele  stacking,  allele  masking  and  other  stochastic  effects.    To  be  clear,  this  is  by  no 

means  isolated  to  Texas  but  rather  an  issue  in  laboratories  nationwide  and  it  does  not  impact 

every  laboratory  or  every  case  involving  DNA  analysis.    Some  cases  may  have  a  significantly 

changed statistic when reviewed, some may have minor and insignificant changes while others 

may have no changes at all. 

2.  Action Taken  

Over  the  past  two  years,  the  Commission  has  actively  engaged  with  stakeholders 

including representatives from the Texas District and County Attorney’s Association, the Texas 

Criminal  Defense  Lawyer’s  Association,  the  Office  of  the  Governor,  Office  of  the  Attorney 

General, the Texas Commission on Indigent Defense, the various law school innocence clinics, 

the  forensic  laboratories,  the  Center  for  the  Judiciary,  the  Criminal  Justice  Integrity  Unit  and 

others to ensure accurate and appropriate implementation of mixture interpretation principles and 

protocols, notification of potentially affected defendants, triage of casework and establishment of 

county resources for indigent defense in cases that may have been impacted.  The Commission 

has also sought and received guidance from the some of the best experts on DNA issues in the 

world. (See e.g., https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5007818/.)

3.   DNA Mixture Interpretation Case Review 

In light of the Commission’s findings related to mixture interpretation protocols that 

may  not  have  adequately  considered  certain  important  scientific  limitations,  such  as  allele 

dropout, stutter, allele stacking, allele masking and other stochastic effects, the Commission felt 

it prudent to initiate a statewide review of DNA mixture interpretation cases.   

a. Notification and Screening Process 

As  part  of  a  recommended  notification  process,  the  Commission  requested  all 

criminal DNA testing laboratories in the State provide DNA mixture lists of cases analyzed since 

the  inception  of  STR  testing  to  the  affected  prosecuting  agencies  for  review  and  notification 

where  appropriate.    With  CCA  Judge  Barbara  Hervey’s  assistance,  the  Commission  also 

published a notice in Texas prison libraries describing the DNA mixture interpretation issues and 

providing inmates with information on submitting their case for review and/or reanalysis. For a 

flowchart of the complete case review process and further details, please visit the following link.  

b. Case Review Status Update 

 

With  the  exception  of  Tarrant  and  Travis  counties,  which  are  managing  their  own 

reviews,  the  statewide  DNA  mixture  interpretation  case  review  is  currently  managed  by  Bob 

Wicoff,  Chief  of  the  Appellate  Division  of  the  Harris  County  Public  Defender’s  Office.    The 

work  is  100%  funded  by  a  grant  from  the  Texas  Commission  on  Indigent  Defense.    The 

approximate numbers (since the project’s start date of March 1, 2016) are as follows: 

Total requests for review:  

 

ases reviewed and closed:    

ases pending recalculation:   

 

 

 

2,800 

1,550 

150 

ases still in the process of being reviewed:  1,100

In  Tarrant  county,  a  total  of  284  notices  were  sent  to  defendants,  with  94  requests  for 

reviews received.  Attorneys were appointed on a wheel system for all requesting defendants.  Of 

the  87  currently  open  cases,  approximately  50%  are  pending  responses  from  defense  counsel, 

35%  are  pending  laboratory  review  and  the  remainder  are  waiting  for  re-testing  or  other 

resolution  by  attorneys.    Twenty  cases  have  been  closed  and  40  referrals  from  the  statewide 

mixture review team have also been closed.  

By  focusing  on  a  collaborative  approach  and  triaging  cases,  Texas  has  emerged  as  a 

leader  for  other  states  that  are  beginning  to  contend  with  similar  issues  in  DNA  mixture 

interpretation and corresponding case reviews. 

4. Austin Police Department DNA Section Audit Report and Recommendations  

 

In May 2016, in response to issues identified after reviewing laboratory protocols and a 

sample set of DNA mixture cases from the Austin Police Department Crime Lab’s DNA Section 

“APD”,  the  Commission  conducted  an  on-site  audit  at  APD.    The  audit  revealed  a  number  of 

concerns  that  led  laboratory  management  to  voluntarily  amend  its  scope  of  accreditation  and 

temporarily  suspend  forensic  DNA  analysis,  including  biology  screening.    The  laboratory  has 

been working over the last 18 months to address the concerns outlined in the Commission’s final 

audit  report.    In  the  interim,  the  City  of  Austin  entered  into  a  five-year  Memorandum  of 

Understanding  with  the  Texas  Department  of  Public  Safety  ("DPS")  providing  for  DPS  to 

manage  the  DNA  section  of  the  laboratory.    The  City  has  also  worked  collaboratively  with 

stakeholders to ensure notification and retroactive review of cases as appropriate.  Case reviews 

are  handled  through  a  legal  triage  process  and  sent  to  the  University  of  North  Texas  Health 

Science Center/Center for Human Identification for re-analysis on a pro bono basis. In addition, 

the Quattrone Center for the Fair Administration of Justice at the University of Pennsylvania law 

 

21 

22 

school ("Quattrone") has been retained by the City of Austin to conduct a thorough root cause 

analysis  of  the  issues  identified  during  the  Commission's  audit.    Quattrone  will  also  create  a 

report  for  stakeholders  outlining  best  practices  in  laboratory  organization,  culture  and 

management  to  assist  the  community  in  determining  the  best  possible  structure  for  the  DNA 

laboratory when the DPS MOU expires.  For a complete copy of the APD audit report, including

C.  Bite Mark Comparison Case Review 

1.  Background 

On February12, 2016, the Texas Forensic Science Commission published a report on bite 

mark comparison in response to a complaint filed by the national Innocence Project on behalf of 

Steven  Mark  Chaney. 2    The  Commission  made  two  threshold  observations  based  upon  its 

review:  1)  there  is  no  scientific  basis  for  stating  that  a  particular  patterned  injury  can  be 

associated to an individual’s dentition; and 2) there is no scientific basis for assigning probability 

or  statistical  weight  to  an  association,  regardless  of  whether  such  probability  or  weight  is 

expressed numerically (e.g., “one in a million”).  The Commission further concluded:  1) at the 

current time, the overwhelming majority of existing research does not support the contention that 

bite mark comparison can be performed reliably and accurately from examiner to examiner due 

to  the  subjective  nature  of  the  analysis;  and  2)  in  addition  to  the  foundational  scientific  and 

research  issues,  there  are  significant  quality  control  and  infrastructure  differences  between 

forensic  odontology  and  other  patterned  and  impression  disciplines  performed  in  accredited 

                                                 
2 The Commission's report may be accessed at the following link: http://www.fsc.texas.gov/blog/2016-04-18/fsc-

laboratories.    Finally,  the  Commission  recommended  bite  mark  comparison  evidence  not  be 

admitted in criminal cases in Texas unless and until the following are established: 1) criteria for 

identifying  when  a  patterned  injury  constitutes  a  human  bite  mark;  2)  criteria  for  identifying 

when a human bite mark was made by an adult versus a child; and 3) rigorous and appropriately 

validated proficiency testing.3 

As  part  of  its  findings,  the  Commission  recommended  a  case  review  including  a 

multidisciplinary  team  of  forensic  odontologists  and  attorneys  to  review  criminal  cases 

potentially  impacted  by  bite  mark  comparison  evidence.    In  the  months  following  the  report's 

release, the Commission worked with the American Board of Forensic Odontology (ABFO) and 

stakeholders in the legal community to form a bite mark comparison review team to conduct a 

retroactive  review  of  cases.    The  team  was  structured  in  a  similar  manner  to  a  previous  team 

convened  to  conduct  a  review  of  Texas  microscopic  hair  comparison  cases,  consisting  of  four 

subject  matter  experts,  two  defense  attorneys  and  two  prosecutors.    On  January  27,  2017,  the 

team  held  its  first  meeting.    The  team  also  held  subsequent  meetings  on  March  10,  2017  and 

September 8, 2017.  All meetings were open to the public.   

2. 

Case Review Process 

Because there is no central repository of bite mark cases, compiling a comprehensive list 

of Texas bite mark cases was not an easy task.  Additionally, because bite mark comparison is 

typically  performed  outside  a  crime  laboratory  setting  by  dentists  in  private  practice,  a 

multifaceted  approach  is  necessary  to  identify  potentially  affected  cases.    While  forensic 

laboratories  have  LIMS  systems  which  enable  them  to  track  and  search  for  cases,  bite  mark 

comparison  cases  are  typically  performed  by  individual  forensic  odontologists  who  maintain 

                                                 
3 See also Att. Gen. Op. KP-0127 for discussion of admissibility of bite mark comparison evidence and Commission's discretion 
under articles 38.01 and 38.35 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. 
 

 

23 

their own case file tracking systems.  Indeed, though Commission staff made a good faith effort 

to  identify  cases,  there  is  no  way  to  guarantee  that  cases  could  not  have  been  missed  that  the 

team would review if provided the opportunity.   

Despite these challenges, staff had several helpful resources to consult at the outset of the 

project.  First, staff referred to the list of Texas convictions referenced in the textbook, Forensic 

Dentistry, Second Edition, edited by Drs. Senn and Stimson.  This textbook contains an appendix 

entitled “U.S. Federal and State Court Cases of Interest in Forensic Odontology,” that provides 

chronological case citations.  After a close review, 22 Texas convictions were identified from the 

appendix. 

In addition, the national Innocence Project also provided the Commission with a list of 

Texas  bite  mark  comparison  convictions  of  which  they  were  aware.    This  list  provided  an 

additional six cases that were not listed in the Forensic Dentistry textbook. 

In an attempt to fill any gaps left by the first two lists, staff generated a list of cases using 

a LexisNexis search.  That search returned a total of 221 appellate decisions requiring a careful 

review  to  determine  relevancy.    Once  this  review  was  completed,  an  additional  six  cases  were 

added to the master list. 

In  discussions  with  the  American  Board  of  Forensic  Odontology  (ABFO)  leadership, 

staff learned that a handful of retired ABFO Diplomates had provided their personal case files to 

the  archives  at  the  National  Museum  of  Health  and  Medicine  (“NMHM”)  in  Silver  Spring, 

Maryland.  Staff contacted the museum for assistance in accessing information concerning Texas 

casework stored there.  The Museum responded with short list providing very little information 

due  to  the  limited  nature  of  the  archived  information.    The  NMHM  information  added  one 

 

24 

potential additional case to the list but ultimately the archived files were too limited to provide 

for extensive case identification. 

The  Harris  County  District  Attorney’s  Office  Conviction  Integrity  Unit  provided  the 

Commission  with  an  additional  two  cases  to  add  to  the  review.  An  additional  two  cases  were 

provided  by  Dr.  Paula  Brumit.    Upon  review,  it  was  determined  that  comparisons  were  not 

ultimately made in those cases.  The Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office also provided a 

list of cases submitted by Dr. Roger Metcalf. 

Ultimately, staff identified 36 cases were for initial screening by the team.  The initial list 

of  cases  compiled  through  the  process  outlined  above  was  shortened  when  review  parameters 

were set and further scrutiny was applied to the case facts.  Several cases were eliminated from 

the list at the outset because they did not involve an identification, or because the bite marks in 

question were inflicted by animals.  It should also be noted that the list of 36 cases includes the 

Steven Mark Chaney case along with two cases where the defendants were later exonerated as a 

result of DNA evidence, as discussed below. 

 

3. 

Case Review Criteria 

As a threshold matter, it is critical to note that the review team's work was limited to the 

review of testimony.  The team did not have access to the evidence in any case and thus did not 

make an assessment of the quality of the bite mark comparison performed.  The team limited its 

analysis to whether the testimony was supportable or not.   

The criteria for the transcript review were developed based on two main factors: (1) the 

Commission's  previous  experience  in  developing  criteria  for  the  microscopic  hair  comparison 

review; and (2) a common desire to ensure that any retroactive case review makes prudent and 

effective  use  of  limited  state  resources.    Thus,  team  members  and  Commissioners  agreed  to 

 

25 

refrain  from  reviewing  cases  solely  for  the  purpose  of  identifying  overstatements  in  testimony 

regardless  of  whether  there  could  be  any  conceivable  argument  that  the  erroneous  bite  mark 

testimony impacted the case outcome.  Instead, team members focused resources solely on those 

cases for which the defendant could have a plausible argument that flawed bite mark comparison 

testimony may constitute grounds for legal relief.  

Initial Screening Criteria 

The  first  question  answered  by  the  team  in  approaching  a  given  case  was  whether  it 

contained a bite mark comparison that included a positive, probative association.  The term was 

defined as follows:   

The  term  “positive,  probative  association”  means  the  expert  expressed  an 
association of any kind between the defendant’s dentition and the patterned injury 
on  human  skin,  and  that  association  provided  information,  regardless  of 
significance, about the suspect’s connection to a criminal act. 

f  the  answer  to  this  question  was  "no,"  the  team  stopped  the  review.    If  the 

  I

answer was "yes," the team proceeded to ask the following questions:  

1.  Was  there  a  high-quality  DNA  profile  or  profile(s)  connecting  the  Defendant  to 

the crime?4 
 

2.  Were there multiple additional overwhelmingly inculpatory case facts in the form 
of  physical  evidence  and/or  witness  testimony  such  that  an  alternative  theory, 
explanation or suspect is not plausible? 

It  is  important  to  note  the  team  answered  the  second  question  affirmatively  only  when 

non-bite  mark  related  case  facts  were  abundantly  clear  and  overwhelming.    Members  always 

erred on the side of including cases.  

Transcript Review Questions 

                                                 
4 By “high quality,” we are referring to single source profile(s), a simple two-person mixture, or a mixture for which 
a major contributor may be deduced. 

26 

 

 

If the review team answered "no" to the two preliminary screening criteria, members then 

proceeded  to  review  the  case  transcript.    After  reading  the  transcript,  the  team  answered  the 

following questions:   

1.  Did the testimony contain a statement of identification? 

2.  Did the testimony assign probability or statistical weight? 

3.  Did  the  testimony  contain  any  other  potentially  misleading  statements  or 

inferences? 
 

If  the  answer  to  any  of  these  questions  was  "yes,"  the  panel  recommended  to  the  full 

Commission that notification be provided to the following potentially impacted individuals:  

•  Defendant and/or last known counsel;5  

  Elected District Attorney for county in which case was prosecuted;  

  Conviction Integrity Unit if one exists in jurisdiction; 

  Court with original jurisdiction over trial;  

  Texas publicly funded innocence clinics;  

  President of ABFO;  

  Forensic odontologist who provided testimony (unless deceased). 

4. 

Case Review Results 

Commission  staff  identified  36  total  cases  for  possible  transcript  review.    Of  these,  six 

cases  were  prescreened  out  by  the  staff  (three  of  the  cases  were  Washington,  Williams  and 

Chaney; two cases had no bite mark testimony; one case was a 1954 robbery involving bite mark 

impressions in cheese (Doyle v. State, 159 Tex. Crim. 310, 263 S.W.2d 779 (1954)).  The team 

screened the remaining 30 cases and removed another 21 from transcript review after analyzing 

the cases under the initial screening criteria.  The team reviewed five transcripts at its March 10,

2017 meeting and recommended notification for four of the five cases.  Of the cases for which 

notification  was  recommended,  three  resulted  in  the  team  answering  all  review  questions 

affirmatively.    The  fourth  case  involved  two  experts  providing  testimony  with  the  team 

answering  all  three  review  questions  affirmatively  for  the  first  expert  and  only  the  first  review 

question affirmatively for the second expert.   

At  its  September  8,  2017  meeting,  the  team  reviewed  the  remaining  four  transcripts  at 

and  recommended  notification  for  three  cases.  Of  these  three  cases,  one  involved  the  team 

answering  the  first  and  third  review  questions  affirmatively  while  the  team  answered  all  three 

review questions affirmatively in the other two cases. It is also important to note that one case 

involved  the  team  answering  all  three  review  questions  affirmatively  for  two  forensic 

odontologists. 

D. Crime Scene Investigation 

At  its  May  26,  2017  meeting,  the  Commission  reviewed  a  self-disclosure  from  the 

Houston Forensic Science Center ("HFSC") describing issues in its Crime Scene Unit including 

deficiencies  in  documentation,  collection,  recovery  and  preservation  of  evidence  at  multiple 

crime scenes that led to the removal of a crime scene investigator and a technical supervisor and 

voted  to  form  an  investigative  panel  consisting  of  Commissioners  Mr.  Pat  Johnson,  Mr.  Jarvis 

Parsons  and  Dr.  Jasmine  Drake.  The  self-disclosure  highlights  issues  key  to  the  integrity  and 

reliability of crime scene investigation that are not limited to HFSC, but may be present in other 

Crime Scene Unit's in Texas and nationwide. Because crime scene investigation is exempt from 

accreditation requirements in Texas, the Commission may only investigate the disclosure for the 

limited purpose of issuing best practices and other recommendations.  As described in paragraph 

III C above, the Tim Cole Exoneration Review Commission has recommended a study of crime 

 

 

 

28 

scene investigation practices in Texas.  Investigative panel members plan to meet in the coming 

weeks and develop an outline for a plan for the investigation that highlights key areas of concern.  

Commissioners expect to issue a report in the matter before December 2018. 

E. Blood Stain Pattern Analysis 

Blood stain pattern analysis is currently neither subject to accreditation requirements nor 

exempt  from  accreditation  requirements  in  Texas.    However,  blood  stain  pattern  analysis 

evidence is being used in Texas criminal cases and by a variety of blood stain pattern analysis 

practitioners—at  least  one  from  an  accredited  laboratory,  some  law  enforcement  agencies, 

including  DPS,  and  some  analysts  in  private  practice.      Commissioners  discussed  the  issue  of 

whether  blood  stain  pattern  analysis  should  be  subject  to  accreditation  requirements  at  its 

November  3,  2017  meeting  and  voted  to  conduct  a  hearing  on  the  state  of  blood  stain  pattern 

analysis  and  how  it  is  used  in  Texas  criminal  cases.    Commissioners  and  staff  have  invited 

practitioners  from  different  backgrounds  to  attend  the  hearing,  provide  information  on  their 

practices  and  to  explain  the  scientific  underpinnings  of  the  discipline.    Commissioners  plan  to 

hold the hearing in Austin on January 22, 2018.       

VIII.  Forensic Development Activities 

A. Conferences/Presentations 

Lynn  Garcia,  the  Commission's  General  Counsel,  represents  the  Commission  at 

professional meetings and conferences regarding forensic science in Texas and nationally.  For 

example,  in  July  2017,  she  was  a  plenary  speaker  for  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and 

Technology  International  Forensic  Error  Symposium.    The  symposium  is  an  effort  by  forensic 

scientists to modernize the industry's approach to managing error like industries such as aviation 

and  healthcare  have  done  in  recent  years.    Garcia  described  the  Texas  approach  to  managing 

 

 

 

  

 

29 

forensic error, the challenges that are presented by the adversarial nature of our criminal justice 

system  and  the  core  values  that  have  allowed  Texas  to  emerge  as  a  national  leader  in  forensic 

reform. 

The Commission's Senior Scientific Advisor, Jody Koehler, was invited to present at the 

Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers 15th Annual Forensics Program in Houston, December 14-15, 

2017.  Koehler will give a presentation on current issues in forensic science. 

B. International Interest/Education for the Texas Forensic Oversight Model 

 

In  the  past  year,  the  Commission  has  seen  international  interest  in  the  Texas  model  of 

forensic oversight.  On September 19, 2017, a group of Japanese attorneys and scientists traveled 

to Austin to meet with Commissioner Pat Johnson, Commission General Counsel Lynn Garcia, 

Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  Judge  Barbara  Hervey  and  others  to  discuss  the  Texas  model  of 

forensic  oversight. 

  On  December  9,  2017,  members  of  the  Commission  and  staff, 

representatives from DPS, and Court of Criminal Appeals Judge Barbara Hervey will meet with 

delegates working on a forensic reform project for Kazakhstan's Ministry of Justice.  DPS also 

plans to give the delegates a tour of its lab facilities in Austin that day.  

IX.  Forensics at the National Level 

 

A.  National Commission on Forensic Science Expiration   

On  April  23,  2017,  the  United  States  Attorney  General's  National  Commission  on 

Forensic  Science's  ("NCFS")  charter  expired  and  was  not  renewed  by  the  current  Attorney 

General.  The NCFS summarized its accomplishments and identified work to be addressed going 

forward in a document titled Reflecting Back – Looking Toward the Future.    The NCFS was 

composed  of  approximately  30  members,  including  practitioners,  researchers,  prosecutors, 

defense attorneys, judges and other members of the criminal justice community.  The NCFS was 

 

 

30 

responsible for providing guidance concerning the intersection between forensic science and the 

courtroom, as well as developing policy recommendations.  The Attorney General has continued 

efforts to improve forensic science through an internal Department of Justice working group on 

the subject. 

B.  Organization of Scientific Area Committees 

 

In  February  2014,  the  National  Institute  for  Standards  and  Technology  and  the  U.S. 

Department  of  Justice  announced  the  formation  of  the  Organization  of  Scientific  Area 

Committees (“OSAC”) to strengthen forensic science standards in the United States.  The OSAC 

is a collaborative body of 500 forensic science practitioners and other stakeholders tasked with 

supporting the development and promulgation of forensic science standards and guidelines, and 

to  ensure  a  sufficient  scientific  basis  exists  for  each  forensic  discipline.    Many  representatives 

from  Texas  have  been  selected  for  OSAC  subcommittees.    Commission  member  Dr.  Sarah 

Kerrigan  is  a  member  of  the  Forensic  Science  Standards  Board,  the  governing  body  for  the 

OSAC.    For  a  full  list  of  members  and  more  detailed  information  related  to  the  roles  of  the 

various subcommittees click the following link http://www.nist.gov/forensics/osacroles.cfm. 

C. Report by the President's Council on Science and Technology 

In September  2016, the  PCAST released a  report entitled  Forensic  Science  in  Criminal 

Courts:  Ensuring  Scientific  Validity  of  Feature-Comparison  Methods.    The  report  described 

research needs and progress made in a number of feature-comparison methods, echoing many of 

the concepts expressed in the 2009 NAS Report.  The authors also referenced developments in 

Texas with respect to both bite mark comparison and DNA mixtures.  

31 

   

 

D.  NIJ Report on State Forensic Science Commissions 

 

In  November  2016,  the  National  Institute  of  Justice  issued  a  report  on  state  forensic 

science  commissions  in  which  the  Texas  Forensic  Science  Commission's  activities  are 

highlighted.    The  report  describes  how  state  forensic  science  commissions  may  contribute  to 

forensic  improvement  through  oversight  and  coordination  of  forensic  science  resources  and 

provides  information  for  states  wishing  to  create  and  maintain  a  state  forensic  science 

commission.  The  report,  while  taking  into  account  the  differences  that  exist  among  states 

including  governance,  culture,  statutes  and  crime  lab  systems,  provides  an  overview  of 

considerations in planning for and developing a state-level forensic commission.  A copy of the 

report can be accessed here. 

X. Additional Items Required in Annual Report by Statute 

A. Accreditation Updates 

As  part  of  its  statutory  annual  report  requirement,  the  Commission  must  describe  any 

forensic method or methodology the Commission designates as part of the accreditation process 

for crime laboratories.6  In the past year, the Commission has considered whether to exempt or 

subject to the accreditation process several forensic disciplines.  In April 2017, the Commission 

adopted a rule to exempt from the accreditation process forensic odontology used for purposes of 

human identification or age assessment, not to include bite mark comparison related to patterned 

injuries.    Also  in  April  2017,  the  Commission  adopted  a  rule  removing  the  forensic  discipline 

forensic  hypnosis  from  being  subject  to  accreditation  requirements  in  Texas,  because  the 

discipline does not involve a test on physical evidence, and therefore does not meet the definition 

of “forensic analysis” subject to the Commission's jurisdiction.  

                                                 
6 TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art 38.01 §8(2). 

 

32 

At  its  May  26,  2017  meeting,  Commissioners  voted  to  subject  "footwear  and  tire  tread 

comparison"  and  "analysis  of  nucleic  acids  other  than  human  DNA"  to  accreditation 

requirements.  For both of these forensic disciplines, the administrative rules were unclear as to 

whether  the  disciplines  were  subject  to  accreditation  requirements  as  a  subcategory  of  another 

forensic discipline such as Forensic Biology for analysis of nucleic acids other than human DNA 

and Materials (Trace) for footwear and tire tread comparison, because they were not expressly 

mentioned.  

At  its November  3,  2017  meeting,  Commissioners  voted  to  conduct  a  hearing  to  assess 

the  state  of  blood  stain  pattern  analysis  in  Texas.    Currently,  blood  stain  pattern  analysis  is 

neither subject to accreditation requirements nor exempt from accreditation requirements.  The 

hearing  will  feature  experts  in  the  field  of  blood  stain  pattern  analysis  both  in  Texas  and 

nationally.    Stakeholders  in  the  criminal  justice  community  including  prosecutors,  defense 

attorneys and judges will also provide input on the issue.  Experts will be asked to describe the 

types  of  analyses  they  perform  including  the  scientific  foundation  for  the  discipline.  The 

Commission plans to make a recommendation about whether the discipline should be subject to 

accreditation requirements in 2018. 

B. Forensic Analysis Definition 

In addition to the explanation of accreditation changes, the Commission's enabling statute 

also  requires  a  report  on  recommendations  for  “best  practices  concerning  the  definition  of 

‘forensic  analysis’  provided  by  statute  or  by  rule.”  each  year. 7    The  Commission  has  not 

identified  any  recommendations  regarding  the  definition  of  “forensic  analysis.” 

  The 

Commission may revise its conclusion on this issue as necessary to ensure the advancement of 

forensic science in Texas. 
                                                 
7 Id. at §8(3). 

 

33 

XI. Open Records Requests and Open Meetings 

Pursuant  to  Senate  Bill  1124  and  the  Commission's  administrative  attachment  to  the 

Office  of  Court  Administration,  the  Commission  is  now  part  of  the  judicial  branch  of 

government  and  must  comply  with  judicial  rules  related  to  information  requests  and  open 

meetings.    Because  the  Commission  is  no  longer  a  governmental  body  under  the  Public 

Information Act and is now a judicial agency, the Commission's records are considered judicial 

records and the Commission must comply with Rule 12.6 – Access to Judicial Records.8   Much 

of  the  process  is  the  same  as  with  the  Public  Information  Act.    A  member  of  the  public  must 

submit  a  request  in  writing.  The  Commission  will  continue  to  accept  requests  via  email  at 

info@fsc.texas.gov,  via  facsimile  at  1(888)  305-2432,  or  via  regular  U.S.  mail.    In  accordance 

with Rule 12, the Commission must respond within 14 days of the receipt of any records request.   

With regard to the Open Meetings Act, the Commission will continue to comply with the 

Act in posting notice in the form of an agenda for each Commission meeting at least 7 days prior 

to  each  meeting.    If  you  have  any  questions  about  meetings  or  how  to  submit  a  request  to  the 

Commission, please feel free to contact our office directly at (512) 936-0770.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
