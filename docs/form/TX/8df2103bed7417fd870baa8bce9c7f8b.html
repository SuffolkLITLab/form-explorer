════════════════════ 
Misc. Docket No. 15-9077 
════════════════════ 
 
════════════════════════════════════════════════════ 
ORDER APPROVING AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLE XII OF  
THE STATE BAR RULES 
════════════════════════════════════════════════════ 

RDERED that: 

Article  XII,  Section  4  of  the  State  Bar  Rules  is  amended  as  follows.  The  amendments 
remove  the  MCLE  exemption  for  an  emeritus  member.  Emeritus  member  is  defined  in 
Texas Government Code section 81.052(e). 

For compliance years that begin on or after June 1, 2016, an emeritus member must fulfill 
the MCLE requirements applicable to all members of the State Bar, unless the member is 
eligible  for  another  exemption.  Accredited  continuing  legal  education  and  self-study 
completed within the 12 months immediately preceding the first compliance year for an 
emeritus member that begins on or after June 1, 2016, may be used to meet the MCLE 
requirements for that initial compliance year. 

These amendments may be changed in response to public comments received by July 31, 
2015.  Any  interested  party  may  submit  written  comments  to  Rules  Attorney  Martha 
Newton at rulescomments@txcourts.gov.  

The Clerk is directed to: 

file a copy of this order with the Secretary of State; 

cause a copy of this order to be mailed to each registered member of the  
State Bar of Texas by publication in the Texas Bar Journal; 

 

send a copy of this order to each elected member of the Legislature; and 

submit a copy of the order for publication in the Texas Register.

MINIMUM CONTINUING LEGAL EDUCATION RULES 

(Article XII, State Bar Rules) 

Section 4.  Accreditation 

(A) 

The Committee shall develop criteria for the accreditation of continuing legal education 

activities and shall  designate  the number of  hours  to be  earned  by participation in such 

activities, as  approved  by  the Committee.   In order for  an  activity to  be accredited, the 

subject  matter  must  directly  relate  to  legal  subjects  and  the  legal  profession,  including 

professional responsibility, legal ethics, or law practice management.  The Committee may, 

in appropriate cases, extend accreditation to qualified activities that have already occurred.  

The Committee shall not extend credit to activities completed in the ordinary course of the 

practice of law, in the performance of regular employment, as a volunteer service to clients 

or  the  general  public,  as  a  volunteer  service  to  government  entities,  or  in  a  member’s 

regular duties  on a  committee, section or division of any bar  related  organization.  The 

Committee may extend accredited status, subject to periodic review, to a qualified sponsor 

for its overall continuing legal education curriculum.  No examinations shall be required.  

B) 

Self-study credit may be given for individual viewing or listening to audio, video, or digital 

media;  reading  written  material;  attending  organized  in-office  educational  programs;  or 

other activities approved by the Committee.  No more than three hours of credit may be 

given during a compliance year for self-study activities.  Time spent viewing or listening 

to  audio,  video,  or  digital  media  as  part  of  an  organized  CLE  activity  approved  by  the 

Committee counts as conventional continuing legal education and is not subject to the self-

study limitation.

(C) 

Credit  may  be  earned  through  teaching  or  participating  in  an  accredited  CLE  activity.  

Credit shall be granted for preparation time and presentation time, including preparation 

credit for repeated presentations. 

D) 

Credit  may  be  earned  through  legal  research-based  writing  upon  application  to  the 

Committee provided the activity (1) produced material published or to be published in the 

form  of  an  article,  chapter,  or  book  written,  in  whole  or  in  part,  by  the  applicant;  (2) 

contributed  substantially  to  the  continuing  legal  education  of  the  applicant  and  other 

attorneys; and (3) is not done in the ordinary course of the practice of law, the performance 

of regular employment, or as a service to clients. 

E) 

The  Committee  may,  in  appropriate  cases  charge  a  reasonable  fee  to  the  sponsor  for 

accrediting CLE activities. 

F) 

A member who holds a full-time faculty position in any law school which is approved by 

the American Bar Association may be credited as fulfilling the requirements of this article, 

except  as  to  the  minimum  requirements  for  CLE  in  legal  ethics  and  professional 

responsibility.  A member who holds a part-time faculty position in any such law school 

may claim participatory credit for the actual hours of class instruction time not to exceed 

12 hours per compliance year, except as to the minimum requirements for CLE in legal 

ethics and professional responsibility. 

G) 

The  Committee  shall  grant  exemption  from  this  Article  to  any  emeritus  member  of  the 

State Bar of Texas.  (Emeritus as defined by the State Bar Act, Section 81.052 (e)). 

HG)  Credit to meet the minimum educational requirement shall be extended to attorneys who 

are  members  of  the  Senate  and  House  of  Representatives  of  present  and  future  United 

States and Texas Legislatures for each regular session in which the attorney member shall 

serve.

(IH)  No credit shall be given for activities directed primarily to persons preparing for admission 

to practice law. 

JI) 

Credit, not to exceed 30 hours in any compliance year, may be earned for attending a law 

school class after admission to practice in Texas provided (1) that the member officially 

registered for the class with the law school; and (2) that the member completed the course 

as  required  by  the  terms  of  registration.    Credit  for  approved  attendance  at  law  school 

classes shall be for the actual number of hours of class instruction time the member is in 

attendance at the law school course.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
