      <pre>How Texas Court Rules Are Made 
By Nathan L. Hecht, Martha G. Newton, 
and Kennon L. Wooten1 
 

Introduction 

I. 
 

that 

stem 

from 

The Supreme Court of Texas does not just 
decide  cases.  It  also  has  vast  administrative 
responsibilities 
its 
constitutional  and  statutory  control  of  the 
judicial branch and its responsibility for the 
administration of justice.2 The Chief Justice 
is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  Court 
“executes 
[its] 
administrative duties and responsibilities.”3  

implements 

and 

Rulemaking  is  just  one  of  the  Court’s 
many  administrative  functions,  but  it  is 
arguably  the  function  that  has  the  greatest 
impact on our courts and those who use them. 
This  paper  focuses  on  the  procedure  for 
making the rules that govern judges, lawyers, 
and  litigation  day-to-day,  such  as  rules  of 
procedure and evidence. But the Court makes 
many other sets of rules that most lawyers are 
unaware  of—rules  that  govern  the  internal 
operation  of  judicial  entities  such  as  the 
Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals,  rules  that 
regulate 
as 
court  professionals 
interpreters  and  court  reporters,  and  many 
more.  The  process  for  making  those  lesser 
known rules is similar to the process outlined 
here.

1  Nathan  L.  Hecht  is  the  27th  Chief  Justice  of  the 
Supreme Court of Texas. He has served as the Court’s 
liaison to the Supreme Court Advisory Committee and 
has  overseen  the  Court’s  rulemaking  projects  since 
1989.  Martha  G.  Newton  is  the  Court’s  eighth  rules 
attorney  and  has  served  in  that  position  since 
September  2013.  Kennon  L.  Wooten,  a  litigation 
partner at Scott Douglass & McConnico, served as the 
Court’s  sixth  rules  attorney  from  2008-2011.  She  is 
currently the vice-chair of the State Bar Court Rules 
Committee  and  will  become  the  chair  of  that 
committee in June 2016. 

justice 

justices  participate 

Chief  Justice  Nathan  L.  Hecht  has  been 
the 
the  Court’s 
in  charge  of 
rulemaking  projects  since  1989.  Other 
justices  are  actively  involved  in  rulemaking 
projects related to their liaison assignments,4 
and  all 
in  deciding 
whether  to  pursue  a  rules  project  and  the 
content of the rules issued by the Court. Since 
1993, the Court has also had a rules attorney 
who  shepherds 
the  Court’s  rulemaking 
projects through the process described in this 
paper and who serves as a liaison between the 
Court,  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  various 
groups  involved  in  the  rulemaking  process, 
the bar, and the public, on the other. 

 

Good  court  rules  are  crucial  to  the 
efficient administration of justice. For Texas 
to have the best rules possible, lawyers must 
know how the rules are made and how they 
can  participate  in  the  process.  This  paper 
starts at the beginning—the Court’s authority 
to  make  rules  in  the  first  place—and  then 
outlines  the  Court’s  procedure  for  making 
most  court  rules.  The  last  section  addresses 
rules resources that are available online and 
how the Court’s rules attorney can help you. 
 

II.  The Supreme Court’s Authority to 

Promulgate Rules 

 

Today  the  Supreme  Court  has  broad 
constitutional  and  statutory  authority  to 
promulgate procedural rules for civil actions 
and administrative rules for all Texas courts.

Chapter 74 of the Government Code—the 
Court  Administration  Act—defines 
the 
administrative  role  of  the  Court.  Section 
74.024 authorizes the Court to “adopt rules of 
administration setting policies and guidelines 
necessary or desirable for the operation and 
management of the court system and for the 
efficient administration of justice.”9 The only 
statutory restriction on the Court’s power to 
make rules of administration is that the Court 
must  “request  the  advice  of  the  court  of 
rules 
criminal  appeals  before  adopting 
affecting 
the  administration  of  criminal 
justice.”10

aspects  of  the  Texas  judicial  system.  The

1.  Administration  of  Justice  and  the 

 

Judicial Branch 

 

Article  V  of  the  Texas  Constitution 
makes the Court “responsible for the efficient 
administration  of  the  judicial  branch”  and 
states that the Court “shall promulgate rules 
of administration . . . as may be necessary for 
the  efficient  and  uniform  administration  of 
in  various  courts.”7  The  only 
justice 
constitutional  restriction  on 
the  Court’s 
power to make rules of administration is that 
the rules must “not [be] inconsistent with the 
laws of the state.”8 

                                                 
5 The history comes from a 1997 paper by Nathan L. 
Hecht  &  E.  Lee  Parsley  titled  Procedural  Reform: 
Whence and Whither. An excerpt of the paper, which 
was  updated  by 
then-rules  attorney  Robert  H. 
Pemberton in 1998, is posted on the Court’s website. 
See  Texas  Court  Rules:  History  and  Process, 
http://www.txcourts.gov/rules-forms/rules-
standards/texas-court-rules-history-process.aspx.  
6  See  TEX.  CONST.  art.  II,  §  1  (“The  powers  of  the 
Government of the State of Texas shall be divided into 
three  distinct  departments . . . . [N]o  person,  or 
collection  of  persons,  being  of  one  of 
these 
departments,  shall  exercise  any  power  properly 
attached to either of the others, except in the instances 
herein  expressly  permitted.”).  Eichelberger  v. 
Eichelberger,  582  S.W.2d  395,  398-99  &  n.1  (Tex. 
1979),  contains  a  robust  discussion  of  the  Court’s

statute  requires  that  the  Court  announce  its 
use of this power by filing with the secretary 
of state a list of each law that is repealed or 
modified.”19  The  “list  has  the  same  weight 
and effect as a decision of the court.”20 The 
Court  has  exercised  its  power  to  repeal  a 
statute sparingly.21 
 

3.  Rules  Governing  Lawyers  and  the 

State Bar 

 

the  Court 

The  State  Bar  Rules  were 

initially 
adopted  in  1983  “in  aid  of  the  Court’s 
inherent  power  to  regulate  the  practice  of 
law.”22  In  1987,  the  legislature  passed  the 
State  Bar  Act.23  Government  Code  section 
81.024  authorizes 
to  “adopt 
rules . . . for the operation, maintenance, and 
conduct of the state bar and the discipline of 
its members”24 but further requires that rules 
adopted  “under 
first 
approved  in  a  referendum  of  State  Bar 
members.25 Historically, the Court and State 
Bar  have  conducted  referenda  when  the 
amendments  would  make 
proposed 
the  Rules  of

substantive  changes

Professional  Conduct  or

21  The  Court  exercised  its  section  22.004(c)  power 
twice in 1998. See Misc. Docket No. 98-9043 (Feb. 25, 
1998) (Final Approval of Revisions to the Texas Rules 
of Evidence) (repealing TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE 
§ 611.006(a)(6) insofar as it conflicts with Texas Rule 
of Evidence 510); Misc. Docket No. 98-9196 (Nov. 9, 
1998) (Final Approval of Revisions to the Texas Rules 
of  Civil  Procedure)  (repealing  TEX.  BUS.  &  COMM. 
CODE § 17.57 insofar as it conflicts with Texas Rule 
of  Civil  Procedure  176.3(a)).  The  Court  has  not 
exercised its section 22.004(c) power since then.

2.  Practice  and  Procedure  in  Civil 

Actions 

 

Article V of the constitution also directs 
the  Court  to  “promulgate  rules  of  civil 
procedure for all courts not inconsistent with 
the laws of the state as may be necessary for 
the  efficient  and  uniform  administration  of 
justice  in  the  various  courts.”13  Likewise, 
Government Code section 22.004 authorizes 
the  Court  to  “promulgate  a  specific  rule  or 
rules of civil procedure”14 and states that the 
Court  has  “full  rulemaking  power”  in  civil 
practice and procedure.15  

 

to 

overturn 

Section  22.004  gives  the  legislature  the 
power 
Court-approved 
procedural rules.16 It has never actually done 
so, but the legislature has proactively enacted 
statutes  that  prescribe  procedural  rules  and 
expressly  prohibit  the  Court  from  changing 
them.17

Yet section 22.004 also grants the Court 
the  authority, 
to 
through 
“repeal[]  all  conflicting  laws  and  parts  of 
laws  governing  practice  and  procedure  in 
civil  actions,”  so  that  the  Court  has  “full 
rulemaking  power  in  civil  actions.”18  The

Appeals’ Rulemaking Authority 

 

 

to 

In  contrast 

the  broad  authority 
expressly granted to the Supreme Court, the 
Court  of  Criminal  Appeals’  constitutional 
and statutory rulemaking authority is limited. 
The only constitutional reference to the Court 
of Criminal Appeals’ rulemaking authority is 
Article  V,  Section  31’s  statement  that  the 
“legislature  may  delegate  to  the  Supreme 
Court  or  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  the 
power to promulgate such other rules as may 
be  prescribed  by  law  or  this  Constitution, 
subject to such limitations and procedures as 

that have no basis in law or fact on motion and without 
evidence.”). 
32 See id. § 22.004(h) (“The supreme court shall adopt 
rules  to  promote  the  prompt,  efficient,  and  cost-
effective resolution of civil actions.”). 
33  See  id.  §  22A.004(b)  (“The  supreme  court  may 
adopt rules for the operation of a special three-judge 
district court convened under this chapter and for the 
procedures of the court.”). 
34  See  TEX.  FAM.  CODE  §  33.003(l)  (“The  supreme 
court may adopt rules to permit confidential docketing 
of  an  application  under  this  section.”);  §  33.003(m) 
(“The  clerk  of  the  supreme  court  shall  prescribe  the 
application  form  to  be  used  by  the  minor  filing  an 
application under this section.”). 
35  See  TEX.  GOV’T  CODE  §  152.101  (“The  supreme 
court  may  adopt  rules  consistent  with  this  subtitle, 
including 
certification, 
governing 
registration, 
licensing,  and  conduct  of  persons 
regulated under this subtitle.”). 

rules 

the 

Disciplinary  Procedure.26  The  Court  has 
frequently used its inherent power to regulate 
the practice of law and its constitutional and 
statutory 
administration-of-justice 
rulemaking  authority  to  amend,  without  a 
referendum, provisions of the State Bar rules 
relating to Bar administration.27 

hapter  82  of  the  Government  Code 
governs  the  licensing  of  attorneys.  It  states 
that  only  the  Court  “may  issue  licenses  to 
practice law in this state”28 and authorizes the 
Court  to  “adopt  rules  on  eligibility  for 
examination for a license to practice law and 
on  the  manner  in  which  the  examination  is 
conducted,”29  as  well  as  other 
rules 
“necessary to administer its functions.”30 

.  Miscellaneous  Rules  Directed  by 

the Legislature 

inally, the legislature has often directed 
the  Court,  through  legislation,  to  make 
certain kinds of rules. The subject matter of 
legislatively directed rules can vary greatly. 
Some examples include:  
 

the dismissal of baseless causes of action 
(TRCP 91a);31 

                                                 
26  Since  1993,  the  Court  and  the  State  Bar  have 
conducted  five  referenda  to  amend  the  Rules  of 
Professional  Conduct  or  the  Rules  of  Disciplinary 
Procedure.  Only  two  of  those  referenda  passed.  See 
Sunset  Advisory  Commission  Staff  Report  on  the 
State Bar of Texas for the 85th Legislature 15 (2016-
2017), https://www.sunset.texas.gov/reviews-and-
reports/agencies/state-bar-texas  (last  visited  May  11, 
2016).

IV.  The Supreme Court’s Rulemaking 

Process 

 

 

Except  for  statutory  provisions 
that 
require a public-comment period for rules of 
procedure  and  administration,  there  are  no 
rules  for  making  the  rules.  The  process  is 
organic, flexible, and differs somewhat from 
project to project. But there is a general path 
that most rules projects follow: (1) initiation 
by the Court; (2) drafting work and study by 
the  Supreme  Court  Advisory  Committee  or 
another  outside  group;  (3)  if  another  group 
performs the initial drafting work, review by 
the Supreme Court Advisory Committee; (4) 
additional study and redrafting by the Court’s 
rules attorney and her supervising justice; (5) 
the Court’s deliberation on the proposed rules 
in  one  or  more  administrative  conferences, 
culminating  in  an  order  giving  preliminary 
approval  to  the  rules  and  inviting  public 
comment; (6) a public-comment period; and 
(7) a second order approving the final version 
of the rules. This process is fleshed out more 
below. 

 

1.  Project Initiation 

The first step in the rulemaking process is 
the Court’s decision to take on a rules project. 
Today,  many  rules  projects  are  initiated  by 
legislation that directs or authorizes the Court 
to  make  certain  kinds  of  rules.43  Other 
projects  are  initiated  by  comments  and 
feedback  from  members  of  the  bar  or  the 

procedure  in  any  particular  state  of  case  which  may

may  be  provided  by  law.”36  The  legislature 
has only delegated to the Court of Criminal 
Appeals  the  power  to  promulgate  three 
specific  categories  of  litigation  rules:  (1) 
“rules  of  posttrial,  appellate,  and  review 
procedure in criminal cases”;37 (2) “rules of 
evidence in the trials of criminal cases”;38 and 
(3)  “rules  and  procedures  providing  for  and 
governing  the  electronic  filing  of  briefs, 
pleadings,  and  other  documents  for  capital 
cases in that court.”39  

It  is  unclear  whether  the  Court  of 
Criminal Appeals has the inherent authority 
to  independently  make  other  types  of  rules 
governing  criminal  cases—such  as  rules  of 
criminal  procedure  in  the  trial  courts40—or 
whether that authority has been delegated to 
the Supreme Court through the provisions in 
the  constitution  and  the  Government  Code 
granting the Supreme Court the authority to 
make rules for the administration of justice in 
criminal  cases.41  As  a  practical  matter,  the 
issue  would  only  be  raised  if  the  Court  of 
Criminal  Appeals  promulgated  rules  for 
criminal cases that were not jointly approved 
by  the  Supreme  Court.  But  the  two  high 
courts  strive  to  reach  an  agreement  on 
criminal rules in order to avoid that scenario. 
For example, in 2015, the Supreme Court and 
the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals 
jointly 
approved rules governing electronic filing in 
criminal trial court cases.42

on projects at the Court’s request. The Court 
might  ask  the  SCAC  to  draft  rules  or 
amendments itself or to review and comment 
on  rules  or  amendments  drafted  by  another 
group. 

Importantly, the SCAC is advisory only. 
Its work product and opinions are not binding 
on  the  Court.  The  SCAC  often  votes  on 
drafts, proposals, or issues to get a sense for 
the  majority  view  and  when  the  SCAC’s 
debate on a topic has run its course. But the 
Court  always  has  the  final  say,  and  it  often 
disagrees 
SCAC’s 
recommendations.  

with 

the 

SCAC  meetings  are  open  to  the  public 
and transcribed by a court reporter. Meeting 
transcripts  and  materials  are  posted  to  the 
Court’s  website.45  In  addition,  the  Jackson 
Walker  law  firm  also  maintains  a  site  with 
information about the SCAC.46 

There  are  also  several  bar  association 
groups that study and recommend changes to 
the  rules.  In  contrast  to  the  SCAC,  these 
committees  act  independently  of  the  Court 
and function more like grassroots generators 
of  rules  proposals.  This  category  includes 
three State Bar of Texas committees: (1) the 
Court  Rules  Committee,  which  focuses  on 
the rules of civil and appellate procedure; (2) 
the  Administration  of  Rules  of  Evidence 
Committee;  and  (3)  the  Texas  Disciplinary 
Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  Committee. 
The  trial  and  appellate  sections  of  the  State 
Bar  are  also  active 
in  reviewing  and 
recommending changes to the rules.

with special expertise on a particular subject. 
Anyone

can  propose  new

Court decides on its own that a rules change 
is needed. 

.  Intensive Study and Drafting 

Work 

  2

Making and amending all of the rules that 
govern the Texas judicial system is a big job, 
and the Court needs a lot of outside help. The 
nitty-gritty, tedious study and drafting work 
is usually performed by a group outside the 
Court,  at  least  initially.  There  are  several 
groups that could potentially fill this role, but 
here are the major players. 

.  The  Supreme  Court  Advisory 

Committee (SCAC) 

The Supreme Court Advisory Committee 
is  a  standing  committee  of  practitioners, 
judges, and academics who are appointed by 
the  Court 
to  study,  draft,  and  make 
recommendations  on  rules,  as  the  Court 
directs. The Committee was first appointed in 
1939, after passage of the Rules of Practice 
Act,44  to  draft  the  Texas  Rules  of  Civil 
Procedure. It has been in existence ever since. 
The  number  of  members  has  changed  over 
the  years.  Today  it  is  about  50.  The  Court 
appoints  members  for  three-year  terms  and 
strives  to  achieve  all  kinds  of  diversity—
geographic, demographic, and of experience. 

For  most  of  its  history,  the  SCAC 
considered  every  rules  proposal  it  received 
from  any  source  whatsoever,  but  that  is  no 
longer the case. Today, the SCAC only works

as TEX. GOV’T CODE § 22.004).

more,  depending  on  the  complexity  and 
urgency of the project, the Court’s priorities, 
and whether intervening legislation requires 
the Court to shift its focus to other projects. 
The work performed in this stage can range 
from light-touch editing of an outside draft to 
a complete, start-from-scratch rewrite. 

5.  Administrative Conference No. 1 
& Preliminary Approval Order 

Eventually,  the  rules  attorney  and  her 
supervising  justice  will  present  their  work 
product  and  recommendations  to  the  full 
Court  in  conference,  along  with  the  work 
product and recommendations of all outside 
groups that worked on the project. The Court 
often  goes  through  the  drafts  line-by-line. 
Conference deliberations can take hours and 
often result in changes to the draft proposed 
by the rules attorney. When a majority of the 
Court  reaches  an  agreement,  the  Court  will 
administrative  order  giving 
issue 
preliminary approval to the rule. Some rules 
projects  are  conferenced  multiple 
times 
before an initial approval order is released.

6.  Public-Comment Period 

 

 

When  the  Court  adopts  a  new  statewide 
rule or makes substantive amendments to an 
existing  statewide  rule,  it  almost  always 
invites  public  comment.  The  Government 
Code imposes a statutory comment period for 
rules 
judicial 
administration.  Section  22.004(b)  requires 
the  clerk  of  the  Supreme  Court  to  “mail  a 
copy  of  those  rules  or  amendments  to  rules 
[of  civil  procedure] 
to  each  registered 
member  of  the  State  Bar  of  Texas  not  later 
than  the  60th  day  before  the  date  on  which

48  See  Misc.  Docket  No.  09-9141  (Aug.  24,  2009) 
(Order  Establishing  the  Task  Force  on  International 
Law Practice in Texas). 

 

  7

c.  Specialized Task Forces 

Occasionally  a  rules  project  requires  an 
expertise that the SCAC lacks. In those cases, 
the  Court  often  appoints  a  task  force  of 
specialists to do the initial study and drafting 
work  for  a  particular  project.  Examples 
Judicial 
the  Task  Force  on 
include 
Foreclosure Rules, which has been convened 
several times to draft and revise Texas Rules 
of  Civil  Procedure  735  and  736,47  and  the 
Task Force on International Law Practice in 
Texas, which was established to recommend 
updates  to  the  bar-admission  requirements 
for foreign-trained lawyers.48 

  

 

3.  Review By the SCAC 

If  the  initial  drafting  work  is  performed 
by  a  group  other  than  the  SCAC,  the  Court 
often asks the SCAC to review and comment 
on  the  drafting  group’s  work  product—
particularly  if  the  project  relates  to  rules  of 
procedure or evidence. Sometimes the SCAC 
will disagree with the direction taken by the 
initial drafters and submit its own draft to the 
Court.  Some  projects  go  through  SCAC 
review multiple times. 

4.  Internal Work at the Court 

Once  all  outside  drafts  have  been 
submitted  to  the  Court  and  the  SCAC’s 
review is complete, the real work inside the 
Court  begins.  The  rules  attorney  and  her 
supervising  justice  sort  through  all  of  the 
drafts, re-read the transcripts of all applicable 
SCAC 
on 
recommendations and a draft to present to the 
full  Court.  This  internal  work  can  take 
anywhere from a few weeks to a few years or 

discussions,

Bar Journal, and then run through the end of 
July,  satisfying  the  60-day  requirement  of 
section 22.004(b). But occasionally the Court 
must make the rules effective first and have 
the comment period second in order to meet 
a  deadline  imposed  by  the  legislature  or 
because some other circumstance counsels in 
favor  of  making  the  rules  effective  right 
away.52 
 

Notably,  the  public  always  has  longer 
than the length of the official comment period 
to submit comments on a rules change. The 
order is often released to the public through 
the Court’s website several weeks before it is 
published in the Texas Bar Journal, and the 
Court  reviews  and  considers  all  comments 
submitted  after  the  due  date  stated  in  the 
Court’s preliminary approval order. 

 

 

7.  Administrative Conference No. 2 

& Final Approval Order

After 

the  deadline 

submitting 
comments has passed, the rules attorney and 
her supervising justice present the comments 
to the Court and recommend whether to make 
any  changes  to  the  rules  in  response.  If  the 
rule  has  not  yet  taken  effect,  the  Court  will 
issue  a  final  approval  order  before  the 
effective date that contains the final version 
of  the  rule—even  if  the  final  version  is  the 
the 
same  as 
the  version  set  forth

52  Two  recent  examples  of  this  departure  from  the 
usual  order  are  the  December  29,  2015  order 
approving amendments to the Rules and Forms for a 
Judicial Bypass of Parental Notice and Consent Under 
Chapter 33 of the Family Code (Misc. Docket No. 15-
9246) and the March 22, 2016 order adopting Rule of 
Judicial  Administration  14  to  govern  special,  three-
judge district  courts (Misc. Docket No. 16-9037). In 
each instance, the new rule or amendments had to take 
effect  immediately  because  they  related  to  statutory 
changes that were about to take effect or had already 
taken effect. 
 

they  become effective.”49 Section 74.024(d) 
contains  an  analogous  provision  requiring 
that rules of judicial administration be mailed 
to  members  120  days  before  their  effective 
date.50  The  Court  has  construed 
these 
sections  as  requiring  a  60-day  comment 
period for rules of procedure and a 120-day 
comment  period  for  rules  of  administration, 
which officially commences when the new or 
amended rule is  published in the  Texas Bar 
Journal.51 Publication of a rules order in the 
Texas Bar Journal is the Court’s method of 
mailing the order to all bar members. 

 
The 

legislature  has  not  required  a 
comment period for other kinds of rules, but 
the  Court  often  has  one  anyway,  especially 
when the Court makes substantive changes to 
rules of statewide interest, such as the Rules 
the  Rules  Governing 
of  Evidence  or 
Admission 
the  Bar.  Instructions  for 
submitting comments and their due date are 
stated in the preliminary approval order. 

to 

 

ideally—the 

Usually—and 

comment 
period concludes before the effective date of 
the amendments so that only one version of 
the  amendments  takes  effect.  For  example, 
the  Court  may  approve  amendments  to  the 
Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  in  a  preliminary 
order dated May 1, to be effective September 
1.  The  comment  period  will  be  deemed  to 
commence  on  June  1  with  the  order’s 
publication  in  the  June  edition  of  the  Texas 

                                                 
49 TEX. GOV’T CODE § 22.004(b). 
50 See id. § 74.024(d).  
51 Unlike section 22.004(b), which requires that rules 
be mailed to members 60 days before their effective 
date but does not expressly require the Court to invite 
comments, section 74.024(d) states that the Court must 
mail  amendments  to  rules  of  judicial  administration 
120 days before their effective date and have a 60-day 
comment period. But there is usually no reason to cut 
off  the  comment  period  two  months  before  the  rule 
takes effect, so rules promulgated under the authority 
of  section  74.024  usually  have  a  120-day  comment 
period.

V.  Resources, Rules History Research, 
Tips, and Contact Information 

The  Court’s 

rulemaking  process 

is 
different  from  its  case-adjudication  process 
in one important respect: public participation 
and access. You cannot call a chambers staff 
attorney to discuss a case that is pending or 
may come before the Court, but you can call 
the  rules  attorney 
to  propose  a  rules 
amendment or to discuss a rules project that 
the  Court  has  decided  to  pursue.  The  Court 
strives to make the substance and procedure 
of  its  rulemaking  as  transparent  as  possible 
and has tasked its rules attorney with serving 
as an ambassador to the bar and the public on 
all rules-related issues. To that end, here is a 
list  of  online  rules-related  resources,  an 
explanation  of  how  the  rules  attorney  can 
help  you  research  a  rule,  and  some  practice 
tips.

  Be  careful  when  relying  on  preliminary 
approval orders. If the order’s cover page 
invites public comment on a rules change 
and makes the change effective after the 
comment period has ended, the version of 
the  rule  in  the  order  is  not  the  final 
version.  Preliminary  approval  orders 
always  contain  this  warning:  “These 
amendments may be changed in response 
to comments received by _____ [date].”

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
