Texas Judicial Council.
The Texas Judicial Council (TJC) was created in 1929 by the 41st Legislature to continuously study and report on 
the organization and practices of the Texas Judicial Branch. TJC is the policy-making body for the state judiciary.

The Council studies methods to simplify judicial procedures, expedite court business, and better administer 
justice. It examines the work accomplished by the courts and submits recommendations for improvement of the 
system to the Legislature, the Governor and the Supreme Court. The Council receives and considers input from 
judges, public officials, members of the bar, and citizens.

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
