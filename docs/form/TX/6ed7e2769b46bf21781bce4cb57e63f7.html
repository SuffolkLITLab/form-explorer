TEXAS BOARD OF LEGAL SPECIALIZATION 
STANDARDS FOR ATTORNEY CERTIFICATION 
 
PART  II  
SPECIFIC AREA REQUIREMENTS 
 
These  are  specific  requirements  that  apply  the  specialty  area  listed  below.    The  specific  requirements 
include  the  definitions,  substantial  involvement,  reference,  and  other  certification  and  recertification 
requirements  for  the  specialty  area.    You  will  also  need  to  refer  to  the  Standards  for  Attorney 
Certification, Part I – General Requirements for requirements that apply to all specialty areas. 

DEFINITION.  Civil appellate law is the practice of law involving proceedings brought before a 
civil appellate court either by appeal of a final judgment or appealable interlocutory order or by 
an  original  proceeding  in  the  appellate  court.    The  preparation  and  presentation  of  the  court’s 
charge  and  of  post-trial  and  other  dispositive  motions  at  the  trial  court  level  shall  also  be 
considered the practice of civil appellate law.  The practice of civil appellate law that qualifies 
for  substantial  involvement  and  special  competence  should  generally  cover  multiple  areas  of 
procedure  and  substantive  law  and  not  be  limited  to  any  one,  narrow  area  of  law  (unless 
substantial involvement and special competence can otherwise be shown).

civil appellate law.
