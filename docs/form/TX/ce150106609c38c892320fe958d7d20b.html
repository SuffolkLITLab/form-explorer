      <pre> LEAVE POLICY 
FOR 
SIXTH COURT OF APPEALS 

It  is  the  policy  of  this  court  to  comply  with  the  terms  of  Chapter  661  of  the  Texas 
Government Code as it is amended from time to time.  At the time of the initial adoption of this 
policy, the types of leave governed by Chapter 661 included the following: 
 

  Sick Leave Pool(see §661.001–.008), 
  Vacation Leave (§661.151–.153),  
  Sick Leave (§661.201‒.207),  
  Emergency Leave (death in family, §661.902(a)),  
  Other Emergency Leave (for good cause, §661.902(b)),  
  National  Guard  Emergency  leave  (§§  661.903,  661.904(d),  (f),  and 

661.9041),  

  Military Leave (§661.904),  
  Emergency Volunteer Leave (“emergency medical services volunteers” or 

“volunteer firefighters,” §661.905),  

  Foster Parent Leave §661.906),  
  Red Cross Disaster Service Leave §661.907),  
  Leave of Absence (§661.909),  
  Assistance Dog Training Leave (§661.910),  
  Outstanding-Performance Administrative Leave (§661.911),  
  Family and Medical Leave (§661.912),  
  Parental Leave (§661.913),  
  Voting Leave (§661.914),  
  Organ or Bone Marrow Donor Leave (§661.916),  
  Blood Donation Leave (§661.917),  
  Amateur Radio Operator Leave (§661.919),  
  CASA Volunteer Leave (§661.921),  
  Reserve Law Enforcement Officer Leave (§661.922),  
  Leave During Agency Investigation (§661.923),  
  Medical and Mental Health Care Leave for Certain Veterans (§661.924).  

he types of leave to be covered by this court’s Leave Policy is intended to expand or contract as 
Chapter 661 is amended, over time, to expand or contract the types of leave covered under that 
Chapter, and it is the policy of this court to cover any types of leave set out, at any time, in Chapter 
661 and to exclude any not set out, at any time, in Chapter 661. 

The intent of this policy is to govern leave for court employees under Chapter 661 and to 
supplement those statutes that may be part of Chapter 661 from time to time, to provide clear and 
objective  guidelines  to  establish  under  what  circumstances  an  employee  of  the  court  may  be 
entitled to, or may be granted, each type of leave provided by Chapter 661.

The  Sixth  Court  of  Appeals  hereby  establishes  (and  ratifies  and  adopts  the  same  to  be 
administered under these terms) a sick leave pool under which court employees may voluntarily 
transfer  sick  leave  earned  by  the  employee  to  a  sick  leave  pool  for  use  by  other  qualifying 
employees.  The Clerk of Court shall administer the pool and shall be referred to herein as the 
Administrator. 

eneral:  The court has established, and hereby ratifies to be administered under these terms, a 
sick-leave pool where hours have, over the years, been contributed by various employees when 
they have left the court’s employment.  The idea for the pool is that it is to be used in case of 
catastrophic illness or injury for those who have not abused the sick-leave system. 

 catastrophic illness or injury is a severe condition or combination of conditions affecting the 
mental or physical health of an employee or an employee's immediate family member that requires 
the services of a health care provider for a prolonged period of time and that forces the employee 
to exhaust all paid leave earned1 by that employee.  (See 43 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 4.51) 
  
Policy Considerations:  It is the policy of this court to retain SL Pool hours for use by those who 
have  been  “good  citizens”  (i.e.,  have  not  abused  sick  leave  by  using  it  for  arguably  optional 
situations,  in  small,  relatively  frequent  amounts)  and  encounter  a  catastrophic  illness/condition 
themselves.    We  also  ought  to  encourage  people  to  have  a  certain  minimum  amount  of  SL 
accumulated in their own account.  This tends to keep folks on the job and retain SL for what it 
was intended, that is, real sickness or injury.  A good goal is to achieve a personal balance of at 
least 20 days’ sick leave. 

acts:  Using any SL from the SL pool, reduces the amount available to others, even those who 
have previously never taken any SL (the “righteous” user).  But, we seldom have had any need to 
tap the pool at all.  The only time, in current memory, when the SL pool was tapped was many 
years ago.   

ontributions:  Any current employee may contribute one or more days of that employee’s accrued 
sick leave, and the Administrator shall credit the time contributed to the SL Pool.  Any retiring 
employee may designate the number of hours of accrued sick leave to be used for his/her retirement 
credit and the number of hours to be contributed to the sick leave pool.   

ithdrawals: A current court employee may be approved to use pool hours under this policy, if 
that  employee  has  exhausted  his/her  sick  leave  because  of  (1)  catastrophic  illness  or  injury  or 
(2) previous donation of time to the pool.  The Administrator shall have the authority and discretion 
to determine if an applying employee  (1) has established a pattern of repeatedly and electively 
using his/her SL for personal convenience rather than true sickness and (2) therefore has a balance 
of less than 20 days’ accumulated sick leave, vacation leave, and comp time; in which case the 
Administrator shall require the applying employee, in any period of time away from work due to 
sickness, medical condition, or injury, to: (A) first use the SL, vacation time, and comp time they 
                                                 
1This Court interprets “all paid leave earned” to include normal sick leave and normal vacation leave, but to exclude 
any sick leave pool hours and exceptional sick leave, which are not “earned” by the employee.

Sick Leave Pool: 

have accumulated, and (B) incur unpaid time off that the days used in (A) and (B) totals 20 days, 
before  qualifying  for  payment  of  sick  leave  from  the  SL  Pool.    Employees  determined  by  the 
Administrator, in his or her discretion, to have not established such a pattern (i.e., of repeatedly 
and electively using their SL for personal convenience rather than for true sickness) will not incur 
any  such  sanction.    The  employee  who  wishes  to  use  SL  Pool  sick  leave  shall  apply  to  the 
Administrator for permission to withdraw time from the pool and also supply to the Administrator 
a written statement from a “licensed practitioner” who is treating the employee, or is treating the 
employee’s family member, as appropriate, sufficient to enable the Administrator to determine the 
employee’s eligibility for withdrawal from the pool.  To the extent the Administrator concludes 
that the employee is eligible to withdraw from the SL Pool, the Administrator shall approve the 
transfer, shall credit the withdrawn time to the employee, and shall so notify the employee.  No 
withdrawals  shall  be  approved  except  for  catastrophic  illness/injury  to  the  employee  or  the 
qualifying member of the employee’s immediate family, and none shall be approved in excess of 
the lesser of one-third of the total time in the pool at that time or 90 days.  Once a withdrawal has 
been approved and credited, it may be used as the employee’s own sick leave, except that such 
employee’s decedent’s estate cannot use any time so transferred/credited from the SL Pool. 

.  Sick Leave for Employees  (see Subchapter G.  §§ 661.201–.207) 

1.  Normal Sick Leave.  To be eligible to take accumulated sick leave without a deduction 
in salary during a continuous period of more than three working days, an employee absent due to 
sickness,  injury, or pregnancy  and confinement  shall send, as soon as practicable, to  the Chief 
Justice or his/her designee a doctor's certificate showing the cause or nature of the condition or 
another  written  statement  of  the  facts  concerning  the  condition  that  is  acceptable  to  the  Chief 
Justice. No doctor's certificate or other written statement is required for shorter periods, unless the 
Chief Justice decides otherwise in a particular case and so notifies the employee in question.  (see 
§661.202 (g)) 

2.  Exceptions to Normal Sick Leave.   If an employee is using sick leave,  an exception 
(extension) to the amount of sick leave may be granted by decision of the Chief Justice if all the 
following conditions are met: (1) the Administrator of the Sick Leave Pool determines that the 
employee has not established a pattern of repeatedly and electively using his/her Sick Leave for 
personal convenience rather than true sickness, (2) the Chief Justice, based on an added, specific 
written  statement  from  a  treating  “licensed  practitioner”  that  the  employee  needs  up  to  five 
additional days off of work from the court due to the qualifying illness or injury, determines that 
the employee needs such an extension of sick leave beyond his/her normal sick leave and his/her 
transferred sick leave from the Sick Leave Pool.  This policy shall be maintained in written form, 
made available to all Court employees, and provided to the State Auditor on request. A statement 
of each such exception and the reasons for each shall be attached to this Court’s duplicate payroll 
voucher for the payroll period affected by the authorized exceptions.   (See § 661.202, esp. (i), (j))  

.  Emergency Leave: 

1.   Death  in  the  Immediate Family.   The Court allows up to  three (3) days’ emergency 
leave, with pay and without deductions, for a death in the employee’s immediate family, as defined 
by §661.902(a).  (see § 661.902(a))   

  B

   

   

  C

   

2.  Other Emergency Leave.  Emergency leave without pay, for a reason other than death 
in the family, may be granted by the Chief Justice of this Court, if the employee requests such 
other emergency leave, the Chief Justice, in his or her discretion, determines that the employee has 
shown good cause for taking such other emergency leave, and it appears to the Chief Justice, in 
his or her discretion, that the employee being granted the other emergency leave intends to return 
to the employee's position with the Court on expiration of the period of emergency leave.  This 
provision  does  not  apply  to  require  an  employee  application  for  such  leave  when  the  Court  is 
closed due to weather conditions or in observance of a holiday.  (see § 661.902(b),(c))  

.  Emergency Volunteer Leave: 

“Emergency medical services volunteers” and “volunteer firefighters” are entitled to paid 
leave to attend training for these roles conducted by state agency or institution of higher education, 
not to exceed 5 days per fiscal year.  Since the Court may pay them while they are responding to 
emergency fire or medical situations, it is the Court’s policy to pay such active emergency time, 
so long as the Chief Justice determines that the Court can do so consistent with its fiscal situation 
and obligations known at the time.  (see § 661.905) 

.  Leave of Absence: 

It is the policy of the court to grant employees in good standing a leave of absence of not 
to exceed twelve months, only if and to the extent that the Chief Justice determines that its doing 
so in each particular case would not seriously compromise the court’s ability to perform its roles 
on a timely basis.  It would be required, in any event, that the employee first consume all paid 
leave entitlements, except that sick leave is to be used only if the leave is eligible for sick leave.  
(see § 661.909) 

.  Outstanding-Performance Administrative Leave: 

It  is  the policy of this  court that, upon unanimous finding and approval  of the terms  of 
which by the then actively serving justices of this court, for documented outstanding performance 
by a key employee, this court may grant an employee paid administrative leave of up to 32 hours 
in any fiscal year.  (see § 661.911)
