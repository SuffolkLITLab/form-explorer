      <pre>IN THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS 
 
════════════════════ 
Misc. Docket No. 20-9154 
════════════════════ 
 
════════════════════════════════════════════════════ 
PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO TEXAS RULES OF CIVIL 
PROCEDURE 145, 502.3, AND 506.4 AND TO THE FORM STATEMENT OF 
INABILITY TO AFFORD PAYMENT OF COURT COSTS 
════════════════════════════════════════════════════ 
 

ORDERED that: 

 

The Court preliminarily approves amendments to Texas Rules of Civil Procedures 145, 
502.3,  and  506.4  and  to  the  form  Statement  of  Inability  to  Afford  Payment  of  Court 
Costs. 

The amendments make two sets of substantive changes to Rule 145. 

  First,  paragraph  (d)  has  been  amended  to  clarify  that  certain  categories  of 
evidence  are  prima  facie  proof  of  the  declarant’s  inability  to  afford  costs. 
Paragraph  (e)  now  requires  that  a  contest  by  a  court  reporter  satisfy  the  same 
conditions  as  a  contest  by  the  clerk  or  a  party.  These  changes  are  intended  to 
reduce frivolous challenges to a Statement, which cost time and resources. 
 

  Second, paragraph (f)(4) has been amended to require that an order directing the 

declarant to pay costs include notice of the declarant’s right to appeal. 

dditional  stylistic  changes  have  resulted  in  some  paragraphs  being  rearranged  or 
renumbered.  This  order  includes  both  a  clean  copy  of  the  amended  rule  and  a  rough 
redline demonstrating the changes. In the event of a conflict between the two, the clean 
copy controls. 

  A

Rule 502.3 is amended to update a reference to Rule 145 in paragraph (c). A few other 
changes  are  made  for  conformity  and  readability.  The  changes  to  this  rule  are 
demonstrated in redline only. 

Rule 506.4 is amended to correct a typographical error in the heading of paragraph (c). 
This change is demonstrated in redline only. 

The  form  Statement  has  been  amended  to  give  the  declarant  the  option  of  making  an 
affidavit  before  a  notary  rather  than  a  declaration  under  penalty  of  perjury.  Other 
wordsmithing  changes  have  been  made.  Only  a  clean  version  of  the  amended  form  is 
included.  The  Office  of  Court  Administration  is  directed  to  prepare a  bilingual  form

Statement,  which  will  be  posted  at  https://www.txcourts.gov/rules-forms/forms/  when 
available. 

The  Court  will  issue  a  final  approval  order  at  least  60  days  after  publication  of  the 
amendments  in  the  February  edition  of  the  Texas  Bar  Journal.  The  amendments  may 
change in response to public comments. 

Comments  should  be  sent  to  rulescomments@txcourts.gov.  The  Court  requests  that 
comments be sent by April 2, 2021. 

The Clerk is directed to: 

file a copy of this Order with the Secretary of State; 

cause a copy of this Order to be mailed to each registered member of the State Bar 
of Texas by publication in the Texas Bar Journal;  

send a copy of this Order to each elected member of the Legislature; and 

submit a copy of the Order for publication in the Texas Register.

RULE 145. PAYMENT OF COSTS NOT REQUIRED 
(Clean, As Amended) 

Costs Defined. “Costs” mean any fee charged by the court or an officer of the court that 
could be taxed in a bill of costs, including, but not limited to, filing fees, fees for issuance 
and service of process, fees for a court-appointed professional, and fees charged by the 
clerk or court reporter for preparation of the appellate record. 

Sworn Statement Required. A party who cannot afford payment of court costs must file 
the  Statement  of  Inability  to  Afford  Payment  of  Court  Costs  approved  by  the  Supreme 
Court or another sworn document containing the same information. A “sworn” Statement 
is  one  that  is  signed  before  a  notary  or  made  under  penalty  of  perjury.  In  this  rule, 
“declarant” means the party filing the Statement. 

c) 

Duties of the Clerk. The clerk: 

must make the Statement available to any person for free; 
 
may  return  a  Statement  for  correction  only  if  it  is  not  sworn—not  for  any  other 
reason; 

must,  on  the  filing  of  a  sworn  Statement,  docket  the  case,  issue  citation,  and 
provide any other service that is ordinarily provided to a party; and  

may, without delaying compliance with (3), ask the court to direct the declarant to 
correct or clarify a sworn Statement that contains a material defect. 

Prima  Facie  Evidence  of  Inability  to  Afford  Payment  of  Costs.  The  declarant  should 
submit  with  the  Statement  any  available  evidence  of  the  declarant’s  inability  to  afford 
payment  of  costs.  An  attachment  demonstrating  any  of  the  following  is  prima  facie 
evidence: 

the  declarant  receives  benefits  from  a  means-tested  government  entitlement 
program; 

the declarant is being represented in the case by an attorney who is providing free 
legal services to the declarant through: 

(A) 

a provider funded by the Texas Access to Justice Foundation; 

(B) 

a provider funded by the Legal Services Corporation; or 

(C) 

a nonprofit that provides civil legal services to persons living at or below 
200% of the federal poverty guidelines published annually by the United 
States Department of Health and Human Services; or

the  declarant  has  applied  for  free  legal  services  for  the  case  through  a  provider 
listed  in  (2)  and  was  determined  to  be  financially  eligible  but  was  declined 
representation. 

e)  Motion to Require Payment of Costs. A motion to require the declarant to pay costs must 

comply with this paragraph. 

By  the  Clerk,  the  Reporter,  or  a  Party.  A  motion  filed  by  the  clerk,  the  court 
reporter, or a party must contain sworn evidence—not merely allegations—either 
that  the  Statement  was  materially  false  when  made  or  that  because  of  changed 
circumstances, it is no longer true. 

By the Court. The court on its own may require the declarant to prove the inability 
to  afford  costs  when  evidence  comes  before  the  court  that  the  declarant  may  be 
able  to  afford  costs  or  when  an  officer  or  professional  must  be  appointed  in  the 
case. 

Notice; Hearing; Requirements of Order. When a Statement has been filed, the declarant 
must  not  be  ordered  to  pay  costs  unless  these  procedural  requirements  have  been 
satisfied: 

Notice and Hearing. The declarant must not be required to pay costs without an 
oral  evidentiary  hearing.  The  declarant  must  be  given  10  days’  notice  of  the 
hearing. Notice must either be in writing and served in accordance with Rule 21a 
or given in open court. At the hearing, the burden is on the declarant to prove the 
inability to afford costs. 

Findings  Required.  An  order  requiring  the  declarant  to  pay  costs  must  be 
supported by detailed findings that the declarant can afford to pay costs. 

Partial and Delayed Payment. The court may order that the declarant pay the part 
of the costs the declarant can afford or that payment be made in installments. But 
the court must not delay the case if payment is made in installments. 

Order Must State Notice of Right to Appeal. An order requiring the declarant to 
pay costs must state in conspicuous type: “You may challenge this order by filing 
a motion in the court of appeals within 10 days after the date this order is signed. 
See Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 145.”

Review of Trial Court Order.  

Only  Declarant  May  Challenge;  Motion.  Only  the  declarant  may  challenge  an 
order  issued  by  the  trial  court  under  this  rule.  The  declarant  may  challenge  the 
order by motion filed in the court of appeals with jurisdiction over an appeal from 
the  judgment  in  the  case.  The  declarant  is  not  required  to  pay  any  filing  fees 
related to the motion in the court of appeals.  

Misc. Docket No. 20-9154 

Page 5 

 
Time for Filing; Extension. The motion must be filed within 10 days after the trial 
court’s order is signed. The court of appeals may extend the deadline by 15 days 
if the declarant demonstrates good cause for the extension in writing. 

Record. After a motion is filed, the court of appeals must promptly send notice to 
the trial court clerk and the court reporter requesting preparation of the record of 
all trial court proceedings on the declarant’s claim of indigence. The court may set 
a deadline for filing the record. The record must be provided without charge. 

4) 

Court of Appeals to Rule Promptly. The court of appeals must rule on the motion 
at the earliest practicable time. 

Judgment. The judgment must not require the declarant to pay costs, and a provision in 
the  judgment  purporting  to  do  so  is  void,  unless  the  court  has  issued  an  order  that 
complies with (f), or the declarant has obtained a monetary recovery, and the court orders 
the recovery to be applied toward payment of costs. 

Notes and Comments

3)

Comment to 2016 Change: The rule has been rewritten. Access to the civil justice system 
cannot be denied because a person cannot afford to pay court costs. Whether a particular fee is a 
court cost is governed by this rule, Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section 31.007, and case 
law.  

he issue is not merely whether a person can pay costs, but whether the person can afford to pay 
costs. A person may have sufficient cash on hand to pay filing fees, but the person cannot afford 
the fees if paying them would preclude the person from paying for basic essentials, like housing 
or  food.  Experience  indicates  that  almost  all  filers  described  in  (e)(1)-(3),  and  most  filers 
described in (e)(4), cannot in fact afford to pay costs.  

ecause  costs  to  access  the  system—filing  fees,  fees  for  issuance  of  process  and  notices,  and 
fees  for  service  and  return—are  kept  relatively  small,  the  expense  involved  in  challenging  a 
claim  of  inability  to  afford  costs  often  exceeds  the  costs  themselves.  Thus,  the  rule  does  not 
allow the clerk or a party to challenge a litigant’s claim of inability to afford costs without sworn 
evidence that the claim is false. The filing of a Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court 
Costs—which  may  either  be  sworn  to  before  a  notary  or  made  under  penalty  of  perjury,  as 
permitted by Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section 132.001—is all that is needed to require 
the clerk to provide ordinary services without payment of fees and costs. But evidence may come 
to light that the claim was false when made. And the declarant’s circumstances may change, so 
that the claim is no longer true. Importantly, costs may increase with the appointment of officers 
or professionals in the case, or when a reporter’s record must be prepared. The reporter is always 
allowed to challenge a claim of inability to afford costs before incurring the substantial expense 
of record preparation. The trial court always retains discretion to require evidence of an inability 
to afford costs.

Comment  to  2021  Change:    The  rule  has  been  amended  to  clarify  that  proof  of  any 
 
criterion in paragraph (d) is prima facie evidence of the declarant’s inability to afford payment of 
costs. Paragraph (e) has been amended to require that a contest by the court reporter satisfy the 
same conditions as a contest by the clerk or a party. These amendments are intended to reduce 
frivolous challenges to a Statement, which cost time and resources. 

The  rule  has  also  been  amended  to  require  in  paragraph  (f)(4)  that  an  order  requiring 

payment of costs include conspicuous notice of the declarant’s right to appeal.  
 

To accommodate these substantive changes, some paragraphs have been rearranged and 

relettered or renumbered. Other clarifying and stylistic changes have been made.

Order Must State Notice of Right to Appeal. An order requiring the declarant to 
pay costs must state in conspicuous type: “You may challenge this order by filing 
a motion in the court of appeals within 10 days after the date this order is signed. 
See Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 145.” 

g) 

Review of Trial Court Order.  

Only  Declarant  May  Challenge;  Motion.  Only  the  declarant  may  challenge  an 
order  issued  by  the  trial  court  under  this  rule.  The  declarant  may  challenge  the 
order by motion filed in the court of appeals with jurisdiction over an appeal from 
the  judgment  in  the  case.  The  declarant  is  not  required  to  pay  any  filing  fees 
related to the motion in the court of appeals. 
  
Time for Filing; Extension. The motion must be filed within 10 days after the trial 
court’s order is signed. The court of appeals may extend the deadline by 15 days 
if the declarant demonstrates good cause for the extension in writing.

Record. After a motion is filed, the court of appeals must promptly send notice to 
the trial court clerk and the court reporter requesting preparation of the record of 
all trial court proceedings on the declarant’s claim of indigence. The court may set 
a deadline for filing the record. The record must be provided without charge. 

4) 

Court of Appeals to Rule Promptly. The court of appeals must rule on the motion 
at the earliest practicable time. 

Judgment. The judgment must not require the declarant to pay costs, and a provision in 
the judgment purporting to do so is void, unless the court has issued an order underthat 
complies with (f), or the declarant has obtained a monetary recovery, and the court orders 
the recovery to be applied toward payment of costs.

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 2016 Change: The rule has been rewritten. Access to the civil justice system 
cannot be denied because a person cannot afford to pay court costs. Whether a particular fee is a 
court cost is governed by this rule, Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section 31.007, and case 
law.  

he issue is not merely whether a person can pay costs, but whether the person can afford to pay 
costs. A person may have sufficient cash on hand to pay filing fees, but the person cannot afford 
the fees if paying them would preclude the person from paying for basic essentials, like housing 
or  food.  Experience  indicates  that  almost  all  filers  described  in  (e)(1)-(3),  and  most  filers 
described in (e)(4), cannot in fact afford to pay costs.  

ecause  costs  to  access  the  system—filing  fees,  fees  for  issuance  of  process  and  notices,  and 
fees  for  service  and  return—are  kept  relatively  small,  the  expense  involved  in  challenging  a 
claim  of  inability  to  afford  costs  often  exceeds  the  costs  themselves.  Thus,  the  rule  does  not 
allow the clerk or a party to challenge a litigant’s claim of inability to afford costs without sworn 
evidence that the claim is false. The filing of a Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court 
Costs—which  may  either  be  sworn  to  before  a  notary  or  made  under  penalty  of  perjury,  as 
permitted by Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section 132.001—is all that is needed to require 
the clerk to provide ordinary services without payment of fees and costs. But evidence may come 
to light that the claim was false when made. And the declarant’s circumstances may change, so 
that the claim is no longer true. Importantly, costs may increase with the appointment of officers 
or professionals in the case, or when a reporter’s record must be prepared. The reporter is always 
allowed to challenge a claim of inability to afford costs before incurring the substantial expense 
of record preparation. The trial court always retains discretion to require evidence of an inability 
to afford costs. 

Comment  to  2021  Change:    The  rule  has  been  amended  to  clarify  that  proof  of  any 
criterion in paragraph (d) is prima facie evidence of the declarant’s inability to afford court costs. 
Paragraph (e) has been amended to require that a contest by the court reporter satisfy the same

conditions  as  a  contest  by  the  clerk  or  a  party.  These  amendments  are  intended  to  reduce 
frivolous challenges to a Statement, which cost time and resources. 

The  rule  has  also  been  amended  to  require  in  paragraph  (f)(3)  that  an  order  requiring 

payment of costs include conspicuous notice of the declarant’s right to appeal.  
 

To accommodate these substantive changes, some paragraphs have been rearranged and 

relettered or renumbered. Other clarifying and stylistic changes have been made.

RULE 502.3. FEES; INABILITY TO AFFORD FEES 

Fees and Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs. On filing the petition, 
the plaintiff must pay the appropriate filing fee and service fees, if any, with the court. A 
plaintiff  who  is  unable  to  afford  to  pay  the  fees  must  file  a  Statement  of  Inability  to 
Afford Payment of Court Costs. The Statement must either be sworn to before a notary or 
made  under  penalty  of  perjury.  Upon  filing  the  Statement,  the  clerk  must  docket  the 
action, issue citation, and provide any other customary services. 

Supreme Court Form; Contents of Statement. The plaintiff must use the form Statement 
approved by the Supreme Court, or the Statement must include the information required 
by the Court-approved form. The clerk must make the form available to all any persons 
for freewithout charge or request. 

Certificate  of  Legal-Aid  Provider.  If  the  party  is  represented  by  an  attorney  who  is 
providing free legal services because of the party’s indigence, without contingency, and 
the attorney is providing services either directly or by referral from a legal-aid provider 
described  in  Rule  145(d)(e)(2),  the  attorney  may  file  a  certificate  confirming  that  the 
provider  screened  the  party  for  eligibility  under  the  income  and  asset  guidelines 
established by the provider. A Statement that is accompanied by the certificate of a legal-
aid provider may not be contested under (d). 

(1) 

(2) 

Unless  a  certificate  is  filed  under  (c),  the  defendant  may  file  a  contest  of  the 
Statement at any time within 7 days after the day the defendant’s answer is due. If 
the Statement attests to receipt of government entitlement based on indigence, the 
Statement may only be contested with regard to the veracity of the attestation. 
  
If contested, the judge must hold a hearing to determine the plaintiff’s ability to 
afford the fees. At the hearing, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the inability 
to afford fees.  
 

 
(2)(3)  The  judge  may,  regardless  of  whether  the  defendant  contests  the  Statement, 
examine  the  Statement  and  conduct  a  hearing  to  determine  the  plaintiff’s  ability  to 
afford fees.  

3)(4)  If the judge determines that the plaintiff is able to afford the fees, the judge must 
enter a written order listing the reasons for the determination, and the plaintiff must 
pay the fees in the time specified in the order or the case will be dismissed without 
prejudice.
