Texas Judicial Council

The Texas Judicial Council (TJC) was created by the 41st Texas Legislature in 1929 as the policy-making body for the 
state judiciary. The TJC is responsible for continuously studying and reporting on the “organization, rules, procedures 
and practice, work accomplished, results, and uniformity of the discretionary powers of the state courts and methods 
for  their  improvement.” To  accomplish  this  purpose,  the TJC  designs “methods  for  simplifying  judicial  procedure, 
expediting the transaction of judicial business, and correcting faults in or improving the administration of justice.”

In  June  2017,  the  Texas  Judicial  Council  established  the  Civil  Justice 
Committee to “study the Conference of Chief Justices’ Civil Justice Initiative 
recommendations and the landscape of Texas civil justice and recommend 
necessary reforms to improve access to civil justice in the Texas courts.”

The committee appointed an advisory council to assist in its efforts. 

The Civil Justice Committee held meetings on September 28, 2017, April 18, 
2018, and June 4, 2018, and the Civil Justice Advisory Council met on February 
15-16,  2018. The  advisory  council  meeting  was  supported  by  a  grant  from 
the State Justice Institute.1  Ultimately, the committee released a report and 
recommendations laying out the following recommendations:

1. 

 
Ensure that the judiciary is able to attract the best and brightest minds 
to promote a fair and experienced judiciary by:
a. 

b. 

i. 

ii. 

 
Considering  alternatives  to  the  current  method  of  selection  of 
judges by partisan elections;
 
Passing  a  resolution  proposing  a  Constitutional  amendment  to 
modify the qualifications of judges to serve as justices/judges as 
follows:
 
Eliminating  or  increasing  the  maximum  age  restrictions 
as  a  qualification  to  serve  as  a  justice/judge  and  placing 
greater emphasis on years of experience; or
Alternatively:
 
Raising  the  age  to  preside  over  statutory  county 
1. 
courts  and  statutory  probate  courts  from  25  to  30 
years;
 
Requiring  justices  of  the  peace  and  municipal 
judges  (not  a  court  of  record)  to  be  at  least  25 
years old if the justice/judge is a licensed attorney 
or 30 years old if the justice/judge is not a licensed 
attorney; and
 
Requiring municipal judges (court of record) to have 
the same qualifications as a district judge.

2. 

3. 

iii. 

iv. 

 
Requiring  Justices  of  the  Peace  in  counties  with  a 
population  exceeding  500,000  to  be  licensed  attorneys; 
and
Increasing  the  required  number  of  years  of  service  as  a 
 
practicing  attorney  or  judge  to  twelve  years  to  serve  as 
an appellate justice/judge and to eight years for a district 
judge. 

c. 

Increasing  judicial  compensation  to  an  amount  sufficient  to 
 
“attract  the  most  highly  qualified  individuals  in  the  state,  from 
a  diversity  of  life  and  professional  experiences,  to  serve  in  the 
judiciary  without  unreasonable  economic  hardship  and  with 
judicial independence unaffected by financial concerns;” 

1  Points of view expressed herein are those of the Texas Judicial Council and do not necessarily 
represent the official position of policies of the State Justice Institute. 

2

Civil Justice Committee

2. 

Examine the structure and jurisdiction of the courts to increase efficiency by:
 
a. 

 
Simplifying the trial court structure by establishing consistent jurisdiction among the various trial courts 
across the state, as follows:

i. 
ii. 

iii. 

Increasing the civil jurisdictional floor for district courts from $200 to $10,000;
 
Increasing the civil jurisdictional floor for the statutory county courts in Sec. 25.0003, Tex. Govt. 
Code, from $200 to $5,000;
 
For counties with increased qualifications for justices of the peace to require being a practicing 
attorney, increasing the maximum civil jurisdiction of the justice courts from $10,000 to $20,000; 
and

b. 

 
Simplifying the court of appeals’ structure in an effort to improve jurisprudence and reduce the need for 
transfer among the courts of appeals;

3. 

4. 

Clarify the unauthorized practice of law and barratry statutes to differentiate between providing legal information 
 
and legal advice and to authorize legal assistance software applications that provide legal information; and

duty,  25% as a defendant in a traffic ticket and 12% for a family law 
case. 

•  80% of those surveyed agreed that judges should assess a defendant’s 
risk  factors  such  as  age,  prior  convictions  and  current  crime  to 
determine the bond for a criminal defendant.

The committee also released a report and recommendations laying out the 
following recommendations.

Improving the Judiciary’s Response to Disaster Emergencies
1. 

 
The  Legislature  should  amend  Government  Code  Sec.  22.0035(b)  to 
permit the Supreme Court the discretion to issue orders modifying or 
suspending court procedures up to 60 or 90 days for an initial emergency 
order and/or renewals rather than the 30 day time limit that is currently 
in statute. The statute should also be amended to allow the Chief Justice 
to authorize renewals of emergency orders without seeking a full vote 
of the court for each renewal.
 
The  Legislature  should  amend  Local  Government  Code  Sec.  292.001 
to assist justice courts in times of disaster and provide them a regional 
source to turn to, such as the regional presiding judge, when they need 
the authority to operate in another precinct or county during a time of 
disaster.
 
The Legislature should amend Government Code Secs. 24.003, 25.0019, 
and  26.009  to  allow  the  presiding  judge  of  the  region  to  designate 
an  alternate  location  for  proceedings  that  is  outside  of  the  district  or 
county during times of an emergency.

2. 

3. 

11

4. 

 
The Legislature should explicitly authorize the district courts to hold court outside of the county seat at a facility 
designated for that purpose by Local Government Code Sec. 292.001 even when there is not an emergency.

Sexual Harassment Training
1. 

 
All  judges  and  their  staffs  should  receive  training  about  sexual  harassment  and  other  rules  and  procedures 
concerning human resources. The training should be provided as part of a judge’s initial training requirements 
and at least every two years thereafter.
The Texas Judicial Council should create a task force to study and address the issue of sexual harassment in the 
 
Judiciary.

State Commission on Judicial Conduct
1. 

The Legislature should require the State Commission on Judicial Conduct’s annual report to include the number 
 
of complaints that have been deferred pending criminal investigation and the number of complaints referred 
to law enforcement.
 
The Legislature should require the State Commission on Judicial Conduct to include on its website an index of 
pending cases by case number that includes the current status of each case and the age of each pending case.
 
The Legislature should require the State Commission on Judicial Conduct to post simple directions on its website 
with instructions about how to file a complaint, map out in clear and concise detail how a complaint makes its 
ways through the process from filing to resolution, and clarify that confidentiality regarding a complaint applies 
to the Commission and not to the complainant.

Court Security
1. 

 
The Legislature should amend relevant statutes to keep a judge’s home address confidential in campaign and 
ethics filing records.
 
The Legislature should require the Department of Motor Vehicles to maintain the confidentiality of license plate 
and vehicle information for each judge and judge’s spouse.
 
The  Legislature  should  continue  to  provide  resources  to  the  Court  Security  Division  of  the  Office  of  Court 
Administration to maintain and comply with requirements of the Judge Julie Kocurek Judicial and Courthouse 
Security Act of 2017.

Recusal
The  Supreme  Court  should  amend  the Texas  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  to  create  a  presumption  against  recusal  for 
contribution reasons as long as a judge has complied with the Judicial Campaign and Fairness Act’s contribution 
levels.

2.

Community Engagement
The  Judicial  Council  and  other  judicial  entities  should  continue  to  seek  opportunities  to  improve  the  judiciary’s 
engagement with the community, which should include hosting summits, developing materials for judges about 
model judicial outreach in communities, and producing materials about civic education.

Office of Court Administration

Executive Operations

The Office of Court Administration (OCA) provides resources and information for the efficient administration of the 
Judicial Branch of Texas.

The Office of Court Administration has been led since May 2012 by Mr. David Slayton, the Administrative Director 
of OCA and the Executive Director of the Texas Judicial Council. Mr. Slayton is supported by an executive assistant, a 
public affairs director, and a team of division directors.

In  an  effort  to  better  communicate  with  the  public  and  court  stakeholders,  the  Executive  Division  oversees  the 
distribution  of  CourTex,  a  monthly  electronic  publication  to  more  than  3,500  stakeholders,  and  social  media  via 
Facebook. It also manages the @TXCourts twitter feed for the Judicial Branch. 

OCA holds quarterly agency-wide staff meetings.

In  FY  2018,  Executive  staff  presented  at  26  Board,  Commission  and  Council  meetings  and  gave  29  educational 
presentations to outside stakeholders. In addition, Executive staff prepared materials for interim legislative hearings 
and David Slayton presented testimony to the following legislative and congressional committees: 

•  U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary - December 6, 2017
•  Texas House General Investigation and Ethics Committee – March 29, 2018
•  U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging – April 18, 2018

Research and Court Services Division

Research and Court Services Duties and Responsibilities

• Provide resources, services, and information to support the efficient operation of courts in Texas 
• Promote judicial data reporting accuracy and compliance • Provide remote language interpreter services 
• Increase compliance with the satisfaction of assessed court costs, fines, and fees 

Collection Improvement Program
Article 103.0033 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure requires cities and counties with a population of over 100,000 
to implement a collection improvement program based on OCA’s Model Court Collection Improvement Program. 
OCA’s Court Services staff provide training and technical assistance to local collections programs to promote their 
compliance with program rules, which are promulgated by the Texas Judicial Council. 

These  rules  have  changed  in  recent  years.  In  January  2017,  changes  to  the  rules  that  govern  how  jurisdictions 
should operate their programs went into effect. The goal of these changes was to provide procedures that will help 
defendants comply with court ordered costs, fines, and fees without imposing undue hardship on defendants and 
their dependents. In June 2018, the Texas Judicial Council made further changes to the rules, which became effective 
in August. These changes address local programs’ reporting of collections data to OCA. 

OCA’s Research and Court Services Division continues to provide technical assistance and support to jurisdictions 
required  by  law  to  operate  a  collections  improvement  program  —  182  programs  across  29  municipalities  and 
39  counties. This  support  is  designed  to  assist  jurisdictions  in  adherence  with  Judicial  Council  rules,  streamlining 
collections processes, compliance with the collections-related requirements of SB 1913 and HB 351 from the 85th 
Legislature (which are summarized here and here), and collections related reporting to OCA. 

Court Consulting
Through OCA’s Court Services Consultant Program, local courts and clerks’ offices can receive training and technical 
assistance on judicial administration matters. Consulting can take place remotely, over the phone, or through site 
visits and at trainings. The following were among the activities of the Court Consultant in FY 2018:

•  Provided technical assistance to the Constitutional County Court in Bee County;
•  Conducted case management training to over 100 attendees at the County Court Assistants Conference; 
•  Provided  training  to  district  and  county  clerks  representing  33  counties  attending  the  Region  8  Spring 

•  Provided  training  to  district  and  county  court  coordinators  attending  the  Rural  Association  for  Court 

•  Developed  a  five-part  webinar-based  training  series  titled “The  Roles  and  Responsibilities  of  Child  Support 

•  Assisted  Judicial  Information  section  staff  on  improving  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  sentencing 

information in criminal and juvenile cases and mental health screening reporting in criminal cases.

Language Access Program
OCA’s Language Access Program provides assistance to courts in communicating with individuals with limited English 
proficiency, giving these individuals meaningful access to their legal proceedings through audio or video remote 
interpreting provided by the Texas Court Remote Interpreter Service staff. 

During  FY  2018,  OCA’s  two  remote  interpreters  provided  free  Spanish  interpretation  services  in  659  hearings. 
Additionally, staff were involved in the following translation projects:

Judicial Information
OCA’s Judicial Information Section is the repository for a variety of information regarding courts in Texas. The Judicial 
Information section collects and maintains information from courts at all levels, analyzes court data, and produces or 
assists in the production of reports regarding the state’s courts and the officials who work in them.

In FY 2018 the Judicial Information section was involved in the following activities: 

• 

Implementation of and training on new reporting requirements pursuant to the following changes in law:
o   SB  1326,  as  it  relates  to  reporting  on  mental  illness/intellectual  disability  assessments  and  competency 

evaluation reports; 

o   SB 1893, as it relates to the workload of the presiding judges of the state’s 11 administrative judicial regions; 
o   SB 291, as it relates to writs of attachment related to criminal cases; and 
o   SB 1913, as it relates to the reporting of show cause hearings held prior to the issuance of a capias pro fine. 
•  Conducted the annual update of the Texas judicial directory database, which contains information for more 
than 2,800 courts and more than 7,300 court system personnel, and produced the 2018 Texas Judicial System 
Directory. 

•  Conducted the annual update of the content for the Annual Statistical Report for the Texas Judiciary, which 
includes statistics for appellate and trial courts and analyses of case activity and trends in filings and other 
measures of court workload.

•  Produced the 2017 Annual Report on Disposition of Judicial Bypass Cases by Trial Courts.
•  Supported the work of the Judicial Council’s Data Committee.
•  Supported the Judicial Compensation Commission with data on judge demographics, salaries and turnover 

rates.

•  With assistance of the Research and Court Services Division’s Court Services Consultant, devoted attention to 

improving the quality of the sentencing information collected for criminal and juvenile cases.

A significant portion of Judicial Information staff time is also devoted to providing support to the trial courts and 
clerks  and  their  information  technology  staff  or  case  management  vendors  on  reporting  issues  to  promote  data 
quality and completeness. During the year, staff made 12 presentations to statewide and regional clerk and court 
organizations.

Court Security Division
SB 42 was passed by the 85th Legislature. Known as the “Judge Julie Kocurek Judicial and Courthouse Security Act of 
2017,” the Act is designed to improve the security of judges at all levels, both in their courthouses and at their homes.  
The new law does the following: 

•  Provides for the suppression of the residence address of a judge and judge’s spouse in records maintained by 
the Texas Ethics Commission, a county registrar, and a county appraisal district. The law also allows a judge and 
judge’s spouse to replace their home address on their driver’s license with the address of the courthouse in 
which the judge serves; 

•  Requires county clerks, upon the written request of a judge, to omit or redact personal information from an 

online database that is made public; 

•  Requires that a courthouse security committee be established by the presiding judge of a municipality or the 

local administrative district judge in each county, respectively; 

•  Establishes a $5.00 filing fee on any civil action or proceeding requiring a filing fee to generate revenue to 

support judicial and court personnel training; 

•  Transfers responsibility for reporting security incidents to OCA from the local administrative judge to the law 

enforcement official responsible for providing court security; 

•  Requires  any  person  providing  security  to  hold  a  court  security  certification  issued  by  a  training  program 

approved by the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement; and 

•  Authorizes any commissioned peace officer in the state to provide personal security to a judge, regardless of 

the location of the law enforcement agency that employs or commissions the peace officer. 

18

This new law also established a Court Security Division at OCA and provided for the hiring of a Court Security Director. 
The purpose of the Court Security Division is to: 

•  Support the establishment of court security committees through training and technical assistance; 
•  Assist  courts  with  conducting  and  reviewing  security  and  emergency  preparedness  assessments  and 

developing improvement plans; 

•  Support the implementation of privacy protections for judges by facilitating the restriction of public access to 

the residence address of a judge or judge's spouse; 

•  Oversee the collection of court security incident reporting; and 
•  Serve as a clearinghouse of information regarding the new law and judicial and court security best practices. 

OCA’s Court Security Director began work in late 2017 and since then has been travelling around the state providing 
training  to  judges,  law  enforcement  representatives,  county  officials,  and  others;  conducting  courthouse  security 
assessments; assisting in the establishment of courthouse security committees and security improvement plans; and 
assisting judges in addressing their personal security-related concerns.

Problem-Solving Courts Consultant
In  FY  2018,  the  OCA  Problem-Solving  Courts  Consultant  (PSCC)  continued  representing  OCA  by  attending  and 
participating  in  specialty  court-related  meetings  and  conferences  sponsored  by  a  diverse  body  of  stakeholders, 
including but not limited to, the Texas Veterans Commission (TVC), the National Association of Drug Court Professionals 
(NADCP), the Texas Association of Specialty Courts (TASC), the Conference of Chief Justices and Conference of State 
Court  Administrators  (CCJ-COSCA),  the  Governor’s  Criminal  Justice  Division  (CJD)  and  Specialty  Courts  Advisory 
Council (SCAC), the Center for Court Innovation (CCI), and TDCJ Reentry Task Force. 

In  April  2018,  the  PSCC  began  serving  as  the  Specialty  Court  Ombudsman,  at  the  request  of  the  Office  of  the 
Governor, to be a single point-of-contact for specialty court participants and team members to report complaints/
concerns about program operations, processes, and individual team members, including the specialty court judge. 
As Ombudsman, three calls were received, all of which were successfully resolved. Staff continue conversations with 
CJD on the development of a statewide case management system (CMS) for specialty courts.  As part of outreach, the 
PSCC visited the Bell County Veterans Treatment Court by invitation.

includes civil filings accepted through the eFile system.

Working with Tyler Technologies, OCA implemented the Supreme Court order, opening re:SearchTX to judges, clerks, 
and attorneys of record. Tyler Technologies also readied the system for further implementation to additional roles 
including licensed attorneys (not of record) and registered users. This includes the addition of security for the various 
roles  as  well  as  both  manual  and  automated  methods  for  courts  to  restrict  access  appropriately.  Clerks  have  the 
option to interact with re:SearchTX in a manual (repository) or integrated model. The integrated model allows clerks 
to perform functions as they normally do through case management. The case management system will then update 
re:SearchTX with the new information.

eFiling
Working with Tyler Technologies, OCA continued to bring on additional clerk’s offices to criminal eFiling in order to 
support the Court of Criminal Appeals mandate. At the end of FY 2018, 148 counties were live on criminal eFiling, with 
39 of them implementing mandatory eFiling of criminal documents. The counties that have not yet been mandated 
can enable criminal eFiling in a permissive mode. This gives the clerks’ offices and attorneys the ability to try out the 
process and work out any issues ahead of the mandatory date. The criminal mandate will be statewide in January 
2020.

Price of Justice (Fines and Fees)
Information Services, partnering with Research and Court Services, began working on the development of a system 
to reduce the number of people jailed for the inability to pay court costs and fines. The first phase of the system will 
provide an ability to pay calculator to provide judges needed data to make a recommendation on alternatives to 
payments. 

PRAISTX
Also  partnering  with  Research  and  Court  Services,  Information  Services  completed  the  initial  development  of  a 
risk assessment tool for use in pre-trial bail determiniation. The tool is designed to provide magistrate judges with 
information to make a better decision on the types and level of bonds for individuals accused of a crime. 

Technology Upgrades
Information Services performed several technology upgrades in FY 2018. 

•  Moving  to Voice  Over  IP  (VOIP)  –  this  change  required  OCA  to  add  power  modules  to  the  existing  switch 
environments to support power over ethernet (PoE). The new phone system allows users to be more mobile, 
allowing the phone to ring both the desk phone as well as a person’s mobile phone.

•  Network Security Upgrades – OCA replaced the adaptive security appliances (ASAs) at all our remote locations. 
The change out combines two appliances (private network providers) and our intrusion prevention into a single 
box. The change also expands the ability for court staff in the non-Austin locations to work remotely if needed.
•  Workstation  Replacement  –  OCA  completed  workstation  replacements  for  our  customers.  This  included 

switching most workstations to Windows 10 and upgrading Office and Adobe for all users.

•  Server and Storage Retirement -  With equipment at end of life, Information Services moved all virtual servers 
to the new equipment purchased during the last fiscal year. This resulted in the removal and shrinkage of the 
datacenter from managing 64 physical servers down to 20. 

•  County  Equipment  Donations  –  the  workstations  being  replaced  were  factory  reset  and  made  available 
to  counties  and  municipalities  for  use  in  the  court  system.  Equipment  came  with  the  chassis  (main  box)  a 
keyboard, mouse, and power cord.

Technology Standards
The Technology  Standards  subcommittee  of  JCIT  receives  feedback  from  clerks  and  filers  with  regards  to  eFiling 
codes  and  additional  services  offered  through  the  eFiling  system.  In  FY  2018,  the  subcommittee  collapsed  the 
district/county and justice court codes into a single set. After JCIT made recommendations to the Supreme Court, the 
subcommittee also added the role definitions, permissions and security matrix to the standards. 

Re:SearchTX Recommendations
With the Supreme Court’s adoption of its recommendations, JCIT focused on additional recommendations to further 
expand re:SearchTX. In its May 2018 meeting and June 2018 work session,  JCIT finalized its recommendations to the 
Supreme Court to expand access to re:SearchTX to all licensed attorneys and registered users (the general public). 
JCIT also recommended a security matrix that shows what meta data and documents would be available to registered 
users based on the case type.

Rule 12 Appeals 
The Division provides support to the special committees composed of regional presiding judges who issue decisions 
in appeals filed pursuant to Rule 12 (denial of access to judicial records) of the Rules of Judicial Administration. In FY 
2018, 18 public access opinions were issued. 

Children’s Courts Program 
The Children’s Courts Program encompasses both Child Protection and Child Support Courts throughout the State. 
Currently, there are 24 Child Protection Courts (CPCs) and 43 Child Support Courts (CSCs). The 85th Legislature passed 
legislation creating two additional Administrative Judicial Regions (AJRs) bringing the total from 9 to 11 AJRs. There 
was a shift of some counties covered by CPCs and CSCs resulting in a realignment of several courts. Additionally, 
a  review  of  caseloads  justified  the  need  for  further  realignment  and  restructuring  of  a  few  courts  to  balance  the 
workload among the courts. CPCs and CSCs in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th, and 11th regions were affected by the 
changes. The number of Children’s Courts remains unchanged, but increased CPS caseloads throughout the State 
warrant the need for additional CPCs. OCA is asking the legislature for funding for an additional nine CPCs to address 
the growing need. In FY 2017, OCA received a grant from the Children’s Commission to fund the use of former CPC 
associate  judges  to  sit  as  visiting  associate  judges  to  ensure  judges  experienced  in  CPS  matters  are  available  to 
hear cases in an associate judge’s absence from the bench. Also, in FY 2017, OCA hosted the 2017 CPC Judges and 
Coordinators Meeting, an annual pre-conference meeting to the Child Welfare Judicial Conference, hosted by the 
Texas Center for the Judiciary and the Children’s Commission, and a stand-alone CPC court coordinator training in 
Bastrop, Texas.  As  part  of  outreach,  Anissa  Johnson,  Children’s  Courts  Program  Manager,  conducted  a  site  visit  at 
Child Support Court #19, Hon. Mary Morton, in the 3rd AJR with OCA’s Court Consultant, Aurora Zamora, to discuss 
streamlining court operations. Additionally, Ms. Johnson assisted Ms. Zamora in the development of a five-part Child 
Support Court Coordinator webinar training series. The first segment, Parts I and II, will be aired October 11, 2018 (FY  
2019).

Finance and Operations Division

The Finance and Operations Division manages the fiscal and operational support activities of OCA and administers 
the Collection Improvement Program (CIP) Audit Department.

Division  staff  members  consult  with  OCA  program  managers  on  a  variety  of  financial  and  contractual  issues, 
and  answer  questions  from  the  Legislature,  the  public,  and  other  interested  parties  on  judicial  funding  and  state 
appropriations to the courts and judicial agencies. The division coordinates preparation of the agency’s legislative 
appropriations request and quarterly performance measures.

Finance and Operations staff work with the clerks of the appellate courts on issues related to accounting, purchasing, 
financial reporting, and human resources. The division also provides support to the chief justices of the appellate 
courts and the presiding judges of the administrative judicial regions regarding legislative, budgetary, and human 
resources issues.

The  division  provides  administrative  support  to  the  Office  of  State  Prosecuting  Attorney  (SPA)  via  an  interagency 
contract.  OCA  provides  100%  of  the  processing  for  SPA’s  purchases,  payments,  budgeting  and  other  accounting 
functions. OCA also provides support for facilities functions of the SPA and human resources functions for SPA and 
the Office of Capital and Forensic Writs. 

During  FY  2018  Finance  &  Operations  processed  880  purchase  requisitions,  970  purchase  orders,  1,441  travel 
vouchers, 2,951 purchase vouchers, and 1,057 journal/budget vouchers and 58 payroll vouchers - a total of 7,357 
documents. Division staff also processed 76 reimbursement requests for grants and contracts totaling $6.74 million 
and deposited over $653,314 in fees from licensees. Property and Inventory has processed over 115 surplus items. 
The  Human  Resources  staff  screened  1,378  applications  for  32  job  postings,  and  processed  30  new  hires  and  23 
separations.

Legislative Appropriations Request for 2020-2021
In August 2018, the Office of Court Administration submitted its Legislative Appropriations Request. Agencies were 
authorized to submit a budget request at 2018-2019 baseline levels. The total baseline budget request for 2020-2021 
totaled $153.7 million. Exceptional Item requests totaled $96.5 million. The baseline budget request included $66.4 
million for Texas Indigent Defense Commission (TIDC), plus TIDC Exceptional Item requests totaling $56.4 million.

OCA's  Exceptional  Items  include  seven  funding  requests  that  stem  not  just  from  recommendations  of  the Texas 
Judicial Council but also priorities identified in the Governor's School Safety Initiatives. OCA's Exceptional Items (and 
the biennial cost) include the following:

•  Prevent Fraud and Abuse Committed Against the Elderly and Incapacitated - $5 million. This project will continue 
the guardianship compliance program on a larger, more effective scale. Following the review of approximately 
28,000  guardianship  files,  audits  have  revealed  significant  issues  with  guardians  complying  with  statutory 
requirements and indications of financial exploitation, with 41% of cases being out of compliance. This funding, 
which includes 28.0 FTE's, will allow the program to expand statewide to assist the courts with monitoring 
cases to combat fraud and exploitation. Last session, SB667 was overwhelmingly approved by the Senate and 
House, but the legislation and associated funding was vetoed by the governor.

•  Protecting  Texas  Children:  Create  Additional  Courts  for  Growing  CPS  Caseloads  -  $4.3  million.  The  Regional 
Presiding Judges have identified the need for 9 additional child protection courts based on requests received 
from trial court judges and increases in the CPS filings and caseloads. This item would fund nine new child 
protection courts including 18.0 FTEs.

Fiscal and Organizational Support Activities

• Accounting • Budgeting • CIP Audit • Facilities • Financial Reporting • Human Resources • Management 
• Payroll Property & Surplus • Purchasing • Time & Leave 

25

•  Securing Texas Courthouses and Providing Safety for Texas Judges - $380,000. SB42 required OCA to create the 
Court  Security  and  Emergency  Preparedness  division.  The  85th  Legislature  provided  funding  for  one  FTE 
and associated operating expenses. The Court Security Director has been widely utilized by judges, county 
officials,  and  law  enforcement  to  facilitate  judges’  efforts  to  have  their  personal  information  removed  from 
public databases, review court security protocols, provide technical assistance in court security matters, and to 
connect counties and judges with security resources. The demand for assistance statewide exceeds the ability 
of one person to cover. This request would expand the division by 2.0 FTEs.

•  School  Safety  Initiative:  A  Statewide  Case  Management  System  for  Immediate  Access  to  Critical  Information  - 
$29.7 million. In May 2018, the governor issued the School and Firearm Safety Action Plan, which included 
a  recommendation  that  the  OCA  create  a  statewide  case  management  system,  focused  primarily  towards 
counties with a population less than 20,000, to provide magistrates immediate access to critical information, 
and to speed the timely reporting of court records for federal background checks. The inability to collect data 
weakens the state's ability to ensure accurate data, to share data with other state agencies such as DPS, and to 
provide for interaction with state supported technology systems. The funding would provide one-time upfront 
and maintenance costs of a CMS, and 2.0 FTEs to manage the large project.

•  Data Backed Policy Making through Judicial Council Resources - $712,480. The Texas Judicial Council is the policy 
making body of the judiciary, responsible for continuously studying and reporting on the organization, rules, 
procedures and practice, work accomplished, results and uniformity of the discretionary powers of the state 
courts and methods for improvement. Requests for studies continues to increase, yet the TJC has never been 
appropriated funding. The most recent Judicial Workload Study is over 10 years old and needs to be updated 
to determine the need for new district courts. In addition, since most trial judges lack access to staff attorneys 
to assist them in their work, this funding request includes 2.0 FTEs for staff attorneys to assist trial judges in 
analyzing difficult legal issues.

•  Appropriation of Forensic Science Commission Operating Account No. 5173 - $191,800. Senate Bill 298 created 
the Forensic Science Commission (FSC) Operating Account. The FSC is required to license all forensic analysts 
by January 1, 2019, and deposit all fees into this account. This funding request appropriates to the FSC, all 
revenues  received  into  the  account.  The  request  also  seeks  to  provide  the  Forensic  Science  Commission 
Operating Account with estimated appropriation authority. 

•  Restoration of Estimated Appropriation Authority for the Fair Defense Account No. 5073 - $56.4 million. The Texas 
Indigent Defense Commission sees to restore estimated appropriation authority, which was removed for the 
2018-2019 biennium. Estimated authority would give TIDC access to account balances that exist as a result 
of the passage of SB2053, which reallocated a portion of court costs to the Fair Defense Account. In addition, 
the TIDC is requesting 4.0 FTEs, including three policy analysts to enhance TIDC's ability to monitor counties' 
constitutional, statutory, and financial compliance, and one senior staff member dedicated to working with 
counties  to  improve  indigent  defense  by  planning  and  developing  public  defender  and  other  managed 
systems that improve quality, data, efficiency, and accountability.

Collection Improvement Audit Program
In addition to its finance and operational support activities, the division includes the Collection Improvement Program 
(CIP)  Audit  section. The  program’s  purpose  is  to  improve  the  collection  of  court  costs,  fees,  and  fines  imposed  in 
criminal cases.

Article 103.0033 of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires the OCA to determine if cities and counties required to 
maintain  a  program  are  in  compliance  with  the Texas  Administrative  Code  (TAC)  §175.3  requirements.  During  FY 
2018, CIP Audit issued compliance reports for two counties and two cities. The OCA is further required to calculate 
the collection rate of cities and counties within one year of the program implementation in mandatory jurisdictions, 
and during FY 2018, the Audit section issued post-implementation rate reviews for four counties. In FY 2018, the 
OCA’s Research and Court Services Division assumed the responsibility to perform projects to calculate the collection 
rate for new mandatory jurisdictions prior to implementation and again after implementation in compliance with 
Article  103.0033. These  collection  rates  are  gathered  for  analysis  to  help  measure  the  effectiveness  of  collection 
improvement programs over time.

Initially, Article 103.0033 required cities with a population of 100,000 or more, and counties with a population of 
50,000 or more, to implement a collection improvement program. When the program was implemented in FY2005, 
78  cities  and  counties  were  identified  that  met  this  criteria.  As  a  result  of  the  2010  Census,  another  13  cities  and 
counties were added to the CIP, resulting in a total of 91 jurisdictions required to establish and maintain a collection 
program  (62  counties  and  29  municipalities).  However,  in  HB  3167  of  the  85th  Legislative  Session,  the  legislature 
enacted a change to the statute, effective June 1, 2017, to increase the minimum population threshold for a county’s 
participation in the CIP from 50,000 to 100,000. Based on that legislative change, 23 counties are no longer required 
to participate in the CIP, resulting in a total of 68 jurisdictions (39 counties and 29 municipalities) now required to 
establish and maintain a collection program.

The Audit section developed a new audit model that is better suited to Texas’ local government structure in which 
collection  programs  are  under  the  direction  of  several  elected  judges  or  county  officials.  As  a  result,  audit  staff 
revised audit procedures to determine if a jurisdiction is in compliance with Article 103.0033 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure and 1 TAC §175.3. The audit procedures are performed in accordance with government auditing standards 
known as Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS).

In response to the State Auditor’s Office (SAO) audit findings and to meet the legislative directive in Article 103.0033(j) 
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Audit section developed a review methodology to verify CIP program data 
submitted to the OCA from mandated programs. The data review process will test the accuracy of the Total Dollars 
Assessed and Total Dollars Collected on court costs, fees, and fines reported to the OCA as required in 1 TAC §175.4(c)
(2)(C) and (D).

Certification Duties

• Protect and serve the public • Share information on each program’s processes  
• Streamline and standardize procedures and day-to-day operations 

The Judicial Branch Certification Commission (JBCC) was established by the Texas Legislature, 83rd Regular Session, 
in  Senate  Bill  966.    The  nine-member  Commission  oversees  the  certification,  registration,  and  licensing  of  court 
reporters and court reporting firms, guardians, process servers, and licensed court interpreters, and began operations 
on September 1, 2014.  On that date, the Court Reporters Certification Board, Guardianship Certification Board, and 
Process Server Review Board were combined, and the Licensed Court Interpreter program at the Texas Department 
of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) was transferred to the JBCC and Office of Court Administration (OCA).  On June 1, 
2018, the JBCC implemented SB1096 requiring all guardians register with the state, have a criminal background check 
conducted for all potential newly-appointed guardians, and provide online training for all potential newly-appointed 
guardians. JBCC has also registered all pre-existing guardianships appointed prior to June 1st.  On September 1, 2018, 
the JBCC initiated SB36 requiring the registration of guardianship programs throughout the state. JBCC has authority 
to regulate guardianship programs similar to JBCC’s oversight of court reporting firms.

Certification Division End of Year Highlights
This year the JBCC team worked on numerous JBCC projects with the goal of creating efficiency and consistency 
across the regulated judicial professions. Below are some of the highlights and accomplishments in FY 2018.

•  On August 3, 2018, the Commission welcomed Judge William Sowder as the newest member.  Judge Sowder 
previously  served  as  presiding  officer  of  the  Court  Reporters  Advisory  Board  and  is  replacing  Judge  Ben 
Woodward who resigned in April 2018.

•  The  Commission  also  welcomed  Judge  Lori Valenzuela  as  the  new  presiding  officer  of  the  Court  Reporter 

Certification Advisory Board, replacing Judge William Sowder who was appointed to the Commission.

•  The  JBCC  team  implemented  Senate  Bill  43,  85th  Legislative  Session,  which  provided  a  comprehensive 
legislative  review  of  the  Commission’s  statutes  resulting  in  the  Supreme  Court  Adoption  of  updated  and 
revised JBCC rules for the regulated professions.

•  The  JBCC  team  implemented  SB  1096  which  requires  that  a  statewide  guardianship  registration  system  be 
established, that all guardians (including family guardians) complete an online training course before being 
appointed, and that criminal background checks be run on all individual guardians. Even though the registration 
requirement  just  began  on  June  1,  2018,  over  12,566(+)  guardians  have  entered  the  online  registration 
information  with  OCA  and  3100  (+)  individuals  or “learners”  have  completed  the  online  training  program. 
OCA will soon implement the connection with DPS so that law enforcement can have access to the registry 
information in the case that law enforcement encounters an individual who is under guardianship.  JBCC staff 
is also working with the National Center for State Courts (NCSC) to translate the guardianship training into 
Spanish.

•  On September 1, 2018, the JBCC team initiated the registration of guardianship programs throughout the state. 
• 
JBCC Rules were developed for the guardianship registration and registration of guardianship programs after 
approval of the advisory boards and interested stakeholders and the JBCC. On April 12, 2018, JBCC Rules were 
adopted by the Supreme Court of Texas.

•  The JBCC team transitioned to a new on-line certification, registration and licensing system.
• 

In FY 2018, the JBCC team administered 162 court interpreter written exams and 128 court interpreter oral 
examinations. The team also administered the guardian written examination to 68 candidates for certification.   

•  On June 2018, extended a contract with the LCI rater to score the interpreter oral examinations.
• 

In FY 2018, the JBCC compliance team opened and investigated 80 complaints against the regulated professions: 
28 court reporters, 37 process servers, 11 guardians, and 4 licensed court interpreter complaints.
•  The agendas for all JBCC meetings can be found at http://www.txcourts.gov/jbcc/meetings-agendas/.

Guardianship Compliance Pilot Project
The Office of Court Administration (OCA) manages the Guardianship Compliance Project (GCP) to provide additional 
resources  to  courts  handling  guardianship  cases.  Guardianship  Compliance  Specialists  (GCS)  review  guardianship 
cases to identify reporting deficiencies by the guardian, review annual reports and accountings, and report findings 
to the court. The GCSs work with the courts to implement best practices in managing guardianship cases, identify 
active and closed cases, and assist with additional services. Assistance is available to courts with probate jurisdiction 
to provide oversight of guardianships at no cost to the county.  The mission of the Guardianship Compliance Program 
is to assist the courts in protecting our most vulnerable citizens and their assets.

Reporting
Attorney Practice-Time Reporting
Beginning  in  2014,  each  attorney  who  accepts  appointments  in  adult  criminal  and  juvenile  delinquency  cases  is 
required to annually submit to each county a statement that describes the percentage of the attorney’s practice time 
that is dedicated to work on those appointed cases. As of November 9, 2018, 3,407 attorneys had completed reports 
for FY 2018. Preliminary results show that the median percentage of practice time devoted to appointed criminal and 
juvenile cases across all counties was about 65%.

Indigent Defense Expenditure Review
Each county is required to annually report by November 1st on the number of indigent cases in each court and their 
associated expenses. Staff conducts a thorough desk review of these reports, which provide the basis for TIDC grants. 
Preliminary results for FY 2018 indicate that indigent defense spending continues to increase statewide. Final figures 
will be published in TIDC’s FY 2018 Annual Report in January 2019.

Appointment and Cost Trends
Since  the  passage  of  the  Fair  Defense  Act  (FDA)  in  2001,  overall  appointment  rates  in Texas  continue  to  increase 
statewide. This is especially true of misdemeanor appointments, which have nearly doubled over the last 15 years. 
The FDA’s implementation of a framework for the appointment of counsel, including appointment timelines, formal 
appointment lists, and appointment guidelines, has played a crucial role in driving increased access to constitutionally 
required representation.

As  appointment  rates  and  access  to  counsel  increase,  overall  indigent  defense  costs  also  increase.  Since  2001, 
statewide spending on indigent defense has increased nearly $172 million, or about $10 million per year on average. 
As Texas strives to meet its constitutional and statutory indigent defense obligations, the costs for these services will 
likely continue to increase. Preliminary estimates indicate this trend continued in FY 2018 and expenditure data for 
the year will be published in the TIDC Annual Report in January 2019.

Monitoring Program
Policy Monitoring
Policy monitoring reviews seek to promote local accountability and compliance with the requirements of the FDA and 
to provide technical assistance to improve county indigent defense processes where needed. A county is selected for 
on-site monitoring review based on a combination of objective risk assessment scores and geographical distribution. 
A monitoring review may also be conducted at the request of an elected state or local official. On-site policy reviews 
measure  a  jurisdiction’s  compliance  with  the  six  core  requirements  of  the  FDA.  In  FY  2018, TIDC  staff  conducted 
full scope reviews in three counties, limited scope reviews in three counties, follow-up reviews to prior visits in five 
counties, and informal drop-in reviews in two counties. 

Fiscal Monitoring 
Fiscal monitoring reviews are conducted to ensure that all payments to counties are made in compliance with state 
law.  An  on-site  fiscal  monitoring  review  includes  interviews  with  local  officials  and  staff  and  an  examination  of 
financial documents. In addition to full fiscal reviews, the fiscal monitor provides technical assistance to ensure that 
reported data is accurate and complete. In FY 2018, TIDC staff conducted on-site reviews in seven counties follow-up 
reviews in one county, desk reviews of four counties, and technical assistance in one county.

Recommendations to the 86th Legislature
TIDC’s Legislative Appropriations Request for FY20/21
Pursuant to Section 79.033, Government Code, TIDC submitted its Legislative Appropriations Request (LAR) separate 
from the Office of Court Administration. The full LAR is available at http://www.tidc.texas.gov/media/57981/tidc-lar-
fy2020-2021.pdf and includes one exceptional item and one rider revision:

1.  Restore Estimated Appropriation Authority. Approximately $15 million per year in additional funds is flowing 
into the Fair Defense Account due to the passage of SB 2053 from the 85th Legislature. This request would 
appropriate these funds so that TIDC could help counties fix systemic indigent defense problems.

2.  Lift the Administrative Cap. TIDC requests revisions to riders in the appropriations bill to lift the cap on the 
amount of funding that may be spent on administration and the number of staff it may employ. Lifting the cap 
and slightly expanding the administrative budget will allow TIDC to meet monitoring, funding, and technical 
assistance needs.

Legislative Proposals to Improve Indigent Defense
TIDC is charged in Section 79.035, Texas Government Code, with recommending to the legislature ways to improve 
Texas’s  indigent  defense  system.  After  careful  review  of  each  proposal  and  with  the  assistance  of  a  stakeholder’s 
workgroup, the TIDC Board approved six ideas for legislative consideration. The proposals include clarifying the statute 
that prioritizes appointment of a public defender’s office, as well as to specifically provide for a limited scope attorney 
appointment to represent an arrestee at the Article 15.17, Code of Criminal Procedure, hearing (“magistration”).

Resources, Publications, and Education
TIDC makes available indigent defense information that enhances understanding of the FDA and provides tools and 
resources  that  can  help  improve  indigent  defense  in Texas. The  Commission  serves  this  function  in  several  ways, 
including through its website, trainings, presentations, site visits, studies, e-newsletters, and other outreach described 
below.

Resources 
TIDC’s website provides access to the data that drives its work, as well as information about indigent defense. Local 
data is available via the website at http://tidc.tamu.edu/public.net.

Publications 
TIDC developed and issued the following three publications to assist local officials and other stakeholders:  

Primer on Managed Assigned Counsel Programs (September 2017) – Describes the operations of managed assigned 
counsel (MAC) programs in Texas, the benefits of the MAC model, and how county officials can establish and operate 
a MAC. The report is at:  http://www.tidc.texas.gov/media/57815/tidc_primer2017.pdf

Managed  Assigned  Counsel  Programs  in  Operation  (February  2018)  –  A  supplement  to  the  Primer  on  Managed 
Assigned  Counsel  Programs.  Describes  in  detail  the  operations  of  managed  assigned  counsel  (MAC)  programs  in 
Lubbock, Travis, and Collin Counties, as well as San Mateo, California, and Massachusetts. The publication is designed 
to provide useful information for developing a MAC program plan, determining staffing levels, and establishing a 
budget based on a county’s specific jurisdictional needs and capacity. The report is at:  http://www.tidc.texas.gov/
media/57919/tidc_primersup2017.pdf 

Fair  Defense  Laws  2017-2019  (February  2018)  –  Compilation  of Texas  statutes  and  administrative  rules  related  to 
the Fair Defense Act and appointment of counsel in criminal case, including commentary. Updated to include all 
legislation  passed  by  the  85th  Legislature  (2017).   The  report  is  at:      http://www.tidc.texas.gov/media/57916/tidc-
fairdefenselaws-fy17-19.pdf 

36

Training
In FY 2018, TIDC staff and members trained about 700 judges, county officials, pretrial services officers, and attorneys 
at 16 different training events.

Robert O. Dawson Indigent Defense Distinguished Service Award
TIDC bestowed its highest honor, the Robert O. Dawson Award, upon Jim Bethke in March 2018 in recognition of 
his outstanding work to improve indigent defense in Texas. Mr. Bethke served as TIDC’s founding executive director 
from  2002  (when  it  was  created  as  the Texas Task  Force  on  Indigent  Defense)  until  2017.  During  his  tenure, TIDC 
substantially increased state funding to county-based indigent defense systems, partnered with counties to build 
innovative defense programs, and oversaw the development of a data system that has made Texas a leader in data-
driven indigent defense provision.

Innocence Program 
In 2005, the Texas Legislature directed the Commission to contract with four public law schools to operate innocence 
projects: The University of Texas School of Law, Texas Tech University School of Law, the Thurgood Marshall School 
of Law, and the University of Houston Law Center. In 2015, the 84th Legislature expanded funding for innocence 
projects to include the University of North Texas Dallas College of Law and the Texas A&M University School of Law in 
Fort Worth. These projects organize law students who work with attorneys to review claims of actual innocence from 
Texas inmates. The annual reports filed by the participating innocence projects, as well as Exoneration Reports and 
other information on the innocence program, are available on the Commission’s website in the “Innocence Program 
Overview” section. 

The Texas Indigent Defense Commission is a permanent 
standing committee of the Texas Judicial Council.

Forensic Science Commission

Forensic Science Commission Duties

• Investigate allegations of negligence and/or misconduct • Administer the State Crime Laboratory Accreditation Program 
• Administer the Forensic Analyst Licensing Program 

The Texas  Legislature  created  the Texas  Forensic  Science  Commission  (“Commission”)  during  the  79th  Legislative 
Session by passing House Bill 1068.  HB 1068 amended the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure to add Article 38.01, 
which  describes  the  composition  and  authority  of  the  Commission.  The  Commission  is  required  to  investigate 
allegations  of  professional  negligence  or  professional  misconduct  that  would  substantially  affect  the  integrity  of 
the results of a forensic analysis conducted by a crime laboratory. The Legislature also requires the Commission to 
develop and implement a reporting system through which accredited laboratories report professional negligence or 
misconduct.  

During subsequent legislative sessions, the Texas Legislature further amended the Code of Criminal Procedure to 
clarify and expand the Commission’s jurisdictional responsibilities to include oversight of the State’s crime laboratory 
accreditation.  During the 85th Legislature, the administrative attachment of the Forensic Science Commission was 
transferred from Sam Houston State University to the Office of Court Administration. The Legislature also required the 
licensure of forensic analysts by the Commission and created a dedicated account in the general revenue fund for fees 
collected for the issuance and renewal of forensic analyst licenses. The funds can only be used by the Commission for 
the administration and enforcement of its mission. 

The Commission is also actively engaged in various forensic development initiatives and works collaboratively with 
stakeholders in the criminal justice system to improve education and training in forensic science and the law. 

Forensic Science Commission Members
The  Commission  has  nine  members  appointed  by  the  Governor.  Seven  of  the  nine  commissioners  are  scientists 
and two are attorneys (one prosecutor nominated by the Texas District and County Attorneys Association and one 
criminal defense attorney nominated by the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association).

•  The Commission added a Senior Scientific Advisor to its staff in November 2017 to provide scientific support to 

staff and Commission members.

•  Commission staff published the Commission’s Forensic Analyst licensing rules in July 2018; Forensic Analysts 

must be licensed in accordance with the rules by January 1, 2019.

•  The Commission reviewed and approved the first Code of Professional Responsibility for Forensic Analysts in 

• 

the State.
In August 2018, Governor Abbott reappointed five members to the Commission—Barnard, Daniel, Johnson, 
Kerrigan and Parsons.

•  Commission staff coordinated the administration of over 100 general forensic examination sessions for the 
General Forensic Analyst and Technician Licensing Exams and is expected to issue over 1,000 forensic licenses 
before December 31, 2018.

•  The Commission created a working group to establish a Texas-based accreditation program for crime scene 
reconstruction activities as well as for updating crime scene training for all peace officers in collaboration with 
TCOLE. 

•  Staff traveled to various conferences and trainings throughout the fiscal year to provide information on current 

forensic issues and the impending forensic analyst licensing requirements.

•  Commission  staff  has  begun  discussions  regarding  the  creation  of  a  forensic  science  bench  book  to  assist 

judges with their gatekeeping duties.

•  The  Commission  is  sponsoring  a  symposium  on  probabilistic  genotyping  software  (STRMix),  issues  in 

developmental validation and related legal issues.  

The agendas for all Forensic Science Commission meetings can be found at http://www.txcourts.gov/fsc/meetings/.

Commission’s main goal:

Improve the integrity and reliability of 
forensic science in Texas courts.

The State Law Library

The State Law Library (SLL) was established as the law library for the Supreme Court in 1854 and was expanded to 
include direct service to the public in 1971. In addition to providing research support to the courts and the public, the 
State Law Library offers a centralized, cost-effective research facility staffed by legal research experts for the Office of 
the Attorney General and all other state agencies.

The SLL’s  primary responsibility is to make legal information accessible to all researchers. In the last several years, the 
library has focused on making legal resources available to all Texans throughout the state via its website. The library’s 
website is a portal that gathers primary law resources and additionally provides access to secondary sources that 
assist in understanding the law and putting it to practical use. The staff of professional librarians enhances the value 
of these resources by identifying pertinent information and presenting it in an accessible form for our patrons. Using 
the library’s print collection and these online resources, staff provides responses to patrons in the library or via phone, 
email, or mail.

Since FY 2014, the library has continued to increase the digital resources made available via its portal. Because its 
mission  is  to  make  legal  information  accessible  to  all  and  to  be  a  partner  in  the  access  to  justice  movement,  the 
library offers a wide variety of resources. Some of the resources are geared to legal professionals, who may be able 
to provide low cost or pro bono services because they have access to the legal treatises beyond what they regularly 
use  in  their  practice. The  National  Consumer  Law  Center  treatises,  the  immigration  materials  from  the  American 
Immigration Lawyers Association, and the Texas-specific Matthew Bender treatises are examples of this category of 
resource. For patrons with no legal experience, the Legal Information Reference Collection provides consumers with 
plain language explanations of the law and practical solutions to everyday problems. Everyone, from high school 
students to judges, can find valuable information in the Hein Online law library journal databases and our hornbooks 
and “nutshell” series. 
 

• 12 FTEs • Administered by the State Law Library Board • Board members designated by: 

• Supreme Court • Court of Criminal Appeals • Office of the Attorney General

Public response to the library’s digital 
offerings  has  been  enthusiastic  and 
the  program’s 
widespread.  Since 
12,393  patrons 
inception,  over 
have  registered  to  use  the  service, 
representing  over  833  cities  and  217 
counties  throughout  Texas.  Library 
staff have made several presentations 
on  the  new  services  to  legal  groups, 
court  staff,  and  public 
librarians 
throughout the state.

One of the most popular services the 
library  provides  on  its  website  is  a 
growing collection of subject-specific 
research  guides  (LibGuides)  to  help 
patrons easily locate digital resources 
on  a  specific  topic.  Librarians  have 
created  custom  LibGuides  to  help 
patrons  quickly  find  information  on 
commonly asked-about subjects such 
as  landlord/tenant  law,  homeowners’ 
issues, 
family 
associations, 
debt  collection,  and  more.  These 
guides  provide  direct  links  to  digital 
resources and ebooks on the selected 
topics,  saving  researchers  time  and 
frustration.

law 

Because many patrons are looking for basic information but do not know how to get started, the LibGuides feature 
has  proven  to  be  wildly  successful  due  to  the  simplicity  with  which  it  presents  relevant,  helpful  information. The 
popularity of our LibGuides has continued to grow steadily. Yearly LibGuide usage has increased by 30% every single 
year since the inception of the program in FY 2014.

The  combination  of  rising  publication  prices  and  a  continuous  reduction  in  appropriations  for  print  and  digital 
materials has forced the Library to make difficult decisions regarding its print collection. In order to maintain the 
highly successful Remote Access Program, the library had to make significant cuts to the core legal resources it houses. 
Allowing patrons across the state to consult legal materials digitally through the library website is a high priority, and 
the library has made the necessary adjustments in purchasing in order to continue this valuable initiative.

Office of the State Prosecuting Attorney

State Prosecuting Attorney Duties

• With exclusive jurisdiction before the CCA, the State Prosecuting Attorney scrutinizes all decisions adverse to the State 
issued by Texas’ fourteen courts of appeals to ensure they faithfully follow the law and to identify significant issues requiring 
resolution by the Court of Criminal Appeals. 

The  Office  of  the  State  Prosecuting  Attorney  represents  the  State  of Texas  in  all  proceedings  before  the  Court  of 
Criminal Appeals (CCA), either independently or with the assistance of elected prosecutors, and may represent the 
State in criminal cases before the fourteen courts of appeals.

The  Office’s  duties  are  carried  out  by  the  State  Prosecuting  Attorney,  Stacey  M.  Soule,  and  two  assistant  State 
Prosecuting Attorneys, John  R. Messinger and Emily Johnson-Liu.

The Office reviews all courts of appeals’ opinions decided against the State and selects issues of the greatest importance 
to Texas’ criminal jurisprudence to bring before the Court of Criminal Appeals by way of petition for discretionary 
review (PDR). Once granted, briefs are filed, and, in exceptional cases, oral argument will be presented. The Office 
works closely with local district and county attorneys and special prosecutors across the State to identify emerging 
issues and develop prosecutorial strategies that will ensure that justice is achieved within a fair and efficient system.

To keep judges, criminal-law practitioners, and the public abreast of PDR issues granted by the Court of Criminal 
Appeals, the Office writes and posts objective summaries on its website (www.spa.texas.gov) and Twitter feed (@
OSPATX). The website also contains a library of our publications and CLE materials.

Statistical Highlights from the 2018 Fiscal Year

•  Filed 11 petitions for discretionary review, 28 briefs, 7 motions for rehearing, and 4 amicus briefs.
•  Reviewed approximately 225 opinions from the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeals, and Texas’ 

Courts of Appeals.

•  Consulted and advised hundreds of prosecutors, defense attorneys, and the public.
•  Assisted with drafting and editing petitions and briefs.
•  Authored papers and presented at several continuing legal education conferences about pending issues before 
the CCA, recent decisions from the U.S. Supreme Court and CCA, and prosecutor disclosure duties under Brady 
v. Maryland, the Michael Morton Act, and the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct.

•  Presented on search and seizure and traffic stops to numerous rural prosecutors and law enforcement officers.
•  Served on various committees related to criminal law issues.
•  Published a Statutory Interpretation Case-Law Update of Court of Criminal Appeals’ decisions from its 2017 

Term to the 85th Legislature.

•  Provided testimony before, and consultation services to, the 85th Legislature.

State Commission on Judicial Conduct

State Commission on Judicial Conduct Duties

• Issues discipline when necessary • Dismisses cases when appropriate  • Provides informal ethics advice to judges, court 
clerks, staff attorneys, interns and others at judicial training programs across the State of Texas 

The State Commission on Judicial Conduct reviews every allegation of misconduct made against a Texas judge.

Organization
The State Commission on Judicial Conduct was created in 1965 by an amendment to Article V of the Texas Constitution. 
The  Commission  is  the  independent  judicial  branch  agency  responsible  for  investigating  allegations  of  judicial 
misconduct or permanent disability, and for disciplining judges.

The  Commission’s  jurisdiction  includes  all  sitting Texas  judges,  including  municipal  judges,  justices  of  the  peace, 
criminal magistrates, county judges, county courts-at-law judges, statutory probate judges, district judges, appellate 
judges,  masters,  associate  judges,  referees,  and  retired  and  former  judges  who  consent  to  sit  by  assignment  and 
judges pro tempore. The Commission has no jurisdiction over federal judges and magistrates, administrative hearing 
officers for state agencies or the State Office of Administrative Hearings, or private mediators or arbitrators. Although 
judicial candidates are required to comply with the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, the Commission does not have 
the authority to sanction anyone who was not a sitting judge at the time an offense occurred. Therefore, violations of 
the canons by candidates for judicial office who were not judges at the time of the alleged misconduct are subject to 
review and appropriate action by other authorities such as the State Bar, the Attorney General, the Secretary of State, 
or the local District Attorney.

Disciplinary Actions 
In FY 2018, according to OCA records, more than 3,700 judges were under the jurisdiction of the Commission. 

During FY 2018, the SCJC: 
 

•  Opened 1,593 cases.
• 

Issued  disciplinary  actions  against  79  Texas  judges  through  public  sanction,  private  sanction,  orders  of 
additional education or a combination of a sanction with an order of additional education.

•  Disposed of 5 cases through voluntary agreements to resign in lieu of disciplinary action.
•  Dismissed 1,561 cases as follows: 1,359 were determined to not contain any allegations which, if true, would 
violate  the Texas  Code  of  Judicial  Conduct;  168  were  dismissed  after  investigation;  21  were  dismissed  with 
letters of caution; 4 were dismissed based on the judges’ corrective action; and 9 were dismissed as moot.
•  Resolved 523 cases after a preliminary investigation and 255 after a full investigation (requiring a response 

from the judge).

Office of Capital and Forensic Writs

The  Office  of  Capital  and  Forensic  Writs  (OCFW)  opened  its  doors  in  2010  as  the  state  agency  charged  with 
representing capital defendants in post-conviction litigation. OCFW provides zealous, principled representation to 
indigent individuals who are sentenced to death in Texas to the extent that its resources allow. 

OCFW  investigates  each  case,  exploring  every  relevant  aspect  of  a  client’s  life  story,  medical  and  mental  health 
history, forensic evidence, and the facts of the crime itself. The OCFW then presents the results of its investigation to 
the trial court in an application for writ of habeas corpus raising constitutional claims, which it litigates in evidentiary 
hearings, and in subsequent proceedings before the Court of Criminal Appeals. 

OCFW provides an essential service to the state, the Texas criminal justice system, and its clients by ensuring that 
the administration of the death penalty is constitutionally reliable and valid. It investigates, presents, and litigates 
all potential claims implicating the constitutionality of the death penalty in a particular case, ensuring that these 
fundamental claims are not defaulted and Texas courts can consider them efficiently and fairly. As an institutional 
public  defender  program,  OCFW  benefits  from  economies  of  scale  and  provides  cost-effective  representation  by 
highly-specialized, supervised staff, who deliver mandated services while keeping costs lower than commensurate 
representation delivered by appointed private attorneys. 

The  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  mandates  that  trial  courts  appoint  OCFW  to  represent  capital  post-conviction 
applicants,  if  the  Office  is  able  to  assume  representation.  If  OCFW  is  unable  to  take  a  case,  the  convicting  court 
must appoint a private attorney off of a list of qualified counsel, and the county assumes the financial obligation of 
representation. 

In FY 2018, the OCFW:

Appeals.

•  Represented approximately 70% of the initial capital post-conviction applicants pending before Texas courts.
•  Represented  clients  from  20  different  county  jurisdictions  before  district  courts  and  the  Court  of  Criminal 

•  Presented  evidence  in  support  of  post-conviction  applications  before  numerous  trial  courts  in  evidentiary 

hearings and litigated constitutional issues before the Court of Criminal Appeals.

•  Provided professionally appropriate, competent representation to all clients consistent with guidelines issued 

by the State Bar of Texas. 

Capital and Forensic Writs Essential Duties

• Investigate and identify all facts necessary to present and litigate potential claims of constitutional error.  
• Gather, review, and digest all available materials from the client’s capital trial, including from the trial defense team, the 

state, and the official court records, as well as voluminous records relating to a social, educational, family, medical, 
mental health and court history. • Conduct independent investigation of all facts and circumstances relating to a 
client’s conviction and sentence, including mitigating evidence from a client’s life history. • File motions, briefing, and 
applications for writs of habeas corpus and litigate the constitutionality of a client’s conviction and sentence in Texas 
state habeas proceedings.
