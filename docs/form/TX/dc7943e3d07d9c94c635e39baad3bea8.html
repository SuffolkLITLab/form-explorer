COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS 

he Timothy Cole Exoneration Review Commission recommends that the Legislature consider the 
following proposals:    

ELECTRONIC RECORDING OF INTERROGATIONS 

Require  either  audio  or  audiovisual  electronic  recording  of  interrogations  by  law 
enforcement agencies when investigating all felony cases. 
Require recording to begin when the suspect enters the interrogation room. 
Enforce compliance with new recording requirements by permitting the admission of an 
unrecorded statement only if the judge finds good cause for the failure to electronically 
record  the statement,  and  establishing  a  presumption  that  an  unrecorded  statement  is 
inadmissible as evidence if the judge finds that no good cause exception applies. 

FALSE ACCUSATION/INFORMANT REGULATION 

Require  prosecutor  offices  to  have  written  policies  on  tracking  and  disclosure  of 
impeaching information on jailhouse informants.  
Permit  the  admissibility  of  jailhouse  informants’  complete  criminal  history,  including 
criminal charges that were dismissed or reduced as part of a plea bargain. 
Require  prosecutor  offices  to  establish  an  internal  system  to  track  the  use  of  jailhouse 
informants  including,  but  not  limited  to, cases  in  which  the  jailhouse  informant  offered 
testimony and the benefits provided in those cases. 

FAULTY EYEWITNESS IDENTIFICATION 

Require training for law enforcement officers on eyewitness identification procedures. 
Require making juries aware of prior identifications of the suspect by the witness when an 
in-court identification is made. 
Require  law  enforcement  agencies  to  adopt  the  Bill  Blackwood  Law  Enforcement 
Management Institute of Texas Model Policy. 

FORENSIC SCIENCE PRACTICES 

Encourage  the  Texas  Forensic  Science  Commission  to 
investigate  and  consider 
promulgating  policies  regarding  the  use  of  drug  field  tests  used  by  law  enforcement 
agencies. 
Encourage  the  Texas  Forensic  Science  Commission  to 
promulgating policies regarding the process of crime scene investigations. 
Recommend that crime labs in all cases moving forward complete testing of substances in 
all  drug  cases  regardless  of  the results  of  a  drug  field  test,  and  that  crime  labs  go  back 
through previous cases in which the collected substance was not confirmed by lab testing. 
 

investigate  and  consider

LETTER FROM PRESIDING OFFICER 

The Timothy Cole Exoneration Review Commission was created by the 84th Texas Legislature to 
review  and  consider  various  matters  related  to  wrongful  convictions  within  the  Texas  criminal 
justice  system.   The  Legislation  was  authored  by  Representative  Ruth  Jones  McClendon  and 
sponsored by Senator Rodney Ellis, who were instrumental in its passage.  Commission members 
and advisory members understand and appreciate the importance of this issue, and have tried to 
address the issue with the diligence it deserves.  We have attempted to fulfill the responsibilities 
assigned to us by the Legislature.  Pursuant to House Bill 48, we have compiled and now issue this 
report of our findings and recommendations.   

Commission members and advisory members come from broad and diverse backgrounds.  The 
expertise of each was instrumental in developing the findings and recommendations included in 
this  report.   Each  member  dedicated  significant  time  and  effort  to  complete  the Commission’s 
important assignment of identifying measures to prevent the causes and occurrence of wrongful 
convictions.  

H.B.  48  requires  concurrence  of  seven  of  the  eleven  members  to  issue  a  report.  The 
Commission realized from the start that not every member would agree to every proposed finding 
or recommendation.  In fact, few of the findings or recommendations included in this report are 
supported by all Commission members.  However, because of the Commission’s determination to 
submit a report in accordance with H.B. 48, Commission members wish to make clear that, by 
concurring in the whole of this report, they are not necessarily endorsing any specific finding or 
recommendation herein. Members have been provided the opportunity to include an explanatory, 
concurring,  or  dissenting  statement  regarding  their  individual  positions  on  matters  within  the 
report.   

CKNOWLEDGEMENTS 

The Commission acknowledges the work of Representative Ruth Jones McClendon and Senator 
Rodney Ellis in securing passage of H.B. 48 in the 84th Legislature.  

Commission members express their appreciation to the staff members who made this endeavor 
possible – David Slayton, Wesley Shackelford, Alejandra I. Pena, and Terri Peirce.  The Commission 
also  acknowledges  the  important  contributions  from  its  advisory  members.   The  Commission 
expresses  gratitude  to  those  men  and  women  previously  exonerated,  who  assisted  the 
Commission  by  sharing  their  stories,  together  with  their  valuable  insights  into  these  critical 
issues.  Finally, the Commission has valued the support and encouragement from the family of 
Timothy Cole.

TIMOTHY COLE EXONERATION REVIEW COMMISSION 

The Timothy Cole Exoneration Review Commission (Commission) was created in 2015 by the 84th 
Legislature  with  the  passage  of  House  Bill  48.  The  Commission  was  created  under,  but 
independent from, the Texas Judicial Council and is administratively attached to the Office of Court 
Administration. 

The  Commission’s  charge  is  to  (1)  review  cases  in  the  State  of  Texas  in  which  an  innocent 
defendant was convicted of a crime and then, on or after January 1, 2010, was exonerated; (2) to 
consider potential implementation plans, costs, cost savings, and the impact on the criminal justice 
system  for  each  potential  solution  identified  through  the  work  of  the  commission;  and  (3)  to 
review and update the research, report, and recommendations of the Timothy Cole Advisory Panel 
(TCAP) on Wrongful Convictions established by the 81st Legislature in 2009.  

The Commission’s first public meeting was held on October 27, 2015. The Commission held six 
meetings, all with a quorum of members participating either in person or via teleconference.  

TIMOTHY COLE 

The Commission is named after Timothy Cole, the first Texan to be posthumously exonerated of a 
crime through DNA testing.  

Timothy Cole was a U.S. Army veteran and student at Texas Tech University. At the age of 26, he 
was accused of a rape. 

On  March  24,  1985,  a  Texas  Tech  female  student  was  abducted  and  raped  by  a  perpetrator 
believed to have been the “Tech Rapist,” an unknown serial rapist at that time. The victim reported 
the crime to the police and provided details about her perpetrator’s appearance, which included 
the fact that he had smoked cigarettes throughout the attack.  

Approximately two weeks later, Mr. Cole went to pick up a friend who worked at a pizza restaurant 
near the location of the victim’s abduction. As he was leaving, Mr. Cole interacted with a female 
undercover  officer  and  offered  her  a  ride.  The  woman  declined  the  ride  and  informed  her 
superiors that Mr. Cole resembled the description the victim had provided.  

The next day officers arrived at Mr. Cole’s apartment and took a picture of him. His picture was 
provided in a photo lineup along with five others to the victim of the rape. Mr. Cole’s photograph 
was  the  only  Polaroid  picture,  the  rest  were  mugshots;  additionally,  Mr.  Cole  was  the  only 
individual facing the camera while the others were facing the side. The victim identified Mr. Cole 
as her attacker.  

Mr. Cole was arrested and tried by a jury in Lubbock. His defense team presented evidence of his 
severe asthma and the fact that he did not smoke. They also presented alibi evidence for the night 
of the crime tending to prove that Mr. Cole had been at home studying where his brother had 
been  socializing  with  some  friends.  Similar  criminal  assaults  continued  to  take  place  after  Mr. 

5 

 
 

 

 

 

Cole’s arrest. His attorneys attempted to present this evidence but were denied by the judge. Mr. 
Cole was ultimately convicted of the crime on September 17, 1986, and sentenced by the jury to 
25 years in prison.   

While in prison, Mr. Cole was offered parole if he would admit guilt, but he refused to confess to 
a crime he did not commit.  In 1995, Texas prisoner Jerry Wayne Johnson had begun writing letters 
confessing  to  the  crime for  which  Mr.  Cole  had  been  convicted.  At  the time,  Mr.  Johnson  was 
serving life in prison for two other 1985 sexual assault charges. Mr. Cole passed away in 1999 of 
asthma  complications  while  serving  his  sentence.  In  2007,  Mr.  Johnson  confessed  again  to  the 
sexual assault. DNA testing of biological evidence collected from the crime scene implicated that 
Mr.  Johnson was the actual perpetrator, and that Mr. Cole was, in fact, innocent. 

On April 7, 2009, nearly 10 years after his death, Timothy Cole became the first posthumous DNA 
exoneration in Texas history. On March 1, 2010, Mr. Cole was pardoned by Texas Governor Rick 
Perry.

ESEARCH OVERVIEW

For  purposes  of  this  report,  the  Commission  defines  exoneration  as  a  situation  in  which  a 
defendant  who  was  convicted  of  a  crime  was  later  relieved  of  all  legal  consequences  of  that 
conviction through a decision by a prosecutor, a governor, or a court, after new evidence of his or 
her  innocence  was  discovered.1  The  Commission  gathered  data  and  information  on  Texas 
exonerations from January 1, 2010, to December 1, 2016, in order to determine the areas within 
the  criminal  justice  process  that  were  in  most  need  of  further  research  and  reform  proposals. 
Through  this  analysis,  the  Commission  found  that  Texas  has  had  204  exonerations  during  this 
timeframe. Of the exonerations reviewed, 148 were for drug-related offenses. Fifty-six were for 
non-drug related offenses. The non-drug related exoneration offenses are detailed by offense in 
Figure 1.

ollowing  an  initial  review  of  exonerations  since  2010,  the  Commission  prioritized  the 
review of non-drug related cases given the nature of the crimes and time served for these

offenses,  followed  by  drug-related  cases  which  accounted  for  the  majority  of  the 
exoneration as shown in Figure 2.  The Commission identified the following five research 
topic areas: (1) electronic recording of interrogations, (2) false accusations, (3) jailhouse 
informant regulations, (4) faulty eyewitness identification, and (5) forensic practices. The 
Commission makes recommendations related to each area based on research performed 
and provided to the Commission. Recommendations that may result in additional costs 
are noted so that the 85th Legislature may take such costs into consideration.

TIMOTHY COLE ADVISORY PANEL ON WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS (2010) 

Pursuant  to  H.B.  48,  the  Commission  reviewed  and  updated  the  research,  report,  and 
recommendations of the Timothy Cole Advisory Panel (TCAP) on Wrongful Convictions established 
by the 81st Legislature in 2009. Table 1 presents the recommendations from the 2010 TCAP report 
with their implementation status. 

TABLE 1: Timothy Cole Advisory Panel Recommendations and Implementation Status

was released in December 2011. 

the  82nd 

1.  Require the Bill Blackwood Law Enforcement 

Management Institute of Texas (LEMIT) to work 
with scientific experts in eyewitness memory 
research and law enforcement agencies to 
develop, adopt, disseminate to all law 
enforcement agencies, and annually review a 
model policy and training materials regarding the 
administration of photo and live lineups. The 
model policy should comport with science in the 
areas of cautionary instructions, filler selection, 
double-blind administration, documentation of 
identification procedures, and other procedures 
or best practices. 

2.  Require all law enforcement agencies to adopt 

eyewitness identification procedures that comply 
with the model policy promulgated by LEMIT. 

3. 

Integrate training on eyewitness procedures into 
the required curricula of the LEMIT model policy 
and the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement 
Standards and Education. 

4.  Permit evidence of compliance or noncompliance 
with the LEMIT model policy to be admissible in 
court. 

5.  Allow law enforcement agencies discretion on the 

adoption of sequential procedures.  

Recording Custodial Interrogations 

Not implemented. 

6.  Adopt  a  mandatory  electronic  recording  policy, 
from  delivery  of  Miranda  warnings  to  the  end  of 
interrogations,  for  custodial 
in 
certain felony crimes. The policy should include a 
list  of  exceptions  to  recording  and  the  judicial 

interrogations

the  82nd 

Implemented  during 
legislative 
session via HB 215. Law enforcement agencies 
were  required  to  either  adopt  the  LEMIT 
model  policy  or  one  of  their  own  that 
conformed  to  certain  specified  requirements 
of the bill no later than September 1, 2012. 
Implemented via training curricula changes. 

Implemented  during

discretion to issue a jury instruction in the case of 
an unexcused failure to record.  

Discovery Procedures 

7.  Adopt a discovery policy that is mandatory, 

automatic, and reciprocal, and requires either 
electronic access to or photocopies of materials 
subject to discovery. 

Post-Conviction Proceedings 

8.  Amend the Chapter 64 motion for post-conviction 
DNA testing to allow testing of any previously 
untested biological evidence, regardless of the 
reason the evidence was not previously tested, or 
evidence previously using older, less accurate 
methods. 

9.  Amend the Chapter 11 writs of habeas corpus to 
include a writ based on changing scientific 
evidence. 

Innocence Commission 

10.  Formalize the current work of the Innocence 
Projects that receive state funding to provide 
further detail in the project’s annual reports and 
distribute those reports to the Governor, 
Lieutenant Governor, Speaker of the House, and 
Chairs of the Senate Jurisprudence, House 
Corrections, House Criminal Jurisprudence, and 
Senate Criminal Justice Committees. Report input 
should be solicited from other innocence projects, 
interested bar associations, judicial entities, law 
enforcement agencies, prosecutor associations, 
and advocacy organizations. 

11.  Provide a full-time equivalent staff position for the 
Task Force using the current appropriation or 
other grant funding to administer these 
responsibilities; contracts between the innocence 
projects and the Task Force on Indigent Defense 
should be amended to reflect the new 
administrator and additional responsibilities.

the  83rd 
implemented  during 
Partially 
Legislative  session  via  SB  1611,  the  Michael 
Morton  Act.  The  Act  requires  prosecutors  to 
produce  for  and  permit  photocopying  by  the 
defense  of  witness  statements,  offense 
reports,  and  other 
relevant  evidence. 
Reciprocal  discovery,  however,  was  not 
included in the Act.  

Implemented  during  the  82nd  Legislative 
session via SB 122 to modify the requirements 
for  granting motions for  post-conviction  DNA 
testing  by 
removing  certain  conditions 
regarding the reasons why biological evidence 
was  not  tested  previously,  so  that  testing  of 
any  previously  untested  biological  evidence 
may be granted. 
the  83rd  Legislative 
Implemented  during 
session  via  SB  344  to  permit  a  convicted 
individual  to  file  an  application  for  a  writ  of 
habeas corpus to challenge a conviction based 
on scientific evidence that is now outdated or 
discredited by advances since the trial. 

Implemented  during  the  82nd  Legislative 
session  via  HB  1754  dealing  with  requiring 
exoneration reports.  

Implemented  in  2011  via  the  Texas  Office  of 
Court  Administration/Texas  Indigent  Defense 
Commission budget rider. 

 

 

ELECTRONIC RECORDING OF INTERROGATIONS 

The  sole  recommendation  of  the  2010  Timothy  Cole  Advisory  Panel  (TCAP)  that  was  not 
implemented was the adoption of a statewide policy to record interrogations. The Commission 
continued the analysis of contributing factors to wrongful convictions in cases where individuals 
have  been  exonerated  since  January  1,  2010.  The  Commission  found  that  false  confessions 
continue to contribute to wrongful convictions. In cases where false confessions have resulted in 
wrongful  convictions,  electronic  recording  of  the interrogation  process  can  assist  all  interested 
parties in determining whether or not the interrogation was carried out in an appropriate manner 
and if it resulted in an accurate statement. 

Currently the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure allows written statements of an accused as a result 
of a custodial interrogation to be admitted as evidence, provided the written statement contains 
the statutory warnings listed in Article 38.22.  The statute also requires that oral and sign language 
statements be recorded in certain situations. However, audio and/or video recording under the 
existing statute is only required for a "statement" - not a custodial interrogation. No recording is 
required of interrogations where the suspect gives a written statement and Article 38.22, Section 
3(c), dispenses with the recording requirement altogether if the oral or sign language "statement" 
contains  assertions  of  facts  or  circumstances  that  are  found  to  be  true  and  which  conduce  to 
establish the guilt of the accused. 

Research Highlights 

Twenty-one states, plus the District of Columbia, have either a statute or rule requiring electronic 
recording  of  interrogations.  Of  the  states  with  electronic  recording  requirements,  14  require 
recording for felony-related offenses. Figure 3 shows electronic recording requirements in each 
state.

Information on recording practices in Texas was collected through surveys of law enforcement 
agencies to collect law enforcement opinions and practices, criminal court judges, prosecutors, 
and defense attorneys to collect information on opinions and experience with cases in which an 
electronic  recording  of  an  interrogation  was  introduced  as  evidence.  Appendix  1  provides  the 
surveys and responses.  

The  majority  of  survey  respondents  in  all  categories  responded  that  electronic  recording  of 
interrogations reduces the risk of false confessions. The majority also responded that electronic 
recordings  will  lead  to  better  practices  by  law  enforcement  departments  and  provide  training 
opportunities.  Figure  4  shows  the  percentages  and  actual  number  (“n”  value)  of  judges, 
prosecutors, defense attorneys, and law enforcement departments who do not currently record 
interrogations but responded that electronic recording is beneficial. Additionally, 92 percent of 
responding  law  enforcement  departments  who  record  reported  that  they  already  record 
interrogations for felony-related offenses.

TCERC Electronic Recording Judicial and Law Enforcement Surveys 

The majority of judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys responded that electronic recording 
of  interrogations  allows  the  defense  to  provide  better  client  representation,  allows  the 
prosecution to build stronger cases, and allows judges and juries to have a better understanding 
of  statements  that  were  made  by  the  individual  during  the  interrogation.  Additionally,  these 
respondents agreed that electronic recording can assist in determining if an individual’s statement 
was made freely and voluntarily.

As shown in Figure 5, sixty-eight percent (n=580) of the 850 law enforcement agencies responding 
to  the  survey  reported  that  they  electronically  record  interrogations  in  some  capacity.  Of  the 
respondents who indicated that they record, 267 (46%) were from departments with 10 or fewer 
sworn  officers,  and  313  (54%)  were  from  departments  with  11  or  more  sworn  officers.  These 
survey findings indicate that recording practices are already implemented by many departments 
of varying sizes in the state.

The  survey  responses  show  that  the  cost  for  recording  equipment  was  relatively  inexpensive 
depending on the type of equipment used by the department. The median cost reported by the 
departments was $5,000, and 79 percent of respondents reported that they were purchased using 
their department’s general funds.  

The majority of all respondents, including the departments who do not currently record, agreed 
that electronically recording custodial interrogations will increase the public’s trust in the justice 
system.  Recording  interrogations  allows  for  more  transparent  communication  between  law 
enforcement and the public. Furthermore, 64 percent of all respondents indicated they believe 
that electronically recording interrogations reduces the risk of false confessions and, ultimately, 
the number of convictions of innocent individuals.  

Recommendations  

The  Commission  recommends  that  the  Legislature  consider  the  following  proposals  regarding 
electronic recording of interrogations: 

I. 

II. 
III. 

Require  either  audio  or  audiovisual  electronic  recording  of  interrogations  by  law 
enforcement agencies when investigating all felony cases. 
Require recording to begin when the suspect enters the interrogation room. 
Enforce compliance with new recording requirements by permitting the admission of an 
unrecorded statement only if the judge finds good cause for the failure to electronically 

13 

 
 

 

 

 

record  the statement,  and  establishing  a  presumption  that  an  unrecorded  statement  is 
inadmissible as evidence if the judge finds that no good cause exception applies. 

 

FALSE ACCUSATIONS AND JAILHOUSE INFORMANT REGULATION 

In its 2010 report, The Timothy Cole Advisory Panel (TCAP) did not make recommendations on the 
topic of false accusations; however, it did include specific recommendations for future research 
pertaining  to  jailhouse  informant  testimony.  The  TCAP  emphasized  the  lack  of  safeguards  for 
defendants when a jailhouse informant testifies against them. The TCAP also identified a need for 
more specific guidelines and policies.  

Texas became one of the first states to regulate jailhouse informant testimony with the passage 
of Senate Bill 1681, in 2009, which amended Chapter 38 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. 
The law prohibits convicting a defendant based on testimony of an individual incarcerated in the 
same  correctional  facility  with  the  defendant  unless  the  testimony  is  corroborated  by  other 
evidence connecting the defendant to the offense. In the seven years that SB 1681 has been in 
effect, there have not been any reported cases of wrongful convictions based on false jailhouse 
informant testimony. 

The Commission found that 11 states, including Texas, have reforms in place regulating informant 
procedures. Figure 6 shows informant regulation reforms by state.

Several states have taken action on pretrial discovery practices related to informants.  In addition 
to the corroboration of an informant’s testimony, the State Bar of Texas recently published "Texas 
Criminal  Jury  Charges,"  which  is  a  resource  that  contains  a  form  jury  instruction  on  the 
corroboration requirement mandated by Article 38.075. The form jury instruction can be found 
under Appendix 2.  This form instruction tracks the statute by informing the jury that a defendant 
cannot be convicted solely on the testimony of an in-custody informant.  To support a conviction, 
the  jury  is  instructed  that  the  in-custody  informant's  testimony  must  be  corroborated  with 
evidence  that  tends  to  connect  the  defendant  with  commission  of  the  crime.   While  this 
instruction calls the jury’s attention to the informant’s testimony, it does not provide any specific 
information regarding the circumstances surrounding the informant's situation. 

Illinois imposes a special disclosure procedure related to informants that includes: the complete 
criminal history of the informant; any promise, deal or benefit that has been offered and has been 
made  or  will  be  made  in  the  future;  other  cases  in  which  the  informant  has  testified  and  the 
incentives  he/she  received  in  exchange  for  that  testimony  (if  any);  and  any  other  information 
relevant to the informant’s credibility. Oklahoma and Nebraska have enacted similar statutes. 

Of  the  Texas  exoneration  cases  reviewed  by  the  Commission,  33  percent  of  the  51  non-drug 
related exonerations had false accusation as a contributing factor to the wrongful conviction of 
the individual. The majority of these exonerations were child sex abuse and murder cases. Two of 
the exoneration cases involved jailhouse informant testimony.   

Dr. Alexandra Natapoff, Associate Dean for Research at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, informed 
the Commission that it is her belief that jailhouse informants are incentivized witnesses, which she 
believes makes them potentially highly unreliable. To ensure that the judge, jury, and defense have 
an  accurate  representation  of  the  jailhouse  informant’s  situation  and  to  properly  weigh  the 
credibility of their testimony, Dr. Natapoff stated that it is important for all relevant information 
pertaining to the informant be shared with the judge, jury, and defense.  

Given  the  nature  of  jailhouse  informants,  the  Commission  finds  it  important  that  information 
about  the  informant  be  shared  with  the  judge,  jury,  and  defense,  including  his  or  her  criminal 
history  as  well  as  criminal  charges  that  were  dismissed  or  reduced  as  part  of  a  plea  bargain. 
Currently, jurors are not required to be informed about the informant’s previous charges that may 
have  been  dismissed  or  modified  as  part  of  a  plea  bargain  in  unrelated  cases.  Permitting  the 
admissibility of the informant’s complete history would not result in an expense to either party 
and would likely increase transparency.   

Jailhouse Informant Tracking Procedures 

According to Dr. Natapoff, the majority of jurisdictions do not have a process to track the number 
of informants used or the benefits that are offered in exchange for testimony. 2  She stated that 
this  information  is  important  to  the  proper  evaluation  of  the  validity  of  the  testimony  being

provided.  A  clear  picture  of  an  informant’s  testimony  history  would  provide  information  to  all 
parties in the case.  

Two  district  attorney  offices  with  written  policies  and  procedures  related  to  the  tracking  of 
jailhouse informant information have been identified: Los Angeles County District Attorney and 
Tarrant County Criminal District Attorney. The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office has a 
legal policies manual that includes a chapter on jailhouse informant procedures, which explains 
the  official  process  to  request  to  use  a  jailhouse  informant  through  a  written  application.  See 
Appendix 3 for the manual’s chapter on jailhouse informant information tracking.  

The Tarrant County Criminal District Attorney’s (TCCDA) Office implemented a jailhouse informant 
procedure  effective  June  10,  2016.  Tarrant  County  established  a  central  index  of  jailhouse 
informants,  which  is  regularly  maintained  and  stored  in  an  existing  case  management  system. 
TCCDA’s  procedure  outlines  a  list  of  items  that  the  Assistant  District  Attorney  (ADA)  should 
consider  as  part  of  the  determination  of  whether  or  not  to  use  the  informant.  Disclosure 
requirements,  such  as  requiring  the  prosecutor  to  make  a  written  disclosure  to  the  defense 
attorney  if  a  jailhouse  informant  is  to  be  used,  are  included.  Specific  disclosures  the  ADA  is 
mandated to make to the defense include the informant’s criminal history and proposed offers 
and benefits sought by the informant. If the jailhouse informant testifies, this information is to be 
sent to the ADA responsible for the maintenance of the Jailhouse Informant index and database. 
See Appendix 4 for the complete TCCDA Jailhouse Informant Procedure.  

While Tarrant County uses an existing case management system, an alternative could be the use 
of a spreadsheet as a tracking system. Depending on the resources available, the procedures and 
information  tracking  system  used  can  vary  to  meet  the  needs  of  each  prosecutor’s  office. 
Additional staff time would be required for the implementation and maintenance of a jailhouse 
informant database tracking system; however, no extensive cost has been identified to implement 
this  procedure.  The  goal  of  implementing  a  jailhouse  informant  tracking  system  would  be  to 
provide transparency. 

Recommendations  

The Commission recommends that the Legislature consider the following proposals regarding false 
accusations and jailhouse informant regulation:  

I. 

Require  prosecutor  offices  to  have  written  policies  on  tracking  and  disclosure  of 
impeaching information on jailhouse informants.  

  This  requirement  would  clarify  the  types  of  information  that  must  be  disclosed 
under  the  Michael  Morton  Act  including:  benefits  provided  in  exchange  for 
jailhouse testimony, complete criminal history, other cases in which the jailhouse 
informant  testified,  the  benefits  provided  in  those  cases,  and  other  evidence 
related to credibility.  

16 

 
 

 

 

 

II. 

Permit  the  admissibility  of  jailhouse  informants’  complete  criminal  history,  including 
criminal charges that were dismissed or reduced as part of a plea bargain. 

  Currently, only final felony convictions or crimes of moral turpitude are admissible 
to impeach a jailhouse informant, and jurors do not hear about previous charges 
that may have been dismissed or modified in as part of a plea bargain. 

III. 

Require  prosecutor  offices  to  establish  an  internal  system  to  track  the  use  of  jailhouse 
informants  including,  but  not  limited  to, cases  in  which  the jailhouse  informant  offered 
testimony and the benefits provided in those cases. 
 

FAULTY EYEWITNESS IDENTIFICATION 

The 2010 Timothy Cole Advisory Panel (TCAP) produced five recommendations directly related to 
eyewitness  identification  procedures.  All  five  recommendations  have  since  been  adopted  and 
implemented to some extent. (Please refer to the TCAP Review section of this report for more 
detail.) House Bill 215, 82nd Legislature, implemented four of the five recommendations by adding 
Article  38.20  to  the Code  of  Criminal  Procedure.  Article  38.20  requires  Texas  law  enforcement 
agencies  to  adopt  written  eyewitness  identification  policies  based  on  best  practices.  A  law 
enforcement  agency  may  adopt  the  model  policy  developed  by  the  Bill  Blackwood  Law 
Enforcement Management Institute of Texas (LEMIT) which was released in December 2011. An 
overview of the LEMIT model policy can be found in Appendix 5.  Although the TCAP made progress 
in  studying  faulty  eyewitness  identification  procedure  reforms,  the  Commission  believes  that 
additional reforms are necessary. 

Research Highlights 

The  Commission  found  that  19  states,  including  Texas,  regulate  eyewitness  identification 
procedures  in  some  capacity.  Figure  7  shows  which  states  currently  provide  regulation  of 
eyewitness identification procedures.  

Figure 7 Regulating methods for eyewitness identification procedures

17 

 
 

 

 
The Commission’s review of Texas exoneration cases found that 39 percent of the 56 non-drug 
related cases had faulty eyewitness identification as a contributing factor, making it the leading 
contributing factor for wrongful convictions since January 1, 2010. Robbery and sexual assault are 
the top two offense types in the exoneration cases for which faulty eyewitness identification is a 
contributing factor.   

Texas law enforcement agencies are required by statute to adopt either the LEMIT model policy 
or  their  own  policy.  The  LEMIT  model  policy  recommends  that  the  identification  procedure  be 
documented  in  full.  Video  documentation  is  preferred;  however,  an  audio  recording  is  an 
alternative  option.  The  LEMIT  model  policy  has  the  benefit  of  being  reviewed  and  potentially 
updated annually, which ensures that the policy and related training materials incorporate current 
best practices and research findings. The Commission does not anticipate that the LEMIT model 
policy  would  generate  additional  expenses  to  law  enforcement  and  should  contribute  to  the 
criminal  justice  system’s  continuing  efforts  to  provide  relevant  continuing  education  and 
enhanced best practices in the area of eyewitness identification. 

The Commission polled Texas law enforcement agencies on their current recording practices of 
lineups for eyewitness identifications. Of the 550 respondents who record, 37 percent record the 
lineup identification process. Figure 8 shows the survey responses on law enforcement practices 
for eyewitness identification lineups.

The TCAP recommended that training on eyewitness procedures be integrated into the curricula 
of  the  LEMIT  and  the  Texas  Commission  on  Law  Enforcement  (TCOLE).  After  Texas’  law  was 
enacted in 2011, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) completed a comprehensive review of 
eyewitness identification research and produced a list of recommendations on how courts and 
law  enforcement  can  increase  the  accuracy  and  utility  of  eyewitness  identifications.  The  first 
recommendation  of  the  NAS  report  is  to  train  all  law  enforcement  officers  in  eyewitness 
identification.  The  recommendation  suggests  that  all  law  enforcement  agencies  provide  their 
officers  with  training  that  covers  the  variables  that  affect  vision  and  memory,  practices  for 
minimizing contamination, and effective eyewitness identification protocols.  

Given recent findings and the research that helped produce the NAS’s report recommendations, 
the Commission strongly agrees that training for officers on eyewitness identification procedures 
should  be  required.  Per  Texas  Occupations  Code §1701.351,  peace  officers  are  required  to 
complete at least 40 hours of continuing education every 24-month unit of a training cycle. Up to 
eight hours of continuing education under this section covers recent changes to laws of this state 
and the United States related to peace officers. Because of the existing training requirement for 
peace officers, the Commission does not anticipate a substantial cost to implement training for 
officers on eyewitness identification procedures. Educating officers will not only better prepare 
them  to  serve  their  community,  but  also  positively  impact  the  criminal  justice  system  by 
continuously improving law enforcement practices. 

he NAS report states that the level of confidence at the time the witness makes a selection may 
be more accurate than at the time the witness makes  an identification at trial. The report also 
indicates that confidence levels articulated after an initial identification is made are subject to bias. 
Dr.  Sandra  Guerra  Thompson,  Alumnae  College  Professor  of  Law  and  Criminal  Justice  Institute 
Director at the University of Houston Law Center, informed the Commission of the importance of 
accurate and precise documentation of the identification of a suspect by the witness at the time 
the identification happens. This is referred to as the witness’ confidence level. Dr. Thompson spoke 
about  how  an  identification  expressed  at  trial  could  appear  to  have  been  made  at  a  stronger 
confidence level, because the witness had previously identified the suspect; however, this does 
not mean that the initial identification was made at a strong confidence level. Therefore, the judge 
and jury must be informed about the level at which the first identification was articulated.  

Documenting a witness’s initial confidence level and contemporaneous statements made at the 
time of the initial identification are already a part of the LEMIT model policy. The LEMIT model 
policy instructs the officer conducting the photograph or live lineup that if the witness responds 
that an individual is the person they saw, then the officer should immediately ask the witness to 
explain in their own words how certain they are.  

The Commission agrees it is important to provide jurors with the details of prior identifications 
made  of  the  suspect  by  the  witness  when  an  in-court  identification  is  made.  Jurors  should  be 
aware  of  the  manner  the  procedure  was  conducted,  as  well  as  the  witness’  confidence  level. 
Documenting  this  additional  information  and  providing  it  at  trial  is  not  expected  to  result  in 

19 

 
 

  T

 

 

 

extensive  additional  costs.  The  disclosure  of  this  information  will  not  only  allow  for  better 
judgment  on  the  jurors’  part,  but  provide  law  enforcement  officials  and  our  courts  with  more 
accurate information regarding eyewitness identification.  

Recommendations 

The  Commission  recommends  that  the  Legislature  consider  the  following  proposals  regarding 
faulty eyewitness identification: 

Require training for law enforcement officers on eyewitness identification procedures. 
Require making juries aware of prior identifications of the suspect by the witness when an 
in-court identification is made. This includes: 

a.  The manner in which the procedure was conducted; and 
b.  The witness’ confidence level. 

Require  law  enforcement  agencies  to  adopt  the  Bill  Blackwood  Law  Enforcement 
Management Institute of Texas Model Policy. 

ORENSIC SCIENCE PRACTICES 

The Commission identified the significant increase in drug-related exonerations from 2014 to 2016 
as  a  topic  for  research.  The  Commission  worked  with  the  Texas  Forensic  Science  Commission 
(TFSC) to identify issues and develop recommendations in the area of forensic science practices.  

The Texas Legislature created the Texas Forensic Science Commission in May 2005 through Article 
38.01  of  the  Texas  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  to  investigate  professional  negligence  and 
misconduct  that  would  affect  the  results  of  a  forensic  analysis  completed  by  an  accredited 
laboratory. In 2013, the 83rd Legislature clarified the scope of TFSC’s jurisdiction by passing Senate 
Bill 1238, which allowed the TFSC to investigate complaints regarding forensic disciplines that were 
not  subject  to  accreditation  under  Texas  law.  In 2015, the  84th  Legislature  again  expanded  the 
scope of TFSC’s responsibilities by transferring the Texas’ Crime Laboratory Accreditation Program 
oversight from the Texas Department of Public Safety through Senate Bill 1287.  

Research Highlights 

Figure  9  shows  the  increase  in  drug-related  exonerations  since  2010.  Of  the  drug-related 
exonerations,  89  percent  came  from  Harris  County.  The  primary  contributing  factor  to  the 
wrongful convictions was false and/or misleading forensic evidence.

In 2014, the Harris County District Attorney’s Office’s Conviction Integrity Unit identified a problem 
with  drug-related  cases.  When  an  individual  was  detained  and  suspected  of  having  an  alleged 
illegal substance in their position, officers would test the substance with a drug field test kit. If the 
result showed that a controlled substance was present, the suspect would be detained and taken 
into custody. This substance would be collected and handed over to the crime laboratory. Due to 
the  length  of  time  needed  for  the  evidence  to  be  processed,  many  individuals  accepted  plea 
bargains prior to testing of the substance by a crime laboratory. Testing in these cases was a lower 
priority for the laboratories and further delayed once a guilty plea had been made. Consequently, 
notifications  regarding  the  inaccurate  field  test  results  were  sent  out  after  the  individual  had 
accepted a plea bargain—often after the sentence had been completed. After the problem was 
identified, these cases began to be reviewed by a contract attorney for the State, and the Harris 
County Public Defender’s Office began to locate and inform individuals who had been convicted 
for an offense based on the incorrect field test.  

One  of  the  primary  issues  regarding  forensic  science  practices  identified  in  drug-related 
exonerations is the inaccuracy of drug field tests. Because of the questionable reliability of these 
kits and the arrests made based on their results, it is considered a best practice for crime labs to 
complete  testing  of  substances  in  all  drug  cases,  regardless  of  the  field  test  results.  Texas 
Department  of  Public  Safety  (DPS)  crime  laboratories  report  that  they  already  test  substances 
collected for all cases, including those in which the individual entered a plea before the laboratory 
results were available. The estimated cost of requiring all crime labs to test substances on pled 
cases  is  unknown;  however,  most  laboratories  reported  that  the  jurisdictions  for  which  they 
perform testing do not accept pleas for drug cases based on field tests administered by officers. A 
confirmatory laboratory report is needed. Despite potential additional costs in implementing this 
practice,  requiring  laboratory  testing  of  all  drug  field  tests  will  reduce  the  risk  of  wrongfully 
arresting and convicting an individual of being in possession of a controlled substance.  

In  addition  to  testing  all  substances  that  come  from  drug  field  tests,  it  is  also  necessary  to 
determine the reliability of drug field tests. Additionally, any individual involved in the collection 
and processing of evidence should be properly trained. From law enforcement officers to crime 
scene investigators, proper collection and testing of evidence procedures should be followed. A 
review of these practices is needed to assure the reliability of the evidence used in our courts to 
prosecute  individuals.  Although  the  cost  of  determining  the  reliability  of  drug  field  tests  and 
providing  training  to  law  enforcement  officers  and  crime  scene  investigators  is  unknown, 
implementing these practice improvements would reduce the risk for error.

Recommendations 

The Commission makes the following recommendations regarding forensic science practices: 

I. 

investigate  and  consider 
Encourage  the  Texas  Forensic  Science  Commission  to 
promulgating  policies  regarding  the  use  of  drug  field  tests  used  by  law  enforcement 
agencies. This includes the following: 

a.  Evaluate the kits’ quality, accuracy and reliability. 
b.  Identify any problem with the kits. 
c.  Investigate if officers are trained on how to use and interpret the kits. 
i.  If officers are trained, determine the adequacy of the training. 
ii.  If officers are not trained, require training on how to use and interpret the 

kits. 
 

II. 

investigate  and  consider 
Encourage  the  Texas  Forensic  Science  Commission  to 
promulgating  policies  regarding  the  process  of  crime  scene  investigations.  This  includes 
the following: 

a.  Evaluate standard procedures followed when processing a scene. 
b.  Evaluate how crime scenes are processed and the quality of the work. 
c.  Investigate what training is provided to crime scene investigators. 
d.  Investigate if continuing education is required and/or provided and if so: 

i.  Evaluate the capacity of the training; and 
ii.  Evaluate the quality of the training. 

 

IV. 

Recommend that crime labs in all cases moving forward complete testing of substances in 
all  drug  cases  regardless  of  the results  of  a  drug  field  test,  and  that  crime  labs  go  back 
through previous cases in which the collected substance was not confirmed by lab testing. 

CASE STUDY: Christopher Scott and Claude Simmons’ Exoneration 

 

The Crime 

On the night of April 6, 1997, Alonzo Aguilar and his wife Celia Escobedo were at a duplex in Dallas, 
Texas.  While at the duplex, Escobedo fell asleep watching television.  In the early morning hours 
of April 7, 1997, Escobedo was awakened by a loud noise.  When she woke up, Escobedo saw a 
male intruder she did not know standing in front of her, pointing a gun at her and demanding 
money.  During this encounter, Escobedo moved a pager that was clipped to the collar of her T-
shirt to her waistband.  In response, the intruder reacted immediately by frisking Escobedo and 
grabbing her pager.  The intruder then began searching other rooms in the duplex. 

Meanwhile,  another  unknown  armed  man  had  also  entered  the  duplex  and  demanded  money 
from Aguilar.  This second intruder searched Aguilar’s pockets and stole an unknown amount of 
cash.  Shortly thereafter, the first intruder shot and killed Aguilar.  Although not originally reported 

23 

 
 

 

 

 

to the police during the initial investigation, Escobedo later claimed that Aguilar was shot and killed 
when the first intruder became startled while sexually assaulting her. 

The Investigation 

During the early stages of the investigation, law enforcement obtained descriptions of the suspects 
from Escobedo, then immediately broadcast the descriptions on the police radio.   A short time 
later, a police officer driving in an unmarked car a couple of blocks away from the crime scene 
heard the broadcast.  That officer then noticed a parked car with two black male occupants who 
fit the descriptions of the two suspects.  The two suspects, later identified as Christopher Scott 
and Claude Simmons, got out of the car and entered a nearby house.  The officer reported this 
sighting to other investigating officers and requested assistance. 

Several  backup  officers  arrived  at  the  house  and  attempted  to  contact  the  people  inside.  
Approximately  45 minutes  later,  Simmons  opened  the  door  and  came  outside.  Eventually, 
everyone inside the house came out.  Police questioned everyone including Scott.  Scott and two 
other suspects were handcuffed and transported to the Dallas Police Department’s Crimes Against 
Persons Division (CAPERS) for additional questioning.   

Scott claims that once he was brought to CAPERS, he was told that an eyewitness to the Aguilar 
murder was being brought to the unit to look at him. Investigative reports conflict with this claim, 
instead  describing  the  “Escobedo  -  Scott”  encounter  at  CAPERS  as  a  sheer  coincidence.    While 
Scott was sitting in the waiting room, Escobedo entered and immediately identified Scott as the 
person who shot Aguilar.  However, Escobedo never identified Scott in a photo lineup.  

Scott  was  arrested  for  an  outstanding  warrant  and  for  the  capital  murder  of  Aguilar  and 
transported to jail.  On the way to the jail, Scott informed officers that he believed Don Michael 
Anderson had committed the murder and that he had heard that Anderson had robbed the same 
place two nights before the murder.  This information was included in the officer’s investigative 
report as an admission by Scott as to the identity of his accomplice. 

During  the  arrest,  Scott’s  clothes  were  confiscated  as  evidence  and  his  hands  were  tested  for 
gunshot residue.  No blood was discovered and all testing conducted revealed negative results for 
gunshot residue. 

During the three weeks following the murder, Simmons voluntarily went to the police department 
on three separate occasions and cooperated by answering questions.  On his last visit, Simmons 
agreed to have his photograph taken for inclusion in a photo lineup.  Escobedo was shown the 
photo lineup.  When she examined the photo lineup, which included photos of both Simmons and 
Anderson, Escobedo spent approximately two hours looking at it before she concluded she was 
unable to identify either individual. Then, Escobedo met with a victim’s liaison for approximately 
15 minutes; shortly thereafter, she identified Simmons in the photos presented. It was at that time 
that Escobedo told police officers that Simmons was the man that sexually assaulted her during 
the murder.  Simmons was then arrested.   

24 

 
 

 

 

 

During  the  investigation,  several  witnesses—including  law  enforcement  agents—identified 
Anderson  and  another  male,  Alonzo  Hardy,  as  the  individuals  who  murdered  Aguilar.  Police 
officers attempted to interview Anderson several times.  After Anderson refused to cooperate, he 
was no longer considered a suspect. 

The Trial 

Scott’s jury trial was held first, followed by Simmons’ jury trial a week later. The only substantive 
evidence  presented  at  Scott’s  trial  was  Escobedo’s  eyewitness  identification.    No  mention  of 
Anderson  and  Hardy  was  made  by  the  defense.    Scott  was  convicted  of  capital  murder  and 
sentenced to life in prison. 

During Simmons’ jury trial, the defense requested a continuance based on a recently disclosed 
hand written note from a police officer that implicated Anderson and Hardy in the crime.  The trial 
court judge—the same judge who presided over Scott’s trial—denied the request and proceeded 
with trial.  During the trial, Escobedo provided eyewitness testimony identifying Simmons as the 
person who sexually assaulted her and killed her husband.   

The defense then sought to introduce evidence to prove Anderson and Hardy were the men who 
killed Aguilar.  Among the evidence proffered was testimony from Anderson’s ex-girlfriend, Ellen 
Ellison,  regarding  inculpatory  statements  Anderson  made  to  her  establishing  that  he  shot  and 
killed Aguilar.  According to Ellison, Anderson had tears in his eyes when he confessed to her. He 
also told her that he never meant to do it—instead he only shot at Aguilar after Aguilar shot his 
accomplice Hardy in the arm and turned to shoot at Anderson.  Finding Ellison’s testimony to be 
inadmissible  hearsay,  the  trial  court  refused  to  admit  it  before  the  jury.    After  six  minutes  of 
deliberation, the jury found Simmons guilty of capital murder. Since the State did not seek the 
death penalty, Simmons was sentenced to life in prison. 

The Post-Conviction Innocence Investigation  

Post-conviction innocence claims for both Simmons and Scott were investigated by students at 
The University of Texas at Arlington Innocence Network, students at The University of Texas School 
of  Law  Actual  Innocence  Clinic,  the  Dallas  County  District  Attorney’s  Office  Conviction  Integrity 
Unit, the Dallas County Public Defender’s Office, and the Dallas Police Department.  While being 
interviewed by students and attorneys, Hardy confessed to his involvement in Aguilar’s murder.  
Hardy also took a polygraph examination which showed no deception.  During a deposition, Hardy 
corroborated his confession by providing information pertaining to physical evidence found at the 
crime scene.  Meanwhile, both Scott and Simmons agreed to take polygraph examinations; neither 
result showed deception. 

Additional  witnesses  that  supported  Scott’s  and  Simmons’  claims  of  innocence  included  Ellen 
Ellison, who the trial court judge did not allow to testify during Simmons’ trial, and Blanchard (a/k/a 
“Blinky”) Haggerty. Ellison stated that Anderson confessed to her what happened on the night of 
the murder. Specifically, Anderson told Ellison he went into the duplex and robbed a man and a 

25 

 
 

 

 

 

woman.    Anderson  also  told  her  that  he  shot  Aguilar  with  a  pistol  he  had  taken  from  under 
Escobedo’s bed. Finally, Ellison confirmed what Scott originally told the police--that she was in the 
car with Anderson two nights before Aguilar’s murder, when Anderson robbed the people in the 
duplex where the murder subsequently occurred.  “Blinky” Haggerty independently corroborated 
Anderson’s confession. When he was interviewed by Dallas Police detectives, Haggerty admitted 
that he drove the car for Anderson and Hardy on the night of Aguilar‘s murder.    

On March 3, 2010, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals granted relief to both Scott and Simmons 
on the grounds of actual innocence.  On March 6, 2012, Anderson pled guilty and was sentenced 
to prison for his role in the crime.   

Timothy Cole was one of many individuals who have served time in prison for crimes they did not 
commit. This Commission was comprised of experienced stakeholders devoted to preventing the 
incarceration of innocent people such as Mr. Cole. The time taken from innocent individuals and 
their families cannot be returned, but preventing such an event from happening to others is an 
important goal of our justice system. And it must be acknowledged that, if an innocent person is 
incarcerated, it means that the actual criminal remains at large, unpunished, and of continuing 
threat to society. 

In this way, the incarceration of an innocent person deeply affects not only the individual, along 
with his or her family and loved ones, but also Texans and their communities as a whole. It is for 
this  reason  that  the  Timothy  Cole  Exoneration  Review  Commission  submits  these 
recommendations and urges their consideration by the 85th Legislature.

MEMBERS’ ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 

Samuel Bassett  

Electronic recording of interrogations 
Recommendation II: Electronic recording should be required when investigating all felony cases. 

-  Dissenting statement: 

o  All criminal offenses, Class B Misdemeanor or above, should be recorded with 
audiovisual equipment absent a showing of good cause.  The recommendation 
should not be limited to felonies as some misdemeanors have serious 
consequences (i.e. DWI, offenses involving findings of family violence).   

Recommendation V: Recordings should be either audio or audiovisual formats. 

-  Dissenting statement: 

o  Technology has advanced to a point where the cost differential between audio 
recordings and audiovisual recordings is negligible; therefore, audiovisual 
recording equipment should be used when recording all interrogations. 

alse Accusations and Jailhouse Informant Regulation 
Senate bill 1681 has been in effect for seven years. This law requires some corroboration to convict 
an individual based on the jailhouse informant testimony. Though there have not been any new 
reported  cases  of  wrongful  convictions  based  on  false  jailhouse  informant  testimony  since  its 
passage,  it  should  be  noted  that  it  takes  many  years  to  legally  identify  and  remedy  wrongful 
convictions and that the absence of reported cases at this time is not indicative of whether article 
38.075 has sufficiently safeguarded defendants from false testimony from jailhouse informants. 

Regarding  the  recommendations  under  this  section  of  the  report;  all  recommendations  listed 
should  remain  as  they  are.  An  additional  recommendation  should  be  included  under  this  topic 
area as well. 

 Concurring statement: 

-  The testimony of an informant who provides evidence against a defendant must be 

examined and weighed by the juror with greater caution and care than the testimony of 
an ordinary witness. Whether the informer's testimony has been affected by interest or 
prejudice against the defendant is for the juror to determine. Although Texas does not 
have uniform jury charges, the State Bar of Texas recently published "Texas Criminal Jury 
Charges," which is a resource that contains a form jury instruction on the corroboration 
requirement mandated by article 38.075. This instruction, however, does not provide any 
specific information regarding the circumstances surrounding the informant's situation 
nor does it provide information regarding how to properly weigh the credibility of the 
testimony. 

-  The suggested recommendation is as follows:  

27 

 
 

  F

 

 

 

o  The Commission recommends that all necessary information be provided in an 

instruction to the jury in order for them to consider the following: (1) whether the 
witness has received or hopes to receive anything (including pay, immunity from 
prosecution, leniency in prosecution, personal advantage, or vindication) in 
exchange for testimony; (2) the extent to which the informant’s testimony is 
corroborated by other evidence; (3) the extent to which the details of the 
testimony could be obtained from a source other than the defendant; (4) any 
other case in which the informant testified or offered statements against an 
individual but was not called, and whether the statements were admitted in the 
case, and whether the informant received any deal, promise, inducement, or 
benefit in exchange for that testimony or statement; (5) whether the informant 
has ever changed his or her testimony; (6) the criminal history of the informant; 
and (7) any other evidence relevant to the informant’s credibility. 3

eciprocal  discovery  was  not  an  issue  considered  by  this  Commission.  However,  reciprocal 
discovery can play an important role in preventing wrongful convictions. According to the Texas 
Defender  Service,  98%  of  states  and  the  federal  government  require  some  form  of  reciprocal 
discovery  in  criminal  cases.4  In  its  2010  report,  the  Timothy  Cole  Advisory  Panel  on  Wrongful 
Convictions (TCAP) recommended that, “[t]he State of Texas should adopt a statewide discovery 
policy that is mandatory, automatic, and reciprocal, and requires either electronic access to or 
photocopies of materials subject to discovery.” This recommendation was partially implemented 
by the legislature in 2013 with the passage of SB 1611, the Michael Morton Act. The Act, which 
passed  with  the  support  of  Texas  prosecutors,  creates  one  of  the  most  progressive  discovery 
regimes in the United States. The Act, however, did not mandate reciprocal discovery. Thus, Texas 
remains the only state in the United States of America without reciprocal discovery. 

In  2013,  Texas  Appleseed  and  the  Texas  Defender  Service  issued  a  report  entitled  Improving 
Discovery  in  Criminal  Cases  in  Texas.  These  two  non-profit  agencies,  dedicated  to  increasing 
fairness in the Texas criminal justice system, recommended in their report that Texas implement 
a discovery regime that provides for “reciprocal or mutual discovery obligations for the defense, 
within the boundaries of the defendant’s constitutional rights.” The recommendations of TCAP, 
Texas  Appleseed,  and  Texas  Defender  Service  are  in  line  with  the  American  Bar  Association’s 
Standards  for  Criminal  Justice:  Discovery  and  Trial  by  Jury,  which  also  recommends  reciprocal 
discovery. 

Generally,  through  reciprocal  discovery,  a  defendant  is  required  to  provide  any  books,  papers, 
witness  statements,  or  physical  evidence  in  the  defendant’s  possession  that  he  intends  to 
introduce as evidence at trial. Most jurisdictions also require the defendant to provide a witness 
list  and  provide  advance  notice  if  the  defendant  plans  to  introduce  an  alibi  defense.  The 
significance of this kind of information is obvious. If a prosecutor can verify a defendant’s alibi or 
evidence prior to trial, there may be no need for a trial to take place. Under current Texas law, a 
defendant can spring evidence or an alibi defense in the middle of trial that the prosecution and 
law enforcement have no opportunity to verify. If the evidence or alibi is not believed by the jury, 
an innocent person could be convicted. For this very reason, reciprocal discovery is generally the 
law of the land throughout the United States. 

The goal of the criminal justice system is to find the truth. By implementing a reciprocal discovery 
system and ending the current system of “trial by ambush,” Texas will take a big step forward in 
preventing wrongful convictions and ensuring justice for all.
