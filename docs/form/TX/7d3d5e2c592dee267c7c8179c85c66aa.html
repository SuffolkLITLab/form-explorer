Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 
 

APPEAL NO.: 

10-002 

ESPONDENT: 

City of Corpus Christi 

ATE: 

 

April 5, 2010 

 

 

 

PECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge  Stephen  B.  Ables,  Chairman;  Judge  John  Ovard,  Judge 
Olen Underwood, Judge David Peeples, Judge Kelly G. Moore 

etitioner requested from  the City of Corpus Christi (the “City”) “[a]ny communication 
between Deanie King and senior city staff, supervisors or City Council member between July 20 
until today, Dec. 8.”  The City provided Petitioner with an itemized statement of estimated charges 
and requested a deposit or bond before responding to the request.  Petitioner paid the estimated 
charge and was told that the records would be available at a later date.  On January 4, 2010, the City 
provided Petitioner with responsive documents and informed her that it was waiving the charges and 
refunding  her  deposit  because  the  total  cost  amounted  to  less  than  five  dollars.    The  City  also 
informed Petitioner that portions of the requested information were being withheld because they 
were exempt from disclosure pursuant to Rule 12.2(d) and 12.5(a), (d), (f), (h), and (i) of the Rules 
of Judicial Administration1, and Petitioner appealed. 

etitioner asks this committee to determine whether the records she requests are subject to 
Rule 12 rather than the Public Information Act (PIA) and, if they are subject to Rule 12, whether the 
exemptions raised by the City cover the requested records.  Petitioner also contends that, if the 
records are subject to Rule 12, the City did not respond in a timely manner and it requests that 
sanctions be issued against the assistant city attorney who handled the response. 

e must first decide if Rule 12 applies to the records that are the subject of this appeal.  Rule 
12 governs requests to inspect or copy judicial records.  Rule 12.2(d) provides, in pertinent part:   

Judicial record means a record made or maintained by or for a court or judicial agency in its 
regular course of business but not pertaining to its adjudicative function, regardless of whether that 
function relates to a specific case.”

  “

Deanie King is a City of Corpus Christi municipal court judge.  Thus, a record created by 
Judge King in the regular course of her court’s business is a judicial record that is subject to Rule 
12 so long as it does not pertain to her court’s adjudicative function.  This is also true of records 
created by Judge King that are maintained for her court by the City. 

The records at issue consist of several emails sent by Judge King to another municipal 

court judge and one letter sent by the judge to the City’s mayor and council members.  Assuming 
                                                 
1 Unless otherwise provided, all references to Rule 12 are to Rule 12 of the Rules of Judicial Administration.

that the communications between Judge King and the other municipal court judge do not pertain 
to the court’s adjudicative function, they are judicial records.  We will review the documents 
provided to us by the City to ensure that they do not pertain to the court’s adjudicative function 
and then determine whether any Rule 12 exemptions apply. 

The letter from Judge King to the mayor and city council is different from the other 

communications because it was sent to persons outside of the court.  If the record is part of the 
body of records that the City maintains for the court, it is a judicial record.  But the City is in the 
unique position of also maintaining records for City staff and officials and, in this case, the 
request was actually made to the City, not to the court or Judge King.  If the letter provided to us 
for our review was obtained from one of the recipients of the letter or if the City is maintaining 
the record on behalf of one of the recipients, that record would be a record of the City and would 
not be subject to Rule 12.  This is a fact question that must be determined by the City.  For 
purposes of this decision, we will assume that the City is responding on behalf of Judge King’s 
court and that the letter provided to us was in the possession of the court or was being maintained 
by the City on behalf of the court. 

   

aving determined that the records at issue are judicial records as defined by Rule 12, we 
reviewed the documents and found that several of them contain information that is exempt from 
disclosure under Rule 12.5 (d) (home address or family information), 12.5(f) (internal deliberations 
on court  or judicial administration matters), 12.5(h) (judicial calendar information), and 12.5(i) 
(information confidential under other law).  In instances where the City identified more than one 
exemption, we noted whether all or only some of the exemptions applied.  In one instance the City 
identified an incorrect exemption and we noted the appropriate exemption on the document.  Also, 
some of the documents contain both exempt and nonexempt information.  In those instances, rather 
than withhold the documents in their entirety, the exempt information should be redacted.  See Rule 
12.6(d).  We have noted on the documents whether they should be completely withheld or redacted.   

he City also contends that one of the emails is not a judicial record as defined by Rule 
12.2(d) because it pertains to a pending case in the municipal court.  As stated above, records related 
to a court’s adjudicative function are not judicial records.  Because the email appears to be related to 
a pending case, it is not a judicial record and this committee can neither grant nor deny access to this 
record.  See Rule 12 Decision 00-003. 

astly, Petitioner requests that sanctions be issued against the City’s attorney for failing to 
respond timely to Petitioner’s request.  The City, relying on provisions of the PIA (Gov’t Code Sec. 
552.263), argues that it had 14 days from the date from which Petitioner provided payment for the 
records  to  provide  the  records.    The  City  believes  that  since  Rule  12  provides  that  a  records 
custodian, in the absence of a cost prescribed by statute, may rely on the costs prescribed by rules 
promulgated by the Office of the Attorney General in the Texas Administrative Code and those rules 
authorize the collection of a deposit or bond as does the PIA, then a person can also rely on the 
provisions of the PIA that extend the required time to comply with a request from the date that a 
bond  or  deposit  is  made.    We  do  not  agree  with  this  analysis.    Rule  12  authorizes  a  person 
responding to a Rule 12 request to use the rules promulgated by the OAG to determine the cost of 
records; it does not provide an alternate procedure for handling a request.  The City should have 
notified Petitioner that it would be unable to provide the records within 14 days and provided a 
reasonable  date  and  time  for  complying  with  or  denying  the  request  under  Rule  12.6(b)(2).  
However, the City does not appear to have knowingly failed to comply with Rule 12 as required for

sanctions under Rule 12.10.  Additionally, under Rule 12.10 sanctions can only be issued against the 
records custodian, and the custodian of the court’s records is the presiding judge of the court, not the 
City’s attorney. 

ccordingly, the appeal is granted in part and denied in part and the City is instructed to 
provide  to  Petitioner  the  portions  of the records that this committee has found to  be subject  to 
disclosure under Rule 12.
