standards  of  professional  conduct  and  to  dispose  of  individual  cases  of  lawyer  discipline  and 
disability in a manner that does not discriminate by race, creed, color, sex, or national origin. To 
carry out this responsibility, the Court promulgates the following rules for lawyer discipline and 
disability  proceedings.    Subject  to  the  inherent  power  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  Texas,  the 
responsibility for administering and supervising lawyer discipline and disability is delegated to the 
Board  of  Directors  of  the  State  Bar  of  Texas.  Authority  to  adopt  rules  of  procedure  and 
administration  not  inconsistent  with  these  rules  is  vested  in  the  Board.  This  delegation  is

  J

.01.  Disciplinary  Districts  and  Grievance  Committee  Subdistricts:  The  State  of  Texas  is 
geographically divided into disciplinary districts that are coextensive with the districts of elected 
Directors of the State Bar. One or more Committee subdistricts shall be delineated by the Board 
within each such District. From time to time, if the Commission deems it useful for the efficient 
operation of the disciplinary system, it shall recommend to the Board that a redelineation be made 
of one or more subdistricts within a District. All Committees within a single disciplinary district 
have concurrent authority within the District but once a matter has been assigned to a Committee, 
that Committee has dominant jurisdiction, absent a transfer. 

.02.  Composition of Members: Each elected Director of the State Bar shall nominate, and the 
President of the State Bar shall appoint, the members of the Committees within the District that 
coincides with the Director's district, according to rules and policies adopted from time to time by 
the Board. Each Committee must consist of no fewer than nine members, two- thirds of whom 
must be attorneys licensed to practice law in the State of Texas and in good standing, and one-
third of whom must be public members. All Committee panels must be composed of two-thirds 
attorneys and one-third public members. Each member of the Committee shall reside within or 
maintain  his  or  her  principal  place  of  employment  or  practice  within  the  District  for  which 
appointed. Public members may not have, other than as consumers, any financial interest, direct 
or indirect, in the practice of law. There may be no ex officio members of any Committee. 

.03.  Time for Appointment and Terms: All persons serving on a Committee at the time these 
rules become effective shall continue to serve for their then unexpired terms, subject to resignation 
or removal as herein provided.  Nominations to Committees shall be made annually at the spring 
meeting of the Board; all appointments shall be made by the President no later than June 1 of each 
year, provided, however, that if a vacancy on a Committee arises after June 1, the Director(s) shall 
nominate and the President shall appoint an eligible person to serve for the remaining period of 

 

 

  2

  2

  2

 

7 

the unexpired term. If any Director fails or refuses to make nominations in a timely manner, or the 
President fails or refuses to make appointments in a timely manner, the existing members of the 
Committees shall continue to hold office until the nominations and appointments are made and the 
successor  member  is  qualified.  One-third  of  each  new  Committee  will  be  appointed  for  initial 
terms of one year, one-third for an initial term of two years, and one-third for an initial term of 
three years. Thereafter, all terms will be for a period of three years, except for appointments to fill 
unexpired terms, which will be for the remaining period of the unexpired term. Any member of a 
Committee who has served two consecutive terms, whether full or partial terms, is not eligible for 
reappointment until at least three years have passed since his or her last prior service. No member 
may serve as chair for more than two consecutive terms of one year each. All members are eligible 
for election to the position of chair. 

.04.  Organizational Meeting of  Grievance   Committees: The  last duly  elected  chair of  a 
Committee shall call an organizational meeting of the Committee no later than July 15 of each 
year; shall administer the oath of office to each new member; and shall preside until the Committee 
has elected, by a majority vote, its new chair. Members may vote for themselves for the position 
of chair. 

.05.  Oath  of  Committee  Members:  As  soon  as  possible  after  appointment,  each  newly 
appointed member of a Committee shall take the following oath to be administered by any person 
authorized by law to administer oaths: 
 

“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute my duties as a member 
of the District grievance committee, as required by the Texas Rules of Disciplinary 
Procedure,  and  will,  to  the  best  of  my  ability,  preserve,  protect,  and  defend  the 
Constitution  and  laws  of  the  United  States  and  of  the  State  of  Texas.  I  further 
solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will keep secret all such matters and things as shall 
come to my knowledge as a member of the grievance committee arising from or in 
connection  with  each  Disciplinary  Action  and  Disciplinary  Proceeding,  unless 
permitted  to  disclose  the  same  in  accordance  with  the  Rules  of  Disciplinary 
Procedure, or unless ordered to do so in the course of a judicial proceeding or a 
proceeding before the Board of Disciplinary Appeals. I further solemnly  swear (or 
affirm) that I  have neither  directly  nor  indirectly  paid, offered, or  promised  to 
pay,  contributed  any  money  or  valuable thing,  or promised any public or private 
office to secure my appointment. So help me God.” 

.06.  Assignment  of  Committee Members: Each member of a Committee shall  act through 
panels  assigned  by  the  chair  of  the  Committee  for  investigatory hearings, summary  disposition 
dockets,    and  evidentiary  hearings.  Promptly  after  assignment,  notice  must  be  provided  to  the 
Respondent  of  the  names  and  addresses  of  the  panel  members  assigned  to  each  Complaint.  A 
member is disqualified or is subject to recusal as a panel member for an evidentiary hearing if a 
district  judge  would,  under  similar  circumstances,  be  disqualified  or  recused.  If  a  member  is 
disqualified  or  recused,  another  member  shall  be  appointed  by  the  Committee  chair.  No 
peremptory  challenges  of  a  Committee  member  are  allowed.  Any    alleged    grounds      for  
disqualification  or  recusal  of  a  panel  member  are conclusively  waived if not brought to the 
attention of the panel within ten days after receipt of notification of the names and addresses of 

  2

  2

  2

 

8 

members  of  the  panel;  however,  grounds  for  disqualification  or    recusal  not    reasonably 
discoverable    within  the    ten    day    period    may    be  asserted  within  ten  days  after  they  were 
discovered or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been discovered. 

.07.  Duties of Committees: Committees shall act through panels, as assigned by the Committee 
chairs, to conduct investigatory hearings, summary disposition dockets and evidentiary hearings. 
No panel may consist of more than one-half of all members of the Committee or fewer than three 
members. If a member of a panel is disqualified, recused or otherwise unable to serve, the chair 
shall appoint a replacement. Panels must be composed of two attorney members for each public 
member.  A quorum must include at least one public member for every two attorney members 
present and consists of a majority of the membership of the panel, and business shall be conducted 
upon majority vote of those members present, a quorum being had. In matters in which evidence 
is taken, no member may vote unless that member has heard or reviewed all the evidence. It shall 
be  conclusively  presumed,  however,  not  subject  to  discovery  or  challenge  in  any  subsequent 
proceeding, that every member casting a vote has heard or reviewed all the evidence. No member, 
attorney or public, may be appointed by the chair to an Evidentiary Panel pertaining to the same 
disciplinary  matter  that  the  member  considered  at  either  an  investigatory  hearing  or  summary 
disposition docket. Any tie vote is a vote in favor of the position of the Respondent. 

.08.  Expenses:  Members  of  Committees  serve  without  compensation  but  are  entitled  to 
reimbursement by the State Bar for their reasonable, actual, and necessary expenses. 

.09.  Notice to Parties: 

A. 
Every notice required by this Part to be served upon the Respondent may be served 
by U. S. certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any  other means of service  permitted 
by the Texas Rules of Civil  Procedure  to the Respondent at the 
Respondent's Address or to the Respondent's counsel. 

. 

Every notice required by this Part to be served upon the Commission may be served 
by U. S. certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any other means of service permitted  
by  the  Texas  Rules of  Civil Procedure,  to  the  address  of  the Commission's counsel of 
record or, if none, to the address designated by the Commission. 

.  Whenever    a  party  has  the  right  or  is  required  to  do  some  act  or  take  some 
proceedings within a prescribed period after the service of a notice or other paper upon the 
party  and  the  notice  or  paper  is  served  upon  the  party  by  mail  or  telephonic  document 
transfer, three days shall be added to the prescribed period. 

  B

  C

.10.      Classification  of  Grievances:  The  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  shall  within  thirty  days 
examine each Grievance received to determine whether it constitutes an Inquiry, a Complaint, or 
a Discretionary Referral.  
 

If  the  Grievance  is  determined  to  constitute  an  Inquiry,  the  Chief  Disciplinary 
A. 
Counsel shall notify the Complainant and Respondent of the dismissal. The Complainant 
may, within thirty days from notification of the dismissal, appeal the determination to the 

  2

  2

  2

 

  2

 

9 

Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals.  If  the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals  affirms  the 
classification as an  Inquiry, the Complainant will be so notified and may within twenty 
days amend the Grievance one time only by providing new or additional evidence.  The 
Complainant  may  appeal  a  decision  by  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  to  dismiss  the 
amended  Complaint  as  an  Inquiry  to  the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals.  No  further 
amendments or appeals will be accepted.  

If the Grievance is determined to constitute a Complaint, the Respondent shall be 
B. 
provided a copy of the Complaint with notice to respond, in writing, to the allegations of 
the Complaint. The notice shall advise the Respondent that the Chief Disciplinary Counsel 
may  provide  appropriate  information,  including  the  Respondent's  response,  to  law 
enforcement agencies as permitted by Rule 6.08. The Respondent shall deliver the response 
to both the Office of the Chief Disciplinary Counsel and the Complainant within thirty days 
after receipt of the notice. 

. 

If the Grievance is determined to be a Discretionary Referral, the Chief Disciplinary 
Counsel will notify the Complainant and the Respondent of the referral to the State Bar’s 
Client Attorney Assistance Program (CAAP). No later than sixty days after the Grievance 
is referred, CAAP will notify the Chief Disciplinary Counsel of the outcome of the referral. 
The  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  must,  within  fifteen  days  of  notification  from  CAAP, 
determine  whether  the  Grievance  should  be  dismissed  as  an  Inquiry  or  proceed  as  a 
Complaint. The Chief Disciplinary Counsel and CAAP may share confidential information 
for all Grievances classified as Discretionary Referrals.  

.11.  Venue: Venue of District Grievance Committee proceedings shall be in accordance with 
the following: 
 

A. 
Investigatory  Panel  Proceedings.  Proceedings  of  an  Investigatory  Panel  shall  be 
conducted by a Panel for the county where the alleged Professional Misconduct occurred, 
in whole or in part. If the acts or omissions complained of  occurred wholly  outside the 
State of Texas, proceedings shall be conducted by a Panel for the county of Respondent’s 
residence and, if Respondent has no residence in Texas, by a Panel for Travis County.  

. 

Summary Disposition Panel Proceedings.  Proceedings of a Summary Disposition 
Panel  shall  be  conducted  by  a  Panel  for  the  county  where  the  alleged  Professional 
Misconduct occurred, in whole or in part. If the acts or omissions complained of occurred 
wholly outside the State of Texas, proceedings shall be conducted by a Panel for the county 
of Respondent's residence and, if Respondent has no residence in Texas, by a Panel for 
Travis County, Texas. 

. 

Evidentiary  Panel  Proceedings.  Proceedings  of  an  Evidentiary  Panel  shall  be 
conducted  by  a  Panel  for  the  county  where  Respondent's  principal  place  of  practice  is 
maintained; or if the Respondent does not maintain a place of practice within the State of 
Texas, in the county of Respondent's residence; or if the Respondent maintains neither a 
residence nor a place of practice within the State of Texas, then in the county where the 
alleged Professional Misconduct occurred, in whole or in part. In all other instances, venue

The  Chief Disciplinary  Counsel will investigate  a Complaint to determine whether Just 

General  Rule:  The  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  must  make  a  Just  Cause 
1. 
determination within 60 days of the date that the Respondent’s response to the Complaint 
is due. 

Exceptions: The Just Cause determination date is extended to 60 days after the latest 

the date of compliance specified in any investigatory subpoena issued by 

a. 
the Chief Disciplinary Counsel; 

the date of any enforcement order issued by a district court under (E); or 

the date that an investigatory hearing is completed.  

. 

. 

  b

  c

. 

During  the  investigation,  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel,  with  the  Committee  chair’s 
approval, may issue a subpoena that relates directly to a specific allegation of attorney misconduct 
for the production of documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things or to compel 
the attendance of a witness, including the Respondent, at an investigatory hearing.  
  
C. 
A subpoena must notify the witness of the time, date, and place of appearance or production 
and  must  contain  a  description  of  materials  to  be  produced.  A  subpoena  must  be  served  on  a 
witness  personally  or  in  accordance  with  Rule  21a,  Texas  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.  Proof  of 
service  may  be  by  certification  of  the  server  or  by  return  receipt.  A  witness,  other  than  the 
Respondent, who is commanded to appear at an investigatory hearing is entitled to the same fee 
and expense reimbursement as a witness commanded to appear in district court.    

. 

Before  the  time  specified  for  compliance,  the  Respondent  or  witness  must  present  any 
objection to the chair of the Investigatory Panel, if an investigatory hearing has been set, or to the 
Committee chair, if an investigatory hearing has not been set. Objections must be made in good 
faith. If the chair overrules an objection in whole or in part, and the Respondent or witness fails to 
comply with the chair’s ruling, the Chief Disciplinary Counsel may seek to enforce the subpoena 
in district court under (E). 

. 

The Chief Disciplinary Counsel may seek enforcement of a subpoena in the district court 
of the county in which appearance or production is required. The Respondent or witness may raise 
any good faith objection to the subpoena. If the district court finds that a person’s noncompliance 
with or objection to a subpoena is in bad faith, then after notice and a hearing, the court may order 
the person to pay the Chief Disciplinary Counsel’s reasonable and necessary costs and attorney 
fees. The district court’s order is not appealable. The Chief Disciplinary Counsel must not consider

.12.  Investigation and Determination of Just Cause:  

a Respondent’s good faith objection to an investigatory subpoena as grounds for Just Cause.  

. 

The  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  may  set  a  Complaint  for  an  investigatory  hearing.  The 
hearing will be set before an Investigatory Panel and is a nonadversarial proceeding that may be 
conducted by teleconference. The chair of the Investigatory Panel may administer oaths and may 
set forth procedures for eliciting evidence, including witness testimony. Witness examination may 
be conducted by the Chief Disciplinary Counsel, the Respondent, or the Panel. An investigatory 
hearing is strictly confidential and any record may be released only for use in a disciplinary matter.  

. 

An investigatory hearing may result in a Sanction negotiated with the Respondent or in the 
Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel’s  dismissing  the  Complaint  or  finding  Just  Cause.  The  terms  of  a 
negotiated Sanction must be in a written judgment with findings of fact and conclusions of law. 
The judgment must be entered into the record by the chair of the Investigatory Panel and signed 
by the Chief Disciplinary Counsel and the Respondent.   

.13.   Summary Disposition Setting:  Upon investigation,   if the Chief Disciplinary Counsel 
determines  that  Just  Cause  does  not  exist  to  proceed  on  the  Complaint,  the  Chief  Disciplinary 
Counsel  shall  place  the  Complaint  on  a  Summary  Disposition  Panel  docket,  which  may  be 
conducted by teleconference. At the Summary Disposition Panel docket, the Chief Disciplinary 
Counsel  will  present  the  Complaint  together  with  any  information,  documents,  evidence,  and 
argument  deemed  necessary  and  appropriate  by  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel,  without  the 
presence  of  the  Complainant  or  Respondent.  The  Summary  Disposition  Panel  shall  determine 
whether the Complaint should be dismissed or should proceed.  If the Summary Disposition Panel 
dismisses the Complaint, both the Complainant and Respondent will be so notified. There is no 
appeal  from  a  determination  by  the  Summary  Disposition  Panel  that  the  Complaint  should  be 
dismissed or should proceed. All Complaints presented to the Summary Disposition Panel and not 
dismissed will proceed in accordance with Rule 2.14 and Rule 2.15. The fact that a Complaint was 
placed on the Summary Disposition Panel Docket and not dismissed is wholly inadmissible for 
any purpose in the instant or any subsequent Disciplinary Proceeding or Disciplinary Action.  

.14.  Proceeding Upon a Determination of Just Cause: All rights characteristically reposed 
in  a  client  by  the  common  law  of  this  State  as  to  every  Complaint  not  dismissed  after  an 
investigatory hearing, resolved through a negotiated judgment entered by an Investigatory Panel, 
or dismissed by the Summary Disposition Panel are vested in the Commission. 
 

A. 
Client of Chief Disciplinary Counsel: The Commission is the client of the Chief 
Disciplinary  Counsel  for  every  Complaint  not  dismissed  after  an  investigatory  hearing, 
resolved through a negotiated judgment entered by an Investigatory Panel, or dismissed by 
the Summary Disposition Panel. 

. 

Interim  Suspension:  In  any  instance  in  which  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel 
reasonably believes based upon investigation of the Complaint that the Respondent poses 
a  substantial  threat  of  irreparable  harm  to  clients  or  prospective  clients,  the  Chief 
Disciplinary  Counsel  may  seek  and  obtain  authority  from  the  Commission  to  pursue 
interim suspension of the Respondent's license in accordance with Part XIV of these rules.

Disability:  In  any  instance  in  which  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  reasonably 
C. 
believes based upon investigation of the Complaint that the Respondent is suffering from 
a Disability to  such an extent that either  (a) the Respondent's continued practice of law 
poses  a  substantial  threat  of  irreparable  harm  to  client  or  prospective  clients;  or  (b)  the 
Respondent is so impaired as to be unable to meaningfully participate in the preparation of 
a defense, the Chief Disciplinary Counsel shall seek and obtain client authority to refer the 
Complaint to the Board of Disciplinary Appeals pursuant to Part XII of these rules. 

. 

Notification of Complaint: For each Complaint not dismissed after an investigatory 
hearing,  resolved  through  a  negotiated  judgment  entered  by  an  Investigatory  Panel,  or 
dismissed by a Summary Disposition Panel, the Chief Disciplinary Counsel shall give the 
Respondent written notice of the acts and/or omissions engaged in by the Respondent and 
of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of  Professional   Conduct  that  the  Chief  Disciplinary 
Counsel contends are violated by the alleged acts and/or omissions.  

  D

.15.   Election: A Respondent  given  written notice of  the  allegations  and  rule  violations 
complained of, in accordance with Rule 2.14, shall notify  the Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel whether 
the  Respondent  seeks  to  have  the  Complaint  heard  in  a  district  court  of  proper  venue,  with  or 
without a jury, or by an Evidentiary Panel of the Committee. The election must be in writing and 
served  upon  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  no  later  than  twenty  days  after  the  Respondent's 
receipt of written notification pursuant to Rule 2.14. If the Respondent timely elects to have the 
Complaint heard in a district court, the matter will proceed in accordance with Part III hereof.  If 
the Respondent timely elects to have the Complaint heard by an Evidentiary Panel, the matter will 
proceed in accordance with Rules 2.17 and 2.18.  A Respondent's failure to timely file an election 
shall conclusively be deemed as an affirmative election to proceed in accordance with Rules 2.17 
and 2.18. 

.16.  Confidentiality: 

All  members  and  staff  of  the  Office  of  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel,  Board  of 
A. 
Disciplinary  Appeals,  Committees,  and  Commission  shall  maintain  as  confidential  all 
Disciplinary Proceedings and associated records, except that: 

1. 
the  pendency,  subject   matter,  status  of  an  investigation,  and  final 
disposition, if any, may be disclosed by the Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel 
or Board of Disciplinary Appeals if the Respondent has waived confidentiality, the 
Disciplinary Proceeding is based on conviction of a serious crime, or disclosure is 
ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction; 

a negotiated judgment entered by an Investigatory Panel for any Sanction 

. 
other than a private reprimand may be disclosed;  

if  the  Evidentiary  Panel  finds  that  professional  misconduct  occurred  and

The  deliberations  and  voting  of  an  Investigatory  Panel  or  Evidentiary  Panel  are 
strictly confidential and not subject to discovery. No person is competent to testify as to 
such deliberations and voting.

Rule  6.08 governs the provision of confidential information to  authorized agencies 
investigating  qualifications  for  admission  to  practice,  attorney  discipline  enforcement 
agencies,  law enforcement agencies, the State Bar's Client Security Fund, the State Bar's 
Lawyer  Assistance  Program,  the  Supreme  Court's  Unauthorized  Practice  of  Law 
Committee and its subcommittees, and the Commission on Judicial Conduct.

Files of dismissed Disciplinary Proceedings will be retained for one hundred eighty 
days, after which time the files may be destroyed. No permanent record will be kept of 
Complaints dismissed except to the extent necessary for statistical reporting purposes.

.17.  Evidentiary Hearings: Within fifteen days of the earlier of the date of Chief Disciplinary 
Counsel's  receipt  of  Respondent's  election  or  the  day  following  the  expiration  of  Respondent's 
right to elect, the chair of a Committee having proper venue shall appoint an Evidentiary Panel to 
hear the Complaint. The Evidentiary Panel may not include any person who served on a Summary 
Disposition  or  an  Investigatory  Panel  that  heard  the  Complaint  and  must  have  at  least  three 
members but no more than one-half  as many members as on the Committee. Each Evidentiary 
Panel must have a ratio of two attorney members for every public member. Proceedings before an 
Evidentiary Panel of the Committee include: 
 

A. 
Evidentiary  Petition  and  Service:  Not  more  than  sixty  days  from  the  earlier  of 
receipt  of  Respondent's  election  or  Respondent's  deadline  to  elect  to  proceed  before  an 
Evidentiary Panel, the Chief Disciplinary Counsel shall file with the Evidentiary Panel an 
Evidentiary  Petition  in  the  name  of  the  Commission.  The  Evidentiary  Petition  shall  be 
served upon the Respondent in accordance with Rule 2.09 and must contain:

Professional Conduct allegedly violated by the acts or conduct, or other grounds 
for seeking Sanctions.

Answer: A responsive pleading either admitting or denying each specific allegation 
B. 
of Professional Misconduct must be filed by or on behalf of the Respondent no later than 
5:00 p.m. on the first Monday following the expiration of twenty days after service of the 
Evidentiary Petition. 

. 

Default:  A failure to file an answer within the time permitted constitutes a default, 
and all facts alleged in the Evidentiary Petition shall be taken as true for the purposes of 
the Disciplinary Proceeding.  Upon a showing of default, the Evidentiary Panel shall enter 
an order of default with a finding of Professional Misconduct and shall conduct a hearing 
to determine the Sanctions to be imposed. 

. 

Request  for  Disclosure:  The  Commission  or  Respondent  may  obtain  disclosure 
from the other party of the information or material listed below by serving the other party, 
no later than thirty days before the first setting of the hearing. The responding party must 
serve  a  written  response  on  the  requesting  party  within  thirty  days  after  service  of  the 
request, except that a Respondent served with a request before the answer is due need not 
respond until fifty days after service of the request. A party who fails to make, amend, or 
supplement a disclosure in a timely manner may not introduce in evidence the material or 
information that was not timely disclosed, or offer the testimony of a witness (other than a 
named party) who was not timely identified, unless the panel finds that there was good 
cause for the failure to timely make, amend, or supplement the disclosure response; or the 
failure  to  timely  make,  amend,  or  supplement  the  discovery  response  will  not  unfairly 
surprise or unfairly prejudice the other party. No objection or assertion of work product is 
permitted to a request under this Rule. A party may request disclosure of any or all of the

following: 

1. 

The correct names of the parties to the Disciplinary Proceeding. 

In general, the factual  bases of  the  responding party's  claims or defenses 

. 
(the responding party need not marshal all evidence that may be offered at trial).

relevant facts, and a brief statement of each identified person's connection with the 
disciplinary matter. 

For  any  testifying  expert, the  expert's  name,  address, and  telephone 
. 
number;  the  subject    matter  on  which  the  expert  will  testify,    and  the  general 
substance of the expert's mental impressions and opinions and a brief summary of 
the basis for them. 

Any witness statements. 

Limited Discovery: In addition to the Request for Disclosure, the Commission and 

E. 
the Respondent may conduct further discovery with the following limitations: 

1. 
All discovery must be conducted during the discovery period, which begins 
when the Evidentiary Petition is filed and continues until thirty days before the date 
set for hearing. 

Each party may have no more than six hours in total to examine and cross-

. 
examine all witnesses in oral depositions. 

Any party may serve on the other party no more than twenty-five written 
. 
interrogatories,  excluding  interrogatories  asking  a  party  only  to  identify  or 
authenticate  specific  documents.  Each  discrete  subpart  of  an  interrogatory  is 
considered a separate interrogatory. 

Any  party  may  serve  on  the  other  party  requests  for  production  and 

. 
inspection of documents and tangible things. 

Any party may serve on the other party requests for admission.

Modification of Discovery Limitations: Upon a showing of reasonable need, the 
Evidentiary Panel chair may modify the discovery limitations set forth in Rule 2.17E. The 
parties may by agreement modify the discovery limitations set forth in Rule 2.17E. 

. 

Discovery Dispute Resolution: Except where modified by these rules, all discovery 
disputes shall be ruled upon by the Evidentiary Panel chair generally in accord with the 
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure; provided, however, that no ruling upon a discovery dispute 
shall be a basis for reversal solely because it fails to strictly comply with the Texas Rules

. 

Subpoena    Power:  The    Commission    or    the    Respondent    may    compel    the 
attendance of  witnesses, including  the  Respondent,  and  the  production  of  documents, 
electronically stored information, or tangible things by subpoena. A subpoena must notify 
the witness of the time, date, and place of appearance or production; contain a description 
of the materials to be produced; be signed by the Evidentiary Panel chair; and be served 
personally or in accordance with Rule 21a, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Proof of service 
may  be  by  certification  of  the  server  or  by  return  receipt.  Any  contest  between  the 
Commission  and  the  Respondent  about  the  materiality  of  the  testimony  or  production 
sought will be determined by the Evidentiary Panel chair, and is subject to review. The 
Commission or the Respondent may seek enforcement of a subpoena in the district court  
of  the  county  in  which the  attendance  or  production  is  required. A witness, other than 
the Respondent, who is commanded to appear at an Evidentiary Panel hearing is entitled 
to the same fee and expense reimbursement as a witness commanded to appear in district 
court. 

. 
Enforcement  of  Subpoenas  and  Examination  Before  a  District  Judge:  If  any 
witness, including the Respondent, fails or refuses to appear or to produce the things named 
in  the  subpoena,  or  refuses  to  be  sworn  or  to  affirm  or  to  testify,  the  witness  may  be 
compelled  to  appear  and  produce  tangible  evidence  and  to  testify  at  a  hearing  before  a 
district judge of the county in which the subpoena was served. The application for such a 
hearing is to be styled “In re: Hearing Before The District                   Grievance Committee.” 
The  court  shall  order  a  time,  date,  and  place  for  the  hearing  and  shall  notify  the 
Commission, the Respondent, and the witness. Unless the Respondent requests a public 
hearing,  the  proceedings  before  the  court  shall  be  closed  and  all  records  relating  to  the 
hearing shall be sealed and made available only to the Commission, the Respondent, or the 
witness. If the witness fails or refuses to appear, testify, or produce such tangible evidence, 
he or she shall be punished for civil contempt. 

Right to Counsel: The Respondent and the Complainant may, if they so choose, 

. 
have counsel present during any evidentiary hearing. 

. 

Alternative Dispute Resolution:  Upon motion made or otherwise, the Evidentiary 
Panel Chair may order the Commission and the Respondent to participate in mandatory 
alternative  dispute  resolution  as  provided  by  Chapter  154  of  the  Civil  Practice  and 
Remedies Code or as otherwise provided by law when deemed appropriate. 

. 

 Evidence:  The  Respondent,  individually  or  through  his  or  her  counsel  if 
represented, and the Commission, through the Chief Disciplinary Counsel, may, if they so 
choose,  offer  evidence,  examine  witnesses  and  present  argument.  Witness  examination 
may be conducted only by the Commission, the Respondent, and the panel members. The 
inability  or  failure  to  exercise  this  opportunity  does  not  abate  or  preclude  further 
proceedings.  The  Evidentiary  Panel  chair  shall  admit  all  such  probative  and  relevant 
evidence as he or she deems necessary for a fair and complete hearing, generally in accord 
with  the  Texas  Rules  of  Evidence;  provided,  however,  that  admission  or  exclusion  of

evidence shall be in the discretion of the Evidentiary Panel chair and no ruling upon the 
evidence  shall  be  a  basis  for  reversal  solely  because  it  fails  to  strictly  comply  with  the 
Texas Rules of Evidence. 

. 

Burden  of  Proof:  The  burden  of  proof  is  upon  the  Commission  for  Lawyer 
Discipline to prove the material allegations of the Evidentiary Petition by a preponderance 
of the evidence. 

N. 
Record of the Hearing: A verbatim record of the proceedings will be made by a 
certified shorthand reporter in a manner prescribed by the Board of Disciplinary Appeals. 
In the event of an appeal from the Evidentiary Panel to the Board of Disciplinary Appeals, 
the party initiating the appeal shall pay the costs of preparation of the transcript. Such costs 
shall be taxed at the conclusion of the appeal by the Board of Disciplinary Appeals. 

. 

Setting: Evidentiary Panel proceedings must be set for hearing with a minimum of 
forty-five  days'  notice  to  all  parties  unless  waived  by  all  parties.  Evidentiary  Panel 
proceedings shall be set for hearing on the merits on a date not later than 180 days after the 
date the answer is filed, except for good cause shown. If the Respondent fails to answer, a 
hearing  for  default  may  be  set  at  any  time  not  less  than  ten  days  after  the  answer  date 
without further notice to the Respondent. No continuance may be granted unless required 
by the interests of justice. 

. 

Decision:  After  conducting  the  Evidentiary  Hearing,  the  Evidentiary  Panel  shall 
issue  a  judgment  within  thirty  days.  In  any  Evidentiary  Panel  proceeding  where 
Professional Misconduct is found to have occurred, such judgment shall include findings 
of fact, conclusions of law and the Sanctions to be imposed. The Evidentiary Panel may:

finding  to  the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals  for  referral  to  a  district  disability 
committee pursuant to Part XII; or 

find that Professional Misconduct occurred and impose Sanctions.

.18.  Terms of Judgment: In any judgment of disbarment or suspension that is not stayed, the 
Evidentiary Panel shall order the Respondent to surrender his or her law license and permanent 
State Bar card to the Chief Disciplinary Counsel for transmittal to the Clerk of the Supreme Court. 
In  all  judgments  imposing  disbarment  or  suspension,  the  Evidentiary  Panel  shall  enjoin  the 
Respondent from practicing law or from holding himself or herself out as an attorney eligible to 
practice  law  during  the  period  of  disbarment  or  suspension.  In  all  judgments  of  disbarment, 
suspension, or reprimand, the Evidentiary Panel shall make all other orders as it finds appropriate, 
including probation of all or any portion of suspension.

2.19.  Restitution: In all cases in which the proof establishes that the Respondent's misconduct 
involved the misappropriation of funds and the Respondent is disbarred or suspended, the panel's 
judgment  must  require  the  Respondent  to  make  restitution  during  the  period  of  suspension,  or 
before  any  consideration  of  reinstatement  from  disbarment,  and  must  further  provide  that  its 
judgment  of suspension shall remain in effect until evidence of satisfactory restitution is made by 
Respondent and verified by the Chief Disciplinary Counsel. 

.20.  Notice  of  Decision:  The  Complainant,  the  Respondent,  and  the  Commission  must  be 
notified in writing of the judgment of the Evidentiary Panel. The notice sent to the Respondent and 
the Commission must clearly state that any appeal of the judgment must be filed with the Board 
of Disciplinary Appeals within thirty days of the date of the notice. If the Evidentiary Panel finds 
that the Respondent committed professional misconduct, a copy of the Evidentiary Petition and 
the judgment shall be transmitted by the Office of the Chief Disciplinary Counsel to the Clerk of 
the Supreme Court.  The Clerk of the Supreme Court shall make an appropriate notation on the 
Respondent's permanent record. 

.21.  Post  Judgment  Motions: Any  motion  for  new hearing  or  motion  to  modify  the 
judgment  must  comport  with  the  provisions  of  the  applicable  Texas  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure 
pertaining to motions for new trial or to motions to modify judgments. 

.22.  Probated Suspension--Revocation Procedure: If all or any part of a suspension from the 
practice of law is probated under this Part II, the Board of Disciplinary Appeals is hereby granted 
jurisdiction for the full term of suspension, including any probationary period, to hear a motion to 
revoke probation. If the Chief Disciplinary Counsel files a motion to revoke probation, it shall be 
set for hearing within thirty days of service of the motion upon the Respondent. Service upon the 
Respondent shall be sufficient if made in accordance with Rule 21a of the Texas Rules of Civil 
Procedure. Upon proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, of a violation of probation, the same 
shall be revoked and the attorney suspended from the practice of law for the full term of suspension 
without  credit  for  any  probationary  time  served.  The  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals'  Order 
revoking a probated suspension cannot be superseded or stayed. 

.23.  Appeals by Respondent or Commission: The Respondent or Commission may appeal 
the judgment to the Board of Disciplinary Appeals. Such appeals must be on the record, determined 
under  the  standard  of  substantial  evidence.  Briefs  may  be  filed  as  a  matter  of  right.  The  time 
deadlines for such briefs shall be promulgated by the Board of Disciplinary Appeals. An appeal, 
if  taken,  is  perfected  when  a  written  notice  of  appeal  is  filed  with  the  Board  of  Disciplinary 
Appeals. The notice of appeal must reflect the intention of the Respondent or the Commission to 
appeal and identify the decision from which appeal is perfected. The notice of appeal must be filed 
within thirty days after the date of judgment, except that the notice of appeal must be filed within 
ninety days after the date of judgment if any party timely files a motion for new trial or a motion 
to modify the judgment. 

.24.  No  Supersedeas:  An  Evidentiary  Panel's  order  of  disbarment  cannot  be  superseded  or 
stayed. The Respondent may within thirty days from entry of judgment petition the Evidentiary 
Panel  to  stay  a  judgment  of  suspension.  The  Respondent  carries  the  burden  of  proof  by 
preponderance of the evidence to establish by competent evidence that the Respondent's continued

practice of law does not pose a continuing threat to the welfare of Respondent's clients or to the 
public. An order of suspension must be stayed during the pendency of any appeals therefrom if the 
Evidentiary Panel finds that the Respondent has met that burden of proof. An Evidentiary Panel 
may  condition  its  stay  upon  reasonable  terms,  which  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the 
cessation  of  any  practice  found  to  constitute  Professional  Misconduct,  or  it  may  impose  a 
requirement of an affirmative act such as an audit of a Respondent's client trust account. 

.25.  Disposition  on  Appeal:  The  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals  may,  in  any  appeal  of  the 
judgment of an Evidentiary Panel within its jurisdiction: 
 

A. 

Affirm the decision of the Evidentiary Panel, in whole or in part; 

. 

Modify the Evidentiary Panel's judgment and affirm it as modified; 

.       Reverse the decision of the Evidentiary Panel, in whole or in part, and render the 

judgment that the Evidentiary Panel should have rendered; 

.       Reverse  the   Evidentiary   Panel's  judgment   and  remand   the   Disciplinary 
Proceeding for further proceeding by either the Evidentiary Panel or a statewide grievance  
committee panel composed of  members  selected from state bar districts other than the 
district from which the appeal was taken; 

.        Vacate the Evidentiary Panel's judgment and dismiss the case; or 

.        Dismiss the appeal.

.26.   Remand to Statewide Grievance Committee Panel: In determining whether a remand is 
heard by a statewide grievance committee panel, the Board of Disciplinary Appeals must find that 
good cause was shown in the record on appeal. The Board of Disciplinary Appeals shall randomly 
select the members of the statewide grievance committee panel from grievance committees other 
than the district from which the appeal was taken. Six such members shall be selected, four of 
whom are attorneys and two of whom are public members. The statewide grievance committee 
panel, once selected, shall have all duties and responsibilities of the Evidentiary Panel for purposes 
of the remand. 

.27.      Appeal  to  Supreme  Court  of  Texas:  An  appeal  from  the  decision  of  the  Board  of 
Disciplinary Appeals on an Evidentiary Proceeding is to the Supreme Court of Texas in accordance 
with Rule 7.11. 

omment: Consistent with section 81.086 of the Texas Government Code, these rules permit the 
Office  of  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  to  allow  or  require  anyone  involved  in  an  investigatory 
hearing, a summary disposition setting, or an evidentiary hearing—including but not limited to a 
party, attorney, witness, court reporter, or grievance panel member—to participate remotely, such 
as  by  teleconferencing,  videoconferencing,  or  other  means.  A  panel  may  consider  as  evidence 
sworn statements  or sworn  testimony  given remotely. The term “teleconference”  in  these rules 
includes videoconference or other remote means.

PART III.  TRIAL IN DISTRICT COURT 

.01.   Disciplinary Petition: If the Respondent timely elects to have the Complaint heard by a 
district court, with or without a jury, in accordance with Rule 2.15, the Chief Disciplinary Counsel 
shall, not more than sixty days after receipt of Respondent’s election to proceed in district court, 
notify the Presiding Judge of the administrative judicial region covering the county of appropriate 
venue of the Respondent’s election by transmitting a copy  of  the Disciplinary Petition in the name  
of  the Commission to the Presiding Judge. The petition must contain: 
 

Notice  that  the  action  is  brought  by  the  Commission  for  Lawyer  Discipline,  a 

A. 
committee of the State Bar. 

The name of the Respondent and the fact that he or she is an attorney licensed to 

practice law in the State of Texas. 

A request for assignment of an active district judge to preside in the case. 

Allegations necessary to establish proper venue. 

. 

A  description  of  the  acts  and  conduct  that  gave  rise  to  the  alleged  Professional 
Misconduct in detail sufficient to give fair notice to Respondent of the claims made, which 
factual  allegations  may  be  grouped  in  one  or  more  counts  based  upon  one  or  more 
Complaints. 

. 

A  listing  of  the  specific  rules  of  the  Texas  Disciplinary  Rules  of  Professional 
Conduct allegedly violated by the acts or conduct, or other grounds for seeking Sanctions. 

A  demand  for  judgment  that  the  Respondent  be  disciplined  as  warranted  by  the 

facts and for any other appropriate relief. 

Any other matter that is required or may be permitted by law or by these rules. 

.02.   Assignment of Judge:  

Assignment Generally: Upon receipt of a Disciplinary Petition, the Presiding Judge 
A. 
shall  assign  an  active  district  judge  whose  district  does  not  include  the  county  of 
appropriate venue to preside in the case. An assignment of a judge from another region 
shall be under Chapter 74, Government Code. The Presiding Judge shall transmit a copy 
of the Presiding Judge’s assignment order to the Chief Disciplinary Counsel. Should the 
judge so assigned be unable to fulfill the assignment, he or she shall immediately notify 
the  Presiding  Judge,  and  the  Presiding  Judge  shall  assign  a  replacement  judge  whose 
district does not include the county of appropriate venue.  A judge assigned under this Rule 
shall  be  subject  to  recusal  or  disqualification  as  provided  by  the  Texas  Rules  of  Civil 
Procedure and the laws of this state. The motion seeking recusal or motion to disqualify

must be filed by either party within the time provided by Rule 18a, Texas Rules of Civil 
Procedure. In the event of recusal or disqualification, the Presiding Judge shall assign a 
replacement judge whose district does not include the county of appropriate venue. If an 
active district judge assigned to a disciplinary case becomes a  retired, senior, or former 
judge, he or she may be assigned by the Presiding Judge to continue to preside in the case, 
provided the judge has been placed on a visiting judge list. If the Presiding Judge decides 
not  to  assign  the  retired,  senior,  or  former  judge  to  continue  to  preside  in  the  case,  the 
Presiding Judge  shall assign an active district judge  whose  district does  not  include the 
county  of  appropriate  venue.  A  visiting  judge  may  only  be  assigned  if  he  or  she  was 
originally assigned to preside in the case while an active judge. Any judge assigned under 
this Rule is not subject to objection under Chapter 74, Government Code.  

B. 
Transfer of Case: If the county of alleged venue is successfully challenged, the case 
shall be transferred to the county of proper venue. If the case is transferred to a county in 
the assigned judge’s district, the judge must recuse himself or herself, unless the parties 
waive  the  recusal  on  the  record.  In  the  event  of  recusal,  the  Presiding  Judge  of  the 
administrative  judicial  region  shall  assign  a  replacement  judge  whose  district  does  not 
include the county of appropriate venue. If the case is transferred to a county outside the 
administrative  judicial  region  of  the  Presiding  Judge  who  made  the  assignment,  the 
Presiding  Judge  of  the  administrative  judicial  region  where  the  case  is  transferred  shall 
oversee assignment for the case and the previously assigned judge shall continue to preside 
in  the  case  unless  he  or  she  makes  a  good  cause  objection  to  continued  assignment,  in 
which case the Presiding Judge shall assign a replacement judge whose district does not 
include the county of appropriate venue. 

.03.  Filing, Service and Venue: After  the trial judge has been  assigned, the Chief Disciplinary 
Counsel  shall  promptly  file  the  Disciplinary  Petition  and  a  copy  of  the  Presiding  Judge’s 
assignment order  with the  district clerk  of  the  county  of  alleged  venue.  The Respondent shall 
then be served as in civil cases generally with a copy of the Disciplinary Petition and a copy of the 
Presiding  Judge’s  assignment  order.  In  a  Disciplinary  Action,  venue  shall  be  in  the  county  of 
Respondent's principal place of practice; or if the Respondent does not maintain a place of practice 
within the State of Texas, in the county of Respondent's residence; or if the Respondent maintains 
neither a residence nor a place of practice within the State of Texas, then in the county where the 
alleged Professional Misconduct occurred, in whole or in part. In all other instances, venue is in 
Travis County, Texas. 

.04.   Answer of the Respondent: The answer of the Respondent must follow the form of answers 
in civil cases generally and must be filed no later than 10:00 a.m. on the first Monday following 
the expiration of twenty days after service upon the Respondent. 

.05.  Discovery:    Discovery  is  to  be  conducted  as  in  civil  cases  generally,  except  that  the 
following matters are not discoverable: 
 

The discussions, thought processes, and individual votes of the members of a 

A. 
Summary Disposition Panel. 
 

22 

   

  3

  3

  3

 

The thought processes of the Chief Disciplinary Counsel. 

Any  communication  to  or  from  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  that  would  be 

privileged in the case of a private attorney representing a private litigant. 

.06.   Trial by Jury: In a Disciplinary Action, either the Respondent or the Commission shall 
have the right to a  jury trial upon  timely  payment  of the  required  fee  and compliance  with the 
provisions of Rule 216, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. The Complainant has no right to demand 
a jury trial. 

.07.   Trial Setting: Disciplinary Actions shall be set for trial on a date not later than 180 days 
after the date the answer is filed, except for good cause shown. If the Respondent fails to answer, 
a default may be  taken  at any time  appropriate  under  the Texas Rules of  Civil  Procedure.  No 
motion for continuance, resetting, or agreed pass may be granted unless required by the interests 
of justice. 

.08.  Additional Rules of Procedure in the Trial of Disciplinary Actions: In all Disciplinary 
Actions brought under this part, the following additional rules apply: 
 

A.       Disciplinary Actions are civil in nature. 

Except as varied by these rules, the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure apply.  

Disciplinary Actions must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. 

.       The burden of proof in a Disciplinary Action seeking Sanction is on the Commission. 

The burden of proof in reinstatement cases is upon the applicant. 

.        The parties to a Disciplinary Action may not seek abatement or delay of trial because 
of substantial similarity to the material allegations in any other pending civil or criminal 
case. 

.        The unwillingness or neglect of a Complainant to assist in the prosecution of a 
Disciplinary  Action,  or  a  compromise  and  settlement  between  the  Complainant  and  the 
Respondent, does not alone justify the abatement or dismissal of the action. 

.       It shall be the policy of the Commission to participate in alternative dispute resolution 
procedures where feasible; provided, however, that Disciplinary Actions shall be exempt 
from any requirements of mandatory alternative dispute resolution procedures as provided 
by Chapter 154 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code or as otherwise provided by law. 

.09.   Judgment: If the trial court fails to find from the evidence in a case tried without a jury, or 
from the verdict in a jury trial, that the Respondent's conduct constitutes Professional Misconduct, 
the court shall render judgment accordingly. If the court finds that the Respondent's conduct does 
constitute  Professional  Misconduct,  the  court  shall  determine  the  appropriate  Sanction  or 
Sanctions  to  be  imposed.  If  the  court  finds  that  the  Respondent  committed  an  act  or  acts  of

23 

Professional Misconduct, the court shall direct transmittal of certified copies of the judgment and 
all trial pleadings to the Clerk of the Supreme Court. The Clerk  of  the  Supreme  Court  shall 
make    an    appropriate    notation    on   the    Respondent's  permanent  record.  The  trial  court  shall 
promptly enter judgment after the close of evidence (in the  case of a nonjury trial) or after the 
return of the jury's verdict.  Mandamus lies in the Supreme Court of Texas to enforce this provision, 
upon the petition of either the Respondent or the Chief Disciplinary Counsel. 

.10.   Terms of Judgment: In any judgment of disbarment or suspension that is not stayed, the 
court shall order the Respondent to surrender his or her law license and permanent State Bar card 
to Chief Disciplinary Counsel for transmittal to the Clerk of the Supreme Court. In all judgments 
imposing disbarment or suspension, the court shall enjoin the Respondent from practicing law or 
from holding himself or herself out as an  attorney eligible to practice law during the period of 
disbarment or suspension. In all judgments of disbarment, suspension, or reprimand, the court shall 
make all other orders as it finds appropriate, including probation of all or any portion of suspension. 
The  continuing  jurisdiction  of  the  trial  court  to  enforce  a  judgment  does  not  give  a  trial  court 
authority to terminate or reduce a period of active or probated suspension previously ordered. 

.11.      Restitution:  In  all  cases  in  which  the  proof  establishes  that  the  Respondent's    conduct 
involved misapplication of  funds    and    the   judgment   is  one   disbarring   or   suspending   the 
Respondent, the judgment must require the Respondent to make restitution during the period of 
suspension,  or  before  any  consideration  of  reinstatement  from  disbarment,  and  shall  further 
provide  that  a  judgment  of  suspension  shall  remain  in  effect  until  proof  is  made  of  complete 
restitution. 

.12.   Probation Suspension--Revocation Procedure: If all or any part of a suspension from the 
practice of law is probated under this Part III, the court retains jurisdiction during the full term of 
suspension, including any probationary period, to hear a motion to revoke probation. If the Chief 
Disciplinary Counsel files a motion to revoke probation, it shall be set for hearing before the court 
without the aid of a jury within thirty days of service of the motion upon the Respondent. Service 
upon the Respondent shall be sufficient if made in accordance with Rule 21a of the Texas Rules 
of Civil Procedure. Upon proof by a preponderance of the evidence of a violation of probation, the 
same shall be revoked and the attorney suspended from the practice of law for the full term of 
suspension without credit for any probationary time served. 

.13.   No Supersedeas: A district court judgment of disbarment or an order revoking probation 
of a suspension from the practice of law cannot be superseded or stayed.  The Respondent may 
within thirty days from entry of judgment petition the court to stay a judgment of suspension. The 
Respondent carries the burden of proof by preponderance of the evidence to establish by competent 
evidence that the Respondent's continued practice of law does not pose a continuing threat to the 
welfare of Respondent's clients or to the public. A judgment of suspension shall be stayed during 
the pendency of any appeals therefrom if the district court finds that the Respondent has met that 
burden  of  proof.  The  district  court  may  condition  its  stay  upon  reasonable  terms,  which  may 
include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  cessation  of  any  practice  found  to  constitute  Professional 
Misconduct, or it may impose a requirement of an affirmative act such as an audit of a Respondent's 
client trust account. There is no interlocutory appeal from a court's stay of a suspension, with or 
without conditions.

.14.   Exemption from Cost and Appeal Bond: No cost or appeal bond is required of the Chief 
Disciplinary Counsel or the Commission. In lieu thereof, when a cost or appeal bond would be 
otherwise required, a memorandum setting forth the exemption under this rule, when filed, suffices 
as a cost or appeal bond. 

.15.  Appeals: A final judgment of the district court and any order revoking or refusing to revoke 
probation of a suspension from the practice of law may be appealed as in civil cases generally.

PART V. CHIEF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL 

.01.   Selection: The General Counsel of the State Bar shall, subject to the provisions of this Rule, 
serve as the Chief Disciplinary Counsel under these rules. If the Commission determines that the 
General Counsel of the State Bar should no longer function as the Chief Disciplinary Counsel, 
then the Commission shall notify the Board of such decision and, in the next succeeding  fiscal 
year of the State Bar, funds shall be provided to the Commission sufficient for it to select and hire 
a lawyer as Chief Disciplinary Counsel and sufficient deputies and assistants as may be required 
to  operate  the  disciplinary  and  disability  system  effectively  and  efficiently.  The  Commission's 
determination must be made, if at all, and the notification herein provided must be given, if at all, 
during the months of January or February 1993, or during the same months of any odd numbered 
year  thereafter.  In  such  event,  the  Commission  shall  alone  possess  the  right  of  selection,  but 
nothing  herein  precludes  its  employment  of  the  General  Counsel  or  a  member  of  the  General 
Counsel's staff for such positions.

Disciplinary Counsel shall: 
 

A.       Review and screen all information coming to his or her attention or to the attention 
of the Commission relating to lawyer misconduct. Such review may encompass whatever 
active investigation is deemed necessary by the Chief Disciplinary Counsel independent of 
the filing of a writing. 

.              Reject  all  matters  and  Inquiries  not  constituting  a  Complaint  and  so  advise  the 

. 

Investigate  Complaints  to  ascertain  whether  Just  Cause  exists.  The  investigation

Proceeding from one Committee to another within the same District if the Committee fails 
or refuses to hear the Disciplinary Proceeding. 

.                Move    the    Board    of    Disciplinary    Appeals    to    transfer    matters    from    one 
Committee to another, whether or not within the same District, when the requirements of 
fairness to the Complainant or the Respondent require. 

.              Represent  the  Commission  in  all  Complaints,  Disciplinary  Proceedings  and 

Disciplinary Actions in which the Commission is the client. 

.       When information regarding a Complaint becomes eligible for public disclosure 
under  these  rules,  refer  a  Complaint  and  information  related  thereto  to  any  other 
professional organizations or bodies that he or she deems appropriate for consultation on 
the nature of the Complaint, the events giving rise to the Complaint, and the proper manner 
of  resolution  of  the  Complaint.  The  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  shall  provide  the 
Respondent  written  notice  of  the  referral  at  the  time  it  is  made.  Neither  the  Chief 
Disciplinary  Counsel  nor  any  person  or  body  acting  under  these  rules  is  bound  by  any 
recommendation  of  another  professional  organization  to  which the  Complaint or related 
information is referred under this Rule.

motion must state the terms or conditions of the probation and the conduct alleged to violate 
the same. The Chief Disciplinary Counsel shall cause a copy of the motion to be served on 
the attorney involved.

accountable only to the Commission. 
 

PART VI. PUBLIC INFORMATION AND ACCESS 

.01.   Availability  of Materials: The Commission shall  ensure that  sufficient copies of these 
rules, the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct, and forms for the filing of disciplinary 
Grievances are made available to the public. In addition, the Commission shall make available to 
the public a brochure, summarizing in plain language the disciplinary and disability system for 
attorneys in the State of Texas. Such brochure shall be made available in English and in Spanish. 

.02.   Public and Media Inquiries: The Commission shall respond,  as appropriate, to all public 
and  media  inquiries  concerning  the  operation  of  the  attorney  professional  disciplinary  and 
disability system,  but in so doing  may not disclose information that is confidential or privileged. 
The Commission shall disclose, upon proper request, information in its custody or control that is 
neither confidential nor privileged. Any attorney may waive confidentiality and privilege as to his 
or  her  disciplinary  record  by  filing  an  appropriate  waiver  on  a  form  to  be  prescribed  by  the 
Commission. The Commission shall maintain complete records and files of all  disciplinary  and  
disability  matters  and  compile  reports  and  statistics to  aid  in  the administration of the system. 

.03.   Telephone  Inquiries: The  Commission shall maintain a toll-free  telephone number. The 
toll-free number shall be publicized to ensure that all Texas residents have access to it. Telephone 
inquiries  about  specific  attorney  conduct  will  not  be  taken,  but  the  Commission  will  send  a 
Grievance form to any person or entity inquiring by telephone. 

.04.   Abstracts   of  Appeals:   Any  Disciplinary  Proceeding    appealed   to   the   Board  of 
Disciplinary  Appeals  shall  be  abstracted  by  the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals.  A  copy  of  the 
abstract shall be made  available to any person or other entity upon proper request and shall be 
published in the Texas Bar Journal. No information that is otherwise confidential may be disclosed 
in an abstract under these provisions. 

.05.   Report to  the Clerk of the Supreme Court: The final disposition of any Disciplinary 
Proceeding or Disciplinary Action resulting in the imposition of a Sanction other than a private 
reprimand (which may include restitution and payment of attorneys' fees) shall be reported by the 
Commission to the Clerk of the Supreme Court of Texas. 

.06.  Court and Board of Disciplinary Appeals Opinions: 

A.       Court Opinions:  In any case arising out of a Complaint, an opinion of a court of 
appeals issued on or after May 1, 1992 has precedential value regardless of its designation. 

.      Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals  Opinions:  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals opinions 
are  open  to  the  public and  must be  made  available  to  public reporting services, print 
or  electronic,  for  publishing.  These  opinions  are  persuasive,  not  precedential,  in 
disciplinary proceedings tried in district court.

Comment to 2009 change: Rule 6.06 is divided into two subdivisions. The language in subdivision 
A is amended to remove an outdated reference to the official reporter system and to be consistent 
with  Texas  Rule  of  Appellate  Procedure  (TRAP)  47  amendments  intended  to  prospectively 
discontinue  designating  opinions  as  either  “published”  or  “unpublished.”  The  erroneously 
designated  opinions  addressed  in  subdivision  A  have  precedential  value  from  May  1,  1992  on 
because that is the effective date of the prior version of the rule, which mandated publication of 
“[a]ll  cases  involving  the  Professional  Misconduct  or  Disability  of  an  attorney  appealed  to  the 
Courts of Appeal [sic] or to the Supreme Court of Texas.” New subdivision B addresses Board of 
Disciplinary  Appeals  (BODA)  opinions  and  includes  a  distribution  provision  similar  to  TRAP 
47.3.  This  change  provides  for  the  publication  of  BODA  opinions  issued  in  any  type  of  case, 
whether pursuant to BODA's original or appellate jurisdiction. 

.07.   Publication of Disciplinary Results: The final disposition of all Disciplinary Proceedings 
and  Disciplinary  Actions  shall  be  reported  in  the  Texas  Bar  Journal,  and  shall  be  sent  for 
publication  to  a  newspaper  of  general  circulation  in  the  county  of  the  disciplined  attorney's 
residence or office. Private reprimands (which may include restitution and payment of attorneys' 
fees)  shall  be  published  in  the  Texas  Bar  Journal  with  the  name  of  the  attorney  deleted.  The 
Commission  shall  report  all  public  discipline  imposed  against  an  attorney,  suspensions  due  to 
Disability,  and  reinstatements  to  the  National  Discipline  Data  Bank  of  the  American  Bar 
Association. 

.08.      Access  to  Confidential  Information:  No  officer  or  Director  of  the  State  Bar  or  any 
appointed adviser to the Commission shall have access to any confidential information relating to 
any Disciplinary Proceeding, Disciplinary Action, or Disability suspension. The Office of Chief 
Disciplinary  Counsel  may  provide  this  information  to  authorized  agencies  investigating 
qualifications  for  admission  to  practice,  attorney  discipline  enforcement  agencies,  law 
enforcement  agencies,  the  State  Bar's  Client  Security  Fund,  the  State  Bar's  Lawyer  Assistance 
Program, the Supreme Court's Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee and its subcommittees 
and the Commission on Judicial Conduct.

further  solemnly swear (or affirm)  that I  will keep  secret all such matters and 
things as shall come to my knowledge as a member of the Board of Disciplinary  
Appeals  arising  from    or    in    connection    with  each    Disciplinary  Action  and 
Disciplinary Proceeding unless permitted to disclose the same in accordance with 
the Rules of Disciplinary Procedure or unless ordered to do so in the course of a 
judicial  proceeding  or  a  proceeding  before  the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals.  I 
further solemnly swear (or affirm) that I have neither directly nor indirectly paid, 
offered, or promised to pay, contributed any money or valuable thing, or promised 
any public or private office to secure my appointment. So help me God.” 

.05.   Quorum:  Six members constitute a quorum of the Board of Disciplinary Appeals, except 
that a panel of  three members  may hear  appeals and such other matters  as may be  specifically 
delegated to it by the Chair. The Board of Disciplinary Appeals and each of its panels may act only 
with the concurrence of a majority of those members present and voting.

.09.   Meetings: The Board of Disciplinary Appeals shall meet en banc at least once each year at 
the call of its chair. Its members may meet more often en banc at the call of the chair or upon  the 
written  request  to  the  chair  of    at  least  three    of    the  members    of    the  Board    of  Disciplinary 
Appeals. 

.10.   Conference Calls: The Board of Disciplinary Appeals may, at the instance of the chair, 
conduct its business by conference telephone calls. Any action taken in a telephone conference 
must be reduced to writing and signed by each participant certifying the accuracy of the written 
record of action taken. 

.11.   Judicial Review: An appeal from a determination of the Board of Disciplinary Appeals 
shall be to the Supreme Court. Within fourteen days after receipt of notice of a final determination 
by the Board of Disciplinary Appeals, the party appealing must file a notice of appeal directly with

expressly  provided,  the  appeal  must  be  made  pursuant  to  the  then  applicable  Texas  Rules  of 
Appellate Procedure.  Oral argument may be granted on motion. The case shall be reviewed under

that  a  statement  constitutes  an  Inquiry  or  transferring  cases  are  conclusive,  and  may  not  be 
appealed to the Supreme Court. 

.12.   Open  Meetings and  Open  Records: The  Board  of  Disciplinary Appeals is not  a 
“governmental body”  as that term  is defined  in  Section 551.001 or  Section 552.003 of V.T.C.A., 
Government  Code,  and is  not subject  to either  the provisions  of  the  Open Meetings  Act or the 
Open Records Act. 

omment: These rules permit the Board of Disciplinary Appeals, upon decision of its chair, to 
allow  or  require  anyone  involved  in  a  matter  before  the  Board—including  but  not  limited  to  a 
party,  attorney,  witness,  court  reporter,  or  Board  member—to  participate  remotely,  such  as  by 
teleconferencing, videoconferencing, or other means.  The Board may consider as evidence sworn 
statements or sworn testimony given remotely.  
 

PART VIII.  COMPULSORY DISCIPLINE 

.01.   Generally: When an attorney licensed to practice law in Texas has been convicted of an 
Intentional Crime or has been placed on probation for an  Intentional Crime with or without an 
adjudication  of guilt, the Chief  Disciplinary Counsel shall initiate a Disciplinary Action seeking 
compulsory  discipline  pursuant  to  this  part.  The  completion  or  termination  of  any  term  of 
incarceration, probation, parole, or any similar court ordered supervised period does not bar action 
under Part VIII of these rules as hereinafter provided. Proceedings under this part are not exclusive 
in that an attorney may be disciplined as a result of the underlying facts as well as being disciplined 
upon the conviction or probation through deferred adjudication. 

.02.  Conclusive Evidence: In any Disciplinary Action brought under this part, the record of 
conviction or order of deferred adjudication is conclusive evidence of the attorney's guilt. 

.03.   Commencement of Suit: A Disciplinary Action under this part must be initiated by the 
filing  of  a  petition  with  the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals.  The    petition  must  allege    the 
adjudication of guilt (or probation without an adjudication of guilt) of an Intentional Crime; allege 
that the Respondent is the same person as the party adjudicated guilty or who received probation 
with  or  without  an  adjudication    of  guilt  for  such  Intentional  Crime;  and  seek  the  appropriate 
discipline. 

.04.   Procedure: The Board of Disciplinary Appeals shall hear and determine all questions of 
law and fact. When  an attorney has been convicted of an Intentional Crime or has been placed on 
probation for an Intentional Crime without an adjudication of guilt, he or she shall be  suspended  
as an  attorney  licensed to practice law in Texas during  the  appeal of  the conviction or  the  order  
of  deferred  adjudication.  Upon introduction into evidence of a certified copy of the judgment of 
conviction or order of deferred adjudication and a certificate of the Clerk of the Supreme Court 
that  the  attorney  is  licensed  to  practice  law  in  Texas,  the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals  shall 
immediately determine whether the attorney has been convicted of an Intentional Crime or granted 
probation without an adjudication of guilt for an Intentional Crime. Uncontroverted affidavits that 
the  attorney  is  the  same  person  as  the  person  convicted  or  granted  probation  without  an 
adjudication of guilt are competent and sufficient evidence of those facts. Nothing in these rules 

  7

  C

  8

  8

  8

  8

 

34 

prohibits proof of the necessary elements in such Disciplinary Action by competent evidence in 
any  other  manner  permitted  by  law.  The  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals  shall  sit,  hear  and 
determine whether the attorney should be disciplined and enter judgment accordingly within forty-
five days of the answer day; however, any failure to do so within the time limit will not affect its 
jurisdiction to act. Any suspension ordered during the appeal of a criminal conviction or probation 
without an adjudication of guilt is interlocutory and immediately terminates if the conviction or 
probation is set aside or reversed. 

.05.      Disbarment:  When  an  attorney  has  been  convicted  of  an  Intentional  Crime,  and  that 
conviction has become final, or the attorney has accepted probation with or without an adjudication 
of guilt for an Intentional Crime, the attorney shall be disbarred unless the Board of Disciplinary 
Appeals, under Rule 8.06, suspends his or her license to practice law. If the attorney's license to 
practice  law  has  been  suspended  during  the  appeal  of  the  criminal  conviction,  the  Chief 
Disciplinary  Counsel  shall  file  a  motion  for  final  judgment  of  disbarment  with  the  Board  of 
Disciplinary  Appeals.  If  the  motion  is  supported  by  affidavits  or  certified  copies  of  court 
documents  showing  that  the  conviction  has  become  final,  the  motion  shall  be  granted  without 
hearing, unless within ten days following the service of the motion pursuant to Rule 21a of the 
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, upon the attorney so convicted or his or her attorney of record, 
the attorney so convicted files a verified denial contesting the finality of the judgment,  in which 
event  the  Board  of  Disciplinary Appeals will immediately  conduct a hearing to determine the 
issue. If no Disciplinary Action is pending at the time the conviction becomes final, disbarment 
shall be initiated by filing a Disciplinary Action. 

.06.   Suspension: If an attorney's sentence upon  conviction of  a Serious Crime  is fully probated, 
or if an attorney receives probation through deferred adjudication in connection with a Serious 
Crime, the attorney's license to practice law shall be suspended during the term of probation. If an 
attorney is suspended during the term of probation, the suspension shall be conditioned upon the 
attorney's satisfactorily completing the terms of probation. If probation is revoked, the attorney 
shall be disbarred. An early termination of probation does not result in reinstatement until the entire 
probationary period, as originally assessed, has expired. 

.07.   Early Termination: An early termination of criminal probation shall have no effect on any 
judgment entered pursuant to Part VIII. 

.08. No Supersedeas: In compulsory discipline cases, either party shall have the right  to appeal 
to  the  Supreme  Court  of  Texas  but  no  Respondent  suspended  or  disbarred  by  the  Board  of 
Disciplinary Appeals shall be entitled to practice law in any form while the appeal is pending and 
shall have no right to supersede the judgment by bond or otherwise. 
 

PART  IX.  RECIPROCAL DISCIPLINE 

.01.   Orders  From  Other  Jurisdictions: Upon  receipt of  information indicating  that an 
attorney licensed to practice law in Texas has been disciplined in another jurisdiction, including 
by any federal court or federal agency, the Chief  Disciplinary Counsel shall diligently  seek to 
obtain a certified  copy of the order  or judgment  of discipline from the other jurisdiction,  and file 
it  with the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals  along  with  a  petition  requesting  that  the  attorney  be 

  8

  8

  8

  8

  9

 

35 

disciplined  in  Texas.  A  certified  copy  of  the  order  or  judgment  is  prima  facie  evidence  of  the 
matters contained therein, and a final adjudication in another jurisdiction that an attorney licensed 
to practice law in Texas has committed Professional Misconduct is conclusive for the purposes of 
a Disciplinary Action under this Part, subject to the defenses set forth in Rule 9.04 below.  For 
purposes of this Part, “discipline” by a federal court or federal agency means a public reprimand, 
suspension, or disbarment; the term does not include a letter of “warning” or “admonishment” or 
a similar advisory by a federal court of federal agency.  

.02.      Notice  to  the  Respondent:  Upon  the  filing  of  the  petition,  the  Board  of  Disciplinary 
Appeals shall issue a notice to the attorney, containing a copy of the petition, a copy of the order 
or judgment from the other jurisdiction, and an order directing the attorney to show cause within 
thirty days from the date of the mailing of the notice why the imposition of the identical discipline 
in this state would be unwarranted. 

.03.   Discipline to be Imposed: If the attorney  fails to file his or her answer with the Board of 
Disciplinary  Appeals  within  the  thirty-day  period  provided  by    Rule  9.02,  the  Board  of 
Disciplinary Appeals shall enter a judgment imposing discipline identical, to the extent practicable, 
with  that  imposed  in  the  other  jurisdiction.    If  the  attorney  files  an  answer,  the  Board  of 
Disciplinary Appeals shall proceed to determine the case upon the pleadings, the evidence, and the 
briefs, if any. 

.04.   Defenses: If the Respondent files an answer, he or she shall allege, and thereafter be required 
to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, to the Board of Disciplinary Appeals one or more of 
the following defenses to avoid the imposition of discipline identical, to  the extent practicable, 
with that directed by the judgment of the other jurisdiction: 
 

A.        That the procedure followed in the other jurisdiction on the disciplinary matter was 
so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of due process. 

.       That there was such an infirmity of proof  establishing the misconduct in the other 
jurisdiction as to give rise to the clear conviction that the Board of Disciplinary Appeals, 
consistent with its duty, should not accept as final  the conclusion on the evidence reached 
in the other jurisdiction. 

.       That the imposition by the Board of Disciplinary Appeals of discipline identical, to 
the extent practicable, with that imposed by the other jurisdiction would  result in grave 
injustice. 

.              That  the  misconduct  established  in  the  other  jurisdiction  warrants  substantially 

different discipline in this state. 

.       That the misconduct for which the attorney was disciplined in the other jurisdiction 

does not constitute Professional Misconduct in this state. 

  B

  C

  D

  E

f the Board of Disciplinary Appeals determines that one or more of the foregoing defenses have 
been established, it shall enter such orders as it deems necessary and appropriate.

PART X. RESIGNATION IN LIEU OF DISCIPLINE 

0.01. Disciplinary Resignation: Any person licensed to practice law in the State of Texas shall 
be permitted to file a motion for resignation in lieu of discipline, in a form promulgated by the 
Commission, in the Supreme Court of Texas, attaching thereto his or her Texas law license and 
permanent State Bar membership card. 

0.02. Response of Chief Disciplinary Counsel: The Chief Disciplinary Counsel shall, within 
twenty days after service upon him or her of a motion for resignation in lieu of discipline, file a 
response  on  behalf  of  the  State  Bar  (acting  through  the  Commission)  stating  whether  the 
acceptance of the resignation is in the best interest of the public and the profession and setting 
forth a detailed statement of the Professional Misconduct with which the movant is charged. The 
movant may, within ten days after service of such response, withdraw the motion. If a motion to 
withdraw is not timely filed, the detailed statement of Professional Misconduct shall be deemed to 
have been conclusively established for all purposes. 

0.03.  Effect of Filing: The filing of a motion for resignation in lieu of discipline does not, without 
the  consent  of    the    Chief    Disciplinary    Counsel,  serve  to  delay    or    abate  any    then  pending 
Grievance, Complaint, Disciplinary Proceeding,  Disciplinary Action or disciplinary investigation. 

0.04. Acceptance of Resignation and Notification: Any motion to resign in lieu of discipline 
under this part must be filed in the Supreme Court and is ineffective until and unless accepted by 
written  order  of  the  Supreme  Court.  The  movant;  the  Evidentiary  Panel  Chair,  if  any;  the 
Commission; and the Complainant, if any, shall be notified by the Chief Disciplinary Counsel of 
the Court's disposition of such motion. 

0.05. Effect of Resignation: Any resignation under this part shall be treated as a disbarment for 
all purposes, including client notification, discontinuation of practice, and reinstatement. 
 

PART XI.  REINSTATEMENT AFTER DISBARMENT OR RESIGNATION 

1.01. Eligibility and Venue: A disbarred person or a person who has resigned in lieu of discipline 
may, at any time after the expiration of five years from the date of final judgment of disbarment 
or the date of Supreme Court order accepting resignation in lieu of discipline, petition the district

including any period of probation and/or parole. If, at the time the petition for reinstatement is

1.03. Burden of Proof: The petitioner has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the 
evidence that the best interests of the public  and  the  profession,  as  well  as the  ends  of  justice,  
would be served  by his or her reinstatement. The court shall deny the petition for reinstatement if 
it contains any false statement of a material fact or if the petitioner fails to meet the burden of 
proof. 

1.04. Notice and Procedure: The petitioner shall serve notice of a petition for reinstatement by 
U.S. certified mail, return receipt requested, on the Chief Disciplinary Counsel and shall publish 
the  notice  as  a  paid  classified  announcement  in  the  Texas  Bar  Journal.  After  the  filing  of  the

Any other evidence relevant to the issues of the petitioner's fitness to practice law 

G. 
and the likelihood that the petitioner will not engage in further misconduct. 

1.06. Judgment and Conditions: If the court is satisfied after hearing all the evidence, both in 
support and in opposition to the petition, that the material allegations of the petition are true and 
that the best interests of the public and the profession, as well as the ends of justice, will be served, 
the  court  may  render  judgment  authorizing  the  petitioner  to  be  reinstated  upon  his  or  her 
compliance  within  eighteen  months  from  the  date  of  the  judgment    with  Rule  II  of  the  Rules 
Governing Admission to the Bar of Texas in effect as of the date upon which judgment authorizing 
reinstatement  is  entered.  The  judgment  shall  direct  the  Board  of  Law  Examiners  to  admit  the 
petitioner  to  a  regularly  scheduled  bar  examination  in  accordance  with  that  Board's  rules  and 
procedures  relating  to  the  examination  of  persons  who  have  not  previously  been  licensed  as 
lawyers  in Texas or in any other state. No judgment of reinstatement may be rendered by default. 
If  after  hearing  all  the  evidence  the  court  determines  that  the  petitioner  is  not  eligible  for 
reinstatement, the court may, in its discretion, either enter a judgment denying the petition or direct 
that the petition be held in abeyance for a reasonable period of time until the petitioner provides 
additional proof that he or she has satisfied the requirements of these rules. The court's judgment 
may include such other orders as protecting the public and the petitioner's potential clients may 
require. 

1.07. Appeal and Readmission: When a judgment has been signed in any proceeding under this 
part, the petitioner and the Commission shall each have a right of appeal. If the petition is granted 
and  an  appeal  is  perfected,  the  trial  court's  judgment  shall  be  stayed  pending  resolution  of  the 
appeal.  After  the  petitioner  has  complied  with the  terms  of  the  judgment   of reinstatement 
and with this part, he or she shall furnish the Commission with a certified copy of the judgment 
and evidence of compliance and shall pay all membership fees, license fees and assessments then 
owed  and  the  costs  of  the  reinstatement  proceeding.  Upon  receipt  of  a  certified  copy    of    the  
judgment,  evidence  of  compliance  and  proof  of  payment  of  all membership fees, license fees 
and assessments then owed, the Commission shall direct the Chief Disciplinary Counsel to issue 
a declaration of the petitioner's eligibility for licensure to the Clerk of the Supreme Court. Upon 
receipt of such declaration, the Clerk of the Supreme Court shall enter the name of the petitioner 
on the membership rolls of the Supreme Court and shall issue a new Bar card and law license in 
the name of the petitioner reflecting as the date of licensure the date of the declaration of eligibility. 
Once  the  petitioner  has  taken  the  attorney's  oath,  the  new  Bar  card  and  law  license  shall  be 
delivered by the Clerk of the Supreme Court to the petitioner. 

1.08. Repetitioning: If a petition for reinstatement is denied after a hearing on the merits, the 
petitioner is not eligible to file another petition until after the expiration of three years from the 
date of final judgment denying the last preceding petition. 
 

PART XII.  DISABILITY SUSPENSION 

2.01. Grounds for Suspension: Any person licensed to practice law in the State of Texas shall 
be suspended for an indefinite period upon a finding that the attorney is suffering from a 
Disability.

40 

12.02.      Procedure:  Should  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  reasonably  believe  based  upon 
investigation of the Complaint that an attorney is suffering from a Disability and be authorized or 
directed to do so by the Commission, the Chief Disciplinary Counsel shall forward the Complaint 
and any other documents or statements which support a finding that the attorney is suffering from 
a Disability immediately to the Board of Disciplinary Appeals. Upon receipt of the Complaint and 
documents, the Board of Disciplinary Appeals shall forward it to a District Disability Committee 
to be composed of one attorney; one doctor of medicine or mental health care provider holding a 
doctorate degree, trained in the area of Disability; and one public member who does not have any 
interest, directly or indirectly, in the practice of the law other than as a consumer.  The  members  
of  the  District Disability  Committee  shall be appointed  ad  hoc  by  the  chair  of  the  Board  of  
Disciplinary  Appeals.  The Board of Disciplinary Appeals may appoint any attorney to represent 
the interests of the disabled attorney. 

2.03.  District  Disability  Committee:  The  same  rules  regarding  immunity,  expenses,  and 
confidentiality as apply to members of a Committee shall apply to the members appointed to a 
District  Disability  Committee.  The  District  Disability  Committee  shall  proceed  in  a  de  novo 
proceeding to receive evidence and determine whether the attorney is suffering from a Disability. 
In all cases where the referral has been made by the Chief Disciplinary Counsel, the Commission 
shall carry the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the attorney suffers 
from  a  Disability.  In  all  cases  where  the  referral  is  made  by  an  Evidentiary  Panel,  the  party 
asserting that the attorney is suffering from a Disability shall carry the burden of establishing by a 
preponderance of the evidence that the attorney suffers from a Disability. The Respondent shall be 
given reasonable notice and shall be afforded an opportunity to appear before, and present evidence 
to, the District Disability Committee. If there is no finding of Disability by the District Disability 
Committee, the entire record and the finding of the District Disability Committee will be returned 
to the Chief Disciplinary Counsel and the matter shall continue in the disciplinary process from 
the  point  where  it  was  referred  to  the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals  for  the  determination  of 
Disability.  If,  however,  there  is  a  finding  of  Disability,  the  District  Disability  Committee  shall 
certify the finding to the Board of Disciplinary Appeals. 

2.04. Board of Disciplinary Appeals' Responsibilities: Upon receiving a finding of Disability 
from the District Disability Committee, the Board of Disciplinary Appeals shall immediately enter 
its order suspending the attorney indefinitely. The record of all proceedings on disability must be 
sealed  and  must  remain  confidential,  except  as  to  the  Respondent;  only  the  order  of  indefinite 
suspension is to be made public. 

2.05. Effect on Limitations: Any statute of limitations applying to a disciplinary matter is tolled 
during the period of any Disability suspension. 

2.06. Reinstatement After Disability Suspension: 

A. 
Venue: An attorney who has been indefinitely suspended under this part may have 
the  suspension  terminated  by  filing  a  verified  petition  with  the  Board  of  Disciplinary 
Appeals or a district court. Venue of a district court action is: 

1. 

In  the  county,  immediately  prior  to  suspension,  of  the  Respondent's 

  1

41 

If the Respondent did not maintain a place of  practice immediately before 
. 
suspension within the State of Texas, in the county of the Respondent's residence. 

If neither 1. nor 2. applies, then in Travis County, Texas. 

  2

. 

  3

principal place of practice. 

Petition  and  Service:  The  petition  must  set  out  the  attorney's  name,  address,  the 
B. 
date, and the docket number of the suspension, a detailed description of his or her activities 
since the suspension, including employment, the details of any hospitalization or medical 
treatment, and any other matters the attorney believes entitles him or her to termination of 
the suspension. A copy of the petition shall be served by U.S. certified mail, return receipt 
requested, upon the Chief Disciplinary Counsel and the matter shall promptly thereafter be 
set for hearing.  The petition must have the following documents attached: a certified copy 
of any court order pertaining to the petitioner's competence;  an  affidavit  from  a mental 
health care provider as to the petitioner's current condition; and a report from a physician 
as to the petitioner's current condition if the suspension was based in whole or in part on 
the abuse or use of alcohol or other drugs. Such attachments shall not constitute evidence, 
per  se,  but  the  attachment  of  the  same  is  a  requirement  of  pleading.  In  an  action  for 
reinstatement under this part, either the petitioner or the Commission shall have the right 
to a jury trial upon  timely payment of the required fee. 

. 

Burden of Proof: The petitioner has the burden to come forward and prove, by a 
preponderance of the evidence, that the  reasons for suspension no longer  exist  and that 
termination of the suspension would be without danger to the public and the profession. 
The Board of Disciplinary Appeals or the district court, as the case may be, may order the 
petitioner to be examined by one or more health care providers trained in the area for which 
the attorney was suspended. 

. 

Time for Filing Subsequent Petitions: A first petition for termination of suspension 
may be filed at any time after the petitioner's license has been suspended under this part. If 
the first petition is denied after a hearing, subsequent petitions may not be filed until the 
expiration of one year from the date of the denial of the last preceding petition. 

. 

Judgment:  If  the  attorney  meets  the  burden  of  proof,  the  Board  of  Disciplinary 
Appeals or the district court shall order a termination of the period of suspension, provided 
that whenever  an attorney has been  suspended  for a  period of  two  or  more  consecutive 
years, he or she may be required by the Board of Disciplinary Appeals or the district court, 
as the case may  be, to obtain a passing grade  on  the multistate Professional Responsibility 
portion of the State Bar examination administered by the Board of Law Examiners, or take 
a prescribed course of study through a law school or through continuing legal education 
courses, or do both. 

Disability Probation: The Board of Disciplinary Appeals or the district court, as the 
F. 
case  may  be,  may  order  that  an  attorney  be  placed  on  probation  if  the  attorney  has 
demonstrated each of the following: 

  C

  D

  E

42 

 

 

 

The  ability  to  perform  legal  services  and  that  the  attorney's  continued 

1. 
practice of law will not cause the courts or profession to fall into disrepute. 

The  unlikelihood  of  any  harm  to  the  public  during  the  period  of 
. 
rehabilitation  and      the     adequate      supervision     of     necessary      conditions  of 
probation. 

A Disability that can be successfully arrested and treated while the attorney 

. 
is engaged in the practice of law. 

Probation shall be ordered for a specified period of time or until further order of the Board 
of Disciplinary Appeals or the district court, as the case may be, whenever a suspension is 
probated in whole or in part. 

G. 
Conditions: The order placing an attorney on Disability probation must state the 
conditions  of  probation.  The  conditions  must  take  into  consideration  the  nature  and 
circumstances of the Professional Misconduct and the history, character, and condition of 
the  attorney.  Any  or  all  of  the  following  conditions,  and  such  others  as  the  Board  of 
Disciplinary Appeals or the district court deems appropriate, may be imposed: 

1. 

Periodic reports to the Chief Disciplinary Counsel. 

Supervision over client trust accounts as the Board of Disciplinary Appeals 

. 
or the district court may direct. 

. 

Satisfactory completion of a course of study.

H. 
Administration:    The      Chief      Disciplinary  Counsel  is  responsible  for      the 
supervision of attorneys placed on Disability probation. Where appropriate, he or she may 
recommend to the Board of Disciplinary Appeals or to the district court, as the case may 
be,  the  modification  of  the  conditions  and  shall  report  any  failure  of  the  probationer  to 
comply with the conditions of probation. Upon a showing of failure to comply with the 
conditions of probation, the Board of Disciplinary Appeals or the district court, as the case 
may be, may revoke the probation or impose such other conditions deemed necessary for 
the protection of the public and the rehabilitation of the attorney. 

2.07.  Appeals: A  final judgment of the Board  of Disciplinary  Appeals  denying  a petition for 
reinstatement may be appealed to the Supreme Court. If such an appeal is taken, it must be filed 
with the Clerk of the Supreme Court within fourteen days after the receipt by the appealing party 
of the determination of the Board of Disciplinary Appeals. Except as herein expressly provided, 
an appeal must be made pursuant to the then applicable Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure. Oral 
argument may be granted on motion. The case shall be reviewed under the substantial-evidence 
rule.  The  Court  may  affirm  a  decision  of  the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals  by  order  without 
written opinion. A final judgment of a district court denying a petition for reinstatement may be 
appealed as in civil cases generally. 
 

PART XIII.  CESSATION OF PRACTICE 

3.01. Notice of Attorney's Cessation of Practice: When an attorney licensed to practice law in 
Texas dies, resigns, becomes inactive, is disbarred, or is suspended, leaving an active client matter 
for which no other attorney licensed to practice in Texas, with the consent of the client, has agreed 
to  assume  responsibility,  written  notice  of  such  cessation  of  practice  shall  be  mailed  to  those 
clients,  opposing  counsel,  courts,  agencies  with  which  the  attorney  has  matters  pending, 
malpractice insurers, and any other person or entity having reason to be informed of the cessation 
of practice. If the attorney has died, the notice may be given by the personal representative of the 
estate  of  the  attorney  or  by  any  person  having  lawful  custody  of  the  files  and  records  of  the 
attorney, including those persons who have been employed by the deceased attorney. In all other 
cases, notice shall be given by the attorney, a person authorized by the attorney, a person having 
lawful  custody  of  the  files  of  the  attorney,  or  by  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel.  If  the  client  has 
consented to the assumption of responsibility for the matter by another attorney licensed to practice 
law in Texas, then the above notification requirements are not necessary and no further action is 
required. 

3.02. Assumption of Jurisdiction: A client of the attorney, Chief Disciplinary Counsel, or any 
other interested person may petition a district court in the county of the attorney's residence to 
assume jurisdiction over the attorney’s law practice. If the attorney has died, such petition may be 
filed in a statutory probate court. The petition must be verified and must state the facts necessary 
to  show  cause  to  believe  that  notice  of  cessation  is  required  under  this  part.  It  must  state  the 

 

  1

  1

  1

 

44 

A. 
That    an    attorney    licensed  to    practice  law  in    Texas    has    died,    disappeared, 
resigned, become inactive, been disbarred or suspended, or become physically, mentally 
or  emotionally  disabled and  cannot provide  legal services  necessary  to  protect  the 
interests of clients. 

. 

That cause exists to believe that court supervision is necessary because the attorney 
has left client matters for which no other attorney licensed to practice law in Texas has, 
with the consent of the client, agreed to assume responsibility. 

. 

That there is cause to believe that the interests of one or more clients of the attorney  
or  one  or  more  interested persons or  entities will be  prejudiced  if  these proceedings 
are not maintained. 

3.03.  Hearing  and  Order  on  Application  to  Assume  Jurisdiction:  The  court  shall  set  the 
petition  for  hearing  and  may  issue  an  order  to  show  cause,  directing  the  attorney  or  his  or  her 
personal representative, or if none exists, the person having custody of the attorney's files, to show 
cause why the court should not assume jurisdiction of the attorney's law practice. If the court finds 
that one or more of the events stated in Rule 13.02 has occurred and that the supervision of the 
court is required, the court shall assume jurisdiction and appoint one or more attorneys licensed to 
practice law in Texas to take such action as set out in the written order of the court including, but 
not limited to, one or more of the following: 
 

Examine the client matters, including files and records of the attorney's practice, 

A. 
and obtain information about any matters that may require attention. 

Notify  persons  and  entities  that  appear  to  be  clients  of  the  attorney  of  the 

assumption of the law practice, and suggest that they obtain other legal counsel. 

Apply for extension of time before any court or any administrative body pending 

the client's employment of other legal counsel. 

.  With the prior consent of the client, file such motions and pleadings on behalf of 

the client as are required to prevent prejudice to the client's rights. 

Give appropriate notice to persons or entities that may be affected other than the

Arrange for surrender or delivery to the client of the client's  papers, files, or other 

he custodian shall observe the attorney-client relationship and privilege as if the custodians were 
the attorney of the client and may make only such disclosures as are necessary to carry out the 
purposes  of  this  part.  Except  for  intentional  misconduct  or  gross  negligence,  no  person  acting 
under this part may incur any liability by reason of the institution or maintenance of a proceeding 

following:

  T

 

45 

under this Part XIII. No bond or other security is required. 

omment:  Chapter  456,  Estates  Code,  authorizes  the  personal  representative  of  a  deceased 
attorney to designate an attorney—including him- or herself, if the personal representative is an 
attorney—to disburse and close the deceased attorney’s trust or escrow accounts for client funds. 
See Tex. Est. Code § 456.002. Before appointing an attorney to wind up a deceased attorney’s 
practice  under  this  rule,  the  court  should  determine  whether  the  deceased  attorney’s  personal 
representative has designated an attorney under Chapter 456 to close the deceased attorney’s trust 
and escrow accounts. 

3.04. Voluntary Appointment of Custodian Attorney for Cessation of Practice: In lieu of the 
procedures set forth in Rules 13.02 and  13.03, an attorney ceasing practice or planning  for the 
cessation of practice (“appointing attorney” for purposes of this Rule) may voluntarily designate a 
Texas attorney licensed and in good standing to act as custodian (“custodian attorney” for purposes 
of this Rule) to assist in the final resolution and closure of the attorney’s practice. The terms of the 
appointing documents, which shall be signed and acknowledged by the appointing attorney and 
custodian attorney, may include any of the following duties assumed:  
 

Examine the client matters, including files and records of the appointing attorney’s 

A. 
practice, and obtain information about any matters that may require attention.  

Notify persons and entities that appear to be clients of the appointing attorney of 

the cessation of the law practice, and suggest that they obtain other legal counsel.  

Apply for extension of time before any court or any administrative body pending 

the client’s employment of other legal counsel.  

.  With the prior consent of the client, file such motions and pleadings on behalf of 

the client as are required to prevent prejudice to the client’s rights.  

Give appropriate notice to persons or entities that may be affected other than the 

Arrange for surrender or delivery to the client of the client’s papers, files, or other

custodian were the attorney of the client and may make only such disclosures as are necessary to 
carry  out  the  purposes  of  this  Rule.  Except  for  intentional  misconduct  or  gross  negligence,  no 
person acting as custodian attorney under this Rule shall incur any liability by reason of the actions 
taken pursuant to this Rule.  

he  privileges  and  limitations  of  liability  contained  herein  shall  not  apply  to  any  legal 

representation taken over by the custodian attorney.

as custodian terminates, and the lawyer’s actions are subject to the Texas Disciplinary Rules of 
Professional Conduct regarding the client-lawyer relationship. 
 

PART XIV. INTERIM SUSPENSION 

4.01. Irreparable Harm to Clients: Should the Chief Disciplinary Counsel reasonably believe 
based upon investigation of a Complaint that an attorney poses a substantial threat of irreparable 
harm to clients or prospective clients and be authorized or directed to do so by the Commission, 
the Chief Disciplinary Counsel shall seek the immediate interim suspension of the attorney. The 
Commission shall file a petition with a district court of proper venue alleging substantial threat of 
irreparable harm, and the district court shall, if the petition alleges facts that  meet  the  evidentiary  
standard  in  Rule 14.02, set a  hearing  within ten  days.  If the Commission, at the hearing, meets 
the evidentiary standard and burden of proof as established in Rule 14.02, the court shall enter an 
order without requiring bond, immediately suspending the attorney pending the final disposition

PART XV.  GUIDELINES FOR IMPOSING SANCTIONS  
 

15.01.  Purpose and Nature of Sanctions 

Purpose of Lawyer Discipline Proceedings.  
The purpose of lawyer discipline proceedings is to protect the public and the administration 
of  justice  from  lawyers  who  have  not  discharged,  will  not  discharge,  or  are  unlikely  to 
properly discharge their professional duties to clients, the public, the legal system, and the

legal profession.  
 
Purpose of These Guidelines.  
These  Guidelines  are  designed  for  use  in  Disciplinary  Actions  and  Disciplinary 
Proceedings  under  Parts  II  and  III  of  the  Texas  Rules  of  Disciplinary  Procedure.    The 
Guidelines  set  forth  a  comprehensive  system  for  determining  sanctions,  permitting 
flexibility and creativity in assigning Sanctions in particular cases of lawyer misconduct. 
They  are  designed  to  promote:  (1)  consideration  of  all  factors  relevant  to  imposing  the 
appropriate  level of Sanction in an individual case;  (2)  consideration of the  appropriate 
weight of such factors in light of the stated goals of lawyer discipline; and (3) consistency 
in the imposition of disciplinary Sanctions for the same or similar rule violations among 
the various district grievance committees and district courts that consider these matters.  
The Guidelines do not limit the authority of a district grievance committee or of a district 
judge to make a finding or issue a decision.   

5.02.  General Factors to be Considered in Imposing Sanctions  

In imposing a sanction after a finding of Professional Misconduct, the disciplinary tribunal 
should consider the following factors:  
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
 

the duty violated;  
the Respondent’s level of culpability;  
the potential or actual injury caused by the  Respondent’s misconduct; and  
the existence of aggravating or mitigating factors.  

15.03.  Imposition of Sanctions 

In any Disciplinary Proceeding or Disciplinary Action where Professional Misconduct is 
found  have  occurred,  the  district  grievance  committee  or  district  court  may,  in  its 
discretion, conduct a separate hearing and receive evidence as to the appropriate Sanctions 
to be imposed.

The  Commission  may  refer  an  eligible  Respondent  to  the  program  in  any 
disciplinary matter that has reached the Just Cause stage of the process.  An eligible 
Respondent  may  also  be  referred  to  the  program  after  an  investigatory  hearing 
pursuant to Rule 2.12. 

The  Respondent  must  agree  to  meet  with  the  program  administrator  for  an 
assessment of the professionalism issues that contributed to the misconduct. 

The Respondent must agree in writing to waive any applicable time limits and to 
complete  specific terms and conditions, including  restitution if  appropriate, by a 
date certain and to pay for any costs associated with the terms and conditions. 

If the Respondent agrees to participate and completes the terms in a timely manner, 
the underlying grievance will be dismissed. 

If the Respondent does not fully complete the terms of the agreement in a timely 
manner, the underlying grievance will continue in the ordinary disciplinary process. 

Generally, a Respondent is eligible to participate in the program one time.

PART XVII. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 

 

7.01. Enforcement of Judgments: The following judgments have the force of a final judgment 
of a district court: judgments entered by an Investigatory Panel, final judgments of an Evidentiary 
Panel and judgments entered by the Board of Disciplinary Appeals. To enforce a judgment, the 
Commission  may apply to a district  court in  the county of  the residence  of  the  Respondent. In 
enforcing the judgment, the court has available to it all writs and processes, as well as the power 
of contempt, to enforce the judgment as if the judgment had been the court's own. 

7.02.  Effect  of  Related  Litigation:  The  processing  of  a  Grievance,  Complaint,  Disciplinary 
Proceeding, or Disciplinary Action is not, except for good cause, to be delayed or abated because 
of substantial similarity to the material allegations in pending civil or criminal litigation. 

7.03. Effect on Related Litigation: Neither the Complainant nor the Respondent is affected by 
the doctrines of res judicata or estoppel by judgment from any Disciplinary Action. 

7.04. Effect of Delay or Settlement by Complainant: None of the following alone justifies the 
discontinuance or abatement of a Grievance or Complaint being processed through the disciplinary 
system: (1) the unwillingness or the neglect of a Complainant to cooperate; (2) the settlement or 

60

compromise of matters between the Complainant and the Respondent; (3) the payment of monies 
by the Respondent to the Complainant. 

7.05. Effect  of  Time  Limitations: The  time periods provided in Rules 2.10, 2.12, 2.15, 2.17C, 
2.17E, 2.17P, 2.25, 3.02, 3.04, 7.11, 9.02, 9.03, 10.02, 11.01, 11.08, and 12.06(d) are mandatory. 
All other time periods herein provided are directory only and the failure to comply with them does 
not result in the invalidation of an act or event by reason of the noncompliance with those time 
limits. 

7.06. Limitations, Rules and Exceptions:  

General  Rule:  No  attorney  may  be  disciplined  for  Professional  Misconduct  that 
occurred more than four years before the date on which a Grievance alleging the 
Professional Misconduct is received by the Chief Disciplinary Counsel.  

Exception:  Compulsory  Discipline:  The  general  rule  does  not  apply  to  a 
Disciplinary Action seeking compulsory discipline under Part VIII.  

Exception:  Alleged  Violation  of  the  Disclosure  Rule:  A  prosecutor  may  be 
disciplined for a violation of Rule 3.09(d), Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional 
Conduct, that occurred in a prosecution that resulted in the wrongful imprisonment 
of  a  person  if  the  Grievance  alleging  the  violation  is  received  by  the  Chief 
Disciplinary  Counsel  within  four  years  after  the  date  on  which  the  Wrongfully 
Imprisoned Person was released from a Penal Institution.  

Effect of Fraud or Concealment: Where fraud or concealment is involved, the time 
periods stated in this rule do not begin to run until the Complainant discovered, or 
in  the  exercise  of  reasonable  diligence  should  have  discovered,  the  Professional 
Misconduct.
