(1)  Hearing and Suspension Required. If a judgment debtor files a Seizure 

Exemption Claim Form or another document asserting an exemption: 

the court must hold a hearing on the exemption claim; and 

the  receiver  or  officer  must  not  sell  the  judgment  debtor’s

hearing.  
 
Burden of Proof.  At the hearing, the judgment debtor must prove the 
exemption  claim  and the  value  of  the  personal  property  exempt.    The 
judgment debtor may satisfy this burden through a sworn statement if 
the sworn statement is not challenged. A “sworn” statement is one that 
is signed before a notary or made under penalty of perjury. 

Time for Determining Exemption Claim. The court must determine the 
judgment debtor’s exemption claim within 10 days after the judgment 
debtor  files  the  exemption  claim.  The  court  may  extend  the  time  for 
determining the exemption claim on good cause shown. 

Release of Property. If the court determines that the judgment debtor’s 
personal  property  is  exempt,  the  court  must  order  its  release  within 
three business days. The court may extend the time for release on good

022  Comment:    Rule  679b  is  a  new  rule  implementing  section  22.0042  of  Texas 
Government Code, which calls for expedited procedures that allow a judgment debtor 
to assert an exemption to the seizure of personal property by a judgment creditor or 
receiver  appointed  under  section  31.002  of  the  Civil  Practice  and  Remedies  Code. 
Rule 306a, various rules in Part V, Rule 663a, and Rule 664a are also amended to 
implement section 22.0042 of the Texas Government Code.

THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS IS ACCEPTING PUBLIC COMMENT. THESE FORMS ARE NOT FINAL. 
 

The court has considered Judgment Creditor’s Application for Appointment of a Receiver under 
Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 31.002. After reviewing the evidence and the court’s 
file, the court FINDS that the judgment rendered in Cause No. _______________ is valid, final, 
and  fully  payable.  The  judgment  awarded  was  $__________________,  including  costs,  with 
interest at the rate of ______% to be compounded annually. On ______________________ (date), 
the  total  balance  due  on  the  judgment—less  any  credits,  payments,  and  offsets—was 
$_______________. 

The court FINDS that the judgment remains unsatisfied; that Judgment Debtor owns property that 
is not exempt from attachment, execution, or seizure for the satisfaction of the judgment; and that 
Judgment Creditor is entitled to the court’s aid in reaching Judgment Debtor’s nonexempt property 
to satisfy the judgment.  

It is therefore ORDERED that the following person (“Receiver”) is appointed under Texas Civil 
Practice  and  Remedies  Code  §  31.002  with  authority  to  take  possession  of  Judgment  Debtor’s 
nonexempt property that is in Judgment Debtor’s possession or is subject to Judgment Debtor’s 
control,  sell  the  property,  and  pay  the  proceeds  to  Judgment  Creditor  to  the  extent  required  to 
satisfy  the  judgment.  Judgment  Debtor’s  nonexempt  property  may  include  financial  accounts, 
certificates of deposit, and money-market accounts held by a third party.

certify copies of this  Order; and  (4) negotiate and obtain installment payment agreements with 
Judgment Debtor, if Receiver reasonably believes that a payment agreement is the best option to 
satisfy the judgment. Receiver cannot reduce the total balance owed under the judgment without 
Judgment Creditor’s authorization. 

Personal Property Exemptions of Judgment Debtor:  Receiver must comply with Texas Rule 
of Civil Procedure 679b. 

Turnover: Judgment Debtor and any third party in possession of Judgment Debtor’s property is 
ORDERED to turn over Judgment Debtor’s nonexempt property to the Receiver. 

Time Period: This Receivership terminates on ________________________ (date, not to exceed 
180 days after the date this Order is signed), unless extended by the court on request of Judgment 
Creditor or Receiver and on good cause shown. 

Receiver’s Fee, Oath, and Bond: Receiver’s fee is conditionally set at ______% of the funds 
collected during the receivership. At the completion of Receiver’s duties, Receiver must prove that 
such amount is reasonable based on the work performed and the results obtained, and the court 
may reconsider and adjust the Receiver’s fee for reasonableness. The court-approved fee will be 
taxed as costs against Judgment Debtor, and Receiver may collect that fee from Judgment Debtor 
in addition to the amount collected to satisfy the judgment. 

Receiver must complete an oath to perform their duties faithfully before acting under this Order. 

  Receiver  must  execute  a  good  and  sufficient  bond  in  the  amount  of  $____________  before 
acting under this Order. 

Receiver’s  Expenses:  Receiver  must  provide  an  accounting  or  receipts  of  any  reasonable  and 
necessary  expenses,  including  those  for  storage  of  any  property  seized,  to  the  court.  Court-
approved expenses will be taxed as costs against Judgment Debtor, and Receiver may collect those 
expenses from Judgment Debtor in addition to the amount collected to satisfy the judgment. 

Receiver  to  Hold  Property:  Receiver  must  not  disburse  funds  to  Judgment  Creditor  or  sell 
property within 14 days after serving Judgment Debtor with the Seizure Exemption Notice, the 
Instructions for Seizure Exemption Claim Form, and the Seizure Exemption Claim Form adopted 
by the Supreme Court, or within 17 days if service was by mail.  If the Judgment Debtor asserts 
an  exemption,  Receiver  may  only  disburse  funds  to  Judgment  Creditor  or  sell  property  with

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
