Sections 8-32 
TIME AND LEAVE POLICY 
 

General  Time  and  Leave  Policy  Information.    The  Eighth  Court  of  Appeals’  Time  and 
Leave Policy is set forth in Sections 8 through 32 of the Personnel Policy Manual, and it sets forth 
the leave benefits and reporting requirements for employees of the Eighth Court of Appeals.  The 
Time and Leave Policy is intended to comply with Chapter 661 of the Texas Government Code 
and other applicable laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Family and Medical Leave 
Act,  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  and  those  federal  and  state  laws  pertaining  to 
employment discrimination.  The Time and Leave Policy is subject to change at the discretion of 
the Eighth Court of Appeals.  As a state agency, the Eighth Court of Appeals is required to keep a 
record of its employees’ accrual and use of various types of leave, including annual and sick leave.1  
This policy does not apply to elected officials or unpaid interns.2  The Time and Leave Policy is 
posted to the Court’s website as required by Section 661.252(c) of the Texas Government Code.   
 

Section 8 
ANNUAL VACATION LEAVE 

8.01.  Employee Vacations.  Employees are entitled to a vacation each fiscal year without 
a deduction in salary provided the employee has adequate leave available.3  An employee must 
obtain the approval of his or her Supervising Judge and/or immediate supervisor before taking a 
vacation.  Further, vacation schedules should be coordinated so that the essential functions of the 
Court are not disturbed. 

.02.    Limitations  on  Vacation  Leave.    Vacation  with  pay  may  not  be  granted  until  the 
employee has had continuous employment with the State for six [6] months, although credit will 
be accrued during that period.4  If an employee resigns, is dismissed,  or is otherwise separated 
from State employment prior to completing six [6] months of continuous employment with the 
State, then the accrued vacation leave terminates on the last day of duty and the employee will not 
be paid for the accrued vacation leave. 

.03.  Rate of Vacation Leave Accrual.  A full-time employee accrues vacation leave at the 
rate set forth in Section 661.152(d) of the Texas Government Code.  Part-time employees accrue 
vacation leave on a proportionate basis.  The maximum carryover is also proportionate. 

.04.  Method of Vacation Leave Accrual and Carryover.  An employee begins earning 
vacation leave at the applicable rate on the first calendar day of employment with the State and 
terminating on the last day of duty.  Credit for one month’s accrual will be given for each month 
of State employment and on the first of each succeeding month of employment.  Vacation leave 
accumulates  with  the  unused  portion  carried  forward  each  month,  subject  to  the  carryover 
limitations set forth in Section 661.152(d).  An employee who is on paid leave on the first workday

of a month may not take vacation leave accrued for that month until the employee has returned to 
duty.5 

.05.  Unused Vacation Leave.  All hours of unused accumulated vacation leave which are 
lapsed at the end of a fiscal year by operation of the Texas Government Code shall be credited to 
the employee’s sick leave balance as of the first day of the next fiscal year.6 

.06.  Accumulated Vacation Leave Payable to Estate.  If an employee dies while employed 
by the State, all of the employee’s accumulated vacation leave will be paid to the estate of the 
employee.7 

.07.  Annual Leave and Employee Separation.  A State employee who transfers directly 
from one State agency to another is entitled to credit by the agency to which the employee transfers 
for  the  unused  balance  of  the  employee’s  accumulated  vacation  provided  that  the  employee’s 
employment with the State is uninterrupted and the employee is not paid for the leave.8  If a State 
employee  separates  from  employment  and  is  re-employed  within  30  calendar  days  by  a  State 
agency to a position that accrues annual leave, the employee’s annual leave balance will transfer to 
the  new agency.9  State agency employees are entitled to be paid for the accrued balance of their 
annual leave as of the date of separation, if they are not re-employed by the State in a position that 
accrues annual leave  during the 30-day period immediately following the date of separation from 
State  employment.10    The  Court  may  agree  to  permit  an  employee  entitled  to  payment  under 
Chapter 661, Subchapter C, to remain on the payroll to exhaust the employee’s accrued vacation 
time.11

Section 9 
SICK LEAVE 

9.01.  Accrual of Sick Leave and Method of Carryover.12  An employee begins earning sick 
leave at the applicable rate on the first day of employment with the State and terminating on the 
last day of duty.  Full-time employees accrue sick leave at the rate of eight [8] hours per month.  
Part-time employees accrue sick leave at a proportionate rate.  Credit for one month’s accrual will 
be given for each month or fraction of a month of employment with the State.  The earned sick 
leave will be posted to each employee’s leave record on the first day of employment and on the 
first day of each succeeding month of employment thereafter.  Sick leave accumulates with the 
unused amount carried forward each month, and there is no limitation on the amount which can be 
accrued.  An employee in a paid leave status at the end of the month does not earn sick leave until 
he or she returns to work. 
 

9.02.    Use  of  Sick  Leave.    An  employee  is  eligible  to  use  sick  leave  immediately  upon

employment with the agency.  Sick leave may be taken when sickness, injury, or pregnancy and 
confinement prevent the employee’s performance of duty, or when the employee is needed to care 
for and assist a member of his or her immediate family who is ill.13  
 

9.03.  Immediate family defined.  For purposes of this subsection, “immediate family” is 
defined as those individuals who reside in the same household and are related by kinship, adoption 
or  marriage,  as  well  as  foster  children  certified  by  the  Texas  Department  of  Protective  and 
Regulatory  Services.14    Minor  children  of  the  employee,  whether  or  not  living  in  the  same 
household, will be considered immediate family for purposes of this subsection.  An employee’s 
use of sick leave for family members not residing in that employee’s household is strictly limited 
to the time necessary to provide care and assistance to a spouse, child or parent of the employee 
who needs such care and assistance as a direct result of a documented medical condition.15   
 

9.04.  Timely Notification.  An employee who must be absent from work because of illness 
must notify his or her department head or Supervising Judge, or must have the supervisor notified 
of that fact, at the earliest possible time.16  If the absence is going to be for more than one day, the 
employee must notify the supervisor of his or her status each morning, unless other arrangements 
have been made.  The employee must leave a phone number where he or she can be reached during 
the period of illness. 
 

9.05.  Illness for More than Three Days.  When an employee is absent from work due to 
illness for more than three [3] consecutive work days, he or she must provide a doctor’s statement 
showing the cause or nature of the illness, or some other written statement of the facts concerning 
the illness that is acceptable to the employee’s Supervising Judge.17  This written statement must 
be submitted with the employee’s timesheet at the end of the month. 

.06.    Unused  Sick  Leave.    An  employee  is  not  entitled  to  payment  for  any  sick  leave 
balance upon terminating employment with the State.  Retirees gain additional months on their 
annuity for every twenty [20] days, or 160 hours, or fraction thereof, of accrued sick leave.   
  

9.07.    Transfer  of  Sick  Leave.    If  an  employee  makes  a  direct  transfer  to  another  State 
agency without a break in service, the sick leave balance will transfer to the receiving agency.18   
 

9.08.    Sick  Leave  and  Employee  Separation.    An  employee  who  separates  from  State 
employment under a formal reduction in force is entitled to have  h i s   o r   h e r  sick leave balance 
restored if re-employed by the State within twelve [12] months.19 An employee who separates from 
State service for a reason other than a formal reduction in force is entitled to have the sick leave 
balance 
restored if re-employed after a 30-day break and within twelve [12] months of State service.  If

there is a break in service of less than thirty [30] days, all accrued sick leave is lost.20  A retiring 
employee may designate the number of accrued sick leave hours to be donated on retirement to 
the sick leave pool.21 
 

9.09.  Accumulated Sick Leave Payable to Employee’s Estate.   If an employee dies while 
employed by the State, one-half of the sick leave balance or 336 hours of sick leave, whichever is 
less, will be paid to the employee’s estate.22 

.10.  Educational Activities.  An employee may use up to eight [8] hours of sick leave each 
fiscal year to attend educational activities of  the employee’s children who are in pre-kindergarten 
through 12th grade.23  Educational activities include  school-sponsored activities such as parent-
trips;  classroom  programs;  school 
teacher  conferences;  tutoring;  volunteer  programs;  field 
committee  meetings;  academic  competitions;  and  athletic,  music,  or  theater  programs.    The 
employee must give reasonable notice of his or her intention to use this leave.  Part-time employees 
receive this leave on a proportionate basis. 

Section 10 
EXTENDED SICK LEAVE 

0.01.  Extended Sick Leave.  Extended sick leave is discretionary paid leave available for 
the same purposes as sick leave when an employee has exhausted all sick leave, vacation leave, 
and accrued comp time.24  The granting of extended sick leave is strictly discretionary with the 
Court after review of an employee’s circumstances and the needs of the Court.  Employees have 
no right to extended sick leave. 
 

10.02.  Eligibility.  To be eligible for extended sick leave, an employee must: 

• have exhausted all sick leave, vacation leave, and accrued overtime or comp time; 

  have  been  performing  job  duties  at  a  satisfactory  level  prior  to  the  illness 
according to the employee’s immediate supervisor or Supervising Judge; 
have used past sick leave in a responsible manner; 

 have indicated an intention and the ability to return to work; and

• have provided the Court with a written statement from the employee or his or her 
physician regarding the nature of the illness, prognosis, and estimated date of return 
to duty. 

10.03.  Amount of Extended Sick Leave Awarded.  If extended sick leave is approved, the 
Court  will  exercise  its  discretion  to  award  a  reasonable  amount  of  paid  leave  based  upon  the 
employee’s circumstances and the best interest of the Court. 

Section 11 
SICK LEAVE POOL 

11.01.  Purpose.  Pursuant to the Texas Government Code, the Court has established a Sick 
Leave Pool to benefit Court  employees  who have exhausted all sick leave due to a catastrophic 
injury or illness, or who have made a previous donation of time to the pool.25  The sick leave pool 
is a form of paid sick leave. 

1.02.  Pool Administrator.  The Court en banc is the Pool Administrator.26  The Clerk of 
the  Court  or  other  designee  will  assist  the  Court  by  accepting  applications  for  sick  leave  pool 
withdrawal, determining the maximum amount of time available to an employee, submitting the 
applications to the Court for decision, and if a request is approved, transferring leave from the pool 
to the employee.  The Clerk of the Court or other designee may be required to perform other duties 
as directed by the Court. 

1.03.    Catastrophic  Injury  or  Illness  and  Related  Terms  Defined.    The  Employees 

Retirement System has defined the following terms: 

 Catastrophic injury or illness is a severe condition or combination of conditions affecting 
the mental or physical health of the employee or a member of the employee’s immediate family 
that requires the services of a licensed practitioner for a prolonged period of time, and that forces 
the employee to exhaust all time earned by that employee and to lose compensation from the State.   

 Licensed practitioner means a practitioner, as defined in the Texas Insurance Code, who 

is practicing within the scope of his or her license.   

 Immediate family is defined as those individuals related by kinship, adoption or marriage, 
and foster children who are so certified by the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory 
Services,  who  are  living  in  the  same  household,  or  if  not  in  the  same  household  are  totally 
dependent upon the employee for personal care or services on a continuing basis.27   

1.04.  Employee Contributions to Sick Leave Pool.  All donations of sick leave hours to the 
Sick Leave Pool are strictly voluntary.  The following policies govern contributions to the sick leave 
pool:

• An active employee may contribute one or more days of the employee’s accrued sick leave 

time to the pool in eight-hour increments.   

 Employees are encouraged to contribute one or more days to the pool at the time of their 
separation from State employment, less any hours previously contributed during that same fiscal 
year. 

 Terminating employees who contribute to the sick leave pool may have their sick leave 
restored if they are re-employed by another State agency within twelve [12] months of termination. 

 Employees  who make contributions to the pool cannot stipulate who is to receive their 

contribution. 

1.05.  General Conditions.  The following policies and conditions govern eligibility and 

usage of leave from the sick leave pool: 

 All employees of the Eighth Court of Appeals, other than elected officers, including those 
on probationary, provisional temporary, emergency, hourly, or other types of appointments, may 
apply to use sick leave from the sick leave pool. 

 Employees with catastrophic illnesses or injuries are not required to contribute to the pool 

before they can use pool leave. 

 Employees who use pool leave are not required to pay back pool leave. 

 Employees may apply to use the pool leave for their own catastrophic illness or injury, as 

defined above, or for a person in their immediate family. 

 If they are contributing members of the Sick Leave Pool, employees may also apply to use 
the pool sick leave for other than catastrophic illness or injury, when they have exhausted their sick 
leave balance in the same fiscal year.  Such employees may receive credit for only the number of 
hours they have contributed to the pool in the same fiscal year for absences other than those caused 
by catastrophic illness or injury as defined above. 

 Employees must exhaust all accrued leave, plus any extended sick leave granted them by 
this Court, before they are eligible to use leave from the pool.  However, employees who are off 
work due to an on-the-job injury or illness are not required to exhaust their annual or compensatory 
leave before becoming eligible to use leave from the pool. 

 The amount of Sick Leave Pool time granted per request will be limited to 90 days or 1/3 

of the pool balance, whichever is less.28 

 Employees on pool sick leave for an entire month will accrue annual and sick leave for that 

month.  The leave must be exhausted as it is accrued.

11.06.  Requesting Leave from the Sick Leave Pool.  Requests for leave from the Sick Leave 
Pool must be submitted in writing to the Clerk of the Court or other designee.  Requests will be 
evaluated in the order in which they are received.  The employee must attach to the request a written 
statement from the licensed practitioner who is treating the employee or the employee’s immediate 
family member.29  The statement must provide sufficient information regarding the illness or injury 
to enable the Court to evaluate the employee’s eligibility.  If the request is for an immediate family 
member,  the statement  should  indicate the  length  of  time the  employee  is  required to  assist  the 
family member.  If an employee is qualified to use leave from the sick leave pool, the Clerk of the 
Court or other designee will indicate on the sick leave pool application the maximum amount of 
time available to the employee and as soon as practicable submit the application to the Court for 
decision. 

 
11.07.  Criteria for Approval of Sick Leave Pool Request.  Before a sick leave pool request 

will be granted, the following factors will be taken into consideration: 

 
11.08.    Return  to  Work.    If  a  physician  releases  an  employee  back  to  work  or  does  not 
provide  a  statement  requesting  additional  time  (subject  to  the  approval  of  the  Court),  and  the 
employee does not return to work immediately, the employee will be on leave without pay. 

1.09.   Equal Treatment.  An employee who is absent on time withdrawn from the sick 
leave pool may use the time as sick leave earned by the employee, and the employee is treated for 
all purposes as if the employee were absent on earned sick leave.30 

 
11.10.    Unused  Leave  from  the  Pool.    Any  unused  balance  of  pool  leave  granted  to  an 
employee will be returned to the pool.  The estate of a deceased employee is not entitled to payment 
for unused pool leave.31 
 

Section 12 
DONATION OF SICK LEAVE 

12.01.    Voluntary  Transfer  of  Sick  Leave.    An  employee  may  voluntarily  transfer  any 
amount of his or her accrued sick leave to another employee of the Eighth Court of Appeals who has 
exhausted his or her sick leave, including any time  the recipient may be eligible to withdraw from 
a sick leave pool.32  

• severity of the illness or injury; 

• responsible use of sick leave in the past; 

• sustained satisfactory job performance; and 

 intention to return to work.

2.02.  Tax Implications.  The tax implications arising from a donation of sick leave under 
Section 661.207 are not addressed in this policy and employees are encouraged to consult with a 
tax advisor.   

2.03.  Unused Sick Leave.  Unlike accrued sick leave, donated sick leave is not eligible for 

transfer to another State agency or for payment to an estate upon death of the recipient. 
 

12.04.  No Remuneration Allowed.  An employee may not provide or receive remuneration 

or a gift in exchange for a sick leave donation.     

2.05.  Use of Donated Sick Leave.  An employee who receives donated sick leave may 
only use the leave as provided by Texas Government Code,  Sections 661.202(d) and (e).  Further, 
an employee will not receive service credit in the Employees Retirement System  of Texas for any 
sick  leave  received  under  Section  661.207  that  is  unused  on  the  last  day  of  that  employee’s 
employment. 
 

Section 13 
EMERGENCY LEAVE 

13.01.  Death in Employee’s Immediate Family.  A State employee is entitled to emergency 
leave without a deduction in salary because of a death in the employee’s family.33  For purposes of 
this  type  of  leave,  an  employee’s  family  is  defined  as  the  employee’s  spouse,  as  well  as  the 
employee’s  parents  and  spouse’s  parents,  children,  brothers,  sisters,  grandparents,  and 
grandchildren.34 

3.02.  Criteria for Granting Emergency Leave.  The Chief Justice may grant emergency 
leave for a reason other than a death in the employee’s family under Section 661.902(a).  The Court 
shall grant emergency leave under the following circumstances: 

  1

• 

• 

• 

the employee requests the leave; 
 
the Chief Justice determines the employee has shown good cause for taking emergency 
leave; and 
 
the Chief Justice believes in good faith that the employee being granted emergency 
leave  intends  to  return  to  the  employee’s  position  upon  expiration  of  the  leave 
granted.35   

13.03.  Closure Due to Weather.  An employee is not required to request emergency leave if 
the Court grants the emergency leave under Section 661.902(b) because the agency is closed due to 
weather conditions or in observance of a holiday.36

13.04.  Reporting Requirements.  By October 1 of each year, the Clerk of the Court is required 
to report to the Comptroller the name and position of each court employee granted more than 32 hours 
of emergency leave during the previous State fiscal year, the reason for the granting of such leave, and 
the total number of hours of emergency leave granted to the employee in the State fiscal year.37 

Section 14 
APPROVED LEAVE WITHOUT PAY 
(Reference: Texas Government Code, Section 661.909) 

14.01.  Unpaid Leave.  Approved leave without pay (LWOP) is the temporary absence from 
duty of an employee who intends to return to work.38  The Eighth Court of Appeals has discretion 
to  grant  employees  leave  without  pay  or  an  unpaid  leave  of  absence  subject  to  the  terms  and 
conditions set below. 

4.02.  Length of Leave.  Pay is suspended during the length of the absence which cannot 

exceed 12 months.39   

4.03.    Procedure  for  Requesting  Unpaid Leave.    An  employee  requesting  LWOP  must 
submit a written request to the Clerk of the Court.  The request must include a start date, end date, 
and  reason  for  the  request.    If  the  request  is  for  medical  reasons,  it  must  be  accompanied  by  a 
doctor’s statement and any other documentation explaining the reasons for the request.   

4.04.  Exhaustion of Accumulated Paid Leave.  Except for disciplinary suspensions, active 
military duty, and leave covered by workers’ compensation benefits, all accumulated paid leave 
entitlements must be used before going on leave without pay status.40  Sick leave must first be used 
only if the employee is taking leave for a reason for which the employee is eligible to take sick 
leave under Chapter 661, Subchapter G, Texas Government Code. 

4.05.  Accrual of Leave and Payment of Insurance Premiums.  If an absence covers an 
entire month, the employee does not accrue any vacation or sick leave.41  The employee is also 
responsible for payment of insurance premiums unless excepted under provisions of FMLA. 

4.06.  Guarantee of Employment.  Subject to fiscal constraints, approval of LWOP under 
this policy constitutes a guarantee of employment at the conclusion of the specified leave period.42  
The employee is not guaranteed a return to the same position or the same pay.  Failure to return to 
work from LWOP on the approved return date will be considered abandonment of position and 
the Eighth Court of Appeals may take appropriate action to terminate employment. 

4.07.  Exceptions.  The Court may grant exceptions to these provisions when it is deemed

governmental agency under an interagency agreement, or for educational purposes.43 
 

Section 15
FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE 

15.01.  Entitlement to Leave under the FMLA.  Pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave 
Act (FMLA), an eligible employee is entitled to a total of twelve [12] work weeks of leave during 
any twelve-month-period for one or more of the following: 
 

(A)  because of the birth of a child of the employee and to care for such child; 

B)  because of the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster 
care; 

C)  to care for the spouse, or a son, daughter, or parent, of the employee, if such 
spouse, son, daughter, or parent has a serious health condition; or 

D)    because  of  a  serious  health  condition  that  makes  the  employee  unable  to 
perform the functions of the employee’s position.44 

  (

  (

  (

15.02.  Expiration of Entitlement.  The entitlement to leave under subparagraphs (A) and 
(B) of section 14.01 for a birth or placement of a son or daughter shall expire at the end of the 
twelve-month period beginning on the date of such birth or placement. 
 

15.03.    Eligibility.    For  purposes  of  FMLA,  an  eligible  employee  is  one  who  has  been 
employed by the State for at least twelve [12] months, and who has worked at least 1,250 hours 
during  the  preceding  twelve  months.45    When  calculating  the  required  twelve  months  of  State 
employment  for  FMLA  eligibility,  all  State  employment  will  be  counted  and  it  need  not  be 
continuous.  The 1,250 hours refers to hours actually worked and does not include any paid time 
off. 
  

15.04.    Maximum  Amount  of  Time  Available.  The  maximum  combination  of  paid  and 
unpaid leave taken pursuant to the FMLA is limited to twelve [12] work weeks in a twelve-month 
period. 
 

15.05.  Substitution of Paid Leave.  Unless an employee has accrued vacation leave, sick 
leave, or comp time which will be substituted pursuant to this section for unpaid leave, all leave 
provided by the Court pursuant to FMLA is unpaid leave.  An employee is required to substitute 
the employee’s accrued paid vacation leave, personal leave, and comp time for the leave provided 
pursuant  to  paragraphs  (A)  or  (B)  of  section  14.01.    An  employee  is  required  to  substitute  the 
employee’s  accrued  paid  vacation  leave,  personal  leave,  and  sick  leave  for  the  leave  provided

pursuant to paragraphs (C) or (D) of section 14.01 unless the employee is receiving temporary 
disability or workers compensation benefits.  Any extension beyond the twelve-week time period 
must be requested and approved under the Court’s unpaid leave policy.  Failure of the employee 
to report back to work at the end of the prescribed period without prior written approval of the 
employee’s Supervising Judge will be considered leave without pay. 
 

15.06.  Serious Health Condition Defined.  A “serious health condition” is defined as an 
illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves either inpatient care in a 
hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility or continuing treatment by a licensed health 
care provider. 
 

15.07.  Birth or Placement of Child.  In the case of FMLA leave for the birth or placement 
of a child for adoption or foster care, an employee should, if possible, provide thirty  [30] days 
advance  notice  before  the  date  on  which  the  leave  would  begin.    If  the  employee  is  unable  to 
provide this advance notice, he or she must provide as much notice as is practicable. 
 

15.08.    Planned  Medical  Treatment.    When  the need  for  leave  is  foreseeable,  based  on 
planned  medical  treatment  for  the  employee  or  family  member,  the  employee  must  make  a 
reasonable  effort  to  schedule  the  treatment  so  as  not  to  unduly  interrupt  the  operations  of  the 
employer,  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  health  care  provider  providing  the  planned  care.    The 
employee should provide thirty [30] days’ notice of the employee’s intent to take leave for this 
purpose, or if not possible, as much notice as is practicable. 
 

15.09.  Intermittent Leaves and Reduced Schedules.  Leave for childbirth or placement for 
adoption or foster care may not be taken intermittently or on a reduced work schedule except with 
the agreement of the employee and the employee’s Supervising Judge.  Leave for the illness of the 
employee  or  a  family  member  may  be  taken  intermittently  or  on  a  reduced  schedule  when 
medically necessary.  The taking of leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule will not 
result in a reduction in the total amount of leave to which the employee is entitled under FMLA. 
 

15.10.    Temporary  Transfer.    If  an  employee  requests  intermittent  or  reduced  schedule 
leave pursuant to section 15.01(C) or (D), the Court may temporarily transfer the employee to an 
available alternative position for which the employee is qualified, and which has equivalent pay, 
if  the  alternative  position  better  accommodates  recurring  periods  of  leave  than  the  employee’s 
regular position. 
 

15.11.    Reinstatement.    An  eligible  employee  who  takes  FMLA  leave  is  entitled  to  be 
restored to his or her former position, or to an equivalent position with equivalent pay, and other 
terms and conditions of employment. 
 

15.12.  Benefit Rights.  The taking of leave under FMLA may not result in the loss of any 
employment benefit accrued prior to the date on which the leave commenced.  Nothing in FMLA, 
however,  entitles  an  employee  to  any  right,  benefit,  or  position  other  than  one  to  which  the 
employee would have been entitled had the leave not been taken. 
 

15.13.  Insurance.  The Court will maintain any group health coverage for the employee 

 

Page 11 of 20 

on leave on the same terms as if the employee were at work for the duration of the leave.  If an 
employee is on unpaid leave for an entire calendar month, it is the responsibility of the employee 
to pay his or her portion of the insurance premium, if any, and the State will pay its portion.  The 
employee should make arrangements for premium payment with the Clerk of the Court or other 
designee/Benefits Coordinator prior to taking leave, if practicable. 
 

15.14.  Recovery of Insurance Premiums.  If an employee elects not to return to work upon 
completion of an approved unpaid leave of absence, the Court may recover from the employee the 
cost of any premiums paid by the State to maintain the employee’s coverage, unless the failure to 
return to work was for reasons beyond the employee’s control or due to continuation, recurrence, 
or onset of a serious health condition. 
 

15.15.  Certification of Serious Health Condition.  An employee requesting leave under 
FMLA due to the serious health condition of the employee or a member of the employee’s family 
will be required to provide certification from the health care provider treating the condition.  The 
health care provider should provide detailed information regarding the condition of the employee 
or family member, and also give an estimate of the amount of time needed for the employee’s 
recovery or the amount of time needed to care for the family member.  If intermittent leave or a 
reduced  leave  schedule  is  requested,  the  health  care  provider  should  also  state  the  dates  and 
duration of planned medical treatment. 
 

15.16.  Additional Certifications.  If the Court has reason to question the validity of the 
certification,  the  employee  may  be  required  to  obtain  a  second  certification  from  a  health  care 
provider designated or approved by the Court.  If the second provider disagrees with the first, a 
third and final opinion might also be required from a jointly selected provider. 
 

15.17.    Return  to  Work.    In  the  situation  where  the  employee  has  been  absent  due  to  a 
serious health condition, the employee is required to provide certification that he or she is able to 
return to work. 
 

15.18.  Spouses Employed by the Court.  A husband and wife who are eligible for FMLA 
leave and who are both employed by the agency are permitted to take only a combined total of 
twelve [12] weeks of leave during a fiscal year if the leave is taken: 
 

1.  for birth of a son or daughter or to care for the child after birth; 

2.  for placement of a child for adoption or foster care, or to care for the child after placement; 

 

or 

3.  to care for a parent with a serious health condition. 

When a husband and wife each take a portion of the total twelve-week period to care for a 
parent  or  for  the  birth,  adoption,  or  placement  of  a  child,  each  would  be  entitled  to  take  the 
remaining portion of the twelve-week leave for his own serious illness or to care for a sick child. 
 

15.19.  Employee Requests.  Employees must follow specific procedures to request a family 

Page 12 of 20 

 

 

 

Page 13 of 20 

or medical leave.  These procedures are detailed as follows: 
 

1.  Contact the Clerk of the Court or other designee/Benefits Coordinator to obtain 
and complete the required paperwork. 

.  Notify Supervising Judge in writing of the request. 

.  If intermittent leave is requested, the employee must provide the  Supervising 
Judge with a proposed schedule and duration.   

5.20.  Action on the Request.  After the required paperwork has been completed, the Clerk 
of the Court or other designee/Benefits Coordinator will present the request to the Court at the next 
monthly meeting of the Chief Justice and Justices or at a specially called meeting of the Court if 
required under the circumstances. 
 

15.21.  Designation of Leave by the Court.  Even if an employee does not request FMLA 
leave, the Court may designate leave taken by the employee as FMLA-protected for purposes of 
calculating the twelve-week period under the FMLA.  If the Court intends to take this step, the 
employee  will  be  notified  in  writing  by  the  Court  and  given  three  days  to  provide  a  written 
response.  The Court will then determine whether to designate the leave as FMLA-protected and 
notify the employee in writing of the Court’s decision. 

he FMLA policy outlined above is a summation of the Family and Medical Leave Act and does 
not detail all of its provisions.   Questions about FMLA should be directed to  your  Supervising 
Judge and/or immediate supervisor. 
 

Section 16 
PARENTAL LEAVE 

16.01.    Eligibility  for  Parental  Leave.    Employees who  do not qualify  for  FMLA leave 
because they have fewer than twelve [12] months of total State service or because they have worked 
fewer than 1,250 hours in the 12-month period immediately preceding the commencement of leave 
are eligible to take a parental leave of absence, not  to exceed twelve [12] weeks, for the birth of a 
natural child or the adoption by or foster care placement of a child under three [3] years of age.46 

6.02.  Limitations on Parental Leave.  Parental leave is limited to, and begins on the date 
of, the birth of the employee’s natural child or the  adoption by or foster care placement with the 
employee of a child younger than three years of age.47  An employee must first use all available and 
applicable paid vacation and sick leave while taking parental leave prior to going on leave without 
pay.48  The use of sick leave is strictly limited to those situations clearly falling within the definition 
of sick leave contained in the Texas Government Code.

State compensatory time for work conducted at any location other than the employee’s regular 
place of employment or assigned duty point. 

2.02.    The  Fair  Labor  Standards  Act.    An  employee  whose  position  is  subject  to  the 
overtime  provisions  of  FLSA  is  entitled  to  compensation  as  provided  by  that  Act  and  this 
subdivision of the Policy Manual.  An employee who is covered by FLSA is referred to as non-
exempt.  The non-exempt positions are:  Deputy Clerk, Legal Assistant, and Accountant.  Those 
employees in certain executive, professional, and administrative positions are exempt from FLSA.  
The  exempt  positions  are:    the  Clerk  of  the  Court,  Systems  Analyst,  Law  Clerk,  and  all  court 
attorney positions. 

2.03.  Overtime under FLSA Earned by Nonexempt Employees.  Pursuant to FLSA, a non-
exempt employee of the Court is entitled to one and one-half [1.5] hours leave for every hour the 
employee works in excess of forty [40] hours in a workweek (Monday through Sunday).65  The 
Court’s policy manual refers to this type of accrued leave as “FLSA overtime” and it should not 
be confused with “State compensatory time” or “State comp time” discussed below.  In computing 
the hours actually worked for purposes of FLSA overtime, any form of paid leave or holidays will 
not be included in the calculations. 
 

Example:    a  non-exempt  employee  works  an  actual  44  hours  in  a  regular  work 
week.  She has accrued 6 hours of FLSA overtime (4 hours x 1.5 = 6 hours).

Example:  a non-exempt employee works an actual 42 hours in a work week that 
includes Veteran’s Day.  He has accrued 3 hours of FLSA overtime (2 hours x 1.5 
= 3 hours). 

Example:  a non-exempt employee works an actual 40 hours in a work week that 
includes Veteran’s Day.  He has not accrued any FLSA overtime. 

32.04.  State Compensatory Time Earned by Non-Exempt Employee.  66 Pursuant to State 

law, a non-exempt employee earns State compensatory time in two situations: 
 

(1)  a non-exempt employee, who has not worked more than forty [40] actual hours in a 
work week (Monday through Sunday) but whose recorded time (total hours worked plus hours of 
paid leave and holidays) exceeds forty [40] hours, is entitled to receive equivalent compensatory 
time off for the excess hours.   
 

Example:  a non-exempt employee works 36 hours in a work week that includes 
Veteran’s Day.  She has accrued 4 hours straight comp time (44 hours recorded less 
40 hours = 4).

66  TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 659.015.

Example:  a non-exempt employee works 40 hours in a work week that includes 
Veteran’s Day.  He has accrued 8 hours straight comp time (48 hours recorded less 
40 hours = 8). 

 

(2)  a non-exempt employee, who has worked more than forty [40] actual hours in a work 
week and the total of hours worked and hours of paid leave or paid holidays exceeds 40 hours after 
subtracting FLSA overtime hours worked, shall be allowed equivalent compensatory time off for 
the excess hours. 

xample:  a non-exempt employee works an actual 42 hours in a work week that 
includes  Veteran’s  Day.    In  addition  to  the  three  [3]  hours  of  FLSA  overtime  (2 
hours x 1.5 = 3 hours) he has accrued, he has also earned 8 hours of straight comp 
time (the employee’s recorded hours were 50 less the two hours of FLSA overtime 
= 48 less 40 = 8).  Thus, the employee has earned a total of 11 hours of comp time. 

2.05.  Loss of State Compensatory Time.  State compensatory time must be taken during 
the twelve-month period following the end of the work week in which the overtime was accrued.  
Compensatory time under this provision may not be carried forward past the end of the twelve [12] 
month period and an employee may not be paid for the unused time.

32.06.    State  Compensatory  Time  for  Working  on  Holidays.67    All  employees,  whether 
exempt or non-exempt, who work on a national holiday or state holiday will be allowed equivalent 
compensatory  time  off  during  the  twelve  [12]  month  period  following  the  date  of  the  holiday 
worked.  An employee must obtain approval from his Supervising Judge prior to accruing State 
compensatory time under this provision.
