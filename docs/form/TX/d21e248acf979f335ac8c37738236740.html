IN RE: 
PETITION FOR ORDER 
TO AMEND THE STATE BAR RULES  
__________________________________________________________ 

PETITION FOR ORDER 
TO AMEND THE STATE BAR RULES REGARDING THE TEXAS YOUNG 
LAWYERS ASSOCIATION 

O THE HONORABLE CHIEF JUSTICE AND JUSTICES OF SAID COURT: 

COMES NOW the State Bar of Texas (the “Petitioner”) and respectfully petitions 

this Court for an Order amending Article I of the State Bar Rules (“Rules”).  In support 

thereof, Petitioner would show: 

The  Texas  Young  Lawyers  Association  (“TYLA”)  has  long  been  recognized  by 

the  legislature  as  an  important  part  of  the  State  Bar  of  Texas.1    Since  1939,  TYLA 

(previously named “the State Junior Bar of Texas”) has been recognized as a division of 

the State Bar of Texas2 and is commonly referred to as its “public service arm.”3   

1 See Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §§ 81.020, 81.121. 

 

2 See James J. Hartnett, A Review: State Junior Bar of Texas, 25 Tex. B.J. 361 (1962). 

3 See About Us, TYLA, https://tyla.org/about/.

II. 

III. 

On  September  17,  2021,  the  TYLA  Board  of  Directors  passed  a  resolution  in 

support  of  expanding  its  membership  to  all  members  of  the  State  Bar  of  Texas, 

irrespective  of  age,  licensed  twelve  years  or  less  at  the  beginning  of  each  fiscal  year 

beginning June 1.4   

Thereafter,  during  its  regularly  called  meeting  on  September  24,  2021,  at  which 

meeting a quorum was present, the State Bar’s Board of Directors voted to approve the 

recommended  changes  to  the  TYLA  membership  structure  as  reflected  in  the  TYLA 

resolution.5   

For these reasons, Petitioner would propose that the following definition be added 

to the State Bar Rules under Article I:  

15)    “Texas  Young  Lawyers  Association”  means  the  division  of  the  State 
Bar of Texas commonly referred to as its “public service arm” and whose 
regular membership6 is comprised of all members of the State Bar of Texas, 
irrespective  of  age,  licensed  twelve  years  or  less  at  the  beginning  of  each 
fiscal year beginning June 1.   

4 See Resolution 2021-2, attached hereto as Exhibit “A.” 

 

5 See Video of September 24, 2021 Board of Directors Meeting at 5:45:53-5:55:14, YouTube (Sept. 24, 2021), 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzVBsNXTZ8w. 

6 TYLA also has honorary memberships: “The Board of Directors may elect honorary members of the TYLA by a 
majority vote of the Board of Directors.  Honorary members shall neither vote nor hold office.” See Bylaws of the 
Texas Young Lawyers Association, art. II, § 2 (2013), http://bit.ly/2I49Wrw. This footnote is included for 
explanatory purposes and is not intended to be part of the proposed definition. 

2 

 

WHEREFORE,  Petitioner  respectfully  requests  the  Court  adopt  the  proposed 

addition  to  Article I  of the State Bar Rules  as  set out herein,  effective January  1, 2022, 

and  to  further  order  that  the  amendments  be  published  in  the  Texas  Bar  Journal. 

Petitioner further requests that the Court provide that any person who would have been a 

member of TYLA for the 2021-2022 fiscal year under the proposed addition to Article I 

if it had been in effect on June  l, 2021, shall be a  member of TYLA as of the proposed 

addition's effective date of January  1, 2022. 

Respectfully submitted,

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
