       Misc. Docket No. 18-9112 

 

 

CORRECTED ORDER GIVING FINAL APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS  
TO THE TEXAS RULES OF DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE 

On  March  1,  2018,  in  Miscellaneous  Docket  No.  18-9031,  the  Court  preliminarily 
approved amendments to the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure required by the Act 
of May 28, 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., ch. 531 (SB 302), and invited public comment. 
 
The  Court  has  reviewed  all  comments  received  and  gives  final  approval  to  the 
amendments in this order.  

Rule 2.12 has been reorganized and stylistic changes have been made throughout 
the rule. 
 
Rule  2.12(B)  has  been  revised  to  require  the  chair  of  the  District  Grievance 
Committee  to  authorize  an  investigatory  subpoena—rather  than  the  chair  of  an 
Investigatory  Panel—even  if  an  investigatory  hearing  has  already  been  set. 
Paragraph  (B)  has  also  been  revised  to  authorize  an  investigatory  subpoena  for 
information or testimony “that relates directly to a specific allegation of attorney 
misconduct”.  These  changes  track  the  requirements  of  Section  81.080(a), 
Government Code. 
 
Rule 2.12(D) has been revised to clarify that both the Respondent and the witness 
(if the witness is not the Respondent) may object to an investigatory subpoena and 
that objections must be made in good faith. 

Rule  2.12(E)  has  been  revised  to  state  that  if  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel 
pursues enforcement of a subpoena in district court: 

a.

Changes to the draft amendments in Miscellaneous Docket No. 18-9031 are as follows:  

Miscellaneous Docket No. 18-9085 is withdrawn, and this order is substituted. 

RDERED that:

 

 
 

the  Respondent  or  the  witness  may  raise  any  good  faith  objection  to  the 
subpoena; 
if the district court finds that a person’s objection or noncompliance is in bad 
faith,  the  court  may  award  costs  and  attorney  fees  to  the  Chief  Disciplinary 
Counsel; 
the district court’s order is not appealable; and 
the Chief Disciplinary Counsel  must not  consider a Respondent’s  good  faith 
objection to an investigatory subpoena as grounds for Just Cause. 

The  introductory  paragraph  to  Rule  2.17  has  been  revised  to  clarify  that  an 
Investigatory Panel member may not be assigned to an Evidentiary Panel for the 
same case. 
 
Stylistic  changes  have  been  made  to  Rule  2.17(H)  to  conform  to  analogous 
language in Rule 2.12. 

Former  Rule  3.10  (Imposition  of  Sanctions)  has  been  deleted  because  its 
substance is being replaced by Part XV. The rest of Part III has been renumbered.  

Typos have been corrected. 

The amendments apply to a grievance filed on or after June 1, 2018, regardless of when 
the conduct that is the subject of the grievance occurred. A grievance filed before June 1, 
2018 will be governed by the rules in effect at that time. 

The Clerk is directed to: 

file a copy of this order with the Secretary of State; 

cause a copy of this order to be mailed to each registered member of the  
State Bar of Texas by publication in the Texas Bar Journal; 

 

send a copy of this order to each elected member of the Legislature; and 

submit a copy of the order for publication in the Texas Register.

.06.   Assignment of Committee Members: Each member of a Committee shall act  through 
panels  assigned  by  the  chair  of  the  Committee  for  investigatory  hearings,  summary 
disposition dockets, and evidentiary hearings. Promptly after assignment, notice must be 
provided to  the Respondent  by  United States  certified mail,  return  receipt  requested, of 
the names and addresses of the panel members assigned to each Complaint. A member is 
disqualified  or  is  subject  to  recusal  as  a  panel  member  for  an  evidentiary  hearing  if  a 
district judge would, under similar circumstances, be disqualified or recused. If a member 
is disqualified or recused, another member shall be appointed by the Committee chair. No 
peremptory  challenges  of  a  Committee  member  are  allowed.  Any  alleged  grounds  for 
disqualification or recusal of a panel member are conclusively waived if not brought to 
the  attention  of  the  panel  within  ten  days  after  receipt  of  notification  of  the  names  and 
addresses of members of the panel; however, grounds for disqualification or recusal not 
reasonably discoverable within the ten day period may be asserted within ten days after 
they  were  discovered  or  in  the  exercise  of  reasonable  diligence  should  have  been 
discovered.  

.07.   Duties  of  Committees:  Committees  shall  act  through  panels,  as  assigned  by  the 
Committee  chairs,  to  conduct  investigatory  hearings,  summary  disposition  dockets,  and 
evidentiary hearings. No panel may consist of more than one-half of all members of the 
Committee or fewer than three members. If a member of a panel is disqualified, recused 
or  otherwise  unable  to  serve,  the  chair  shall  appoint  a  replacement.  Panels  must  be 
composed of two attorney members for each public member. A quorum must include at 
least  one  public  member  for  every  two  attorney  members  present  and  consists  of  a 
majority of the membership of the panel, and business shall be conducted upon majority 
vote  of  those  members  present,  a  quorum  being  had.  In  matters  in  which  evidence  is 
taken, no member may vote unless that member has heard or reviewed all the evidence. It 
shall  be  conclusively  presumed,  however,  not  subject  to  discovery  or  challenge  in  any 
subsequent  proceeding, that  every member casting  a vote has heard or  reviewed  all the 
evidence. No member, attorney or public, may be appointed by the chair to an for both 
the  Summary  Disposition  docket  and  the  Evidentiary  Panel  pertaining  to  the  same 
disciplinary  matter  that  the  member  considered  at  either  an  investigatory  hearing  or 
summary  disposition  docket.  Any  tie  vote  is  a  vote  in  favor  of  the  position  of  the 
Respondent.  

.10.   Classification  of  Grievances  Inquiries  and  Complaints:  The  Chief  Disciplinary 
Counsel shall within thirty days examine each Grievance received to determine whether it 
constitutes an Inquiry, or a Complaint, or a Discretionary Referral.  
A. 

If  the  Grievance  is  determined  to  constitute  an  Inquiry,  the  Chief  Disciplinary 
Counsel  shall  notify  the  Complainant  and  Respondent  of  the  dismissal.  The 
Complainant may, within thirty days from notification of the dismissal, appeal the 
determination to the Board of Disciplinary Appeals. If the Board of Disciplinary 
Appeals  affirms  the  classification  as  an  Inquiry,  the  Complainant  will  be  so

notified  and  may  within  twenty  days  amend  the  Grievance  one  time  only  by 
providing new or additional evidence. The Complainant may appeal a decision by 
the Chief Disciplinary Counsel to dismiss the amended Complaint as an Inquiry to 
the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals.  No  further  amendments  or  appeals  will  be 
accepted. In all instances where a Grievance is dismissed as an Inquiry other than 
where  the  attorney  is  deceased  or  is  not  licensed  to  practice  law  in  the  State  of 
Texas,  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  shall  refer  the  Inquiry  to  a  voluntary 
mediation and dispute resolution procedure.  

If the Grievance is determined to constitute a Complaint, the Respondent shall be 
provided  a  copy  of  the  Complaint  with  notice  to  respond,  in  writing,  to  the 
allegations  of  the  Complaint.  The  notice  shall  advise  the  Respondent  that  the 
Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  may  provide  appropriate  information,  including  the 
Respondent’s  response,  to  law  enforcement  agencies  as  permitted  by  Rule  6.08. 
The  Respondent  shall  deliver  the  response  to  both  the  Office  of  the  Chief 
Disciplinary Counsel and the Complainant within thirty days after receipt of the 
notice.  

If  the  Grievance  is  determined  to  be  a  Discretionary  Referral,  the  Chief 
Disciplinary  Counsel  will  notify  the  Complainant  and  the  Respondent  of  the 
referral to the State Bar’s Client Attorney Assistance Program (CAAP).  No later 
than  sixty  days  after  the  Grievance  is  referred,  CAAP  will  notify  the  Chief 
Disciplinary  Counsel  of  the  outcome  of  the  referral.  The  Chief  Disciplinary 
Counsel must, within fifteen days of notification from CAAP, determine whether 
the Grievance should be dismissed as an Inquiry or proceed as a Complaint. The 
Chief Disciplinary Counsel and CAAP may share confidential information for all 
Grievances classified as Discretionary Referrals.   

Investigatory Panel Proceedings.  Proceedings of an Investigatory Panel shall be 
conducted by  a Panel  for the  county where the  alleged Professional Misconduct 
occurred,  in  whole  or  in  part.  If  the  acts  or  omissions  complained  of  occurred 
wholly outside the State of Texas, proceedings shall be conducted by a Panel for 
the  county  of  Respondent’s  residence  and,  if  Respondent  has  no  residence  in 
Texas, by a Panel for Travis County, Texas.   

Summary Disposition Panel Proceedings. Proceedings of a Summary Disposition 
Panel shall be conducted by a Panel for the county where the alleged Professional 
Misconduct occurred, in whole or in part. If the acts or omissions complained of 
occurred wholly outside the State of Texas, proceedings shall be conducted by a 
Panel  for  the  county  of  Respondent’s  residence  and,  if  Respondent  has  no 
residence in Texas, by a Panel for Travis County, Texas.

proceeding,  venue  shall  be  conducted  by  a  Panel  for  in  the  county  where  of 
Respondent’s principal place of practice is maintained; or if the Respondent does 
not  maintain  a  place  of  practice  within  the  State  of  Texas,  in  the  county  of 
Respondent’s residence; or if the Respondent maintains neither a residence nor a 
place of practice within the State of Texas, then in the county where the alleged 
Professional  Misconduct  occurred,  in  whole  or  in  part.  In  all  other  instances, 
venue is in Travis County, Texas.  

.12.   Investigation and Determination of Just Cause:  

o more than sixty days after the date by which the Respondent must file a written response to 
the  Complaint  as  set  forth  in  Rule  2.10,  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  shall  investigate  the 
Complaint and determine whether there is Just Cause.     

The Chief Disciplinary  Counsel  will investigate  a Complaint to  determine whether Just 
Cause exists.  

General  Rule:  The  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  must  make  a  Just  Cause 
determination  within  60  days  of  the  date  that  the  Respondent’s  response  to  the 
Complaint is due. 

Exceptions:  The  Just  Cause  determination  date  is  extended  to  60  days  after  the 
latest of: 

the date of compliance specified in any investigatory subpoena issued by 
the Chief Disciplinary Counsel; 

the date of any enforcement order issued by a district court under (E); or 

the date that an investigatory hearing is completed.  

 
During  the  investigation,  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel,  with  the  Committee  chair’s 
approval,  may  issue  a  subpoena  that  relates  directly  to  a  specific  allegation  of  attorney 
misconduct  for  the  production  of  documents,  electronically  stored  information,  or 
tangible things or to compel the attendance of a witness, including the Respondent, at an 
investigatory hearing.  
  
A  subpoena  must  notify  the  witness  of  the  time,  date,  and  place  of  appearance  or 
production and must contain a description of materials to be produced. A subpoena must 
be served on a witness personally or in accordance with Rule 21a, Texas Rules of Civil 
Procedure. Proof of service may be by certification of the server or by return receipt. A 
witness,  other  than  the  Respondent,  who  is  commanded  to  appear  at  an  investigatory 
hearing is entitled to the same fee and expense reimbursement as a witness commanded 
to appear in district court.    
 
Before  the  time  specified  for  compliance,  the  Respondent  or  witness  must  present  any

objection to the chair of the Investigatory Panel, if an investigatory hearing has been set, 
or to the Committee chair, if an investigatory hearing has not been set. Objections must 
be  made  in  good  faith.  If  the  chair  overrules  an  objection  in  whole  or  in  part,  and  the 
Respondent  or  witness  fails  to  comply  with  the  chair’s  ruling,  the  Chief  Disciplinary 
Counsel may seek to enforce the subpoena in district court under (E). 
 
The Chief Disciplinary Counsel may seek enforcement of a subpoena in the district court 
of the county in which appearance or production is required. The Respondent or witness 
may  raise  any  good  faith  objection  to  the  subpoena.  If  the  district  court  finds  that  a 
person’s noncompliance with or objection to a subpoena is in bad faith, then after notice 
and  a  hearing,  the  court  may  order  the  person  to  pay  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel’s 
reasonable  and  necessary  costs  and  attorney  fees.  The  district  court’s  order  is  not 
appealable. The Chief Disciplinary Counsel must not consider a Respondent’s good faith 
objection to an investigatory subpoena as grounds for Just Cause.  
 
The  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  may  set  a  Complaint  for  an  investigatory  hearing.  The 
hearing will be set before an Investigatory Panel and is a nonadversarial proceeding that 
may be conducted by teleconference. The chair of the Investigatory Panel may administer 
oaths  and  may  set  forth  procedures  for  eliciting  evidence,  including  witness  testimony. 
Witness  examination  may  be  conducted  by  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel,  the 
Respondent, or the Panel. An investigatory hearing is strictly confidential and any record 
may be released only for use in a disciplinary matter.  
 
An investigatory hearing may result in a Sanction negotiated with the Respondent or in 
the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel’s  dismissing  the  Complaint  or  finding  Just  Cause.  The 
terms  of a negotiated Sanction must be in  a written judgment  with  findings of fact  and 
conclusions  of  law.  The  judgment  must  be  entered  into  the  record  by  the  chair  of  the 
Investigatory Panel and signed by the Chief Disciplinary Counsel and the Respondent.   

.13.   Summary  Disposition  Setting:  Upon  investigation,  if  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel 
determines  that  Just  Cause  does  not  exist  to  proceed  on  the  Complaint,  the  Chief 
Disciplinary Counsel shall place the Complaint on a Summary Disposition Panel docket, 
which may be conducted by teleconference. At  the Summary Disposition Panel  docket, 
the Chief Disciplinary Counsel will present the Complaint together with any information, 
documents,  evidence,  and  argument  deemed  necessary  and  appropriate  by  the  Chief 
Disciplinary  Counsel,  without  the  presence  of  the  Complainant  or  Respondent.  The 
Summary Disposition Panel shall determine whether the Complaint should be dismissed 
or should proceed. If the Summary Disposition Panel dismisses the Complaint, both the 
Complainant and Respondent will be so notified. There is no appeal from a determination 
by  the  Summary  Disposition  Panel  that  the  Complaint  should  be  dismissed  or  should 
proceed. All Complaints presented to the Summary Disposition Panel and not dismissed 
will  proceed  in  accordance  with  Rule  2.14  and  Rule  2.15  be  placed  on  the  Hearing 
Docket. The fact that a Complaint was placed on the Summary Disposition Panel Docket 
and not dismissed is wholly inadmissible for any purpose in the instant or any subsequent 
Disciplinary  Proceeding  or  Disciplinary  Action.    Files  of  dismissed  Disciplinary 
Proceedings will be retained for one hundred eighty days, after which time the files may

extent necessary for statistical reporting purposes. In all instances where a Complaint is 
dismissed by a Summary Disposition Panel other than where the attorney is deceased or 
is not licensed to practice law in the State of Texas, the Chief Disciplinary Counsel shall 
refer the Inquiry to a voluntary mediation and dispute resolution procedure.  

.14.   Proceeding Upon a Determination of Just Cause: All rights characteristically reposed 
in a client by the common law of this State as to every Complaint not dismissed after an 
investigatory  hearing,  resolved

Disciplinary Counsel shall give the Respondent  written notice of the acts and/or 
omissions engaged in by the Respondent and of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of 
Professional Conduct that the Chief Disciplinary Counsel contends are violated by 
the  alleged  acts  and/or  omissions.  Such  notice  shall  be  given  by  certified  mail, 
return receipt requested, sent to the Respondent at the Address.

The  deliberations  and  voting  of  an  Investigatory  Panel  or  Evidentiary  Panel  are 
strictly  confidential  and  not  subject  to  discovery.  No  person  is  competent  to 
testify as to such deliberations and voting.  

Files  of  dismissed  Disciplinary  Proceedings  will  be  retained  for  one  hundred 
eighty  days,  after  which  time  the  files  may  be  destroyed.  No  permanent  record 
will be kept of Complaints dismissed except to the extent necessary for statistical 
reporting purposes. 

.17  Evidentiary  Hearings:  Within  fifteen  days  of  the  earlier  of  the  date  of  Chief 
Disciplinary  Counsel’s  receipt  of  Respondent’s  election  or  the  day  following  the  expiration  of 
Respondent’s  right  to  elect,  the  chair  of  a  Committee  having  proper  venue  shall  appoint  an 
Evidentiary Panel to hear the Complaint. The Evidentiary Panel may not include any person who 
served  on  a  Summary  Disposition  Docket  or  an Investigatory  pPanel  that  heard  the  Complaint

proper  form  and  is  responsible  for  securing  service.  Proof  of  service  may  be  by 
certification of the server or by return receipt. Any contest between the Commission and 
the  Respondent  about  the  materiality  of  the  testimony  or  production  sought  by  a 
subpoena  shall  will  be  determined  by  the  Evidentiary  Panel  chair,  and  is  subject  to 
review.  Subpoenas  must  be  served  on  witnesses  personally  or  in  accordance  with  Rule 
21a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.  Proof of service shall be by certification of 
the  server  or  by  the  return  receipt.  The  Commission  or  the  Respondent  may  seek 
enforcement  of  a  subpoena  is  enforceable  by  in  the  district  court    of    the    county    in  
which the  attendance  or  production  is  required. A witness, other than the Respondent, 
Witnesses shall be paid witness fees and mileage the same as for a district court who is 
commanded  to  appear  at  an  Evidentiary  Panel  hearing  is  entitled  to  the  same  fee  and 
expense reimbursement as a witness commanded to appear in district court. 

.18.   Imposition  of  Sanctions:  The  Evidentiary  Panel  may,  in  its  discretion,  conduct  a 
separate  hearing  and  receive  evidence  as  to  the  appropriate  Sanctions  to  be  imposed. 
Indefinite  Disability  sanction  is  not  an  available  Sanction  in  a  hearing  before  an 
Evidentiary Panel. In determining the appropriate Sanctions, the Evidentiary Panel shall 
consider:  

The nature and degree of the Professional Misconduct for which the Respondent 
is being sanctioned;  

The seriousness of and circumstances surrounding the Professional Misconduct;  

The  assurance  that  those  who  seek  legal  services  in  the  future  will  be  insulated 
from the type of Professional Misconduct found; 

The loss or damage to clients;   

The damage to the profession; 

The profit to the attorney;

successfully  pursuing  in  good  faith  a  program  of  recovery  or  appropriate  course  of 
treatment.  

.182.19. Terms of Judgment: In any judgment of disbarment or suspension that is not stayed, 
the Evidentiary Panel shall order the Respondent to surrender his or her law license and 
permanent State Bar card to the Chief Disciplinary Counsel for transmittal to the Clerk of 
the Supreme Court. In all judgments imposing disbarment or suspension, the Evidentiary 
Panel shall enjoin the Respondent from practicing law or from holding himself or herself 
out as an attorney eligible to practice law during the period of disbarment or suspension. 
In  all  judgments  of  disbarment,  suspension,  or  reprimand,  the  Evidentiary  Panel  shall 
make all other orders as it finds appropriate, including probation of all or any portion of 
suspension.  

.192.20.  Restitution:  In  all  cases  in  which  the  proof  establishes  that  the  Respondent’s 
misconduct  involved  the  misappropriation  of  funds  and  the  Respondent  is  disbarred  or 
suspended, the panel’s judgment must require the Respondent to make restitution during 
the period of suspension, or before any consideration of reinstatement from disbarment, 
and  must  further  provide  that  its  judgment  of  suspension  shall  remain  in  effect  until 
evidence  of  satisfactory  restitution  is  made  by  Respondent  and  verified  by  the  Chief 
Disciplinary Counsel.  

.202.21. Notice of Decision: The Complainant, the Respondent, and the Commission must be 
notified  in  writing  of  the  judgment  of  the  Evidentiary  Panel.  The  notice  sent  to  the 
Respondent and the Commission must clearly state that any appeal of the judgment must 
be  filed  with  the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals  within  thirty  days  of  the  date  of  the 
notice.  If  the  Evidentiary  Panel  finds  that  the  Respondent  committed  professional 
misconduct, a copy of the Evidentiary Petition and the judgment shall be transmitted by 
the  Office  of  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  to  the  Clerk  of  the  Supreme  Court.  The 
Clerk  of  the  Supreme  Court  shall  make  an  appropriate  notation  on  the  Respondent’s 
permanent record.  

.212.22.  Post  Judgment  Motions:  Any  motion  for  new  hearing  or  motion  to  modify  the 
judgment  must  comport  with  the  provisions  of  the  applicable  Texas  Rules  of  Civil 
Procedure pertaining to motions for new trial or to motions to modify judgments.  

.222.23. Probated Suspension--Revocation Procedure: If all or any part of a suspension from 
the  practice  of  law  is  probated  under  this  Part  II,  the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals  is 
hereby  granted  jurisdiction  for  the  full  term  of  suspension,  including  any  probationary 
period,  to  hear  a  motion  to  revoke  probation.  If  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  files  a 
motion to revoke probation, it shall be set for hearing within thirty days of service of the 
motion upon the Respondent. Service upon the Respondent shall be sufficient if made in 
accordance  with  Rule  21a  of  the  Texas  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.  Upon  proof,  by  a 
preponderance of the evidence, of a violation of probation, the same shall be revoked and 
the attorney suspended from the practice of law for the full term  of suspension without 
credit  for  any  probationary  time  served.  The  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals’  Order 
revoking a probated suspension cannot be superseded or stayed.

.232.24.  Appeals  by  Respondent  or  Commission:  The  Respondent  or  Commission  may 
appeal the judgment to the Board of Disciplinary Appeals. Such appeals must be on the 
record,  determined  under  the  standard  of  substantial  evidence.  Briefs  may  be  filed  as  a 
matter of right. The time deadlines for such briefs shall be promulgated by the Board of 
Disciplinary Appeals. An appeal, if taken, is perfected when a written notice of appeal is 
filed  with  the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals.  The  notice  of  appeal  must  reflect  the 
intention of the Respondent or the Commission to appeal and identify the decision from 
which appeal is perfected. The notice of appeal must be filed within thirty days after the 
date of judgment, except that the notice of appeal must be filed within ninety days after 
the date of judgment if any party timely files a motion for new trial or a motion to modify 
the judgment.  

.242.25. No Supersedeas: An Evidentiary Panel’s order of disbarment cannot be superseded or 
stayed.  The  Respondent  may  within  thirty  days  from  entry  of  judgment  petition  the 
Evidentiary Panel to stay a judgment of suspension. The Respondent carries the burden of 
proof  by  preponderance  of  the  evidence  to  establish  by  competent  evidence  that  the 
Respondent’s continued practice of law does not pose a continuing threat to the welfare 
of Respondent’s clients  or to  the public. An order of suspension must be stayed during 
the pendency of any appeals therefrom if the Evidentiary Panel finds that the Respondent 
has  met  that  burden  of  proof.  An  Evidentiary  Panel  may  condition  its  stay  upon 
reasonable terms, which may include, but are not limited to, the cessation of any practice 
found  to  constitute  Professional  Misconduct,  or  it  may  impose  a  requirement  of  an 
affirmative act such as an audit of a Respondent’s client trust account.  

.252.26. Disposition on Appeal: The Board of Disciplinary Appeals may, in any appeal of the 

judgment of an Evidentiary Panel within its jurisdiction:

remand  is  heard  by  a  statewide  grievance  committee  panel,  the  Board  of  Disciplinary 
Appeals  must  find  that  good  cause  was  shown  in  the  record  on  appeal.  The  Board  of

Disciplinary  Appeals  shall  randomly  select  the  members  of  the  statewide  grievance 
committee panel from grievance committees other than the district from which the appeal 
was taken. Six such members shall be selected,  four of whom are attorneys  and two of 
whom are public members. The statewide grievance committee panel, once selected, shall 
have all duties and responsibilities of the Evidentiary Panel for purposes of the remand.  

.272.28.  Appeal  to  Supreme  Court  of  Texas:  An  appeal  from  the  decision  of  the  Board  of 
Disciplinary Appeals on an Evidentiary Proceeding is to the Supreme Court of Texas in 
accordance with Rule 7.11.  

 
PART III.  TRIAL IN DISTRICT COURT 

.10.  Imposition  of  Sanctions:  The  trial  court  may,  in  its  discretion,  conduct  a  separate 
hearing  and  receive  evidence  as  to  the  appropriate  Sanctions  to  be  imposed.  Private 
reprimand  is  not  an  available  Sanction.  Indefinite  Disability  suspension  is  not  an 
available Sanction. In determining the appropriate Sanctions, the court shall consider: 

A.  

The nature and degree of the Professional Misconduct for which the Respondent 
is being sanctioned; 

B.  

The seriousness of and circumstances surrounding the Professional Misconduct; 

E.  

The  assurance  that  those  who  seek  legal  services  in  the  future  will  be  insulated 
from the type of Professional Misconduct found; 

C. 

The loss or damage to clients; 

D.  

The damage to the profession;

n  addition,  the  Respondent's  disciplinary  record,  including  any  private  reprimands,  is 
admissible on the appropriate Sanction to  be imposed. Respondent's Disability may not 
be  considered  in  mitigation,  unless  Respondent  demonstrates  that  he  or  she  is 
successfully  pursuing  in  good  faith  a  program  of  recovery  or  appropriate  course  of 
treatment. 

.10 3.11. Terms of Judgment: In any judgment of disbarment or suspension that is not stayed, 
the  court  shall  order  the  Respondent  to  surrender  his  or  her  law  license  and  permanent 
State Bar card to Chief Disciplinary Counsel for transmittal to the Clerk of the Supreme 
Court.  In  all  judgments  imposing  disbarment  or  suspension,  the  court  shall  enjoin  the 
Respondent  from  practicing  law  or  from  holding  himself  or  herself  out  as  an  attorney 
eligible to practice law during the period of disbarment or suspension. In all judgments of 
disbarment,  suspension,  or  reprimand,  the  court  shall  make  all  other  orders  as  it  finds 
appropriate,  including  probation  of  all  or  any  portion  of  suspension.  The  continuing 
jurisdiction of the trial court to enforce a judgment does not give a trial court authority to 
terminate or reduce a period of active or probated suspension previously ordered. 

.11 3.12. Restitution: In all cases in which the proof establishes that the Respondent's conduct 
involved  misapplication  of  funds  and  the  judgment  is  one  disbarring  or  suspending  the 
Respondent,  the  judgment  must  require  the  Respondent  to  make  restitution  during  the 
period of suspension, or before any consideration of reinstatement from disbarment, and 
shall  further  provide  that  a  judgment  of  suspension  shall  remain  in  effect  until  proof  is 
made of complete restitution. 

.12  3.13.  Probation  Suspension--Revocation  Procedure:  If  all  or  any  part  of  a  suspension 
from  the  practice  of  law  is  probated  under  this  Part  III,  the  court  retains  jurisdiction 
during the full term of suspension, including any probationary period, to hear a motion to 
revoke probation. If the Chief Disciplinary Counsel files a motion to revoke probation, it 
shall  be  set  for  hearing  before  the  court  without  the  aid  of  a  jury  within  thirty  days  of 
service  of  the  motion  upon  the  Respondent.  Service  upon  the  Respondent  shall  be 
sufficient  if  made  in  accordance  with  Rule  21a  of  the  Texas  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure. 
Upon proof by a preponderance of the evidence of a violation of probation, the same shall 
be  revoked  and  the  attorney  suspended  from  the  practice  of  law  for  the  full  term  of 
suspension without credit for any probationary time served. 

.13  3.14.  No  Supersedeas:  A  district  court  judgment  of  disbarment  or  an  order  revoking 
probation of a suspension from the practice of law cannot be superseded or stayed. The 
Respondent  may  within  thirty  days  from  entry  of  judgment  petition  the  court  to  stay  a 
judgment of suspension. The Respondent carries the burden of proof by preponderance of 
the evidence to establish by competent evidence that the Respondent's continued practice 
of law does not pose a continuing threat to the welfare of Respondent's clients or to the 
public.  A  judgment  of  suspension  shall  be  stayed  during  the  pendency  of  any  appeals 
therefrom if the district court finds that the Respondent has met that burden of proof. The 
district  court may  condition  its stay upon reasonable terms, which may include, but  are 
not limited to, the cessation of any practice found to constitute Professional Misconduct, 

  I

or it may impose a requirement of an affirmative act such as an audit of a Respondent's 
client trust account. There is no interlocutory appeal from a court's stay of a suspension, 
with or without conditions. 

.14 3.15. Exemption from Cost and Appeal Bond: No cost or appeal bond is required of the

Purpose of Lawyer Discipline Proceedings.  
The  purpose  of  lawyer  discipline  proceedings  is  to  protect  the  public  and  the 
administration of justice from lawyers who have not discharged, will not discharge, or are 
unlikely  to  properly  discharge  their  professional  duties  to  clients,  the  public,  the  legal 
system, and the legal profession.  
 
Purpose of These Guidelines.  
These  Guidelines  are  designed  for  use  in  Disciplinary  Actions  and  Disciplinary 
Proceedings  under  Parts  II  and  III  of  the  Texas  Rules  of  Disciplinary  Procedure.    The 
Guidelines  set  forth  a  comprehensive  system  for  determining  sanctions,  permitting 
flexibility and creativity in assigning Sanctions in particular cases of lawyer misconduct. 
They  are  designed  to  promote:  (1)  consideration  of  all  factors  relevant  to  imposing  the 
appropriate level  of Sanction in  an individual case;  (2)  consideration of the appropriate 
weight of such factors in light of the stated goals of lawyer discipline; and (3) consistency 
in the imposition of disciplinary Sanctions for the same or similar rule violations among 
the various district  grievance committees and district courts that consider these matters.  
The Guidelines do not limit the authority of a district grievance committee or of a district 
judge to make a finding or issue a decision.   

5.02.  General Factors to be Considered in Imposing Sanctions  

In  imposing  a  sanction  after  a  finding  of  Professional  Misconduct,  the  disciplinary 
tribunal should consider the following factors:  
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
 

the duty violated;  
the Respondent’s level of culpability;  
the potential or actual injury caused by the  Respondent’s misconduct; and  
the existence of aggravating or mitigating factors.  

15.03.  Imposition of Sanctions 
 

In any Disciplinary Proceeding or Disciplinary Action where Professional Misconduct is 
found  have  occurred,  the  district  grievance  committee  or  district  court  may,  in  its 
discretion,  conduct  a  separate  hearing  and  receive  evidence  as  to  the  appropriate 
Sanctions to be imposed.

16.01.  Grievance  Referral  Program.  The  Grievance  Referral  Program  is  established  as  a 
diversion program designed to address professionalism issues in minor misconduct cases 
and component of the attorney discipline system. 

6.02.  Eligibility.  The following criteria are to be considered for participation in the program:  

Respondent has not been disciplined within the prior three years. 

Respondent  has  not  been  disciplined  for  similar  conduct  within  the  prior  five 
years. 

Misconduct  does  not  involve  misappropriation  of  funds  or  breach  of  fiduciary 
duties. 

.  Misconduct does not involve dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation.  

Misconduct  did  not  result  in  substantial  harm  or  prejudice  to  client  or 
complainant. 

Respondent maintained cooperative attitude toward the proceedings.  

Participation is likely to benefit the Respondent and further the goal of protection 
of the public.  

.  Misconduct  does  not  constitute  a  crime  that  would  subject  the  Respondent  to 

compulsory discipline under Part VIII of these Rules. 

6.03.  Procedure. 

The  Commission  may  refer  an  eligible  Respondent  to  the  program  in  any 
disciplinary  matter  that  has  reached  the  Just  Cause  stage  of  the  process.    An 
eligible  Respondent  may  also  be  referred  to  the  program  after  an  investigatory 
hearing pursuant to Rule 2.12. 

The  Respondent  must  agree  to  meet  with  the  program  administrator  for  an 
assessment of the professionalism issues that contributed to the misconduct. 

The Respondent must agree in writing to waive any applicable time limits and to 
complete specific terms  and conditions,  including restitution  if appropriate, by  a 
date certain and to pay for any costs associated with the terms and conditions. 

If  the  Respondent  agrees  to  participate  and  completes  the  terms  in  a  timely 
manner, the underlying grievance will be dismissed. 

If the Respondent does not fully complete the terms of the agreement in a timely 
manner,  the  underlying  grievance  will  continue  in  the  ordinary  disciplinary

PART XVIIXV.  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 

7.0115.01.  Enforcement of Judgments: The following judgments have the force of a final 
judgment of a district court: judgments entered by an Investigatory Panel, final judgments 
of an Evidentiary Panel and judgments entered by the Board of Disciplinary Appeals. To 
enforce  a  judgment,  the  Commission  may  apply  to  a  district  court  in  the  county  of  the 
residence of the Respondent.  In enforcing the judgment, the court has available to it all 
writs and processes, as well as the power of contempt, to enforce the judgment as if the 
judgment had been the court’s own. 

7.0215.02.  Effect  of  Related  Litigation:  The  processing  of  a  Grievance,  Complaint, 
Disciplinary  Proceeding,  or  Disciplinary  Action  is  not,  except  for  good  cause,  to  be 
delayed or abated because of substantial similarity to the material allegations in pending 
civil or criminal litigation.

7.0415.04.  Effect  of  Delay  or  Settlement  by  Complainant:  None  of  the  following  alone 
justifies  the  discontinuance  or  abatement  of  a  Grievance  or  Complaint  being  processed 
through the disciplinary system: (1) the unwillingness or the neglect of a Complainant to 
cooperate; (2) the settlement or compromise of matters between the Complainant and the 
Respondent; (3) the payment of monies by the Respondent to the Complainant. 

7.0515.05.  Effect of Time Limitations: The time periods provided in Rules 2.10, 2.12, 2.15,
