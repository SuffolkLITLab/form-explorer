PART II. THE DISTRICT GRIEVANCE COMMITTEES 
 

.06.   Assignment of Committee Members: Each member of a Committee  shall act  through 
panels  assigned  by  the  chair  of  the  Committee  for  investigatory  hearings,  summary 
disposition dockets, and evidentiary hearings. Promptly after assignment, notice must be 
provided to  the Respondent  by  United States  certified mail,  return  receipt  requested, of 
the names and addresses of the panel members assigned to each Complaint. A member is 
disqualified  or  is  subject  to  recusal  as  a  panel  member  for  an  evidentiary  hearing  if  a 
district judge would, under similar circumstances, be disqualified or recused. If a member 
is disqualified or recused, another member shall be appointed by the Committee chair. No 
peremptory  challenges  of  a  Committee  member  are  allowed.  Any  alleged  grounds  for 
disqualification or recusal of a panel member are conclusively waived if not brought to 
the  attention  of  the  panel  within  ten  days  after  receipt  of  notification  of  the  names  and 
addresses of members of the panel; however, grounds for disqualification or recusal not 
reasonably discoverable within the ten day period may be asserted within ten days after 
they  were  discovered  or  in  the  exercise  of  reasonable  diligence  should  have  been 
discovered.  

.07.   Duties  of  Committees:  Committees  shall  act  through  panels,  as  assigned  by  the 
Committee  chairs,  to  conduct  investigatory  hearings,  summary  disposition  dockets,  and 
evidentiary hearings. No panel may consist of more than one-half of all members of the 
Committee or fewer than three members. If a member of a panel is disqualified, recused 
or  otherwise  unable  to  serve,  the  chair  shall  appoint  a  replacement.  Panels  must  be 
composed of two attorney members for each public member. A quorum must include at 
least  one  public  member  for  every  two  attorney  members  present  and  consists  of  a 
majority of the membership of the panel, and business shall be conducted upon majority 
vote  of  those  members  present,  a  quorum  being  had.  In  matters  in  which  evidence  is 
taken, no member may vote unless that member has heard or reviewed all the evidence. It 
shall  be  conclusively  presumed,  however,  not  subject  to  discovery  or  challenge  in  any 
subsequent  proceeding, that  every member casting  a vote has heard or  reviewed  all the 
evidence. No member, attorney or public, may be appointed by the chair  to an for both 
the  Summary  Disposition  docket  and  the  Evidentiary  Panel  pertaining  to  the  same 
disciplinary  matter  that  the  member  considered  at  either  an  investigatory  hearing  or 
summary  disposition  docket.  Any  tie  vote  is  a  vote  in  favor  of  the  position  of  the 
Respondent.  

.10.   Classification  of  Grievances  Inquiries  and  Complaints:  The  Chief  Disciplinary

Complainant may, within thirty days from notification of the dismissal, appeal the 
determination to the Board of Disciplinary Appeals.  If the Board of Disciplinary 
Appeals  affirms  the  classification  as  an  Inquiry,  the  Complainant  will  be  so 
notified  and  may  within  twenty  days  amend  the  Grievance  one  time  only  by 
providing new or additional evidence. The Complainant may appeal a decision by 
the Chief Disciplinary Counsel to dismiss the amended Complaint as an Inquiry to 
the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals.  No  further  amendments  or  appeals  will  be 
accepted. In all instances where a Grievance is dismissed as an Inquiry other than 
where  the  attorney  is  deceased  or  is  not  licensed  to  practice  law  in  the  State  of 
Texas,  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  shall  refer  the  Inquiry  to  a  voluntary 
mediation and dispute resolution procedure.

Respondent’s  response,  to  law  enforcement  agencies  as  permitted  by  Rule  6.08. 
The  Respondent  shall  deliver  the  response  to  both  the  Office  of  the  Chief 
Disciplinary Counsel and the Complainant within thirty days  after receipt of the 
notice.  

If  the  Grievance  is  determined  to  be  a  Discretionary  Referral,  the  Chief 
Disciplinary  Counsel  will  notify  the  Complainant  and  the  Respondent  of  the 
referral to the State Bar’s Client Attorney Assistance Program (CAAP).  No later 
than  sixty  days  after  the  Grievance  is  referred,  CAAP  will  notify  the  Chief 
Disciplinary  Counsel  of  the  outcome  of  the  referral.  The  Chief  Disciplinary 
Counsel must, within fifteen days of notification from CAAP, determine whether 
the Grievance should be dismissed as an Inquiry or proceed as a Complaint. The 
Chief Disciplinary Counsel and CAAP may share confidential information for all 
Grievances classified as Discretionary Referrals.   

Investigatory Panel Proceedings.  Proceedings of an Investigatory Panel shall be 
conducted by  a Panel  for the  county where the  alleged Professional Misconduct 
occurred,  in  whole  or  in  part.  If  the  acts  or  omissions  complained  of  occurred 
wholly outside the State of Texas, proceedings shall be conducted by a Panel for 
the  county  of  Respondent’s  residence  and,  if  Respondent  has  no  residence  in 
Texas, by a Panel for Travis County, Texas.

place of practice within the State of Texas, then in the county where the alleged 
Professional  Misconduct  occurred,  in  whole  or  in  part.  In  all  other  instances, 
venue is in Travis County, Texas.  

No  more  than  sixty  days  after  the  date  by  which  the  Respondent  must  file  a 
written response to the Complaint as set forth in Rule 2.10, the Chief Disciplinary 
Counsel  shall  investigate  the  Complaint  and  determine  whether  there  is  Just 
Cause.     

During the investigation, the Chief Disciplinary Counsel, with the approval of the 
chair of the Committee, may issue  a subpoena that  relates  to  the Complaint, for 
the production of books, documents, papers, banking records, and other tangible 
things. Any contest between the Chief Disciplinary Counsel and  the Respondent 
about the materiality of the production sought will be determined by the chair of 
the Committee. 

The Chief Disciplinary Counsel may set a Complaint for an investigatory hearing 
and, with the approval of the chair of the Investigatory Panel, issue a subpoena (1)

The issuance of a subpoena or setting of an investigatory hearing extends the Just 
Cause  determination  date  to  sixty  days  from  the  date  of  compliance  with  a 
subpoena or the completion of an investigatory hearing, whichever is later.  

An investigatory hearing on a Complaint will be set before an Investigatory Panel 
and is a nonadversarial proceeding that may be conducted by teleconference. The 
chair  of  the  Investigatory  Panel  may  administer  oaths  and  may  set  forth 
testimony.  Witness 
procedures  for  eliciting  evidence, 
examination  may  be  conducted  by  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel, 
the 
Respondent, or the panel.  An investigatory hearing is strictly confidential and any 
record, transcript, or audio or visual recording may be released only for use in a 
disciplinary matter.  

including  witness 

An  investigatory  hearing  may  result  in  a  dismissal  of  the  Complaint  or  a 
negotiated sanction with the Respondent.  A negotiated sanction may include any 
Sanction available under these rules, including a referral to the Grievance Referral 
Program in accordance with Part XVI of these Rules.  If a negotiated sanction is 
reached, the terms shall be embodied in a written judgment, which must contain 
findings  of  fact,  conclusions  of  law,  and  the  Sanctions  to  be  imposed.  The 
judgment must  be entered by the chair  of the  Investigatory Panel  and signed by 
the Chief Disciplinary Counsel and the Respondent. If a negotiated sanction is not 
reached, the Complaint will proceed in accordance with Rule 2.14 and Rule 2.15.

2.13.   Summary  Disposition  Setting:  Upon  investigation,  if  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel 
determines  that  Just  Cause  does  not  exist  to  proceed  on  the  Complaint,  the  Chief 
Disciplinary Counsel shall place the Complaint on a Summary Disposition Panel docket, 
which may be conducted by teleconference. At  the Summary Disposition Panel  docket, 
the Chief Disciplinary Counsel will present the Complaint together with any information, 
documents,  evidence,  and  argument  deemed  necessary  and  appropriate  by  the  Chief 
Disciplinary  Counsel,  without  the  presence  of  the  Complainant  or  Respondent.  The 
Summary Disposition Panel shall determine whether the Complaint should be dismissed 
or should proceed. If the Summary Disposition Panel dismisses the Complaint, both the 
Complainant and Respondent will be so notified. There is no appeal from a determination 
by  the  Summary  Disposition  Panel  that  the  Complaint  should  be  dismissed  or  should 
proceed. All Complaints presented to the Summary Disposition Panel and not dismissed 
will  proceed  in  accordance  with  Rule  2.14  and  Rule  2.15  be  placed  on  the  Hearing 
Docket. The fact that a Complaint was placed on the Summary Disposition Panel Docket 
and not dismissed is wholly inadmissible for any purpose in the instant or any subsequent 
Disciplinary  Proceeding  or  Disciplinary  Action.    Files  of  dismissed  Disciplinary 
Proceedings will be retained for one hundred eighty days, after which time the files may 
be  destroyed.  No  permanent  record  will  be  kept  of  Complaints  dismissed  except  to  the 
extent necessary for statistical reporting purposes. In all instances where a Complaint is 
dismissed by a Summary Disposition Panel other than where the attorney is deceased or 
is not licensed to practice law in the State of Texas, the Chief Disciplinary Counsel shall 
refer the Inquiry to a voluntary mediation and dispute resolution procedure.

.14.   Proceeding Upon a Determination of Just Cause: All rights characteristically reposed 
in a client by the common law of this State as to every Complaint not dismissed after an 
investigatory  hearing,  resolved 
judgment  entered  by  an 
Investigatory  Panel,  or  dismissed  by  the  Summary  Disposition  Panel  are  vested  in  the 
Commission.  

through  a  negotiated 

Client of Chief Disciplinary Counsel: The Commission is the client of the Chief 
Disciplinary  Counsel  for  every  Complaint  not  dismissed  after  an  investigatory 
hearing,  resolved  through  a  negotiated  judgment  entered  by  an  Investigatory 
Panel, or dismissed by the Summary Disposition Panel.   

Notification  of  Complaint:  For  each  Complaint  not  dismissed  after  an 
investigatory  hearing,  resolved  through  a  negotiated  judgment  entered  by  an 
Investigatory  Panel,  or  dismissed  by  the  Summary  Disposition  Panel,  the  Chief 
Disciplinary Counsel shall give the Respondent  written notice of the acts and/or 
omissions engaged in by the Respondent and of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of 
Professional Conduct that the Chief Disciplinary Counsel contends are violated by 
the  alleged  acts  and/or  omissions.  Such  notice  shall  be  given  by  certified  mail, 
return receipt requested, sent to the Respondent at the Address.  

.16.   Confidentiality:  

A.  

All  members  and  staff  of  the  Office  of  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel,  Board  of 
Disciplinary  Appeals,  Committees,  and  Commission  shall  maintain  as 
confidential all Disciplinary Proceedings and associated records, except that:  

a negotiated judgment entered by an Investigatory Panel for any Sanction 
other than a private reprimand may be disclosed;  

if  the  Evidentiary  Panel  finds  that  professional  misconduct  occurred  and 
imposes any Sanction other than a private reprimand;  

the Evidentiary Panel’s final judgment is a public record from the 
date the judgment is signed; and  

once all appeals, if any, have been exhausted and the judgment is 
final, the Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel shall, upon request, 
disclose all documents,  statements,  and other information relating

to  the  Disciplinary  Proceeding  that  came  to  the  attention  of  the 
Evidentiary Panel during the Disciplinary Proceeding;  

the  record  in  any  appeal  to  the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals  from  an 
Evidentiary Panel’s final judgment, other than an appeal from a judgment 
of private reprimand, is a public record; and  

facts  and  evidence  that  are  discoverable  elsewhere  are  not  made 
confidential merely because they are discussed or introduced in the course 
of a Disciplinary Proceeding.

The  deliberations  and  voting  of  an  Investigatory  Panel  or  Evidentiary  Panel  are 
strictly  confidential  and  not  subject  to  discovery.  No  person  is  competent  to 
testify as to such deliberations and voting.  

Files  of  dismissed  Disciplinary  Proceedings  will  be  retained  for  one  hundred 
eighty  days,  after  which  time  the  files  may  be  destroyed.  No  permanent  record 
will be kept of Complaints dismissed except to the extent necessary for statistical 
reporting purposes. 

.18.   Imposition  of  Sanctions:  The  Evidentiary  Panel  may,  in  its  discretion,  conduct  a 
separate  hearing  and  receive  evidence  as  to  the  appropriate  Sanctions  to  be  imposed. 
Indefinite  Disability  sanction  is  not  an  available  Sanction  in  a  hearing  before  an 
Evidentiary Panel. In determining the appropriate Sanctions, the Evidentiary Panel shall 
consider:  

The nature and degree of the Professional Misconduct for which the Respondent 
is being sanctioned;  

The seriousness of and circumstances surrounding the Professional Misconduct;  

The loss or damage to clients;   

The damage to the profession; 

The  assurance  that  those  who  seek  legal  services  in  the  future  will  be  insulated 
from the type of Professional Misconduct found; 

The profit to the attorney;  
 
The avoidance of repetition;

The conduct of the Respondent during the course of the Disciplinary Proceeding;  

In  addition,  the  Respondent’s  disciplinary  record,  including  any  private  reprimands,  is 
admissible on the appropriate Sanction to be imposed. Respondent’s Disability may not 
be  considered  in  mitigation,  unless  Respondent  demonstrates  that  he  or  she  is 
successfully  pursuing  in  good  faith  a  program  of  recovery  or  appropriate  course  of 
treatment.  

.182.19. Terms of Judgment: In any judgment of disbarment or suspension that is not stayed, 
the Evidentiary Panel shall order the Respondent to surrender his or her law license and 
permanent State Bar card to the Chief Disciplinary Counsel for transmittal to the Clerk of 
the Supreme Court. In all judgments imposing disbarment or suspension, the Evidentiary 
Panel shall enjoin the Respondent from practicing law or from holding himself or herself 
out as an attorney eligible to practice law during the period of disbarment or suspension. 
In  all  judgments  of  disbarment,  suspension,  or  reprimand,  the  Evidentiary  Panel  shall 
make all other orders as it finds appropriate, including probation of all or any portion of 
suspension.  

.192.20.  Restitution:  In  all  cases  in  which  the  proof  establishes  that  the  Respondent’s 
misconduct  involved  the  misappropriation  of  funds  and  the  Respondent  is  disbarred  or 
suspended, the panel’s judgment must require the Respondent to make restitution during 
the period of suspension, or before any consideration of reinstatement from disbarment, 
and  must  further  provide  that  its  judgment  of  suspension  shall  remain  in  effect  until 
evidence  of  satisfactory  restitution  is  made  by  Respondent  and  verified  by  the  Chief 
Disciplinary Counsel.  

.202.21. Notice of Decision: The Complainant, the Respondent, and the Commission must be 
notified  in  writing  of  the  judgment  of  the  Evidentiary  Panel.  The  notice  sent  to  the 
Respondent and the Commission must clearly state that any appeal of the judgment must 
be  filed  with  the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals  within  thirty  days  of  the  date  of  the 
notice.  If  the  Evidentiary  Panel  finds  that  the  Respondent  committed  professional 
misconduct, a copy of the Evidentiary Petition and the judgment shall be transmitted by 
the  Office  of  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  to  the  Clerk  of  the  Supreme  Court.  The 
Clerk  of  the  Supreme  Court  shall  make  an  appropriate  notation  on  the  Respondent’s 
permanent record.  

.212.22.  Post  Judgment  Motions:  Any  motion  for  new  hearing  or  motion  to  modify  the 
judgment  must  comport  with  the  provisions  of  the  applicable  Texas  Rules  of  Civil 
Procedure pertaining to motions for new trial or to motions to modify judgments.  

.222.23. Probated Suspension--Revocation Procedure: If all or any part of a suspension from

the  practice  of  law  is  probated  under  this  Part  II,  the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals  is 
hereby  granted  jurisdiction  for  the  full  term  of  suspension,  including  any  probationary 
period,  to  hear  a  motion  to  revoke  probation.  If  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  files  a 
motion to revoke probation, it shall be set for hearing within thirty days of service of the 
motion upon the Respondent. Service upon the Respondent shall be sufficient if made in 
accordance  with  Rule  21a  of  the  Texas  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.  Upon  proof,  by  a 
preponderance of the evidence, of a violation of probation, the same shall be revoked and 
the attorney suspended from the practice of law for the full term  of suspension without 
credit  for  any  probationary  time  served.  The  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals’  Order 
revoking a probated suspension cannot be superseded or stayed.  

.232.24.  Appeals  by  Respondent  or  Commission:  The  Respondent  or  Commission  may 
appeal the judgment to the Board of Disciplinary Appeals. Such appeals must be on the 
record,  determined  under  the  standard  of  substantial  evidence.  Briefs  may  be  filed  as  a 
matter of right. The time deadlines for such briefs shall be promulgated by the Board of 
Disciplinary Appeals. An appeal, if taken, is perfected when a written notice of appeal is 
filed  with  the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals.  The  notice  of  appeal  must  reflect  the 
intention of the Respondent or the Commission to appeal and identify the decision from 
which appeal is perfected. The notice of appeal must be filed within thirty days after the 
date of judgment, except that the notice of appeal must be filed within ninety days after 
the date of judgment if any party timely files a motion for new trial or a motion to modify 
the judgment.  

.242.25. No Supersedeas: An Evidentiary Panel’s order of disbarment cannot be superseded or 
stayed.  The  Respondent  may  within  thirty  days  from  entry  of  judgment  petition  the 
Evidentiary Panel to stay a judgment of suspension. The Respondent carries the burden of 
proof  by  preponderance  of  the  evidence  to  establish  by  competent  evidence  that  the 
Respondent’s continued practice of law does not pose a continuing threat to the welfare 
of  Respondent’s clients  or to  the public. An order of suspension must be stayed during 
the pendency of any appeals therefrom if the Evidentiary Panel finds that the Respondent 
has  met  that  burden  of  proof.  An  Evidentiary  Panel  may  condition  its  stay  upon 
reasonable terms, which may include, but are not limited to, the cessation of any practice 
found  to  constitute  Professional  Misconduct,  or  it  may  impose  a  requirement  of  an 
affirmative act such as an audit of a Respondent’s client trust account.  

.252.26. Disposition on Appeal: The Board of Disciplinary Appeals may, in any appeal of the 

judgment of an Evidentiary Panel within its jurisdiction:  

A. 

B. 

C. 

Affirm the decision of the Evidentiary Panel, in whole or in part;  

Modify the Evidentiary Panel’s judgment and affirm it as modified;

judgment that the Evidentiary Panel should have rendered;

Appeals  must  find  that  good  cause  was  shown  in  the  record  on  appeal.  The  Board  of 
Disciplinary  Appeals  shall  randomly  select  the  members  of  the  statewide  grievance 
committee panel from grievance committees other than the district from which the appeal 
was taken. Six such members shall be selected,  four of whom  are attorneys  and two of 
whom are public members. The statewide grievance committee panel, once selected, shall

PART XV.  GUIDELINES FOR IMPOSING SANCTIONS MISCELLANEOUS 
PROVISIONS 
 

15.01.  Purpose and Nature of Sanctions 

Purpose of Lawyer Discipline Proceedings.  
The  purpose  of  lawyer  discipline  proceedings  is  to  protect  the  public  and  the 
administration of justice from lawyers who have not discharged, will not discharge, or are 
unlikely  to  properly  discharge  their  professional  duties  to  clients,  the  public,  the  legal 
system, and the legal profession.  
 
Purpose of These Guidelines.  
These  Guidelines  are  designed  for  use  in  Disciplinary  Actions  and  Disciplinary 
Proceedings  under  Parts  II  and  III  of  the  Texas  Rules  of  Disciplinary  Procedure.    The 
Guidelines  set  forth  a  comprehensive  system  for  determining  sanctions,  permitting 
flexibility and creativity in assigning Sanctions in particular cases of lawyer misconduct. 
They  are  designed  to  promote:  (1)  consideration  of  all  factors  relevant  to  imposing  the 
appropriate level  of Sanction in  an individual case;  (2)  consideration of the appropriate 
weight of such factors in light of the stated goals of lawyer discipline; and (3) consistency 
in the imposition of disciplinary Sanctions for the same or similar rule violations among 
the various district  grievance committees and district courts that consider these matters.  
The Guidelines do not limit the authority of a district grievance committee or of a district 
judge to make a finding or issue a decision.   

In  imposing  a  sanction  after  a  finding  of  Professional  Misconduct,  the  disciplinary 
tribunal should consider the following factors:  
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
 

the duty violated;  
the Respondent’s level of culpability;  
the potential or actual injury caused by the  Respondent’s misconduct; and  
the existence of aggravating or mitigating factors.  

In any Disciplinary Proceeding or Disciplinary Action where Professional Misconduct is 
found  have  occurred,  the  district  grievance  committee  or  district  court  may,  in  its 
discretion,  conduct  a  separate  hearing  and  receive  evidence  as  to  the  appropriate

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
