Disclaimer:
The  creation  and  production  of  this  Tool  Kit  for  Attorneys  Representing  the  Department 
of  Family  and  Protective  Services  in  Child  Welfare  Cases  is  funded  by  the  Children’s 
Commission through the federal Court Improvement Program. The materials in this tool 
kit should not be construed as an advisory or ruling by or from the Supreme Court of Texas 
or any other court on specific cases or legal issues. These materials are solely intended to 
address the improvement of the law, the legal system, and the administration of justice. The 
information included in this tool kit was originally released in April 2018 and updated in 
September 2022.

Letter from the Executive Director

September 1, 2022

Dear Practitioner,

The Supreme Court of Texas Permanent Judicial Commission on Children, Youth, and Families 
(“Children’s Commission”) is charged with strengthening courts for children, youth, and families 
in  the  child  welfare  system  and  thereby  improving  the  safety,  permanency,  and  well-being  of 
children. The Children’s Commission provides training, tools, resources, and support to judges 
and attorneys who work on child welfare cases across the state. One of the goals of the Children’s 
Commission is to promote high-quality court proceedings that safeguard due process, encourage 
meaningful child and family involvement, and include effective legal representation of all parties.

As  part  of  the  ongoing  commitment  to  elevate  the  practice  of  law  in  child  welfare  cases,  the 
Children’s  Commission  is  pleased  to  share  this  Tool  Kit  for  Attorneys  Representing  the 
Department of Family and Protective Services in Child Welfare Cases. This tool kit is designed 
to  benefit  attorneys  of  all  levels  of  experience  by  providing  concise  compilations  of  relevant 
legal  subjects,  applicable  state  and  federal  statutes,  hearing  checklists,  and  practice  tips  for 
representing parents and children in child welfare cases. The Commission hopes this tool kit will 
help promote best practices for attorneys in their advocacy both inside and outside the courtroom.

Please note that while this tool kit is designed for those representing the Department of Family 
and Protective Services (DFPS), it is among the many resources which the Children’s Commission 
has  developed,  supported,  and  provided  to  attorneys  representing  parents,  children,  and  the 
Department  of  Family  and  Protective  Services  as  well  as  judges  including:  the  Texas  Child 
Protection  Law  Bench  Book;  Trial  Skills  Training;  the  Family  Helpline;  the  Parent  Resource 
Guide; and the Tool Kit for Attorneys Representing Parents and Children in Child Welfare Cases. 
Like all Children’s Commission materials, this tool kit is available free of charge.

Thank you for your dedication and advocacy on behalf of the parents and children involved in 
Texas child welfare cases.

Sincerely,

Jamie Bernstein 
Executive Director  
Children’s Commission

Letter from the Texas District and County Attorneys Association

September 1, 2022

Members of the Commission,

Supreme Court of Texas Permanent Judicial Commission for Children, Youth, and 
Families

Protecting the children of this state is one of the most impmtant missions of those in 
govermnent service. On behalf of the Texas District and County Attorneys Association, 
I want to thank the members of the Commission and the Children’s Commission’s 
DFPS Representation Subcommittee who contributed to the original and updated 
versions of the Tool Kit for Attorneys Representing DFPS in Child Welfare Cases. 
Prosecutors in Texas have been honored to partner with the Texas Department of 
Family & Protective Services (“DFPS”) in working on child welfare cases, and TDCAA 
is grateful for the work the Commission has done in providing this resource for Texas 
prosecutors and others representing children in these important cases.

Letter from the Texas Department of Family & Protective Services

July 5, 2022

Supreme Court of Texas Permanent Judicial Commission for Children, Youth, and Families Members of the 
Commission,

On behalf of the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (“DFPS”), I am grateful for the 
opportunity to recommend the Tool Kit for Attorneys Representing DFPS in Child Protection Cases. The 
work we do in the area of child protection law can be as complex as it is urgent. Practitioners must master 
not only the laws specific to child welfare, but also the wider Texas Family Code, rules of evidence and 
procedure, administrative rules and DFPS policy. The result of joint efforts by the Commission, the Texas 
District and County Attorney’s Association, and DFPS, this updated Tool Kit manages to be both a thorough 
and convenient resource certain to be of great value to attorneys at any experience level. The Tool Kit 
demonstrates the power of collaboration in improving the lives of children, youth, and families in Texas.

I. Legal EssentialsBurden of Proof

Sufficient Evidence to Satisfy a Person of Ordinary
Prudence and Caution
Ordinary Prudence and Caution is similar to the Probable Cause standard required for a search 
warrant. Ordinary Prudence and Caution requires a minimal showing of evidence, less than a 
preponderance but enough to persuade a reasonable person. Applies to:

•	 Initial Hearing of a petition for COS/MTP. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(m); 
•	 Ex Parte Removal Hearing. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.101;
•	 Taking Possession of a Child in Emergency Without a Court Order. Tex. Fam. Code § 

262.104; and

•	 Adversary Hearing. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201.

Preponderance of the Evidence
Preponderance of the Evidence is evidence that is of greater weight or more convincing than the 
evidence that is offered in opposition to it. A metaphor to illustrate the concept is the scales of 
justice tipping slightly higher on one side; that is enough to meet the standard of Preponderance 
of the Evidence. It is the standard of proof generally used in civil cases. Applies to:

•	 60 Day Status Review. Tex. Fam. Code § 105.005;
•	 Permanency Hearing before Final Order. Tex. Fam. Code § 105.005;
•	 Final  Order  Awarding  Permanent  Managing  Conservatorship  (PMC)  (without 

termination). Tex. Fam. Code § 105.005;

•	 Permanency Hearing after Final Order. Tex. Fam. Code § 105.005;
•	 Adoption Hearing. Tex. Fam. Code § 105.005;
•	 Hearing on Reinstatement of Parental Rights. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.303.

Clear and Convincing
Clear  and  Convincing  is  the  measure  or  degree  of  proof  that  will  produce  in  the  mind  of  the 
trier of fact (either a judge or a jury) a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations 
sought to be established. More than just a “Preponderance of the Evidence” but not as much as 
“Beyond a Reasonable Doubt.” Applies to:

•	 Termination of Parental Rights when Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) does not apply. 

Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001 and 25 U.S.C. §1912(f); and

•	 An order placing a child in foster care under ICWA, 25 U.S.C. § 1912(e).

Beyond a Reasonable Doubt
The  Beyond  a  Reasonable  Doubt  standard  is  met  when  the  trier  of  fact  is  fully  satisfied,  or 
entirely convinced, that something occurred. Applies to:

•	 Termination cases subject to ICWA. 25 U.S.C. §1912(f).

prudence and caution

I. Legal EssentialsBest Interest of the Child

Best interest of the child is always the primary consideration in determining conservatorship, 
possession, and access. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. 

Court  Hearings  that  Can  Require  a  Best  Interest 
Determination
THE ADVERSARY HEARING

When considering placement with relative.

If the court does not order possession of the child by a parent, the court shall place a child with 
a relative of the child unless placement is not in the best interest of the child. Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 262.201(n).

PERMANENCY HEARINGS BEFORE A FINAL ORDER

When determining whether to meet a child.

The court shall consult with the child if the child is four years of age or older and if the court 
determines it is in the child’s best interest. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.302.

When determining whether to return the child to the child’s home.

At each permanency hearing before a final order, the court shall determine whether to return 
the child to the child’s parents if the child’s parents are willing and able to provide the child 
with a safe environment and the return of the child is in the child’s best interest. Tex. Fam. 
Code § 263.306(a-1)(6). But see also Tex. Fam. Code § 263.002(c).

Court Decisions that Require a Determination of
Best Interest
TRANSFERRING  A  CASE  TO  THE  COURT  OF  CONTINUING  EXCLUSIVE 
JURISDICTION (CCEJ)

The court shall order transfer to the CCEJ if the court finds the transfer is necessary for the 
convenience of the parties and is the best interest of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.203.

DENYING A PARENT VISITATION

If the court finds that visitation between a child and a parent is not in the child’s best interest, 
the court shall render an order that:

•	 States the reasons for finding that visitation is not in the child’s best interest; and
•	 Outlines specific steps the parent must take to be allowed to have visitation with the 

child. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.109(b).

WHEN CONSIDERING UNSUPERVISED VISITATION IN THE CONTEXT OF 
FAMILY VIOLENCE

It is a rebuttable presumption that it is not in the best interest of a child for a parent to have 
unsupervised visitation with a child if credible evidence is presented of a history or pattern of 
past or present child neglect or abuse or family violence by that parent or any person the parent 
permitted to have unsupervised access to the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.004(e).

13

I. Legal EssentialsEXTENDING THE DISMISSAL DATE

The  court  finds  that  extraordinary  circumstances  necessitate  the  child  remaining  in  the 
Temporary Managing Conservatorship (TMC) of DFPS and that continuing TMC is in the best 
interest of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.401(b).

ORDERING A MONITORED RETURN

The court finds that retaining jurisdiction under this section is in the best interest of the child. 
Tex. Fam. Code § 263.403(1).

DFPS Decisions that Must Consider Best Interest
WHEN CONSIDERING PLACEMENT

DFPS  shall  consider  whether  the  placement  is  in  the  child’s  best  interest.  In  determining 
whether a placement is in a child’s best interest, the Department shall consider whether the 
placement:

•	 Is the least restrictive setting for the child;
•	 Is the closest in geographic proximity to the child’s home;
•	 Is the most able to meet the identified needs of the child; and
•	 Satisfies any expressed interests of the child relating to placement, when developmentally 

appropriate. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.107(c).

WHEN ASSESSING A RELATIVE OR DESIGNATED PLACEMENT

Before placing a child with a proposed relative or other designated caregiver, the Department 
must conduct an assessment to determine whether the proposed placement is in the child’s best 
interest. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.754(b).

Factors in Determining Best Interest 
The “Holley factors” below are a non-exclusive list of factors to consider:

•	 Desires of the child;
•	 Emotional and physical danger to the child now and in the future; 
•	 Parental abilities;
•	 Programs available to assist parents;
•	 Plans for the child by individuals or agency seeking custody;
•	 Stability of home or proposed placement;
•	 Any acts or omissions of a parent indicating the relationship is not proper; and
•	 Any excuse for the acts or omissions of a parent. Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W. 2d 367 (Tex. 

1976).

Additional factors to consider in determining a child’s best interest are outlined in Tex. Fam. 
Code § 263.307 and include but are not limed to: 

•	 Child’s age and physical and mental vulnerabilities;
•	 Frequency and nature of out-of-home placements;

14

I. Legal Essentials•	 History of abusive or assaultive conduct by the child’s family or others with access to 

home;

•	 History of substance abuse by child’s family or others with access to home;
•	 Whether the perpetrator of the harm to child has been identified; and
•	 Special considerations for children 16 years of age or older. 

Relevant Case Law 
DESIRES OF CHILD

•	 The  desires  of  the  child  can  be  inferred  by  evidence  other  than  the  child’s 
testimony.  A  factfinder  may  infer  the  preferred  placement  of  a  child  too  young  to 
articulate  her  own  desire  by  assessing  the  quality  and  extent  of  the  relationships 
between  the  child  and  the  prospective  placements.  L.Z.  v.  Tex.  Dep’t  of  Family  and 
Protective  Serv.,  No.  03-12-00113-CV,  2012  WL  3629435,  at  *10  (Tex.  App.—Austin 
Aug. 23, 2012, no pet.) (mem. op.).

EMOTIONAL &PHYSICAL DANGER TO CHILD NOW & IN THE FUTURE

•	 Past conduct can be used to measure future conduct. “Evidence of past misconduct 
or neglect can be used to measure a parent’s future conduct.” Ray v. Burns, 832 S.W.2d 
431, 435 (Tex. App.—Waco 1992, no writ).

•	 Prior termination orders can be relevant in determining future danger. “The 
trial court was permitted to take as true the conduct-specific findings in these judgments 
as showing Mother had a history of abandoning and endangering her children.” “The 
court can consider evidence of prior termination as to two children in analyzing evidence 
relating to another child’s best interest.” ITIO J.M.G., 608 S.W.3d 51, 55 (Tex. App, San 
Antonio, July 1, 2020).

PARENTAL ABILITIES

•	 Past conduct can be used to measure future conduct. In reviewing the parental 
abilities of a parent, a factfinder can consider the parent’s past neglect or past inability 
to meet the physical and emotional needs of their children. D.O. v. Tex. Dep’t of Human 
Servs., 851 S.W.2d 351, 356 (Tex. App.—Austin 1993, no writ.).

•	 Conclusory  testimony  regarding  parental  abilities  is  insufficient.  Although 
caseworker “opined that termination was in child’s best interest because he needed a 
permanent  home  and  aunt  in  California  was  willing  to  adopt  him,  nothing  is  known 
about  the  aunt  or  her  home  in  California.  Therefore,  there  is  no  evidence  about  the 
aunt’s parental abilities...” ITIO R.S.D, 446 S.W.3d 816, 821 (Tex. App. - San Antonio, 
Sept. 3, 2014).

PROGRAMS AVAILABLE TO ASSIST PARENTS

•	 Parent’s initiative to pursue programs is relevant. A factfinder can infer from a 
parent’s failure to take the initiative to avail herself of the programs offered to her by 
the Department that the parent “did not have the ability to motivate herself to seek out 
available resources needed…now or in the future.” In re W.E.C., 110 S.W.3d 231, 245 
(Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2003, no pet.).

15

I. Legal EssentialsPLANS FOR CHILD BY INDIVIDUALS SEEKING CUSTODY OR AGENCY

•	 The feasibility of competing plans may be compared. A factfinder may compare 
the parent’s and the Department’s plans for the child and consider whether the plans 
and expectations of each party are realistic or weak and ill-defined. D.O. v. Tex. Dep’t of 
Human Servs., 851 S.W.2d 351, 356 (Tex. App.—Austin 1993, no writ.).

•	 Adoption subsidies should not be the basis for a best interest finding. Terminating 
a  parent’s  rights  to  his  children  so  that  someone  can  obtain  financial  subsidies  upon 
adoption is not an appropriate basis on which to base a best interest finding. ITIO of 
E.D., E.D., I.D., and J.D., 419 S.W.3d 615, 619 (Tex. App. - San Antonio Nov. 22, 2013).

STABILITY OF HOME OR PROPOSED PLACEMENT 

•	 Stability is paramount for the child. Stability and permanence are paramount in 
the  upbringing  of  children.  In  re  T.D.C.,  91  S.W.3d  865,  873  (Tex.  App.—Fort  Worth 
2002, pet. denied).

•	 Stability is a compelling government interest. The goal of establishing a stable, 
permanent home for a child is a compelling interest of the government. Hann v. Tex. 
Dep’t of Protective and Regulatory Servs., 969 S.W.2d 77, 83 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1998, 
pet. denied).

•	 Past  conduct  can  be  used  to  measure  future  stability.  Parent’s  failure  to  show 
that he is stable enough to parent a child for any prolonged period entitles the factfinder 
“to determine that this pattern would likely continue and that permanency could only 
be achieved through termination and adoption.” D.O. v. Tex. Dep’t of Human Servs., 851 
S.W.2d 351, 358 (Tex. App.—Austin 1993, no writ).

•	 Consequence  of  not  terminating  may  be  considered.  A  factfinder  may  also 
consider the consequences of its failure to terminate parental rights, and that the best 
interest of the child may be served by termination so that adoption may occur rather 
than the impermanent foster care arrangement that would result if termination were 
not obtained. In re B.S.W., No. 14-04- 00496-CV, 2004 WL 2964015, at *9 (Tex. App.—
Houston [14th Dist.] Dec. 23, 2004, no pet.) (mem. op.).

ANY ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF A PARENT INDICATING THE RELATIONSHIP 
IS NOT PROPER AND ANY EXCUSE FOR THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF A 
PARENT

•	 Parent’s acts or omissions in the not-too-distant past can show the relationship 
with the child is not a proper one. A factfinder can consider a parent’s drug use, 
frequent  incarcerations,  continued  involvement  in  an  abusive  relationship,  and 
extremely  poor  judgment  in  leaving  child  in  dangerous  and  deplorable  conditions  in 
determining  whether  the  parent-child  relationship  is  a  proper  one.  ITIO  D.M.,  452 
S.W.3d 462, 472-473 (Tex. App. - San Antonio, Nov. 24, 2014).

•	 Incarceration alone does not support finding that parent-child relationship is 
improper. Other than the fact the appellant was incarcerated at the time of trial, “no 
other evidence was offered on whether appellant’s relationship with her child was not a 
proper one.” ITIO R.S.D., 446 S.W.3d 816, 821 (Tex. App. - San Antonio, Sept. 3, 2014).
•	 Past  criminal  conviction  may  not  be  sufficient  to  support  a  finding  that  the 
parent-child  relationship  is  not  a  proper  one.  The  fact  that  a  parent  has  been 
convicted of having an improper relationship with a minor before his children were born 
without any evidence presented concerning the offense does not support a finding that 
there “is a risk of his having an inappropriate relationship with his own children.” ITIO 
E.N.C., J.A.C., S.A.L., N.A.G., and C.G.L., 384 SW3d 796, 808 (Tex. 2012).

I. Legal EssentialsEliciting Evidence Regarding Best Interest
The following are sources and topics for soliciting evidence regarding best interest at a trial or 
contested hearing.

PARENT/CONSERVATOR TESTIMONY

•	 Memories of the child’s birth or the day the child came into their life;
•	 The child’s unique role in the family;
•	 The bonds the child has with family members;
•	 The bonds the child has with the family’s community;
•	 The bonds the child has with the proposed long-term caregiver;
•	 The level of interest the parent has shown in the well-being of their child;
•	 The frequency and nature of the parent’s visits;
•	 The recent, relevant criminal history of the parent;
•	 Training/classes the parent has attended; 
•	 Parent’s demonstration (or lack thereof) of changes in behavior; 
•	 Parent’s demonstration that they have or have not addressed the issues that brought 

•	 Details regarding the parent’s level of cooperation with the Department and services; 

the child into DFPS care;

and/or

•	 Knowledge  the  parent  or  caregiver  has  gained  about  the  child’s  needs  and  how  they 

plan to meet those needs in the child’s home.

SUBSTITUTE CAREGIVER TESTIMONY

•	 Typical day with the child (meetings/appointments they attend with or for the child);
•	 Training/classes they have attended;
•	 Any special needs of child and how those needs have been met;
•	 How child was when they first entered substitute care and how they are now; and/or
•	 Future plans for child (e.g., Does the caregiver plan to stay involved with the child and 

if so, how? Is the caregiver considering adoption?).

PSYCHOLOGIST/THERAPIST TESTIMONY

•	 The number of and type of placements the child has experienced in DFPS care;
•	 The progress or lack of progress the child has made in DFPS care;
•	 Clinical research regarding the effects of removal or separation;
•	 Clinical  research  regarding  life  outcomes  of  children  who  experience  foster  care  or 

family separation;

•	 The child’s desires to remain/return home;
•	 What permanency means for this child;
•	 Behaviors of the child now and in the future; and/or
•	 Psychological effect of “closure” on the healing process

17

I. Legal EssentialsJurisdiction, Venue, and Transfer

Original Jurisdiction 
A suit brought by a governmental entity requesting an order under Tex. Fam. Code Chapter 
262 may be filed in a court with jurisdiction to hear the suit in the county in which the child is 
found. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.002.

DFPS must file a petition based on allegations of abuse or neglect arising from the same incident 
or occurrence and involving children living in the same home in the same court. Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 262.015. 

Court of Continuing, Exclusive Jurisdiction (CCEJ)
Except for voluntary or involuntary dismissal of a suit affecting the parent-child relationship 
(SACPR), a parentage suit where the final order finds that an alleged or presumed father is not 
the father, or a final order of adoption, a court acquires continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over 
the matters provided for by Tex. Fam. Code Title 5 in connection with a child on the rendition 
of a final order. Tex. Fam. Code § 155.001.

If a court of this state has acquired continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, no other court of this state 
has jurisdiction of a suit with regard to that child except as provided by Tex. Fam. Code Chapter 
155, Tex. Fam. Code § 103.001(b), or Tex. Fam. Code Chapter 262. Tex. Fam. Code § 155.001(c).

Emergency Jurisdiction
A suit brought by DFPS requesting an order under Tex. Fam. Code Chapter 262 may be filed 
in a court with jurisdiction to hear the suit in the county in which the child is found. Tex. Fam. 
Code § 262.002.

•	 “[A]s  to  emergency  and  temporary  orders,  the  Chapter  262  court  shares  jurisdiction 
with  the  Chapter  155  court  of  continuing,  exclusive  jurisdiction,  but  not  as  to  final 
orders.” In re L.S., 557 S.W.3d 736, 739 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2018, no pet.). 

If at the conclusion of the full adversary hearing the court renders a temporary order, DFPS 
shall request identification of a court of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction as provided by Tex. 
Fam. Code Chapter 155. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.202.

•	 “[O]nce the Chapter 262 court issues a temporary order after a full adversary hearing, 
then  the  Department  ‘shall  request  identification  of  a  court  of  continuing,  exclusive 
jurisdiction as provided by Chapter 155.’” In re D.W., 533 S.W.3d 460, 465 (Tex. App.—
Texarkana 2017, pet. denied) (quoting Tex. Fam. Code § 262.202 (emphasis added)).

For information related to jurisdiction when ICWA applies, please see the ICWA section of this 
tool kit. 

Venue
Venue lies in the county where the child resides; generally speaking, that county is where the 
child’s parent resides, unless:

•	 Another  court  has  continuing,  exclusive  jurisdiction  under  Tex.  Fam.  Code  Chapter 

155; or

•	 Venue is fixed in a suit for dissolution of marriage under Tex. Fam. Code Subchapter D, 

Chapter 6. Tex. Fam. Code § 103.001(a).

18

I. Legal EssentialsA child resides in the county where the child’s parents reside or the child’s parent resides, if 
only one parent is living, except that:

•	 If a guardian of the person has been appointed by order of a county or probate court and 
a managing conservator has not been appointed, the child resides in the county where 
the guardian of the person resides;

•	 If the parents of the child do not reside in the same county and if a managing conservator, 
custodian, or guardian of the person has not been appointed, the child resides in the 
county where the parent having actual care, control, and possession of the child resides;
•	 If the child is in the care and control of an adult other than a parent and a managing 
conservator,  custodian,  or  guardian  of  the  person  has  not  been  appointed,  the  child 
resides where the adult having actual care, control, and possession of the child resides;
•	 If the child is in the actual care, control, and possession of an adult other than a parent 
and the whereabouts of the parent and the guardian of the person is unknown, the child 
resides where the adult having actual possession, care, and control of the child resides;
•	 If the person whose residence would otherwise determine venue has left the child in the 

care and control of the adult, the child resides where that adult resides;

•	 If a guardian or custodian of the child has been appointed by order of a court of another 
state or country, the child resides in the county where the guardian or custodian resides 
if that person resides in this state; or

•	 If it appears that the child is not under the actual care, control, and possession of an 

adult, the child resides where the child is found. Tex. Fam. Code § 103.001(c).

Relevant Case Law 
•	 Tex. Fam. Code § 103.001 is not jurisdictional but is a venue statute that determines 
the proper county to bring a suit affecting the parent-child relationship. See Tex. Fam. 
Code § 103.001; Gutierrez v. Gutierrez, No. 05-14-00803-CV, 2016 WL 1242193, at *1 
(Tex.  App.—Dallas  Mar.  30,  2016,  no  pet.);  Kshatrya  v.  Texas  Workforce  Com’n,  97 
S.W.3d 825, 832 (Tex.App.–Dallas 2003, no pet.) (venue is not jurisdictional); see also 
Tex. Fam. Code § 103.002 (if suit brought in improper county, suit shall be transferred 
on timely motion). 

•	 The law in Texas has long been that any party to a lawsuit may expressly or impliedly 
waive  rights  conferred  upon  him  by  a  venue  statute.  Grozier  v.  L–B  Sprinkler  & 
Plumbing Repair, 744 S.W.2d 306, 309 (Tex.App.—Fort Worth 1988, writ denied).

•	 The  matter  of  venue  is  a  personal  privilege  which  may  be  waived.  See  id.;  Mooney 
Aircraft, Inc. v. Adams, 377 S.W.2d 123, 125 (Tex.Civ.App.—Dallas 1964, no writ). 

Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act 
(UCCJEA) 
The UCCJEA governs jurisdiction over child custody issues between Texas and other states. In 
re Isquierdo, 426 S.W.3d 128, 131 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2012, orig. proceeding). Tex. 
Fam. Code Chapter 152 codifies the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act 
(UCCJEA) into state law.

Except as provided in Tex. Fam. Code § 152.204, a Texas court may not modify a child custody 
determination made by a court of another state unless:

19

I. Legal Essentials•	 The  Texas  court  has  jurisdiction  to  make  an  initial  determination  under  Tex.  Fam. 

Code §152.201(a)(1)-(2); and 

•	 The court of the other state determines it no longer has exclusive continuing jurisdiction, 
or that the Texas court would be a more convenient forum, or either court determines 
that the child, the child’s parents, and any person acting as a parent do not presently 
reside in the other state. Tex. Fam. Code § 152.203. 

INITIAL CHILD CUSTODY JURISDICTION

Except as otherwise provided in Tex. Fam. Code § 152.204, a Texas court has jurisdiction to 
make an initial child-custody determination if:

•	 This state is the home state of the child on the date of the commencement of the proceeding, 
or was the home state of the child within six months before the commencement of the 
proceeding and the child is absent from this state but a parent or person acting as a 
parent continues to live in this state;

•	 A court of another state does not have jurisdiction, or a court of the home state of the 
child  has  declined  to  exercise  jurisdiction  on  the  ground  that  this  state  is  the  more 
appropriate forum under Tex. Fam. Code §§ 152.207 or 152.208, and:
o  the child and the child’s parents, or the child and at least one parent or a person 
acting  as  a  parent,  have  a  significant  connection  with  this  state  other  than  mere 
physical presence; and

o  substantial evidence is available in this state concerning the child’s care, protection, 

training, and personal relationships;

•	 All courts having jurisdiction have declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that 
a court of this state is the more appropriate forum to determine the custody of the child 
under Tex. Fam. Code §§ 152.207 or 152.208; or

•	 No court of any other state would have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in Tex. 

Fam. Code § 152.201.

HOME STATE

Home state is defined as the state in which a child lived with a parent or person acting as a 
parent  for  at  least  six  consecutive  months  immediately  before  the  commencement  of  a  child 
custody proceeding. In the case where a child is less than six months of age, the home state is 
the one in which the child lived from birth with a parent or person acting as a parent. Tex. Fam. 
Code §152.102(7).

EMERGENCY JURISDICTION UNDER THE UCCJEA

A Texas court may assume temporary jurisdiction over a custody dispute if the child is present 
in this state and it is necessary to protect a child subjected to or threatened with mistreatment 
or abuse. Tex. Fam. Code § 152.204.

Any  order  issued  under  emergency  circumstances  must  be  temporary  in  nature;  the  order 
must specify a period that the court considers adequate to obtain an order from the state with 
jurisdiction. The temporary order shall remain in effect only until proper steps are taken in the 
original forum state to adequately protect the child or until the specified period expires. Tex. 
Fam. Code § 152.204(c).

Notice is required for the exercise of jurisdiction on a person who resides out-of-state and may be 

20

I. Legal Essentialsgiven in any manner reasonably calculated to give actual notice. See Tex. Fam. Code § 152.108.

DUTY TO COMMUNICATE

A court of this state may communicate with the court in another state concerning a proceeding 
arising under Tex. Fam. Code Chapter 152. The court may allow the parties to participate in 
the communication. If the parties are unable to participate, they must be given the opportunity 
to present facts and legal arguments before a decision on jurisdiction is made. If proceedings 
involving the same parties are pending simultaneously in a Texas court and the court of another 
state, the Texas court shall inform the other court of the simultaneous proceedings and shall 
request that the other court hold the proceeding in that court in abeyance until the Texas court 
conducts  a  hearing  to  determine  whether  it  has  jurisdiction  over  the  proceeding.  Except  for 
communications between courts on schedules, calendars, court records, and similar matters, a 
record must be made of any communication under Tex. Fam. Code Section 152, and the parties 
must be informed promptly of the communication and granted access to the record. Tex. Fam. 
Code § 152.110(f).

Practice Tip: To ensure compliance with Tex. Fam. Code § 152.110(f) requirement that 
a record of communication between courts is made, attorneys representing DFPS may 
request of the judge that they announce in open court and put on the record that they 
communicated  with  the  judge  of  the  out-of-state  court  of  continuing  jurisdiction  and 
their joint decision as to which court would retain jurisdiction. 

A Texas court which has been asked to make a custody determination under Tex. Fam. Code § 
152.204 (temporary emergency jurisdiction), upon being informed that a child custody proceeding 
has been commenced in or a child custody determination has been made by a court of another 
state having jurisdiction, shall immediately communicate with the other court. If a Texas court 
is exercising emergency jurisdiction, it shall immediately communicate with a court of another 
state that has commenced a child custody proceeding or has made a child custody determination 
under a statute similar to this section to resolve the emergency, protect the safety of the parties 
and the child, and determine a period for the duration of the temporary order. Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 152.204(d).

INCONVENIENT FORUM

A Texas court which has jurisdiction under Tex. Fam. Code Chapter 152 to make a child custody 
determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction if it determines that it is an inconvenient 
forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum. 
Tex. Fam. Code § 152.207(a).

Transfer of Suit
On the motion of a party or the court’s own motion, if applicable, the court that rendered the 
temporary order shall in accordance with procedures provided by Tex. Fam. Code Chapter 155:

•	 Transfer the suit to the court of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, if the court finds that 
the transfer is necessary for the convenience of the parties and in the best interest of 
the child;

•	 Order transfer of the suit from the court of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction; or 
•	 If grounds exist for transfer based on improper venue, order transfer of the suit to the 
court having venue of the suit under Tex. Fam. Code Chapter 103. Tex. Fam. Code § 
262.203(a).

21

I. Legal EssentialsA court exercising jurisdiction under Tex. Fam. Code Chapter 262 is not required to transfer the 
suit to a court in which a parent has filed a suit for dissolution of marriage before a final order 
for the protection of the child has been rendered. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.203(c).

Note: Upon receiving notice that a court exercising emergency jurisdiction under Tex. 
Fam. Code Chapter 262 has ordered the transfer of a SAPCR under Tex. Fam. Code § 
262.203(a)(2), a CCEJ must transfer the proceedings to the court exercising jurisdiction 
under Chapter 262. Tex. Fam. Code § 155.201. 

If  the  court  exercising  jurisdiction  under  Chapter  262  orders  the  transfer  of  the  suit  to  the 
CCEJ the order of transfer must include:

•	 The date of any future hearings in the case that had been scheduled by the transferring 

•	 Any date scheduled by the transferring court for the dismissal of the suit under Tex. 

court;

Fam. Code § 263.401; and

•	 The  name  and  contact  information  of  each  attorney  ad  litem  or  guardian  ad  litem 

appointed in this suit. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.203(d).

A  temporary  order  rendered  under  Chapter  262  is  valid  and  enforceable  until  properly 
superseded by a court with jurisdiction to do so. Tex. Fam. Code §262.204.

Note: A suit in which adoption is requested may be filed in the county where the child 
resides or in the county where the petitioners reside, regardless of whether another court 
has  continuing  exclusive  jurisdiction  under  Tex.  Fam.  Code  Chapter  155.  Except  as 
provided by Tex. Fam. Code § 155.201, a court that has continuing exclusive jurisdiction 
is not required to transfer the SAPCR to the court in which the adoption suit is filed. 
Tex. Fam. Code § 103.001(b).

Relevant Case Law 
•	 In re C.G., 495 S.W.3d 40, 44–45 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2016, pet. denied) (statute is 
“‘truly jurisdictional’—that is, when one court has continuing and exclusive jurisdiction 
over a matter, any order or judgment issued by another court pertaining to the same 
matter is void.”).

•	 In re S.H., No. 13-18-00240-CV, 2018 WL 4624720, at *1, *5 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi–
Edinburg Sept. 27, 2018, no pet.) (mem. op.) (declaring void the 343rd District Court of 
Bee County’s 2017 order terminating father’s parental rights under chapter 262 when 
the 36th District Court of Bee County had continuing, exclusive jurisdiction based on 
a 2004 SAPCR under chapter 155, there was no transfer order, and the exchange-of-
benches doctrine did not apply).

•	 In  re  L.S.,  557  S.W.3d  736,  739–40  (Tex.  App.—Texarkana  2018,  no  pet.)  (holding, 
after abatement for an evidentiary hearing, that an order terminating father’s parental 
rights to L.S. by a Harrison County Court was void when a Gregg County Court still had 
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction in matters connected with L.S.).

22

I. Legal EssentialsPractice  Tip:  Unless  the  petition  alleges  that  no  court  has  CCEJ  or  that  the  court 
in which the suit or petition to modify has been filed has acquired and retains CCEJ, 
DFPS shall request the identification of the court of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction 
from  vital  statistics  as  soon  as  practicable  prior  to  the  Status  Hearing.  If  a  court  of 
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction is identified, attorneys representing DFPS should act 
quickly and file a motion and order to transfer either to the CCEJ or from the CCEJ to 
the 262 Court. The trial court cannot issue a final order in a child welfare case if another 
court has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.

23

I. Legal EssentialsPleading Practice

Pleadings 
DFPS  may  plead  multiple  grounds  for  termination  in  their  Petition  for  Protection,  for 
Conservatorship,  and  for  Termination  in  a  Suit  Affecting  the  Parent  Child  Relationship. 
However,  suits  filed  by  DFPS  are  subject  to  Tex.  R.  Civ.  P.  13,  which  prohibits  groundless 
pleadings brought in bad faith or to harass, as well as Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 10, which 
requires that each allegation or other factual contention in the pleading has evidentiary support 
or is likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation 
or discovery. Tex. Fam. Code §161.101(b). 

Practice Tip: Avoid pleading a “laundry list” of all termination grounds, and instead 
focus on pleading termination grounds which are applicable to the facts of your case and/
or which can be proved at trial. 

Practice  Tip:  Termination  grounds  such  as  constructive  abandonment  or  failure 
to  complete  the  family  plan  of  service  include  timing  and  reasonable  efforts 
components  that  are  not  likely  to  have  been  met  at  the  time  of  the  filing  of  the 
original  petition;  however,  these  grounds  may  still  be  included  in  the  petition  if  the 
grounds  are  likely  to  be  proved  at  trial.  Depending  on  your  jurisdiction,  you  may 
also  consider  including  contingent  phrasing  in  your  original  pleadings  such  as:   

The Department will seek court orders to compel Respondent to participate in services 
in order to continue to make reasonable efforts to return the child home to reunify the 
family. Respondent is hereby notified, should they not comply with those orders, that, 
after  the  requisite  time  period  has  elapsed,  the  Department  will  seek  to  terminate 
parental rights for failure to comply with the provisions of a court order that specifically 
established the actions necessary for Respondent to obtain the return of the child who 
will have been in the permanent or temporary managing conservatorship of the Texas 
Department of Family and Protective Services for not less than nine months as a result 
of  the  child  removal  from  the  parent  under  chapter  262  for  the  abuse  or  neglect  of  a 
child.” 

  “

Practice  Tip:  Depending  on  the  jurisdiction,  attorneys  representing  DFPS  might 
consider requesting Court Ordered Services strictly in the alternative in the petition for 
removal. Some courts may consider entering a finding that, while a request for temporary 
managing  conservatorship  of  a  child  should  be  denied,  the  evidence  presented  at  the 
adversary hearing supports a finding for court ordered services; however, other courts 
may not consider making such a finding unless a request for it is specifically pleaded. 

Termination Grounds Included in SAPCR
A complete list of the statutory grounds for Involuntary Termination of Parent-Child Relationship 
is  found  in  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  161.001(b)(1).  The  non-exhaustive  list  below  contains  grounds 
often pleaded in DFPS cases. 

24

I. Legal EssentialsABANDONMENT GROUNDS 

Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1)(N)

Has the parent:

•	 Constructively  abandoned  the  child  who  has  been  in  the  permanent  or  temporary 

managing conservatorship of the Department for not less than six months, and

•	 Not regularly visited or maintained significant contact with the child: and
•	 Demonstrated an inability to provide the child with a safe environment; and
•	 DFPS made reasonable efforts to return the child to the parent.

Practice Tip: Before proceeding with a request for termination based on the “N” ground 
at a termination trial, attorneys representing DFPS might consider calculating timelines 
to ensure that the child has been in the managing conservatorship of DFPS at least 6 
months. If it is pleaded and the requisite time has not elapsed by the time of the final 
hearing on the merits, amending pleadings is a best practice. 

Practice  Tip:  Attorneys  representing  DFPS  might  consider  taking  a  close  look  at 
the  parents’  opportunities  to  spend  time  with  their  child.  In  that  case,  it  is  helpful  to 
determine the frequency with which the parent could visit or have contact with the child 
and how many times the parent exercised this right. For example, if the temporary court 
orders  allow  a  parent  to  visit  the  child  twice  per  month  for  two  hours  per  visit,  that 
parent will have the opportunity to complete 48 hours of visitation over 24 visits with 
the child over a 6-month period. If the parent only attends 2 visits in that time and had 
no other contact with the child, then the contact was likely not significant. However, if 
there is an order in place denying the parent visitation, the abandonment ground may 
not apply. 

Practice  Tip:  Remember  that  contact  with  a  child  may  include  visits,  phone  calls, 
communication through video chat such as FaceTime, Zoom, or Skype, letters, or other 
mediums approved by the court. Contact may also be allowed through communication 
with  a  relative  caregiver  if  the  child  is  too  young  to  participate  in  visits.  If  there  are 
barriers preventing a parent from visiting or contacting their child as scheduled, such as 
transportation or internet issues, caseworkers should make reasonable efforts to assist 
the parent with maintaining contact with their child.

ENDANGERMENT GROUNDS: CONDITIONS OR SURROUNDINGS

Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1)(D).

Has the parent:

•	 Knowingly placed the child or knowingly allowed the child to remain in conditions or 

surroundings which endangers the physical or emotional well-being of the child.

25

I. Legal EssentialsENDANGERMENT GROUNDS: COURSE OF CONDUCT 

Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1)(E).

Has the parent:

•	 Engaged in conduct or knowingly placed the child with persons who engaged in conduct 

which endangers the physical or emotional well-being of the child.

AFFIDAVIT OF RELINQUISHMENT OF PARENTAL RIGHTS

Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1)(K).

Has the parent:

•	 Executed  before  or  after  the  suit  is  filed  an  unrevoked  or  irrevocable  affidavit  of 

relinquishment of parental rights.

Note: When a parent executes an affidavit of voluntary relinquishment, Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 161.1031 also requires the parent to complete a medical history report. If an “Indian 
child” is involved, the standard relinquishment form is not valid. Please see additional 
information in the ICWA section in this tool kit.

CRIMINAL CONVICTION-DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY 

Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1)(L).

Has  the  parent  been  convicted  or  been  placed  on  community  supervision,  including  deferred 
adjudication community supervision:

•	 For being criminally responsible for the death or serious injury of a child, under any of 
the following crimes: murder; capital murder; manslaughter; indecency w/ child; assault; 
sexual assault; aggravated assault; aggravated sexual assault; injury to child, an elderly 
individual, or disabled individual; abandoning or endangering child; prohibited sexual 
conduct; sexual performance by child; possession or promotion of child pornography. 

Note: the ground also applies to out of state convictions for crimes with elements similar 
to those listed above. 

Practice Tip: The most straightforward way to prove conviction of a crime is to use a 
certified copy of the judgment. It is also helpful to get a certified copy of the indictment. 
Request the certified copies of the documents early in the case to ensure the documents 
are available in time for your use at trial and to comply with discovery orders in the case. 

PRIOR TERMINATION ON ENDANGERMENT GROUNDS 

Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1)(M).

Has the parent:

•	 Had  his  or  her  parent-child  relationship  terminated  with  respect  to  another  child 
based  on  a  finding  that  the  parent’s  conduct  was  in  violation  of  ground  (D)  or  (E)  or 
substantially equivalent provisions of the law of another state.

26

I. Legal EssentialsNote: The court may not order termination under this ground unless the petition was 
filed within one year of DFPS being named managing conservator of a child in a prior 
case against the parent which resulted in the termination of that parent’s rights.  Tex. 
Fam. Code § 161.001(d-1).

Practice  Tip:  When  requesting  a  termination  of  parental  rights  based  on  a  prior 
termination  on  endangerment  grounds,  the  most  straightforward  way  to  prove  the 
prior termination is to use a certified copy of the final order terminating parental rights 
pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1)(D) or (E) or equivalent grounds in another 
state.  Request  the  certified  copy  of  the  document  early  in  the  case,  especially  if  the 
termination occurred in another jurisdiction, to ensure the document is available in time 
for use at trial and to comply with any discovery orders in the case.

FAILURE TO COMPLETE SERVICES 

Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1)(O).

Has the parent failed to comply with:

•	 Provisions  of  court  order  that  specifically  established  the  actions  necessary  for  the 

parent to obtain the return of the child,

•	 Who  has  been  in  the  Permanent  Managing  Conservatorship  (PMC)  or  Temporary 

Managing Conservatorship (TMC) of DFPS for not less than nine months,

•	 As a result of the child’s removal for the abuse or neglect of the child.

Note: A court may not order termination under (O) based on the failure by the parent to 
comply with a specific provision of a court order if a parent proves by a preponderance 
of evidence that the parent was unable to comply with specific provisions of the court 
order and the parent made a good faith effort to comply with the order and the failure 
to comply with the order is not attributable to any fault of the parent. Tex. Fam. Code § 
161.001(d).

Practice  Tip:  Attorneys  representing  DFPS  might  consider  calculating  timelines  to 
ensure the child has been in the managing conservatorship of DFPS at least nine months 
before proceeding on a request for termination of parental rights based on the “O” ground. 
If it is pled and the requisite time has not elapsed by the final hearing on the merits, it 
is best practice for attorneys representing DFPS to amend their pleadings.

27

I. Legal EssentialsPractice  Tip:  At  final  trial,  attorneys  representing  DPFS  must  prove  by  clear  and 
convincing  evidence  that  the  child’s  initial  removal  was  due  to  abuse  and/or  neglect. 
A  finding  that  abuse  and/or  neglect  occurred  is  a  fact-intensive  issue.  Merely  offering 
the order granting TMC to the Department into evidence may not be sufficient to prove 
those findings because the Temporary Orders issued at end of the Adversary Hearing 
were rendered under a preponderance of the evidence standard. Additionally, a parent’s 
agreement  to  grant  TMC  to  DFPS  at  the  Adversary  Hearing  may  not  be  used  as  an 
admission  of  abuse  and/or  neglect  of  a  child  by  the  parent.  Instead,  consider  eliciting 
testimony from the CPI caseworker, law enforcement, and any other witness that may 
support a finding by clear and convincing evidence that the child’s removal from their 
home was due to the abuse and/or neglect of the child.

Practice Tip: Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1)(O) refers to the Family Plan of Service 
that became an order of the Court. Attorneys representing DFPS seeking termination 
should  elicit  testimony  about  the  specific  services  ordered  as  to  each  parent,  how  the 
service plan was narrowly tailored to meet the dangers that brought the child into care, 
that it was made an order of the court, and that it was designed to provide the parents 
with knowledge and tools that, if used and demonstrated, would allow for reunification. 
Additional  supportive  testimony  could  bring  forward  any  changes  to  the  service  plan 
throughout the life of the case, changes of service providers, and any assistance offered 
by the caseworker to each parent such as transportation or provision of provider services 
through electronic means such as Zoom to meet the needs of each parent. 

DRUG TREATMENT AND/OR RELAPSE 

Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1)(P).

Has the parent:

•	 Used  a  controlled  substance,  as  defined  by  Tex.  Health  &  Safety  Code  Ch.  481,  in  a 

manner that endangered the health or safety of the child, and

•	 Failed to complete a court ordered substance abuse treatment program, or
•	 After completion of a court ordered substance abuse treatment program, continued to 

abuse a controlled substance.

INCARCERATION AND INABILITY TO CARE

Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1)(Q).

Has the parent:

•	 Knowingly engaged in criminal conduct that has resulted in the parent’s:
•	 Conviction of an offense, and
•	 Confinement or imprisonment, and
•	 Inability  to  care  for  the  child  for  not  less  than  two  years  from  the  date  of  filing  the 

petition.

Note: The confinement or imprisonment for not less than two years is prospective from 
the date of the filing of the petition rather than retrospective. In re A.V., 113 S.W.3d 355 
(Tex. 2003).

28

I. Legal EssentialsBORN ADDICTED

Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1)(R).

Has the parent:

•	 Been  the  cause  of  the  child  being  born  addicted  to  alcohol  or  a  controlled  substance, 

other than a controlled substance legally obtained by prescription.

See definition of “born addicted,” Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(a).

Relevant Case Law 
•	 In re L.G.R., 498 S.W.3d 195, 202–03 (Tex. App.–Houston [14th Dist.] 2016, pet. denied) 
(holding that observable signs of withdrawal were not required to support termination 
of  rights  where  mother  admitted  marijuana  use  during  pregnancy  and  the  child’s 
meconium tested positive).

•	 In re D.D.G., 423 S.W.3d 468, 474–75 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2014, no pet.) (holding 
that mother’s admission of methamphetamine use during pregnancy and child testing 
positive  at  birth  was  sufficient  to  support  termination  of  rights  and  that  no  expert 
testimony was required to establish the level of drugs in the child’s system).

•	 In re M.N.O., No. 09–02–070 CV, 2002 WL 31835026, at *2 (Tex. App.–Beaumont Dec. 
19, 2002, no pet.) (not designated for publication) (upholding termination of mother’s 
parental  rights  to  all  three  of  her  children  on  ground  that  she  was  the  cause  of  her 
youngest child being born addicted to cocaine and stating that medical records indicating 
youngest child tested positive for cocaine at birth were legally and factually sufficient 
evidence to support the trial court’s finding under section 161.001(1)(R)).

•	 In re R.S.O.C., No. 02–11–00337–CV, 2012 WL 2923289, at *5 (Tex. App.–Fort Worth 
July 19, 2012, no pet.) (mem. op.) (upholding termination of mother’s parental rights to 
her three children after mother testified to using cocaine prior to youngest child’s birth 
and youngest child’s medical records indicated child tested positive for cocaine at birth).

TERMINATION OF RIGHTS OF ALLEGED BIOLOGICAL FATHER

Tex. Fam. Code § 161.002.

If an alleged father has been served with citation, his rights can be terminated if he does not 
timely  file  an  admission  of  paternity  or  a  counterclaim  for  paternity  under  Tex.  Fam.  Code 
Chapter 160. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.002 (b)(1).

An alleged father’s rights can be terminated without personal service of citation or citation by 
publication if:

•	 The child is over one year of age at the time the petition was filed, and the alleged father 
has failed to register with the paternity registry, and after the exercise of due diligence 
by the petitioner:
o  his identity and location are unknown, or 
o  his identity is known, but he cannot be located; Tex. Fam. Code § 161.002 (b)(2).
•	 The child is under one year of age at the time the petition was filed, and the alleged 
father has not registered with the paternity registry. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.002 (b)(3).

29

I. Legal EssentialsPetitioner’s  due  diligence  to  locate  and  identify  the  alleged  father  is  required  for  the  above 
sections including obtaining a certificate of the results of the paternity registry search from the 
Texas  Department  of  State  Health  Services  Vital  Statistics  Unit  indicating  that  no  man  has 
registered intent to claim paternity. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.002(e).

If  an  alleged  father  has  registered  with  the  paternity  registry,  citation  by  publication  is  not 
required,  but  DFPS  must  still  exercise  due  diligence  to  locate  the  alleged  father,  including 
a sworn affidavit describing their efforts to obtain personal service of citation at the address 
provided to the registry and any other address known to DFPS. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.002(b)(4). 
The court must enter specific findings regarding the exercise of due diligence by DFPS when 
rendering an order terminating parental rights under this section. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.002(f). 

Practice Tip: Before the court can render an order terminating parental rights of an 
alleged  father  who  has  failed  to  register  with  the  paternity  registry,  the  court  must 
receive evidence of a certificate of the results from the Texas Department of State Health 
Services  Vital  Statistics  Unit  indicating  that  no  man  has  registered  intent  to  claim 
paternity. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.002 (e).

Note: An alleged father who failed to register with the registry under Chapter 160 and 
whose identity or location is unknown or who registered with the paternity registry but 
who DFPS has been unable to personally serve at the address provided to the registry 
and at any other address known by DFPS is entitled to a mandatory appointment of an 
attorney. Tex. Fam. Code § 107.013(a)(3) & (4).

Special Issues
“BABY MOSES”

Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1)(S). 

The Safe Haven law, also known as the Baby Moses law, gives parents who are unable to care 
for their child a safe and legal choice to leave their infant with an employee at a designated safe 
place: a hospital, fire station, free-standing emergency center, or emergency medical services 
(EMS) station. 

Has the parent:

•	 Voluntarily delivered the child to a designated emergency infant care provider under 

Tex. Fam. Code § 262.302 without expressing an intent to return for the child.

INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION: INABILITY TO CARE FOR CHILD

Tex. Fam. Code § 161.003.

The court must find that:

•	 The parent has a mental or emotional illness, or mental deficiency that renders parent 

unable to provide for physical, emotional, and mental needs of the child;

•	 The illness or deficiency will probably continue to render parent unable to provide for 

child’s needs until child’s 18th birthday;

•	 DFPS has been temporary managing conservator or sole managing conservator of the 

child for at least six months prior to the termination hearing;

30

I. Legal Essentials•	 DFPS made reasonable efforts to return the child to the parent; and
•	 Termination is in the best interest of the child.

Note: If the petition alleges that parental rights should be terminated due to a parent’s 
inability to care for the child, the court must appoint an attorney ad litem to represent 
the  interests  of  the  parent  against  whom  the  suit  is  brought,  and  a  hearing  on  the 
termination of parental rights may not be held earlier than 180 days after the date on 
which the suit was filed. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.003(b)-(c). 

Practice Tip: While a parent is entitled to the appointment of an attorney ad litem to 
represent their interests under Tex. Fam. Code § 161.003, the appointment of a guardian 
ad litem for the parent can only be ordered by a probate court. DFPS should not request 
the appointment of a guardian ad litem for a parent, even if there are concerns about 
the parent’s capacity. The referral of the proceeding to the proper court for guardianship 
proceedings  must  come  from  the  attorney  ad  litem  for  the  parent,  at  the  direction  of 
their client’s expressed objectives of representation and if appropriate. Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 107.010.

ICWA

If  a  child  is  identified  as  an  “Indian  child,”  specific  pleadings,  notices,  burdens  of  proof,  and 
findings are required. Please see the ICWA section in this tool kit.

FILING A REQUEST TO NONSUIT

DFPS  cannot  nonsuit  a  suit  to  terminate  parental  rights  without  court  approval.  Tex.  Fam. 
Code § 161.203.

31

I. Legal EssentialsService of Citation and Notice

Service of Citation
“Service”  is  the  process  of  documenting  that  a  party  has  been  provided  notice  of  an  event  or 
documents. Service of citation gives legal notice to parties that a suit has been filed. In lawsuits 
filed by DFPS, the agency is responsible for obtaining service of citation containing the original 
petition  and  providing  notice  of  trial  settings  and  other  events  during  the  pendency  of  the 
legal  case.  Citation  on  the  filing  of  an  original  petition  in  a  Suit  Affecting  the  Parent-Child 
Relationship  (SAPCR)  must  be  issued  and  served  as  in  other  civil  cases.  Tex.  Fam.  Code  § 
102.009(c).  However,  in  a  suit  filed  under  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  262.101  (Filing  Petition  Before 
Taking Possession of Child) or Tex. Fam. Code § 262.105 (Filing Petition After Taking Possession 
of Child in Emergency), a court may proceed with temporary orders prior to any required service 
by publication. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201(o).

PARTIES TO BE SERVED

DFPS is responsible for obtaining service of citation on the following parties: 

•	 Each parent (including an alleged father), unless the parent’s rights are terminated, or 

a parent signs a waiver of service; 

•	 A  managing  or  possessory  conservator,  guardian,  or  other  person  with  court  ordered 

•	 A prospective adoptive parent with standing or a conservator designated in an affidavit 

access to the child; 

of relinquishment; and 

•	 The Texas Attorney General’s Office or any other child-support agency (if child support 
payments may be affected). Tex. Fam. Code § 102.009(a); CPS Policy Handbook § 5230.

Citation  may  be  served  on  any  other  person  who  has  or  who  may  assert  an  interest  in  the 
child. Tex. Fam. Code § 102.009(b). 

Service must be accomplished via the method prescribed in Tex. R. Civ. P. 106 and by a person 
authorized pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 103. 

Waiver of Citation
Tex. Fam. Code § 102.0091 allows for waiver of citation. The party executing the waiver may not 
sign the waiver using a digital signature, Tex. Fam. Code § 102.0091(b), and the waiver must 
contain the mailing address of the party executing the waiver. Tex. Fam. Code § 102.0091(c). 

Notwithstanding  Tex.  Civ.  Prac.  &  Rem.  Code  §  132.001,  the  waiver  must  be  sworn  before 
a  notary  public  who  is  not  an  attorney  in  the  suit,  unless  the  party  executing  the  waiver  is 
incarcerated. Tex. Fam. Code § 102.0091(d). The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply to 
a waiver executed under Tex. Fam. Code § 102.0091. Tex. Fam. Code § 102.0091(e). 

32

I. Legal EssentialsAppearance 
A party may enter an appearance in open court: 

•	 In person, 
•	 By attorney, or 
•	 By a duly authorized agent. 

This appearance must be noted on the court’s docket and entered on record and has the same 
force and effect as if the party had been served with citation. Tex. R. Civ. P. 120. The filing of 
an answer also constitutes an appearance of a party and dispenses with the necessity for the 
issuance or service of citation on the party. Tex. R. Civ. P. 121.

A party wishing to object to the jurisdiction of the court over their person may make a special 
appearance either in person or by attorney for the limited purpose of contesting jurisdiction. 
Tex. R. Civ. P. 120a. 

Alternative Service under Tex. R. Civ. P. 106(b)
When DFPS has attempted to personally serve citation on a parent or other party under Tex. 
R. Civ. P. 106(a) and that service has been unsuccessful, DFPS can seek authorization from the 
court for an alternative method of service as detailed in Tex. R. Civ. P. 106(b). This requires the 
submission of a motion supported by a sworn affidavit listing any location where the party can 
probably be found and stating that service has been unsuccessfully attempted at that location. 

Upon presentation of this motion, the court may authorize service by leaving a copy of the citation 
and of the petition with anyone older than sixteen at the location specified in the statement or 
in any other manner, including electronically by social media, email or other technology, that 
the statement shows will be reasonably effective to give the party notice of the suit.

Service of Process in a Foreign Country
The  method  of  service  to  be  used  when  a  parent  is  found  to  be  living  in  a  foreign  country  is 
detailed in Tex. R. Civ. P. Rule 108a. There are several alternative methods listed including as 
provided by Tex. R. Civ. P. 106(a), and pursuant to the terms and provisions of any applicable 
international agreement. 

If  a  parent  is  located  in  country  that  is  a  party  to  the  Hague  Service  Convention,  the  only 
methods  of  service  permitted  are  those  specified  by  the  Convention.  Mexico  and  Canada  are 
signatories to the Hague Service Convention. For a complete list of countries that are parties 
to  the  Hague  Service  Convention,  visit  the  Hague  Conference  on  Private  International  Law 
website.

Practice Tip: Service by mail is not prohibited under the Hague Service Convention, 
but members to the Hauge Service Convention may register an objection to service by 
mail, and the country of Mexico has done so. As a result, a person in Mexico must be 
served through the Mexican Central Authority. For a list of Hague members, please visit 
the Hague Conference on Private International Law Authorities Member List. For more 
information, please see the Foreign Consul section of this tool kit.

DFPS will initiate international service of process for a parent living in a country which is a 

33

I. Legal Essentialsparty to the Hague Service Convention whose identity and location are known. The following 
steps should be taken prior to requesting international service: 

•	 Obtain  an  apostille  (even  though  not  specifically  required),  through  the  office  of  the 
Texas  Secretary  of  State.  An  apostille  certifies  the  authenticity  of  the  signature,  the 
capacity  in  which  the  person  signing  the  document  has  acted  and  identifies  the  seal/
stamp which the document bears. 

•	 Request translation of the citation, petition, affidavit, and apostille that will be served 

on the parent.

•	 The DFPS worker must submit a request for Health and Human Services Commission 

(HHSC) translation services through Form F-501-401.

•	 Once  all  documentation  has  been  secured,  DFPS  will  send  it  to  their  contracted 

international service provider to initiate the service process. 

Practice Tip: International service of process can take several months and should be 
initiated  as  soon  as  an  address  is  located  for  the  parent.  For  more  information  about 
legal service requirements in a specific foreign country, please visit the U.S. Department 
of State Bureau of Consular Affairs Service of Process webpage. 

For parents located in a country not subject to the Hague Service Convention, service should be 
as specified:

•	 By the law of the country where service is to occur; 
•	 As directed by the foreign authority;
•	 As provided by Tex. R. Civ. Pro.106; 
•	 Pursuant to a treaty; 
•	 By  consular  officials  when  authorized  by  U.S.  Department  of  state  or  by  any  other 

means not prohibited by the country in question. 

Practice  Tip:  As  with  all  service,  the  method  used  must  be  reasonably  calculated  to 
give actual notice in time for the respondent to answer and respond. Tex. R. Civ. P. 108a. 

Practice Tip: A parent in a foreign country can execute a waiver of service if the parent 
is  willing  to  sign  one.  The  waiver  of  service  must  be  translated  to  the  parent’s  native 
language, and unless the parent is incarcerated in a foreign country, the waiver must 
be  signed  by  a  notary  public.  Please  note  that  the  fee  for  a  notary  public  in  a  foreign 
country can be costly and, therefore, not an option for some parents. It is worth asking 
the consulate or the U.S. embassy if they provide notary services for a minimal fee and 
informing the parent and/or their attorney of this option.   

34

I. Legal EssentialsDiligent Efforts to Locate Missing Parties and Relatives
DFPS  MUST  MAKE  A  DILIGENT  EFFORT  TO  LOCATE  PARENT  AND 
RELATIVES 

If a parent of the child (as defined by Tex. Fam. Code § 160.102(11)) has not been personally 
served in a suit in which DFPS seeks termination, DFPS must make a diligent effort to locate 
that parent. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.107(b).  

If a parent has not been personally served and cannot be located, DFPS shall make a diligent 
effort to locate a relative of the missing parent to give the relative an opportunity to request 
appointment as the child’s managing conservator. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.107(c).

If a missing parent is believed to be living in a foreign country, DFPS must ask family members 
in the United States for contact information, contact the consulate of that country, and request 
assistance in locating the parent. If a missing parent is believed to be living in Mexico, DFPS 
must follow policies outlined in the CPS Policy Handbook § 5233.33. 

“RELATIVE” DEFINED FOR DILIGENT SEARCH PURPOSES 

A relative means a parent, grandparent, adult sibling, or child. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.107(a)
(2).  If  DFPS  is  not  able  to  locate  a  missing  parent  or  a  relative  of  that  parent  and  sufficient 
information is available concerning the physical whereabouts of the parent or relative, DFPS 
must  request  the  Texas  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  to  use  the  parental  locater  service  to 
determine the location of the missing parent or relative. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.107(d). 

DFPS  is  also  required  to  provide  evidence  to  the  court  to  show  what  actions  were  taken  in 
making a diligent effort to locate the missing parent and relative of the missing parent. Tex. 
Fam. Code § 161.107(e). 

CITATION BY PUBLICATION AND DILIGENT SEARCH 

If  DFPS  has  made  the  effort  but  has  been  unsuccessful  in  obtaining  personal  service  on  a 
known parent, DFPS may file a motion and accompanying sworn affidavit of due diligence in 
support of their request for citation by publication under Tex. R. Civ. P. 109.  Before granting 
any judgment on a request for such service, the court must inquire into the sufficiency of the 
diligence exercised in attempting locate the parent.

Tex.  R.  Civ.  P.  109a  can  be  used  whenever  citation  by  publication  is  authorized.  In  these 
circumstances, the court may, on a motion, prescribe a different method of substituted service if 
the court finds, and so recites in its order, that the alternative method is as likely as publication 
to give the respondent actual notice. These rules do not limit the methods available to the court. 
Examples of appropriate methods under this section include citation by posting at the courthouse 
door, posting the citation at the home of a relative with whom the parent has contact, citation 
by electronic methods such as social media, email or other technology, or by using the newly 
developed Office of Court Administration’s Citation by Publication and Court Notices Website. 

Authorization  by  the  court  of  substituted  service  under  Tex.  R.  Civ.  P.  109  or  109a  does  not 
relieve DFPS of its duty to continue to make diligent efforts to locate the parent.

I. Legal EssentialsPractice Tip: As of July 1, 2020, the Office of Court Administration’s Public Information 
website is available for posting citations and other public or legal notice required to be 
posted  on  the  website  or  requested  to  be  posted  by  a  court  or  court  clerk.  For  more 
information, visit the Citation by Publication and Court Notices website.

Notice 
“Notice” is the process of providing informing relevant parties and individuals that an event has 
occurred or will occur in a matter. DFPS is responsible for providing service of citation and notice 
of several matters relating to agency activities relating to a lawsuit (investigations, removals, 
review hearings, etc.). While the same word “notice” is often used for both, it is important to 
distinguish  between  service  and  notice.  The  Texas  Family  Code  requires  that  DFPS  provide 
notice  to  parents  of  the  investigation  and  removal  of  a  child,  as  well  as  notice  of  all  review 
hearings to relatives of the removal, and notice to parties, relatives, caregivers, and to the child 
if the child is age 10 or older. However, these notice obligations do not need to be executed solely 
in accordance with the rules governing service under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Tex. 
Fam. Code § 263.0021 provides several methods of notice available to DFPS. 

Practice Tip: Service of citation is required upon the filing of an original petition to give 
named parties notice of the suit. DFPS should consider including notice of any upcoming 
scheduled  hearings  (such  as  the  court  ordered  services  hearing  or  adversary  hearing) 
with the citation to ensure compliance with the requirement that all persons entitled be 
given 10 days’ notice of a hearing. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.0021(b). 

Note:  Notice  of  a  hearing  may  also  be  given  in  a  temporary  order  following  a  full 
adversary  hearing,  in  an  order  following  a  hearing  under  Tex.  Fam.  Code  Ch.  263, 
in open court, or in any manner that would provide actual notice to a person entitled 
to  notice.  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  263.0021(c).  It  is  best  practice  for  DFPS  to  notify  those 
entitled to notice of each upcoming hearing and keep a record of the methods in which 
notification was made. 

THE RIGHT TO NOTICE 

The Petitioner, which is usually DFPS, must ensure that notice of the lawsuit is provided to 
those who are sued.  

METHODS OF PROVIDING NOTICE OF HEARING 

The requirements for citation are different from requirements for notice of motions or of particular 
hearings. Citation generally must be by personal service on the Respondent unless citation is 
waived by the Respondent, forfeited under the “paternity registry” process, or given by some 
form of substituted service, including citation by publication, as authorized by the Texas Rules 
of Civil Procedure.  

Once citation is complete and a return of service is on file, notice may be served by:

•	 Delivering  a  copy  to  the  party  to  be  served,  or  the  party’s  duly  authorized  agent  or 

attorney of record;

•	 Electronically through the electronic filing manager if the email address of the party or 

attorney to be served is on file with the electronic filing manager; or

36

I. Legal Essentials•	 In person, by mail, by commercial delivery service, by fax, by email, or by such other 

manner as the court in its discretion may direct. 

Service by mail shall be complete upon deposit of the paper, enclosed in a postpaid, properly 
addressed  wrapper,  in  a  post  office  or  official  depository  under  the  care  and  custody  of  the 
United States Postal Service. Service by telephonic document transfer after 5:00 p.m. local time 
of the recipient shall be deemed served on the following day. Notice may also be served by a 
party to the suit, an attorney of record, a sheriff or constable, or by any other person competent 
to testify. Tex. R. Civ. P. 21a. 

INFORMATION PROVIDED TO RELATIVES AND CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS 

When DFPS takes possession of a child under Tex. Fam. Code Chapter 262, DFPS must provide 
information to each adult DFPS is able to identify and locate who: 

•	 Is  related  to  the  child  within  the  fourth  degree  of  consanguinity,  as  defined  by  Tex. 

Gov’t Code § 573.023(c);

•	 Is an adult relative of the alleged father if DFPS has a reasonable basis to believe the 

alleged father is the child’s biological father; and 

•	 Is  identified  as  a  potential  relative  or  designated  caregiver  on  the  proposed  Child 

Placement Resources Form. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.1095(a)(1). 

DFPS may provide information to each adult who DFPS is able to identify and locate who has a 
long-standing and significant relationship with the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.1095(a)(2).

Tex. Fam. Code § 262.1095(b) requires the written notice to include: 

•	 A statement that the child is in the state’s custody; 
•	 Options available for participation in the care and placement and support of the family; 
•	 Options that may be lost if the individual fails to timely respond; and 
•	 The date, time, and location of the status hearing, if applicable;
•	 Information regarding the procedures and timeline for a suit affecting the parent-child 

relationship.  

DFPS is not required to provide information to a person who has criminal or family violence 
history. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.1095(c). 

DFPS must use due diligence to identify and locate all individuals described by Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 262.1095(a) within 30 days of the date DFPS files the SAPCR, and the failure of a parent or 
alleged father to complete the Child Placement Resources Form does not relieve DFPS of its 
duty to seek information about persons under Tex. Fam. Code § 262.1095(d). Tex. Fam. Code § 
262.1095(d)-(e). 

REPORT REGARDING NOTIFICATION OF RELATIVES 

DFPS is required to provide the court with a report regarding their compliance with Tex. Fam. 
Code § 262.1095. The court should review this report to assess DFPS’ diligent efforts. Tex. Fam. 
Code § 263.007. 

Notice to Parents of Right to Counsel 

Before  commencement  of  the  full  adversary  hearing,  if  an  attorney  has  not  already  been 
appointed under Tex. Fam. Code § 107.013, the court must inform each parent not represented 

37

I. Legal Essentialsby an attorney of: 

•	 The right to be represented by an attorney; and 
•	 If a parent is indigent and appears in opposition to the suit, the right to a court-appointed 

attorney. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201(c). 

Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  107.0141  allows  the  court  to  appoint  an  attorney  for  a  parent  whenever 
the SAPCR is filed. However, if no appointment has been made prior to the Adversary Hearing 
and  a  parent  claims  indigence  and  requests  the  appointment  of  an  attorney,  the  court  must 
make a determination of indigence before commencement of the full adversary hearing, and, 
if  the  court  determines  the  parent  is  indigent,  it  must  appoint  an  attorney  to  represent  the 
parent. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201(d). 

For  good  cause  shown,  the  court  may  postpone  the  full  adversary  hearing  and  extend  any 
temporary orders in place for up to seven days from the date of the appointment to provide the 
attorney time to respond to the petition and prepare for the hearing or up to seven days from 
the date of the appearance of a parent who is not indigent to hire an attorney or to provide the 
parent’s attorney time to respond to the petition and prepare for the hearing. Tex. Fam. Code 
§262.201(e)-(e-1). 

Practice Tip: Consider requesting the temporary appointment of an attorney ad litem 
for each respondent parent when filing your original SAPCR petition under Tex. Fam. 
Code § 262.101 and Tex. Fam. Code § 262.105. The appointment of an attorney at the 
onset  of  the  case  allows  time  for  the  attorneys  to  prepare  with  their  clients  prior  to 
the initial adversary hearing and could facilitate an agreement or limit the number of 
contested issues before the court at the adversary hearing. In addition, the appointment 
of  an  attorney  for  a  parent  prior  to  the  adversary  hearing  will  reduce  the  number  of 
hearing resets and, when possible, will avoid any undue delays in reunifying families.  

FOREIGN CONSUL 

When  DFPS  takes  possession  of  a  child  who  was  born  in  another  country  who  is  not  a  U.S. 
citizen, DFPS must notice the foreign consul of the country of which the child is a citizen.

To notify a foreign consulate that DFPS has removed a child, the caseworker must:  

•	 Complete Form 2650, Letter to Foreign Consulates;  
•	 Send the completed form to the designated consulate by mail, return receipt requested, 

or by fax and include the confirmation notice when filing it with the court; and  

•	 Send a copy of the notice to the attorney representing DFPS. 

Caseworkers should contact the DFPS Immigration Specialist in their DFPS region for consular 
office contact information. For more information about working with a Foreign Consulate and 
providing a Foreign Consulate with notice, see CPS Policy Handbook § 6715.

I. Legal EssentialsInterventions

Intervenors in a child welfare cases tend to be either a family member or foster parent seeking 
to be named the managing conservator of the child. In order for a non-parent to intervene in a 
child welfare case, the person must have standing. 

There are two avenues for a non-parent to establish standing in a Suit Affecting the Parent-
Child Relationship (SAPCR):

•	 Standing to file an original suit. Tex. Fam. Code § 102.003.
•	 Standing to intervene in a pending suit. Tex. Fam. Code § 102.004(b).

Practice Tip: Intervening parties, absent a Motion to Strike, are immediately granted 
the status of a party and can participate in discovery, in hearings and mediations, and 
receive court reports and other filings with the court. Tex. R. Civ. P. 60. When a Petition 
in  Intervention  is  filed,  it  is  important  to  check  whether  the  intervenor  has  proper 
standing to file. If the intervenor lacks standing, consider filing a Motion to Strike the 
Petition in Intervention. 

Standing to File an Original Suit
Tex. Fam. Code § 102.003 provides a list of individuals who may file an original suit at any time.

In  computing  the  time  necessary  for  standing  under  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  102.003(a)(9),  (a)(11) 
and  (a)(12),  the  court  may  not  require  that  the  time  be  continuous  and  uninterrupted  but 
shall  consider  the  child’s  principal  residence  during  the  relevant  time  preceding  the  date  of 
commencement of the suit. Tex. Fam. Code § 102.003(b).

Notwithstanding the time requirements of Tex. Fam. Code § 102.003(a)(12), a person who is the 
foster parent of a child may file a suit to adopt a child for whom the person is providing foster 
care at any time after the person has been approved to adopt the child. The standing to file suit 
under Tex. Fam. Code § 102.003(a)(12) applies only to the adoption of a child who is eligible to 
be adopted. Tex. Fam. Code § 102.003(c).

ACTUAL CARE, CONTROL, AND POSSESSION

Tex. Fam. Code § 102.003(a)(9) provides standing to a person, other than a foster parent, who 
has had actual care, control, and possession of the child for at least six months ending not more 
than 90 days preceding the date of the filing of the petition.

Relevant Case Law 
TIME-SPECIFIC APPLICABILITY

•	 Standing not found when child in home for only five and a half months at time of filing. 
(In the Interest of E.C., No. 02-13-00413-CV, Tex. App. LEXIS 10199 (Tex. App. – Fort 
Worth [2nd District] September 11, 2014)). 

•	 Standing not found when child in home for only three months at time of filing. (In the 
Interest  of  C.M.J.,  No.  02-12-00036-CV  (Tex.  App.  –  Fort  Worth,  December  2012,  no 
pet.)).

ELEMENTS OF “ACTUAL CARE, CONTROL, AND POSSESSION”

•	 An individual asserting standing under Tex. Fam. Code § 102.003(a)(9) must have:

39

I. Legal Essentialso  lived in a home where the child consistently and frequently stayed overnight;
o  financially supported the child;
o  participated in the child’s education; and
o  fed, clothed, and provided health care to the child. 

•	 “Actual control” does not require the authority to make legal decisions for the child. See 
Jasek v. Tex. Dep’t of Family and Protective Servs, 348 S.W.3d 523 (Tex.App.—Austin 
August 17, 2011, no pet.).

Note: A non-parent’s “actual care, control, and possession” of a child does not need to be 
exclusive to have standing under Tex. Fam. Code § 102.003(a)(9). In the Interest of H.S., 
550 S.W.3d 151 (Tex. 2018).

STANDING TO REQUEST TERMINATION AND ADOPTION

An original suit requesting only an adoption or for termination of the parent-child relationship 
joined with a petition for adoption may be filed by:

•	 A stepparent of the child;
•	 An adult who, as the result of a placement for adoption, has had actual possession and 
control  of  the  child  at  any  time  during  the  30-day  period  preceding  the  filing  of  the 
petition; 

•	 An adult who has had actual possession and control of the child for not less than two 

months during the three-month period preceding the filing of the petition;

•	 An  adult  who  has  adopted,  or  is  the  foster  parent  of  and  has  petitioned  to  adopt,  a 

sibling of the child; or

•	 Another adult whom the court determines to have had substantial past contact with the 

child sufficient to warrant standing to do so. Tex. Fam. Code § 102.005.

Grandparent Interventions
In  addition  to  the  general  standing  to  file  suit  provided  by  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  102.003,  a 
grandparent or other relative of the child related within the third degree of consanguinity may 
file an original suit requesting managing conservatorship if there is satisfactory proof that:

•	 The  order  requested  is  necessary  because  the  child’s  present  circumstances  would 

significantly impair the child’s physical health or emotional development; or

•	 Both  parents,  the  surviving  parent,  or  the  managing  conservator  or  custodian  either 

filed the petition or consented to the suit. Tex. Fam. Code § 102.004(a).

RELATIVES AND DEGREES OF CONSANGUINITY

•	 A parent or child (relatives of the first degree);
•	 A brother, sister, grandparent, or grandchild (relatives of the second degree); or
•	 A great-grandparent, great-grandchild, aunt who is a sister of a parent of the child, an 
uncle who is the brother of a parent of the child, a nephew who is the child of a brother 
or sister of the child, or a niece who is a child of a brother or sister of the child (relatives 
of the third degree). Tex. Gov’t Code § 573.023(c). 

40

I. Legal EssentialsNote:  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §§  102.003(13)  and  102.004  confer  standing  to  file  suit  on 
relatives  of  a  child  within  the  third  degree  of  consanguinity.  This  disparity  does  not 
relieve DFPS of their duty under Tex. Fam. Code §§ 262.1095 and 161.2081 to provide 
notice to relatives of a child within the fourth degree of consanguinity when DFPS takes 
possession of the child or if an order of termination of parental rights has been rendered.

10199 (Tex. App. – Fort Worth [2nd District] September 11, 2014)). 

•	 Step-uncle excluded (In re A.M.S., 277 S.W.3d 92 (Tex. App. – Texarkana 2009, no pet.)).
•	 Great-aunt or great-uncle excluded (In re N.L.D., 412 S.W.3d 810 (Tex. App. – Texarkana

PROVING SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT OF CHILD PURSUANT TO TEX. FAM. 
CODE § 102.004(a)

•	 Significant  impairment  of  child’s  physical  health  and  emotional  development  found 
with evidence of parental drug use and criminal convictions and incarceration. (In re 
K.D.H., 426 S.W.3d 879 (Tex. App. – Houston [14th Dist.] April 3, 2014, no pet.)). 

•	 Significant impairment of child’s physical health and emotional well-being found with 
evidence of physical and emotional abuse of the child even if the last alleged incident 
occurred  months  before  the  filing  of  the  petition  when  the  parent’s  ideas  regarding 
discipline  had  not  changed  during  the  period  and  the  parent  had  not  received  any 
counseling or other services during that time to mitigate the risk of continued abuse. In 
re McDaniel, 408 S.W.3d 389 (Tex. App. – Houston [1st Dist.] 2011).

•	 Significant  impairment  of  emotional  development  found  where  a  parent  fails  to  send 
their  child  to  school  on  a  regular  basis  and  fails  to  provide  necessary  therapeutic 
interventions for a child with poor school performance and behavioral issues. Maudlin 
v. Clements, 428 S.W.3d 247 (Tex. App. – Houston 2014).

Note:  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  102.004(a)  provides  an  avenue  for  grandparents  and  other 
relatives  within  the  requisite  degree  of  consanguinity  to  file  for  custody  of  a  child  in 
an investigation or Family Based Safety Services stage of a child welfare case which 
does not require the rehabilitative and service requirements of a TMC case or the same 
restrictions.

Standing to Intervene in a Pending Suit
An  original  suit  requesting  possessory  conservatorship  may  not  be  filed  by  a  grandparent  or 
other person. However, the court may grant a grandparent or other person deemed to have had 
substantial past contact with the child leave to intervene in a pending suit filed by a person 
authorized  to  do  so  under  Tex.  Fam.  Code  Chapter  102  if  there  is  satisfactory  proof  to  the 
court  that  the  appointment  of  a  parent  as  a  sole  managing  conservator  or  both  parents  as 
joint managing conservators would significantly impair the child’s physical health or emotional 
development. Tex. Fam. Code § 102.004(b).

41

I. Legal EssentialsAPPLICABLE TO PENDING SAPCRS

•	 A grandparent or other person can only utilize Tex. Fam. Code § 102.004(b) in SAPCRs 

that have not yet resulted in a final order. 

•	 In  the  context  of  child  welfare  cases,  the  SAPCR  is  no  longer  pending  once  DFPS  is 

appointed PMC of the child.

PLEADING REQUIREMENTS 

contact with the child; and

•	 The grandparent or other person must establish that they have had substantial past 

•	 The grandparent or other person must present satisfactory proof to the court that the 
appointment  of  the  parent  or  parents  as  sole  or  joint  managing  conservators  would 
significantly impair the child’s physical health and emotional development. Tex. Fam. 
Code § 102.004(b).

Relevant Case Law 
SUBSTANTIAL PAST CONTACT 

•	 Courts have applied the standard definition of “substantial” from the Random House 
Dictionary as “of ample or considerable amount, quantity, size, etc.” and have evaluated 
the amount of actual contact and not the difficulties of the intervening party maintaining 
contact. (In re C.M.C., 192 S.W.3d 866 (Tex. App. – Texarkana 2006, no pet.)).

•	 “Substantial past contact” has been found to involve more than seeing a child regularly 
during  his  or  her  life.  Substantial  past  contact  has  been  shown  by  parties  who  have 
“frequently cared for the children, lived nearby, and spent a great deal of time with the 
family.” (Blackwell v. Humble, 241 S.W.3d 707 (Tex. App. – Austin 2007, no pet.)).

•	 Relatives  who  have  cared  for  a  child  for  as  few  as  7  weeks  have  been  found  to  have 
substantial  past  contact.  The  Court’s  analysis  focused  on  the  caretaker’s  daily 
supervision  of  the  child  during  that  time  and  found  the  intervening  party  to  have 
established substantial past contact in undertaking the daily functions of legal custody 
during that time. (In re A.L.W.,  No. 02-11-00480-CV (Tex. App. – Fort Worth Nov. 8, 
2012, pet. denied)(mem. op.)). 

•	 In a case of first impression, the Dallas Court of Appeals has held that grandparents, 
as opposed “other persons,” are not required to establish substantial past contact under 
Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  102.004(b).  See  In  re  Nelke,  537  S.W.  3d  917,  922-23  (Tex.  App  – 
Dallas 2019, no pet h.).

Practice Tip: The determination of whether substantial past contact exists is a fact-
intensive  inquiry.  The  determination  is  not  statutorily  defined  and  case  law  does  not 
establish a clear factual framework for judges to make the determination. Deference is 
usually given to the trial court’s assessment.

EVIDENCE  THAT  APPOINTMENT  OF  PARENT(S)  AS  MANAGING 
CONSERVATOR WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIR THE CHILD’S PHYSICAL 
HEALTH AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT

•	 A  person  with  substantial  past  contact  with  a  child  will  be  unable  to  show  evidence 
that the appointment of a parent as the managing conservator would cause significant 

42

I. Legal Essentialsimpairment  when  facts  show  only  speculation  of  potential  harm  if  the  parent  is 
appointed conservator. (In re S.M.D., 329 S.W.3d 8 (Tex. App. – San Antonio, 2010, pet. 
dismissed)).

“SIGNIFICANT  IMPAIRMENT”  DURING  REUNIFICATION  PHASE  OF  A 
CHILD WELFARE CASE

•	 Alleged father who had independently raised the child for two and a half years submitted 
to paternity testing and was dismissed as a party to the case after genetic testing ruled 
him out as the father. He intervened alleging substantial past contact. He was denied 
leave  to  intervene  because  he  failed  to  show  that  the  appointment  of  the  mother  as 
sole  managing  conservator  would  significantly  impair  the  child’s  physical  health  and 
emotional development. Testimony offered by the Department at multiple hearings had 
shown that she had complied with all court orders and service plan requirements, that 
the child had already been placed with her and that the Department was recommending 
dismissal of the case. The Court of Appeals found no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s 
refusal  to  grant  leave  to  intervene.  (L.J.  v.  Texas  Department  of  Family  &  Protective 
Services, No. 03-11-00435-CV (Tex. App. – Austin, August 1, 2012, pet. denied) (mem. 
op.)). 

Foster Parent Interventions 
GENERAL STANDING PROVISION 

An original suit may be filed at any time by a person who is the foster parent of a child placed by 
the DFPS in the person’s home for at least 12 months ending not more than 90 days preceding 
the date of the filing of the petition. Tex. Fam. Code § 102.003(a)(12).

FOSTER PARENT INTERVENTION LIMITED

Tex. Fam. Code § 102.004(b) allows persons with substantial past contact with a child leave to 
intervene in a pending suit if they can provide satisfactory proof to the court that the appointment 
of  a  parent  as  Sole  Managing  Conservator  or  both  parents  as  Joint  Managing  Conservators 
would  significantly  impair  the  child’s  physical  health  or  emotional  development.  However,  a 
foster  parent  may  only  be  granted  leave  to  intervene  under  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  102.004(b)  if 
the foster parent would have standing to file an original suit as provided by Tex. Fam. Code § 
102.003(a)(12). Tex. Fam. Code § 102.004(b-1).

Limitations on Standing
Except  as  provided  by  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  102.006(b)  and  (c),  if  the  parent-child  relationship 
between the child and every living parent of the child has been terminated, an original suit may 
not be filed by:

•	 A former parent whose parent-child relationship has been terminated by court order;
•	 The father of the child; or
•	 A family member or relative by blood, adoption, or marriage of either a former parent 
whose  parent-child  relationship  has  been  terminated  or  the  father  of  the  child.  Tex. 
Fam. Code § 102.006(a). 

The limitations on filing suit imposed by Tex. Fam. Code § 102.006 do not apply to:

•	 A  person  who  has  a  continuing  right  to  possession  of  or  access  to  the  child  under 

43

I. Legal Essentialsan  existing  court  order  or  who  has  the  consent  of  the  child’s  managing  conservator, 
guardian, or legal custodian to bring the suit. Tex. Fam. Code § 102.006(b);

•	 An adult sibling of the child, a grandparent of the child, an aunt who is the sister of a 

parent of the child, or an uncle who is the brother of a parent of the child if:
o  the  adult  sibling,  grandparent,  aunt,  or  uncle  files  an  original  suit  or  a  suit  for 
modification  requesting  managing  conservatorship  of  the  child  not  later  than  the 
90th  day  after  the  date  the  parent-child  relationship  between  the  child  and  the 
parent is terminated. Tex. Fam. Code § 102.006(c). 

Courts have affirmed that Tex. Fam. Code § 102.006(c) serves to limit the standing of particular 
individuals when the parent-child relationship has been terminated; it does not confer standing. 
(In re N.A.D., 397 S.W.3d 747 (Tex. App. – San Antonio 2013, no pet.)) and (L.H. v. Texas Dep’t 
of  Family  and  Protective  Services,  No.  03-13-00348-CV  (Tex.  App.  –  Austin  Mar.  6,  2014,  no 
pet.)).

Practice  Tip:  A  relative  seeking  to  file  an  original  suit  once  termination  of  parental 
rights  has  occurred  must  have  standing  to  file  suit  and  must  not  be  subject  to  the 
limitations  to  standing  under  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  102.006.  If  a  limitation  on  standing 
applies to the relative seeking to file suit, consider filing a Motion to Strike. 

CONSEQUENCES OF MISSING THE 90-DAY DEADLINE

Even parties who would otherwise have standing will lose that standing if they fail to file their 
petition for custody or adoption within 90 days. 

•	 Petition  to  adopt  children  by  aunt  with  substantial  past  contact  filed  7  months  after 
parental rights were terminated was barred by Tex. Fam. Code § 102.006(c) because it 
had not been filed within 90 days of the termination order. (In re A.M., 312 S.W.3d 76 
(Tex. App. – San Antonio 2010, pet. denied)). 

Practice  Tip: DFPS  must  notify  relatives who have  been identified  under  Tex. Fam. 
Code § 262.1095 immediately after a court renders an order terminating the parent-child 
relationship that the parent-child relationship has been terminated, and they have 90 
days after the date the order is rendered to file an original suit or a suit for modification 
requesting managing conservatorship of the child in accordance with Tex. Fam. Code § 
102.006(c). Tex. Fam. Code § 161.2801. 

Relevant Case Law
TIMING ISSUES

Some  courts  have  struck  interventions  as  untimely  if  filed  too  close  to  the 
dismissal deadline. 

•	 Grandmother  filed  petition  in  intervention  two  months  before  dismissal  date  when 
permanency  plan  changed  from  reunification  to  termination  although  she  had  been 
aware of the case for over a year. Motion to Strike granted and affirmed by Appellate 
Court as within the discretion of the Court. (In the Interest of C.A.L., No. 2-05-308-CV, 
2007, Tex. App LEXIS 1196 (App.—Fort Worth Feb. 15, 2007 orig. proceeding) (mem. 
op.)). 

44

I. Legal Essentials•	 Grandfather  who  lived  in  Kentucky  filed  an  intervention  two  months  before  trial. 
(Waiting  to  file  an  intervention  when  out  of  state  and  ICPC  study  required  was 
problematic).  (Anderson  v.  Texas  Dep’t  of  Family  and  Protective  Services,  No.  03-06-
00327-CV (Tex. App. – Austin May 9, 2007, pet. denied (mem. op)). 

Court should balance the complication of the issues in the case and the rights 
of the intervening party.

•	 A trial court abuses its discretion if it strikes a petition in which (1) the intervener could 
bring  the  same  action,  or  any  part  thereof,  in  their  own  names,  (2)  the  intervention 
will  not  complicate  the  case  by  an  excessive  multiplication  of  the  issues,  and  (3)  the 
intervention  is  almost  essential  to  effectively  protect  the  interveners’  interest.  In 
applying that analysis, the court found that even though the intervention was filed only 
two weeks before trial that the intervening party had standing and should have been 
allowed to participate in the trial. (Seale v. Texas Dept. of Family & Protective Services, 
No. 01-10-00440-CV (Tex. App. – Houston [1st Dist.] Mar. 3, 2011, no pet.) (mem. op.)). 

PROCEDURAL ISSUES

Leave of court.

•	 Following the plain language of the statute, the court finds a request for leave to intervene 
is  necessary  under  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  102.004(b)  and  that  the  Intervener’s  Amended 
Petition for Intervention which requested that the court “grant the relief requested in 
this intervention” be read as a request for leave to intervene. (In the Interest of A.T., No 
14-14-00071-CV, (Tex. App. – Houston, July 15, 2014, (no pet.) (mem. op.)). 

•	 Court  found  that  Tex.  R.  Civ.  P.  60  does  not  apply  to  interventions  filed  under  Tex. 
Fam. Code § 102.004(b). Court noted that the legislature developed a separate provision 
governing  intervention  in  family  law  cases  and  gave  the  trial  court  discretion  to 
determine whether to allow an intervention even when the statutory requirements are 
met.  Court  then  found  that  no  written  motion  to  strike  was  required.  (L.J.  v.  Texas 
Department of Family & Protective Services, No. 03-11-00435-CV (Tex. App. – Austin 
Aug. 1, 2012, pet. denied) (mem. op.)). 

Imperfect pleadings can establish standing. 

•	 Appellate  courts  review  standing  issues  by  construing  the  pleadings  in  favor  of  the 
petitioner and by looking to the pleader’s intent. Question is whether a party provides 
other parties and the Court fair notice of his or her claim. (Jasek v. TDFPS, 348 S.W.3d 
523 (Tex. App. – Austin 2011, no pet.)); In the Interest of D.A., No. 02-14-00265-CV (Tex. 
App. – Fort Worth, February 5, 2015) (mem. op.); In the Interest of N.I.V.S, No. 04-14-

I. Legal EssentialsDiscovery

Overview
Discovery rules in DFPS cases are the same as in other civil cases and are governed by the Texas 
Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.  A  Suit  Affecting  the  Parent-Child  Relationship  (SAPCR)  is  usually 
subject  to  Level  2  Discovery.  Please  note  that  certain  jurisdictions  have  Level  3  Discovery 
Control Plans and orders in place as part of their local rules and may modify the date by which 
responses are due and require court approval to go outside of the parameters of the Discovery 
Control Plan. For more information, see Texas Law Help Discovery in Texas: Investigate and 
Prepare for Trial. 

It is important to respond to all discovery requests within 30 days after the discovery is served 
or  in  accordance  with  deadlines  set  forth  in  a  court  ordered  or  local  Discovery  Control  Plan. 
Failure to timely answer discovery may limit the evidence and testimony which can be presented 
at trial. Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.6(a).

Types of Discovery in Texas Rules of Civil Procedure
Responding to Written Discovery

Tex. R. Civ. P. 193

•	 If  an  objection  is  not  timely  asserted  then  the  objection  is  waived  unless  the  court 

excuses the waiver for good cause shown. Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.2(e).

•	 A party is required to amend or supplement their response reasonably promptly after 
the  party  discovers  the  necessity  for  the  amended  response.  It  is  presumed  that  an 
amended or supplemental response made less than 30 days before trial was not made 
reasonably promptly. Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.5(b).

•	 A  party  who  fails  to  make,  amend,  or  supplement  a  discovery  response,  including  a 
required disclosure, in a timely manner may not introduce in evidence the material or 
information or offer the testimony of a witness (other than a named party) unless the 
court finds that there was good cause for the failure or that the failure of the party to 
do so will not unfairly surprise or unfairly prejudice the other parties. Tex. R. Civ. P. 
193.6(a).

Required Disclosures 

Tex. R. Civ. P. 194

•	 Child welfare actions filed under Texas Family Code Title 5, Subtitle E are exempt from 
required initial disclosures, but are still subject to court orders for particular disclosures 
and disclosure timelines set by the court. Tex. R. Civ. P. 194.2(d)(5).

•	 Unless  otherwise  ordered  by  the court, pretrial disclosures must be made at least 30 

days before trial. Tex. R. Civ. P. 194.4(b).

Discovery Regarding Testifying Expert Witnesses 

Tex. R. Civ. P. 195

•	 Unless otherwise ordered by the court, a party seeking affirmative relief must designate 

experts 90 days before the end of the discovery period. Tex. R. Civ. P. 195.2(a). 

Requests for Production of Documents

Tex. R. Civ. P. 196

46

I. Legal Essentials•	 Must be served at least 30 days before the end of the discovery period. Tex. R. Civ. P. 

196.1(a).

•	 Can include a request for entry upon property. Tex. R. Civ. P. 196.7.

Practice Tip: Consider requesting a copy of both the redacted and the unredacted de-
identified (“De-ID”) file from DFPS no less than 60 days prior to the end of the discovery 
period, even if the other parties to the suit have not requested it, to avoid unnecessary 
delays related to production closer to trial. 

•	 Must be served on another party no later than 30 days before the end of the discovery 

period. Tex. R. Civ. P. 197.1.

•	 Responding party must serve their written response on the requesting party within 30 

days after service of the interrogatories. Tex. R. Civ. P. 197.2(a).

•	 Must be served on another party no later than 30 days before the end of the discovery 

period. Tex. R. Civ. P. 198.1.

•	 Responding party must serve their written response on the requesting party within 30 

days after service of the request. Tex. R. Civ. P. 198.2(a).

•	 Failure to respond timely will result in admissions being deemed admitted. Tex. R. Civ. 

Interrogatories

Tex. R. Civ. P. 197 

Requests for Admission

Tex. R. Civ. P.198

P. 198.2(c). 

Depositions

Tex. R. Civ. P. 199-200

•	 Any objection to the time and place of the deposition must be made by filing a motion 

for protective order or a motion to quash. Tex. R. Civ. P. 199.4.

•	 Notice of intent to take written deposition must be served on witnesses and all parties 
at least 20 days before the deposition is taken. A deposition on written questions may 
be taken outside of the discovery period only by agreement of the parties or with leave 
of the court. Tex. R. Civ. P. 200.1. 

•	 Objections to the form of a question are waived unless asserted in accordance with Tex. 

R. Civ. P. 200.3(b). Tex. R. Civ. P. 200.3(c).

Practice Tip: Some courts limit depositions or require that a motion be filed to request 
a court order for depositions to be taken.

Requests for Physical and Mental Examinations

Tex. R. Civ. P. 204

•	 In a DFPS suit, on motion by a party or the court’s own initiative, the court may appoint:

47

I. Legal Essentialso  one or more psychologists or psychiatrists to examine a child or another other party 

to the suit; and/or

o  a qualified expert to test and determine paternity. Tex. R. Civ. P.204.4.

COMMON OBJECTIONS TO DISCOVERY 

The following is a non-exclusive list of objections that may be raised to requests for discovery.

•	 Discovery not timely requested.
•	 Vague,  ambiguous,  argumentative,  overbroad,  and  unduly  burdensome,  and  not 

reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

•	 Broad, uncertain, and unintelligible so that the responding party cannot determine the 

nature of the information sought.

•	 Repetitive (if the information requested or produced has already been requested in the 

discovery). 

•	 Privileged  (if  the  information  calls  for  privileged  information  such  as  attorney-client 

communication or is otherwise privileged). Tex. Civ. P. 193.3.

If  an  asserted  privilege  or  objection  only  pertains  in  part  as  to  the  request  for  production  or 
response, a party is required to comply with any part of the request for production or response 
that is not objected to. 

Practice  Tip:  If  an  attorney  for  the  party  served  with  discovery  responds  with  an 
objection  that  the  request  is  vague  or  not  applicable,  the  proponent  of  the  discovery 
request  can  consider  filing  a  Motion  to  Compel  Discovery  and  request  a  hearing  to 
address the validity of the objection. When there is a partial answer, if it is preceded 
by an objection, the objection should be addressed in this manner to ensure that a full 
answer is given.

Notable Discovery Issues in CPS Cases
DISCLOSURE  OF  CERTAIN  EVIDENCE  PRIOR  TO  THE  ADVERSARY 
HEARING

At the request of the attorney for a parent who is a party in a SAPCR filed under Tex. Fam. Code 
Ch. 262, or of the attorney ad litem for the child, DFPS must provide the names of witnesses 
(excluding an employee of DFPS) who will testify to allegations, copies of offense reports that 
will  be  used,  and  any  photo,  video  or  recording  that  may  be  used  at  that  adversary  hearing 
before the start of such hearing. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.014. Items produced prior to an adversary 
hearing may need to be redacted by the attorney representing DFPS due to the short time frame 
available to comply with the request. 

Practice  Tip:  Be  prepared  to  manage  the  time  and  effort  involved  in  the  redaction 
of  confidential  information  in  any  documents  produced  under  a  request  for  certain 
disclosures prior to the adversary hearing in order to timely comply with those disclosure 
requests.

48

I. Legal EssentialsCONFIDENTIALITY AND DISCLOSURE OF EVIDENCE

DFPS files contain information that is confidential by law and may only be disclosed for purposes 
consistent with the Texas Family Code and applicable federal and state law. Tex. Fam. Code § 
261.201; See also 40 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 745.8481-745.8493. Confidentiality provisions require 
the redaction of DFPS documents in response to a discovery request that is not subject to release, 
such as the identity of the reporter of abuse or neglect. Tex. Fam. Code § 261.201. 

Practice  Tip:  Citing  confidentiality,  an  attorney  representing  DFPS  should  object 
to  any  questions  pertaining  to  the  identity  of  the  reporter  unless  the  court  has  had  a 
hearing based upon a motion to release that information.

Practice  Tip:  Redaction  of  the  record  by  DFPS’  record  management  department  can 
take  up  to  20  days,  but  may  take  longer.  While  the  record  management  department 
will usually have redactions completed within the time frame for discovery deadlines, 
attorneys representing DFPS might be prepared to file any motions for extension prior 
to the discovery deadline or seek a Rule 11 agreement to extend the discovery deadline 
in case of any delays. 

Practice  Tip:  The  DFPS  record  management  department  should  send  the  attorney 
representing DFPS copies of both the redacted and unredacted case file, also referred to 
as the de-identified (“De-ID”) file. Only the prosecutor and child advocates are entitled to 
an unredacted copy of the file. Attorneys representing DFPS should review the redacted 
copy against the unredacted file for any possible oversights regarding redactions before 
serving opposing counsel with the De-ID file; examples are the blacking out of multiple 
pages of information instead of just the portions containing confidential information, or 
conversely, overlooking critical redactions such as emails containing an attorney-client 
communication.  Case  files  produced  by  DFPS  in  discovery  can  be  thousands  of  pages 
long,  and  redaction  mistakes  might  be  made.  If  so,  immediately  contact  the  records 
management department to correct the issue.

Special  rules  govern  the  exchange  of  information  about  expert  witnesses  in  the  discovery 
process. Note that the scope of discovery is different when cases involve testifying experts or 
consulting experts rather than those whose work has been reviewed by a testifying expert. Tex. 
R. Civ. P. 195.

EXPERTS

PRIVILEGES

Commonly invoked privileges in child abuse litigation include those related to:

•	 Mental health records;
•	 Drug and alcohol abuse records;
•	 Attorney-client privilege; and
•	 Work product.

49

I. Legal EssentialsSUBPOENAS

A person served with a subpoena can request a protective order if the subpoena seeks information 
that is privileged or otherwise objectionable. Tex. R. Civ. P. 176(e). DFPS has adopted detailed 
policy governing procedures for handling subpoenas served on individual staff or the agency. The 
DFPS Subpoena Policy is available on the DFPS website. Additionally, attorneys representing 
DFPS  may  contact  their  local  Regional  Attorney’s  Office  for  more  information  regarding  the 
“subpoena mailbox,” and its uses. 

Practice Tip: The subpoena range in a civil proceeding is limited: a person cannot be 
compelled to appear or produce documents more than 150 miles away from where they 
reside or were served. If a potential witness is located outside of the subpoena range, an 
attorney  representing  DFPS  might  reach  out  to  see  if  the  witness  would  be  willing  to 
attend court to testify. Most courts now have the ability to allow for testimony via video 
conferencing such as Zoom. It is advisable to check with the court early in the case to 
determine if this may be an option for necessary witnesses outside of the subpoena range. 
Some courts may also allow this option for witnesses who may be otherwise unavailable 
to attend court in person. 

Practice Tip: DFPS will submit a request for payment, commonly referred to as a 2054, 
for any contracted service providers who are expected to testify at a hearing. It is a best 
practice for DFPS to submit this payment request for contracted providers even when 
the provider has been subpoenaed to testify on behalf of opposing counsel. 

BUSINESS RECORDS 

The Texas Rules of Evidence allow an exception to the hearsay rule for business records as long 
as they meet the requirements of Tex. R. Evid. 803(6), and they can be submitted without the 
testimony of the custodian of records or other qualified witness if accompanied by an affidavit 
that meets the requirements of Tex. R. Evid. 902(10). 

Practice  Tip:  When  seeking  documents  by  subpoena  from  a  third  party,  such  as  a 
hospital or other medical provider, consider including a business records affidavit along 
with the subpoena so that the documents may be authenticated without live testimony. 
Pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 21a, the proponent of the documents must serve the documents 
and the accompanying affidavit on each party to the case at least 14 days before trial.

Practice Tip: Some medical providers may file motions to quash subpoenas, so it may 
be necessary to have the court rule on the validity of the subpoena in order to obtain the 
records. If the records requested are for the child, include a copy of the order naming 
DFPS the Temporary Managing Conservator of the child along with the subpoena for 
the child’s records. If a parent has executed a release of medical information to DFPS, 
include a copy of the release with the request to increase the likelihood of release of the 
information sought. 

50

I. Legal EssentialsREQUESTS FOR ADMISSION

If Requests for Admission are not timely answered, they may be deemed admitted without a 
court order. Tex. R. Civ. P. 198.2(c). 

If you have unanswered Requests for Admission, consider presenting the following points to the 
court: 

•	 Requests  for  Admissions  were  intended  to  “eliminat[e]  matters  about  which  there  is 
no real controversy” and were “never intended to be used as a demand upon a plaintiff 
or  defendant  to  admit  that  he  had  no  cause  of  action  or  ground  of  defense.”  Stelly  v. 
Papania, 927 S.W.2d 620, 622 (Tex. 1996) (per curiam). 

•	 Requests for Admissions should be used as “a tool, not a trapdoor.” Marino v. King, 355 
S.W.3d 629, 632 (Tex. 2011) (quoting U.S. Fid. and Guar. Co. v. Goudeau, 272 S.W.3d 
603, 610 (Tex. 2008)).

•	 When a party uses deemed admissions to try to preclude presentation of the merits of 
a case, due process concerns arise. See TransAmerican Nat. Gas Corp. v. Powell, 811 
S.W.2d 913, 917-18 (Tex. 1991). 

•	 “Constitutional  imperatives  favor  the  determination  of  cases  on  their  merits  rather 
than on harmless procedural defaults.” Marino, 355 S.W.3d at 634. Absent flagrant bad 
faith or callous disregard for the rules, due process bars merits preclusive sanctions for 
discovery abuses. Wheeler v. Green, 157 S.W.3d 439, 443 (Tex. 2005).

MOTION FOR ENFORCEMENT AND/OR TO COMPEL

Sanctions for abuse of the discovery process include orders denying discovery, imposing costs, 
finding  facts  established,  limiting  claims  or  defenses,  striking  pleadings  or  dismissing  an 
action, and/or a contempt order for failure to comply with any order except orders to submit to a 
physical or mental examination. The movant can wait until trial and then ask the court to grant 
sanctions for failure to answer.

Practice  Tip:  A  remedy  to  the  Motion  for  Enforcement  or  Contempt  is  usually  the 
production  of  the  discovery.  To  avoid  any  hearings  on  the  motions,  the  attorney 
representing  DFPS  can  simply  turn  over  the  requested  materials,  if  they  are  not 
protected. If material is protected, i.e., the reporter’s name, a hearing may be necessary 
for a court order on the release of such material. Tex. Fam. Code 261.201. 

Case  Law  on  Admitting  Discovery  Even  if  it  was  Not 
Properly Produced 
•	 Parties are allowed to testify even if they were not disclosed as witnesses in 
discovery.  In  re  J.L.J.,  352  S.W.3d  536  (Tex.  App.—El  Paso  2011,  no  pet.)  (mother 
who signed affidavit of relinquishment prior to final judgment was still a party to the 
suit and allowed to testify at trial against father.). Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.6(a) expressly 
exempts parties from exclusion if not disclosed as a potential witness in discovery. In re 
M.J.M., 406 S.W.3d 292, 299 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2013, no pet.) (holding the trial 
court  erred  in  assessing  death  penalty  sanctions,  and  noting,  “Rule  193.6  expressly 
states that it does not apply to the testimony of named parties.”).

51

I. Legal Essentials•	 The failure to timely make, amend, or supplement the discovery response did 
not  unfairly  surprise  or  unfairly  prejudice  the  other  parties.  Tex.  R.  Civ.  P. 
193.6(a)(2). In re M.F.D., No. 01-16-00295-CV (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Dec. 8, 
2016, no pet.) (mem. op.) (The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that there 
was a lack of unfair surprise or unfair prejudice when DFPS’ petition, a Status Hearing 
order, and service plan put the parent on notice that DFPS would seek termination if 
reunification could not be achieved.)

•	 Because the best interest of a child is of primary importance, the Third Court 
of Appeals has held that witnesses in a termination trial should be allowed to 
testify even if they were not disclosed in discovery. Spurck v. Tex. Dep’t of Family 
and Protective Servs., 396 S.W.3d 205, 215 (Tex. App.—Austin 2013, no pet.)
o  But Note: In finding that DFPS’ witnesses should not have been allowed to testify due 
to a failure to timely disclose, the Sixth Court of Appeals disagreed with the Third 
Court’s reasoning in Spurck, stating “while we do not disagree with the Austin court 
regarding  the  importance  of  the  best  interest  issue  in  custody  cases,  Spurck  and 
R.H. were parental-rights termination cases brought by the Department, whereas 
the cases cited by the court in deciding Spurck and R.H. involved motions to modify 
conservatorship between the biological parents of the child. Due to the significant 
differences between custody cases between biological parents and suits brought by 
the Department to terminate a parent’s parental rights, we do not agree that the 
rule elevating the best-interest issue over “technical rules of pleading and practice” 
governs parental-rights termination cases.” In re D.W.G.K. 558 S.W.3d 671, 686-691 
(Tex. App.—Texarkana 2018, no pet.) (citing Spurck,  396 S.W.3d at 215).  See also 
R.H.  v.  Tex.  Dep’t  of  Family  and  Protective  Servs.,  No.  03-00-00018-CV,  2001  WL 
491119 (Tex.App.—Austin May 1, 2001, pet. denied).

Practice  Tip:  Upon  receipt  of  discovery,  the  attorney  representing  DFPS  should 
review, forward production to the records management department for records, forward 
interrogatories  and  disclosures  to  the  caseworker  for  answers,  and  calendar  the  due 
date.  Setting  a  reminder  about  a  week  before  the  due  date  will  prompt  the  attorney 
representing  DFPS  to  gather  the  answers  from  caseworker  and  ensure  the  records 
department has gathered and sent all the records. Although others at the department 
may answer the questions, it is the responsibility of the attorney representing DFPS to 
gather and ensure proper answers are turned over on time.

Practice Tip: If discovery responses are not timely made, amended, or supplemented, 
and evidence is excluded as a result, attorneys representing DFPS might try the 
following under Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.6 to advocate for admitting the evidence: 
•  Move for a continuance and ask the court to allow more time to respond to the  
 
•  Try to prove good cause for a failure to respond (clerical accident, mistake);  
•  Try to prove lack of unfair surprise and prejudice (no actual delay caused); and/ or  
•  Argue that sanctions are not to be used as a tool to preclude presentation of the  
  merits.

OVERVIEW

Like  procedural  rules,  evidentiary  rules  in  DFPS  cases  are  the  same  as  in  other  civil  cases 
and are governed by the Texas Rules of Evidence. Tex. R. Evid. 901  provides, “to satisfy the 
requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of evidence, the proponent must produce 
evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what a proponent claims it is.”

Fifth Amendment Considerations
FIFTH AMENDMENT DOES APPLY TO CIVIL CASES

The  right  against  self-incrimination  applies  to  both  civil  and  criminal  cases.  McCarthy  v. 
Anderson, 266 U.S. 34 (1924). The application is not dependent on the type of proceeding, but on 
whether the answers to the questions could subject the person who answers to criminal liability 
in the future. Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70 (1973).

TESTIFYING IN A CIVIL CASE

In a civil case, the state has the right to call the opposing party as a witness, but the individual 
retains  their  right  against  self-incrimination  if  they  reasonably  fear  that  the  answer  sought 
may be incriminating. Texas Dept. of Pub. Safety Officers Ass’n v. Denton, 897 S.W.2d 757, 760 
(Tex. 1995).

NO BLANKET ASSERTION OF PRIVILEGE

However, the party may not make a blanket assertion against self-incrimination in a civil case. 
They must assert the privilege in response to each question and the judge rules on whether the 
witness can assert his Fifth Amendment right to a given question. In re Verbois, 10 S.W. 3d 825, 
828 (Tex. App. – Waco 2000).

NEGATIVE INFERENCE ALLOWED

Unlike in a criminal case, the application of the Fifth Amendment in civil cases is not automatic 
and if the witness fails to testify, or fails to answer a question, it may be held against them. 
The factfinder is “free to draw negative inferences from [a witness’s] repeated invocations of the 
Fifth Amendment.” Wilz v. Flournoy, 228 S.W.3d 674, 677 (Tex. 2007).

55

I. Legal EssentialsPractice Tip: A respondent parent may be called as a witness in a child welfare hearing 
and  may  assert  their  Fifth  Amendment  privilege  in  response  to  any  question  asked  if 
they reasonably fear that the answer sought may incriminate them. The judge will then 
rule on whether the privilege may be asserted as to each question for which the privilege 
is asserted. Unlike in criminal cases, the factfinder in a child welfare case is allowed to 
draw a negative inference from the witness’ refusal to answer and/or invocation of the 
Fifth Amendment. 

Establishing a Child’s Competence to Testify
PRESUMPTION OF COMPETENCE

The Texas Rules of Evidence provide that every person is competent to be a witness unless the 
rules  provide  otherwise.  Generally,  a  child  is  presumed  to  be  competent  to  testify.  However, 
“persons lacking sufficient intellect” are incompetent to testify. A child may be one such witness, 
but a procedure must be followed to challenge the child’s competence. Accordingly, the burden 
is on the party challenging the child’s competence. Tex. R. Evid. 601(a).

The issue of the child’s competence must be raised by a party opposing the child’s testimony. 
At that point, the court must examine the child to assess whether the child “does not possess 
sufficient  intellect  to  relate  transactions  about  which  he  will  testify.”  In  doing  so,  the  court 
considers:

•	 The competence of the child to observe intelligently the events in question at the time 

of the occurrence;

•	 The child’s capacity to recollect the events; 
•	 The child’s capacity to narrate the facts; and
•	 Whether the child lacks the capacity to understand the obligation of the oath. Pipkin v. 
Kroger Tex., L.P., 383 S.W.3d 655, 668 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.], pet. denied). 
See also In re R.M.T., 352 S.W.3d 12 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2011, no pet.).

Practice  Tip:  To  establish  that  a  child  has  the  capacity  to  understand  the  oath,  the 
attorney needs to show that the child knows the difference between the truth and a lie 
(not that the child understands perjury). Rather than asking the child to define “truth” 
and “lie,” it is most developmentally effective to provide the child with simple examples 
of truth and lies. For example, “Sam, if someone told you that the judge’s robe is pink, 
would that be the truth or a lie?”

TEXAS FAMILY CODE

Pre-recorded Statement of a Child 

Tex. Fam. Code §104.002

If a child 12 years of age or younger is alleged in a suit under this title to have been abused, the 
recording of an oral statement of the child recorded prior to the proceeding is admissible into 
evidence if:

•	 No attorney for a party was present when the statement was made;
•	 The recording is both visual and aural and is recorded on film or videotape or by other 

electronic means;

•	 The  recording  equipment  was  capable  of  making  an  accurate  recording,  the  operator

I. Legal Essentialswas competent, and the recording is accurate and has not been altered;

•	 The statement was not made in response to questioning calculated to lead the child to 

make a particular statement;

•	 Each voice on the recording is identified;
•	 The  person  conducting  the  interview  of  the  child  in  the  recording  is  present  at  the 

proceeding and available to testify or be cross-examined by either party; and

•	 Each  party  is  afforded  an  opportunity  to  view  the  recording  before  it  is  offered  into 

evidence. 

Pre-recorded Videotaped Testimony of Child 

Tex. Fam. Code §104.003

•	 The court may, on the motion of a party to the proceeding, order that the testimony of 
the child be taken outside the courtroom and be recorded for showing in the courtroom 
before the court, the finder of fact, and the parties to the proceeding.

•	 Only  an  attorney  for  each  party,  an  attorney  ad  litem  for  the  child  or  other  person 
whose presence would contribute to the welfare and well-being of the child, and persons 
necessary to operate the equipment may be present in the room with the child during 
the child’s testimony.

•	 Only the attorneys for the parties may question the child.
•	 The  persons  operating  the  equipment  shall  be  placed  in  a  manner  that  prevents  the 

child from seeing or hearing them.

•	 The court shall ensure that:

o  the  recording  is  both  visual  and  aural  and  is  recorded  on  film  or  videotape  or  by 

other electronic means;

o  the recording equipment was capable of making an accurate recording, the operator 

was competent, and the recording is accurate and is not altered;

o  each voice on the recording is identified; and
o  each party to the proceeding is afforded an opportunity to view the recording before  

it is shown in the courtroom.

Remote Televised Broadcast of Testimony of Child 

Tex. Fam. Code §104.004

•	 If in a suit a child 12 years of age or younger is alleged to have been abused, the court 
may, on the motion of a party to the proceeding, order that the testimony of the child be 
taken in a room other than the courtroom and be televised by closed-circuit equipment 
in the courtroom to be viewed by the court and the parties.

•	 The procedures that apply to prerecorded videotaped testimony of a child apply to the 

remote broadcast of testimony of a child.

Substitution for In-Court Testimony of Child

Tex. Fam. Code §104.005

•	 If the testimony of a child is taken as provided by this chapter, the child may not be 

compelled to testify in court during the proceeding.

60

I. Legal Essentials•	 The  court  may  allow  the  testimony  of  a  child  of  any  age  to  be  taken  in  any  manner 
provided  by  this  chapter  if  the  child,  because  of  a  medical  condition,  is  incapable  of 
testifying in open court.

Hearsay Statement of Child Abuse Victim (“Outcry” Statements) 

Tex. Fam. Code § 104.006

•	 In a suit affecting the parent-child relationship, a statement made by a child 12 years 
of  age  or  younger  that  describes  alleged  abuse  against  the  child,  without  regard  to 
whether  the  statement  is  otherwise  inadmissible  as  hearsay,  is  admissible  if,  in  a 
hearing conducted outside the presence of the jury, the court finds that the time, content, 
and  circumstances  of  the  statement  provide  sufficient  indications  of  the  statement’s 
reliability; and

•	 The child testifies or is available to testify at the proceeding in court or in any other 

manner provided for by law; or

•	 The court determines that the use of the statement in lieu of the child’s testimony is 

necessary to protect the welfare of the child.

•	 See,  e.g.,  In  the  Interest  of  E.M.,  494  S.W.3d  209  (Tex.App.—Waco  2015,  pet.  denied)
(focus  is  on  the  outcry  statement  itself,  not  the  abuse;  therapist  testified  outcry 
statements  regarding  domestic  violence  between  the  parents  were  credible  because 
they were expressed in a manner consistent with what the therapist would expect, were 
made in age-appropriate language, were consistent through different placements, and 
were not of the type this aged child would make up).

Practice  Tip:  Note  that  age  restrictions  apply  to  some  of  the  above  exemptions,  and 
some require that a motion be filed.

Preservation of Error
AT TRIAL OR IN A HEARING

Timely Objections

Tex. R. App P. 33.1

To preserve error, the party objecting to the admission of evidence must make a timely request, 
objection, or motion to strike from the record, and obtain a ruling on the record. Similarly, the 
proponent of excluded evidence must make an offer of proof setting forth the substance of the 
evidence.

Objections must be timely:

•	 Improper question: must object before an answer is given.
•	 Improper  answer:  objection  must  be  made  as  soon  as  that  fact  becomes  apparent. 
Although it is proper to object to a completed answer (and necessary in order to protect 
the  record)  this  is  not  the  most  desirable  solution.  If  your  objection  is  sustained,  ask 
that the answer be struck and that the jury be instructed to disregard it.

61

I. Legal EssentialsPractice  Tip:  Listen  for  possible  leading  questions  on  direct  examination,  questions 
that call for a narrative, or questions that solicit irrelevant information.    After objecting, 
clearly  but  respectfully  request  to  get  a  ruling  on  the  record,  especially  if  the  Court 
does not respond directly to the request and instead says something like, “move along, 
Counsel,”  etc.  Without  a  ruling  on  the  objection,  the  error  may  not  be  preserved  for 
appeal. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(2)(B).

Offer of Proof 

Tex. R. Evid. 103(a)(2)

An offer of proof preserves an argument regarding evidence by informing the appellate court 
what evidence was excluded by the trial court. Through an offer of proof, counsel can memorialize 
testimony excluded by the trial court. Exhibits not admitted into evidence should be marked 
and handed to the court’s reporter for inclusion in the record.

Practice  Tip:  When  physical  evidence  or  testimony  is  excluded  by  an  opponent’s 
sustained objection, request to make an Offer of Proof outside the presence of the jury. 
On the record, state what the evidence is and why it should be admitted; then ask the 
court to admit the evidence for the limited purpose of making a record for appeal. In a 
jury trial, this must be done before the court reads its charge to the jury. In a bench trial, 
this must be done before the closing of evidence. 

Bill of Exception 

Tex. R. App. P. 33.2

Informs appellate court of evidence that was excluded at trial and therefore is not reflected in 
the record.

•	 Must obtain the trial court’s signature and must be filed with the trial court no later 

than 30 days after notice of appeal is filed.

•	 The document must be specific enough to make the trial judge aware of the rulings or 
actions which are the subject of the complaint, and which will be asserted on appeal.

•	 Must be presented to trial judge and opposing counsel.
•	 Can be agreed to by all parties or a hearing held to determine issues.

Practice Tip: Although a Bill of Exception is less common than an Offer of Proof, it is a 
method for obtaining review of a matter which is not reflected in the record.

Accelerated Appeals 

Tex. R. App. P. 28.1

Appeals  in  parental  termination  and  child  welfare  cases  (SAPCR  filed  by  DFPS  requesting 
managing conservatorship) are governed by rules of appellate procedure for accelerated appeals 
except as otherwise provided by Tex. R. App. P. 28.4.

62

I. Legal Essentials•	 In  an  accelerated  appeal,  the  notice  of  appeal  must  be  filed  within  20  days  after  the 

order of judgment is signed. Tex. R. App. P. 26.1 (b).

•	 To perfect an accelerated appeal, the notice of the appeal must be filed in compliance 
with Tex. R. App. P. 25.1 within the time allowed by Rule 26.1 (b). Tex. R. App. P. 28.1 
(b). Filing a motion for new trial or other post-trial motion, or findings of fact will not 
extend the time to perfect an accelerated appeal.

Practice Tip: It is critical to ensure the trial court record is very clear in case of appeal. 
When arguing on the record, avoid using terms of art and acronyms (OV, FBSS, “dad was 
positive,” etc.). Also, avoid terms like “ruled out,” “unable to determine,” etc. unless an 
explanation for what those terms mean is provided. 

Expert Witnesses
ADMISSIBILITY

For expert testimony to be admissible, the court must be satisfied that three conditions are met:

•	 The witness qualifies as an expert;
•	 The subject matter of the testimony is an appropriate one for the expert’s testimony; 

and

•	 Admitting the expert testimony will assist the factfinder in deciding the case.

Even if the expert is qualified and the topic is a proper one for expert testimony, the proposed 
testimony must be reliable and relevant. E.I. du Pont de Nemours v. Robinson, 923 S.W.2d 549 
(Tex. 1995).

EVIDENTIARY RULES ON EXPERT WITNESSES

•	 Must be relevant. Tex. R. Evid. 401.
•	 Relevant evidence is generally admissible; irrelevant evidence is not. Tex. R. Evid. 402.
•	 Testimony  by  experts  is  specialized  knowledge  that  will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  to 
determine a fact at issue. Expert testimony can be based upon knowledge, skill, training, 
or education and expert can testify in the form of an opinion. Tex. R. Evid. 702.

•	 Bases of opinion by expert must be underlying data or facts that are the basis of opinion 
given to other party at or before the hearing. Data must be of a type reasonably relied 
upon by experts in that particular field. Tex. R. Evid. 703.

•	 Qualified experts can testify to their opinion as to the ultimate issue (i.e., should parental 

rights be terminated?). Tex. R. Evid. 704.

•	 The court acts as gatekeeper to determine if underlying facts or data are sufficiently 
reliable as the basis for the opinion testimony (must request a hearing). Tex. R. Evid. 
705(c).

“DAUBERT CHALLENGE” 

Hearing  to  determine  if  expert’s  opinion  is  based  upon  reliable  facts.  The  burden  of  proof  is 
preponderance of the evidence. Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 
S.Ct. 2786 (1993); E.I. du Pont de Nemours v. Robinson, 923 S.W.2d 549 (Tex. 1995).

63

I. Legal EssentialsThe Court must determine that:

•	 The expert’s field of expertise employs sound principles and methods;
•	 The expert’s opinion is based on sufficient facts or data; and
•	 The expert has applied the principles and methods in a reliable manner.

ROBINSON RELIABILITY FACTORS

•	 The extent to which the theory has been or can be tested;
•	 The extent to which the technique relies upon the subjective interpretation of the expert;
•	 Whether the theory has been subjected to peer review and/or publication;
•	 The technique’s potential rate of error;
•	 Whether the underlying theory or technique has been generally accepted as valid by the 

relevant scientific community; and

•	 The non-judicial uses which have been made of the theory or technique.

These  factors  are  not  exclusive  factors  and  the  trial  courts  may  consider  other  factors  which 
are helpful to determining the reliability of the scientific evidence. E.I. du Pont de Nemours v. 
Robinson, 923 S.W.2d 549 (Tex. 1995).

Sample Questions on Expert Qualification

•	 What is your occupation/profession?
•	 What is your educational background?
•	 What degrees, certificates, or licenses do you have?
•	 Have you attended or conducted continuing education seminars, conferences and related 

training?

•	 Are you a member in any professional organizations/societies?
•	 Have you received any awards or other professional recognition?
•	 Have you published articles in your field?
•	 How many cases involving [subject matter] have you handled?
•	 How many years have you worked in this field?

Sample Questions on Need for Expert Opinion

•	 What  it  is  about  a  brain  injury/a  burn  injury/bite  marks  that  requires  an  expert  to 

explain?

understand?

•	 What is it about this case that a lay person with no background in this field might not 

•	 What are the key principles that a person without education or experience in this field 

would need to grasp in order to understand this case?

•	 Can you explain the research/theoretical basis/scientific principles involved in this field 

•	 Do you believe your testimony will aid the judge or jury in understanding the facts in 

of study to a non-expert?

this case? How?

64

I. Legal EssentialsPractice  Tip: Review criminal court cases for new law and/or science, as these cases 
may be appealed more often than family law cases. For example, arson and bite mark 
science  has  changed  significantly  over  time  and  caselaw  through  appellate  review  of 
criminal cases is more prevalent. 

Sample Questions on Basis for Opinion

•	 Have you examined or interviewed the child/parent/other person?
•	 Have  you  administered  any  medical  or  psychological  tests  to  the  child/  parent/other 

person?

•	 Have you reviewed medical records/documents/police reports?
•	 Have you made a diagnosis/made a conclusion/formed an opinion?
•	 Did you rely on any other source of information in forming your opinion other than the 

medical records/documents/police reports that we have discussed?

•	 If so, what other sources did you rely on?
•	 If the facts were [supply hypothetical], could you render an opinion regarding cause of 
injury; whether the injury was intentional; and/or whether the injury is consistent with 
the parent’s report of the incident?

Sample Cross-Examination Questions of the Opposing Expert

•	 Has your theory been tested, or can it be tested?
•	 Does your technique rely on the subjective interpretation?
•	 Has your theory been peer reviewed or publicized?
•	 What is the rate of error?
•	 Has your theory been generally accepted as valid by the relevant scientific community?
•	 Have there been any other non-judicial uses of your theory?

DRUG TESTING

Drug tests are commonly admitted into evidence through parent (party) admission. Otherwise, 
for proper admission of drug test results, the source of the testing, the method used, and/or the 
circumstances or preparation of the test must indicate trustworthiness. 

The only way to prove that a test is trustworthy is to use the test administrators as witnesses 
to lay the proper foundation; this typically requires testimony from three different people. Error 
can be committed unless you admit the qualifications of the person conducting the test, testimony 
as to the type of test, and show that the test is standard and accepted for the substance tested.

For admission of a drug test, you typically need a chain of custody witness, an expert to establish 
the reliability and proper techniques and testing protocol, and an expert to testify to the results. 
However,  if  you  have  the  supervisor/director  of  the  lab,  you  may  only  need  two  witnesses  as 
they can testify to the conduct and substance of the test using a properly laid business records 
foundation  (contact  a  Department  Regional  Attorney  for  a  litigation  packet;  this  is  different 
from the de-identified case file provided in discovery). The person who administered the test is 
not enough to prove it up without the expert.

Attempts to admit drug test results using a business records affidavit are subject to a hearsay 

65

I. Legal Essentialsobjection.  An  expert  witness  must  be  present  to  prove  up  not  only  the  testing  protocol  and 
chain  of  custody,  but  also  the  test  results.  But  see  In  re  E.B.,  No.  11-19-00001-CV,  2019  WL 
3955974 (Tex.App.—Eastland August 22, 2019), finding that live testimony was not required to 
admit a drug screen and a proper affidavit executed by the custodian of records that set out the 
chain of custody, testing procedures, and qualifications of the analysts satisfied Rules 803(6) 
and 902(10) of the Texas Rules of Evidence. See also In re A.T., No. 02-04-00355-CV, 2006 WL 
563565 (Tex.App.—Ft. Worth Mar. 9, 2006), holding that a drug screen completed by a hospital 
was admissible through business record because all pertinent information related to the test 
was  laid  out  within  the  records;  however,  results  from  another  lab  included  in  the  hospital 
records were not admissible. 

Practice Tip: Drug test results admitted without proper foundation are not reversible 
error if the drug test results come into evidence through other means (i.e., the parents 
testify to the use and/or admit to the probable results). See In re K.C.P., 142 S.W.3d 574

•	 Lack of proper foundation.

TESTIMONY  OF  FORENSIC  ASSESSMENT  CENTER  NETWORK  (FACN) 
DOCTOR 

Allegations of abuse and neglect in medically complex cases are typically generated by an intake 
report received from hospital personnel or medical providers, such as a child’s pediatrician. 

DFPS utilizes the  Forensic  Assessment Center Network (FACN) in most medical abuse and/
or  medical  neglect  cases.  The  FACN  was  established  by  DFPS  in  2006  to  make  specialized 
pediatricians available for consultation to DFPS and Child Care Licensing in cases of suspected 
child  abuse  and  neglect.  The  FACN  is  managed  by  the  University  of  Texas  Health  Science 
Center (UTHealth)-Houston McGovern Medical School, in coordination with UT Health Science 
Center at San Antonio, UT Medical Branch at Galveston, UT Southwestern Medical Center at 
Dallas, Dell Children’s Medical Center at Austin, and Texas Tech University Health Sciences 
Center at Lubbock.

The  FACN  requires  consultations  with  physicians  who  are  board  certified  in  a  relevant  field 
or specialty, including radiologists, geneticists, orthopedists, and endocrinologists. Physicians 
must also have experience in certain specific conditions such as rickets, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, 
and other medical conditions that mimic child maltreatment or increase the risk of misdiagnosis 
of child maltreatment. Tex. Fam. Code § 261.3017(b). More information about referrals to the 
FACN is available in  CPS Policy Handbook § 2232 and the DFPS Forensic Assessment Center 
Network (FACN) Resource Guide.

I. Legal EssentialsMitigation of Provider Conflicts

A  health  care  provider  who  makes  a  report  of  suspected  abuse  or  neglect  of  a  child  may  not 
provide forensic assessment services in connection with an investigation from the report. This 
applies regardless of whether the health practitioner is a member of the FACN. Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 261.30175(b).

Practice Tip: In cases where a FACN physician physically evaluated a child, the FACN 
physician may testify as a medical witness. In cases where FACN only reviews records, 
the FACN physician may testify as an expert witness. 

Practice  Tip:  The  exigent  removal  of  a  child  may  not  be  based  solely  on  the  opinion 
of  a  medical  professional  under  contract  with  DFPS  who  did  not  conduct  a  physical 
examination  of  the  child.  However,  if  the  physician  who  conducted  the  physical 
examination and the FACN physician both agree that abuse or neglect occurred, both 
opinions may be used for an emergency removal. CPS Policy Handbook § 2232.5. Both 
physicians should be called to testify as witnesses in a subsequent Adversary Hearing 
where the removal was based on these opinions.

I. Legal EssentialsInvestigations

The  primary  purpose  of  a  DFPS  investigation  into  allegations  of  child  abuse  or  neglect  is  to 
protect  the  child.  DFPS  investigations  are  civil  in  nature  and  include  an  evaluation  of  the 
child’s immediate safety and an assessment of future risk of abuse or neglect. DFPS sets out the 
mandatory requirements for an investigation in CPS Policy Handbook § 2200.

DFPS investigations are conducted by a Child Protective Investigations (CPI) caseworker. At 
the conclusion of an investigation, the caseworker, with input from their supervisor, will assign 
a disposition to each allegation received based on the information gathered and may assign the 
case for closure, refer the family to services, or request that further legal action be taken. 

Practice  Tip:  During  the  course  of  an  investigation,  the  CPI  caseworker  or  their 
supervisor may seek a legal case staffing. Attorneys representing DFPS should familiarize 
themselves with DFPS policy as well as the applicable law in order to best advise DFPS. 

Practice  Tip:  When  staffing  a  case  with  DFPS,  be  sure  to  discuss  the  nature  of  the 
allegations received, the investigative actions taken by the caseworker, and the reasonable 
efforts, consistent with child safety, to prevent or eliminate the need for removing a child 
from  their  home,  that  have  been  made  in  order  to  provide  the  most  informed  advice 
to  DFPS.  Discuss  whether  any  additional  information  would  be  helpful  in  making  a 
decision about which legal remedies are available such as: are all parents accounted for, 
what are collaterals reporting, what alternatives to removal are available, and are there 
any services that can be offered to the family that will eliminate the need for removal. 

Initiation of an Investigation
Initiation of an investigation requires abuse, neglect, exploitation, or the risk of abuse or neglect 
by a person responsible for a child’s care, custody, or welfare. 

DEFINITION OF ABUSE 

Tex. Fam. Code § 261.001(1) 

“Abuse” includes the following acts or omissions by a person:

•	 Mental  or  emotional  injury  to  a  child  that  results  in  an  observable  and  material 

impairment in the child’s growth, development, or psychological functioning;

•	 Causing or permitting the child to be in a situation in which the child sustains a mental 
or emotional injury that results in an observable and material impairment in the child’s 
growth, development, or psychological functioning;

•	 Physical  injury  that  results  in  substantial  harm  to  the  child,  or  the  genuine  threat 
of  substantial  harm  from  physical  injury  to  the  child,  including  an  injury  that  is  at 
variance with the history or explanation given and excluding an accident or reasonable 
discipline by a parent, guardian, or managing or possessory conservator that does not 
expose the child to a substantial risk of harm;

•	 Failure to make a reasonable effort to prevent an action by another person that results 

in physical injury that results in substantial harm to the child;

•	 Sexual conduct harmful to a child’s mental, emotional, or physical welfare, including 
conduct  that  constitutes  the  offense  of  continuous  sexual  abuse  of  a  young  child  or 

69

II.Investigationschildren under Tex. Penal Code § 21.02, indecency with a child under Tex. Penal Code 
§ 21.11, sexual assault under Tex. Penal Code § 22.011, or aggravated sexual assault 
under Tex. Penal Code § 22.021; 

•	 Failure to make a reasonable effort to prevent sexual conduct harmful to a child;
•	 Compelling  or  encouraging  the  child  to  engage  in  sexual  conduct  as  defined  by  Tex. 
Penal  Code  §  43.01,  including  compelling  or  encouraging  the  child  in  a  manner  that 
constitutes  an  offense  of  trafficking  of  persons  under  Tex.  Penal  Code  §  20A.02(a)(7) 
or  (a)(8),  solicitation  of  prostitution  under  Tex.  Penal  Code  §  43.021,  or  compelling 
prostitution under Tex. Penal Code § 43.05(a)(2); 

•	 Causing, permitting, encouraging, engaging in, or allowing the photographing, filming, 
or  depicting  of  the  child  if  the  person  knew  or  should  have  known  that  the  resulting 
photograph, film, or depiction of the child is obscene as defined by Tex. Penal Code § 
43.21 or pornographic;

•	 The  current  use  by  a  person  of  a  controlled  substance  as  defined  by  Tex.  Health  & 
Safety Code Chapter 481, in a manner or to the extent that the use results in physical, 
mental, or emotional injury to a child;

•	 Causing, expressly permitting, or encouraging a child to use a controlled substance as 

defined by Tex. Health & Safety Code Chapter 481; 

•	 Causing, permitting, encouraging, engaging in, or allowing a sexual performance by a 

child as defined by Tex. Penal Code § 43.25; 

•	 Knowingly  causing,  permitting,  encouraging,  engaging  in,  or  allowing  a  child  to  be 
trafficked in a manner punishable as an offense under Tex. Penal Code § 20A.02(a)(5), 
(a)(6), (a)(7) or (a)(8), or the failure to make a reasonable effort to prevent a child from 
being trafficked in a manner punishable as an offense under any of those sections; or

•	 Forcing or coercing a child to enter into a marriage. 

DEFINITION OF NEGLECT

Tex. Fam. Code § 261.001(4)

“Neglect” means an act or failure to act by a person responsible for a child’s care, custody, or 
welfare evidencing the person’s blatant disregard for the consequences of the act or failure to 
act that results in harm to the child or that creates an immediate danger to the child’s physical 
health or safety.

“Neglect” includes:

•	 The leaving of a child in a situation where the child would be exposed to an immediate 
danger of physical or mental harm, without arranging for necessary care for the child, 
and the demonstration of an intent not to return by a parent, guardian, or managing or 
possessory conservator of the child;

•	 The following acts or omissions by a person:

o  placing  a  child  in  or  failing  to  remove  a  child  from  a  situation  that  a  reasonable 
person  would  realize  requires  judgment  or  actions  beyond  the  child’s  level  of 
maturity, physical condition, or mental abilities and that results in bodily injury or 
an immediate danger of immediate harm to the child;

o  failing  to  seek,  obtain,  or  follow  through  with  medical  care  for  a  child,  with  the 
failure resulting in or presenting an immediate danger of death, disfigurement, or 

70

II. Investigationsbodily injury or with the failure resulting in an observable and material impairment 
to the growth, development, or functioning of the child;

o  the failure to provide a child with food, clothing, or shelter necessary to sustain the 
life or health of the child, excluding failure caused primarily by financial inability 
unless relief services have been offered and refused;

o  placing a child in or failing to remove the child from a situation in which the child 
would be exposed to an immediate danger of sexual conduct harmful to the child; or
o  placing a child in or failing to remove the child from a situation in which the child 
would be exposed to acts or omissions that constitute abuse under Tex. Fam. Code § 
261.001(1)(E), (1)(F), (1)(G), (1)(H), or (1)(K) committed against another child; 

•	 The failure by the person responsible for a child’s care, custody, or welfare to permit the 
child to return to the child’s home without arranging for the necessary care for the child 
after the child has been absent from the home for any reason, including having been in 
residential placement or having run away; or

•	 A negligent act or omission by an employee, volunteer, or other individual working under 
the  auspices  of  a  facility  or  program,  including  failure  to  comply  with  an  individual 
treatment plan, plan of care, or individualized service plan, that causes or may cause 
substantial emotional harm or physical injury to, or the death of, a child served by the 
facility or program as further described by rule or policy. 

Neglect does not include:

•	 The refusal by a person responsible for a child’s care, custody, or welfare to permit the 
child to remain in or return to the child’s home resulting in the placement of the child 
in the conservatorship of DFPS if:
o  the child has a severe emotional disturbance; 
o  the person’s refusal is based solely on the person’s inability to obtain mental health 

services necessary to protect the safety and well-being of the child; and

o  the person has exhausted all reasonable means available to the person to obtain the 
mental health services described by Tex. Fam. Code § 261.001(4)(B)(i)(b). Tex. Fam. 
Code § 261.001(4)(B)(i);

•	 Allowing the child to engage in independent activities that are appropriate and typical 
for the child’s level of maturity, physical condition, developmental abilities, or culture. 
Tex. Fam. Code § 261.001(4)(B)(ii). 

•	 Seeking a second opinion for a child’s medical care or transferring a child’s medical care 

to a new provider or facility. Tex. Fam. Code § 261.001(4)(B)(ii).

The DFPS Commissioner shall adopt rules to prohibit DFPS from making a finding of abuse or 
neglect against a person in a case in which DFPS is named managing conservator of a child who 
has a severe emotional disturbance only because the child’s family is unable to obtain mental 
health services for the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 261.002(b)(1); CPS Handbook §2391. 

Note:  While  often  misidentified,  a  case  in  which  a  parent  or  guardian  relinquishes 
custody to DFPS for the purpose of obtaining mental health services for their child is 
not a refusal to assume parental responsibility (RAPR) case. A RAPR is characterized 
as the failure by the person responsible for a child’s care, custody, or welfare to permit 
the child to return to the child’s home without arranging for the necessary care for the 
child after the child has been absent from the home for any reason. When a parent or 

71

II.Investigationsguardian has exhausted all other options, DFPS will discuss the option of temporarily 
relinquishing custody of their child to DFPS in order to obtain certain mental health 
services  to  address  the  child’s  severe  emotional  disturbance.  The  parent  or  guardian 
is  named  a  temporary  joint  managing  conservator  (TJMC)  along  with  DFPS  for  the 
purpose  of  obtaining  the  mental  health  services  the  parent  was  unable  to  obtain  for 
a  child  on  their  own  with  the  intent  to  have  the  child  return  home.  DFPS  may  enter 
a disposition on the allegation of neglect with regard to a RAPR but may not enter a 
disposition with regard to neglect on case involving a relinquishment to obtain mental 
health services. 

The refusal of a parent, guardian, or managing or possessory conservator of a child to administer 
or consent to the administration of a psychotropic medication to the child, or to consent to any 
other psychiatric or psychological treatment of the child, does not by itself constitute neglect of 
the child unless the refusal to consent:

•	 Presents a substantial risk of death, disfigurement, or bodily injury to the child; or 
•	 Has resulted in an observable and material impairment to the growth, development, or 

functioning of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 261.111(b). 

DEFINITION OF EXPLOITATION 

Tex. Fam. Code § 261.001(3)

“Exploitation” includes: 

•	 The illegal or improper use of a child or the child’s resources for monetary or personal 
benefit  or  profit  by  an  employee,  volunteer,  or  other  individual  working  under  the 
auspices of a facility or program as further described by rule or policy. 

PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR A CHILD’S CARE, CUSTODY, OR WELFARE
•	 A parent, guardian, managing or possessory conservator, or foster parent of the child;
•	 A member of the child’s family or household as defined by Tex. Fam. Code Chapter 71; 
•	 A person with whom the child’s parent cohabits;
•	 School personnel or a volunteer at the child’s school; or
•	 Personnel or a volunteer at a public or private child-care facility that provides services 
for the child or at a public or private residential facility where the child resides; or 
•	 An employee, volunteer, or other person working under the supervision of a licensed or 
unlicensed  child-care  facility,  including  a  family  home,  residential  child-care  facility, 
employer-based day-care facility, or shelter day-care facility, as those terms are defined 
in Tex. Hum. Res. Code Chapter 42. Tex. Fam. Code § 261.001(5).

Fourth Amendment Requirements in an Investigation
For any investigative action that involves entering or remaining in a home, transporting a child 
for an interview, or removing a child from a parent’s custody, DFPS must have consent, a court 
order, or exigent circumstances per Gates v. Tex. Dep’t of Protective & Regulatory Servs., 537 
F.3d 404 (5th Cir. 2008).

An evaluation of consent is based on the totality of the circumstances and under a standard of 

CONSENT

72

II. Investigations73

objective reasonableness. Silence or passivity cannot form the basis of consent to enter. Also, 
mere acquiescence to a show of lawful authority is insufficient to establish voluntary consent. 
Once consent is given, the consent may be limited, qualified, or withdrawn. Gates, 537 F.3d at 
420. 

COURT ORDER

If  a  caseworker  cannot  gain  consent,  they  may  seek  a  court  order  to  allow  entrance  for  an 
interview, examination, or investigation. Tex. Fam. Code § 261.303(b). For more information, 
see the Court Order in Aid of Investigation section of the tool kit. 

EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES

If there is not time to obtain a court order, however, DFPS can still enter or remain in a home, 
even absent consent, if there are exigent circumstances. Under this standard, there must be a 
reasonable cause to believe that the child is in immediate danger. Entering or remaining in the 
home for the sole purpose of interviewing the child does not suffice as reasonable cause. Gates, 
537 F.3d at 421-23.

Practice Tip: Before acting under exigent circumstances (without a court order), DFPS 
must  assess  the  nature  of  the  abuse,  whether  there  is  time  to  obtain  a  court  order, 
the strength of the evidence to support the allegations of abuse, the risk that a parent 
will flee with the child, alternative reasonable efforts available to prevent removal, and 
weigh the harm to the child that might result from removal versus the child remaining 
in their home. If there is time to obtain a court order granting the removal of a child, 
DFPS  should  not  enter  a  home  or  take  possession  of  the  child  without  first  seeking  a 
court order. Additionally, if there are alternatives available that will allow the child to 
safely remain in their home, the decision for an exigent removal would not be supported.  

or example: if a child made an outcry near the end of the school day about sexual abuse 
that was occurring regularly upon their return home from school, exigent circumstances 
might  exist  depending  on  the  circumstances.  If  the  alleged  perpetrator  was  the  only 
adult expected to be at the home that afternoon, the argument for exigent circumstances 
would exist since there would not be adequate time to obtain a court order before the 
child would be made to return home where the likelihood of abuse occurring would be 
imminent. Alternatively, if the alleged perpetrator was out of town, there would be time 
to conduct an investigation into the protective capacity of the other adults in the home 
and determine if other alternatives, such as requesting a “Kick-Out” order or obtaining 
a court order granting the removal of the child were available.

  F

Note: Tex. Fam. Code §§ 262.113, 262.1131, 262.201(b), and 262.201(j), which referred 
to non-emergency removals, were repealed from statute effective September 1, 2021. 

ANONYMOUS TIP

If the Department receives an anonymous report of child abuse or neglect, the Department shall 
conduct an investigation to determine whether there is any evidence to corroborate the report. 
Tex. Fam. Code § 261.304. The tip must be corroborated through a preliminary investigation 
that can include an interview of the child’s teachers or peers, an interview of the child at the 
school, or by looking for injuries on the child without removing any of the child’s clothing. An 
investigation can include a visit to the child’s home unless the alleged abuse or neglect can be 

II.Investigationsconfirmed or clearly ruled out without a home visit, an interview with and examination of the 
child, and an interview with the child’s parents. Tex. Fam. Code § 261.304(b). 

In  determining  whether  to  transport  the  child  to  another  location  for  the  interview,  the 
caseworker should take into account the child’s wishes. Gates, 537 F.3d at 424. A person who 
is notified of and attempts to interfere with the transportation can be charged with a Class B 
misdemeanor. Tex. Fam. Code § 261.302(f). 

Practice  Tip:  Like  a  Terry  stop  [Terry  v.  Ohio,  392  U.S.  1,  21-22  (1968)],  all  that  is 
required [to take a child into a separate room for an interview] is a reasonable suspicion 
of abuse or neglect so long as the interview is no more intrusive than necessary. Gates, 
537 F.3d at 434. Additionally, before transporting a child for an interview, DFPS must 
first attempt to notify the parent or other person having custody of the child. Gates, 537 
F.3d at 429. Absent consent to transport, DFPS may obtain a court order. In order to 
transport a child from a public school for an interview absent a court order or consent, a 
caseworker must have a reasonable belief that the child has been abused and probably 
will be abused again upon his return home at the end of the school day. Gates, 537 F.3d 
at 439.

IMMEDIATE REMOVAL

If, before an investigation is completed, the investigating agency believes that the immediate 
removal  of  a  child  from  their  home  is  necessary  to  protect  the  child  from  further  abuse,  or 
neglect, the investigating agency must file a petition or take other action under Tex. Fam. Code 
Chapter 262 to provide for the temporary care and protection of the child.  Tex. Fam. Code § 
261.302(d). For more information about removals, see the Removal of a Child section of this tool 
kit.

Note:  A  DFPS  investigator  must  notify  of  the  parent  of  the  right  to  make  an  audio 
recording  of  the  interview,  that  the  recording  is  subject  to  subpoena,  and  that  the 
parent may request a copy of DFPS recording policy. Tex. Fam. Code § 261.3027. The 
investigator  must  also  inform  the  parent  in  writing  before  conducting  the  interview 
that the parent may request an administrative review of DFPS findings, and the parent 
shall sign an acknowledgement of receipt. Tex. Fam. Code § 261.3091.

II. InvestigationsAlternatives to Removal of a Child

Separating  a  child  from  their  home  and  caregiver  can  be  very  traumatic  for  the  child. 
Considerations such as child safety and other factors related to the well-being of the child remain 
at the forefront of every potential removal decision, and the best response will be dependent 
upon the individual facts and available options associated with each case. 

Federal law requires that DFPS make reasonable efforts consistent with child safety to prevent 
or eliminate the need for removing a child from their home. Not all investigations and DFPS 
interactions with families lead to removal. By exploring alternative interventions, consistent 
with the circumstances and providing for the safety of the child, the opportunity exists to avoid 
the need for removal to foster care without jeopardizing child safety.

Below  are  examples  of  alternative  interventions  in  lieu  of  removal.  The  best  alternative  to 
removal will depend on the facts of each case and appropriate options available. 

THE INVESTIGATION OF THE FAMILY CANNOT BE COMPLETED

Court Order in Aid of Investigation

If a person interferes with an investigation of a family, or DFPS cannot access the child or the 
child’s records, DFPS may petition a court to order the following on a showing of good cause:

• Access to a home, school or any place where a child may be.
• A medical, psychological or psychiatric exam (or to obtain the records of such an exam).

Tex. Fam. Code §§ 261.303; 261.3031.

Practice Tip: If there is reason to believe that a parent or other caregiver may remove 
a child from the state (or another geographic limit) or may hide a child, the court can 
render a temporary restraining order if it finds DFPS has probable cause to conduct the 
investigation and there is reason to believe that the person may remove or hide the child. 
Motion and Affidavit are typically required. Tex. Fam. Code § 261.306.

THERE IS A SAFETY ISSUE, BUT THE FAMILY IS WILLING TO ENGAGE IN 
SERVICES

Safety Plans

A Safety Plan is a voluntary, short-term, written agreement between DFPS and adult family 
members  to  address  a  specific  threat  to  a  child  in  the  immediate  or  foreseeable  future.  The 
Safety Plan is meant to allow the child to remain safely in the home while the family works to 
address the identified concerns. The plan must be created with the family and be written in a 
practical, action-oriented manner, and acknowledge a family’s network of support. A petition 
for legal intervention is not filed with the court, and no court orders are entered in association 
with a Safety Plan, and as a result the plan is not legally binding. Safety plans are voluntary 
agreements, and a parent can revoke their agreement at any time. However, DFPS policy states 
if  the  family  is  unwilling  to  participate  in  a  safety  plan  to  address  dangers  to  the  child,  the 
caseworker must determine if it is necessary to remove the child from the home. CPS Policy 
Handbook § 12651. 

In a Safety Plan, a parent may agree to:

• Relocate to a safe environment, such as a shelter, with the child;
• Have their contact with the child supervised by a relative or fictive kin; or

75

II.Investigations• Place  a  child  in  a  short-term  placement  outside  the  home  (sometimes  referred  to  as
a  Parent-Child  Safety  Agreement  [PCSP])  if  the  family  determines  a  PCSP  is  more
workable than having a relative or fictive kin supervise parent-child contact.

Alternative Response (AR)

The AR program was created by DFPS to help families with low to moderate risk cases. In order 
to be considered for the program, all alleged child victims must be over the age of 6, and the 
intake must have received a designation of Priority 2 (P2). In an AR case, no final disposition, 
no alleged perpetrator, and no entry are made into the Central Registry. The goal is to provide 
a collaborative and non-judgmental environment to work with the family whose children are 
not in the managing conservatorship of DFPS to address concerns through services in order to 
prevent the need for further official intervention.

For more information, see the DFPS Alternative Response Resource Guide. 

Family-Based Safety Services (FBSS)

Family-Based Safety Services (FBSS) are designed to maintain children safely in their homes, 
or make it possible for children to return home, by strengthening the ability of families to protect 
their children and reducing threats to their safety. Children of families who are offered protective 
services  are  not  in  the  managing  conservatorship  of  DFPS.  Family  participation  in  FBSS  is 
voluntary and may include a written, signed Safety Plan that ensures the parent’s contact with 
the  child  is  supervised  until  the  danger  indicators  have  been  sufficiently addressed. Parents 
do not have to engage in or comply with the voluntary services; however, DFPS may initiate 
further legal intervention if it determines the lack of participation or compliance constitutes a 
danger to the child.  

THERE  IS  A  SAFETY  ISSUE,  BUT  THE  FAMILY  IS  UNWILLING  TO 
PARTICIPATE IN SERVICES

Court Order for Participation in Services/Motion to Participate (COS/MTP)

If a family has refused services or is not voluntarily cooperating with services provided or funded 
by DFPS, DFPS may seek a court order to require a parent to participate in services designed 
to  alleviate  the  effects  of  abuse  or  neglect  or  to  reduce  the  reasonable  likelihood  of  abuse  or 
neglect in the immediate or foreseeable future. Those services ordered by the court are provided 
by  FBSS.  A  parent’s  failure  to  comply  with  court  ordered  services  may  lead  to DFPS  filing a 
petition to remove a child and may be offered as evidence. See CPS Handbook § 2400 for more 
information on the relationship between FBSS and COS/MTP. For more information, see the 
Court Ordered Services section of this tool kit. 

THE FAMILY DETERMINES THAT AN ALTERNATIVE PLACEMENT IS MORE 
WORKABLE THAN A SUPERVISION PLAN

Parental Child Safety Placement (PCSP)

A  Parental  Child  Safety  Placement  (PCSP)  is  a  family-initiated,  temporary,  out-of-home 
placement made by a parent with a caregiver who is either related to the child or has a long-
standing and significant relationship with the child or family that may occur when the family 
determines  that  a  PCSP  is  more  workable  than  having  a  supervision  agreement  for  parent-
child contact. With a proper authorization agreement, a parent can give an adult caregiver of 
a child placed under a PCSP the authority to take action, including but not limited to medical 
consent,  school  enrollment,  consent  for  participation  in  school  and  sport  events,  applying  for

Practice Tip: Attorneys representing DFPS may consider subscribing to receive DFPS 
policy updates on PCSPs and all other CPS related policies. 

THE  INVESTIGATION  HAS  REVEALED  THAT  A  PROTECTIVE  PARENT  IS 
THE VICTIM OF FAMILY VIOLENCE

Order for Removal of an Alleged Perpetrator (“Kick-Out Order”)

It is well established that separating a child from their home and caregiver can be traumatizing. 
If  an  alleged  perpetrator  will  not  voluntarily  leave  the  home  and  if  the  remaining  parent  or 
caretaker of the child will make a reasonable effort to monitor and report any attempt by the 
alleged perpetrator to return to the home, a temporary restraining order could be used to remove 
the alleged perpetrator. It is a Class A Misdemeanor to violate this temporary restraining order. 
This order lasts for 14 days. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.1015. This timing allows a protective parent 
time to initiate a custody suit or seek a protective order. See the Protective Orders section in 
this tool kit.

A court may issue a temporary restraining order (also called a “kick-out order”) if the Department’s 
petition states fact sufficient to satisfy the court that:

•	 There is an immediate danger to the physical health or safety of the child or the child 

has been a victim of sexual abuse;

•	 There  is  no  time,  consistent  with  the  physical  health  or  safety  of  the  child,  for  an 

adversary hearing;

•	 The child is not in danger of abuse from the parent or other adult with whom the child 

will continue to reside in the residence of the child;

•	 The parent or other parent with whom the child will continue to reside in the home is 
likely to make a reasonable effort to monitor the residence and report to the Department 
and the appropriate law enforcement agency any attempt by the alleged perpetrator to 
return to the residence; and

•	 The issuance of the order is in the best interest of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.1015(b).

The order can be extended pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201(e). Tex. Fam. Code § 262.1015(d). 

Practice  Tip:  If  the  protection  of  the  child  requires  an  order  lasting  longer  than  14 
days, DFPS may file an application for a protective order on behalf of the child instead 
of or in addition to obtaining a temporary restraining order or may assist a parent or 
other adult with whom the child resides in obtaining a protective order. Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 262.1015(a-1). 

77

II.InvestigationsPractice Tip: If uncertain about whether to seek a protective order in addition to or in 
lieu of a Temporary Restraining Order, consider filing both petitions at the same time 
in order to only have to complete service on the alleged perpetrator once. The protective 
order hearing can always be passed if it is not necessary, and the temporary restraining 
order expires within 14 days. Current law allows the temporary ex-parte protective order 
to last up to 20 days with the ability to extend its duration for an additional 20 days at a 
time. Tex. Fam. Code § 83.002. 

Protective Orders

Domestic  violence  is  often  a  presenting  issue  in  child  welfare  cases.  If  a  parent  is  a  victim 
of  domestic  violence,  parents’  attorneys  may  want  to  consider  filing  for  a  protective  order  on 
behalf of their client to help demonstrate their protective capacity. Children’s attorneys may 
also consider filing for a protective order if the child is a victim. 

Filing

Any  adult,  including  a  parent  or  guardian,  who  is  acting  on  behalf  of  a  victim  of  an  offense 
under Texas Penal Code §§ 20A.02, 20A.03, 21.02,21.11, 22.011, 22.012, 42.072, or 43.05 may 
file an application for a protective order if the victim is younger than 18 years of age. Tex. Code 
of Crim. Pro. Art. 7B.001. A prosecuting attorney acting on behalf of the victim or adult who is 
acting on behalf of the victim may also file an application.

DFPS is specifically authorized to file an application for a protective order of any person alleged 
to be the victim of family violence. Tex. Fam. Code § 82.002(d)(2). 

Additionally, if not otherwise authorized to apply for a protective order under Tex. Fam. Code 
Chapter 82, DFPS may, on its own initiative or jointly with a parent, relative, or caregiver of 
the child, file an application for protective order for the protection of a child in their temporary 
managing conservatorship in certain cases of abuse or neglect. See Tex. Fam. Code § 261.501.

Ex Parte Protective Orders

While  awaiting  a  protective  order  hearing,  temporary  ex  parte  orders  issued  prohibit  a 
respondent from doing certain acts (such as causing emotional and physical abuse of the child) 
or going near the child or residence. DFPS can file such orders alone or jointly with another 
protective person. 

Practice  Tip:  If  the  court  finds  from  the  information  contained  in  an  application  for 
a  protective  order  that  there  is  a  clear  and  present  danger  of  family  violence,  it  may, 
without further notice or hearing, enter a temporary ex parte order for the protection 
of the applicant or any other member of the applicant’s family or household. Tex. Fam. 
Code § 83.001. The temporary ex parte order is valid for no more than 20 days and may 
be extended by additional 20-day periods. Tex. Fam. Code § 83.002.

Required Findings for Issuance of Protective Order

A victim of family violence may be issued a protective order upon a finding that family violence 
has  occurred  and  is  likely  to  occur  again  in  the  future.  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  85.001.  Except  as 
otherwise provided by statute, a protective order is effective for the period stated in the order, 

78

II. Investigationsnot to exceed two years or, if not stated in the order, until the second anniversary of the date the 
order was issued. Tex. Fam. Code § 85.025.

Obtaining  a  protective  order  does not require proof of any visible marks or bruises and, in a 
hearing for a protective order, a statement made by a child 12 years old or younger describing 
alleged  family  violence  is  admissible  in  the  same  manner  as  provided  by  Tex.  Fam.  Code  § 
104.006. Tex. Fam. Code § 84.006. 

Upon a finding that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant is the victim of 
sexual assault or abuse, indecent assault, stalking, or trafficking, a court shall issue a protective 
order that includes a statement of the required findings. Tex. Code of Crim. Pro. Art. 7B.003. An 
offender’s conviction of or placement on deferred adjudication community supervision for any of 
the above offenses constitutes reasonable grounds. Tex. Code of Crim. Pro. Art. 7B.003. 

In  a  hearing  on  application  for  a  protective  order  under  the  Tex.  Code  of  Crim.  Pro.  Ch.  7B, 
a  statement  that  is  made  by  a  child  younger  than  14  years  of  age  who  is  the  victim  of  an 
offense under Tex. Penal Code §§ 21.02, 21.11, 22.011, 22.012, or 22.021, and that describes the 
offense committed against the child is admissible as evidence in the same manner that a child’s 
statement regarding the abuse against the child is admissible under Tex. Fam. Code § 104.006. 
Tex. Code of Crim. Pro. Art. 7B.004.

Duration

The temporary ex parte protective order may be issued for up to 20 days and may be extended 
for additional 20-day periods. Tex. Fam. Code § 83.002. After notice and hearing, a court may 
issue a protective order. A court may render a protective order sufficient to protect the applicant 
and members of the applicant’s family or household that is effective for more than two years if 
the court makes certain findings about the person who is the subject of the protective order. See 
Tex. Fam. Code § 85.025(a-1). Additionally, an application for protective order may be renewed. 
Tex. Fam. Code §§ 82.008, 82.0085.

A protective order issued under Tex. Code of Crim. Pro. Art. 7B.003, may be effective for the 
duration of the lives of the offender and victim or for any shorter period stated in the order. A 
parent or guardian may not file an application to rescind the protective order if the parent or 
guardian  is  the  alleged  offender  subject  to  the  protective  order.  Tex.  Code  of  Crim.  Pro.  Art. 
7B.007. 

The court shall issue a lifetime protective order if the offender is: 

•	 Convicted of or placed on deferred adjudication community supervision for an offense 

listed in Tex. Code of Crim. Pro. Art 7B.001(a)(1); and

•	 Required to register for life as a sex offender under Tex. Code of Crim. Pro. Art. 62. Tex. 

Code of Crim. Pro. Art. 7B.007(a-1).

Enforcement

A violation of a protective order is a criminal offense. Tex. Fam. Code § 85.026; Tex. Code Crim. 
Pro. Art. 7B.006.

79

II.InvestigationsPractice  Tip:  An  attorney  from  a  County  or  District  Attorney’s  Office  assigned  to 
represent DFPS is not prohibited from filing an application for a protective order on behalf 
of  an  individual  who  has  been  served  in  a  child  welfare  suit.  However,  a  prosecutor’s 
office is not required to file a protective order application on behalf of an individual if 
they find doing so to be a conflict or if the request for a protective order does not meet the 
prosecuting office’s qualifications for filing. Applicants should be advised that they are 
mandated to report information shared related to abuse or neglect of a child. 

Practice  Tip:  If  there  is  a  concurrent  criminal  case  filed  based  on  the  facts  that  led 
to  a  request  for  the  removal  of  a  child  from  their  home,  it  is  likely  that  the  attorney 
representing DFPS in the child welfare matter will not be the same attorney responsible 
for the criminal case. Additionally, the judge presiding over the criminal matter may be 
different from the judge presiding over the child welfare case. It is important to know 
about any protective orders or bond conditions that may be issued in the criminal case to 
avoid conflicting orders in the civil CPS case.  

THE  INVESTIGATION  OR  CIRCUMSTANCES  HAVE  REVEALED  A  NEED 
TO HOLD A CHILD WITH THE INTENT TO RETURN THE CHILD TO A FIT 
PARENT OR GUARDIAN

Taking Possession of Child in an Emergency with Intent to Return Home 

An  authorized  representative  of  DFPS,  law  enforcement,  or  a  juvenile  probation  officer  may 
take  temporary  possession  of  a  child  for  up  to  five  days  without  a  court  order  when  there  is 
a danger to the child’s physical health or safety when the sole purpose is to deliver the child 
without unnecessary delay to a parent, managing conservator, or other person who is presently 
entitled to possession of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.110.

If the parent or other person entitled to possession does not take possession by the end of the 
fifth day, DFPS shall take action as if it took possession of the child in an emergency without a 
court order pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code § 262.104. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.110(b). 

Practice  Tip:  Encourage  investigative  caseworkers  to  begin  writing  their  affidavit 
in  support  of  a  removal  pursuant  to  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  262.104  while  the  facts  of  the 
investigation are still fresh in their mind. Then, if after taking possession of a child in an 
emergency with intent to return the child home, it appears that a parent or other person 
entitled to possession of a child will not be able to take possession by the end of the fifth 
day that the child is in the possession of DFPS, the caseworker should be able to quickly 
add the new facts in support of the petition for removal and submit it for filing.

80

II. InvestigationsRemoval of a Child

If  during  the  course  of  the  investigation  it  is  deemed  necessary  take  possession  of  a  child  to 
ensure their safety, DFPS has two options: 

•	 Seek a court order authorizing the removal of the child prior to taking possession of the 

child; or

•	 Take possession of the child in an emergency without a court order. 

FILING A PETITION BEFORE TAKING POSSESSION OF A CHILD

An  original  suit  filed  by  DFPS  requesting  permission  to  take  possession  of  a  child  without 
prior notice and hearing must be supported by an affidavit sworn to by a person with personal 
knowledge and stating facts sufficient to satisfy a person of ordinary prudence and caution that:

•	 There is an immediate danger to the physical health or safety of the child or the child 

has been a victim of neglect or sexual abuse; 

•	 Continuation in the home would be contrary to the child’s welfare;
•	 There  is  no  time,  consistent  with  the  physical  health  or  safety  of  the  child,  for  a  full 

adversary hearing; and

•	 Reasonable  efforts,  providing  for  the  safety  of  the  child,  were  made  to  prevent  or 

eliminate the need for the removal of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.101.

FILING  A  PETITION  AFTER  TAKING  POSSESSION  OF  A  CHILD  IN  AN 
EMERGENCY 

When a child is taken into possession without a court order, the person taking the child into 
possession, without unnecessary delay, shall:

•	 File a suit affecting the parent-child relationship;
•	 Request the court to appoint an attorney ad litem for the child; and
•	 Request an initial hearing to be held by no later than the first business day after the 

date the child is taken into possession. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.105(a).

An  original  suit  filed  by  a  governmental  entity  after  taking  possession  of  a  child  under  Tex. 
Fam.  Code  §  262.104  must  be  supported  by  an  affidavit  stating  facts  sufficient  to  satisfy  a 
person of ordinary prudence and caution that, based on the affiant’s personal knowledge or on 
information furnished by another person corroborated by the affiant’s personal knowledge, one 
of the following circumstances existed at the time the child was taken into possession:

•	 There was an immediate danger to the physical health or safety of the child;
•	 The child was the victim of sexual abuse or of trafficking under Section 20A.02 or 20A.03, 

Penal Code;

•	 The parent or person who had possession of the child was using a controlled substance as 
defined by Chapter 481, Health and Safety Code, and the use constituted an immediate 
danger to the physical health or safety of the child; or

•	 The parent or person who had possession of the child permitted the child to remain on 

premises used for the manufacture of methamphetamine; and

•	 Based on the affiant’s personal knowledge:

o  continuation of the child in the home would have been contrary to the child’s welfare;
o  there was no time, consistent with the physical health or safety of the child, for a full 

81

II.Investigationsadversary hearing under Subchapter C; and

o  reasonable efforts, consistent with the circumstances and providing for the safety of 
the child, were made to prevent or eliminate the need for the removal of the child. 
Tex. Fam. Code § 262.105(b).

Practice Tip: In reviewing affidavits in support of removal, ensure that the caseworker 
includes  all  non-removal  options  that  were  considered  and  offered  to  the  family  and 
the reason why those alternatives were not sufficient to ensure the safety of the child. 
The  caseworker  should  be  able  to  testify  as  to  these  efforts  in  support  of  a  finding  on 
the  record  that  reasonable  efforts  were  made  to  avoid  the  removal.  Additionally,  the 
caseworker should testify as to reasonable efforts made after the removal of a child from 
their home to eliminate the need for the continued removal of the child from the home. 
For more information, see the Reasonable Efforts section of this tool kit. 

NOTICE REQUIREMENT

DFPS must give written notice to each parent of the child or to the child’s conservator or legal 
guardian when a representative of DFPS or other agency takes possession of a child. Tex. Fam. 
Code § 262.109(a). 

The written notice must be given as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than the first 
business day after the date the child is taken into possession. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.109(b).

The written notice requirements must include, among other things:

•	 The reasons why the child was removed;
•	 Contact information for the caseworker;
•	 A summary of legal rights; and
•	 A  statement  that  the  parent  has  the  right  to  hire  an  attorney.  Tex.  Fam.  Code  § 

262.109(c).

The court may, but is not required to, waive the required notice under special circumstances, 
such as:

•	 The inability to locate the parent or caretaker;
•	 The child is an abandoned infant delivered to an emergency care provider; or 
•	 For other good cause. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.109(d). 

INFORMATION PROVIDED TO RELATIVES AND CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS

When DFPS takes possession of a child under Tex. Fam. Code Chapter 262, DFPS shall provide 
information in writing to each adult who DFPS is able to identify and locate and who is:

•	 Related to the child within the fourth degree of consanguinity;
•	 An  adult  relative  of  the  alleged  father  if  DFPS  has  a  reasonable  basis  to  believe  the 

alleged father is the child’s biological father; or 

•	 Identified as a potential relative or designated caregiver as defined by Tex. Fam. Code § 
264.751 on the proposed Child Placement Resources form provided under Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 261.307 and may provide information regarding an adult who DFPS determines has a 
long-standing and significant relationship with the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.1095(a). 

82

II. Investigations•	 The written notice must include, among other things:
o  notice that the child is in the state’s custody;
o  options  available  for  participation  in  the  care  and  placement  and  support  of  the 
family,  the  methods  by  which  the  individual  may  exercise  those  options,  and  any 
requirements  the  individual  must  satisfy  to  exercise  those  options,  including  the 
requirement that the individual be evaluated by the DFPS under Tex. Fam. Code § 
262.114 before the individual may serve as a substitute caregiver; and the deadlines 
before which the individual must respond to exercise those options;

o  options that may be lost if the individual fails to timely respond;
o  the date, time, and location of the Status Hearing, if applicable; and 
o  information regarding the procedures and timeline for a suit affecting the parent-

child relationship. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.1095(b). 

DFPS is not required to provide information to a person who has criminal or family violence 
history. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.1095(c). 

DFPS  must  provide  the  information  immediately  after  the  person  has  been  identified  and 
located. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.1095(d-1). 

DFPS must use due diligence to identify and locate all individuals described by Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 262.1095(a) within 30 days of the date DFPS files the SAPCR. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.1095(d). 
The failure of a parent or alleged father to complete the Child Placement Resources form does not 
relieve DFPS of its duty to seek information about persons under Tex. Fam. Code § 262.1095(d). 
Tex. Fam. Code § 262.1095(e).

Court  Ordered  Services  (COS)  is  also  referred  to  as  Required  Participation  or  a  Motion  to 
Participate (MTP). 

STATUTE

Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203

PURPOSE

BURDEN OF PROOF

To  determine  whether  the  family  is  in  need  of  services  to  address  allegations  of  abuse  and 
neglect and alleviate a continuing danger to the child. 

Evidence  sufficient  to  satisfy  a  person  of  ordinary  prudence  and  caution.  Tex.  Fam.  Code  § 
264.203(m).

REQUIREMENTS FOR FILING A PETITION

DFPS may file a suit in the county in which the child is located requesting the court to render a 
temporary order requiring the parent, managing conservator, guardian, or other member of the 
child’s household to participate in services for:

•	 Alleviating the effects of the abuse or neglect that has occurred;
•	 Reducing a continuing danger to the physical health or safety of the child or reducing 
a substantial risk of abuse or neglect caused by an act or failure to act of the parent, 
managing conservator, guardian, or other member of the child’s household; and

•	 Permitting the child and any siblings of the child to receive services. Tex. Fam. Code § 

The petition must be supported by a sworn affidavit by a person based on personal knowledge 
and stating facts sufficient to support a finding that:

•	 The  child  has  been  a  victim  of  abuse  or  neglect  or  is  at  substantial  risk  of  abuse  or 

264.203(a).

neglect; and

•	 There is a continuing danger to the physical health or safety of the child caused by an 
act or failure to act of the parent, managing conservator, guardian, or other member 
of the child’s household unless that person participates in services requested by DFPS. 
Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(d).

APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL

•	 Immediately after the filing of a petition for court ordered services but before the 14-day 
hearing, the court must appoint counsel for the child(ren) and counsel for a parent for 
whom participation in services is requested. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(g) and (h). 
•	 A parent who is indigent and appears in opposition to the motion has a right to a court-
appointed attorney. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(i)(2). The court is not required to appoint 
an attorney for a parent who is not asked to participate in services or any non-parent 
who is asked to participate in services. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(h).

•	 In court ordered services cases, court-appointed attorneys for children have the powers 
and duties under Tex. Fam. Code §§ 107.003 and 107.004 and court-appointed attorneys 
for parents have the powers and duties under Tex. Fam. Code § 107.0131.

•	 If a parent is found indigent, the court-appointed attorney may continue to represent the 

87

III. Statutory Hearingsparent. If the court determines that a parent is not indigent the court must discharge 
the  attorney  ad  litem  after  the  hearing  and  must  order  the  parent  to  pay  the  cost  of 
the  attorney  ad  litem’s  representation.  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  264.203(j).  The  court  may 
postpone any subsequent proceeding for up to seven days after discharge to allow the 
parent time to hire counsel. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(k).

EX PARTE ORDERS PROHIBITED

•	 An order for required participation can be entered only after notice and a hearing. Tex. 

Fam. Code § 264.203(l). 

14-DAY HEARING 

•	 The court must set a hearing no later than 14 days after the date the petition was filed 
unless the court finds good cause to extend that date for not more than 14 days. Tex. 
Fam. Code § 264.203(f). 

PROSECUTOR PREPARATION

Attorneys  representing  DFPS  should  be  familiar  with  the  burden  of  proof  applicable  at  each 
hearing. Please see the Burden of Proof section of this tool kit for more information. 

Before Filing the Petition: 

Prior to the Hearing:

•	 Ensure that the affidavit contains sufficient facts to support a finding that the child has 
been a victim of abuse or neglect or is at substantial risk of abuse or neglect, and there 
is a continuing danger.

•	 Ensure that attorney ad litems have been appointed for the child/ren and the parent(s) 

for whom participation is being requested.

•	 Ensure that service has been requested on all parties. 
•	 Meet with DFPS caseworker and prepare for the hearing.

At the Hearing:

•	 Present sufficient evidence to satisfy the court that rendering an order for court ordered 

services as to each of the requested parties is necessary. 

•	 Ensure that the services being requested are specific and narrowly tailored. 

REQUIRED SHOWING

At the conclusion of the hearing, the court must deny the petition unless the court finds: 

•	 An act or failure to act of the parent, managing conservator, guardian, or other member 

of the child’s household resulted in:
o  abuse or neglect of the child; or
o  a substantial risk of abuse or neglect to the child; or
o  continuing danger to the physical health or safety of the child; and 

•	 Services are necessary to ensure the physical health or safety of the child. Tex. Fam. 

Code § 264.203(m).

88

III. Statutory HearingsCOURT ACTION 

Before the hearing begins, the court must inform each parent of their right to an attorney and 
to a court-appointed attorney, if indigent. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(i).

If DFPS meets their required showing, the court must:

•	 State its findings in the order;
•	 Make appropriate temporary orders under Chapter 105 necessary to ensure the safety 

of the child; and 

•	 Order  the  participation  in  specific  services  narrowly  tailored  to  address  the  findings 

made by the court. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(n).

The court may not require a parent to participate in services if that parent/party did not cause 
the alleged abuse or neglect, the substantial risk of abuse or neglect, or the continuing danger 
to the child. 

Once  services  are  ordered,  a  parent  may  obtain  services  from  a  qualified  service  provider  of 
their own selection. After obtaining verification of completion of the service from the provider 
selected by the parent, DFPS must accept the verification as proof of successful completion of 
the service. However, if the parent selects their own provider, the parent is responsible for the 
cost of the services. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.2031.

Practice Tip: An order to participate can only be entered after notice and hearing. This 
means that the parent(s) must be served with notice of the hearing. Keep in mind that 
the court cannot order a parent/party to participate in services who did not cause the 
continuing danger, substantial risk of abuse or neglect, or who was not the perpetrator 
of abuse or neglect alleged. 

SAFETY PLANS

A family in a court ordered services case may already have a Safety Plan with DFPS as part of 
the investigation or ongoing FBSS case and the status of the Safety Plan may become an issue 
in the court ordered services case. For more information, see the Alternatives to Removal of a 
Child section of this tool kit for more information on DFPS Safety Plans.

The  court  is  not  authorized  to  incorporate  compliance  with  a  safety  plan  in  its  orders,  but 
the court may make its own orders regarding the child’s safety. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(n) 
provides  that  if  a  court  renders  an  order  granting  the  Department’s  petition  the  court  shall 
“make appropriate temporary orders under Chapter 105 necessary to ensure the safety of the 
child….”

Texas Family Code §105.001 provides that a court may make a temporary order, including the 
modification  of  a  prior  temporary  order,  for  the  safety  and  welfare  of  the  child,  including  an 
order: 

•	 For the temporary conservatorship of the child; 
•	 For the temporary support of the child; 
•	 Restraining a party from disturbing the peace of the child or another party; 
•	 Prohibiting a person from removing the child beyond a geographical area identified by 

the Court; or 

89

III. Statutory Hearings•	 For payment of reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses. 

Practice Tip: With proper notice and pleadings, courts may temporarily place a child 
with  another  party  and/or  make  other  appropriate  orders  pursuant  to  Chapter  105, 
provided the Court’s orders are necessary to ensure the safety of the child. These orders 
would be limited to 180 days pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(q) unless extended 
pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(r) or (s). 

REVIEW HEARINGS

The court must review the status of each person required to participate in services within 90 
days after the date the court renders the order. The court shall set subsequent review hearings 
every 90 days to review the continued need for the order. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(p).

An order for required participation expires on the 180th day after the date the order is signed 
unless  extended  as  provided  by  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  264.203(r)  or  (s).  Any  party  can  request 
termination of the order at any time. The court shall terminate the order on a finding the order 
is no longer needed. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(t).

EXTENSION 

A court ordered services case may be extended up to an additional 180 days from the original 
expiration date upon a showing by DFPS of a continuing need for the order, after notice and 
hearing. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(r).

The Court may extend an order up to an additional 180 days only if the extension is requested 
by the person required to participate in services or that person’s attorney and the Court finds:

•	 The extension is necessary to allow the person time to complete ordered services; and
•	 The Department made a good faith effort to timely provide the services to the person; 

•	 The person made a good faith effort to complete the services; and 
•	 The completion of the services is necessary to ensure the physical health and safety of 

•	 The  extension  is  requested  by  the  person  or  the  person’s  attorney.  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §

III. Statutory HearingsEx Parte Hearings

Ex Parte Order Prior to Removal of Child
STATUTE

Tex. Fam. Code § 262.102 

PURPOSE 

BURDEN OF PROOF

BEST INTEREST

To determine whether a court will authorize in advance the removal of a child and grant DFPS 
temporary  managing  conservatorship  (TMC)  of  the  child  until  an  Adversary  Hearing  can  be 
held.

Evidence sufficient to satisfy a person of ordinary prudence and caution.

Best Interest of the child is always the primary consideration in determining conservatorship, 
possession, and access. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002.

REQUIRED SHOWING FOR EX PARTE ORDER BEFORE
REMOVAL HEARING

DFPS must submit sufficient evidence to prove:

•	 Either that there is an immediate danger to the physical health or safety of the child, or 

that the child has been a victim of neglect or sexual abuse;*

•	 That continuation in the home would be contrary to the child’s welfare; and
•	 That  there  is  no  time,  consistent  with  the  child’s  physical  health  or  safety  and  the 

nature of the emergency, to hold an Adversary Hearing; and

•	 That reasonable efforts consistent with the circumstances and providing for the safety of 
the child, were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal. Reasonable efforts to 
prevent removal from the parent’s custody are not required if the parent has subjected 
the child to aggravated circumstances as defined by Tex. Fam. Code § 262.2015. Tex. 
Fam. Code § 262.102.

* This determination may not be based solely on the opinion of a medical professional under 
contract with DFPS who did not conduct a physical examination of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 
262.102(b-1).

DEFINITION OF “HOME”

The federal Administration of Children and Families defines “home” as the adult from whom the 
child is legally removed. In other words, home means parental custody, not physical location. 
The definition of “home” does not change regardless of where the child is living. 

Practice Tip: When DFPS files a petition seeking possession of a child, the court must 
make the findings regarding reasonable efforts, contrary to the welfare, and continuing 
danger as they relate to the parent or adult who is entitled to legal custody of the child, 
not the person who has physical custody. 

91

III. Statutory HearingsCOURT ACTION

If the court finds that DFPS made the required showing the court must:

•	 Issue an ex parte order for protection of the child;
•	 Appoint an attorney ad litem, a guardian ad litem, and authorized medical consenter 

for the child; and

•	 Set the Adversary Hearing within 14 days, unless the court finds good cause to postpone 

the hearing pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201.

Practice  Tip:  Prepare  the  caseworker  ahead  of  time  to  be  able  to  testify  from  their 
personal  knowledge  about  the  reasonable  efforts  which  DFPS  made  before  requesting 
removal of the child. Be prepared to rebut any objections to hearsay within the Affidavit 
of Removal.

Practice Tip: Any medical expert contracted by DFPS must have examined the child 
for the court to rely upon their medical opinion to issue an emergency order. Tex. Fam. 
§ 262.102 (b-1).

Practice Tip: Attorneys for parents and children are not required to be appointed prior 
to the Ex Parte Hearing and their attendance is not required at the Ex Parte Hearing. 
However, in some circumstances an attorney may already be appointed when an Ex Parte 
Hearing occurs. This may occur if the attorney has been appointed as part of a Court 
Ordered Services case under Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203 and a new referral alleging abuse 
or neglect is the reason DFPS is seeking removal, or if DFPS is seeking to remove a child 
born during the pendency of an existing case filed under Chapter 262. If a parent’s or a 
child’s attorney is appointed or retained prior to the Ex Parte Hearing, it is best practice 
to notify the attorney of the new filing and the ex parte hearing. It is not required that 
the  ex  parte  hearing  be  rescheduled  if  the  attorney  is  not  available  to  attend,  but,  in 
some jurisdictions, the court may choose to do so. 

INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT (ICWA)

A court can order emergency removal of an “Indian child” only if necessary “to prevent imminent 
physical damage or harm to the child.” 25 C.F.R. § 23.113(d). This must be followed by a noticed 
hearing where DFPS must prove by clear and convincing evidence, including testimony from 
a Qualified Expert Witness (QEW), that a “foster care placement” is warranted. This hearing 
cannot be held until 10 days after notice of ICWA has been provided and is subject to a 20-day 
extension on request of a parent or Tribe.

Practice Tip: When seeking an order for the emergency removal of an “Indian child,” 
DFPS  must  submit  an  ICWA  removal  affidavit  which  conforms  to  the  heightened 
removal requirements. An ex parte removal must be terminated as soon as it is no longer 
necessary to prevent the imminent physical harm to the “Indian child.” 

92

III. Statutory HearingsContinuing an Ex Parte Hearing to Comply with ICWA Notice Requirement

An ex parte proceeding should not be continued for more than 30 days unless the court finds: 

•	 Returning the child to the parent or Indian custodian would subject the child to imminent 

physical damage or harm; 

•	 The court has been unable to transfer the proceeding to the appropriate Tribe; and 
•	 It has not been possible to initiate a “child-custody proceeding.” 

Practice Tip: To avoid the need to continue the hearing, the best practice is to set this 
hearing out with at least 30 days’ notice. For more information, see the ICWA section of 
this tool kit.

Termination of Ex Parte Removal Under ICWA

An ex parte removal will terminate on the following conditions: 

•	 Filing of a child-custody proceeding, 
•	 Transfer of the case to the Tribe’s jurisdiction, or 
•	 Return of the child to the parent or Indian custodian. 

If  a  child  is  not  returned  home  or  the  case  is  transferred  to  the  Tribe,  all  proceedings  must 
comply with ICWA. 

If a party asserts or the court has reason to believe an “Indian child” may have been improperly 
removed or retained, the court must terminate the proceedings unless returning the child would 
subject the child to “substantial and immediate danger or threat of such danger.” 25 C.F.R. § 
23.113(a) and (c).

Practice  Tip:  Due  to  the  pending  U.S.  Supreme  Court  case  on  ICWA  (Brackeen  v. 
Haaland, 994 F.3d 249 (5th Cir. 2021), continued application of ICWA provisions may 
prevent DFPS cases from being reversed in the event that the law is upheld. 

PROSECUTOR PREPARATION

Before the ex parte hearing, the prosecutor must:

•	 Review caseworker’s affidavit to assess the sufficiency of the evidence;
•	 Prepare and file the appropriate petition with affidavit; 
•	 If parties have attorneys, notify the attorneys of the ex parte hearing; 
•	 If an ex parte order is granted, request that the clerk issue citation and notice of the 

adversary hearing; and

•	 If ICWA applies, send notification to the parent, Indian custodian and the child’s tribe 
by registered mail of the pending proceedings and the right to intervene. If no tribe or 
parent can be found or is unknown notice must be given to Secretary of the Interior. 25 
USCA §21 1912 (a). 

93

III. Statutory HearingsPractice Tip: If, at any point after filing a petition for removal of a child, DFPS learns 
that a child may be an “Indian child,” notice to the Tribe must be sent. The determination 
as to whether a child qualifies as a member of the Tribe is at the sole discretion of the 
Tribe. If not previously filed, an amended petition and affidavit containing the necessary 
ICWA  language  must  be  filed  upon  learning  that  a  child  is  an  “Indian  child”  and  the 
heightened burden of proof should be applied to all past hearings, as feasible, and must 
be applied to hearings going forward. 

Ex Parte Order After Emergency Removal of Child Without 
a Court Order
STATUTES

Tex. Fam. Code §§ 262.104, 262.105, 262.106, 262.107 

PURPOSE

There are limited circumstances when a DFPS caseworker, law enforcement officer, or juvenile 
probation officer may take possession of a child without a court order. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.104. 

When removal of a child without a prior court order is warranted, DFPS must then file a petition 
and affidavit with the court no later than the first business day after the date the child is taken 
into possession to request an initial hearing for the court to render orders necessary to protect 
the physical health and safety of the child. Tex. Fam. Code §§ 262.105, 262.106.

Evidence sufficient to satisfy a person of ordinary prudence and caution.

BURDEN OF PROOF 

BEST INTEREST 

EX PARTE HEARING 

Best Interest of the child is always the primary consideration in determining conservatorship, 
possession, and access. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002.

Under Tex. Fam. Code § 262.106 (b) if a full adversary hearing is not practicable, the initial 
hearing may be ex parte and proof may be by sworn petition and affidavit.

RETURN OF THE CHILD 

The child must be returned to the parent or guardian if the initial hearing is not timely held. 
Tex. Fam. Code § 262.106 (c). For the purposes of determining the first business day after the 
child  is  taken  into  possession,  the  child  is  considered  to  have  been  taken  into  possession  by 
DFPS on the expiration of the five-day period permitted under Tex. Fam. Code § 262.007 (c) or 
262.110 (b). Tex. Fam. Code §262.106(d). 

REQUIRED SHOWING

DFPS must submit sufficient evidence to prove:

•	 One of the following circumstances exist:

o  there is a continuing danger to the physical health or safety of the child; or 

94

III. Statutory Hearingso  that the child has been a victim of neglect or sexual abuse and is a substantial risk 

of future sexual abuse or trafficking; or

o  the parent’s use of a controlled substance constitutes an immediate danger to the 

physical health and safety of the child; or

o  the child has been permitted to remain on the premises used for the manufacture of 

methamphetamine; and

•	 That continuation in the home would be contrary to the child’s welfare; and
•	 That reasonable efforts, consistent with the circumstances and providing for the safety 
of the child, were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal. Tex. Fam. Code § 
262.107.

COURT ACTION

If the court finds that DFPS made the required showing the court must:

•	 Issue an ex parte order for protection of the child;
•	 Appoint an attorney ad litem, and a guardian ad litem for the child;
•	 Appoint a person authorized to consent to medical care; and
•	 Set the Adversary Hearing within 14 days, unless the court finds good cause to postpone 

the hearing pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code §262.201.

Practice  Tip:  Prepare  your  caseworker  ahead  of  time  to  be  able  to  testify  from  their 
personal  knowledge  about  the  reasonable  efforts  which  DFPS  made  before  requesting 
removal of the child.

Practice  Tip:  If  an  attorney  was  appointed  or  retained  by  a  party  to  the  suit  or  to 
represent the interests of a child prior to the removal, it is best to notify them as soon as 
possible of the intent to file a removal petition. 

ICWA 

A court can order emergency removal of an “Indian child” only if necessary “to prevent imminent 
physical damage or harm to the child.” 25 C.F.R. § 23.113(d). This must be followed by a noticed 
hearing where DFPS must prove by clear and convincing evidence, including testimony from 
a Qualified Expert Witness (QEW), that a “foster care placement” is warranted. This hearing 
cannot be held until 10 days after notice of ICWA has been provided and is subject to a 20-day 
extension on request of a parent or Tribe.

Practice Tip: When seeking an order for the emergency removal of an “Indian child,” 
DFPS  must  submit  an  ICWA  removal  affidavit  which  conforms  to  the  heightened 
removal requirements. An ex parte removal must be terminated as soon as it is no longer 
necessary to prevent the imminent physical harm to the “Indian child.” 

Continuing an Ex Parte Hearing to Comply with ICWA Notice Requirement

An ex parte proceeding should not be continued for more than 30 days unless the court finds: 

95

III. Statutory Hearings•	 Returning the child to the parent or Indian custodian would subject the child to imminent 

physical damage or harm; 

•	 The court has been unable to transfer the proceeding to the appropriate Tribe; and

Practice Tip: To avoid the need to continue the hearing, the best practice is to set this 
hearing out with at least 30 days’ notice. Please see the ICWA section of this tool kit for 
more information. 

Termination of Ex Parte Removal under ICWA

An ex parte removal will terminate on the following conditions: 

•	 Filing of a child-custody proceeding, 
•	 Transfer of the case to the Tribe’s jurisdiction, or 
•	 Return of the child to the parent or Indian custodian. If a child is not returned home or 

the case transferred to the Tribe, all proceedings must comply with ICWA. 

If a party asserts or the court has reason to believe an “Indian child” may have been improperly 
removed or retained, the court must terminate the proceedings unless returning the child would 
subject the child to “substantial and immediate danger or threat of such danger.” 25 C.F.R. §

III. Statutory HearingsAdversary Hearing

STATUTE 

Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201

PURPOSE 

TIMING

BURDEN OF PROOF

BEST INTEREST

To  determine  whether  a  court  will  authorize  DFPS’  continued  Temporary  Managing 
Conservatorship of a child.

The hearing must be held not later than the 14th day after the date the child was taken into 
possession unless the court grants an extension. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201(a).

Evidence sufficient to satisfy a person of ordinary prudence and caution.

Best Interest of the child is always the primary consideration in determining conservatorship, 
possession, and access. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. At the Adversary Hearing, courts must place 
a child who is removed with a relative unless placement is not in the best interest of the child. 
Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201(n).

ICWA

The court must ask whether the child or family has Native American heritage and identify any 
Tribe at the Adversary Hearing. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201(f). DFPS must give notice to any 
identified Tribe and request that the Tribe confirm or deny the child’s status as an Indian child.

If a Tribe confirms (or a court finds) that a child is an “Indian child,” please see the ICWA section 
of this tool kit for information on how ICWA requirements will affect the case going forward.

PROSECUTOR PREPARATION

Before the hearing, the prosecutor must:

•	 Review and assess evidence;
•	 On request from a parent or child’s attorney, provide names of witnesses DFPS intends 
to call (other than DFPS employees); a copy of any offense report to be used to refresh 
a  witness’s  testimony  and  a  copy  of  any  photo,  video  or  recording  to  be  presented  as 
evidence; Tex. Fam. Code § 262.014.

•	 Check status of service of citation (if citation by publication is necessary, the court may 
render a temporary order without waiting for publication Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201 (o)), 
check subpoenas for witnesses and records;

•	 Verify status of placement with a person named on the Child Placement Resource Form; 

•	 Confirm DFPS has asked about possible Native American heritage and the identity of 

Tex. Fam. Code § 262.114.

any tribe; and

•	 Verify DFPS’ recommendation regarding visitation, medical consent, or any other issue 

that may warrant court intervention.

97

III. Statutory HearingsPractice  Tip:  If  possible  at  this  stage,  check  the  status  of  the  Court  of  Continuing, 
Exclusive Jurisdiction (CCEJ) inquiry and determine if transfer is required, and request 
that the caseworker complete an Affidavit Regarding Military Service for any missing 
parent.

Practice  Tip:  Talk  with  the  Child  Protective  Investigations  (CPI)  caseworker  on  the 
day  of  the  hearing  as  well,  to  assess  if  any  new  information  or  witnesses  are  needed 
(a seven-day extension can be requested if more time is needed for a witness to appear 
voluntarily or through subpoena).

REQUIRED FINDINGS AT AN ADVERSARY HEARING

Findings Regarding the Parent from whom the Child was Removed. 

Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201(g). 

The court must return the child to the parent/conservator/guardian/custodian from whom the 
child was removed unless the court finds:

•	 There was a danger to the physical health or safety of the child which was caused by an 
act or failure to act of the person entitled to possession (that danger could include that 
the child would be a victim of trafficking under Tex. Penal Code §§ 20A.02 or 20A.03);

•	 That continuation in the home would be contrary to the child’s welfare;
•	 The  urgent  need  for  protection  required  immediate  removal  and  reasonable  efforts, 
consistent with the circumstances and providing for the safety of the child, were made 
to eliminate or prevent the child’s removal; and

•	 That reasonable efforts have been made to enable the child to return home, but there is 

a substantial risk of continuing danger to the child if the child is returned home. 

Findings Regarding the Parent Not Involved in the Circumstances Leading to 
Removal. 

Tex. Fam. Code §262.201 (g-1).

If the court finds it is not safe to return the child to the parent from whom the child was removed, 
the  court  shall  consider  any  other  parent,  managing  conservator,  possessory  conservator, 
guardian, caretaker, or custodian as a possible placement.

If the court finds this person did not cause the immediate danger to the physical health or safety 
of the child or was not the perpetrator of the neglect or abuse alleged in the suit, the court shall 
order possession of the child by that person unless the court makes specific findings as to each 
person entitled to possession: 

•	 The person cannot be located after exercise of due diligence or the person is unable or 

unwilling to take possession of the child; or

•	 Reasonable efforts have been made to enable the person’s possession of the child, but 
possession by that person presents a continuing danger to the physical health or safety 
of the child caused by an act or failure to act of the person, including a danger that the 
child would be a victim of trafficking under Tex. Penal Code §§ 20A.02 or 20A.03. 

98

III. Statutory HearingsCOURT ACTION

Upon making the necessary findings above, the court must enter temporary orders for protection 
and:

•	 Order placement of child with a relative unless that is not in the child’s best interest. 
•	 Ask all parties about Native American heritage and the identity of any Tribe(s);
•	 Give  parents  warning  about  parental  rights  and  responsibility  for  Child  Placement 
Resources  form  and  require  all  relatives  to  provide  information  to  locate  any  absent 
parent or relative; 

•	 Set a Status Hearing within 60 days of the date TMC is granted;
•	 Inquire from all parties whether the child has had the opportunity to provide information 
regarding potential caregivers and whether individuals identified by the child are listed 
on the proposed Child Placement Resources form; and

•	 Inform  relatives  serving  as  placement  for  a  child  of  the  ability  to  become  a  licensed 

foster parent and apply for Permanency Care Assistance (PCA).

RENEWING AND EXTENDING THE 14-DAY PERIOD

An Adversary Hearing must be held within 14 days because the temporary order authorizing 
emergency removal expires after 14 days in accordance with Tex. Fam. Code § 262.103. However, 
those orders can be extended before an Adversary Hearing is held. The temporary orders can be 
renewed and extended under the following circumstances:

•	 Upon a showing of good cause (defects in service, allowing time for the attorney for the 
child to visit with their client, court closure or docketing issues, etc.), the prosecutor can 
seek an order to extend the Temporary Injunction by up to 14 days and reschedule the 
hearing. Tex. R. Civ. P. 680;

•	 If an indigent parent appears in opposition to the suit and the court appoints an attorney, 
the orders can be extended by 7 days and the court may shorten or lengthen the time 
of the extension if the parent and the appointed attorney agree in writing [emphasis 
added]. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201(e);

•	 If  a  non-indigent  parent  requests  time  to  hire  an  attorney  or  to  provide  a  retained 
attorney  time  to  respond,  the  orders  can  be  extended  by  7  days  and  the  court  may 
shorten or lengthen the time of the extension if the parent and the attorney agree in 
writing [emphasis added]. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201 (e-1);

•	 No more than one extension of a temporary order may be granted unless subsequent 

extensions are unopposed. Tex. R. Civ. P. 680.

Practice Tip: Be wary of repeated renewals and extensions. Tex. R. Civ. P. 680 states 
that no more than one extension of a temporary order may be granted unless subsequent 
extensions  are  unopposed.  Though  a  court  will  not  lose  jurisdiction  if  the  Adversary 
Hearing is not held timely, a parent may seek mandamus to compel the court to hold the 
hearing. In the Interest of J.M.C., 109 S.W.3d 591, 595 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2003).

Practice Tip: With only 7 and 14-day extensions available, be sure to have all subpoenas 
out promptly and to question the caseworker immediately for any other possible witnesses 
you may want to subpoena.

99

III. Statutory HearingsSample Questions for the Caseworker (non-exclusive list):

•	 How did DFPS become involved with this child?
•	 What allegations were made that prompted DFPS’ involvement?
•	 Did DFPS investigate the allegations?
•	 What did the investigation reveal about the child and parents?
•	 What was the condition of the child when the CPI caseworker investigated?

Practice Tip: Make sure to cover the following topics at this hearing: 
•  Determine whether ICWA applies; 
•  Determine what visitation orders are appropriate; 
•  Determine whether a child support order is in place;

III. Statutory HearingsStatus Hearing

Tex. Fam. Code §§ 263.201, 263.202, 263.203

STATUTES 

PURPOSE

BURDEN OF PROOF

Preponderance of the evidence.

BEST INTEREST

To have a court review the status of the child and contents of the service plan, rule on requested 
modifications  to  the  service  plan,  and  enter  court  orders  necessary  to  implement  the  service 
plan.  Additional  goals  are  to  review  due  diligence  of  efforts  to  serve  parties,  locate  missing 
parents, notify relatives of a child’s removal, and review the child’s medical care.

Best Interest of the child is always the primary consideration in determining conservatorship, 
possession, and access. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002.

ICWA

The  court  must  ask  whether  the  child  or  family  has  Native  American  heritage  and  identify 
any tribe at the Status Hearing. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.201(f-1). DFPS must give notice to any 
identified tribe and request that the tribe confirm or deny the child’s status as an “Indian child.”

If a tribe confirms (or the court finds) that a child is an “Indian child,” see the ICWA section of 
this tool kit for information on how ICWA requirements will affect the case going forward. 

PROSECUTOR PREPARATION

Before the hearing, the prosecutor must ensure or confirm the following, especially if new parties 
have joined the suit or if absentee parties have been located:

•	 Confirm  DFPS  filed  notice  of  the  designation  of  the  child’s  education  decision-maker 
with the court and the child’s school within five days of the conclusion of the adversary 
hearing; Tex. Fam. Code § 263.004.  

•	 Check status of the inquiry on any courts of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction (CCEJ) 

and determine if transfer is required; Tex. Fam. Code §§ 155.101, 262.203.

•	 Request that the caseworker complete an Affidavit Regarding Military Service and an 

Affidavit of Diligent Efforts for any missing parent;

•	 Confirm DFPS has collaborated with each parent for whom the goal is reunification to 

develop a visitation plan. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.107. 

•	 Confirm whether DFPS was able to jointly develop the original service plan with the 
child’s  parents,  discuss  each  term  and  condition  of  the  service  plan  with  the  child’s 
parents, and obtain the signatures of the child’s parents on the service plan. Tex. Fam. 
Code § 263.103.

•	 Review proposed service plan for compliance with Tex. Fam. Code § 263.102;
•	 Confirm DFPS filed service plans not later than the 45th day after the rendering of the 
temporary  order  appointing  DFPS  as  temporary  managing  conservator  (TMC).  Tex. 
Fam. Code § 263.101; 

•	 Confirm DFPS has asked all persons about possible Native American heritage and the 

102

III. Statutory Hearingsidentity of any tribe;

•	 Calculate automatic dismissal date;
•	 File  any  necessary  motions,  including  a  motion  for  substituted  service,  with  enough 
time  to  provide  adequate  notice  to  all  parties  of  the  request  for  consideration  at  the 
upcoming hearing;

•	 Confirm that 10 days before the hearing, DFPS has filed:

o  a court report and has provided copies to everyone entitled to same;
o  information on DFPS efforts to identify, locate, or provide information to relatives 

and others regarding the removal; Tex. Fam. Code § 263.007;

o  information on the child’s medical care; 
o  copy of visitation plan; Tex. Fam. Code § 263.107(d); and
o  Child Placement Resources Form and any placement related documents that have 

not been filed with the court. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.003.

Practice Tip: Regarding the “O” Ground for Termination of Parental Rights: If failure to 
comply with service plan under Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(1)(O) is plead as a termination 
ground, all essential components of the plan must be specified and incorporated in the 
court order.

Practice Tip: Verification of a CCEJ is only directly mentioned as a duty to complete 
immediately after the Adversary Hearing; however, it is a matter that should continue 
to  be  reviewed  by  the  prosecutor.  The  consequences  of  not  having  verification  of  the 
CCEJ are severe and ongoing efforts should be made to ensure that the issue of CCEJ is 
resolved before attempting to render a final judgment.

REQUIRED SHOWING

The prosecutor must prove:

•	 Due diligence was exercised to locate and serve necessary persons, including an alleged 

father (whether or not he has registered with the paternity registry);

•	 Compliance with notice to relative requirements (Tex. Fam. Code § 262.1095); and
•	 The appropriateness of the service plan (Tex. Fam. Code § 263.202).

COURT ACTION

At the Status Hearing the court must:

•	 Assess  service  and  diligent  search  efforts  for  any  missing  parents  (including  alleged 

fathers);

•	 Appoint counsel as required and advise unrepresented parents;
•	 Ask all parties about Native American heritage and the identity of any Tribe(s);
•	 Make  specific  findings  and  orders  regarding  visitation,  service  plan,  medical  consent 

(and psychotropic medications if prescribed);

•	 Set a Permanency Hearing no later than 180 days after TMC is granted;

103

III. Statutory Hearings•	 Determine  whether  the  service  plan  is  narrowly  tailored  to  address  specific  issues 

identified by DFPS;

•	 Allow the parents the opportunity to comment on the service plan;
•	 Inquire from all parties whether the child has had the opportunity to provide information 
regarding potential caregivers and whether individuals identified by the child are listed 
on the proposed Child Placement Resources Form; and

•	 Inform  relatives  serving  as  placement  for  a  child  of  the  ability  to  become  a  licensed 

foster parent and apply for PCA.

Practice  Tip:  Depending  on  your  jurisdiction,  a  party  may  be  able  to  set  a  motion 
seeking  additional  relief,  such  as  a  contested  placement  change,  at  the  same  time  as 
the Status Hearing. If this occurs, prepare your caseworker for additional questioning 
related to the current placement, the proposed placement, and the reasons DFPS is not 
in support of the placement change. 

Sample questions for the Caseworker (non-exclusive list):

•	 Are  you  the  current  caseworker?  Have  you  determined  whether  there  are  any  prior 

court actions involving the child(ren) such as a prior removal?

•	 Have all the parties been served? What efforts are you making to locate all the parties? 
What is the status of diligent search efforts for any missing parents? If there is a motion 
on file with accompanying affidavit of diligent efforts, is DFPS requesting an order to 
grant substituted service? 

•	 Have the parents and /or any family members with knowledge been asked to complete 
an  ICWA  questionnaire?  Is  there  reason  to  believe  the  child  is  or  may  qualify  for 
membership of an Indian/Native American tribe? If so, has notice been sent?

•	 Has  a  service  plan  been  created?  Was  the  service  plan  created  in  collaboration  with 
the parents? Did DFPS review the service plan with the parents and did the parents 
sign the service plan? Why or why not? Has it been filed with the court? What are the 
identifiable services in the plan? Are the services narrowly tailored to address the needs 
of the family? Is DFPS asking that the service plan be made an order of the court?

•	 Where are the children placed and how are they doing? 
•	 If the child is in a foster home or residential setting, what actions has DFPS taken to 

locate a relative or fictive placement for the child? 

•	 Are there any relative or fictive kin caregivers who are willing and able to take the child 

•	 Has  the  child  been  asked  in  a  developmentally  and  age-appropriate  manner  about 

in?

possible placement options?

caregivers? 

remains stable?

•	 Are  there  any  concerns  about  placing  the  child  with  those  relatives  or  fictive  kin 

•	 What supports do the relative or fictive kin caregivers need to ensure that placement 

•	 Are the children receiving any psychotropic mediations? If so, what are the medications 
meant to treat and what is the dosage for each medication? When was the last medication 
review for the child? 

104

III. Statutory Hearings•	 How is the child doing in school? What activities are they involved in?
•	 What  reasonable  efforts  have  been  made  to  either  return  the  children  home  or  to  a 

relative/kinship placement?

•	 Should DFPS be maintained as TMC?
•	 Are these plans in the best interest of the child/ren in this case?

Before the hearing, research the following:

•	 Have family members been identified for placement?
•	 If a family member was identified as a proposed placement, but the child was not placed 
there,  what  were  the  reasons  for  declining  placement?  Was  the  placement  assessed 
pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code § 264.754?

•	 Have home studies been initiated? If the home study will be outside of Texas, it will 
involve the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) unless placement 
will be with a biological parent. Out of state home studies take significantly longer and 
must be started as soon as possible. Please see the ICPC section of this tool kit for more 
information. 

•	 Is  an  incarcerated  or  long-distance  parent  involved?  These  parents  have  the  right  to 
be  present  at  hearing,  and  the  prosecutor  will  need  to  get  contact  information  and 
potentially ask court about presence via phone or other means. Prisons require at least 
a 24-hour notice and a signed letter/order from the judge to appear.

At the Hearing:

•	 Ensure that the service plan is detailed with contact numbers and exact services to be 

completed with a timeframe to complete them.

•	 Make sure the service plan has been filed with the court and inquire whether the parents 
collaborated in the creation of the plan. Also discuss whether the parents reviewed the 
plan and signed it. Elicit testimony about why or why not. 

•	 Ask the court to adopt the service plan and make it an order of the court. At a termination 
proceeding where it is alleged that parents did not complete services, the court ordered 
plan can be introduced as evidence.

Tex. Fam. Code §§ 263.002, 263.302, 263.304, 236.305, 263.306

STATUTES 

PURPOSE

Review status of the child and the permanency plan to ensure that the final hearing (trial on the 
merits) can be commenced before the dismissal date.

BURDEN OF PROOF

Preponderance of the evidence.

BEST INTEREST

Best Interest of the child is always the primary consideration in determining conservatorship, 
possession, and access. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. Also, best interest arises at the Permanency 
Hearings before a final order as follows:

•	 At  each  Permanency  Hearing  before  a  final  hearing,  the  court  shall  make  a  finding 
on  whether  the  child’s  parents  are  willing  and  able  to  provide  the  child  with  a  safe 
environment  and  whether  the  return  of  the  child  is  in  the  child’s  best  interest.  Tex. 
Fam. Code § 263.306(a-1)(6). But see also Tex. Fam. Code § 263.002(c).

•	 The court shall consult with the child if the child is four years of age or older and if the 

court determines it is in the child’s best interest. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.302.

ICWA

Unless  the  court  has  made  a  finding  that  a  child  is  not  an  “Indian  child,”  the  court  must 
continue  to  ask  whether  the  child  or  family  has  Native  American  heritage  and  identify  any 
tribe, especially if new parties have appeared at this stage. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.306(a-1)(3).

Please  see  the  ICWA  section  of  this  tool  kit  for  information  on  how  ICWA  requirements  will 
affect the case going forward.

PROSECUTOR PREPARATION

Before the hearing, the prosecutor must ensure or confirm the following, especially if new parties 
have joined the suit or if absentee parties have been located:

•	 Check status of the inquiry on any courts of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction (CCEJ) 

and determine if transfer is required; Tex. Fam. Code §§ 155.101, 262.203.

•	 Request that the caseworker complete an Affidavit Regarding Military Service and an 

Affidavit of Diligent Efforts, if not already completed, for any missing parent;

•	 Confirm  DFPS  has  filed  information  on  DFPS  efforts  to  identify,  locate,  or  provide 
information  to  relatives  and  others  regarding  the  removal  (this  most  frequently  is 
included in the court report); Tex. Fam. Code § 263.007;

•	 Confirm DFPS has asked all persons about possible Native American heritage and the 

•	 File  any  necessary  motions  for  consideration  at  the  hearing  with  adequate  time  to 

•	 Confirm  DFPS  has  filed  any  amended  service  plan  that  has  been  created;  Tex.  Fam. 

identity of any tribe;

provide notice to all parties; 

Code § 263.104;

106

III. Statutory Hearings•	 Confirm that 10 days before the hearing, DFPS has filed:

o  a permanency plan for the child and has provided copies to each person entitled to 

notice under Tex. Fam. Code § 263.0021(b); Tex. Fam. Code § 263.3025;

o  a court report and has provided copies to everyone entitled to same; Tex. Fam. Code 

o  any  updates  regarding  the  child’s  education  decision-maker;  Tex.  Fam.  Code  § 

§ 263.303;

263.004(c);

o  any updates regarding the child’s medical consenter;
o  Child Placement Resources Form and any placement related documents that have 

not been filed with the court; Tex. Fam. Code § 263.003.

•	 Verify  notice  of  hearing  sent  and  the  status  of  search  efforts  for  any  missing  absent 

parent or relatives;

•	 Verify child will attend unless specifically excused by court (child in TJJD custody may 

appear by telephone or video); Tex. Fam. Code § 263.302; and

•	 Review the report and permanency plan for compliance with Tex. Fam. Code §§ 263.3025; 

263.303 and be prepared to address the issues the court must assess (below).

Practice  Tip:  While  certain  issues,  such  as  placement,  will  be  discussed  at  the 
permanency hearing, some courts may require a filed motion if a party intends to request 
a change of placement at the hearing. In some jurisdictions, these motions may require 
a separate hearing. 

REQUIRED SHOWING

This will vary depending on the circumstances, but will always focus on:

•	 If return of the child to the parent is not recommended, what evidence of safety and best 

interest warrants continued out of home placement;

•	 The  factual  basis  for  the  permanency  plan,  including  placement,  progress  toward 
reunification,  reasonable  efforts,  services,  visitation,  and  diligent  search  efforts  for 
any missing parties   and information about every aspect of the child’s care (medical, 
educational, social, normalcy activities); and

•	 The specific issues the court must review under Tex. Fam. Code § 263.306 (see below).

COURT ACTION

The court must:

•	 Order  the  return  of  the  child  to  a  parent  unless  the  court  finds  that  returning  the 
child to that parent presents a continuing danger to the child and the return would be 
contrary to the welfare of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.002(c); The order returning 
the child may be a monitored return under Tex. Fam. Code § 263.403. But see also Tex. 
Fam. Code § 263.306(a-1)(6). 

•	 Identify persons and parties present, review the status of service of process and search 
efforts, ask about Native American heritage and any Tribes the child is associated with, 
review compliance with temporary orders and service plan, as well as progress toward 
mitigating the need for foster care placement, and review DFPS efforts to provide the 

107

III. Statutory Hearingschild with regular, ongoing opportunities to engage in normalcy activities;

•	 Review  the  permanency  plan  to  assess  each  component  (child  safety  and  well-being, 
necessity for placement, appropriateness of permanency goals, whether the child has 
had  opportunity  to  express  opinion  on  any  medical  care,  compliance  with  specific 
requirements  if  psychotropic  medications  are  prescribed,  education  issues,  and 
transitional care issues);

•	 For a child with Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA):
o  a compelling reason why another plan is not in child’s best interest;
o  whether DFPS has conducted an Independent Living Skills (ILS) assessment;
o  whether DFPS has addressed the goals of the permanency plan, including a housing 

plan and the results of the ILS assessment;

o  for  youth  16  or  older,  whether  DFPS  has  provided  required  documents  per  Tex. 

Fam. Code §§ 264.121(e)(1),263.306(a-1)(5)(H)(v);

o  for youth 18 or older, or youth with disabilities of minority removed, whether DFPS 
has provided required documents; Tex. Fam. Code §§ 264.121(e-1), 263.306(a-1)(5) 
(H)(vi); and

o  for a child not placed with a relative or designated caregiver, review the placement 
and include in its findings a statement whether the child is placed with a relative or 
designated caregiver. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.002(b);

•	 Estimate a likely date for the child to be returned, adopted, or placed in PMC;
•	 Retain jurisdiction and permit the child to transition home under a transition monitored 
return while the parents complete services, or order a monitored return to parents if 
appropriate and in the child’s best interest;

•	 Set a subsequent Permanency Hearing date no more than 120 days later until a final 

order is rendered;

•	 Announce in open court the automatic dismissal date and the date of any subsequent 

hearings. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.306(a-1);

•	 Inquire from all parties whether the child has had the opportunity to provide information 
regarding potential caregivers and whether individuals identified by the child are listed 
on the proposed Child Placement Resources Form; and

•	 Inform  relatives  serving  as  placement  for  a  child  of  the  ability  to  become  a  licensed 

foster parent and apply for PCA.

Sample questions for the Caseworker: (non-exclusive list)

•	 What  efforts  have  been  made  to  locate  and  request  service  of  citation  on  all  persons 

entitled to service?

•	 Have all issues of paternity been resolved?
•	 Can the child safely return to the home?
•	 Is there a continuing necessity for placement, and is it appropriate and in the child’s 

best interest?

•	 Is the child placed with a relative or designated caregiver?
•	 If not, has the child been asked in a developmentally and age-appropriate manner about 
possible placement options? Have the parents or other family members identified any 

108

III. Statutory Hearingsnew potential placements if the child cannot be returned home?

•	 Are  there  any  concerns  about  placing  the  child  with  those  relatives  or  fictive  kin 

•	 What supports do the relative or fictive kin caregivers need to ensure that placement 

caregivers? 

remains stable?

•	 Are the children receiving any psychotropic mediations? If so, what are the medications 
meant to treat and what is the dosage for each medication? When was the last medication 
review for the child? 

•	 Are  there  any  other  plans  or  services  needed  to  meet  the  child’s  special  needs  or 

•	 Are the parents’ compliant with temporary orders and the service plan and what is the 

circumstances?

extent of their progress?

•	 How  are  the  child/ren  doing?  What  activities  are  the  child/ren  engaging  in  (age-
appropriate, normalcy  activities)? Have the child’s education-related needs and goals 
have been identified and addressed? What about medical, emotional, special needs?

•	 What are the articulated wants of the child/ren?
•	 Is there a need for additional services for the parents? Is DFPS requesting that these 

be made orders of the court?

•	 Is there a likely date by which the child may be returned home, adopted, or placed in 
permanent managing conservatorship (when do we expect completion of case, what is 
the permanency plan)?

•	 If the child is 14 or older, what services are needed for the transition to independent 

living?

•	 If the child is 16 or older, have you delivered the original or certified copies of personal 
documents (not  photocopies) which  include  Texas  Identification  card, birth certificate, 
Social Security card, and if child is not born in the United States, the child’s immigration 
or  citizenship  document  which  are  required  by  law?  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §§  264.121(e); 
263.306(a-1)(5)(H)(v).

•	 If  the  child  is  18  or  older  or  has  had  the  disabilities  of  minority  removed,  have  you 
delivered the original or certified copies of personal documents (not photocopies) which 
include Texas Identification card, birth certificate, Social Security card, and if child is 
not born in the United States, the child’s immigration or citizenship document which 
are required by law? Tex. Fam. Code §§264.121(e-1), 263.306(a-1)(5)(H)(vi).

•	 Has DFPS has made reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan, including the 
concurrent permanency goals (has the parent been offered rides, bus passes, assistance 
with setting up appointments, etc.)?

•	 If asking for monitored return to the child’s parents, are the child’s parents willing and 
able  to  provide  a  safe  environment?  Is  the  return  in  the  child’s  best  interest?  Is  the 
continuation of DFPS as the TMC in the best interest of the child?

•	 If  asking  for  an  extension  based  on  extraordinary  circumstances,  what  are  the 

circumstances that necessitate an extension?

SUBSEQUENT PERMANENCY HEARINGS

A subsequent Permanency Hearing before entry of a final order must be held within 120 days 
of the previous Permanency Hearing in the suit (although it can be held sooner than 120 days). 

109

III. Statutory HearingsAt such a hearing, the court reviews the progress of the parents, the status of the child, and the 
permanency goal.

Note: At the end of each permanency hearing before final order, the court must order 
DFPS  to  return  the  child  to  the  child’s  parent(s)  unless  it  finds,  with  respect  to  each 
parent, that there is a continuing danger to the physical health or safety of the child and 
returning the child to the child’s parent(s) is contrary to the welfare of the child. Tex. 
Fam. Code § 263.002 (c). However, this does not prohibit the court from rendering an 
order for a monitored return. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.002(d). 

Practice Tip: If the case can benefit from mediation, consider requesting that mediation 
by the parties prior to trial be ordered by the court. In addition, if helpful to obtaining 
a  final  agreement,  ask  that  any  non-parties  that  may  be  subject  to  a  final  order  be 
authorized to attend mediation. For example, if a grandmother may be named PMC of 
the children, it is best to have her sign off on the mediated settlement agreement (MSA) 
to indicate her willingness to do so. 

Dismissal Date Issues
CALCULATING THE AUTOMATIC DISMISSAL DATE

The  dismissal  clock  begins  to  run  on  the  date  when  the  court  first  grants  DFPS  temporary 
managing conservatorship (TMC). Unless the court has commenced the trial on the merits on 
that  dismissal  date,  with  few  exceptions  a  child  welfare  suit  filed  by  DFPS  is  automatically 
dismissed on the first Monday after the first anniversary of the date the court rendered an order 
appointing DFPS as TMC. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.401(a). 

Practice Tip: To avoid any possible appeal issue and any delay in permanency for the 
child or children the subject of the suit, schedule and be sure to commence the trial on 
the merits several weeks before the automatic dismissal date.

EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES

If  the  court  finds  that  extraordinary  circumstances  necessitate  the  child  remaining  in  DFPS 
temporary  managing  conservatorship  and  that  continuing  to  appoint  DFPS  as  temporary 
managing  conservator  is  in  the  child’s  best  interest,  the  court  may  grant  an  extension  of  no 
more than 180 days. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.401(b).

•	 The court must consider a parent’s good faith attempt to complete a drug rehab program 

when granting an extension of the deadline.

•	 The court shall find that extraordinary circumstances exist if: 

o  a parent has made a good faith effort to successfully complete the service plan but 

needs additional time, and 

o  on completion of the service plan the court intends to order the child returned to the 

parent. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.401(b-3).

110

III. Statutory HearingsPractice Tip: An agreement by the parties to seek an extension does not constitute a 
finding of extraordinary circumstances. Attorneys might exercise caution about relying 
on such an agreement, as the judge may still deny the extension if the court determines 
that extraordinary circumstances are not present.

Practice Tip: Waiting until the last minute to request an extension can risk the ire of 
the court. If there is no active trial setting before the original deadline and no time to 
obtain a setting when the request for the extension is made, the court can only grant the 
extension or allow the case to be dismissed. The court may disagree that extraordinary 
circumstances are present but no longer has the discretion to order the case to proceed 
to trial under the original deadline.

Practice Tip: An extension of the deadline under Tex. Fam. Code § 263.401 requires 
the  court  to  find  that  extraordinary  circumstances  necessitate  the  child  remaining  in 
conservatorship of DFPS. Technical issues that prevent a trial from commencing such 
as lack of notice, lack of service, or lack of a trial setting may equate to extraordinary 
circumstances. If a client opposes the extension, consider challenging the sufficiency of 
the evidence for granting an extension based on extraordinary circumstances.

MONITORED RETURN OR TRANSITION MONITORED RETURN 

Alternatively, the court may also retain jurisdiction and continue the TMC of DFPS and enter 
an order to:

•	 Return the child to the parent (a “monitored return”); or
•	 Transition the child to the home while the parent completes necessary services specified 
in the temporary order and order DFPS to remain as TMC and to monitor the child’s 
placement (a “transition monitored return”).

In the case of a monitored return, the court shall schedule a new dismissal date 180 days after 
the monitored return is ordered, regardless of whether the deadline has been extended. Under 
the transition monitored return, the deadline is still extended by 180 days, and after the 180 
days, the court may retain jurisdiction for an additional six months for the parent to complete 
services  specified  in  the  temporary  order,  unless  the  court  has  already  granted  an  extension 
under Tex. Fam. Code § 263.401(b).

If a child must be removed from the parent’s home or the court terminates a transition order 
during this period, the court must set a new dismissal date no later than the original dismissal 
date or 180 days after the child is moved, whichever is later. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.403.

111

III. Statutory HearingsTransition /Monitored Return

If the court has not granted an extension  
of the 12 month deadline under 263.401(b): 

The court can order a  
Regular Monitored Return  
under Section 263.403(a)(2)(A).

The court can order a  
Transition Monitored Return under 
Section 263.403(a)(2)(B).

Extends 180 days per  
Section 263.403(b).

The Family Code does not authorize 
any type of extension associated with 
a Monitored Return ordered pursuant  
to Section 263.403(a)(2)(A).  
Per Section 263.403(b), the court 
must schedule a new dismissal date 
not later than the 180th day after the 
court enters the order unless the court 
commences a trial on the merits.

Under Section 263.403(a-1), the 
Court can order an additional  
six months for the parent to complete 
the service requirements specified 
in the temporary order during a 
Transition Monitored Return granted 
pursuant to Section 263.403(a)(2)(B), 
but only if no extension under  
Section 263.401 was already granted. 

After an extension period has  
been granted pursuant to 263.401(b):

The court can order a  
Regular Monitored Return under 
either Section 263.403(a)(2)(A).

OR

The court can order a 
Transitioned Monitored Return 
under Section 263.403(a)(2)(B).

But the additional  
six months of 263.403(a-1)  
are not available.

112

III. Statutory HearingsA COURT ORDER IS REQUIRED TO EXTEND THE DISMISSAL DATE

Even  if  all  the  parties  agree  to  extend  the  dismissal  date,  the  deadlines  cannot  be  extended 
except by Court Order. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.402(a). The Supreme Court recently ruled that 
“Trial Courts should make the §263.401(b) findings in a written order as a matter of course, but 
we hold that the failure to do so is not error, provided the findings are made orally on the record 
or in some other writing.” In re G.X.H., 627 S.W.3d 288, 299 (Tex. April 30, 2021).

Practice Tip: Even if the parties agree, a judge can still overturn either of the above 
requests.

Practice Tip: Request your extension before passing on your last trial settings before 
the  case  deadline.  If  an  extension  is  requested  after  the  last  trial  setting  has  been 
passed, the judge has only the choice of granting the extension or allowing the case to 
be dismissed, denying the court its discretion to decline the extension request and have 
the case proceed to trial. Remember to have the judge sign a new scheduling order that 
reflects the new dismissal date and distribute to all parties.

113

III. Statutory Hearings114

III. Statutory HearingsFinal Hearing/Trial on the Merits

A Final Hearing (trial) must commence, or an extension must be granted, before the dismissal 
deadline  or  the  court  will  lose  jurisdiction  over  the  case  and  the  suit  will  be  automatically 
dismissed without a court order. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.401.

Tex. Fam. Code §§161.001, 263.401, 263.404

STATUTES

PURPOSE

To obtain a final order consistent with the child’s permanency plan prior to the dismissal date.

Practice Tip: Trial must commence or an extension must be granted before the one-year 
anniversary of the date that DFPS was named as the temporary managing conservator 
or the court will lose jurisdiction over the case, the suit will be automatically dismissed 
without a court order, and the child must be returned to their home. Tex. Fam. Code § 
263.401.

BURDEN OF PROOF 

If  termination  of  parental  rights  is  requested,  the  standard  of  proof  is  clear  and  convincing 
evidence.  If  PMC  is  requested,  the  standard  is  preponderance  of  the  evidence,  unless  ICWA 
applies.  If  ICWA  applies,  termination  of  parental  rights  requires  proof  beyond  a  reasonable 
doubt.

BEST INTEREST

The focus at a termination trial is on best interest factors (including, but not limited to: child’s 
age and physical and mental vulnerabilities, frequency and nature of out-of-home placements, 
history of abusive or assaultive conduct by the child’s family or other with access to home; history 
of substance abuse by child’s family or others with access to home; whether the perpetrator of 
the harm to child has been identified; and special considerations for children 16 years of age or 
older), as well as on the Holley factors. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.307; Holley v. Adams, 544 S. W. 
2d 367 (Tex. 1976). DFPS must prove at least one ground for termination plus that termination 
of parental rights is in the child’s best interest. Please see the Best Interest section in this tool 
kit for more information.

ICWA

If  ICWA  applies,  termination  of  parental  rights  requires  proof  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt, 
including qualified testimony of a Qualified Expert Witness (QEW), that the parent’s continued 
custody “is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.” 25 U.S.C. § 
1912(f).  DFPS  must  demonstrate  that  “active  efforts”  were  made  to  reunify,  as  well  as  other 
requirements. For more information, see ICWA section of the tool kit.

HEARING BEFORE ASSOCIATE JUDGE

The  Family  Code  authorizes  judges  in  civil  proceedings  to  refer  cases  to  associate  judges 
appointed  both  under  Texas  Family  Code  Chapter  201,  Subchapters  A  and  C  to  handle  the 
disposition of a variety of case-related matters, including trials on the merits in termination of 
parental rights. Tex. Fam. Code § 201.005(a). 

Referral to an associate judge is not binding on the parties, so if any party timely objects, the 

115

III. Statutory Hearingsreferring court must hear the trial on the merits or preside at a jury trial. Tex. Fam. Code § 
201.005(b)-(c). Barring an objection, however, a Texas Family Code Chapter 201, Subchapters 
A or C associate judge may determine the merits in either a bench or a jury trial, subject to the 
parties’ post-trial right to request a “de novo hearing” before the referring court, which must be 
heard within thirty days of a timely de novo request. Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015.

A party desiring a trial before the referring court rather than the associate judge must file an 
objection not later than the 10th day after the date the party receives notice that the associate 
will hear the trial. If an objection is filed, the referring court shall hear the trial on the merits 
or preside at a jury trial, if a jury demand has been timely made. Tex. Fam. Code § 201.005(c). 

PROSECUTOR PREPARATION

The preparation required for a contested trial varies greatly depending on the relief requested, 
the evidence, and whether a jury is requested. In every case, preparing a trial notebook will focus 
pretrial preparation, reveal issues that require additional research, and ensure easy access to 
information during trial. 

The  practice  tips  below  outline  some  general  principles  that  attorneys  representing  DFPS 
may consider when approaching a contested trial. Attorneys should seek additional materials, 
resources, and training to ensure adequate preparation.

Practice Tip: Attorneys should work with the DFPS caseworker in the months leading 
up  to  trial  to  answer  discovery  so  that  all  necessary  witnesses  may  be  identified  and 
called and all necessary exhibits may be admitted. All service providers and any other 
witnesses that the attorney intends to call to testify should be interviewed ahead of time. 
Review the facts that led up to the removal, all court orders, the service plan, service 
provider  notes  and  caseworker  reports  to  the  court,  and  discuss  the  burden  of  proof, 
anticipated  evidence  from  all  parties,  and  any  alternative  relief  requested  with  your 
client. Prepare witnesses for direct and cross-examination.

Practice Tip: When making a record, it is helpful to avoid terms of art or acronyms and 
to remember the basics of examining a witness (e.g., identify all witnesses in the record 
and  their  relationship  to  the  case).  If  examining  the  caseworker(s),  it  is  important  to 
establish their relationship to the case, and the basis of their knowledge about it (how 
long have they been working on the case, etc.)

REQUIRED SHOWING

Termination of Parental Rights

Requires  evidence  of  at  least  one  ground  for  termination  of  parental  rights  against  a  parent 
and evidence that termination is in the best interest of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b). 
Evidence for each prong must be presented against each parent for whom termination is being 
sought. To avoid a child being returned home if a termination order is denied or reversed on 
appeal, the best practice is to plead in the alternative for permanent managing conservatorship 
to be awarded to DFPS.

Appointment of DFPS as Permanent Managing Conservator

116

III. Statutory HearingsThe  appointment  of  DFPS  as  a  child’s  Permanent  Managing  Conservator  (PMC)  without 
termination of parental rights is only appropriate if there isn’t a more permanent option for a 
child. This requires evidence that:

•	 Appointment  of  a  parent  as  managing  conservator  would  not  be  in  child’s  best 
interest because it would significantly impair the child’s physical health or emotional 
development; and

•	 It would not be in child’s best interest to appoint a relative or another person as managing 

conservator.

In making this determination, the court shall consider:

•	 That the child will be 18 years old in less than three years; 
•	 The  child  is  12  or  older  and  has  expressed  a  strong  desire  against  termination  and 

continuously expressed a strong desire against being adopted; and

•	 The needs and desires of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.404.

TRANSITION PLAN REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN YOUTH

As part of the Final Hearing, the Court must verify the following for any child who goes into 
PMC and who has an Alternative Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA):

•	 If  the  child  is  14  or  older:  that  DFPS  has  conducted  an  independent  living  skills 
assessment (ILSA) for the child as provided under Tex. Fam. Code § 264.121 (a-3); that 
DFPS has addressed the goals identified in the child’s permanency plan, including the 
child’s housing plan, and the results of the ILSA;

•	 If the child is 16 or older: that there is evidence that DFPS has provided the youth with 

the documents and information listed in Tex. Fam. Code § 264.121 (e); and

•	 If the child is 18 or older or has had the disabilities of minorities removed: that there is 
evidence that DFPS has provided the youth with the documents and information listed 
in Tex. Fam. Code § 264.121 (e-1). Tex. Fam. Code § 263.4041.

Practice Tip: When seeking to admit the affidavit as evidence over hearsay objection, 
argue that the affidavit is not being used to prove the truth of the assertions included, 
but rather to show what the court relied on when it made the determination to remove 
for abuse or neglect under Chapter 262. See In the Interest of E.C.R., 402 S.W.3d 239, 248 
(Tex. 2013). This is especially helpful when the worker who wrote the affidavit is unable 
to testify.

ENTERING A DEFAULT JUDGMENT

A default judgment must conform to the pleadings served on the defendant. The record must 
show:

•	 Service of citation, no answer and the return on file at least 10 days; 
•	 An  order  appointing  an  attorney  ad  litem  for  the  absent  parent,  if  appointment  of 

counsel is mandatory;

•	 If the judgement seeks termination against one or both parents, evidence to support at 
least one of the termination grounds plead and that termination is in the child’s best 
interest;

117

III. Statutory Hearings•	 A “statement of the evidence” approved and signed by the judge which should demonstrate 

the diligence used to locate the defendant if citation by publication was requested;

•	 Proof of compliance with the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (“SCRA”). Please see the 

Servicemembers Civil Relief Act section in this tool kit for more information.; and

•	 For an alleged father, evidence that the alleged father has not registered his paternity 

or filed a paternity action or admission of paternity.

Practice Tip: Before filing an amended petition, requesting an interlocutory default as 
to a missing parent may avoid notice or service problems.

ANSWER DEFAULTS VS. NO-ANSWER DEFAULTS

Once an answer has been filed, notice requirements are less onerous. An answer or participation 
in the suit generally waives any defects in the previously issued service or notice. Every party 
filing  a  pleading  is  required  to  provide  an  address,  telephone  number,  and  fax  number  for 
themself or their attorney, if represented by counsel. If the attorney withdraws, the attorney 
must  provide  the  court  with  the  last  known  address  of  their  client.  Subsequent  pleadings  or 
notices, including amended petitions or counter claims may then be served relatively easily. 

Practice  Tip: It is important to still make a clear record in case of an appeal. When 
making  a  record,  it  is  helpful  to  remember  the  basics  of  examining  a  witness  (e.g. 
identify all witnesses in the record and their relationship to the case). If examining the 
caseworker(s), it is important to establish their relationship to the case, and the basis of 
their knowledge about it (how long on the case, etc.).

Practice Tip: If a parent appears to contest a default prior to the final hearing, and there 
is any question about compliance with the procedural requirements, the best strategy 
may be to agree to a new trial, in order to avoid exposing an otherwise solid termination 
case to reversal. 

Practice Tip: Unlike with a default judgment, an “empty chair” trial may occur after 
a parent has appeared or filed a response in a case and has received proper notice but 
does not appear at the final hearing. If a parent timely requests a jury trial but does not 
appear  and  has  not  waived  the  request,  attorneys  representing  DFPS  might  consider 
proceeding with the trial to avoid appellate issues. 

ENTERING AGREED ORDERS

Agreed  Final  Orders  can  be  entered  by  a  court  when  all  parties  have  reached  agreement, 
typically achieved during a settlement conference or in mediation. The order must provide for 
the  permanency  of  the  children,  whether  this  be  to  return  home,  to  be  placed  permanently 
with a relative as managing conservator, or voluntary relinquishment of parental rights and 
awarding PMC to DFPS.

118

III. Statutory HearingsPractice Tip: Elicit testimony on best interest for both prove-ups and agreed orders. The 
testimony should be specific to the child and sufficient to meet the clear and convincing 
evidence standard, not merely a yes or no answer. Agreed orders should be dictated into 
the record and reflected by a final order. If there is a mediated settlement agreement 
(MSA), consider attaching a copy of it to the final order.

Practice Tip: Consider the following issues before entering a final order dismissing 
DFPS as conservator: 
•  Is there a court of continuing jurisdiction? 
•  Is there a prior order establishing a parent-child relationship? 
•  Are there multiple prior orders regarding different children that should be  
 
•  Has child support for each child from each party been addressed? 
•  Has medical insurance and dental insurance been addressed for each child? 
•  Has visitation between each child and each conservator been established and is the  
 

language specific enough to be enforceable later, if needed?

consolidated? 

COURT ACTION

The  court  may  terminate  parental  rights  on  one  or  more  grounds  and/or  name  a  Permanent 
Managing Conservator for the child.

If PMC is awarded to DFPS, the court must set a date for the next hearing as follows:

•	 If DFPS was granted PMC and parental rights were terminated, the court must conduct 
the initial Permanency Hearing After Final Order within 90 days of the final order and 
hold subsequent hearings at least once every six months until the child is adopted or 
DFPS is no longer the conservator.

•	 If  DFPS  was  granted  PMC  and  parental  rights  were  not  terminated,  the  court  must 
conduct a Permanency Hearing After Final Order at least once every six months until 
DFPS is no longer the conservator.

Practice Tip: For Child Protection Court (CPC) associate judges, the proposed order or 
judgment of the associate judge becomes the order of the referring court by operation of 
law without ratification by the referring court. Tex. Fam. Code § 201.2041(a). Regardless 
of whether a de novo hearing is requested before the referring court, a proposed order or 
judgment rendered by an associate judge that meets the requirements of Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 263.401(d) is considered a final order for purposes of Tex. Fam. Code § 263.401. Tex. 
Fam. Code § 201.014(b) and Tex. Fam. Code § 201.2041(b).

90-Day Deadline to Render Final Order; Extension

The Court must render a final order not later than the 90th day after trial commences. Tex. 
Fam. Code § 263.4011(a). The remedy for failing to render a final order within the specified time 
period is to file a mandamus requesting that the court render a final order. 

Note: The 90-day period IS NOT tolled for any recess during the trial.

119

III. Statutory HearingsThe court may extend the 90-day period for the period the court determines necessary if, after 
a hearing, the court finds good cause for the extension.

Note: An extension of the 90-day period requires (1) a hearing, and (2) a written order 
specifying the grounds on which the extension is granted and the length of the extension. 

AFTER THE COURT RENDERS A FINAL ORDER

The prosecutor must:

•	 Prepare the judgment making sure: 

o  to track the statutory language for the applicable termination grounds, which should 

be listed in the conjunctive; 

o  to  include  the  parental  presumption  language  of  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  153.131,  if 

applicable; and 

o  that  the  statutory  warning  to  parents  is  prominently  displayed  (boldface  type, 

underlined or capital letters).

•	 File a Motion to Enter Judgment if a party fails or refuses to sign the judgment; and
•	 Schedule a Permanency Hearing After Final Order. 

Be aware of strict time limits for any challenge:

•	 A request for de novo hearing must be filed with the clerk of the referring court no 
later than the 3rd working day after receiving notice of the substance of the associate 
judge’s order; Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015. For more information, see the De Novo Hearing 
section of the tool kit;

•	 An accelerated appeal must be filed within 20 days after the judgment or order is 
signed, subject to a possible 15-day extension. Tex. R. App. P. 26.1(b) and Tex. R. App. 
P. 26.3. For more information, see the Appeals section below; and

•	 A  motion  for  new  trial  must  be  filed  within  30  days  after  the  final  judgement  is 

signed. Tex. R. Civ. P. 329B. 

NOTICE OF TERMINATION FOR CERTAIN RELATIVES

Immediately  after  a  court  renders  an  order  terminating  the  parent-child  relationship  in  a 
suit filed by DFPS, DFPS is required to notify each individual described by Tex. Fam. Code § 
102.006(c) who has been identified under Tex. Fam. Code § 262.1095 that:

•	 The parent-child relationship has been terminated; and
•	 The individual has 90 days after the date the order is rendered to file an original suit or 
a suit for modification requesting managing conservatorship of the child in accordance 
with Tex. Fam. Code § 102.006(c). Tex. Fam. Code § 161.2081.

APPEALS

Accelerated Appeal

120

An  appeal  of  a  final  order  rendered  under  Tex.  Fam.  Code  Chapter  263,  Subchapter  E  is 
governed  by  the  procedures  for  accelerated  appeals  in  civil  cases  under  the  Texas  Rules  of 
Appellate Procedure and the appellate court must render its final order or judgment with the 
least possible delay. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.405(a). An accelerated appeal must be filed within 20 

III. Statutory Hearingsdays after the judgment or order is signed, subject to a possible 15-day extension. Tex. R. App. 
P. 26.1(b) and Tex. R. App. P. 26.3. 

The final order must contain the following prominently displayed statement in boldfaced type, 
in capital letters, or underline: 

“A PARTY AFFECTED BY THIS ORDER HAS THE RIGHT TO APPEAL. AN APPEAL IN A 
SUIT  IN  WHICH  TERMINATION  OF  THE  PARENT-CHILD  RELATIONSHIP  IS  SOUGHT 
IS GOVERNED BY THE PROCEDURES FOR ACCELERATED APPEALS IN CIVIL CASES 
UNDER  THE  TEXAS  RULES  OF  APPELLATE  PROCEDURE.  FAILURE  TO  FOLLOW 
THE TEXAS RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE FOR ACCELERATED APPEALS MAY 
RESULT IN THE DISMISSAL OF THE APPEAL.” Tex. Fam. Code § 263.405(b). 

Appointment of Appellate Attorney for Parent 

A parent who has been determined indigent by the court is presumed to remain indigent for the 
duration of the suit and any appeal unless the court finds a material and substantial change for 
the parent’s financial circumstances. Tex. Fam. Code § 107.013(e). 

Otherwise,  the  appointment  of  a  parent’s  attorney  continues  until  the  case  is  dismissed,  the 
date  all  appeals  are  exhausted  or  waived,  or  the  date  on  which  the  attorney  is  replaced  by 
another attorney. Tex. Fam. Code § 107.016(2). 

Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law

In the context of accelerated appeals, which an appeal of a termination decree is, whether the 
trial court files findings and conclusions is discretionary. See Tex. R. App. P. 28.1(c); In re M.P., 
No 02-14-00032-CV, 2014 WL 3882179 at *2 (Tex.App.—Ft. Worth Aug. 7, 2014, no pet.) (mem.
op.). In re A.S., No. 02-16-00076-CV, 2016 WL 3364838, at *6 (Tex.App.—Ft. Worth June 16, 
1016, no pet.)(mem. op.). 

In an accelerated appeal, “[t]he trial court need not file findings of fact and conclusions of law 
but may do so within 30 days after the order is signed. Tex. R. App. P. 28.1(c) (emphasis added).” 
In re M.P., No. 02-14-00032-CV, 2014 WL 3882179, at *2 (Tex.App.—Ft. Worth Aug. 7, 2014, no 
pet.)(mem. op.).

Practice Tip: Some appellate courts may require that Findings of Fact and Conclusions 
of  Law  be  submitted  prior  to  reviewing  an  appeal.  Be  prepared  to  timely  submit  a 
proposal of the findings and conclusions related to a case on appeal upon request to the 
trial court to consider for adoption if such a request is made. 

Representation of DFPS on Appeal

The DFPS Appellate Unit handles termination appeals across the entire state, and any attorney 
representing DFPS may refer an appeal to the DFPS Appellate Unit. However, some County 
and District Attorney Offices handle their own civil appeals, including child welfare law cases. 
Please check with your office to determine if appeals are handled in-house or need to be referred 
out in a timely manner. 

A  County  or  District  Attorney’s  Office  may  refer  an  appeal  to  the  DFPS  Appellate  Unit  by 
contacting Virginia Weldon at virginia.weldon@dfps.texas.gov or by calling (512) 929-6819 to 
obtain a referral form. The referral form and any post-trial documents should be e-mailed to 

121

III. Statutory HearingsEric Tai, DFPS Managing Attorney for the Appellate Unit, at eric.tai@dfps.texas.gov as soon 
as possible after receiving notice of appeal. A prolonged delay in referring the case to the DFPS 
Appellate Unit may result in the case not being accepted. 

122

III. Statutory HearingsPermanency Hearing After Final Order

Tex. Fam. Code §§263.002, 263.501, 236.5031, 264.121

STATUTES

PURPOSE

To review the status of every child in DFPS’ permanent managing conservatorship (PMC) at 
least once every six months until DFPS is no longer the child’s permanent managing conservator. 
Once parental rights are terminated, then the first permanency hearing must be no later than 
90 days after that the date of the order terminating parental rights.

BURDEN OF PROOF

Preponderance of the evidence.

PROSECUTOR PREPARATION

Before the hearing, the prosecutor must:

•	 If  parental  rights  have  been  terminated,  and  the  child  is  in  their  intended  adoptive 

home, ensure that all steps are being taken to consummate the adoption.

•	 Determine  whether  the  child  is  eligible  for  an  adoption  subsidy  and  ensure  that  the 

proper procedures are followed to obtain the subsidy.

•	 If parental rights have been terminated, but the child is not in a prospective adoptive 

home, advise DFPS to initiate recruitment efforts to identify such a home. 
o  revisit the client’s family members to inquire about placement and/or adoption. It 
may be that a relative was unable or unwilling to take the child in during the TMC 
phase,  but  circumstances  may  have  changed  to  such  a  degree  that  placement  is 
now viable. Adoption subsidy eligibility or PCA may make placement with family 
possible. With teenage clients, be knowledgeable about assistance to the family that 
may extend beyond age 18.

o  for children who are likely to age out of foster care, monitor the progress of DFPS in 
getting the child’s documents, scheduling preparation for adult living classes, and 
helping the child in accessing their benefits.

•	 Verify that 10 days before the hearing (unless the court orders a different deadline or 

waives the reporting requirement for good cause shown):
o  proper notice was provided to all parties;
o  court report was filed and provided to all parties; Tex. Fam. Code § 263.502;
o  any updates regarding the child’s medical consenter;

•	 Verify DFPS arranged for child to attend the hearing unless specifically excused by the 
court or, for a child in Texas Juvenile Justice Department (TJJD) custody, appearance 
in person, telephonic, or by video; Tex. Fam. Code § 263.302;

•	 Verify  current  information  regarding  educational  decision-maker  and  any  surrogate 

parent has been filed with the court; Tex. Fam. Code § 263.004(c); and

•	 Review the permanency progress report in preparation for the Court’s review pursuant 

to Tex. Fam. Code § 263.5031(3).

Practice Tip: Review permanency report thoroughly prior to the hearing. Meet with the 
assigned caseworker and supervisor to identify any potential concerns that may arise in 
the hearing. 

123

III. Statutory HearingsCOURT ACTION

The court must:

•	 Identify persons and parties present, review DFPS efforts to give required notice, and 
review DFPS efforts to provide the child with regular, ongoing opportunities to engage 
in normalcy activities;

•	 Inquire from all parties whether the child has had the opportunity to provide information 
regarding potential caregivers and whether individuals identified by the child are listed 
on the proposed Child Placement Resources Form;

•	 Inform  relatives  serving  as  placement  for  a  child  of  the  ability  to  become  a  licensed 

foster parent and apply for Permanency Care Assistance;

•	 Review the permanency progress report to assess:

o  child  safety  and  well-being  (including  whether  any  medical  or  special  needs  are

III. Statutory HearingsOther Statutory Hearings

De Novo Hearing
STATUTES 

Tex. Fam. Code §§ 201.015, 201.2042(b) 

PURPOSE

When a case is referred to an associate judge for any authorized purpose, a party may request 
a  de  novo  hearing  before  the  referring  court  by  filing  a  written  request  with  the  clerk  of  the 
referring court not later than the third working day after the date the party receives notice of 
the  substance  of  the  associate  judge’s  ruling  or  order. Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  201.015(a).  De  novo 
hearings are limited to the specific issues stated in the de novo hearing request. Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 201.015(b). See In re L.R., 324 S.W.3d 885, 890 n.5 (Tex. App.—Austin 2010, no pet.) (“[T]he de 
novo hearing before the referring court is limited to those issues raised in the hearing request.”). 

Note: For de novo hearings requested in matters handled by associate judges appointed 
under  Tex.  Fam.  Code  Chapter  201,  Subchapter  C,  the  party  requesting  the  de  novo 
hearing must file notice with the clerk of the referring court as well as the court to ensure 
that the referring court judge is timely notified along with the clerk of the court. Notice 
of a request for a de novo hearing before the referring court must be given to opposing 
parties under Tex. R. Civ. P. 21(a). Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015(d). 

Practice Tip: If a request for de novo hearing is filed by a party, any other party may 
file a request for a de novo hearing before the referring court not later than the third 
working day after the date the initial request was filed. Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015(e).

BURDEN OF PROOF

De Novo of Temporary Orders

De Novo of Final Hearing

For a de novo of a temporary orders hearing, the standard is preponderance of the evidence. 

If  termination  of  parental  rights  is  requested,  the  burden  of  proof  is  clear  and  convincing 
evidence. If permanent managing conservatorship is requested, the standard is preponderance 
of the evidence.

PROSECUTOR PREPARATION

This  varies  greatly  depending  on  the  whether  any  new  testimony  and/or  evidence  will  be 
presented on behalf of DFPS at the de novo hearing. A de novo hearing may be requested for any 
hearing in which the associate judge rendered orders. At a minimum, an attorney representing 
DFPS should be prepared to cross-examine witnesses presented by the party requesting the de 
novo. If the de novo hearing request is related to a lengthy contested matter, such as the final 
trial,  discuss  with  DFPS  the  pros  and  cons  of  obtaining  the  trial  transcript  for  the  referring 
court’s review. 

•	 Parties  may  present  witnesses  at  the  de  novo  hearing,  and  the  referring  court  may 
consider the record from the hearing before the associate judge, including any charge to 
the jury and any verdict returned, if the matter was tried before a jury. Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 201.015(c).

126

III. Statutory Hearings•	 Although a party may request a de novo hearing before the referring court, a party is 
not entitled to demand a second jury if the order or proposed judgment reviewed by the 
referring court was the result of a jury trial presided over by the associate judge in the 
first instance. Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015(i).

Relevant Case Law
•	 Neither Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015 nor any other provision of the Texas Family Code 
expressly confers a right to a jury trial in a de novo hearing. In the Interest of A.L.M.-F., 
A.M., J.A.-F., N.A.-F., and E.A.-F., No.593 S.W.3d 271, 276-277. (Tex. 2019).

•	 A de novo hearing under Tex. Fam. Code Chapter 201 is not equivalent to a new trial as 
review by the referring court under Tex. Fam. Code § 201.015 is not entirely independent 
of the proceedings before the associate judge. Accordingly, the term “de novo hearing,” 
as used in Tex. Fam. Code Chapter 201, does not equate to a “trial de novo.” Rather, 
the term “de novo hearing” has meaning that is unique to the associate judge referral 
statutes  and  governed  by  the  procedures  specified  in  the  authorizing  statutes.  In  the 
Interest of A.L.M.-F., 593 S.W.3d 271, 279.

FORGOING RIGHT TO DE NOVO HEARING

Parties can forego their right to have their case decided by the referring court in two ways: 

•	 a  party  can  waive  the  right  to  a  de  novo  hearing  by  executing  a  waiver  prior  to  the 

hearing or trial before the associate judge; or 

•	 post-hearing, the party can fail to or forego filing a request for a de novo hearing within 

the time required by statute. 

Thus, if a request for a de novo hearing before the referring court is not timely filed or the right 
to de novo hearing before the referring court is waived. 

COURT ACTION

The referring court must conduct the de novo hearing within thirty days of the request. Tex. 
Fam. Code § 201.015(f).

The  findings  and  orders  that  the  referring  court  must  render  will  be  subject  to  the  type  of 
hearing on de novo and will specifically address the issues raised on de novo. 

Adoption Hearing
STATUTES

PURPOSE 

Tex. Fam. Code Chapter 162, Tex. Fam. Code §§ 102.008(b), 103.001(b), 155.001(c), 155.201(a-1)

Adoption  creates  the  legal  parent-child  relationship  between  the  adopted  child  and  adoptive 
parents  for  all  purposes.  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  162.017(a).  The  adoptive  parents  assume  the 
permanent roles of parental care, custody, and control of the child as though the child were the 
biological child of the parents. Tex. Fam. Code § 162.017(b). Through adoption, the new parents 
make a commitment to the court and to the child that they will provide for all aspects of the 
child’s well-being, thereby concluding the decision-making and monitoring roles of the court. 

127

III. Statutory HearingsPROSECUTOR PREPARATION

Adoption  filings  are  handled  by  an  attorney  representing  the  adoptive  family.  Additionally, 
the attorney representing the adoptive family will have the burden of proving up the adoption. 
Depending on the jurisdiction, attorneys representing DFPS may assist with obtaining a court 
date for the hearing or with transportation of court files to and from an off-site Adoption Day 
Docket. 

PERSONS  WHO  SHOULD  ALWAYS  BE  PRESENT  AT  AN  ADOPTION 
HEARING

•	 Adoptive parents 

o  if  joint  petitioners  are  spouses,  and  it  would  be  unduly  difficult  for  one  of  the 
petitioners to appear, the court may waive the attendance of that petitioner if the 
other spouse is present. Tex. Fam. Code § 162.014(a);

•	 A  child  to  be  adopted  who  is  12  years  old  or  older  unless  appearance  is  waived  by 
the court upon a finding that it is in the best interest of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 
162.014(b);

•	 Assigned caseworker;
•	 AAL and/or GAL/Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) for the child. 

COURT ACTION

If a petition requesting termination has been joined with a petition requesting adoption, the 
court shall also terminate the parent-child relationship at the same time the adoption order is 
rendered. The court must make separate findings that the termination is in the best interest of 
the child and that the adoption is in the best interest of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 162.016(a).

The court shall grant the adoption if it finds that: 

•	 The requirements for adoption have been met; and 
•	 The adoption is in the best interest of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 162.016(b).
•	 The  name  of  the  child  may  be  changed  in  the  order  if  requested.  Tex.  Fam.  Code  § 

162.016(c).

Reinstatement of Parental Rights Hearing
STATUES

Tex. Fam. Code §§ 161.301-161.304

PARTIES THAT MAY FILE FOR REINSTATEMENT
•	 DFPS or a Single Source Continuum Contractor (SSCC)
•	 The attorney ad litem for the child
•	 A parent whose rights have been involuntarily terminated. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.302(a).

128

III. Statutory HearingsPractice  Tip:  Since  the  statute  requires  that  a  parent’s  rights  must  have  been 
involuntarily  terminated,  this  may  be  interpreted  to  exclude  parents  who  signed 
affidavits of relinquishment or signed and mediated settlement agreement not to oppose 
termination based on Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(O) or other ground under § 161.001. 
However,  all  grounds  under  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  161.001  are  listed  under  “Involuntary 
Termination of the Parent-Child Relationship” including Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001 (b)
(K) (execution of an affidavit of relinquishment) so those parents may not be excluded 
from filing for reinstatement. 

PETITION REQUIREMENTS

Circumstances When a Petition Cannot Be Filed

A petition for reinstatement cannot be filed if:

•	 The termination of parental rights did not result from a suit filed by DFPS;
•	 It has been less the two years since the parent’s rights were terminated;
•	 The child has been adopted, or is the subject of an adoption placement agreement;
•	 There is a pending appeal; or
•	 It has been less than one year since a court denied a previous petition for reinstatement.

NOTICE

Notice of the petition must be served on:

129

III. Statutory Hearings•	 The child or child’s representative;
•	 The county attorney;
•	 The child’s attorney ad litem;
•	 DFPS or SSCC, if applicable 
•	 The former parent whose parental rights are sought to be reinstated, if they are not the 

petitioner; and

•	 The Tribal representative, if ICWA applies. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.302(e).

Practice Tip: If the petitioner is the former parent, they must provide 45 days’ notice to 
DFPS of their intent to file using the Notice of Intent of Former Parent to Petition Court 
to Reinstate Parental Rights Form 3800 created by the DFPS Commissioner. Please visit 
DFPS’ Forms webpage to download the form. 

A hearing must be held no later than 60 days after the date the petition is filed. Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 161.303(a).

The  petitioner  has  the  burden  of  proof.  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  161.303(b).  The  standard  of  proof 
required for reinstatement of parental rights is preponderance of the evidence. Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 105.005.

For the court to determine whether the former parent’s rights should be reinstated. 

HEARING

Standard of Proof

Purpose

Required Findings 

For the court to reinstate the parent’s rights, the court must find that:

•	 Reinstatement of parental rights is in the child’s best interests;
•	 At  least  two  years  have  passed  since  the  issuance  of  the  order  terminating  parental 

rights and an appeal of the order is not pending; 

•	 The child has not been adopted and is not the subject of an adoption placement agreement; 
•	 If the child is over 12 years old, that the child consents and desires to reside with the 

parent;

•	 The  former  parent  has  remedied  the  conditions  that  were  grounds  for  rendering  the 

order terminating parental rights; and

•	 The former parent is willing and able to perform parental duties as provided by Tex. 
Fam. Code § 151.001 including maintaining the health, safety, and welfare of the child.

If the child is less than 12 when the petition for reinstatement is filed, the court must consider 
the  child’s  age,  maturity,  and  ability  to  express  a  preference  and  may  consider  the  child’s 
preference regarding the reinstatement as one factor in the court’s determination.

130

III. Statutory HearingsCOURT ACTION

Grant the petition

Deny the petition

If the court grants the petition after a hearing, the court must issue a written order stating that 
all  legal  rights,  powers,  privileges,  immunities,  duties,  and  obligations  of  the  former  parent 
with respect to the custody, care, control, and support of the child are reinstated.

If  the  court  denies  the  petition,  it  must  make  findings  and  detail  reasons  for  the  denial  and 
must issue a statement prohibiting the filing of a subsequent petition for a year from the order 
of denial.

Defer taking action

The court may defer the decision on the petition and render a temporary order expiring after 
a period of six months during which DFPS remains the managing conservator and the former 
parent is the possessory conservator.

During the six-month time period, DFPS must monitor the possessory conservatorship of the 
former parent and when the temporary order expires, the court shall hold a hearing to determine 
whether to grant or deny the petition for reinstatement. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.304.

Benefits for Child After Reinstatement
Youth in DFPS conservatorship are eligible for certain benefits, such as a tuition and fee waiver 
for attending state higher education institutions, an Education and Training Voucher (ETV) to 
provide financial assistance while attending school, Medicaid eligibility, and waiver of fees for 
state government identification.

Eligibility  for  the  youth  depends  on  a  variety  of  factors  including  the  youth’s  age,  legal 
conservatorship,  and  how  the  youth  exits  DFPS  conservatorship.  If  the  parent’s  rights  are 
reinstated, it may affect the availability of certain benefits for the youth.

TUITION AND FEE WAIVER

If the parent’s rights are reinstated, the child may still be eligible for the tuition and fee waiver 
under the following circumstances:

•	 The child was in DFPS conservatorship on the day of the child’s 14th birthday, if they 

were also eligible for adoption on or after that day; or

•	 The child is 14 years or older on or after June 1, 2016 and left PMC of DFPS to return 

to the legal responsibility of a parent; or

•	 The child is 16 years or older on or after June 1, 2016 and left TMC of DFPS to return 

to the legal responsibility of a parent; or

•	 The child enrolled in a dual credit course or other course in which a high-school student 
may earn joint high school and college credit and was in DFPS conservatorship on the 
day of enrollment; and

•	 The  child  enrolls  in  a  public  higher  education  institution  or  in  a  dual  credit  course 
before their 25th birthday. Tex. Educ. Code § 54.366; 40 Tex. Admin. Code §700.1630. 

131

III. Statutory HearingsPractice Tip: DFPS Preparation for Adult Living (PAL) staff verify eligibility for the 
tuition and fee waiver, even if the child did not participate in PAL services. 

EDUCATION AND TRAINING VOUCHER

The youth may still be eligible for ETV if the child was at least 16 and was likely to remain in 
DFPS foster care until turning 18 before the reinstatement was filed.

III. Statutory HearingsReasonable Efforts

DFPS  is  required  to  make  reasonable  efforts  to  prevent  the  need  for  removal  of  the  child. 
Additionally, if  removal  is  authorized, DFPS is required to make reasonable efforts to safely 
return the child home. Although there is no definitive list of what constitutes reasonable efforts, 
the questions below are modified from the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges 
Enhanced Resource Guidelines and are designed to elicit suggested elements of what could be 
considered reasonable efforts throughout the case.

QUESTIONS FOR REASONABLE EFFORTS TO AVOID REMOVAL

•	 What were the specific safety risks leading to removal?
•	 What services were considered and offered to allow the child to remain in the home? 
Were those services culturally appropriate? Were they rationally related to the safety 
risk? Did they take into account the family’s strengths and needs?

•	 What  was  done  to  create  a  safety  plan  to  allow  the  child  to  remain  at  home  or  with 

another designated caregiver without requiring court involvement?

•	 Would the removal of a person from the home have allowed the child to safely remain 

home?

home?

•	 Would  the  addition  of  a  person  to  the  home  have  allowed  the  child  to  safely  remain 

•	 Was  the  family  offered  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  the  Alternative  Response 
Program  or  Family  Based  Safety  Services?  If  so,  why  was  Alternative  Response  or 
Family Based Safety Services unsuccessful?

•	 Was the family ordered to participate in Court Ordered Services (COS)? If so, why was 

COS unsuccessful?

•	 Were non-custodial parents, paternal and maternal relatives identified and evaluated?
•	 Were  there  any  pre-hearing  conferences  such  as  a  Family  Team  Meeting  or  Family 

Group Conference? Who was there? What was the outcome?

•	 Does the family have a history with DFPS? Did the history influence DFPS’ response to 

this situation?

•	 Are there orders that could be made under Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203 that would require 
the parents to participate in services but allow the child to remain safely in the home?

QUESTIONS  FOR  REASONABLE  EFFORTS  TO  ALLOW  THE  CHILD  TO 
RETURN HOME

•	 What is preventing this child from safely going home today?
•	 What is the current immediate safety threat?
•	 What type of safety plan could be developed and implemented in order for the child to 

return home today?

•	 What specifically is preventing the parents from being able to provide the minimally 

adequate standard of protective care?

•	 Will the removal of a person from the home allow the child to safely return home?
•	 Will the addition of a person to the home allow the child to safely return home?
•	 Is a monitored return or a transition monitored return appropriate? If not, why not?
•	 If the safety threat is too high, do the parents understand what conditions are required 

for the child to safely return?

133

IV. Concurrent Issues•	 What services can be arranged to allow the child to safely go home today?
•	 How are the services rationally related to the specific safety threat?
•	 How is the family, including children and extended family, engaged in the development 

and implementation of the services?

•	 What efforts has DFPS made to assist the family with services?
•	 Does the family believe the services take into account the family’s strengths and needs?
•	 Has the family asked for additional or alternative services?
•	 What evidence has DFPS provided that the services meet the needs of the family and 

have produced positive outcomes for families with similar issues?

•	 How are the services specifically tailored to the culture and needs of this child and this 

family?

Practice Tip: Remember that reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for 
removal  of  the  child  are  dependent  on  the  individual  circumstances  of  the  case  and 
should provide for the safety of the child. Reasonable efforts to allow the child to return 
home can include DFPS efforts to assess and address any immediate safety issues and to 
assist the family with services. Efforts to prevent removal may be limited, for example, 
in  a  situation  where  a  child  has  made  an  outcry  during  school  hours  about  continual 
sexual abuse by a parent who will be the sole caregiver for the child when they return 
home at the end of the school day.  

Unless the court finds that aggravated circumstances exist and grants a request to waive the 
requirement that DFPS make reasonable efforts to return a child to their parent under Tex. 
Fam. Code § 262.2015, DFPS must make continued reasonable efforts throughout the life of the 
case to enable the parents to provide a safe environment for child and return the child to their 
home. DFPS must also make reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan for the child.

Note:  Certain  termination  grounds  require  that  DFPS  prove  the  reasonable  efforts  it 
made to return the child to the parent. 

Practice  Tip:  Generally,  the  implementation  of  a  family  service  plan  by  DFPS  is 
considered a reasonable effort to return a child to the parent. 

QUESTIONS FOR REASONABLE EFFORTS TO ARRANGE AND STABILIZE 
A PERMANENT PLACEMENT FOR THE CHILD WHEN REUNIFICATION IS 
NOT POSSIBLE 

Modified from the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges Enhanced Resource 
Guidelines

•	 What efforts were made to reunify the family?
•	 Why is this plan preferable to reunification?
•	 Are there relatives who are willing to adopt the child if termination is granted? Is the 
child living with this relative? If not, why, and what can DFPS do to eliminate barriers 
to placement? 

134

IV. Concurrent Issues•	 If the child is not placed with relatives, what efforts have been made to identify a willing

why not?

•	 If relative adoption is not the plan, is adoption by the foster parent(s) the plan? Why or 

•	 If an adoptive home must be recruited, what efforts are being made to identify potential 
adoptive  homes  both  locally  and  in  other  jurisdictions?  Are  there  adults  with  whom 
the  child  has  or  has  had  a  positive  relationship  with  who  may  be  potential  adoptive 
families?

•	 Are there relatives interested in permanent managing conservatorship but who are not

relative? 

•	 Were  the  relatives  fully  informed  about  the  benefits  of  adoption  and/or  permanent

•	 If relatives have been ruled out as placement resources due to prior criminal records, 

have non-safety licensing waivers been pursued? If not, why? 

•	 What is the child’s desires regarding adoption or PMC? 
•	 Is the prospective adoptive placement open to maintaining positive family contacts?
•	 If  there  is  a  sibling  group,  will  the  siblings  be  able  to  remain  together?  If  not,  what 
efforts have been made to keep the siblings together? Is sibling contact and visitation 
occurring, and are the placements committed to continuing contact and visitation after 
final orders are entered?

•	 If a change in school will occur, what will be done to prepare for the transition?
•	 Is the adult proposed to serve as permanent managing conservator or as the adoptive 
parent  willing  to  fill  the  parental  role  for  the  child  beyond  the  age  of  majority  and 
through adulthood? 

•	 Is  the  adult  proposed  to  serve  as  the  permanent  managing  conservator  or  adoptive 
parent  financially  able  to  care  for  the  child  through  the  age  of  majority?  If  not,  has 
DFPS  explored  opportunities  for  relative  caregiver  payments,  if  a  relative,  and  or 
entitlements? 

•	 Has there been full disclosure to the family of the child circumstances and special needs?

services be funded after the final order is signed? 

•	 Does the proposed managing conservator or adoptive parent have the necessary skills 
and knowledge to apply a “reasonable and prudent parent standard” while at the same 
time allowing the child to participate in normal and beneficial activities?

•	 Is counseling needed and will it be provided to assist a child to understand and participate 

in reaching the new goal?  

•	 If the goal is APPLA, what are the compelling reasons for determining that it is not in 
the child’s best interest to return home, to pursue either termination or reinstatement 
of parental rights, or pursue placement with a guardian or fit and willing relative? What

IV. Concurrent Issuesis  the  identified,  specific,  and  long-term  placement  for  the  child?  How  will  this  plan 
provide  stability  and  permanency  for  the  child?  What  is  the  child  position  regarding 
this plan? 

The Impact of Reasonable Efforts on Federal Funding
If the court fails to make a reasonable efforts finding or finds that reasonable efforts were not 
made, it could impact the total amount of federal Title IV-E reimbursement received by DFPS; 
however, it does not affect funding for the individual child, the subject of the suit. 

REASONABLE EFFORTS TO PREVENT REMOVAL

Finding must be made within 60 days of the child’s removal. 45 C.F.R. § 1356.21(b)(1)(i).

If the court does not make the finding, the agency will not receive IV-E dollars for the duration 
of the child’s stay in foster care. 45 C.F.R. § 1356.21 (b)(1)(ii). 

REASONABLE EFFORTS TO FINALIZE PERMANENCY

Finding must be made within 12 months of foster care entry and at least once every 12 months 
thereafter. 45 C.F.R. § 1356.21(b)(2)(i).

If the court does not make the finding, the agency will not receive IV-E funding until such a 
determination is made. 45 C.F.R. § 1356.21(b)(2)(ii).

IV. Concurrent IssuesThe mother-child relationship is established between a woman and a child by:

Establishing Paternity

•	 The woman giving birth to the child;
•	 An adjudication of the woman’s maternity; or
•	 The adoption of the child by a woman.

The father-child relationship is established between a man and a child by:
•	 An unrebutted presumption of a man’s paternity of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 160.204;
•	 An  effective  acknowledgment  of  paternity  under  Subchapter  D,  unless  the 

acknowledgment has been rescinded or successfully challenged;

•	 An adjudication of the man’s paternity;
•	 The adoption of a child by the man; or
•	 The man’s consenting to assisted reproduction by his wife under Subchapter H, which 

has resulted in the birth of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 160.201.

TYPES OF FATHERS:

•	 Presumed
•	 Alleged (or putative)
•	 Acknowledged
•	 Adjudicated
•	 Unknown

A man is a Presumed Father if:

•	 He is married to the mother of the child and the child is born during the marriage;
•	 He is married to the mother of the child and the child is born before the 301st day after 
the date the marriage is terminated by death, annulment, declaration of invalidity, or 
divorce;

•	 He  is  married  to  the  mother  of  the  child  before  the  birth  of  the  child  in  apparent 
compliance with the law, even if the attempted marriage is or could be declared invalid 
and the child is born during the invalid marriage or before the 301st day after the date 
the marriage it terminated by death, annulment, declaration of invalidity or divorce;
•	 He married the mother of the child after the birth of the child in apparent compliance 
with  law,  regardless  of  whether  the  marriage  is  or  could  be  declared  invalid,  he 
voluntarily asserted his paternity of the child; and
o  the assertion is in a record filed with the bureau of vital statistics,
o  he is voluntarily named as the child’s father on the child’s birth certificate, or
o  he promised in a record to support the child as his own;

•	 During the first two years of the child’s life, he continuously resided in the household 
in which the child resided and he represented to others that the child was his own. Tex. 
Fam. Code § 160.204.

A man is an Alleged Father (sometimes called putative father) if:

•	 He alleges himself to be, or is alleged to be, the genetic father or possible genetic father 

137

IV. Concurrent Issuesof a child, but his paternity has not been determined.

An alleged father cannot establish paternity or create a presumption of paternity by registering 
with  the  Paternity  Registry,  but  timely  registration  entitles  him  to  notice  of  an  action  for 
termination of parental rights or adoption of a child he may have fathered.

There are several ways an alleged father may establish paternity:

•	 The  mother  of  a  child  and  the  man  claiming  to  be  the  biological  father  may  sign  an 
acknowledgment  of  paternity  with  the  intent  to  establish  the  man’s  paternity.  Tex. 
Fam. Code § 160.301. A valid acknowledgment of paternity filed with the vital statistics 
unit is the equivalent of an adjudication of the paternity of a child and confers all rights 
and duties. Tex. Fam. Code § 160.305.

•	 Both  the  mother  and  father  can  testify  in  open  court  and  ask  the  court  to  establish 

•	 Genetic  testing.  DFPS  may  obtain  genetic  testing  through  the  Texas  Office  of  the 

paternity.

Attorney General.

As soon as a legal father is established, any other potential candidates can be dismissed.

A man is an Acknowledged Father if:

•	 He has executed an Acknowledgement of Paternity (AOP). A valid AOP filed with the 

VSU is the equivalent of an adjudication of paternity.

A man is an Adjudicated Father if:

•	 He  has  been  adjudicated  by  a  court  to  be  the  father  of  a  child.  Adjudication  can  be 
accomplished by an admission of paternity under penalty of perjury during a hearing. 
Also,  a  signed  Acknowledgment  of  Paternity  that  has  been  filed  with  DFPS  of  State 
Health Services is the equivalent of an adjudication of paternity.

Practice Tip: For a child without an Adjudicated or Presumed Father, asking for DNA 
testing on any alleged father who is present at the hearing can save time and prevent 
delays to permanency.

PATERNITY REGISTRY

The Vital Statistics Unit (VSU) maintains a paternity registry. A man who wants to be notified 
of a proceeding for the adoption or the termination of parental rights regarding a child he may 
have fathered must register before the birth of the child or not later than the 31st day after 
the child’s birth. The registrant has the responsibility of keeping his information current with 
the bureau. A man who has filed with the paternity registry within the requisite time frame 
is entitled to be served with notice of a suit involving the child. Registering with the paternity 
registry also establishes a basis for personal jurisdiction of a person who is not a Texas Resident.

If no father-child relationship can be established, a petitioner (DFPS) seeking termination of 
parental rights or adoption must obtain a certificate of the results of a search of the paternity 
registry.  If  the  petitioner  (DFPS)  has  reason  to  believe  that  conception  or  birth  of  the  child 
have may occurred in another state, the petitioner must obtain a certificate from paternity or 
putative father registry of that state.

138

IV. Concurrent IssuesESTOPPEL OF PATERNITY

The  Texas  Legislature  has  recognized  that  in  certain  circumstances  it  may  be  in  the  best 
interest  of  the  child  not  to  have  the  child’s  understanding  of  their  paternity  disrupted.  The 
value  of  maintaining  the  child’s  relationship  with  the  man  identified  to  the  child  as  their 
father may prevent interested parties from litigating the issue, including denying a Motion for 
Genetic Testing. See Tex. Fam. Code §§ 160.607, 160.608, 160.609. 

139

IV. Concurrent IssuesPlacement

Attorneys should be prepared to address the following issues regarding a child’s placement. 

Placement Appropriateness
•	 Is the current placement the least restrictive and most family-like setting for the child?
•	 Is the placement culturally and linguistically appropriate?
•	 Is the child or the parent requesting a placement change?

Placement Preferences
When  ICWA  does  not  apply  and  when  placement  with  a  parent  or  other  person  entitled  to 
possession of the child is not possible, DFPS must give preference to persons in the following 
order when making a placement decision for a child:

•	 A person related to the child by blood, marriage, or adoption; 
•	 A person which whom the child has a long-standing and significant relationship;
•	 A foster home; 
•	 A general residential operation. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.114(d).

If  the  child  has  previously  been  in  a  foster  home  under  DFPS  conservatorship,  DFPS  shall 
consider placing a child in that home if the foster home is available, the placement would be in 
the child’s best interest, and placement with a relative or fictive kin is not in the child’s best 
interest. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.114(c).

If a child is not placed with a relative, the court must at each hearing under Tex. Fam. Code 
Chapter  262  include  in  its  findings  a  statement  on  whether  DFPS  has  elicited  information 
regarding potential caregivers from the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.0022(1). 

Please see the ICWA section in this tool kit for a list of placement preferences for an “Indian 
child.” 

Practice  Tip:  Courts  are  required  at  each  permanency  hearing  held  under  Chapter 
263  to  review  the  placement  of  each  child  who  is  not  placed  with  a  relative  caregiver 
or designated caregiver as defined by Tex. Fam. Code § 264.751 and make a finding as 
to whether DFPS is able to place a child with a relative or designated caregiver and to 
state the evidence that supports its finding either way. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.002(b). If a 
relative caregiver or designated caregiver identified lives in another state, a home study 
will have to be completed on the out of state placement under the Interstate Compact 
for the Placement of Children (ICPC). For more information, see the ICPC section of the 
tool kit. 

Non-Offending Parent
At the conclusion of a full adversary hearing, if the court does not order the return of the child 
to the parent, managing conservator, possessory conservator, guardian, caretaker, or custodian 
entitled to possession from whom the child is removed, the court must order that possession 
of the child be awarded to a parent who did not cause the immediate danger or who is not the 
perpetrator of the neglect or abuse unless the court finds:

140

IV. Concurrent Issues•	 The person cannot be located after exercise of due diligence or the person is unable or 

unwilling to take possession of the child; or

•	 Reasonable  efforts  have  been  made  to  enable  the  person’s  possession,  but  possession 
presents a continuing danger to the physical health or safety of the child caused by an 
act or failure to act of the person, including a danger that the child would be a victim 
of trafficking under Tex. Fam. Code § § 20A.02 or 20A.03, Penal Code. Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 262.201(g-1).

Kinship and Fictive Kin Options
CHILD PLACEMENT RESOURCES FORM

If DFPS determines that removal of the child may be warranted, a proposed Child Placement 
Resources Form must be provided to the parent. Tex. Fam. Code § 261.307(a)(2). DFPS may 
place  a  child  with  a  relative  or  other  designated  caregiver  identified  in  the  proposed  Child 
Placement Resources Form if: 

•	 DFPS determines that the placement is in the best interest of the child; and
•	 DFPS completes a background and criminal history check and conducts a preliminary 
evaluation of the relative or other designated caregiver’s home before the child is placed 
with the relative or other designated caregiver. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.114 (b).

DFPS  may  place  a  child  before  conducting  the  home  study  required  by  Tex.  Fam.  Code  § 
262.114(a), but not later than 48 hours after the time that the child is placed with a relative or 
other designated caregiver, DFPS must begin the home study of the relative or other designated 
caregiver. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.114(b). 

Until DFPS identifies an appropriate substitute caregiver, it must continue to explore placement 
options,  including  asking  the  child  in  a  developmentally  appropriate  manner  to  identify  any 
adult, particularly one residing in the child’s community, who may be a relative caregiver or a 
designated caregiver. 

CAREGIVER VISIT WITH CHILD; INFORMATION PROVIDED BY DFPS

Before placing a child with a proposed relative or other designated caregiver, DFPS must: 

•	 arrange a visit between the child and the proposed caregiver; and 
•	 provide the proposed caregiver with a form (which may be the same form DFPS provides 
to a non-relative caregiver) containing information, to the extent it is available, about 
the child that would enhance continuity of care for the child, including: 
o  the child’s school information and educational needs; 
o  the child’s medical, dental, and mental health care information; 
o  the child’s social and family information; and 
o  any  other  information  about  the  child  DFPS  determines  will  assist  the  proposed 

caregiver in meeting the child’s needs. Tex. Fam. Code §264.7541(a).

DFPS may waive the requirements if the proposed relative or other designated caregiver has 
a long-standing or significant relationship with a child and has provided care for the child at 
any time during the 12 months preceding the date of the proposed placement. Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 264.7541(b). 

141

IV. Concurrent IssuesQUESTIONS  TO  ASK  RELATED  TO  POTENTIAL  KINSHIP  AND  FICTIVE 
KIN PLACEMENT OPTIONS

•	 If the child is in a foster care placement, what efforts were/are being made to explore 

kinship and fictive kin placement options?

•	 Have the parents and the child been asked to identify kinship and fictive kin placement 

options?

•	 Have  home  studies  been  started?  If  the  home  study  will  be  outside  of  Texas,  it  will 
involve the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) unless it involves a 
biological parent. Out of state home studies take significantly longer than in-state home 
studies  and  must  be  initiated  as  soon  as  possible  in  order  not  to  delay  permanency. 
Please see additional information in the ICPC section of this tool kit.

•	 If relatives were identified but deemed inappropriate by DFPS, what were the specific 

reasons? Was the placement assessed under Tex. Fam. Code § 264.754?

•	 Are there services or supports available to mitigate any safety risks identified in the 

•	 If the child is in a kinship placement, has the placement been provided with appropriate 

training, services, and support to care for the child?

The Child’s Needs
•	 Does  the  placement  meet  the  child’s  educational  needs  and  provide  educational 

home study?

continuity?

•	 Is the child’s trauma being sufficiently considered in determining the child’s placement?
•	 Is the placement knowledgeable about helping children with traumatic stress reactions 
and  how  to  cope  with  those  reactions?  If  not,  what  training  or  support  is  needed/
available?

•	 Does  the  placement  understand  the  reasonable  and  prudent  parent  standard  and 

support normalcy for the child?

•	 Are  the  siblings  placed  together?  If  not,  what  efforts  were  made  to  attempt  to  place 
them  together?  Is  there  a  safety  issue  that  prevents  the  siblings  from  being  placed 
together? How frequently are sibling visits occurring? Are the siblings able to regularly 
communicate with each other?

•	 Has the AAL regularly contacted the child to inform them of the next steps? Has the 
AAL checked on the child’s thoughts and feelings about the current placement options? 

Children Without Placement (CWOP)
If DFPS or an SSCC is unable to secure a licensed placement for a child in DFPS conservatorship, 
the child must receive temporary emergency care provided directly by DFPS or an SSCC until 
a licensed appropriate placement can be found. DFPS or the SSCC must provide notice to the 
court no later than the next business day after the date the child is placed in temporary care. 
Tex. Fam. Code §264.107(g).

Children are forbidden by statute to stay overnight in a DFPS office, so the child must stay in 
another location (i.e., hotel, apartment) while being supervised by DFPS staff. Tex. Fam. Code 
§264.1071. While this situation should be avoided whenever possible, the number of children 
without placement are very low compared to the overall population of children in care across 
Texas.

142

IV. Concurrent IssuesCAUSES AND RISK FACTORS

There is no single reason why some children in the conservatorship of DFPS might experience a 
lapse in licensed placement. However, the combination of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
increased federal and state oversight, and placement capacity gaps are some factors that may 
have contributed to an increasing number of children in Texas entering CWOP. 

Children who are at higher risk of CWOP include:

•	 Older children
•	 Children with behavior issues
•	 Children released from psychiatric hospitals
•	 Children released from juvenile detention
•	 Children moving to or from a residential treatment center (RTC)
•	 Children with special needs (i.e., Autism) 

IMPACTS OF CWOP ON CHILDREN 

Instability

•	 Overnight stays in DFPS offices are forbidden by statute, but children without placement 
may stay in hotels or apartments overnight and may stay in DFPS offices during daytime 
hours.  Such  unlicensed  placements  are  intended  as  a  short-term  solution,  but  some 
children may experience this for longer periods of time.

•	 The  child’s  formal  education  may  be  interrupted  and  there  may  be  limited  access  to 

informal education resources such as tutors or study sessions. 

•	 Therapy for the children can be inconsistent during temporary placements. 
•	 Not having a stable, licensed placement can be a traumatic experience for children. 

Practice  Tip:  Children  in  CWOP  who  are  staying  in  hotels,  offices,  or  dorms  on  a 
temporary basis meet the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (“McKinney-
Vento”)  definition  of  homeless,  and  therefore  the  child  is  entitled  to  attend  the  school 
that the child attended when permanently housed or the school in which the child was 
last enrolled, with transportation and other services provided by the district. 42 U.S.C. 
§ 11431 et seq. 

•	 The  children  are  supervised  and  provided  for  by  caseworkers  and  other  DFPS  staff. 

These duties are in addition to existing work responsibilities. 

•	 Caseworkers  and  staff  must  ensure  that  an  adult  is  always  present,  but  there  is  no 

consistent caregiver or supervisor. 

•	 DFPS caseworkers and staff are not trained as childcare providers.

Supervision

Safety

•	 Children without placement may be at increased risk of running away or becoming a 

victim of child sex trafficking. 

143

IV. Concurrent Issues•	 Unsupervised access to medication can lead to improper dosage or the proper medication 

regime not being followed.

•	 Children  with  serious  mental  health  or  behavioral  needs  may  interact  with  other 

children without adequate supervision.

•	 Without  training  and  options  for  discipline,  conflicts  between  children  or  between 

children and staff can escalate and increase the risk of injury or arrest. 

Basic Needs

•	 Older youth do not have the support or living space available to build healthy life skills 
such as hygiene, cleaning/chores, getting regular physical activity outdoors, cooking a 
healthy meal, etc. 

•	 Making visitation arrangements with parents is more complicated when the child does 

not have a stable placement.

Identifying Alternatives to CWOP

•	 DFPS can assist in moving a child out of CWOP by thoroughly investigating alternative 

placements. For example, DFPS might:

•	 Identify whether there are relatives or fictive kin who may not meet DFPS approval but 

•	 Contact potential relatives or fictive kin placement and consider meeting with them in 

could be a safe place for this child.

their homes, if appropriate.

•	 Review  and  reconsider  prior  placement  options  that  were  not  previously  approved  or 
that broke down. Determine whether anything can be done to help support placement 
in these homes. 

•	 Consider contacting treatment centers that do not contract with DFPS about availability. 
•	 Request the child’s common app, review for accuracy, and edit, if appropriate. 

144

IV. Concurrent IssuesChild Support and Kinship Support

CHILD SUPPORT

Child support may be ordered:

later;

All parents have a duty to support their child. The Court may order either or both parents to 
support a child in any of the following ways per Tex. Fam. Code § 154.001.

•	 Until the child is 18 years of age or until graduation from high school, whichever occurs 

•	 Until the child is emancipated through marriage, removal or disabilities or minority by 

a court order, or by other operation of law;

•	 Until the death of the child, or
•	 If the child is disabled as defined in Tex. Fam. Code § 154.302, for an indefinite period.

The Court may order each parent who is financially able to support a child for whom DFPS has 
been appointed managing conservator.

•	 This support continues until the earliest of:

o  the child’s adoption;
o  the child’s 18th birthday or graduation from high school, whichever occurs later;
o  the removal of the child’s disabilities of minority by court order, marriage or other 

operation of law; or
o  the death of the child; or
o  if  the  child  is  disabled  as  defined  in  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  154.302,  for  an  indefinite 

period.

If a court presiding over a SAPCR involving DFPS orders child support payments or modifies 
child support payments that requires the payments be made to DFPS, the court must notify the 
Texas Office of the Attorney General within 10 days.

Note  that  upon  terminating  a  parent’s  rights,  the  Court  may  order  that  parent  to  pay  child 
support post-termination. Tex. Fam. Code § 154.001(a-1). In the absence of evidence of a party’s 
resources,  the  court  shall  presume  that  the  party  has  income  equal  to  the  federal  minimum 
wage for a 40-hour week. Tex. Fam. Code § 154.068. Note also that incarceration of a parent 
cannot  be  considered  intentional  unemployment  or  underemployment  when  establishing  or 
modifying child support. 

When computing net resources available for payment of child support, refer to charts and tables 
in Texas Family Code Chapter 154, Subchapter B. There you will find child support tax charts, 
definitions of net resources, additional factors for court to consider; application of guidelines to 
net resources, and computing a support for children in more than one household, etc.

Practice Tip: The Texas Office of the Attorney General (OAG) website has a Monthly 
Child Support Calculator available online.

Practice Tip: When child support is ordered, the court shall order that child support be 
payable through the state disbursement unit (SDU). See Tex. Fam. Code § 154.004(a). 
The  Texas  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  (OAG)  monitors  payment  of  child  support 
through the SDU and if a delinquency occurs, the OAG has a right to seek enforcement 
of child support and may at some point initiate proceedings to enforce the payment of 
child support. Texas law requires the court to order that income be withheld from the 
disposable earnings of the obligor for the payment of child support. See Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 158.001. The OAG prescribes forms as authorized by federal law in a standard format 
entitled “Income Withholding for Support (IWO) Form, Instructions & Sample.” See Tex. 
Fam. Code § 158.106(a). The form is published in the Texas Administrative Code, Title 
1, Section 55.118 and is available online.

Relative and Kinship Placement Support
RELATIVE OR OTHER DESIGNATED CAREGIVER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 
(RODC)

The relative and other designated caregiver program (RODC) supports continuity and stability 
for children in the conservatorships of DFPS by providing financial assistance to eligible kinship 
caregivers.  Under  the  RODC,  DFPS  may  enter  into  Caregiver  Assistance  Agreements  (CAA) 
with a relative or other designated caregiver who has not been verified as a foster parent or 

146

IV. Concurrent Issuesotherwise licensed to provide 24-hour residential childcare to provide monetary assistance for 
caring for children in the Temporary Managing Conservatorship of DFPS. 

Caregivers without PMC of the child are eligible for the monthly RODC reimbursement payment 
and Medicaid coverage for the child if:

•	 The child they are caring for is currently in the managing conservatorship of DFPS; 
•	 They have been they have an approved home assessment; 
•	 They are not already verified as a foster parent or as a group home and receiving foster 

care maintenance payments; 

•	 They sign and abide by a Caregiver Assistance Agreement including a commitment to:

o  be available as a continuing placement for the child for at least six months;
o  participate in specialized kinship training as recommended by DFPS;
o  comply with DFPS requirements limiting or facilitating contact between the parents 

and the child;

child may be eligible; 

o  apply for other forms of assistance, including financial and medical for which the 

o  comply with any other child-specific requirements or limitations; and
•	 The total household income does not exceed 300% of the federal poverty limit.

The monthly RODC reimbursement payments are available for up to 12 months after placement 
of the child in the caregiver’s home with a one-time, six-month extension for good cause. 

Examples of circumstances that justify good cause for payments to go beyond 12 months include:

•	 Attempting to find a previously absent parent of the child; 
•	 Awaiting the expiration of the timeline for an appeal of an order in a suit affecting the 

•	 Allowing  additional  time  fork  in  caregiver  to  complete  the  approval  process  for 

parent child relationship; 

verification or adoption of a child; 

•	 Waiting for approval of the child placement from another state; 
•	 A  delayed  determination  of  the  child’s  “Indian  child”  status,  or  when  awaiting  the 

approval of the Indian child’s Tribe; or 

•	 Any other circumstance involving the child or caregiver that DFPS deems as justification 

for an extension. 

If the child moves, the payment will follow the child, but the duration of the payment stays the 
same. For example, if a child lives with an eligible grandmother for four months and then moves 
to an eligible aunt home for eight months, the 12-month payment does not restart for the aunt.

If a caregiver receives PMC of a child, the caregiver can request a $500 annual reimbursement 
per child for child related costs (no Medicaid) if:

•	 The child they are caring for was previously in the managing conservatorship of DFPS; 
•	 The child was placed in the home by DFPS; 
•	 The caregiver meets all of the requirements for caregivers without PMC (e.g., not be a 

licensed or verified foster caregiver);

IV. Concurrent Issues•	 They have obtained PMC of the child after September 1, 2017; 
•	 They continue to comply with the signed caregiver assistance agreement; and 
•	 The total household income does not exceed 300% of the federal poverty limit. 

If the caregiver with PMC qualifies for the yearly RODC reimbursement payment, DFPS can 
reimburse caregivers on this amount for up to three years or until the child turns 18, whichever 
comes first.

PERMANENCY CARE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (PCA)

The goal of the Permanency Care Assistance (PCA) program is to provide financial support to 
kinship caregivers who want to provide a permanent home to children who can’t be reunited 
with their parents.

Kinship  Caregivers  are  often  relatives  and  other  people  who  have  played  significant  roles  in 
rearing children when parents are having a difficult time. These individuals play a vital role in 
providing children with stability when they can’t live with their birth parents.

DFPS  may  enter  into  a  PCA  agreement  with  the  kinship  provider  who  is  the  perspective 
managing conservator of a foster child only if the kinship provider meets the eligibility criteria 
under federal and state law and DFPS rule. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.852(b). 

In order to qualify for PCA, the child must:

•	 Have been previously in the managing conservatorship of DFPS;
•	 Have been placed in the home by DFPS;
•	 Have  demonstrated  a  strong  attachment  to  the  prospective  permanent  kinship 

•	 Not have reunification or adoption as a permanency option (DFPS has ruled these out 

•	 If at least 14 years of age, have been consulted by DFPS about the prospective permanent 
kinship conservator’s commitment to assume permanent managing conservatorship of 
the child; and

•	 Have resided in the caregiver’s home while licensed/verified for at least six consecutive 

conservator;

for the child);

months.

Note: PCA benefits continue until the child turns 18 or 21 if the child is 16 years old or 
older when adopted.

The caregiver must:

•	 Be a relative of the child or have had a longstanding and significant relationship with 

the child prior to DFPS placing the child in the home;

•	 Have a strong commitment to caring permanently for the child;
•	 Have been eligible for the receipt of foster care reimbursements on behalf of the child 
(i.e., caregiver must become a licensed or verified foster parent to the child) for at least 
six consecutive months prior to the effective date of the permanency care assistance;
•	 Enter into a permanency care assistance agreement with DFPS on behalf of the child 

prior to becoming the child’s permanent kinship conservator; and

•	 Obtain PMC of the child.

148

IV. Concurrent IssuesThe court must NOT issue an order that includes any of the following:

•	 Naming either of the child’s parents as Joint Managing Conservator (JMC) of the child;
•	 Naming DFPS as JMC of the child; or
•	 Awarding possessory  conservatorship to any parent of the child under circumstances 

DFPS determines have the effect of reunifying the child with that parent.

Practice Tip: The earlier the relative/caregiver begins the process, the earlier they can 
become eligible to finalize a PCA agreement which can increase options for negotiation 
at the end of the case and avoid unnecessary extensions of the dismissal deadline. Courts 
are also required to inform relatives caring for children of the ability to apply for PCA 
at the Adversary Hearing, Status Hearing, and Permanency Hearings before and after a 
final order. Tex. Fam. Code §§ 262.201(n-1), 263.202(i), 263.306(c)(2), 263.5031(3).

 

149

IV. Concurrent IssuesVisitation

TEMPORARY VISITATION SCHEDULE

A  temporary  visitation  schedule  is  required  early  in  a  case  for  each  child  whose  goal  is 
reunification.  The  caseworker  develops  the  schedule  with  the  child’s  parents  to  the  extent 
possible.

DFPS  shall  ensure  that  a  parent  who  is  otherwise  entitled  to  possession  of  the  child  has  an 
opportunity to visit the child not later than the fifth day after the date DFPS is named temporary 
managing conservator of the child unless:

•	 DFPS determines that visitation is not in the child’s best interest; or
•	 Visitation with the parent would conflict with a court order relating to possession of or 

access to the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.115; or
•	 DFPS has determined the goal is not reunification. 

The temporary schedule remains in effect until the visitation plan is developed under Tex. Fam. 
Code § 263.107 or modified by court order. 

COURT IMPLEMENTATION OF VISITATION PLAN

Not later than the 30th day after the date DFPS is named TMC of a child for whom the goal 
of DFPS is reunification with the parent, DFPS must develop a visitation plan in collaboration 
with each parent. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.107. In determining the frequency and circumstances 
of visitation, DFPS is to consider the safety and best interest of the child, the child’s age, the 
desires of each parent regarding visitation with the child, the location of each parent and the 
child, and the resources available to DFPS, including resources to ensure visitation is properly 
supervised and providing transportation to the visit. 

DFPS must file the family’s visitation plan no later than 10 days before the Status Hearing. 
Tex. Fam. Code § 263.107(d). After reviewing an original or amended visitation plan, the court 
shall  render  an  order  regarding  a  parent’s  visitation  with  a  child  that  the  court  determines 
appropriate.

If the court finds that visitation between a child and a parent is not in the child’s best interest, 
the court shall render an order that:

•	 States the reasons for finding that visitation is not in the child’s best interest; and
•	 Outlines specific steps the parent must take to be allowed to have visitation with the 

child.

If the order regarding visitation between a child and a parent requires supervised visitation to 
protect the health and safety of the child, the order must outline specific steps the parent must 
take to have the level of supervision reduced. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.109.

DFPS BEST PRACTICE GUIDE

DFPS issued a Child and Family Visitation Best Practice Guide for the field in 2015, which is 
available online. 

This  guide  provides  Department  employees  with  policy,  guidance,  and  tools  to  assess  the 
appropriateness  of  visitation,  how  to  develop  the  visitation  plan,  how  to  engage  fathers  and 
other family members in the visitation process, the role of the foster parents, and how to move 
from one level of supervision to another. 

150

IV. Concurrent IssuesBASIC PRINCIPLES PROMOTED BY THE BEST PRACTICE GUIDE

Visitation is essential for a child’s well-being

The  primary  purpose  of  visitation  is  to  maintain  the  parent-child  attachment,  reduce  a 
child’s  sense  of  abandonment,  and  preserve  their  sense  of  belonging  as  part  of  a  family  and 
community. A child needs to see and have regular contact with their parents and siblings, as 
these relationships are the foundation of child development. Visitation facilitates permanency 
planning,  promotes  timely  reunification,  and  helps  in  decision  making  process  to  establish 
alternative permanency plans. Additionally, visitation maintains and supports the parent-child 
relationship necessary for successful reunification.

Maintaining  family  connections  has  lifelong  significance  for  the  child.  Regular  visitation 
maintains their relationships with siblings and others who have significant role in the child’s 
life. When a child loses family connections, they also lose family history, medical history, and 
cultural history and information. Visitation is considered to be the heart of reunification, but 
even  when  reunification  is  not  likely,  parents,  siblings,  and  extended  family  continue  to  be 
important  in  the  child’s  life.  The  absence  of  regular  and  frequent  parent-child  visitation  or 
contact may have serious consequences for both the child and parents. Without visitation the 
relationship can deteriorate, and both can become emotionally detached. When the parent-child 
attachment suffers, reunification becomes more difficult. 

Benefits of Parent-Child Visitation
•	 Supports parent-child attachment
•	 Eases the pain of separation for all 
•	 Maintains and strengthens family relationships 
•	 Reassures the child that their parents/primary caregivers are all right and helps the 

child to not blame themselves for placement in foster care 
•	 Supports the family in dealing with changing relationships 
•	 Motivates parent(s) to make positive changes in their life by providing reassurance that 

the parent-child relationship is important for the child’s well-being 

•	 Provides opportunities for parent(s) to learn and try new skills 
•	 Supports a child adjustment to the foster home 
•	 Enables  the  parent(s)  to  be  active  and  stay  current  in  their  child  development, 

educational and medical needs, and church and community activities 

•	 Provides  opportunities  for  parent(s)  to  assess  how  their  child  is  doing,  and  share 

information about how to meet their child needs 

•	 Assists in the assessment and decision-making process regarding parenting capacities 

and permanency goals 

•	 Reduces the time in out-of-home care 
•	 Increases the likelihood of reunification 

Supervision

If DFPS recommends to the court that visits be supervised, the visitation plan should include 
a  summary  statement  of  the  assessed  safety  reasons  supervision  is  necessary.  In  addition, 
parents should clearly understand the specific safety factors preventing less restrictive contact 

151

IV. Concurrent Issueswith their child and what demonstrated changes will assist a caseworker in being able to make 
recommendations lifting supervision requirements. 

DFPS  has  adapted  a  stages  of  supervision  guide  which  provides  descriptions  of  levels  of 
supervision. Caseworkers can use this tool for assessment and planning to help determine and 
clearly communicate the structure of a supervised visitation plan. Additional guidance related 
to this assessment tool can be found in the 2015 DFPS Child and Family Visitation Best Practice 
Guide.

DFPS Review and revision of visitation plan

Per DFPS, the visitation plan should be reviewed monthly to determine progress, update goals, 
and determine if it is appropriate to consider changes in supervision, location, and setting. If 
there  has  been  little  or  no  progress  towards  developing  protective  actions  and  meeting  case 
goals  found  during  two  consecutive  monthly  reviews,  the  caseworker  is  directed  to  initiate  a 
formal or informal family meeting to determine how to modify the visitation plan to include a 
more intensive level of parent coaching/guidance around visitation. 

152

IV. Concurrent IssuesOlder Youth in Foster Care

An attorney representing DFPS must be aware of several specific duties DFPS and the courts 
have regarding older youth, as well as best practices that can help prevent negative outcomes 
for youth who age out of DFPS care.

LEGAL REQUIREMENTS BEFORE A YOUTH’S 18TH BIRTHDAY

Medical Consent

Once a child turns 16, the child may request that the court authorize the child to consent to 
their own medical care. If a child is their own medical consenter, the child’s caseworker must 
consult with the child about their medical care.

Identification Issues

By age 16, DFPS must provide youth with original or certified copies of the following:

•	 Birth certificate
•	 SSI card
•	 Texas driver’s license or identification card

By age 18, DFPS must provide youth with the following:

•	 Immunization records
•	 Health passport
•	 A Medicaid card or other proof of Medicaid enrollment or insurance card from the health 

plan that provides health coverage to the youth

Before a youth leaves foster care, if the youth is age 14 or older, DFPS must ensure that the 
youth has an e-mail address through which the youth may receive encrypted copies of personal 
documents and records.

PREPARING FOR TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD

Preparation for Adult Living

The  Preparation  for  Adult  Living  (PAL)  program  involves  an  independent  living  skills 
assessment, life skills classes, transition planning, conferences, and training events. Services 
may start as early as age 14 but must absolutely be enrolled by age 16. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.121. 
PAL  services  are  usually  offered  by  local  service  providers  who  will  also  provide  voluntary 
aftercare case management for the youth between age 18 and age 21. DFPS has dedicated PAL 
coordinators to help youth access benefits when they leave care.

Youth  with  disabilities  should  not  be  excluded  from  the  PAL  program.  DFPS  must  make 
appropriate  accommodations  that  allow  for  meaningful  participation.  Tex.  Fam.  Code  § 
264.121(a)(4). 

Circle  of  Support  (COS)  meetings  will  be  scheduled  for  youth  who  are  on  track  to  age  out  of 
foster care. A COS is centered on the youth and is the preferred method of transition planning. 
The  youth  is  permitted  to  invite  foster  care  providers,  teachers,  parents,  siblings,  relatives, 
mentors,  attorneys,  CASAs,  and  friends.  In  addition  to  attending  the  COS  attorneys  should 
help  prepare  the  youth  for  the  COS.  A  COS  may  feel  intimidating  to  a  youth  but  going  over 
the  structure  and  purpose  of  the  meeting  in  advance  can  help  reduce  anxiety,  this.  This  is 
particularly important as the effects of trauma can impede the youth’s ability to plan ahead and 

153

IV. Concurrent Issuessee a future for themselves. If an initial COS does not adequately address the youth’s transition 
needs, a child’s attorney can request an additional COS and help the youth plan ahead for the 
meeting.

Extended Foster Care
Tex. Fam. Code §§ 263.601- 263.608 

Youth who wish to remain in extended foster care after their 18th birthday must meet one of 
the following eligibility criteria:

•	 Attend  high  school  or  a  program  leading  to  a  high  school  diploma  or  a  high  school 

equivalency certificate (GED); or

•	 Attend college or higher learning institution, or post-secondary vocational program or 

technical program (6 credit hour minimum); or

•	 Participate in an employment program or activity that promotes or removes barriers to 

employment; or

•	 Work at a job at least 80 hours per month; or
•	 Have a documented medical condition that limits other activities.

Not later than six months before the youth’s 18th birthday, DFPS must complete all necessary 
paperwork to ensure the youth has housing on the date the youth enters extended foster care. 
DFPS must also review the qualifications and requirements for the youth’s housing not later 
than 90 days before their 18th birthday. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.1214.

Supervised Independent Living (SIL) is a program available only to youth in extended foster 
care  that  allows  them  to  live  independently  in  a  supervised  living  arrangement  while  their 
expenses  are  paid  by  DFPS.  SIL  placement  locations  can  be  apartments,  college  dorms,  or 
shared housing. If permitted by the property owner, DFPS should allow the youth to cosign the 
lease for their housing.

If a youth chooses not to remain in extended foster care, they can return any time before they 
turn  21,  as  long  as  there  are  placements  available.  This  is  an  available  option  regardless  of 
whether the Trial Independence period has ended or if the court still has Extended Jurisdiction.

TRANSITIONAL SERVICES AND BENEFITS

Healthcare

•	 Former Foster Care Children’s Medicaid (FFCC): Young adults are eligible only 
if  they  received  federally  funded  Medicaid  on  their  18th  birthday;  this  benefit  is  not 
means-tested; youth are eligible for this benefit until age 26.

•	 Medicaid for Transitioning Foster Care Youth (MTFCY): Young adults are eligible 
for this benefit if they were not receiving federally funded Medicaid, but were in DFPS 
conservatorship, on their 18th birthday. Youth are eligible for this benefit until age 21 
and must be under 400% of the Federal Poverty Guideline.

•	 Maintaining Medicaid Eligibility: All Medicaid recipients, including youth formerly 
in foster care, must renew their Medicaid eligibility once every 12 months. To ensure 
continuous coverage, youth must provide their current mailing address to HHSC. If the 
youth’s address changes without noticing HHSC, and HHSC receives returned mail and 
cannot locate the youth, the youth’s Medicaid benefits will be denied. A youth can report 

154

IV. Concurrent Issuesan  address  change  online  through  YourTexasBenefits.com,  the  Your  Texas  Benefits 
mobile app, calling 211, in person at a local Medicaid eligibility office or by in writing 
by mail or by fax. Youth must also respond to requests for information from HHSC and 
may need to verify that they are a Texas resident and/or their immigration status.

Transitional Expenses

•	 Transitional Living Allowance (TLA): This cash benefit of $1,000 is available in two 
separate payments of $500 each. It is available to young adults who were in foster care on 
their 18th birthday, who completed the PAL life skills class, and who are transitioning 
to independent or supervised living. Recipients must meet the same eligibility criteria 
as  extended  foster  care  and  must  receive  the  benefit  before  their  21st  birthday.  CPS 
Handbook § 10241.

•	 Aftercare Room and Board (ARB): This is an emergency benefit of up to a maximum 
of $3,000 paid, in increments of no more than $500 per month, directly to landlords or 
utility companies or as a grocery store gift card. It is available to young adults who were 
in foster care on their 18th birthday and demonstrate emergency financial need. They 
must  meet  the  same  eligibility  criteria  as  extended  foster  care  and  must  receive  the 
benefit before their 21st birthday. CPS Handbook § 10251.

Education

•	 Tuition/Fee Waiver: This benefit waives tuition and fees for all Texas public institutions 
of higher education (including 2-year colleges, 4-year universities, and technical schools). 
Eligible youth or young adults, including some youth who are reunified with parents, 
must enroll in a dual credit or college credit course before their 25th birthday to lock in 
the benefit. Once the benefit is activated, it does not expire. Tex. Educ. Code § 54.366. 
Adopted youth may also be eligible for the waiver. Tex. Educ. Code § 54.367.

•	 Education  and  Training  Voucher  (ETV):  This  is  a  federal  cash  benefit  of  up  to 
$5,000  per  year  for  expenses  related  to  college  or  training  programs  (e.g.,  housing, 
food, books, childcare, computer equipment, other expenses). Eligible young adults can 
receive the benefit until age 23 (available to more than only aged out foster youth). 40 
Tex. Admin. Code § 700.1613.

Practice Tip: DFPS is responsible for educating and working with current and former 
foster youth to access their benefits. Contact information for Regional Preparation for 
Adult  Living  Coordinators  as  well  as  State  Office  Program  Specialists  in  areas  such 
as  Transitional  Living  Services,  PAL,  Extended  Care/SIL/TJJD,  ETV/Youth  Program, 
Youth  Employment,  Youth  Housing,  and  a  Youth  Specialist,  is  available  online.  The 
Texas  Foster  Youth  Justice  Project  also  has  helpful  resources  that  can  help  youth 
understand the benefits in a way that is accessible to them.

EXTENDED JURISDICTION

Extended jurisdiction allows the court to retain a youth’s case on the court’s docket after the 
youth turns 18, hold review hearings to determine whether the youth is receiving appropriate 
services, and order DFPS to provide certain services to the youth. The court may not compel a 
youth to attend a hearing and the youth still maintains all the rights of any adult of the same 
age. Tex. Fam. Code §§ 263.601-263.608. When a young adult turns 18, DFPS conservatorship 
is dismissed. The young adult can choose to either remain in Extended Foster Care (EFC) or can 

155

IV. Concurrent Issuesexit DFPS’ care to live independently, also known as Trial Independence (TI). When a young 
adult makes a decision to remain in EFC or to begin TI, the young adult is considered to be in 
Extended Court Jurisdiction.

Transitional Living Services

A  young  adult  who  stays  in  EFC  may  or  may  not  be  receiving  Transitional  Living  Services 
(TLS). TLS are multipurpose and include circles of support, preparation for adult living classes, 
education and training vouchers, college tuition and fee waivers, and other related services and 
support of young people 16 to 21 or up to 22 years of age who are currently or formerly in foster 
care, or who are transitioning out of care.

PATHS FOR YOUNG ADULTS AGING OUT OF FOSTER CARE

Path 1 – Extended Foster Care (EFC)

A  young  adult  who  stays  in  EFC  may  or  may  not  be  receiving  Transitional  Living  Services 
(TLS). For a young adult in EFC, a review hearing is held every 6 months. A young adult can 
exit EFC for TI at any time prior to age 21. For those remaining in EFC, the Court’s extended 
jurisdiction ends at age 21.

Path 2 – Trial Independence

If at age 18 the young adult decides to not stay in EFC, he or she exits to Trial Independence 
(TI) which automatically extends up to six months. Trial Independence may be extended up to 
12 months by court order. The young adult can choose to return to EFC during the TI period or 
at any time before age 21. A young adult may or may not use TLS while in TI but receiving TLS 
effects the court’s extended jurisdiction over the youth’s case.

No hearings are required by the court during TI, but the young adult may request a hearing, or 
the court may set hearings on its own motion. At a hearing, a court may review and make orders 
regarding the services being provided to youth, identification documents the youth may need, 
and sibling contact if the youth has siblings in DFPS conservatorship.

Path 2A – Trial Independence without Transitional Living Services

If the young adult does not receive TLS, the court’s jurisdiction ends on the last day of the month 
in which the young adult’s TI period ends or upon the young adult’s 21st birthday, whichever is 
earlier, unless the court has extended jurisdiction until age 21.

Path 2B – Trial Independence with Transitional Living Services

If  the  young  adult  receives  TLS  during  TI,  the  young  adult  can  request  court  service  review 
hearings. When the young adult’s TI ends, the young adult can request a voluntary extension 
of  the  court’s  jurisdiction  beyond  the  TI  period  if  the  young  adult  is  currently  receiving 
transitional living services. If the court extends jurisdiction, the young adult can also request 
court service review hearings during this time period as well. The court’s jurisdiction ends when 
the young adult turns 21, or before, if the young adult withdraws consent to the court’s extended 
jurisdiction.

IV. Concurrent IssuesFamily First Preservation Services Act (FFPSA)

The Family First Prevention Services Act of 2018, also referred to as FFPSA, was signed into law 
as part of the Federal Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (H.R. 1892), FFPSA creates opportunities 
for  Title  IV-E  federal  funding  reimbursement  of  services  that  are  aimed  at  preventing  a 
child’s entry into foster care. Services include support for mental health, substance abuse, and 
other supports for parents. FFPSA has four central provisions aimed at increasing prevention 
services, support to kinship caregivers, addressing congregate care, and older youth. 

Prevention Services 

FFPSA allows for a 50% matching of federal Title IV-E funds for states who invest in evidence-
based prevention services for families with children who are at imminent risk of entering the 
foster care system. Programs can address mental health, substance abuse, and parenting skills 
and supports and must meet certain criteria set out in FFPSA for reimbursement eligibility. 

FFPSA provides support for kinship caregivers and Texas is working to develop, enhance, and 
evaluate Kinship Navigator programs. Currently, Texas caregivers can receive support through 
their DFPS kinship caseworker.

Kinship Caregivers 

Congregate Care 

In  an  effort  to  reduce  the  number  of  children  in  congregate  care,  Title  IV-E  federal  fund 
reimbursement is available to children in foster homes, qualified residential treatment programs 
(QRTP), and special settings for pregnant or parenting teens, youth transitioning out of foster 
care, and youth who are at risk for sex trafficking. QRTPs have a very strict model as defined 
within FFPSA, including court oversight.

Older Youth 

FFPSA extends the age for independent living services for young adults formerly in foster care 
up to age 23 and extends eligibility for Education and Training Vouchers (ETV) for qualifying 
youth to age 26. For more information, see the Older Youth in Care section of this tool kit. 

Family Preservation Services Pilot Program 

The Family Preservation Services pilot program allows DFPS to dispose of an investigation by 
allowing  the  child  to  return  home  and  providing  time-limited  family  preservation  services—
subject  to  Family  First  Prevention  Services  Act  (FFPSA)  qualifications—to  children  who  are 
candidates for foster care or who are pregnant and parenting foster youth. The pilot program 
must  be  implemented  in  one  urban  and  one  rural  jurisdiction  and  at  least  one  jurisdiction 
where Community Based Care has been implemented. The child’s safety must be the primary 
concern in authorizing services. DFPS must use Title IV-E Funds to pay for legal representation 
or provide counties with a matching reimbursement for the costs of legal representation and 
use the Texas Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program to provide in-home 
support services. DFPS must obtain a court order to compel the family of a candidate for foster 
care to participate in services but need not obtain a court order to provide services to pregnant 
or parenting foster youth. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.403. 

 

159

V. Federal LawIndian Child Welfare Act (ICWA)

Federal statutes governing the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) are 25 U.S.C. §§1901-1963; 
25 C.F.R. Part 23 Guidelines for Implementing the Indian Child Welfare Act (Bureau of Indian 
Affairs, 2016). Relevant state statutes are Tex. Fam. Code §§ 262.201(f), 263.202(f-1), 263.306(a-
1)(3).

STATUTES

PURPOSE 

The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA) is a federal law that imposes special standards 
and requirements when a child welfare agency seeks to intervene to protect an “Indian child,” 
as defined by statute. The law was enacted to protect not only Indian children, but their families 
and Tribes.

WHEN DOES ICWA APPLY?

ICWA applies to any “child custody proceeding” involving an “Indian child,” if the court “knows 
or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved.” 25 U.S.C. § 1912(a). 

Note: A case challenging the constitutionality of multiple elements of ICWA, (Brackeen 
v. Haaland, 994 F.3d 249 (5th Cir. 2021), is set for oral arguments before the Supreme 
Court of the United States in the October Term 2022. 

DEFINITION OF “INDIAN CHILD”

An “Indian child” is a child who is either:

•	 An unmarried person under age 18 who is either a member of an Indian tribe or
•	 Eligible for membership and the biological child of a member. 25 U.S.C. § 1903(4).

There are more than 500 federally recognized tribes and children from any of these tribes can 
be found in Texas. There are also three federally recognized tribes with reservations in Texas:

•	 Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, also known as the Tigua, in El Paso;
•	 Kickapoo Tribe of Texas, in Eagle Pass; and
•	 Alabama Coushatta Tribe of Texas near Livingston.

DFPS  enjoys  a  good  working  relationship  with  each  of  these  tribes.  A  child  residing  on  a 
reservation has specific legal protections 25 U.S.C. § 1911(a), and, in some cases, DFPS and the 
Tribe have a written protocol for handling these cases.

A Tribe’s determination regarding the child’s status is conclusive and a “state court may not 
substitute its own determination regarding a child’s membership or eligibility for membership 
in a Tribe or a parent’s membership in a Tribe.” 25 C.F.R. § 23.108(b).

Practice  Tip:  If  a  Tribe  fails  to  respond  after  being  properly  noticed,  counsel  should 
verify  that  the  agency  has  exercised  due  diligence  to  communicate  with  the  Tribe  by 
phone, fax, and/or email. 

HOW ARE ICWA CASES IDENTIFIED?

Texas  courts  are  required  to  ask  the  parties  whether  the  child  or  child’s  family  has  Native 
American heritage and to identify any Native American tribe the child may be associated with

If the court knows or has “reason to know” that an “Indian child” is the subject of a child welfare 
suit,  DFPS  must  give  each  parent  and  identified  tribe  and  any  Indian  custodian  (caretaker) 
notice of ICWA rights. 25 U.S.C. § 1912(a).

“Reason to Know” an Indian Child is Involved in the Case
A court has reason to know a child is an “Indian child” if:

•	 Any party, Tribe, or agency informs DFPS or court that the child is an Indian child; 
•	 Any participant, officer of the court or agency involved in the proceedings informs the 

court it has discovered such information; 

•	 The child gives the court reason to know they are an “Indian child;” 
•	 The domicile or residence of the child, parent or Indian custodian is on a reservation;
•	 The court is informed the child is or has been a ward of a Tribal court; or
•	 The court is informed either parent or the child has a Tribal membership card. 25 C.F.R. 

§ 23.107(c).

What Changes if a Case is Identified as an ICWA Case?
PLEADINGS

If ICWA applies, generally the best practice is to plead concurrently under the Family Code and 
ICWA.  In  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Houston  14th  District  Court  of  Appeals,  however,  pleadings 
should be limited to the ICWA findings, without parallel Family Code pleadings. In re W.D.H., 
43 S.W.3d 30 (Tex. App.—Houston 2001, pet. denied). HOTDOCS includes both types of ICWA 
pleadings.

TRIBAL AND STATE JURISDICTION

Whether the state court or Tribal court has jurisdiction over a case involving an Indian child 
depends  on  where  the  child  resides,  whether  transfer  to  the  Tribal  court  is  requested,  and 
whether an exception to the mandatory transfer provision applies. If a case involves an Indian 
child, however, the state court proceedings must comply with ICWA, whether or not the Tribe 
intervenes, or the case is transferred to a Tribal court.

Exclusive Jurisdiction on the Reservation

If the child’s residence or domicile is on the reservation, or if the child has been made a ward of 
the Tribal court, the Tribal court has exclusive jurisdiction, except when jurisdiction is otherwise 
vested in the state. 25 U.S.C. § 1911(a).

Emergency Exception

When  an  Indian  child  who  resides  on  a  reservation  is  temporarily  off  the  reservation  and 
emergency removal or placement is necessary “to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to 
the child,” the state child welfare agency may act despite the fact the Tribal court otherwise has 
exclusive jurisdiction. 25 U.S.C. § 1922. In such circumstances, the state child welfare agency 
must act promptly to: (1) end the removal or placement as soon as it is no longer necessary to 
prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child; and (2) move to transfer the case to the 
jurisdiction of the Tribe or return the child to the parents, as appropriate.

161

V. Federal LawConcurrent Jurisdiction Off the Reservation

If  the  child’s  residence  or  domicile  is  not  on  the  reservation,  the  Tribal  and  state  court  have 
concurrent  jurisdiction.  25  U.S.C.  §  1911(b).  Even  in  this  circumstance,  however,  there  is  a 
presumption  of  Tribal  jurisdiction  in  cases  involving  an  Indian  child.  Mississippi  Band  of 
Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U.S. 30 (1989).

NOTICE

ICWA  imposes  many  specific  requirements  governing  the  timing,  the  type  of  notice,  and  the 
persons and entities entitled to notice. In re R.R., 249 S.W.3d 213 (Tex. App —Fort Worth, Mar. 
19, 2009, no pet.). One overarching issue is that without notice, a Tribe cannot confirm or deny 
Indian child status. Even if a child turns out not to be subject to ICWA, if there is evidence of 
possible Indian child status, proof of compliance with notice requirements can be essential to 
counter a challenge based on violation of ICWA.

When is Notice Required?

Notice  is  required  for  each  “child  custody  proceeding.”  Defined  as  any  action  except  an 
emergency hearing that may result in a foster care placement, termination of parental rights, 
pre-adoptive placement, or adoptive placement, this means that any Suit Affecting the Parent 
Child Relationship filed by DFPS requires notice. 25 U.S.C. § 1912(a); 25 C.F.R. § 23.2.

Timing (10 + 20 days)

No “foster care placement or termination of parental rights” hearing can be held until at least 
ten (10) days after notice is received (subject to an additional 20 days if the parent/custodian/
tribe requests additional time for preparation). 25 U.S.C. § 1912(a); 25 C.F.R. § 23.112 (a). 

To avoid a delay and potential challenge to the court’s jurisdiction, the best practice is to set 
the initial hearing at least 30 days after notice is given (in effect, this assumes that a 20-day 
continuance is requested and granted).

When Identity of Parent / Indian Custodian is Known

Notice of a pending custody proceeding involving an Indian child must be sent to:

•	 Every known parent;
•	 Indian custodian;
•	 Each identified Tribe; and
•	 Regional  Director,  Bureau  of  Indian  Affairs  (a  representative  of  the  Secretary  of 

Interior). 25 U.S.C. § 1912(a); 25 C.F.R. § 23.11(a).

When Identity is Not Known

If the identity or location of a parent or Indian custodian is not known or the identity of the 
Tribe  cannot  be  determined,  Notice  to  Bureau  of  Indian  Affairs:  Parent,  Custodian  or 
Tribe of Child Cannot be Located or Determined must be sent to:

•	 Regional  Director,  Bureau  of  Indian  Affairs  (a  representative  of  the  Secretary  of 

Interior). 25 U.S.C. § 1912(a); 25 C.F.R. § 23.11(b).

How to Send Notice

DFPS notices include the required advisements which can be tailored with specific child and 

162

V. Federal Lawfamily information. A copy of the petition should be attached as well as any additional family 
history, including family trees or copies of membership cards. Family history information can 
be critical to a Tribe’s ability to determine membership status.

If a parent has requested anonymity, the agency and the court should maintain confidentiality 
and relevant court documents should be under seal. 25 C.F.R. § 23.107(d).

The  Regulations  will  allow  giving  notice  by  registered  or  certified  mail,  with  return  receipt 
requested  in  either  case.  25  C.F.R.  §  23.11(a);  25  C.F.R.  §  23.111(c).  As  a  practical  matter, 
certified  mail  is  preferred  because  this  allows  delivery  to  someone  other  than  the  addressee. 
If the intended recipient of registered mail is not available, registered mail must be returned 
to  sender,  making  it  necessary  to  resend  notice.  Notice  may  be  sent  by  personal  service  or 
electronically  in  addition,  but  this  does  not  satisfy  the  service  requirement.  25  C.F.R.  § 
23.111(c). Particularly where an email contact is provided, sending a duplicate notice this way 
is the best practice to expedite the process of determining a child’s status.

A copy of each notice sent, with the return receipt or other proof of service must be filed with the 
court and should be admitted into evidence at trial. 25 C.F.R. § 23.111(a)(2).

Parent/Indian Custodian

A parent includes the biological or adoptive parent of an Indian child, including a non-Indian 
parent.  25 U.S.C.  § 1903(9);  25  C.F.R. § 23.2. An alleged  father must acknowledge paternity 
or be legally determined to be the father before being recognized as a parent. In re V.L.R. 507 
S.W.3d 788 (Tex. App.—El Paso, Nov. 18, 2015, no pet.) (unidentified Tribe of a child’s unwed 
father who fails to establish paternity is not the child’s tribe).

A primary impact of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Baby Girl opinion was to limit the rights of a 
father who was a registered Tribal member but had never had custody of his child. The Court 
found  that  an  action  for  termination  of  parental  rights  against  such  a  father  could  proceed 
without meeting the higher burden of proof or standards in 25 U.S.C. § 1912(d) and (f). Adoptive 
Couple  v.  Baby  Girl,  133  S.Ct.  2552  (2013).  The  Court  reasoned  that  ICWA  was  designed  to 
prevent  the  breakup  of  an  Indian  family.  Under  these  specific  facts,  because  the  father  had 
never had custody of the child, the family was not being broken up. The impact of this decision 
is limited by the following:

•	 The Baby Girl decision does not impact other substantive rights under ICWA, including 

the right to notice and appointment of counsel for indigent parents; and

•	 A  Texas  court  declined  to  extend  the  Baby  Girl  rationale  to  a  parent  who  had  prior 
custody of an Indian child, albeit not for the preceding twelve years; In re V.L.R. 507 
S.W.3d 788 (Tex. App —El Paso, Nov. 18, 2015, no pet.).

Tex. Fam. Code § 263.202(a)(1) and CPS Policy Handbook § 5232 require that a diligent search 
be conducted and notice provided to a parent, including an alleged father. This section of the 
Family Code also requires certain findings be made by the court in its status order concerning 
whether the Department has exercised due diligence, among other required findings.

The  Regulations  now  define  “continued  custody”  to  include  physical  and/or  legal  custody 
(including under tribal law or custom) that a parent “already has or had at any point in the 
past,” and specify that a biological mother has had custody of a child. 25 C.F.R. § 23.2. 

“Indian custodian” is broadly defined as “any Indian person who has legal custody of an Indian 
child  under  Tribal  law  or  custom  or  under  State  law  or  to  whom  temporary  physical  care, 
custody, and control has been transferred by the parent of such child.” 25 U.S.C. § 1903(6).

163

V. Federal LawMore Than One Tribe

If a child has ties to more than one Tribe, notice to each Tribe is essential so that each Tribe 
can  make  a  determination  of  membership  or  eligibility.  If  more  than  one  Tribe  responds 
affirmatively, the Regulations direct the Tribes to designate the child’s Tribe and if the Tribes 
do not agree, the state court must do so, based on specified criteria. 25 C.F.R. § 23.109(c). 

Contact Information

The best resource for contact information for individual Tribes is the ICWA notice published 
in the Federal Register or the Bureau of Indian Affairs’ website using the ICWA Designated 
Agents Listing available online. 

For  Tribes  without  a  listing,  the  Regulations  mandate  contacting  the  Tribe  directly  to  find 
out  the  proper  contact  person.  If  the  Tribe  fails  to  respond  to  written  communication,  seek 
assistance from the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

After Initial ICWA Notice

Once the initial Notice of Pending Custody Proceeding Involving Indian Child is sent as required, 
send notice to the same listed persons and Tribes as follows:

•	 Unless or until a Tribe confirms a child is not a member or eligible for Tribal membership, 
DFPS will send notice of interim hearings, permanency planning meetings, family group 
conferencing or similar meetings to all persons and Tribes entitled to notice by regular 
first-class mail; and

•	 If the pleadings are amended, or a final hearing is set, DFPS will send a new Notice 
of  Pending  Custody  Proceeding  Involving  Indian  Child,  with  the  petition  and  any 
additional child and family history information attached, by certified or registered mail, 
return receipt requested. 25 U.S.C. § 1912(a); 25 C.F.R. § 23.111. As with the original 
petition, the return receipt should be filed with the court and entered as an exhibit at 
trial.

INITIAL HEARING

A hearing must be held where DFPS must show by clear and convincing evidence, including 
testimony of a qualified expert witness, that the parent’s continued custody “is likely to result 

164

V. Federal Lawin serious emotional or physical damage to the child,” to warrant a foster care placement. 25 
U.S.C.§  1912(e).  This  finding  cannot  be  made  until  10  days  after  notice  of  ICWA  has  been 
provided and is subject to a 20-day extension on request of a parent or Tribe. To avoid the need 
to continue the hearing, the best practice is to set this hearing at least 30 days out. ICWA also 
requires that DFPS make “active efforts” to reunify among other legal requirements.

Note: The hearing must occur no matter how far along in the case the confirmation is 
made that the child is an “Indian child.”

BURDEN OF PROOF

The burden of proof and standards for an order placing a child in foster care (in effect a removal) 
or a final order seeking permanent managing conservatorship or termination of parental rights 
are different than under the Texas Family Code. In summary, if ICWA applies the requirements 
are included below:

Foster Care Placement – Clear and Convincing Evidence

Including qualified expert testimony that continued custody by the parent or Indian custodian 
is  likely  to  result  in  serious  emotional  or  physical  damage  to  the  child  and  active  efforts  to 
provide remedial and rehabilitative services to prevent the breakup of the Indian family were 
made by DFPS and proved unsuccessful. 25 U.S.C. § 1912(d).

Termination of Parental Rights – Evidence Beyond a Reasonable Doubt

Including qualified expert testimony that continued custody by the parent or Indian custodian 
is  likely  to  result  in  serious  emotional  or  physical  damage  to  the  child  and  active  efforts  to 
provide remedial and rehabilitative services to prevent the breakup of the Indian family were 
made but proved unsuccessful. 25 U.S.C. § 1912(f).

Practice  Tip:  Best  Practices  for  Active  Efforts  Include  (1)  early  contact  and  active 
engagement with the child’s Tribe; (2) higher level of efforts using methods and providing 
services that are culturally appropriate; and (3) commitment to the spirit of ICWA in the 
context of the historical trauma. Remember that active efforts must be documented in 
detail in the record.

PLACEMENT

ICWA mandates that placements for foster care and adoption be made according to statutory 
preferences, unless good cause is shown to deviate from the preferences. 25 U.S.C. § 1915; 25 
C.F.R. § 23.129-131. 

The statutory preferences give priority as follows: 

Foster Care or Pre-Adoptive Placement Preferences

1.  A member of the child’s extended family;

2.  A foster home licensed, approved, or specified by child’s Tribe; 

3.  An  Indian  foster  home  licensed  or  approved  by  an  authorized  non-Indian  licensing 

authority; or

4.  An institution for children approved by the Tribe or operated by an Indian organization 
which has a program suitable to meet the child’s needs. 25 U.S.C. § 1915(b); 25 C.F.R. 
§ 23.131(b).

165

V. Federal LawFor an Adoptive Placement 

1.  A member of the child’s extended family; 

2.  Other members of the child’s Tribe; or

3.  Other Indian families. 25 U.S.C. § 1915(a); 25 C.F.R. § 23.130.

Departure from ICWA Placement Preference 

The  Tribe  can  by  resolution  alter  the  order  of  preferences.  25  U.S.C.  §  1915(c).  The  Tribe’s 
preference should then be followed as long as it is still the least restrictive setting appropriate 
to the needs of the child. 

If  a  party  (including  DFPS)  seeks  to  depart  from  the  placement  preferences,  the  party  must 
show by clear and convincing evidence, on the record or in writing, that there is ‘good cause’ to 
depart from the placement preferences. The court’s determination of good cause must be made 
on the record or in writing and be based on one or more of the following factors: 

•	 The request of the “Indian child’s” parent; 
•	 Request of the child of sufficient age and capacity; 
•	 Ability of placement to maintain sibling attachment; 
•	 The “extraordinary physical, mental, or emotional needs” of the child; and 
•	 The unavailability of a suitable placement (despite a diligent search and active efforts 

to locate one). 25 C.F.R. § 23.132(b)-(c).

MANDATORY TRANSFER TO TRIBAL COURT

A parent, an Indian custodian, or the child’s Tribe may petition the state court to transfer a suit 
involving an Indian child to the Tribal court. Transfer to the Tribal court is mandatory, unless 
the court makes a finding of good cause not to transfer, the Tribe declines transfer, or either 
parent objects. 25 U.S.C. § 1911(b); 25 C.F.R. § 23.117. 

The court cannot consider the following factors in assessing good cause: 

•	 The  advanced  stage  of  the  proceedings,  if  notice  to  the  Tribe  did  not  occur  until  an 

advanced stage; 

•	 Whether there was no petition to transfer in a prior proceeding involving the child; 
•	 Whether transfer would affect the child’s placement; The child’s cultural connections 

with the Tribe or its reservation; or 

•	 The socio-economic conditions of the Tribe, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) social services, 

or the judicial systems. 25 C.F.R. § 23.118(c).

RIGHT TO INTERVENE

The Tribe and the Indian custodian have the right to intervene in the state court action at any 
time  in  the  proceedings.  25  U.S.C.  §  1911(c).  Intervention  may  be  accomplished  informally, 
by  oral  statement,  or  formally.  Most  important,  if  an  Indian  child  is  involved,  ICWA  applies 
whether or not the child’s Tribe intervenes. 

QUALIFIED EXPERT WITNESS

The statute does not define what constitutes a qualified expert under ICWA. The Regulations 
require that an expert be qualified to testify as to whether the child’s continued custody by the 

166

V. Federal Lawparent or custodian is “likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage,” and direct that 
an expert should be qualified to testify as to the “prevailing social and cultural standards” of the 
child’s tribe. 25 C.F.R. § 23.122. The social worker assigned to the child’s case may not serve as 
an expert (although a caseworker may testify otherwise, as to the parent’s compliance with the 
service plan, visitation, and other issues).

Without question, the child’s tribe is the best source for an expert. If the tribe is in agreement 
with  the  agency’s  legal  strategy,  and  has  an  expert  willing  and  able  to  testify,  this  is  ideal. 
However, if a tribe has a policy against termination of parental rights or is not in agreement 
with  DFPS  on  a  specific  case,  finding  an  ICWA  expert  can  be  challenging.  Understandably, 
many tribal members do not want to take a position in a court proceeding adverse to a fellow 
tribal member and with very small tribes, the pool of potential experts is limited. 

Practice Tip: The DFPS Office of General Counsel may be able to assist in identifying 
expert witnesses. 

Courts with capability should allow participation by phone, video conferencing or other methods. 
25 C.F.R. § 23.133.

ICWA FINDING IS ESSENTIAL

The best practice is to request that the trial court make a finding on the record as to whether 
ICWA applies in every child welfare case. If the record is silent, a party may raise the issue on 
appeal, and an appellate court may remand the case for purpose of making this finding. By far 
the most significant impact of failing to identify an ICWA case is that if key ICWA provisions 
are violated, a final order can be invalidated. The remedy for violation of key ICWA provisions 
is a petition to invalidate. 25 U.S.C. § 1914. Similarly, if there is not sufficient information in 
the record to assess whether ICWA applies, an appeal can be abated. Either way, permanency 
is delayed.

PROSECUTOR PREPARATION

In every case, the prosecutor should confirm that DFPS has asked every parent, extended family 
member, and any child old enough, whether there is any Native American family heritage. The 
Court  must  also  instruct  the  parties  to  inform  the  court  of  any  such  information  that  arises 
later. 25 C.F.R. § 23.107(a).

If there is any indication of possible tribal family heritage, the prosecutor should confirm that 
DFPS has:

•	 Completed  an  Indian  Child  &  Family  Questionnaire  if  there  is  any  Native  American 

•	 Sent  a  formal  ICWA  notice  of  rights  to  each  potential  tribe,  parent  and  any  Indian 

family history; and

custodian (caretaker).

Notices  and  instructions  as  well  as  contact  information  for  all  federally  registered  tribes, 
regulations  guidelines  and  caselaw  summaries  are  available  in  the  Texas  Practice  Guide  for 
CPS Attorneys, Sections 4 and 13. 

Note: DFPS is in the process of updating the Texas Practice Guide for CPS Attorneys to ensure 
that the most current information is available.

V. Federal Law168

V. Federal LawInterstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC)

WHAT IS THE ICPC?

The Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) is a statutory agreement between 
all 50 states, the District of Colombia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands that governs the placement 
of children in the custody of one state into another state. 

If a child in foster care is to be placed in another state, the ICPC may require approval from that 
state. (See Tex. Fam Code Ch. 162, Subchapters B-C). When the ICPC applies, child protective 
services  in  that  state  provides  an  assessment  before  a  placement  and  monitoring  after  a 
placement. This is a multi-step administrative process between the sending and receiving states 
and can take some time to complete. The purpose of the ICPC is to ensure that children placed 
out of their home state receive the same protections and services that would be provided if they 
remained in their home state.

WHEN DOES THE ICPC APPLY?

Generally,  ICPC  applies  to  placements  for  adoption  or  foster  care,  and  in  group  homes  or 
residential placement.

WHEN DOES THE ICPC NOT APPLY?

•	 Birth parents placing with a non-custodial birth parent, or a relative as long as no court 

has assumed jurisdiction of the child to be placed;

•	 Relatives placing with birth parents or another relative as long as no court has assumed 

jurisdiction of the child to be placed;

•	 If a child is being placed in a hospital or school;
•	 Tribal Placements;
•	 Visits, as long as they meet the required criteria.

Practice  Tip:  Generally  speaking,  the  ICPC  process  moves  slowly.  The  prosecutor 
can request a court order for an expedited ICPC in certain circumstances. An order for 
an expedited ICPC only applies to the time frame in which DFPS must complete their 
portion of the process and send everything out to the receiving state. 

VISITATION OUTSIDE OF TEXAS (REGULATION 9, INTERSTATE COMPACT 
ON THE PLACEMENT OF CHILDREN, EFFECTIVE JUNE 27, 2002)

A  visit  is  excluded  from  the  ICPC  under  Regulation  9  if  it  is  for  a  brief  social  or  cultural 
experience; and

•	 The visit has a definite end date; and 
•	 The visit is no longer than 30 days, or begins and ends within a school vacation; and 
•	 There has been no request for a home study or supervision. 

PLACEMENT WITH A RELATIVE-EXPEDITED REQUESTS (REGULATION 7, 
INTERSTATE COMPACT ON THE PLACEMENT OF CHILDREN, EFFECTIVE 
OCTOBER 1, 2011)

An expedited order requires an approval or denial within 20 business days. A judge can sign an 
order for an expedited placement under Regulation 7 of the Interstate Compact on the Placement 

169

V. Federal Lawof Children if the proposed placement is with a parent (subject to non-custodial parent policy 
below), stepparent, grandparent, adult uncle or aunt, adult sibling, or legal guardian, and one 
of the following criteria apply:

•	 The  child  was  unexpectedly  placed  in  foster  care  because  the  parent/guardian  was 
recently incarcerated; is unable to care for the child due to a medical, mental, or physical 
condition; or is recently deceased;

•	 The child, or a sibling being placed with the child, is four years of age or younger;
•	 The court finds that the child or sibling has a substantial relationship with the proposed 

placement; or

•	 The child is currently in an emergency placement.

PLACEMENT WITH A NON-CUSTODIAL PARENT

State  courts  throughout  the  nation  have  reached  different  conclusions  on  whether  ICPC 
procedures apply when courts place a child with an out-of-state biological parent. Generally, 
due process prevents delaying placement with an out-of-state parent long enough to complete 
an ICPC request. 

Texas courts had followed the Association of Administrators of the Interstate Compact on the 
Placement of Children (AAICPC) Regulations that state ICPC procedures do apply to placement 
with parents in certain circumstances. For counties within the jurisdiction of the Fourth Court 
of Appeals, that Court has rejected outright application of the ICPC to an out-of-state parent. 
In the Interest of C.R.-A.A., 521 S.W.3d 893 (Tex. App. — San Antonio, no pet.).

To address child safety in this circumstance, DFPS policy requires the caseworker to assess an 
out-of-state parent without using the ICPC. CPS Handbook § 4513.1. If the assessment reveals 
no concerns, the court can place the child and dismiss the case as to that child without further 
monitoring. If the assessment reveals concerns, DFPS must request a noticed hearing and prove 
the parent’s unfitness in order to invoke the ICPC. CPS Handbook § 4513.13.

V. Federal LawSpecial Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS)

STATUTES

8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J); 8 C.F.R. § 204.11; United States Customs and Immigration Service 
Policy Manual

WHAT IS SPECIAL IMMIGRANT JUVENILE STATUS?

Federal law permits eligible foster children to “self-petition” for a Special Immigrant Juvenile 
visa, which is the first of a two-step process required to obtain permanent resident status (a 
“green card”). 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J).

WHAT DOES A STATE COURT HAVE TO DO WITH IMMIGRATION STATUS?

Federal law requires a predicate order from a family court (or other court with jurisdiction over 
the custody and care of juveniles such as a CPS proceeding) before a child can apply for SIJS. 
The family court or CPS court order must include these three findings:

•	 That the child has been “declared a dependent of the court or has been placed by the 
court under the custody of a state agency or an individual or entity appointed by the 
court;”

•	 That  reunification  of  the  child  with  one  or  both  parents  “is  not  viable  as  a  result  of 

abuse, neglect or abandonment or a similar basis found under state law;” and

•	 That it is “not in the child’s best interest to be returned to the parent or child’s country 

of origin or last habitual residence.”

USCIS policy now requires evidence of the factual basis for these statutory findings, in order 
to  demonstrate  that  the  order  is  bona  fide,  and  not  requested  primarily  for  the  purpose  of 
immigration relief. For this reason, all SIJS orders should reference the facts underlying each 
finding.

In addition, USCIS construes “lack of viable reunification” to mean “that the court intends its 
finding that the child cannot reunify with his or her parent (or parents) remains in effect until 
the child ages out of the juvenile court’s jurisdiction.” USCIS Policy Manual, Vol. 6, Part J., Ch. 
2. D.2.

If a child or youth has a SIJS order obtained before these policy changes, it may be necessary to 
request an amended SIJS order.

Practice Tip: If a child or youth in foster care was not born in the U.S., the prosecutor 
should check with the caseworker to find out if: 
•  Notice been sent to the foreign consul; 
•  Repatriation or placement in the home country is viable; or 
•  The child may need assistance to obtain immigration status or U.S. citizenship.

For  more  information,  consult  the  DFPS  Regional  Attorney  assigned  to  citizenship  and 
immigration issues. You may also refer to the Texas Practice Guide for CPS Attorneys, Section 
13, Citizenship & Immigration Issues, DFPS Citizenship Immigration Contacts list available 
online.

Note: DFPS is in the process of updating the Texas Practice Guide for CPS Attorneys to

V. Federal LawSchool Stability Under Federal & State Law

School is often a source of stability as well as a place for academic and social development of 
children and youth in foster care. If a child has been removed from their home or is changing 
placements, consider the potential impact on the child’s education and what efforts can be made 
to keep the child in the same school, if possible.

FEDERAL LAW

Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act, 43 U.S.C. § 675 et seq. Every 
Student  Succeeds  Act  (ESSA)  20  U.S.C.  §  6301  et  seq.  The  Individuals  with  Disabilities 
Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. Part 300.

STATE LAW

Texas Education Code, Texas Family Code

WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR SCHOOL STABILITY WHEN A CHILD IS TAKEN 
INTO DFPS CARE OR CHANGES PLACEMENT?

•	 A child’s initial placement into care, and any subsequent placement changes, must take 
into account the appropriateness of the child’s educational setting and the proximity to 
the school the child is enrolled in at the time of the placement or placement change. 42 
U.S.C. § 675(1)(G)(i).

•	 DFPS must coordinate with local schools and school districts to ensure that the child 
remains in the same school the child was attending at the time of the initial placement 
or any subsequent move, unless it is not in the child’s best interests to remain in that 
school. 42 U.S.C. § 675(1)(G) (ii)(I); 20 U.S.C. § 6311(g)(1)(E)(i).

•	 DFPS and the school district must collaborate to ensure that the child is transported to 

the previous school, if necessary. 20 U.S.C. § 6312(c)(5)(B).

•	 If remaining in the prior school is not in the child’s best interests, the child must be 
immediately  enrolled  in  a  new  school,  even  without  records  normally  required  for 
enrollment. 42 U.S.C. § 675(1)(G)(ii)(II); 20 U.S.C. § 6311 (g)(1)(E)(ii).

•	 DFPS must ensure the child’s education records are provided to the new school within 
30 days. State law requires TEA to ensure that the child’s school records are transferred 
to the new school not later than the 10th working day after the date the student begins 
enrollment at the school. Tex. Educ. Code §§ 25.002(g); 25.007(b)(1).

•	 The child is entitled to attend public school in the district in which the foster parents 
reside  free  of  any  charge  to  the  foster  parents  or  the  agency.  A  durational  residence 
requirement may not be used to prohibit a child from fully participating in any activity 
sponsored by the school district, including extracurricular activities. Tex. Educ. Code § 
25.001(f).

•	 Alternatively, the child is also entitled to continue to attend the school he or she was 
enrolled  in  before  entering  conservatorship,  or  at  the  time  of  a  placement  change, 
without payment of tuition, until he or she completes the highest grade offered at the 
school.  The  child  is  entitled  to  continue  to  attend  the  school  even  if  the  child  leaves 
conservatorship. Tex. Educ. Code § 25.001(g) - (g-1).

WHAT  IS  REQUIRED  IF  THE  CHILD  RECEIVES  SPECIAL  EDUCATION 
SERVICES?

•	 If a child with a disability who is eligible to receive special education services transfers 
to a new school district during the school year, the new district must provide the child 

172

V. Federal Lawservices comparable to those described in the child’s Individual Educational Program 
(IEP) from the previous district until the new district either adopts the child’s previous 
IEP or develops a new IEP, or, if the transfer is from another state, until the new district 
conducts an evaluation (if they determine it is necessary) and develops a new IEP. 20 
U.S.C. § 1414(d)(2)(C)(i); Tex. Educ. Code § 25.007(9); 19 Tex. Admin. Code § 89.1050(j).
•	 If  the  child  does  not  receive  special  education  but  a  disability  is  suspected,  the  child 
must be referred for a special education evaluation. An evaluation may be initiated by 
any person involved in the education or care of the student. 20 U.S.C. § 1414(a)(1).
•	 Children eligible to receive special education services must have a parent identified to 
make related decisions. If a parent does not retain education decision-making rights, 
the child is placed in a foster home, and the foster parent is willing and able, the foster 
parent will serve as parent for special education decision-making purposes. Otherwise, 
a surrogate parent must be appointed by the school, and can be appointed by the court, 
to make special education decisions on behalf of the child. Tex. Educ. Code §§ 29.015; 
29.0151; Tex. Fam. Code 263.0025.

A foster parent for a child may act as a parent for the child, as authorized under 20 U.S.C. § 
1415(b), if:

•	 The rights and duties of DFPS to make decisions regarding the child’s education under 

Tex. Fam. Code § 153.371 have not been limited by court order; and

•	 The  foster  parent  agrees  to  participate  in  making  special  education  decisions  on  the 
child’s  behalf  and  complete  a  training  program  that  complies  with  TEA  minimum 
standards  before  the  next  Admission,  Review,  and  Dismissal  (ARD)  meeting  but  no 
later than 90 days after assuming the role. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.0025(a-1), Tex. Educ. 
Code § 29.015 (a), and Tex. Educ. Code § 29.015(b).

HOW ARE THE COURT AND OTHER PARTIES INVOLVED IN EDUCATION 
STABILITY?

•	 DFPS must designate an individual to make the day-to-day educational decisions for a 
child in conservatorship, and must provide that individual’s name (as well as the name 
of any surrogate parent appointed for the child for special education decision-making 
purposes,  if  applicable)  to  the  court  and  the  child’s  school  within  five  days  after  the 
initial Adversary Hearing, and must update the court in the next permanency progress 
report  if  there  are  any  changes  to  the  education  decision-maker  or  surrogate  parent. 
Tex. Fam. Code § 263.004.

•	 DFPS  must  notify  the  child’s  attorney  ad  litem,  CASA  volunteer,  caregiver,  and 
education  decision-maker  of  any  notification  from  the  school  regarding  a  significant 
school event such as disciplinary action, referral to special education, or other event. 
Tex. Fam. Code § 264.018(a)(5) (D); Tex. Educ. Code § 25.007(b)(10).

•	 The court is required at each permanency hearing to determine whether an education 
decision- maker for the child has been identified, whether the child’s education needs 
and  goals  have  been  identified  and  addressed,  and  whether  there  have  been  major 
changes in the child’s school performance or any serious disciplinary events. Tex. Fam. 
Code §§ 263.306(a-1)(5)(F); 263.5031(3) (I).

•	 A child’s guardian ad litem and attorney ad litem are required to determine whether 
the child’s educational needs and goals have been identified and addressed before each 
scheduled permanency hearing. Tex. Fam. Code §§ 107.002(i); 107.004(d-2).

173

V. Federal Law•	 If  a  caregiver  desires  to  educate  the  child  in  a  home  setting,  DFPS  may  ask  the 
court  to  make  a  finding  that  home-schooling  is  not  in  the  best  interests  of  a  child  in 
conservatorship  because  it  does  not  meet  the  child’s  academic  and  social  needs  and 
goals. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.0045.

Practice Tip: Consider seeking appointment of a surrogate parent for youth who are 
placed in a Residential Treatment Center who receive special education services.

174

V. Federal LawServicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)

The SCRA provides certain protections for servicemembers involved in a civil action, including 
a child custody proceeding, while the member is in the military or within 90 days after release 
from the military.

PURPOSE 

STATUTE

50 U.S.C. §3901 et seq.

Missing Parent

If  a  parent  has  not  appeared  in  a  child  custody  suit,  whether  or  not  this  is  due  to  military 
service, DFPS must file an Affidavit of Military Service (available in the Practice Guide for CPS 
Attorneys, Section 13, Military). 50 U.S.C. § 3931(b)(1). The best practice is to request a search 
of the military database before the Status Hearing, if any parent has not been located.

The DFPS diligent search unit includes a search of the US Military Database and the certificate 
of military service or non-service in the FINDRS Report provided to a requestor. Alternatively, a 
search can be performed using the U.S. military website. Note that a search requires a parent’s 
date of birth, last name and first name or initial, and ideally, social security number.

A search of the military database will generally result in either a Certificate of Non-Service, or 
a Certificate of Service. The certificate should be attached to an Affidavit of Military Service, 
provided to parties and counsel of record, and filed with the court.

Default Judgment

Service; and

If a parent has not appeared in a child welfare suit, no default judgment can be taken unless:

•	 DFPS  has  filed  an  Affidavit  of  Military  Service  with  a  Certificate  of  Service  or  Non-

•	 An attorney has been appointed for the parent. 50 U.S.C. § 3931(b)(2).

If the court determines there may be a defense which cannot be presented without the parent’s 
presence or the attorney has been unable to contact the parent after exercising due diligence, 
the court shall grant a stay for at least 90 days. 50 U.S.C. § 3931(d).

After Notice

If a parent in the military has notice of a child custody suit, the court on its own motion may 
stay the suit, or on request of the servicemember, shall stay the action for at least 90 days, if 
there is proof that the military duty materially affects the servicemember’s ability to appear 
and a date when the servicemember will be available; or, if the commanding officer confirms 
that  military  duty  prevents  the  servicemember’s  appearance  and  leave  is  not  authorized.  50 
U.S.C. § 3932(b).

Child Custody Protection

If  a  court  renders  a  temporary  custody  order  solely  based  on  the  deployment  or  anticipated 
deployment of a servicemember parent, the court shall limit the order to the time justified by 
the deployment. 50 U.S.C. § 3938(a). Moreover, a parent’s absence as a result of a deployment 
may not be the sole factor in determining the best interest of child for purposes of a request for 
a permanent custody. 50 U.S.C. § 3938(b). Similar protections are provided in state law. Tex. 
Fam. Code § 156.006(c).

A permanent legal arrangement for a child designed to 
promote stability and permanency in a child’s life; refers 
to permanent placements other than a reunification with a 
parent, adoption, or permanent managing conservatorship to 
a relative.

The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (Public Law 
105-89) was enacted by the United States Congress to 
improve the safety of children, promote adoption and other 
permanent homes for children who needed them, and 
support families. According to the Children’s Bureau, ASFA 
also required child protection agencies to provide more 
timely assessment and intervention services to children 
and families involved with child welfare. Additionally, ASFA 
paved the way for the legal sanction of concurrent planning 
(simultaneously identifying and working on a secondary 
goal, such as guardianship, with a relative) by requiring that 
agencies make reasonable efforts to find permanent families 
for children in foster care should reunification fail.

A type of service provided to some families who were 
the subject of an investigation of child abuse and neglect 
allegations without including a substantiation of the 
allegations or an entry of perpetrators into the Central

resolve safety issues and reduce future involvement with 
DFPS. 

The process by which a student’s parents and school staff

location such as a hotel while still being supervised by DFPS 
or an SSCC). 

The state agency charged with protecting children, adults 
who are elderly or have disabilities living at home or in state 
facilities, and licensing group day-care homes, day-care 
centers, and registered family homes. 

The state agency created to provide public safety services by 
enforcing laws, administering regulatory programs, managing 
records, educating the public, and managing emergencies, 
both directly and through interaction with other agencies. 

The Texas Department of State Health Services promotes 
optimal health for individuals and communities while 
providing effective health, mental health, and substance 
abuse services to Texans. 

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
(DSM) is a guidebook widely used by mental health 
professionals in the diagnosis of many mental health 
conditions. The DSM is published by the American Psychiatric 
Association and has been revised multiple times since it was 
first introduced in 1952. The most recent edition is the fifth, 
or the DSM-5. It was published in 2013.

ESSA is a federal education law passed in December 2015. 
ESSA contains several educational stability provisions related 
to the education of children and youth in foster care that 
mirror the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing 
Adoptions Act of 2008. ESSA also requires designated points 
of contact in education and child welfare systems, assurances 
that schools will coordinate with child welfare to develop 
transportation plans for children in foster care, and beginning 
in December 2018, disaggregated data on children and youth 
in foster care is included in the reporting requirements. 

The Family First Prevention Services Act was signed into law 
as part of the Bipartisan Budget Act on February 9, 2018. 
This act reforms the federal child welfare financing streams 
(Title IV-E and Title IV-B of the Social Security Act) to 
provide services to families who are at risk of entering the 
child welfare system. The bill aims to prevent children from 
entering foster care by allowing federal reimbursement for 
mental health services, substance use treatment, and in-
home parenting skill training. It also seeks to improve the 
well-being of children already in foster care by incentivizing 
states to reduce placement of children in congregate care.

A type of service provided to some families who were 
the subject of an investigation of child abuse and neglect

The Indian Child Welfare Act, adopted by Congress in 1978, 
applies to child custody proceedings in state courts involving 
“Indian” children -- children of Native American ancestry. 

DFPS changed the title for I See You staff to Local 
Permanency in 2017. The I See You worker for a child is 
officially called the Local Permanency Specialist (LPS); 
however, references to an I See You caseworker are still 
common. When a child who is in the conservatorship of 
DFPS is placed in an out-of-region placement, the region 
where the child is placed must provide the supervision and a 
portion of the case management services for the child. The 
Local Permanency Specialist provides these services, known 
as courtesy supervision. The CVS caseworker must request 
services and supervision by a LPS within seven days of the 
placement. 

IDDs are differences that are usually present at birth and 
that uniquely affect the trajectory of the individual’s physical, 
intellectual, and/or emotional development. Conditions 
can affect multiple body parts or systems. Intellectual 
disability is characterized by differences with both, 
intellectual functioning or intelligence and adaptive behavior. 
Developmental disability is a broader category of often 
lifelong challenges that can be intellectual, physical, or both.

An IEP is a plan for each child who qualifies for special 
education and related services that is developed, reviewed, 
and revised by the ARD committee, of which parents are 
invited to be active members. It includes the student’s 
present levels of academic achievement and functional 
performance, participation in state and district-wide 
assessments, transition services, annual goals, special 
factors, special education, related services, supplementary 
aids and services, extended school year services, and least 
restrictive educational setting.

According to DFPS, IMPACT is the main application DFPS 
uses to record case information about the children and adults 
the agency protects. DFPS uses IMPACT to document all 
stages of service of a case, including when someone reports 
abuse, neglect, or exploitation and when those cases are 
investigated.

Juvenile Probation Officers provide supervision to youth 
involved with juvenile probation departments and youth 
dually in the custody of the Department of Family and 
Protective Services (DFPS).

The Child Welfare Information Gateway webpage includes 
information about serving lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, 
and questioning (LGBTQ) youth, including resources for 
LGBTQ youth in out-of-home care and resources offering 
support and guidance for LGBTQ youth and their families.

There are five service levels of care for children in the 
conservatorship of DFPS. Those service levels are basic, 
moderate, specialized, intense, and intense plus. 40 TAC 
Section 700.2301-700.2367.

An MOU is an agreement between two parties in the form 
of a legal document. It is not fully binding in the way that 
a contract is, but it expresses an interest in performing a 
service or taking part in an activity.

An MSA is a form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) 
that settles the case via negotiation under the guidance of a 
qualified neutral third party. An MSA is binding on the parties 
if properly executed, and a court may only decline to enter 
the MSA if a specific exception applies. Tex. Fam. Code § 
153.007(c)-(e); Tex. Fam. Code § 153.0071(e-1).

The OAG is a Texas state agency that serves as legal counsel 
to all boards and agencies of state government; issues legal 
opinions when requested by the Texas Governor, heads of 
state agencies, and other officials and agencies as provided 
by Texas statutes; sits as an ex-officio member of state 
committees and commissions; and defends challenges 
to state laws and suits against both state agencies and 
individual employees of the State. 

A program within CPS to provide support and services to help 
youth prepare for independent adult living upon departure 
from DFPS care and support. According to DFPS, PAL policy 
requires that youth 16 and older who are in substitute care 
and likely to remain in care until at least age 18, and who 
can qualify for services up to their 21st birthday, receive 
services to prepare them for adult living. With funding 
availability, regions may serve any youth age 14 or older on 
whom Child Protective Services has an open case.

A Permanency Conference is held when it is not possible 
or appropriate to hold a Family Group Conference. A PC is 
held for a child or youth in DFPS conservatorship for the 
purposes of developing or reviewing the child’s or youth’s 
permanency plan; developing or reviewing the family service 
plan; resolving barriers to achieving a permanent living 
arrangement, as appropriate; and developing and reviewing 
the transition plan for youth age 14 and 15. Family Group 
Decision Making strategies are used to the extent possible 
and if appropriate to the situation.

PJMC

PMC

Permanent 
Joint Managing 
Conservatorship

Permanent 
Managing 
Conservatorship

PJMC is a legal term under Tex. Fam. Code § 101.016 used in 
child custody cases to indicate the long-term sharing of the 
rights and duties of a parent by two parties, ordinarily the 
parents, even if the exclusive right to make certain decisions 
may be awarded to one party.

Placement of a child in the permanent conservatorship 
of an entity or person, by court order, (e.g., Texas DFPS 
or relative) with no intention of returning the child to the 
parent’s custody. PMC is a term used solely in the context 
of child welfare law and is used to designate a managing 
conservator other than a parent. The designation of a non-
parent as sole or joint managing conservator may be used in 
lieu of the term PMC. 

A Parental Child Safety Placement (PCSP) is a family-initiated, 
temporary,  out-of-home  placement  made  by  a  parent  with 
a  caregiver  who  is  either  related  to  the  child  or  has  a  long-
standing  and  significant  relationship  with  the  child  or  family 
that  may  occur  when  the  family  determines  that  a  PCSP  is 
more  workable  than  having  a  supervision  agreement  for 
parent-child contact.

A childcare institution that has a treatment model as defined 
by the Family First Prevention Services Act (FFPSA). Both 
accreditation of the facility and court review of the placement 
are required to qualify for federal IV-E matching payments 
after a child’s placement in a QRTP by the court. 

Refusal to assume parental responsibility is characterized 
as the failure by the person responsible for a child’s care, 
custody, or welfare to permit the child to return to the child’s 
home without arranging for the necessary care for the child 
after the child has been absent from the home for any 
reason. 

This is one of the possible dispositions given in a DFPS 
investigation of child abuse and neglect. For an investigation 
to be designated as Ruled Out, the information gathered 
during the investigation supports a reasonable conclusion 
that: 1) the alleged abuse did not occur; 2) the alleged 
perpetrator is 9 years old or younger; or 3) the alleged 
abuse or neglect did occur but there is sufficient evidence to 
reasonably conclude that the named alleged perpetrator is 
not responsible.

RTB is one of the possible dispositions given in a DFPS 
investigation of child abuse and neglect. For an investigation 
to be designated as Reason to Believe, the information 
gathered during the investigation supports a reasonable 
conclusion that the alleged abuse or neglect did occur and 
that the alleged perpetrator is responsible for it.

According to Texas HHSC, an RTC provides therapeutic, 
residential care for children and adolescents to address needs 
such as mental illness, substance use, or other behavioral 
health problems. Children and adolescents live in an RTC for 
a short period of time as they work to meet their treatment 
goals.

Texas Rules of Civil 
Procedure

TJMC occurs when temporary managing conservatorship 
is granted to DFPS and the parent(s) or other person in a 
SAPCR where the state agency is a party to the lawsuit.

The awarding of conservatorship of a child to Texas DFPS. 
This may include children remaining in their home with 
orders from the court for particular requirements to ensure 
the safety of the child, or the removal of a child from the 
family for safety and well-being purposes.

According to DFPS, a Transition Plan Meeting is held soon 
after a youth who has been removed from the home reaches 
age 14. A TPM tends to be a shorter and more DFPS-driven 
conference with fewer participants than a Circle of Support. 
A TPM is used as an alternative to the Circle of Support when 
youth do not desire one or a Circle of Support cannot be 
convened.

The TRCP govern all civil lawsuits filed in Texas. They are 
designed to “obtain a just, fair, equitable and impartial 
adjudication of the rights of litigants under established 
principles of substantive law” and to provide for efficient 
disposition of cases.
