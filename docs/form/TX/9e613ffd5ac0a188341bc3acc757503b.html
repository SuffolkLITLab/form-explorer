PART I - GENERAL RULES 

RULE 1.    OBJECTIVE OF RULES 
 
The proper objective of rules of civil procedure is to obtain a just, fair, equitable and impartial 
adjudication of the rights of litigants under established principles of substantive law. To the end 
that this objective may be attained with as great expedition and dispatch and at the least expense 
both  to  the  litigants  and  to  the  state  as  may  be  practicable,  these  rules  shall  be  given  a  liberal 
construction. 

RULE 2.    SCOPE OF RULES 
 
These rules shall govern the procedure in the justice, county, and district courts of the State of 
Texas in all actions of a civil nature, with such exceptions as may be hereinafter stated. Where any 
statute in effect immediately prior to September 1, 1941, prescribed a rule of procedure in lunacy, 
guardianship,  or  estates  of  decedents,  or  any  other  probate  proceedings  in  the  county  court 
differing from these Rules, and not included in the "List of Repealed Statutes," such statute shall 
apply; and where any statute in effect immediately prior to September 1, 1941, and not included 
in  the  "List  of  Repealed  Statutes,"  prescribed  a  rule  of  procedure  in  any  special  statutory 
proceeding differing from these rules, such statute shall apply. All statutes in effect immediately 
prior to September 1, 1941, prescribing rules of procedure in bond or recognizance forfeitures in 
criminal cases are hereby continued in effect as rules of procedure governing such cases, but where 
such statutes prescribed no rules of procedure in such cases, these rules shall apply. All statutes in 
effect  immediately  prior  to  September  1,  1941,  prescribing  rules  of  procedure  in  tax  suits  are 
hereby  continued  in effect as rules of procedure governing such  cases, but where such  statutes 
prescribed no rules of procedure in such cases, these rules shall apply; provided, however, that 
Rule 117a shall control with respect to citation in tax suits. 
 

RULE 3.    CONSTRUCTION OF RULES 
 
Unless otherwise expressly provided, the past, present or future tense shall each include the other; 
the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender shall each include the other; and the singular and plural 
number shall each include the other. 
 

RULE 3a. LOCAL RULES, FORMS, AND STANDING ORDERS 

(a) 

General Rule. An administrative judicial region or a court governed by these rules may 
promulgate local rules, forms, and standing orders that govern local practice. 

 

Page  1 

(b) 

Relationship with Other Authorities. Local rules, forms, and standing orders must not be 
inconsistent with state or federal law or rules adopted by the Supreme Court of Texas. This 
requirement extends to any time period provided by these rules. If adopted by a court, local 
rules,  forms,  and  standing  orders  must  not  be  inconsistent  with  any  rule  of  the 
administrative judicial region in which the court is located. 

(c) 

Publication  Required.  To  be  effective,  local  rules,  forms,  and  standing  orders  must  be 
published on the Office of Court Administration’s website. 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1990 change: To make Texas Rules of Civil Procedure timetables mandatory 
and  to  preclude  use  of  unpublished  local  rules  or  other  “standing”  orders  to  local  practices  to 
determine issues of substantive merit.   

Comment to 2023 change: Rule 3a is amended to remove the requirement that the Supreme 
Court of Texas approve local rules and to expressly address local forms and standing orders. The 
amended rule provides that local rules, forms, and standing orders must not conflict with other 
laws  or  rules  and  that  they  are  not  effective  unless  published  on  the  Office  of  Court 
Administration’s website. Section 74.093(b) of the Texas Government Code imposes additional 
requirements for local rules. 

RULE 4.    COMPUTATION OF TIME 

n computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these rules, by order of court, or by any 
applicable statute, the day of the act, event, or default after which the designated period of time 
begins to run is not to be included. The last day of the period so computed is to be included, unless 
it is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next 
day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall 
not be counted for any purpose in any time period of five days or less in these rules, except that 
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be counted for purpose of the three-day periods in 
Rules 21 and 21a, extending other periods by three days when service is made by mail. 
 

Comment  to  1990  change:  Amended  to  omit  counting  Saturdays,  Sundays  and  legal 

holidays in all periods of less than five days with certain exceptions. 

Notes and Comments 
 

RULE 5.    ENLARGEMENT OF TIME 

hen by these rules or by a notice given  thereunder  or by order of court an act is  required or 
allowed to be done at or within a specified time, the court for cause shown may, at any time in its 
discretion (a) with or without motion or notice, order the period enlarged if application therefor is 
Page  2 

 

 

  I

  W

 

made before the expiration of the period originally prescribed or as extended by a previous order; 
or (b) upon motion permit the act to be done after the expiration of the specified period where good 
cause is shown for the failure to act. The court may not enlarge the period for taking any action 
under the rules relating to new trials except as stated in these rules. If any document is sent to the 
proper clerk by first-class United States mail in an envelope or wrapper properly addressed and 
stamped and is deposited in the mail on or before the last day for filing same, the same, if received 
by the clerk not more than ten days tardily, shall be filed by the clerk and be deemed filed in time. 
A legible postmark affixed by the United States Postal Service shall be prima facie evidence of the 
date of mailing. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1990 change: To make the last date for mailing under Rule 5 coincide with 

the last date for filing. 
 

RULE 6.    SUITS COMMENCED ON SUNDAY 

o  civil  suit  shall  be  commenced  nor  process  issued  or  served  on  Sunday,  except  in  cases  of 
injunction, attachment, garnishment, sequestration, or distress proceedings; provided that citation 
by publication published on Sunday shall be valid. 
 

RULE 7.    MAY APPEAR BY ATTORNEY 
 
Any party to a suit may appear and prosecute or defend his rights therein, either in person or by an 
attorney of the court. 

RULE 8.    ATTORNEY IN CHARGE 
 
On the occasion of a party's first appearance through counsel, the attorney whose signature first 
appears on the initial pleadings for any party shall be the attorney in charge, unless another attorney 
is specifically designated therein. Thereafter, until such designation is changed by written notice 
to the  court and all  other parties  in accordance  with  Rule 21a, said attorney in charge  shall be 
responsible for the suit as to such party. All communications from the court or other counsel with 
respect to a suit shall be sent to the attorney in charge. 

[RULE 8a.    Suspended effective December 30, 2003] 
 

RULE 9.    NUMBER OF COUNSEL HEARD 
 
Not more than two counsel on each side shall be heard on any question or on the trial, except in 
important cases, and upon special leave of the court.

RULE 10.    WITHDRAWAL OF ATTORNEY 
 
An attorney may withdraw from representing a party only upon written motion for good cause 
shown. If another attorney is to be substituted as attorney for the party, the motion shall state: the 
name, address, telephone number, telecopier number, if any, and State Bar of Texas identification 
number of the substitute attorney; that the party approves the substitution; and that the withdrawal 
is not sought for delay only. If another attorney is not to be substituted as attorney for the party, 
the motion shall state: that a copy of the motion has been delivered to the party; that the party has 
been  notified  in  writing  of  his  right  to  object  to  the  motion;  whether  the  party  consents  to  the 
motion;  the  party's  last known  address  and  all  pending  settings  and  deadlines.  If  the  motion  is 
granted, the withdrawing attorney shall immediately notify the party in writing of any additional 
settings or deadlines of which the attorney has knowledge at the time of the withdrawal and has 
not already notified the party. The Court may impose further conditions upon granting leave to 
withdraw. Notice or delivery to a party shall be either made to the party in person or mailed to the 
party's last known address by both certified and regular first class mail. If the attorney in charge 
withdraws and another attorney remains or becomes substituted, another attorney in charge must 
be designated of record with notice to all other parties in accordance with Rule 21a. 
 

Notes and Comments 
 

Comment to 1988 change: The amendment repeals the present rule and makes provision 
for  withdrawal  of  counsel,  setting  forth  the  requirements  for  withdrawal  and  withdrawal  with 
substitution of counsel. The amendment also carries forward the requirements of amended Rule 8 
regarding designation of attorney in charge. 
 

Comment  to  1990  change:  The  amendment  repeals  the  present  rule  and  clarifies  the 

requirements for withdrawal. 

RULE 11.    AGREEMENTS TO BE IN WRITING 
 
Unless otherwise provided in these rules, no agreement between attorneys or parties touching any 
suit pending will be enforced unless it be in writing, signed and filed with the papers as part of the 
record, or unless it be made in open court and entered of record. 
 

Comment  to  1988  change:  The  amendment  makes  it  clear  that  Rule  11  is  subject  to 

modification by any other Rule of Civil Procedure. 

Notes and Comments 
 

 

 

RULE 12.    ATTORNEY TO SHOW AUTHORITY 

Page  4 

A party in a suit or proceeding pending in a court of this state may, by sworn written motion stating 
that he believes the suit or proceeding is being prosecuted or defended without authority, cause the 
attorney to be cited to appear before the court and show his authority to act. The notice of the 
motion shall be served upon the challenged attorney at least ten days before the hearing on the 
motion. At the hearing on the motion, the burden of proof shall be upon the challenged attorney to 
show sufficient authority to prosecute or defend the suit on behalf of the other party. Upon his 
failure to show such authority, the court shall refuse to permit the attorney to appear in the cause, 
and shall strike the pleadings if no person who is authorized to prosecute or defend appears. The 
motion may be heard and determined at any time before the parties have announced ready for trial, 
but the trial shall not be unnecessarily continued or delayed for the hearing. 
 

RULE 13.    EFFECT OF SIGNING PLEADINGS, MOTIONS AND OTHER PAPERS; 
SANCTIONS 

he  signatures  of  attorneys  or  parties  constitute  a  certificate  by  them  that  they  have  read  the 
pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of their knowledge, information, and belief formed 
after reasonable inquiry the instrument is not groundless and brought in bad faith or groundless 
and brought for the purpose of harassment. Attorneys or parties who shall bring a fictitious suit as 
an experiment to get an opinion of the court, or who shall file any fictitious pleading in a cause for 
such a purpose, or shall make statements in pleading which they know to be groundless and false, 
for the purpose of securing a delay of the trial of the cause, shall be held guilty of a contempt. If a 
pleading, motion or other paper is signed in violation of this rule, the court, upon motion or upon 
its own initiative, after notice and hearing, shall impose an appropriate sanction available under 
Rule 215-2b, upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both. Courts shall presume 
that pleadings, motions, and other papers are filed in good faith. No sanctions under this rule may 
be imposed except for good cause, the particulars of which must be stated in the sanction order. 
"Groundless" for purposes of this rule means no basis in law or fact and not warranted by good 
faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law. A general denial does 
not constitute a violation of this rule. The  amount  requested  for  damages does not constitute a 
violation of this rule. 
 

Notes and Comments 
 

Comment  to  1990  change:  To  require  notice  and  hearing  before  a  court  determines  to 
impose sanctions, to specify that any sanction imposed be appropriate, and to eliminate the 90-day 
"grace" period provided in the former version of the rule. 
 

RULE 14.    AFFIDAVIT BY AGENT 
 
Whenever it may be necessary or proper for any party to a civil suit or proceeding to make an 
affidavit, it may be made by either the party or his agent or his attorney.

In compliance with the provisions of Rule 14b, the Supreme Court hereby 
directs that exhibits offered or admitted into evidence shall be retained and disposed 
of by the clerk of the court in which the exhibits are filed upon the following basis. 
This order shall apply only to: (1) those cases in which judgment has been rendered 
on service of process by publication and in which no motion for new trial was filed 
within  two  years  after  judgment  was  signed;  and,  (2)  all  other  cases  in  which 
judgment has been signed for one year and in which no appeal was perfected or in 
which a perfected appeal was dismissed or concluded by a final judgement as to all 
parties and the issuance of the appellate court's mandate such that the case is no 
longer pending on appeal or in the trial court. The party who offered an exhibit may 
withdraw  it  from  the  clerk’s  office  within  thirty  days  of  the  later  of  (1)  a  case 
becoming subject to this order, or (2) the effective date of this order. The clerk, 
unless otherwise directed by the court, may dispose of any exhibits remaining after 
such time period. 

RULE 14c.    DEPOSIT IN LIEU OF SURETY BOND 
 
Wherever these rules provide for the filing of a surety bond, the party may in lieu of filing the bond 
deposit cash or other negotiable obligation of the government of the United States of America or 
any agency thereof, or with leave of court, deposit a negotiable obligation of any bank or savings 
and loan association chartered by the government of the United States of America or any state 
thereof that is insured by the government of the United States of America or any agency thereof, 
in the amount fixed for the surety bond, conditioned in the same manner as would be a surety bond 
for the protection of other parties. Any interest thereon shall constitute a part of the deposit. 
 

PART II - RULES OF PRACTICE IN DISTRICT AND COUNTY COURTS 
 
Section 1.    General Rules 

RULE 15.    WRITS AND PROCESS

constable within the State of Texas, shall be made returnable on the Monday next after expiration 
of twenty days from the date of service thereof, and shall be dated and attested by the clerk with

RULE 16.    SHALL ENDORSE ALL PROCESS 
 
Every officer or authorized person shall endorse on all process and precepts coming to his hand 
the day and hour on which he received them, the manner in which he executed them, and the time 
and place the process was served and shall sign the returns officially. 
 

Notes and Comments 

omment  to  1988  change:  Article  3926a,  effective  September  1,  1981,  authorizes  the 
commissioner’s court of each county to set a “reasonable” fee for service of process; mileage is no 
longer an authorized expense for serving process. 
 

  C

RULE 17.    OFFICER TO EXECUTE PROCESS 
 
Except where otherwise expressly provided by law or these rules, the officer receiving any process 
to be executed shall not be entitled in any case to demand his fee for executing the same in advance 
of such execution, but his fee shall be taxed and collected as other costs in the case. 
 

RULE 18.    WHEN JUDGE DIES DURING TERMS, RESIGNS OR IS DISABLED 
 
If  the  judge  dies,  resigns,  or  becomes  unable  to  hold  court  during  the  session  of  court  duly 
convened for the term, and the time provided by law for the holding of said court has not expired, 
such death, resignation, or inability on the part of the judge shall not operate to adjourn said court 
for the term, but such court shall be deemed to continue in session. If a successor to such judge 
shall qualify and assume office during the term, or if a judge be transferred to said district from 
some  other  judicial  district,  he  may  continue  to  hold  said  court  for  the  term  provided,  and  all 
motions undisposed of shall be heard and determined by him, and statements of facts and bills of 
exception shall be approved by him. If the time for holding such court expires before a successor 
shall qualify, and before a judge can be transferred to said district from some other judicial district, 
then all motions pending, including those for new trial, shall stand as continued in force until such 
successor has qualified and assumed office, or a judge has been transferred to said district who can 
hold said court, and thereupon such judge shall have power to act thereon at the succeeding term, 
or on an earlier day in vacation, on notice to all parties to the motion, and such orders shall have 
the same effect as if rendered in term time. The time for allowing statement of facts and bills of 
exception from such orders shall date from the time the motion was decided. 
 

the seal of the court impressed thereon; and the date of issuance shall be noted thereon.

  (

 

 

 

should not file a response to the motion.

(2) 

clearly brought for unnecessary delay and without sufficient cause. 

i) 

Chief Justice.    The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Texas may assign judges and

Order  on  Motion  to  Disqualify.    An  order  granting  or  denying  a  motion  to 
disqualify may be reviewed by mandamus and may be appealed in accordance with

Notes and Comments 

omment to 2011 change: Rule 18a governs the procedure for recusing or disqualifying a 
judge sitting in any trial court other than a statutory probate court, justice court, or municipal court. 
Chapter 25 of the Government Code governs statutory probate courts, Rule 528 governs justice 
courts,  and  Chapter  29  of  the  Government  Code  governs  municipal  courts.  Under  Rule  18a,  a 
judge’s rulings may not be the sole basis for a motion to rescue or disqualify the judge. But when 
one of more sufficient other bases are raised, the judge hearing the motion may consider evidence 
of  rulings  when  considering  whether  to  grant  the  motion.  For  purposes  of  this  rule,  the  term 
“rulings” is not meant to encompass a judge’s statements or remarks about a case.   

he amendments to Rule 18b are not intended to be substantive.

RULE 18b.    GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL AND DISQUALIFICATION OF JUDGES

(1) 

the  judge  has  served  as  a  lawyer  in  the  matter  in  controversy,  or  a  lawyer  with 
whom  the  judge  previously  practiced  law  served  during  such  association  as  a 
lawyer concerning the matter;

or  minor  child  residing  in  the  judge’s  household,  has  a  financial  interest  in  the 
subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding, or any other interest 
that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding;

“fiduciary”  includes  such  relationships  as  executor,  administrator,  trustee,  and 
guardian; 

“financial interest” means ownership of a legal or equitable interest, however small, 
or a relationship as director, adviser, or other active participant in the affairs of a 
party, except that: 

(A) 

(B) 

(C) 

(D)

organization; 

the proprietary interest of a policyholder in a mutual insurance company, of

proceeding could substantially affect the value of the interest; 

ownership  of  government  securities  is  a  “financial  interest”  in  the  issuer 
only if the outcome of the proceeding could substantially affect the value of 
the securities; 

an interest as a taxpayer or utility ratepayer, or any similar interest, is not a 
“financial interest” unless the outcome of the proceeding could substantially 
affect the liability of the judge or a person related to him within the third 
degree more than other judges. 

e)  Waiving a Ground for Recusal.    The parties to a proceeding may waive any ground for 

recusal after it is fully disclosed on the record. 

f) 

Discovery and Divestiture.    If a judge does not discover that the judge is recused under 
subparagraphs (b)(6) or (b)(7)(B) until after the judge has devoted substantial time to the 
matter,  the  judge  is  not  required  to  recuse  himself  or  herself  if  the  judge  or  the  person 
related to the judge divests himself or herself of the interest that would otherwise require 
recusal.

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 2011 Change: Rule 18a governs the procedure for recusing or disqualifying a 
judge sitting in any trial court other than a statutory probate court, justice court, or municipal court.   
Chapter 25 of the Government Code governs statutory probate courts, Rule 528 governs justice 
courts,  and  Chapter  29  of  the  Government  Code  governs  municipal  courts.  Under  Rule  18a,  a 
judge’s rulings may not be the sole basis for a motion to recuse or disqualify the judge.    But when 
one or more sufficient other bases are raised, the judge hearing the motion may consider evidence 
of  rulings  when  considering  whether  to  grant  the  motion.    For  purposes  of  this  rule,  the  term 
“rulings” is not meant to encompass a judge’s statements or remarks about a case. 
 

The amendments to Rule 18b are not intended to be substantive. 

omment  to  1990  change:  The  grounds  for  a  judge’s  mandatory  recusal  have  been 

expanded from those in prior Rule 18b(2). 

RULE 18c.    RECORDING AND BROADCASTING OF COURT PROCEEDINGS 
 
A trial court may permit broadcasting, televising, recording, or photographing of proceedings in 
the courtroom only in the following circumstances:   

in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the Supreme Court for civil cases, or 

when  broadcasting,  televising,  recording,  or  photographing  will  not  unduly  distract 
participants or impair the dignity of the proceedings and the parties have consented, and 
consent to being depicted or recorded is obtained from each witness whose testimony will 
be broadcast, televised, or photographed, or 

c) 

the  broadcasting,  televising,  recording,  or  photographing  of  investiture,  or  ceremonial 
proceedings. 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1990 change: New rule. To provide for guidelines for broadcasting, televising, 

recording, and photographing court proceedings.   
 

RULE 19.    NON-ADJOURNMENT OF TERM 
 
Every term of court shall commence and convene by operation of law at the time fixed by statute 
without any act, order, or formal opening by a judge or other official thereof, and shall continue to 
be open at all times until and including the last day of the term unless sooner adjourned by the 
judge thereof.

the court proceeding, unless otherwise provided by these rules or shortened by the court. 
Notice of any court proceeding must contain the information needed for participants, as 
defined  in  Rule  21d(a),  to  participate  in  the  proceeding,  including  the  location  of  the 
proceeding or instructions for joining the proceeding electronically, the court’s designated 
contact  information,  and  instructions  for submitting  evidence.  A  court  must  publish  the 
information needed for participants to participate in its proceedings. 

c)  Multiple Parties.    If there is more than one other party represented by different attorneys, 

one copy of each pleading must be served on each attorney in charge.

Timely  Filing.    Unless  a  document  must  be  filed  by  a  certain  time  of  day,  a 
document is considered timely filed if it is electronically filed at any time before 
midnight (in the court's time zone) on the filing deadline.    An electronically filed 
document  is  deemed  filed  when  transmitted  to  the  filing  party's  electronic  filing 
service provider, except: 

if a document is transmitted on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, it is 
deemed filed on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday; 
and 

if  a  document  requires  a  motion  and  an  order  allowing  its  filing,  the 
document is deemed filed on the date that the motion is granted. 

Technical Failure.    If a document is untimely due to a technical failure or a system 
outage, the filing party may seek appropriate relief from the court.    If the missed 
deadline is one imposed by these rules, the filing party must be given a reasonable 
extension of time to complete the filing.

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 2013 Change: Rule 21 is revised to incorporate rules for electronic filing, in 
accordance with the Supreme Court's order - Misc. Docket No. 12-9206, amended by Misc. Docket 
Nos. 13-9092 and 13-9164 - mandating electronic filing in civil cases beginning on January 1, 
2014.  The  mandate  will  be  implemented  according  to  the  schedule  in  the  order  and  will  be 
completed by July 1, 2016. The revisions reflect the fact that the mandate will only apply to a 
subset of Texas courts until that date. 

omment to 1990 change: To require filing and service of all pleadings and motions on all 

parties and to consolidate notice and service Rules 21, 72 and 73.      
 

Comment to 2023 change: Rule 21(b) is amended to clarify requirements for notices.

with the electronic filing manager, the document may be served on that party or 
attorney under subparagraph (2).

[RULE 21c.    Repealed effective September 1, 1986]

“Participant”  means  any  party,  attorney,  witness,  court  reporter,  or  juror  who 
participates in a court proceeding.

1)    Unless the notice of court proceeding states otherwise, a person who participates in 
a court proceeding does so by physical presence in the courtroom. Upon appropriate 
notice by a party or the court, a court may allow or require a participant to appear 
at  a  court  proceeding  by  videoconference,  teleconference,  or  other  available 
electronic means, except as otherwise provided in (2). 

A) 

a party or lawyer to appear electronically for a court proceeding in which 
oral testimony is heard, absent good cause or the agreement of the parties; 
or 

B) 

a lawyer, party, or juror to appear electronically for a jury trial, absent the 
agreement of the parties. 

Judge  Method  of  Appearance;  Location.  A  judge  may  appear  at  a  court  proceeding  by 
videoconference,  teleconference,  or  other  available  electronic  means.  However,  even  if 
appearing  electronically,  a  judge  must  conduct  the  court  proceeding  from  a  location 
required by law. 

Objection. A party may object to any method of appearance, stating good cause for the 
objection. The objection must be made within a reasonable time after the party receives 
notice of the appearance. The court may, but is not required to, conduct a hearing on the 
objection. Before proceeding by the objected-to method of appearance, the court must rule 
on the objection and timely communicate the ruling to the parties in a written order or on 
the record.   

Factors. In determining good cause under this rule, the court should consider factors such 
as: 

  (

  (

 

(2)    A court must not require: 

Participant Method of Appearance.   

  (

b) 

  (

(1)   

case type;   

2)   

court proceeding type; 

3) 

the number of parties and witnesses;   

4)   

the complexity of the legal and factual issues;   

   

5)   

the type of evidence to be submitted, if any;   

6)   

technological  restrictions  such  as  lack  of  access  to  or  proficiency  in  necessary 
technology;

  (

  (

  (

  (

7)   

travel restrictions such as lack of transportation, distance, or inability to take off 
work;   

8)    whether a method of appearance is best suited to provide necessary language access 
services  for  a  person  with  limited  English  proficiency  or  accommodations  for  a 
person with a disability; and   

9)   

any previous abuse of a method of appearance. 

   
(f) 

Open  Courts.  If  a  court  conducts  a  court  proceeding  in  which  all  participants  appear 
electronically, the court must: 

provide reasonable notice to the public of how to observe the court proceeding; and 
 
provide the public the opportunity to observe the court proceeding, unless the court 
has  determined  that  it  must  close  the  court  proceeding  to  protect  an  overriding 
interest, considered all less-restrictive alternatives to closure, and made findings on 
the record adequate to support closure. 
 

Notes and Comments 

omment  to  2023  change:  New  Rule  21d  clarifies  procedures  for  appearances  at  court 
proceedings. Paragraph (a) defines “court proceeding” and “participant.” Paragraph (b) governs a 
participant’s method of appearance. Certain statutes expressly prohibit electronic appearances, in 
which case the governing statute  applies. Paragraph (c) provides  that  the judge may  appear by 
electronic means, but it requires the judge to appear electronically from a location required by law. 
See,  e.g.,  TEX.  CONST.  art.  V,  §  7(d);  TEX.  GOV’T  CODE  §§  24.030(a),  26.002(c).  Nothing  in 
paragraph (c) permits the judge to conduct a proceeding away from a location required by law. 
Paragraph  (d)  addresses  objections  to  any  method  of  appearance,  and  paragraph  (e)  addresses 
good-cause factors. Paragraph (f) recognizes the public’s right to reasonable notice of and access 
to a fully electronic proceeding unless there is an overriding interest. A court should rarely close a 
court proceeding from public observation, and in such an exceptional case, the court must use the 
least restrictive measure to protect the overriding interest. 
 

 
SECTION 2.      INSTITUTION OF SUIT 

RULE 22.    COMMENCED BY PETITION

the case and the names of the parties, the names of the attorneys, the nature of the action, the pleas, 
the motions, and the ruling of the court as made. 
 

The cases shall be placed on the docket as they are filed. 

RULE 27.    ORDER OF CASES 
 

SECTION 3.      PARTIES TO SUITS 

RULE 28.    SUITS IN ASSUMED NAME 
 
Any  partnership,  unincorporated  association,  private  corporation,  or  individual  doing  business 
under an assumed name may sue or be sued in its partnership, assumed or common name for the 
purpose of enforcing for or against it a substantive right, but on a motion by any party or on the 
court's own motion the true name may be substituted. 
 

RULE 29.    SUIT ON CLAIM AGAINST DISSOLVED CORPORATION 
 
When no receiver has been appointed for a corporation which has dissolved, suit may be instituted 
on any claim against said corporation as though the same had not been dissolved, and service of 

Page  23 

   

 

process may be obtained on the president, directors, general manager, trustee, assignee, or other 
person in charge of the affairs of the corporation at the time it was dissolved, and judgment may 
be rendered as though the corporation had not been dissolved. 
 

RULE 30.    PARTIES TO SUITS 
 
Assignors,  endorsers  and  other  parties  not  primarily  liable  upon  any  instruments  named  in  the 
chapter of the Business and Commerce Code, dealing with commercial paper, may be jointly sued 
with their principal obligors, or may be sued alone in the cases provided for by statute. 
 

RULE 31.    SURETY NOT TO BE SUED ALONE 
 
No surety shall be sued unless his principal is joined with him, or unless a judgment has previously 
been rendered against his principal, except in cases otherwise provided for in the law and these 
rules. 
 

RULE 32.    MAY HAVE QUESTION OF SURETYSHIP TRIED 
 
When any suit is brought against two or more defendants upon any contract, any one or more of 
the defendants being surety for the other, the surety may cause the question of suretyship to be 
tried and determined upon the issue made for the parties defendant at the trial of the cause, or at 
any time before or after the trial or at a subsequent term. Such proceedings shall not delay the suit 
of the plaintiff. 
 

RULE 33.    SUITS BY OR AGAINST COUNTIES 
 
Suits by or against a county or incorporated city, town or village shall be in its corporate name. 
 

RULE 34.    AGAINST SHERIFF, ETC. 
 
Whenever a sheriff, constable, or a deputy or either has been sued for damages for any act done in 
his official character, and has taken an indemnifying bond for the acts upon which the suit is based, 
he may make the principal and surety on such bond parties defendant in such suit, and the cause 
may be continued to obtain service on such parties. 
 

RULE 35.    ON OFFICIAL BONDS 
 
In suits brought by the State or any county, city, independent school district, irrigation district, or 
other political subdivision of the State, against any officer who has held an office for more than 
one term, or against any depository which has been such depository for more than one term, or has 

 

Page  24 

given  more  than  one  official  bond,  the  sureties  on  each  and  all  such  bonds  may  be  joined  as 
defendants in the same suit whenever it is difficult to determine when the default sued for occurred 
and which set of sureties on such bonds is liable therefor. 
 

RULE 36.    DIFFERENT OFFICIALS AND BONDSMEN 
 
In suits by the State upon the official bond of a State officer, any subordinate officer who has given 
bond, payable either to the State or such superior officer, to cover all or part of the default sued 
for, together with the sureties on his official bond, may be joined as defendants with such superior 
officer and his bondsmen whenever it is alleged in the petition that both of such officers are liable 
for the money sued for. 
 

RULE 37.    ADDITIONAL PARTIES 
 
Before a case is called for trial, additional parties necessary or proper parties to the suit, may be 
brought in, either by the plaintiff or the defendant, upon such terms as the court may prescribe; but 
not at a time nor in a manner to unreasonably delay the trial of the case. 
 

RULE 38.    THIRD-PARTY PRACTICE 
 
(a)  When Defendant May Bring in Third Party.    At any time after commencement of the 
action a defending party, as a third-party plaintiff, may cause a citation and petition to be 
served upon a person not a party to the action who is or may be liable to him or to the 
plaintiff for all or part of the plaintiff's claim against him. The third-party plaintiff need not 
obtain leave to make the service if he files the third-party petition not later than thirty (30) 
days after he serves his original answer. Otherwise, he must obtain leave on motion upon 
notice  to  all  parties  to  the  action.  The  person  served,  hereinafter  called  the  third-party 
defendant,  shall  make  his  defenses  to  the  third-party  plaintiff's  claim  under  the  rules 
applicable  to  the  defendant,  and  his  counterclaims  against  the  third-party  plaintiff  and 
cross-claims against other third-party defendants as provided in Rule 97. The third-party 
defendant may assert against the plaintiff any defenses which the third-party plaintiff has 
to  the  plaintiff's  claim.  The  third-party  defendant  may  also  assert  any  claim  against  the 
plaintiff  arising  out  of  the  transaction  or  occurrence  that  is  the  subject  matter  of  the 
plaintiff's claim against the third-party plaintiff. The plaintiff may assert any claim against 
the  third-party  defendant  arising  out  of  the  transaction  or  occurrence  that  is  the  subject 
matter of the plaintiff's claim against the third-party plaintiff, and the third-party defendant 
thereupon shall assert his defenses and his counterclaims and cross-claims. Any party may 
move  to  strike  the third-party  claim,  or  for  its  severance  or separate  trial.  A  third-party 
defendant may proceed under this rule against any person not a party to the action who is 
or who may be liable to him or to the third-party plaintiff for all or part of the claim made 
in the action against the third-party defendant. 

b)  When Plaintiff May Bring in Third Party.    When a counterclaim is asserted against a 
Page  25 

  (

 

plaintiff, he may cause a third party to be brought in under circumstances which under this 
rule would entitle a defendant to do so. 

This  rule  shall  not  be  applied,  in  tort  cases,  so  as  to  permit  the  joinder  of  a  liability  or 
indemnity insurance company, unless such company is by statute or contract liable to the 
person injured or damaged. 

This rule shall not be applied so as to violate any venue statute, as venue would exist absent 
this rule. 

c) 

d) 

RULE 39.    JOINDER OF PERSONS NEEDED FOR JUST ADJUDICATION 
 

(a)   

Persons to Be Joined If Feasible.    A person who is subject to service of process shall be 
joined as a party in the action if   

(1) 

in his absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or   

(2) 

he claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the 
disposition of the action in his absence may 

(i) 

as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest or   

(ii) 

leave  any  of  the  persons  already  parties  subject  to  a  substantial  risk  of 
incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason 
of his claimed interest. If he has not been so joined, the court shall order 
that he be made a party. If he should join as a plaintiff but refuses to do so, 
he may be made a defendant, or, in a proper case, an involuntary plaintiff. 

b)    Determination by Court Whenever Joinder Not Feasible.    If a person as described in 
subdivision (a)(1)-(2) hereof cannot be made a party, the court shall determine whether in 
equity and good conscience the action should proceed among the parties before it, or should 
be dismissed, the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable. The factors to be 
considered by the court include: first, to what extent a judgment rendered in the person's 
absence might be prejudicial to him or those already parties; second, the extent to which, 
by protective provisions in the judgment, by the shaping of relief, or other measures, the 
prejudice can be lessened or avoided; third, whether a judgment rendered in the person's 
absence will be adequate; fourth, whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the 
action is dismissed for non-joinder. 

c) 

Pleading Reasons for Nonjoinder.    A pleading asserting a claim for relief shall state the 
names, if known to the pleader, of any persons as described in subdivision (a)(1)-(2) hereof 
who are not joined, and the reasons why they are not joined. 

d) 

Exception of Class Actions.    This rule is subject to the provisions of Rule 42.

(a)   

RULE 40.    PERMISSIVE JOINDER OF PARTIES 
 

Permissive Joinder.    All persons may join in one action as plaintiffs if they assert any 
right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative in respect of or arising out of the same 
transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law 
or fact common to all of them will arise in the action. All persons may be joined in one 
action as defendants if there is asserted against them jointly, severally, or in the alternative 
any right to relief in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series 
of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all of them 
will  arise  in  the  action.  A  plaintiff  or  defendant  need  not  be  interested  in  obtaining  or 
defending against all the relief demanded. Judgment may be given for one or more of the 
plaintiffs according to their respective rights to relief, and against one or more defendants 
according to their respective liabilities. 

b)   

Separate  Trials.    The  court  may  make  such  orders  as  will  prevent  a  party  from  being 
embarrassed, delayed, or put to expense by the inclusion of a party against whom he asserts 
no claim and who asserts no claim against him, and may order separate trials or make other 
orders to prevent delay or prejudice. 

RULE 41.    MISJOINDER OR NON-JOINDER OF PARTIES 
 
Misjoinder of parties is not ground for dismissal of an action. Parties may be dropped or added, or 
suits filed separately may be consolidated, or actions which have been improperly joined may be 
severed and each ground of recovery improperly joined may be docketed as a separate suit between 
the same parties, by order of the court on motion of any party or on its own initiative at any stage 
of the action, before the time of submission to the jury or to the court if trial is without a jury, on 
such terms as are just. Any claim against a party may be severed and proceeded with separately. 
 

RULE 42.    CLASS ACTIONS 
 

(a) 

Prerequisites to a Class Action.    One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as 
representative parties on behalf of all only if   

(1) 

the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,   

(2) 

there are questions of law or fact common to the class,   

(3) 

the  claims  or  defenses  of  the  representative  parties  are  typical  of  the  claims  or 
defenses of the class, and   

(4) 

the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. 

Page  27

(b) 

Class  Actions  Maintainable.    An  action  may  be  maintained  as  a  class  action  if  the 
prerequisites of subdivision (a) are satisfied, and in addition: 

the prosecution of separate actions by or against individual members of the class 
would create a risk of 

(A) 

(B) 

(A) 

(B) 

(C) 

inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of 
the class which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the 
party opposing the class, or 

adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would 
as a practical matter be dispositive of the interests of the other members not 
parties to the adjudications or substantially impair or impede their ability to 
protect their interests; or 

the  party  opposing  the  class  has  acted  or  refused  to  act  on  grounds  generally 
applicable  to  the  class,  thereby  making  appropriate  final  injunctive  relief  or 
corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole; or 

the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over 
any questions affecting only individual members, and a class action is superior to 
other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. 
The matters pertinent to these issues include: 

the  interest  of  members  of  the  class  in  individually  controlling  the 
prosecution or defense of separate actions; 

the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already 
commenced by or against members of the class; 

the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims 
in the particular forum; 

(D) 

the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action 

c) 

Determination by Order Whether to Certify a Class Action; Notice and Membership 
in Class. 

(1) 

(A)  When a person sues or is sued as a representative of a class, the court must 
-- at an early practicable time -- determine by order whether to certify the 
 
action as a class action.   
 

(B)  An order certifying a class action must define the class and the class claims, 
issues, or defenses, and must appoint class counsel under Rule 42 (g).

(i) 

the elements of each claim or defense asserted in the pleadings; 

(ii) 

any issues of law or fact common to the class members; 

iii) 

any issues of law or fact affecting only individual class members; 

the issues that will be the object of most of the efforts of the litigants 
and the court; 

other  available  methods  of  adjudication  that  exist  for  the 
controversy; 

(vi)  why the issues common to the members of the class do or do not 

predominate over individual issues; 

(vii)  why a class action is or is not superior to other available methods 
for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy; and 

(viii) 

if a class is certified, how the class claims and any issues affecting 
only individual members, raised by the claims or defenses asserted 
in  the  pleadings,  will  be  tried  in  a  manageable,  time  efficient 
manner. 

(iv) 

(v) 

  (

(C)  An  order  under  Rule  42  (c)(1)  may  be  altered  or  amended  before  final 
judgment. The court may order the naming of additional parties in order to 
insure the adequacy of representation. 

(D)  An order granting or denying certification under Rule 42(b)(3) must state: 

(2) 

(A) 
 
 
 
 
 

For  any  class  certified  under  Rule  42(b)(1)  or  (2),  the  court  may  direct 
appropriate notice to the class.    For any class certified under Rule 42(b)(3), 
the court must direct to class members the best notice practicable under the 
circumstances  including  individual  notice  to  all  members  who  can  be 
identified through reasonable effort. The notice must concisely and clearly 
state in plain, easily understood language: 

(i) 

the nature of the action; 

(ii) 

the definition of the class certified; 

(iii) 

the class claims, issues, or defenses; 

(iv) 

that a class member may enter an appearance through counsel if the 
member so desires; 

Page  29 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the court will exclude from the class any member who requests 
exclusion, stating when and how members may elect to be excluded; 
and 

the binding effect of a class judgment on class members under Rule 
42 (c)(3). 

(v) 

vi) 

  (

The judgment in an action maintained as a class action under subdivisions (b)(1) or 
(b)(2), whether or not favorable to the class, shall include and describe those whom 
the court finds to be members of the class. The judgment in an action maintained 
as a class action under subdivision (b)(3),  whether or not favorable to the class, 
shall  include  and  specify  or  describe  those  to  whom  the  notice  provided  in 
subdivision (c)(2) was directed, and who have not requested exclusion, and whom 
the court finds to be members of the class. 

d) 

Actions  Conducted  Partially  as  Class  Actions;  Multiple  Classes  and  Subclasses.   
When appropriate   

an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular 
issues, or   

a class may be divided into subclasses and each subclass treated as a class, and the 
provisions of this rule shall then be construed and applied accordingly. 

e) 

Settlement, Dismissal or Compromise. 

(1) 

(A) 
 

The  court  must  approve  any  settlement,  dismissal,  or  compromise  of  the 
claims, issues, or defenses of a certified class. 

(B)  Notice  of  the  material  terms  of  the  proposed  settlement,  dismissal  or 
compromise, together with an explanation of when and how the members 
may elect to be excluded from the class, shall be given to all members in 
such manner as the court directs. 

(C) 

The court may approve a settlement, dismissal, or compromise that would 
bind class members only after a hearing and on finding that the settlement, 
dismissal, or compromise is fair, reasonable, and adequate. 

The parties seeking approval of a settlement, dismissal, or compromise under Rule 
42(e)(1) must file a statement identifying any agreement made in connection with 
the proposed settlement, dismissal, or compromise. 

In an action previously certified as a class action under Rule 42(b)(3), the court may 
not approve a settlement unless it affords a new opportunity to request exclusion to 
individual class members who had an earlier opportunity to request exclusion but

did not do so. 

(4) 

(A)  Any  class  member  may  object  to  a  proposed  settlement,  dismissal,  or 
compromise that requires court approval under Rule 42(e)(1)(A). 
 

(B)  An objection made under Rule 42(e)(4)(A) may be withdrawn only with the 
court's approval.(f) Discovery. Unnamed members of a class action are not 
to be considered as parties for purposes of discovery. 

g) 

Class Counsel. 

(1) 

Appointing Class Counsel.   

(A)  Unless  a  statute  provides  otherwise,  a  court  that  certifies  a  class  must 

appoint class counsel.   

(B)  An attorney appointed to serve as class counsel must fairly and adequately 

represent the interests of the class.   

(C) 

In appointing class counsel, the court   

(i) 

must  consider:--  the  work  counsel  has  done  in  identifying  or 
investigating potential claims in the action;-- counsel's experience 
in handling class actions, other complex litigation, and claims of the 
type asserted in the action;-- counsel's knowledge of the applicable 
law;  and--  the  resources  counsel  will  commit  to  representing  the 
class; 

(ii)  may consider any other matter pertinent to counsel's ability to fairly 

and adequately represent the interests of the class; 

(iii)  may  direct  potential  class  counsel  to  provide  information  on  any 
subject  pertinent  to  the  appointment  and  to  propose  terms  for 
attorney fees and nontaxable costs; and 

(iv)  may make further orders in connection with the appointment. 

(2) 

Appointment Procedure. 

(A) 

The  court  may  designate  interim counsel  to  act  on  behalf  of  the  putative 
class before determining whether to certify the action as a class action. 

(B)  When there is one applicant for appointment as class counsel, the court may 
appoint  that  applicant  only  if  the  applicant  is  adequate  under  Rule 
42(g)(1)(B) and (C). If more than one adequate applicant seeks appointment 

Page  31 

 

 

  (

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as class counsel, the court must appoint the applicant or applicants best able 
to represent the interests of the class. 

(C) 

The order appointing class counsel may include provisions about the award 
of attorney fees or nontaxable costs under Rule 42(h) and (i).(h) Procedure 
for  determining  Attorney  Fees  Award.  In  an  action  certified  as  a  class 
action, the court may award attorney fees in accordance with subdivision (i) 
and nontaxable costs authorized by law or by agreement of the parties as 
follows: 

(1)  Motion  for  Award  of  Attorney  Fees.  A  claim  for  an  award  of 
attorney fees and nontaxable costs must be made by motion, subject 
to the provisions of this subdivision, at a time set by the court. Notice 
of the motion must be served on all parties and, for motions by class 
counsel, directed to class members in a reasonable manner. 

(2) 

(3) 

Objections  to  Motion.  A  class  member,  or  a  party  from  whom 
payment is sought, may object to the motion. 

Hearing and Findings. The court must hold a hearing in open court 
and  must  find  the  facts  and  state  its  conclusions  of  law  on  the 
motion. The court must state its findings and conclusions in writing 
or orally on the record. 

In  awarding  attorney  fees,  the  court  must  first  determine  a  lodestar  figure  by 
multiplying the number of hours reasonably worked times a reasonable hourly rate. 
The attorney fees award must be in the range of 25% to 400% of the lodestar figure. 
In  making  these  determinations,  the  court  must  consider  the  factors  specified  in 
Rule 1.04(b), Tex. Disciplinary R. Prof. Conduct. 

If any portion of the benefits recovered for the class are in the form of coupons or 
other noncash common benefits, the attorney fees awarded in the action must be in 
cash and noncash amounts in the same proportion as the recovery for the class. 

j) 

Effective Date.    Rule 42(i) applies only in actions filed after September 1, 2003. 

Notes and Comments 

Comment  to  2003  amendment:  The  second  paragraph  of  subdivision  (a)  regarding 
derivative suits has been deleted because it is redundant of Article 5.14 of the Business Corporation 
Act, which sets forth detailed procedures for derivative suits.   

omment to 2003 amendment: Subparagraph (b)(3) is omitted as unnecessary.

omment to 2003 amendment: The requirement that certification be decided "at an early 
practicable time" is a change from the previous Texas rule 42 (c)(1) and federal rule 23 (c)(1), 
which  required  the  trial  court  to  decide  the  certification  issue  "as  soon  as  practicable  after  the 
commencement of [the suit]." The amended language is not intended to permit undue delay or 
permit excessive discovery unrelated to certification, but is designed to encourage good practices 
in making certification decisions only after receiving the information necessary to decide whether 
certification should be granted or denied and how to define the class if certification is granted. 

 

RULE 43.    INTERPLEADER 
 
Persons having claims against the plaintiff may be joined as defendants and required to interplead 
when their claims are such that the plaintiff is or may be exposed to double or multiple liability. It 
is not ground for objection to the joinder that the claims of the several claimants or the titles on 
which their claims depend do not have a common origin or are not identical but are adverse to and 
independent of one another, or that the plaintiff avers that he is not liable in whole or in part to any 
or all of the claimants. A defendant exposed to similar liability may obtain such interpleader by 
way of cross-claim or counterclaim. The provisions of this rule supplement and do not in any way 
limit the joinder of parties permitted in any other rules. 
 

RULE 44.    MAY APPEAR BY NEXT FRIEND 
 
Minors, lunatics, idiots, or persons non compos mentis who have no legal guardian may sue and 
be represented by "next friend" under the following rules: 
 

Such next friend shall have the same rights concerning such suits as guardians have, 
but shall give security for costs, or affidavits in lieu thereof, when required. 

Such  next  friend  or  his  attorney  of  record  may  with  the  approval  of  the  court 
compromise  suits  and  agree  to  judgments,  and  such  judgments,  agreements  and 
compromises, when approved by the court, shall be forever binding and conclusive 
upon the party plaintiff in such suit.

is given by the allegations as a whole; and   

(c) 

contain any other matter which may be required by any law or rule authorizing or 
regulating any particular action or defense. 

leadings that are not filed electronically must be in writing, on paper measuring approximately 8 
2 inches by 11 inches, and signed by the party or his attorney. The use of recycled paper is strongly 
encouraged.   

ll pleadings shall be construed so as to do substantial justice.

Comment  to  1990  change:  To  provide  for  filing  of  pleadings  having  either  original  or 

copies of signatures and verifications including documents telephonically transferred.   
 

RULE 46.    PETITION AND ANSWER; EACH ONE INSTRUMENT OF WRITING 
 
The original petition, first supplemental petition, second supplemental petition, and every other,

cross-claim, or third party claim, shall contain 

a short statement of the cause of action sufficient to give fair notice of the claim 
involved; 

a statement that the damages sought are within the jurisdictional limits of the court;   

except in suits governed by the Family Code, a statement that the party seeks: 

only  monetary  relief  of  $250,000  or  less,  excluding  interest,  statutory  or

pleading is amended to comply. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 2013 change: Rule 47 is amended to require a more specific statement of the 
relief  sought  by  a  party.  The  amendment  requires  parties  to  plead  into  or  out  of  the  expedited 
actions  process  governed  by  Rule  169,  added  to  implement  section  22.004(h)  of  the  Texas 
Government Code.  Except in a suit governed by the Family Code, the Property Code,  the Tax 
Code, or Chapter 74 of the Civil Practice & Remedies Code, a suit in which the original petition 
contains the statement in paragraph (c)(1) is governed by the expedited actions process. The further 
specificity in paragraphs (c)(2)-(5) is to provide information regarding the nature of cases filed 
and does not affect a party’s substantive rights. 

omment to 2021 change: Rule 47 is amended to implement section 22.004(h-1) of the 
Texas Government Code. A suit in which the original petition contains the statement in paragraph 
(c)(1) is governed by the expedited actions process in Rule 169.

RULE 48.    ALTERNATIVE CLAIMS FOR RELIEF 
 
A party may set forth two or more statements of a claim or defense alternatively or hypothetically, 
either in one count or defense or in separate counts or defenses. When two or more statements are 
made in the alternative and one of them if made independently would be sufficient, the pleading 
is not made insufficient by the insufficiency of one or more of the alternative statements. A party 
may also state as many separate claims or defenses as he has regardless of consistency and whether 
based upon legal or equitable grounds or both. 
 

RULE 49.    WHERE SEVERAL COUNTS 
 
Where  there  are  several  counts  in  the  petition,  and  entire  damages  are  given,  the  verdict  or 
judgment, as the case may be, shall be good, notwithstanding one or more of such counts may be 
defective.

RULE 50.    PARAGRAPHS, SEPARATE STATEMENTS 
 
All averments of claim or defense shall be made in numbered paragraphs, the contents of each of 
which shall be limited as far as practicable to a statement of a single set of circumstances; and a 
paragraph  may  be  referred  to  by  number  in  all  succeeding  pleadings,  so  long  as  the  pleading 
containing such paragraph has  not been  superseded by an amendment as provided by Rule 65. 
Each claim founded upon a separate transaction or occurrence and each defense other than denials 
shall be stated in a separate count or defense whenever a separation facilitates the clear presentation 
of the matters set forth. 
 

RULE 51.    JOINDER OF CLAIMS AND REMEDIES 
 

Joinder of Claims.    The plaintiff in his petition or in a reply setting forth a counterclaim 
and the defendant in an answer setting forth a counterclaim may join either as independent 
or  as  alternate  claims  as  many  claims  either  legal  or  equitable  or  both  as  he  may  have 
against an opposing party. There may be a like joinder of claims when there are multiple 
parties if the requirements of Rules 39, 40, and 43 are satisfied. There may be a like joinder 
of cross claims or third-party claims if the requirements of Rules 38 and 97, respectively, 
are satisfied. 

Joinder of Remedies.    Whenever a claim is one heretofore cognizable only after another 
claim has been prosecuted to a conclusion, the two claims may be joined in a single action; 
but the court shall grant relief in that action only in accordance with the relative substantive 
rights of the parties. This rule shall not be applied in tort cases so as to permit the joinder 
of a liability or indemnity insurance company, unless such company is by statute or contract 
directly liable to the person injured or damaged.

RULE 52.    ALLEGING A CORPORATION 
 
An allegation that a corporation is incorporated shall be taken as true, unless denied by the affidavit 
of  the  adverse  party,  his  agent  or  attorney,  whether  such  corporation  is  a  public  or  private 
corporation and however created. 
 

RULE 53.    SPECIAL ACT OR LAW 
 
A pleading founded wholly or in part on any private or special act or law of this State or of the 
Republic of Texas need only recite the title thereof, the date of its approval, and set out in substance 
so much of such act or laws as may be pertinent to the cause of action or defense. 
 

Page  36 

 

 

 

RULE 54.    CONDITIONS PRECEDENT 
 
In pleading the performance or occurrence of conditions precedent, it shall be sufficient to aver 
generally  that  all  conditions  precedent  have  been  performed  or  have  occurred.  When  such 
performances or occurrences have been so plead, the party so pleading same shall be required to 
prove only such of them as are specifically denied by the opposite party. 
 

RULE 55.    JUDGMENT 
 
In  pleading  a  judgment  or  decision  of  a  domestic  or  foreign  court,  judicial  or  quasi-judicial 
tribunal, or of a board or officer, it shall be sufficient to aver the judgment or decision without 
setting forth matter showing jurisdiction to render it. 
 

When items of special damage are claimed, they shall be specifically stated. 

RULE 56.    SPECIAL DAMAGE 
 

RULE 57.    SIGNING OF PLEADINGS 
 
Every pleading of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of 
record in his individual name, with his State Bar of Texas identification number, address, telephone 
number, email address, and if available, fax number. A party not represented by an attorney shall 
sign  his  pleadings,  state  his  address,  telephone  number,  email  address,  and,  if  available,  fax 
number. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1990 change: To supply attorney telecopier information with other identifying 
information on pleadings. Documents telephonically transferred are permitted to be filed under 
changes in Rule 45. 

 

RULE 58.    ADOPTION BY REFERENCE 
 
Statements in a pleading may be adopted by reference in a different part of the same pleading or 
in another pleading or in any motion, so long as the pleading containing such statements has not 
been superseded by an amendment as provided by Rule 65. 
 

RULE 59.    EXHIBITS AND PLEADING 
 
Notes,  accounts,  bonds,  mortgages,  records,  and  all  other  written  instruments,  constituting,  in 
Page  37 

   

   

 

whole or in part, the claim sued on, or the matter set up in defense, may be made a part of the 
pleadings by copies thereof, or the originals, being attached or filed and referred to as such, or by 
copying the same in the body of the pleading in aid and explanation of the allegations in the petition 
or answer made in reference to said instruments and shall be deemed a part thereof for all purposes. 
Such pleadings shall not be deemed defective because of the lack of any allegations which can be 
supplied from said exhibit. No other instrument of writing shall be made an exhibit in the pleading. 
 

RULE 60.    INTERVENOR'S PLEADINGS 
 
Any  party  may  intervene  by  filing  a  pleading,  subject  to  being  stricken  out  by  the  court  for 
sufficient cause on the motion of any party. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment  to  1990  change:  Rules  21 and  21a  control  notice  and  service  of  pleadings of 

intervenors. 

RULE 61.    TRIAL: INTERVENORS: RULES APPLY TO ALL PARTIES 
 
These rules of pleading shall apply equally, so far as it may be practicable to intervenors and to 
parties, when more than one, who may plead separately. 
 

RULE 62.    AMENDMENT DEFINED 
 
The object of an amendment, as contra-distinguished from a supplemental petition or answer, is to 
add something to, or withdraw something from, that which has been previously pleaded so as to 
perfect that which is or may be deficient, or to correct that which has been incorrectly stated by 
the party making the amendment, or to plead new matter, additional to that formerly pleaded by 
the amending party, which constitutes an additional claim or defense permissible to the suit. 
 

RULE 63.    AMENDMENTS AND RESPONSIVE PLEADINGS 
 
Parties may amend their pleadings, respond to pleadings on file of other parties, file suggestions 
of death and make representative parties, and file such other pleas as they may desire by filing 
such pleas with the clerk at such time as not to operate as a surprise to the opposite party; provided, 
that any pleadings, responses or pleas offered for filing within seven days of the date of trial or 
thereafter, or after such time as may be ordered by the judge under Rule 166, shall be filed only 
after leave of the judge is obtained, which leave shall be granted by the judge unless there is a 
showing that such filing will operate as a surprise to the opposite party. 
 

Notes and Comments 
Page  38 

   

   

 

Comment to 1990 change: To require that all trial pleadings of all parties, except those 
permitted by Rule 66, be on file at least seven days before trial unless leave of court permits later 
filing.   
 

RULE 64.    AMENDED INSTRUMENT 
 
The party amending shall point out the instrument amended, as "original petition," or "plaintiff's 
first supplemental petition," or as "original answer," or "defendant's first supplemental answer" or 
other  instrument  file  by  the  party  and  shall  amend  by  filing  a  substitute  therefor,  entire  and 
complete in itself, indorsed "amended original petition," or "amended first supplemental petition," 
or  "amended  original  answer,"  or  "amended  first  supplemental  answer,"  accordingly  as  said 
instruments of pleading are designated. 
 

RULE 65.    SUBSTITUTED INSTRUMENT TAKES PLACE OF ORIGINAL 
 
Unless the substituted instrument shall be set aside on exceptions, the instrument for which it is 
substituted shall no longer be regarded as a part of the pleading in the record of the cause, unless 
some  error  of  the  court  in  deciding  upon  the  necessity  of  the  amendment,  or  otherwise  in 
superseding it, be complained of, and exception be taken to the action of the court, or unless it be 
necessary to look to the superseded pleading upon a question of limitation. 
 

RULE 66.    TRIAL AMENDMENT 
 
If evidence is objected to at the trial on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the 
pleading,  or  if  during  the  trial  any  defect,  fault  or  omission  in  a  pleading,  either  of  form  or 
substance, is called to the attention of the court, the court may allow the pleadings to be amended 
and shall do so freely when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby 
and  the  objecting  party  fails  to  satisfy  the  court  that  the  allowance  of  such  amendment  would 
prejudice  him  in  maintaining  his  action  or  defense  upon  the  merits.  The  court  may  grant  a 
postponement to enable the objecting party to meet such evidence. 
 

RULE 67.    AMENDMENTS TO CONFORM TO ISSUES TRIED WITHOUT 
OBJECTION 
 
When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they 
shall  be  treated  in  all  respects  as  if  they  had  been  raised  in  the  pleadings.  In  such  case  such 
amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to 
raise these issues may be made by leave of court upon motion of any party at any time up to the 
submission of the case to the Court or jury, but failure so to amend shall not affect the result of the 
trial  of  these  issues;  provided  that  written  pleadings,  before  the  time  of  submission,  shall  be 
necessary to the submission of questions, as is provided in Rules 277 and 279. 

Page  39 

   

 

RULE 68.    COURT MAY ORDER REPLEADER 
 
The court, when deemed necessary in any case, may order a repleader on the part of one or both 
of the parties, in order to make their pleadings substantially conform to the rules. 
 

RULE 69.    SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION OR ANSWER 
 
Each  supplemental  petition  or  answer,  made  by  either  party,  shall  be  a  response  to  the  last 
preceding pleading by the other party, and shall not repeat allegations formerly pleaded further 
than is necessary as an introduction to that which is stated in the pleading then being drawn up. 
These instruments, to wit, the original petition and its several supplements, and the original answer 
and  its  several  supplements,  shall  respectively,  constitute  separate  and  distinct  parts  of  the 
pleadings of each party; and the position and identity, by number and name, with the indorsement 
of each instrument, shall be preserved throughout the pleadings of either party. 
 

RULE 70.    PLEADING: SURPRISE: COST 
 
When either a supplemental or amended pleading is of such character and is presented at such time 
as to take the opposite party by surprise, the court may charge the continuance of the cause, if 
granted, to the party causing the surprise if the other party satisfactorily shows that he is not ready 
for trial because of the allowance of the filing of such supplemental or amended pleading, and the 
court  may,  in  such  event,  in  its  discretion  require  the  party  filing  such  pleading  to  pay  to  the 
surprised party the amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the other party as a result 
of the continuance, including attorney fees, or make such other order with respect thereto as may 
be just. 
 

RULE 71.    MISNOMER OF PLEADING 
 
When a party has mistakenly designated any plea or pleading, the court, if justice so requires, shall 
treat the  plea  or  pleading  as if it  had  been  properly  designated.  Pleadings  shall  be docketed  as 
originally  designated  and  shall  remain  identified  as  designated,  unless  the  court  orders 
redesignation. Upon court order filed with the clerk, the clerk shall modify the docket and all other 
clerk records to reflect redesignation.

RULE 74.    FILING WITH THE COURT DEFINED 
 
The filing of pleadings, other papers and exhibits as required by these rules shall be made by filing 
them with the clerk of the court, except that the judge may permit the papers to be filed with him, 
in which event he shall note thereon the filing date and time and forthwith transmit them to the 
office of the clerk. 
 

RULE 75.    FILED PLEADINGS; WITHDRAWAL 
 
All filed pleadings shall remain at all times in the clerk's office or in the court or in custody of the 
clerk,  except  that  the  court  may  by  order  entered  on  the  minutes  allow  a  filed  pleading  to  be 
withdrawn for a limited time whenever necessary, on leaving a certified copy on file. The party 
withdrawing such pleading shall pay the costs of such order and certified copy. 
 

RULE 75a.    FILING EXHIBITS: COURT REPORTER TO FILE WITH CLERK 
 
The court reporter or stenographer shall file with the clerk of the court all exhibits which were 
admitted in evidence or tendered on bill of exception during the course of any hearing, proceeding, 
or trial. 
 

RULE 75b.    FILED EXHIBITS: WITHDRAWAL 
 
All  filed  exhibits  admitted  in  evidence  or  tendered  on  bill  of  exception  shall,  until  returned  or 
otherwise disposed of as authorized by Rule 14b, remain at all times in the clerk's office or in the 
court or in the custody of the clerk except as follows: 
 

The court may by order entered on the minutes allow a filed exhibit to be withdrawn 
by  any  party  only  upon  such  party's  leaving  on  file  a  certified,  photo,  or  other 
reproduced copy of such exhibit. The party withdrawing such exhibit shall pay the 
costs of such order and copy. 

(a) 

b) 

  (

The court reporter or stenographer of the court conducting the hearing, proceedings, 
or trial in which exhibits are admitted or offered in evidence, shall have the right to 
withdraw  filed  exhibits,  upon  giving  the  clerk  proper  receipt  therefor, whenever 
necessary for the court reporter or stenographer to transmit such original exhibits 
to an appellate court under the provisions of Rule 379 or to otherwise discharge the 
duties imposed by law upon said court reporter or stenographer. 

RULE 76.    MAY INSPECT PAPERS 
 
Each attorney at law practicing in any court shall be allowed at all reasonable times to inspect the 
papers and records relating to any suit or other matter in which he may be interested.

RULE 76a.    SEALING COURT RECORDS 
 

1. 

Standard for Sealing Court  Records.    Court records may not  be removed from court 
files  except  as  permitted  by  statute  or  rule.  No  court  order  or  opinion  issued  in  the 
adjudication  of  a  case  may  be  sealed.  Other  court  records,  as  defined  in  this  rule,  are 
presumed to be open to the general public and may be sealed only upon a showing of all 
of the following: 

 

any probable adverse effect that sealing will have upon the general public 
health or safety; 

a specific, serious and substantial interest which clearly outweighs:  

this presumption of openness;  

 

(1) 

2) 

  (

(a) 
 

(b) 

no less restrictive means than sealing records will adequately and effectively protect 
the specific interest asserted. 

.   

Court Records.    For purposes of this rule, court records means: 

(a) 

all documents of any nature filed in connection with any matter before any civil 
court, except: 

(1) 

documents filed with a court in camera, solely for the purpose of obtaining 
a ruling on the discoverability of such documents; 

(2) 

documents in court files to which access is otherwise restricted by law; 

(3) 

documents filed in an action originally arising under the Family Code. 

(b) 

(c) 

settlement agreements not filed of record, excluding all reference to any monetary 
consideration, that seek to restrict disclosure of information concerning matters that 
have  a  probable  adverse  effect  upon  the  general  public  health  or  safety,  or  the 
administration of public office, or the operation of government. 

discovery,  not  filed  of  record,  concerning  matters  that  have  a  probable  adverse 
effect  upon  the  general  public  health  or  safety,  or  the  administration  of  public 
office, or the operation of government, except discovery in cases originally initiated 
to preserve bona fide trade secrets or other intangible property rights. 

Notice.    Court records may be sealed only upon a party's written motion, which shall be 
open to public inspection. The movant shall post a public notice at the place where notices 
for  meetings  of  county  governmental  bodies  are  required  to  be  posted,  stating:  that  a 

Page  42

hearing will be held in open court on a motion to seal court records in the specific case; 
that any person may intervene and be heard concerning the sealing of court records; the 
specific time and place of the hearing; the style and number of the case; a brief but specific 
description of both the nature of the case and the records which are sought to be sealed; 
and the identity of the movant. Immediately after posting such notice, the movant shall file 
a verified copy of the posted notice with the clerk of the court in which the case is pending 
and with the Clerk of the Supreme Court of Texas. 

Hearing.    A hearing, open to the public, on a motion to seal court records shall be held in 
open court as soon as practicable, but not less than fourteen days after the motion is filed 
and notice is posted. Any party may participate in the hearing. Non-parties may intervene 
as  a  matter  of  right  for  the  limited  purpose  of  participating  in  the  proceedings,  upon 
payment of the fee required for filing a plea in intervention. The court may inspect records 
in  camera  when  necessary.  The  court  may  determine  a  motion  relating  to  sealing  or 
unsealing court records in accordance with the procedures prescribed by Rule 120a. 

Temporary Sealing Order.    A temporary sealing order may issue upon motion and notice 
to any parties who have answered in the case pursuant to Rules 21 and 21a upon a showing 
of  compelling  need  from  specific  facts  shown  by  affidavit  or  by  verified  petition  that 
immediate and irreparable injury will result to a specific interest of the applicant before 
notice can be posted and a hearing held as otherwise provided herein. The temporary order 
shall set the time for the hearing required by paragraph 4 and shall direct that the movant 
immediately  give  the  public  notice  required  by  paragraph  3.  The  court  may  modify  or 
withdraw any temporary order upon motion by any party or intervenor, notice to the parties, 
and  hearing  conducted  as  soon  as  practicable.  Issuance  of  a  temporary  order  shall  not 
reduce in any way the burden of proof of a party requesting sealing at the hearing required 
by paragraph 4. 

Order on Motion to Seal Court Records.    A motion relating to sealing or unsealing court 
records shall be decided by written order, open to the public, which shall state: the style 
and  number  of  the  case;  the  specific  reasons  for  finding  and  concluding  whether  the 
showing  required  by  paragraph  1  has  been  made;  the  specific  portions  of  court  records 
which  are  to  be  sealed;  and  the  time  period  for  which  the  sealed  portions  of  the  court 
records are to be sealed. The order shall not be included in any judgment or other order but 
shall  be  a  separate  document  in  the  case;  however,  the  failure  to  comply  with  this 
requirement shall not affect its appealability. 

Continuing  Jurisdiction.    Any  person  may  intervene  as  a  matter  of  right  at  any  time 
before or after judgment to seal or unseal court records. A court that issues a sealing order 
retains continuing jurisdiction to enforce, alter, or vacate that order. An order sealing or 
unsealing court records shall not be reconsidered on motion of any party or intervenor who 
had  actual  notice  of  the  hearing  preceding  issuance  of  the  order,  without  first  showing 
changed  circumstances  materially  affecting  the  order.  Such  circumstances  need  not  be 
related  to  the  case  in  which  the  order  was  issued.  However,  the  burden  of  making  the 
showing required by paragraph 1 shall always be on the party seeking to seal records.

Appeal.    Any order (or portion of an order or judgment) relating to sealing or unsealing 
court records shall be deemed to be severed from the case and a final judgment which may 
be appealed by any party or intervenor who participated in the hearing preceding issuance 
of such order. The appellate court may abate the appeal and order the trial court to direct 
that  further  public  notice  be  given,  or  to  hold  further  hearings,  or  to  make  additional 
findings. 

Application.    Access to documents in court files not defined as court records by this rule 
remains governed by existing law. This rule does not apply to any court records sealed in 
an action in which a final judgment has been entered before its effective date. This rule 
applies to cases already pending on its effective date only with regard to: 

(a) 

all court records filed or exchanged after the effective date; 

(b) 

any  motion  to  alter  or  vacate  an  order  restricting  access  to court  records,  issued 
before the effective date. 

Notes and Comments 

omment to 1990 change: New rule to establish guidelines for sealing certain court records 

in compliance with Government Code § 22.010. 

RULE 77.    LOST RECORDS AND PAPERS 
 
When any papers or records are lost or destroyed during the pendency of a suit, the parties may, 
with  the  approval  of  the  judge,  agree  in  writing  on  a  brief  statement  of  the  matters  contained 
therein; or either party may supply such lost records or papers as follows: 
 

After three days' notice to the adverse party or his attorney, make written sworn 
motion  before  the  court  stating  the  loss  or  destruction  of  such  record  or  papers, 
accompanied  by  certified  copies  of  the  originals  if  obtainable,  or  by  substantial 
copies thereof. 

If,  upon  hearing,  the  court  be  satisfied  that  they  are  substantial  copies  of  the 
original, an order shall be made substituting such copies or brief statement for the 
originals. 

Such substituted copies or brief statement shall be filed with the clerk, constitute a 
part of the cause, and have the force and effect of the originals.

RULE 78.    PETITION: ORIGINAL AND SUPPLEMENTAL; INDORSEMENT 
 
The pleading of plaintiff shall consist of an original petition, and such supplemental petitions as 
may be necessary in the course of pleading by the parties to the suit. The original petition and the 
supplemental petitions shall be indorsed, so as to show their respective positions in the process of 
pleading, as "original petition," "plaintiff's first supplemental petition," "plaintiff's second 
supplemental petition," and so on, to be successively numbered, named, and indorsed. 

RULE 78a.    CASE INFORMATION SHEET (Repealed 12.11.2018) 

RULE 79.    THE PETITION 
 
The petition shall state the names of the parties and their residences, if known, together with the 
contents prescribed in Rule 47 above. 
 

RULE 80.    PLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION 
 
The  plaintiff's  supplemental  petitions  may  contain  special  exceptions,  general  denials,  and  the 
allegations of new matter not before alleged by him, in reply to those which have been alleged by 
the defendant. 
 

RULE 81.    DEFENSIVE MATTERS 
 
When the defendant sets up a counter claim, the plaintiff may plead thereto under rules prescribed 
for pleadings of defensive matter by the defendant, so far as applicable. Whenever the defendant 
is required to plead any matter of defense under oath, the plaintiff shall be required to plead such 
matters under oath when relied on by him. 
 

RULE 82.    SPECIAL DEFENSES 
 
The plaintiff need not deny any special matter of defense pleaded by the defendant, but the same 
shall be regarded as denied unless expressly admitted.

RULE 83.    ANSWER; ORIGINAL AND SUPPLEMENTAL; INDORSEMENT 
 
The answer of defendant shall consist of an original answer, and such supplemental answers as 
may be necessary, in the course of pleading by the parties to the suit. The original answer and the 
supplemental answers shall be indorsed, so as to show their respective positions in the process of 
pleading,  as  "original  answer,"  "defendant's  first  supplemental  answer,"  "defendant's  second 
supplemental answer," and so on, to be successively numbered, named and indorsed. 

 

RULE 84.    ANSWER MAY INCLUDE SEVERAL MATTERS 
 
The defendant in his answer may plead as many several matters, whether of law or fact, as he may 
think necessary for his defense, and which may be pertinent to the cause, and such matters shall 
be heard in such order as may be directed by the court, special appearance and motion to transfer 
venue, and the practice thereunder being excepted herefrom. 
 

RULE 85.    ORIGINAL ANSWER; CONTENTS 
 
The  original  answer  may  consist  of  motions  to  transfer  venue,  pleas  to  the  jurisdiction,  in 
abatement, or any other dilatory pleas; of special exceptions, of general denial, and any defense by 
way of avoidance or estoppel, and it may present a cross-action, which to that extent will place 
defendant in the attitude of a plaintiff. Matters in avoidance and estoppel may be stated together, 
or  in  several  special  pleas,  each  presenting  a  distinct  defense,  and  numbered  so  as  to  admit  of 
separate issues to be formed on them. 
 

RULE 86.    MOTION TO TRANSFER VENUE 
 

Time to File.    An objection to improper venue is waived if not made by written motion 
filed  prior  to  or  concurrently  with  any  other  plea,  pleading  or  motion  except  a  special 
appearance motion provided for in Rule 120a. A written consent of the parties to transfer 
the case to another county may be filed with the clerk of the court at any time. A motion to 
transfer venue because an impartial trial cannot be had in the county where the action is 
pending is governed by the provisions of Rule 257. 

How to File.    The motion objecting to improper venue may be contained in a separate 
instrument  filed  concurrently  with  or  prior  to  the  filing  of  the  movant's  first  responsive 
pleading or the motion may be combined with other objections and defenses and included 
in the movant's first responsive pleading. 

Requisites of Motion.    The motion, and any amendments to it, shall state that the action 
should be transferred to another specified county of proper venue because: 

(a) 

The county where the action is pending is not a proper county; or

RULE 87.    DETERMINATION OF MOTION TO TRANSFER 
 

Consideration of Motion.    The determination of a motion to transfer venue shall be made 
promptly by the court and such determination must be made in a reasonable time prior to 
commencement of the trial on the merits. The movant has the duty to request a setting on 
the motion to transfer. Except on leave of court each party is entitled to at least 45 days

Burden of Establishing Venue. 

(a) 

In  General.    A  party  who  seeks  to  maintain  venue  of  the  action  in  a  particular 
county  in  reliance  upon  Section  15.001  (General  Rule),  Sections  15.011-15.017 
(Mandatory  Venue),  Sections  15.031-15.040  (Permissive  Venue),  or  Sections 
15.061 and 15.062 (Multiple Claims), Civil Practice and Remedies Code, has the 
burden  to  make  proof,  as  provided  in  paragraph  3  of  this  rule,  that  venue  is 
maintainable in the county of suit. A party who seeks to transfer venue of the action 
to another specified county under Section 15.001 (General Rule), Sections 15.011-
15.017  (Mandatory  Venue),  Sections  15.031-15.040  (Permissive  Venue),  or 
Sections 15.061 and 15.062 (Multiple Claims), Civil Practice and Remedies Code, 
has the burden to make proof, as provided in paragraph 3 of this rule, that venue is 
maintainable in the county to which transfer is sought. A party who seeks to transfer 
venue of the action to another specified county under Sections 15.011-15.017, Civil 
Practice  and  Remedies  Code  on  the  basis  that  a  mandatory  venue  provision  is 
applicable and controlling has the burden to make proof, as provided in paragraph 
3 of this rule, that venue is maintainable in the county to which transfer is sought

by virtue of one or more mandatory venue exceptions. 

(b)    Cause of Action.    It shall not be necessary for a claimant to prove the merits of a 
cause of action, but the existence of a cause of action, when pleaded properly, shall 
be taken as established as alleged by the pleadings. When the defendant specifically 
denies  the  venue  allegations,  the  claimant  is  required,  by  prima  facie  proof  as 
provided in paragraph 3 of this rule, to support such pleading that the cause of action 
taken as established by the pleadings, or a part of such cause of action, accrued in 
the county of suit. If a defendant seeks transfer to a county where the cause of action 
or a part thereof accrued, it shall be sufficient for the defendant to plead that if a 
cause of action exists, then the cause of action or part thereof accrued in the specific 
county  to  which  transfer  is  sought,  and  such  allegation  shall  not  constitute  an 
admission that a cause of action in fact exists. But the defendant shall be required 
to support his pleading by prima facie proof as provided in paragraph 3 of this rule, 
that, if a cause of action exists, it or a part thereof accrued in the county to which 
transfer is sought. 

(c) 

Other  Rules.    A  motion  to  transfer  venue  based  on  the  written  consent  of  the 
parties shall be determined in accordance with Rule 255. A motion to transfer venue 
on the basis that an impartial trial cannot be had in the courts where the action is 
pending shall be determined in accordance with Rules 258 and 259. 

Affidavits and Attachments.    All venue facts, when properly pleaded, shall be 
taken as true unless specifically denied by the adverse party. When a venue fact is 
specifically denied, the party pleading the venue fact must make prima facie proof 
of that venue fact; provided, however, that no party shall ever be required for venue 
purposes  to  support  prima  facie  proof  the  existence  of  a  cause  of  action  or  part 
thereof, and at the hearing the pleadings of the parties shall be taken as conclusive 
on the issues of existence of a cause of action. Prima facie proof is made when the 
venue facts are properly pleaded and an affidavit, and any duly proved attachments 
to the affidavit, are filed fully and specifically setting forth the facts supporting such 
pleading. Affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth specific 
facts  as  would  be  admissible  in  evidence,  and  shall  show  affirmatively  that  the 
affiant is competent to testify. 

(b) 

(c) 

The Hearing.    The court shall determine the motion to transfer venue on the basis 
of  the  pleadings,  any  stipulations  made  by  and  between  the  parties  and  such 
affidavits and attachments as may be filed by the parties in accordance with the 
preceding subdivision of this paragraph 3 or of Rule 88. 

If  a  claimant  has  adequately  pleaded  and  made  prima  facie  proof  that  venue  is 
proper in the county of suit as provided in subdivision (a) of paragraph 3, then the 
cause shall not be transferred but shall be retained in the county of suit, unless the 

Page  48 

Proof. 

(a)

motion to transfer is based on the grounds that an impartial trial cannot be had in 
the  county  where  the  action  is  pending  as  provided  in  Rules  257-259  or  on  an 
established  ground  of  mandatory  venue.  A  ground  of  mandatory  venue  is 
established when the party relying upon a mandatory exception to the general rule 
makes prima facie proof as provided in subdivision (a) of paragraph 3 of this rule. 

(d) 

In the event that the parties shall fail to make prima facie proof that the county of 
suit or the specific county to which transfer is sought is a county of proper venue, 
then the court may direct the parties to make further proof. 

No Jury.    All venue challenges shall be determined by the court without the aid of a jury. 

Motion for Rehearing.    If venue has been sustained as against a motion to transfer, or if 
an action has been transferred to a proper county in response to a motion to transfer, then 
no further motions to transfer shall be considered regardless of whether the movant was a 
party to the prior proceedings or was added as a party subsequent to the venue proceedings, 
unless the motion to transfer is based on the grounds that an impartial trial cannot be had 
under Rules 257-259 or on the ground of mandatory venue, provided that such claim was 
not available to the other movant or movants. 

Parties who are added subsequently to an action and are precluded by this Rule from having 
a motion to transfer considered may raise the propriety of venue on appeal, provided that 
the party has timely filed a motion to transfer. 

There shall be no interlocutory appeals from such determination. 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1990 change: To clarify that no proof of any kind is required of any party to 
establish any element of a cause of action or part thereof; proof is restricted to place, if any, and 
the pleadings establish all other elements and may not be controverted for venue purposes as to 
the existence of a cause of action or part thereof.     
   

RULE 88.    DISCOVERY AND VENUE 
 
Discovery shall not be abated or otherwise affected by pendency of a motion to transfer venue. 
Issuing process for witnesses and taking depositions shall not constitute a waiver of a motion to 
transfer venue, but depositions taken in such case may be read in evidence in any subsequent suit 
between the same parties concerning the same subject matter in like manner as if taken in such 
subsequent  suit.  Deposition  transcripts,  responses  to  requests  for  admission,  answers  to 
interrogatories and other discovery products containing information relevant to a determination of 
proper venue may be considered by the court in making the venue determination when they are 
attached to, or incorporated by reference in, an affidavit of a party, a witness or an attorney who

RULE 89.    TRANSFERRED IF MOTION IS SUSTAINED 
 
If  a  motion  to  transfer  venue  is  sustained, the  cause  shall  not  be  dismissed,  but the  court  shall 
transfer said cause to the proper court; and the costs incurred prior to the time such suit is filed in 
the court to which said cause is transferred shall be taxed against the plaintiff. The clerk shall make 
up a transcript of all the orders made in said cause, certifying thereto officially under the seal of 
the court, and send it with the original papers in the cause to the clerk of the court to which the 
venue has been changed.    Provided, however, if the cause be severable as to parties defendant and 
shall be ordered transferred as to one or more defendants but not as to all, the clerk, instead of 
sending the original papers, shall make certified copies of such filed papers as directed by the court 
and forward the same to the clerk of the court to which the venue has been changed. After the 
cause has been transferred, as above provided for the clerk of the court to which the cause has been 
transferred shall mail notification to the plaintiff or his attorney that transfer of the cause has been 
completed, that the filing fee in the proper court is due and payable within thirty days from the 
mailing of such notification, and that the case may be dismissed if the filing fee is not timely paid; 
and if such filing fee is timely paid, the cause will be subject to trial at the expiration of thirty days 
after the mailing of notification to the parties or their attorneys by the clerk that the papers have 
been filed in the court to which the cause has been transferred; and if the filing fee is not timely 
paid, any court of the transferee county to which the case might have been assigned, upon its own 
motion or the motion of a party, may dismiss the cause without prejudice to the refiling of same. 
 

RULE 90.    WAIVER OF DEFECTS IN PLEADING 
 
General demurrers shall not be used.    Every defect, omission or fault in a pleading either of form 
or of substance, which is not specifically pointed out by exception in writing and brought to the 
attention of the judge in the trial court before the instruction or charge to the jury or, in a non-jury 
case, before the judgment is signed, shall be deemed to have been waived by the party seeking 
reversal  on  such  account;  provided  that  this  rule  shall  not  apply  as  to  any  party  against  whom 
default judgment is rendered. 
 

RULE 91.    SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS 
 
A special exception shall not only point out the particular pleading excepted to, but it shall also 
point out intelligibly and with particularity the defect, omission, obscurity, duplicity, generality, 
or other insufficiency in the allegations in the pleading excepted to. 
 

RULE 91a.    DISMISSAL OF BASELESS CAUSES OF ACTION 

1a.1  Motion  and  Grounds.    Except  in  a  case  brought  under  the  Family  Code  or  a  case 
governed by Chapter 14 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, a party may move 

Page  50

has knowledge of such discovery. 
 

to dismiss a cause of action on the grounds that it has no basis in law or fact.    A cause of 
action  has  no  basis  in  law  if  the  allegations,  taken  as  true,  together  with  inferences 
reasonably drawn from them do not entitle the claimant to the relief sought.    A cause of 
action has no basis in fact if no reasonable person could believe the facts pleaded. 

1a.2  Contents of Motion.    A motion to dismiss must state that it is made pursuant to this rule, 
must identify each cause of action to which it is addressed, and must state specifically the 
reasons the cause of action has no basis in law, no basis in fact, or both. 

1a.3  Time for Motion and Ruling.    A motion to dismiss must be: 

(a) 

filed  within  60  days  after  the  first  pleading  containing  the  challenged  cause  of 
action   is served on the movant; 

(b) 

filed at least 21 days before the motion is heard; and 

(c) 

granted or denied within 45 days after the motion is filed. 

1a.4  Time for Response.    Any response to the motion must be filed no later than 7 days before 

the date of the hearing. 

1a.5  Effect of Nonsuit or Amendment; Withdrawal of Motion. 

The court may not rule on a motion to dismiss if, at least 3 days before the date of 
the hearing, the respondent files a nonsuit of the challenged cause of action, or the 
movant files a withdrawal of the motion. 

If the respondent amends the challenged cause of action at least 3 days before the 
date of the hearing, the movant may, before the date of the hearing, file a withdrawal 
the motion or an amended motion directed to the amended cause of action. 
of   

Except by agreement of the parties, the court must rule on a motion unless it has 
been withdrawn or the cause of action has been nonsuited in accordance with (a) or 
(b).    In ruling on the motion, the court must not consider a nonsuit or amendment 
not filed as permitted by paragraphs (a) or (b). 

An amended motion filed in accordance with (b) restarts the time periods in this 
rule.

1a.6  Hearing; No Evidence Considered.    Each party is entitled to at least 14 days’ notice of 
the hearing on the motion to dismiss.    The court may, but is not required to, conduct an 
oral  hearing  on  the  motion.    Except  as  required  by  91a.7,  the  court  may  not  consider 
evidence in ruling on the motion and must decide the motion based solely on the pleading 
of the cause of action, together with any pleading exhibits permitted by Rule 59.

91a.7  Award of Costs and Attorney Fees. Except in an action by or against a governmental 
entity or a public official acting in his or her official capacity or under color of law, the 
court may award the prevailing party on the motion all costs and reasonable and necessary 
attorney fees incurred with respect to the challenged cause of action in the trial court. Any 
award of costs or fees must be based on evidence.   

1a.8  Effect on Venue and Personal Jurisdiction.    This rule is not an exception to the pleading 
requirements  of  Rules  86  and  120a,  but  a  party  does  not,  by  filing  a motion  to  dismiss 
pursuant to this rule or obtaining a ruling on it, waive a special appearance or a motion to 
transfer venue.    By filing a motion to dismiss, a party submits to the Court’s jurisdiction 
only in proceedings on the motion and is bound by the court’s ruling, including an award 
of attorney fees and costs against the party. 

1a.9  Dismissal Procedure Cumulative.    This rule is in addition to, and does not supersede or 

affect, other procedures that authorize dismissal. 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 2013 change: Rule 91a is a new rule implementing section 22.004(g) of the 
Texas Government Code, which was added in 2011 and calls for rules to provide for the dismissal 
of causes of action that have no basis in law or fact on motion and without evidence. A motion to 
dismiss  filed  under  this  rule  must  be  ruled  on  by  the  court  within  45  days  unless  the  motion, 
pleading,  or  cause  of  action  is  withdrawn,  amended,  or  nonsuited  as  specified  in  91a.5.  If  an 
amended motion is filed in response to an amended cause of action in accordance with 91a.5(b), 
the  court  must  rule  on  the  motion within  45  days  of  the filing  of the  amended motion  and  the 
respondent must be given an opportunity to respond to the amended motion. The term hearing@ in 
the  rule  includes  both  submission  and  an  oral  hearing.  Attorney  fees  awarded  under  91a.7  are 
limited  to  those  associated  with  challenged  cause  of  action,  including  fees  for  preparing  or 
responding to the motion to dismiss. 

omment to 2019 change: Rule 91a.7 is amended to implement changes to section 30.021 
of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. The amendments to Rule 91a.7 apply only to civil 
actions commenced on or after September 1, 2019. A civil action commenced before September 
1, 2019 is governed by the rule as adopted in Misc. Docket No. 13-9022.

RULE 92.    GENERAL DENIAL 
 
A general denial of matters pleaded by the adverse party which are not required to be denied under 
oath, shall be sufficient to put the same in issue. When the defendant has pleaded a general denial, 
and  the  plaintiff  shall  afterward  amend  his  pleading,  such  original  denial  shall  be  presumed  to 
extend to all matters subsequently set up by the plaintiff. 

hen a counterclaim or cross-claim is served upon a party who has made an appearance in the 
action,  the  party  so  served,  in  the  absence  of  a  responsive  pleading,  shall  be  deemed  to  have 

Page  52

pleaded a general denial of the counterclaim or cross-claim, but the party shall not be deemed to 
have waived any special appearance or motion to transfer venue. In all other respects the rules 
prescribed for pleadings of defensive matter are applicable to answers to counterclaims and cross-
claims. 
 

RULE 93.    CERTAIN PLEAS TO BE VERIFIED 
 
A  pleading  setting  up  any  of  the  following  matters,  unless  the  truth  of  such  matters  appear  of 
record, shall be verified by affidavit.   
 

That the plaintiff has not legal capacity to sue or that the defendant has not legal 
capacity to be sued.

Denial of the execution by himself or by his authority of any instrument in writing,

executed by him or by his authority, and not alleged to be lost or destroyed. Where 
such  instrument  in  writing  is  charged  to  have  been  executed  by  a  person  then 
deceased, the affidavit shall be sufficient if it states that the affiant has reason to 
believe and does believe that such instrument was not executed by the decedent or 
by  his  authority.  In  the  absence  of  such  a  sworn  plea,  the  instrument  shall  be 
received in evidence as fully proved. 

A  denial  of  the  genuineness  of  the  indorsement  or  assignment  of  a  written 
instrument upon which suit is brought by an indorsee or assignee and in the absence 
of such a sworn plea, the indorsement or assignment thereof shall be held as fully 
proved.  The  denial  required  by  this  subdivision  of  the  rule  may  be  made  upon 
information and belief.

A  denial  of  an  account  which  is  the  foundation  of  the  plaintiff's  action,  and 
supported by affidavit. 

That  a  contract  sued  upon  is  usurious.  Unless  such  plea  is  filed,  no  evidence  of 
usurious interest as a defense shall be received. 

That notice and proof of loss or claim for damage has not been given as alleged. 
Unless such plea is filed such notice and proof shall be presumed and no evidence 
to the contrary shall be admitted. A denial of such notice or such proof shall be 
made specifically and with particularity. 

In the trial of any case appealed to the court from the Industrial Accident Board the 
following, if pleaded, shall be presumed to be true as pleaded and have been done 
and filed in legal time and manner, unless denied by verified pleadings:

13. 

 

(a)

Any such denial may be made in original or amended pleadings; but if in amended 
pleadings the same must be filed not less than seven days before the case proceeds 
to trial. In case of such denial the things so denied shall not be presumed to be true, 
and if essential to the case of the party alleging them, must be proved. 

14.

trade name as alleged. 

15. 

In the trial of any case brought against an automobile insurance company by an 

Page  54 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insured under the provisions of an insurance policy in force providing protection 
against uninsured motorists, an allegation that the insured has complied with all the 
terms of the policy as a condition precedent to bringing the suit shall be presumed 
to be true unless denied by verified pleadings which may be upon information and 
belief. 

16. 

Any other matter required by statute to be pleaded under oath. 

RULE 94.    AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES 
 
In pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively accord and satisfaction, 
arbitration  and  award,  assumption  of  risk,  contributory  negligence,  discharge  in  bankruptcy, 
duress, estoppel, failure of consideration, fraud, illegality, injury by fellow servant, laches, license, 
payment, release, res judicata, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, waiver, and any other matter 
constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense. Where the suit is on an insurance contract which 
insures  against  certain  general  hazards,  but  contains  other  provisions  limiting  such  general 
liability, the party suing on such contract shall never be required to allege that the loss was not due 
to a risk or cause coming within any of the exceptions specified in the contract, nor shall the insurer 
be allowed to raise such issue unless it shall specifically allege that the loss was due to a risk or 
cause coming within a particular exception to the general liability; provided that nothing herein 
shall be construed to change the burden of proof on such issue as it now exists. 
 

RULE 95.    PLEAS OF PAYMENT 
 
When  a  defendant  shall  desire  to  prove  payment,  he  shall  file  with  his  plea  an  account  stating 
distinctly the nature of such payment, and the several items thereof; failing to do so, he shall not 
be allowed to prove the same, unless it be so plainly and particularly described in the plea as to 
give the plaintiff full notice of the character thereof. 

RULE 96.    NO DISCONTINUANCE 
 
Where the defendant has filed a counterclaim seeking affirmative relief, the plaintiff shall not be 
permitted by a discontinuance of his suit, to prejudice the right of the defendant to be heard on 
such counterclaim. 
 

RULE 97.    COUNTERCLAIM AND CROSS-CLAIM 
 

(a) 

Compulsory Counterclaims.    A pleading shall state as a counterclaim any claim within 
the jurisdiction of the court, not the subject of a pending action, which at the time of filing 
the pleading the pleader has against any opposing party, if it arises out of the transaction 
or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim and does not require 
for  its  adjudication  the  presence  of  third  parties  of  whom  the  court  cannot  acquire 
jurisdiction; provided, however, that a judgment based upon a settlement or compromise 
of a claim of one party to the transaction or occurrence prior to a disposition on the merits 

Page  55 

 

 

 

shall not operate as a bar to the continuation or assertion of the claims of any other party 
to the transaction or occurrence unless the latter has consented in writing that said judgment 
shall operate as a bar. 

Permissive Counterclaims.    A pleading may state as a counterclaim any claim against an 
opposing party whether or not arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject 
matter of the opposing party's claim. 

Counterclaim Exceeding Opposing Claim.    A counterclaim may or may not diminish or 
defeat the recovery sought by the opposing party. It may claim relief exceeding in amount 
or different in kind from that sought in the pleading of the opposing party, so long as the 
subject matter is within the jurisdiction of the court. 

Counterclaim Maturing or Acquired After Pleading.    A claim which either matured or 
was acquired by the pleader after filing his pleading may be presented as a counterclaim 
by amended pleading. 

Cross-Claim Against Co-Party.    A pleading may state as a cross-claim any claim by one 
party against a co-party arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter 
either of the original action or of a counterclaim therein. Such cross-claim may include a 
claim that the party against whom it is asserted is or may be liable to the cross-claimant for 
all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the cross-claimant. 

Additional Parties.    Persons other than those made parties to the original action may be 
made parties to a third party action, counterclaim or cross-claim in accordance with the 
provisions of Rules 38, 39 and 40. 

Tort shall not be the subject of set-off or counterclaim against a contractual demand nor a 
contractual demand against tort unless it arises out of or is incident to or is connected with 
same. 

Separate Trials; Separate Judgments.    If the court orders separate trials as provided in 
Rule 174, judgment on a counterclaim or cross-claim may be rendered when the court has 
jurisdiction  so  to  do,  even  if  the  claims  of  the  opposing  party  have  been  dismissed  or 
otherwise disposed of. 

RULE 98.    SUPPLEMENTAL ANSWERS 
 
The  defendant's  supplemental  answers  may  contain  special  exceptions,  general  denial,  and  the 
allegations of new matter not before alleged by him, in reply to that which has been alleged by the 
plaintiff.

petition on or before 10:00 a.m. on the Monday next after the expiration of twenty days 
after  the  date  of  service  thereof.  The  requirement  of  subsections  10,  12,  and  13  of  this 
section shall be in the form set forth in section c of this rule. 

Notice.    The citation shall include the following notice to the defendant: "You have been 
sued. You may employ an attorney. If you or your attorney do not file a written answer 
with the clerk who issued this citation by 10:00 a.m. on the Monday next following the 
expiration  of  twenty  days  after  you  were  served  this  citation  and  petition,  a  default 
judgment may be taken against you. In addition to filing a written answer with the clerk, 
you  may  be  required  to  make  initial  disclosures  to  the  other  parties  of  this  suit.  These 
disclosures generally must be made no later than 30 days after you file your answer with 
the clerk. Find out more at TexasLawHelp.org." 

Copies.    The party filing any pleading upon which citation is to be issued and served shall

RULE 103.    WHO MAY SERVE 
 
Process  including citation and other notices, writs, orders, and other papers issued by the court 
may be served anywhere by (1) any sheriff or constable or other person authorized by law, (2) any

person authorized by law or by written order of the court who is not less than eighteen years of 
age,  or  (3)  any  person  certified  under  order  of  the  Supreme  Court.    Service  by  registered  or 
certified mail and citation by publication must, if requested, be made by the clerk of the court in 
which the case is pending.    But no person who is a party to or interested in the outcome of a suit 
may serve any process in that suit, and, unless otherwise authorized by a written court order, only 
a sheriff or constable may serve a citation in an action of forcible entry and detainer, a writ that 
requires the actual taking of possession of a person, property or thing, or process requiring that an 
enforcement  action  be  physically  enforced  by  the  person  delivery  the  process.    The  order 
authorizing a person to serve process may  be made  without written motion and  no  fee may be 
imposed for issuance of such order. 

Notes and Comments 

omment to 1988 change: The amendment makes clear that the courts are permitted to 
authorize  persons  other  than  Sheriffs  or  Constables  to  serve  Citation.  Further,  Sheriffs  or 
Constables are not restricted to service in their county. The last sentence is added to avoid the 
necessity of motions and fees.   
 

Comment- 2005: The rule is amended to include among the persons authorized to effect 
service  those  who  meet  certification  requirements  promulgated  by  the  Supreme  Court  and  to 
prohibit private individuals from serving certain types of process unless, in rare circumstances, a 
court authorizes an individual to do so.

RULE 105.    DUTY OF OFFICER OR PERSON RECEIVING 
 
The officer or authorized person to whom process is delivered shall endorse thereon the day and 
hour on which he received it, and shall execute and return the same without delay.

RULE 106.    METHOD OF SERVICE 
 
Unless the citation or court order otherwise directs, the citation must be served by: 

(1) 

(2) 

delivering to the defendant, in person, a copy of the citation, showing the delivery 
date, and of the petition; or 

mailing to the defendant by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, a 
copy of the citation and of the petition. 

Upon motion supported by a statement–sworn to before a notary or made under penalty of 
perjury–listing  any  location  where  the  defendant  can  probably  be  found  and  stating 
specifically the facts showing that service has been attempted under (a)(1) or (a)(2) at the 
location  named  in  the  statement  but  has  not  been  successful,  the  court  may  authorize

by leaving a copy of the citation and of the petition with anyone older than sixteen 
at the location specified in the statement; or 

in  any  other  manner,  including  electronically  by  social  media,  email,  or  other 
technology, that the statement or other evidence shows will be reasonably effective 
to give the defendant notice of the suit. 

Notes and Comments 

omment to 1988 change: Conforms to amendment to Rule 103. 

omment to 2020 Change: Rule 106 is revised in response to section 17.033 of the Civil 
Practice  and  Remedies  Code,  which  calls  for  rules  to  provide  for  substituted  service  of 
citation  by  social  media.  Amended  Rule  106(b)(2)  clarifies  that  a  court  may,  in  proper 
circumstances,  permit  service  of  citation  electronically  by  social  media,  email,  or  other 
technology. In determining whether to permit electronic service of process, a court should 
consider  whether  the  technology  actually  belongs  to  the  defendant  and  whether  the 
defendant  regularly  uses  or  recently  used  the  technology.  Other  clarifying  and  stylistic 
changes have been made.

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1988 change: Amendments are made to conform to changes in Rule 103. 

omment to 1990 change: To state more directly that a default judgment can be obtained 
when the defendant has been served with process in a foreign country pursuant to the provisions 
of Rules 108 or 108a. 

021  Comment:  Certain  default  orders,  like  those  in  suits  for  protection  from  family 
violence, may be exempt by statute from the ten-day requirement in paragraph (h). See, e.g., TEX. 
FAM. CODE § 85.006.

RULE 108.    SERVICE IN ANOTHER STATE 
 
Where the defendant is absent from the State, or is a nonresident of the State, the form of notice to 
such defendant of the institution of the suit shall be the same as prescribed for citation to a resident 
defendant; and such notice may be served by any disinterested person who is not less than eighteen 
years of age, in the same manner as provided in Rule 106 hereof. The return of service in such 
cases shall be completed in accordance with Rule 107. A defendant served with such notice shall 
be required to appear and answer in the same manner and time and under the same penalties as if 
he had been personally served with a citation within this State to the full extent that he may be 
required to appear and answer under the Constitution of the United States in an action either in 
rem or in personam. 
 

RULE 108a.    SERVICE OF PROCESS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES 
 
(a)  Method.    Service of process may be effected on a party in a foreign country if the citation 

and petition is served:   

(1) 

as prescribed by the foreign country’s law for service in that country in an action in 
its courts of general jurisdiction;     

(2) 

as the foreign authority directs in response to a letter rogatory or letter of request;     

(3) 

as provided by Rule 106(a);     

(4) 

pursuant to the terms and provisions of any applicable international agreement;   

(5) 

by  diplomatic  or  consular  officials  when  authorized  by  the  United  States 
Department of State; or   

(6) 

by other means not prohibited by international agreement or the foreign country’s 

Page  61 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law, as the court orders.   

The method for service of process in a foreign country must be reasonably calculated, under 
all of the circumstances, to give actual notice of the proceedings to the defendant in time 
to answer and defend. A defendant served with process under this rule must appear and 
answer in the same manner and time and under the same penalties as if the defendant    had 
been personally served with citation within this state to the full extent that the defendant 
may be required to appear and answer under the Constitution of the United States or under 
any applicable international agreement in an action either in rem or in personam. 

b) 

Return.    Proof of service may be made as prescribed by the foreign country’s law, by court 
order, by Rule 107, or by a method provided in any applicable international agreement. 

Notes and Comments 

omment to 2020 Change: Rule 108a is revised to provide that “other means” of service ordered 
under  (a)(6)  must  not  be  prohibited  by  international  agreement.  Other  clarifying  and  stylistic 
changes have been made.   
 

RULE 109.    CITATION BY PUBLICATION 
 
When  a  party  to  a  suit,  his  agent  or  attorney,  shall  make  oath  that  the  residence  of  any  party 
defendant  is  unknown  to  affiant,  and  to  such  party  when  the  affidavit  is  made  by  his  agent  or 
attorney, or that such defendant is a transient person, and that after due diligence such party and 
the affiant have been unable to locate the whereabouts of such defendant, or that such defendant 
is  absent  from  or  is  a  nonresident  of  the  State,  and  that  the  party  applying  for  the  citation  has 
attempted to obtain personal service of nonresident notice as provided for in Rule 108, but has 
been unable to do so, the clerk shall issue citation for such defendant for service by publication. In 
such cases it shall be the duty of the court trying the case to inquire into the sufficiency of the 
diligence exercised in attempting to ascertain the residence or whereabouts of the defendant or to 
obtain service of nonresident notice, as the case may be, before granting any judgment on such 
service. 
 

RULE 109a.    OTHER SUBSTITUTED SERVICE 
 
Whenever citation by publication is authorized, the court may, on motion, prescribe a different 
method of substituted  service,  if  the  court finds, and so recites in its order, that the  method so 
prescribed would be as likely as publication to give defendant actual notice. When such method of 
substituted  service  is  authorized,  the  return  of  the  officer  executing  the  citation  shall  state 
particularly  the  manner  in  which  service  is  accomplished,  and  shall  attach  any  return  receipt, 
returned mail, or other evidence showing the result of such service. Failure of defendant to respond 
to  such  citation  shall  not  render  the  service  invalid.  When  such  substituted  service  has  been 
obtained and the defendant has not appeared, the provisions of Rules 244 and 329 shall apply as if 
citation had been served by publication.

RULE 110.    EFFECT OF RULES ON OTHER STATUTES 
 
Where by statute or these rules citation by publication is authorized and the statute or rules do not 
specify the requisites of such citation or the method of service thereof, or where they direct that 
such citation be issued or served as in other civil actions, the provisions of these rules shall govern. 
Where, however, the statute authorizing citation by publication provides expressly for requisites 
of such citation or service thereof, or both, differing from the provisions of Rules 114, 115, and 
116,  these  rules  shall  not  govern,  but  the  special  statutory  procedure  shall  continue  in  force; 
provided, however, that Rule 117a shall control with respect to citation in tax suits. 
 

RULE 111.    CITATION BY PUBLICATION IN ACTION AGAINST UNKNOWN 
HEIRS OR STOCKHOLDERS OF DEFUNCT CORPORATIONS 
 
If the plaintiff, his agent, or attorney, shall make oath that the names of the heirs or stockholders 
against whom an action is authorized by Section 17.004, Civil Practice and Remedies Code, are 
unknown to the affiant, the clerk shall issue a citation for service by publication. Such citation 
shall  be  addressed  to  the  defendants  by  a  concise  description  of  their  classification,  as  "the 
Unknown  Heirs  of  A.B.,  deceased,"  or  "Unknown  Stockholders  of  _________________ 
Corporation," as the case may be, and shall contain the other requisites prescribed in Rules 114 
and 115 and shall be served as provided by Rule 116. 
 

RULE 112.    PARTIES TO ACTIONS AGAINST UNKNOWN OWNERS OR 
CLAIMANTS OF INTEREST IN LAND 
 
In  suits authorized  by  Section  17.005,  Civil  Practice  and  Remedies  Code,  all  persons  claiming 
under such conveyance whose names are known to plaintiff shall be made parties by name and 
cited to appear, in the manner now provided by law as in other suits; all other persons claiming 
any  interest  in  such  land  under  such  conveyance  may  be  made  parties  to  the  suit  and  cited  by 
publication  under  the  designation  "all  persons claiming  any  title  or  interest  in  land  under  deed 
heretofore  given  to  _________________  of  _________________  as  grantee"  (inserting  in  the 
blanks the name and residence of grantee as given in such conveyance). It shall be permissible to 
join in one suit all persons claiming under two or more conveyances affecting title to the same 
tract of land. 
 

RULE 113.    CITATION BY PUBLICATION IN ACTIONS AGAINST UNKNOWN 
OWNERS OR CLAIMANTS OF INTEREST IN LAND 
 
In suits authorized by Section 17.005, Civil Practice and Remedies Code, plaintiff, his agent or 
attorney shall make and file with the clerk of the court an affidavit, stating 
 

(a) 

the name of the grantee as set out in the conveyance constituting source of title of 
defendants, and 

(b) 

stating that affiant does not know the names of any persons claiming title or interest 

Page  63 

 

 

under such conveyance other than as stated in plaintiff's petition and 

(c) 

if the conveyance is to a company or association name as grantee, further stating 
whether  grantee  is  incorporated  or  unincorporated,  if  such  fact  is  known,  and  if 
such fact is unknown, so stating. 

Said clerk shall thereupon issue a citation for service upon all persons claiming any title or 
interest in such land under such conveyance. The citation in such cases shall contain the 
requisites and be served in the manner provided in Rules 114, 115 and 116. 

RULE 114.    CITATION BY PUBLICATION; REQUISITES 
 
Where citation by publication is authorized by these rules, the citation shall contain the requisites 
prescribed by Rules 15 and 99, in so far as they are not inconsistent herewith, provided that no 
copy of the plaintiff's petition shall accompany this citation, and the citation shall be styled "The 
State of Texas" and shall be directed to the defendant or defendants by name, if their names are 
known, or to the defendant or defendants as designated in the petition, if unknown, or such other 
classification  as  may  be  fixed  by  any  statute  or  by  these  rules.  Where  there  are  two  or  more 
defendants or classes of defendants to be served by publication, the citation may be directed to all 
of them by name and classification, so that service may be completed by publication of the one 
citation for the required number of times. The citation shall contain the names of the parties, a brief 
statement of the nature of the suit (which need not contain the details and particulars of the claim) 
a description of any property involved and of the interest of the named or unknown defendant or 
defendants, and, where the suit involves land, the requisites of Rule 115. If issued from the district 
or  county  court,  the  citation  shall  command  such  parties  to  appear  and  answer  at  or  before  10 
o'clock a.m. of the first Monday after the expiration of 42 days from the date of issuance thereof, 
specifying the day of the week, the day of the month, and the time of day the defendant is required 
to answer. If issued from the justice of the peace court, such citation shall command such parties 
to appear and answer on or before the first day of the first term of court which convenes after the 
expiration of 42 days from the date of issue thereof, specifying the day of the week, and the day 
of the month, that such term will meet. 
 

RULE 115.    FORM OF PUBLISHED CITATION IN ACTIONS INVOLVING LAND 
 
In citations by publication involving land, it shall be sufficient in making the brief statement of the 
claim in such citation to state the kind of suit, the number of acres of land involved in the suit, or 
the number of the lot and block, or any other plat description that may be of record if the land is 
situated in a city or town, the survey on which and the county in which the land is situated, and 
any special pleas which are relied upon in such suit.

inquiry, each such person in every such class above mentioned, together with any and all 
other  persons,  including  adverse  claimants,  owning  or  claiming  or  having  any  legal  or 
equitable interest in or lien upon such property, may be cited by publication. All unknown 
owners of any interest in any property upon which any taxing unit seeks to foreclose a lien 
for taxes, including stockholders of corporations - defunct or otherwise - their successors, 
heirs, and assigns, may be joined in such suit under the designation of "unknown owners" 
and  citation  be  had  upon  them  as  such;  provided,  however,  that  record  owners  of  such 
property  or  of  any  apparent  interest  therein,  including,  without  limitation,  record  lien 
holders,  shall  not  be  included  in  the  designation  of  "unknown  owners";  and  provided 
further that where any record owner has rendered the property involved within five years 
before the tax suit is filed, citation on such record owner may not be had by publication or 
posting unless citation for personal service has been issued as to such record owner, with 
a notation thereon setting forth the same address as is contained on the rendition sheet made 
within such five years, and the sheriff or other person to whom citation has been delivered 
makes his return thereon that he is unable to locate the defendant. Where any attorney filing 
a tax suit for a taxing unit, or requesting the issance of process in such suit, shall make 
affidavit that a corporation is the record owner of any interest in any property upon which 
a tax lien is sought to be foreclosed, and that he does not know, and after diligent inquiry 
has  been  unable  to  ascertain,  the  location  of  the  place  of  business,  if  any,  of  such 
corporation,  or  the  name  or  place  of  residence  of  any  officer  of  such  corporation  upon 
whom personal service may be had, such corporation may be cited by publication as herein 
provided.  All  defendants  of  the  classes  enumerated  above  may  be  joined  in  the  same 
citation by publication. 

An affidavit which complies with the foregoing requirements therefor shall be sufficient 
basis for the citation above mentioned in connection with it but shall be held to be made 
upon the criminal responsibility of affiant. 

Such citation by publication shall be directed to the defendants by names or by designation 
as hereinabove provided, and shall be issued and signed by the clerk of the court in which 
such tax suit is pending. It shall be sufficient if it states the file number and style of the 
case, the date of the filing of the petition, the names of all parties by name or by designation 
as hereinabove provided, and the court in which the suit is pending; shall command such 
parties to appear and defend such suit at or before 10 o'clock a.m. of the first Monday after 
the expiration of forty-two days from the date of the issuance thereof, specifying such date 
when such parties are required to answer; shall state the place of holding the court, the 
nature of the suit, and the date of the issuance of the citation; and shall be signed and sealed 
by the clerk. 

The citation shall be published in the English language one time a week for two weeks in 
some newspaper published in the county in which the property is located, which newspaper 
must have been in general circulation for at least one year immediately prior to the first 
publication  and  shall  in  every  respect  answer  the  requirements  of  the  law  applicable  to 
newspapers which are employed for such a purpose, the first publication to be not less than 
twenty-eight days prior to the return day fixed in the citation; and the affidavit of the editor 
or publisher of the newspaper giving the date of publication, together with a printed copy 

Page  67 

 

 

 

 

of  the  citation  as  published,  shall  constitute  sufficient  proof  of  due  publication  when 
returned  and  filed  in  court.  If  there  is  no  newspaper  published  in  the  county,  then  the 
publication may be made in a newspaper in an adjoining county, which newspaper shall in 
every  respect  answer  the  requirements  of  the  law  applicable  to  newspapers  which  are 
employed for such a purpose. The maximum fee for publishing the citation shall be the 
lowest  published  word  or  line  rate  of  that  newspaper  for  classified  advertising.  If  the 
publication of the citation cannot be had for this fee, chargeable as costs and payable upon 
sale of the property, as provided by law, and this fact is supported by the affidavit of the 
attorney for the plaintiff or the attorney requesting the issuance of the process, then service 
of the citation may be made by posting a copy at the courthouse door of the county in which 
the suit is pending, the citation to be posted at least twenty-eight days prior to the return 
day fixed in the citation. Proof of the posting of the citation shall be made by affidavit of 
the attorney for the plaintiff, or of the person posting it. When citation is served as here 
provided  it  shall  be  sufficient,  and  no  other  form  of  citation  or  notice  to  the  named 
defendants therein shall be necessary. 

Citation  in  Tax  Suits:  General  Provisions.    Any  process  authorized  by  this  rule  may 
issue jointly in behalf of all taxing units who are plaintiffs or intervenors in any tax suit. 
The statement of the nature of the suit, to be set out in the citation, shall be sufficient if it 
contains a brief general description of the property upon which the taxes are due and the 
amount  of  such  taxes,  exclusive  of  interest,  penalties,  and  costs,  and  shall  state,  in 
substance, that in such suit the plaintiff and all other taxing units who may set up their 
claims therein seek recovery of the delinquent ad valorem taxes due on said property, and 
the  (establishment  and  foreclosure)  of  liens,  if  any,  securing  the  payment  of  same,  as 
provided by law; that in addition to the taxes all interest, penalties, and costs allowed by 
law up to and including the day of judgment are included in the suit; and that all parties to 
the suit, including plaintiff, defendants, and intervenors, shall take notice that claims for 
any taxes on said property becoming delinquent subsequent to the filing of the suit and up 
to  the  day  of  judgment,  together  with  all  interest,  penalties,  and  costs  allowed  by  law 
thereon, may, upon request therefor, be recovered therein without further citation or notice 
to  any  parties  thereto.  Such  citation  need  not  be  accompanied  by  a  copy  of  plaintiff's 
petition and no such copy need be served. Such citation shall also show the names of all 
taxing units which assess and collect taxes on said property not made parties to such suit, 
and shall contain, in substance, a recitation that each party to such suit shall take notice of, 
and plead and answer to, all claims and pleadings then on file or thereafter filed in said 
cause by all other parties therein, or who may intervene therein and set up their respective 
tax claims against said property. After citation or notice has been given on behalf of any 
plaintiff or intervenor taxing unit, the court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine 
the tax claims of all taxing units whoare parties plaintiff, intervenor or defendant at the 
time such process is issued and of all taxing units intervening after such process is issued, 
not only for the taxes, interest, penalties, and costs which may be due on said property at 
the time the suit is filed, but those becoming delinquent thereon at any time thereafter up 
to and including the day of judgment, without the necessity of further citation or notice to 
any party to said suit; and any taxing unit having a tax claim against said property may, by 
answer or intervention, set up and have determined its tax claim without the necessity of 
further citation or notice to any parties to such suit.

  _

  _

  B

   

 

At any time in its discretion and upon such notice and on such terms as it deems just, the court 
may allow any process or proof of service thereof to be amended, unless it clearly appears that 
material  prejudice  would  result  to  the  substantial  rights  of  the  party  against  whom  the  process 
issued. 
 

RULE 119.    ACCEPTANCE OF SERVICE 
 
The defendant may accept service of process, or waive the issuance or service thereof by a written 
memorandum signed by him, or by his duly authorized agent or attorney, after suit is brought, 
sworn to before a proper officer other than an attorney in the case, and filed among the papers of 
the cause, and such waiver or acceptance shall have the same force and effect as if the citation had 
been issued and served as provided by law. The party signing such memorandum shall be delivered 
a  copy  of  plaintiff's  petition,  and  the  receipt  of  the  same  shall  be  acknowledged  in  such 
memorandum.  In  every  divorce  action  such  memorandum  shall  also  include  the  defendant's 
mailing address. 
 

RULE 119a.    COPY OF DECREE 
 
The  district  clerk  shall  forthwith  mail  a  certified  copy  of  the  final  divorce  decree  or  order  of 
dismissal to the party signing a memorandum waiving issuance or service of process. Such divorce 
decree or order of dismissal shall be mailed to the signer of the memorandum at the address stated 
in such memorandum or to the office of his attorney of record. 
 

RULE 120.    ENTERING APPEARANCE 
 
The defendant may, in person, or by attorney, or by his duly authorized agent, enter an appearance 
in open court. Such appearance shall be noted by the judge upon his docket and entered in the 
minutes, and shall have the same force and effect as if the citation had been duly issued and served 
as provided by law. 
 

RULE 120a.    SPECIAL APPEARANCE 
 

  Notwithstanding the provisions of Rules 121, 122 and 123, a special appearance may be 
made  by  any  party  either  in  person  or  by  attorney  for  the  purpose  of  objecting  to  the 
jurisdiction of the court over the person or property of the defendant on the ground that 
such  party  or  property  is  not  amenable  to  process  issued  by  the  courts  of  this  State.  A 
special appearance may be made as to an entire proceeding or as to any severable claim 
involved therein. Such special appearance shall be made by sworn motion filed prior to 
motion to transfer venue or any other plea, pleading or motion; provided however, that a 
motion to transfer venue and any other plea, pleading, or motion may be contained in the 
same instrument or filed subsequent thereto without waiver of such special appearance; 
and may be amended to cure defects. The issuance of process for witnesses, the taking of 
depositions,  the  serving  of  requests  for  admissions,  and  the  use  of  discovery  processes, 

Page  72 

1. 

 

shall  not  constitute  a  waiver  of  such  special  appearance.  Every  appearance,  prior  to 
judgment, not in compliance with this rule is a general appearance. 

Any motion to challenge the jurisdiction provided for herein shall be heard and determined 
before  a  motion  to  transfer  venue  or  any  other  plea  or  pleading  may  be  heard.  No 
determination  of  any  issue  of  fact  in  connection  with  the  objection  to  jurisdiction  is  a 
determination of the merits of the case or any aspect thereof. 

The  court  shall  determine  the  special  appearance  on  the  basis  of  the  pleadings,  any 
stipulations made by and between the parties, such affidavits and attachments as may be 
filed  by  the  parties,  the  results  of  discovery  processes,  and  any  oral  testimony.  The 
affidavits, if any, shall be served at least seven days before the hearing, shall be made on 
personal knowledge, shall set forth specific facts as would be admissible in evidence, and 
shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify. 

Should  it  appear  from  the  affidavits  of  a  party  opposing  the  motion  that  he  cannot  for 
reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify his opposition, the court may 
order  a  continuance  to  permit  affidavits  to  be  obtained  or  depositions  to  be  taken  or 
discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just. 

hould it appear to the satisfaction of the court at any time that any of such affidavits are 
presented in violation of Rule 13, the court shall impose sanctions in accordance with that 
rule. 

  S

If the court sustains the objection to jurisdiction, an appropriate order shall be entered. If 
the  objection  to  jurisdiction  is  overruled,  the  objecting  party  may  thereafter  appear 
generally for any purpose. Any such special appearance or such general appearance shall 
not be deemed a waiver of the objection to jurisdiction when the objecting party or subject 
matter is not amenable to process issued by the courts of this State. 

RULE 121.    ANSWER IS APPEARANCE 
 
An answer shall constitute an appearance of the defendant so as to dispense with the necessity for 
the issuance or service of citation upon him. 
 

RULE 122.    CONSTRUCTIVE APPEARANCE 
 
If the citation or service thereof is quashed on motion of the defendant, such defendant shall be 
deemed to have entered his appearance at ten o'clock a.m. on the Monday next after the expiration 
of twenty (20) days after the day on which the citation or service is quashed, and such defendant 
shall be deemed to have been duly served so as to require him to appear and answer at that time, 
and if he fails to do so, judgment by default may be rendered against him.

RULE 123.    REVERSAL OF JUDGMENT 
 
Where the judgment is reversed on appeal or writ of error for the want of service, or because of 
defective service of process, no new citation shall be issued or served, but the defendant shall be 
presumed to have entered his appearance to the term of the court at which the mandate shall be 
filed. 
 

RULE 124.    NO JUDGMENT WITHOUT SERVICE 
 
In no case shall judgment be rendered against any defendant unless upon service, or acceptance or 
waiver of process, or upon an appearance by the defendant, as prescribed in these rules, except 
where otherwise expressly provided by law or these rules. 

hen a party asserts a counterclaim or a cross-claim against another party who has entered an 
appearance, the claim may be served in any manner prescribed for service of citation or as provided 
in Rule 21(a).

constable is an officer. 
 
Exception: Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs Filed. If a Statement 
of Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs has been filed in a case in which the declarant 
requests  service  of  process  in  a  county  other  than  in  the  county  of  suit,  the  clerk  must 
indicate on the document to be served that a Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of 
Court  Costs  has  been  filed.  The  sheriff  or  constable  must  execute  the  service  without 
demanding payment. 

RULE 127.    PARTIES LIABLE FOR OTHER COSTS 
 
Each party to a suit shall be liable for all costs incurred by him. If the costs cannot be collected 
from the party against whom they have been judged, execution may issue against any party in such 
suit for the amount of costs incurred by such party, but no more.

his costs, but each party shall be taxed with the costs incurred by him in such suit. 
 

RULE 138.    COST OF NEW TRIALS 
 
The costs of new trials may either abide the result of the suit or may be taxed against the party to

RULE 139.    ON APPEAL AND CERTIORARI 
 
When a case is appealed, if the judgment of the higher court be against the appellant, but for less 
amount than the original judgment, such party shall recover the costs of the higher court but shall 
be adjudged to pay the costs of the court below; if the judgment be against him for the same or a 
greater amount than in the court below, the adverse party shall recover the costs of both courts. If 
the judgment of the court above be in favor of the party appealing and for more than the original 
judgment, such party shall recover the costs of both courts; if the judgment be in his favor, but for 
the same or a less amount than in the court below, he shall recover the costs of the court below, 
and pay the costs of the court above. 
 

RULE 140.    NO FEE FOR COPY

RULE 143.    RULE FOR COSTS 
 

Page  76 

A party seeking affirmative relief may be ruled to give security for costs at any time before final 
judgment, upon motion of any party, or any officer of the court interested in the costs accruing in 
such suit, or by the court upon its own motion. If such rule be entered against any party and he 
failed  to  comply  therewith  on  or  before  twenty  (20)  days  after  notice  that  such  rule  has  been 
entered, the claim for affirmative relief of such party shall be dismissed. 
 

RULE 143a.    COSTS ON APPEAL TO COUNTY COURT

of the peace having original jurisdiction and the justice of the peace shall proceed as though no 
appeal had been attempted. 
 

RULE 144.    JUDGMENT ON COST BOND

copies,  fees  for  a  court-appointed  professional,  and  fees  charged  by  the  clerk  or  court 
reporter for preparation of the appellate record. 

Sworn Statement Required. A party who cannot afford payment of court costs must file the 
Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs approved by the Supreme Court 
or another sworn document containing the same information. A “sworn” Statement is one 
that is signed before a notary or made under penalty of perjury. In this rule, “declarant” 
means the party filing the Statement. 

must make the Statement available to any person for free without request; 
 
may  return  a  Statement  for  correction  only  if  it  is  not  sworn—not  for  failure  to 
attach evidence or any other reason; and 

must, on the filing of a sworn Statement, docket the case, issue citation, and provide 
any other service that is ordinarily provided to a party. 

(d) 

 
Prima Facie Evidence of Inability to Afford Payment of Costs. The declarant should submit 
with the Statement any available evidence of the declarant’s inability to afford payment of

costs. An attachment demonstrating any of the following is prima facie evidence: 

the  declarant  or the declarant’s dependent receives benefits  from a  means-tested 
government entitlement program; 

the declarant is being represented in the case by an attorney who is providing legal 
services to the declarant through: 

(A) 

a provider funded by the Texas Access to Justice Foundation; 

(B) 

a provider funded by the Legal Services Corporation; or 

(C) 

a nonprofit that provides civil legal services to persons living at or below 
200% of the federal poverty guidelines published annually by the United 
States Department of Health and Human Services; or 

(3) 

the declarant has applied for free legal services for the case through a provider listed 
in (2) and was determined to be financially eligible but was declined representation. 

e)  Motion to Require Payment of Costs. A motion to require the declarant to pay costs must 

comply with this paragraph. 

By  the  Clerk,  the  Reporter,  or  a  Party.  A  motion  filed  by  the  clerk,  the  court 
reporter, or a party must contain sworn evidence—not merely allegations—either 
that  the  Statement  was  materially  false  when  made  or  that  because  of  changed 
circumstances, it is no longer true. 
 
By the Court. The court on its own may require the declarant to prove the inability 
to afford costs when evidence comes before the court that the declarant may be able 
to afford costs or when an officer or professional must be appointed in the case. 

Notice; Hearing; Requirements of Order. When a Statement has been filed, the declarant 
must not be ordered to pay costs unless these procedural requirements have been satisfied: 

f) 

  (

Notice and Hearing. The declarant must not be required to pay costs without an 
oral evidentiary hearing. The declarant must be given 10 days’ notice of the hearing. 
Notice must either be in writing and served in accordance with Rule 21a or given 
in open court. At the hearing, the burden is on the declarant to prove the inability 
to afford costs. 

Findings Required. An order requiring the declarant to pay costs must be supported 
by detailed findings that the declarant can afford to pay costs. 

Partial and Delayed Payment. The court may order that the declarant pay the part 
of the costs the declarant can afford or that payment be made in installments. But 
the court must not delay the case if payment is made in installments.

Order Must State Notice of Right to Appeal. An order requiring the declarant to pay 
costs  must  state in  conspicuous  type:  “You  may  challenge this  order  by  filing  a 
motion in the court of appeals within 10 days after the date this order is signed. See 
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 145.” 

g) 

Review of Trial Court Order.   

Only Declarant May Challenge; Motion. Only the declarant may challenge an order 
issued by the trial court under this rule. The declarant may challenge the order by 
motion  filed  in  the  court  of  appeals  with  jurisdiction  over  an  appeal  from  the 
judgment in the case. The declarant is not required to pay any filing fees related to 
the motion in the court of appeals.   
 
Time for Filing; Extension. The motion must be filed within 10 days after the trial 
court’s order is signed. The court of appeals may extend the deadline by 15 days if 
the declarant demonstrates good cause for the extension in writing. 

Record. After a motion is filed, the court of appeals must promptly send notice to 
the trial court clerk and the court reporter requesting preparation of the record of all 
trial court proceedings on the declarant’s claim of indigence. The court may set a 
deadline for filing the record. The record must be provided without charge. 

4) 

Court of Appeals to Rule Promptly. The court of appeals must rule on the motion 
at the earliest practicable time. 

Judgment. The judgment must not require the declarant to pay costs, and a provision in the 
judgment purporting to do so is void, unless the court has issued an order that complies 
with  (f),  or  the  declarant  has  obtained  a  monetary  recovery,  and  the  court  orders  the 
recovery to be applied toward payment of costs. 

Court  to  Designate  Record.  When  the  declarant  requests  preparation  of  the  reporter’s 
record, the court must designate the portions to be transcribed. 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1988 change: The purpose of this rule is to allow indigents to file suit and 

have citation issued based solely on an affidavit of indigency filed with the suit.       

Comment-  2005:  The  rule  is  amended  to  prohibit  the  contest  of  an  affidavit  that  is 

accompanied by an attorney’s IOLTA certificate. 
 

Comment to 2016 Change: The rule has been rewritten. Access to the civil justice system 
cannot be denied because a person cannot afford to pay court costs. Whether a particular fee is a 
court cost is governed by this rule, Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section 31.007, and case 
law.

he issue is not merely whether a person can pay costs, but whether the person can afford to pay 
costs. A person may have sufficient cash on hand to pay filing fees, but the person cannot afford 
the fees if paying them would preclude the person from paying for basic essentials, like housing 
or food. Experience indicates that almost all filers described in (e)(1)-(3), and most filers described 
in (e)(4), cannot in fact afford to pay costs.   

ecause costs to access the system—filing fees, fees for issuance of process and notices, and fees 
for service and return—are kept relatively small, the expense involved in challenging a claim of 
inability to afford costs often exceeds the costs themselves. Thus, the rule does not allow the clerk 
or a party to challenge a litigant’s claim of inability to afford costs without sworn evidence that 
the claim is false. The filing of a Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs—which 
may either be sworn to before a notary or made under penalty of perjury, as permitted by Civil 
Practice and Remedies Code Section 132.001—is all that is needed to require the clerk to provide 
ordinary services without payment of fees and costs. But evidence may come to light that the claim 
was false when made. And the declarant’s circumstances may change, so that the claim is no longer 
true. Importantly, costs may increase with the appointment of officers or professionals in the case, 
or when a reporter’s record must be prepared. The reporter is always allowed to challenge a claim 
of inability to afford costs before incurring the substantial expense of record preparation. The trial 
court always retains discretion to require evidence of an inability to afford costs. 

Comment  to  2021  Change:  A  number  of  changes  have  been  made  to  reduce  frivolous 
challenges  to  a  Statement,  which  cost  time  and  money,  and  to  streamline  proceedings.  Former 
paragraph (c)(4) has been deleted. Paragraph (d) has been amended to clarify that proof of any 
listed  criterion  is  prima  facie  evidence  of  the  declarant’s  inability  to  afford  payment  of  costs. 
Paragraph (e) has been amended to require that a contest by the court reporter satisfy the same 
conditions  as  a  contest  by  the  clerk  or  a  party.  New  paragraph  (i)  requires  that  the  trial  court 
designate the portions of the reporter’s record to be transcribed for appeal.   

The  rule  has  also  been  amended  to  require  in  paragraph  (f)(4)  that  an  order  requiring 

payment of costs include conspicuous notice of the declarant’s right to appeal.   
 

To accommodate these substantive changes, some paragraphs have been rearranged and 

relettered or renumbered. Other clarifying and stylistic changes have been made. 
 

RULE 146.    DEPOSIT FOR COSTS 
 
In lieu of a bond for costs, the party required to give the same may deposit with the clerk of court 
or the justice of the peace such sum as the court or justice from time to time may designate as 
sufficient to pay the accrued costs. 
 

RULE 147.    APPLIES TO ANY PARTY 

he foregoing rules as to security and rule for costs shall apply to any party who seeks a judgment 

against any other party.

RULE 148.    SECURED BY OTHER BOND 
 
No further security shall be required if the costs are secured by the provisions of an attachment or 
other bond filed by the party required to give security for costs. 

RULE 149.    EXECUTION FOR COSTS 
 
When costs have been adjudged against a party and are not paid, the clerk or justice of the court 
in which the suit was determined may issue execution, accompanied by an itemized bill of costs, 
against such party to be levied and collected as in other cases; and said officer, on demand of any 
party to whom any such costs are due, shall issue execution for costs at once. This rule shall not 
apply to executors, administrators or guardians in cases where costs are adjudged against the estate 
of  a  deceased  person  or  of  a  ward.  No  execution  shall  issue  in  any  case  for  costs  until  after 
judgment rendered therefor by the court. 

Section 7.    Abatement and Discontinuance of Suit 

RULE 150.    DEATH OF PARTY 
 
Where the cause of action is one which survives, no suit shall abate because of the death of any 
party thereto before the verdict or decision of the court is rendered, but such suit may proceed to 
judgment as hereinafter provided. 
 

RULE 151.    DEATH OF PLAINTIFF 
 
If the plaintiff dies, the heirs, or the administrator or executor of such decedent may appear and 
upon suggestion of such death being entered of record in open court, may be made plaintiff, and 
the suit shall proceed in his or their name. If no such appearance and suggestion be made within a 
reasonable time after the death of the plaintiff, the clerk upon the application of defendant, his 
agent or attorney, shall issue a scire facias for the heirs or the administrator or executor of such 
decedent, requiring him to appear and prosecute such suit. After service of such scire facias, should 
such  heir  or  administrator  or  executor  fail  to  enter  appearance  within  the  time  provided,  the 
defendant may have the suit dismissed. 
 

RULE 152.    DEATH OF DEFENDANT 
 
Where the defendant shall die, upon the suggestion of death being entered of record in open court, 
or upon petition of the plaintiff, the clerk shall issue a scire facias for the administrator or executor 
or heir requiring him to appear and defend the suit and upon the return of such service, the suit 
shall proceed against such administrator or executor or heir. 
 

Page  81 

 

   

 

RULE 153.    WHEN EXECUTOR, ETC. DIES 
 
When an executor or administrator shall be a party to any suit, whether as plaintiff or as defendant, 
and shall die or cease to be such executor or administrator, the suit may be continued by or against 
the person succeeding him in the administration, or by or against the heirs, upon like proceedings 
being had as provided in the two preceding rules, or the suit may be dismissed, as provided in Rule 
151. 
 

RULE 154.    REQUISITES OF SCIRE FACIAS 
 
The scire facias and returns thereon, provided for in this section, shall conform to the requisites of 
citations and the returns thereon, under the provisions of these rules. 
 

RULE 155.    SURVIVING PARTIES 
 
Where there are two or more plaintiffs or defendants, and one or more of them die, upon suggestion 
of such death being entered upon the record, the suit shall at the instance of either party proceed 
in the name of the surviving plaintiffs or against the surviving defendants, as the case may be. 
 

RULE 156.    DEATH AFTER VERDICT OR CLOSE OF EVIDENCE 
 
When a party in a jury case dies between verdict and judgment, or a party in a non-jury case dies 
after the evidence is closed and before judgment is pronounced, judgment shall be rendered and 
entered as if all parties were living. 

[RULE 157.    Repealed effective January 1, 1988] 
 

RULE 158.    SUIT FOR THE USE OF ANOTHER 
 
When a plaintiff suing for the use of another shall die before verdict, the person for whose use 
such suit was brought, upon such death being suggested on the record in open court, may prosecute 
the suit in his own name, and shall be as responsible for costs as if he brought the suit 
 

RULE 159.    SUIT FOR INJURIES RESULTING IN DEATH 
 
In cases arising under the provisions of the title relating to injuries resulting in death, the suit shall 
not abate by the death of either party pending the suit, but in such case, if the plaintiff dies, where 
there is only one plaintiff, some one or more of the parties entitled to the money recovered may be 
substituted and the suit prosecuted to judgment in the name of such party or parties, for the benefit 
of the person entitled; if the defendant dies, his executor, administrator or heir may be made a 

Page  82 

   

 

party, and the suit prosecuted to judgment. 
 

RULE 160.    DISSOLUTION OF CORPORATION 
 
The  dissolution  of  a  corporation  shall  not  operate  to  abate  any  pending  suit  in  which  such 
corporation is a defendant, but such suit shall continue against such corporation and judgment shall 
be rendered as though the same were not dissolved. 
 

RULE 161.    WHERE SOME DEFENDANTS NOT SERVED 
 
When some of the several defendants in a suit are served with process in due time and others are 
not so served, the plaintiff may either dismiss as to those not so served and proceed against those 
who are, or he may take new process against those not served, or may obtain severance of the case 
as between those served and those not served, but no dismissal shall be allowed as to a principal 
obligor without also dismissing the parties secondarily liable except in cases provided by statute. 
No defendant against whom any suit may be so dismissed shall be thereby exonerated from any 
liability, but may at any time be proceeded against as if no such suit had been brought and no such 
dismissal ordered. 
 

RULE 162.    DISMISSAL OR NON-SUIT 
 
At any time before the plaintiff has introduced all of his evidence other than rebuttal evidence, the 
plaintiff may dismiss a case, or take a non-suit, which shall be entered in the minutes. Notice of 
the  dismissal  or  non-suit  shall  be  served  in  accordance  with  Rule  21a  on  any  party  who  has 
answered or has been served with process without necessity of court order. 

ny dismissal pursuant to this rule shall not prejudice the right of an adverse party to be heard on 
a pending claim for  affirmative  relief or excuse the payment of all costs taxed by  the clerk. A 
dismissal under this rule shall have no effect on any motion for sanctions, attorney's fees or other 
costs, pending at the time of dismissal, as determined by the court. Any dismissal pursuant to this 
rule which terminates the case shall authorize the clerk to tax court costs against dismissing party 
unless otherwise ordered by the court. 
 

Notes and Comments 

 

Comment to 1988 change: The purpose of this rule is to fix a definite time after which a party may 
not  voluntarily  dismiss or  non-suit the  cause  of action.  In addition,  these  amendments  will  not 
disturb any pending motions for sanctions or attorney’s fees that were filed before the motion for 
non-suit or dismissal.   
 

RULE 163.    DISMISSAL AS TO PARTIES SERVED, ETC. 
 
When it will not prejudice another party, the plaintiff may dismiss his suit as to one or more of 

Page  83

several parties who were served with process, or who have answered, but no such dismissal shall 
in any case, be allowed as to a principal obligor, except in the cases provided for by statute. 

[RULE 164.    Repealed effective January 1, 1988] 
 

RULE 165.    ABANDONMENT 
 
A party who abandons any part of his claim or defense, as contained in the pleadings, may have 
that fact entered of record, so as to show that the matters therein were not tried. 
 

RULE 165a.    DISMISSAL FOR WANT OF PROSECUTION 
 

Failure to Appear.    A case may be dismissed for want of prosecution on failure of any 
party seeking affirmative relief to appear for any hearing or trial of which the party had 
notice. Notice of the court's intention to dismiss and the date and place of the dismissal 
hearing  shall  be  sent  by  the  clerk  to  each  attorney  of  record,  and  to  each  party  not 
represented by an attorney and whose address is shown on the docket or in the papers on 
file, by posting same in the United States Postal Service. At the dismissal hearing, the court 
shall  dismiss  for  want  of  prosecution  unless  there  is  good  cause  for  the  case  to  be 
maintained on the docket. If the court determines to maintain the case on the docket, it shall 
render a pretrial order assigning a trial date for the case and setting deadlines for the joining 
of  new  parties,  all  discovery,  filing  of  all  pleadings,  the  making  of  a  response  or 
supplemental responses to discovery and other pretrial matters. The case may be continued 
thereafter only for valid and compelling reasons specifically determined by court order. 
Notice of the signing of the order of dismissal shall be given as provided in Rule 306a. 
Failure to mail notices as required by this rule shall not affect any of the periods mentioned 
in Rule 306a except as provided in that rule. 

Non-Compliance  With  Time  Standards.    Any  case  not  disposed  of  within  time 
standards promulgated by the Supreme Court under its Administrative Rules may be placed 
on a dismissal docket. 

Reinstatement.    A motion to reinstate shall set forth the grounds therefor and be verified 
by the movant or his attorney. It shall be filed with the clerk within 30 days after the order 
of dismissal is signed or within the period provided by Rule 306a. A copy of the motion to 
reinstate shall be served on each attorney of record and each party not represented by an 
attorney whose address is shown on the docket or in the papers on file. The clerk shall 
deliver a copy of the motion to the judge, who shall set a hearing on the motion as soon as 
practicable. The court shall notify all parties or their attorneys of record of the date, time 
and place of the hearing. 

The court shall reinstate the case upon finding after a hearing that the failure of the party 
or his attorney was not intentional or the result of conscious indifference but was due to an 
accident or mistake or that the failure has been otherwise reasonably explained.

In the event  for any  reason  a motion for reinstatement is not decided by signed written 
order within seventy-five days after the judgment is signed, or, within such other time as 
may be allowed by Rule 306a, the motion shall be deemed overruled by operation of law. 
If a motion to reinstate is timely filed by any party, the trial court, regardless of whether an 
appeal has been perfected, has plenary power to reinstate the case until 30 days after all 
such timely filed motions are overruled, either by a written and signed order or by operation 
of law, whichever occurs first. 

Cumulative Remedies.    This dismissal and reinstatement procedure shall be cumulative 
of the rules and laws governing any other procedures available to the parties in such cases. 
The same reinstatement procedures and timetable are applicable to all dismissals for want 
of prosecution including cases which are dismissed pursuant to the court's inherent power, 
whether or not a motion to dismiss has been filed. 

Section 8.    Pre-Trial Procedure 

RULE 166.    PRE-TRIAL CONFERENCE 
 
In an appropriate action, to assist in the disposition of the case without undue expense or burden 
to the parties, the court may in its discretion direct the attorneys for the parties and the parties or 
their duly authorized agents to appear before it for a conference to consider: 
 

 

(a) 

All pending dilatory pleas, motions and exceptions; 

(b) 

The necessity or desirability of amendments to the pleadings;

The exchange of a list of direct fact witnesses, other than rebuttal or impeaching 
witnesses the necessity of whose testimony cannot reasonably be anticipated before 
the  time  of  trial,  who  will  be  called  to  testify  at  trial,  stating  their  address  and 
telephone number, and the subject of the testimony of each such witness; 

The  exchange  of  a  list  of  expert  witnesses  who  will  be  called  to  testify  at  trial, 
stating their address and telephone number, and the subject of the testimony and

stipulation to the authenticity and admissibility of exhibits to be used at trial; 

(m)  Written trial objections to the opposite party's exhibits, stating the basis for each 

objection; 

The  advisability  of  a  preliminary  reference  of  issues  to  a  master  or  auditor  for

amendments  allowed  to  the  pleadings,  the  time  within  which  same  may  be  filed,  and  the 
agreements made by the parties as to any of the matters considered, and which limits the issues for 
trial to those not disposed of by admissions, agreements of counsel, or rulings of the court; and 
such order when issued shall control the subsequent course of the action, unless modified at the 
trial  to  prevent  manifest  injustice.  The  court  in  its  discretion  may  establish  by  rule  a  pretrial 
calendar  on  which  actions  may  be  placed  for  consideration  as  above  provided  and  may  either 
confine the calendar to jury actions or extend it to all actions. 

retrial proceedings in multidistrict litigation may also be governed by Rules 11 and 13 of the 

Rules of Judicial Administration. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1990 change: To broaden the scope of the rule and to confirm the ability of 

the trial courts at pretrial hearings to encourage settlement. 
 

RULE 166a.    SUMMARY JUDGMENT 
 

For Claimant.    A party seeking to recover upon a claim, counterclaim, or cross-claim or 
to obtain a declaratory judgment may, at any time after the adverse party has appeared or 
answered, move with or without supporting affidavits for a summary judgment in his favor 
upon  all  or  any  part  thereof.  A  summary  judgment,  interlocutory  in  character,  may  be 
rendered on the issue of liability alone although there is a genuine issue as to amount of 
damages. 

For  Defending  Party.    A  party  against  whom  a  claim,  counterclaim,  or  cross-claim  is 
asserted  or  a  declaratory  judgment  is  sought  may,  at  any  time,  move  with  or  without 

Page  86 

 

 

 

 

 

  P

   

(a) 

b) 

  (

 

supporting affidavits for a summary judgment in his favor as to all or any part thereof. 

c)  Motion and Proceedings Thereon.    The motion for summary judgment shall state the 
specific grounds therefor. Except on leave of court, with notice to opposing counsel, the 
motion  and any  supporting  affidavits  shall  be  filed  and  served  at  least twenty-one  days 
before the time specified for hearing. Except on leave of court, the adverse party, not later 
than seven days prior to the day of hearing may file and serve opposing affidavits or other 
written response. No oral testimony shall be received at the hearing. The judgment sought 
shall be rendered forthwith if (i) the deposition transcripts, interrogatory answers, and other 
discovery responses referenced or set forth in the motion or response, and (ii) the pleadings, 
admissions,  affidavits,  stipulations  of  the  parties,  and  authenticated  or  certified  public 
records, if any, on file at the time of the hearing, or filed thereafter and before judgment 
with permission of the court, show that, except as to the amount of damages, there is no 
genuine  issue  as  to  any  material  fact  and  the  moving  party  is  entitled  to  judgment  as  a 
matter of law on the issues expressly set out in the motion or in an answer or any other 
response.  Issues  not  expressly  presented  to  the  trial  court  by  written  motion,  answer  or 
other  response  shall  not  be  considered  on  appeal  as  grounds  for  reversal.  A  summary 
judgment may be based on uncontroverted testimonial evidence of an interested witness, 
or  of  an  expert  witness  as  to  subject  matter  concerning  which  the  trier  of  fact  must  be 
guided solely by the opinion testimony of experts, if the evidence is clear, positive and 
direct, otherwise credible and free from contradictions and inconsistencies, and could have 
been readily controverted. 

Appendices,  References  and  Other  Use  of  Discovery  Not  Otherwise  on  File.   
Discovery products not on file with the clerk may be used as summary judgment evidence 
if copies of the material, appendices containing the evidence, or a notice containing specific 
references to the discovery or specific references to other instruments, are filed and served 
on all parties together with a statement of intent to use the specified discovery as summary 
judgment proofs: (i) at least twenty-one days before the hearing if such proofs are to be 
used to support the summary judgment; or (ii) at least seven days before the hearing if such 
proofs are to be used to oppose the summary judgment. 

Case Not Fully Adjudicated on Motion.    If summary judgment is not rendered upon the 
whole case or for all the relief asked and a trial is necessary, the judge may at the hearing 
examine the pleadings and the evidence on file, interrogate counsel, ascertain what material 
fact issues exist and make an order specifying the facts that are established as a matter of 
law, and directing such further proceedings in the action as are just. 

Form of Affidavits; Further Testimony.    Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be 
made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, 
and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated 
therein. Sworn or certified copies of all papers or parts thereof referred to in an affidavit 
shall  be  attached  thereto  or  served  therewith.  The  court  may  permit  affidavits  to  be 
supplemented or opposed by depositions or by further affidavits. Defects in the form of 
affidavits or attachments will not be grounds for reversal unless specifically pointed out by 
objection by an opposing party with opportunity, but refusal, to amend.

g)  When  Affidavits  Are  Unavailable.    Should  it  appear  from  the  affidavits  of  a  party 
opposing the motion that he cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to 
justify his opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a 
continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to 
be had or may make such other order as is just. 

Affidavits Made in Bad Faith.    Should it appear to the satisfaction of the court at any 
time that any of the affidavits presented pursuant to this rule are presented in bad faith or 
solely for the purpose of delay, the court shall forthwith order the party employing them to 
pay  to  the  other  party  the  amount  of  the  reasonable  expenses  which  the  filing  of  the 
affidavits caused him to incur, including reasonable attorney's fees, and any offending party 
or attorney may be adjudged guilty of contempt. 

No-Evidence  Motion.    After  adequate  time  for  discovery,  a  party  without  presenting 
summary judgment evidence may move for summary judgment on the ground that there is 
no evidence of one or more essential elements of a claim or defense on which an adverse 
party would have the burden of proof at trial. The motion must state the elements as to 
which there is no evidence. The court must grant the motion unless the respondent produces 
summary judgment evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact. 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1990 change: This amendment provides a mechanism for using previously 
non-filed discovery in summary judgment practice. Such proofs must all be filed in advance of the 
hearing in accordance with Rule 166a. Paragraphs (d) through (g) are renumbered (e) through (h).   
 

Comment  to  1997  change:  This  comment  is  intended  to  inform  the  construction  and 
application  of  the  rule.  Paragraph  (i)  authorizes  a  motion  for  summary  judgment  based  on  the 
assertion that, after adequate opportunity for discovery, there is no evidence to support one or more 
specified elements of an adverse party’s claim or defense. A discovery period set by pretrial order 
should  be  adequate  opportunity  for  discovery  unless  there  is  a  showing  to  the  contrary,  and 
ordinarily a motion under paragraph (i) would be permitted after the period but not before. The 
motion must be specific in challenging the evidentiary support for an element of a claim or defense; 
paragraph  (i)  does  not  authorize  conclusory  motions  or  general  no-evidence  challenges  to  an 
opponent’s case. Paragraph (i) does not apply to ordinary motions for summary judgment under 
paragraphs (a) or (b), in which the movant must prove it is entitled to judgment by establishing 
each  element  of  its  own  claim  or  defense  as  a  matter  of  law  or  by  negating  an  element  of  the 
respondent’s claim or defense as a matter of law. To defeat a motion made under paragraph (i), 
the respondent is not required to marshal its proof; its response need only point out evidence that 
raises a fact issue on the challenged elements. The existing rules continue to govern the general 
requirements of summary judgment practice. A motion under paragraph (i) is subject to sanctions 
provided by existing law (Tex Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §§ 9.001-10.006) and rule (Tex R. Civ. P. 
13). The denial of a motion under paragraph (i) is no more reviewable by appeal or mandamus 
than the denial of a motion under paragraph (c).

[RULE 166c.    Repealed effective January 1, 1999] 

   

   

RULE 167.    OFFER OF SETTLEMENT; AWARD OF LITIGATION COSTS 
 

ertain litigation costs may be awarded against a party who rejects an offer made substantially in 
accordance  with  this  rule  to  settle  a  claim  for  monetary  damages  -  including  a  counterclaim, 
crossclaim, or third-party claim - except in:   
 

167.1.    Generally. 

  C

(a) 

a class action; 

(b) 

a shareholder's derivative action; 

(c) 

an  action  by  or  against  the  State,  a  unit  of  state  government,  or  a  political 
subdivision of the State; 

(d) 

an action brought under the Family Code; 

(e) 

an action to collect workers' compensation benefits under title 5, subtitle A of the 
Labor Code; or 

(f) 

an action filed in a justice of the peace court or small claims court. 

Defendant's declaration a prerequisite; deadline. A settlement offer under this rule may 
not be made until a defendant -- a party against whom a claim for monetary damages is 
made -- files a declaration invoking this rule. When a defendant files such a declaration, an 
offer or offers may be made under this rule to settle only those claims by and against that 
defendant. The declaration must be filed no later than 45 days before the case is set for 
conventional trial on the merits. 

67.2.   Settlement Offer 

a) 

  1

  (

b) 

Requirements of an offer. A settlement offer must: 

(1) 

be in writing; 

(2) 

state that it is made under Rule 167 and Chapter 42 of the Texas Civil Practice and 
Remedies Code; 

(3) 

identify the party or parties making the offer and the party or parties to whom the 

Page  89 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  (

 

 

 

 

offer is made; 

(4) 

state the terms by which all monetary claims - including any attorney fees, interest, 
and costs that would be recoverable up to the time of the offer - between the offeror 
or offerors on the one hand and the offeree or offerees on the other may be settled; 

(5) 

state a deadline - no sooner than 14 days after the offer is served - by which the 
offer must be accepted; 

(6) 

be served on all parties to whom the offer is made. 

c)    Conditions of offer. An offer may be made subject to reasonable conditions, including the 
execution of appropriate releases, indemnities, and other documents. An offeree may object 
to a condition by written notice served on the offeror before the deadline stated in the offer. 
A  condition  to  which  no  such  objection  is  made  is  presumed  to  have  been  reasonable. 
Rejection of an offer made subject to a condition determined by the trial court to have been 
unreasonable cannot be the basis for an award of litigation costs under this rule. 

d) 

Non-monetary and excepted claims not included.    An offer must not include non-monetary 
claims and other claims to which this rule does not apply. 

e) 

Time limitations. An offer may not be made: 

(1) 

before a defendant's declaration is filed; 

(2) 

(3) 

within 60 days after the appearance in the case of the offeror or offeree, whichever 
is later; 

within 14 days before the date the case is set for a conventional trial on the merits, 
except that an offer may be made within that period if it is in response to, and within 
seven days of, a prior offer. 

Successive offers.    A party may make an offer after having made or rejected a prior offer. 
A rejection of an offer is subject to imposition of litigation costs under this rule only if the 
offer is more favorable to the offeree than any prior offer. 

67.3.  Withdrawal, Acceptance, and Rejection of Offer 

a)  Withdrawal  of  offer.    An  offer  can  be  withdrawn  before  it  is  accepted.  Withdrawal  is 
effective  when  written  notice  of  the  withdrawal  is  served  on  the  offeree.  Once  an 
unaccepted offer has been withdrawn, it cannot be accepted or be the basis for awarding 
litigation costs under this rule. 

Acceptance of offer.    An offer that has not been withdrawn can be accepted only by written 
notice served on the offeror by the deadline stated in the offer. When an offer is accepted, 
the offeror or offeree may file the offer and acceptance and may move the court to enforce

the settlement. 

Rejection of offer.    An offer that is not withdrawn or accepted is rejected. An offer may 
also be rejected by written notice served on the offeror by the deadline stated in the offer. 

Objection  to  offer  made  before  an  offeror's  joinder  or  designation  of  responsible  third 
party.    An  offer  made before  an  offeror  joins  another  party  or  designates  a  responsible 
third  party may  not  be the  basis for  awarding  litigation  costs  under  this  rule  against  an 
offeree  who  files  an  objection  to  the  offer  within  15  days  after  service  of  the  offeror's 
pleading or designation. 

67.4.  Awarding Litigation Costs 

Generally.    If a settlement offer made under this rule is rejected, and the judgment to be 
awarded on the monetary claims covered by the offer is significantly less favorable to the 
offeree  than  was  the  offer,  the  court  must  award  the  offeror  litigation  costs  against  the 
offeree from the time the offer was rejected to the time of judgment. 

b) 

Significantly  less  favorable@  defined.    A  judgment  award  on  monetary  claims  is 
significantly less favorable than an offer to settle those claims if: 

(1) 

(2) 

the  offeree  is  a  claimant  and the judgment  would  be less  than  80  percent  of  the 
offer; or 

the offeree is a defendant and the judgment would be more than 120 percent of the 
offer. 

c) 

Litigation costs.    Litigation costs are the expenditures actually made and the obligations 
actually incurred - directly in relation to the claims covered by a settlement offer under this 
rule - for the following: 

(1) 

court costs; 

(2) 

reasonable deposition costs, in cases filed on or after September 1, 2011;   

(3) 

reasonable fees for not more than two testifying expert witnesses; and 

(4) 

reasonable attorney fees. 

d) 

Limits on litigation costs.    The litigation costs that may be awarded under this rule must 
not exceed the following amount: 

(1) 

In cases filed before September 1, 2011, litigation costs that may be awarded under 
this rule must not exceed the following amount: 

(A) 

the sum of the noneconomic damages, the exemplary or additional damages, 

c) 

d) 

  (

  (

a)

  (

Page  91 

and one-half of the economic damages to be awarded to the claimant in the 
judgment; minus 

(B) 

the  amount  of  any  statutory  or  contractual  liens  in  connection  with  the 
occurrences or incidents giving rise to the claim. 

In cases files on or after September 1, 2011, the litigation costs that may be awarded 
to  any  party  under  this  rule  must  not  exceed  the  total  amount  that  the  claimant 
recovers or would recover before adding an award of litigation costs under this rule 
in favor of the claimant or subtracting as an offset an award of litigation costs under 
this rule in favor of the defendant. 

2) 

  (

No double recovery permitted.    A party who is entitled to recover attorney fees and costs 
under another law may not recover those same attorney fees and costs as litigation costs 
under this rule. 

Limitation on attorney fees and costs recovered by a party against whom litigation costs 
are awarded.    A party against whom litigation costs are awarded may not recover attorney 
fees and costs under another law incurred after the date the party rejected the settlement 
offer made the basis of the award. 

g) 

Litigation  costs  to  be  awarded  to  defendant  as  a  setoff.    Litigation  costs  awarded  to  a 
defendant must be made a setoff to the claimant's judgment against the defendant. 

67.5.  Procedures 

a)  Modification of time limits.    On motion, and for good cause shown, the court may -- by 
written order made before commencement of trial on the merits -- modify the time limits 
for filing a declaration under Rule 167.2(a) or for making an offer. 

Discovery  permitted.    On  motion,  and  for  good  cause  shown,  a  party  against  whom 
litigation costs are to be awarded may conduct discovery to ascertain the reasonableness of 
the costs requested. If the court determines the costs to be reasonable, it must order the 
party requesting discovery to pay all attorney fees and expenses incurred by other parties 
in responding to such discovery. 

Hearing required.    The court must, upon request, conduct a hearing on a request for an 
award of litigation costs, at which the affected parties may present evidence. 

67.6.  Evidence Not Admissible 

vidence  relating  to  an  offer  made  under  this  rule  is  not  admissible  except  for  purposes  of 
enforcing a settlement agreement or obtaining litigation costs. The provisions of this rule may not 
be made known to the jury by any means.

167.7.  Other Settlement Offers Not Affected   

his rule does not apply to any offer made in a mediation or arbitration proceeding. A settlement 
offer not made in compliance with this rule, or a settlement offer not made under this rule, or made 
in an action to which this rule does not apply, cannot be the basis for awarding litigation costs 
under this rule as to any party. This rule does not limit or affect a party's right to make a settlement 
offer that does not comply with this rule, or in an action to which this rule does not apply. 

[RULE 167a.    Repealed effective January 1, 1999] 
 

RULE 168.    PERMISSION TO APPEAL 
 
On  a  party’s  motion  or  on  its  own  initiative,  a  trial  court  may  permit  an  appeal  from  an 
interlocutory order that is not otherwise appealable, as provided by statute.    Permission must be 
stated in the order to be appealed.    An order previously issued may be amended to include such 
permission.    The permission must identify the controlling question of law as to which there is a 
substantial  ground  for  difference  of  opinion,  and  must  state  why  an  immediate  appeal  may 
materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment  to  2011  change: Rule 168 is a  new rule,  added  to implement amendments to 
section 51.014(d)-(f) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Rule 168 applies only to 
cases filed on or after September 1, 2011. Rule 168 clarifies that the trial court’s permission to 
appeal  should  be  included  in  the  order  to  be  appealed  rather  than  in  a  separate  order.  Rule  of 
Appellate Procedure 28.3 sets out the corollary requirements for permissive appeals in the courts 
of appeals. 

 

RULE 169.    EXPEDITED ACTIONS 
 
Application. The expedited actions process in this rule applies to a suit in which all 
claimants, other than counter-claimants, affirmatively plead that they seek only monetary 
relief aggregating $250,000 or less, excluding interest, statutory or punitive damages and 
penalties, and attorney fees and costs. 

Recovery.    In  no  event  may  a  party  who  prosecutes  a  suit  under  this  rule  recover  a 
judgment  in  excess  of  $250,000,  excluding  interest,  statutory  or  punitive  damages  and 
penalties, and attorney fees and costs. 

c) 

Removal from Process. 

(1) 

A court must remove a suit from the expedited actions process: 

(A) 

on motion and a showing of good cause by any party; or 

  T

   

   

  (

(B) 

if  any  claimant,  other  than  a  counter-claimant,  files  a  pleading  or  an 
amended  or  supplemental  pleading  that  seeks  any  relief  other  than  the 
monetary relief allowed by (a). 

A pleading, amended pleading, or supplemental pleading that removes a suit from 
the expedited actions process may not be filed without leave of court unless it is 
filed before the earlier of 30 days after the discovery period is closed or 30 days 
before the date set for trial.    Leave to amend may be granted only if good cause for 
filing the pleading outweighs any prejudice to an opposing party. 

(3) 

If  a  suit  is  removed  from  the  expedited  actions  process,  the  court  must  reopen 
discovery under Rule 190.2(c). 

d) 

Expedited Actions Process. 

(1) 

Discovery.    Discovery is governed by Rule 190.2. 

Trial Setting; Continuances.    On any party’s request, the court must set the case 
for a trial date that is within 90 days after the discovery period in Rule 190.2(b)(1) 
ends.    The court may continue the case twice, not to exceed a total of 60 days. 

Time Limits for Trial.    Each side is allowed no more than eight hours to complete 
jury  selection,  opening  statements,  presentation  of  evidence,  examination  and 
cross-examination of witnesses, and closing arguments.    On motion and a showing 
of good cause by any party, the court may extend the time limit to no more than 
twelve hours per side. 

(A) 

The term “side” has the same definition set out in Rule 233. 

(B) 

Time  spent  on  objections,  bench  conferences,  bills  of  exception,  and 
challenges for cause to a juror under Rule 228 are not included in the time 
limit. 

(4) 

Alternative Dispute Resolution. 

(A)  Unless  the  parties  have  agreed  not  to  engage  in  alternative  dispute 
resolution, the court may refer the case to an alternative dispute resolution 
procedure once, and the procedure must: 

(i) 

not exceed a half-day in duration, excluding scheduling time; 

(ii) 

not exceed a total cost of twice the amount of applicable civil filing 
fees; and 

(iii) 

be completed no later than 60 days before the initial trial setting.

(B) 

(C) 

The  court  must  consider  objections  to  the  referral  unless  prohibited  by 
statute. 

The parties may agree to engage in alternative dispute resolution other than   
that provided for in (A). 

(5) 

Expert Testimony.    Unless requested by the party sponsoring the expert, a party 
may  only  challenge  the  admissibility  of  expert  testimony  as  an  objection  to 
summary  judgment  evidence  under  Rule  166a  or  during  the  trial  on  the  merits.   
This paragraph does not apply to a motion to strike for late designation. 

omment to 2013 change:   

Notes and Comments 

1. 

Rule 169 is a new rule implementing section 22.004(h) of the Texas Government 
Code,  which  was  added  in  2011  and  calls for rules  to  promote  the  prompt, efficient,  and  cost-
effective resolution of civil actions when the amount in controversy does not exceed $100,000. 
 

2. 

The expedited actions process created by Rule 169 is mandatory; any suit that falls 

within the definition of 169(a)(1) is subject to the provisions of the rule. 
 

3. 

In determining whether there is good cause to remove the case from the process or 
extend the time limit for trial, the court should consider factors such as whether the damages sought 
by multiple claimants against the same defendant exceed in the aggregate the relief allowed under 
169(a)(1), whether a defendant has filed a compulsory counterclaim in good faith that seeks relief 
other than that allowed under 169(a)(1), the number of parties and witnesses, the complexity of 
the legal and factual issues, and whether an interpreter is necessary. 
 

4. 

Rule  169(b)  specifies  that  a  party  who  prosecutes  a  suit  under  this  rule  cannot 
recover a judgment in excess of $100,000.    Thus, the rule in Greenhalgh v. Service Lloyds Ins. 
Co., 787 S.W.2d 938 (Tex. 1990), does not apply if a jury awards damages in excess of $100,000 
to the party.    The limitation of 169(b) does not apply to a counter-claimant that seeks relief other 
than that allowed under 169(a)(1). 
 

5. 

The discovery limitations for expedited actions are set out in Rule 190.2, which is 

also amended to implement section 22.004(h) of the Texas Government Code. 

omment to 2021 change: 

Rule 169 is amended to implement section 22.004(h-1) of Texas Government Code–which 
calls for rules to promote the prompt, efficient, and cost-effective resolution of civil actions filed 
in county courts at law in which the amount in controversy does not exceed $250,000–and changes 
to section 22.004(h) of the Texas Government code. To ensure uniformity, and pursuant to section 
22.004(b) of the Texas Government Code, Rule 169’s application is not limited to suits filed in 

Page  95 

 

 

 

 

  C

 

  C

   

 

county courts at law;  any  suit  that  falls within the definition of subsection (a) is subject to the 
provisions of the rule. However, certain suits are exempt from Rule 169’s application by statute. 
See,  e.g.,  TEX.  ESTATES  CODE  §§  53.107,  1053.105.  The  discovery  limitations  for  expedited 
actions are set out in Rule 190.2, which is also amended to implement section 22.004(h-1) of the 
Texas Government Code.   

[RULE 170.    Repealed effective April 1, 1984] 
 

RULE 171.    MASTER IN CHANCERY 

he court may, in exceptional cases, for good cause appoint a master in chancery, who shall be a 
citizen of this State, and not an attorney for either party to the action, nor related to either party, 
who shall perform all of the duties required of him by the court, and shall be under orders of the 
court, and have such power as the master of chancery has in a court of equity. 

he order of references to the master may specify or limit his powers, and may direct him to report 
only upon particular issues, or to do or perform particular acts, or to receive and report evidence 
only and may fix the time and place for beginning and closing the hearings, and for the filing of 
the master's report. Subject to the limitations and specifications stated in the order, the master has 
and shall exercise the power to regulate all proceedings in every hearing before him and to do all 
acts and take all measures necessary or proper for the efficient performance of his duties under the 
order. He may require the production before him of evidence upon all matters embraced in the 
reference,  including  the  production  of  books,  papers,  vouchers,  documents  and  other  writings 
applicable thereto. He may rule upon the admissibility of evidence, unless otherwise directed by 
the order of reference and has the authority to put witnesses on oath, and may, himself, examine 
them, and may call the parties to the action and examine them upon oath. When a party so requests, 
the  master  shall  make  a  record  of  the  evidence  offered  and  excluded  in  the  same  manner  as 
provided for a court sitting in the trial of a case. 

he clerk of the court shall forthwith furnish the master with a copy of the order of reference. 

he parties may procure the attendance of witnesses before the master by the issuance and service 

of process as provided by law and these rules. 

he court may confirm, modify, correct, reject, reverse or recommit the report, after it is filed, as 
the court may deem proper and necessary in the particular circumstances of the case. The court 
shall award reasonable compensation to such master to be taxed as costs of suit. 
 

RULE 172.    AUDIT 
 
When an investigation of accounts or examination of vouchers appears necessary for the purpose 
of justice between the parties to any suit, the court shall appoint an auditor or auditors to state the 
accounts  between  the  parties  and  to  make  report  thereof  to  the  court  as  soon  as  possible.  The 
auditor shall verify his report by his affidavit stating that he has carefully examined the state of the 

Page  96 

   

  T

  T

  T

 

account between the parties, and that his report contains a true statement thereof, so far as the same 
has come within his knowledge. Exceptions to such report or of any item thereof must be filed 
within 30 days of the filing of such report. The court shall award reasonable compensation to such 
auditor to be taxed as costs of suit. 
 

173.1.    Appointment Governed by Statute or Other Rules 

RULE 173.    GUARDIAN AD LITEM

rules. 
 
173.2.    Appointment of Guardian ad Litem 

 

a)  When Appointment Required or Prohibited.    The court must appoint a guardian ad litem 

for a party represented by a next friend or guardian only if: 

(1) 

the next friend or guardian appears to the court to have an interest adverse to the 
party; or 

(2) 

the parties agree. 

b)

guardian ad litem for similarly situated parties unless the court finds that the appointment 
of different guardians ad litem is necessary. 

73.3.    Procedure 

a)  Motion Permitted But Not Required.    The court may appoint a guardian ad litem on the 

motion of any party or on its own initiative. 

b)  Written Order Required.    An appointment must be made by written order. 

c) 

Objections.    Any party may object to the appointment of a guardian ad litem.

Determination of Adverse Interest.    A guardian ad litem must determine and advise the 
court whether a party’s next friend or guardian has an interest adverse to the party. 

c)  When Settlement Proposed.    When an offer has been made to settle the claim of a party

Participation in Litigation Limited.    A guardian ad litem: 

(1) 

(2) 

may  participate  in  mediation  or  a  similar  proceeding  to  attempt  to  reach  a 
settlement; 

must participate in any proceeding before the court whose purpose is to determine 
whether a party’s next friend or guardian has an interest adverse to the party, or 
whether a settlement of the party’s claim is in the party’s best interest; 

(3) 

must not participate in discovery, trial, or any other part of the litigation unless: 

(A) 

(B) 

further  participation  is  necessary  to  protect  the  party’s  interest  that  is 
adverse to the next friend’s or guardian’s, and 

the participation is directed by the court in a written order stating sufficient 
reasons. 

ommunications between the guardian ad litem and the party, the next friend or guardian, or their 

attorney are privileged as if the guardian ad litem were the attorney for the party.

reasonable and necessary expenses incurred and may be paid a reasonable hourly fee for 
necessary services performed. 

Procedure.    At  the  conclusion  of  the  appointment,  a  guardian  ad  litem  may  file  an 
application for compensation. The application must be verified and must detail the basis 
for the compensation requested. Unless all parties agree to the application, the court must 
conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine the total amount of fees and expenses that are 
reasonable  and  necessary.  In  making  this  determination,  the  court  must  not  consider 
compensation as a percentage of any judgment or settlement. 

Taxation  as  Costs.    The  court  may  tax  a  guardian  ad  litem’s  compensation  as  costs  of 
court. 

Other  Benefit  Prohibited.    A  guardian  ad  litem  may  not  receive,  directly  or  indirectly, 
anything of value in consideration of the appointment other than as provided by this rule. 

73.7.    Review 

Right of Appeal.    Any party may seek mandamus review of an order appointing a guardian 
ad litem or directing a guardian ad litem=s participation in the litigation.    Any party and a

Severance.    On motion of the guardian  ad  litem  or  any  party, the  court must  sever any 
order awarding a guardian ad litem compensation to create a final, appealable order. 

No Effect on Finality of Settlement or Judgment.    Appellate proceedings to review an order 
pertaining to a guardian ad litem do not affect the finality of a settlement or judgment. 

. 

This  rule  does  not  apply  when  the  procedures  and  purposes  for  appointment  of 
guardians ad litem (as well as attorneys ad litem) are prescribed by statutes, such as the Family 
Code and the Probate Code, or by other rules, such as the Parental Notification Rules.   

. 

The rule contemplates that a guardian ad litem will be appointed when a party’s 
next friend or guardian appears to have an interest adverse to the party because of the division of 
settlement proceeds. In those situations, the responsibility of the guardian ad litem as prescribed 
by  the  rule  is  very  limited,  and  no  reason  exists  for  the  guardian  ad  litem  to  participate  in  the 
conduct of the litigation in any other way or to review the discovery or the litigation file except to 
the limited extent that it may bear on the division of settlement proceeds. See Jocson v. Crabb, 
133 S.W.3d 268 (Tex. 2004) (per curiam). A guardian ad litem may, of course, choose to review 
the  file  or  attend  proceedings  when  it  is  unnecessary,  but  the  guardian  ad  litem  may  not  be 
compensated for unnecessary expenses or services.   

. 

Only in extraordinary circumstances does the rule contemplate that a guardian ad 
litem will have a broader role. Even then, the role is limited to determining whether a party’s next 
friend or guardian has an interest adverse to the party that should be considered by the court under 
Rule 44. In no event may a guardian ad litem supervise or supplant the next friend or undertake to 
represent the party while serving as guardian ad litem.   

. 
judicial immunity. 

As  an  officer  and  advisor  to  the  court,  a  guardian  ad  litem  should  have  derived 

.   

Though an officer and adviser to the court, a guardian ad litem must not have ex 

parte communications with the court. See Tex. Code of Jud. Conduct, Canon 3. 

.   

Because the role of guardian ad litem is limited in all but extraordinary situations, 
and  any  risk  that  might result  from  services  performed  is  also  limited,  compensation,  if  any  is 
sought, should ordinarily be limited. 

A violation of this rule is subject to appropriate sanction.

RULE 174.    CONSOLIDATION; SEPARATE TRIALS 
 

Consolidation.    When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending 
before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the 
actions; it may order all the actions consolidated; and it may make such orders concerning 
proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay. 

Separate Trials.    The court in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice may order 
a  separate  trial  of  any  claim,  cross-claim,  counterclaim,  or  third-party  claim,  or  of  any 
separate issue or of any number of claims, cross-claims, counterclaims, third-party claims, 
or issues.

RULE 175.    ISSUE OF LAW AND DILATORY PLEAS 
 
When a case is called for trial in which there has been no pretrial hearing as provided by Rule 166, 
the issues of law arising on the pleadings, all pleas in abatement and other dilatory pleas remaining 
undisposed of shall be determined; and it shall be no cause for postponement of a trial of the issues 
of law that a party is not prepared to try the issues of fact. 
 

Section 9.    Evidence and Discovery 
 
A.    EVIDENCE

(a) 

attend and give testimony at a deposition, hearing, or trial; 

(b) 

produce and permit inspection and copying of designated documents or tangible 
things in the possession, custody, or control of that person. 

76.3  Limitations. 

Range.    A person may not be required by subpoena to appear or produce documents or 
other things in a county that is more than 150 miles from where the person resides or is 
served.  However,  a  person  whose  appearance  or  production  at  a  deposition  may  be 
compelled  by  notice  alone  under  Rules  199.3  or  200.2  may  be  required  to  appear  and 
produce documents or other things at any location permitted under Rules 199.2(b)(2). 

Use for discovery.    A subpoena may not be used for discovery to an extent, in a manner, 
or at a time other than as provided by the rules governing discovery. 

76.4  Who May Issue. 

 subpoena may be issued by: 

 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

the clerk of the appropriate district, county, or justice court, who must provide the 
party requesting the subpoena with an original and a copy for each witness to be 
completed by the party; 

an attorney authorized to practice in the State of Texas, as an officer of the court; 
or 

an officer authorized to take depositions in this State, who must issue the subpoena 
immediately on a request accompanied by a notice to take a deposition under Rules 
199 or 200, or a notice under Rule 205.3, and who may also serve the notice with 
the subpoena. 

76.5  Service. 

a)  Manner of service.    A subpoena may be served at any place within the State of Texas by 
any sheriff or constable of the State of Texas, or any person who is not a party and is 18 
years of age or older. A subpoena must be served by delivering a copy to the witness and 
tendering to that person any fees required by law. If the witness is a party and is represented

by an attorney of record in the proceeding, the subpoena may be served on the witness's 
attorney of record. 

b) 

Proof of service.    Proof of service must be made by filing either: 

the witness's signed written memorandum attached to the subpoena showing that 
the witness accepted the subpoena; or 

a statement by the person who made the service stating the date, time, and manner 
of service, and the name of the person served. 

(1) 

(2) 

76.6  Response. 

Compliance  required.    Except  as  provided  in this  subdivision,  a  person  served  with  a 
subpoena must comply with the command stated therein unless discharged by the court or 
by the party summoning such witness. A person commanded to appear and give testimony 
must remain at the place of deposition, hearing, or trial from day to day until discharged 
by the court or by the party summoning the witness. 

Organizations.    If  a  subpoena  commanding  testimony  is  directed  to  a  corporation, 
partnership, association, governmental agency, or other organization, and the matters on 
which  examination  is  requested  are  described  with  reasonable  particularity,  the 
organization must designate one or more persons to testify on its behalf as to matters known 
or reasonably available to the organization. 

Production  of  documents  or  tangible  things.    A  person  commanded  to  produce 
documents or tangible things need not appear in person at the time and place of production 
unless  the  person  is  also  commanded  to  attend  and  give  testimony,  either  in  the  same 
subpoena or a separate one. A person must produce documents as they are kept in the usual 
course of business or must organize and label them to correspond with the categories in the 
demand. A person may withhold material or information claimed to be privileged but must 
comply  with  Rule  193.3.  A  nonparty's  production  of  a  document  authenticates  the 
document  for  use  against  the  nonparty  to  the  same  extent  as  a  party's  production  of  a 
document is authenticated for use against the party under Rule 193.7. 

Objections.    A  person  commanded  to  produce  and  permit  inspection  or  copying  of 
designated  documents  and  things  may  serve  on  the  party  requesting  issuance  of  the 
subpoena - before the time specified for compliance - written objections to producing any 
or all of the designated materials. A person need not comply with the part of a subpoena to 
which objection is made as provided in this paragraph unless ordered to do so by the court. 
The  party  requesting  the  subpoena  may  move  for  such  an  order  at  any  time  after  an 
objection is made. 

Protective orders.    A person commanded to appear at a deposition, hearing, or trial, or to 
produce and permit inspection and copying of designated documents and things, and any 
other  person  affected  by  the  subpoena,  may  move  for  a  protective  order  under  Rule

192.6(b)--before the time specified for compliance--either in the court in which the action 
is pending or in a district court in the county where the subpoena was served. The person 
must serve the motion on all parties in accordance with Rule 21a. A person need not comply 
with the part of a subpoena from which protection is sought under this paragraph unless 
ordered to do so by the court. The party requesting the subpoena may seek such an order 
at any time after the motion for protection is filed. 

Trial  subpoenas.    A  person  commanded  to  attend  and  give  testimony,  or  to  produce 
documents or things, at a hearing or trial, may object or move for protective order before 
the court at the time and place specified for compliance, rather than under paragraphs (d) 
and (e). 

76.7  Protection of Person from Undue Burden and Expense.     

 party causing a subpoena to issue must take reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden 
or expense on the person served. In ruling on objections or motions for protection, the court must 
provide  a  person  served  with  a  subpoena  an  adequate  time  for  compliance,  protection  from 
disclosure of privileged material or information, and protection from undue burden or expense. 
The  court  may  impose  reasonable  conditions  on  compliance  with  a  subpoena,  including 
compensating the witness for undue hardship. 

76.8  Enforcement of Subpoena. 

Contempt.    Failure by any person without adequate excuse to  obey a subpoena  served 
upon that person may be deemed a contempt of the court from which the subpoena is issued 
or a district court in the county in which the subpoena is served, and may be punished by 
fine or confinement, or both. 

Proof of payment of fees required for fine or attachment.    A fine may not be imposed, 
nor  a  person  served  with  a  subpoena  attached,  for  failure  to  comply  with  a  subpoena 
without proof by affidavit of the party requesting the subpoena or the party's attorney of 
record that all fees due the witness by law were paid or tendered. 

1. 

This rule combines the former rules governing subpoenas for trial and discovery. 
When a subpoena is used for discovery, the protections from undue burden and expense apply, just 
as with any discovery.   

. 

Rule 176.3(b) prohibits the use of a subpoena to circumvent the discovery rules. 
Thus, for example, a deposition subpoena to a party is subject to the procedures of Rules 196, 199, 
and 200, and a deposition subpoena to a nonparty is subject to the procedures of Rule 205.

conducted under Level 1, 2, or 3 of this Rule.

(Level 1) 

Page  105 

   

  E

  1

 
 

 

(a) 
 

Application.    This subdivision applies to: 

(1) 

any suit that is governed by the expedited actions process in Rule 169; and 

unless the parties agree that rule 190.3 should apply or the court orders a discovery 
control plan under Rule 190.4, any suit for divorce not involving children in which 
a party pleads that the value of the marital estate is more than zero but not more 
than $250,000. 

(b) 

 
Limitations.    Discovery is subject to the limitations provided elsewhere in these rules and 
to the following additional limitations: 

Discovery period.    All discovery must be conducted during the discovery period, 
which begins when the first initial disclosures are due and continues for 180 days. 

Total time for oral depositions.    Each party may have no more than 20 hours in 
total to examine and cross-examine all witnesses in oral depositions. The court may 
modify the deposition hours so that no party is given unfair advantage. 

Interrogatories.    Any party may serve on any other party no more than 15 written 
interrogatories,  excluding  interrogatories  asking  a  party  only  to  identify  or 
authenticate  specific  documents.  Each  discrete  subpart  of  an  interrogatory  is 
considered a separate interrogatory. 

Requests for Production.    Any party may serve on any other party no more than 
15  written  requests  for  production.    Each  discrete  subpart  of  a  request  for 
production is considered a separate request for production. 

Requests for Admissions.    Any party may serve on any other party no more than 
15  written  requests  for  admissions.    Each  discrete  subpart  of  a  request  for 
admission is considered a separate request for admission. 

Reopening Discovery.    If a suit is removed from the expedited actions process in Rule 
169 or, in a divorce, the filing of a pleading renders this subdivision no longer applicable, 
the  discovery  period  reopens,  and  discovery  must  be  completed  within  the  limitations 
provided in Rules 190.3 or 190.4, whichever is applicable. Any person previously deposed 
may  be  redeposed.  On  motion  of  any  party,  the  court  should  continue  the  trial  date  if 
necessary to permit completion of discovery. 

90.3  Discovery Control Plan - By Rule (Level 2) 

Application.    Unless a suit is governed by a discovery control plan under Rules 190.2 or 
190.4, discovery must be conducted in accordance with this subdivision. 

Limitations.    Discovery is subject to the limitations provided elsewhere in these rules and 
to the following additional limitations:

(1) 

Discovery period.    All discovery must be conducted during the discovery period, 
which begins when the first initial disclosures are due and continues until: 

(A) 

30 days before the date set for trial, in cases under the Family Code; or 

in other cases, the earlier of 

(B) 
 

(i) 

30 days before the date set for trial, or 

(ii) 

nine months after the first initial disclosures are due. 

(2) 

Total time for oral depositions.    Each side may have no more than 50 hours in 
oral depositions to examine and cross-examine parties on the opposing side, experts 
designated by those parties, and persons who are subject to those parties' control. 
"Side" refers to all the litigants with generally common interests in the litigation. If 
one  side  designates  more  than  two  experts,  the  opposing  side  may  have  an 
additional six hours of total deposition time for each additional expert designated. 
The court may modify the deposition hours and must do so when a side or party 
would be given unfair advantage. 

(3) 

Interrogatories.    Any party may serve on any other party no more than 25 written 
interrogatories,  excluding  interrogatories  asking  a  party  only  to  identify  or 
authenticate  specific  documents.  Each  discrete  subpart  of  an  interrogatory  is 
considered a separate interrogatory. 

90.4  Discovery Control Plan - By Order (Level 3) 

Application.    The court must, on a party's motion, and may, on its own initiative, order 
that discovery be conducted in accordance with a  discovery control plan  tailored  to the 
circumstances of the specific suit. The parties may submit an agreed order to the court for 
its  consideration.  The  court  should  act  on  a  party's  motion  or  agreed  order  under  this 
subdivision as promptly as reasonably possible. 

Limitations.    The  discovery control plan  ordered  by  the  court  may  address any 
issue concerning discovery or the matters listed in Rule 166, and may change any 
limitation  on  the  time  for  or  amount  of  discovery  set  forth  in  these  rules.  The 
discovery limitations of Rule 190.2, if applicable, or otherwise of Rule 190.3 apply 
unless specifically changed in the discovery control plan ordered by the court. The 
plan must include: 

(1) 

a date for trial or for a conference to determine a trial setting; 

(2) 

a  discovery  period  during  which  either  all  discovery  must  be  conducted  or  all 
discovery requests must be sent, for the entire case or an appropriate phase of it;

(3) 

appropriate limits on the amount of discovery; and 

(4) 

deadlines for joining additional parties, amending or supplementing pleadings, and 
designating expert witnesses. 

90.5  Modification of Discovery Control Plan 

he court may modify a discovery control plan at any time and must do so when the interest of 
justice requires. Unless a suit is governed by the expedited actions process in Rule 169, the court 
must allow additional discovery: 
 

 

(a) 

related to new, amended or supplemental pleadings, or new information disclosed 
in a discovery response or in an amended or supplemental response, if: 

(1) 

the pleadings or responses were made after the deadline for completion of 
discovery or so nearly before that deadline that an adverse party does not 
have  an  adequate  opportunity  to  conduct  discovery  related  to  the  new 
matters, and 

(2) 

the  adverse  party  would  be  unfairly  prejudiced  without  such  additional 
discovery; 

 
regarding matters that have changed materially after the discovery cutoff if trial is 
set or postponed so that the trial date is more than three months after the discovery 
period ends. 

190.6  Certain Types of Discovery Excepted 

his rule's limitations on discovery do not apply to or include discovery conducted under Rule 202 
("Depositions Before Suit or to Investigate Claims"), or Rule 621a ("Discovery and Enforcement 
of Judgment"). But Rule 202 cannot be used to circumvent the limitations of this rule. 
 

Notes and Comments 

omment to 1999 change:   

1. 

This rule establishes three tiers of discovery plans and requires that every case be 
in one at all times. Whether a case is in Level 1 is determined by the pleadings. To be in Level 3, 
the court must order a specific plan for the case, either on a party’s motion or on the court’s own 
initiative. The plan may be one agreed to by the parties and submitted as an agreed order. A Level 
3 plan may simply adopt Level 1 or Level 2 restrictions. Separate Level 3 plans for phases of the 
case may be appropriate. Until a Level 3 plan is ordered, a case that is not in Level 1 is in Level 2. 
The initial pleading required by Rule 190.1 is merely to notify the court and other parties of the 
plaintiff’s intention; it does not bind the court or other parties. A plaintiff’s failure to state in the 
initial pleading that the case should be in Level 1 does not waive application of Rule 190.2. 

(b)

2. 

Rule  190.2  does  not  apply  to  suits  for  injunctive  relief  or  divorces  involving 
children. The requirement of an affirmative pleading of limited relief (e.g.: “Plaintiff affirmatively 
pleads  that  he  seeks  only  monetary  relief  aggregating  $50,000  or  less,  excluding  costs,  pre-
judgment interest and attorneys’ fees”) does not conflict with other pleading requirements, such as 
Rule 47 and Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, § 5.01. In a suit to which Rule 190.2 applies, the 
relief awarded cannot exceed the relief pleaded because the purpose of the rule, unlike Rule 47, is 
to bind the pleader to a maximum claim. Thus, the rule in Greenhalgh v. Service Lloyds Ins. Co., 
787 S.W.2d 938 (Tex. 1990), does not apply.   

. 

“Discrete subparts” of interrogatories are counted as single interrogatories, but not 
every separate factual inquiry is a discrete subpart. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(a). While not susceptible 
of precise definition, see Braden v. Downey, 811 S.W.2d 922, 972-928 (Tex. 1991), a “discrete 
subpart” is, in general, one that calls for information that is not logically or factually related to the 
primary interrogatory. The number of sets of interrogatories is no longer limited to two. 

. 

As  other  rules  make  clear,  unless  otherwise  ordered  or  agreed,  parties  seeking 
discovery must serve requests sufficiently far in advance of the end of the discovery period that 
the deadline for responding will be within the discovery period. The court may order a deadline 
for sending discovery requests in lieu of or in addition to a deadline for completing discovery.   

. 

Use  of  forms  of  discovery  other  than  depositions  and  interrogatories,  such  as 
requests for disclosure, admissions, or production of documents, are not restricted in Levels 1 and 
2. But depositions on written questions cannot be used to circumvent the limits on interrogatories.   

. 

The concept of “side” in Rule 190.3(b)(2) borrows from Rule 233, which governs 
the allocation of peremptory strikes, and from Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(a)(2). In most cases there are only 
two sides – plaintiffs and defendants. In complex cases, however, there may be more than two 
sides, such as when defendants have sued third parties not named by plaintiffs, or when defendants 
have sued each other. As an example, if P1 and P2 sue D1, D2, and D3, and D1 sues D2 and D3, 
Ps would together be entitled to depose Ds and others permitted by the rule (i.e., Ds’ experts and 
persons subject to Ds’ control) for 50 hours, and Ds would together be entitled to depose Ps and 
others for 50 hours. D1 would also be entitled to depose D2 and D3 and others for 50 hours on 
matters in controversy among them, and D2 and D3 would together be entitled to depose D1 and 
others for 50 hours.

Any  matter  listed  in  Rule  166  may  be  addressed  in  an  order  issued  under  Rule

Comment  to  2013  change:  Rule  190  is  amended  to  implement  section  22.004(h)  of  the  Texas 
Government  Code,  which  calls  for  rules  to  promote  the  prompt,  efficient,  and  cost-effective 
resolution of civil actions when the amount in controversy does not exceed $100,000.    Rule 190.2 
now applies to expedited actions, as defined by Rule 169. Rule 190.2 continues to apply to divorces

not involving children in which the value of the marital estate is not more than $50,000, which are 
otherwise exempt from the expedited actions process. Amended Rule 190.2(b) ends the discovery 
period  180  days  after  the  date  the  first  discovery  request  is  served;  imposes  a  fifteen  limit 
maximum on interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission; and allows for 
additional  disclosures.  Although  expedited  actions  are  not  subject  to  mandatory  additional 
discovery  under  amended  Rule  190.5,  the  court  may  still  allow  additional  discovery  if  the 
conditions of Rule 190.5(a) are met. 

omment to 2021 change: Rule 190.2 is amended to implement section 22.004(h-1) of the Texas 
Government  Code.  Under  amended  Rule  190.2,  Level  1  discovery  limitations  now  apply  to  a 
broader  subset  of  civil  actions:  expedited  actions  under  Rule  169,  which  is  also  amended  to 
implement  section  22.004(h-1)  of  the  Texas  Government  Code,  and  divorces  not  involving 
children in which the value of the marital estate is not more than $250,000. Level 1 limitations are 
revised  to  impose  a  twenty-hour  limit  on  oral  depositions.  Disclosure  requests  under  Rule 
190.2(b)(6) and Rule 194 are now replaced by required disclosures under Rule 194, as amended. 
The  discovery  periods  under  Rules  190.2(b)(1)  and  190.3(b)(1)  are  revised  to  reference  the 
required disclosures.   
 

RULE 191.    MODIFYING DISCOVERY PROCEDURES AND LIMITATIONS; 
CONFERENCE REQUIREMENT; SIGNING DISCLOSURES; DISCOVERY 
REQUESTS, RESPONSES, AND OBJECTIONS; FILING REQUIREMENTS
 

191.1  Modification of Procedures 

 

xcept  where  specifically  prohibited,  the  procedures  and  limitations  set  forth  in  the  rules 
pertaining to discovery may be modified in any suit by the agreement of the parties or by court 
order for good cause. An agreement of the parties is enforceable if it complies with Rule 11 or, as 
it affects an oral deposition, if it is made a part of the record of the deposition. 

91.2  Conference. 

arties and their attorneys are expected to cooperate in discovery and to make any agreements 
reasonably necessary for the efficient disposition of the case. All discovery motions or requests 
for hearings relating to discovery must contain a certificate by the party filing the motion or request 
that  a  reasonable  effort  has  been  made  to  resolve  the  dispute  without  the  necessity  of  court 
intervention and the effort failed. 

91.3  Signing of Disclosures, Discovery Requests, Notices, Responses, and Objections 

a) 

Signature required.    Every disclosure, discovery request, notice, response, and objection 
must be signed: 

(1) 

by  an  attorney,  if  the  party  is  represented  by  an  attorney,  and  must  show  the 
attorney's State Bar of Texas identification number, address, telephone number, and 
fax number, if any; or 

Page  110

  1

  (

 

 

 

(2) 

by the party, if the party is not represented by an attorney, and must show the party's 
address, telephone number, and fax number, if any. 

Effect of signature on disclosure.    The signature of an attorney or party on a disclosure 
constitutes a certification that to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief, 
formed after a reasonable inquiry, the disclosure is complete and correct as of the time it is 
made. 

Effect of signature on discovery request, notice, response, or objection.    The signature 
of an attorney or party on a discovery request, notice, response, or objection constitutes a 
certification that to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after 
a reasonable inquiry, the request, notice, response, or objection: 

is  consistent  with  the  rules  of  civil  procedure  and  these  discovery  rules  and 
warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, 
or reversal of existing law; 

(2) 

has a good faith factual basis; 

is  not  interposed  for  any  improper  purpose,  such  as  to  harass  or  to  cause 
unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation; and 

is  not  unreasonable  or  unduly  burdensome  or  expensive,  given  the  needs  of  the 
case,  the  discovery  already  had  in  the  case,  the  amount  in  controversy,  and  the 
importance of the issues at stake in the litigation. 

Effect of failure to sign.    If a request, notice, response, or objection is not signed, it must 
be stricken unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called to the attention of the 
party making the request, notice, response, or objection. A party is not required to take any 
action with respect to a request or notice that is not signed. 

Sanctions.    If  the  certification  is  false  without  substantial  justification,  the  court  may, 
upon motion or its own initiative, impose on the person who made the certification, or the 
party on whose behalf the request, notice, response, or objection was made, or both, an 
appropriate sanction as for a frivolous pleading or motion under Chapter 10 of the Civil 
Practice and Remedies Code.

court. 

Retention requirement for persons.    Any person required to serve discovery materials 
not required to be filed must retain the original or exact copy of the materials during the 
pendency of the case and any related appellate proceedings begun within six months after 
judgment is signed, unless otherwise provided by the trial court.

Court.

Notes and Comments 

omment to 1999 change:   

1. 

Rule 191.1 preserves the ability of parties by agreement and trial courts by order to 
adapt discovery to different circumstances. That ability is broad but not unbounded. Parties cannot

merely by agreement modify a court order without the court’s concurrence. Trial courts cannot 
simply “opt out” of these rules by form orders or approve or order a discovery control plan that 
does not contain the matters specified in Rule 190.4, but trial courts may use standard or form 
orders  for  providing  discovery  plans,  scheduling,  and  other  pretrial  matters.  In  individual 
instances,  courts  may  order,  or  parties  may  agree,  to  use  discovery  methods  other  than  those 
prescribed in these rules if appropriate. Because the general rule is stated here, it is not repeated in 
each context in which it applies. Thus, for example, parties can agree to enlarge or shorten the time 
permitted  for  a  deposition  and  to  change  the  manner  in  which  a  deposition  is  conducted, 
notwithstanding Rule 199.5, although parties could not agree to be abusive toward a witness.   

.   

Rule 191.2 expressly states the obligation of parties and their attorneys to cooperate 

in conducting discovery.   

. 

The  requirement  that  discovery  requests,  notices,  responses,  and  objections  be 
signed also applies to documents used to satisfy the purposes of such instruments. An example is 
a statement that privileged material or information has been withheld, which may be separate from 
a response to the discovery request but is nevertheless part of the response.

92.3  Scope of Discovery. 

Generally.    In  general,  a  party  may  obtain  discovery  regarding  any  matter  that  is  not 
privileged and is relevant to the subject matter of the pending action, whether it relates to 
the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or the claim or defense of any other 
party. It is not a ground for objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at 
trial  if the information sought appears  reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of 
admissible evidence. 

Documents  and  tangible  things.    A  party  may  obtain  discovery  of  the  existence, 
description, nature, custody, condition, location, and contents of documents and tangible 
things  (including  papers,  books,  accounts,  drawings,  graphs,  charts,  photographs, 
electronic or videotape recordings, data, and data compilations) that constitute or contain 
matters  relevant  to  the  subject  matter  of  the  action.  A  person  is  required  to  produce  a 
document or tangible thing that is within the person's possession, custody, or control. 

Persons with knowledge of relevant facts.    A party may obtain discovery of the name, 
address, and telephone number of persons having knowledge of relevant facts, and a brief 
statement of each identified person's connection with the case. A person has knowledge of 
relevant facts when that person has or may have knowledge of any discoverable matter. 
The person need not have admissible information or personal knowledge of the facts. An 
expert is "a person with knowledge of relevant facts" only if that knowledge was obtained 
first-hand or if it was not obtained in preparation for trial or in anticipation of litigation. 

Trial  witnesses.    A  party  may  obtain  discovery  of  the  name,  address,  and  telephone 
number of any person who is expected to be called to testify at trial. This paragraph does 
not  apply  to  rebuttal  or  impeaching  witnesses  the  necessity  of  whose  testimony  cannot 
reasonably be anticipated before trial. 

Testifying and consulting experts.    The identity, mental impressions, and opinions of a 
consulting  expert  whose  mental  impressions  and  opinions  have  not  been  reviewed  by  a 
testifying  expert  are  not  discoverable.  A  party  may  discover  the  following  information 
regarding a testifying expert or regarding a consulting expert whose mental impressions or 
opinions have been reviewed by a testifying expert: 

(1) 

the expert's name, address, and telephone number; 

(2) 

the subject matter on which a testifying expert will testify; 

(3) 

the facts known by the expert that relate to or form the basis of the expert's mental 
impressions and opinions formed or made in connection with the case in which the 
discovery  is  sought,  regardless  of  when  and  how  the  factual  information  was 
acquired; 

(4) 

the expert's mental impressions and opinions formed or made in connection with

c) 

  (

the case in which discovery is sought, and any methods used to derive them; 

(5) 

any bias of the witness; 

(6) 

all documents, tangible things, reports, models, or data compilations that have been 
provided  to,  reviewed  by,  or  prepared  by  or  for  the  expert  in  anticipation  of  a 
testifying expert's testimony; 

(7) 

the expert's current resume and bibliography. 

Indemnity and insuring agreements.    Except as otherwise provided by law, a party may 
obtain discovery of the existence and contents of any indemnity or insurance agreement 
under which any person may be liable to satisfy part or all of a judgment rendered in the 
action  or  to  indemnify  or  reimburse  for  payments  made  to  satisfy  the  judgment. 
Information  concerning  the  indemnity  or  insurance  agreement  is  not  by  reason  of 
disclosure admissible in evidence at trial. 

Settlement agreements.    A party may obtain discovery of the existence and contents of 
any  relevant  portions  of  a  settlement  agreement.  Information  concerning  a  settlement 
agreement is not by reason of disclosure admissible in evidence at trial. 

Statements of persons with knowledge of relevant facts.    A party may obtain discovery 
of the statement of any person with knowledge of relevant facts--a "witness statement"--
regardless of when the statement was made. A witness statement is (1) a written statement 
signed  or  otherwise  adopted  or  approved  in  writing  by  the  person  making  it,  or  (2)  a 
stenographic,  mechanical,  electrical,  or  other  type  of  recording  of  a  witness's  oral 
statement,  or  any  substantially  verbatim  transcription  of  such  a  recording.  Notes  taken 
during a conversation or interview with a witness are not a witness statement. Any person 
may obtain, upon written request, his or her own statement concerning the lawsuit, which 
is in the possession, custody or control of any party. 

Potential  parties.    A  party  may  obtain  discovery  of  the  name,  address,  and  telephone 
number of any potential party. 

Contentions.    A party may obtain discovery of any other party's legal contentions and the 
factual bases for those contentions. 

92.4  Limitations on Scope of Discovery. 

he discovery methods permitted by these rules should be limited by the court if it determines, on 

motion or on its own initiative and on reasonable notice, that: 

 

(a) 

the  discovery  sought  is  unreasonably  cumulative  or  duplicative,  or  is  obtainable 
from  some  other  source  that  is  more  convenient,  less  burdensome,  or  less 
expensive; or

(b) 

the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, taking 
into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the parties' resources, 
the  importance  of  the issues  at  stake  in  the  litigation,  and  the  importance  of  the 
proposed discovery in resolving the issues. 

92.5  Work Product. 

a)  Work product defined.    Work product comprises: 

material prepared or mental impressions developed in anticipation of litigation or 
for trial by or for a party or a party's representatives, including the party's attorneys, 
consultants, sureties, indemnitors, insurers, employees, or agents; or 

a communication made in anticipation of litigation or for trial between a party and 
the party's representatives or among a party's representatives, including the party's 
attorneys, consultants, sureties, indemnitors, insurers, employees, or agents. 

b) 

Protection of work product. 

Protection  of  core  work  product--attorney  mental  processes.    Core  work 
product  -  the  work  product  of  an  attorney  or  an  attorney's  representative  that 
contains  the  attorney's  or  the  attorney's  representative's  mental  impressions, 
opinions, conclusions, or legal theories - is not discoverable. 

Protection of other work product.    Any other work product is discoverable only 
upon  a  showing  that  the  party  seeking  discovery  has  substantial  need  of  the 
materials in the preparation of the party's case and that the party is unable without 
undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the material by other means. 

Incidental  disclosure  of  attorney  mental  processes.    It  is  not  a  violation  of 
subparagraph  (1)  if  disclosure  ordered  pursuant  to  subparagraph  (2)  incidentally 
discloses  by  inference  attorney  mental  processes  otherwise  protected  under 
subparagraph (1). 

Limiting  disclosure  of  mental  processes.    If  a  court  orders  discovery  of  work 
product pursuant to subparagraph (2), the court must--insofar as possible--protect 
against  disclosure  of  the  mental  impressions,  opinions,  conclusions,  or  legal 
theories not otherwise discoverable. 

c) 

Exceptions.    Even  if  made  or  prepared  in  anticipation  of  litigation  or  for  trial,  the 
following is not work product protected from discovery: 

(1) 

information  discoverable  under  Rule  192.3  concerning  experts,  trial  witnesses, 
witness statements, and contentions; 

(2) 

trial exhibits ordered disclosed under Rule 166 or Rule 190.4;

accident scene) or a photograph or electronic image of any sort that a party intends 
to offer into evidence; and 

(3) 

4)

(5) 

any work product created under circumstances within an exception to the attorney-
client privilege in Rule 503(d) of the Rules of Evidence. 

d) 

Privilege.    For purposes of these rules, an assertion that material or information is work 
product is an assertion of privilege. 

92.6  Protective Order. 

a)  Motion.    A person from whom discovery is sought, and any other person affected by the 
discovery  request,  may  move  within  the  time  permitted  for  response  to  the  discovery 
request for an order protecting that person from the discovery sought. A person should not 
move for protection when an objection to written discovery or an assertion of privilege is 
appropriate, but a motion does not waive the objection or assertion of privilege. If a person 
seeks protection regarding the time or place of discovery, the person must state a reasonable 
time and place for discovery with which the person will comply. A person must comply 
with a request to the extent protection is  not  sought  unless it is unreasonable under the 
circumstances to do so before obtaining a ruling on the motion. 

Order.    To  protect  the  movant  from  undue  burden,  unnecessary  expense,  harassment, 
annoyance, or invasion of personal, constitutional, or property rights, the court may make 
any order in the interest of justice and may - among other things - order that: 

(1) 

the requested discovery not be sought in whole or in part; 

(2) 

the extent or subject matter of discovery be limited; 

(3) 

the discovery not be undertaken at the time or place specified; 

(4) 

(5) 

the  discovery  be  undertaken  only  by  such  method  or  upon  such  terms  and 
conditions or at the time and place directed by the court; 

the results of discovery be sealed or otherwise protected, subject to the provisions 
of Rule 76a.

Possession, custody, or control of an item means that the person either has physical 
possession  of  the  item  or  has  a  right  to  possession  of  the  item  that  is  equal  or 
superior to the person who has physical possession of the item. 

A testifying expert is an expert who may be called to testify as an expert witness at 
trial. 

A  consulting  expert  is  an  expert  who  has  been  consulted,  retained,  or  specially 
employed by a party in anticipation of litigation or in preparation for trial, but who 
is not a testifying expert. 

omment to 1999 change:   

Notes and Comments 

1. 

While  the  scope  of  discovery  is  quite  broad,  it  is  nevertheless  confined  by  the 
subject  matter  of  the  case  and  reasonable  expectations  of  obtaining  information  that  will  aid 
resolution of the dispute. The rule must be read and applied in that context. See In re American 
Optical Corp., _S.W.2d_ (Tex. 1998) (per curiam); K-Mart v. Sanderson, 937 S.W.2d 429 (Tex. 
1996)  (per  curiam);  Dillard  Dept.  Stores  v.  Hall,  909  S.W.2d  491  (Tex.  1995)  (per  curiam); 
Texaco, Inc. v. Sanderson, 898 S.W.2d 813 (Tex. 1995) (per curiam); Loftin v. Martin, 776 S.W.2d 
145, 148 (Tex. 1989). 

. 

The  definition  of  documents  and  tangible  things  has  been  revised  to  clarify  that 
things relevant to the subject matter of the action are within the scope of discovery regardless of 
their form. 

. 

Rule  192.3(c)  makes  discoverable  a  “brief  statement  of  each  identified  person’s 
connection with the case.” This provision does not contemplate a narrative statement of the facts 
the  person  knows,  but  at  most  a  few  words  describing  the  person’s  identity  as  relevant  to  the 
lawsuit.  For  instance:  “treating  physician,”  “eyewitness,”  “chief  financial  officer,”  “director,” 
“plaintiff’s mother and eyewitness to accident.” The rule is intended to be consistent with Axelson 
v. McIlhany, 798 S.W.2d 550 (Tex. 1990). 

Rule  192.3(g)  does  not  suggest  that  settlement  agreements  in  other  cases  are 

relevant or irrelevant. 

. 

Rule 192.3(j) makes a party’s legal and factual contentions discoverable but does 
not require more than a basic statement of those contentions and does not require a marshaling of 
evidence.   

The  sections  in  former  Rule  166b  concerning  land  and  medical  records  are  not

included in this rule. They remain within the scope of discovery and are discussed in other rules.   

. 

The court’s power to limit discovery based on the needs and circumstances of the 
case is expressly stated in Rule 192.4. The provision is taken from Rule 26(b)(2) of the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure. Courts should limit discovery under this rule only to prevent unwarranted 
delay and expense as stated more fully in the rule. A court abuses its discretion in unreasonably 
restricting a party’s access to information through discovery. 

. 

Work product is defined for the first time, and its exceptions stated. Work product 
replaces  the  “attorney  work  product”  and  “party  communication”  discovery  exemptions  from 
former Rule 166b.   

. 

Elimination  of  the  “witness  statement”  exemption  does  not  render  all  witness 
statements automatically discoverable but subjects them to the same rules concerning the scope of 
discovery and privileges applicable to other documents or tangible things.       
 

RULE 193.    WRITTEN DISCOVERY: RESPONSE; OBJECTION; ASSERTION OF 
PRIVILEGE; SUPPLEMENTATION AND AMENDMENT; FAILURE TO TIMELY 
RESPOND; PRESUMPTION OF AUTHENTICITY
 

193.1  Responding to Written Discovery; Duty to Make Complete Response. 

 

 party must respond to written discovery in writing within the time provided by court order or 
these rules. When responding to written discovery, a party must make a complete response, based 
on  all  information  reasonably  available  to  the  responding  party  or  its  attorney  at  the  time  the 
response  is  made.  The  responding  party's  answers,  objections,  and  other  responses  must  be 
preceded by the request or required disclosure to which they apply.

93.2  Objecting to Written Discovery 

Form and time for objections.    A party must make any objection to written discovery in 
writing - either in the response or in a separate document - within the time for response. 
The party must state specifically the legal or factual basis for the objection and the extent 
to which the party is refusing to comply with the request. 

Duty to respond when partially objecting; objection to time or place of production.   
A party must comply with as much of the request to which the party has made no objection 
unless it is unreasonable under the circumstances to do so before obtaining a ruling on the 
objection. If the responding party objects to the requested time or place of production, the 
responding party must state a reasonable time and place for complying with the request 
and must comply at that time and place without further request or order.

Good faith basis for objection.    A party may object to written discovery only if a good 
faith factual and legal basis for the objection exists at the time the objection is made. 

d) 

Amendment.    An  objection  or  response  to  written  discovery  may  be  amended  or

supplemented  to  state  an  objection  or  basis  that,  at  the  time  the  objection  or  response 
initially was made, either was inapplicable or was unknown after reasonable inquiry. 

e)  Waiver of objection.    An objection that is not made within the time required, or that is 
obscured by numerous unfounded objections, is waived unless the court excuses the waiver 
for good cause shown. 

No objection to preserve privilege.    A party should not object to a request for written 
discovery  on  the  grounds  that  it  calls  for  production  of  material  or  information  that  is 
privileged but should instead comply with Rule 193.3. A party who objects to production 
of privileged material or information does not waive the privilege but must comply with 
Rule 193.3 when the error is pointed out. 

93.3  Asserting a Privilege 

 party may preserve a privilege from written discovery in accordance with this subdivision. 

(a)  Withholding  privileged  material  or  information.    A  party  who  claims  that 
material or information responsive to written discovery is privileged may withhold 
the privileged material or information from the response. The party must state--in 
the response (or an amended or supplemental response) or in a separate document-
-that: 

(1) 

(2) 

 

(b) 

information or material responsive to the request or required disclosure has 
been withheld, 

the  request  or  required  disclosure  to  which  the  information  or  material 
relates, and 

(3) 

the privilege or privileges asserted. 

Description  of  withheld  material  or  information.    After  receiving  a  response 
indicating that material or information has been withheld from production, a party 
seeking discovery may serve a written request that the withholding party identify 
the information and material withheld. Within 15 days of service of that request, 
the withholding party must serve a response that: 

(1) 

describes the information or materials withheld that, without revealing the 
privileged  information  itself  or  otherwise  waiving  the  privilege,  enables 
other parties to assess the applicability of the privilege, and 

(2) 

asserts a specific privilege for each item or group of items withheld. 

(c) 

Exemption.    Without  complying  with  paragraphs  (a)  and  (b),  a  party  may 
withhold a privileged communication to or from a lawyer or lawyer's representative 
or a privileged document of a lawyer or lawyer's representative 

  (

created or made from the point at which a party consults a lawyer with a 
view  to  obtaining  professional  legal  services  from  the  lawyer  in  the 
prosecution  or  defense  of  a  specific  claim  in  the  litigation  in  which 
discovery is requested or required, and 

(2) 

concerning the litigation in which the discovery is requested or required. 

(d) 

Privilege  not  waived  by  production.    A  party  who  produces  material  or 
information  without intending to waive a  claim of  privilege does  not  waive that 
claim under these rules or the Rules of Evidence if - within ten days or a shorter 
time ordered by the court, after the  producing party  actually  discovers that such 
production was made - the producing party amends the response, identifying the 
material or information produced and stating the privilege asserted. If the producing 
party thus amends the response to assert a privilege, any party who has obtained 
the specific material or information must promptly return the specified material or 
information and any copies pending any ruling by the court denying the privilege. 

Hearing.    Any party may at any reasonable time request a hearing on an objection or claim 
of  privilege  asserted  under  this  rule.  The  party  making  the  objection  or  asserting  the 
privilege must present any evidence necessary to support the objection or privilege. The 
evidence may be testimony presented at the hearing or affidavits served at least seven days 
before  the  hearing  or  at  such  other  reasonable  time  as  the  court  permits.  If  the  court 
determines that an in camera review of some or all of the requested discovery or required 
disclosure is necessary, that material or information must be segregated and produced to 
the court in a sealed wrapper within a reasonable time following the hearing. 

Ruling.    To the extent the court sustains the objection or claim of privilege, the responding 
party has no further duty to respond to that request or required disclosure. To the extent the 
court overrules the objection or claim of privilege, the responding party must produce the 
requested or required material or information within 30 days after the court's ruling or at 
such time as the court orders. A party need not request a ruling on that party's own objection 
or assertion of privilege to preserve the objection or privilege. 

Use of material or information withheld under claim of privilege.    A party may not 
use--at any hearing or trial--material or information withheld from discovery under a claim 
of  privilege,  including  a  claim  sustained  by  the  court,  without  timely  amending  or 
supplementing the party's response to that discovery.

93.5  Amending or Supplementing Responses to Written Discovery. 

Duty  to  amend  or  supplement.    If  a  party  learns  that  the  party's  response  to  written 
discovery was incomplete or incorrect when made, or, although complete and correct when 
made, is no longer complete and correct, the party must amend or supplement the response:

c)

(2) 

to the  extent that  the written discovery sought the identification  of persons with 
knowledge of relevant facts, trial witnesses, or expert witnesses, and 

to  the  extent  that  the  written  discovery  sought  other  information,  unless  the 
additional or corrective information has been made known to the other parties in 
writing, on the record at a deposition, or through other discovery responses. 

Time and form of amended or supplemental response.    An amended or supplemental 
response must be made reasonably promptly after the party discovers the necessity for such 
a response. Except as otherwise provided by these rules, it is presumed that an amended or 
supplemental  response  made  less  than  30  days  before  trial  was  not  made  reasonably 
promptly. An amended or supplemental response must be in the same form as the initial 
response  and  must  be  verified  by  the  party  if  the  original  response  was  required  to  be 
verified by the party, but the failure to comply with this requirement does not make the 
amended or supplemental response untimely unless the party making the response refuses 
to correct the defect within a reasonable time after it is pointed out. 

93.6  Failing to Timely Respond - Effect on Trial 

Exclusion of evidence and exceptions.    A party who fails to make, amend, or supplement 
a discovery response, including a required disclosure, in a timely manner may not introduce 
in evidence the material or information that was not timely disclosed, or offer the testimony 
of a witness (other than a named party) who was not timely identified, unless the court 
finds that: 

there  was  good  cause  for  the  failure  to  timely  make,  amend,  or  supplement  the 
discovery response; or 

the failure to timely make, amend, or supplement the discovery response will not 
unfairly surprise or unfairly prejudice the other parties. 

Burden of establishing exception.    The burden of establishing good cause or the lack of 
unfair surprise or unfair prejudice is on the party seeking to introduce the evidence or call 
the witness. A finding of good cause or of the lack of unfair surprise or unfair prejudice 
must be supported by the record. 

Continuance.    Even if the party seeking to introduce the evidence or call the witness fails 
to carry the burden under paragraph (b), the court may grant a continuance or temporarily 
postpone the trial to allow a response to be made, amended, or supplemented, and to allow 
opposing  parties  to conduct  discovery regarding any new  information presented by that 
response. 

93.7  Production of Documents Self-Authenticating 

 party's production of a document in response to written discovery authenticates the document

for use against that party in any pretrial proceeding or at trial unless - within ten days or a longer 
or shorter time ordered by the court, after the producing party has actual notice that the document 
will be used - the party objects to the authenticity of the document, or any part of it, stating the 
specific basis for objection. An objection must be either on the record or in writing and must have 
a  good  faith  factual  and  legal  basis.  An  objection  made  to  the  authenticity  of  only  part  of  a 
document  does  not  affect  the  authenticity  of  the  remainder.  If  objection  is  made,  the  party 
attempting  to  use  the  document  should  be  given  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  establish  its 
authenticity. 
 

Notes and Comments 

omment to 1999 change:   

  C

 

1. 

This  rule  imposes  a  duty  upon  parties  to  make  a  complete  response  to  written 
discovery based upon all information reasonable available, subject to objections and privileges.   
 

2. 

An  objection  to  a  written  discovery  does  not  excuse  the  responding  party  from 
complying with the request to the extent no objection is made. But a party may object to a request 
for “all documents relevant to the lawsuit” as overly broad and not in compliance with the rule 
requiring  specific  requests  for  documents  and  refuse  to  comply  with  it  entirely.  See  Loftin  v. 
Martin, 776 S.W.2d 145 (Tex. 1989). A party may also object to a request for a litigation file on 
the ground that it is overly broad and may assert that on its face the request seeks only materials 
protected by privilege. See National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Valdez, 863 S.W.2d 458 (Tex. 1993). 
A  party  who  objects  to  production  of  documents  from  a  remote  time  period  should  produce 
documents from a more recent period unless that production would be burdensome and duplicative 
should the objection be overruled. 
 

3. 

This  rule  governs  the  presentation  of  all  privileges  including  work  product.  It 
dispenses with objections to written discovery requests on the basis that responsive information or 
materials are protected by a specific privilege from discovery. Instead, the rule requires parties to 
state that information or materials have been withheld and to identify the privilege upon which the 
party  relies.  The  statement  should  not  be  made  prophylactically,  but  only  when  specific 
information and materials have been withheld. The party must amend or supplement the statement 
if additional privileged information or material is found subsequent to the initial response. Thus, 
when large numbers of documents are being  produced,  a  party may  amend the initial response 
when  documents  are  found  as  to  which  the  party  claims  privilege.  A  party  need  not  state  that 
material created by or for lawyers for the litigation has been withheld as it can be assumed that 
such  material  will  be  withheld  from  virtually  any  request  on  the  grounds  of  attorney-client 
privilege or work product. However, the rule does not prohibit a party from specifically requesting 
the material or information if the party has a good faith basis for asserting that it is discoverable. 
An  example  would  be  material  or  information  described  by  Rule  503(d)(1)  of  the  Rules  of 
Evidence.           

4. 

Rule 193.3(d) is a new provision that allows a party to assert a claim of privilege to 
material  or  information  produced  inadvertently  without  intending  to  waive  the  privilege.  The 
provision  is  commonly  used  in  complex  cases  to  reduce  costs  and  risks  in  large  document 

Page  123 

   

 

productions. The focus is on the intent to waive the privilege, not the intent to produce the material 
or information. A party who fails to diligently screen documents before producing them does not 
waive a claim of privilege. This rule is thus broader than Tex. R. Evid. 511 and overturns Granada 
Corp. v. First Court of Appeals, 844 S.W.2d 223 (Tex. 1992), to the extent the two conflict. The 
ten-day period (which may be shortened by the court) allowed for an amended response does not 
run from the production of the material or information but from the party’s first awareness of the 
mistake. To avoid complications at trial, a party may identify prior to trial the documents intended 
to be offered, thereby triggering the obligation to assert any overlooked privilege under this rule. 
A trial court may also order this procedure. 

5. 

This rule imposes no duty to supplement or amend deposition testimony. The only 

duty to supplement deposition testimony is provided in Rule 195.6. 

6. 

Any party can request a hearing in which the court will resolve issues brought up 
in objections or withholding statements. The party seeking to avoid discovery has the burden of 
proving the objection or privilege.   

7. 

The  self-authenticating  provision  is  new.  Authentication  is,  of  course,  but  a 
condition precedent to admissibility and does not establish admissibility. See Tex. R. Evid. 901(a). 
The ten-day period allowed for objection to authenticity (which period may be altered by the court 
in appropriate circumstances) does not run from the production of the material or information but 
from the party’s actual awareness that the document will be used. To avoid complications at trial, 
a  party  may  identify  prior  to  trial the  documents  intended  to  be  offered,  thereby  triggering the 
obligation to object to authenticity. A trial court may also order this procedure. An objection to 
authenticity must be made in good faith.       
 

RULE 194.    REQUIRED DISCLOSURES 
 

194.1  Duty to Disclose; Production. 

Duty  to  Disclose.  Except  as  exempted  by  Rule  194.2(d)  or  as  otherwise  agreed  by  the 
parties or ordered by the court, a party must, without awaiting a discovery request, provide 
to the other parties the information or material described in Rule 194.2, 194.3, and 194.4. 

Production. If a party does not produce copies of all responsive documents, electronically 
stored  information,  and  tangible  things  with  the  response,  the  response  must  state  a 
reasonable time and method for the production of these items. The responding party must 
produce  the  items  at  the  time  and  in  the  method  stated,  unless  otherwise  agreed  by  the 
parties  or  ordered  by  the  court,  and  must  provide  the  requesting  party  a  reasonable 
opportunity to inspect them.   

94.2  Initial Disclosures. 

Time  for Initial  Disclosures. A party must make the initial disclosures  within  30 days 
after the filing of the first answer or general appearance unless a different time is set by the

be made at least 30 days before trial.   

Proceedings Exempt from Pretrial Disclosure. An action arising under the Family Code 
filed  by  or  against  the  Title  IV-D  agency  in  a  Title  IV-D  case  is  exempt  from  pretrial 
disclosure, but a court may order the parties to make particular disclosures and set the time

94.6  Certain Responses Not Admissible. 

 disclosure under Rule 194.2(b)(3) and (4) that has been changed by an amended or supplemental 

response is not admissible and may not be used for impeachment. 
 

Notes and Comments 

omment to 1999 change:   

1. 

Disclosure  is designed to  afford  parties basic discovery  of specific categories of 
information, not automatically in every case, but upon request, without preparation of a lengthy 
inquiry, and without objection or assertion of work product. In those extremely rare cases when 

Page  127

information  ordinarily  discoverable  should  be  protected,  such  as  when  revealing  a  person’s 
residence might result in harm to the person, a party may move for protection. A party may assert 
any applicable privileges other than work product using the procedures of Rule 193.3 applicable 
to other written discovery. Otherwise, to fail to respond fully to a request for disclosure would be 
an abuse of the discovery process.     

. 

Rules 194.2(c) and (d) permit a party further inquiry into another’s legal theories 
and  factual  claims  than  is  often  provided  in  notice  pleadings.  So-called  “contention 
interrogatories” are used for the same purpose. Such interrogatories are not properly used to require 
a party to marshal evidence or brief legal issues. Paragraphs (c) and (d) are intended to require 
disclosure of a party’s basic assertions, whether in prosecution of claims or in defense. Thus, for 
example, a plaintiff would be required to disclose that he or she claimed damages suffered in a car 
wreck caused by defendant’s negligence in speeding, and would be required to state how loss of 
past earnings and future earning capacity was calculated, but would not be required to state the 
speed at which defendant was allegedly driving. Paragraph (d) does not require a party, either a 
plaintiff or a defendant, to state a method of calculating non-economic damages, such as for mental 
anguish. In the same example, defendant would be required to disclose his or her denial of the 
speeding allegation and any basis for contesting the damage calculations.   

. 

Responses under Rule 194.2(c) and (d) that have been amended or supplemented 
are inadmissible and cannot be used for impeachment, but other evidence of changes in position 
is not likewise barred.   

omment to 2021 change: Rule 194 is amended to implement section 22.004(h-1) of the Texas 
Government Code. Rule 194 is amended based on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a) to require 
disclosure of basic discovery automatically, without awaiting a discovery request. A party is not 
excused from making its disclosures because it has not fully investigated the case or because it 
challenges the sufficiency of another party’s disclosures or because another party has not made its 
disclosures. As with other written discovery responses, required disclosures must be signed under 
Rule  191.3,  complete  under  Rule  193.1,  served  under  rule  191.5,  and  timely  amended  or 
supplemented under Rule 193.5.

described in Rule 195.5(a)–by the following dates:

with regard to all experts testifying for a party seeking affirmative relief, 90 days 
before the end of the discovery period;

(b) 

with regard to all other experts, 60 days before the end of the discovery period. 

95.3  Scheduling Depositions. 

a) 

Experts  for party seeking  affirmative relief.    A party seeking  affirmative  relief must 
make an expert retained by, employed by, or otherwise in the control of the party available 
for deposition as follows: 

(1) 

(2) 

If  no  report  furnished.    If  a  report  of  the  expert's  factual  observations,  tests, 
supporting data, calculations, photographs, and opinions is not produced when the 
expert is designated, then the party must make the expert available for deposition 
reasonably promptly after the expert is designated. If the deposition cannot--due to 
the  actions  of  the  tendering  party--reasonably  be  concluded  more  than  15  days 
before the deadline for designating other experts, that deadline must be extended 
for other experts testifying on the same subject. 

If  report  furnished.    If  a  report  of  the  expert's  factual  observations,  tests, 
supporting  data,  calculations,  photographs,  and  opinions  is  produced  when  the 
expert  is  designated,  then  the  party  need  not  make  the  expert  available  for 
deposition until reasonably promptly after all other experts have been designated. 

Other experts.    A party not seeking affirmative relief must make an expert retained by, 
employed by, or otherwise in the control of the party available for deposition reasonably 
promptly after the expert is designated and the experts testifying on the same subject for 
the party seeking affirmative relief have been deposed. 

95.4  Oral Deposition. 

n  addition  to  the  information  disclosed  under  Rule  195.5(a),  a  party  may  obtain  discovery 
concerning  the  subject  matter  on  which  the  expert  is  expected  to  testify,  the  expert's  mental 
impressions and opinions, the facts known to the expert (regardless of when the factual information 
was  acquired)  that  relate  to  or  form  the  basis  of  the  testifying  expert's  mental  impressions  and 
opinions, and other discoverable matters, including documents not produced in disclosure, only by 
oral deposition of the expert and by a report prepared by the expert under this rule. 

95.5  Expert Disclosures and Reports. 

Disclosures. Without awaiting a discovery request, a party must provide the following for 
any testifying expert: 

(1) 

the expert’s name, address, and telephone number; 

(2) 

the subject matter on which the expert will testify; 

(3)

responding party:

have  been  provided  to,  reviewed  by,  or  prepared  by  or  for  the  expert  in 
anticipation of the expert’s testimony; 

(B) 

the expert’s current resume and bibliography; 

(C) 

(D) 

the expert’s qualifications, including a list of all publications authored in 
the previous 10 years; 

except when the expert is the responding party’s attorney and is testifying 
to attorney fees, a list of all other cases in which, during the previous four 
years, the expert testified as an expert at trial or by deposition; and   

(E) 

a  statement  of  the  compensation  to  be  paid  for  the  expert’s  study  and 
testimony in the case. 

Expert  Reports.  If  the  discoverable  factual  observations,  tests,  supporting  data, 
calculations, photographs, or opinions of an expert have not been recorded and reduced to 
tangible form, the court may order these matters reduced to tangible form and produced in 
addition to the deposition. 

Expert Communications Protected. Communications between the party’s attorney and 
any testifying expert witness in the case are protected from discovery, regardless of the 
form of the communications, except to the extent that the communications: 

(1) 

relate to compensation for the expert’s study or testimony; 

identify  facts  or  data  that  the  party’s  attorney  provided  and  that  the  expert 
considered in forming the opinions to be expressed; or   

identify assumptions that the party’s attorney provided and that the expert relied on 
in forming the opinions to be expressed. 

 

 

 

 

 

(2) 

(3) 

d) 

Draft Expert Reports and Disclosures Protected. A draft expert report or draft disclosure 
required under this rule is protected from discovery, regardless of the form in which the 
draft is recorded.

A party's duty to amend and supplement written discovery regarding a testifying expert is governed 
by Rule 193.5. If an expert witness is retained by, employed by, or otherwise under the control of 
a party, that party must also amend or supplement any deposition testimony or written report by 
the expert, but only with regard to the expert's mental impressions or opinions and the basis for 
them. 

95.7  Cost of Expert Witnesses. 

hen a party takes the oral deposition of an expert witness retained by the opposing party, all 
reasonable  fees  charged  by  the  expert  for  time  spent  in  preparing  for,  giving,  reviewing,  and 
correcting the deposition must be paid by the party that retained the expert. 

1. 

This rule does not limit the permissible methods of discovery concerning consulting 
experts whose mental impressions or opinions have been reviewed by a testifying expert. See Rule 
192.3(e). Information concerning purely consulting experts, of course, is not discoverable. 

. 

This rule and Rule 194 do not address depositions of testifying experts who are not 
retained  by,  employed  by,  or  otherwise  subject  to  the  control  of  the  responding  party,  nor  the 
production of the materials identified in Rule 192.3(e)(5) and (6) relating to such experts. Parties 
may obtain this discovery, however, through Rules 176 and 205.   

. 

In  scheduling  the  designations  and  depositions  of  expert  witnesses,  the  rule 
attempts to minimize unfair surprise and undue expense. A party seeking affirmative relief must 
either produce an expert’s report or tender the expert for deposition before an opposing party is 
required to designate experts. A party who does not wish to incur the expense of a report may 
simply tender the expert for deposition, but a party who wishes an expert to have the benefit of an 
opposing party’s expert’s opinions before being deposed may trigger designation by providing a 
report.  Rule  191.1  permits  a  trial  court,  for  good  cause,  to  modify  the  order  or  deadlines  for 
designating and deposing experts and the allocation of fees and expenses.   

omment to 2021 change: Rule 195 is amended to reflect changes to Rule 194. Amended Rule 
195.5(a) lists the disclosures for any testifying expert, which are now required without awaiting a 
discovery request, that were formerly listed in Rule 194(f). Amended Rule 195.5(a) also includes 
three new disclosures based on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(B). New Rules 195.5(b) 
and (c) are based on Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 26(b)(4)(B) and (C) and are added to clarify 
protections available.

Request.    A party may serve on another party--no later than 30 days before the end of the 
discovery  period--a  request  for  production  or  for  inspection,  to  inspect,  sample,  test, 
photograph and copy documents or tangible things within the scope of discovery. 

Contents of request.    The request must specify the items to be produced or inspected, 
either by individual item or by category, and describe with reasonable particularity each 
item  and  category.  The  request  must  specify  a  reasonable  time  (on  or  after  the  date  on 
which the response is due) and place for production. If the requesting party will sample or 
test the requested items, the means, manner and procedure for testing or sampling must be 
described with sufficient specificity to inform the producing party of the means, manner, 
and procedure for testing or sampling. 

c) 

Requests for production of medical or mental health records regarding nonparties. 

(1) 

Service  of  request  on  nonparty.    If  a  party  requests  another  party  to  produce 
medical or mental health records regarding a nonparty, the requesting party must 
serve the nonparty with the request for production under Rule 21a. 

(2) 

Exceptions.    A  party  is  not  required  to  serve  the  request  for  production  on  a 
nonparty whose medical records are sought if: 

(A) 

(B) 

(C) 

the  nonparty  signs  a  release  of  the  records  that  is  effective  as  to  the 
requesting party; 

the identity of the nonparty whose records are sought will not directly or 
indirectly be disclosed by production of the records; or 

the court, upon a showing of good cause by the party seeking the records, 
orders that service is not required. 

(3) 

Confidentiality.    Nothing in this rule excuses compliance with laws concerning 
the confidentiality of medical or mental health records. 

96.2  Response to Request for Production and Inspection. 

Time for response.    The responding party must serve a written response on the requesting 
party within 30 days after service of the request. 

Content of response.    With respect to each item or category of items, the responding party 
must  state  objections  and  assert  privileges  as  required  by  these  rules,  and  state,  as 
appropriate, that: 

(1) 

production, inspection, or other requested action will be permitted as requested; 

(2) 

the requested items are being served on the requesting party with the response;

production, inspection, or other requested action will take place at a specified time 
and place, if the responding party is objecting to the time and place of production; 
or 

(4) 

no items have been identified - after a diligent search - that are responsive to the 
request. 

96.3  Production. 

Time  and  place  of  production.    Subject  to  any  objections  stated  in  the  response,  the 
responding  party  must  produce  the  requested  documents  or  tangible  things  within  the 
person's possession, custody or control at either the time and place requested or the time 
and place stated in the response, unless otherwise agreed by the parties or ordered by the 
court, and must provide the requesting party a reasonable opportunity to inspect them. 

Copies.    The responding party may produce copies in lieu of originals unless a question 
is raised as to the authenticity of the original or in the circumstances it would be unfair to 
produce  copies  in  lieu  of  originals.  If  originals  are  produced,  the  responding  party  is 
entitled to retain the originals while the requesting party inspects and copies them. 

Organization.    The responding party must either produce documents and tangible things 
as they are kept in the usual course of business or organize and label them to correspond 
with the categories in the request. 

96.4  Electronic or Magnetic Data. 

o obtain discovery of data or information that exists in electronic or magnetic form, the requesting 
party must specifically request production of electronic or magnetic data and specify the form in 
which the requesting party wants it produced. The responding party must produce the electronic 
or magnetic data that is responsive to the request and is reasonably available to the responding 
party in its ordinary course of business. If the responding party cannot - through reasonable efforts 
-retrieve the data or information requested or produce it in the form requested, the responding party 
must  state  an  objection complying with  these  rules.  If  the  court  orders  the  responding  party  to 
comply with the request, the court must also order that the requesting party pay the reasonable 
expenses of any extraordinary steps required to retrieve and produce the information. 

esting, sampling or examination of an item may not destroy or materially alter an item unless

previously authorized by the court. 

96.6  Expenses of Production. 

nless otherwise ordered by the court for good cause, the expense of producing items will be borne 
by  the  responding  party  and  the  expense  of  inspecting,  sampling,  testing,  photographing,  and

copying items produced will be borne by the requesting party. 

96.7  Request of Motion for Entry Upon Property. 

Request  or  motion.    A  party  may  gain  entry  on  designated  land  or  other  property  to 
inspect, measure, survey, photograph, test, or sample the property or any designated object 
or operation thereon by serving - no later than 30 days before the end of any applicable 
discovery period - 

(1) 

a request on all parties if the land or property belongs to a party, or 

(2) 

a motion and notice of hearing on all parties and the nonparty if the land or property 
belongs to a nonparty. If the identity or address of the nonparty is unknown and 
cannot be obtained through reasonable diligence, the court must permit service by 
means other than those specified in Rule 21a that are reasonably calculated to give 
the nonparty notice of the motion and hearing. 

Time, place, and other conditions.    The request for entry upon a party's property, or the 
order for entry upon a nonparty's property, must state the time, place, manner, conditions, 
and scope of the inspection, and must specifically describe any desired means, manner, and 
procedure  for  testing  or  sampling,  and  the  person  or  persons  by  whom  the  inspection, 
testing, or sampling is to be made. 

c) 

Response to request for entry.   

(1) 

(2) 

Time  to  respond.    The  responding  party  must  serve  a  written  response  on  the 
requesting party within 30 days after service of the request. 

Content  of  response.    The  responding  party  must  state  objections  and  assert 
privileges as required by these rules, and state, as appropriate, that: 

(A) 

entry or other requested action will be permitted as requested; 

(B) 

(C) 

entry or other requested action will take place at a specified time and place, 
if the responding party is objecting to the time and place of production; or 

entry or other requested action cannot be permitted for reasons stated in the 
response. 

d) 

Requirements  for  order  for  entry  on  nonparty's  property.    An  order  for  entry  on  a 
nonparty's property may issue only for good cause shown and only if the land, property, or 
object thereon as to which discovery is sought is relevant to the subject matter of the action.

A party requesting sampling or testing must describe the procedure with sufficient 

specificity to enable the responding party to make any appropriate objections.   

. 

A  party  requesting  production  of  magnetic  or  electronic  data  must  specifically 
request  the  data,  specify  the  form  in  which  it  wants  the  data  produced,  and  specify  any 
extraordinary steps for retrieval and translation. Unless ordered otherwise, the responding party 
need only produce the data reasonably available in the ordinary course of business in reasonably 
usable form.   

The rule clarifies how the expenses of production are to be allocated absent a court 

order to the contrary. 

The obligation of parties to produce documents within their possession, custody or 

control is explained in Rule 192.3(b). 

Parties  may request  production and inspection of documents  and  tangible things 

from nonparties under Rule 205.3. 

  Rule 196.3(b) is based on Tex. R. Evid. 1003. 

Rule  196.1(c)  is  merely  a  notice  requirement  and  does  not  expand  the  scope  of 

discovery of a nonparty’s medical records.

RULE 197.    INTERROGATORIES TO PARTIES 
 

197.1  Interrogatories. 

 party may serve on another party - no later than 30 days before the end of the discovery period 
-written interrogatories to inquire about any matter within the scope of discovery except matters 
covered  by  Rule  195.  An  interrogatory  may  inquire  whether  a  party  makes  a  specific  legal  or 
factual contention and may ask the responding party to state the legal theories and to describe in 
general the factual bases for the party's claims or defenses, but interrogatories may not be used to 
require the responding party to marshal all of its available proof or the proof the party intends to 
offer at trial. 

97.2  Response to Interrogatories. 

Time for response.    The responding party must serve a written response on the requesting 
party within 30 days after service of the interrogatories. 

Content of response.    A response must include the party's answers to the interrogatories 
and may include objections and assertions of privilege as required under these rules. 

Page  135

b) 

(c) 

Option  to  produce  records.    If  the  answer  to  an  interrogatory  may  be  derived  or 
ascertained from public records, from the responding party's business records, or from a 
compilation,  abstract  or  summary  of  the  responding  party's  business  records,  and  the 
burden of deriving or ascertaining the answer is substantially the same for the requesting 
party as for the responding party, the responding party may answer the interrogatory by 
specifying and, if applicable, producing the records or compilation, abstract or summary 
of the records. The records from which the answer may be derived or ascertained must be 
specified in sufficient detail to permit the requesting party to locate and identify them as 
readily as can the responding party. If the responding party has specified business records, 
the  responding  party  must  state  a  reasonable  time  and  place  for  examination  of  the 
documents. The responding party must produce the documents at the time and place stated, 
unless  otherwise  agreed  by  the  parties  or  ordered  by  the  court,  and  must  provide  the 
requesting party a reasonable opportunity to inspect them. 

d) 

Verification  required;  exceptions.    A  responding  party  -  not  an  agent  or  attorney  as 
otherwise permitted by Rule 14 - must sign the answers under oath except that: 

when answers are based on information obtained from other persons, the party may 
so state, and 

a party need not sign answers to interrogatories about persons with knowledge of 
relevant facts, trial witnesses, and legal contentions. 

(1) 

(2) 

97.3  Use. 

nswers  to  interrogatories  may  be  used  only  against  the  responding  party.  An  answer  to  an 
interrogatory  inquiring  about  matters  described  in  Rule  194.2(b)(3)  and  (b)(4)  that  has  been 
amended or supplemented is not admissible and may not be used for impeachment. 
 

Notes and Comments 

omment to 1999 change:   

1. 

Interrogatories about specific legal or factual assertions – such as, whether a party 
claims a breach of implied warranty, or when a party contends that limitations began to run – are 
proper, but interrogatories that ask a party to state all legal and factual assertions are improper. As 
with requests for disclosure, interrogatories may be used to ascertain basic legal and factual claims 
and defenses but may not be used to force a party to marshal evidence. Use of the answers to such 
interrogatories is limited, just as the use of similar disclosures under Rule 194.6 is.   

. 

Rule  191’s  requirement  that  a  party’s  attorney  sign  all  discovery  responses  and 
objections applies to interrogatory responses and objections. In addition, the responding party must 
sign some interrogatory answers under oath, as specified by the rule. Answers in amended and 
supplemental responses must be signed by the party under oath only if the original answers were 
required to be signed under oath. The failure to sign or verify answers is only a formal defect that 
does not otherwise impair the answers unless the party refuses to sign or verify the answers after

the defect is pointed out.     
 

RULE 198.    REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS 
 

198.1  Request for Admissions. 
A party may serve on another party - no later than 30 days before the end of the discovery period 
-written requests that the other party admit the truth of any matter within the scope of discovery, 
including statements of opinion or of fact or of the application of law to fact, or the genuineness 
of any documents served with the request or otherwise made available for inspection and copying. 
Each matter for which an admission is requested must be stated separately. 

98.2  Response to Requests for Admissions. 

Time for response.    The responding party must serve a written response on the requesting 
party within 30 days after service of the request. 

Content  of  response.    Unless  the  responding  party  states  an  objection  or  asserts  a 
privilege, the responding party must specifically admit or deny the request or explain in 
detail the reasons that the responding party cannot admit or deny the request. A response 
must fairly meet the substance of the request. The responding party may qualify an answer, 
or deny a request in part, only when good faith requires. Lack of information or knowledge 
is not a proper response unless the responding party states that a reasonable inquiry was 
made  but  that  the  information  known  or  easily  obtainable  is  insufficient  to  enable  the 
responding party to admit or deny. An assertion that the request presents an issue for trial 
is not a proper response. 

Effect of failure to respond.    If a response is not timely served, the request is considered 
admitted without the necessity of a court order. 

98.3  Effect of Admissions; Withdrawal or Amendment. 

ny admission made by a party under this rule may be used solely in the pending action and not 
in any other proceeding. A matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established as to the 
party making the admission unless the court permits the party to withdraw or amend the admission. 
The court may permit the party to withdraw or amend the admission if: 
 

(a) 

the party shows good cause for the withdrawal or amendment; and 

(b) 

the court finds that the parties relying upon the responses and deemed admissions 
will not be unduly prejudiced and that the presentation of the merits of the action 
will be subserved by permitting the party to amend or withdraw the admission.

RULE 199.    DEPOSITIONS UPON ORAL EXAMINATION 
 

199.1  Oral Examination; Alternative Methods of Conducting or Recording. 

Generally.    A party may take the testimony of any person or entity by deposition on oral 
examination  before  any  officer  authorized  by  law  to  take  depositions.  The  testimony, 
objections, and any other statements during the deposition must be recorded at the time 
they are given or made. 

Depositions by telephone or other remote electronic means.    A party may take an oral 
deposition by telephone or other remote electronic means if the party gives reasonable prior 
written notice of intent to do so. For the purposes of these rules, an oral deposition taken 
by telephone or other remote electronic means is considered as having been taken in the 
district and at the place where the witness is located when answering the questions.   

Non-stenographic recording.    Any party may cause a deposition upon oral examination 
to be recorded by other than stenographic means, including videotape recording. The party 
requesting  the  non-stenographic  recording  will  be  responsible  for  obtaining  a  person 
authorized  by  law  to  administer  the  oath  and  for  assuring  that  the  recording  will  be 
intelligible, accurate, and trustworthy. At least five days prior to the deposition, the party 
must  serve  on  the  witness  and  all  parties  a  notice,  either  in  the  notice  of  deposition  or 
separately,  that  the  deposition  will  be  recorded  by  other  than  stenographic  means.  This 
notice must state the method of non-stenographic recording to be used and whether the 
deposition will also be recorded stenographically. Any other party may then serve written 
notice designating another method of recording in addition to the method specified, at the 
expense of such other party unless the court orders otherwise. 

99.2  Procedure for Noticing Oral Depositions. 

a) 

Time to notice deposition.    A notice of intent to take an oral deposition must be served 
on  the  witness  and  all  parties  a  reasonable  time  before  the  deposition  is  taken.  An  oral 
deposition may be taken outside the discovery period only by agreement of the parties or 
with leave of court. 

b) 

Content of notice. 

(1) 

Identity  of  witness;  organizations.    The  notice  must  state  the  name  of  the 
witness,  which  may  be  either  an  individual  or  a  public  or  private  corporation, 
partnership,  association,  governmental  agency,  or  other  organization.  If  an 
organization  is  named  as  the  witness,  the  notice  must  describe  with  reasonable 
particularity  the  matters  on  which  examination  is  requested.  In  response,  the 
organization named in the notice must - a reasonable time before the deposition - 
designate  one  or  more individuals  to  testify  on its  behalf  and  set  forth,  for  each 
individual  designated,  the  matters  on  which  the  individual  will  testify.  Each 
individual  designated  must  testify  as  to  matters  that  are  known  or  reasonably 
available to the organization. This subdivision does not preclude taking a deposition 

a) 

  (

b) 

  (

c) 

  (

  1

  (

  (

 

 

Page  138 

by any other procedure authorized by these rules. 

(2) 

Time and place.    The notice must state a reasonable time and place for the oral 
deposition. The place may be in: 

(A) 

the county of the witness's residence; 

(B) 

(C) 

(D) 

the county where the witness is employed or regularly transacts business in 
person; 

the county of suit, if the witness is a party or a person designated by a party 
under Rule 199.2(b)(1); 

the county where the witness was served with the subpoena, or within 150 
miles of the place of service, if the witness is not a resident of Texas or is a 
transient person; or 

(E) 

subject to the foregoing, at any other convenient place directed by the court 
in which the cause is pending. 

(3) 

(4) 

(5) 

Alternative means of conducting and recording.    The notice must state whether 
the  deposition is to be taken by telephone or other  remote electronic  means and 
identify the means. If the deposition is to be recorded by nonstenographic means, 
the notice may include the notice required by Rule 199.1(c). 

Additional attendees.    The notice may include the notice concerning additional 
attendees required by Rule 199.5(a)(3). 

Request for production of documents.    A notice may include a request that the 
witness produce at the deposition documents or tangible things within the scope of 
discovery and within the witness's possession, custody, or control. If the witness is 
a nonparty, the request must comply with Rule 205 and the designation of materials 
required to be identified in the subpoena must be attached to, or included in, the 
notice. The nonparty's response to the request is governed by Rules 176 and 205. 
When the witness is a party or subject to the control of a party, document requests 
under this subdivision are governed by Rules 193 and 196. 

99.3  Compelling Witness to Attend. 

  party  may  compel  the  witness  to  attend  the  oral  deposition  by  serving  the  witness  with  a 
subpoena under Rule 176. If the witness is a party or is retained by, employed by, or otherwise 
subject to the control of a party, however, service of the notice of oral deposition upon the party's 
attorney has the same effect as a subpoena served on the witness. 

99.4  Objections to Time and Place of Oral Deposition. 

Page  139 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  1

  A

  1

 

 

A party or witness may object to the time and place designated for an oral deposition by motion 
for protective order or by motion to quash the notice of deposition. If the motion is filed by the 
third business day after service of the notice of deposition, an objection to the time and place of a 
deposition stays the oral deposition until the motion can be determined. 

99.5  Examination, Objection, and Conduct During Oral Depositions. 

a) 

Attendance. 

(1)  Witness.    The  witness  must  remain  in  attendance  from  day  to  day  until  the 

deposition is begun and completed. 

(2) 

(3) 

Attendance by party.    A party may attend an oral deposition in person, even if 
the  deposition  is  taken  by  telephone  or  other  remote  electronic  means.  If  a 
deposition  is  taken  by  telephone  or  other  remote  electronic  means,  the  party 
noticing the deposition must make arrangements  for all persons to attend  by the 
same means. If the party noticing the deposition appears in person, any other party 
may appear by telephone or other remote electronic means if that party makes the 
necessary  arrangements  with  the  deposition  officer  and  the  party  noticing  the 
deposition. 

Other attendees.    If any party intends to have in attendance any persons other than 
the  witness,  parties,  spouses  of  parties,  counsel,  employees  of  counsel,  and  the 
officer  taking  the  oral  deposition,  that  party  must  give  reasonable  notice  to  all 
parties, either in the notice of deposition or separately, of the identity of the other 
persons. 

Oath; examination.    Every person whose deposition is taken by oral examination must 
first be placed under oath. The parties may examine and cross-examine the witness. Any 
party, in lieu of participating in the examination, may serve written questions in a sealed 
envelope on the party noticing the oral deposition, who must deliver them to the deposition 
officer, who must open the envelope and propound them to the witness. 

Time limitation.    No side may examine or cross-examine an individual witness for more 
than six hours. Breaks during depositions do not count against this limitation. 

Conduct  during  the  oral  deposition;  conferences.    The  oral  deposition  must  be 
conducted in the same manner as if the testimony were being obtained in court during trial. 
Counsel  should  cooperate  with  and  be  courteous  to  each  other  and  to  the  witness.  The 
witness  should  not  be  evasive  and  should  not  unduly  delay  the  examination.  Private 
conferences between the witness and the witness's attorney during the actual taking of the 
deposition are improper except for the purpose of determining whether a privilege should 
be  asserted.  Private  conferences  may  be  held,  however,  during  agreed  recesses  and 
adjournments. If the lawyers and witnesses do not comply with this rule, the court may 
allow in evidence at trial statements, objections, discussions, and other occurrences during 
the oral deposition that reflect upon the credibility of the witness or the testimony.

Objections.    Objections to questions during the oral deposition are limited to "Objection, 
leading"  and  "Objection,  form."  Objections  to  testimony  during  the  oral  deposition  are 
limited  to  "Objection,  non-responsive."  These  objections  are  waived  if  not  stated  as 
phrased  during  the  oral  deposition.  All  other  objections  need  not  be  made  or  recorded 
during the oral deposition to be later raised with the court. The objecting party must give a 
clear  and  concise  explanation  of  an  objection  if  requested  by  the  party  taking  the  oral 
deposition,  or  the  objection  is  waived.  Argumentative  or  suggestive  objections  or 
explanations waive objection and may be grounds for terminating the oral deposition or 
assessing costs or other sanctions. The officer taking the oral deposition will not rule on 
objections  but  must  record  them  for  ruling  by  the  court.  The  officer  taking  the  oral 
deposition must not fail to record testimony because an objection has been made. 

Instructions not to answer.    An attorney may instruct a witness not to answer a question 
during an oral deposition only if necessary to preserve a privilege, comply with a court 
order or these rules, protect a witness from an abusive question or one for which any answer 
would be misleading, or secure a ruling pursuant to paragraph (g). The attorney instructing 
the  witness  not  to  answer  must  give  a  concise,  non-argumentative,  non-suggestive 
explanation  of  the  grounds  for  the  instruction  if  requested  by  the  party  who  asked  the 
question. 

Suspending the deposition.    If the time limitations for the deposition have expired or the 
deposition is being conducted or defended in violation of these rules, a party or witness 
may suspend the oral deposition for the time necessary to obtain a ruling. 

Good faith required.    An attorney must not ask a question at an oral deposition solely to 
harass or mislead the witness, for any other improper purpose, or without a good faith legal 
basis at the time. An attorney must not object to a question at an oral deposition, instruct 
the witness not to answer a question, or suspend the deposition unless there is a good faith 
factual and legal basis for doing so at the time. 

99.6  Hearing on Objections. 

ny party may, at any reasonable time, request a hearing on an objection or privilege asserted by 
an  instruction  not  to  answer  or  suspension  of  the  deposition;  provided  the  failure  of  a  party  to 
obtain a ruling prior to trial does not waive any objection or privilege. The party seeking to avoid 
discovery  must  present  any  evidence  necessary  to  support  the  objection  or  privilege  either  by 
testimony at the hearing or by affidavits served on opposing parties at least seven days before the 
hearing. If the court determines that an in camera review of some or all of the requested discovery 
is necessary to rule, answers to the deposition questions may be made in camera, to be transcribed 
and sealed in the event the privilege is sustained, or made in an affidavit produced to the court in 
a sealed wrapper.

Rule 199.2(b)(5) incorporates the procedures and limitations applicable to requests 
for production or inspection under Rule 196, including the 30-day deadline for responses, as well 
as the procedures and duties imposed by Rule 193. 

For purposes of Rule 199.5(c), each person designated by an organization under 

Rule 199.2(b)(1) is a separate witness. 

. 

The requirement of Rule 199.5(d) that depositions be conducted in the same manner 
as  if  the  testimony  were  being  obtained  in  court  is  a  limit  on  the  conduct  of  the  lawyers  and 
witnesses in the deposition, not on the scope of the interrogation permitted by Rule 192. 

. 

An objection to the form of a question includes objections that the question calls 
for speculation, calls for a narrative answer, is vague, is confusing, or is ambiguous. Ordinarily, a 
witness must answer a question at a deposition subject to the objection. An objection may therefore 
be inadequate if a question incorporates such unfair assumptions or is worded so that any answer 
would necessarily be misleading. A witness should not be required to answer whether he has yet 
ceased  conduct  he  denies  ever  doing,  subject  to  an  objection  to  form  (i.e.,  that  the  question  is 
confusing or assumes facts not in evidence) because any answer would necessarily be misleading 
on account of the way in which the question is put. The witness may be instructed not to answer. 
Abusive questions include questions that inquire into matters clearly beyond the scope of discovery 
or that are argumentative, repetitious, or harassing.

the Texas Government Code governing the administration of oaths by court reporters.     

[RULE 200.    Repealed effective January 1, 1999; see, Rule 199.1 et seq.] 

RULE 200.    DEPOSITIONS UPON WRITTEN QUESTIONS 
 

200.1  Procedure for Noticing Deposition Upon Written Questions. 

a)  Who may be noticed; when.    A party may take the testimony of any person or entity by 
deposition on written questions before any person authorized by law to take depositions on 
written questions. A notice of intent to take the deposition must be served on the witness 
and  all  parties  at  least  20  days  before  the  deposition  is  taken.  A  deposition  on  written 
questions may be taken outside the discovery period only by agreement of the parties or 
with leave of court. The party noticing the deposition must also deliver to the deposition 
officer a copy of the notice and of all written questions to be asked during the deposition. 

Content  of  notice.    The  notice  must  comply  with  Rules  199.1(b),  199.2(b),  and 
199.5(a)(3).  If  the  witness  is  an  organization,  the  organization  must  comply  with  the 
requirements of that provision. The notice also may include a request for production of 
documents  as  permitted  by  Rule  199.2(b)(5),  the  provisions  of  which  will  govern  the 
request, service, and response.

200.2  Compelling Witness to Attend. 

  party  may  compel  the  witness  to  attend  the  deposition  on  written  questions  by  serving  the 
witness with a subpoena under Rule 176. If the witness is a party or is retained by, employed by, 
or otherwise subject to the control of a party, however, service of the deposition notice upon the 
party's attorney has the same effect as a subpoena served on the witness. 

00.3  Questions and Objections. 

Direct questions.    The direct questions to be propounded to the witness must be attached 
to the notice. 

Objections  and  additional  questions.    Within  ten  days  after  the  notice  and  direct 
questions are served, any party may object to the direct questions and serve cross-questions 
on all other parties. Within five days after cross-questions are served, any party may object 
to the cross-questions and serve redirect questions on all other parties. Within three days 
after redirect questions are served, any party may object to the redirect questions and serve 
re-cross  questions  on  all  other  parties.  Objections  to  re-cross  questions  must  be  served 
within five days after the earlier of when re-cross questions are served or the time of the 
deposition on written questions. 

Objections to form of questions.    Objections to the form of a question are waived unless 
asserted in accordance with this subdivision. 

00.4  Conducting the Deposition Upon Written Questions. 

he  deposition  officer  must:  take  the  deposition  on  written  questions  at  the  time  and  place 
designated;  record  the  testimony  of  the  witness  under  oath  in  response  to  the  questions;  and 
prepare, certify, and deliver the deposition transcript in accordance with Rule 203. The deposition 
officer has authority when necessary to summon and swear an interpreter to facilitate the taking of 
the deposition. 
 

Notes and Comments 

omments to 1999 change:   

1. 

The procedures for asserting objections during oral depositions under Rule 199.5(e) 

do not apply to depositions on written questions.   

. 

Section 20.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code provides that a deposition 
on written questions of a witness who is alleged to reside or to be in this state may be taken by a 
clerk of a district court, a judge or clerk of a county court, or a notary public of this state.

RULE 201.    DEPOSITIONS IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS FOR USE IN TEXAS 
PROCEEDINGS; DEPOSITIONS IN TEXAS FOR USE IN FOREIGN PROCEEDINGS
 

201.1  Depositions in Foreign Jurisdictions for Use in Texas Proceedings. 

 
Generally.    A party may take a deposition on oral examination or written questions of any 
person or entity located in another state or a foreign country for use in proceedings in this 
State. The deposition may be taken by: 

a) 

  (

(1) 

notice; 

(2) 

letter rogatory, letter of request, or other such device; 

(3) 

agreement of the parties; or 

(4) 

court order. 

By notice.    A party may take the deposition by notice in accordance with these rules as if 
the deposition were taken in this State, except that the deposition officer may be a person 
authorized to administer oaths in the place where the deposition is taken. 

By letter rogatory.    On motion by a party, the court in which an action is pending must 
issue a  letter rogatory  on  terms  that are just and appropriate, regardless of whether any 
other manner of obtaining the deposition is impractical or inconvenient. The letter must: 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

be addressed to the appropriate authority in the jurisdiction in which the deposition 
is to be taken; 

request and authorize that authority to summon the witness before the authority at 
a time and place stated in the letter for examination on oral or written questions; 
and 

request and authorize that authority to cause the witness's testimony to be reduced 
to writing and returned, together with any items marked as exhibits, to the party 
requesting the letter rogatory. 

By letter of request or other such device.    On motion by a party, the court in which an 
action is pending, or the clerk of that court, must issue a letter of request or other such 
device in accordance with an applicable treaty or international convention on terms that are 
just and appropriate. The letter or other device must be issued regardless of whether any 
other manner of obtaining the deposition is impractical or inconvenient. The letter or other 
device must: 

(1) 

be in the form prescribed by the treaty or convention under which it is issued, as 
presented by the movant to the court or clerk; and 

 

 

 

 

  (

b) 

c) 

d) 

  (

Page  144 

(2) 

must state the time, place, and manner of the examination of the witness. 

Objections  to  form  of  letter  rogatory,  letter  of  request,  or  other  such  device.    In 
issuing a letter rogatory, letter of request, or other such device, the court must set a time 
for objecting to the form of the device. A party must make any objection to the form of the 
device  in  writing  and  serve  it  on  all  other  parties  by  the  time  set  by  the  court,  or  the 
objection is waived. 

Admissibility of evidence.    Evidence obtained in response to a letter rogatory, letter of 
request,  or  other  such  device  is  not  inadmissible  merely  because  it  is  not  a  verbatim 
transcript, or the testimony was not taken under oath, or for any similar departure from the 
requirements for depositions taken within this State under these rules. 

Deposition by electronic means.    A deposition in another jurisdiction may be taken by 
telephone, video conference, teleconference, or other electronic means under the provisions 
of Rule 199. 

01.2  Depositions in Texas for Use in Proceedings in Foreign Jurisdictions. 

f a court of record of any other state or foreign jurisdiction issues a mandate, writ, or commission 
that  requires  a  witness's  oral  or  written  deposition  testimony  in  this  State,  the  witness  may  be 
compelled  to  appear  and  testify  in  the  same  manner  and  by  the  same  process  used  for  taking 
testimony in a proceeding pending in this State. 
 

Notes and Comments 

omments to 1999 change:   

1. 

Rule 201.1 sets forth procedures for obtaining deposition testimony of a witness in 
another  state  or  foreign  jurisdiction  for  use  in  Texas  court  proceedings.  It  does  not,  however, 
address whether any of the procedures listed are, in fact, permitted or recognized by the law of the 
state  or  foreign  jurisdiction  where  the  witness  is  located.  A  party  must  first  determine  what 
procedures are permitted by the jurisdiction where the witness is located before using this rule.   

. 

Section 20.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code provides a nonexclusive 
list of persons who are qualified to take a written deposition in Texas and who may take depositions 
(oral or written) in another state or outside the United States. 

Rule 201.2 is based on Section 20.002 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code.

examination or written questions either: 
 

(a) 

to perpetuate or obtain the person's own testimony or that of any other person for 
use in an anticipated suit; or 

(b) 

to investigate a potential claim or suit. 

02.2  Petition 

he petition must: 

(a) 

be verified; 

(b) 

be filed in a proper court of any county: 

(1) 

where venue of the anticipated suit may lie, if suit is anticipated; or 

(2) 

where the witness resides, if no suit is yet anticipated; 

(c) 

be in the name of the petitioner; 

(d) 

state either: 

(1) 

(2) 

(1) 

(2)

therein; 

(f) 

if suit is anticipated, either:

petitioner's reasons for desiring to obtain the testimony of each; and 

(h) 

request an order authorizing the petitioner to take the depositions of the persons 
named in the petition. 

a) 

Personal service on witnesses and persons named.    At least 15 days before the date of 
the hearing on the petition, the petitioner must serve the petition and a notice of the hearing 
- in accordance  with  Rule 21a - on all persons petitioner  seeks to  depose and, if suit is 
anticipated, on all persons petitioner expects to have interests adverse to petitioner's in the 
anticipated suit. 

(1)  Manner.    Unnamed persons described in the petition whom the petitioner expects 
to have interests adverse to petitioner's in the anticipated suit, if any, may be served 
by publication with the petition and notice of the hearing. The notice must state the 
place for the hearing and the time it will be held, which must be more than 14 days 
after the first publication of the notice. The petition and notice must be published 
once each week for two consecutive weeks in the newspaper of broadest circulation 
in the county in which the petition is filed, or if no such newspaper exists, in the 
newspaper  of  broadest  circulation  in  the  nearest  county  where  a  newspaper  is 
published. 

Objection to depositions taken on notice by publication.    Any interested party 
may move, in the proceeding or by bill of review, to suppress any deposition, in 
whole or in part, taken on notice by publication, and may also attack or oppose the 
deposition by any other means available. 

Service in probate cases.    A petition to take a deposition in anticipation of an application 
for probate of a will, and notice of the hearing on the petition, may be served by posting as 
prescribed  by  Section  33(f)(2)  of  the  Probate  Code.  The  notice  and  petition  must  be 
directed  to  all  parties  interested  in  the  testator's  estate  and  must  comply  with  the 
requirements of Section 33(c) of the Probate Code insofar as they may be applicable. 

2) 

  (

c) 

  (

d)  Modification  by  order.    As  justice or necessity may  require,  the court may shorten or 
lengthen  the  notice  periods  under  this  rule  and  may  extend  the  notice  period  to  permit 
service on any expected adverse party. 

b) 

Service by publication on persons not named.   

02.3  Notice and Service. 

02.4  Order. 

a) 

Required findings.    The court must order a deposition to be taken if, but only if, it finds 
that: 

(1) 

allowing the petitioner to  take  the requested deposition may prevent a failure or 

Page  147 

 

  2

  (

  (

 

  (

  2

  (

 

 

delay of justice in an anticipated suit; or 

(2) 

the  likely  benefit  of  allowing  the  petitioner  to  take  the  requested  deposition  to 
investigate a potential claim outweighs the burden or expense of the procedure. 

 
Contents.    The order must state whether a deposition will be taken on oral examination 
or written questions. The order may also state the time and place at which a deposition will 
be taken. If the order does not state the time and place at which a deposition will be taken, 
the petitioner must notice the deposition as required by Rules 199 or 200. The order must 
contain any protections the court finds necessary or appropriate to protect the witness or 
any person who may be affected by the procedure. 

02.5  Manner of Taking and Use. 

xcept as otherwise provided in this rule, depositions authorized by this rule are governed by the 
rules  applicable  to  depositions  of  non-parties  in  a  pending  suit.  The  scope  of  discovery  in 
depositions authorized by this rule is the same as if the anticipated suit or potential claim had been 
filed. A court may restrict or prohibit the use of a deposition taken under this rule in a subsequent 
suit to protect a person who was not served with notice of the deposition from any unfair prejudice 
or to prevent abuse of this rule. 
 

Notes and Comments 

omments to 1999 change:   

1. 

This  rule  applies  to  all  discovery  before  suit  covered  by  former  rules governing 

depositions to perpetuate testimony and bills of discovery. 

. 

A deposition taken under this rule may be used in a subsequent suit as permitted by 
the rules of evidence, except that a court may restrict or prohibit its use to prevent taking unfair 
advantage of a witness or others. The bill of discovery procedure, which Rule 202 incorporates, is 
equitable in nature, and a court must not permit it to be used inequitably.

DEPOSITIONS
 

203.1  Signature and Changes. 

 

Deposition transcript to be provided to witness.    The deposition officer must provide 
the  original  deposition  transcript  to  the  witness  for  examination  and  signature.  If  the

(b) 

Changes by witness; signature.    The witness may change responses as reflected in the 
deposition transcript by indicating the desired changes, in writing, on a separate sheet of 
paper,  together  with a  statement  of the  reasons for  making  the  changes.  No  erasures  or 
obliterations of any kind may be made to the original deposition transcript. The witness 
must then sign the transcript under oath and return it to the deposition officer. If the witness 
does  not  return  the  transcript  to  the  deposition  officer  within  20  days  of  the  date  the 
transcript was provided to the witness or the witness's attorney, the witness may be deemed 
to have waived the right to make the changes. 

c) 

Exceptions.    The requirements of presentation and signature under this subdivision do not 
apply: 

(1) 

if the witness and all parties waive the signature requirement; 

(2) 

to depositions on written questions; or 

(3) 

to non-stenographic recordings of oral depositions. 

03.2  Certification. 

he  deposition  officer  must  file  with  the  court,  serve  on  all  parties,  and  attach  as  part  of  the 
deposition transcript or non-stenographic recording of an oral deposition a certificate duly sworn 
by the officer stating: 
 

that  the  witness  was  duly  sworn  by  the  officer  and  that  the  transcript  or  non-
stenographic recording of the oral deposition is a true record of the testimony given 
by the witness; 

(a) 

(b) 

that the deposition transcript, if any, was submitted to the witness or to the attorney 
for the witness for examination and signature, the date on which the transcript was 
submitted, whether the witness returned the transcript, and if so, the date on which 
it was returned. 

(c) 

that changes, if any, made by the witness are attached to the deposition transcript; 

(d) 

that the deposition officer delivered the deposition transcript or nonstenographic 
recording of an oral deposition in accordance with Rule 203.3; 

(e) 

the amount of time used by each party at the deposition; 

(f) 

the amount of the deposition officer's charges for preparing the original deposition 
transcript, which the clerk of the court must tax as costs; and 

(g) 

that a copy of the certificate was served on all parties and the date of service. 

03.3  Delivery.

Endorsement; to whom delivered.    The deposition officer must endorse the title of the 
action and "Deposition of  (name of witness)" on the original deposition transcript (or a 
copy, if the original was not returned) or the original nonstenographic recording of an oral 
deposition, and must return: 

(1) 

the transcript to the party who asked the first question appearing in the transcript, 
or 

the recording to the party who requested it. 

(2) 
 
Notice.    The deposition officer must serve notice of delivery on all other parties. 

Inspection and copying; copies.    The party receiving the original deposition transcript or 
non-stenographic recording must make it available upon reasonable request for inspection 
and copying by any other party. Any party or the witness is entitled to obtain a copy of the 
deposition  transcript  or  non-stenographic  recording  from  the  deposition  officer  upon 
payment of a reasonable fee. 

03.4  Exhibits. 

t the request of a party, the original documents and things produced for inspection during the 
examination of the witness must be marked for identification by the deposition officer and annexed 
to the deposition transcript or non-stenographic recording. The person producing the materials may 
produce  copies  instead  of  originals  if  the  party  gives  all  other  parties  fair  opportunity  at  the 
deposition to compare the copies with the originals. If the person offers originals rather than copies, 
the deposition officer must, after the conclusion of the deposition, make copies to be attached to 
the original deposition transcript or non-stenographic recording, and then return the originals to 
the person who produced them. The person who produced the originals must preserve them for 
hearing or trial and make them available for inspection or copying by any other party upon seven 
days' notice. Copies annexed to the original deposition transcript or non-stenographic recording 
may be used for all purposes. 

03.5  Motion to Suppress. 

  party  may  object  to  any  errors  and  irregularities  in  the  manner  in  which  the  testimony  is 
transcribed, signed, delivered, or otherwise dealt with by the deposition officer by filing a motion 
to suppress all or part of the deposition. If the deposition officer complies with Rule 203.3 at least 
one day before the case is called to trial, with regard to a deposition transcript, or 30 days before 
the case is called to trial, with regard to a non-stenographic recording, the party must file and serve 
a motion to suppress before trial commences to preserve the objections. 

03.6  Use. 

Non-stenographic recording; transcription.    A non-stenographic recording of an oral 
deposition, or a written transcription of all or part of such a recording, may be used to the

same extent as a deposition taken by stenographic means. However, the court, for good 
cause shown, may require that the party seeking to use a non-stenographic recording or 
written transcription first obtain a complete transcript of the deposition recording from a 
certified court reporter. The court reporter's transcription must be made from the original 
or  a  certified  copy  of  the  deposition  recording.  The  court  reporter  must,  to  the  extent 
applicable,  comply  with  the  provisions  of  this  rule,  except  that  the  court  reporter  must 
deliver  the  original  transcript  to  the  attorney  requesting  the  transcript,  and  the  court 
reporter's certificate must include a statement that the transcript is a true record of the non-
stenographic  recording.  The  party  to  whom  the  court  reporter  delivers  the  original 
transcript must make the transcript available, upon reasonable request, for inspection and 
copying by the witness or any party.

(1) 

(2) 

when the mental or physical condition (including the blood group) of a party, or of 
a person in the custody, conservatorship or under the legal control of a party, is in 
controversy; or 

except as provided in Rule 204.4, an examination by a psychologist may be ordered 
when  the  party  responding  to  the  motion  has  designated  a  psychologist  as  a 
testifying expert or has disclosed a psychologist's records for possible use at trial. 

Requirements of order.    The order must be in writing and must specify the time, place, 
manner, conditions, and scope of the examination and the person or persons by whom it is 
to be made.

Right to report.    Upon request of the person ordered to be examined, the party causing 
the examination to be made must deliver to the person a copy of a detailed written report 
of the examining physician or psychologist setting out the findings, including results of all 
tests made, diagnoses and conclusions, together with like reports of all earlier examinations 
of the same condition. After delivery of the report, upon request of the party causing the 
examination, the party against whom the order is made must produce a like report of any 
examination made before or after the ordered examination of the same condition, unless 
the person examined is not a party and the party shows that the party is unable to obtain it. 
The court on motion may limit delivery of a report on such terms as are just. If a physician 
or psychologist fails or refuses to make a report the court may exclude the testimony if 
offered at the trial. 

Agreements;  relationship  to  other  rules.    This  subdivision  applies  to  examinations 
made by agreement of the parties, unless the agreement expressly provides otherwise. This 
subdivision  does  not  preclude  discovery  of  a  report  of  an  examining  physician  or 
psychologist or the taking of a deposition of the physician or psychologist in accordance 
with the provisions of any other rule. 

04.3  Effect of No Examination. 

f no examination is sought either by agreement or under this subdivision, the party whose physical 
or mental condition is in controversy must not comment to the court or jury concerning the party's 
willingness to submit to an examination, or on the right or failure of any other party to seek an 
examination.

RULE 215.    ABUSE OF DISCOVERY; SANCTIONS 
 

215.1  Motion for Sanctions or Order Compelling Discovery. 

 party, upon reasonable notice to other parties and all other persons affected thereby, may apply 

for sanctions or an order compelling discovery as follows: 
 

(a) 

Appropriate  court.    On  matters  relating  to  a  deposition,  an  application  for  an 
order to a party may be made to the court in which the action is pending, or to any 
district court in the district where the deposition is being taken. An application for 
an order to a deponent who is not a party shall be made to the court in the district 
where the deposition is being taken. As to all other discovery matters, an application 
for an order will be made to the court in which the action is pending. 

(b)  Motion.     

(1) 

(2) 

If a party or other deponent which is a corporation or other entity fails to 
make a designation under Rules 199.2(b)(1) or 200.1(b); or 

if a party, or other deponent, or a person designated to testify on behalf of a 
party or other deponent fails: 

to appear before the officer who is to take his deposition, after being 
served with a proper notice; or 

to  answer  a  question  propounded  or  submitted  upon  oral 
examination or upon written questions; or 

(3) 

if a party fails: 

(A) 

(B) 

(C) 

(D) 

(A) 

to  serve  answers  or  objections  to  interrogatories  submitted  under 
Rule 197, after proper service of the interrogatories; or 

(B) 

to answer an interrogatory submitted under Rule 197; or 

to  serve  a  written  response  to  a  request  for  inspection  submitted 
under Rule 196, after proper service of the request; or 

to respond that discovery will be permitted as requested or fails to 
permit discovery as requested in response to a request for inspection 
submitted under Rule 196; the discovering party may move for an 
order  compelling  a  designation,  an  appearance,  an  answer  or 
answers, or inspection or production in accordance with the request, 
or apply to the court in which the action is pending for the imposition 
of any sanction authorized by Rule 215.2(b) without the necessity 
of first having obtained a court order compelling such discovery. 

Page  155

(c) 

(d) 

When taking a deposition on oral examination, the proponent of the question may 
complete or adjourn the examination before he applies for an order. 

If the court denies the motion in whole or in part, it may make such protective order 
as it would have been empowered to make on a motion pursuant to Rule 192.6. 

Evasive or incomplete answer.    For purposes of this subdivision an evasive or 
incomplete answer is to be treated as a failure to answer. 

Disposition of motion to compel: award of expenses.    If the motion is granted, 
the  court  shall,  after  opportunity  for  hearing,  require  a  party  or  deponent  whose 
conduct necessitated the motion or the party or attorney advising such conduct or 
both of them  to  pay, at such  time as ordered  by the court, the  moving party the 
reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining the order, including attorney fees, unless 
the court finds that the opposition to the motion was substantially justified or that 
other  circumstances  make  an  award  of  expenses  unjust.  Such  an  order  shall  be 
subject to review on appeal from the final judgment. 

If the motion is denied, the court may, after opportunity for hearing, require the 
moving party or attorney advising such motion to pay to the party or deponent who 
opposed  the  motion  the  reasonable  expenses  incurred  in  opposing  the  motion, 
including attorney fees, unless the court finds that the making of the motion was 
substantially  justified  or  that  other  circumstances  make  an  award  of  expenses 
unjust. 

If  the  motion  is  granted  in  part  and  denied  in  part,  the  court  may  apportion  the 
reasonable  expenses  incurred  in  relation  to  the  motion  among  the  parties  and 
persons in a just manner. 

In determining the amount of reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, to be 
awarded in connection with a motion, the trial court shall award expenses which 
are reasonable in relation to the amount of work reasonably expended in obtaining 
an order compelling compliance or in opposing a motion which is denied. 

(e) 

Providing person's own statement.    If a party fails to comply with any person's 
written request for the person's own statement as provided in Rule 192.3(h), the 
person who made the request may move for an order compelling compliance. If the 
motion is granted, the movant may recover the expenses incurred in obtaining the 
order, including attorney fees, which are reasonable in relation to the amount of 
work reasonably expended in obtaining the order.   

15.2  Failure to Comply with Order or with Discovery Request. 

Sanctions by court in district where deposition is taken.    If a deponent fails to appear 
or to be sworn or to answer a question after being directed to do so by a district court in the 

Page  156 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a)

  (

district in which the deposition is being taken, the failure may be considered a contempt of 
that court. 

Sanctions  by  court  in  which  action  is  pending.    If  a  party  or  an  officer,  director,  or 
managing agent of a party or a person designated under Rules 199.2(b)(1) or 200.1(b) to 
testify on behalf of a party fails to comply with proper discovery requests or to obey an 
order to provide or permit discovery, including an order made under Rules 204 or 215.1, 
the court in which the action is pending may, after notice and hearing, make such orders in 
regard to the failure as are just, and among others the following: 

b) 

  (

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

(5) 

(6) 

(7) 

(8) 

an order disallowing any further discovery of any kind or of a particular kind by 
the disobedient party; 

an order charging all or any portion of the expenses of discovery or taxable court 
costs or both against the disobedient party or the attorney advising him; 

an  order  that  the  matters  regarding  which  the  order  was  made  or  any  other 
designated facts shall be taken to be established for the purposes of the action in 
accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order; 

an order refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose designated 
claims  or  defenses,  or  prohibiting  him  from  introducing  designated  matters  in 
evidence; 

an order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or staying further proceedings until 
the  order  is  obeyed,  or  dismissing  with  or  without  prejudice  the  action  or 
proceedings  or  any  part  thereof,  or  rendering  a  judgment  by  default  against  the 
disobedient party; 

in lieu of any of the foregoing orders or in addition thereto, an order treating as a 
contempt  of  court  the  failure  to  obey  any  orders  except  an  order  to  submit  to  a 
physical or mental examination; 

when a party has failed to comply with an order under Rule 204 requiring him to 
appear or produce another for examination, such orders as are listed in paragraphs 
(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5) of this subdivision, unless the person failing to comply shows 
that he is unable to appear or to produce such person for examination. 

In lieu of any of the foregoing orders or in addition thereto, the court shall require 
the party failing to obey the order or the attorney advising him, or both, to pay, at 
such time as ordered by the court, the reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, 
caused  by  the  failure,  unless  the  court  finds  that  the  failure  was  substantially 
justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust. Such an 
order shall be subject to review on appeal from the final judgment. 

Sanction against nonparty for violation of Rules 196.7 or 205.3.    If a nonparty fails to

  (

comply with an order under Rules 196.7 or 205.3, the court which made the order may treat 
the failure to obey as contempt of court. 

15.3  Abuse of Discovery Process in Seeking, Making, or Resisting Discovery. 
If the court finds a party is abusing the discovery process in seeking, making or resisting discovery 
or if the court finds that any interrogatory or request for inspection or production is unreasonably 
frivolous, oppressive, or harassing, or that a response or answer is unreasonably frivolous or made 
for purposes of delay, then the court in which the action is pending may, after notice and hearing, 
impose any appropriate sanction authorized by paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (8) of Rule 
215.2(b). Such order of sanction shall be subject to review on appeal from the final judgment. 
 

Notes and Comments 

omment to 1990 change: To require notice and hearing before an imposition of sanctions under 

paragraph 3, and to specify that such sanctions be appropriate.   

15.4  Failure to Comply with Rule 198 

a)  Motion.    A party who has requested an admission under Rule 198 may move to determine 
the sufficiency of the answer or objection. For purposes of this subdivision an evasive or 
incomplete answer may be treated as a failure to answer. Unless the court determines that 
an objection is justified, it shall order that an answer be served. If the court determines that 
an answer does not comply with the requirements of Rule 198, it may order either that the 
matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served. The provisions of Rule 215.1(d) 
apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to the motion. 

Expenses on failure to admit.    If a party fails to admit the genuineness of any document 
or  the  truth  of  any  matter  as  requested  under  Rule  198  and  if  the  party  requesting  the 
admissions thereafter proves the genuineness of the document or the truth of the matter, he 
may apply to the court for an order requiring the other party to pay him the reasonable 
expenses incurred in making that proof, including reasonable attorney fees. The court shall 
make the order unless it finds that (1) the request was held objectionable pursuant to Rule 
193, or (2) the admission sought was of no substantial importance, or (3) the party failing 
to admit had a reasonable ground to believe that he might prevail on the matter, or (4) there 
was other good reason for the failure to admit. 

15.5  Failure of Party or Witness to Attend to or Serve Subpoena; Expenses. 

Failure of party giving notice to attend.    If the party giving the notice of the taking of 
an oral deposition fails to attend and proceed therewith and another party attends in person 
or by attorney pursuant to the notice, the court may order the party giving the notice to pay 
such other party the reasonable expenses incurred by him and his attorney in attending, 
including reasonable attorney fees. 

Failure of witness to attend.    If a party gives notice of the taking of an oral deposition of 
a witness and the witness does not attend because of the fault of the party giving the notice, 

  2

  (

 

Page  158 

if another party attends in person or by attorney because he expects the deposition of that 
witness to be taken, the court may order the party giving the notice to pay such other party 
the reasonable expenses incurred by him and his attorney in attending, including reasonable 
attorney fees. 

15.6  Exhibits to Motions and Responses. 

otions  or  responses  made  under  this  rule  may  have  exhibits  attached  including  affidavits, 

discovery pleadings, or any other documents. 
 

Notes and Comments 

omments to  1999  change:  The  references  in this  rule  to  other  discovery  rules  are  changed  to 
reflect the revisions in those rules, and former Rule 203 is added as Rule 215.5 in place of the 
former provision, which is superseded by Rule 193.6. 
 

Section 10. - The Jury in Court 

RULE 216.    REQUEST AND FEE FOR JURY TRIAL 
 

Request.    No jury trial shall be had in any civil suit, unless a written request for a jury 
trial is filed with the clerk of the court a reasonable time before the date set for trial of the 
cause on the non-jury docket, but not less than thirty days in advance. 

Jury Fee.    Unless otherwise provided by law, a fee of ten dollars if in the district court 
and five dollars if in the county court must be deposited with the clerk of the court within 
the  time  for  making  a  written  request  for  a  jury  trial.  The  clerk  shall  promptly  enter  a 
notation of the payment of such fee upon the court's docket sheet. 

Notes and Comments 

omment to 1990 change: Additional fees for jury trials may be required by other law, e.g., Texas 

Government Code § 51.604. 
 

RULE 217.    OATH OF INABILITY 
 
The deposit for a jury fee shall not be required when the party shall within the time for making 
such deposit, file with the clerk his affidavit to the effect that he is unable to make such deposit, 
and that he can not, by the pledge of property or otherwise, obtain the money necessary for that 
purpose; and the court shall then order the clerk to enter the suit on the jury docket. 
 

RULE 218.    JURY DOCKET 
 
The clerks of the district and county courts shall each keep a docket, styled "The Jury Docket," in 
which shall be entered in their order the cases in which jury fees have been paid or affidavit in lieu

thereof has been filed as provided in the two preceding rules. 
 

RULE 219.    JURY TRIAL DAY 
 
The court shall designate the days for taking up the jury docket and the trial of jury cases. Such 
order may be revoked or changed in the court's discretion. 
 

RULE 220.    WITHDRAWING CAUSE FROM JURY DOCKET 
 
When any party has paid the fee for a jury trial, he shall not be permitted to withdraw the cause 
from the jury docket over the objection of the parties adversely interested. If so permitted, the court 
in its discretion may by an order permit him to withdraw also his jury fee deposit. Failure of a 
party to appear for trial shall be deemed a waiver by him of the right to trial by jury.   
 

RULE 221.    CHALLENGE TO THE ARRAY 
 
When the jurors summoned have not been selected by jury commissioners or by drawing the names 
from a jury wheel, any party to a suit which is to be tried by a jury may, before the jury is drawn 
challenge the array upon the ground that the officer summoning the jury has acted corruptly, and 
has wilfully summoned jurors known to be prejudiced against the party challenging or biased in 
favor  of  the  adverse  party.  All  such  challenges  must  be  in  writing  setting  forth  distinctly  the 
grounds of such challenge and supported by the affidavit of the party or some other credible person. 
When such challenge is made, the court shall hear evidence and decide without delay whether or 
not the challenge shall be sustained. 
 

RULE 222.    WHEN CHALLENGE IS SUSTAINED 
 
If the challenge be sustained, the array of jurors summoned shall be discharged, and the court shall 
order other jurors summoned in their stead, and shall direct that the officer who summoned the 
persons so discharged, and on account of whose misconduct the challenge has been sustained, shall 
not summon any other jurors in the case. 
 

RULE 223.    JURY LIST IN CERTAIN COUNTIES 
 
In counties governed as to juries by the laws providing for interchangeable juries, the names of the 
jurors shall be placed upon the general panel in the order in which they are randomly selected, and 
jurors shall be assigned for service from the top thereof, in the order in which they shall be needed, 
and jurors returned to the general panel after service in any of such courts shall be enrolled at the 
bottom of the list in the order of their respective return; provided, however, after such assignment 
to a particular court, the trial judge of such court, upon the demand prior to voir dire examination 
by any party or attorney in the case reached for trial in such court, shall cause the names of all 
members of such assigned jury panel in such case to be placed in a receptacle, shuffled, and drawn, 

 

Page  160 

and such names shall be transcribed in the order drawn on the jury list from which the jury is to be 
selected to try such case. There shall be only one shuffle and drawing by the trial judge in each 
case. 
 

RULE 224.    PREPARING JURY LIST 
 
In counties not governed as to juries by the laws providing for interchangeable juries, when the 
parties have announced ready for trial the clerk shall write the name of each regular juror entered 
of record for that week on separate slips of paper, as near the same size and appearance as may be, 
and shall place the slips in a box and mix them well. The clerk shall draw from the box, in the 
presence of the court, the names of twenty-four jurors, if in the district court, or so many as there 
may be, if there be a less number in the box; and the names of twelve jurors if in the county court, 
or so many as there may be, and write the names as drawn upon two slips of paper and deliver one 
slip to each party to the suit or his attorney. 
 

RULE 225.    SUMMONING TALESMAN 
 
When there are not as many as twenty-four names drawn from the box, if in the district court, or 
as many as twelve, if in the county court, the court shall direct the sheriff to summon such number 
of qualified persons as the court deems necessary to complete the panel. The names of those thus 
summoned shall be placed in the box and drawn and entered upon the slips as provided in the 
preceding rules. 
 

RULE 226.    OATH TO JURY PANEL 
 
Before the parties or their attorneys begin the examination of the jurors whose names have thus 
been listed, the jurors shall be sworn by the court or under its direction, as follows: "You, and each 
of  you,  do  solemnly  swear  that  you  will  true  answers  give  to  all  questions  propounded  to  you 
concerning your qualifications as a juror, so help you God." 
 

RULE 226a. INSTRUCTIONS TO JURY PANEL AND JURY 
 
The  court  must  give  instructions  to  the  jury  panel  and  the  jury  as  prescribed  by  order  of  the 
Supreme Court under this rule. 
 

Notes and Comments 

omment to 2005 change: The rule is clarified. With these amendments, the Supreme Court has 
ordered changes in the prescribed jury instructions consistent with Act of June 2, 2003, 78th Leg.,

Members of the Jury Panel [or Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury Panel]:   
 

Thank you for being here. We are here to select a jury. Twelve [six] of you will be chosen 
for the jury. Even if you are not chosen for the jury, you are performing a valuable service that is 
your right and duty as a citizen of a free country. 
 

Before we begin: Turn off all phones and other electronic devices. While you are in the 
courtroom, do not communicate with anyone through any electronic device.    [For example, do 
not communicate by phone, text message, email message, chat room, blog, or social networking 
websites such as Facebook, Twitter, or Myspace.]    [I will give you a number where others may 
contact  you  in  case  of  an  emergency.]    Do  not  record  or  photograph  any  part  of  these  court 
proceedings, because it is prohibited by law. 
 

If you are chosen for the jury, your role as jurors will be to decide the disputed facts in this 

case.    My role will be to ensure that this case is tried in accordance with the rules of law. 
 

Here is some background about this case. This is a civil case.    It is a lawsuit that is not a 
criminal  case.    The  parties  are  as  follows:  The  plaintiff  is  __________,  and  the  defendant  is 
__________.    Representing  the  plaintiff  is  __________,  and  representing  the  defendant  is 
__________.    They will ask you some questions during jury selection.    But before their questions 
begin, I must give you some instructions for jury selection.   
 

Every juror must obey these instructions.    You may be called into court to testify about 
any violations of these instructions.    If you do not follow these instructions, you will be guilty of 
juror misconduct, and I might have to order a new trial and start this process over again.    This 
would waste your time and the parties’ money, and would require the taxpayers of this county to 
pay for another trial. 

hese are the instructions. 

1.    To avoid looking like you are friendly with one side of the case, do not mingle or talk 
with  the  lawyers,  witnesses,  parties,  or  anyone  else  involved  in  the  case.    You  may  exchange 
casual greetings like “hello” and “good morning.”    Other than that, do not talk with them at all.   
They have to follow these instructions too, so you should not be offended when they follow the 
instructions. 
   

2.    Do not accept any favors from the lawyers, witnesses, parties, or anyone else involved 
in the case, and do not do any favors for them.    This includes favors such as giving rides and food.   
 

3.    Do not discuss this case with anyone, even your spouse or a friend, either in person or 

Page  162 

  T

 

 

by any other means [including by phone, text message, email message, chat room, blog, or social 
networking websites such as Facebook, Twitter, or Myspace].    Do not allow anyone to discuss 
the  case  with  you  or  in  your  hearing.    If  anyone  tries  to  discuss  the  case  with  you  or  in  your 
hearing, tell me immediately.    We do not want you to be influenced by something other than the 
evidence admitted in court. 
 

4.    The  parties,  through  their  attorneys,  have  the  right  to  ask  you  questions  about  your 
background, experiences, and attitudes.    They are not trying to meddle in your affairs.    They are 
just being thorough and trying to choose fair jurors who do not have any bias or prejudice in this 
particular case. 
 

5.    Remember that you took an oath that you will tell the truth, so be truthful when the 
lawyers ask you questions, and always give complete answers.    If you do not answer a question 
that applies to you, that violates your oath.    Sometimes a lawyer will ask a question of the whole 
panel instead of just one person.    If the question applies to you, raise your hand and keep it raised 
until you are called on. 
 

Do you understand these instructions?      If you do not, please tell me now.     

The lawyers will now begin to ask their questions. 

 

II. 

That  the  following  oral  and  written  instructions,  with  such  modifications  as  the 
circumstances  of  the  particular  case  may  require,  shall  be  given  by  the  court  to  the  jury 
immediately after the jurors are selected for the case: 

embers of the Jury [or Ladies and Gentlemen]:   

You have been chosen to serve on this jury.    Because of the oath you have taken and your 
selection  for  the  jury,  you  become  officials  of  this  court  and  active  participants  in  our  justice 
system. 

Hand out the written instructions.] 

You have each received a set of written instructions.    I am going to read them with you 

now.    Some of them you have heard before and some are new. 
 

1.    Turn off all phones and other electronic devices.    While you are in the courtroom and 
while you are deliberating, do not communicate with anyone through any electronic device.    [For 
example, do not communicate by phone, text message, email message, chat room, blog, or social 
networking websites such as Facebook, Twitter, or Myspace.]    [I will give you a number where 
others may contact you in case of an emergency.]    Do not post information about the case on the 
Internet before these court proceedings end and you are released from jury duty.    Do not record 
or photograph any part of these court proceedings, because it is prohibited by law.

2.    To avoid looking like you are friendly with one side of the case, do not mingle or talk 
with  the  lawyers,  witnesses,  parties,  or  anyone  else  involved  in  the  case.    You  may  exchange 
casual greetings like “hello” and “good morning.”    Other than that, do not talk with them at all.   
They have to follow these instructions too, so you should not be offended when they follow the 
instructions. 
 

3.    Do not accept any favors from the lawyers, witnesses, parties, or anyone else involved 
in the case, and do not do any favors for them.    This includes favors such as giving rides and food. 
 

4.    Do not discuss this case with anyone, even your spouse or a friend, either in person or 
by any other means [including by phone, text message, email message, chat room, blog, or social 
networking websites such as Facebook, Twitter, or Myspace].    Do not allow anyone to discuss 
the  case  with  you  or  in  your  hearing.    If  anyone  tries  to  discuss  the  case  with  you  or  in  your 
hearing, tell me immediately.    We do not want you to be influenced by something other than the 
evidence admitted in court.   
 

5.    Do not discuss this case with anyone during the trial, not even with the other jurors, 
until the end of the trial.    You should not discuss the case with your fellow jurors until the end of 
the trial so that you do not form opinions about the case before you have heard everything. 
 

After you have heard all the evidence, received all of my instructions, and heard all of the 
lawyers’ arguments, you will then go to the jury room to discuss the case with the other jurors and 
reach a verdict. 
 

6.    Do not investigate this case on your own.    For example, do not: 

a. 

b. 
c. 
d. 

e. 
f. 

try to get information about the case, lawyers, witnesses, or issues from outside this 
courtroom; 
go to places mentioned in the case to inspect the places; 
inspect items mentioned in this case unless they are presented as evidence in court; 
look anything up in a law book, dictionary, or public record to try to learn more 
about the case;   
look anything up on the Internet to try to learn more about the case; or 
let anyone else do any of these things for you. 

This rule is very important because we want a trial based only on evidence admitted in 
open court.    Your conclusions about this case must be based only on what you see and hear in this 
courtroom because the law does not permit you to base your conclusions on information that has 
not been presented to you in open court.    All the information must be presented in open court so 
the parties and their lawyers can test it and object to it.    Information from other sources, like the 
Internet, will not go through this important process in the courtroom.    In addition, information 
from other sources could be completely unreliable.    As a result, if you investigate this case on 
your own, you could compromise the fairness to all parties in this case and jeopardize the results 
of this trial. 
 

7.    Do not tell other jurors about your own experiences or other people’s experiences.    For 

Page  164 

 

 

 

example, you may have special knowledge of something in the case, such as business, technical, 
or professional information.    You may even have expert knowledge or opinions, or you may know 
what happened in this case or another similar case.    Do not tell the other jurors about it.    Telling 
other jurors about it is wrong because it means the jury will be considering things that were not 
admitted in court. 
 

8.    Do not  consider  attorneys’ fees unless  I tell you to.    Do not  guess about attorneys’ 

9.    Do not consider or guess whether any party is covered by insurance unless I tell you 

fees. 
 

to. 
 

10.    During the trial, if taking notes will help focus your attention on the evidence, you 
may take notes using the materials the court has provided.    Do not use any personal electronic 
devices to take notes.    If taking notes will distract your attention from the evidence, you should 
not take notes.    Your notes are for your own personal use.    They are not evidence.    Do not show 
or read your notes to anyone, including other jurors. 
 

You must leave your notes in the jury room or with the bailiff.    The bailiff is instructed 
not to read your notes and to give your notes to me promptly after collecting them from you.    I 
will make sure your notes are kept in a safe, secure location and not disclosed to anyone.     
 

[You may take your notes back into the jury room and consult them during deliberations.   
But keep in mind that your notes are not evidence.    When you deliberate, each of you should rely 
on your independent recollection of the evidence and not be influenced by the fact that another 
juror has or has not taken notes.    After you complete your deliberations, the bailiff will collect 
your notes.]     

When you are released from jury duty, the bailiff will promptly destroy your notes so that 

nobody can read what you wrote. 
 

11.    I will decide matters of law in this case.    It is your duty to listen to and consider the 
evidence and to determine fact issues that I may submit to you at the end of the trial.    After you 
have heard all the evidence, I will give you instructions to follow as you make your decision.    The 
instructions also will have questions for you to answer.    You will not be asked and you should not 
consider which side will win.    Instead, you will need to answer the specific questions I give you. 
 

Every juror must obey my instructions.    If you do not follow these instructions, you will 
be guilty of juror misconduct, and I may have to order a new trial and start this process over again.   
This would waste your time and the parties’ money, and would require the taxpayers of this county 
to pay for another trial. 
 

Do you understand these instructions?    If you do not, please tell me now. 

Please keep these instructions and review them as we go through this case.    If anyone does 

 

not follow these instructions, tell me.

III.   
Court’s Charge 

Before closing arguments begin, the court must give to each member of the jury a copy of 
the charge, which must include the following written instructions, with such modifications as the 
circumstances of the particular case may require: 

embers of the Jury [or Ladies & Gentlemen of the Jury]:   

After the closing arguments, you will go to the jury room to decide the case, answer the 
questions that are attached, and reach a verdict.    You may discuss the case with other jurors only 
when you are all together in the jury room. 
 

Remember my previous instructions: Do not discuss the case with anyone else, either in 
person or by any other means.      Do not do any independent investigation about the case or conduct 
any  research.    Do  not  look  up  any  words  in  dictionaries  or  on  the  Internet.    Do  not  post 
information about the case on the Internet.    Do not share any special knowledge or experiences 
with  the  other  jurors.    Do  not  use  your  phone  or  any  other  electronic  device  during  your 
deliberations for any reason.    [I will give you a number where others may contact you in case of 
an emergency.] 
 

[Any notes you have taken are for your own personal use.    You may take your notes back 
into the jury room and consult them during deliberations, but do not show or read your notes to 
your fellow jurors during your deliberations.    Your notes are not evidence.      Each of you should 
rely on your independent recollection of the evidence and not be influenced by the fact that another 
juror has or has not taken notes.] 
 

[You must leave your notes with the bailiff when you are not deliberating.    The bailiff will 
give your notes to me promptly after collecting them from you.    I will make sure your notes are 
kept in a safe, secure location and not disclosed to anyone.    After you complete your deliberations, 
the bailiff will collect your notes.    When you are released from jury duty, the bailiff will promptly 
destroy your notes so that nobody can read what you wrote.] 

 

Here are the instructions for answering the questions. 
 

1.    Do not let bias, prejudice, or sympathy play any part in your decision. 

2.    Base your answers only on the evidence admitted in court and on the law that is in these 
instructions and questions.    Do not consider or discuss any evidence that was not admitted in the 
courtroom.   
 

3.    You are to make up your own minds about the facts.    You are the sole judges of the 
credibility of the witnesses and the weight to give their testimony.    But on matters of law, you 
must follow all of my instructions. 
 

4.    If my instructions use a word in a way that is different from its ordinary meaning, use 

 

  M

 

 

 

Page  166 

the meaning I give you, which will be a proper legal definition. 
 

5.    All the questions and answers are important.    No one should say that any question or 

answer is not important. 
 

6.    Answer “yes” or “no” to all questions unless you are told otherwise.    A “yes” answer 
must be based on a preponderance of the evidence [unless you are told otherwise].    Whenever a 
question  requires  an  answer  other  than  “yes”  or  “no,”  your  answer  must  be  based  on  a 
preponderance of the evidence [unless you are told otherwise]. 
 

The term “preponderance of the evidence” means the greater weight of credible evidence 
presented in this case.    If you do not find that a preponderance of the evidence supports a “yes” 
answer, then answer “no.”    A preponderance of the evidence is not measured by the number of 
witnesses or by the number of documents admitted in evidence.      For a fact to be proved by a 
preponderance of the evidence, you must find that the fact is more likely true than not true. 
 

7.    Do not decide who you think should win before you answer the questions and then just 
answer the questions to match your decision.    Answer each question carefully without considering 
who will win.    Do not discuss or consider the effect your answers will have. 
 

8.    Do not answer questions by drawing straws or by any method of chance. 

9.    Some questions might ask you for a dollar amount.    Do not agree in advance to decide 

on a dollar amount by adding up each juror’s amount and then figuring the average. 
 

10.    Do not trade your answers.    For example, do not say, “I will answer this question 

your way if you answer another question my way.” 
 

11.    [Unless  otherwise  instructed]  The  answers  to  the  questions  must  be  based  on  the 
decision of at least 10 of the 12 [5 of the 6] jurors.    The same 10 [5] jurors must agree on every 
answer.    Do not agree to be bound by a vote of anything less than 10 [5] jurors, even if it would 
be a majority. 
 

As I have said before, if you do not follow these instructions, you will be guilty of juror 
misconduct, and I might have to order a new trial and start this process over again.    This would 
waste your time and the parties’ money, and would require the taxpayers of this county to pay for 
another  trial.    If  a  juror  breaks  any  of  these  rules,  tell  that  person  to  stop  and  report  it  to  me 
immediately. 

Definitions,  questions,  and  special  instructions  given  to  the  jury  will  be  transcribed  here.    If 
exemplary damages are sought against a defendant, the jury must unanimously find, with respect 
to that defendant, (i) liability on at least one claim for actual damages that will support an award 
of exemplary damages, (ii) any additional conduct, such as malice or gross negligence, required 
for an award of exemplary damages, and (iii) the amount of exemplary damages to be awarded.   
The jury’s answers to questions regarding (ii) and (iii) must be conditioned on a unanimous finding 
regarding (i), except in an extraordinary circumstance when the conditioning instruction would be 

Page  167 

 

  [

 

erroneous.    The jury need not be unanimous in finding the amount of actual damages.    Thus, if 
questions regarding (ii) and (iii) are submitted to the jury for defendants D1 and D2, instructions 
in substantially the following form must immediately precede such questions: 

receding question (ii): 

nswer Question (ii) for D1 only if you unanimously answered “Yes” to Question[s] (i) regarding 

D1.    Otherwise, do not answer Question (ii) for D1.    [Repeat for D2.] 

ou are instructed that in order to answer “Yes” to [any part of] Question (ii), your answer must 
be unanimous.    You may answer “No” to [any part of] Question (ii) only upon a vote of 10 [5] or 
more jurors.    Otherwise, you must not answer [that part of] Question (ii). 

receding question (iii): 

nswer Question (iii) for D1 only if you answered “Yes” to Question (ii) for D1.    Otherwise, do 

not answer Question (iii) for D1.    [Repeat for D2.] 

ou are instructed that you must unanimously agree on the amount of any award of exemplary 

damages. 

residing Juror: 

hese examples are given by way of illustration.] 

to do is choose a presiding juror.   
 

2.    The presiding juror has these duties:   

1.    When you go into the jury room to answer the questions, the first thing you will need 

 
 

 
 
 
 

a.  have the complete charge read aloud if it will be helpful to your deliberations; 
b.  preside over your deliberations, meaning manage the discussions, and see that you 

follow these instructions; 

c.  give written questions or comments to the bailiff who will give them to the judge; 
d.  write down the answers you agree on; 
e.  get the signatures for the verdict certificate; and 
f.  notify the bailiff that you have reached a verdict. 

Do you understand the duties of the presiding juror?    If you do not, please tell me now. 

nstructions for Signing the Verdict Certificate: 

1.    [Unless otherwise instructed] You may answer the questions on a vote of 10 [5] jurors.   
The same 10 [5] jurors must agree on every answer in the charge.    This means you may not have 
one group of 10 [5] jurors agree on one answer and a different group of 10 [5] jurors agree on

2.    If 10 [5] jurors agree on every answer, those 10 [5] jurors sign the verdict.   

If 11 jurors agree on every answer, those 11 jurors sign the verdict.   

If all 12 [6] of you agree on every answer, you are unanimous and only the presiding juror 

3.    All jurors should deliberate on every question.    You may end up with all 12 [6] of you 
agreeing on some answers, while only 10 [5] or 11 of you agree on other answers.    But when you 
sign the verdict, only those 10 [5] who agree on every answer will sign the verdict.   
 

4.    [Added  if  the  charge  requires  some  unanimity]  There  are  some  special  instructions 
before  Questions  _______  explaining  how  to  answer  those  questions.    Please  follow  the 
instructions.    If  all  12  [6]  of  you  answer  those  questions,  you  will  need  to  complete  a  second 
verdict certificate for those questions. 
 

Do you understand these instructions?    If you do not, please tell me now.

IV. 

That the following oral instructions shall be given by the court to the jury after the verdict 

has been accepted by the court and before the jurors are released from jury duty: 
 

Thank you for your verdict.   

I have told you that the only time you may discuss the case is with the other jurors in the 
jury room.    I now release you from jury duty.    Now you may discuss the case with anyone.    But 
you may also choose not to discuss the case; that is your right. 
 

After you are released from jury duty, the lawyers and others may ask you questions to see 
if the jury followed the instructions, and they may ask you to give a sworn statement.    You are 
free to discuss the case with them and to give a sworn statement.    But you may choose not to 
discuss the case and not to give a sworn statement; that is your right.

RULE 227.    CHALLENGE TO JUROR 
 
A challenge to a particular juror is either a challenge for cause or a peremptory challenge. The 
court shall decide without delay any such challenge, and if sustained, the juror shall be discharged 
from the particular case. Either such challenge may be made orally on the formation of a jury to 
try the case. 

RULE 228.    "CHALLENGE FOR CAUSE" DEFINED 
 
A challenge for cause is an objection made to a juror, alleging some fact which by law disqualifies 
him to serve as a juror in the case or in any case, or which in the opinion of the court, renders him 
an  unfit  person  to  sit  on  the  jury.  Upon  such  challenge  the  examination  is  not  confined  to  the 
answers of the juror, but other evidence may be heard for or against the challenge. 
 

RULE 229.    CHALLENGE FOR CAUSE 
 
When twenty-four or more jurors, if in the district court, or twelve or more, if in the county court, 
are drawn, and the lists of their names delivered to the parties, if either party desires to challenge 
any juror for cause, the challenge shall then be made. The name of a juror challenged and set aside 
for cause shall be erased from such lists. 
 

RULE 230.    CERTAIN QUESTIONS NOT TO BE ASKED 
 
In examining a juror, he shall not be asked a question the answer to which may show that he has 
been  convicted  of  an  offense  which  disqualifies  him,  or  that  he  stands  charged  by  some  legal 
accusation with theft or any felony. 
 

RULE 231.    NUMBER REDUCED BY CHALLENGES 
 
If the challenges reduce the number of jurors to less than twenty-four, if in the district court, or to 
less than twelve, if in the county court, the court shall order other jurors to be drawn from the 
wheel or from the central jury panel or summoned, as the practice may be in the particular county, 
and their names written upon the list instead of those set aside for cause. Such jurors so summoned 
may likewise be challenged for cause. 
 

RULE 232.    MAKING PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES 
 
If there remain on such lists not subject to challenge for cause, twenty-four names, if in the district 
court, or twelve names, if in the county court, the parties shall proceed to make their peremptory 
challenges. A peremptory challenge is made to a juror without assigning any reason therefor. 
 

 

Page  171 

RULE 233.    NUMBER OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES 
 
Except as provided below, each party to a civil action is entitled to six peremptory challenges in a 
case tried in the district court, and to three in the county court. 
 

Alignment of the Parties.    In multiple party cases, it shall be the duty of the trial judge to 
decide whether any of the litigants aligned on the same side of the docket are antagonistic 
with respect to any issue to be submitted to the jury, before the exercise of peremptory 
challenges. 

Definition of Side.    The term "side" as used in this rule is not synonymous with "party," 
"litigant,"  or  "person."  Rather,  "side"  means  one  or  more  litigants  who  have  common 
interests on the matters with which the jury is concerned. 

Motion to Equalize.    In multiple party cases, upon motion of any litigant made prior to 
the exercise of peremptory challenges, it shall be the duty of the trial judge to equalize the 
number of peremptory challenges so that no litigant or side is given unfair advantage as a 
result  of  the  alignment  of  the  litigants  and  the  award  of  peremptory  challenges  to  each 
litigant  or  side.  In  determining  how  the  challenges  should  be  allocated  the  court  shall 
consider any matter brought to the attention of the trial judge concerning the ends of justice 
and the elimination of an unfair advantage. 

RULE 234.    LISTS RETURNED TO THE CLERK 
 
When the parties have made or declined to make their peremptory challenges, they shall deliver 
their lists to the clerk. The clerk shall, if the case be in the district court, call off the first twelve 
names on the lists that have not been erased; and if the case be in the county court, he shall call off 
the first six names on the lists that have not been erased; those whose names are called shall be the 
jury. 
 

RULE 235.    IF JURY IS INCOMPLETE

to the evidence submitted to you under the rulings of the court. So help you God."

A.    Appearance and Procedure 
 

RULE 237.    APPEARANCE DAY 
 
If a defendant, who has been duly cited, is by the citation required to answer on a day which is in

such adverse parties shall have fifteen days from the receipt of such notice within which to file an 
answer. No default judgment shall be rendered against a party in a removed action remanded from 
federal court if that party filed an answer in federal court during removal. 
 

Notes and Comments 

omment  to  1990  change:  To  expressly  provide,  consistent  with  existing  law,  that  a  default 
judgment cannot be taken in a case remanded from federal court if an answer was filed in federal 
court during removal.     
 

RULE 238.    CALL OF APPEARANCE DOCKET 
 
On the appearance day of a particular defendant and at the hour named in the citation, or as soon 
thereafter as may be practicable, the court or clerk in open court shall call, in their order, all the

failing therein, any such case shall be so called on request of the plaintiff's attorney. 
 

RULE 239.    JUDGMENT BY DEFAULT 
 
Upon such call of the docket, or at any time after a defendant is required to answer, the plaintiff 
may in term time take judgment by default against such defendant if he has not previously filed an 
answer, and provided that the return of service shall have been on file with the clerk for the length 
of time required by Rule 107.

RULE 239a.    NOTICE OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT 
 
At or immediately prior to the time an interlocutory or final default judgment is rendered, the party 
taking the same or his attorney shall certify to the clerk in writing the last known mailing address 
of the party against whom the judgment is taken, which certificate shall be filed among the papers 
in the cause. Immediately upon the signing of the judgment, the clerk shall mail written notice 
thereof  to  the  party  against  whom  the  judgment  was  rendered  at  the  address  shown  in  the 
certificate, and note the fact of such mailing on the docket. The notice shall state the number and 
style of the case, the court in which the case is pending, the names of the parties in whose favor 
and against whom the judgment was rendered, and the date of the signing of the judgment. Failure 
to comply with the provisions of this rule shall not affect the finality of the judgment. 
 

RULE 240.    WHERE ONLY SOME ANSWER 
 
Where there are several defendants, some of whom have answered or have not been duly served 
and some of whom have been duly served and have made default, an interlocutory judgment by 
default may be entered against those who have made default, and the cause may proceed or be 
postponed as to the others. 
 

RULE 241.    ASSESSING DAMAGES ON LIQUIDATED DEMANDS 
 
When a judgment by default is rendered against the defendant, or all of several defendants, if the 
claim is liquidated and proved by an instrument in writing, the damages shall be assessed by the 
court, or under its direction, and final judgment shall be rendered therefor, unless the defendant 
shall demand and be entitled to a trial by jury. 

[RULE 242.    Repealed effective December 31, 1941] 
 

RULE 243.    UNLIQUIDATED DEMANDS 
 
If the cause of action is unliquidated or be not proved by an instrument in writing, the court shall 
hear evidence as to damages and shall render judgment therefor, unless the defendant shall demand 
and be entitled to a trial by jury in which case the judgment by default shall be noted, a writ of 
inquiry awarded, and the cause entered on the jury docket. 
 

RULE 244.    ON SERVICE BY PUBLICATION 
 
Where service has been made by publication, and no answer has been filed nor appearance entered 

Page  174 

 

   

 

within the prescribed time, the court shall appoint an attorney to defend the suit in behalf of the 
defendant, and judgment shall be rendered as in other cases; but, in every such case a statement of 
the evidence, approved and signed by the judge, shall be filed with the papers of the cause as a 
part of the record thereof. The court shall allow such attorney a reasonable fee for his services, to 
be taxed as part of the costs. 
 

RULE 245.    ASSIGNMENT OF CASES FOR TRIAL 
 
The court may set contested cases on written request of any party, or on the court's own motion, 
with reasonable notice of not less than forty-five days to the parties of a first setting for trial, or by 
agreement of the parties; provided, however, that when a case previously has been set for trial, the 
Court may reset said contested case to a later date on any reasonable notice to the parties or by 
agreement of the parties. Non-contested cases may be tried or disposed of at any time whether set 
or not, and may be set at any time for any other time. 

 request for trial setting constitutes a representation that the requesting party reasonably and in 
good  faith  expects  to  be  ready  for  trial  by  the  date  requested,  but  no  additional  representation 
concerning the completion of pretrial proceedings or of current readiness for trial shall be required 
in order to obtain a trial setting in a contested case. 
 

Notes and Comments 

omment to 1990 change: First paragraph, to harmonize a first time nonjury setting with the time 
for jury demand, and to set a more realistic notice for trial. Second paragraph, to standardize the 
readiness requirement to obtain a trial setting.   
 

RULE 246.    CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE OF SETTINGS 
 
The clerk shall keep a record in his office of all cases set for trial, and it shall be his duty to inform 
any  non-resident  attorney  of  the  date  of  setting  of  any  case  upon  request  by  mail  from  such 
attorney, accompanied by a return envelope properly addressed and stamped. Failure of the clerk 
to furnish such information on proper request shall be sufficient ground for continuance or for a 
new trial when it appears to the court that such failure has prevented the attorney from preparing 
or presenting his claim or defense. 
 

RULE 247.    TRIED WHEN SET 
 
Every suit shall be tried when it is called, unless continued or postponed to a future day or placed 
at the end of the docket to be called again for trial in its regular order. No cause which has been 
set upon the trial docket of the court shall be taken from the trial docket for the date set except by 
agreement of the parties or for good cause upon motion and notice to the opposing party.

RULE 248.    JURY CASES 
 
When a jury has been demanded, questions of law, motions, exceptions to pleadings, and other 
unresolved pending matters shall, as far as practicable, be heard and determined by the court before 
the trial commences, and jurors shall be summoned to appear on the day so designated. 
 

Notes and Comments 

omment to 1990 change: To encourage resolution of matters prior to trial.   

RULE 249.    CALL OF NON-JURY DOCKET 
 
The  non-jury  docket  shall  be  taken  up  at  such  times  as  not  unnecessarily  to  interfere  with  the 
dispatch of business on the jury docket.

B.    Continuance and Change of Venue 
 

RULE 251.    CONTINUANCE 
 
No application for a continuance shall be heard before the defendant files his defense, nor shall 
any continuance be granted except for sufficient cause supported by affidavit, or by consent of the 
parties, or by operation of law. 
 

RULE 252.    APPLICATION FOR CONTINUANCE 

f the ground of such application be the want of testimony, the party applying therefor shall make 
affidavit that such testimony is material, showing the materiality thereof, and that he has used due 
diligence to procure such testimony, stating such diligence, and the cause of failure, if known; that 
such testimony cannot be procured from any other source; and, it if be for the absence of a witness, 
he shall state the name and residence of the witness, and what he expects to prove by him; and also 
state that the continuance is not sought for delay only, but that justice may be done; provided that, 
on a first application for a continuance, it shall not be necessary to show that the absent testimony 
cannot  be  procured  from  any  other  source.The  failure  to  obtain  the  deposition  of  any  witness 
residing within 100 miles of the courthouse or the county in which the suit is pending shall not be 
regarded as want of diligence when diligence has been used to secure the personal attendance of 
such witness under the rules of law, unless by reason of age, infirmity or sickness, or official duty, 
the witness will be unable to attend the court, or unless such witness is about to leave, or has left,

RULE 253.    ABSENCE OF COUNSEL AS GROUND FOR CONTINUANCE 

xcept  as  provided  elsewhere  in  these  rules,  absence  of  counsel  will  not  be  good  cause  for  a 
continuance  or  postponement  of  the  cause  when  called  for  trial,  except  it  be  allowed  in  the 
discretion of the court, upon cause shown or upon matters within the knowledge or information of 
the judge to be stated on the record. 
 

RULE 254.    ATTENDANCE ON LEGISLATURE 

n all civil actions, including matters of probate, and in all matters ancillary to such suits which 
require  action  by  or  the  attendance  of  an  attorney,  including  appeals  but  excluding  temporary 
restraining orders, at any time within thirty days of a date when the legislature is to be in session, 
or  at  any  time  the  legislature  is  in  session,  or  when  the  legislature  sits  as  a  Constitutional 
Convention, it shall be mandatory that the court continue the cause if it shall appear to the court, 
by affidavit, that any party applying for continuance, or any attorney for any party to the cause, is 
a member of either branch of the legislature, and will be or is in actual attendance on a session of 
the same. If the member of the legislature is an attorney for a party to the cause, his affidavit shall 
contain  a  declaration  that  it  is  his  intention  to  participate  actively  in  the  preparation  and/or 
presentation of the case. Where a party to any cause, or an attorney for any party to a cause, is a 
member of the legislature, his affidavit need not be corroborated. On the filing of such affidavit, 
the  court  shall  continue  the  cause  until  thirty  days  after  adjournment  of  the  legislature  and  the 
affidavit shall be proof of the necessity for the continuance, and the continuance shall be deemed 
one  of  right  and  shall  not  be  charged  against  the  movant  upon  any  subsequent  application  for 
continuance.The right to a continuance shall be mandatory, except only where the attorney was 
employed  within  ten  days  of  the  date  the  suit  is  set  for  trial,  the  right  to  continuance  shall  be 
discretionary. 
 

RULE 255.    CHANGE OF VENUE BY CONSENT 

pon the written consent of the parties filed with the papers of the cause, the court, by an order 
entered on the minutes, may transfer the same for trial to the court of any other county having 
jurisdiction of the subject matter of such suit.

A change of venue may be granted in civil causes upon motion of either party, supported by his 
own affidavit and the affidavit of at least three credible persons, residents of the county in which 
the suit is pending, for any following cause: 

That there exists in the county where the suit is pending so great a prejudice against him 
that he cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial. 

That  there  is  a  combination  against  him  instigated  by  influential  persons,  by  reason  of 
which he cannot expect a fair and impartial trial.

For other sufficient cause to be determined by the court. 

RULE 258.    SHALL BE GRANTED 

here such motion to transfer venue is duly made, it shall be granted, unless the credibility of 
those making such application, or their means of knowledge or the truth of the facts set out in said 
application are attacked by the affidavit of a credible person; when thus attacked, the issue thus 
formed  shall  be  tried  by  the  judge;  and  the  application  either  granted  or  refused.  Reasonable 
discovery in support of, or in opposition to, the application shall be permitted, and such discovery 
as  is  relevant,  including  deposition  testimony  on  file,  may  be  attached  to,  or  incorporated  by 
reference  in,  the  affidavit  of  a  party,  a  witness,  or  an  attorney  who  has  knowledge  of  such 
discovery. 

 

RULE 259.    TO WHAT COUNTY 

f the motion under Rule 257 is granted, the cause shall be removed: 

If from a district court, to any county of proper venue in the same or an adjoining district; 

If from a county court, to any adjoining county of proper venue; 

If (a) or (b) are not applicable, to any county of proper venue; 

If a county of proper venue (other than the county of suit) cannot be found, then if from

the record of the cause. 
 

RULE 264.    VIDEOTAPE TRIAL

sought.  Immediately  thereafter,  the  adverse  party  may  make  a  similar  statement,  and 
intervenors and other parties will be accorded similar rights in the order determined by the 
court. 

The party upon whom rests the burden of proof on the whole case shall then introduce his 
evidence. 

The adverse party shall briefly state the nature of his claim or defense and what said party 
expects to prove and the relief sought unless he has already done so. 

He shall then introduce his evidence. 

The intervenor and other parties shall make their statement, unless they have already done 
so, and shall introduce their evidence. 

The parties shall then be confined to rebutting testimony on each side. 

But one counsel on each side shall examine and cross-examine the same witness, except 
on leave granted. 

RULE 266.    OPEN AND CLOSE - ADMISSION 

xcept  as  provided in Rule  269  the  plaintiff  shall  have the  right to  open  and  conclude  both  in 
adducing his evidence and in the argument, unless the burden of proof on the whole case under the 
pleadings rests upon the defendant, or unless the defendant or all of the defendants, if there should 
be more than one, shall, after the issues of fact are settled and before the trial commences, admit 
that  the  plaintiff  is  entitled  to  recover  as  set  forth  in  the  petition,  except  so  far  as  he  may  be 
defeated, in whole or in part, by the allegations of the answer constituting a good defense, which 
may  be  established  on  the  trial;  which  admission  shall  be  entered  of  record,  whereupon  the 
defendant,  or  the  defendants,  if  more  than  one,  shall  have  the  right  to  open  and  conclude  in 
adducing the evidence and in the argument of the cause. The admission shall not serve to admit 
any allegation which is inconsistent with such defense, which defense shall be one that defendant 
has the burden of establishing, as for example, and without excluding other defenses: accord and 
satisfaction,  adverse  possession,  arbitration  and  award,  contributory  negligence,  discharge  in 
bankruptcy, duress, estoppel, failure of consideration, fraud, release, res judicata, statute of frauds, 
statute of limitations, waiver, and the like. 
 

RULE 267.    WITNESSES PLACED UNDER RULE

delivered by any other witness in the cause. This is termed placing witnesses under the 
rule.

This rule does not authorize exclusion of (1) a party who is a natural person or the spouse 
of such natural person, or (2) an officer or employee of a party that is not a natural person 
and who is designated as its representative by its attorney, or (3) a person whose presence 
is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of the cause. 

c) 

If any party be absent, the court in its discretion may exempt from the rule a representative 
of such party. 

d)  Witnesses, when placed under  Rule 614  of the  Texas Rules of  Civil Evidence,  shall be 
instructed by the court that they are not to converse with each other or with any other person 
about the case other than the attorneys in the case, except by permission of the court, and 
that they are not to read any report of or comment upon the testimony in the case while 
under the rule.

RULE 269.    ARGUMENT 

After the evidence is concluded and the charge is read, the parties may argue the case to 
the jury. The party having the burden of proof on the whole case, or on all matters which 
are submitted by the charge, shall be entitled to open and conclude the argument; where 
there are several parties having separate claims or defenses, the court shall prescribe the 
order of argument between them. 

In all arguments, and especially in arguments on the trial of the case, the counsel opening 
shall present his whole case as he relies on it, both of law and facts, and shall be heard in 
the concluding argument only in reply to the counsel on the other side. 

Counsel for an intervenor shall occupy the position in the argument assigned by the court 
according to the nature of the claim. 

Arguments on questions of law shall be addressed to the court, and counsel should state 
the substance of the authorities referred to without reading more from books than may be 
necessary to verify the statement. On a question on motions, exceptions to the evidence, 
and other incidental matters, the counsel will be allowed only such argument as may be 
necessary to present clearly the question raised, and refer to authorities on it, unless further 
discussion is invited by the court.

the  argument  strictly  to  the  evidence  and  to  the  arguments  of  opposing  counsel.  Mere 
personal criticism by counsel upon each other shall be avoided, and when indulged in shall 
be promptly corrected as a contempt of court. 

Side-bar remarks, and remarks by counsel of one side, not addressed to the court, while the 
counsel on the other side is examining a witness or arguing any question to the court, or 
addressing the jury, will be rigidly repressed by the court. 

The  court  will  not  be  required  to  wait  for  objections  to  be  made  when  the  rules  as  to 
arguments are violated; but should they not be noticed and corrected by the court, opposing 
counsel may ask leave of the court to rise and present his point of objection. But the court 
shall protect counsel from any unnecessary interruption made on frivolous and unimportant 
grounds. 

It shall be the duty of every counsel to address the court from his place at the bar, and in 
addressing the court to rise to his feet; and while engaged in the trial of a case he shall 
remain at his place in the bar. 

RULE 270.    ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY 

hen it clearly appears to be necessary to the due administration of justice, the court may permit 
additional  evidence  to  be  offered  at  any  time;  provided  that  in  a  jury  case  no  evidence  on  a 
controversial matter shall be received after the verdict of the jury.

D.    Charge to the Jury 
 

RULE 271.    CHARGE TO THE JURY 

nless expressly waived by the parties, the trial court shall prepare and in open court deliver a 

written charge to the jury. 
 

RULE 272.    REQUISITES 
 
The charge shall be in writing, signed by the court, and filed with the clerk, and shall be a part of 
the record of the cause. It shall be submitted to the respective parties or their attorneys for their 
inspection, and a reasonable time given them in which to examine and present objections thereto 
outside the presence of the jury, which objections shall in every instance be presented to the court 
in writing, or be dictated to the court reporter in the presence of the court and opposing counsel, 
before the charge is read to the jury. All objections not so presented shall be considered as waived. 
The court shall announce its rulings thereon before reading the charge to the jury and shall endorse

  W

  U

 

the  rulings  on  the  objections  if  written  or  dictate  same  to  the  court  reporter  in  the  presence  of 
counsel. Objections to the charge and the court's rulings thereon may be included as a part of any 
transcript  or  statement  of  facts  on  appeal  and,  when  so  included  in  either,  shall  constitute  a 
sufficient bill of exception to the rulings of the court thereon. It shall be presumed, unless otherwise 
noted in the record, that the party making such objections presented the same at the proper time 
and excepted to the ruling thereon. 
 

RULE 273.    JURY SUBMISSIONS 

ither party may present to the court and request written questions, definitions, and instructions to 
be given to the jury; and the court may give them or a part thereof, or may refuse to give them, as 
may  be  proper.  Such  requests  shall  be  prepared  and  presented  to  the  court  and  submitted  to 
opposing counsel for examination and objection within a reasonable time after the charge is given 
to  the  parties  or  their  attorneys  for  examination.  A  request  by  either  party  for  any  questions, 
definitions, or instructions shall be made separate and apart from such party's objections to the 
court's charge. 

 

RULE 274.    OBJECTIONS AND REQUESTS 

 party objecting to a charge must point out distinctly the objectionable matter and the grounds of 
the objection. Any complaint as to a question, definition, or instruction, on account of any defect, 
omission, or fault in pleading, is waived unless specifically included in the objections. When the 
complaining party's objection, or requested question, definition, or instruction is, in the opinion of 
the  appellate  court,  obscured  or  concealed  by  voluminous  unfounded  objections,  minute 
differentiations or numerous unnecessary requests, such objection or request shall be untenable. 
No objection to one part of the charge may be adopted and applied to any other part of the charge 
by reference only. 
 

RULE 275.    CHARGE READ BEFORE ARGUMENT 

efore the argument is begun, the trial court shall read the charge to the jury in the precise words 
in which it was written, including all questions, definitions, and instructions which the court may 
give. 
 

RULE 276.    REFUSAL OR MODIFICATION 

hen an instruction, question, or definition is requested and the provisions of the law have been 
complied with and the trial judge refuses the same, the judge shall endorse thereon "Refused," and 
sign  the  same  officially.  If  the  trial  judge  modifies  the  same  the  judge  shall  endorse  thereon 
"Modified as follows: (stating in what particular the judge has modified the same) and given, and 
exception allowed" and sign the same officially. Such refused or modified instruction, question, 
or definition, when so endorsed shall constitute a bill of exceptions, and it shall be conclusively 
presumed that the party asking the same presented it at the proper time, excepted to its refusal or

modification, and that all the requirements of law have been observed, and such procedure shall 
entitle the party requesting the same to have the action of the trial judge thereon reviewed without 
preparing a formal bill of exceptions. 
 

RULE 277.    SUBMISSION TO THE JURY 

n all jury cases the court shall, whenever feasible, submit the cause upon broad-form questions. 
The court shall submit such instructions and definitions as shall be proper to enable the jury to 
render a verdict. 

nferential rebuttal questions shall not be submitted in the charge. The placing of the burden of 
proof may be accomplished by instructions rather than by inclusion in the question. 

n any cause in which the jury is required to apportion the loss among the parties the court shall 
submit a question or questions inquiring what percentage, if any, of the negligence or causation, 
as the case may be, that caused the occurrence or injury in question is attributable to each of the 
persons found to have been culpable. The court shall also instruct the jury to answer the damage 
question or questions without any reduction because of the percentage of negligence or causation, 
if  any,  of  the  person  injured.  The  court  may  predicate  the  damage  question  or  questions  upon 
affirmative findings of liability. 

n a suit in which termination of the parent-child relationship is requested, the court shall submit 
separate  questions  for  each  parent  and  each  child  on  (1)  each  individual  statutory  ground  for 
termination  of  the  parent-child  relationship  and  (2)  whether  termination  of  the  parent-child 
relationship is in the best interest of the child. The court shall predicate the best-interest question 
upon an affirmative finding of at least one termination ground.     

he court may submit a question disjunctively when it is apparent from the evidence that one or 

the other of the conditions or facts inquired about necessarily exists. 

he court shall not in its charge comment directly on the weight of the evidence or advise the jury 
of the effect of their answers, but the court's charge shall not be objectionable on the ground that 
it incidentally constitutes a comment on the weight of the evidence or advises the jury of the effect 
of their answers when it is properly a part of an instruction or definition. 
 

Notes and Comments 

omment to 1988 change: The amendment to paragraph one of Rule 277 would unify the practice 
of submitting broad form questions to the jury in the form approved by Lemos v. Montez, 680 
S.W.2d 798 (Tex. 1984). 

omment  to  2020  change:  Rule  277  is  revised  to  require  a  jury  question  on  each  individual 
statutory  ground  for  termination  as  to  each  parent  and  each  child  without  requiring  further 
granulated questions for subparts of an individual ground for termination. Rule 277 is also revised 
to require a separate question on best interest of the child as to each parent and each child that is

predicated  on  an  affirmative  answer to  at  least  one  termination-ground  question.  The  revisions 
supersede Texas Department of Human Services v. E.B., 802 S.W.2d 647 (Tex. 1990). 
 

RULE 278.    SUBMISSION OF QUESTIONS, DEFINITIONS, AND INSTRUCTIONS 

he court shall submit the questions, instructions and definitions in the form provided by Rule 
277, which are raised by the written pleadings and the evidence. Except in trespass to try title, 
statutory partition proceedings, and other special proceedings in which the pleadings are specially 
defined  by  statutes  or  procedural  rules,  a  party  shall  not  be  entitled  to  any  submission  of  any 
question  raised  only  by  a  general  denial  and  not  raised  by  affirmative written  pleading  by that 
party.  Nothing  herein  shall  change  the  burden  of  proof  from  what  it  would  have  been  under  a 
general denial. A judgment shall not be reversed because of the failure to submit other and various 
phases or different shades of the same question. Failure to submit a question shall not be deemed 
a ground for reversal of the judgment, unless its submission, in substantially correct wording, has 
been  requested  in  writing  and  tendered  by  the  party  complaining  of  the  judgment;  provided, 
however, that objection to such failure shall suffice in such respect if the question is one relied 
upon by the opposing party. Failure to submit a definition or instruction shall not be deemed a 
ground for reversal of the judgment unless a substantially correct definition or instruction has been 
requested in writing and tendered by the party complaining of the judgment. 
 

RULE 279.    OMISSIONS FROM THE CHARGE 

pon appeal all independent grounds of recovery or of defense not conclusively established under 
the evidence and no element of which is submitted or requested are waived. When a ground of 
recovery or defense consists of more than one element, if one or more of such elements necessary 
to sustain such ground of recovery or defense, and necessarily referable thereto, are submitted to 
and found by the jury, and one or more of such elements are omitted from the charge, without 
request or objection, and there is factually sufficient evidence to support a finding thereon, the trial 
court,  at  the  request  of  either  party,  may  after  notice  and  hearing  and  at  any  time  before  the 
judgment  is  rendered,  make  and  file  written  findings  on  such  omitted  element  or  elements  in 
support of the judgment. If no such written findings are made, such omitted element or elements 
shall be deemed found by the court in such manner as to support the judgment. A claim that the 
evidence was legally or factually insufficient to warrant the submission of any question may be 
made for the first time after verdict, regardless of whether the submission of such question was 
requested by the complainant.

that, while they are serving as jurors, they must not post any information about the case on the 
Internet or search for any information outside of the courtroom, including on the Internet, to try to 
learn more about the case. 
 
If jurors are permitted to separate before they are released from jury duty, either during the trial or 
after  the  case  is  submitted  to  them,  the  court  must  instruct  them  that  it  is  their  duty  not  to

cause such witness to be again brought upon the stand and the judge shall direct him to repeat his 
testimony as to the point in dispute, and no other, as nearly as he can in the language used on the 
trial; and on their notifying the court that they disagree as to any portion of a deposition or other

F.    Verdict 
 

RULE 290.    DEFINITION AND SUBSTANCE 
 
A verdict is a written declaration by a jury of its decision, comprehending the whole or all the 
issues submitted to the jury, and shall be either a general or special verdict, as directed, which shall 
be signed by the presiding juror of the jury. 

 general verdict is one whereby the jury pronounces generally in favor of one or more parties to 
the suit upon all or any of the issues submitted to it. A special verdict is one wherein the jury finds 
the facts only on issues made up and submitted to them under the direction of the court. 
A special verdict shall, as between the parties, be conclusive as to the facts found. 
 

RULE 291.    FORM OF VERDICT 

o special form of verdict is required, and the judgment shall not be arrested or reversed for mere 
want of form therein if there has been substantial compliance with the requirements of the law in 
rendering a verdict. 
 

RULE 292.    VERDICT BY PORTION OF ORIGINAL JURY 

Except as provided in subsection (b), a verdict may be rendered in any cause by the 
concurrence,  as  to  each and  all answers  made, of  the  same  ten  or  more  members of  an 
original jury  of twelve  or  of  the same five or more members of an original jury  of six. 
However, where as many as three jurors die or be disabled from sitting and there are only 
nine of the jurors remaining of an original jury of twelve, those remaining may render and 
return a verdict. If less than the original twelve or six jurors render a verdict, the verdict 
must be signed by each juror concurring therein. 

A verdict may be rendered awarding exemplary damages only if the jury was unanimous 
in 
finding liability for and the amount of exemplary damages. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment  to  2005  change:  The  rule  is  divided  into  two  subsections.  Subsection  (a)  is 
clarified. Subsection (b) is added to make the rule consistent with Act of June 2, 2003, 78th Leg., 
R.S., ch. 204, § 13.04, 2003 Tex. Gen. Laws 847, 888, codified as Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 
41.003. 
 

RULE 293.    WHEN THE JURY AGREE 

hen the jury agree upon a verdict, they shall be brought into the court by the proper officer, and 
Page  188

  (

they shall deliver their verdict to the clerk; and if they state that they have agreed, the verdict shall 
be read aloud by the clerk. If the verdict is in proper form, no juror objects to its accuracy, no juror 
represented as agreeing thereto dissents therefrom, and neither party requests a poll of the jury, the 
verdict shall be entered upon the minutes of the court. 
 

RULE 294.    POLLING THE JURY 

ny party shall have the right to have the jury polled. A jury is polled by reading once to the jury 
collectively  the  general  verdict,  or  the  questions  and  answers  thereto  consecutively,  and  then 
calling the name of each juror separately and asking the juror if it is the juror's verdict. If any juror 
answers  in  the  negative  when  the  verdict  is  returned  signed  only  by  the  presiding  juror  as  a 
unanimous verdict, or if any juror shown by the juror's signature to agree to the verdict should 
answer in the negative, the jury shall be retired for further deliberation. 
 

RULE 295.    CORRECTION OF VERDICT 

f the purported verdict is defective, the court may direct it to be reformed. If it is incomplete, or 
not responsive to the questions contained in the court's charge, or the answers to the questions are 
in  conflict,  the  court  shall  in  writing  instruct  the  jury  in  open  court  of  the  nature  of  the 
incompleteness, unresponsiveness, or conflict, provide the jury such additional instructions as may 
be proper, and retire the jury for further deliberations. 
 

Notes and Comments 

omment to 1988 change: The amendment makes it clear that the court may direct a complete yet 
defective verdict to be reformed. The amendment also makes it clear that in the event the verdict 
is incomplete or otherwise improper, the court is limited to giving the jury additional instructions 
in writing.

298, the latter findings will control for appellate purposes. Findings of fact shall be filed with the 
clerk of the court as a document or documents separate and apart from the judgment.

within such periods including, but not limited to, motions for new trial, motions to modify 
judgment, motions to reinstate a case dismissed for want of prosecution, motions to vacate 
judgment and requests for findings of fact and conclusions of law; but this rule shall not 
determine what constitutes rendition of a judgment or order for any other purpose. 

Date to Be Shown.    Judges, attorneys and clerks are directed to use their best efforts to 
cause all judgments, decisions and orders of any kind to be reduced to writing and signed 
by the trial judge with the date of signing stated therein. If the date of signing is not recited 
in the judgment or order, it may be shown in the record by a certificate of the judge or 
otherwise; provided, however, that the absence of a showing of the date in the record shall 
not invalidate any judgment or order. 

Notice  of  Judgment.  When  the  final  judgment  or  other  appealable  order  is  signed,  the 
clerk of the court must immediately give notice to the parties or their attorneys of record 
electronically or by first-class mail advising that the judgment or order was signed. If the 
judgment awards monetary damages, the notice must state: “If you are an individual (not a 
company),  your  money  or  property  may  be  protected  from  being  taken  to  pay  this 
judgment. Find out more by visiting www.texaslawhelp.org/exempt-property. / Si usted es 
una persona física (y no una compañía), su dinero o propiedad pudieran estar protegidos 
de ser embargados como pago de esta deuda decretada en juicio en contra suya. Obtenga 
mayor información visitando el sitio www.texaslawhelp.org/exempt-property.” Failure to 
comply with the provisions of this rule shall not affect the periods mentioned in paragraph 
(1) of this rule, except as provided in paragraph (4). 

No Notice of Judgment.    If within twenty days after the judgment or other appealable 
order is signed,  a party adversely affected by  it or  his  attorney  has  neither  received the 
notice required by paragraph (3) of this rule nor acquired actual knowledge of the order, 
then with respect to that party all the periods mentioned in paragraph (1) shall begin on the 
date that such party or his attorney received such notice or acquired actual knowledge of 
the signing, whichever occurred first, but in no event shall such periods begin more than 
ninety days after the original judgment or other appealable order was signed. 

Motion, Notice and Hearing.    In order to establish the application of paragraph (4) of 
this rule, the party adversely affected is required to prove in the trial court, on sworn motion 
and notice, the date on which the party or his attorney first either received a notice of the 
judgment or acquired actual knowledge of the signing and that this date was more than 
twenty days after the judgment was signed. 

Nunc Pro Tunc Order.    When a corrected judgment has been signed after expiration of 
the court's plenary power pursuant to Rule 316, the periods mentioned in paragraph (1) of

complaint that would not be applicable to the original document. 

When Process Served by Publication.    With respect to a motion for new trial filed more 
than thirty days after the judgment was signed pursuant to Rule 329 when process has been 
served by publication, the periods provided by paragraph (1) shall be computed as if the 
judgment were signed on the date of filing the motion.

SECTION 11.    TRIAL OF CAUSES 
 
J.    New Trials 
 

RULE 320.    MOTION AND ACTION OF COURT THEREON 
 
New trials may be granted and judgment set aside for good cause, on motion or on the court's own 
motion on such terms as the court shall direct. New trials may be granted when the damages are 
manifestly too small or too large. When it appears to the court that a new trial should be granted 
on a point or points that affect only a part of the matters in controversy and that such part is clearly 
separable without unfairness to the parties, the court may grant a new trial as to that part only, 
provided that a separate trial on unliquidated damages alone shall not be ordered if liability issues 
are contested. Each motion for new trial shall be in writing and signed by the party or his attorney. 
 

RULE 321.    FORM 
 
Each point relied upon in a motion for new trial or in arrest of judgment shall briefly refer to that 
part of the ruling of the court, charge given to the jury, or charge refused, admission or rejection 
of evidence, or other proceedings which are designated to be complained of, in such a way that the 
objection can be clearly identified and understood by the court. 
 

RULE 322.    GENERALITY TO BE AVOIDED 
 
Grounds of objections couched in general terms - as that the court erred in its charge, in sustaining 
or overruling exceptions to the pleadings, and in excluding or admitting evidence, the verdict of 
the jury is contrary to law, and the like - shall not be considered by the court. 
 

[RULE 323.    Repealed effective January 1, 1978] 
 

RULE 324.    PREREQUISITES OF APPEAL 
 
(a)  Motion  for  New  Trial  Not  Required.    A  point  in  a  motion  for  new  trial  is  not  a 
prerequisite to a complaint on appeal in either a jury or a nonjury case, except as provided 
in subdivision (b). 

b)  Motion for New Trial Required.    A point in a motion for new trial is a prerequisite to 

the following complaints on appeal: 

(1) 

A complaint on which evidence must be heard such as one of jury misconduct or 
newly discovered evidence or failure to set aside a judgment by default; 

Page  199 

  (

 

 

 

(2) 

A complaint of factual insufficiency of the evidence to support a jury finding; 

(3) 

A complaint that a jury finding is against the overwhelming weight of the evidence; 

(4) 

A complaint of inadequacy or excessiveness of the damages found by the jury; or 

(5) 

Incurable jury argument if not otherwise ruled on by the trial court. 

c) 

Judgment Notwithstanding Findings; Cross-Points.    When judgment is rendered non 
obstante verdicto or notwithstanding the findings of a jury on one or more questions, the 
appellee  may  bring  forward  by  cross-point  contained  in  his  brief  filed  in  the  Court  of 
Appeals any ground which would have vitiated the verdict or would have prevented an 
affirmance of the judgment had one been rendered by the trial court in harmony with the 
verdict, including although not limited to the ground that one or more of the jury's findings 
have insufficient support in the evidence or are against the overwhelming preponderance 
of the evidence as a matter of fact, and the ground that the verdict and judgment based 
thereon should be set aside because of improper argument of counsel. 

The failure to bring forward by cross-points such grounds as would vitiate the verdict shall 
be  deemed  a  waiver  thereof;  provided,  however,  that  if  a  cross-point  is  upon  a  ground 
which requires the taking of evidence in addition to that adduced upon the trial of the cause, 
it  is  not  necessary  that  the  evidentiary  hearing  be  held  until  after  the  appellate  court 
determines that the cause be remanded to consider such a cross-point. 

[RULE 325.    Repealed effective January 1, 1978] 
 

RULE 326.    NOT MORE THAN TWO 
 
Not  more  than  two  new  trials  shall  be  granted  either  party  in  the  same  cause  because  of 
insufficiency or weight of the evidence. 
 

RULE 327.    FOR JURY MISCONDUCT 
 
(a)  When the ground of a motion for new trial, supported by affidavit, is misconduct of the 
jury or of the officer in charge of them, or because of any communication made to the jury, 
or that a juror gave an erroneous or incorrect answer on voir dire examination, the court 
shall hear evidence thereof from the jury or others in open court, and may grant a new trial 
if  such  misconduct  proved,  or  the  communication  made,  or  the  erroneous  or  incorrect 
answer on voir dire examination, be material, and if it reasonably appears from the evidence 
both on the hearing of the motion and the trial of the case and from the record as a whole 
that injury probably resulted to the complaining party. 

b) 

A juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the 
jury's  deliberations  or  to  the  effect  of  anything  upon  his  or  any  other  juror's  mind  or 

Page  200 

 

 

 

  (

 

   

  (

 

emotions as influencing him to assent to or dissent from the verdict concerning his mental 
processes  in  connection  therewith,  except  that  a  juror  may  testify  whether  any  outside 
influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror. Nor may his affidavit or evidence 
of  any  statement  by  him  concerning  a  matter  about  which he  would  be  precluded  from 
testifying be received for these purposes. 

[RULE 328.    Repealed effective January 1, 1988] 
 

RULE 329.    MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL ON JUDGMENT FOLLOWING CITATION 
BY PUBLICATION 
 
In  cases  in  which  judgment  has  been  rendered  on  service  of  process  by  publication,  when  the 
defendant has not appeared in person or by attorney of his own selection: 
 

The court may grant a new trial upon petition of the defendant showing good cause, 
supported by affidavit, filed within two years after such judgment was signed. The 
parties adversely interested in such judgment shall be cited as in other cases. 

(a) 

(b) 

Execution  of  such  judgment  shall  not  be  suspended  unless  the  party  applying 
therefor  shall  give  a  good  and  sufficient  bond  payable  to  the  plaintiff  in  the 
judgment,  in  an  amount  fixed  in  accordance  with  Appellate  Rule  47  relating  to 
supersedeas bonds, to be approved by the clerk, and conditioned that the party will 
prosecute his petition for new trial to effect and will perform such judgment as may 
be rendered by the court should its decision be against him. 

(c) 

If property has been sold under the judgment and execution before the process was 
suspended,  the  defendant  shall  not  recover  the  property  so  sold,  but  shall  have 
judgment against the plaintiff in the judgment for the proceeds of such sale. 

(d) 

If the motion is filed more than thirty days after the judgment was signed, the time 
period shall be computed pursuant to Rule 306a(7). 

RULE 329a.    COUNTY COURT CASES 
 
If a case or other matter is on trial or in the process of hearing when the term of the county court 
expires, such trial, hearing or other matter may be proceeded with at the next or any subsequent 
term of court and no motion or plea shall be considered as waived or overruled, because not acted 
upon at the term of court at which it was filed, but may be acted upon at any time the judge may 
fix or at which it may have been postponed or continued by agreement of the parties with leave of 
the court. This subdivision is not applicable to original or amended motions for new trial which 
are governed by Rule 329b. 
 

Page  201 

   

 

 

 

 

 

RULE 329b.    TIME FOR FILING MOTIONS 
 
The following rules shall be applicable to motions for new trial and motions to modify, correct, or 
reform  judgments  (other  than  motions  to  correct  the  record  under  Rule  316)  in  all  district  and 
county courts: 

A motion for new trial, if filed, shall be filed prior to or within thirty days after the judgment 
or other order complained of is signed. 

One or more amended motions for new trial may be filed without leave of court before any 
preceding motion for new trial filed by the movant is overruled and within thirty days after 
the judgment or other order complained of is signed. 

In the event an original or amended motion for new trial or a motion to modify, correct or 
reform a judgment is not determined by written order signed within seventy-five days after 
the judgment was signed, it shall be considered overruled by operation of law on expiration 
of that period. 

The trial court, regardless of whether an appeal has been perfected, has plenary power to 
grant a new trial or to vacate, modify, correct, or reform the judgment within thirty days 
after the judgment is signed. 

If a motion for new trial is timely filed by any party, the trial court, regardless of whether 
an appeal has been perfected, has plenary power to grant a new trial or to vacate, modify, 
correct,  or  reform  the  judgment  until  thirty  days  after  all  such  timely-filed  motions  are 
overruled, either by a written and signed order or by operation of law, whichever occurs 
first. 

On expiration of the time within which the trial court has plenary power, a judgment cannot 
be set aside by the trial court except by bill of review for sufficient cause, filed within the 
time allowed by law; provided that the court may at any time correct a clerical error in the 
record of a judgment and render judgment nunc pro tunc under Rule 316, and may also 
sign an order declaring a previous judgment or order to be void because signed after the 
court's plenary power had expired. 

A motion to modify, correct, or reform a judgment (as distinguished from motion to correct 
the record of a judgment under Rule 316), if filed, shall be filed and determined within the 
time  prescribed  by  this  rule  for  a  motion  for  new  trial  and  shall  extend  the  trial  court's 
plenary power and the time for perfecting an appeal in the same manner as a motion for 
new trial. Each such motion shall be in writing and signed by the party or his attorney and 
shall  specify  the  respects  in  which  the  judgment  should  be  modified,  corrected,  or 
reformed. The overruling of such a motion shall not preclude the filing of a motion for new 
trial, nor shall the overruling of a motion for new trial preclude the filing of a motion to 
modify, correct, or reform. 

h) 

If a judgment is modified, corrected or reformed in any respect, the time for appeal shall

run  from  the  time  the  modified,  corrected,  or  reformed  judgment  is  signed,  but  if  a 
correction is made pursuant to Rule 316 after expiration of the period of plenary power 
provided by this rule, no complaint shall be heard on appeal that could have been presented 
in an appeal from the original judgment. 

omment to 1988 change: Amended to conform with repeal of Rule 317. 

Notes and Comments 

SECTION 11.    TRIAL OF CAUSES 
 
K.    Certain District Courts 
 

RULE 330.    RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE IN CERTAIN DISTRICT 
COURTS 
 
The following rules of practice and procedure shall govern and be followed in all civil actions in 
district courts in counties where the only district court of said county vested with civil jurisdiction, 
or  all  the  district  courts  thereof  having  civil  jurisdiction,  have  successive  terms  in  said  county 
throughout the year, without more than two days intervening between any of such terms, whether 
or  not  any  one  or  more  of  such  district  courts  include  one  or  more  other  counties  within  its 
jurisdiction. 

Appealed Cases.    In cases appealed to said district courts from inferior courts, the appeal, 
including  transcript,  shall  be  filed  in  the  district  court  within  thirty  (30)  days  after  the 
rendition  of  the  judgment  or  order  appealed  from,  and  the  appellee  shall  enter  his 
appearance  on  the  docket  or  answer  to  said  appeal  on  or  before  ten  o'clock  a.m.  of  the 
Monday next after the expiration of twenty (20) days from the date the appeal is filed in 
the district court. 

[Repealed] 

Postponement  or  Continuance.    Cases  may  be  postponed  or  continued  by  agreement 
with the approval of the court, or upon the court's own motion or for cause. When a case is 
called for trial and only one party is ready, the court may for good cause either continue 
the case for the term or postpone and reset it for a later day in the same or succeeding term. 

Cases May Be Reset.    A case that is set and reached for trial may be postponed for a later 
day in the term or continued and reset for a day certain in the succeeding term on the same 
grounds as an application for continuance would be granted in other district courts. After 
any case has been set and reached in its due order and called for trial two (2) or more times 
and not tried, the court may dismiss the same unless the parties agree to a postponement or 
continuance  but  the court  shall respect written agreements of counsel for  postponement 
and continuance if filed in the case when or before it is called for trial unless to do so will 
unreasonably delay or interfere with other business of the court.

Exchange  and  Transfer.    Where  in  such  county  there  are  two  or  more  district  courts 
having  civil  jurisdiction,  the  judges  of  such  courts  may,  in  their  discretion,  exchange 
benches or districts from time to time, and may transfer cases and other proceedings from 
one court to another, and any of them may in his own courtroom try and determine any 
case or proceeding pending in another court without having the case transferred, or may sit 
in any other of said courts and there hear and determine any case there pending, and every 
judgment and order shall be entered in the minutes of the court in which the case is pending 
and  at  the  time  the  judgment  or  order  is rendered,  and  two  (2)  or  more  judges  may  try 
different cases in the same court at the same time, and each may occupy his own courtroom 
or the room of any other court. The judge of any such court may issue restraining orders 
and injunctions returnable to any other judge or court, and any judge may transfer any case 
or proceeding pending in his court to any other of said courts, and the judge of any court 
to which a case or proceeding is transferred shall receive and try the same, and in turn shall 
have power in his discretion to transfer any such case to any other of said courts and any 
other judge may in his courtroom try any case pending in any other of such courts. 

Cases Transferred to Judges Not Occupied.    Where in such counties there are two or 
more district courts having civil jurisdiction, when the judge of any such court shall become 
disengaged, he shall notify the presiding judge, and the presiding judge shall transfer to the 
court of the disengaged judge the next case which is ready for trial in any of said courts. 
Any judge not engaged in his own court may try any case in any other court. 

Judge  May  Hear  Only  Part  of  Case.    Where  in  such  counties  there  are  two  or  more 
district  courts  having  civil  jurisdiction,  any  judge  may  hear  any  part  of  any  case  or 
proceeding  pending  in  any  of  said  courts  and  determine  the  same,  or  may  hear  and 
determine any question in any case, and any other judge may complete the hearing and 
render judgment in the case. 

Any  Judge  May  Hear  Dilatory  Pleas.    Where  in  such  county  there  are  two  or  more 
district  courts  having  civil  jurisdiction,  any  judge  may  hear  and  determine  motions, 
petitions for injunction, applications for appointment of receivers, interventions, pleas of 
privilege, pleas in abatement, all dilatory pleas and special exceptions, motions for a new 
trial  and  all  preliminary  matters,  questions and proceedings  and  may  enter judgment  or 
order thereon in the court in which the case is pending without having the case transferred 
to  the  court  of  the  judge  acting,  and  the  judge  in  whose  court  the  case  is  pending  may 
thereafter proceed to hear, complete and determine the case or other matter, or any part 
thereof, and render final judgment therein. Any judgment rendered or action taken by any 
judge in any of said courts in the county shall be valid and binding. 

Acts in Succeeding Terms.    If a case or other matter is on trial, or in the process of hearing 
when the term of court expires, such trial, hearing or other matter may be proceeded with 
at the next or any subsequent term of court and no motion or plea shall be considered as 
waived or overruled, because not acted upon at the term of court at which it was filed, but 
may be acted upon at any time the judge may fix or at which it may have been postponed 
or continued by agreement of the parties with leave of the court. This subdivision is not

subpoena is issued and may be punished by fine or confinement, or both”; and 

(8) 

be signed by the person issuing the subpoena.     

d) 

Service: Where, By Whom, How.    A subpoena may be served at any place within the State 
of Texas by any sheriff or constable of the State of Texas, or by any person who is not a 
party and is 18 years of age or older.    A subpoena must be served by delivering a copy to 
the witness and tendering to that person any fees required by law.    If the witness is a party 
and is represented by an attorney of record in the proceeding, the subpoena may be served 
on the witness’s attorney of record.    Proof of service must be made by filing either: 

the witness’s signed written memorandum attached to the subpoena showing that 
the witness accepted the subpoena; or 

a statement by the person who made the service stating the date, time, and manner 
of service, and the name of the person served. 

Compliance Required.    A person commanded by subpoena to appear and give testimony 
must remain at the hearing or trial from day to day until discharged by the court or by the 
party  summoning  the  witness.    If  a  subpoena  commanding  testimony  is  directed  to  a 
corporation, partnership, association, governmental agency, or other organization, and the 
matters on which examination is requested are described with reasonable particularity, the 
organization must designate one or more persons to testify on its behalf as to matters known 
or reasonably available to the organization. 

Objection.    A person commanded to attend and give testimony at a hearing or trial may 
object  or  move  for  a  protective  order  before  the  court  at  or  before  the  time  and  place 
specified for compliance.    A party causing a subpoena to issue must take reasonable steps 

Page  214 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  (

 

 

 

e) 

  (

f) 

  (

to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on the person served.    In ruling on objections 
or  motions  for  protection,  the  court  must  provide  a  person  served  with  a  subpoena  an 
adequate time for compliance and protection from undue burden or expense. The court may 
impose reasonable conditions on compliance with a subpoena, including compensating the 
witness for undue hardship. 

Enforcement.    Failure by any person without adequate excuse to obey a subpoena served 
upon that person may be deemed a contempt of the court from which the subpoena is issued 
or of a district court in the county in which the subpoena is served, and may be punished 
by fine or confinement, or both.    A fine may not be imposed, nor a person served with a 
subpoena  attached,  for  failure  to  comply  with  a  subpoena  without  proof  of  service  and 
proof by affidavit of the party requesting the subpoena or the party’s attorney of record that 
all fees due the witness by law were paid or tendered.   

ULE 500.9.    DISCOVERY 

Pretrial  Discovery.    Pretrial  discovery  is  limited  to  that  which  the  judge  considers 
reasonable and necessary.    Any requests for pretrial discovery must be presented to the 
court for approval by written motion.    The motion must be served on the responding party.   
Unless a hearing is requested, the judge may rule on the motion without a hearing.    The 
discovery  request  must not  be  served  on  the  responding  party  unless  the  judge issues a 
signed order approving the request.    Failure to comply with a discovery order can result 
in sanctions, including dismissal of the case or an order to pay the other party’s discovery 
expenses.     

Post-judgment Discovery.    Post-judgment discovery is not required to  be filed with the 
court.    The party requesting discovery must give the responding party at least 30 days to 
respond to a post-judgment discovery request.    The responding party may file a written 
objection with the court within 30 days of receiving the request.    If an objection is filed, 
the  judge  must  hold  a  hearing  to  determine  if  the  request  is  valid.    If  the  objection  is 
denied, the judge must order the party to respond to the request.    If the objection is upheld, 
the judge may reform the request or dismiss it entirely. 

00.10.    APPEARANCES AT COURT PROCEEDINGS 

Participant Method of Appearance. A judge may allow or require a participant to appear 
at  a  court  proceeding  by  videoconference,  teleconference,  or  other  available  electronic 
means. 

Judge  Method  of  Appearance;  Location.  A  judge  may  appear  at  a  court  proceeding  by 
videoconference,  teleconference,  or  other  available  electronic  means.  However,  even  if 
appearing electronically, a judge must conduct the court proceeding from the judge’s office 
at times prescribed by the commissioner’s court, as provided by statute. 

Factors.  In  determining  whether  to  allow  or  require  electronic  participation,  the  judge 
should consider factors such as:

technological  restrictions  such  as  lack  of  access  to  or  proficiency  in  necessary 
technology;   

travel restrictions such as lack of transportation, distance, or inability to take off 
work;   

6)    whether a method of appearance is best suited to provide necessary language access 
services  for  a  person  with  limited  English  proficiency  or  accommodations  for  a 
person with a disability; 

7)   

any previous abuse of a method of appearance; and 

8) 

any agreement or objection by the parties.

case type;   

(2) 

the number of parties and witnesses;   

(3)   

the type of evidence to be submitted, if any;   

d)    Notice. If the judge allows or requires a participant to appear electronically, the judge must 
provide reasonable notice of the electronic participation and include the notice in the papers 
of the case. The notice must contain the information needed for participants to participate 
in  the  proceeding,  including  instructions  for  joining  the  proceeding  electronically,  the 
court’s  designated  contact  information,  and  instructions  for  submitting  evidence  to  be 
considered in the proceeding. 

e) 

Open Courts. If the judge conducts a court proceeding at the judge’s office in which all 
other participants appear electronically, then the judge must: 

(1) 

provide reasonable notice to the public of how to observe the court proceeding; and 

(2) 

provide the public the opportunity to observe the court proceeding, unless the judge 
has determined that the proceeding must be closed to protect an overriding interest, 
considered all less-restrictive alternatives to closure, and made findings in a written 
order adequate to support closure. 

Notes and Comments 
 

Comment to 2023 change: New Rule 500.10 clarifies procedures for appearances at court 
proceedings. Paragraph (a) governs the method of appearance for court “participants,” which is 
defined in Rule 500.2. Under paragraph (b), a judge in any justice court proceeding may appear 
electronically, but the judge must preside over it from the judge’s office at times prescribed by the 
commissioner’s court. TEX. GOV’T CODE § 27.051(b). Nothing in paragraph (b) permits the judge 
to conduct a proceeding away from a location required by law. Paragraph (c) addresses factors that 

Page  216 

 

 

 

  (

  (

 

 

 

 

a  judge  should  consider  in  determining  the  method  of  appearance.  Paragraph  (d)  clarifies 
requirements for notices. Paragraph (e) recognizes the public’s right to reasonable notice of and 
access to a fully electronic proceeding unless there is an overriding interest. A judge should rarely 
close a court proceeding from public observation, and in such an exceptional case, the judge must 
use the least restrictive measure to protect the overriding interest. 
 

RULE 501.    CITATION AND SERVICE 

Issuance.  When  a  petition  is  filed  with  a  justice  court  to  initiate  a  suit,  the  clerk  must 
promptly issue a citation and deliver the citation as directed by the plaintiff.    The plaintiff

petition with any documents filed with the petition.    Upon request, separate or additional 
citations must be issued by the clerk. The clerk must retain a copy of the citation in the 
court’s file.

rise to the claim occurred; 

the county and precinct where the contract or agreement, if any, that gave rise to 
the claim was to be performed; or 

the county and precinct where the property is located, in a suit to recover personal 
property. 

c) 

Non-Resident  Defendant;  Defendant’s  Residence  Unknown.    If  the  defendant  is  a 
non-resident of Texas, or if defendant’s residence is unknown, the plaintiff may file the 
suit in the county and precinct where the plaintiff resides. 

d)  Motion to Transfer Venue.    If a plaintiff files suit in an improper venue, a defendant may 
challenge the venue selected by filing a motion to transfer venue.    The motion must be 
filed before trial, no later than 21 days after the day the defendant’s answer is filed, and 
must contain a sworn statement that the venue chosen by the plaintiff is improper and a 
specific county and precinct of proper venue to which transfer is sought.    If the defendant 
fails to name a county and precinct, the court must instruct the defendant to do so and allow 
the defendant 7 days to cure the defect.    If the defendant fails to correct the defect, the 
motion will be denied, and the case will proceed in the county and precinct where it was 
originally filed.       

 

Procedure. 

(1) 
 

(A) 

(B) 

(D) 

Judge to Set Hearing.    If a defendant files a motion to transfer venue, the 
judge must set a hearing on the motion. 

Response.    A  plaintiff  may  file  a  response  to  a  defendant’s  motion  to 
transfer venue.     

(C)  Hearing.    The  parties  may  present  evidence  at  the  hearing.      A  witness 
may testify at a hearing, either in person or, with permission of the court, 
by means of telephone or an electronic communication system.   

Judge’s  Decision.  If  the  motion  is  granted,  the  judge  must  sign  an  order 
designating the court to which the case will be transferred.    If the motion is 
denied,  the case  will  be  heard  in the  court  in  which  the  plaintiff  initially 
filed suit.     

(E) 

Review.    Motions  for  rehearing  and  interlocutory  appeals  of  the  judge’s 
ruling on venue are not permitted. 

(F) 

Time for Trial of the Case. No trial may be held until at least the 14th day

after the judge’s ruling on the motion to transfer venue. 

(G)  Order.      An order granting a motion to transfer venue must state the reason 
for  the  transfer  and  the  name  of  the  court  to  which  the  transfer  is  made.   
When such an order of transfer is made, the judge who issued the order must 
immediately make out a true and correct transcript of all the entries made 
on the docket in the case, certify the transcript, and send the transcript, with 
a certified copy of the bill of costs and the original papers in the case, to the 
court  in  the  precinct  to  which  the  case  has  been  transferred.    The  court 
receiving  the  case  must  then  notify  the  plaintiff  that  the  case  has  been 
received and, if the case is transferred to a different county, that the plaintiff 
has 14 days after receiving the notice to pay the filing fee in the new court, 
or  file  a  Statement  of  Inability  to  Afford  Payment  of  Court  Costs.    The 
plaintiff is not entitled to a refund of any fees already paid.    Failure to pay 
the  fee  or  file  a  Statement  will  result  in  dismissal  of  the  case  without 
prejudice.       

Fair Trial Venue Change.    If a party believes it cannot get a fair trial in a specific precinct 
or before a specific judge, the party may file a sworn motion stating such, supported by the 
sworn statements of two other credible persons, and specifying if the party is requesting a 
change of location or a change of judge.      Except for good cause shown, this motion must 
be filed no less than 7 days before trial.    If the party seeks a change of judge, the judge 
must  exchange  benches  with  another  qualified  justice  of  the  peace,  or  if  no  judge  is 
available to exchange benches, the county judge must appoint a visiting judge to hear the 
case.    If the party seeks a change in location, the case must be transferred to the nearest 
justice court in the county that is not subject to the same or some other disqualification.    If 
there is only one justice of the peace precinct in the county, then the judge must exchange 
benches with another qualified justice of the peace, or if no judge is available to exchange 
benches, the county judge must appoint a visiting judge to hear the case.    In cases where 
exclusive jurisdiction is within a specific precinct, as in eviction cases, the only remedy 
available is a change of judge.    A party may apply for relief under this rule only one time 
in any given lawsuit. 

Transfer  of  Venue  by  Consent.    On  the  written  consent  of  all  parties  or their  attorneys, 
filed with the court, venue must be transferred to the court of any other justice of the peace 
of the county, or any other county. 

ULE 502.5.    ANSWER

by the citation and must also serve a copy of the answer on the plaintiff.    The answer must 
contain:

of the defendant; and 

(3)

and email contact information.     

General Denial.    An answer that denies all of the plaintiff’s allegations without specifying 
the  reasons  is  sufficient  to  constitute  an  answer  or  appearance  and  does  not  bar  the 
defendant from raising any defense at trial. 

Answer Docketed.    The defendant’s appearance must be noted on the court’s docket. 

Due Date. Unless the defendant is served by publication, the defendant’s answer is due by

provided in Rule 502.2, and must pay a filing fee or provide a Statement of Inability to 
Afford Payment of Court Costs.    The court need not generate a citation for a counterclaim 
and no answer to the counterclaim need be filed.    The defendant must serve a copy of the 
counterclaim as provided by Rule 501.4. 

b)    Cross-Claim.    A plaintiff seeking relief against another plaintiff, or a defendant seeking 
relief against another defendant may file a cross-claim.    The filing party must file a cross-

be liable for all or part of the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant may file a petition as

Afford Payment of Court Costs.      A citation must be issued and served as provided by 
Rule 501.2. 

ULE 502.7.    AMENDING AND CLARIFYING PLEADINGS

pleading, as long as the amended pleading is filed and served as provided by Rule 501.4 
not less than 7 days before trial.    The court may allow a pleading to be amended less than 
7 days before trial if the amendment will not operate as a surprise to the opposing party.       

Insufficient Pleadings.    A party may file a motion with the court asking that another party 
be required to clarify a pleading.      The court must determine if the pleading is sufficient 
to place all parties on notice of the issues in the lawsuit, and may hold a hearing to make 
that determination.    If the court determines a pleading is insufficient, the court must order 
the party to amend the pleading and set a date by which the party must amend.    If a party 
fails to comply with the court’s order, the pleading may be stricken.     

RULE 503.    DEFAULT JUDGMENT; PRE-TRIAL MATTERS; TRIAL 

ULE 503.1.    IF DEFENDANT FAILS TO ANSWER 

Default Judgment.    If the defendant fails to file an answer by the date stated in Rule 502.5, 
the judge must ensure that service was proper, and may hold a hearing for this purpose.    If 
it is determined that service was proper, the judge must render a default judgment in the 
following manner: 

(1) 

Claim Based on Written Document.    If the claim is based on a written document 
signed by the defendant, and a copy of the document has been filed with the court 
and served on the defendant, along with a sworn statement from the plaintiff that 
this is a true and accurate copy of the document and the relief sought is owed, and 
all payments, offsets or credits due to the defendant have been accounted for, the 
judge must render judgment for the plaintiff in the requested amount, without any 
necessity  for  a  hearing.    The  plaintiff’s  attorney  may  also  submit  affidavits 
supporting an award of attorney fees to which the plaintiff is entitled, if any.     

(2) 

Other Cases.    Except as provided in (1), a plaintiff who seeks a default judgment 
against a defendant must request a hearing, orally or in writing.    The plaintiff must 
appear at the hearing and provide evidence of its damages.    If the plaintiff proves 
its damages, the judge must render judgment for the plaintiff in the amount proven.

If the plaintiff is unable to prove its damages, the judge must render judgment in 
favor of the defendant.    With the permission of the court, a party may appear at a 
hearing by means of telephone or an electronic communication system.     

Appearance.    If a defendant files an answer or otherwise appears in a case before a default 
judgment is signed by the judge, the judge must not enter a default judgment and the case 
must be set for trial as described in Rule 503.3. 

Post-Answer Default. If a defendant who has answered fails to appear for trial, the court 
may proceed to hear evidence on liability and damages and render judgment accordingly. 

Notice. The plaintiff requesting a default judgment must provide to the clerk in writing the 
last known mailing address of the defendant at or before the time the judgment is signed.   
When a default judgment is signed, the clerk must immediately mail written notice of the 
judgment to the defendant at the address provided by the plaintiff, and note the fact of such 
mailing on the docket.    The notice must state the number and style of the case, the court 
in which the case is pending, the names of the parties in whose favor and against whom the 
judgment was rendered, and the date the judgment was signed.    Failure to comply with the 
provisions of this rule does not affect the finality of the judgment. 

e) 

Form of Default Judgment. A default judgment must comply with Rule 505.1.

Drawing Jury and Oath.    If no method of electronic draw has been implemented, the judge 
must write the names of all prospective jurors present on separate slips of paper as nearly 
alike as may be, place them in a box, mix them well, and then draw the names one by one 
from  the  box.    The  judge  must  list  the  names  drawn  and  deliver  a  copy  to  each  of  the 
parties or their attorneys. 

Oath.    After the draw, the judge must swear the panel as follows:    “You solemnly swear 
or  affirm  that  you  will  give  true  and  correct  answers  to  all  questions  asked  of  you 
concerning your qualifications as a juror.” 

Questioning the Jury.    The judge, the parties, or their attorneys will be allowed to question 
jurors as to their ability to serve impartially in the trial but may not ask the jurors how they 
will rule in the case.    The judge will have discretion to allow or disallow specific questions 
and determine the amount of time each side will have for this process. 

Challenge for Cause.    A party may challenge any juror for cause.    A challenge for cause 
is  an  objection  made  to  a  juror  alleging  some  fact,  such  as  a  bias  or  prejudice,  that 
disqualifies the juror from serving in the case or that renders the juror unfit to sit on the 
jury.    The challenge must be made during jury questioning.    The party must explain to 
the judge why the juror should be excluded from the jury.    The judge must evaluate the 
questions and answers given and either grant or deny the challenge.    When a challenge for 
cause has been sustained, the juror must be excused. 

Challenges  Not  for  Cause.    After  the  judge  determines  any  challenges  for  cause,  each 
party  may  select  up  to  3  jurors  to  excuse  for  any  reason  or  no  reason  at  all.    But  no 
prospective juror may be excused for membership in a constitutionally protected class. 

The  Jury.    After  all  challenges,  the  first  6  prospective  jurors  remaining  on  the  list 
constitute the jury to try the case. 

If Jury Is Incomplete.    If challenges reduce the number of prospective jurors below 6, the 
judge may direct the sheriff or constable to summon others and allow them to be questioned 
and challenged by the parties as before, until at least 6 remain. 

Jury  Sworn.    When  the  jury  has  been  selected,  the  judge  must  require  them  to  take 
substantially the following oath: “You solemnly swear or affirm that you will render a true 
verdict according to the law and the evidence presented.”

ULE 508.3.    DEFAULT JUDGMENT 

Generally.   If  the  defendant  does  not  file  an  answer  to  a  claim  by  the  answer  date  or 
otherwise  appear  in  the  case,  the  judge  must  promptly  render  a  default  judgment  upon 
the plaintiff’s proof of the amount of damages. A default judgment must comply with Rule 
505.1. When a default judgment is signed, the clerk must comply with Rule 503.1(d) and 
immediately mail written notice of the judgment to the defendant at the address provided 
by the plaintiff.  

b) 

Proof of the Amount of Damages.   

(1) 

(2) 

Evidence  Must  Be  Served  or  Submitted.    Evidence  of  plaintiff’s  damages  must 
either be attached to the petition and served on the defendant or submitted to the 
court after defendant’s failure to answer by the answer date.     

Form  of  Evidence.    Evidence  of  plaintiff’s  damages  may  be  offered  in  a  sworn 
statement  or  in  live testimony.    The  evidence  offered  may  include  documentary 
evidence.     

(3) 

Establishment of the Amount of Damages.    The amount of damages is established 
by evidence:

that the account or loan was issued to the defendant and the defendant is 
obligated to pay it; 

that  the  account  was  closed  or  the  defendant  breached  the  terms  of  the 
account or loan agreement; 

of  the  amount  due  on  the  account  or  loan  as  of  a  date  certain  after  all 
payment credits and offsets have been applied; and 

that  the  plaintiff  owns  the  account  or  loan  and,  if  applicable,  how  the 
plaintiff acquired the account or loan. 

(4) 

Documentary  Evidence  Offered  By  Sworn  Statement.    Documentary  evidence 
may be considered if it is attached to a sworn statement made by the plaintiff or its 
representative, a prior holder of the debt or its representative, or the original creditor 
or its representative, that attests to the following: 

(A) 

the documents were kept in the regular course of business;   

(B) 

it was the regular course of business for an employee or representative with 
knowledge of the act recorded to make the record or to transmit information 
to be included in such record;   

(C) 

the  documents  were  created  at  or  near  the  time  or  reasonably  soon 
thereafter; and 

(D) 

the documents attached are the original or exact duplicates of the original. 

(5) 

Consideration  of  Sworn  Statement.    A  judge  is  not  required  to  accept  a  sworn 
statement  if  the  source  of  information  or  the  method  or  circumstances  of 
preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness.    But a judge may not reject a sworn 
statement  only  because  it  is  not  made  by  the  original  creditor  or  because  the 
documents attested to were created by a third party and subsequently incorporated 
into and relied upon by the business of the plaintiff.     

Hearing.    The judge may enter a default judgment without a hearing if the plaintiff submits 
sufficient written evidence of its damages and should do so to avoid undue expense and 
delay.    Otherwise,  the  plaintiff  may  request  a  default  judgment  hearing  at  which  the 
plaintiff  must  appear,  in  person  or  by  telephonic  or  electronic  means,  and  prove  its 
damages.    If  the  plaintiff  proves  its  damages,  the  judge  must  render  judgment  for  the 
plaintiff in the amount proven.    If the plaintiff is unable to prove its damages, the judge 
must render judgment in favor of the defendant.   

Appearance.    If  the  defendant  files  an  answer  or  otherwise  appears  in  a  case  before  a 
default judgment is signed by the judge, the judge must not render a default judgment and 
must set the case for trial.

Post-Answer Default. If a defendant who has answered fails to appear for trial, the court 
may proceed to hear evidence on liability and damages and render judgment accordingly.

If the petition does not include the landlord’s name and business street address, or 
if, after making diligent efforts on at least two occasions, the officer or authorized

(2) 

If the officer or authorized person is unsuccessful in serving citation under (b)(1) 
after making diligent efforts on at least two occasions at either the business street 
address  of  the  landlord’s  management  company,  if  (b)(1)(A)  applies,  or  at  each

at trial, the judge may proceed to hear evidence. If the tenant establishes that the 
tenant is entitled to recover, the judge must render judgment against the landlord in 
accordance with the evidence. 

(2) 

If the tenant fails to appear for trial, the judge may dismiss the lawsuit. 

ULE  509.6.    JUDGMENT:  AMOUNT;  FORM  AND  CONTENT;  ISSUANCE  AND 

SERVICE; FAILURE TO COMPLY 

Amount. Judgment may be rendered against the landlord for failure to repair or remedy a 
condition at the residential rental property if the total judgment does not exceed $20,000, 
excluding interest and court costs but including attorney’s fees. Any party who prevails in 
a  lawsuit  brought  under  these  rules  may  recover  the  party’s  court  costs  and  reasonable 
attorney’s fees as allowed by law. 

b) 

Form and Content. 

(1)

parties to the  proceeding and the  street  address of the residential rental  property 
where the condition is to be repaired or remedied.  

(2) 

In the judgment, the judge may: 

(A) 

(B) 

order  the  landlord  to  take  reasonable  action  to  repair  or  remedy  the 
condition; 

order a reduction in the tenant’s rent, from the date of the first repair notice,

(D) 

award the tenant’s actual damages; and 

(E) 

award court costs and attorney’s fees, excluding any attorney’s fees for a 
claim for damages relating to a personal injury. 

(3) 

If the judge orders the landlord to repair or remedy a condition, the judgment must 
include in reasonable detail the actions the landlord must take to repair or remedy 
the condition and the date when the repair or remedy must be completed. 

(4) 

If the judge orders a reduction in the tenant’s rent, the judgment must state: 

(A) 

the amount of the rent the tenant must pay, if any; 

(B) 

the frequency with which the tenant must pay the rent; 

(C) 

the condition justifying the reduction of rent; 

(D) 

the effective date of the order reducing rent; 

(E) 

(F) 

that  the  order  reducing  rent  will  terminate  on  the  date  the  condition  is 
repaired or remedied; and 

that on the day the condition is repaired or remedied, the landlord must give 
the  tenant  written  notice,  served  in  accordance  with  Rule  501.4,  that  the 
condition justifying the reduction of rent has been repaired or remedied and 
the rent will revert to the rent amount specified in the lease. 

Issuance and Service. The judge must issue the judgment. The judgment may be served on 
the landlord in open court or by any means provided in Rule 501.4 at an address listed in 
the citation, the address listed on any answer, or such other address the landlord furnishes 
to the court in writing. Unless the judge serves the landlord in open court or by other means 
provided in Rule 501.4, the sheriff, constable, or other authorized person who serves the 
landlord must promptly file a return of service in the justice court. 

Failure  to  Comply.  If  the  landlord  fails  to  comply  with  an  order  to  repair  or  remedy  a 
condition  or  reduce  the  tenant’s  rent,  the  failure  is  grounds  for  citing  the  landlord  for 
contempt of court under Section 21.002 of the Texas Government Code. 

ULE 509.7.    COUNTERCLAIMS 

ounterclaims and the joinder of suits against third parties are not permitted in suits under these 
rules. Compulsory counterclaims may be brought in a separate suit. Any potential causes of action, 
including a compulsory counterclaim, that are not asserted because of this rule are not precluded.

Time and Manner. Either party may appeal the decision of the justice court to a statutory 
county court or, if there is no statutory county court with jurisdiction, a county court or 
district court with jurisdiction by filing a written notice of appeal with the justice court 
within 21 days after the date the judge signs the judgment. If the judgment is amended in 
any respect, any party has the right to appeal within 21 days after the date the judge signs 
the new judgment, in the same manner set out in this rule. 

Perfection. The posting of an appeal bond is not required for an appeal under this rule, and 
the  appeal  is  considered  perfected  with  the  filing  of  a  notice  of  appeal.  Otherwise,  the 
appeal is in the manner provided by law for appeal from a justice court. 

Effect. The timely filing of a notice of appeal stays the enforcement of any order to repair 
or remedy a condition or reduce the tenant’s rent, as well as any other actions. 

Costs. The appellant must pay the costs on appeal to a county court in accordance with 
Rule 143a. 

Trial on Appeal. On appeal, the parties are entitled to a trial de novo. A trial de novo is a 
new trial in which the entire case is presented as if there had been no previous trial.      Either 
party is entitled to trial by jury on timely request and payment of a fee, if required. An 
appeal of a judgment of a justice court under these rules takes precedence in the county 
court and may be held at any time after the eighth day after the date the transcript is filed 
in the county court. 

ULE 509.9.    EFFECT OF WRIT OF POSSESSION 

f a judgment for the landlord for possession of the residential rental property becomes final, any 
order to repair or remedy a condition is vacated and unenforceable. 
 

RULE 510. EVICTION CASES 

ULE 510.1.    APPLICATION 

ule 510 applies to a lawsuit to recover possession of real property under Chapter 24 of the Texas 

Property Code.     

ULE 510.2.    COMPUTATION OF TIME FOR EVICTION CASES 

ule 500.5 applies to the computation of time in an eviction case.    But if a document is filed by 
mail and not received by the court by the due date, the court may take any action authorized by 
these rules, including issuing a writ of possession requiring a tenant to leave the property.

b)  Where Filed.    The petition must be filed in the precinct where the premises is located.    If 
it is filed elsewhere, the judge must dismiss the case.    The plaintiff will not be entitled to 
a refund of the filing fee, but will be refunded any service fees paid if the case is dismissed 
before service is attempted. 

 

 

Defendants  Named.    If  the  eviction  is  based  on  a  written  residential  lease,  the  plaintiff 
must  name  as  defendants  all  tenants  obligated  under  the  lease  residing  at  the  premises 
whom plaintiff seeks to evict.    No judgment or writ of possession may issue or be executed 
against a tenant obligated under a lease and residing at the premises who is not named in 
the petition and served with citation. 

Claim for Rent.    A claim for rent within the justice court’s jurisdiction may be asserted in 
an eviction case.   

Only  Issue.  The  court  must  adjudicate  the  right  to  actual  possession  and  not  title.   
Counterclaims and the joinder of suits against third parties are not permitted in eviction 
cases.    A claim that is not asserted because of this rule can be brought in a separate suit in 
a court of proper jurisdiction.     

ULE 510.4.    ISSUANCE, SERVICE, AND RETURN OF CITATION

the suit has been improperly instituted, and conditioned that the plaintiff will pay defendant 
all such costs and damages that are adjudged against plaintiff.     

Notice  to  Defendant.    The  court  must  notify  a  defendant  that  the  plaintiff  has  filed  a 
possession bond. The notice must be served in the same manner as service of citation and

Filing.    An  appellant  who  cannot  furnish  a  bond  or  pay  a  cash  deposit  in  the 
amount  required  may  instead  file  a  Statement  of  Inability  to  Afford  Payment  of 
Court Costs.      The Statement must be on the form approved by the Supreme Court 
or include the information required by the Court-approved form. 

Contest.    The Statement may be contested as provided in Rule 502.3(d) within 5 
days after the opposing party receives notice that the Statement was filed. 

Appeal If Contest Sustained.    If the contest is sustained, the appellant may appeal 
that decision by filing notice with the  justice court within 5  days of  that court’s 
written  order.    The  justice  court  must  then  forward  all  related  documents  to the 
county  court  for  resolution.    The  county  court  must  set  the  matter  for  hearing 
within 5 days and hear the contest de novo, as if there had been no previous hearing, 
and, if the appeal is granted, must direct the justice court to transmit to the clerk of 
the county court the transcript, records, and papers of the case, as provided in these 
rules. 

If No Appeal or If Appeal Overruled.    If the appellant does not appeal the ruling

Payment of Rent in Nonpayment of Rent Appeals. 

Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs. 

(c) 
 

(A)  Notice. If a defendant appeals an eviction for nonpayment of rent by filing 
a Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs, the justice court 
must provide to the defendant a written notice at the time the Statement is 
filed that contains the following information in bold or conspicuous type: 

 

 

 

(i) 

(ii) 

(iii) 

(iv) 

the amount of the initial deposit of rent, equal to one rental period’s 
rent under the terms of the rental agreement, that the defendant must 
pay into the justice court registry; 

whether the initial deposit must be paid in cash, cashier’s check, or 
money order, and to whom the cashier’s check or money order, if 
applicable, must be made payable; 

the calendar date by which the initial deposit must be paid into the 
justice court registry, which must be within 5 days of the date the 
Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs is filed; and 

a statement that failure to pay the required amount into the justice 
court registry by the required date may result in the court issuing a 
writ of possession without hearing. 

Page  252 

 

 

 

(B)  Defendant  May  Remain  in  Possession.    A  defendant  who  appeals  an 
eviction for nonpayment of rent by filing a Statement of Inability to Afford 
Payment  of  Court  Costs  is  entitled  to  stay  in  possession  of  the  premises 
during  the  pendency  of  the  appeal  by  complying  with  the  following 
procedure: 

 

(i)  Within  5  days  of  the  date  that  the  defendant  files  a  Statement  of 
Inability  to  Afford  Payment  of  Court  Costs,  it  must  pay  into  the 
justice court registry the amount set forth in the notice provided at 
the  time  the  defendant  filed  the  Statement.    If  the  defendant  was 
provided with notice and fails to pay the designated amount into the 
justice court registry within 5 days, and the transcript has not been 
transmitted to the county clerk, the plaintiff is entitled, upon request 
and payment of the applicable fee, to a writ of possession, which the 
justice court must issue immediately and without hearing. 

During  the  appeal  process  as  rent  becomes  due  under  the  rental 
agreement, the defendant must pay the designated amount into the 
county court registry within 5 days of the rental due date under the 
terms of the rental agreement.     

If a government agency is responsible for all or a portion of the rent, 
the defendant must pay only that portion of the rent determined by 
the justice court to be paid during appeal.    Either party may contest 
the portion of the rent that the justice court determines must be paid 
into the county court registry by filing a contest within 5 days after 
the judgment is signed. If a contest is filed, the justice court must 
notify the parties and hold a hearing on the contest within 5 days. If 
the defendant objects to the justice court’s ruling at the hearing, the 
defendant is required to pay only the portion claimed to be owed by 
the defendant until the issue is tried in county court.   

If  the  defendant  fails  to  pay  the  designated  amount  into  the  court 
registry within the time limits prescribed by these rules, the plaintiff 
may file a sworn motion that the defendant is in default in county 
court.    The plaintiff must notify the defendant of the motion and the 
hearing date. Upon a showing that the defendant is in default, the 
court must issue a writ of possession. 

The  plaintiff  may  withdraw  any  or  all  rent  in  the  county  court 
registry upon sworn motion and hearing, prior to final determination 
of the case, showing just cause; dismissal of the appeal; or order of 
the court after final hearing.

precedence in the county court. 

Notice to Other Parties Required.    If a Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court 
Costs is filed, the court must provide notice to all other parties that the Statement was filed 
no  later  than  the  next  business  day.    Within  5  days  of  filing  a  bond  or  making  a  cash 
deposit, an appellant must serve written notice of the appeal on all other parties using a 
method approved under Rule 501.4.         

No  Default  on  Appeal  Without  Compliance  With  Rule.    No  judgment  may  be  taken  by 
default against the adverse party in the court to which the case has been appealed without 
first showing substantial compliance with this rule. 

Appeal  Perfected.    An  appeal  is  perfected  when  a  bond,  cash  deposit,  or  Statement  of 
Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs is filed in accordance with this rule.     

RULE 510.10.    RECORD ON APPEAL; DOCKETING; TRIAL DE NOVO 

 

Preparation  and  Transmission  of  Record.    Unless  otherwise  provided  by  law  or  these 
rules, when an appeal has been perfected, the judge must stay all further proceedings on 
the judgment and must immediately send to the clerk of the county court a certified copy 
of all docket entries, a certified copy of the bill of costs, and the original papers in the case 
together with any money in the court registry, including sums tendered pursuant to Rule 
510.9(c)(5)(B).

the parties of the date of receipt of the transcript and the docket number of the case. The 
notice must advise the defendant that it must file a written answer in the county court within 
8 days if one was not filed in the justice court.   

Trial De Novo. The case must be tried de novo in the county court.    A trial de novo is a 
new trial in which the entire case is presented as if there had been no previous trial.    The 
trial, as well as any hearings and motions, is entitled to precedence in the county court. 

ULE 510.11.    DAMAGES ON APPEAL 

n the trial of the case in the county court the appellant or appellee will be permitted to plead, 
prove and recover his damages, if any, suffered for withholding or defending possession of the 
premises during the pendency of the appeal. Damages may include but are not limited to loss of 
rentals  during  the  pendency  of  the  appeal  and  attorney  fees  in  the  justice  and  county  courts 
provided, as to attorney fees, that the requirements of Section 24.006 of the Texas Property Code 
have been met. Only the party prevailing in the county court will be entitled to recover damages 
against the adverse party. The prevailing party will also be entitled to recover court costs and to 
recover against the sureties on the appeal bond in cases where the adverse party has executed an 
appeal bond.

court and may be amended as in other cases. If the defendant made no answer in writing in the 
justice court and fails to file a written answer within 8 days after the transcript is filed in the county 
court, the allegations of the complaint may be taken as admitted and judgment by default may be 
entered accordingly.

RULE 598a.    SERVICE OF WRIT ON DEFENDANT 
 
The defendant shall be served in any manner prescribed for service of citation, or as provided in 
Rule 21a, with a copy  of the writ of  attachment,  the application, accompanying  affidavits, and 
orders of the court as soon as practicable following the levy of the writ. There shall be prominently 
displayed on the face of the copy of the writ served on the defendant, in ten-point type and in a 
manner calculated to advise a reasonably attentive person of its contents, the following: 

To ____________, Defendant: 

ou are hereby notified that certain properties alleged to be owned by you have been attached. If 

you claim any rights in such property, you are advised: 

YOU  HAVE  A  RIGHT  TO  REGAIN  POSSESSION  OF  THE  PROPERTY  BY  FILING  A 
REPLEVY  BOND.  YOU  HAVE  A  RIGHT  TO  SEEK  TO  REGAIN  POSSESSION  OF  THE 
PROPERTY BY FILING WITH THE COURT A MOTION TO DISSOLVE THIS WRIT.” 
 

RULE 599.    DEFENDANT MAY REPLEVY 
 
At any time before judgment, should the attached property not have been previously claimed or 
sold, the defendant may replevy the same, or any part thereof, or the proceeds from the sale of the 
property  if  it  has  been  sold  under  order  of  the  court,  by  giving  bond  with  sufficient  surety  or 
sureties  as  provided  by  statute,  to  be  approved  by  the  officer  who  levied  the  writ,  payable  to 
plaintiff, in the amount fixed by the court's order, or, at the defendant's option, for the value of the 
property sought to be replevied (to be estimated by the officer), plus one year's interest thereon at 
the legal rate from the date of the bond, conditioned that the defendant shall satisfy, to the extent 
of the penal amount of the bond, any judgment which may be rendered against him in such action. 

n reasonable notice to the opposing party (which may be less than three days) either party shall 
have the right to prompt judicial review of the amount of bond required, denial of bond, sufficiency 
of sureties, and estimated value of the property, by the court which authorized issuance of the writ. 
The court's determination may be made upon the basis of affidavits, if uncontroverted, setting forth 
such facts as would be admissible in evidence; otherwise, the parties shall submit evidence. The 
court shall forthwith enter its order either approving or modifying the requirements of the officer 
or of the court's prior order, and such order of the court shall supersede and control with respect to 
such matters. 

n reasonable notice to the opposing party (which may be less than three days) the defendant shall 
have the right to move the court for a substitution of property, of equal value as that attached, for 
the property attached. Provided that there has been located sufficient property of the defendants to 
satisfy  the  order  of  attachment,  the  court  may  authorize  substitution  of  one  or  more  items  of 
defendant's property for all or for part of the property attached. The court shall first make findings 
as to the value of the property to be substituted. If property is substituted, the property released 
from attachment shall be delivered to defendant, if such property is personal property, and all liens

upon  such  property  from  the  original  order  of  attachment  or  modification  thereof  shall  be 
terminated. Attachment of substituted property shall be deemed to have existed from the date of 
levy on the original property attached, and no property on which liens have become affixed since 
the date of levy on the original property may be substituted. 
 

RULE 600.    SALE OF PERISHABLE PROPERTY 
 
Whenever personal property which has been attached shall not have been claimed or replevied, the 
judge, or justice of the peace, out of whose court the writ was issued, may, either in term time or 
in vacation, order the same to be sold, when it shall be made to appear that such property is in 
danger of serious and immediate waste or decay, or that the keeping of the same until the trial will 
necessarily be attended with such expense or deterioration in value as greatly to lessen the amount 
likely to be realized therefrom. 
 

RULE 601.    TO PROTECT INTERESTS 
 
In  determining  whether  the  property  attached  is  perishable,  and  the  necessity  or  advantage  or 
ordering a sale thereof, the judge or justice of the peace may act upon affidavits in writing or oral 
testimony, and may by a preliminary order entered of record, with or without notice to the parties 
as  the  urgency  of  the  case  in  his  opinion  requires,  direct  the  sheriff  or  constable  to  sell  such 
property at public auction for cash, and thereupon the officer shall sell it accordingly. 
 

RULE 602.    BOND OF APPLICANT FOR SALE 
 
If the application for an order of sale be filed by any person or party other than the defendant from 
whose possession the property was taken by levy, the court shall not grant such order unless the 
applicant shall file with such court a bond payable to such defendant, with two or more good and 
sufficient sureties, to be approved by said court, conditioned that they will be responsible to the 
defendant for such damages as he may sustain in case such sale be illegally and unjustly applied 
for, or be illegally and unjustly made. 
 

RULE 603.    PROCEDURE FOR SALE 
 
Such sale of attached perishable personal property shall be conducted in the same manner as sales 
of personal property under execution; provided, however, that the time of the sale, and at the time 
of advertisement thereof, may be fixed by the judge or justice of the peace at a time earlier than 
ten days, according to the exigency of the case, and in such event notice thereof shall be given in 
such manner as directed by the order. 
 

 

Page  259 

RULE 604.    RETURN OF SALE 
 
The officer making such sale of perishable property shall promptly pay the proceeds of such sale 
to the clerk of such court or justice of the peace, as the case may be, and shall make written return 
of the order of sale signed by him officially, stating the time and place of the sale, the name of the 
purchaser, and the amount of money received, with an itemized account of the expenses attending 
the sale. Such return shall be filed with the papers of the case. 

RULE 605.    JUDGE MAY MAKE NECESSARY ORDERS 
 
When the perishable personal property levied on under the attachment writ has not been claimed 
or replevied, the judge or justice of the peace may make such orders, either in term time or vacation, 
as may be necessary for its preservation or use. 
 

RULE 606.    RETURN OF WRIT 
 
The officer executing the writ of attachment shall return the writ, with his action endorsed thereon, 
or attached thereto, signed by him officially, to the court from which it issued, at or before 10 
o'clock a.m. of the Monday next after the expiration of fifteen days from the date of issuance of 
the writ. Such return shall describe the property attached with sufficient certainty to identify it, and 
state when the same was attached, and whether any personal property attached remains still in his 
hands, and, if not, the disposition made of the same. When property has been replevied he shall 
deliver the replevy bond to the clerk or justice of the peace to be filed with the papers of the cause. 
 

RULE 607.    REPORT OF DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY 
 
When the property levied on is claimed, replevied or sold, or otherwise disposed of after the writ 
has been returned, the officer having the custody of the same shall immediately make a report in 
writing, signed by him officially, to the clerk, or justice of the peace, as the case may be, showing 
such disposition of the property. Such report shall be filed among the papers of the cause. 
 

RULE 608.    DISSOLUTION OR MODIFICATION OF WRIT OF ATTACHMENT 
 
A defendant whose property has been attached or any intervening party who claims an interest in 
such property, may by sworn written motion, seek to vacate, dissolve, or modify the writ, and the 
order  directing  its  issuance,  for  any  grounds  or  cause,  extrinsic  or  intrinsic.  Such  motion  shall 
admit or deny each finding of the order directing the issuance of the writ except where the movant 
is unable to admit or deny the finding, in which case movant shall set forth the reasons why he 
cannot admit or deny. Unless the parties agree to an extension of time, the motion shall be heard 
promptly, after reasonable notice to the plaintiff (which may be less than three days), and the issue 
shall be determined not later than ten days after the motion is filed. The filing of the motion shall 
Page  260 

   

 

stay  any  further  proceedings  under  the  writ,  except  for  any  orders  concerning  the  care, 
preservation, or sale of perishable property, until a hearing is had and the issue is determined. The 
writ shall be dissolved unless at such hearing, the plaintiff shall prove the grounds relied upon for 
its  issuance,  but  the  court  may  modify  its  previous  order  granting  the  writ  and  the  writ  issued 
pursuant thereto. The movant shall, however, have the burden to prove that the reasonable value 
of the property attached exceeds the amount necessary to secure the debt, interest for one year, and 
probable costs. He shall also have the burden to prove the facts to justify substitution of property. 

he court's determination may be made upon the basis of affidavits, if uncontroverted, setting forth 
such facts as would be admissible in evidence; otherwise, the parties shall submit evidence. The 
court may make all such orders, including orders concerning the care, preservation, or disposition 
of the property (or the proceeds therefrom if the same has been sold), as justice may require. If the 
movant has given a replevy bond, an order to vacate or dissolve the writ shall vacate the replevy 
bond  and  discharge  the  sureties  thereon,  and  if  the  court  modifies  its  order  or  the  writ  issued 
pursuant thereto, it shall make such further orders with respect to the bond as may be consistent 
with its modification. 
 

RULE 609.    AMENDMENT 
 
Clerical errors in the affidavit, bond, or writ of attachment, or the officer's return thereof, may upon 
application in writing to the judge or justice of the court in which the suit is filed, and after notice 
to  the  opponent,  be  amended  in  such  manner  and  on  such  terms  as  the  judge  or  justice  shall 
authorize by an order entered in the minutes of the court or noted on the docket of the justice of 
the peace, provided the amendment does not change or add to the grounds of such attachment as 
stated  in  the  affidavit,  and  provided  such  amendment  appears  to  the  judge  or  justice  to  be  in 
furtherance of justice. 
 

SECTION 2.    DISTRESS WARRANT 

RULE 610.    APPLICATION FOR DISTRESS WARRANT AND ORDER 
 
Either at the commencement of a suit or at any time during its progress the plaintiff may file an 
application for the issuance of a distress warrant with the justice of the peace. Such application 
may be supported by affidavits of the plaintiff, his agent, his attorney, or other persons having 
knowledge  of  relevant  facts,  but  shall  include  a  statement  that  the  amount  sued  for  is  rent,  or 
advances prescribed by statute, or shall produce a writing signed by the tenant to that effect, and 
shall further swear that such warrant is not sued out for the purpose of vexing and harassing the 
defendant. The application shall comply with all statutory requirements and shall state the grounds 
for issuing the warrant and the specific facts relied upon by the plaintiff to warrant the required 
findings by the justice of the peace. The warrant shall not be quashed because two or more grounds 
are  stated  conjunctively  or  disjunctively.  The  application  and  any  affidavits  shall  be  made  on 
personal knowledge and shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence provided that 
facts may be stated based upon information and belief if the grounds of such belief are specifically 
stated.

o warrant shall issue before final judgment except on written order of the justice of the peace 
after a hearing, which may be ex parte. Such warrant shall be made returnable to a court having 
jurisdiction  of  the  amount  in  controversy.  The  justice  of  the  peace  in  his  order  granting  the 
application shall make specific findings of fact to support the statutory grounds found to exist, and 
shall specify the maximum value of property that may be seized, and the amount of bond required 
of plaintiff, and, further shall command that property be kept safe and preserved subject to further 
orders of the court having jurisdiction. Such bond shall be in an amount which, in the opinion of 
the court, shall adequately compensate defendant in the event plaintiff fails to prosecute his suit to 
effect, and pay all damages and costs as shall be adjudged against him for wrongfully suing out 
the warrant. The justice of the peace shall further find in his order the amount of bond required to 
replevy, which, unless the defendant chooses to exercise his option as provided in Rule 614, shall 
be the amount of plaintiff's claim, one year's accrual of interest if allowed by law on the claim, and 
the estimated costs of court. The order may direct the issuance of several warrants at the same 
time, or in succession, to be sent to different counties. 
 

RULE 611.    BOND FOR DISTRESS WARRANT 
 
No distress warrant shall issue before final judgment until the party applying therefor has filed 
with the justice of the peace authorized to issue such warrant a bond payable to the defendant in 
an amount approved by the justice of the peace, with sufficient surety or sureties as provided by 
statute, conditioned that the plaintiff will prosecute his suit to effect and pay all damages and costs 
as may be adjudged against him for wrongfully suing out such warrant. 

fter notice to the opposite party, either before or after the issuance of the warrant, the defendant 
or plaintiff may file a motion to increase or reduce the amount of such bond, or to question the 
sufficiency  of  the  sureties  thereon,  in  a  court  having  jurisdiction  of  the  subject  matter.  Upon 
hearing, the court shall enter its order with respect to such bond and sufficiency of the sureties. 
 

RULE 612.    REQUISITES FOR WARRANT 
 
A distress warrant shall be directed to the sheriff or any constable within the State of Texas. It shall 
command him to attach and hold, unless replevied, subject to the further orders of the court having 
jurisdiction, so much of the property of the defendant, not exempt by statute, of reasonable value 
in approximately the amount fixed by the justice of the peace, as shall be found within his county. 
 

RULE 613.    SERVICE OF WARRANT ON DEFENDANT 
 
The defendant shall be served in any manner prescribed for service of citation, or as provided in 
Rule 21a, with a copy of the distress warrant, the application, accompanying affidavits, and orders 
of the justice of the peace as soon as practicable following the levy of the warrant. There shall be 
prominently displayed on the face of the copy of the warrant served on the defendant, in 10-point

type  and  in  a  manner  calculated  to  advise  a  reasonably  attentive  person  of  its  contents,  the 
following: 

o _________________, Defendant: You are hereby notified that certain properties alleged to be 

owned by you have been seized. If you claim any rights in such property, you are advised: 

YOU  HAVE  A  RIGHT  TO  REGAIN  POSSESSION  OF  THE  PROPERTY  BY  FILING  A 
REPLEVY  BOND.  YOU  HAVE  A  RIGHT  TO  SEEK  TO  REGAIN  POSSESSION  OF  THE 
PROPERTY BY FILING WITH THE COURT A MOTION TO DISSOLVE THIS WARRANT.” 
 

RULE 614.    DEFENDANT MAY REPLEVY 
 
At any time before judgment, should the seized property not have been previously claimed or sold, 
the  defendant  may  replevy  the  same,  or  any  part  thereof,  or  the  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  the 
property  if  it  has  been  sold  under  order  of  the  court,  by  giving  bond  with  sufficient  surety  or 
sureties as  provided  by statute, to  be  approved by  a  court  having jurisdiction  of  the  amount  in 
controversy payable to plaintiff in double the amount of the plaintiff's debt, or, at the defendant's 
option for not less than the value of the property sought to be replevied, plus one year's interest 
thereon at the legal rate from the date of the bond, conditioned that the defendant shall satisfy to 
the extent of the penal amount of the bond any judgment which may be rendered against him in 
such action. 

n reasonable notice to the opposing party (which may be less than three days) either party shall 
have the right to prompt judicial review of the amount of bond required, denial of bond, sufficiency 
of sureties, and estimated value of the property, by a court having jurisdiction of the amount in 
controversy. The court's determination may be made upon the basis of affidavits if uncontroverted 
setting  forth  such  facts  as  would  be  admissible  in  evidence,  otherwise  the  parties  shall  submit 
evidence. The court shall forthwith enter its order either approving or modifying the requirements 
of the order of the justice of the peace, and such order of the court shall supersede and control with 
respect to such matters. 

n reasonable notice to the opposing party (which may be less than three days) the defendant shall 
have the right to move the court for a substitution of property, of equal value as that attached, for 
the property seized. Provided that there has been located sufficient property of the defendant's to 
satisfy the order of seizure, the court may authorize substitution of one or more items of defendant's 
property for all or part of the property seized. The court shall first make findings as to the value of 
the property to be substituted. If property is substituted, the property released from seizure shall 
be delivered to defendant, if such property is personal property, and all liens upon such property 
from the original order of seizure or modification thereof shall be terminated. Seizure of substituted 
property shall be deemed to have existed from the date of levy on the original property seized, and 
no property on which liens have become affixed since the date of levy on the original property 
may be substituted.

RULE 614a.    DISSOLUTION OR MODIFICATION OF DISTRESS WARRANT 
 
A defendant whose property has been seized or any intervening claimant who claims an interest in 
such property, may by sworn written motion, seek to vacate, dissolve, or modify the seizure, and 
the order directing its issuance, for any grounds or cause, extrinsic or intrinsic. Such motion shall 
admit or deny each finding of the order directing the issuance of the warrant except where the 
movant is unable to admit or deny the finding, in which case movant shall set forth the reasons 
why he cannot admit or deny. Unless the parties agree to an extension of time, the motion shall be 
heard promptly, after reasonable notice to the plaintiff (which may be less than three days), and 
the  issue  shall  be  determined  not  later  than  10  days  after  the  motion  is  filed.  The  filing  of  the 
motion shall stay any further proceedings under the warrant, except for any orders concerning the 
care,  preservation,  or  sale  of  any  perishable  property,  until  a  hearing  is  had,  and  the  issue  is 
determined. The warrant shall be dissolved unless, at such hearing, the plaintiff shall prove the 
specific facts alleged and the grounds relied upon for its issuance, but the court may modify the 
order of the justice of the peace granting the warrant and the warrant issued pursuant thereto. The 
movant shall however have the burden to prove that the reasonable value of the property seized 
exceeds the amount necessary to secure the debt, interest for one year, and probable costs. He shall 
also have the burden to prove the facts to justify substitution of property. 

he  court's  determination  may  be  made  upon  the  basis  of  affidavits  setting  forth  such  facts  as 
would  be  admissible  in  evidence,  but  additional  evidence,  if  tendered  by  either  party  shall  be 
received and considered. The court may make all  such  orders,  including  orders concerning the 
care, preservation, or disposition of the property (or the proceeds therefrom if the same has been 
sold), as justice may require. If the movant has given a replevy bond, an order to vacate or dissolve 
the  warrant  shall  vacate  the  replevy  bond  and  discharge  the  sureties  thereon,  and  if  the  court 
modifies the order of the justice of the peace of the warrant issue pursuant thereto, it shall make 
such further orders with respect to the bond as may be consistent with its modification. 
 

RULE 615.    SALE OF PERISHABLE PROPERTY 
 
Whenever personal property which has been levied on under a distress warrant shall not have been 
claimed or replevied, the judge, or justice of the peace, to whose court such writ is made returnable 
may, either in term time or in vacation, order the same to be sold, when it shall be made to appear 
that such property is in danger of serious and immediate waste or decay, or that the keeping of the 
same  until  the  trial  will  necessarily  be  attended  with  such  expense  or  deterioration  in  value  as 
greatly to lessen the amount likely to be realized therefrom. 
 

RULE 616.    TO PROTECT INTERESTS 
 
In determining whether the property levied upon is perishable, and the necessity or advantage of 
ordering a sale thereof, the judge or justice of the peace may act upon affidavits in writing or oral 
testimony, and may by a preliminary order entered of record with or without notice to the parties 
as  the  urgency  of  the  case  in  his  opinion  requires,  direct  the  sheriff  or  constable  to  sell  such 

Page  264 

  T

 

property at public auction for cash, and thereupon the sheriff or constable shall sell it accordingly. 
If the application for an order of sale be filed by any person or party other than the defendant from 
whose possession the property was taken by levy, the court shall not grant such order, unless the 
applicant shall file with such court a bond payable to such defendant, with two or more good and 
sufficient sureties, to be approved by said court, conditioned that they will be responsible to the 
defendant for such damages as he may sustain in case such sale be illegally and unjustly applied 
for, or be illegally and unjustly made. 
 

RULE 617.    PROCEDURE FOR SALE 
 
Such  sale  of  perishable  property  shall  be  conducted  in  the  same  manner  as  sales  of  personal 
property  under  execution;  provided,  however,  that  the  time  of  the  sale,  and  the  time  of 
advertisement thereof, may be fixed by the judge or justice of the peace at a time earlier than ten 
days, according to the exigency of the case, and in such event notice thereof shall be given in such 
manner as directed by the order. 

RULE 618.    RETURN OF SALE 
 
The officer making such sale of perishable property shall promptly pay the proceeds of such sale 
to the clerk of such court or to the justice of the peace, as the case may be, and shall make written 
return of the order of sale, signed by him officially, stating the time and place of the sale, the name 
of the purchaser, and the amount of money received, with an itemized account of the expenses 
attending the sale. Such return shall be filed with the papers of the case. 
 

RULE 619.    CITATION FOR DEFENDANT 
 
The justice at the time he issues the warrant shall issue a citation to the defendant requiring him to 
answer before such justice at the first day of the next succeeding term of court, stating the time 
and place of holding the same, if he has jurisdiction to finally try the cause, and upon its being 
returned served, to proceed to judgment as in ordinary cases; and, if he has not such jurisdiction, 
the citation shall require the defendant to answer before the court to which the warrant was made 
returnable at or before ten o'clock a.m. of the Monday next after the expiration of twenty days from 
the date of service thereof, stating the place of holding the court, and shall be returned with the 
other  papers  to  such  court.  If  the  defendant  has  removed  from  the  county  without  service,  the 
proper officer shall state this fact in his return on the citation; and the court shall proceed to try the 
case ex parte, and may enter judgment. 
 

RULE 620.    PETITION 
 
When  the  warrant  is  made  returnable  to  the  district  or  county  court,  the  plaintiff  shall  file  his 
petition within ten days from the date of the issuance of the writ. 

Page  265 

   

 

SECTION 3.    EXECUTIONS 

RULE 621.    ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENT 
 
The judgments of the district, county, and justice courts shall be enforced by execution or other 
appropriate process. Such execution or other process shall be returnable in thirty, sixty, or ninety 
days as requested by the plaintiff, his agent or attorney. 
 

RULE 621a.    DISCOVERY AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENT 
 
At any time after rendition of judgment, and so long as said judgment has not been suspended by 
a  supersedeas  bond  or by  order  of a  proper  court  and  has  not  become  dormant  as provided  by 
Article 3773, V.A.T.S., the successful party may, for the purpose of obtaining information to aid 
in the enforcement of such judgment, initiate and maintain in the trial court in the same suit in 
which said judgment was rendered any discovery proceeding authorized by these rules for pre-trial 
matters.  Also,  at  any  time  after  rendition  of  judgment,  either  party  may,  for  the  purpose  of 
obtaining information relevant to motions allowed by Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure 47 and 
49 initiate and maintain in the trial court in the same suit in which said judgment was rendered any 
discovery  proceeding  authorized  by  these  rules  for  pre-trial  matters.  The  rules  governing  and 
related to such pre-trial discovery proceedings shall apply in like manner to discovery proceedings 
after judgment. The rights herein granted to the parties shall inure to their successors or assignees, 
in whole or in part. Judicial supervision of such discovery proceedings after judgment shall be the 
same  as  that  provided  by  law  or  these  rules  for  pre-trial  discovery  and  proceedings  insofar  as 
applicable. 
 

RULE 622.    EXECUTION 
 
An execution is a process of the court from which it is issued. The clerk of the district or county 
court or the justice of the peace, as the case may be, shall tax the costs in every case in which a 
final judgment has been rendered and shall issue execution to enforce such judgment and collect 
such costs. The execution and subsequent executions shall not be addressed to a particular county, 
but shall be addressed to any sheriff or any constable within the State of Texas. 
 

RULE 623.    ON DEATH OF EXECUTOR 
 
When an executor, administrator, guardian or trustee of an express trust dies, or ceases to be such 
executor, administrator, guardian or trustee after judgment, execution shall issue on such judgment 
in the name of his successor, upon an affidavit of such death or termination being filed with the 
clerk of the court or the justice of the peace, as the case may be, together with the certificate of the 
appointment  of  such  successor  under  the  hand  and  seal  of  the  clerk  of  the  court  wherein  the 
appointment was made. 

Page  266 

   

 

 

 

RULE 624.    ON DEATH OF NOMINAL PLAINTIFF 
 
When a person in whose favor a judgment is rendered for the use of another dies after judgment, 
execution shall issue in the name of the party for whose use the suit was brought upon an affidavit 
of such death being filed with the clerk of the court or the justice of the peace. 
 

RULE 625.    ON MONEY OF DECEASED 
 
If a sole defendant dies after judgment for money against him, execution shall not issue thereon, 
but the judgment may be proved up and paid in due course of administration. 
 

RULE 626.    ON PROPERTY OF DECEASED 
 
In any case of judgment other than a money judgment, where the sole defendant, or one or more 
of several joint defendants, shall die after judgment, upon an affidavit of such death being filed 
with the clerk, together with the certificate of the appointment of a representative of such decedent 
under the hand and seal of the clerk of the court wherein such appointment was made, the proper 
process on such judgment shall issue against such representative. 
 

RULE 627.    TIME FOR ISSUANCE 
 
If no supersedeas bond or notice of appeal, as required of agencies exempt from filing bonds, has 
been filed and approved, the clerk of the court or justice of the peace shall issue the execution upon 
such judgment upon application of the successful party or his attorney after the expiration of thirty 
days  from  the  time  a  final  judgment  is  signed.  If  a  timely  motion  for  new  trial  or  in  arrest  of 
judgment is filed, the clerk shall issue the execution upon the judgment on application of the party 
or his attorney after the expiration of thirty days from the time the order overruling the motion is 
signed or from the time the motion is overruled by operation of law. 
 

RULE 628.    EXECUTION WITHIN THIRTY DAYS 
 
Such execution may be issued at any time before the thirtieth day upon the filing of an affidavit by 
the  plaintiff  in  the  judgment  or  his agent  or  attorney  that the  defendant  is  about  to  remove  his 
personal property subject to execution by law out of the county, or is about to transfer or secrete 
such personal property for the purpose of defrauding his creditors. 
 

RULE 629.    REQUISITES OF EXECUTION 
 
The style of the execution shall be “The State of Texas.” It shall be directed to any sheriff or any 

Page  267 

constable within the State of Texas. It shall be signed by the clerk or justice officially, and bear 
the seal of the court, if issued out of the district or county court, and shall require the officer to 
execute  it  according  to its  terms,  and  to  make  the  costs  which  have  been  adjudged  against  the 
defendant in execution and the further costs of executing the writ. It shall describe the judgment, 
stating the court in which, and the time when, rendered, and the names of the parties in whose 
favor  and  against  whom  the  judgment  was  rendered.  A  correct  copy  of  the  bill  of  costs  taxed 
against the defendant in execution shall be attached to the writ. It shall require the officer to return 
it within thirty, sixty, or ninety days, as directed by the plaintiff or his attorney. 
 

RULE 630.    EXECUTION ON JUDGMENT FOR MONEY 
 
When an execution is issued upon a judgment for a sum of money, or directing the payment simply 
of a sum of money, it must specify in the body thereof the sum recovered or directed to be paid 
and the sum actually due when it is issued and the rate of interest upon the sum due. It must require 
the officer to satisfy the judgment and costs out of the property of the judgment debtor subject to 
execution by law. 

RULE 631.    EXECUTION FOR SALE OF PARTICULAR PROPERTY 
 
An execution issued upon a judgment for the sale of particular chattels or personal property or real 
estate,  must  particularly  describe  the  property,  and  shall  direct  the  officer  to  make  the  sale  by 
previously giving the public notice of the time and place of sale required by law and these rules. 
 

RULE 632.    EXECUTION FOR DELIVERY OF CERTAIN PROPERTY 
 
An execution issued upon a judgment for the delivery of the possession of a chattel or personal 
property,  or  for  the  delivery  of  the  possession  of  real  property,  shall  particularly  describe  the 
property,  and  designate  the  party to whom  the  judgment  awards  the  possession.  The  writ shall 
require the officer to deliver the possession of the property to the party entitled thereto. 
 

RULE 633.    EXECUTION FOR POSSESSION OR VALUE OF PERSONAL 
PROPERTY 
 
If the judgment be for the recovery of personal property or its value, the writ shall command the 
officer, in case a delivery thereof cannot be had, to levy and collect the value thereof for which the 
judgment was recovered, to be specified therein, out of any property of the party against whom 
judgment was rendered, liable to execution. 
 

RULE 634.    EXECUTION SUPERSEDED 
 
Page  268 

   

 

The  clerk  or  justice  of  the  peace  shall  immediately  issue  a  writ  of  supersedeas  suspending  all 
further proceedings under any execution previously issued when a supersedeas bond is afterward 
filed and approved within the time prescribed by law or these rules. 
 

RULE 635.    STAY OF EXECUTION IN JUSTICE COURT 
 
At any time within ten days after the rendition of any judgment in a justice court, the justice may 
grant a stay of execution thereof for three months from the date of such judgment, if the person 
against whom such judgment was rendered shall, with one or more good and sufficient sureties, to 
be  approved  by  the  justice,  appear  before  him  and  acknowledge  themselves  and  each  of  them 
bound to the successful party in such judgment for the full amount thereof, with interest and costs, 
which  acknowledgment  shall  be  entered  in  writing  on  the  docket,  and  signed  by  the  persons 
binding themselves as sureties; provided, no such stay of execution shall be granted unless the 
party applying therefor shall first file an affidavit with the justice that he has not the money with 
which to pay such judgment, and that the enforcement of same by execution prior to three months 
would be a hardship upon him and would cause a sacrifice of his property which would not likely 
be caused should said execution be stayed. Such acknowledgment shall be entered by the justice 
on his docket and shall constitute a judgment against the defendant and such sureties, upon which 
execution shall issue in case the same is not paid on or before the expiration of such day. 

RULE 636.    INDORSEMENTS BY OFFICER 
 
The officer receiving the execution shall indorse thereon the exact hour and day when he received 
it. If he receives more than one on the same day against the same person he shall number them as 
received. 
 

RULE 637.    LEVY OF EXECUTION 
 
When an execution is delivered to an officer he shall proceed without delay to levy the same upon 
the property of the defendant found within his county not exempt from execution, unless otherwise 
directed by the plaintiff, his agent or attorney. The officer shall first call upon the defendant, if he 
can be found, or, if absent, upon his agent within the county, if known, to point out property to be 
levied upon, and the levy shall first be made upon the property designated by the defendant, or his 
agent. If in the opinion of the officer the property so designated will not sell for enough to satisfy 
the execution and costs of sale, he shall require an additional designation by the defendant. If no 
property be thus designated by the defendant, the officer shall levy the execution upon any property 
of the defendant subject to execution. 
 

RULE 638.    PROPERTY NOT TO BE DESIGNATED 
 
A defendant in execution shall not point out property which he has sold, mortgaged or conveyed 

Page  269 

   

 

in trust, or property exempt from forced sale. 
 

RULE 639.    LEVY 
 
In order to make a levy on real estate, it shall not be necessary for the officer to go upon the ground 
but is shall be sufficient for him to indorse such levy on the writ. Levy upon personal property is 
made by taking possession thereof, when the defendant in execution is entitled to the possession. 
Where the defendant in execution has an interest in personal property, but is not entitled to the 
possession thereof, a levy is made thereon by giving notice thereof to the person who is entitled to 
the possession, or one of them where there are several. 
 

RULE 640.    LEVY ON STOCK RUNNING AT LARGE 
 
A levy upon livestock running at large in a range, and which cannot be herded and penned without 
great inconvenience and expense, may be made by designating by reasonable estimate the number 
of animals and describing them by their marks and brands, or either; such levy shall be made in 
the presence of two or more credible persons, and notice thereof shall be given in writing to the 
owner or his herder or agent, if residing within the county and known to the officer. 

RULE 641.    LEVY ON SHARES OF STOCK 
 
A levy upon shares of stock of any corporation or joint stock company for which a certificate is 
outstanding  is  made  by  the  officer  seizing  and  taking  possession  of  such  certificate.  Provided, 
however,  that  nothing  herein  shall  be  construed  as  restricting  any  rights  granted  under  Section 
8.317 of the Texas Uniform Commercial Code. 

[RULE 642.    Repealed effective January 1, 1976] 
 

RULE 643.    LEVY ON GOODS PLEDGED OR MORTGAGED 
 
Goods and chattels pledged, assigned or mortgaged as security for any debt or contract, may be 
levied upon and sold on execution against the person making the pledge, assignment or mortgage 
subject thereto; and the purchaser shall be entitled to the possession when it is held by the pledgee, 
assignee or mortgagee, on complying with the conditions of the pledge, assignment or mortgage. 
 

RULE 644.    MAY GIVE DELIVERY BOND 
 
Any personal property taken in execution may be returned to the defendant by the officer upon the 
delivery by the defendant to him of a bond, payable to the plaintiff, with two or more good and 

Page  270 

   

   

 

sufficient sureties, to be approved by the officer, conditioned that the property shall be delivered 
to  the  officer  at  the  time  and  place named  in  the  bond,  to  be  sold  according  to  law,  or  for  the 
payment to the officer of a fair value thereof, which shall be stated in the bond. 
 

RULE 645.    PROPERTY MAY BE SOLD BY DEFENDANT 
 
Where property has been replevied, as provided in the preceding rule, the defendant may sell or 
dispose of the same, paying the officer the stipulated value thereof. 
 

RULE 646.    FORFEITED DELIVERY BOND 
 
In case of the non-delivery of the property according to the terms of the delivery bond, and non-
payment of the value thereof, the officer shall forthwith indorse the bond “Forfeited” and return 
the  same  to the  clerk  of  the  court  or  the  justice of  the  peace  from  which  the  execution  issued; 
whereupon, if the judgment remain unsatisfied in whole or in part, the clerk or justice shall issue 
execution  against  the  principal  debtor  and  the  sureties  on  the  bond  for  the  amount  due,  not 
exceeding the stipulated value of the property, upon which execution no delivery bond shall be 
taken, which instruction shall be indorsed by the clerk or justice on the execution. 

RULE 646a.    SALE OF REAL PROPERTY 
 
Real property taken by virtue of any execution shall be sold at public auction, at the courthouse 
door of the county, unless the court orders that such sale be at the place where the real property is 
situated, on the first Tuesday of the month, between the hours of ten o'clock, a.m. and four o'clock, 
p.m. 
 

RULE 647.    NOTICE OF SALE OF REAL ESTATE 
 
The time and place of sale of real estate under execution, order of sale, or venditioni exponas, shall 
be advertised by the officer by having the notice thereof published in the English language once a 
week  for  three  consecutive  weeks  preceding  such  sale,  in  some  newspaper  published  in  said 
county. The first of said publications shall appear not less than twenty days immediately preceding 
the day of sale. Said notice shall contain a statement of the authority by virtue of which the sale is 
to be made, the time of levy, and the time and place of sale; it shall also contain a brief description 
of the property to be sold, and shall give the number of acres, original survey, locality in the county, 
and the name by which the land is most generally known, but it shall not be necessary for it to 
contain field notes. Publishers of newspapers shall charge the legal rate of Two (2) Cents per word 
for the first insertion of such publication and One (1) Cent per word for such subsequent insertions, 
or such newspapers shall be entitled to charge for such publication at a rate equal to but not in 
excess of the published word or line rate of that newspaper for such class of advertising. If there 
be no newspaper published in the county, or none which will publish the notice of sale for the 

Page  271 

   

 

compensation herein fixed, the officer shall then post such notice in writing in three public places 
in the county, one of which shall be at the courthouse door of such county, for at least twenty days 
successively next before the day of sale. The officer making the levy shall give the defendant, or 
his attorney, written notice of such sale, either in person or by mail, which notice shall substantially 
conform to the foregoing requirements. 
 

RULE 648.    "COURTHOUSE DOOR" DEFINED 
 
By the term “courthouse door” of a county is meant either of the principal entrances to the house 
provided by the proper authority for the holding of the district court. If from any cause there is no 
such house, the door of the house where the district court was last held in that county shall be 
deemed to be the courthouse door. Where the courthouse, or house used by the court, has been 
destroyed by fire or other cause, and another has not been designated by the proper authority, the 
place where such house stood shall be deemed to be the courthouse door. 
 

RULE 649.    SALE OF PERSONAL PROPERTY 
 
Personal property levied on under execution shall be offered for sale on the premises where it is 
taken in execution, or at the courthouse door of the county, or at some other place if, owing to the 
nature of the property, it is  more  convenient to  exhibit  it  to  purchasers at such place. Personal 
property susceptible of being exhibited shall not be sold unless the same be present and subject to 
the  view  of  those  attending  the  sale,  except  shares  of  stock  in  joint  stock  or  incorporated 
companies, and in cases where the defendant in execution has merely an interest without right to 
the exclusive possession in which case the interest of defendant may be sold and conveyed without 
the presence or delivery of the property. When a levy is made upon livestock running at large on 
the range, it is not necessary that such stock, or any part thereof, be present at the place of sale, 
and the purchaser at such sale is authorized to gather and pen such stock and select therefrom the 
number purchased by him. 
 

RULE 650.    NOTICE OF SALE OF PERSONAL PROPERTY 
 
Previous notice of the time and place of the sale of any personal property levied on under execution 
shall be given by posting notice thereof for ten days successively immediately prior to the date of 
sale at the courthouse door of any county and at the place where the sale is to be made. 
 

RULE 651.    WHEN EXECUTION IS NOT SATISFIED 
 
When the property levied upon does not sell for enough to satisfy the execution, the officer shall 
proceed anew, as in the first instance, to make the residue. 

 

Page  272 

 

RULE 652.    PURCHASER FAILING TO COMPLY 
 
If any person shall bid off property at any sale made by virtue of an execution, and shall fail to 
comply with the terms of the sale, he shall be liable to pay the plaintiff in execution twenty per 
cent on the value of the property thus bid off, besides costs, to be recovered on motion, five days 
notice of such motion being given to such purchaser; and should the property on a second sale 
bring less than on the former, he shall be liable to pay to the defendant in execution all loss which 
he sustains thereby, to be recovered on motion as above provided. 
 

RULE 653.    RESALE OF PROPERTY 
 
When  the  terms  of  the  sale  shall  not  be  complied  with  by  the  bidder  the  levying  officer  shall 
proceed to sell the same property again on the same day, if there be sufficient time; but if not, he 
shall readvertise and sell the same as in the first instance. 
 

RULE 654.    RETURN OF EXECUTION 
 
The levying officer shall make due return of the execution, in writing and signed by him officially, 
stating concisely what such officer has done in pursuance of the requirements of the writ and of 
the law. The return shall be filed with the clerk of the court or the justice of the peace as the case 
may be. The execution shall be returned forthwith if satisfied by the collection of the money or if 
ordered by the plaintiff or his attorney indorsed thereon. 

RULE 655.    RETURN OF EXECUTION BY MAIL 
 
When an execution is placed in the hands of an officer of a county other than the one in which the 
judgment  is  rendered,  return  may  be  made  by  mail;  but  money  cannot  be  thus  sent  except  by 
direction of the party entitled to receive the same or his attorney of record. 
 

RULE 656.    EXECUTION DOCKET 
 
The clerk of each court shall keep an execution docket in which he shall enter a statement of all 
executions  as  they  are  issued  by  him,  specifying  the  names  of  the  parties,  the  amount  of  the 
judgment, the amount due thereon, the rate of interest when it exceeds six per cent, the costs, the 
date of issuing the execution, to whom delivered, and the return of the officer thereon, with the 
date of such return. Such docket entries shall be taken and deemed to be a record. The clerk shall 
keep  an  index  and  cross-index  to  the  execution  docket.  When  execution  is  in  favor  or  against 
several persons, it shall be indexed in the name of each person. Any clerk who shall fail to keep 
said execution docket and index thereto, or shall neglect to make the entries therein, shall be liable 
upon his official bond to any person injured for the amount of damages sustained by such neglect.

SECTION 4.    GARNISHMENT 
 

RULE 657.    JUDGMENT FINAL FOR GARNISHMENT 
 
In  the  case  mentioned  in  subsection  3,  section  63.001,  Civil  Practice  and  Remedies  Code,  the 
judgment whether based upon a liquidated demand or an unliquidated demand, shall be deemed 
final and subsisting for the purpose of garnishment from and after the date it is signed, unless a 
supersedeas bond shall have been approved and filed in accordance with Texas Rule of Appellate 
Procedure 47. 
 

RULE 658.    APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF GARNISHMENT AND ORDER 
 
Either at the commencement of a suit or at any time during its progress the plaintiff may file an 
application  for  a  writ  of  garnishment.  Such  application  shall  be  supported  by  affidavits  of  the 
plaintiff,  his  agent,  his  attorney,  or  other  person  having  knowledge  of  relevant  facts.  The 
application shall comply with all statutory requirements and shall state the grounds for issuing the 
writ and the specific facts relied upon by the plaintiff to warrant the required findings by the court. 
The  writ  shall  not  be  quashed  because  two  or  more  grounds  are  stated  conjunctively  or 
disjunctively. The application and any affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge and shall 
set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence; provided that facts may be stated based 
upon information and belief if the grounds of such belief are specifically stated. 

o writ shall issue before final judgment except upon written order of the court after a hearing, 
which may be ex parte. The court in its order granting the application shall make specific findings 
of facts to support the statutory grounds found to exist, and shall specify the maximum value of 
property or indebtedness that may be garnished and the amount of bond required of plaintiff. Such 
bond  shall  be  in  an  amount  which,  in  the  opinion  of  the  court,  shall  adequately  compensate 
defendant in the event plaintiff fails to prosecute his suit to effect, and pay all damages and costs 
as shall be adjudged against him for wrongfully suing out the writ of garnishment. The court shall 
further  find  in  its  order  the  amount  of  bond  required  of  defendant  to  replevy,  which,  unless 
defendant exercises his option as provided under Rule 664, shall be the amount of plaintiff's claim, 
one year's accrual of interest if allowed by law on the claim, and the estimated costs of court. The 
order may direct  the  issuance of several writs  at  the same time, or in succession, to be sent to 
different counties. 
 

RULE 658a.    BOND FOR GARNISHMENT 
 
No writ of garnishment shall issue before final judgment until the party applying therefor has filed 
with the officer authorized to issue such writ a bond payable to the defendant in the amount fixed 
by the court's order, with sufficient surety or sureties as provided by statute, conditioned that the 
plaintiff will prosecute his suit to effect and pay to the extent of the penal amount of the bond all 

Page  274 

   

 

  N

damages  and  costs  as  may  be  adjudged  against  him  for  wrongfully  suing  out  such  writ  of 
garnishment. 

fter notice to the opposite party, either before or after the issuance of the writ, the defendant or 
plaintiff  may  file  a  motion  to  increase  or  reduce  the  amount  of  such  bond,  or  to  question  the 
sufficiency of the sureties. Upon hearing, the court shall enter its order with respect to such bond 
and the sufficiency of the sureties. 

hould it be determined from the garnishee's answer if such is not controverted that the garnishee 
is indebted to the defendant, or has in his hands effects belonging to the defendant, in an amount 
or value less than the amount of the debt claimed by the plaintiff, then after notice to the defendant 
the court in which such garnishment is pending upon hearing may reduce the required amount of 
such bond to double the sum of the garnishee's indebtedness to the defendant plus the value of the 
effects in his hands belonging to the defendant. 
 

RULE 659.    CASE DOCKETED 
 
When the foregoing requirements of these rules have been complied with, the judge, or clerk, or 
justice of the peace, as the case may be, shall docket the case in the name of the plaintiff as plaintiff 
and of the garnishee as defendant; and shall immediately issue a writ of garnishment directed to 
the garnishee, commanding him to appear before the court out of which the same is issued at or 
before 10 o'clock a.m. of the Monday next following the expiration of twenty days from the date 
the writ was served, if the writ is issued out of the district or county court; or the Monday next 
after the expiration of ten days from the date the writ was served, if the writ is issued out of the 
justice court. The writ shall command the garnishee to answer under oath upon such return date 
what, if anything, he is indebted to the defendant, and was when the writ was served, and what 
effects, if any, of the defendant he has in his possession, and had when such writ was served, and 
what other persons, if any, within his knowledge, are indebted to the defendant or have effects 
belonging to him in their possession. 

RULE 660.    Repealed effective December 31, 1947]

of the writ of garnishment, the application, accompanying affidavits, and orders of the court as 
soon as practicable after service of the writ on the garnishee. The face of the writ served on the 
defendant  must  display  in  at  least  twelve-point  type  and  in  a  manner  calculated  to  advise  a 
reasonably attentive person of its contents, the following notice: 

To _________________, Defendant: / A ____________________________, Demandado:   

our money or property has been frozen or seized (“garnished”) because 

___________________________ (the “Garnishor”) has filed a garnishment proceeding. That 
means they are trying to get your money or property from ___________________________ (the 
“Garnishee”), the company or person who has it, to pay a debt you owe. / Su dinero o propiedad 
le han sido inmovilizados o incautados (“embargados”) porque 
___________________________, (el “Embargante”), ha entablado ante tribunales un auto 
procesal de embargo con la intención de obtener su dinero o propiedad de 
___________________________, (el “Embargado”), que es la compañía o persona física que

  “

  Y

 

los tiene, y como pago de lo que usted le adeuda.   

f you are an individual (not a company), your money or property may be protected 
(“exempt”) from garnishment under federal or state law. Under Texas Rule of Civil 
Procedure 679b, the Garnishor must send you in the next few days a “Notice of Protected 
Property Rights” approved by the Supreme Court. Read that notice carefully for more 
information on what property can be protected and how to get your protected money or property 
back. You can ask the court to get your money or property back by turning in (“filing”) the 
“Protected Property Claim Form” that will be sent with the Notice of Protected Property Rights. / 
Si usted es una persona física (y no una compañía), su dinero o propiedad pudieran estar 
protegidos (“eximidos”) de ser embargados de acuerdo a lo dispuesto en las leyes federales o 
estatales. Bajo la Norma de Derecho Procesal Civil Número 679b, el Embargante debe enviarle 
en los próximos días una “Notificación Sobre Derechos de Propiedad Protegida” aprobada por 
el Tribunal Supremo de Justicia. Lea con cuidado esta notificación para que obtenga mayor 
información sobre qué dinero y propiedades están protegidos y cómo recuperarlos. Puede 
solicitar que se le regresen sus propiedades y dinero que están protegidos entregando 
(“presentando”) ante el tribunal el “Formulario de Reclamo de Propiedad Protegida” que le 
será enviado junto con la “Notificación Sobre Derechos de Propiedad Protegida”. 

ou may also file a “motion to dissolve” or “motion to modify” this writ of garnishment with the 
court because your money or property is exempt from garnishment. You can also get your money 
back if you file a “replevy bond,” which is cash or other security in an amount set by the court. / 
Usted también pudiera presentar por escrito una “petición de disolución” o “petición de 
modificación” de este auto procesal de embargo, ya que su dinero y propiedad están exentos de 
dicho embargo. También puede recuperar su dinero si presenta ante tribunales una “fianza 
reivindicatoria”, la cual es una garantía en efectivo o con fiador en una cantidad impuesta por 
el tribunal.

Comment  to  2022  change:  Rule  663a  is  amended  to  implement  section  22.0042  of  the  Texas 
Government Code and to conform with new Rule 679b. A plaintiff serving a writ of garnishment 
on the defendant under this rule must also serve the defendant with the Notice of Protected Property 
Rights, the Instructions for Protected Property Claim Form, and the Protected Property Claim Form 
approved  by  the  Supreme  Court,  as  required  by  new  Rule  679b.  Other  clarifying  and  stylistic 
changes have been made. 
 

RULE 664.    DEFENDANT MAY REPLEVY 
 
At any time before judgment, should the garnished property not have been previously claimed or 
sold, the defendant may replevy the same, or any part thereof, or the proceeds from the sale of the 
property  if  it  has  been  sold  under  order  of  the  court,  by  giving  bond  with  sufficient  surety  or 
sureties  as  provided  by  statute,  to  be  approved  by  the  officer  who  levied  the  writ,  payable  to 
plaintiff, in the amount fixed by the court's order, or, at the defendant's option, for the value of the 
property or indebtedness sought to be replevied (to be estimated by the officer), plus one year's 
interest  thereon  at  the  legal  rate  from  the  date  of  the  bond,  conditioned  that  the  defendant, 
garnishee, shall satisfy, to the extent of the penal amount of the bond, any judgment which may be 
rendered against him in such action. 

n reasonable notice to the opposing party (which may be less than three days) either party shall 
have the right to prompt judicial review of the amount of bond required, denial of bond, sufficiency 
of sureties, and estimated value of the property, by the court which authorized issuance of the writ. 
The court's determination may be made upon the basis of affidavits, if uncontroverted, setting forth 
such facts as would be admissible in evidence; otherwise, the parties shall submit evidence. The 
court shall forthwith enter its order either approving or modifying the requirements of the officer 
or of the court's prior order, and such order of the court shall supersede and control with respect to 
such matters. 

n reasonable notice to the opposing party (which may be less than three days) the defendant shall 
have the right to move the court for a substitution of property, of equal value as that garnished, for 
the property garnished. Provided that there has been located sufficient property of the defendant's 
to satisfy the order of garnishment, the court may authorize substitution of one or more items of 
defendant's property for all or for part of the property garnished. The court shall first make findings 
as to the value of the property to be substituted. If property is substituted, the property released 
from garnishment shall be delivered to defendant, if such property is personal property, and all 
liens upon such property from the original order of garnishment or modification thereof shall be 
terminated.  Garnishment  of  substituted  property  shall  be  deemed  to  have  existed  from  date  of 
garnishment  on  the  original  property  garnished,  and  no  property  on  which  liens  have  become 
affixed since the date of garnishment of the original property may be substituted. 
 

RULE 664a.    DISSOLUTION OR MODIFICATION OF WRIT OF GARNISHMENT 
 
A defendant whose property or account has been garnished or any intervening party who claims 
an  interest  in  such  property  or  account,  may  file  a  motion  to  dissolve  or  modify  the  writ  of 

Page  278 

  O

  O

 

garnishment,  the  order  directing  its  issuance,  or  both  for  any  grounds  or  cause,  extrinsic  or 
intrinsic.  The  motion  must  be  sworn  and  must  admit  or  deny  each  finding  stated  in  the  order 
directing the issuance of the writ. If the movant is unable to admit or deny a finding, the movant 
must state the reasons why the movant cannot admit or deny. If the movant seeks to dissolve or 
modify the writ or order based on personal property exemptions and provides the same information 
as in the Personal Property Claim Form approved by the Supreme Court, the court must follow the 
procedures provided by Rule 679b. 

 motion to dissolve or modify based on other grounds must be heard promptly, after reasonable 
notice to the plaintiff (which may be less than three days), and must be determined within ten days 
after the motion is filed, unless extended for good cause shown. The filing of the motion stays any 
further proceedings under the writ, except for any orders concerning the care, preservation, or sale 
of any perishable property, until a hearing is had, and the issue is determined. The writ must be 
dissolved  unless,  at  such  hearing,  the  plaintiff proves  the  statutory  grounds  relied upon  for the 
writ’s issuance, but the court may modify its previous order granting the writ and the writ. The 
movant,  however,  has  the  burden  to  prove  that  the  reasonable  value  of  the  property  garnished 
exceeds the amount necessary to secure the debt, interest for one year, and probable costs. The 
movant also has the burden to prove facts to justify substitution of property.   

he court’s determination may be made upon the basis of sworn statements, if not challenged, 
setting forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence; otherwise, the parties must submit 
evidence. The court may make all such orders, including orders concerning the care, preservation, 
disposition, release, or substitution of property (or its proceeds if the property has been sold), as 
justice may require. If the movant has given a replevy bond, an order to dissolve the writ must 
vacate the replevy bond and discharge the sureties thereon. If the court modifies its order or the 
writ,  it  must  make  such  further  orders  with  respect  to  the  bond  as  may  be  consistent  with  its 
modification. 
 

Notes and Comments 

omment  to  2022  change:  Rule  664a  is  amended  to  implement  section  22.0042  of  the  Texas 
Government Code and to conform with new Rule 679b. Other clarifying and stylistic changes have 
been made. 
 

RULE 665.    ANSWER TO WRIT 
 
The answer of the garnishee shall be under oath, in writing and signed by him, and shall make true 
answers to the several matters inquired of in the writ of garnishment. 
 

RULE 666.    GARNISHEE DISCHARGED 
 
If it appears from the answer of the garnishee that he is not indebted to the defendant, and was not 
so  indebted  when  the  writ  of  garnishment  was  served  upon  him,  and  that  he  has  not  in  his 
possession any effects of the defendant and had not when the writ was served, and if he has either

denied that any other persons within his knowledge are indebted to the defendant or have in their 
possession effects belonging to the defendant, or else has named such persons, should the answer 
of  the  garnishee  not  be  controverted  as  hereinafter  provided,  the  court  shall  enter  judgment 
discharging the garnishee. 

RULE 667.    JUDGMENT BY DEFAULT 
 
If the garnishee fails to file an answer to the writ of garnishment at or before the time directed in 
the writ, it shall be lawful for the court, at any time after judgment shall have been rendered against 
the defendant, and on or after appearance day, to render judgment by default, as in other civil cases, 
against such garnishee for the full amount of such judgment against the defendant together with 
all  interest  and  costs  that  may  have  accrued  in  the  main  case  and  also  in  the  garnishment 
proceedings. The answer of the garnishee may be filed as in any other civil case at any time before 
such default judgment is rendered. 
 

RULE 668.    JUDGMENT WHEN GARNISHEE IS INDEBTED 
 
Should it appear from the answer of the garnishee or should it be otherwise made to appear and be 
found by the court that the garnishee is indebted to the defendant in any amount, or was so indebted 
when the writ of garnishment was served, the court shall render judgment for the plaintiff against 
the garnishee for the amount so admitted or found to be due to the defendant from the garnishee, 
unless such amount is in excess of the amount of the plaintiff's judgment against the defendant 
with interest and costs, in which case, judgment shall be rendered against the garnishee for the full 
amount of the judgment already rendered against the defendant, together with interest and costs of 
the suit in the original case and also in the garnishment proceedings. If the garnishee fail or refuse 
to pay such judgment rendered against him, execution shall issue thereon in the same manner and 
under the same conditions as is or may be provided for the issuance of execution in other cases. 
 

RULE 669.    JUDGMENT FOR EFFECTS 
 
Should it appear from the garnishee's answer, or otherwise, that the garnishee has in his possession, 
or had when the writ was served, any effects of the defendant liable to execution, including any 
certificates  of  stock  in  any  corporation  or  joint  stock  company,  the  court  shall  render  a  decree 
ordering sale of such effects under execution in satisfaction of plaintiff's judgment and directing 
the  garnishee  to  deliver  them,  or  so  much  thereof  as  shall  be  necessary  to  satisfy  plaintiff's 
judgment, to the proper officer for that purpose. 
 

RULE 670.    REFUSAL TO DELIVER EFFECTS 
 
Should the garnishee adjudged to have effects of the defendant in his possession, as provided in 
the preceding rule, fail or refuse to deliver them to the sheriff or constable on such demand, the 

Page  280 

   

 

officer  shall  immediately  make  return  of  such  failure  or  refusal,  whereupon  on  motion  of  the 
plaintiff, the garnishee shall be cited to show cause upon a date to be fixed by the court why he 
should not be attached for contempt of court for such failure or refusal. If the garnishee fails to 
show  some  good  and  sufficient  excuse  for  such  failure  or  refusal,  he  shall  be  fined  for  such 
contempt and imprisoned until he shall deliver such effects. 

[RULE 671.    Repealed effective December 31, 1947] 
 

RULE 672.    SALE OF EFFECTS 
 
The sale so ordered shall be conducted in all respects as other sales of personal property under 
execution; and the officer making such sale shall execute a transfer of such effects or interest to 
the purchaser, with a brief recital of the judgment of the court under which the same was sold.   
 

RULE 673.    MAY TRAVERSE ANSWER 
 
If the plaintiff should not be satisfied with the answer of any garnishee, he may controvert the 
same by his affidavit stating that he has good reason to believe, and does believe, that the answer 
of the garnishee is incorrect, stating in what particular he believes the same to be incorrect. The 
defendant may also, in like manner, controvert the answer of the garnishee. 
 

RULE 674.    TRIAL OF ISSUE 
 
If the garnishee whose answer is controverted, is a resident of the county in which the proceeding 
is pending, an issue shall be formed under the direction of the court and tried as in other cases.

The clerk of the court or the justice of the peace, on receiving certified copies filed in the county 
of the garnishee's residence under the provisions of the statutes, shall docket the case in the name 
of the plaintiff as plaintiff, and of the garnishee as defendant, and issue a notice to the garnishee, 
stating  that his answer has  been so controverted,  and that such issue will  stand  for trial on the 
docket of such court. Such notice shall be directed to the garnishee, be dated and tested as other 
process  from  such  court,  and  served  by  delivering  a  copy  thereof  to  the  garnishee.  It  shall  be 
returnable, if issued from the district or county court, at ten o'clock a.m. of the Monday next after 
the expiration of twenty days from the date of its service; and if issued from the justice court, to 
the next term of such court convening after the expiration of twenty days after the service of such 
notice.

RULE 676.    ISSUE TRIED IN OTHER CASES 
 
Upon the return of such notice served, an issue shall be formed under the direction of the court and 
tried as in other cases. 

RULE 677.    COSTS 
 
Where  the  garnishee  is  discharged  upon  his  answer,  the  costs  of  the  proceeding,  including  a 
reasonable compensation to the garnishee, shall be taxed against the plaintiff; where the answer of 
the garnishee has not been controverted and the garnishee is held thereon, such costs shall be taxed 
against the defendant and included in the execution provided for in this section; where the answer 
is contested, the costs shall abide the issue of such contest. 
 

RULE 678.    GARNISHEE DISCHARGED ON PROOF 
 
It shall be a sufficient answer to any claim of the defendant against the garnishee founded on an 
indebtedness of such garnishee, or on the possession by him of any effects, for the garnishee to 
show that such indebtedness has been paid, or such effects, including any certificates of stock in 
any  incorporated  or  joint  stock  company,  have  been  delivered  to  any  sheriff  or  constable  as 
provided for in Rule 669. 
 

RULE 679.    AMENDMENT 
 
Clerical errors in the affidavit, bond, or writ of garnishment or the officer's return thereof, may

notice to the opponent, be amended in such manner and on such terms as the judge or justice shall 
authorize by an order entered in the minutes of the court (or noted on the docket of the justice of 
the peace), provided such amendment appears to the judge or justice to be in furtherance of justice. 
 

RULE 679a.    TURNOVER UNDER CIVIL PRACTICE AND REMEDIES CODE § 
31.002 

Order Appointing Turnover Receiver in Justice Courts. If a justice of the peace issues an 
order appointing a receiver under section 31.002 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code 
to collect a judgment owed by an individual judgment debtor, the justice of the peace must 
use the Order Appointing Receiver approved by the Supreme Court, except on good cause 
shown in a written order.   

Order Appointing Turnover Receiver in All Courts. A court that issues an order appointing 
a  receiver  under  section  31.002  of  the  Civil  Practice  and  Remedies  Code  to  collect  a 
judgment owed by an individual judgment debtor may use the Order Appointing Receiver

eceiver to Hold Property: Receiver must not disburse funds to Judgment 
Creditor or sell property within 14 days after serving Judgment Debtor with 
the  Notice  of  Protected  Property  Rights,  the  Instructions  for  Protected

  R

approved by the Supreme Court and must state in any other order appointing a receiver: 

RULE 679b.    PERSONAL PROPERTY EXEMPTIONS IN POST-JUDGMENT 
PROCEEDINGS 
 

(a) 

Exemption Notice.   

Notice  Required.  If  a  post-judgment  turnover  order,  order  appointing  a  receiver 
under section 31.002 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code, writ of garnishment, 
writ of execution, or other post-judgment order results in the freeze or seizure of 
personal  property  of  an  individual  judgment  debtor,  the  receiver  or  judgment 
creditor  must  serve  the  judgment  debtor  with  the  Notice  of  Protected  Property 
Rights,  the  Instructions  for  Protected  Property  Claim  Form,  and  the  Protected 
Property Claim Form approved by the Supreme Court. Before service, the receiver 
or judgment creditor must fill in the case style and list the “Interested Persons to 
Notify” in the Protected Property Claim Form. 

Service Timing. The receiver or judgment creditor must serve the documents in (1) 
within three business days after the receiver or judgment creditor has notice that the 
judgment debtor’s property has been frozen or seized, whichever is first.     

Service Method. The documents in (1) must be served as provided in Rule 21a or 
Rule 501.4, as applicable. 

Repeat Service Not Required. Nothing in this rule requires the receiver or judgment 
creditor to serve the judgment debtor with the documents in (1) more than once. 

b) 

Suspension Period.     

General Rule.    A receiver or officer must not sell the judgment debtor’s personal 
property or distribute proceeds to the judgment creditor within 14 days after service 
of the documents in (a)(1), or within 17 days if service was by mail.

Hearing and Suspension Required. If the judgment debtor files a Protected Property 
Claim Form or another sworn document containing the same information: 

the court must hold a hearing on the exemption claim; and 

the receiver or officer must not sell the judgment debtor’s personal property 
or distribute its proceeds to the judgment creditor until the court determines 
the judgment debtor’s exemption claim. 

(a) 

b) 

  (

Hearing Notice.    Each party is entitled to reasonable notice of the hearing.   
 
Burden of Proof.    At the hearing, the judgment debtor must prove the exemption 
claim and the value of the personal property exempt.    The judgment debtor may 
satisfy  this  burden  through  a  sworn  statement  if  the  sworn  statement  is  not 
challenged. A “sworn” statement is one that is signed before a notary or made under 
penalty of perjury. A signed Protected Property Claim Form is a “sworn” statement. 

Time for Determining Exemption Claim. The court must determine the judgment 
debtor’s  exemption  claim  within  10  days  after  the  judgment  debtor  files  the 
exemption claim. The  court  may extend  the  time for determining the  exemption 
claim on good cause shown. 

Release of Property. If the court determines that the judgment debtor’s personal 
property is exempt, the court must order its release within three business days.

Notes and Comments 

(2) 

No Effect on Noticing Sale.    Nothing in this rule prohibits a receiver or officer from 
noticing the sale of the judgment debtor’s personal property during the suspension 
period if the sale date is after the suspension period’s expiration.     

c) 

Effect of Filing Protected Property Claim Form; Hearing; Exemption Determination. 

022 Comment: Rule 679b is a new rule implementing section 22.0042 of the Texas Government 
Code, which calls for expedited procedures that allow a judgment debtor to assert an exemption to 
the seizure of personal property by a judgment creditor or receiver appointed under section 31.002 
of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Rule 306a, various rules in Part V, Rule 663a, and Rule 
664a are also amended to implement section 22.0042 of the Texas Government Code.   
 

 

SECTION 5.    INJUNCTIONS 
 

RULE 680.    TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER 
 
No temporary restraining order shall be granted without notice to the adverse party unless it clearly

appears from specific facts shown by affidavit or by the verified complaint that immediate and 
irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the applicant before notice can be served and a 
hearing had thereon. Every temporary restraining order granted without notice shall be endorsed 
with  the  date  and  hour  of  issuance;  shall  be  filed  forthwith  in  the  clerk's  office  and  entered  of 
record; shall define the injury and state why it is irreparable and why the order was granted without 
notice; and shall expire by its terms within such time after signing, not to exceed fourteen days, as 
the court fixes, unless within the time so fixed the order, for good cause shown, is extended for a 
like period or unless the party against whom the order is directed consents that it may be extended 
for a longer period. The reasons for the extension shall be entered of record. No more than one 
extension  may  be  granted  unless  subsequent  extensions  are  unopposed.  In  case  a  temporary 
restraining order is granted without notice, the application for a temporary injunction shall be set 
down  for  hearing  at  the  earliest  possible  date  and  takes  precedence  of  all  matters  except  older 
matters  of  the  same  character;  and  when  the  application  comes  on  for  hearing  the  party  who 
obtained  the  temporary  restraining  order  shall  proceed  with  the  application  for  a  temporary 
injunction and, if he does not do so, the court shall dissolve the temporary restraining order. On 
two days' notice to the party who obtained the temporary restraining order without notice or on 
such shorter notice to that party as the court may prescribe, the adverse party may appear and move 
its dissolution or modification and in that event the court shall proceed to hear and determine such 
motion as expeditiously as the ends of justice require. 

very restraining order shall include an order setting a certain date for hearing on the temporary 

or permanent injunction sought. 
 

RULE 681.    TEMPORARY INJUNCTIONS: NOTICE 
 

No temporary injunction shall be issued without notice to the adverse party. 
 

RULE 682.    SWORN PETITION 
 
No writ of injunction shall be granted unless the applicant therefor shall present his petition to the 
judge verified by his affidavit and containing a plain and intelligible statement of the grounds for 
such relief. 
 

RULE 683.    FORM AND SCOPE OF INJUNCTION OR RESTRAINING ORDER 
 
Every order granting an injunction and every restraining order shall set forth the reasons for its 
issuance; shall be specific in terms; shall describe in reasonable detail and not by reference to the 
complaint or other document, the act or acts sought to be restrained; and is binding only upon the 
parties  to  the  action,  their  officers,  agents,  servants,  employees,  and  attorneys,  and  upon  those 
persons  in  active  concert  or  participation  with  them  who  receive  actual  notice  of  the  order  by 
personal service or otherwise. 

very order granting a temporary injunction shall include an order setting the cause for trial on the

merits  with  respect  to  the  ultimate  relief  sought.  The  appeal  of  a  temporary  injunction  shall 
constitute no cause for delay of the trial. 
 

RULE 684.    APPLICANT'S BOND 
 
In the order granting any temporary restraining order or temporary injunction, the court shall fix 
the  amount  of  security  to  be  given  by  the  applicant.  Before  the  issuance  of  the  temporary 
restraining order or temporary injunction the applicant shall execute and file with the clerk a bond 
to the adverse party, with two or more good and sufficient sureties, to be approved by the clerk, in 
the sum fixed by the judge, conditioned that the applicant will abide the decision which may be 
made in the cause, and that he will pay all sums of money and costs that may be adjudged against 
him if the restraining order or temporary injunction shall be dissolved in whole or in part. 

here the temporary restraining order or temporary injunction is against the State, a municipality, 
a State agency, or a subdivision of the State in its governmental capacity, and is such that the State, 
municipality,  State  agency,  or  subdivision  of  the  State  in  its  governmental  capacity,  has  no 
pecuniary interest in the suit and no monetary damages can be shown, the bond shall be allowed 
in the sum fixed by the judge, and the liability of the applicant shall be for its face amount if the 
restraining order or temporary injunction shall be dissolved in whole or in part. The discretion of 
the trial court in fixing the amount of the bond shall be subject to review. Provided that under 
equitable circumstances and for good cause shown by affidavit or otherwise the court rendering 
judgment on the bond may allow recovery for less than its full face amount, the action of the court 
to be subject to review. 
 

RULE 685.    FILING AND DOCKETING 
 
Upon  the  grant  of  a  temporary  restraining  order  or  an  order  fixing  a  time  for  hearing  upon  an 
application for a temporary injunction, the party to whom the same is granted shall file his petition 
therefor, together with the order of the judge, with the clerk of the proper court; and, if such orders 
do not pertain to a pending suit in said court, the cause shall be entered on the docket of the court 
in its regular order in the name of the party applying for the writ as plaintiff and of the opposite 
party as defendant. 
 

RULE 686.    CITATION 
 
Upon the filing of such petition and order not pertaining to a suit pending in the court, the clerk of 
such court shall issue a citation to the defendant as in other civil cases, which shall be served and 
returned in like manner as ordinary citations issued from said court; provided, however, that when 
a temporary restraining order is issued and is accompanied with a true copy of plaintiff's petition, 
it  shall  not  be  necessary  for  the  citation  in  the  original  suit  to  be  accompanied  with  a  copy  of 
plaintiff's  petition,  nor  contain  a  statement  of  the  nature  of  plaintiff's  demand,  but  it  shall  be 
sufficient for said citation to refer to plaintiff's claim as set forth in a true copy of plaintiff's petition 
which accompanies the temporary restraining order; and provided further that the court may have 

Page  286 

  W

 

a hearing upon an application for a temporary restraining order or temporary injunction at such 
time and upon such reasonable notice given in such manner as the court may direct. 
 

The writ of injunction shall be sufficient if it contains substantially the following requisites: 

RULE 687.    REQUISITES OF WRIT 
 

(a) 

Its style shall be, “The State of Texas.” 

(b) 

It shall be directed to the person or persons enjoined. 

(c) 

(d) 

(e) 

It must state the names of the parties to the proceedings, plaintiff and defendant, 
and the nature of the plaintiff's application, with the action of the judge thereon. 

It must command the person or persons to whom it is directed to desist and refrain 
from the commission or continuance of the act enjoined, or to obey and execute 
such order as the judge has seen proper to make. 

If it is a temporary restraining order, it shall state the day and time set for hearing, 
which shall not exceed fourteen days from the date of the court's order granting 
such temporary restraining order; but if it is a temporary injunction, issued after 
notice, it shall be made returnable at or before ten o'clock a.m. of the Monday next 
after the expiration of twenty days from the date of service thereof, as in the case 
of ordinary citations. 

(f) 

It shall be dated and signed by the clerk officially and attested with the seal of his 
office and the date of its issuance must be indorsed thereon. 

RULE 688.    CLERK TO ISSUE WRIT 
 
When the petition, order of the judge and bond have been filed, the clerk shall issue the temporary 
restraining order or temporary injunction, as the case may be, in conformity with the terms of the 
order, and deliver the same to the sheriff or any constable of the county of the residence of the 
person  enjoined,  or  to  the  applicant,  as  the  latter  shall  direct.  If  several  persons  are  enjoined, 
residing in different counties, the clerk shall issue such additional copies of the writ as shall be 
requested by the applicant.    The clerk must retain a copy of the temporary restraining order or 
temporary injunction in the court’s file. 
 

RULE 689.    SERVICE AND RETURN 
 
The officer receiving a writ of injunction shall indorse thereon the date of its receipt by him, and 
shall  forthwith  execute  the  same  by  delivering  to  the  party  enjoined  a  true  copy  thereof.    The 
officer must complete and file a return in accordance with Rule 107.

RULE 690.    THE ANSWER 
 
The defendant to an injunction proceeding may answer as in other civil actions; but no injunction 
shall  be  dissolved  before  final  hearing  because  of  the  denial  of  the  material  allegations  of  the 
plaintiff's petition, unless the answer denying the same is verified by the oath of the defendant. 
 

RULE 691.    BOND ON DISSOLUTION 
 
Upon the dissolution of an injunction restraining the collection of money, by an interlocutory order 
of the court or judge, made in term time or vacation, if the petition be continued over for trial, the 
court or judge shall require of the defendant in such injunction proceedings a bond, with two or 
more  good  and  sufficient  sureties,  to  be  approved  by  the  clerk  of  the  court,  payable  to  the 
complainant  in  double  the  amount  of  the  sum  enjoined,  and  conditioned  to  refund  to  the 
complainant the amount of money, interest and costs which may be collected of him in the suit or 
proceeding enjoined if such injunction is made perpetual on final hearing. If such injunction is so 
perpetuated, the court, on motion of the complainant, may enter judgment against the principal and 
sureties  in  such  bond  for  such  amount  as  may  be  shown  to  have  been  collected  from  such 
defendant. 
 

RULE 692.    DISOBEDIENCE 
 
Disobedience of an injunction may be punished by the court or judge, in term time or in vacation, 
as a contempt. In case of such disobedience, the complainant, his agent or attorney, may file in the 
court in which such injunction is pending or with the judge in vacation, his affidavit stating what 
person is guilty of such disobedience and describing the acts constituting the same; and thereupon 
the court or judge shall cause to be issued an attachment for such person, directed to the sheriff or 
any constable of any county, and requiring such officer to arrest the person therein named if found 
within his county and have him before the court or judge at the time and place named in such writ; 
or said court or judge may issue a show cause order, directing and requiring such person to appear 
on such date as may be designated and show cause why he should not be adjudged in contempt of 
court. On return of such attachment or show cause order, the judge shall proceed to hear proof; 
and if satisfied that such person has disobeyed the injunction, either directly or indirectly, may 
commit such person to jail without bail until he purges himself of such contempt, in such manner 
and form as the court or judge may direct. 
 

RULE 693.    PRINCIPLES OF EQUITY APPLICABLE 
 
The  principles,  practice  and  procedure  governing  courts  of  equity  shall  govern  proceedings  in 
injunctions when the same are not in conflict with these rules or the provisions of the statutes. 
 

Page  288 

RULE 693a.    BOND IN DIVORCE CASE 
 
In a divorce case the court in its discretion may dispense with the necessity of a bond in connection 
with an ancillary injunction in behalf of one spouse against the other. 

RULE 694.    NO MANDAMUS WITHOUT NOTICE 
 
No  mandamus  shall  be  granted  by  the  district  or  county  court  on  ex  parte  hearing,  and  any 
peremptory mandamus granted without notice shall be abated on motion. 

SECTION 6.    MANDAMUS 
 

SECTION 7.    RECEIVERS 
 

RULE 695.    NO RECEIVER OF IMMOVABLE PROPERTY APPOINTED WITHOUT 
NOTICE
 
Except where otherwise provided by statute, no receiver shall be appointed without notice to take 
charge  of  property  which  is  fixed  and  immovable.  When  an  application  for  appointment  of  a 
receiver to take possession of property of this type is filed, the judge or court shall set the same 
down for hearing and notice of such hearing shall be given to the adverse party by serving notice 
thereof not  less  than three days prior to  such  hearing.  If  the  order finds  that  the defendant is a 
nonresident or that his whereabouts is unknown, the notice may be served by affixing the same in 
a conspicuous manner and place upon the property or if that is impracticable it may be served in 
such other manner as the court or judge may require. 
 

 

RULE 695a.    BOND, AND BOND IN DIVORCE CASES 
 
No receiver shall be appointed with authority to take charge of property until the party applying 
therefor has filed with the clerk of the court a good and sufficient bond, to be approved by such 
clerk, payable to the defendant in the amount fixed by the court, conditioned for the payment of 
all damages and costs in such suit, in case it should be decided that such receiver was wrongfully 
appointed  to  take  charge  of  such  property.  The  amount  of  such  bond  shall  be  fixed  at  a  sum 
sufficient to cover all such probable damages and costs. In a divorce case the court or judge, as a 
matter of discretion, may dispense with the necessity of a bond. 

RULE 696.    APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF SEQUESTRATION AND ORDER 
 

SECTION 8.    SEQUESTRATION 
 

Page  289 

   

   

   

 

Either at the commencement of a suit or at any time during its progress the plaintiff may file an 
application  for  a  writ  of  sequestration.  The  application  shall  be  supported  by  affidavits  of  the 
plaintiff,  his  agent,  his  attorney,  or  other  persons  having  knowledge  of  relevant  facts.  The 
application shall comply with all statutory requirements and shall state the grounds for issuing the 
writ, including the description of the property to be sequestered with such certainty that it may be 
identified and distinguished from property of a like kind, giving the value of each article of the 
property and the county in which it is located, and the specific facts relied upon by the plaintiff to 
warrant the required findings by the court. The writ shall not be quashed because two or more 
grounds are stated conjunctively or disjunctively. The application and any affidavits shall be made 
on personal knowledge and shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence; provided 
that  facts  may  be  stated  based  upon  information  and  belief  if  the  grounds  of  such  belief  are 
specifically stated. 

o writ shall issue except upon written order of the court after a hearing, which may be ex parte. 
The court, in its order granting the application, shall make specific findings of facts to support the 
statutory  grounds  found  to  exist,  and  shall  describe  the  property  to  be  sequestered  with  such 
certainty that it may be identified and distinguished from property of a like kind, giving the value 
of each article of the property and the county in which it is located. Such order shall further specify 
the amount of bond required of plaintiff which shall be in an amount which, in the opinion of the 
court, shall adequately compensate defendant in the event plaintiff fails to prosecute his suit to 
effect and pay all damages and costs as shall be adjudged against him for wrongfully suing out the 
writ  of  sequestration  including  the  elements  of  damages  stated  in  Sections  62.044  and  62.045, 
Civil Practice and Remedies Code.    The court shall further find in its order the amount of bond 
required  of  defendant  to  replevy,  which  shall  be  in  an  amount  equivalent  to  the  value  of  the 
property  sequestered  or  to  the  amount  of  plaintiff's  claim  and  one  year's  accrual  of  interest  if 
allowed by law on the claim, whichever is the lesser amount, and the estimated costs of court. The 
order may direct  the  issuance of several writs  at  the  same time,  or  in succession,  to be sent to 
different counties. 
 

RULE 697.    PETITION 
 
If the suit be in the district or county court, no writ of sequestration shall issue, unless a petition 
shall have been first filed therein, as in other suits in said courts. 
 

RULE 698.    BOND FOR SEQUESTRATION 
 
No  writ  of  sequestration  shall  issue  until  the  party  applying  therefor  has  filed  with  the  officer 
authorized to issue such writ a bond payable to the defendant in the amount fixed by the court's 
order,  with  sufficient  surety  or  sureties  as  provided  by  statute  to  be  approved  by  such  officer, 
conditioned that the plaintiff will prosecute his suit to effect and pay to the extent of the penal 
amount of the bond all damages and costs as may be adjudged against him for wrongfully suing 
out  such  writ  of  sequestration,  and  plaintiff  may  further  condition  the  bond  pursuant  to  the 
provisions of Rule 708, in which case he shall not be required to give additional bond to replevy 
unless so ordered by the court. 
 

Page  290

After notice to the opposite party, either before or after the issuance of the writ, the defendant or 
plaintiff  may  file  a  motion  to  increase  or  reduce  the  amount  of  such  bond,  or  to  question  the 
sufficiency of the sureties thereon, in the court in which such suit is pending. Upon hearing, the 
court shall enter its order with respect to such bond and sufficiency of the sureties as justice may 
require. 
 

RULE 699.    REQUISITES OF WRIT 
 
The writ of sequestration shall be directed “To the Sheriff or any Constable within the State of 
Texas”  (not  naming  a  specific  county)  and  shall  command  him  to  take  into  his  possession  the 
property, describing the same as it is described in the application or affidavits, if to be found in his 
county, and to keep the same subject to further orders of the court, unless the same is replevied. 
There shall be prominently displayed on the face of the writ, in ten-point type and in a manner 
calculated to advise a reasonably attentive person of its contents, the following: 

YOU  HAVE  A  RIGHT  TO  REGAIN  POSSESSION  OF  THE  PROPERTY  BY  FILING  A 
REPLEVY  BOND.  YOU  HAVE  A  RIGHT  TO  SEEK  TO  REGAIN  POSSESSION  OF  THE 
PROPERTY BY FILING WITH THE COURT A MOTION TO DISSOLVE THIS WRIT.” 
 

RULE 700.    AMENDMENT 
 
Clerical errors in the affidavit, bond, or writ of sequestration or the officer's return thereof may 
upon application in writing to the judge of the court in which the suit is filed and after notice to 
the opponent, be amended in such manner and on such terms as the judge shall authorize by an 
order entered in the minutes of the court, provided the amendment does not change or add to the 
grounds of such sequestration as stated in the affidavit, and provided such amendment appears to 
the judge to be in furtherance of justice. 
 

RULE 700a.    SERVICE OF WRIT ON DEFENDANT 
 
The defendant shall be served in any manner provided for service of citation or as provided in Rule 
21a, with a copy of the writ of sequestration, the application, accompanying affidavits, and orders 
of the court as soon as practicable following the levy of the writ. There shall also be prominently 
displayed on the face of the copy of the writ served on defendant, in ten-point type and in a manner

RULE 701.    DEFENDANT MAY REPLEVY 
 
At any time before judgment, should the sequestered property not have been previously claimed, 
replevied, or sold, the defendant may replevy the same, or any part thereof, or the proceeds from 
the sale of the property if it has been sold under order of the court, by giving bond, with sufficient 
surety or sureties as provided by statute, to be approved by the officer who levied the writ, payable 
to plaintiff in the amount fixed by the court's order, conditioned as provided in Rule 702 or Rule 
703. 
On reasonable notice to the opposing party (which may be less than three days) either party shall 
have the right to prompt judicial review of the amount of bond required, denial of bond, sufficiency 
of sureties, and estimated value of the property, by the court which authorized issuance of the writ. 
The court's determination may be made upon the basis of affidavits, if uncontroverted, setting forth 
such facts as would be admissible in evidence; otherwise, the parties shall submit evidence. The 
court shall forthwith enter its order either approving or modifying the requirements of the officer 
or of the court's prior order, and such order of the court shall supersede and control with respect to 
such matters. 

RULE 702.    BOND FOR PERSONAL PROPERTY 
 
If the property to be replevied be personal property, the condition of the bond shall be that the 
defendant will not remove the same out of the county, or that he will not waste, ill-treat, injure, 
destroy, or dispose of the same, according to the plaintiff's affidavit, and that he will have such 
property, in the same condition as when it is replevied, together with the value of the fruits, hire 
or revenue thereof, forthcoming to abide the decision of the court, or that he will pay the value 
thereof, or the difference between its value at the time of replevy and the time of judgment and of 
the fruits, hire or revenue of the same in case he shall be condemned to do so. 
 

RULE 703.    BOND FOR REAL ESTATE 
 
If the property be real estate, the condition of such bond shall be that the defendant will not injure 
the property, and that he will pay the value of the rents of the same in case he shall be condemned 
so to do. 
 

RULE 704.    RETURN OF BOND AND ENTRY OF JUDGMENT 
 
The bond provided for in the three preceding rules shall be returned with the writ to the court from 
whence the writ issued. In case the suit is decided against the defendant, final judgment shall be 
rendered against all the obligors in such bond, jointly and severally, for the value of the property 
replevied  as  of  the  date  of  the  execution  of  the  replevy  bond,  and  the  value  of  the  fruits,  hire, 
revenue, or rent thereof, as the case may be. 
 

Page  292 

RULE 705.    DEFENDANT MAY RETURN SEQUESTERED PROPERTY 
 
Within  ten  days  after  final  judgment  for  personal  property  the  defendant  may  deliver  to  the 
plaintiff, or to the officer who levied the sequestration or to his successor in office the personal 
property in question, and such officer shall deliver same to plaintiff upon his demand therefor; or 
such defendant shall deliver such property to the officer demanding same under execution issued 
therefor upon a judgment for the title or possession of the same; and such officer shall receipt the 
defendant for such property; provided, however, that such delivery to the plaintiff or to such officer 
shall  be  without  prejudice  to  any  rights  of  the  plaintiff  under  the  replevy  bond  given  by  the 
defendant.  Where  a  mortgage  or  other  lien  of  any  kind  is  foreclosed  upon  personal  property 
sequestered and replevied, the defendant shall deliver such property to the officer calling for same 
under order of sale issued upon a judgment foreclosing such mortgage or other lien, either in the 
county of defendant's residence or in the county where sequestered, as demanded by such officer; 
provided, however, that such delivery by the defendant shall be without prejudice to any rights of 
the plaintiff under the replevy bond given by the defendant. 
 

RULE 706.    DISPOSITION OF THE PROPERTY BY OFFICER 
 
When the property is tendered back by the defendant to the officer who sequestered the same or to 
the officer calling for same under an order of sale, such officer shall receive said property and hold 
or dispose of the same as ordered by the court; provided, however, that such return to and receipt 
of same by the officer and any sale or disposition of said property by the officer under order or 
judgment of the court shall not affect or limit any rights of the plaintiff under the bond provided 
for in Rule 702. 
 

RULE 707.    EXECUTION 
 
If the property be not returned and received, as provided in the two preceding rules, execution shall 
issue upon said judgment for the amount due thereon, as in other cases. 
 

RULE 708.    PLAINTIFF MAY REPLEVY 
 
When the defendant fails to replevy the property within ten days after the levy of the writ and 
service  of  notice  on  defendant,  the  officer  having  the  property  in  possession  shall  at  any  time 
thereafter and before final judgment, deliver the same to the plaintiff upon his giving bond payable 
to defendant in a sum of money not less than the amount fixed by the court's order, with sufficient 
surety  or  sureties  as  provided  by  statute  to  be  approved  by  such  officer.  If  the  property  to  be 
replevied be personal property, the condition of the bond shall be that he will have such property, 
in the same condition as when it is replevied, together with the value of the fruits, hire or revenue 
thereof, forthcoming to abide the decision of the court, or that he will pay the value thereof, or the 
difference between its value at the time of replevy and the time of judgment (regardless of the 
cause of such difference in value, and of the fruits, hire or revenue of the same in case he shall be 
condemned to do so). If the property be real estate, the condition of such bond shall be that the 
plaintiff will not injure the property, and that he will pay the value of the rents of the same in case 

 

Page  293 

n reasonable notice to the opposing party (which may be less than three days) either party shall 
have the right to prompt judicial review of the amount of bond required, denial of bond, sufficiency 
of sureties, and estimated value of the property, by the court which authorized issuance of the writ. 
The court's determination may be made upon the basis of affidavits, if uncontroverted, setting forth 
such facts as would be admissible in evidence; otherwise, the parties shall submit evidence. The 
court shall forthwith enter its order either approving or modifying the requirements of the officer 
or of the court's prior order, and such order of the court shall supersede and control with respect to 
such matters. 
 

RULE 709.    WHEN BOND FORFEITED 
 
The bond provided for in the preceding rule shall be returned by the officer to the court issuing the 
writ immediately after he has approved same, and in case the suit is decided against the plaintiff, 
final judgment shall be entered against all the obligors in such bond, jointly and severally for the 
value of the property replevied as of the date of the execution of the replevy bond, and the value 
of the fruits, hire, revenue or rent thereof as the case may be. The same rules which govern the 
discharge or enforcement of a judgment against the obligors in the defendant's replevy bond shall 
be applicable to and govern in case of a judgment against the obligors in the plaintiff's replevy 
bond.   
 

RULE 710.    SALE OF PERISHABLE GOODS 
 
If after the expiration of ten days from the levy of a writ of sequestration the defendant has failed 
to replevy the same, if the plaintiff or defendant shall make affidavit in writing that the property 
levied upon, or any portion thereof, is likely to be wasted or destroyed or greatly depreciated in 
value by keeping, and if the officer having possession of such property shall certify to the truth of 
such affidavit, it shall be the duty of the judge or justice of the peace to whose court the writ is 
returnable, upon the presentation of such affidavit and certificate, either in term time or vacation, 
to order the sale of said property or so much thereof as is likely to be so wasted, destroyed or 
depreciated in value by keeping, but either party may replevy the property at any time before such 
sale. 
 

RULE 711.    ORDER OF SALE FOR 
 
The  judge  or  justice  granting  the  order  provided  for  in  the  preceding  rule  shall  issue  an  order 
directed to the officer having such property in possession, commending such officer to sell such 
property in the same manner as under execution. 
 

RULE 712.    RETURN OF ORDER 
 
The officer making such sale shall, within five days thereafter, return the order of sale to the court 

he shall be condemned to do so.

from whence the same issued, with his proceedings thereon, and shall, at the time of making such 
return, pay over to the clerk or justice of the peace the proceeds of such sale. 
 

RULE 712a.    DISSOLUTION OR MODIFICATION OF WRIT OF SEQUESTRATION 
 
A defendant whose property has been sequestered or any intervening party who claims an interest 
in such property, may by sworn written motion, seek to vacate, dissolve, or modify the writ and 
the order directing its issuance, for any grounds or cause, extrinsic or intrinsic, including a motion 
to reduce the amount of property sequestered when the total amount described and authorized by 
such  order  exceeds  the  amount  necessary  to  secure  the  plaintiff's  claim,  one  year's  interest  if 
allowed by law on the claim, and costs. Such motion shall admit or deny each finding of the order 
directing the issuance of the writ except where the movant is unable to admit or deny the finding, 
in which case movant shall set forth the reasons why he cannot admit or deny. Unless the parties 
agree to an extension of time, the motion shall be heard promptly, after reasonable notice to the 
plaintiff (which may be less than three days), and the issue shall be determined not later than ten 
days after the motion is filed. The filing of the motion shall stay any further proceedings under the 
writ, except for any orders concerning the care, preservation, or sale of any perishable property, 
until  a  hearing  is  had,  and  the  issue  is  determined.  The  writ  shall  be  dissolved  unless,  at  such 
hearing, the plaintiff shall prove the grounds relied upon for its issuance, but the court may modify 
its  previous  order  granting  the  writ  and  the  writ  issued  pursuant  thereto.  The  movant  shall, 
however, have the burden to prove that the reasonable value of the property sequestered exceeds 
the amount necessary to secure the debt, interest for one year, and probable costs. 

he court's determination may be made upon the basis of affidavits, if uncontroverted, setting forth 
such facts as would be admissible in evidence; otherwise, the parties shall submit evidence. The 
court may make all such orders, including orders concerning the care, preservation, or disposition 
of the property (or the proceeds therefrom if the same has been sold) as justice may require. If the 
movant has given a replevy bond, an order to vacate or dissolve the writ shall vacate the replevy 
bond  and  discharge  the  sureties  thereon,  and  if  the  court  modifies  its  order  or  the  writ  issued 
pursuant thereto, it shall make such further orders with respect to the bond as may be consistent 
with its modification. 
 

RULE 713.    SALE ON DEBT NOT DUE 
 
If the suit in which the sequestration issued be for a debt or demand not yet due, and the property 
sequestered be likely to be wasted, destroyed or greatly depreciated in value by keeping, the judge 
or justice of the peace shall, under the regulations hereinbefore provided, order the same to be sold, 
giving credit on such sale until such debt or demand shall become due. 
 

RULE 714.    PURCHASER'S BOND 
 
In  the  case  of  a  sale  as  provided  for  in  the  preceding  rule,  the  purchaser  of  the  property  shall 
execute his bond, with two or more good and sufficient sureties, to be approved by the officer 
making  the  sale,  and  payable  to  such  officer,  in  a  sum  not  less  than  double  the  amount  of  the 

Page  295 

  T

 

purchase money, conditioned that such purchaser shall pay such purchase money at the expiration 
of the time given. 
 

RULE 715.    RETURN OF BOND 
 
The bond provided for in the preceding rule shall be returned by the officer taking the same to the 
clerk or justice of the peace from whose court the order of sale issued, with such order, and shall 
be filed among the papers in the cause. 
 

RULE 716.    RECOVERY ON BOND 
 
In case the purchaser does not pay the purchase money at the expiration of the time given, judgment 
shall be rendered against all the obligors in such bond for the amount of such purchase money, 
interest thereon and all costs incurred in the enforcement and collection of the same; and execution 
shall issue thereon in the name of the plaintiff in the suit, as in other cases, and the money when 
collected shall be paid to the clerk or justice of the peace to abide the final decision of the cause.

claimant who is not a party to such writ, such claimant may make application that such claim is 
made in good faith, and file such application with the court in which such suit is pending. Such 
application may be supported by affidavits of the claimant, his agent, his attorney, or other persons 
having knowledge of relevant facts. The application shall comply with all statutory requirements 
and shall state the grounds for such claim and the specific facts relied upon by the claimant to 
warrant the required findings by the court.

disjunctively. The application and any affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge and shall 
set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence; provided that facts may be stated based 
upon information and belief if the grounds of such belief are specifically stated. 

o property shall be delivered to the claimant except on written order of the court after a hearing

Page  296 

   

 

  T

written motion, seek to obtain possession of such property. Such motion shall admit or deny each 
finding of the order directing the issuance of the writ except where the claimant is unable to admit 
or deny the finding, in which case claimant shall set forth the reasons why he cannot admit or deny. 
Such  motion  shall  also  contain  the  reasons  why  the  claimant  has  superior  right  or  title  to  the 
property claimed as against the plaintiff in the writ. Unless the parties agree to an extension of 
time, the motion shall be heard promptly, after reasonable notice to the plaintiff (which may be 
less than three days), and the issue shall be determined not later than 10 days after the motion is 
filed. The filing of the motion shall stay any further proceedings under the writ, except for any 
orders concerning the care, preservation, or sale of any perishable property, until a hearing is had, 
and the issue is determined. The claimant shall have the burden to show superior right or title to 
the property claimed as against the plaintiff and defendant in the writ. 

he court's determination may be made upon the basis of affidavits, if uncontroverted, setting forth 
such facts as would be admissible in evidence, but additional evidence, if tendered by either party 
shall be received and considered. The court may make all such orders, including orders concerning 
the care, preservation, or disposition of the property, or the proceeds therefrom if the same has 
been sold, as justice may require, and if the court modifies its order or the writ issued pursuant 
thereto, it shall make such further orders with respect to the bond as may be consistent with its 
modification.

who made the levy, a bond in an amount fixed by the court's order equal to double the value of the

provided by statute to be approved by such officer, conditioned that the claimant will return the 
same to the officer making the levy, or his successor, in as good condition as he received it, and 
shall also pay the reasonable value of the use, hire, increase and fruits thereof from the date of said 
bond, or, in case he fails so to return said property and pay for the use of the same, that he shall 
pay the plaintiff the value of said property, with legal interest thereon from the date of the bond, 
and shall also pay all damages and costs that may be awarded against him for wrongfully suing 
out such claim. 

he plaintiff or claimant may file a motion to increase or reduce the amount of such bond, or to 
question the sufficiency of the sureties thereon, in the court in which such suit is pending. Upon 
hearing, the court shall enter its order with respect to such bond and sufficiency of the sureties. 
 

RULE 720.    RETURN OF BOND 
 
Whenever any person shall claim property and shall duly make the application and give the bond, 
if the writ under which the levy was made was issued by a justice of the peace or a court of the 
county where such levy was made, the officer receiving such application and bond shall endorse 
on the writ that such claim has been made and application and bond given, and by whom; and shall 
also endorse on such bond the value of the property as assessed by himself, and shall forthwith 
return such bond with a copy of the writ to the proper court having jurisdiction to try such claim.

such bond shall endorse on such bond the value of the property as assessed by himself, and shall 
forthwith return such bond with a copy of the writ, to the property court having jurisdiction to try

parties to make brief statements of the nature of their claims thereto.

claimant. 
 

RULE 729.    COPY OF WRIT EVIDENCE

that in which the writ issued under which the levy was made, the copy of the writ herein required 
to be returned by the officer making the levy shall be received in evidence in like manner as the 
original could be. 
 

RULE 730.    FAILURE TO ESTABLISH TITLE

of the plaintiff or defendant in the writ, or of the several plaintiffs or defendants, if more than one, 
and shall fix the amount of the claim of each. 
 

RULE 731.    EXECUTION SHALL ISSUE

damages by the claimant against the officer who levied upon said property.

SECTION I.    PROCEDURES RELATED TO FORECLOSURES OF CERTAIN LIENS 

RULE 735.    FORECLOSURES REQUIRING A COURT ORDER 

35.1.  Liens Affected 

ule 736 provides the procedure for obtaining a court order, when required, to allow foreclosure 
of a lien containing a power of sale in the security instrument, dedicatory instrument, or declaration 
creating the lien, including a lien securing any of the following: 

a  home  equity  loan,  reverse  mortgage,  or  home  equity  line  of  credit  under  article XVI, 
sections 50(a)(6), 50(k), and 50(t) of the Texas Constitution; 

a tax lien transfer or property tax loan under sections 32.06 and 32.065 of the Tax Code; 
or 

c) 

a property owners’ association assessment under section 209.0092 of the Property Code.

proceed with foreclosure under applicable law and the terms of the loan agreement, contract, or 
lien sought to be foreclosed.

36.9.  Effect of the Order

order is signed, the proceeding under this  rule must be abated  so long as the  automatic stay is 
effective. 

36.11. Automatic Stay and Dismissal if Independent Suit Filed

original proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction that puts in issue any matter related 
to the origination, servicing, or enforcement of the loan agreement, contract, or lien sought 
to be foreclosed prior to 5:00 p.m. on the Monday before the scheduled foreclosure sale.

attorney and the foreclosure trustee or substitute trustee by any reasonable means necessary 
to stop the scheduled foreclosure sale.

dismiss or vacate with the clerk of the court in which the application was filed giving notice 
that respondent has filed an original proceeding contesting the right to foreclose in a court 
of competent jurisdiction.    If no order has been signed, the court must dismiss a pending 
proceeding.    If an order has been signed, the court must vacate the Rule 736 order. 

d) 

If the automatic stay under this rule is in effect, any foreclosure sale of the property is void. 
Within 10 business days of notice that the foreclosure sale was void, the trustee or substitute 
trustee must return to the buyer of the foreclosed property the purchase price paid by the 
buyer. 

e) 

The court may enforce the Rule 736 process under chapters 9 and 10 of the Civil Practices 
and Remedies Code.

36.13. Promulgated Forms 

he Supreme Court of Texas may promulgate forms that conform to this rule. 

Comment to 2011 change 

Rules  735  and  736  have  been  rewritten  and  expanded  to  cover  property  owners= 
associations’  assessment  liens,  in  accordance  with  amendments  to  chapter  209  of  the  Property 
Code.    Rule 735.1 makes the expedited procedures of Rule 736 available only when the lienholder 
has a power of sale but a court order is nevertheless required by law to foreclose the lien.    Rule 
735.2 makes clear that Rule 736 is procedural only and does not affect other contractual or legal 
rights or duties.    Any lien which can be foreclosed under Rule 736 may also be foreclosed in an 
action for judicial foreclosure, as Rule 735.3 states, but no lienholder is required to obtain both a 
Rule 736 order and a judgment for judicial foreclosure.    The requirement of conspicuousness in 
Rule 736.1(d)(5) has reference to section 1.201(b)(10) of the Business and Commerce Code.

reference shall be deemed to be to the pertinent part or parts of these rules. 
 

RULE 819.    PROCEDURE CONTINUED 
 
All  procedure  prescribed  by  statutes  of  the  State  of  Texas  not  specifically  listed  in  the

RULE 821.    PRIOR COURT RULES REPEALED

prior  Court  Rules  are  hereby  repealed;  provided,  however,  any  rules  or  procedure  heretofore 
adopted  by a  particular county  or  district court  or  by  any  Court  of  Appeals  which were  not  of 
general application but were solely to regulate procedure in the particular court promulgating such 
rules are to remain in force and effect insofar as they are not inconsistent with these rules.
