════════════════════════════════════════════════════ 
ORDER AMENDING ARTICLES IV AND XIII OF THE STATE BAR RULES AND  
RULE 8.04 OF THE TEXAS DISCIPLINARY RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT  
════════════════════════════════════════════════════ 

RDERED that: 

Article  IV  of  the  State  Bar  Rules  is  amended  to  (a)  replace  references  to  “minority 
directors” with references to “at-large directors” in accordance with recent amendments to 
Sections 81.002 and 81.020 of the Government Code;1 and (b) update the qualifications for 
officers and directors of the State Bar. Under the amended rules, a lawyer may be qualified 
to serve as director or officer despite a prior administrative suspension, and a lawyer may 
be qualified to serve as director despite a prior disciplinary suspension if the condition in 
§ 5(A)(2)(c) is met. The amendments to §§ 1, 3, 8, and 10 are redlined. Because § 5 has 
been rewritten, only a clean copy of that Section, as amended, is included in this order.  

The amendments to Article IV are effective immediately. 

Article  XIII  of  the  State  Bar  Rules  and  Rule  8.04  of  the  Texas  Disciplinary  Rules  of 
Professional Conduct are amended to comply with Section 81.053(a) of the Government 
Code.2  The  amendments  to  Article  XIII  establish  the  New  Opportunities  Volunteer 
Attorney Program. The amended Article is shown in clean form. The amendment to Rule 
8.04 of the TDRPC is redlined. Clean-up revisions have also been made to the comment to 
Rule 8.04. 

The amendments to Article XIII and Rule 8.04 will take effect on May 1, 2018, after a 
to

of March.

Section 8.  Director Vacancies and How Filled  

.   Death of a board member, judgment of incompetency, a board member’s resignation 
or any failure to qualify shall create a vacancy. In case of a vacancy as to an elected 
director, the president, shall appoint a member whose principal place of practice is 
within the district within which the vacancy has occurred. Vacancies in ex officio 
directorships shall be filled by the person who succeeds to the office in the State Bar 
or in the Texas Young Lawyers Association to which such directorship is incident, 
except that the directorship incident to the office of immediate past president of the 
State Bar or Texas Young Lawyers Association or immediate past chairperson of 
the board of the State Bar shall be filled by the most recent holder of such offices 
respectively  who  is  willing  to  serve.  Vacancies  in  public  and  minority  at-large 
directorships shall be filled in the same manner and by the same authority designated 
by statute to fill such positions.  

Persons filling such vacancies shall meet the same requirements and shall qualify in 
the same manner as those assuming the office of director for the full term.  

The board may adopt appropriate procedures for the purpose of equalizing the size 
of  the  classes  of  the  board  of  directors.  Once  such  equalization  is  accomplished, 
then  those  appointed  to  fill  a  vacancy  shall  serve  the  balance  of  the  term  of  the 
particular position vacated.   

The board of directors may remove a director from the board at any regular meeting

conspiracy, or solicitation of another to commit any of the foregoing crimes. 

lean Version of the Comment to Rule 8.04, as Amended 

Comment: 
1.  

There are four principal sources of professional obligations for lawyers in Texas: 
these  rules,  the  State  Bar  Act,  the  State  Bar  Rules,  and  the  Texas  Rules  of 
Disciplinary  Procedure  (TRDP).  All  lawyers  are  presumed  to  know  the 
requirements of these sources. Rule 8.04(a)(1) provides a partial list of conduct that 
will subject a lawyer to discipline. 

.   Many kinds of illegal conduct reflect adversely on fitness to practice law. However, 
some  kinds  of  offenses  carry  no  such  implication.  Traditionally  in  this  state,  the 
distinction  has  been  drawn  in  terms  of  those  crimes  subjecting  a  lawyer  to 
compulsory discipline, criminal acts relevant to a lawyer’s fitness for the practice 
of law, and other offenses. Crimes subject to compulsory discipline are governed by 
TRDP,  Part  VIII.  In  addition,  although  a  lawyer  is  personally  answerable  to  the 
entire criminal law, a lawyer should be professionally answerable only for criminal 
acts that indicate a lack of those characteristics relevant to the lawyer’s fitness for 
the  practice  of  law.  A  pattern  of  repeated  criminal  acts,  even  ones  of  minor 
significance  when  considered  separately,  can  indicate  indifference  to  legal 
obligations  that  legitimately  could  call  a  lawyer’s  overall  fitness  to  practice  into 
question. See TRDP, Part VIII; Rule 8.04(a)(2). 

A lawyer  may refuse to comply  with an  obligation imposed by  law upon a good 
faith belief, openly asserted, that no valid obligation exists. The provisions of Rule 
1.02(c)  concerning  a  good  faith  challenge  to  the  validity,  scope,  meaning  or 
application of the law apply to challenges to legal regulation of the practice of law. 

Lawyers holding public office assume legal responsibilities going beyond those of 
other citizens. A lawyer’s abuse of public office can suggest an inability to fulfill 
the professional role of attorney. The same is true of abuse of positions of private 
trust.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
