Letter from Leadership

Justice Debra H. Lehrmann

Justice Rebeca Aizpuru Huddle

2022 ANNUAL REPORTIt has been over a year since we were appointed as Chair and Deputy Chair of the Supreme Court of Texas Permanent Judicial Commission for Children, Youth, and Families (Children’s Commission). Partnering with many experts from around the state, providing a forum for critical conversations about challenging topics, and producing resources for judges, attorneys, and stakeholders has reinforced the value the Children’s Commission brings to the judiciary and the child welfare system writ large.  This was an exciting and productive year for the Children’s Commission and this report includes highlights from Fiscal Year 2022 (October 2021 to September 2022). Many meetings, trainings, and events returned to an in-person format as relationships, both new and enduring, were strengthened and benefited from sharing ideas and innovations. For example, the Children’s Commission and Judicial Commission on Mental Health partnered to host the first joint Round Table meeting with an emphasis on children experiencing a mental health crisis. Several child-serving systems overlap in the area of children’s mental health and this partnership between the two commissions provided a unique opportunity to gather state and local leaders, including those with lived experience with these systems, to chart a path forward together.  The Children’s Commission produced multiple reports and resources this year, including several emanating from the 87th Legislature on issues such as Residential Treatment Centers and the Department’s use of a Forensic Assessment Center Network to assist with medical consultation on cases of suspected child abuse and neglect. The Tool Kit for Attorneys Representing Parents and Children was updated and disseminated. A Coloring Book to assist younger children with understanding the attorney-client relationship was also created and distributed this year.  These are just a few key accomplishments from Fiscal Year 2022. Each year brings a new dimension to the breadth and depth of the Children’s Commission work. We look forward to a continued emphasis on strengthening the judicial and legal response in child welfare cases so that children and families in Texas can experience positive outcomes.  6

Letter from the Executive Director

Jamie Bernstein

2022 ANNUAL REPORTThe theme of this year’s annual report is strength through transitions. Fiscal Year 2022 was a year filled with many transitions within the child welfare system. Many aspects of the system transitioned from virtual or hybrid operations to in person. Numerous changes from the 87th Legislative Session were implemented, and judges, attorneys, CASAs, caseworkers, families, and stakeholders transitioned to new statutory frameworks. Several regions in Texas continued the transition into Community Based Care. Each of these changes brings opportunities for growth and improvement.  Perhaps most critical for the Children’s Commission is a maintained focus on the transitions facing children and families who experience the child welfare system. Whether the transition is from foster care to reunification or other permanency outcome, moving from one school to another seamlessly, or aging out of care and transitioning to adulthood, each of these life experiences often require both strength and support. Judges and attorneys can implement best practices to encourage safety, permanency, and well-being for children and families experiencing such transitions in the child welfare system.    The Children’s Commission remains steadfast in our mission to strengthen courts serving children, youth, and families as they navigate these transitions. We hope that you will enjoy reviewing this report and learning about our projects, resources, and collaborative efforts. We are grateful for the support of the Supreme Court of Texas and for our invaluable partnerships with experts and leaders throughout our State.7

Visiting Judge Support

The  Texas  Family  Code  authorizes  presiding  judges  of  the  administrative 
judicial  regions  to  appoint  associate  judges  with  expertise  related  to  child 
abuse and neglect to preside in child welfare cases. 

In  FY2022,  over  180  child  welfare  cases  were  heard  by  visiting  associate 
judges contracted with OCA to sit by assignment when active Child Protection 
Court (CPC) associate judges were absent from the bench for reasons that 
are  enumerated  in  statute.  Without  funding  for  visiting  associate  judges  to 
provide docket coverage, these cases would have been reset until the sitting 
associate judge was available, resulting in case processing delay. The grant 
funds  allowed  for  coverage  by  judges  who  have  extensive  knowledge  of 
CPS  proceedings  and  statutory  timelines  and  a  clear  understanding  of  the 
complexity of such cases, thus promoting timely permanency.

Round Table Discussion 
on Children’s Mental Health

On  June  24,  2022,  the  Children’s  Commission  and  the 
Texas  Judicial  Commission  on  Mental  Health  (JCMH) 
held the first joint commission Round Table Discussion on 
Current Issues in Children’s Mental Health. Leadership from 
both commissions participated in the discussion, including 
Supreme  Court  of  Texas  Justice  Debra  Lehrmann,  Chair 
of  the  Children’s  Commission;  Texas  Court  of  Criminal 
Appeals  Judge  Barbara  Hervey,  Co-Chair  of  the  Judicial 
Commission  on  Mental  Health;  and  Supreme  Court 
of  Texas  Justice  Rebeca  Huddle,  Deputy  Chair  of  the 
Children’s Commission and Deputy Liaison to the Judicial 
Commission  on  Mental  Health.  Invited  guests  included 
young  adults  and  parents  with  lived  experience;  judges 
hearing  both  juvenile  and  child  welfare  cases;  leaders 
from  state  agencies  (DFPS,  Health  and  Human  Services 
Commission,  and  the  Texas  Juvenile  Justice  Department 
[TJJD]);  as  well  as  attorneys,  service  providers,  and 
advocates. 

The  Round  Table  discussion  centered  on  children 
experiencing  a  mental  health  crisis,  including  increased 
numbers  of  children  without  placement  in  foster  care 
and  commitments  to  TJJD  due  to  unmet  mental  health 
needs.  Participants  discussed  gaps 
for  systems-
involved  children  and  youth,  current  initiatives  to  fill 
those  gaps,  and  recommendations  for  short-  and  long-
term  solutions. A  Round  Table  Report  on  Current  Issues 
in  Children’s  Mental  Health  was  released  on  September 
30,  2022  outlining  the  discussion  held  during  the  Round 
Table  and  recommendations  developed  by  participants. 
The  recommendations  generated  fall  into  the  following 
categories:  Expanding  Awareness,  Training  and  Tools, 
Systems Collaboration, and Access to Services.

Statewide Collaborative On Trauma-Informed Care

In FY2022, the Children’s Commission partnered with the Center to support implementation of trauma-
informed court practices at several project court sites, referred to as the Trauma-Informed Court Project. 
The Trauma-Informed Court Project worked throughout the year with six court sites; these were led by 
Judge Carol Chaney (Waller County Court at Law); Judge Linda Dunson (309th Family District Court); 
Judge Angela  Graves-Harrington  (246th  Family  District  Court);  Judge  Rhonda  Hunter  (303rd  Family 
District  Court);  Judge  Andrea  James  (2nd  Region  Child  Protection  Court  No.  2);  and  Judge  Cheryl 
Vaughan (Child Protection Court Eighth Region North). Each project site judge selected a core team 
to  support  the  court’s  project.  In  collaboration  with  the  project  support  team,  each  team  selected  a 
specific project to implement trauma-informed practices such as implementing phased services plans, 
building  collaboration  and  shared  learning  through  community  trainings,  and  addressing  courthouse 
environment by creating improved guidance for parents and children about the court and child welfare 
case processes. 

An initial cohort convening was held in Spring 2022 providing an opportunity for team members to receive 
training on trauma and trauma-informed concepts and begin the team planning process. The project 
planning team hosted a second cohort convening on September 23, 2022. The convening provided the 
opportunity for each court team to share progress on their selected projects. The Trauma-Informed Court 
Project will continue for a second year to further support the court sites as they implement their projects, 
collect data, and expand a trauma-informed court approach to their court process and community.

Texas Center for Child and Family Studies

Trauma-informed Courts

This project was designed as a partnership between the Children’s Commission 
and the Center to support the implementation of trauma-informed and trauma-
responsive  practices  that  promote  child  and  family  felt  safety  within  the 
Texas court system. Ultimately, the goal of the project is to support improved 
permanency and well-being outcomes for children and families. Project goals 
included supporting development and implementation of customized trauma-
informed court projects, facilitating shared learning by convening the cohort of 
court teams, and documenting implementation successes and challenges to 
build a body of information that can be used to expand trauma-informed and 
trauma-responsive court practices across the state.

Normalcy

In  partnership  with  the  Children’s  Commission,  Texas  CASA  released  Normalcy  Matters: A  Guide  to 
Supporting Children & Youth in Texas Foster Care on February 2, 2022. The guide and companion video 
were developed to provide education about normalcy, including the importance of normalcy and how 
judges, attorneys, stakeholders, and others can support normalcy for children and youth who experience 
the Texas child welfare system. 

Texas Court Appointed Special Advocates
Videos on Roles in a Child Welfare Case

Texas CASA is developing a set of materials to explain the different legal roles 
in a child welfare case. These will include: the Judge, Attorney ad Litem, CASA/
GAL, Parent’s Attorney, and DFPS Attorney. These roles will be described in 
both written materials and videos in English and in Spanish. These materials 
were drafted in FY2022 and will be available in FY2023. 

Equity Workgroup

In FY2022, the Equity Workgroup, chaired by the Commission’s Equity Advisor Sheila Craig, adopted 
a mission statement to direct its work. In January 2022, a Texas team, including Sheila Craig, Judge 
Aurora  Martinez  Jones  of  the  126th  District  Court,  OCA  Specialty  and  Children’s  Courts  Program 
Manager Anissa Johnson, OCA Senior Data Analyst Jeff Cox, and Commission Staff Attorney Jocelyn 
Fowler,  was  accepted  into  the  CBCC’s  Race  Equity  Workshop  series.  The  Texas  team  attended  all 
meetings which provided overviews on reviewing disproportionality and disparity data and opportunities 
for state teams to share ideas. The Equity Workgroup partnered with the newly expanded DFPS Office 
Addressing  Disproportionality  and  Disparities  and  focused  on  strengthening  collaboration  among  all 
stakeholders. Additionally, during FY2022, Equity Workgroup members remained actively engaged in 
the Casey Family Programs Race Equity Collaborative. 

Judicial Workgroup on Capacity

In response to  the  growing  numbers of children without placement (often referred to as CWOP), the 
Commission initiated a Judicial Workgroup on Capacity. Beginning in June 2021, the workgroup meets 
on a regular basis to provide a forum for judges from jurisdictions throughout the state to brainstorm 
effective approaches to identifying placement options for children without placement. In the long term, 
this group may provide a forum to discuss how judges can appropriately participate in developing foster 
care capacity in their communities. Although the workgroup did not meet between July and August, bi-
monthly meetings resumed in September 2022.

Prevention and Early Intervention

Kinship Issues

On December 6, 2021, the Children’s Commission attended a Kinship Care Convening that was hosted 
by Casey Family Programs and included DFPS leadership and staff as well as the Texas Alliance of 
Child and Family Services. At the convening, experts from Florida provided an overview of how that state 
developed a successful kinship care program. As a direct outgrowth from the Convening, Commission 
staff participated in a Kinship Steering Committee as well as two related workgroups, Kin as First and 
Best Out of Home Placement and Supporting Kinship Placements.

2022 ANNUAL REPORTDuring FY2022, DFPS’ Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) division, OCA, and the Children’s Commission launched an Early Intervention Court Liaison pilot in Galveston, Bell, and Lubbock Counties. The Court Liaisons act as special assistants to the court, serve to identify and connect early childhood and family support programs to the local CPCs and community, and offer a judicial perspective within community stakeholder meetings.The Commission supported implementation of House Bill 3041 (87th Regular Legislative Session) which requires DFPS to provide family focused preservation services to children and families where children are at imminent risk of being removed from their home and placed in conservatorship due to a continuing danger. The Family Preservation Services pilots will operate under direct court supervision and DFPS is directed to utilize federal Title IV-E funds for services. The Commission participated in Steering Committee meetings with DFPS and convened judges in the pilot areas to discuss the legal framework and implementation. Commission staff participated in PEI’s Prevention Framework Workgroup which is comprised of statewide stakeholders with a goal of developing a prevention framework to guide communities throughout Texas.22

Foster Care and Education

During FY2022, the Children’s Commission, in partnership with DFPS, Texas Education Agency (TEA), 
and several other agencies and organizations, released a Top 10 Things to Know series to address the 
educational needs of students in foster care who are placed in RTCs. This series was created by subject 
matter experts in foster care and education. There were three lists in the series: one for providers, one 
for educators, and one for legal professionals – each developed to raise awareness and provide a basic 
introduction to the  educational  considerations for each intended audience. Each list included a high-
level quick reference sheet as well as a more detailed explanation with additional information.

Additionally, TEA, in collaboration with DFPS and the Children’s Commission, updated the Foster Care 
& Student Success Resource Guide. The 2022 version of the guide contained updated resources and 
materials and included new chapters on the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) and Trauma-Informed 
Education. This updated guide is a resource tool for use by educators, child welfare stakeholders, and 
the legal community. 

The Foster Care & Education Committee also continued developing projects for the workgroups in the 
following priority areas: caregiver supports; data and information sharing; and ESSA. 

Dual Status Task Force

Tribal/State Collaboration

2022 ANNUAL REPORTThe Commission remains committed to strengthening Tribal-State partnerships and collaborating with Tribal partners to educate about the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). Commission staff participate in the ICWA Constituency Group monthly calls organized by the Capacity Building Center for Courts (CBCC). Additionally, Commission staff meet regularly with the Tribal liaison from DFPS State Office and Tribal partners, including building connections with ICWA Tribal liaisons from Tribes based outside Texas.The Dual Status Task Force Final Report was released in December 2021 and captured recommendations that were formulated over an eighteen-month time period, beginning in July 2019. The report contains various recommendations for agency coordination, data, definitions, legal representation and advocacy, judicial practices, and training that highlight the unique needs of this population of youth. The Child Protection Court dual status pilot is underway in the Child Protection Court of the Rio Grande Valley West, the Child Protection Court of Taylor County, and the Child Protection Court of the Hill Country. Researchers at the University of Texas at San Antonio distributed a survey in April 2022 to the participating stakeholders to assess the impact of the dual status initiative in each jurisdiction. Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children Judicial Workgroup

Senate Bill 1575: Residential Treatment Centers and Qualified Residential 
Treatment Programs

Senate Bill 1578: Forensic Assessment Center Network

Over  15  years  ago,  DFPS  established  the  Forensic Assessment  Center  Network  (FACN)  to  allow  for 
specialized pediatricians to be available for consultation on cases of suspected child abuse and neglect. 
During  the  87th  Texas  Regular  Legislative  Session,  SB  1578  added  Texas  Family  Code  §  261.3017 
which required DFPS and the Children’s Commission to evaluate DFPS’ use of the network and develop 
joint recommendations for improvement. 

On April  4,  2022,  the  Children’s  Commission  offered  a  “Listening  Session”  for  parents  to  share  their 
experiences  and  concerns  about  DFPS’  use  of  the  FACN. The  purpose  of  the  Listening  Session  was 
to  create  a  parent-driven  discussion  to  elicit  suggestions  to  improve  the  communication  and  process 
between the FACN, DFPS, and families. On April 11, 2022, the Commission hosted a Round Table on the 
Use of the FACN moderated by Senior JIR Judge Rob Hofmann. The five-hour discussion attended by 
forty-five participants included representatives from DFPS, parent advocates, Child Abuse Pediatricians, 
other pediatric specialists, parents with experience with the FACN, judges, and attorneys who represent 
parents,  children,  or  DFPS.  The  Commission  worked  closely  with  DFPS  to  complete  a  Forensic 
Assessment Center Network Report outlining recommendations to the Legislature on September 1, 2022.

2022 ANNUAL REPORTThe Children’s Commission partnered with DFPS to develop a plan for implementation of Senate Bill (SB) 1575, including the creation of a workgroup to examine the oversight of and best practices related to residential treatment center (RTC) placements, including placements in qualified residential treatment programs (QRTPs). The workgroup charge was to consider topics and changes to current practices to ensure the appropriate use of and to improve the transition into and out of RTC placements, including:• statutorily required judicial review of RTC placements;• fiscal implications of additional judicial review for RTC placements;• methods for improving the state’s practices regarding the duration of RTC placements, including best practices for transition planning and involving family and other relevant participants in preparing the child for a subsequent placement;• proposed statutory changes regarding appropriate judicial findings, evidence required to be submitted by DFPS, and recommendations for information to be gathered from the child’s attorney or guardian ad litem; and• model court orders determined to be appropriate for the legal requirements for a particular placement.The Senate Bill 1575 Workgroup met for a total of four times over a twelve-month period. The workgroup decided to organize its work into two subgroups: RTC Best Practices and Legal. The subgroup met on a monthly basis beginning in November 2021. On September 30, 2022, the Children’s Commission submitted the Senate Bill 1575 Report to the Legislature.25

Office of Court Administration

Virtual Court Equipment Update

The Children’s Commission provided funding to update the technology used 
in the courtroom to conduct virtual/hybrid hearings for pilots in six CPCs. The 
six courts were selected by the Commission and OCA based on results of a 
survey of the CPCs about their current and anticipated use of virtual/hybrid 
hearings. While no two courtrooms are the same, the Program Manager at 
OCA worked with each court individually to determine the equipment needed. 
In  general,  this  equipment  included  a  motion  sensing  conference  camera, 
improved courtroom display, microphones, and speakers.

the  Helpline 

In  FY2022,  calls 
included 
questions about DFPS cases (closed and active) 
as  well  as  questions  about  child  safety  that  did 
not yet involve Child Protective Services (CPS). 
The Family Helpline discussed 101 different legal 
issues  with  callers  over  the  course  of  the  year. 
The  top  trending  issues  discussed  were  Child 
Protective Investigations, conservatorship, parent 
visitation,  neglect,  modifications,  Safety  Plans/
Parent Child Safety Placements, substance use 
and abuse, CPS closed case issues, hiring legal 
counsel,  child’s  best  interests,  reporting  abuse/
neglect, and domestic violence.

This year, the Family Helpline completed a total 
of  1,702  calls,  providing  legal  information  that 
affected  1,816  adults  and  2,841  children.  Of 
those calls, 1,415 were from first-time callers, and 
287 were from repeat callers who had follow up 
questions. The calls originated from 146 different 
counties in Texas, as well as out of state callers 
with  a  question  about  Texas  law. Approximately 
55% of callers had an open CPS case; the largest 
case  type  was  Investigations,  making  up  50% 
of  open  CPS  cases,  followed  by  (in  descending 
order)  Temporary  Managing  Conservatorship, 
Family  Based  Safety  Services,  unknown  stage, 
PMC,  Court  Ordered  Services,  and  Alternative 
Response.  Approximately  27%  of  callers  had 
questions  about  a  closed  CPS  case,  and  17% 
of  callers  had  questions  about  preventing  child 
abuse or neglect.

Young Adult Leadership Council

With  FY2022  Commission  grant 
funding,  Texas  Network  of  Youth 
Services  onboarded  a  new  Statewide 
Young  Adult  Leadership  Council 
(YALC)  cohort  of  12  young  people. 
YALC members attended two trainings 
where they learned how to facilitate and 
plan  listening  session  activities.  They 
three  planning  sessions 
conducted 
where they contributed to the creation 
of listening session questions that were 
comprised of five themes to discuss the 
changes that can be made in the court 
system.  These  sessions  provided  the 
YALC  members  with  the  knowledge 
and confidence necessary to carry out 
the  Listening  Sessions  in  preparation 
for  the  Commission  Video  Project. 
Additionally,  YALC  members  provided 
feedback to the Commission’s Tool Kit 
Committee for Attorneys Representing 
Parents and Children in Child Welfare 
Cases to revamp sections of the tool kit 
to make them more youth-informed and 
specific to the needs of youth and young 
adults  in  the  foster  care  system.  This 
input  is  expected  to  have  measurable 
impacts on the youth in Texas who are 
in  care  and  the  attorneys  who  serve 
them. 

Through  this  grant,  YALC  members 
also had the opportunity to partner with 
several organizations through external 
speaking  engagements,  including  the 
University  of  Texas  School  of  Law 
Children’s  Rights  Clinic  and  the  State 
Bar  of  Texas  Child  Protection  Law 
Section.

2022 ANNUAL REPORTThe Mediation Workgroup participated in a discussion with the National Center for State Courts (NCSC) to help identify points of interest for data collection on mediation in the second phase of the NCSC’s study of virtual court practices.

hours of ethics. Two optional bonus pre-recorded lectures entitled “How to Create a CPS Trial Notebook” 
and “Basics for Jury Selection” qualified for up to the allotted annual 3.0 hours of self-study MCLE credit.

2022 ANNUAL REPORTOn May 17, 2022, the Children’s Commission presented “Overview of Qualified Residential Treatment Program Legal Requirements.” Executive Director Jamie Bernstein, DFPS QRTP Lead Texas Flowers-Moffett, and DFPS QRTP Specialist Tiffani Tillman provided an overview of the QRTP model, placement process, and required legal findings that must be made for QRTP placements. The 90-minute webcast included a sample case scenario to provide practical tools followed by breakouts for peer discussion and Q&A. The webcast was approved for 1.50 hours of MCLE. The archived video provides 1.0 hour of MCLE, and all related materials are available on the Commission’s website.On March 8, 2022, the Children’s Commission presented “Child Welfare Case Primer: Statutory Hearings and Current Issues.” Senior JIR Rob Hofmann provided a summary of a child welfare case from investigations through various final outcomes. The 75-minute webcast featured a review of statutory requirements, recent legislative changes, and current issues such as dual status youth and placement. Best practices and practical tips for achieving positive permanency for children and engaging families and youth in the court process were also provided. The recorded webcast was approved for 1.25 hours of MCLE and 1.25 hours of Family Violence training credit. The video replay and accompanying PowerPoint presentation are available on the Commission’s website.37

  Data

THE  DATA  COMMITTEE  FOCUSES  ON  OPERATIONALIZING 

DATA-DRIVEN  DECISION-MAKING  THROUGH  CONTINUOUS 

QUALITY  IMPROVEMENT  AND  AN  ANALYSIS  OF  PUBLICLY 

AVAILABLE CHILD WELFARE AND COURT DATA TO IDENTIFY 

LEGAL  PROCESSES  AND  PRACTICES  THAT  PRODUCE 

DESIRED OUTCOMES, AS WELL AS WHICH PRACTICES NEED 

IMPROVEMENT.

2022 ANNUAL REPORT38

Office of Court Administration

Notice & Engagement

The Notice and Engagement tool in CPCMS involves using non-confidential 
case  data  to  provide  email  notice  to  users  about  upcoming  child  welfare 
hearings. The number of Notice and Engagement system users continues to 
increase. During FY2022, 165 new users signed up through the Notification 
and  Engagement  system  to  receive  hearing  notifications,  bringing  the  total 
number of users to 2,075. Hearing notifications were sent for 10,226 hearings 
with a total of 27,816 notifications sent.

Child Protection Management System

Funded  by  the  Children’s  Commission  and  created  by  the  Office  of  Court 
Administration,  CPCMS  is  a  case  management  system  unique  to  CPCs. 
OCA  provides  project  management,  programming,  and  testing  services  for 
CPCMS. OCA staffs a CPCMS Advisory Council of CPC judges, OCA staff, 
and Children’s Commission staff to identify and discuss various enhancements 
and issues. 

In  FY2022,  four  software  releases  were  conducted  which  included  fifteen 
enhancements that improved court efficiency with the planning and scheduling 
of hearings relating to due process and timeliness, case data management, 
and functionality used in monitoring and promoting the well-being and positive 
outcomes of youth in the child welfare system.  Additionally, a juvenile justice 
section  was  implemented  into  CPCMS  to  allow  data  collection  for  a  pilot  of 
three CPCs hearing juvenile justice cases for dual status youth.

Data Collection and Information Sharing

In  FY2022,  OCA  hired  a  full-time  Senior  Data Analyst  to  conduct  research 
on court data trends in referrals, investigations, and removals from January 
2019 to May 2022. The analysis looks at data prior to and after the height of 
the pandemic which saw a switch to virtual hearings from in-person hearings 
and the effects of implementation of recent legislative changes to the Texas 
Family Code. 

Data used for the study included a high-level statewide overview from all CPCs 
in Texas, five of which were then selected for an in-depth review of CPC trends 
using CPCMS data, and supplemental publicly available data from DFPS. 

A report documenting the results was completed in September 2022 and will 
be used to inform best practice recommendations for judges and stakeholders.  
The Senior Data Analyst will prepare and deliver these suggested best practices 
to judges and stakeholders to support continuous quality improvement.

Texas Center for Child and Family Studies

Permanent Managing Conservatorship Courts

In FY2022, the Center supported the Permanent Managing Conservatorship (PMC) 
court project evaluations. The surveys, focus groups, and interviews recommended 
by the workgroup were conducted in October and early November 2021 and the 
Raising  the  Bar: Examining  Court  Practices  and  Wellbeing Among  Children  and 
Youth in the Permanent Managing Conservatorship of the State report was released 
on  December  29,  2021.  The  report  revealed  that  stakeholders  were  aligned  on 
how  they  conceptualize  well-being  for  children  and  youth  in  the  PMC  of  DFPS. 
The  report  further  found  that  PMC  courts  currently  operating  in Texas  are  using 
approaches and practices that target the dimensions of well-being articulated by 
stakeholders. The findings from the study suggest that PMC courts are a promising 
approach for improving well-being among children in youth in PMC. 

Permanent Managing Conservatorship Model Evaluation

The PMC Model Evaluation Workgroup developed a plan to use surveys, focus groups, and interviews 
to obtain data regarding the PMC Court from the CASA programs in Harris and Dallas Counties and 
attorneys  practicing  in  the  PMC  courts  in  both  jurisdictions.  Going  forward,  the  workgroup  aims  to 
conduct  a  study  that  compares  two  groups:  children  whose  cases  were  placed  on  the  PMC’s  court 
docket upon entering PMC and children whose cases remained in a non-PMC court. 

2022 ANNUAL REPORTThe CPCMS and IMPACT Integration Workgroup identified the need to develop an MOU to share a sample data set to test the data matching criteria to determine whether data sharing and integration between the CPCMS and IMPACT systems could be successful. Negotiations over the MOU were put on pause when DFPS announced an overhaul of its data requests procedure. The overhaul included creating a new web-based, self-managed process for requesting data for research, policy, or custom analysis requests.After the overhaul was complete and the new web-based procedures were in place, the CPCMS and IMPACT integration workgroup met with DFPS to discuss the appropriate pathway for requesting the data set and identifying the proper data fields necessary to test the matching criteria. It was agreed that the web portal was not the appropriate avenue for requesting the data set and that a Data Use Agreement (DUA) rather than an MOU would be more appropriate. DFPS has submitted a proposed DUA to OCA and it is currently under review. Once both parties have signed the DUA, the data sample can be shared, and the matching criteria can be tested.Children’s Commission
