bout the Judicial Commission on Mental Health 

The Judicial Commission on Mental Health (JCMH) was created by a joint order of the 
Supreme Court of Texas and the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas. The mission of the 
JCMH  is  to  engage  to  empower  court  systems  through  collaboration,  education,  and 
leadership, thereby improving the lives of individuals with mental health needs, intellectual 
and  development  disabilities,  and  substance  use  disorders.  For  more  information,  see 
www.texasjcmh.gov.   

bout the Texas Health and Human Services Commission 

The Texas Health and Human Services (HHS) System is comprised of more than 41,000 
public servants under two agencies: The Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) 
and The Department of State Health Services (DSHS).  

These agencies serve millions of people each month and deliver hundreds of programs and 
services.  Additionally,  the  agency  operates  13  state  supported  living  centers,  which 
provide direct services and supports to people with IDD, and 10 state hospitals, which 
serve people who need inpatient psychiatric care. 

bout Eliminate the Wait 

It  is  time  to  right  size  competency  restoration  services  for  Texans  by  taking  a  holistic 
approach  to  this  challenge.  The  Texas  Judicial  Commission  on  Mental  Health  and  the 
Texas  Health  and  Human  Services  Commission  asks  judges,  prosecutors,  defense 
attorneys,  sheriffs  and  jail  staff,  police,  and  behavioral  health  providers  to  join  their 
collaborative  effort  to  change  how  Texas  serves  people  at  the  intersection  of  mental 
health and criminal justice. We all have a role to play to ELIMINATE THE WAIT. 

This toolkit includes a set of strategies that stakeholders can implement to help ELIMINATE 
THE WAIT for inpatient competency restoration services in Texas.

The Texas Toolkit for Rightsizing 
Competency Restoration Services 

  

The  competency  to  stand  trial  process  is  designed  to  protect  the  rights  of  people  who  do  not 
understand the charges against them and are unable to assist in their own defense. Like other states 
across the U.S., Texas faces a growing crisis in the number of people who are waiting in county jails for 
inpatient competency restoration services after being declared incompetent to stand trial (IST). Not 
only has this increased costs and overburdened state agencies and county jails but it also is taking a 
significant toll on the health and well-being of people waiting in Texas jails for inpatient competency 
restoration services. Meanwhile, resources available to the behavioral health and justice professionals 
serving our communities are becoming scarce. 

More than 1,800 
people are currently 
waiting in Texas jails 
for Competency 
Restoration Services.  

Over the past 20 years, 
Texas has seen a 38% 
increase in people who are 
found incompetent  
to stand trial. 

Nearly 70% of state 
hospital beds in Texas 
are used by the 
forensic population. 

It  is  time  to  right  size  competency  restoration  services  for  Texans  by  taking  a  comprehensive  and 
integrated  approach  to  this  challenge.  The  JCMH  and  the  HHSC  asks  judges,  prosecutors,  defense 
attorneys, sheriffs and jail staff, police, and behavioral health providers to join their collaborative effort 
to change how Texas serves people at the intersection of mental health and criminal justice. We all 
have a role to play to ELIMINATE THE WAIT. 

This toolkit includes a set of strategies that stakeholders can implement to help eliminate the wait for 
inpatient competency restoration services in Texas. 

“We applaud this collaborative effort to raise 
awareness  about  competency-restoration 
services and best practices. It engages courts, 
l
aw  enforcement,  and  mental  health 
professionals in an effort to better use state 
resources  for  people  with  mental  health 
i
d
sorders or intellectual and developmental 
d
sabilities  who  encounter  our  justice 
i
system.” 

Hon. Jane Bland, Justice, Supreme Court of 
Texas; Chair, JCMH 

Hon.  Barbara  Hervey,  Judge,  Court  of 
Criminal Appeals of Texas; Chair, JCMH 

“We have a responsibility to work across 
systems  to  reduce  and  prevent  justice 
nvolvement and connect people to care in 
i
the  community.  When  competency 
restoration is needed, it should be for the 
purpose  it  was  intended:  to  provide 
stabilization and legal education.”

thousands  of  public  safety  hours  are  spent 
each year on services related to competency 
restoration — from arrest to inmate housing, 
court proceedings to inpatient state hospital 
stays,  and,  finally,  to  disposition.  Eliminating 
the wait for inpatient competency restoration 
services brings accountability to public safety 
and fiscal stewardship.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 16.23(b).  

People with a mental illness or an intellectual

possible.  The  Texas  Code  of  Criminal 
Procedure  Art.  16.23(a)  states,  officers  shall 
make  a  good-faith  effort  to  divert  a  person 
who  is  suffering  a  mental  health  crisis  or 
suffering from the effects of substance abuse 
to  a  proper  treatment  center  in  the  law 
enforcement agency’s jurisdiction.1

over  a  year  from  the  time  incompetency  is 
raised to the final disposition of the criminal

managing case flow, communicating between 
parties  and  scheduling.  Sometimes  a  person 
who has been restored at a state hospital and 
returned  to  jail  experiences  deterioration  of 
 
their  mental  health  while  waiting  for  their

The Causes 

The Solutions 

7What’s My Role to Eliminate the Wait for 
Competency Restoration Services? 

Local Mental Health and Behavioral Health Authorities, Local Intellectual and 
Developmental Disability Authorities, and other Behavioral Health Treatment Providers 

   

Behavioral health treatment providers are the frontline in reducing the number of people with a mental health 
(MH), substance use disorder (SUD), or an intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) who become involved in 
the criminal justice system. These efforts include offering timely crisis response and pre-arrest diversion programs, 
providing quality community-based services, and establishing positive relationships with criminal justice partners 
to facilitate a collaborative approach. By connecting people to care outside of the criminal justice system, 
behavioral health treatment providers can reduce the number of people in need of competency restoration 
services. If a person is found incompetent to stand trial, providing alternatives to inpatient competency restoration 
can prevent a person from waiting in jail for an available inpatient bed. 

1. Expand Crisis Response and Pre-Arrest 

Diversion Options

□ Do I offer a range of crisis services?

□ Do  I  offer  services  that  are  accessible  at 
the earliest signs of crisis, such as walk-in 
if 
and 
appointments 
permitted?

t elehealth, 

□ Do  I  offer  a  range  of  services  for  people 
experiencing  acute  crisis,  such  as  round-
the-clock  mobile  crisis  teams  and  short-
term crisis stabilization services?

□ Do I offer follow up services after a crisis 
care  episode  that  ensure  ongoing  access 
to care such as care coordination?
□ Do  I  have  pre-arrest  diversion  programs  and 
partnerships in place in all counties in my local 
service  area  that  focus  on  preventing  criminal 
justice  involvement  of  people  with  MH,  SUD, 
or  I DD,  as  described  in  Tex.  Health  &  Safety 
Code §§ 533.0354 and 533.108?
□ Do  I  deploy  a  full  range  of  public  safety 
including  partnering  with 

responses, 
emergency medical services?

□ Do  I  provide  crisis  response  support  to 
law  enforcement  through  co-response  or 
virtual co-response?

□ Have I developed a shared understanding with 
local law enforcement officers on the s cope of 
their  discretion  and  responsibilities  f or  an 
emergency detention without a warrant under 
Tex.  Health  &  Safety  Code  §  573.001?1

□

Do  I  have  a  range  of  easy  access  drop-off 
options for all counties in my local service area 
for people who need immediate crisis support?

2. Promote Alternatives to Inpatient 

Competency Restoration
□ Do  I  offer  outpatient  competency  restoration 
competency 
(OCR) 
restoration (JBCR) to provide an alternative to 
inpatient  competency  restoration  services?  If  
not, have I explored these options?

jail-based 

and/or 

□ Do  I  have  a  process  in  place  for  actively 
monitoring  persons  under  a  Code  of  Criminal 
Procedure  46B  commitment  order  based  on 
Form  Z,  the  Forensic  Clearinghouse  Waitlist 
Template?

3. Provide Services that Reduce

Justice-Involvement and Ensure 
Continuity of Care

□

services?

□ Are  my  staff  educated  on  justice-responsive 
programs and interventions, such as cognitive 
behavioral treatment targeted to criminogenic 
forensic 
risk,  motivational 
intensive  case  management,  and  critical  time 
intervention?

interviewing, 

□ Are my staff educated on criminogenic risk and 
need factors that contribute to recidivism?

84. Lead Through Partnership

Additional Resources: 

□ Do 

I 

coordinate, 

communicate, 

and

collaborate with criminal justice partners?
□ Do  I  have  representation  from  criminal
justice  partners  on  my  advisory  board,
sheriffs’
including  police  departments, 
offices, and courts?

□ Do  I,  or  staff,  participate  in  local  planning
boards and workgroups focused on issues at
the  intersection  of  behavioral  health  and
criminal justice?

□ Are  criminal  justice  partners  educated  on
diversion  programs  available  through  my
including  the  crisis  hotline,
organization, 
mobile  crisis 
response,  mental  health
deputies, co-responder teams, and other like
programs?

□ If I provide OCR and/or JBCR services, do I
provide  education  to  defense  attorneys,
prosecutors,  and  judges  on  these  programs
as  alternatives  to 
inpatient  competency
restoration?

□ Do  I  actively  promote  my  organization’s
justice

diversion  programs  with  criminal 
partners?

□ Do I offer training to criminal justice partners

on Mental Health First Aid?

□ Are policies, procedures, and/or processes in
place for diversion programs that clarify and
outline the roles, responsibilities, and actions
of my staff and those of our criminal justice
partners?

□ Do  I  or  my  leadership  team  have  a  direct
connection  or  relationship  with  each  of  my
criminal 
law
justice  partners, 
enforcement,  jail  administration,  and  the
judiciary for each county in my service area?
□ Do I understand the challenges experienced
by  criminal  justice  partners  in  working  with
my  organization  as  well  as  in  utilizing  my
crisis and diversion programs?

1 Tex. Health & Safety Code Section 573.001 provides peace officers with 
broad  discretion  to  make  a  warrantless  apprehension  of  a  person  with 
mental illness, regardless of age, when the officer has reason to believe 
and does believe that because of the mental illness “there is a substantial 
risk  of  serious  harm  to  the  person  or  to  others  unless  the  person  is 
immediately  restrained.”  This  belief  may  be  based  on  information 
provided by a credible person, the apprehended person’s conduct; or the 
circumstances  under  which  the  apprehended  person  is  found.  If  a 
warrantless apprehension is made, peace officers must: 

Transport  the  individual  to  the  nearest  appropriate  inpatient  mental 
health  facility  or  a  mental  health  facility  deemed  suitable  by  the  local 
mental health authority, if an appropriate inpatient mental health facility 
is  not  available  OR  Transfer  the  apprehended  person  to  emergency 
medical services personnel of an emergency medical services provider in 
accordance with a memorandum of understanding executed under Texas 
Health & Safety Code 573.005 for transport to the nearest appropriate 
mental health facility or, if one is not available, to a mental health facility 
deemed suitable by the local mental health authority. 

Pursuant to Texas Health & Safety Code Section 573.002, give notice of 
detention to the facility using Notification of Emergency Detention form; 
without  notice,  the  facility  may  not  hold  the  person  involuntarily. 

2  When  a  person  is  processed  into  correctional  institutions,  facility 
personnel run a CCQ and receive an alert which identifies if the individual 
has  a  history  of  receiving  mental  health  services  from  state-funded 
mental health programs. 

9What’s My Role to Eliminate the Wait for 
Competency Restoration Services? 

 POLICE

 

Police officers are the gatekeepers of the criminal justice system. Texas law has granted peace officers 
discretion in diverting people with a mental illness (MI), substance use disorder (SUD), or an intellectual 
or developmental disability (IDD) from the criminal justice system without arrest, when appropriate. By 
doing this, peace officers help ensure that criminal justice system resources are focused on people who 
truly pose a threat to public safety, thus decreasing the number of people who enter the criminal justice 
system and reducing demand for inpatient competency restoration services. 

1. Plan for a Pre-Arrest Diversion and Crisis

 

Response

□ Have I identified pre-arrest diversion and crisis 
response  models  that  will  work  for  my  agency 
and  community  (e.g.,  Crisis  Intervention  Team 
training; law enforcement and mental health co-
response; clinician and officer remote evaluation 
programs; or other interdisciplinary mobile crisis 
response  teams)  and  developed  policies  a  d 
procedures  to  support  the  implementation  of 
these models?

□ Do I have a single representative (ideally senior 
level)  that  is  responsible  for  overseeing  and 
managing  pre-arrest  diversion  and/or  crisis 
response programs?

□ Are  policies  and  procedures  in  place  for  crisis 
responses  that  clarify  and  outline  the  roles, 
responsibilities,  and  actions  of  my  staff  and 
those of our behavioral health partners?

□

Do 

I  have 

inter-agency  memoranda  of 
understanding,  policies,  procedures,  and/or 
agreements  to  help  guide  referrals  from  my 
agency to local behavioral health providers?

□ Do I collect data to help improve pre-arrest and 

crisis response programs?

2. Create a Culture of Diversion First
□ Do I communicate to my officers the importance 
of diverting people with MI, SUD, or I DD, when 
appropriate,  from  the  criminal  justice  s ystem 
and connecting them to treatment?

□ Do I have an agency policy for interactions with 

people who have MI, SUD or IDD?

□

Per  Tex.  Code  Crim.  Proc.  Art.16.23(a),  are  my 
officers aware that they must make a good-faith 
effort  to  divert  a  person  (1)  suffering  a  mental 
health  crisis  or  (2)  suffering  from  the  effects  of 
substance abuse to a proper treatment center in

Tex. Health & Safety Code Section 573.001 provides peace 
officers  with  broad  discretion  to  make  a  warrantless 
apprehension of a person with mental illness, regardless of 
age, when the officer has reason to believe and does believe 
that because of the mental illness “there is a substantial risk 
of serious harm to the person or to others unless the person 
is  immediately  restrained.”  This  belief  may  be  based  on 
information provided by a credible person, the apprehended 
person’s  conduct;  or  the  circumstances  under  which  the 
apprehended person is found. If a warrantless apprehension 
is made, peace officers must: 
•

Transport  the  individual  to  the  nearest  appropriate
inpatient mental health facility or a mental health facility 
deemed suitable by the local mental health authority, if
an  appropriate  inpatient  mental  health  facility  is  not
available

11What’s My Role to Eliminate the Wait for 
Competency Restoration Services? 

SHERIFFS AND JAIL ADMINISTRATORS
Sheriffs and jail administrators play a critical role in improving the competency restoration process. When 
appropriate, they can reduce further involvement with the criminal justice system and the need for competency 
restoration services through jail diversion; early identification of people with a mental illness (MI), substance use 
disorder (SUD), or intellectual and developmental disability (IDD); and timely interventions, like connection to 
treatment. Provision of behavioral health services and medications while a person is incarcerated may increase the 
likelihood that a person’s symptoms improve and reduce the potential for mental health deterioration that may 
lead to findings that they are incompetent to stand trial.

13What’s My Role to Eliminate the Wait for 
Competency Restoration Services? 
JUDGES AND COURT STAFF 

Judges play an essential role in helping eliminate the wait for competency restoration (CR) services. By leading and 
facilitating the collaboration of parties, courts can connect people with the appropriate mental health treatment and 
services. Furthermore, Judges ensure the legal system is more just, compassionate, and fair by promoting practices 
that help those with mental illness (MI) and Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) receive the necessary 
treatment to prevent recidivism, thus balancing community needs and judicial economy. 

   

 

1.

Identify and Meet Mental Health and IDD
Needs at the Earliest Point

□ Do  I  receive  timely  notice  of  credible  information
from jail administration that may establish reasonable
cause to believe that an individual is a person with MI
or IDD? Tex. Code Crim. Proc. (CCP) art. 16.22(a)(1).
□ Do  I  (or  the  Magistrate  Judge)  order  the  16.22
Interview  if  reasonable  cause  is  found  (from  the  jail
admin or from an alternative source)?

□ Do  I  send  copies  of  the  Collection  of  Information
Report  (16.22  Report)  from  the  Interview  to  the
defense  counsel,  prosecutor, 
trial  court  with
jurisdiction, sheriff, and personal bond office/pretrial
supervision office? CCP art. 16.22(b-1).

□ Have  I,  or  has  my  county,  developed  a  process  for
collecting,

and 

□ Is  this  process  written  in  a  procedure  manual  for

others to follow in the future?

□ Do I (or the magistrate judge) appoint an attorney (if

applicable) as soon as possible?

□ If MI or IDD is evident, am I appointing someone with
training  and  experience  on  mental  health  (MH)  and
IDD and related legal issues?

□ Am  I  in  communication  with  my  Sheriff  about  the
issues that arise in my court if the jail does not ensure
individuals in custody:
□ Have  access  to  24/7  telemental  health  and
telehealth? Tex. Gov’t Code § 511.009(a)(19).
□ Are  being  provided  their  prescription  MH
medications as required by law? Tex. Gov’t Code
§ 511.009(d).

□ Have I considered utilizing a MH liaison position in the
courts  to  connect  with  the  jails  and  treatment
providers,  and  to  coordinate  between  courts  with
criminal 
those  with  probate
jurisdiction over civil commitments?

jurisdiction  and 

□ Does  my  Local  Mental  Health  Authority  (LMHA)  or
Local Behavioral Health Authority (LBHA) have a MH
liaison already? Is my court able to communicate with
this person effectively and quickly regarding specific
cases and dockets?

□ Have I developed a specialty court as required under

Tex. Gov’t Code § 125.005?

2. Create a Culture of Diversion First
□ Are  the  16.22  Reports  and  risk  assessments  being
used for decisions about bail, appointment of counsel,
treatment, specialty courts, & community supervision
conditions? CCP art. 16.22(c)(1) - (5).

□ On  misdemeanor  cases,  am  I  considering  treatment
or diversion alternatives first, and using competency
evaluations only as a last resort when alternatives are
not available or appropriate?

□ Are  diversion  alternatives  being  considered  for

individuals when appropriate?

□ Have  I  considered  outpatient  or 

inpatient  MH
treatment  instead  of  competency  restoration?  Has
the  option  for  Outpatient  Competency  Restoration
(OCR) been discussed with Defense and State?
□ If  the  offense  charged  does  not  involve  an  act,
attempt, or threat of serious bodily injury to another
person,  have  I  considered  CCP  art.  16.22(c)(5)  to
release  the  defendant  (D)  on  bail  with  charges
pending,  enter  an  order  transferring  D  to  the
appropriate  court 
for  court-ordered  outpatient
mental  health  services  under  Tex.  Health  &  Safety
Code ch. 574? CCP art. 16.22(c)(5); HSC 574.0345.

3. Consider Alternatives to State Hospital if CR is

Necessary

 

□ Am  I  aware  that  competency  restoration  services
(CRS)  are  not  comprehensive  mental  health
treatment?
□ The  goal  of  CR  is  to  return  the  client  to  a
competent state that would allow resumption of
the  adjudication  process.  While  symptoms  of
mental illness may be reduced during the client’s
time  in  CR  services,  CR  is  not  a  substitute  for
comprehensive MH treatment.

I 

□ Have 

considered  Outpatient  Competency
Restoration or Jail-Based Competency Restoration in
lieu of inpatient CR? CCP art. 46B.071.

□ I  am  aware  if  OCR  and  JBCR  is  available  in  my
community. If not available, am I aware of what I can
do to advocate for the creation of one or both in my
community?

□ Upon  an  indication  of  restoration,  have  I  approved
funding  for  the  defendant  to  be  re-evaluated  after
stabilization  to  see  if  D  is still  incompetent CCP  art.
46B.0755?

14144. Create  Efficient  Court  Policies  for  People  who
Receive  Inpatient  CR  Services  at  the  State
Hospital (SH)

□ Have  I  assigned  one  point-of-contact  between  my

Court and the SHl?

□ Have I sent a letter annually to the SH notifying them
of  my  point-of-contact,  who  should  receive  all
(name,  email  address,  fax,  and
communication 
phone)?

□ Have 

I  established  an  efficient  process 

for

communicating with the SH using email?

□ Does my Court coordinate with the probate court to
have  medication  proceedings  when  applicable,  and
start medication orders immediately, while the person
awaits  transport  to  SH?  See  Health  &  Safety  Code
§ 574.106 (MI); § 592.156 (IDD); CCP art. 46B.086.
□ If D is on court ordered medications, have I ordered
another competency evaluation after stabilization or
a check for evidence of immediate restoration under
CCP art. 46B.0755?

□ Do  I  schedule  status  conferences  periodically,  as
needed,  while  the  client  is  at  SH?  Do  I  urge  the
Defense and State Attorneys to continue to work on
the  case  while  waiting  for  the  individual  to  return
from SH?

□ Do I coordinate bench warrants to and from the SH?
□ To prevent decompensation, does my court set cases
preferentially when an individual has been restored to
competency under CCP 46B.084 and returned to my
county? CCP art. 32A.01.

□ Does  the  point-of-contact  communicate  with  my
coordinator  to  set  the  person  on  a  docket  quickly
upon returning from the SH or other CR program?

5. Leading through Partnerships
□ Has  my  Court  gathered  key  stakeholders  to  meet
regarding

improve  communication 

to 

regularly 
diversion?

□ Has  my  community  planned  and  established  co-

located services?

□ Are  the  agencies  and  individuals  listed  in  Health  &
Safety  Code  §  614.017  Exchange  of  Information
accepting 
disclosing 
about
defendants  with  mental  health/IDD  challenges,
including  jails,  LMHAs,  attorneys,  judges,  probation,
TDCJ, and others?

information 

and 

6. Education and Awareness
□ Do  I  require  training  for  the  defense  bar  on  best
practices 
including
for  clients  with  MH/IDD 
identification,  interaction,  protections  in  Texas  law,
and diversion options? Have I considered partnering
with JCMH, or other appropriate attorney educator to
create needed training?

□ Do  I  foster  an  open  dialog  about  the  common
misunderstandings  associated  with  Competency
Restoration Services (CRS)?
□ Many times, requests for competency evaluations
are  attributable 
to  a  well-intended,  but
inaccurate, understanding of CRS. Some view CR
as a method for connecting individuals to mental
health treatment.

□ The  reality,  however,  is  that  CRS  are  narrowly
focused  on  stabilization,  symptom  management,
and required legal education. This is not the same
as providing access to a fully developed treatment 
plan  and  services  with  the  goal  of  long-term
recovery and a positive place in the community.
□ Does  my  Court  utilize  a  list  of  attorneys  with
specialized  knowledge  in  MH  or  IDD  for  complex
cases?

□ Do  I  have  a  separate  fee  schedule  to  pay  attorneys
with  specialized  MH/IDD  knowledge  more  for
handling these types of cases?

□ Is  my  referral  process  to  a  mental  health  court  in
written form and shared with referral sources?
□ Who  are  the  referral  sources  (e.g.,  prosecutors,
defense  attorneys,  judges)?  Are  they  familiar  with
identification of individuals with mental illnesses and
understand potential judicial responses?

□ Are  all  the  judges  and  attorneys  in  my  community

aware of the diversion options?

□ Is my policy of preferential settings for cases in which
an  individual  has  been  restored  to  competency  and
returned  to  the  county  written  for  lawyers  to  know
and abide by the procedures? CCP art. 32A.01

1515What’s My Role to Eliminate the Wait for 
Competency Restoration Services? 

PROSECUTORS

Prosecutors play a critical role in helping to eliminate the wait for competency restoration (CR) services. If 
appropriate, diversion and connection to treatment is ideal to reduce further penetration into the criminal 
justice system and the need for CR services. Provision of mental health (MH) services and medications while a 
person is incarcerated may increase the likelihood that the person’s symptoms improve, reducing the 
 
likelihood that the person is found incompetent to stand trial (IST), or leading to the immediate restoration of 
a person previously found incompetent to stand trial.

Needs at the Earliest Point

□ Does Magistrate Judge order a 16.22 Interview
if  reasonable  cause 
is  found?  Does  the
Magistrate  Judge  send  me  a  copy  of  the
Collection  of 
(16.22
Report) in a timely manner?

Information  Report 

□ Is  there  a  mechanism  in  place  for  the  16.22
reports to be maintained and then sent to the
trial court and defense attorney once they are
assigned? CCP art. 16.22(b-1).

□ Do I suspect MH or IDD issues while reviewing
discovery? Have I noted this in the file? Have I
brought  this  to  the  attention  of  the  defense
attorney?  Do  I  take  this  into  account  when
deciding  the  disposition  of  the  case  and
alternatives offered?

□ Do 

I  participate  and  attend  collaborative
meetings  with  key  personnel  to  review  cases
and  address  MH  and  IDD  issues  early  in  the
process?

2. Work Toward Diversion First
□ Have I reviewed the case and determined if a
case should be filed and, if so, at what charging
level?  Did I consider MH issues or IDD during
this process?

□ Have  I  considered  a  defendant’s  16.22  report
and risk assessments in my decisions about bail,
jail  diversions,  treatment,  and  community
supervision  conditions?  Tex.  Code  Crim.  Proc.
(CCP) art. 16.22(c)(1) - (5).

 

□ Can I agree to a reasonable bond amount and
appropriate  bond  conditions?  Or  for  a  non-
violent  offense/prior,  a  PR  Bond?  CCP  art.
17.032; 17.03.

□ If  I  am  recommending  that  a  defendant  is
released  on  personal  bond,  have  I  consulted
with the defense attorney to determine what, if
any,  conditions  are  reasonable,  helpful,  and
doable in this person’s circumstances?

□ Am  I  aware  that  competency  restoration
services  (CRS)  are  not  comprehensive  mental
health treatment?
□ CRS  are  narrowly  focused  on  stabilization,
symptom  management,  and  required  legal
education. This is not the same as providing
access to a fully developed treatment plan
and  services  with  the  goal  of  long-term
recovery  and  a  positive  place 
in  the
community.

□ During  negotiations  and  discussions  with  the
defense  attorney,  am  I  open  to  options  other
than a competency evaluation? For example:

□ Can  I  agree  to  inpatient  or  outpatient
mental  health 
instead  of
sending  the  defendant  to  the  state
hospital  (SH)  for  inpatient  competency
restoration?

treatment 

□ If the offense charged does not involve an
act,  attempt,  or  threat  of  serious  bodily
injury  to  another  person,  can  I  agree  to
using  CCP  16.22(c)(5)  to  leave  charges
pending  in  criminal  court  and  divert  the
defendant  to  the  appropriate  civil  court
for  court-ordered  outpatient  mental
health  services  under  Tex.  Health  &
Safety Code ch. 574? CCP art. 16.22(c)(5);
HSC 574.0345.

□ Is  this  a  case  suitable  for  a  straight
dismissal under CCP art. 46B.004(e)?

□ Have  I  considered  the  possibility  of  dismissal

with:

□ a treatment plan;
□ a  referral  to  outpatient  mental  health

services;

□ a  referral  to  an  assisted  outpatient
(with  or  without
treatment  program 
civil/probate court supervision); or

□ a 

to  appropriate  court 

to
transfer 
commence 
commitment
civil 
proceedings?  CCP  art.  46B.151;  Tex.
Health and Safety Code ch. 571, 574.

1616□ Have I screened the case for possible entry to

diversion programs or specialty courts?

□

If I decide to dismiss a defendant’s case, have I
given  notice  to  the  defense  attorney  that
allows  them  to  communicate  this  with  their
client  and  assist  with  a  discharge  plan  or
transportation upon release?

□ Have  I  considered  whether  the  potential  to
adjudicate this case upon restoration is worth
the  potential  personal  and  societal  damage
caused by months long wait in the jail before a
hospital  bed  becomes  available  (i.e.,  loss  of
public  benefits,  disconnection  mental  health
services in the community, loss of housing, loss
of  connections  to  community  supports,  job
loss, trauma, or displacement)?

by 

prove 

incompetency 

□ Am  I  holding  the  defense  to  their  burden  of

proof (BOP) / meeting my BOP?
□ Typically,  there  is  a  presumption  that  the
defendant  (D)  is  competent,  and  defense
must 
a
preponderance of the evidence. CCP 46B.
003(b); Dusky v. U.S., 362 U.S. 402 (1960).
□ If  the  D  has  a  previous,  unvacated  IST
finding,  was  committed  for  restoration,  &
was  found  not  likely  to  be  restored,  then
the  D  is  presumed  incompetent,  and  the
State  must  prove  competency  Beyond  a
Reasonable  Doubt.  Manning  v.  State,  730
S.W.2d 744 (Tex. Crim. App 1987).
□ Am  I  suggesting  a  competency  evaluation  or
inpatient competency restoration services only
as a last resort?

3. Consider Alternatives to State Hospital if
Competency Restoration is Needed

□ Have  I  considered  Outpatient  Competency
Restoration  (OCR)  or  Jail-Based  Competency
Restoration (JBCR) as an alternative to inpatient
and/or  SH  competency  restoration?  CCP  art.
46B.071.

□ I am aware if OCR and JBCR is available in my
community?  If  not  available,  what  can  I  do  to
advocate for either or both in my community?

4. Continue to Work on Cases when the
Defendant Must Wait for Inpatient CR
Services at the SH

□ Am  I  continuing  to  communicate  with  the
defense  attorney  while  the  defendant  awaits
transfer to the SH?

□ Have  I  considered  what  evidence  might  fall
under the Michael Morton Act specific to MH or
IDD  cases  and  produced  all  evidence  that  is
material 
the
action?   Have  I  subpoenaed  relevant  medical,
psychological,  or  education  records  of  the
defendant?

to  any  matter 

involved 

in 

□ Have  I  considered  what  constitutes  Brady  in
mental  health  and  IDD  cases  and  produced  all
evidence to the defense that is in possession of
the  State  and  tends  to  negate  the  defendant’s
guilt  or  mitigate  their  punishment?   Have  I
reviewed  the  defendant’s  previous  cases  for
information,  records,  or  orders  that  should  be
produced to the defense?

□ Have  I  considered  the  mitigation  evidence
produced by the defense when making an offer
on  this  case?   Have  I  considered  offering
deferred adjudication?

□ Am  I  working  with  the  court  and  defense
counsel to obtain a fast court setting upon the
defendant’s  return  from  SH  or  another  CR
program  to  prevent  decompensation?  Have  I
requested a preferential case setting under CCP
art. 32A.01?

□ Am  I  advocating  that  the  defendant  receive
mental  health  treatment 
in  custody  while
awaiting transfer to or after returning from SH?
□ If necessary, have I filed an application with the
probate or other appropriate court to order the
administration of medications in custody to help
prevent  deterioration  (or  coordinated  with  the
county attorney to file the application)? Health
&  Safety  Code  §  574.106  (MI)  or  §  592.156
(IDD); CCP art. 46B.086.

□ Is this case one where the defendant is unlikely
to  restore  per  46B.071(b)?  Have  I  considered
proceeding  under  Health  &  Safety  Code
subchapters  E  or  F  (civil  commitment  with
charges pending or dismissed)?

17175. Create Education and Awareness
□ Have I been trained on best practices for cases
where  a  D  has  MI/IDD  including  identification,
interaction,  protections

diversion options? Consider working with JCMH or
other  appropriate  attorney  educator  for  needed
training.

in  Texas 

□ Does  my  office  actively  discuss  educational
resources,  community  resources,  and  court
practices and procedures for individuals with MI
or IDD?

□ Am  I  communicating  with  my  office  about  my
successes in diversion techniques for individuals
with MI or IDD?

6. Lead Through Partnerships

1818What’s My Role to Eliminate the Wait for  
Competency Restoration Services? 

DEFENSE ATTORNEYS 

Defense Attorneys can help eliminate the wait for competency restoration (CR) services. With best practices and current 
policies, defense attorneys advocate for their clients to receive mental health treatment, find an amicable resolution to 
the case, and prevent their clients from languishing in jail waiting for inpatient CR services. By focusing on these goals for 
their individual clients, defense attorneys contribute to the overall effect of reducing the total number of people on the 
competency restoration waitlist. 

2. Work Toward Diversion First 
□ Am  I  knowledgeable  about  local  MH  &  IDD 

resources?  

□ Have  I  established  a  contact  within  my  LMHA, 

LBHA, and/or LIDDA? 

□ Am 

I 

working 

my 
LMHA/LBHA/LIDDA  or  mental  health  jail/court 
liaison  to  discuss  alternatives  to  incarceration 
available in my community? 

closely 

with 

□ If  my  client  has  not  been  charged  with  or 
previously  convicted  of  a  violent  offense,  have  I 
advocated  for  my  client’s  release  on  a  MH 
personal bond? CCP art. 17.032; 17.03. 

□ During  bond  hearings,  do  I  use  my  client’s  16.22 
report  and  risk  assessments  to  advocate  for  my 
client  on  decisions  about  bail,  diversion, 
treatment,  and  possible  community  supervision 
conditions?  Tex.  Code  Crim.  Proc.  (CCP)  art. 
16.22(c)(1) - (5).  

 

□ If  my  client  is  being  released  on  personal  bond, 
have  I  made  arrangements  to  ensure  that  the 
client  has  the  transportation  and  other  supports 
necessary to adhere to bond conditions? 

□ Am I aware that competency restoration services 
(CRS) are not comprehensive MH treatment?  
□ CRS  are  narrowly  focused  on  stabilization, 
symptom  management,  and  required  legal 
education.  This  is  not  the  same  as  providing 
access to a fully developed treatment plan and 
services  with  the  goal  of  long-term  recovery 
and a positive place in the community. 
□ If my client wants to pursue MH treatment as part 
of  their  criminal  court  process,  am  I  zealously 
advocating for it?  

□ Have I made sure the prosecutor understands the 
distinction between CRS and comprehensive MH 
treatment?  

□ Have I advocated for the court and prosecutor to 
consider  outpatient  or  inpatient  MH  treatment 
instead of competency restoration for my client?  

 

 

1.

Identify and Meet Mental Health (MH) and 
Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities 
 
(IDD) Needs at the Earliest Point 

 

□ Is  the  Magistrate  Judge  ordering  a  16.22 

Interview if reasonable cause is found? 

□ If I believe my client needs a 16.22 interview, am I 

asking the Magistrate to order one? 

□ Am  I  receiving  a  copy  of  the  Collection  of 
Information  Report  (16.22  Report)  in  a  timely 
manner? 

         

□ Am I meeting with my client as soon as possible? 
□ At this meeting, am I asking my client about their 

MH and IDD history? 

□ To  the  greatest  extent  possible,  am  I  exploring 
 
with my client the risks and benefits of all possible 
options, to include making a choice about whether 
the  client  wants  to  address  their  MH  issues  as  a 
part of this criminal process or not? 

 

□ If necessary, am I re-visiting a client to re-evaluate 
their mental state if circumstances change? 
□ Am  I  asking  my  clients  if  they  are  receiving  their 
prescription  medications  in  jail?  Tex.  Gov’t  Code  
§ 511.009(d). 

□ If my client is not receiving their medication, am I 
communicating with the jail, magistrate, and trial 
court about this issue? 

□ Have  I  established  communication  with  the  jail 
MH  liaison  to  get  updates  about  my  client  and 
relay information for the client’s benefit.  

 

 
□ Do  I  ensure  that  my  client  and/or  their  family 
 
knows  how  to  provide  proof  of  client’s  valid 
prescription to the jail? 

□ Am I considering poverty, cultural differences, and 
language  differences  when  determining  whether 
to raise issues related to MH, IDD or competency? 
□ Have  I  investigated  whether  my  client  was  ever 
previously  found  incompetent  to  stand  trial  and 
the subsequent procedural history? 

           

 

   

 

19□ If  the  offense  charged  does  not  involve  an  act,
attempt,  or  threat  of  serious  bodily  injury  to
another person, have I used the 16.22 report to
advocate  for  CCP  16.22(c)(5)  diversion,  which
leaves  charges  pending  in  criminal  court  and
diverts the defendant to the appropriate civil to
the  appropriate  court 
for  court-ordered
outpatient  MH  services  under  Tex.  Health  &
Safety Code ch. 574? CCP art. 16.22(c)(5); HSC
574.0345.

□ Have I tried negotiating for a dismissal with:

□ a treatment plan;
□ a referral to outpatient MH services;
□ a referral to an assisted outpatient treatment
program (with or without civil/probate court
supervision); or

□ a transfer to appropriate court to commence
civil  commitment  proceedings?  CCP  art.
46B.151; Tex. Health & Safety Code ch. 571,
574.

□ Am I only using CR when it is necessary and the
best resolution for my client that does not cause
unnecessary  delay  or  harm  to  my  client?  ABA
STANDARDS RELATING TO COMPETENCE TO STAND
TRIAL § 7-4.2(e) (1989).

□ Have  I  considered  using  Ake v.  Oklahoma,  470
U.S.  68,  71  (1985),  (possibly  ex  parte  with  a
sealed motion) for appointment of an expert for
psychological  assessments 
instead  of  going
down  the  CR  path  to  achieve  the  same  goals,
evaluations, or evidence?

□ If  necessary,  am  I  requesting  funding  from  the
court for psychological evaluations (rather than
competency  evaluations)  for  decisions  about
trial, sentencing, and community supervision?
□ Am  I  meeting  my  burden  of  proof  (BOP)  /

holding the state to their BOP?
□ Typically,  there  is  a  presumption  that  the
defendant  is  competent,  and  defense  must
prove incompetency by a preponderance of
the evidence. CCP 46B. 003(b); Dusky v. U.S.,
362 U.S. 402 (1960).

□ If  client  has  a  previous,  unvacated
Incompetent to Stand Trial (IST) finding, was
committed  for  restoration,  and  was  found
not  likely  to  be  restored,  then  client  is
incompetent,  and  state  must
presumed 
prove  competency  Beyond  a  Reasonable
Doubt.  Manning  v.  State,  730  S.W.2d  744
(Tex. Crim. App 1987).

□ If the prosecution agrees to dismiss my client’s
case,  have  I  communicated  this  with  my  client
and  assisted  with  a  discharge  plan  or
transportation  upon  release?   Have  I  made  the
prosecution and the court aware of the need to
communicate and coordinate with the client, so
they  are  not  abruptly 
released  without
understanding what happened or transportation
or plan?

3. Consider Alternatives to State Hospital if

CR is Necessary

□ Have I considered, or asked the Court to consider
Outpatient  Competency  Restoration  (OCR)  or
Jail-Based Competency Restoration (JBCR)? CCP
art. 46B.071.

□ I  am  aware  if  OCR  and  JBCR  is  available  in  my
community?  If  not  available,  what  can  I  do  to
advocate for either or both in my community?
□ Do  I  work  with  my  LMHA/LBHA  ahead  of  the
competency  hearing  to  create  an  OCR  plan
before the hearing? CCP art. 46B.072.

□ Have I specifically made the request for OCR or

JBCR on the record?

□ Have I specifically requested these alternatives in

my motion and proposed order?

4. Continue  to  Advocate  for  Individuals  Who
Must  Wait  for  Inpatient  CRS  at  the  State
Hospital (SH)

□ Am  I  continuing  to  communicate  with  my  client
while  they  are  awaiting  transfer  to  SH  to
determine  if  they  may  have  stabilized  while
waiting in jail (with appropriate MH treatment) to
see  if  incompetency  is  still  an  issue  in  the  case?
See TEX. DISCIPLINARY RULES OF PRO. CONDUCT, R.
1.16 Clients with Diminished Capacity.

□ If stabilization has occurred before transfer, have
I requested another competency evaluation or a
check  for  evidence  of  immediate  restoration
under CCP art. 46B.0755?

□ Am I advocating for mental health treatment for
my client while they are awaiting transfer to SH
or other CR program?

□ Am  I  continuing  to  communicate  with  my  client
once  they  go  to  the  SH?  See  TEX.  DISCIPLINARY
RULES  OF  PRO.  CONDUCT,  R.  1.16,  Clients  with
Diminished Capacity.

□ Am  I  continuing  to  progress  this  case  and
communicate  with  the  prosecutor  while  waiting
for my client to return from the SH?

□ Am  I  communicating  with  the  SH  regarding  the
direct  release  of  my  client?  Do  I  work  with  my
LMHA,  LBHA,  prosecutor,  and  court  to  make  a
plan to set PR bond and have my client released
from SH to community living arrangement?

□ If strategically appropriate, and I believe my client
is  competent,  am  I  working  with  my  court  to
obtain a fast court setting upon my client’s return
from SH, or other CR program? Have I requested
a  preferential  setting  under  CCP  art.  32A.01?  If
necessary, have I filed a motion for a speedy trial
under art. 32A.01?

Eliminate the Wait for Competency Restoration Services? 

STATE HOSPITAL FORENSIC 

While a full array of community-based services can reduce the need for inpatient care, the Texas Health and Human 
 
Services Commission’s (HHSC) State Hospital System (SHS) is a critical component of the behavioral health continuum of 
care, providing inpatient psychiatric care to adults in nine of its state psychiatric hospitals. The state hospitals serve 
people with various mental health (MH) needs, including forensic patients who have been determined to be 
incompetent to stand trial or acquitted as not guilty by reason of insanity, and civil patients who are at risk of harming 
themselves or others or at risk of significant deterioration. HHSC is working to transform and modernize the delivery of 
inpatient psychiatric care and services at the state hospitals through several major initiatives, including expanding 
state hospital capacity and renovating and replacing the state hospital infrastructure. In addition, HHSC has prioritized 
efforts to transform the delivery of inpatient psychiatric forensic care and services by implementing strategies that 
achieve treatment and operational efficiencies and change.

Enhancing the Delivery, Quality, and 
Efficiency of Competency Restoration 
Services 

Competency Restoration Curriculum 
Standardization 

The SHS is developing a simplified and standardized 
competency  restoration  curriculum  for  use  at  all 
state  hospitals  to  improve  treatment  efficiencies 
and  patient  movement  through  the  competency 
restoration process.  

Outpatient Management Plan Quality 
mprovement Initiative 
I

The  outpatient  management  plan  (OMP) 
is  a 
document  presented  to  the  court  that  is  used  to 
prescribe the services, supports and requirements a 
patient must adhere to when transitioning from the 
SHS  to  the  community.  The  SHS  has  developed  a 
simplified  and  standardized  OMP  to  improve  the 
quality  of  the  plans  so  that  a  greater  number  are 
approved by the court on the first submission.  

Trial Competency Examination Quality 
mprovement Initiative 
I

To enhance how trial competency evaluations (TCE) 
are conducted in the SHS, this initiative includes: 







developing  and  implementing  a  standard
report  form  that  allows  for  the  SHS  to
extract necessary forensic data found in the
TCEs,

developing  an  enhanced  pool  of  qualified
forensic  evaluators 
the  SHS  by
implementing an evaluator registry, and

in 

implementing a TCE peer review process to
improve  the  quality  of  TCEs  completed  in
the SHS.

State Hospital System Forensic Treatment Data
Enhancement 

The  SHS  has  been  implementing  mechanisms  for 
reporting  and  collecting  accurate  forensic-related 
data,  including  data  from  a  standardized  clinical 
screening  of  competency,  to  help  make  data-
informed  decisions  and  develop  data-informed 
interventions

improvement  efforts  in  the  delivery  of  forensic 
treatment services.

2323Next Steps 

Over the next year, the JCMH and the HHSC will: 

• Develop additional resources to support the Eliminate the Wait Campaign.

• Offer  Sequential  Intercept  Model  Mapping  to  communities  who  seek  to
better understand how individuals with mental and substance use disorders
come into contact with and move through the criminal justice system, with
the goal of identifying resources and gaps in services at each intercept and
developing local strategic action plans.

• Offer  targeted  technical  assistance  to  stakeholders  who  seek  support  in

implementing the Eliminate the Wait checklists.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
