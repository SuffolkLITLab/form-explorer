The Supreme Court of Texas is an appellate court for the State of Texas and its financial records comply
with state statutes and regulations. This includes compliance with the Texas Comptroller of Public 
Accounts' Reporting Requirements for State Agencies. 

The Supreme Court of Texas, consisting of a Chief Justice and eight (8) Justices, is the highest appellate
court of civil cases in Texas. The Justices are elected for six year terms. The Supreme Court is also the
administrative head of the judicial branch of Texas government. It promulgates the Rules of Civil
Procedure, the Rules of Appellate Procedure and the Rule of Evidence.  It appoints the Administrative
director of the courts, the Board of Law Examiners, the Texas Court Reporters Certification Board and 
some members of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, the Commission for Lawyer Discipline and 
the Board of Directors of the State Bar of Texas.  It must approve the State Bar's annual budget.  Under the
Texas constitution and the Government Code, all law licenses and court reporter certifications are issued in
the name of the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court's authority is found in the Texas Constitution, Article V,
Section 3 and 31, and the Texas Government Code Sections 22.001-22.0070, 51.001-51.006, 74.021 and
81.000.

Due to the significant changes related to Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 34, 
Basic Financial Statements - and Management's Discussion and Analysis - for State and Local Governments,
the Comptroller of Public Accounts does not require the accompanying financial report to be in compliance 
with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  The financial report will be considered for audit by the
State Auditor as part of the State of Texas Comprehensive Annual Financial Report; therefore, an opinion has
not been expressed on the financial statements and related information contained in this report.

Blended Component Units
No component units have been identified which should have been blended into an appropriate
fund.

General Revenue Fund
The general revenue fund (fund 0001) is used to account for all financial resources of the state except those
required to be accounted for in another fund.

Special Revenue Funds
Account for the proceeds of specific revenue sources (other than for private-purpose trusts of for major
capital projects) that are legally restricted to use for specified purposes. 

The accompanying financial statements are presented on the basis of funds and account
groups, each of which is considered a separate accounting entity.

THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS (201)
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Capital Asset Adjustment Fund Type
Capital Asset Adjustment Fund Type will be used to convert governmental fund types' 
capital assets from modified accrual to full accrual.

Long-Term Liabilities Adjustment Fund Type
Long-Term Liabilities Adjustment Fund Type will be used to convert governmental fund 
types' debt from modified accrual to full accrual.

FIDUCIARY FUND TYPES

Fiduciary funds account for assets held by the state in a trustee capacity or as an agent for
individuals, private organizations, other governmental units, and/or other funds.  

Agency Funds
Agency funds are used to account for assets the government holds on behalf of others
in a purely custodial capacity.  Agency funds involve only the receipt, temporary investment, 
and remittance of fiduciary resources to individuals, private organizations, or other
governments.

C. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING

The basis of accounting determines when revenues and expenditures or expenses are
recognized in the accounts reported in the financial statements.  The accounting and financial
reporting treatment applied to a fund is determined by its measurement focus.

Governmental fund types that build the fund financial statements are accounted for using the 
modified accrual basis of accounting.  Under the modified accrual, revenues are recognized
in the period in which they become both measurable and available to finance operations of 
the fiscal year or liquidate liabilities existing at fiscal year end.  The State of Texas considers
receivables collected within sixty days after year-end to be available and recognizes them as
revenues of the current year for Fund Financial Statements prepared on the modified basis of
accrual.  Expenditures and other uses of financial resources are recognized when the related
liability is incurred.

Basis conversion adjustment fund types convert modified accrual basis to full accrual basis of
accounting. The following activities are recognized in these fund types:
    * Capital assets
    * Accumulated depreciation
    * Unpaid employee compensable leave
    * The outstanding debt service principal on long-term liabilities
    * Capital leases
    * Long-term claims and judgements
    * Full accrual revenues and expenses
    * Pension amounts in governmental activities

Proprietary fund types and fiduciary fund types except agency funds are accounted for on the 
full accrual basis of accounting.  Under the full accrual basis of accounting, revenues are 
recognized when earned and expenses are recognized at the time liabilities are incurred.

D. BUDGETS AND BUDGETARY ACCOUNTING

The budget is prepared biennially and represents appropriations authorized by the legislature
and approved by the Governor (the General Appropriations Act).

Unencumbered appropriations are generally subject to lapse 60 days after the end of
the fiscal year for which they were appropriated.

E. ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND FUND BALANCES/NET POSITIONS

ASSETS

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are 
considered cash equivalents.

Capital Assets
Assets that meet the reporting threshold and useful life are capitalized.  The capitalization
threshold and the estimated useful life vary depending on the asset type.  These assets are
capitalized at cost, if purchased, or at appraised fair  value as of the date of acquisition.  
Purchase of assets by governmental funds are reported as expenditures.  Depreciation is 
reported on all "exhaustible" assets.  "Inexhaustible" assets such as works of art and historical
treasures are not depreciated.  Road and highway infrastructure is depreciated over the estimate
of average useful life of a grouping of assets using the composite method.  Other depreciable
assets are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset using the straight-line method.

All capital assets acquired by proprietary funds or trust funds are reported at cost or
estimated historical cost, if actual historical cost is not available. Donated capital assets are
reported at acquisition value.  Depreciation is charged to operations over the estimated 
useful life of each asset, using the straight-line method.

Current Receivables 
Other Receivables include year-end revenue accruals. This account can appear in governmental
and proprietary fund types. 

Non-Current Receivables - Other
There are no receivables not expected to be collected within one year.

UNAUDITED

THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS (201)
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

LIABILITIES

Accounts Payable
Accounts Payable represents the liability for the value of assets or services received at the
balance sheet date for which payment is pending.

Current Payables - Other
Payables are the accrual of year-end expenditure transactions.  Payables may be included in
either the governmental or proprietary fund types. 

Non-Current Payables - Other
There are no payables not expected to be paid in one year.

Employees' Compensable Leave
Employees' Compensable Leave Balances represent the liability that became "due" upon
the occurrence of relevant events such as resignations, retirements, and uses of leave
balances by covered employees.  Liabilities are reported separately as either current or
noncurrent in the statement of net assets.

FUND BALANCES/NET POSITION

"Fund balance" is the difference between assets plus deferred outflows of resources and
liabilities plus deferred inflows of resources on the governmental fund statements. "Net position"
is the difference between assets plus deferred outflows of resources and liabilities plus deferred
inflows of resources on the government-wide, proprietary and fiduciary fund statements.

 

Fund Balance Components
Fund balances for governmental funds are classified as either nonspendable, restricted, committed,
assigned or unassigned in the fund financial statements.

The Board uses resources in the following order:
* When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available, use:

1. Restricted Resources
2. Unrestricted Resources (as they are needed)

*When only unrestricted resources are available for use in governmental funds, use:

1. Committed Resources
2. Assigned Resources
3. Unassigned Resources

Nonspendable fund balance includes amounts not available to be spent because they are either:
    Not in spendable form -OR- Legally or contractually required to be maintained intact.

Restricted fund balance includes those resources that have constraints placed on their use through
external parties - such as creditors, grantors, contributors, laws or regulations of other governments -
or by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.

Committed fund balance can be used only for specific purposes pursuant to constraints imposed 
through legislation passed into law by a formal action of the Texas Legislature, the state's highest
level decision making authority.

13

UNAUDITED

THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS (201)
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Assigned fund balance includes amount constrained by the state's intent to be used for specific
purposes, but the constraints do not meet the requirements to be reported as restricted or committed.
Intent is expressed by: The Texas Legislature -OR- A body (for example, a budget or finance committee)
or official to which the governing body has delegated the authority to assign amounts to be used for
specific purposes.

Unassigned fund balance is the residual classification for the general fund. This classification represents
fund balance that was not assigned to other funds and was not restricted, committed or assigned to 
specific purposes within the general fund. 

Invested in Capital Assets, Net of Related Debt
Invested in capital assets, net of related debt consists of capital assets, net of accumulated
depreciation and reduced by outstanding balances for bond, notes and other debt that are
attributed to the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those assets.

Restricted Net Position
Restricted Net Position results when constraints placed on net resources use are either externally
imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, and the like, or imposed by law through 
constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.

Unrestricted Net Position
Unrestricted Net Position consists of net resources, which do not meet the definition of the two
preceding categories.  Unrestricted net position often has constraints on resources, which 
are imposed by management, but can be removed or modified.

F.

INTERFUND TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES

The agency has the following types of transactions among funds:

1) Transfers:  Legally required transfers that are reported when incurred as "Transfers
In" by the recipient fund and as "Transfers Out" by the disbursing fund.

2) Reimbursements:  Reimbursements are repayments from funds responsible for
expenditures or expenses to funds that made the actual payment. Reimbursements of 
expenditures made by one fund for another that are recorded as expenditures in the 
reimbursing fund and as a reduction of expenditures in the reimbursed fund.  

3) Interfund receivables and payables: Interfund loans are reported as interfund
receivables and payables.  If repayment is due during the current year or soon 
thereafter it is classified as "Current", repayment for two (or more) years is 
classified as "Non-Current."

4) Interfund Sales and Purchases: Charges or collections for services rendered by one
fund to another that are recorded as revenues of the recipient fund and expenditures or
expenses of the disbursing fund.  The composition of the agency's Interfund receivables
and payables, if any, is presented in Note 12.

Employees' Compensable Leave
If a state employee had continuous employment with the state for at least six months, the state
employee is entitled to be paid for all unused vacation time accrued in the event of the  employee's
resignation, dismissal or separation from state employment. Expenditures for accumulated
annual leave balances are recognized in the period paid or taken in governmental fund types. For
these fund types, the liability for unpaid benefits is recorded in the Statement of Net Position.  Both
an expense and liability for business-type activities are recorded in the proprietary funds as the 
benefits accrue to employees.  No liability is recorded for non-vesting accumulating rights to receive 
sick pay benefits. This obligation is usually paid from the same funding sources(s) from which the 
employee's salary or wage compensation was paid.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
