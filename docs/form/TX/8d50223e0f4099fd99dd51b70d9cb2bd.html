Child Welfare Cases

Disclaimer:
The creation and production of this 2022 Tool Kit for Attorneys Representing Parents and 
Children in Child Welfare Cases is funded by the Children’s Commission through the federal 
Court Improvement Program. The materials in this tool kit should not be construed as an 
advisory or ruling by or from the Supreme Court of Texas or any other court on specific cases 
or legal issues. These materials are solely intended to address the improvement of the law, 
the legal system, and the administration of justice. The information included in this tool kit 
was originally released in August 2020 and updated in March 2022.

   

Justice Debra Lehrmann, Chair 
 
Jamie Bernstein, Executive Director 

 

March  15,  2022 

Dear Practitioner, 

The Supreme Court of Texas Permanent Judicial Commission on Children, Youth, and Families 
(“Children’s Commission”) is charged with strengthening courts for children, youth, and families 
in  the  child  welfare  system  and  thereby  improving  the  safety,  permanency,  and  well-being  of 
children. The Children’s Commission provides training, tools, resources, and support to judges 
and attorneys who work on child welfare cases across the state. One of the goals of the Children’s 
Commission is to promote high-quality court proceedings that safeguard due process, encourage 
meaningful child and family involvement, and include effective legal representation of all parties. 

As  part  of  the  ongoing  commitment  to  elevate  the  practice  of  law  in  child  welfare  cases,  the 
Children’s  Commission  is  pleased  to  share  this  Tool  Kit  for  Attorneys  Representing  Parents 
and Children in Child Welfare Cases. This tool kit is designed to benefit attorneys of all levels 
of experience by providing concise compilations of relevant legal subjects, applicable state and 
federal statutes, hearing checklists, and practice tips for representing parents and children in 
child  welfare  cases.  The  Commission  hopes  this  tool  kit  will  help  promote  best  practices  for 
attorneys in their advocacy both inside and outside the courtroom. 

Please note that while this tool kit is designed for those representing parents and children, it 
is among the many resources which the Children’s Commission has developed, supported, and 
provided to attorneys for parents, attorneys for children, attorneys representing the Department 
of Family and Protective Services, and judges including the Texas Child Protection Law Bench 
Book; Trial Skills Training; the Family Helpline; the Parent Resource Guide; and the Tool Kit 
for  Attorneys  Representing  the  Texas  Department  of  Family  &  Protective  Services  in  Child 
Protection  Cases.  Like  all  Children’s  Commission  materials,  this  tool  kit  is  available  free  of 
charge. 

Thank you for your dedication and advocacy on behalf of the parents and children involved in 
Texas child welfare cases. 

Letter from the Executive Director 

Sincerely, 

Jamie Bernstein 
Executive Director 
Children’s Commission

Exceptions – If the court:

 ● Finds at that hearing that the attorney has shown good cause why the attorney’s compliance

11

Legal EssentialsSUBSTITUTED JUDGMENT

In  limited  circumstances,  a  child’s  attorney  may  decline  to  follow  their  client’s  direction  and 
instead present to the court a position the attorney determines will serve the best interest of the 
child. If a guardian ad litem has been appointed, the attorney must consult with the guardian 
ad litem for the child but is not bound by the guardian ad litem’s opinion or recommendation. 
However, the attorney for the child must ensure that the guardian’s opinion and recommendation 
regarding the best interest of the child is presented to the court. 

The attorney may only substitute their judgment for their child client’s direction if the attorney 
determines that the child cannot meaningfully formulate the child’s objectives of representation 
because the child:

 ● Lacks sufficient maturity to understand and form the attorney-client relationship;

 ● Despite appropriate legal counseling continues to express objectives of representation that 

would be seriously injurious to the child; or

 ● For  any  other  reason  is  incapable  of  making  reasonable  judgments  and  engaging  in 

meaningful communication. Tex. Fam. Code § 107.008.

Duties of a Child’s Attorney Appointed in the Dual Role 
Conduct an investigation to determine the best interests of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 107.002(a) 
(1).

Consider the child’s expressed objectives without being bound by those objectives. Tex. Fam. 
Code § 107.002(b)(3).

Interview each person who has significant knowledge of the case including educators and child 
welfare service providers. Tex. Fam. Code § 107.002(b)(1)(B).

If substituting judgment, the attorney may present to the court a position the attorney determines 
will serve the best interest of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 107.008.

Child’s Attorney Practice Tip: In some Texas jurisdictions, long-standing practice 
has been to appoint  an  attorney serving in the dual role of attorney and guardian 
litem to every child in a child welfare case. However, an attorney who serves in the 
dual role may face an ethical dilemma when representing a child who is capable of 
forming  an  attorney-client  relationship  and  directing  representation,  if  the  child’s 
objectives are incompatible with the attorney’s assessment of the child’s best interest, 
but the child’s objectives do not meet the standard required to substitute judgment. 
The dilemma can be resolved by requesting appointment of another person to serve 
in the role of guardian ad litem for the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 107.0125.

Duties for an Attorney Appointed to an Alleged Father
Conduct an investigation regarding the petitioner’s due diligence in locating the alleged father, 
including verifying that the petitioner has obtained a certificate of the results of a search of the 
paternity registry.

Interview  any  party  or  other  person  with  significant  knowledge  of  the  case  who  may  have 
information relating to the identity or location of the alleged father.

Conduct an independent investigation to identify or locate the alleged father, as applicable.

12

Legal EssentialsIf the alleged father is identified and located, the attorney ad litem shall:

 ● Provide to each party and the court the alleged father’s name and address and any  other 

locating information; and

 ● If  appropriate,  request  the  court’s  approval  for  the  attorney  ad  litem  to  assist  the 

alleged father in establishing paternity.

If the alleged father is adjudicated to be a parent of the child and is determined by the court 
to  be  indigent,  and  opposes  the  termination,  the  court  may  appoint  the  attorney  ad  litem  to 
continue to represent the father’s interests pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code § 107.013.

If unable to identify or locate the alleged father, the attorney ad litem must submit to the court 
a written summary of the attorney ad litem’s efforts to identify or locate the alleged father with 
a statement that the attorney ad litem was unable to identify or locate the alleged father. Tex. 
Fam. Code § 107.0132.

Duties for an Attorney Appointed to Represent An Unknown Parent, 
Unlocated Parent, or Parent Who Has Been Served by Publication
Conduct an investigation regarding the petitioner’s due diligence in locating the parent.

Interview  any  party  or  other  person  with  significant  knowledge  of  the  case  who  may  have 
information relating to the identity or location of the parent.

Conduct an independent investigation to identify or locate the parent, as applicable.

If the attorney identifies and locates the parent, the attorney must:

 ● Provide  to  each  party  and  the  court  the  parent’s  name  and  address  and  any  other 

available locating information unless the court finds that:

 ○ disclosure  of  a  parent’s  address  is  likely  to  cause  that  parent  harassment, 

serious harm, or injury; or

 ○ the parent has been a victim of family violence; and

 ● If appropriate, assist the parent in making a claim of indigence for the appointment of an 

attorney.

If unable to identify or locate the parent, the attorney ad litem must submit to the court a written 
summary of the attorney ad litem’s efforts to identify or locate the parent with a statement that 
the attorney ad litem was unable to identify or locate the parent. On receipt of the summary, the 
court must discharge the attorney from the appointment. Tex. Fam. Code § 107.014.

Legal EssentialsBurden of Proof

Sufficient to Satisfy a Person of Ordinary Prudence and Caution
Ordinary Prudence and Caution is similar to the Probable Cause standard required for a search 
warrant. Ordinary Prudence and Caution requires a minimal showing of evidence, less than a 
preponderance, but enough to persuade a reasonable person. Applies to:

 ● Initial Hearing in a COS/MTP petition. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(m).

 ● Ex Parte Removal Hearing. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.101;

 ● Taking  Possession  of  a  Child  in  Emergency  Without  a  Court  Order.  Tex.  Fam.  Code  § 

262.104; and

 ● Adversary  Hearing.  Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201. 

Preponderance of the Evidence
Preponderance  is  evidence  that  is  of  greater  weight  or  is  more  convincing  than  the  evidence 
that  is  offered  in  opposition  to  it.  A  metaphor  to  illustrate  the  concept  of  preponderance  is 
the scales of justice rising slightly higher on one side; that is enough to meet the standard of 
Preponderance of the Evidence. It is the standard of proof generally used in civil cases. Applies 
to:

 ● 60-Day Status Review Hearing. Tex. Fam. Code § 105.005;

 ● Permanency Hearing before Final Order. Tex. Fam. Code § 105.005;

 ● Final Order Awarding Permanent Managing Conservatorship (PMC) (without termination). 

Tex. Fam. Code § 105.005;

 ● Permanency Hearing after Final Order. Tex. Fam. Code § 105.005; and

 ● Adoption Hearing. Tex. Fam. Code § 105.005.

Clear and Convincing
Clear and Convincing is the measure or degree of proof that will produce in the mind of the trier 
of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established. It is 
greater than a Preponderance of the Evidence but not as much as Beyond a Reasonable Doubt.

Applies to:

 ● Termination of Parental Rights when Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) does not apply. Tex. 

Fam. Code § 161.001; and

 ● An order placing a child in foster care under ICWA; 25 U.S.C.§ 1912(e).

Beyond a Reasonable Doubt
The  Beyond  a  Reasonable  Doubt  standard  is  met  when  the  trier  of  fact  is  fully  satisfied,  or 
entirely convinced that something occurred. Applies to:

 ● Termination cases subject to ICWA. 25 U.S.C. §1912(f).

Legal EssentialsBest Interest of the Child

Best interest of the child is always the primary consideration in determining conservatorship, 
possession, and access. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002.

Factors Determining Best Interest
The “Holley factors” below are a non-exclusive list of factors to consider: 

 ● Desires of the child;

 ● Emotional and physical danger to child now and in future;

 ● Parental abilities;

 ● Programs available to assist parents;

 ● Plans for the child by individuals or agency seeking custody;

 ● Stability of home or proposed placement;

 ● Any acts or omissions of a parent indicating the relationship is not proper; and 

 ● Any excuse for the acts or omissions of a parent. Holley v. Adams, 544 S. W. 2d 367 (Tex. 

1976).

home;

Additional factors to consider in determining a child’s best interest are outlined in Tex. Fam. 
Code § 263.307 and are included but not limited to:

 ● Child’s age and physical and mental vulnerabilities;

 ● Frequency and nature of out-of-home placements;

 ● History  of  abusive  or  assaultive  conduct  by  the  child’s  family  or  others  with  access  to 

 ● History of substance abuse by child’s family or others with access to home;

 ● Whether the perpetrator of the harm to child has been identified; and

 ● Special considerations for children 16 years of age or older. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.307. 

Court Hearings That Can Require a Best Interest Determination

THE ADVERSARY HEARING

When considering placement with relative.

If the court does not order possession of the child by a parent, the court shall place a child with 
a relative unless placement is not in the best interest of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201(n).

PERMANENCY HEARINGS BEFORE A FINAL ORDER

When determining whether to meet a child.

The court shall consult with the child if the child is four years of age or older and if the court 
determines it is in the child’s best interest. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.302.

When determining whether to send a child home.

At each Permanency Hearing before a final hearing, the court shall make a finding on whether 
the child’s parents are willing and able to provide the child with a safe environment and whether 
the return of the child is in the child’s best interest. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.306(a-1)(6). But see 
also Tex. Fam. Code § 263.002(c).

15

Legal EssentialsCourt Decisions That Require a Best Interest Determination

TRANSFERRING  A  CASE  TO  THE  COURT  OF  CONTINUING  EXCLUSIVE 
JURISDICTION (CCEJ)

The court shall order transfer to the CCEJ if the court finds the transfer is necessary for the 
convenience of the parties and is the best interest of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.203.

DENYING A PARENT VISITATION

If the court finds that visitation between a child and a parent is not in the child’s best interest, 
the court shall render an order that:

 ● States the reasons for finding that visitation is not in the child’s best interest; and

 ● Outlines specific steps the parent must take to be allowed to have visitation with the child. 

Tex. Fam. Code § 263.109(b).

WHEN CONSIDERING UNSUPERVISED VISITATION IN THE CONTEXT OF 
FAMILY VIOLENCE

It is a rebuttable presumption that it is not in the best interest of a child for a parent to have 
unsupervised visitation with a child if credible evidence is presented of a history or pattern of 
past or present child neglect or abuse or family violence by that parent or any person the parent 
permitted to have unsupervised access to the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.004(e).

EXTENDING THE DISMISSAL DATE

The  court  finds  that  extraordinary  circumstances  necessitate  the  child  remaining  in  the 
Temporary Managing Conservatorship (TMC) of DFPS and that continuing TMC is in the best 
interest of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.401(b).

ORDERING A MONITORED RETURN

The court finds that retaining jurisdiction is in the best interest of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 
263.403(a)(1).

DFPS Decisions That Must Consider Best Interest

WHEN CONSIDERING PLACEMENT

DFPS  shall  consider  whether  the  placement  is  in  the  child’s  best  interest.  In  determining 
whether a placement is in a child’s best interest, DFPS shall consider whether the placement:

 ● Is the least restrictive setting for the child;

 ● Is the closest in geographic proximity to the child’s home;

 ● Is the most able to meet the identified needs of the child; and

 ● Satisfies any expressed interests of the child relating to placement, when developmentally 

appropriate. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.107(c).

WHEN ASSESSING A RELATIVE OR DESIGNATED PLACEMENT

DFPS  must  conduct  an  assessment  to  determine  whether  the  proposed  placement  is  in  the 
child’s best interest. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.754(b).

16

Legal EssentialsEliciting Evidence Regarding Best Interest
A parent or child’s attorney should be comfortable eliciting information regarding a child’s best 
interest regardless of the position being advocated. Below are sources and topics for soliciting 
evidence regarding best interest at a trial or contested hearing.

PARENT/CONSERVATOR TESTIMONY

 ● Memories of the child’s birth or the day the child came into their life;

 ● The child’s unique role in the family;

 ● The bonds the child has with family members;

 ● The bonds the child has with the family’s community;

 ● Training/classes the parent has attended; and/or

 ● Knowledge the parent or caregiver has gained about the child’s needs and how they plan 

to meet those needs in the child’s home.

PSYCHOLOGIST/THERAPIST TESTIMONY

 ● The number of and type of placements the child has experienced in DFPS care;

 ● The progress or lack of progress the child has made in DFPS care;

 ● Clinical research regarding the effects of removal or separation;

 ● Clinical research regarding life outcomes of children who experience foster care or family 

separation;

 ● The child’s desires to remain/return home;

 ● What permanency means for this child;

 ● Behaviors of the child now and in the future; and/or

 ● Psychological effect of “closure” on the healing process.

SUBSTITUTE CAREGIVER TESTIMONY

 ● Typical day with the child (meetings/appointments they attend with or for the child);

 ● Training/classes they have attended;

 ● Any special needs of the child and how those needs have been met;

 ● How the child was when they first entered substitute care and how they are now; and/or

 ● Future plans for child (e.g. Does the caregiver plan to stay involved with the child and if 

so, how? Is the caregiver considering adoption?).

17

Legal EssentialsPleading Practice

While  DFPS  may  plead  multiple  grounds  for  termination  in  petition,  a  Suit  Affecting  the 
Parent Child Relationship filed by a governmental entity is subject to Tex. R. Civ. P. 13, which 
prohibits groundless pleadings brought in bad faith or to harass, as well as Tex. Civ. Prac. & 
Rem. Code § 10, which requires that each allegation or other factual contention in the pleading 
has evidentiary support or is likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity 
for further investigation or discovery. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.101(b).

Parent’s Attorney Practice Tip: DFPS may plead in the alternative, but if DFPS 
has pleaded a “laundry list” of all termination grounds or has included termination 
grounds  that  are  not  supported  by  affidavit,  consider  setting  a  meeting  to  discuss 
this further. Other options include serving discovery or a Request for Admission to 
ascertain the evidence that DFPS has on each ground, and if no evidence is provided, 
consider filing a Motion for No Evidence Summary Judgment to eliminate the grounds 
for which there is no evidence.

Common Pleadings 
Answer: Attorneys for parents and children should always file an Answer after their client has 
been served. 

Parent’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip:  If  a  parent  client  is  unlocated,  has  not  been 
served, and has not appeared before the court, do not file an Answer. An Answer or 
participation in the suit generally waives any defects in the previously issued service 
or notice. Appear at the hearing and make clear to the Court that your client has not 
been served and you are there strictly to ascertain information as to how the client 
can be located.

Special Appearance: If your client has never submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court (i.e., 
your client has never been to Texas) then a special appearance may be necessary.

Affirmative  Defenses:  These  should  be  filed  with  the  Answer  if  they  are  applicable.  All 
affirmative defenses that are applicable to any civil case apply; however, if the parent client has 
failed to complete one or more services ordered as part of the Court-Ordered Service Plan, an 
attorney may file the specific defense under Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(d) prior to the amended 
pleading deadline.

Counter-Petition: If a client is seeking relief from the court, it is important to file a Counter- 
Petition. This can be combined with the Answer. If a client has a preferred relative placement, 
consider  including  a  request  for  the  relative  to  be  named  managing  conservator  of  the  child, 
whether or not that relative has intervened.

Petition for Writ of Mandamus: If a client requests to contest the outcome of the Adversary 
Hearing  order  rendered  by  a  District  Court  or  County  Court  at  Law,  an  attorney  may  file  a 
Petition for Writ of Mandamus to the appropriate appellate court. The standard of review for a 
Writ of Mandamus is abuse of discretion. An order of an associate judge can only be subject to 
Mandamus if the referring court has adopted the order. 

Request for De Novo Hearing: If a client requests a de novo review of a ruling made by an 
associate judge, a written request for a De Novo Hearing must be filed within three working 
days, and the matter must be heard by the referring court within 30 days. Parties must specify 
the issues that will be presented to the referring court and may present witnesses on the specific 
issues raised on de novo. 

18

Legal EssentialsPleading Considerations for a Child’s Attorney
A  child’s  attorney  shall  participate  in  the  conduct  of  the  litigation  to  the  same  extent  as  an 
attorney  for  a  party.  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  107.003(1)(F).  Accordingly,  a  child’s  attorney  should 
file any necessary pleadings to further their representation of the child. Attorneys should only 
file  pleadings  that  their  clients  have  directed  them  to  unless  the  attorney  ad  litem  is  using 
substituted judgment (see discussion above).

CHILD CLIENT’S ANSWER

A  child’s  attorney  should  file  an  Answer  and  require  the  state  (or  other  parties  who  cross-
claimed) to meet the burden of proof. A general denial is an appropriate pleading. Tex. R. Civ. 
P. 83 and 85.

Child’s Attorney Practice Tip: An Answer of the child’s attorney who is serving in 
the dual role should also include an assertion that the court should consider the best 
interest factors specified in Holley v. Adams in rendering judgment. 544 S.W. 2d 367 
(Tex. 1976).  This  response  may  be  considered  a  “special  plea”  under  Tex.  R.  Civ. 
P.  85. Including the specific factors in a pleading puts these factors at issue in the 
case, supports discovery reasonably related to the discovery of admissible evidence, 
and establishes relevance for purposes of determining admissibility of evidence.

RESPONDING TO NONSUIT

The State cannot nonsuit a suit to terminate parental rights without court approval. Tex. Fam. 
Code § 161.203. If the State seeks to nonsuit, the child’s attorney should consider the child’s 
position. If appointed in the dual role, the attorney should also consider whether the nonsuit 
is in the child’s best interest, and file a response contesting the nonsuit if appropriate. Given 
that the State may not be very enthusiastic about pursing a Petition it has been prevented from 
nonsuiting, the child’s attorney should also consider filing a Cross-Petition on behalf of the child 
client.

CHILD’S CROSS-PETITION

The child’s attorney can file a Cross-Petition that can seek an outcome not pleaded by another 
party, but that meets the child’s desires and/or best interest. Tex. R. Civ. P. 85 and 60.

 ● Even  if  the  relief  sought  in  the  Cross-Petition  seeks  relief  already  sought  by  another 
party, the Cross-Petition preserves the client’s right to pursue the claim if the other party 
abandons or does not vigorously pursue that claim.

 ● Cross-petition  may  allow  the  parties  to  pursue  relief  that  the  state  is  restricted  from 
pursuing by DFPS policy or otherwise, e.g., if an out of state relative has surfaced too late 
in the proceeding to permit the state to seek an Interstate Compact on the Placement of 
Children  (ICPC)  placement.  The  child’s  attorney  can  use  a  cross-petition  to  continue  to 
seek placement with that relative as being in the best interest of the child.

CROSS-PETITION FOR NAME CHANGE

A name change may be needed due to inconsistencies or issues with the child’s legal name, such 
as a birth certificate listing the first name as “Infant,” or a listing of a last name different than 
the surname used throughout child’s life and in records.

Name changes are somewhat less complex before the child reaches the age of majority. If the child 
is 10 years of age or older, the child’s written consent to the name change must be attached to the 
Petition. Tex. Fam. Code § 45.002(b).

19

Legal EssentialsMotion Practice

A motion is a pleading seeking some specific relief. There are certain motions that are specifically 
defined in the Texas Family Code or Texas Rules of Procedure that have precise elements to be 
included and demonstrated, but an attorney for a parent or a child is not limited to pursuing 
only those motions delineated in the Codes and Rules. A motion can be filed to pursue the relief 
a party needs and can merely state the grounds for the relief and set forth the relief or order 
requested. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 21.

Potential Motions for Parents’ and Children’s Attorneys
Objection  to  Proposed  Service  Plan/Motion  to  Modify  Service  Plan:  If  the  parent  or 
child client needs additional services, or requests to eliminate services from the service plan, an 
attorney may file an Objection/Motion and seek relief from the court.

Motion  to  Increase  Visitation:  This  motion  can  be  filed  by  either  parents’  or  children’s 
attorneys when seeking to increase visitation or to obtain unsupervised visitation.

Motion to Change Placement or to Conduct a Home Study: This motion can be filed by 
either a parent’s attorney or child’s attorney, but the child’s attorney is specifically obligated to 
elicit “the name of any adult . . . who could be a relative or designated caregiver for the child.” 
Tex. Fam. Code 107.003(b)(4). If after providing the name to DFPS, and DFPS does not pursue 
the potential placement, the attorney can bring the issue to the attention of the court by motion. 
Even if it is not a licensed or approved home, the judge may order a change of placement.

Practice  Tip:  Evaluate  if  DFPS  is  excluding  the  proposed  placement  for  reasons 
that  might  be  unrelated  to  safety.  Look  at  the  length  of  time  since  last  criminal 
history, changed circumstances of the proposed placement, relationship to child, and 
review any home study denial closely.

Motion for Expedited Home Study: DFPS needs an order to request an expedited home study. 
To resolve the issue of placement as quickly as possible, an attorney can file this motion as soon 
as the need for a home study is identified.

Motion for a Monitored Return: If a parent has completed most of their services, but DFPS 
will not agree to return the child and dismiss the case, an attorney for a parent or a child may 
file a motion for the child to be returned home while the court retains jurisdiction, either through 
a  standard  monitored  return  or  transitionmonitored  return.  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  263.403(a)(2) 
(A)-(B).

Motion for Travel Costs: Depending on the jurisdiction’s policy toward travel reimbursement, 
this motion may be appropriate.

Motion  for  Paternity/DNA/Genetic  Testing:  May  be  necessary  if  the  alleged  father  does 
not acknowledge paternity, or when there is more than one alleged father. Tex.  Fam.  Code  §§ 
160.608, 160.621.

Motion for Continuance: An attorney may file a written and sworn Motion for Continuance 
if good cause exits to delay the trial and there is still time for the court to grant the motion and 
still commence trial on the merits before the statutory deadline. If denied, error is preserved for 
appeal. Tex. R. Civ. P. 251.

Motion for Extension: If a parent has completed most services but will not be able to complete 
the service plan prior to the statutory deadline, an attorney for a parent or a child may file a 
motion asserting that there are extraordinary circumstances sufficient to extend the case 180 
days beyond the original statutory deadline. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.401(b).

20

Legal EssentialsPotential Motions For a Parent’s Attorney
Motion to Exclude Drug Test Results: DFPS may attempt to admit drug test results through 
a business records affidavit. Drug tests require expert testimony as outlined in the Evidentiary 
Issues section of this tool kit. “Because of the more stringent clear and convincing standard for 
a parental termination case as opposed to other civil cases, the Texarkana court held that it 
is inappropriate to apply the more relaxed civil standard in determining the admissibility of 
business records.” See In re K.C.P., 142 S.W.3d 574, 580 (Tex. App.-Texarkana 2004, no pet.). See 
also Philpot v. State, 897 S.W.2d 848, 852 (Tex. App.-Dallas 1995, pet. ref‘d).

Motion for Daubert Hearing: If a party attempts to elicit expert testimony from a witness 
who is not qualified to give an expert opinion, an attorney may move for a Daubert Hearing to 
challenge the witness’s status as an expert. It will be necessary to voir dire the proposed expert 
on  the  qualifications,  data  relied  on,  and  scientific  procedure  as  outlined  in  the  Evidentiary 
Issues section of this tool kit. An attorney can consider following up with a motion to exclude 
expert witness if appropriate.

Motion for No Evidence Summary Judgment: After an adequate time for discovery, this 
dispositive  motion  can  be  filed  to  strike  any  termination  ground  alleged  in  the  pleadings  for 
which DFPS has provided no evidence.

Motion  to  Strike  Intervention:  If  relatives  or  foster  parents  file  an  intervention  over  the 
objection of a client, the intervention may be struck if the intervening party lacks standing, or if 
placement with them is not in the best interest of the child. A motion to strike the intervention 
should be specific in the reasoning as to why the intervention should be struck.

Motion for Funds for an Expert Witness: This motion may be most relevant in medical abuse 
cases when there are differing opinions as to how certain injuries occurred, although it could be 
used for any expert, including those for drug testing and psychological/psychiatric issues.

Motion to Appoint Temporary Possessory Conservator: This can be filed when the order 
granting TMC to DFPS does not specify that the parents are temporary possessory conservators 
with specific rights and duties.

Motion to Compel Discovery Responses: Consider  filing  if  DFPS  has  not  complied  timely 
with  discovery  requests.  However,  it  is  important  to  weigh  the  costs  and  benefits  of  such  a 
motion depending on evidence requested as evidence that is not produced in accordance with 
discovery is not admissible at trial.

Motion to Remove Guardian/Attorney Ad Litem: This motion should only be considered if 
there is serious misconduct by the child’s attorney which is prejudicial to a client. Talking to the 
child’s ad litem first regarding concerns might alleviate the need to file the motion.

Request to Disclose Information: Must be served to DFPS, prior to the Adversary Hearing, 
requesting  that  they  turn  over  the  names  of  non-DFPS  witnesses  who  will  testify  to  the 
allegations, copies of offense reports that will be used, and any photo, video, or recording that 
may be used at that Adversary Hearing. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.014.

Motion for Participation by Other Means: Parents have a constitutional right to attend not 
only their trial, but any ancillary hearings in the case. If a parent client is in jail, or otherwise 
indisposed  and  cannot  attend  trial,  the  attorney  may  file  a  motion  requesting  the  parent  to 
attend by telephone, television, Skype, Zoom, or other video conferencing method. If the motion 
is denied, then error is preserved for appeal.     

21

Legal EssentialsPotential Motions for a Child’s Attorney
Motion  for  Sibling  Visitation/Access:  If  a  client  is  not  getting  enough  contact  with their 
siblings, whether face- to-face or otherwise, the child’s attorney can file a motion to seek such 
access. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.551.

Child’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip:  Review  the  child’s  plan  of  service;  it  often 
recommends more frequent sibling access than is being provided. Consider filing a 
motion to request that the court order the amount of sibling access recommended by 
the child’s plan of service.

Motion to Modify Parental Visitation: File if a client desires, and/or it is in the client’s interest 
for the child to receive more or a different type of visitation with a parent, e.g., unsupervised 
visitation if appropriate. For example, if DFPS has set visitation for an inconvenient day/time 
for the parent or the child, and the child consistently misses class and would like to have visit 
days/ or times vary, the child’s attorney may file a motion to accommodate child and/or parent’s 
needs.

Motion to Modify Services for the Child: If the child needs a special medical service (such as 
a cranial helmet) or if the child would benefit from therapy by a different provider or specialist, 
file  a  motion  to  request  the  court  order  the  service.  This  motion  can  also  be  used  to  pursue 
normalcy issues such as allowing the child to participate in an extracurricular activity and/or if 
the child needs financial support for the same.

Motion for Child to Attend the Hearing/Confer with the Court: The Texas Family Code 
states that children shall attend each Permanency Hearing unless excused by the court, but a 
motion may be necessary if the child client wishes to attend a non-permanency hearing, or if 
local judicial practice excuses children from Permanency Hearings by default. Consider utilizing 
a Motion to Interview Child in Chambers. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.009.

Motion for Second Opinion on Psychotropic Medications: Tex. Fam. Code § 107.002(a)(2) 
provides for the attorney ad litem for a child to have access and review medical records and Tex. 
Fam. Code § 107.004(d-3) requires an attorney ad litem “to review the child’s safety and well-
being . . . and take appropriate action, including requesting a review hearing when necessary to 
address an issue of concern.”

22

Legal EssentialsFor a full list of the statutory grounds for Involuntary Termination of Parent-Child Relationship, 
see Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1). The non-exhaustive list below contains grounds often pleaded 
in DFPS cases.

Termination Grounds

Abandonment 
Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1)(N)

Has the parent:

 ● Constructively abandoned the child who has been in the PMC or TMC of DFPS for not less 

than six months; AND

 ○ Not regularly visited or maintained significant contact with the child;

 ○ Demonstrated an inability to provide the child with a safe environment; and

 ○ Has DFPS made reasonable efforts to return the child to the parent.

Endangerment: Conditions or Surroundings 
Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1)(D)

Has the parent:

 ● Knowingly  placed  the  child  or  knowingly  allowed  the  child  to  remain  in  conditions  or 

surroundings which endangers the physical or emotional well-being of the child. 

Endangerment: Course of Conduct 
Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1)(E) 

Has the parent:

 ● Engaged in conduct or knowingly placed the child with persons who engaged in conduct 

which endangers the physical or emotional well-being of the child.

Affidavit of Relinquishment of Parental Rights 
Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1) (K)

Has the parent:

 ● Executed  before  or  after  the  suit  is  filed  an  unrevoked  or  irrevocable  affidavit  of 
relinquishment of parental rights. Note: A parent who signs an affidavit of relinquishment 
is also required to compete a medical history report. Tex. Fam. Code §161.1031.

Criminal Conviction-Death or Serious Injury 
Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1)(L)

Has  the  parent  been  convicted  or  been  placed  on  community  supervision,  including  deferred 
adjudication community supervision:

 ● For being criminally responsible for the death or serious injury of a child, under any of 
the following crimes: (murder; capital murder; manslaughter; indecency w/ child; assault; 
sexual assault; aggravated assault; aggravated sexual assault; injury to child, an elderly 
individual  or  disabled  individual;  abandoning  or  endangering  child;  prohibited  sexual 
conduct;  sexual  performance  by  child;  possession  or  promotion  of  child  pornography; 
continuous sexual abuse of child or disabled individual;  human trafficking; or compelling 
prostitution).  Note:  this  ground  also  applies  to  out  of  state  convictions  for  crimes  with 
elements similar to those listed above. 

23

Legal EssentialsParent’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip:  If  DFPS  only  offers  judgments  of  convictions 
without  charging  instruments  or  any  other  evidence  of  the  underlying  facts  that 
support the conviction, a parent’s attorney may want to challenge the sufficiency of 
the evidence.

Prior Termination on Endangerment Grounds 
Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1)(M)

Has the parent:

 ● Had their parent-child relationship terminated with respect to another child based on a 
finding that the parent’s conduct was in violation of Paragraph (D) or (E) or substantially 
equivalent provisions of the law of another state. Note: the court may not order termination 
under  this  ground  unless  the  petition  was  filed  within  one  year  of  DFPS  being  named 
managing conservator of a child in the prior case that resulted in the termination. Tex. 
Fam. Code § 161.001(d-1).

Failure to Complete Services 
Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1)(O)

Has the parent failed to comply with:

 ● Provisions  of  court  order  that  specifically  established  the  actions  necessary  for  the 

parent to obtain the return of the child;

 ● Who has been in the PMC or TMC of DFPS for not less than nine months; and

 ● As a result of the child’s removal for the abuse or neglect of the child. 

Note: A court may not order termination under (O) grounds based on the failure by the parent 
to  comply  with  a  specific  provision  of  a  court  order  if  a  parent  proves  by  a  preponderance  of 
evidence that: the parent was unable to comply with specific provisions of the court order, and 
the parent made a good faith effort to comply with the order, and the failure to comply with the 
order is not attributable to any fault of the parent. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(d).

Parent’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip:  Though  an  affirmative  pleading  may  not  be 
required  by  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  161.001(d),  it  is  a  best  practice  to  plead  inability  to 
complete services as an affirmative defense if there is evidence to support it. If the 
defense is raised at a jury trial, an attorney should ensure the defense is included the 
jury charge.

Drug Treatment or Relapse 
Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(1)(P)

Has the parent:

 ● Used  a  controlled  substance,  as  defined  by  Tex.  Health  &  Safety  Code  Ch.  481,  in  a 

manner that endangered the health or safety of the child; and

 ● Failed to complete a court-ordered substance abuse treatment program; or

 ● After  completion  of  a  court-ordered  substance  abuse  treatment  program,  continued  to 

abuse a controlled substance.

 ● Confinement or imprisonment; and

 ● Inability  to  care  for  the  child  for  not  less  than  two  years  from  the  date  of  filing  the 

Note: The confinement or imprisonment for not less than two years is prospective from the date of 
the filing of the petition rather than retrospective. In re A.V., 113 S.W.3d 355 (Tex. 2003).

Termination of Rights of Alleged Biological Father 
Tex. Fam. Code § 161.002 

If an alleged father has been served with citation, his rights can be terminated if he does not 
timely file an admission of paternity or a counterclaim for paternity under Tex. Fam. Code Ch. 
160. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.002(b)(1).

An alleged father’s rights can be terminated without personal service of citation or citation by 
publication if: 

 ● The child is over one year of age at the time the petition was filed, and the alleged father 
has failed to register with the paternity registry, and after the exercise of due diligence by 
the petitioner:

 ○ his identity and location are unknown; or

 ○ his identity is known, but he cannot be located; Tex. Fam. Code § 161.002(b)(2).

 ● The child is under one year old at the time petition was filed, and the alleged father has 

not registered with the paternity registry. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.002(b)(3).

Petitioner’s  due  diligence  to  locate  and  identify  the  alleged  father  is  required  for  the  above 
sections including obtaining a certificate of the results of the paternity registry search from the 
Texas  Department  of  State  Health  Services  Vital  Statistics  Unit  indicating  that  no  man  has 
registered intent to claim paternity. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.002(e).

If  an  alleged  father  has  registered  with  the  paternity  registry,  citation  by  publication  is  not 
required, but DFPS must still exercise due diligence to locate alleged father, including a sworn 
affidavit describing their efforts to obtain personal service of citation at the address provided to 
the registry and any other address known to DFPS. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.002(b)(4). The court 
must enter specific findings regarding the exercise of due diligence by DFPS when rendering an 
order terminating parental rights under this section. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.002(f).

Legal EssentialsDiscovery

Overview
Discovery rules in DFPS cases are the same as in other civil cases and are governed by the Texas 
Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.  A  Suit  Affecting  the  Parent-Child  Relationship  (SAPCR)  is  usually 
subject to Level 2 Discovery. Please note that many courts who hear child welfare cases have 
Level  3  Discovery  Control  Plans  in  place  as  part  of  their  local  rules  and  may  modify  the 
date by  which  responses  are  due  and  require  court  approval  to  go  outside  of  the  parameters 
of the Discovery Control Plan. For more information, see Texas Law Help Discovery in Texas: 
Investigate and Prepare for Trial. 

It is important to respond to all discovery requests within 30 days after the discovery is served or 
in accordance with deadlines set forth in a court-ordered Discovery Control Plan. Note: Failure 
to  answer  discovery  in  a  timely  manner  may  limit  the  evidence  and  testimony  which  can  be 
presented at trial. Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.6(a).

Types of Discovery in Texas Rules of Civil Procedure

 ● Requests for Disclosure: Tex. R. Civ. P. 194

 ● Interrogatories: Tex. R. Civ. P. 197

 ● Requests for Production of Documents: Tex. R. Civ. P. 196

 ○ must be served at least 30 days before the end of the discovery period.

 ○ can include a request for entry upon property. Tex. R. Civ. P. 196.7

 ● Requests for Admissions: Tex. R. Civ. P. 198

 ○ failure to respond timely will result in requests being deemed admitted.

 ● Depositions: Tex. R. Civ. P. 199-200

 ○ any objection to the time and place of the deposition must be made by filing a 

Motion for Protective Order or a Motion to Quash.

 ● Requests for Physical and Mental Examinations: Tex. R. Civ. P. 204

 ○ in a DFPS suit (among others), on motion by a party or the court’s own initiative, 

•  one or more psychologists or psychiatrists to examine a child or other party to the 

the court may appoint:

suit, and/or

•  a qualified expert to test and determine paternity.

Practice  Tip:  If an attorney for the party served with discovery responds with an 
objection that the request is vague or not applicable, the proponent of the discovery 
request  can  consider  filing  a  Motion  to  Compel  Discovery  and  request  a  hearing  to 
address the validity of the objection. When there is a partial answer, if it is preceded 
by an objection, the objection should be addressed in this manner to ensure that a full 
answer is given.

Practice  Tip:  Some  attorneys  representing  DFPS  may  offer  “informal  discovery” 
such as providing a redacted copy of the agency case file. However, without a formal 
discovery request, the receiving party lacks recourse if DFPS fails to provide items 
or information. Formal discovery requested of DFPS in accordance with the rules of 
procedure provides the requesting party with greatest access to the information on 
the client.

26

Legal EssentialsPractice  Tip:  Some  courts  limit  depositions  or  require  that  a  motion  be  filed  to 
request a court order for depositions to be taken. Parents’ and children’s attorneys 
should learn in advance the court’s procedures for depositions and for the payment of 
court reporters taking depositions.

Child’s Attorney Practice Tip: Before agreeing to the return of a child to the parent, 
a child’s attorney may want to see where the child will be living and ensure that the 
home is safe and suitable. If the child’s attorney is unable to secure the agreement of 
the parent’s attorney to allow inspection of the home, the child’s attorney can serve a 
request for inspection under Tex. R. Civ. P. 196.7.

Notable Discovery Issues in DFPS Cases

DISCOVERY PRIOR TO THE ADVERSARY HEARING

Prior to the Adversary Hearing, a party may send a written request to the attorney representing 
DFPS asking that they turn over the names of non-DFPS employee witnesses who will testify to 
the allegations, copies of offense reports that will be used, and any photo, video, or recording that 
may be used at that Adversary Hearing. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.014. Items produced prior to an 
Adversary Hearing may need to be redacted by the attorney representing DFPS.

CONFIDENTIALITY WITH THE DFPS CASE FILE

DFPS files contain information that is confidential by law and may only be disclosed for purposes 
consistent with the Texas Family Code and applicable federal and state law. Tex. Fam. Code § 
261.201; See also 40 Tex. Admin. Code, §§ 745.8481 - 745.8493.

Practice Tip: Redaction of the record in accordance with DFPS rules and guidelines 
takes time. When production of the record is needed urgently, consider asking the court 
to order DFPS to produce the record with only the reporter’s name and confidential 
identifiers redacted.

DISCOVERY FOR THE CHILD’S ATTORNEY

Children’s  attorneys  are  entitled  to  seek  discovery  even  though  their  client  is  not  a  party 
to the litigation because the child’s attorney is directed to “. . . participate in the conduct of the 
litigation  to  the  same  extent  as  an  attorney  for  a  party.”  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  107.003(a)(1)(F). 
Another party may also request discovery from the child’s attorney; however, like any attorney, 
the  child’s  attorney  can  object  to  producing  specific  materials  on  the  basis  of  attorney-client 
privilege, attorney work product, or general confidentiality.

Parent’s Attorney Practice Tip: The “quasi-party” status of the child’s attorney 
can cause some confusion regarding discovery; local practice may vary as to whether 
attorneys  for  children  are  served  with  discovery.  If  not  served  with  discovery,  the 
child’s attorney may submit evidence that another party bound by discovery would 
not be allowed to present. Parent’s attorneys might consider filing a motion to ask the 
court to order the attorney for the child to disclose all witnesses that they may seek 
to call, and to produce all exhibits that they may seek to admit.

27

Legal EssentialsSpecial rules govern the exchange of information about expert witnesses in the discovery process. 
Note that the scope of discovery is different when cases involve testifying experts or consulting 
experts (those experts whose work has been reviewed by a testifying expert). Tex. R. Civ. P. 195.

EXPERTS

PRIVILEGES

Commonly invoked privileges in child abuse litigation include those related to:

 ● Mental health records;

 ● Drug and alcohol abuse records;

 ● Attorney-client communication; and

 ● Work product.

SUBPOENAS

A person served with a subpoena can request a protective order if the subpoena seeks information 
that is privileged or otherwise objectionable. Tex. R. Civ. P. 176.6(e). DFPS has adopted detailed 
policy governing procedures for handling subpoenas served on individual staff or the agency. 
The DFPS subpoena policy is available on the DFPS website.

Practice  Tip: In addition to serving a subpoena on individual staff or the agency 
in  accordance  with  DFPS  policy,  parents’  and  children’s  attorneys  might  consider 
serving a copy on the attorney representing DFPS.

BUSINESS RECORDS

The Texas Rules of Evidence allow an exception to the hearsay rule for business records as long 
as they meet the requirements of Tex. R. Evid. 803(6) and they can be submitted without the 
testimony of the custodian of records or other qualified witness if accompanied by an affidavit 
that meets the requirements of Tex. R. Evid. 902(10).

Parent’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip:  When  seeking  documents  by  subpoena  from 
a  third  party,  such  as  a  hospital  or  other  medical  provider,  consider  including  a 
business  records  affidavit  along  with  the  subpoena  so  that  the  documents  may  be 
authenticated without live testimony. Be aware that the proponent of the documents 
must serve the documents and the accompanying affidavit pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. 
P. 21a on each party to the case at least 14 days before trial.

Parent’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip:  Some  medical  providers  may  file  motions  to 
quash subpoenas, so it may be necessary to have the court rule on the validity of the 
subpoena in order to obtain the records. If the requested records are those of a client 
or of the child of the client, consider having the client execute a release of information 
to obtain those records.

MOTION FOR ENFORCEMENT AND/OR TO COMPEL

Sanctions for abuse of the discovery process include orders denying discovery, imposing costs, 
finding facts established, limiting claims or defenses, striking pleadings, or dismissing an action 
and/or a contempt order for failure to comply with any order except orders to submit to a physical 
or mental examination.

28

Legal EssentialsPractice Tip: A remedy to the Motion for Enforcement or Contempt is usually the 
production of the discovery. The movant can wait until trial and then ask the Court 
to  grant  sanctions  for  failure  to  respond  to  discovery.  If  requested  information  is 
confidential, a hearing is necessary for such information to be released. Tex. Fam. 
Code  §  261.201(b)  sets  out  the  procedural  mechanism  to  request  the  disclosure  of 
confidential material.

Caselaw  on  Admitting  Discovery  Even  If  It  Was  Not  Properly 
Produced 

 ● Requests  for  Admissions  were  intended  to  “eliminat[e]  matters  about  which  there  is  no 
real controversy” and were “never intended to be used as a demand upon a plaintiff  or 
defendant to admit that he had no cause of action or ground of defense.” Stelly v. Papania, 
927 S.W.2d 620, 622  (Tex. 1996) (per curiam). Requests should be used as “a tool, not a 
trapdoor.”  Marino  v.  King,  355 S.W.3d 629, 632  (Tex.  2011). When a party uses deemed 
admissions to try to preclude presentation of the merits of a case, due process concerns 
arise. See TransAmerican Nat. Gas Corp. v. Powell, 811 S.W.2d 913, 917-18 (Tex. 1991). 
“Constitutional imperatives favor the determination of cases on their merits rather than 
on harmless procedural defaults.” Marino, 355 S.W.3d at 634. Absent flagrant bad faith or 
callous disregard for the rules, due process bars preclusive sanctions for discovery abuses. 
Wheeler v. Green, 157 S.W.3d 439, 443 (Tex. 2005).

 ● Parties can testify even if the parties were not disclosed as witnesses in discovery. In re 
J.L.J., 352 S.W.3d 536 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2011, no pet.) (mother who signed affidavit of 
relinquishment prior to final judgment was still a party to the suit and allowed to testify 
at trial against father). Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.6(a) expressly exempts parties from exclusion if 
not disclosed as a potential witness in discovery. In re M.J.M., 406 S.W.3d 292, 299 (Tex. 
App.—San Antonio 2013, no pet.) (holding the trial court erred in assessing death penalty 
sanctions, and noting, “Rule 193.6 expressly states that it does not apply to the testimony 
of named parties.”).

 ● The failure to timely make, amend, or supplement the discovery response did not unfairly 
surprise  or  unfairly  prejudice  the  other  parties.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 193.6(a)(2). In re M.F.D., 
No. 01-16-00295-CV (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Dec. 8, 2016, no pet.) (mem. op.) (The 
trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that there was a lack of unfair surprise 
or unfair prejudice when DFPS’ petition, a Status Hearing order, and service plan put the 
parent on notice that DFPS would seek termination if reunification could not be achieved.).

 ● Because the best interest of a child is of primary importance, the Third Court of Appeals 
has held that witnesses in a termination should be allowed to testify even if they were not 
disclosed in discovery. Spurck v. Tex. Dep’t of Family and Protective Servs., 396 S.W.3d 
205, 215 (Tex. App.—Austin 2013, no pet.).

Practice Tip: If a parent’s or child’s attorney did not timely make, amend, or supplement 
a discovery response, this may result in evidence being excluded. However, the following 
arguments  are  available  under  Tex.  R.  Civ.  P.  193.6  to  advocate  for  admitting  the 
evidence:

 ● Move for continuance and ask the court to allow more time to respond;
 ● Try to prove good cause for a failure to respond (i.e., clerical accident, mistake);

 ● Try to prove lack of unfair surprise and prejudice (no actual delay caused); and/

 ● Argue that sanctions are not to be used as a tool to preclude presentation of the 

or

merits.

OVERVIEW

Like procedural rules, evidentiary rules in DFPS cases also are the same as in other civil cases 
and are governed by the Texas Rules of Evidence. Tex. R. Evid. 901 provides, “to satisfy the 
requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of evidence, the proponent must produce 
evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what a proponent claims it is.”

Establishing a Child’s Competence to Testify

PRESUMPTION OF COMPETENCE

The Texas Rules of Evidence provide that every person is competent to be a witness unless the 
rules  provide  otherwise.  Generally,  a  child  is  presumed  to  be  competent  to  testify.  However, 
“persons lacking sufficient intellect” are incompetent to testify. A child may be one such witness, 
but a procedure must be followed to challenge the child’s competence. Accordingly, the burden  
is on the party challenging the child’s competence. Tex. R. Evid. 601(a).

The issue of the child’s competence must be raised by a party opposing the child’s testimony. 
At that point, the court must examine the child to assess whether the child “does not possess 
sufficient  intellect  to  relate  transactions  about  which  he  will  testify.”  In  doing  so,  the  court 
considers:

 ● The competence of the child to observe intelligently the events in question at the time of 

the occurrence;

 ● The child’s capacity to recollect the events;

 ● The child’s capacity to narrate the facts; and

 ● Whether the child lacks the capacity to understand the obligation of the oath. Pipkin v. 
Kroger Tex., L.P., 383 S.W.3d 655, 668 (Tex. App. – Houston [14th Dist.], pet denied). See 
also In Re R.M.T., 352 S.W.3d 12 (Tex. App. – Texarkana 2011, no pet.).

Practice Tip: To establish that a child has the capacity to understand the oath, the 
attorney needs to show that the child knows the difference between the truth and a 
lie (not that the child understands perjury). Rather than asking the child to define 
“truth” and “lie,” it is most developmentally effective to provide the child with simple 
examples of truth and lies. For example, “Sam, if someone told you that the judge’s 
robe is pink, would that be the truth or a lie?”

open court.

Hearsay Statement of Child Abuse Victim (“Outcry” statements) Tex. Fam. Code 
§104.006

 ● In a suit affecting the parent-child relationship, a statement made by a child 12 years of 
age or younger that describes alleged abuse against the child, without regard to whether 
the  statement  is  otherwise  inadmissible  as  hearsay,  is  admissible  as  evidence  if,  in  a 
hearing conducted outside the presence of the jury, the court finds that the time, content, 
and  circumstances  of  the  statement  provide  sufficient  indications  of  the  statement’s 
reliability; and

 ● The  child  testifies  or  is  available  to  testify  at  the  proceeding  in  court  or  in  any  other 

manner provided for by law; or

 ● The  court  determines  that  the  use  of  the  statement  in  lieu  of  the  child’s  testimony  is 

necessary to protect the welfare of the child.

 ● See, e.g., In the Interest of E.M., 494 S.W.3d 209 (App. Waco 2015)(focus is on the outcry 
statement itself, not the abuse; therapist testified outcry statements regarding domestic 
violence  between  the  parents  were  credible  because  they  were  expressed  in  a  manner 
consistent with what the therapist would expect, were made in age-appropriate language, 
were  consistent  through  different  placements,  and  were  not  of  the  type  this  aged  child 
would make up.)

Child’s Attorney Practice Tip: Note the age restrictions in some of the above rules 
and that some exceptions require a motion to be filed by the child’s attorney.

Legal EssentialsPreservation of Error
AT TRIAL OR IN A HEARING

Timely Objections Tex. R. App. P. 33.1

To preserve error, the party objecting to the admission of evidence must make a timely objection, 
a motion to strike from the record, and obtain a ruling on the record. Similarly, the proponent of 
excluded evidence must make an offer of proof setting forth the substance of the evidence.

Objections must be timely:

 ● Improper question: must object before an answer is given.

 ● Improper answer: objection must be made as soon as that fact becomes apparent. Although 
it is proper to object to a completed answer (and necessary in order to protect the record), 
this is not the most desirable solution. If the objection is sustained, ask that the answer be 
struck and that the jury be instructed to disregard it.

Practice Tip: Listen for possible leading questions on direct examination, questions 
that  call  for  a  narrative  response,  or  that  solicit  irrelevant  information.  After 
objecting, clearly but respectfully request to get a ruling on the record, especially if 
the Court does not respond directly to the request and instead says something like, 
“move along, Counsel,” etc. Without a ruling on the objection, the error may not be 
preserved for appeal.

Offer of Proof Tex. R. Evid. 103(a)(2)

An offer of proof preserves an argument regarding evidence by informing the appellate court 
what evidence was excluded by the trial court. Through an offer of proof, counsel can memorialize 
testimony excluded by the trial court. Exhibits not admitted into evidence should be marked 
and handed to the court’s reporter for inclusion in the record.

Practice Tip: Request to make an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury. On 
the record, state what the evidence is, and why it should be admitted; then ask the 
court to admit for the limited purpose of appeal. Evidence can be physical evidence or 
testimony that was objected to and excluded because the court sustained the objection.

Bill of Exception Tex. R. App. P. 33.2

Informs appellate court of evidence that was excluded at trial and therefore is not reflected in 
the record.

 ● Must obtain the trial court’s signature and must be filed with the trial court no later than 

30 days after notice of appeal is filed.

 ● The  document  must  be  specific  enough  to  make  the  trial  judge  aware  of  the  rulings  or 
actions which are the subject of the complaint, and which will be asserted on appeal.

 ● Must be presented to trial judge and opposing counsel.
 ● Can be agreed to by all parties or a hearing held to determine issues.

Practice Tip: A Bill of Exception is less common than an Offer of Proof but remains 
a method for obtaining review of a matter which is not reflected in the record.

37

Legal EssentialsAccelerated Appeals Tex. R. App. P. 28.1

Appeals  in  parental  termination  and  child  welfare  cases  (SAPCR  filed  by  DFPS  requesting 
managing conservatorship) are governed by rules of appellate procedure for accelerated appeals 
except as otherwise provided by Tex. R. App. P. 28.4.

 ● In an accelerated appeal, the notice of appeal must be filed within 20 days after the order 

of judgment is signed. Tex. R. App. P. 26.1(b).

 ● To perfect an accelerated appeal, the notice of the appeal must be filed in compliance with 
Tex. R. App. P. 25.1 within the time allowed by Tex. R. App. P. 26.1(b). Tex. R. App. P. 
28.1(b). Filing a motion for new trial, or other post-trial motion, or findings of fact will not 
extend the time to perfect an accelerated appeal.

Practice Tip: When arguing on the record, avoid using terms of art and acronyms 
(FBSS,  OV,  “dad  was  positive,”  etc.).  Avoid  terms  like  “ruled  out”  and  “unable  to 
determine”  etc.,  unless  an  explanation  for  what  those  terms  mean  is  provided. 
Attorneys should always strive to make the record very clear.

Expert Witnesses
ADMISSIBILITY

For expert testimony to be admissible, the court must be satisfied that three conditions are met:

 ● The witness qualifies as an expert;

 ● The subject matter of the testimony is an appropriate one for the expert’s testimony; and

 ● Admitting the expert testimony will assist the factfinder in deciding the case.

Even if the expert is qualified and the topic is a proper one for expert testimony, the proposed 
testimony must also be reliable and relevant. E.I. du Pont de Nemours v. Robinson, 923 S.W.2d 
549 (Tex. 1995). 

EVIDENTIARY RULES ON EXPERT WITNESSES

 ● Must be relevant. Tex. R. Evid. 401.

 ● Relevant evidence is generally admissible; irrelevant evidence is not. Tex. R. Evid. 402.

 ● Testimony by experts is specialized knowledge that will assist the trier of fact to determine 
a fact at issue. Expert testimony can be based upon knowledge, skill, training, or education 
and expert can testify in the form of an opinion. Tex. R. Evid. 702.

 ● Basis  of  opinion  by  expert  must be  underlying  data  or  facts  that  are  basis  of  opinion 
given to other party at or before hearing. Data must be of a type reasonably relied upon by 
experts in that particular field. Tex. R. Evid. 703.

 ● Qualified  experts  can  testify  to  their  opinion  as  to  the  ultimate  issue  (i.e.,  should 

parental rights be terminated?). Tex. R. Evid. 704.

 ● The  court acts as a gatekeeper to  determine  if  underlying  facts  or  data  are  sufficiently 
reliable  as  the  basis  for  the  opinion  testimony  (must  request  a  hearing).  Tex.  R.  Evid. 
705(c).

“DAUBERT CHALLENGE”

Hearing  to  determine  if  expert’s  opinion  is  based  upon  reliable  facts.  Burden  of  proof  is 
preponderance of the evidence. Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 
S.Ct. 2786 (1993); E.I. du Pont de Nemours v. Robinson, 923 S.W.2d 549 (Tex. 1995).

38

Legal EssentialsThe court must determine that:

 ● The expert’s field of expertise employs sound principles and methods;

 ● The expert’s opinion is based on sufficient facts or data; and

 ● The expert has applied the principles and methods in a reliable manner.

ROBINSON RELIABILITY FACTORS

 ● The extent to which the theory has been or can be tested;

 ● The  extent  to  which  the  technique  relies  upon  the  subjective  interpretation  of  the 

expert;

 ● Whether the theory has been subjected to peer review and/or publication;

 ● The technique’s potential rate of error;

 ● Whether the underlying theory or technique has been generally accepted as valid by the 

relevant scientific community; and

 ● The non-judicial uses which have been made of the theory or technique.

These factors are not exclusive factors, and the trial courts may consider other factors which 
are helpful to determining the reliability of the scientific evidence. E.I. du Pont de Nemours v. 
Robinson, 923 S.W.2d 549 (Tex. 1995).

 ● Have  you  attended  or  conducted  continuing  education  seminars,  conferences  and 

SAMPLE QUESTIONS ON EXPERT QUALIFICATION

 ● What is your occupation/profession?

 ● What is your educational background?

 ● What degrees, certificates, or licenses do you have?

related training?

 ● Are you a member in any professional organizations/societies?

 ● Have you received any awards or other professional recognition?

 ● Have you published articles in your field?

 ● How many cases involving [subject matter] have you handled?

 ● How many years have you worked in this field?

SAMPLE QUESTIONS ON NEED FOR EXPERT OPINION

 ● What is it about a brain injury/a burn injury/bite marks that requires an expert to explain?

 ● What  is  it  about  this  case  that  a  lay  person  with  no  background  in  this  field  might  not 

understand?

 ● What  are  the  key  principles  that  a  person  without  education  or  experience  in  this  field 

would need to grasp in order to understand this case?

 ● Can you explain the research/theoretical basis/scientific principles involved in this field of 

 ● Do you believe your testimony will aid the judge or jury in understanding the facts in this 

study to a non-expert?

case? How?

Practice Tip: Review criminal court cases for new law and/or science, as they tend 
to be reviewed more often than family law cases – i.e., arson and bite mark science 
has changed significantly  over time.

39

Legal EssentialsSAMPLE QUESTIONS ON BASIS FOR OPINION

 ● Have you examined or interviewed the child/parent/other person?

 ● Have  you  administered  any  medical  or  psychological  tests  to  the  child/parent/other 

person?

 ● Have you reviewed medical records/documents/police reports?

 ● Have you made a diagnosis/made a conclusion/formed an opinion?

 ● Did you rely on any other source of information in forming your opinion other than the 

medical records/documents/police reports that we have discussed?

 ● If so, what other sources did you rely on?

 ● If  the  facts  were  [supply  hypothetical]  could  you  render  an  opinion  regarding  cause  of 
injury;  whether  the  injury  was  intentional;  whether  the  injury  is  consistent  with  the 
parent’s report of the incident?

CROSS-EXAMINATION QUESTIONS OF THE OPPOSING EXPERT

 ● Has your theory been tested, or can it be tested?
 ● Does your technique rely on subjective interpretation?

 ● Has your theory been peer reviewed or publicized?

 ● What is the rate of error?

 ● Has your theory been generally accepted as valid by the relevant scientific community?

 ● Have there been any other non-judicial uses of your theory?

Drug Testing
Drug tests are commonly admitted into evidence through a parent (party) admission. Otherwise, 
for proper admission of drug test results, the source of the testing, the method used, and/or the 
circumstances or preparation of the test must indicate trustworthiness.

Error can be committed unless:

 ● The qualifications of the person conducting the test are admitted;

 ● There is testimony as to the type of test; and

 ● The expert shows that the test is standard and accepted for the substance tested.

Laying the proper foundation typically requires the testimony of three different people: a chain of 
custody witness, an expert to establish the reliability and proper techniques and testing protocol, 
and an expert to testify to the results.

Attempts to admit drug test results using a business records affidavit are subject to a hearsay 
objection. An expert witness must be present to prove up not only the testing protocol and chain 
of custody, but also the test results. See In re K.C.P., 142 S.W.3d 574, 580 (Tex. App.-Texarkana 
2004, no pet.). See also Philpot v. State, 897 S.W.2d 848, 852 (Tex. App.-Dallas 1995, pet. ref d).

Practice Tip: Consider filing a Motion to Exclude the drug test results if the proper 
foundation is not laid.

40

Legal EssentialsPractice  Tip:  Drug  testing  results  admitted  without  proper  foundation  are  not 
reversible error if the drug testing results come into evidence through other means 
(i.e., the parents testify to the use/admit to the probable results). DFPS may confront 
a parent with a positive test result, and if the parent admits to the use of the drugs 
confirmed in the test, then the fact of usage may not be an issue, but the specific drug 
and/or the amount used may still be at issue.

Practice Tip: In some circumstances, a client may fear being held criminally liable 
for admitting to drug use and may wish to assert their Fifth Amendment privilege 
against self-incrimination. However, there are important limitations on the privilege 
when it is asserted in a civil case and it is prudent to counsel the client regarding the 
benefits  and  drawbacks  of  asserting  the  Fifth  Amendment  prior  to  testimony.  See 
the Parents with an Open Criminal Case section of this tool kit for more information.

COMMON OBJECTIONS TO DRUG TESTING RESULTS

 ● Chain of custody;

 ● Hearsay; and

 ● Lack of proper foundation.

Legal EssentialsInvestigations & Alternatives to Removal of a Child

Federal  law  requires  that  the  Department  of  Family  and  Protective  Services  (DFPS)  make 
reasonable efforts consistent with child safety to prevent or eliminate the need for removing a 
child from a family’s home. Not all investigations and interactions with families lead to removal 
of children. Below are examples of alternative interventions in lieu of removal. The best legal 
alternative will depend on the facts of each case.

The Investigation Cannot Be Completed

COURT ORDER IN AID OF INVESTIGATION

If a person interferes with an investigation of a family, or DFPS cannot access the child or the 
child’s records, DFPS may petition a court to order the following on a showing of good cause:

 ● Access to a home, school, or any place where a child may be;

 ● A medical, psychological, or psychiatric exam (or to obtain the records of such an exam). Tex. 

Fam. Code §§ 261.303, 261.3031.

There is a Safety Issue, but the Family is Compliant 

SAFETY PLANS

A Safety Plan is defined by DFPS as a voluntary written agreement between DFPS and adult 
family members to address a specific threat to a child in the immediate or foreseeable future. 
The plan must be created with the family and be written in a practical, action-oriented manner 
and  acknowledge  a  family’s  network  of  support.  A  petition  for  legal  intervention  is  not  filed 
with  the  court,  and  no  court  orders  are  entered  in  association  with  a  Safety  Plan,  and  as  a 
result the plan is not legally binding. Safety plans are voluntary agreements, and a parent can 
revoke their agreement at any time. However, DFPS policy states if the family is unwilling to 
participate in a safety plan to address dangers to the child, the caseworker must determine if it 
is necessary to remove the child from the home. CPS Policy Handbook § 12651.

In a Safety Plan, a parent may agree to:

 ● Place  a  child  in  a  short-term  placement  outside  the  home,  (sometimes  referred  to  as 
a  Parent-Child  Safety  Placement  (PCSP),  until  the  safety  concern  in  the  home  can  be 
adequately addressed;

 ● Temporarily suspend or restrict visitation; and/or

 ● Submit to random drug testing requests.

ALTERNATIVE RESPONSE (AR)

The AR program was created to help families with low to moderate risk cases. In order to be 
considered for the program, all alleged child victims must be over the age of 6 and the intake 
must  have  received  a  designation  of  Priority  2  (P2).  In  an  AR  case,  no  final  disposition,  no 
alleged perpetrator, and no entry are made into the Central Registry. The goal is to provide a 
collaborative and non-judgmental environment to work with the family whose children are not in 
the managing conservatorship of DFPS to address concerns through protective services in order 
to prevent the need for further official intervention.

For more information, see the DFPS Alternative Response Resource Guide.

FAMILY-BASED SAFETY SERVICES (FBSS)

FBSS offers protective services to a family whose children are not in the managing conservatorship 
of DFPS in order to prevent the need to remove a child from the home. Participation in FBSS 
by a family is voluntary and is accompanied by a Safety Plan meant to sufficiently address the 
danger indicators or risk factors present that cause concern for child safety. Parents do not have 
to engage in or comply with the voluntary services. However, DFPS has the option of initiating 

43

Alternatives to Removalfurther legal intervention if it determines that the lack of compliance constitutes a danger to 
the child.

 
There is a Safety Issue, but the Family is not Compliant
COURT  ORDER  FOR  PARTICIPATION 
PARTICIPATE (COS/MTP)

IN  SERVICES/MOTION  TO 

If a family has refused services or is not voluntarily cooperating with services provided or funded 
by DFPS, DFPS can seek a court order to require a parent to participate in services designed 
to  alleviate  the  effects  of  abuse  or  neglect  or  to  reduce  the  reasonable  likelihood  of  abuse  or 
neglect in the immediate or foreseeable future. The services ordered by the court are provided 
by FBSS. A parent’s failure to comply with court-ordered services may lead to DFPS filing a 
petition to remove a child and may be offered as evidence. See CPS Policy Handbook § 2400 for 
more information on the relationship between FBSS and COS/MTP. See also, the Court-Ordered 
Services section of this tool kit.

There is a Need for an Alternative Placement 
PARENTAL CHILD SAFETY PLACEMENT (PCSP)

A  Parental  Child  Safety  Placement  (PCSP)  is  an  agreed  temporary  out-of-home  placement 
approved by DFPS made by a parent with a caregiver who is either related to the child or has a 
long-standing and significant relationship with the child or family. With a proper authorization 
agreement, a parent can give an adult caregiver of a child placed under a PCSP the authority 
to  take  action,  including  but  not  limited  to  medical  consent,  school  enrollment,  consent  for 
participation in school and sport events, applying for public benefits, and related authority. Tex. 
Fam. Code §§ 34.002, 34.0021. The PCSP expires in 60 days unless it is renewed by all parties.

For more information, see the DFPS PCSP Resource Guide found online.

The Parent Is a Victim Of Family Violence
ORDER  FOR  REMOVAL  OF  AN  ALLEGED  PERPETRATOR  (“KICK-OUT 
ORDER”)

It is well established that separating a child from their home and caregiver can be traumatizing. 
If  an  alleged  perpetrator  will  not  voluntarily  leave  the  home  and  if  the  remaining  parent  or 
caretaker of the child will make a reasonable effort to monitor and report any attempt by the 
alleged perpetrator to return to the home, a temporary restraining order could be used to remove 
the alleged perpetrator. It is a Class A Misdemeanor to violate this temporary restraining order. 
This order lasts for 14 days. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.1015. This timing allows a protective parent 
time to initiate a custody suit or seek a protective order.

Practice  Tip:  If  the  protection  of  the  child  requires  an  order  lasting  longer  than 
14 days, a protective order can be requested. (See section immediately below.) This 
requires a separate application to be filed instead of, or in addition to, the Kick-Out 
Order.

44

Alternatives to RemovalPractice Tip: If a client is uncertain whether to seek a protective order or a temporary 
restraining  order,  consider  filing  for  both  the  temporary  restraining  order  and  the 
protective  order  at  the  same  time  in  order  to  only  have  to  complete  service  on  the 
alleged perpetrator once. The protective order hearing can always be passed if it is 
not necessary, and the temporary restraining order expires in 14 days. Current law 
allows the temporary Ex Parte Protective Order to last up to 20 days with the ability 
to extend its duration for an additional 20 days at a time. Tex. Fam. Code § 83.002.

PROTECTIVE ORDERS

Domestic  violence  is  often  a  presenting  issue  in  child  welfare  cases.  If  a  parent  is  a  victim 
of domestic violence, parents’ attorneys may want to consider filing for a protective order on 
behalf of their client to help demonstrate their protective capacity. Children’s attorneys may 
also consider filing for a protective order if the child is a victim. 

Parent’s Attorney Practice Tip: The prosecuting attorney of the county (criminal 
district attorney or county attorney) will file the application for protective order at no 
cost on behalf of the applicant. If the prosecuting attorney is representing DFPS in a 
suit against the applicant, the prosecutor is not prohibited from filing the application, 
subject  to  the  Texas  Disciplinary  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct.  However,  the 
prosecutor’s  office  is  not  required  to  file  the  protective  order  if  they  find  it  to  be  a 
conflict or it does not meet their qualifications for filing. Advise a client to exercise 
caution in sharing information in applying for a protective order that might be used 
against them in a child welfare case.

Filing

Any  adult,  including  a  parent  or  guardian,  who  is  acting  on  behalf  of  a  victim  of  an  offense 
under Texas Penal Code §§ 20A.02, 20A.03, 21.02, 21.11, 22.011, 22.012, 42.072, or 43.05 may 
file an application for a protective order if the victim is younger than 18 years of age. Tex. Code 
of Crim. Pro. Art. 7B.001. 

Required Findings

A victim of family violence may be issued a protective order upon a finding that family violence 
has  occurred  and  is  likely  to  occur  again  in  the  future.  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §85.001.  Except  as 
otherwise provided by statute, a protective order is effective for the period stated in the order, 
not to exceed two years or, if not stated in the order, until the second anniversary of the date 
the order was issued. Tex. Fam. Code § 85.025.

Upon a finding that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant is the victim of 
sexual assault or abuse, indecent assault, stalking, or trafficking, a court shall issue a protective 
order including a statement of the required findings. Tex. Code of Crim. Pro. Art. 7B.003. An 
offender’s conviction of or placement on deferred adjudication community supervision for any of 
the above offenses constitutes reasonable grounds. Tex. Code of Crim. Pro. Art. 7B.003. 

Obtaining a protective order does not require proof of any visible marks or bruises and, in a 
hearing for a protective order, a statement made by a child 12 years old or younger describing 
alleged  family  violence  is  admissible  in  the  same  manner  as  provided  by  Tex.  Fam.  Code  § 
104.006. Tex. Fam. Code § 84.006.

45

Alternatives to RemovalIn  a  hearing  on  application  for  a  protective  order  under  Tex.  Code  of  Crim.  Pro.  Ch.  7B,  a 
statement that is made by a child younger than 14 years of age who is the victim of an offense 
under  Tex.  Penal  Code  §§  21.02,  21.11,  22.011,  22.012,  or  22.021  that  describes  the  offense 
committed  against  the  child  is  admissible  as  evidence  in  the  same  manner  that  a  child’s 
statement regarding the abuse against the child is admissible under Tex. Fam. Code § 104.006. 
Tex. Code of Crim. Pro. Art. 7B.004.

While  awaiting  a  protective  order  hearing,  temporary  ex  parte  orders  issued  prohibit  a 
respondent from doing certain acts (such as causing emotional and physical abuse of the child) 
or going near the child or residence. DFPS can file such orders alone or jointly with another 
protective person.

Ex Parte Orders

Duration

The temporary ex parte protective order may be issued for up to 20 days and may be extended 
for additional 20-day periods. Tex. Fam. Code § 83.002. After notice and hearing, a court may 
issue a protective order. A court may render a protective order sufficient to protect the applicant 
and members of the applicant’s family or household that is effective for more than two years if 
the court makes certain findings about the person who is the subject of the protective order. See 
Tex. Fam. Code § 85.025(a-1). Additionally, an application for protective order may be renewed. 
Tex. Fam. Code §§ 82.008, 82.0085.

A protective order issued under Tex. Code of Crim. Pro. Art. 7B.003, may be effective for the 
duration of the lives of the offender and victim or for any shorter period stated in the order. A 
parent or guardian may not file an application to rescind the protective order if the parent or 
guardian  is  the  alleged  offender  subject  to  the  protective  order.  Tex.  Code  of  Crim.  Pro.  Art. 
7B.007. 

The court shall issue a lifetime protective order if the offender is: 

 ● Convicted  of  or  placed  on  deferred  adjudication  community  supervision  for  an  offense 

listed in Tex. Code of Crim. Pro. Art 7B.001(a)(1); and

 ● Required to register for life as a sex offender under Tex. Code of Crim. Pro. Art. 62. Tex. 

Code of Crim. Pro. Art. 7B.007(a-1).

Enforcement

A violation of a protective order is a criminal offense. Tex. Fam. Code § 85.026; Tex. Code Crim. 
Pro. Art. 7B.006.

46

Alternatives to RemovalCourt-Ordered Services

Court-Ordered Services is also referred to as Required Participation or Motion to Participate.

Requirements for Filing a Petition
DFPS may file a suit in the county in which the child is located requesting the court to render a 
temporary order requiring the parent, managing conservator, guardian, or other member of the 
child’s household to participate in services for:

 ● Alleviating the effects of the abuse or neglect that has occurred;

 ● Reducing  a  continuing  danger  to  the  physical  health  or  safety  of  the  child  or  reducing 
a  substantial  risk  of  abuse  or  neglect  caused  by  an  act  or  failure  to  act  of  the  parent, 
managing conservator, guardian, or other member of the child’s household; and

 ● Permitting the child and any siblings of the child to receive services. Tex. Fam. Code § 

264.203(a).

and

The petition must be supported by a sworn affidavit by a person based on personal knowledge 
and stating facts sufficient to support a finding that:

 ● The child has been a victim of abuse or neglect or is at substantial risk of abuse or neglect; 

 ● There  is  a  continuing  danger  to  the  physical  health  or  safety  of  the  child  caused  by  an 
act or failure to act of the parent, managing conservator, guardian, or other member of 
the child’s household unless that person participates in services requested by DFPS. Tex. 
Fam. Code § 264.203(d).

Appointment of Counsel
Immediately  after  the  filing  of  a  petition  for  court-ordered  services  but  before  the  14-day 
hearing, the court must appoint counsel for the child(ren) and counsel for a parent for whom 
participation in services is requested. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(g) and (h). 

A parent who is indigent and appears in opposition to the motion has a right to a court-appointed 
attorney. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(i)(2). The court is not required to appoint an attorney for a 
parent who is not asked to participate in services or any non-parent who is asked to participate 
in services. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(h).

Parent’s Attorney Practice Tip: Attorneys should review and complete the affidavit 
of indigency with their client prior to the initial hearing. A completed affidavit can 
help avoid continuances or other delays in the client’s case. 

In  court-ordered  services  cases,  court-appointed  attorneys  for  children  have  the  powers  and 
duties under Tex. Fam. Code §§ 107.003 and 107.004 and court-appointed attorneys for parents 
have the powers and duties under Tex. Fam. Code § 107.0131.

If  a  parent  is  found  indigent,  the  court-appointed  attorney  may  continue  to  represent  the 
parent.  If  the  court  determines  that  a  parent  is  not  indigent  the  court  must  discharge  the 
attorney ad litem after the hearing and must order the parent to pay the cost of the attorney 
ad litem’s representation. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(j). The court may postpone any subsequent 
proceeding for up to seven days after discharge to allow the parent time to hire counsel. Tex. 
Fam. Code § 264.203(k).

Parent’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip:  Pursuant  to  Tex.  R.  Civ.  P.  131,  if  the  client 
prevails at the temporary orders hearing, court-appointed attorneys for parents who 
are determined not to be indigent might consider asking for a judgment against the 
Department in the amount of the cost for their court-appointed representation.

47

Alternatives to RemovalEx Parte Orders Prohibited
An order for required participation can be entered only after notice and a hearing. Tex. Fam. 
Code § 264.203(l). 

14 Day Hearing
The court must set a hearing no later than 14 days after the date the petition was filed unless 
the court finds good cause to extend that date for not more than 14 days. 

STATUTE 
Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(f), (m), and (n)

PURPOSE

To  determine  whether  the  family  is  in  need  of  services  to  address  allegations  of  abuse  and 
neglect and alleviate a continuing danger to the child. 

Evidence  sufficient  to  satisfy  a  person  of  ordinary  prudence  and  caution.  Tex.  Fam.  Code  § 
264.203(m).

STANDARD OF PROOF

REQUIRED SHOWING

At the conclusion of the hearing, the court must deny the petition unless the court finds: 

 ● An act or failure to act of the parent, managing conservator, guardian, or other member of 

the child’s household resulted in:

 ○ abuse or neglect of the child; or 

 ○ a substantial risk of abuse or neglect to the child; or 

 ○ continuing danger to the physical health or safety of the child; and 

 ● Services are necessary to ensure the physical health or safety of the child. Tex. Fam. Code 

§ 264.203(m).

COURT ACTION

Before the hearing begins, the court must inform each parent of their right to an attorney and 
to a court-appointed attorney, if indigent. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(i).

If DFPS meets their required showing, the court must:

 ● State its findings in the order;

 ● Make appropriate temporary orders under Chapter 105 necessary to ensure the safety of 

the child; and 

 ● Order the participation in specific services narrowly tailored to address the findings made 

by the court. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(n).

The court may not require a parent to participate in services if that parent/party did not cause 
the alleged abuse or neglect, the substantial risk of abuse or neglect, or the continuing danger 
to the child. 

Once  services  are  ordered,  a  parent  may  obtain  services  from  a  qualified  service  provider  of 
their own selection. After obtaining verification of completion of the service from the provider 
selected by the parent, DFPS must accept the verification as proof of successful completion of 
the service. However, if the parent selects their own provider, the parent is responsible for the 
cost of the services. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.2031.

Alternatives to RemovalAn order for required participation expires on the 180th day after the date the order is signed 
unless extended as provided by Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(r) or (s).

Safety Plans

A  family  in  in  a  court-ordered  services  case  may  already  have  a  Safety  Plan  with  DFPS  as 
part of the investigation or ongoing FBSS case and the status of the Safety Plan may become 
an issue in the court-ordered services case. (See the Investigations & Alternatives to Removal 
section of this tool kit for more information on DFPS Safety Plans.) 

The  court  is  not  authorized  to  incorporate  compliance  with  a  safety  plan  in  its  orders,  but 
the court may make its own orders regarding the child’s safety. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(n) 
provides  that  if  a  court  renders  an  order  granting  the  Department’s  petition  the  court  shall 
“make appropriate temporary orders under Chapter 105 necessary to ensure the safety of the 
child….”

Texas Family Code §105.001 provides that a court may make a temporary order, including the 
modification  of  a  prior  temporary  order,  for  the  safety  and  welfare  of  the  child,  including  an 
order: 

 ● For the temporary conservatorship of the child; 

 ● For the temporary support of the child; 

 ● Restraining a party from disturbing the peace of the child or another party; 

 ● Prohibiting a person from removing the child beyond a geographical area identified by the 

Court; or 

 ● For payment of reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses. 

Practice  Tip:  With  proper  notice  and  pleadings,  courts  may  temporarily  place  a 
child with another party and/or make other appropriate orders pursuant to Chapter 
105, provided the Court’s orders are necessary to ensure the safety of the child. These 
orders would be limited to 180 days pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(q) unless 
extended pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(r) or (s).

Review Hearings
The court must review the status of each person required to participate in services within 90 
days after the date the court renders the order. The court shall set subsequent review hearings 
every 90 days to review the continued need for the order.

STATUTE 
Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(p) 
PURPOSE

To review the continued need for the order.

Alternatives to RemovalParent’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip: Once a client has completed services, a motion 
for dismissal can be filed immediately rather than waiting to address the issue at the 
next statutorily required review hearing.

Extension
A court-ordered services case may be extended up to an additional 180 days from the original 
expiration date upon a showing by DFPS of a continuing need for the order, after notice and 
hearing. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203(r).

The Court may extend an order up to an additional 180 days only if the extension is requested 
by the person required to participate in services or that person’s attorney and the Court finds:

 ● The extension is necessary to allow the person time to complete ordered services; and

 ● The department made a good faith effort to timely provide the services to the person; and

 ● The person made a good faith effort to complete the services; and

Ex Parte Order Prior to Removal of Child
STATUTE 
Tex. Fam. Code § 262.102
PURPOSE
 

To determine whether a court will authorize in advance the removal of a child and grant TMC 
of the child to DFPS until an Adversary Hearing can be held.

Evidence sufficient to satisfy a person of ordinary prudence and caution.

STANDARD OF PROOF

BEST INTEREST

Best interest of the child is always the primary consideration in determining conservatorship, 
possession, and access. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002.

INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT (ICWA)

A court can order emergency removal of an “Indian child” only if necessary “to prevent imminent 
physical damage or harm to the child.” 25 C.F.R. § 23.113(d). This must be followed by a noticed 
hearing where DFPS must prove by clear and convincing evidence, including testimony from 
a Qualified Expert Witness (QEW), that a “foster care placement” is warranted. This hearing 
cannot be held until 10 days after notice of ICWA has been provided and is subject to a 20-day 
extension on request of a parent or Tribe.

Practice Tip: To avoid the need to continue the hearing, the best practice is for the 
hearing to be set at least 30 days out. Please see additional information in the Indian 
Child Welfare Act section of this tool kit.

REQUIRED SHOWING FOR EX PARTE ORDER BEFORE REMOVAL HEARING

DFPS must submit sufficient evidence to prove:

 ● Either an immediate danger to the physical health or safety of the child, or that the child 

has been a victim of neglect or sexual abuse;*

 ● That continuation in the home would be contrary to the child’s welfare; and

 ● That there is no time, consistent with the child’s physical health or safety and the nature 

of the emergency, to hold an Adversary Hearing; and

 ● That reasonable efforts, consistent with the circumstances and providing for the safety of 
the child, were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal. Note that reasonable 
efforts  to  prevent  removal  from  the  parent’s  custody  are  not  required  if  the  parent  has 
subjected the child to aggravated circumstances as defined by Tex. Fam. Code § 262.2015.

*This  determination  may  not  be  based  solely  on  the  opinion  of  a  medical  professional  under 
contract with DFPS who did not conduct a physical examination of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 
262.102(b-1).

DEFINITION OF “HOME”

The federal Administration for Children and Families defines “home” as the adult from whom 
the child is legally removed. In other words, home means parental custody, not physical location. 
The definition of “home” does not change regardless of where the child is living. 

61

Statutory HearingsCOURT ACTION

If the court finds that DFPS made the required showing, the court must:

 ● Issue an ex parte order for protection of the child;

 ● Appoint an attorney ad litem, a guardian ad litem, and authorized medical consenter for 

the child; and

 ● Set the Adversary Hearing within 14 days, unless the court finds good cause to postpone 

the hearing pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201.

Practice Tip: Attorneys for parents and children are not required to be appointed 
prior to the Ex Parte Hearing and their attendance is not required at the Ex Parte 
Hearing.  However,  in  some  circumstances  an  attorney  may  already  be  appointed 
when an Ex Parte Hearing occurs. This may occur if the attorney has been appointed 
as  part  of  a  Court  Ordered  Services  case  under  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  264.203  and  a 
new referral alleging abuse or neglect is the reason DFPS is seeking removal, or if 
DFPS is seeking to remove a child born during the pendency of an existing case filed 
under Chapter 262. If a parent’s or a child’s attorney is appointed or retained prior 
to  the  Ex  Parte  Hearing,  they  may  prepare  and  file  a  response  with  controverting 
affidavits and participate in the Ex Parte Hearing. The attorney should conduct an 
independent evaluation of the basis for the removal, rather than relying solely upon 
DFPS for information.

Ex Parte Order After Emergency Removal of Child Without a 
Court Order
STATUTES 
Tex. Fam. Code §§ 262.104, 262.105, 262.106, 262.107 
PURPOSE

There are limited circumstances when a DFPS caseworker, law enforcement officer, or juvenile 
probation officer may take possession of a child without a court order. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.104. 

DFPS must then file a petition and affidavit with the court no later than the next business day 
to make an ex parte request for TMC of the child until an Adversary Hearing can be held. Tex. 
Fam. Code 262.105.

The court must hold an Ex Parte Hearing on or before the first business day after the child is 
removed. Tex. Fam. Code 262.106.

DFPS must meet the required evidentiary showing for the court to grant emergency TMC. Tex.

REQUIRED  SHOWING  FOR  EX  PARTE  ORDER  AFTER  EMERGENCY 
REMOVAL WITHOUT A COURT ORDER

DFPS must submit sufficient evidence to prove:

 ● One of the following circumstances exist:

 ○ There is a continuing danger to the physical health or safety of the child; or 

 ○ That the child has been a victim of neglect or sexual abuse and is a substantial 

risk of future sexual abuse or trafficking; or

 ○ The parent’s use of a controlled substance constitutes an immediate danger to 

the physical health and safety of the child; or

 ○ The child has been permitted to remain on the premises used for the manufacture 

of methamphetamine; and

 ● That continuation in the home would be contrary to the child’s welfare; and

 ● That  reasonable  efforts,  consistent  with  the  circumstances  and  providing  for  the  safety 
of the child, were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal. Tex. Fam. Code §

 ● Appoint a person authorized to consent to medical care; and

 ● Set the Adversary Hearing within 14 days, unless the court finds good cause to postpone

Statutory HearingsAdversary Hearings

STATUTE 
Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201 
PURPOSE

TIMING

To determine whether a court will authorize continued TMC of a child to DFPS.

The hearing must be held not later than the 14th day after the date the child was taken into 
possession unless the court grants an extension. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201(a).

Evidence sufficient to satisfy a person of ordinary prudence and caution.

STANDARD OF PROOF

BEST INTEREST

The best interest of the child is always the primary consideration in determining conservatorship, 
possession, and access. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. At the Adversary Hearing, courts must place 
a child who is removed with a relative unless placement is not in the best interest of the child. 
Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201(n).

ICWA

The court must ask whether the child or family has Native American heritage and identify any 
Tribe  at  the  Adversary  Hearing.  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  262.201(f).  DFPS  must  give  notice  to  any 
identified Tribe and request that the Tribe confirm or deny the child’s status as an Indian child.

If a Tribe confirms (or a court finds) that a child is an “Indian child,” please see the Indian Child 
Welfare Act section of this tool kit for information on how ICWA requirements will affect the case 
going forward.

PARENT’S ATTORNEY PREPARATION

 ● File  any  pleadings  necessary  to  enable  the  court  to  enter  orders  in  accordance  with  the 

client’s wishes, including placement with a relative.

 ● Determine whether a court of continuing jurisdiction exists and whether ICWA applies to 

the child, even if the client is not the Indian parent.

 ● Determine if additional time is necessary to adequately prepare for the hearing and file 

any necessary motions for continuance.

 ● Determine whether appropriate relatives or fictive kin are able to care for the child and 

request home assessments be completed before the hearing.

 ● Determine  if  there  is  a  probable  or  pending  criminal  case  as  a  result  of  the  facts 
surrounding the DFPS case and advise the client of their Fifth Amendment right against 
self-incrimination in testifying at the hearing, discussing the case with other parties, and 
in participating in court-ordered or recommended services.

 ● Review and assess evidence.

 ● Meet with the parent in a confidential setting to review and assess the evidence together.

 ● Advise the parent of their right to a full contested adversary/evidentiary hearing on DFPS’ 

request for TMC.

 ● Determine if the client has any disabilities or special needs that must be accommodated in 

order to actively participate in the hearing.

 ● Determine if a language barrier exists.

 ● Determine whether domestic violence is an issue in the family, and whether it is known 

to DFPS.

64

Statutory Hearings ● Make a request of the prosecutor pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code § 262.014 to provide names of 
witnesses DFPS intends to call (other than DFPS employees), a copy of any offense report 
to be used to refresh a witness’s testimony, and a copy of any photo, video or recording to 
be presented as evidence; and subpoena any necessary witnesses and documents for the 
adversary/evidentiary hearing.

 ● Determine  what  options  may  exist  for  services  through  non-DFPS  providers  –  i.e.,  the 
client  is  participating  in  substance  abuse  treatment  through  probation,  mental  health 
services  through  county  or  private  providers,  domestic  violence  services  through  a  non- 
profit agency, etc.

 ● Determine whether the parent has other children who are not subject of the suit, or who live 

with the parent.

Parent’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip:  Your  parent  client  may  be  focused  exclusively 
on concerns for their children and the circumstances of removal and therefore may 
have difficulty understanding the long-term consequences of the decisions that they 
may be making at the outset of the case. The Trauma Informed Lens for Interacting 
with Clients section of this tool kit may be of assistance in helping discuss long-term 
implications of the Adversary Hearing.

Practice Tip: A contested Adversary Hearing may be appropriate if:

●  There  is  not  an  immediate  danger  to  the  child  –  i.e.,  DFPS  waited  a 
substantial period of time between the incident that forms the basis of the 
referral and the removal and circumstances have changed in the meantime 
that reduce or eliminate the danger.

●  DFPS did not make reasonable attempts to prevent or eliminate the need for 
removal – i.e., demand that the offending parent leave the home, place the 
child with a non-custodial parent, etc.

●  The non-custodial parent is suitable and placement with that parent would 

not be against the best interest of the child.

●  There is a suitable relative or fictive kin to care for the child but DFPS is 

opposed to the placement. 

●  Conservatorship  or  placement  are  not  contested  issues,  but  the  parent  is 
opposed  to  one  or  more  of  the  recommended  services  or  to  the  proposed 
visitation plan.

UNKNOWN OR ABSENT PARENT’S ATTORNEY PREPARATION

Determine whether the other parties know the identity and/or whereabouts of the parent. Note 
that when asked by DFPS for the address of the missing parent, the responding parent may say 
“I don’t know.” However, the responding parent may know where the family of the absent parent 
lives, or know how to get to their home, even if they do not know the exact address. Additionally, 
the responding parent may not want the other parent involved, but the parent’s attorney should 
explore why that is so and explain that for purposes of temporary orders, it might be preferable 
for the child to be with the other parent or their family rather than in foster care.

 ● Use due diligence to locate the client and submit a report to the court, stating either that 
the client has been located and provide the location information or that after due diligence 
the client could not be found. Make sure to report what efforts were made to locate the 
client.

65

Statutory Hearings ● If the parent is an alleged father, determine whether he is an acknowledged or adjudicated 
father and, if not, whether he wants to be adjudicated or is requesting paternity testing. 

Practice  Tip:  Attorneys  representing  a  father  whose  location  or  identity  are 
unknown  should  consider  asking  the  child’s  mother  whether  she  is  receiving 
child  support  or  benefits  such  as  Medicaid  or  food  stamps,  as  the  receipt  of 
benefits  may  trigger  the  filing  of  an  Office  of  the  Attorney  General  (OAG) 
paternity  suit.  The  existence  of  a  paternity  suit  may  provide  identity  and  contact 
information  for  a  father  whose  location  or  identity  are  currently  unknown. 

lso consider asking the child’s mother if she has ever been married and, if so, whether 
she  has  obtained  a  divorce  or  when  she  last  resided  with  her  husband.  Additional 
issues may arise, and genetic testing may be necessary if a presumed father exists 
and the alleged father wishes to be adjudicated as the father.

 A

CHILD’S ATTORNEY PREPARATION

 ● Visit  the  child  in  the  child’s  placement.  If  there  is  no  time  to  visit  the  child  before  the 

hearing, request a reset of the hearing in order to make the required visit;

 ● If possible, observe a parent-child visit;

 ● Interview the current caretakers, parents (if allowed by their attorneys), witnesses, and 

collaterals to be fully knowledgeable about the facts underlying the case;

 ● Review the rights and duties of a Guardian ad Litem and an Attorney ad Litem under  the 

Family Code;

 ● Consider all the recommendations that may apply to the parent’s attorneys, if appropriate, 
especially regarding locating absent parents and their relatives. If a parent  is  not  found 
until late in the case, it may be a lost opportunity to prevent the need for removal, identify 
family placement options, and can result in delays in permanency;

 ● Confer with the Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA), if they are appointed to the case, 
as they often have valuable information that can assist in the Attorney ad Litem’s knowledge 
of the larger case context. 

PARENT’S AND CHILD’S ATTORNEY PREPARATION

Review the Concurrent Issues, Child’s Attorney Issues, and Parent’s Attorney Issues sections of 
this tool kit to be prepared to advocate a position on:

 ● Paternity

 ● Placement of the Child

 ● Child Support and Kinship Support

 ● Visitation

 ● Child Well-Being

 ● Reasonable Efforts to Prevent or Eliminate Removal

Child’s Attorney Practice Tip: Upon meeting with and interviewing the child, the 
child may desire to attend court and meet with the judge at the Adversary Hearing. 
Because the child’s attendance is not required by statute, consider filing a Motion to 
Interview Child in Chambers and request that the court schedule a time for the child 
to  be  brought  to  the  courthouse  or  appear  remotely  prior  to  the  hearing    to  speak 
with the judge. This can permit the child to express their interests without having to 
testify in open court. Other parties might oppose this request so the AAL might want 
to be prepared to present a convincing argument to support the request.

66

Statutory HearingsREQUIRED COURT FINDINGS AT AN ADVERSARY HEARING 

Findings regarding the parent from whom the child was removed. Tex. Fam. 
Code § 262.201(g).

The court must return the child to the parent/conservator/guardian/custodian from whom the 
child was removed unless the court finds:

 ● There was a danger to the physical health or safety of the child which was caused by an 
act or failure to act of the person entitled to possession (that danger could include that the 
child would be a victim of trafficking under Tex. Penal Code §§ 20A.02 or 20A.03);

 ● That continuation in the home would be contrary to the child’s welfare;

 ● The  urgent  need  for  protection  required  immediate  removal  and  reasonable  efforts, 
consistent with the circumstances and providing for the safety of the child, were made to 
eliminate or prevent the child’s removal; and

 ● That reasonable efforts have been made to enable the child to return home, but there is a 

substantial risk of continuing danger to the child if the child is returned home. 

Findings regarding a parent not involved in the circumstances leading 
to removal. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201(g-1) 

If the court finds it is not safe to return the child to the parent from whom the child was removed, 
the  court  shall  consider  any  other  parent,  managing  conservator,  possessory  conservator, 
guardian, caretaker, or custodian as a possible placement.

If the court finds this person did not cause the immediate danger to the physical health or safety 
of the child or was not the perpetrator of the neglect or abuse alleged in the suit, the court shall 
order possession of the child by that person unless the court makes specific findings as to each 
person entitled to possession: 

 ● The  person  cannot  be  located  after  exercise  of  due  diligence  by  DFPS,  or  the  person  is 

unable or unwilling to take possession of the child; or

 ● Reasonable  efforts  have  been  made  to  enable  the  person’s  possession  of  the  child,  but 
possession by that person presents a continuing danger to the physical health or safety of 
the child caused by an act or failure to act of the person, including a danger that the child 
would be a victim of trafficking under Tex. Penal Code §§ 20A.02 or 20A.03. 

ADDITIONAL COURT ACTION

Upon making the necessary findings above, the court must enter temporary orders for protection 
and:

 ● Order placement of the child with a relative unless that is not in the child’s best interest. 

 ● Ask all parties about Native American heritage and the identity of any Tribe(s);

 ● Give parents warning about parental rights, require completion of the Child Placement 
Resources  form,  and  require  all  relatives  to  provide  information  to  locate  any  absent 
parent or relative;

 ● Set a Status Hearing within 60 days of the date TMC is granted;

 ● Inquire from all parties whether the child has had the opportunity to provide information 
regarding potential caregivers and whether individuals identified by the child are listed on 
the proposed child placement resources form; and

 ● Inform relatives serving as placement for a child of the ability to become a licensed foster 

parent and apply for Permanency Care Assistance (PCA).

67

Statutory HearingsRENEWING AND EXTENDING THE 14 DAY PERIOD

An Adversary Hearing must be held within 14 days because the temporary order authorizing 
emergency removal expires after 14 days in accordance with Tex. Fam. Code § 262.103. However, 
those orders can be extended before an Adversary Hearing is held. The temporary orders can be 
renewed and extended under the following circumstances:

 ● Upon a showing of good cause (defects in service, allowing time for the attorney for the 
child to visit with their client, court closure or docketing issues, etc.), an attorney can seek 
an order to extend the temporary order by up to 14 days and reschedule the hearing. Tex. 
R. Civ. P. 680;

 ● If an indigent parent appears in opposition to the suit and the court appoints an attorney, 
the temporary order can be extended by 7 days, and the court may shorten or lengthen the 
time of the extension if the parent and the appointed attorney agree in writing [emphasis 
added]. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201(e);

 ● If a non-indigent parent requests time to hire an attorney or to provide a retained attorney 
time to respond, the temporary order can be extended by 7 days, and the court may shorten or 
lengthen the time of the extension if the parent and the attorney agree in writing [emphasis 
added]. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.201(e-1);

 ● No  more  than  one  extension  of  a  temporary  order  may  be  granted  unless  subsequent 

extensions are unopposed. Tex. R. Civ. P. 680.

Practice  Tip:  Be  mindful  of  the  impact  of  separation  on  the  child  by  delaying 
the  Adversary  Hearing.  Request  a  reset  only  for  the  amount  of  time  necessary  to 
accomplish the required tasks instead defaulting to the maximum 14 days allowed 
under  the  Family  Code  and  consider  requesting  additional  visitation  time,  if 
appropriate, in the interim.

Practice  Tip:  Though  a  court  will  not  lose  jurisdiction  if  the  Adversary  Hearing 
is  delayed  or  reset,  a  parent  may  seek  mandamus  to  compel  the  court  to  hold  the 
hearing. In the Interest of J.M.C., 109 S.W.3d 591, 595 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2003).

Practice Tip: Consider addressing the following additional issues at the Adversary 
Hearing:

 ● Before the service plan can be fully developed and signed by a parent, there 
may be an identified need for psychological testing, drug assessment or testing, 
or physical examinations. Determine what orders might be appropriate and 
proceed accordingly.

 ● Determine whether there is a discovery control plan in place and/or whether 

there is a need for formal discovery.

 ● Consider requesting a scheduling order that sets out every future hearing.

Parent’s Attorney Practice Tip: Meet with the client after the hearing to discuss 
the Family Strengths and Needs Assessment (FSNA) and to explain what to expect 
between the Adversary Hearing and the Status Hearing.

any Tribe at the Status Hearing. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.202(f-1). DFPS must give notice to any 
identified Tribe and request that the Tribe confirm or deny the child’s status as an “Indian child.”

If a Tribe confirms (or a court finds) that a child is an “Indian child,” please see the Indian Child 
Welfare Act section of this tool kit for information on how ICWA requirements will affect the case 
going forward.

PARENT’S ATTORNEY PREPARATION

 ● Review the service plan with the client in advance of the hearing.

 ● Prepare for any modifications that will be requested in court.

Parent’s Attorney Practice Tip: Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(d) provides a defense 
against the “O” termination ground if a parent can prove by a preponderance of the 
evidence that they were unable to comply with the service plan, made a good faith 
effort,  and  that  failure  to  comply  was  not  attributable  to  any  fault  of  the  parent. 
Consider  filing  an  Answer  with  an  affirmative  defense  if  a  parent  was  unable  to 
comply with one or more services.

Parent’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip:  If  the  service  plan  drafted  by  DFPS  does  not 
reflect the services that were court-ordered, or do not address the client’s individual 
needs  or  preferred  service  provider,  consider  filing  a  written  objection  to  the  plan. 
If the court adopts the service plan as an order of the court, the parent will have to 
complete these tasks as well as those that were initially court-ordered so the plan 
should be comprehensive and individually tailored.

CHILD’S ATTORNEY PREPARATION

 ● Review the child’s plan of service and review with the client, if developmentally appropriate.

 ● Prepare any requested modifications to either the child’s or parent’s plan of service.

Statutory HearingsPARENT’S AND CHILD’S ATTORNEY PREPARATION

Review the Concurrent Issues, Child’s Attorney Issues, and Parent’s Attorney Issues sections of 
this tool kit to be prepared to advocate a position on:

 ● Placement of the Child

 ● Child Support and Kinship Support

 ● Visitation

 ● Child Well-Being

 ● Normalcy

Practice  Tip:  If DFPS has failed to set up services, provide parent-child visits or 
initiate and/or complete home studies, consider filing a motion to enforce the court 
orders that were entered at the Adversary Hearing rather than waiting for the next 
statutorily-required hearing. Filing a motion can create a sense of urgency to timely 
address issues that can delay reunification or permanency.

COURT ACTION

At the Status Hearing the court must:

 ● Assess  service  and  diligent  search  efforts  for  any  missing  parents  (including  alleged 

 ● Appoint counsel as required and advise unrepresented parents;

 ● Ask all parties about Native American heritage and the identity of any Tribe(s);

 ● Make specific findings and orders regarding visitation, service plan, medical consent (and 

psychotropic medications if prescribed);

 ● Set a Permanency Hearing no later than 180 days after TMC is granted;

 ● Determine whether the service plan is narrowly tailored to address specific issues identified 

fathers);

by DFPS;

 ● Allow the parents the opportunity to comment on the service plan;

 ● Inquire from all parties whether the child has had the opportunity to provide information 
regarding potential caregivers and whether individuals identified by the child are listed on 
the proposed child placement resources form; and

 ● Inform relatives serving as placement for a child of the ability to become a licensed foster 

parent and apply for PCA.

Practice Tip: If a client is seeking additional relief such as a contested placement 
change  that  will  require  a  hearing  separate  from  the  Status  Hearing,  the  most 
efficient way of obtaining a setting may be to file a motion for the requested relief and 
have it on file prior to the Status Hearing. Then request that a hearing be set on this 
motion at the same time as the Status Hearing while everyone is present in court.

Statutory HearingsPermanency Hearing Before Final Order

STATUTES 
Tex. Fam. Code §§ 263.002, 263.302, 263.304, 263.305, 263.306 
PURPOSE

Review status of the child and the permanency plan to ensure that the final hearing (trial on the 
merits) can be commenced before the dismissal date. 

STANDARD OF PROOF

Preponderance of the evidence.

BEST INTEREST
 

Best interest of the child is always the primary consideration in determining conservatorship, 
possession, and access. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.002. Also, best interest arises at the Permanency 
Hearings before a final order as follows:

 ● At each Permanency Hearing before a final hearing, the court shall make a finding on whether 
the child’s parents are willing and able to provide the child with a safe environment and 
whether the return of the child is in the child’s best interest. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.306(a-1)
(6). But see also Tex. Fam. Code § 263.002(c).

 ● The court shall consult with the child if the child is four years of age or older and if the court 

determines it is in the child’s best interest. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.302.

ICWA

Unless the court has made a finding that a child is not an “Indian child,” the court must continue 
to ask whether the child or family has Native American heritage and identify any Tribe, especially 
if new parties have appeared at this stage of the case. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.306(a-1)(3).

If a Tribe confirms (or a court finds) that a child is an “Indian child,” please see the Indian Child 
Welfare Act section of this tool kit for information on how ICWA requirements will affect the case 
going forward.

PARENT’S ATTORNEY PREPARATION

 ● Assess parent’s compliance and progress with temporary orders and the service plan.

 ● Assess whether there are services that need to be modified or eliminated.

 ● Assess  whether  the  parent  has  addressed  the  circumstances  that  endangered  the  child 
such that returning the child to the parents does not constitute a continuing danger to the 
child and that returning the child to the parent is not contrary to the child’s welfare. 

Parent’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip:  A  client  who  has  experienced  trauma  may  be 
making progress and appear healthy but then relapse into old patterns and behaviors. 
Changing  these  behaviors  takes  time  and  may  not  be  a  straightforward  or  linear 
process.  Targeted  trauma-informed  therapies  and  services  can  assist  a  client  in 
healing. It may be appropriate to ask the court to include trauma-informed therapies 
or services in the service plan to improve the likelihood for success.

71

Statutory HearingsPARENT’S AND CHILD’S ATTORNEY PREPARATION

Review the Concurrent Issues, Child’s Attorney Issues, and Parent’s Attorney Issues sections of 
this tool kit and be prepared to advocate a position on:

 ● Placement of the Child

 ● Visitation

 ● Child Well-Being

 ● Normalcy

 ● Reasonable Efforts to Return the Child Home 

Additionally, Parents’ and Children’s attorneys should address:

 ● What are the diligent search efforts for any missing parties?

 ● What is the permanency plan for the child?

 ● What is the factual basis for the permanency plan?

 ● Is the client in agreement or opposition with the permanency plan?

 ● Is mediation appropriate at this stage of the case?

CHILD’S ATTORNEY PREPARATION FOR CLIENT WHO MAY NOT ACHIEVE 
POSITIVE PERMANENCY

For a child whose permanency plan is Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA), 
consider:

 ● What is the child’s desired permanency outcome?

 ● Have the goals identified in the child’s permanency plan been addressed?

 ● Has the child had an Independent Living Skills (ILS) assessment done and what were the 

results? Are any further services needed as a result?

 ● If the child is 16 or older, determine whether the child has the original or certified copies 
of  personal  documents  (not  photocopies)  which  include  Texas  Identification  card,  birth 
certificate, Social Security card, and if child was not born in the United States, the child’s 
immigration  or  citizenship  documents  which  are  required  by  law.  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §§ 
264.121(e), 263.306(a-1)(5)(I)(v).

 ● If the child is 18 or older or has had the disabilities of minority removed, have original 
or  certified  copies  (not  photocopies)  of  personal  documents  been  delivered  to  the  client? 
Required  documents  include  Texas  Identification  card,  birth  certificate,  Social  Security 
card. Tex. Fam. Code §§264.121(e-1)-(e-2), 263.306(a-1)(5)(I)(vi).

 ● If the child was not born in the United States, determine whether DFPS has possession of 
the child’s immigration or citizenship documents and request they be turned over to the 
child.

Practice Tip: If mediation is appropriate and in the client’s interest at this stage of 
the case consider a motion requesting mediation. If another party objects to mediation, 
request that the court order mediation.

REQUIRED COURT ACTION

The court must:

 ● Order the return of the child to a parent unless the court finds that returning the child to 
that parent presents a continuing danger to the child and the return would be contrary to

72

Statutory Hearingsthe welfare of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.002(c); The order returning the child may 
be  a  monitored  return  under  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  263.403.  But  see  also  Tex.  Fam.  Code  § 
263.306(a-1)(6). 

 ● Identify  persons  and  parties  present,  review  the  status  of  service  of  process  and  search 
efforts, ask about Native American heritage and any Tribes the child is associated with, 
review  compliance  with  temporary  orders  and  service  plan,  as  well  as  progress  toward 
mitigating the need for foster care placement, and review DFPS efforts to provide the child 
with regular, ongoing opportunities to engage in normalcy activities;

 ● Review  the  permanency  plan  to  assess  each  component  (child  safety  and  well-being, 
necessity for placement, appropriateness of permanency goals, whether the child has had 
opportunity to express opinion on any medical care, compliance with specific requirements 
if psychotropic medications are prescribed, education issues, and transitional care issues);

 ● For a child with Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA):

 ○ a compelling reason why another plan is not in child’s best interest;

 ○ whether DFPS has conducted an Independent Living Skills (ILS) assessment;

 ○ whether  DFPS  has  addressed  the  goals  of  the  permanency  plan,  including  a 

housing plan and the results of the ILS assessment;

 ○ for youth 16 or older, whether DFPS has provided required documents per Tex. 

Fam. Code §§ 264.121(e)(1),263.306(a-1)(5)(H)(v);

 ○ for youth 18 or older, or youth with disabilities of minority removed, whether 
DFPS  has  provided  required  documents;  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §§  264.121(e-1), 
263.306(a-1)(5) (H)(vi); and

 ○ for  a  child  not  placed  with  a  relative  or  designated  caregiver,  review  the 
placement and include in its findings a statement whether the child is placed 
with a relative or designated caregiver. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.002(b);

 ● Estimate a likely date for the child to be returned, adopted, or placed in PMC;

 ● Retain jurisdiction and permit the child to transition home under a transition monitored 
return  while  the  parents  complete  services,  or  order  a  monitored  return  to  parents  if 
appropriate and in the child’s best interest;

 ● Set  a  subsequent  Permanency  Hearing  date  no  more  than  120  days  later  until  a  final 

order is rendered;

 ● Announce  in  open  court  the  automatic  dismissal  date  and  the  date  of  any  subsequent 

hearings. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.306(a-1);

 ● Inquire from all parties whether the child has had the opportunity to provide information 
regarding potential caregivers and whether individuals identified by the child are listed on 
the proposed child placement resources form; and

 ● Inform relatives serving as placement for a child of the ability to become a licensed foster 

parent and apply for PCA.

Practice Tip: If discovery has not already been served on opposing parties, it may be 
appropriate to begin the process now to ensure it can be completed in advance of trial. 
See the Discovery section of this tool kit for more information.

SUBSEQUENT PERMANENCY HEARINGS

A subsequent Permanency Hearing before entry of a final order must be held within 120 days 
of the previous Permanency Hearing in the suit (although it can be held sooner than 120 days). 
At such a hearing, the court reviews the progress of the parents, the status of the child, and the 
permanency goal.

73

Statutory HearingsDismissal Date Issues

CALCULATING THE AUTOMATIC DISMISSAL DATE

The dismissal clock begins to run on the date when the court first grants TMC to DFPS. Unless 
the court has commenced the trial on the merits by that dismissal date, with few exceptions, a 
SAPCR filed by DFPS is automatically dismissed on the first Monday after the first anniversary 
of the date the court rendered an order appointing DFPS as TMC. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.401(a).

Practice  Tip:  Pursuant  to  Tex.  Fam.  Code.  §  263.401,  the  dismissal  deadline  is 
automatic, and the court loses jurisdiction by operation of law if a trial is not commenced 
before the deadline date. A timely motion to dismiss the suit is not required.

From  the  date  DFPS  is  awarded  TMC,  the  viability  of  obtaining  a  final  order  in  the  allotted 
time  should  be  assessed  on  an  ongoing  basis.  Exceptions  to  the  one-year  dismissal  date  are 
extremely limited but are important to keep in mind as the lawsuit evolves, in case requesting 
an extension might be needed.

EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES

If the court finds that extraordinary circumstances necessitate the child remaining in the TMC 
of DFPS and that continuing the appointment of DFPS as the TMC is in the child’s best interest, 
the court may grant an extension of no more than 180 days. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.401(b).

 ● The court must consider a parent’s good faith attempt to complete a drug rehab program 

when granting an extension of the deadline.

 ● The court shall find that extraordinary circumstances exist if: 

 ○ a  parent  has  made  a  good  faith  effort  to  successfully  complete  the  service  plan  but 

needs additional time, and 

 ○ on completion of the service plan the court intends to order the child returned to the 

parent. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.401(b-3).

MONITORED RETURN OR TRANSITION MONITORED RETURN

Alternatively, the court may also retain jurisdiction and continue the TMC of DFPS and enter 
an order to:

 ● Return the child to the parent (a “monitored return”); or

 ● Transition the child to the home while the parent completes necessary services specified 
in  the  temporary  order  and  order  DFPS  to  remain  as  TMC  and  to  monitor  the  child’s 
placement (a “transition monitored return”).

In the case of a monitored return, the court shall schedule a new dismissal date 180 days after 
the monitored return is ordered, regardless of whether the deadline has been extended. Under 
the transition monitored return, the deadline is still extended by 180 days, and after the 180 
days, the court may retain jurisdiction for an additional six months for the parent to complete 
services  specified  in  the  temporary  order,  unless  the  court  has  already  granted  an  extension 
under Tex. Fam. Code § 263.401(b).

If a child must be removed from the parent’s home or the court terminates a transition order 
during this period, the court must set a new dismissal date no later than the original dismissal 
date or 180 days after the child is moved, whichever is later. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.403.

Practice Tip: An agreement by the parties to seek an extension does not constitute 
a  finding  of  extraordinary  circumstances.  Attorneys  might  exercise  caution  about 
relying on such an agreement, as the judge may still deny the extension if the court 
determines that extraordinary circumstances are not present.

74

Statutory HearingsTransition or Monitored Return Chart

75

Statutory HearingsPractice Tip: Waiting until the last minute to request an extension can risk the ire 
of the court. If there is no active trial setting before the original deadline and no time 
to  obtain  a  setting  when  the  request  for  the  extension  is  made,  the  court  can  only 
grant the extension or allow the case to be dismissed. The court may disagree that 
extraordinary circumstances are present but no longer has the discretion to order the 
case proceed to trial under the original deadline.

Practice Tip: An extension of the deadline under Tex. Fam. Code § 263.401 requires 
the court to find that extraordinary circumstances necessitate the child remaining in 
conservatorship of DFPS. Technical issues that prevent a trial from commencing such 
as lack of notice, lack of service, or lack of a trial setting may equate to extraordinary 
circumstances. If a client opposes the extension, consider challenging the sufficiency 
of the evidence for granting an extension based on extraordinary circumstances.

76

Statutory HearingsFinal Hearing

A Final Hearing (trial) must commence, or an extension must be granted, before the dismissal 
deadline  or  the  court  will  lose  jurisdiction  over  the  case  and  the  suit  will  be  automatically 
dismissed without a court order. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.401.

PURPOSE

To obtain a final order prior to the dismissal date.

STANDARD OF PROOF

If  termination  of  parental  rights  is  requested,  the  standard  of  proof  is  clear  and  convincing 
evidence.  If  PMC  is  requested,  the  standard  is  preponderance  of  the  evidence,  unless  ICWA 
applies, in which case the burden shifts to beyond a reasonable doubt and a Qualified Expert 
Witness (QEW) is required.

BEST INTEREST

The focus at a termination trial is on best interest factors (including, but not limited to: child’s 
age and physical and mental vulnerabilities, frequency and nature of out-of-home placements, 
history of abusive or assaultive conduct by the child’s family or other with access to home; history 
of substance abuse by child’s family or others with access to home; whether the perpetrator of 
the harm to child has been identified; and special considerations for children 16 years of age or 
older), as well as on the Holley factors. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.307; Holley v. Adams, 544 S. W. 2d 
367 (Tex. 1976). DFPS must prove at least one ground for termination plus that termination of 
parental rights is in the child’s best interest. Please see the Best Interest section in this tool kit 
for more information.

ICWA

If  ICWA  applies,  termination  of  parental  rights  requires  proof  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt, 
including qualified testimony of a QEW, that the parent’s continued custody “is likely to result in 
serious emotional or physical damage to the child.” 25 U.S.C. § 1912(f). DFPS must demonstrate 
that “active efforts” were made to reunify, as well as other requirements. Please see the Indian 
Child Welfare Act section in this tool kit for more information.

PREPARATION FOR A CONTESTED TRIAL

The preparation required for a contested trial varies greatly depending on the relief requested, 
the  evidence,  and  whether  a  jury  is  requested.  The  practice  tips  below  outline  some  general 
principles that attorneys for parents and children may consider when approaching a contested 
trial. Attorneys should seek additional materials, resources, and training to ensure adequate 
preparation.

Parent’s Attorney Practice Tip: A parent’s attorney should work with their client 
in the months leading up to trial to answer discovery so that all necessary witnesses 
may be called, and all necessary exhibits may be admitted. All service providers and 
any other witnesses the client wants to call to testify at trial should be interviewed. 
An  attorney  should  discuss  with  their  client  the  burden  of  proof  required,  the 
anticipated evidence from all parties, and any alternative relief requested. Attorneys 
should prepare their clients to testify on both direct and cross examination.

77

Statutory HearingsChild’s Attorney Practice Tip: A child’s attorney should not rely on the prosecutor 
and  parents’  attorneys  to  call  witnesses  and  submit  evidence  relevant  to  their 
client’s interests. A child’s attorney should be prepared to call their own witnesses 
and  introduce  their  own  exhibits.  If  aligned  with  one  party,  the  attorney  should 
collaborate with that party on trial strategy and issue subpoenas for witnesses and 
exhibits that will advance the client’s interests at trial. If the case is being tried to a 
jury, an attorney could request strikes separate from other parties, but be aware the 
court may require aligned parties to share strikes. During voir dire, it is essential 
that the panel understands the independent role of the child’s attorney and develops 
trust  in  the  attorney  so  that  they  are  prepared  to  act  on  the  ad  litem  attorney’s 
recommendations.  A  child’s  attorney  should  have  pleadings  on  file  to  seek  relief 
requested on behalf of the child that is not sought by another party.

Practice Tip: When making a record, it is helpful to avoid terms of art or acronyms 
and  to  remember  the  basics  of  examining  a  witness  (e.g.,  identify  all  witnesses  in 
the record and their relationship to the case). If examining the caseworker(s), it is 
important to establish their relationship to the case, and the basis of their knowledge 
about it (how long have they been working on the case, etc.).

PREPARATION FOR AN AGREED OR DEFAULT FINAL ORDER

Termination of Parental Rights

Requires evidence of at least one ground for termination of parental rights against a parent and 
evidence that termination is in the best interest of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b).

Appointment of DFPS as PMC

The appointment of DFPS as a child’s permanent managing conservator without termination of 
parental rights is only appropriate if a more permanent option for a child is not possible. This 
requires evidence that:

 ● Appointment of a parent as managing conservator would not be in the child’s best interest 
because it would significantly impair the child’s physical health or emotional development; 
and

 ● It  would  not  be  in  the  child’s  best  interest  to  appoint  a  relative  or  another  person  as 

managing conservator.

In  making  this  determination,  the  court  shall  consider:

 ● That the child will be 18 years old in less than three years, 

 ● The  child  is  12  or  older  and  has  expressed  a  strong  desire  against  termination  and 

continuously expressed a strong desire against being adopted, and 

 ● The needs and desires of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.404.

Transition Plan Requirements for Certain Youth

As part of the Final Hearing, the court must verify the following for any child who goes into PMC 
of DFPS and who has an APPLA:

 ● If  the  child  is  14  or  older:  that  DFPS  has  conducted  an  independent  living  skills  (ILS) 
assessment  for  the  child  as  provided  under  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  264.121(a-3);  that  DFPS 
has  addressed  the  goals  identified  in  the  child’s  permanency  plan,  including  the  child’s 
housing plan, and the results of the ILS assessment;

78

Statutory Hearings ● If the child is 16 or older: that there is evidence that DFPS has provided the youth with the 

documents and information listed in Tex. Fam. Code § 264.121(e); and

 ● If  the  child  is  18  or  older  or  has  had  the  disabilities  of  minority  removed:  that  there  is 
evidence that DFPS has provided the youth with the documents and information listed in 
Tex. Fam. Code § 264.121(e-1). Tex. Fam. Code § 263.4041.

Entering a Default Judgment

A default judgment must conform to the pleadings served on the Respondent. The record must 
show:

 ● Service of citation, no Answer, and the Citation Return on file at least 10 days before trial;

 ● An order appointing an attorney ad litem for the absent parent, if appointment of counsel 

is mandatory;

 ● If  the  judgement  seeks  termination  against  one  or  both  parents,  evidence  to  support  at 
least  one  of  the  termination  grounds  plead  and  that  termination  is  in  the  child’s  best 
interest;

 ● A “statement of the evidence” approved and signed by the judge which should demonstrate 

the diligence used to locate the defendant if citation by publication was requested;

 ● Proof  of  compliance  with  the  Servicemembers  Civil  Relief  Act  (SCRA)  (please  see 

Servicemembers Civil Relief Act section in this tool kit for more information); and

 ● For an alleged father, evidence that the alleged father has not registered his paternity or 

filed a paternity action or an admission of paternity.

Entering Agreed Orders

Agreed  Final  Orders  can  be  entered  by  a  court  when  all  parties  have  reached  agreement, 
typically achieved during a settlement conference or in mediation. The order must provide for 
the  permanency  of  the  children,  whether  this  be  to  return  home,  to  be  placed  permanently 
with a relative as managing conservator, or voluntary relinquishment of parental rights and 
awarding PMC to DFPS.

Practice Tip: Elicit testimony on best interest for both prove-ups and agreed orders. 
The  testimony  should  be  specific  to  the  child  and  sufficient  to  meet  the  burden  of 
proof, not merely a yes or no answer. Agreed orders should be dictated into the record 
and reflected in the final order. If there is a mediated settlement agreement, consider 
attaching a copy of it to the final order.

Practice Tip: Attorneys for parents and children should consider the following issues 
before entering a final order dismissing DFPS as conservator:

 ● Is there a court of continuing jurisdiction?

 ● Is there a prior order establishing a parent-child relationship?

 ● Are  there  multiple  prior  orders  regarding  different  children  that  should  be 

consolidated?

 ● Has child support for each child  from each party been addressed?

 ● Has medical insurance and dental insurance been addressed for each child?

 ● Has visitation between each child and each conservator been established and is 

the language specific enough to be enforceable later, if needed?

79

Statutory HearingsCOURT ACTION

The  court  may  terminate  parental  rights  on  one  or  more  grounds  and/or  name  a  permanent 
managing conservator for the child.

If PMC is awarded to DFPS, the court must set a date for the next hearing as follows:

 ● If DFPS was granted PMC and parental rights were terminated, the court must conduct 
the initial Permanency Hearing After Final Order within 90 days of the Final Order and 
hold  subsequent  hearings  at  least  once  every  six  months  until  the  child  is  adopted  or 
DFPS is no longer the conservator. 

 ● If  DFPS  was  granted  PMC  and  parental  rights  were  not  terminated,  the  court  must 
conduct  a  Permanency  Hearing  After  Final  Order  at  least  once  every  six  months  until 
DFPS is no longer the conservator.

Child’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip:  An  attorney  for  a  child  in  PMC  may  request 
Permanency  Hearings  more  frequently  than  every  six  months.  More  frequent 
hearings  may  be  especially  important  for  children  in  PMC  who  do  not  yet  have  a 
finalized permanency plan or are not in permanent family placement.

AFTER THE COURT RENDERS A FINAL ORDER

Be aware of strict time limits for any challenge:

 ● De Novo Hearing: If an associate judge presided over the final trial, a request for De Novo 
Hearing must be filed with the clerk of the referring court no later than the third working 
day after receiving notice of the substance of the associate judge’s order; and

 ● Accelerated Appeal: An accelerated appeal must be filed within 20 days after the judgment 
or order is signed, subject to a possible 15-day extension. Parents’ attorneys should notify 
their clients in writing before and after a trial of their right to appeal.

 ● Motion for New Trial: If the client wants to appeal a final judgment, a Motion for New Trial 
may be necessary to preserve error. A Motion for New Trial is required to preserve error 
regarding the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence, and to raise issues of ineffective 
assistance of counsel or newly discovered evidence. A Motion for New Trial may also be 
required to preserve error regarding the legal sufficiency of the evidence or incurable jury 
argument if those errors were not preserved at trial.

SEEKING APPOINTMENT OF APPELLATE COUNSEL

The  appointment  of  a  parent’s  attorney  continues  until  the  case  is  dismissed,  the  date  all 
appeals  are  exhausted  or  waived,  or  the  date  on  which  the  attorney  is  replaced  by  another 
attorney. Tex. Fam. Code § 107.016(2). If a client wishes to appeal the trial court’s decision, but the 
parent’s attorney does not have experience in the appeal process for parental termination cases, 
the attorney can request new counsel be appointed but must continue to take active steps to 
preserve the client’s right to appeal. In this situation the attorney should:

 ● Notify  the  client  of  right  to  appeal  and  provide  the  client  with  information  regarding 

deadlines and time-sensitive nature of the case;

 ● File  a  Motion  for  Discharge  of  Trial  Attorney  and  Motion  for  Appointment  of  Appellate 
Attorney,  immediately  upon  being  notified  that  the  client  wishes  to  appeal  if  notified 
within the time allowed for appeal;

 ● File Notice of Appeal with the District Clerk’s office to perfect the appeal process;

 ● Notify  the  court  coordinator  that  the  Motion  has  been  filed,  due  to  the  time-sensitive 

nature of the appeal;

80

Statutory Hearings ● Obtain an Order of Appointment of Appellate Counsel from the court;

 ● Notify  the  appellate  counsel  of  appointment  by  email  and  phone  call,  due  to  the  time-

sensitive nature of the case;

 ● Provide appellate counsel with the name and contact information for the client; and

 ● Notify the client with the name and contact information for the appellate counsel.

Parent’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip:  If  the  client  requests  an  appeal,  consider 
requesting visitation pending the appeal. If the case is reversed and rendered, and 
no visits have been occurring, the transition may be very confusing or traumatic to a 
child who may not have seen their parent in many months.

Statutory HearingsPermanency Hearing After Final Order

STATUTES 
Tex. Fam. Code §§ 263.002, 263.501, 263.5031, 264.121 
PURPOSE

To review the status of every child in PMC at least once every six months until DFPS is no longer 
the child’s permanent managing conservator (unless parental rights are terminated, when the 
first Permanency Hearing must be no later than 90 days after the date of the order terminating 
parental rights).

BURDEN OF PROOF

Preponderance of the evidence. 

CHILD’S ATTORNEY PREPARATION

 ● If parental rights have been terminated, and the child is in their intended adoptive home, 

ensure that all steps are being taken to consummate the adoption.

 ● Determine whether the child is eligible for an adoption subsidy and ensure that the proper 
procedures  are  followed  to  obtain  the  subsidy;  if  this  is  not  occurring,  ask  the  court  to 
direct DFPS to assist the family in obtaining a subsidy.

 ● If  parental  rights  have  been  terminated,  but  the  child  is  not  in  a  prospective  adoptive 
home, advocate for recruitment efforts to identify such a home and request the court order 
DFPS to prioritize finding an adoptive home for the child. If there is a DFPS unit in the 
same county in which the case is currently filed which specializes in adoption preparation 
and recruitment, request that the child’s case be transferred to that unit.

 ● Revisit the client’s family members to inquire about placement and/or adoption. It may 
be that a relative was unable or unwilling to take the child in during the TMC phase, but 
circumstances may have changed to such a degree that placement is now viable. Adoption 
subsidy eligibility or PCA may make placement with family possible. With teenage clients, 
be knowledgeable about assistance to the family that may extend beyond age 18.

 ● For children who are likely to age out of foster care, attend all meetings related to planning 
for adulthood and be prepared to update the court and/or ask for additional services.

 ● Monitor the progress of DFPS in getting the child’s documents, scheduling preparation for 

adult living classes, and helping the child in accessing their benefits.

 ● Be familiar with the benefits available to youth aging out of foster care. There are numerous 
resources available online including on the DFPS and Children’s Commission websites.

 ● If CASA is assigned to the case, maintain contact with the CASA and supervisor, as they 
may have more frequent contact with the child and are often willing to research benefits, 
education-related assistance, and potential relatives.

 ● Review the Concurrent Issues and Child’s Attorney Issues section of this tool kit and be 

prepared to advocate a position on:

 ○ Placement of the Child

 ○ Child Well-Being

 ○ Normalcy

82

Statutory HearingsChild’s Attorney Practice Tip: Children who are in long-term foster care may be 
at  increased  risk  to  experience  the  juvenile  justice  system,  adult  criminal  justice 
system, and/or immigration system, as well as school discipline and mental health 
challenges.  To  represent  a  multi-system  client  effectively,  a  child’s  attorney  must 
have a working knowledge of these systems. If necessary, an attorney may petition 
the court to appoint a co-attorney for the specific purpose of addressing some of these 
issues. The addition of an attorney with specialized knowledge can be very helpful 
to the youth. Additionally, DFPS has state and regional specialists who can assist in 
areas such as education, disabilities, juvenile justice, and immigration.

COURT ACTION:

The court must:

 ● Identify  persons  and  parties  present,  review  DFPS  efforts  to  give  required  notice,  and 
review DFPS efforts to provide the child with regular, ongoing opportunities to engage in 
normalcy activities;

 ● Inquire from all parties whether the child has had the opportunity to provide information 
regarding potential caregivers and whether individuals identified by the child are listed on 
the proposed child placement resources form;

 ● Inform relative(s) serving as placement for a child of the ability to become a licensed foster 

parent and apply for PCA;

 ● Review the permanency progress report to assess:

 ○ child  safety  and  well-being  (including  whether  any  medical  or  special  needs  are 

being met);

 ○ whether  the  child  is  placed  with  a  relative  or  designated  caregiver,  and  the 
continuing necessity for and appropriateness of the placement (including whether 
an out-of- state placement is in the child’s best interest);

 ○ for  a  child  who  is  placed  in  institutional  care,  whether  it  is  the  least  restrictive 

environment consistent with the child’s best interest;

 ○ the  appropriateness  of  concurrent  permanency  goals,  and  whether  DFPS  made 
reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan, and exercised due diligence:

 ○ whether to place a child for adoption if parental rights are terminated, or

 ○ whether  to  find  another  permanency  placement  (including  relative  or  return  to 

parent) if appropriate;

 ○ for a child with a goal of  APPLA:

•  ask the child regarding their desired permanency outcome;

•  determine  whether  APPLA  is  the  best  plan  and  provide  a  compelling  reason 

why another plan is not in the child’s best interest;

•  determine whether DFPS has conducted an ILS assessment;

•  determine  whether  DFPS  has  addressed  the  goals  of  the  permanency  plan, 

including a housing plan and the results of the ILS assessment;

• 

for youth age 16 or older, determine whether DFPS has provided the original 
or certified copies of personal documents (not photocopies) which include Texas 
Identification card, birth certificate, Social Security card, and if child was not 
born in the United States, their immigration or citizenship documents.

83

Statutory Hearings• 

for youth age 18 or older, or with disabilities of minority removed, determine 
whether DFPS has provided the original or certified copies of personal documents 
(not photocopies) which include Texas Identification card, birth certificate, Social 
Security card, and if child was not born in the United States, their immigration 
or citizenship documents.

 ○ determine whether transition services are needed for children age 14 or older;

 ○ review  the  appropriateness  of  medical  care,  whether  the  child  has  had  an 
opportunity to express an opinion on any medical care, and compliance with specific 
requirements if psychotropic medications are prescribed;

 ○ determine whether an education decision-maker has been appointed and whether 

school issues have been addressed;

 ○ if  the  child  is  in  PMC  of  DFPS  and  parental  rights  have  not  been  terminated, 
determine whether to order up to six months of additional services for the parents 
if a relative or other person is not seeking PMC;

 ○ determine  whether  DFPS  has  identified  a  family  or  other  caring  adult  who  has 

made a permanent commitment to the child; and

 ○ set another hearing in six months or sooner.

Child’s Attorney Practice Tip: At the first hearing after termination, be aware of 
whether a relative has filed an original suit or a motion to modify as allowed by the 
Tex. Fam. Code § 102.006(c). If so, explore whether the relative would be a suitable 
placement. If a client is opposed to the relative (or when serving as the child’s attorney 
and guardian ad litem, the GAL determines that the suit would not be in the child’s 
best  interest),  determine  whether  they  qualify  by  degree  of  consanguinity.  If  not, 
consider filing a motion to dismiss the suit.

Child’s Attorney Practice Tip: If DFPS does not seem to be making progress toward 
an  adoption,  request  a  review  hearing  sooner  than  the  next  statutory  permanency 
hearing, and consider filing a motion to ask the court to order DFPS to complete tasks 
within specific deadlines.

84

Statutory HearingsReasonable Efforts

DFPS  is  required  to  make  reasonable  efforts  to  prevent  the  need  for  removal  of  the  child. 
Additionally,  if  removal  is  authorized,  DFPS  is  required  to  make  reasonable  efforts  to  safely 
return the child home. Although there is no definitive list of what constitutes reasonable efforts, 
the questions below are modified from the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges 
Enhanced Resource Guidelines and are designed to elicit suggested elements of what could be 
considered reasonable efforts throughout the case.

Questions for Reasonable Efforts to Avoid Removal

 ● What were the specific safety risks leading to removal?

 ● What services were considered and offered to allow the child to remain in the home? Were 
those services culturally appropriate? Were they rationally related to the safety risk? Did 
they take into account the family’s strengths and needs?

 ● What was done to create a safety plan to allow the child to remain at home or with another 

designated caregiver without requiring court involvement?

 ● Would  the  removal  of  a  person  from  the  home  have  allowed  the  child  to  safely  remain 

home?

 ● Would the addition of a person to the home have allowed the child to safely remain home?

 ● Was the family offered the opportunity to participate in the Alternative Response Program 
or Family-Based Safety Services? If so, why was Alternative Response or Family Based 
Safety Services unsuccessful?

 ● Was  the  family  ordered  to  participate  in  Court-Ordered  Services  (COS)?  If  so,  why  was 

COS unsuccessful?

 ● Were non-custodial parents, paternal and maternal relatives identified and evaluated?

 ● Were there any pre-hearing conferences such as a Family Team Meeting or Family Group 

Conference? Who was there? What was the outcome?

 ● Does the family have a history with DFPS? Did the history influence DFPS’ response to 

this situation?

 ● Are there orders that could be made under Tex. Fam. Code § 264.203 that would require the 

parents to participate in services but allow the child to remain safely in the home?

Questions for Reasonable Efforts to Allow the Child to Return Home

 ● What is preventing this child from safely going home today?

 ● What is the current immediate safety threat?

 ● What  type  of  safety  plan  could  be  developed  and  implemented  in  order  for  the  child  to 

return home today?

 ● What  specifically  is  preventing  the  parents  from  being  able  to  provide  the  minimally 

adequate standard of protective care?

 ● Will the removal of a person from the home allow the child to safely return home?

 ● Will the addition of a person to the home allow the child to safely return home?

 ● Is a monitored return or a transition monitored return appropriate? If not, why not?

 ● If the safety threat is too high, do the parents understand what conditions are required for 

the child to safely return?

 ● What services can be arranged to allow the child to safely go home today?

 ● How are the services rationally related to the specific safety threat?

 ● How is the family, including children and extended family, engaged in the development 

and implementation of the services?

 ● What efforts has DFPS made to assist the family with services?

85

Concurrent Issues ● Does the family believe the services take into account the family’s strengths and needs?

 ● Has the family asked for additional or alternative services?

 ● What evidence has DFPS provided that the services meet the needs of the family and have 

produced positive outcomes for families with similar issues?

 ● How are the services specifically tailored to the culture and needs of this child and this 

family?

The Impact of Reasonable Efforts on Federal Funding
If the court fails to make a reasonable efforts finding or finds that reasonable efforts were not 
made, it could impact the total amount of federal Title IV-E reimbursement received by DFPS; 
however, it does not affect funding for the individual child, the subject of the suit. 

REASONABLE EFFORTS TO PREVENT REMOVAL

Finding must be made within 60 days of the child’s removal. 45 C.F.R. § 1356.21(b)(1)(i).

If the court does not make the finding, the agency will not receive IV-E dollars for the duration 
of the child’s stay in foster care. 45 C.F.R. § 1356.21 (b)(1)(ii). 

REASONABLE EFFORTS TO FINALIZE PERMANENCY

Finding must be made within 12 months of foster care entry and at least once every 12 months 
thereafter. 45 C.F.R. § 1356.21(b)(2)(i).

If the court does not make the finding, the agency will not receive IV-E funding until such a 
determination is made. 45 C.F.R. § 1356.21(b)(2)(ii).

Concurrent IssuesPlacement

Attorneys for parents and children should be prepared to address the following issues regarding 
a child’s placement.

Placement Appropriateness

 ● Is the current placement the least restrictive and most family-like setting for the child?

 ● Is the placement culturally and linguistically appropriate?

 ● Is the child or the parent requesting a placement change?

Placement Preferences
DFPS is required to give preference to persons in the following order:

 ● A person related to the child by blood, marriage, or adoption;

 ● A person with whom the child has a long-standing and significant relationship;

 ● A foster home; 

 ● A general residential operation. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.114(d).

If  the  child  has  previously  been  in  a  foster  home  under  DFPS  conservatorship,  DFPS  must 
consider placing a child in that home if the foster home is available, the placement would be in 
the child’s best interest, and placement with a relative or fictive kin is not in the child’s best 
interest. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.114(c).

Practice Tip: Prior to the hearing, determine if an agreement can be reached for a 
return to parent, placement with noncustodial parent, relative, or fictive kin. If so, 
draft  a  Rule  11  Agreement  to  present  to  the  other  parties.  If  not,  consider  filing  a 
motion for such relief.

Kinship And Fictive Kin Options

 ● If  the  child  is  in  a  foster  care  placement,  what  efforts  were/are  being  made  to  explore 

kinship and fictive kin placement options?

 ● Have the parents and the child been asked to identify kinship and fictive kin placement 

 ● Have home studies been started? If the home study will be outside of Texas, it will involve 
the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) unless it involves a biological 
parent.  Out  of  state  home  studies  take  significantly  longer  than  in-state  home  studies 
and  must  be  initiated  as  soon  as  possible  in  order  not  to  delay  permanency.  Please  see 
additional information in the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children section of 
this tool kit.

 ● If  relatives  were  identified  but  deemed  inappropriate  by  DFPS,  what  were  the  specific 

reasons? Was the placement assessed under Tex. Fam. Code § 264.754?

 ● Are there services or supports available to mitigate any safety risks identified in the home 

options?

study?

 ● If the child is in a kinship placement, has the placement been provided with appropriate 

training, services, and support to care for the child?

87

Concurrent IssuesPractice Tip: If DFPS is opposed to placement with a non-custodial parent, relative, 
or fictive kin due to their previous DFPS or criminal history, attorneys might consider 
conducting an independent investigation into that history. While DFPS may not be 
able to agree to placement due to policy, a judge may find that certain criminal history 
from the distant past and/or unrelated to a safety issue may not be a current safety 
issue for purposes of placement. Similarly, DFPS history that is remote, a finding of 
“ruled out” or “unable to determine,” or where the party was not a perpetrator but 
rather the  subject  child  or  a  collateral, also may not be considered to be a current 
safety issue.

The Child’s Needs

 ● Does the placement meet the child’s education needs and provide educational continuity?

 ● Is child’s trauma being sufficiently considered in determining the child’s placement?

 ● Is  the  placement  knowledgeable  about  helping  children  with  traumatic  stress  reactions 
and how to cope with those reactions? If not, what training or support is needed/ available?
 ● Does the placement understand the reasonable and prudent parent standard and support 

normalcy for the child?

 ● Are the siblings placed together? If not, what efforts were made to attempt to place them 
together?  Is  there  a  safety  issue  that  prevents  the  siblings  from  being  placed  together? 
How frequently are sibling visits occurring? Are the siblings able to regularly communicate 
with each other?

 ● Has the AAL regularly contacted the child to inform them of the next steps? Has the AAL 

checked on the child’s thoughts and feelings about the current placement options? 

Child’s Attorney Practice Tip: Keeping children informed about placement options 
helps give them a sense of transparency in decision-making about their life and gives 
them a voice in what decisions are made about them.

88

Concurrent IssuesVisitation

Temporary Visitation Schedule
A temporary visitation schedule is required at an early stage in a case for each child whose goal 
is  reunification:  The  caseworker  develops  the  schedule  with  the  child’s  parents  to  the  extent 
possible. 

DFPS  shall  ensure  that  a  parent  who  is  otherwise  entitled  to  possession  of  the  child  has  an 
opportunity to visit the child not later than the fifth day after the date DFPS is named TMC of 
the child unless:

 ● DFPS determines that visitation is not in the child’s best interest; or

 ● Visitation  with  the  parent  would  conflict  with  a  court  order  relating  to  possession  of  or 

access to the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 262.115; or

 ● DFPS has determined the goal is not reunification. 

 
The temporary schedule remains in effect until the visitation plan is developed under Tex. Fam. 
Code § 263.107 or modified by court order. 

Court Implementation of Visitation Plan
DFPS  must  file  the  family’s  visitation  plan  no  later  than  10  days  before  the  Status Hearing. 
Tex. Fam. Code § 263.107(d). After reviewing an original or amended visitation plan, the court 
shall  render  an  order  regarding a  parent’s  visitation  with  a  child  that  the  court  determines 
appropriate.

If the court finds that visitation between a child and a parent is not in the child’s best interest, 
the court shall render an order that:

 ● States the reasons for finding that visitation is not in the child’s best interest; and

 ● Outlines specific steps the parent must take to be allowed to have visitation with the child.

If the order regarding visitation between a child and a parent requires supervised visitation to 
protect the health and safety of the child, the order must outline specific steps the parent must 
take to have the level of supervision reduced. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.109.

Practice Tip: Attorneys for parents and children can use language to reorient how 
the  court  and  parties  perceive  the  contacts  between  parents  and  children.  Using 
language such as “family time” rather than “visits” or ‘visitation” can help bring focus 
to the parent-child bond. Advocates can also stress the importance of both the length 
and the quality of the contact in growing, maintaining, or repairing family bonds. 

Visitation Advocacy
Attorneys for parents and children can advocate that the court consider a number of options to 
increase the length and quality of time for visitation:

 ● Whether visitation can include normal parenting activities such as sharing meals, medical 

and therapeutic appointments, and school events;

 ● Whether  visitation  can  occur  at  parks,  restaurants,  museums,  zoos,  or  other  natural 

family-oriented settings;

 ● Whether nursing during bonding time for infants can be supported;

 ● Whether visitation time can factor in the bonding time needed at different developmental 
stages (younger children may need more frequent visits, older children with established 
bonds may need less frequent visits which are longer in duration);

89

Concurrent Issues ● Whether phone calls or virtual visits can be added to the visitation plan;

 ● Whether  there  is  a  safety  issue  that  necessitates  supervised  visitation  (if  the  children 
are older and/or if the reason for removal was neglect, then the visits may not need to be 
supervised);

 ● Whether there are, family, fictive kin, and/or community organizations that can supervise 

visits when supervision is necessary;

 ● Whether there is a way to support sibling visitation in addition to parent visitation;

 ● Whether the visitation schedule factors in the parent’s resources for transportation and 

 ● Whether  the  child  has  an  interest  in  expansive  visitation  that  is  independent  from  the 

time away from work;

parent’s progress in services; and

 ● If  a  child  is  having  a  negative  reaction  at  visitation,  whether  there  is  a  way  to  provide 
trauma-informed support to the parent and child to assist them with safe, continued visits 
rather than reducing visitation.

Attorneys representing parents who are entitled to visitation under a visitation plan may 
at any time file a motion with the court to request review and modification of an original or 
amended visitation plan. Tex. Fam. Code § 263.108(c).

90

Concurrent IssuesMedical Abuse and Neglect Allegations

Definitions
PHYSICAL ABUSE 

A physical injury that results in substantial harm to the child, or the genuine threat of substantial 
harm from physical injury to the child, including an injury that is at variance with the history 
or explanation given [emphasis added] and excluding an accident or reasonable discipline by 
a parent, guardian, or managing or possessory conservator that does not expose the child to a 
substantial risk of harm. Tex. Fam. Code § 261.001(1)(C).

MEDICAL NEGLECT

Failing to seek, obtain, or follow through with medical care for a child, with the failure resulting 
in  or  presenting  an  immediate  danger  of  death,  disfigurement,  or  bodily  injury  or  with  the 
failure  resulting  in  an  observable  and  material  impairment  to  the  growth,  development,  or 
functioning of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 261.001(4)(A)(ii)(b). 

The  DFPS  Process  for  Forensic  Diagnosis  of  Medical  Abuse  and 
Neglect Allegations
Medical  abuse  and  neglect  cases  are  typically  generated  by  an  intake  report  received  from 
hospital personnel or medical providers, such as a child’s pediatrician. 

FORENSIC ASSESSMENT CENTER NETWORK

DFPS  utilizes  the  Forensic  Assessment  Center  Network  (FACN)  in  most  medical  cases. 
The  FACN  was  established  by  DFPS  in  2006  to  make  specialized  pediatricians  available  for 
consultation to DFPS and Child Care Licensing in cases of suspected child abuse and neglect. 
The FACN is managed by the University of Texas Health Science Center (UTHealth)-Houston 
McGovern  Medical  School,  in  coordination  with  UT  Health  Science  Center  at  San  Antonio, 
UT Medical Branch at Galveston, UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dell Children’s 
Medical Center at Austin, and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center at Lubbock. 

The FACN requires consultations with physicians who are board certified in relevant field or 
specialty, including radiologists, geneticists, orthopedists, and endocrinologists. Physicians must 
also have experience in certain specific conditions such as rickets, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, and 
other medical conditions that mimic child maltreatment or increase the risk of misdiagnosis of 
child maltreatment. Tex. Fam. Code § 261.3017(b). 

SPECIALTY CONSULTATION

DFPS must refer the case for specialty consultation if DFPS, the child’s primary care physician, 
parent,  or  legal  guardian  (or  the  parent  or  legal  guardian’s  attorney)  requests  a  specialty 
consultation. The consultation must be with a board-certified physician who was not involved 
in the report of suspected abuse or neglect. 

DFPS must provide to the child’s parent or legal guardian written notice of the name, contact 
information, and credentials of the specialist before the specialty consultation and the parent, 
legal guardian, or attorney may object to the proposed referral and request referral to another 
specialist. DFPS and the parent, legal guardian, or attorney must collaborate in good faith to 
select an acceptable specialist from the proposed specialists, but DFPS can refer the child’s case 
to a specialist over the objection of the parent, legal guardian, or attorney. Tex. Fam. Code § 
261.3017(c), (c-1), and (c-2). 

The parent may still seek a second opinion and DFPS must consider the second opinion and 
document its analysis and determination regarding the opinion. Tex. Fam. Code § 261.3017(e).

91

Concurrent IssuesParent’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip: In a hospital setting, parents may have talked 
to  DFPS  investigators,  DFPS  Special  Investigators,  and  law  enforcement  without 
counsel and without understanding the implications. Additionally, parents may have 
signed  written  statements  and  the  parents  or  the  investigator  or  officer  may  have 
recorded the interview. When meeting with a parent client, it is critical to establish 
what information has been shared, what documentation may exist, and who possesses 
that documentation.

Medical Records
Any  case  that  involves  medical  information  should  start  with  a  medical  records  request. 
Depending on the type of case and allegations, an attorney may need to include requests for a 
child’s birth records and even a mother’s pregnancy records.

Parents are entitled to request a copy of their child’s medical records unless that right has been 
specifically restricted by a court. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.073(a)(3). A parent may then share such 
records with their attorney. 

Parent’s Attorney Practice Tip: Initial records may be incomplete, so an attorney 
may  need  to  make  additional  requests  for  specific  information  including,  but  not 
limited to, physician and nurses’ notes, consults, radiology and imaging, medication 
administration, and lab work.

Hospitals may also have their own internal process of assessing whether the child’s condition 
requires a referral to statewide intake. The records kept by these teams when they consult with 
each other and the FACN may contain several possible witnesses that may be relevant to the 
parent’s case, but the witnesses may not be included in a standard medical records request and 
may also need to be identified specifically. 

Most medical records are available in digital format, referred to as the Electronic Health Record 
(EHR). Records that look fuzzy, crooked, and scanned in may not be the EHR. Attorneys should 
request  an  electronic  copy/EHR  or  if  they  are  older  records,  records  in  an  Optical  Character 
Reader (OCR) format. This allows for quick scanning of the records for important information. 

Parent’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip:  Obtaining  all  the  necessary  records  may  be 
challenging  as  different  providers  may  have  different  policies  when  it  comes  to 
releasing records. If necessary, subpoenas can be used to ensure all relevant records 
are provided.

Medical Information and Decision Making When DFPS has TMC 
of the Child
MEDICAL CONSENTOR

When  DFPS  is  appointed  TMC,  DFPS  is  granted  the  rights  and  duties  in  Tex.  Fam.  Code  § 
153.371. This includes “the right to consent for the child to medical, psychiatric, psychological, 
dental, and surgical treatment and to have access to the child’s medical records.”

Pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code § 266.004, the court may authorize the following persons to consent 
to medical care for a child in the conservatorship of the Department: 

92

Concurrent Issues ● An individual named in a court order, including the child’s parent, 

 ● The child’s foster parent; or

 ● DFPS or an agent of the DFPS. 

This  person  is  commonly  referred  to  as  the  “medical  consenter.”  If  DFPS  or  its  agent  is  the 
medical consenter, DFPS shall file with the court and each party the name of the individual who 
will exercise the duty and responsibility on behalf of DFPS, and DFPS has an obligation to keep 
this information updated throughout the case. Tex. Fam. Code § 266.004(c). 

DFPS has a Medical Consent Resource Guide available online that references its policies for 
consenting to medical care for children in its conservatorship.

PARENTS’ MEDICAL RIGHTS WHILE DFPS HAS TMC

Unless the court specifically limits a parent’s rights by court order, a parent has the right at all 
times to:

 ● Receive information from DFPS concerning and to confer regarding the health, education, 

and welfare of the child;

 ● Access medical, dental, psychological, and educational records of the child;

 ● Consult with a physician, dentist, or psychologist of the child;

 ● Be designated on the child’s records as a person to be notified in case of an emergency; 
and  consent  to  medical,  dental,  and  surgical  treatment  during  an  emergency  involving 
immediate danger to the health and safety of the child; and

 ● Consent  to  medical,  dental,  and  surgical  treatment  during  an  emergency  involving 

immediate danger to the health and safety of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 153.073.

Parent’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip:  An  attorney  representing  a  parent  should  ask 
for the parent to be appointed as a temporary possessory conservator to make clear 
that the parent retains the standard rights a parent has when another party is the 
managing conservator.

Parent’s Attorney Practice Tip: Parents and their attorneys may still encounter 
barriers to exercising these rights with medical providers based on the nature of the 
case and DFPS involvement. Attorneys representing parents of children with medical 
needs  should  consider  how  to  use  subpoenas,  motion  practice,  and  collaborative 
efforts  in  their  specific  jurisdictions  to  get  necessary  medical  documentation,  seek 
second opinions, and to seek and obtain judicial rulings consistent with the children’s 
best interest.

Vaccination 
Tex. Fam. Code § 32.101 governs who may consent to immunization of a child. Subsections (a) 
and (b) indicate who may give consent, including DFPS, and the circumstances of that consent. 
However, Tex. Fam. Code § 32.101(c) provides that “a person otherwise authorized to consent 
under Subsection (a) may not consent for the child if the person has actual knowledge that a 
parent…has expressly refused to give consent to the immunization…” See In re Womack, 549

Concurrent IssuesParent’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip: An attorney representing a parent who objects 
to vaccinations should immediately document the parent’s refusal to give consent for 
the child’s vaccinations to DFPS and the court.

Expert Testimony 
GETTING YOUR OWN EXPERT

Attorneys  representing  parents  should  consider  getting  their  own  expert  witness  in  medical 
abuse and/or neglect cases though attorneys may struggle to find a medical expert who is not 
contracted with DFPS who is willing to take on a medical abuse and/or neglect case. 

Parent’s Attorney Practice Tip: Child welfare law practitioners in the area may 
have suggestions for expert witnesses used in previous cases. It might also be helpful 
to seek out medical expert suggestions from the criminal defense bar. It is also not 
uncommon for an attorney to seek a medical expert from another jurisdiction or state.

Funding for the expert may also be a challenge as it is likely an indigent parent cannot afford 
an expert witness fee. Consult with other child welfare law practitioners in your jurisdiction to 
determine the local practices for requesting funds for the expert. 

Some  experts  may  be  willing  to  consult  and  produce  a  short-form  report  from  the  available 
records.  Submitting  such  a  report  to  DFPS  may  avoid  the  need  for  contested  hearing  and 
consultation by the expert may be less expensive than retaining the expert for testimony. 

CROSS EXAMINATION

Regardless of whether a parent’s attorney is able to get their own expert in a medical abuse 
and/or neglect case, the parent’s attorney needs to engage in effective cross examination of the 
State’s  expert.  It  is  important  to  demonstrate  the  limitations  on  the  expert’s  knowledge  and 
opinion and establish that the expert’s role is to identify suspected abuse, not to identify the 
abusers. Areas of cross examination could include: 

The expert’s education and experience

 ● Are they board certified by the American Board of Pediatrics in child abuse pediatrics? 

 ● Do they meet the qualifications to become certified? 

 ● Have they attempted to take the exam? 

 ● Have they completed a fellowship in child abuse pediatrics?

Relationship with DFPS

 ● Are they contracted with DFPS?

 ● What is the amount of DFPS cases they handle per month/year?

 ● What paid work does the expert perform outside of work for DFPS, if any?

Training and experience in the relevant underlying area of medicine

 ● Do  they  have  the  training  that  is  relevant  to  this  child’s  specific  medical  condition  or 

injury, i.e., neurology, radiology, ophthalmology, pathology, etc.?

94

Concurrent IssuesPhysical examination and diagnosis of the child

 ● Has the expert personally examined the child?

 ● What is the amount of time the expert has spent with the child?

 ● Has the expert discussed the child’s injuries with the child’s parents?

 ● Was a filter or lens used to highlight the child’s injuries in photos?

 ● Were medical conditions that mimic maltreatment or increase the risk of misdiagnosis of 

maltreatment examined? Were they ruled out? See Tex. Fam. Code § 261.3017.

Additional information now available

 ● Has  the  expert  been  provided  with  new  information  by  DFPS  since  the  alleged  abuse/

neglect occurred?

 ● Does the expert have knowledge of the parents’ progress in services?

Practice Tip: It is not uncommon for parents to dispute the allegations of medical 
abuse or neglect but agree to DFPS being appointed TMC based on the lower standard 
of proof required at an Adversary Hearing. Effective advocacy when parents dispute 
the allegations can include any and all of the following:

 ● Request a Family Group Conference

A Family Group Conference is a facilitated meeting that can be held to discuss 
the child’s injuries, the parent’s progress in services, the risks that remain, how 
the risks can be mitigated through agreed court orders and safety plans, and the 
safety concerns that remain and how to address them. 

 ● Seek a consultation with the DFPS medical expert 

Consulting with the DFPS medical expert rather than getting the information 
second hand through the case worker or supervisor can create a better shared 
understanding  of  the  child’s  condition  and  needs  so  that  all  parties  have  the 
same information. 

 ● Filing a motion and setting an evidentiary hearing 

When  the  parent  and  child  advocates  are  at  an  impasse  about  whether  to  or 
how to move forward with family reunification, it is appropriate to seek court 
intervention to resolve the impasse. In this hearing, a parent’s attorney should 
seek specific orders on any remaining services needed to achieve reunification, 
expanding  visitation  to  include  unsupervised  and  overnight  visitation,  and/or 
seeking a monitored return.

Children’s Attorney IssuesInterviewing the Child Client

When to Interview the Client

 ● Within a reasonable time after the appointment. Tex. Fam. Code §107.003(a)(1)(A).

 ● Before each hearing, meet with the child if they are at least four years of age. Tex. Fam. 

Code §107.004(d)(1).

Background Preparation
Before the first interview, become familiar as possible with the client and the client’s background 
and history.

 ● Do not make assumptions about the child or the case.

 ● Read the pleadings, affidavits, and any other documents obtained.

 ● Talk with the DFPS caseworkers who have been involved with the case.

 ● Analyze the child’s world from the child’s perspective.

 ● Educate yourself about the trauma that the child has experienced, how the child’s past 

trauma affects the client now, and how might it affect the child in the future.

Goals For First/Early Meeting(s) With a Child Client

 ● Build rapport and trust.

 ● Explain the attorney-client privilege and confidentiality in a developmentally appropriate 

way and the roles and responsibilities of the professionals involved in the case.

 ● Learn the basic facts of the case from the child’s perspective.

 ● Assess the child’s needs.

 ● Elicit the child’s preferences related to the case, including placement, visitation, education, 

 ● Inquire,  in  developmentally  appropriate  manner,  about  potential  family  or  fictive  kin 

and normalcy.

placement options.

 ● Be patient and listen to your client. 

Location and Timing of Interview

 ● The interview can take place where the child lives, at their school, their daycare, a park, or 

another location where the child feels safe and comfortable.

 ● The interview must take place in a private space to ensure confidentiality. Tex. Fam. Code 

§107.004(d-1)(2).

Child’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip: If  you  meet  where  the  child  is  placed,  it  is  not 
recommended  to  go  into  a  bedroom  or  behind  closed  doors  to  meet  with  a  child. 
Potential  meeting  locations  include  meeting  outside  or  in  a  private  location.  If  the 
child wants to show you their room or meet in their room, it is advisable to keep the 
door open.

 ● The interview must take place sufficiently in advance of the hearing to allow the attorney 
to prepare in accordance with the child’s objectives. Tex. Fam. Code §107.004 (d-1)(1).

102

Children’s Attorney IssuesChild-Centered Interviewing
PREPARE TO ADDRESS CHILDREN’S COMMON CONCERNS

 ● When will I go home?

 ● When will I see my mom/dad/siblings/friends?

 ● Where will I live?

 ● Where will I go to school?

CREATE A TRUSTING ENVIRONMENT

 ● Ask where they would like to talk (outside/inside) and what physical place they prefer.

 ● Consider  bringing  an  age-appropriate  game  to  play,  such  as  Candy  Land,  Chutes  and 

Ladders, or Connect Four.

 ● For younger children, consider printing and bringing Sam and the Search for Spots, the 
Children’s Commission’s coloring book (available in English or Spanish) designed to help 
them understand the role of their lawyer.

 ● Go  for  a  walk  if  the  child  would  be  comfortable  doing  so  –  being  active  helps  promote 

conversation.

 ● Get on the child’s level physically. Sit on the floor, or together at a table or bench.

 ● Ask for permission when taking notes.

USE APPROPRIATE INTERVIEW TECHNIQUES

 ● Age-appropriate  ice-breakers.  Ask  about  the  client’s  interests,  likes,  and  dislikes  in 
connection with “safe” topic areas. (“What do you like to do for fun?” “Who is your favorite 
superhero?”)

 ● Simple, open-ended questions. (“Tell me how to play that game?” “Why is Batman your 

favorite?” “What do you like or dislike about _____?”)

 ● Follow  the  child’s  lead  on  areas  of  discussion  even  though  they  may  not  be  linear. 
Open-ended questions as you approach topic areas pertinent to the facts of the case are 
encouraged. Children are highly suggestible, so extra caution should be taken not to ask 
them any leading questions. 

 ● “Funnel” approach when your client tells the story of the case. Start by letting the child 
narrate the entire story as they choose and then ask appropriate, more narrow questions 
to inquire about specific details that will assist your advocacy while not re-traumatizing 
your client. 

 ● Check  for  understanding.  Children  often  say  that  they  understand  something  in  order 
to  please  adults,  when  they  really  may  not  fully  understand  the  conversation.  When 
explaining something to your child client, ask them to explain it back to you in order to 
check their level of understanding.

 ● Use  their  words.  For  example,  if  they  call  their  grandmother  GiGi,  call  her  GiGi  when 

talking to the child.

 ● Use demonstration. When appropriate, ask them to show how something happened, rather 
than requiring them to use words – or make demonstrations to help them (“You said you 
liked visiting with your mother. How much did you like or dislike about       ?” Show your 
hands close together [“this much?”] then spread them out [“this much?”]).

 ● Sibling groups. If interviewing a sibling group, talk with the group about an overview of 
the case, but then interview each child individually to obtain each client’s direction and 
preserve confidentiality.

 ● Judge’s role. Emphasize that the judge, rather than DFPS, the child’s parent or substitute 

caregiver, gets to make decisions about what happens in their case.

103

Children’s Attorney Issues ● Body language. Observe the child’s body language. Non-verbal communication in reaction 
to questions can help guide you about which topics the client is ready to talk about. Also, 
be aware that your body language can have an impact on your client. 

EXPLAIN THE LEGAL SYSTEM TO A CHILD

 ● Avoid jargon: instead of using the words “Adversary Hearing” substitute “talking to the 

judge about what is going on with you and your family.”

 ● Use  simple  language  to  explain  the  legal  roles  of  other  people  in  the  child’s  case.  For 

example:

 ○ a judge makes decisions;

 ○ a caseworker makes sure children are safe;

 ○ a CASA tells the judge what they think is best for the child;

 ○ a therapist helps people try to make better choices; and

 ○ a parent’s attorney tells the judge what their mom/dad wants.

EXPLAIN THE ROLE OF THE CHILD’S ATTORNEY

 ● Differentiate the attorney role from that of DFPS or CASA: Explain to the child “you are 
my boss/you get to tell me what you want to have happen and my job is to tell the judge what 
you want.”

 ● Explain the counselor part of the attorney’s role and prepare the child that some information 
and advice may be hard for them to hear at times but that you want them to know what to 
expect. When possible, and without breaking confidentiality, arrange for the child to have 
some support after such conversations.

 ● Explain  attorney-client  privilege  but  differentiate  confidentiality  from  keeping  secrets. 
Emphasize  to  the  child  that  you  will  keep  the  conversations  that  you  have  with  them 
private, except for what your client allows you to share, but that the child is free to share 
the conversations with anyone they choose.

 ● Explain  the  exceptions  to  confidentiality  and  your  obligation  to  report  abuse/neglect 

under Tex. Fam. Code § 261.101(c) if they disclose that:

 ○ they hurt someone;

 ○ someone hurts them; and/or

 ○ they are hurting themselves.

 ● Explain the procedural overview of the case in a way that is developmentally appropriate 

given the child’s age and demonstrated understanding of legal concepts.

 ● Explain that if the child also has a juvenile case there may be another attorney assigned 
to represent them in that matter but that both attorneys have the same duty to maintain 
confidentiality. Please see the Dual Status Youth section of this tool kit for more information.

Information That Should Be Acquired During The Interview

 ● Where does the client want to live? Have them rank their choice of placement (1st, 2nd, 

3rd), and document their choices.

 ● How does the child feel about their current placement?

 ● What are the child’s educational needs?

 ● What are the child’s health needs, including medical, mental, and therapeutic?

 ● What are the child’s preferences for visitation with parents and siblings?

 ● Can the child identify possible relatives or fictive kin?

 ● What are your observations regarding the effects of trauma on the child?

104

Children’s Attorney IssuesSpeaking to the Judge

 ● Explain that they might meet the judge in courtroom or in chambers.

 ● Ask both if the child would like to speak with the judge and where they would like to speak 

to the judge.

Child’s Attorney Practice Tip: If your jurisdiction permits virtual child conferences 
with the judge, allowing a child to visit with the judge virtually may be an appropriate 
option. Virtual meetings can allow the child to meet the judge from a setting they are 
comfortable  in,  reduce  interference  with  the  child’s  school  schedule,  and  can  allow 
the judge to see the child’s environment. There may be reasons why the child might 
still desire to meet the judge in person so all options should be presented to the client.

Gaining and Keeping the Client’s Trust

 ● Do not pretend to know them or their lives.
 ● Do not criticize their parents or other family members.

 ● Never make a promise that cannot be kept.

 ● Sustain a client’s morale but be honest. Tex. R. Prof. Conduct 2.01.

 ● Inform the child about the case in a developmentally appropriate manner. If appropriate, 

tell them about their parent’s progress, that their parents love them, etc.

 ● Answer their questions in developmentally appropriate ways.

 ● Be respectful of their views, comments, concerns, and situation.

 ● Practice empathy.

 ● Pay attention to what matters to the client. 

Discussion of Prior Abuse

 ● Avoid bringing up the topic of past abuse as repetition of traumatic events can retraumatize 

the child.

 ● If the child brings up the topic, remain calm, listen, and validate the child’s feelings. Do 
not overreact. Ask a few open-ended questions that allow the child tell their story in their 
own words.

 ● Know your limitations and keep the discussion brief. If a child will be a testifying witness 
regarding  the  abuse,  consult  with  the  child’s  therapist  and  a  forensic  interviewer  when 
preparing the child for testimony. 

 ● Do not criticize the child or the alleged abuser.

Dealing With a New Abuse Disclosure/Outcry

 ● Assume the child is telling the truth.

 ● Remain calm, do not overreact.

not their fault.

 ● Do not criticize the child or the alleged abuser.

 ● Do not make promises.

 ● Reassure the child that they did the right thing by telling you, and that what happened was 

 ● Let the child know this information cannot be kept a secret since you have an obligation to 

 ● Make  the  report  to  the  DFPS  Hotline:  1-800-252-5400  or  online  Texas  Abuse  Hotline

Children’s Attorney IssuesNormalcy

Normalcy Defined
FEDERAL LAW

Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act of 2014. 113. P.L. 183, 128 Stat. 1919

 ● Required  states  to  implement  a  “reasonable  and  prudent  parenting  standard”  giving 
foster parents the authority to make day-to-day decisions affecting children in their care 
regarding extracurricular, enrichment, cultural, social, and/or sporting activities.

Texas  adopted  a  definition  of  “age-appropriate  normalcy  activity”  as  well  as  a  definition  of  a 
“reasonable and prudent parent” effective September 1, 2015. See below for more specifics.

AGE-APPROPRIATE NORMALCY ACTIVITY DEFINED 

An activity or experience:

 ● That  is  generally  accepted  as  suitable  for  a  child’s  age  or  level  of  maturity  or  that  is 
determined  to  be  developmentally  appropriate  for  a  child  based  on  the  development  of 
cognitive, emotional, physical, and behavioral capacities that are typical for the age or  age 
group; and

 ● In  which  a  child  who  is  not  in  the  conservatorship  of  the  state  is  generally  allowed 
to  participate,  including  extracurricular  activities,  in-school  and  out-of-school  social 
activities, cultural  and enrichment  activities, and employment opportunities.  Tex.  Fam. 
Code § 264.001(1).

REASONABLE & PRUDENT PARENT STANDARD OF CARE DEFINED 

What  a  parent  of  reasonable  judgment,  skill,  and  caution  would  exercise  in  addressing  the 
health,  safety,  and  welfare  of  a  child  while  encouraging  the  emotional  and  developmental 
growth of the child.

Factors to consider when deciding whether an activity is appropriate:

 ● Overall health and safety of the child;

 ● Child’s age, maturity, and development level;

 ● Best interest of the child based on the caregiver’s knowledge of the child;

 ● Appropriateness of a proposed activity and any potential risk factors;

 ● Behavioral history of the child and the child’s ability to safely participate in a proposed 

activity;

 ● Importance of encouraging the child’s social, emotional, and developmental growth; and

 ● Importance  of  providing  the  child  with  the  most  family-like  living  experience  possible. 

Tex. Fam. Code § 264.001(5).

DFPS Best Efforts
DFPS shall use its best efforts to normalize the lives of children in the managing conservatorship 
of  DFPS  by  allowing  substitute  caregivers,  without  prior  DFPS  approval,  to  make  decisions 
similar to those which a parent would be entitled to make regarding a child’s participation in 
age-appropriate normalcy activities. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.125.

Normalcy in Practice
For youth in foster care, normalcy means being able to act like their friends act and feel like part 
of  a family. 

107

Children’s Attorney IssuesThis includes:

 ● Being part of a caring family that supports them.

 ● Doing the normal daily and extracurricular activities they choose.

 ● Being a person, not a label.

 ● Making decisions, trying new things, and sometimes making mistakes.

108

Children’s Attorney IssuesChildren Without Placement (CWOP)

If DFPS or an SSCC is unable to secure a licensed placement for a child in DFPS conservatorship, 
the child must receive temporary emergency care provided directly by DFPS or an SSCC until 
a licensed appropriate placement can be found. DFPS or the SSCC must provide notice to the 
court no later than the next business day after the date the child is placed in temporary care. 
Tex. Fam. Code §264.107(g).

Children are forbidden by statute to stay overnight in a DFPS office, so the child must stay in 
another location (i.e., hotel, apartment) while being supervised by DFPS staff. Tex. Fam. Code 
§264.1071. While this situation should be avoided whenever possible, the number of children 
without placement are very low compared to the overall population of children in care across 
Texas.
Causes and Risk Factors

There is no single reason why some children in the conservatorship of DFPS might experience a 
lapse in licensed placement. However, the combination of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
increased federal and state oversight, and placement capacity gaps are some factors that may 
have contributed to an increasing number of children in Texas entering CWOP. 

Children who are at higher risk of CWOP include:

 ● Older children

 ● Children with behavior issues

 ● Children released from psychiatric hospitals

 ● Children released from juvenile detention

 ● Children with special needs (i.e., Autism) 

Impacts of CWOP on Children 
INSTABILITY

 ● Children moving to or from a residential treatment center (RTC)

 ● Overnight stays in DFPS offices are forbidden by statute, but children without placement 
may stay in hotels or apartments overnight and may stay in DFPS offices during daytime 
hours.  Such  unlicensed  placements  are  intended  as  a  short-term  solution,  but  some 
children may experience it for longer periods of time.

 ● The  child’s  formal  education  may  be  interrupted  and  there  may  be  limited  access  to 

informal education resources such as tutors or study sessions. 

 ● Therapy for the children can be inconsistent during temporary placements. 
 ● Not having a stable, licensed placement can be a traumatic experience for children. 

Child’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip:  Children  without  placement  who  are  staying  in 
hotels,  offices,  or  dorms  on  a  temporary  basis  meet  the  federal  McKinney-Vento 
Homeless  Assistance  Act  (“McKinney-Vento”)  definition  of  homeless  and  therefore 
are entitled to attend the school that the child attended when permanently housed or 
the school in which the child was last enrolled, with transportation and other services 
provided by the school district. 42 U.S.C. § 11431 et seq.

109

Children’s Attorney IssuesSUPERVISION 

 ● The children are supervised and provided for by caseworkers and other DFPS staff. These 

duties are in addition to existing work responsibilities. 

 ● Caseworkers  and  staff  must  ensure  that  an  adult  is  always  present,  but  there  is  no 

consistent caregiver or supervisor. 

 ● DFPS caseworkers and staff are not trained as childcare providers.

without adequate supervision.

 ● Children  without  placement  may  be  at  increased  risk  of  running  away  or  becoming  a 

 ● Unsupervised access to medication can lead to improper dosage or the proper medication 

 ● Children with serious mental health or behavioral needs may interact with other children 

 ● Without training and options for discipline, conflicts between children or between children 

and staff can escalate and increase the risk of injury or arrest. 

BASIC NEEDS 

 ● Older youth do not have the support or living space available to build healthy life skills 
such  as  hygiene,  cleaning/chores,  getting  regular  physical  activity  outdoors,  cooking  a 
healthy meal, etc. 

 ● Making visitation arrangements with parents is more complicated when the child does not 

have a stable placement.

What Can Attorneys Do if a Client or a Client’s Child is in CWOP? 
BUILDING TRUST

Attorneys  can  work  to  reduce  the  possibility  of  CWOP  by  building  strong  attorney-client 
relationships that center on partnership. 

 ● Children  in  care  who  feel  supported  by  the  adults  in  their  lives  may  be  less  likely  to 
run  away,  experience  placement  breakdowns,  or  experience  one  or  more  unlicensed 
placements. Parents who have a good relationship with their attorney are more likely to 
share information about possible placement options, including kinship. 

 ● The most important aspect of building attorney-client partnerships is to take the time to 
listen  to  the  client.  Their  insights  and  expertise  can  be  very  helpful  in  informing  what 
actions need to be taken, including identifying and vetting possible placement options. 

 ● Making  an  authentic  connection  with  each  client  from  the  start  of  the  attorney-client 
relationship  may  help  to  prevent  CWOP  situations  by  identifying  and  solving  problems 
before they reach a crisis point.

IDENTIFYING PLACEMENT OPTIONS

An attorney can assist in moving a child out of CWOP by thoroughly investigating alternative 
placements. For example, attorneys for children and parents might:

 ● Identify whether there are relatives or fictive kin who may not meet DFPS approval but 

 ● Contact  potential  relatives  or  fictive  kin  placement  and  consider  meeting  with  them  in 

could be a safe place for this child.

their homes, if appropriate.

 ● Request  specific  placement  search  information  from  DFPS.  Which  placements  were 

considered, which were rejected, and why?

 ● Consider contacting treatment centers that do not contract with DFPS about availability. 

110

Children’s Attorney Issues ● Request the child’s common app, review for accuracy, and request edits, if appropriate. 

MOTION PRACTICE

When a child is without placement,  attorneys can help maintain a sense of urgency by setting 
regular  hearings  until  an  appropriate  placement  is  found.  The  following  motions  may  be 
appropriate in unique circumstances and would not be appropriate for filing in every case.

Motion for Change of Placement: If asking for placement with a relative or fictive kin who 
DFPS  has  not  or  cannot  approve,  it  is  important  to  be  aware  if  that  person  has  any  DFPS 
or  criminal  history.  It  may  also  be  helpful  to  visit  the  proposed  home  prior  to  the  hearing. 
Explore whether supportive services such as daycare or after-school care should be considered 
to stabilize the placement. 

Motion for Court Approval of Out of State Placement: Consider requesting that the court 
require prior court approval for the child to be placed in any out of state facility. 

Motion for Education Services: Explore what educational supports may be available through 
the school district where the child was last enrolled. Depending on the child’s educational needs 
and  goals,  distance  learning  may  be  an  option  for  the  child  until  a  stable  placement  can  be 
found. Consider requesting that tutoring or other education support be ordered. 

Motion for Normalcy Activities: Children without placement may be caught in a cycle where 
there are no authorized activities, but there may be inadequate supervision to prevent them from 
engaging in unauthorized activities. A motion to allow the child to engage in specific activities 
or for DFPS to provide opportunities for activities can encourage normalcy and stability. 

Motion for Therapy or Other Services: If your client needs therapy or other services, request 
that such services be brought to the child’s current location or that the child can access them 
remotely. 

Motion  for  Child-Specific  Contract:  This  motion  requests  the  court  to  order  DFPS  to 
contract with a provider that does not have a standing contract with DFPS for placement. This 
motion may only be appropriate in very limited circumstances and a child specific contract is 
not a quick or easy solution. Drafting a child-specific contract will take time, the cost of the child 
specific contract is significant, and the enforceability of the court’s order may end up in further 
litigation.

111

Children’s Attorney IssuesChildren with Disabilities

Attorney-Client Relationship
A child’s intellectual or developmental disability does not necessarily mean that the child is not 
competent to form an attorney-client relationship. Neither does a child’s IQ alone demonstrate 
incapacity.  It  is  imperative  for  a  child’s  attorney  to  become  familiar  with  child  development 
stages,  interview  the  child,  make  an  independent  determination  if  that  child  can  form  an 
attorney-client relationship, and determine whether the attorney can or must follow the client’s 
directives. If the child cannot meaningfully direct representation, the child’s attorney must follow 
the procedures outlined in Tex. Fam. Code § 107.008 for substituted judgment.

Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
DFPS is required to assess and determine long-term care plans for youth who have qualifying 
disabilities. DFPS is responsible for applying for SSI on the youth’s behalf. Written confirmation 
of  benefits  from  the  Social  Security  Administration  is  necessary  to  understand  exactly  what 
benefits the youth is entitled to when they exit foster care. DFPS has Regional Specialists for 
SSI and they can be an effective resource for ensuring the client obtains appropriate resources.

EFFECTS OF SSI ON A CHILD’S PLACEMENT

 ● If a child receives SSI and they are in DFPS-contracted substitute care, the SSI payment 

goes to the state to defray the cost of the child’s care.

 ● If a child receives SSI and is placed with a kinship caregiver, the kinship caregiver can 

receive the SSI payment either directly or once it has passed through DFPS.

 ● If the child is adopted, the SSI payment is taken into consideration when negotiating the 

adoption subsidy.

TAKING ACTION IF SERVICES ARE DENIED

All  children  in  foster  care  are  automatically  enrolled  in  the  STAR  Health  Medicaid  plan 
regardless  of  any  prior  Medicaid  eligibility  or  enrollment  in  other  Medicaid  Plans.  At  this 
time,  Superior  HealthPlan  is  the  insurance  provider  for  STAR  Health,  so  children  in  DFPS 
conservatorship can only go to providers who accept Superior HealthPlan. If a client is denied a 
service by Superior HealthPlan, the denial can be appealed. Typically, there is a lengthy process 
for administratively  appealing  Medicaid service denials. Rather than appealing the Superior 
decision, it may be more efficient to petition the court to order the service under Tex. Fam. Code 
266.004(e). Though Superior HealthPlan is not a party to the case and technically subject to 
court orders, they are contractually obligated to pay for services ordered by the court. However, 
it is important to note that Superior HealthPlan can only be ordered to provide services that are 
both “medically necessary” and part of the Texas Medicaid Plan. Any other healthcare service 
ordered by the court must be paid for by different means, typically by DFPS directly.

Intellectual Disabilities
Children  with  Intellectual  and  Developmental  Disabilities  (IDD)  can  be  supported  long-term 
after aging out of DFPS care through the Home and Community-Based Services (HCS) program 
that provides housing, therapeutic interventions, and other in-home supports for the lifetime 
of a person with IDD. Though the most common way to qualify for an HCS program slot is to 
be put on a waiting list, most individuals wait over 10 years for an HCS slot. There are special 
slots in the HCS program for children aging out of DFPS custody. To qualify for one of these 
special slots the child must have a Determination of Intellectual Disability (DID) from the Local 
Mental  Health  Authority  (LMHA).  There  are  several  agencies  all  over  the  state  that  license 
and supervise HCS host homes (similar to foster homes) and group homes (homes with shift 
staff and four or fewer individuals). Though DFPS should identify potential HCS agencies and 
placements for the child, the child and the attorney ad litem should be active participants in 
making the final placement selection since this will be where the child lives for a very long time 
as an adult. The child is also entitled to pre-placement visits in making the placement decision. 

112

Children’s Attorney IssuesChild’s Attorney Practice Tip: Make  sure  the  DFPS  Developmental  Disability 
Specialist (DDS) has registered an eligible youth for an HCS slot, if needed.

Child’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip:   The  process  to  apply  for  and  receive  disability-
related benefits can be a lengthy one. If the child has a disability and may be entitled 
to  services,  it  is  critical  to  have  conversations  with  the  caseworker  and/or  DFPS 
Regional Social Security Specialists as soon as practicable and on a regular basis.

Guardianship
Competency  is  generally  determined  based  on  whether  the  individual  can  continue  to  make 
decisions  for  themselves  with  supports  in  place  rather  than  losing  their  rights  through  a 
guardianship proceeding where a guardian is appointed to make decisions on their behalf. However, 
a child with an intellectual disability or other disability does not automatically qualify for adult 
guardianship once they turn eighteen. A probate court still must appoint Texas Department of 
Aging and Disability Services (DADS) or another guardian through a probate proceeding and a 
Certificate of Medical Exam (CME) must be completed by a physician and presented to the court 
documenting the person’s incapacity. DADS, through the Texas Health and Human Services 
Commission (HHSC), is the state agency that is appointed as the guardian for a qualifying child 
if there is not another adult to take guardianship, and they can accept or reject a guardianship 
application.

Child’s Attorney Practice Tip: If a child client will require a guardian once they 
become an adult, it is important to begin the application process well before the client 
turns 18 as qualification for guardianship is not automatic.

STEPS TO GUARDIANSHIP

By the time a youth with disabilities turns 16, the caseworker must consider whether the youth 
will have the ability to provide for their own food, clothing, shelter, oversee their own healthcare, 
and manage their own finances.

The DFPS caseworker should begin searching for an interested and appropriate potential guardian 
when a youth in care with disabilities turns 16 and should consult with the DFPS Developmental 
Disability  Specialist  (DDS)  and  DFPS  supervisor  regarding  alternatives  to  guardianship or 
possible alternate guardians. If there is not a least restrictive alternative available, the DFPS 
caseworker should begin collecting information and necessary documentation for the referral to 
HHSC to request a guardian.

While DFPS may refer a youth to HHSC at age 16, it is preferable for DFPS to wait until the 
youth is at least 17 since a guardianship application cannot be filed more than six months prior 
to the youth’s 18th birthday. Prior to making a referral to HHSC, the DFPS caseworker should 
contact the DFPS SSI coordinator to ensure the youth is receiving active SSI benefits, and if 
benefits are not active, the DFPS caseworker must work with the SSI coordinator to apply or 
have benefits reinstated.

Once the SSI benefits for the youth with disabilities have been established and confirmed and all 
supporting documentation required has been gathered, the DFPS supervisor launches the Aging 
Out of Care (AOC) stage in IMPACT, the DFPS case management system. The DFPS caseworker 
completes  the  referral  form  and  submits  it  to  the  DDS.  The  DDS  submits  the  guardianship 
referral via IMPACT and emails a copy of the referral form and all supporting documentation to 
the Guardianship Supervisor in the region where the youth is currently residing.

113

Children’s Attorney IssuesALTERNATIVES TO GUARDIANSHIP

A guardianship restricts the legal rights of an individual with a disability and may not always be 
appropriate. Courts must ensure that the least restrictive arrangement is made for a youth with 
disabilities, so the youth has their needs met and their rights intact. Sometimes a youth may 
only need a limited guardianship that is tailored to the specific needs they have. For instance, 
the right to vote, the right to drive, and the right to marry might all remain intact. Restoring a 
right after it has been removed via guardianship can be challenging and it is preferable to leave 
as many rights as possible available for the individual.

Some youth do not need a guardianship at all and can be better served with a Supported Decision- 
Making Agreement (SDMA), which is a less-restrictive option that allows the youth to retain all 
decision-making rights while having a supporter who helps them to understand and process the 
decisions they make.

Child’s Attorney Practice Tip:  Make sure that the proper department at DFPS is 
notified when a youth who receives SSI is aging out of foster care so that DFPS can 
resign as the youth’s designated payee. Once DFPS resigns as the payee, the youth 
can  go  to  the  Social  Security  Administration  office  to  become  their  own  payee  or 
designate a new payee. If the youth cannot manage their own finances but does not 
need a guardian, local resources may help find a designated payee to help the youth 
manage their finances.

Transition Planning
The Section 811 Project Rental Assistance Program provides project-based rental assistance for 
extremely low-income persons with disabilities linked with long term services and allows persons 
with  disabilities  to  live  as  independently  as  possible  through  the  coordination  of  voluntary 
services  and  providing  a  choice  of  subsidized,  integrated  rental  housing  options.  Referrals  to 
Section 811 must be made by the DFPS primary case worker in coordination with the DFPS 
Developmental Disability Specialist. There is also a waiting list for this program, though it is 
much shorter than the waitlist for HCS.

114

Children’s Attorney IssuesDual Status Youth

Definitions
A dual system child is a child who, prior to the child’s 18th birthday, was referred to the juvenile 
justice system and was involved in the child welfare system. Tex. Fam. Code § 51.11. A dual 
status  child  is  a  dual  system  child  who  has  or  had  concurrent  involvement  in  both  the  child 
welfare and juvenile justice systems. Tex. Fam. Code § 51.02. When representing dual status 
children there are important issues  to consider.

Information Gathering 
Questions to ask when a client has been detained (arrested) for an offense:

 ● Has the child been appointed a juvenile defense attorney on the delinquency case? If so, 
make contact with the attorney as soon as possible to introduce yourself, learn about the 
offense, and provide any information about the child that can assist the juvenile defense 
attorney in their representation.

 ● Has a petition been filed? Is the child eligible for a deferred prosecution?

 ● Is the juvenile case filed in the same county as the child welfare case?

 ● What are the pending charges? What range of dispositions might be involved?

 ● Is the child currently in detention? How long have they been there? When is the child’s 

next detention hearing scheduled? Is juvenile probation recommending release?

It is important to research these questions with the child, the caseworker, the juvenile defense 
attorney, and the juvenile probation officer, depending on the timeline of the case.

GUARDIAN AD LITEMS AND COURT APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATES

A guardian ad litem may serve as ad litem in both the juvenile case and the child welfare case. 
If the guardian ad litem is serving in both cases and is an attorney, the guardian ad litem will 
want to become much more familiar with the juvenile proceedings.

A non-attorney guardian ad litem must be very careful not to investigate any pending juvenile 
charges nor offer testimony concerning the guilt or innocence of a dual status child. Questions 
or investigations could lead the non-attorney guardian ad litem to become a witness against the 
child in violation of Tex. Fam. Code 51.11. As such, questions from a GAL or CASA should be 
presented to the juvenile defense attorney, instead of the child or child’s parents or guardians.

CONFIDENTIALITY

Because  the  objectives  of  the  juvenile  defense  attorney  (handling  the  delinquency  case)  and 
the  attorney  ad  litem  (as  well  as  others  working  on  behalf  of  the  youth  on  the  child  welfare 
case) may not necessarily align, it is important for the two attorneys or legal teams to enter a 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) at the very outset of representation to identify what 
information, if any, may be shared between attorneys and legal teams.

It is critically important to advise a client not to discuss their delinquency case with anyone 
besides their juvenile defense attorney (unless MOUs have been signed allowing for information 
sharing). Information about the allegations is confidential and protected by the Fifth Amendment 
and the juvenile defense attorney should advise the clients of their Fifth Amendment right to 
remain silent as to any details regarding a current criminal investigation or ongoing case. That 
may  include  information  that  the  juvenile  defense  attorney  will  not  want  to  disclose  to  the 
child’s attorney, or have their client disclose to the child’s attorney, without an MOU.

In the absence of an MOU governing information sharing, the Rules of Professional Conduct 
dictate  that  confidentiality  is  imperative.  Under  these  rules,  the  juvenile  defense  attorney 
should advise the client not to speak or discuss the delinquency case or any of its details with 
anyone (other than their juvenile defense attorney).

115

Children’s Attorney IssuesIn the absence of an MOU, an issue that may arise is that the DFPS caseworker or investigator 
may  ask  the  client  about  their  delinquency  charges,  and  the  client  may  respond  without 
understanding the implications for their delinquency case.

COMMUNICATION WITH JUVENILE DEFENSE COUNSEL

Notwithstanding the existence of an MOU, it is crucial to establish open lines of communication 
with a client’s juvenile defense attorney. A child’s attorney in the child welfare case may know 
the client and their family history and circumstances better than the juvenile defense attorney. 
A child’s attorney in the child welfare case can provide information that assists in a better and 
more expedient resolution on the delinquency case, including:

 ● Mitigating circumstances due to child’s DFPS case and placement;

 ● Services the child needs;

 ● Services the child is already receiving;

 ● Best ways to communicate with the child;

 ● Possible resources of support known in child welfare case but not in juvenile case; 
 ● Attendance at detention hearings (if child is in detention) to advise court of placements 

available to the child, in order to allow for expedited release from detention; or

 ● Attendance  at  disposition  hearings  (if  the  child  is  adjudicated  delinquent)  to  advise  of 
interventions  being  utilized  with  the  child  and  family  already  or  interventions  that  are 
available.

Court-appointed juvenile defense attorneys often have heavy caseloads, which can slow their 
response time when contacted, but it is important to initiate a conversation as soon as possible 
to discuss the mutual client’s case.

Important things to discuss include:

 ● Upcoming court dates for both the child welfare and juvenile cases;

 ● Progress of the case;

 ● The general strategy of the juvenile defense attorney;

 ● The status of plea negotiations with prosecution (i.e., what is the current offer, what are 
the possibilities in the case for pre-petition diversion programs, deferred adjudication, or 
services as part of a plea negotiation); and

 ● Disposition  options  in  the  juvenile  case,  including  placement  options  if  the  child  is  not 

going to be released on probation.

Child’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip: Make  it  a  priority  to  check  in  with  the  juvenile 
defense attorney for updates regularly, at least before each statutory child welfare 
hearing, and more often if child is in detention.

Understand How the Juvenile Case Affects the Child Welfare Case
SERVICES OVERLAP

It  is  important  for  the  juvenile  court  to  determine  what services are being provided through 
the child welfare case. Must they be duplicated or substituted by juvenile probation services, 
or are the services  being  provided  in  the  child welfare case  sufficient? Ask the court to allow 
consolidation of services as much as possible. This is especially important if transportation and/
or time management is necessary for a caregiver to provide so that the child is able to receive 
services.

116

Children’s Attorney IssuesCONSEQUENCES OF DISPOSITIONS – SEALING JUVENILE RECORDS

Once a juvenile case is concluded or nearing its end, whether it was disposed through a deferred 
prosecution  or  through  formal  adjudication  and  disposition,  it  is  imperative  to  take  steps  to 
ensure that the child’s juvenile records will be sealed. Even if the case was resolved through a 
deferred prosecution without a charge being filed, the child will still have a juvenile record that 
can have numerous negative collateral consequences, such as:

 ● Barriers to obtaining housing;

 ● Difficulty with successful applications to colleges or trade schools;

 ● Obstacles in obtaining employment;

 ● Problems applying for military service; and/or

 ● Interference with immigration cases.

Youth transitioning out of foster care are especially in need of having their records sealed once 
they  become  eligible  to  ensure  a  better  transition  into  adulthood.  There  are  both  non-profit 
agencies and juvenile attorneys that will seal juvenile records via Application for Sealing of Files 
and Records. Please see the Additional Resources section of this tool kit for more information.

Child’s Attorney Practice Tip: Constructing a timeline with the delinquency case 
dates and the statutory deadlines for the child welfare case can increase understanding 
of how the two cases may overlap.

117

Children’s Attorney IssuesPsychotropic Medication Parameters for Children

Psychotropic medications are substances that affect the mind and alter mental processes such 
as  perception,  mood,  and  behavior.  Psychotropic  drugs  include  stimulants,  antidepressants, 
antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers. Some children need to use psychotropic medications long- 
term to treat mental health disorders that they inherited or developed, such as attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder, severe depression, or psychosis. Other children need to use psychotropic 
medications temporarily to help relieve severe emotional stress and help them function in school, 
at home, and in the community.

Child’s Attorney Practice Tip: Symptoms of mental health disorders can overlap 
with  the symptoms  of  trauma.  A  child’s  behavior  may  be  related  to  their  trauma 
history.  If  a  child  client  is  exhibiting  behavioral  issues,  consider  advocating  for 
trauma-informed services for the client.

In 2013, the 83rd Texas Legislature amended Tex. Fam. Code § 266.001 to add a definition of a 
psychotropic medication. A “psychotropic medication” means a medication that is prescribed for 
the treatment of symptoms or psychosis or another mental, emotional, or behavioral disorder and 
that is used to exercise an effect on the central nervous system to influence or modify behavior, 
cognition, or affective state. The term includes the following categories:

 ● Psychomotor stimulants;

 ● Antidepressants;

 ● Antipsychotics or neuroleptics;

 ● Agents for control of mania or depression;

 ● Anti-anxiety agents; and

 ● Sedatives, hypnotics, or other sleep-promoting medications. Tex. Fam. Code § 266.001(7).

In February 2005, DFPS, the Department of State Health Services (DSHS), and HHSC released 
a “best practices” guide to ensure the proper use of psychotropic medications for the children in 
foster care.

The  June  2019  Psychotropic  Medication  Utilization  Parameters  for  Children  and  Youth  in 
Foster Care in Texas Public Behavioral Health (6th Version) is the most recent version of these 
guidelines. It serves as a resource for physicians and clinicians who care for children diagnosed 
with mental health disorders. The guide provides recommendations for the appropriate use of 
psychotropic  medications  for  children  in  foster  care  and  includes  nine  criteria  indicating  the 
need for review of the child’s clinical status.

Since  April  2008,  STAR  Health  has  conducted  Psychotropic  Medication  Utilization  Reviews 
(PMURs) on the children whose medication treatment falls outside of the expectations of the 
Parameters.  A  PMUR  can  be  initiated  by  STAR  Health  if  indicated  by  a  health  screening 
or  pharmacy  claim  review.  A  PMUR  may  also  be  triggered  by  a  request  from  any  judge, 
attorney,  caseworker,  advocate,  foster  parent,  Medical  Consenter,  or  other  concerned  person 
working with the child. The PMUR examines child-specific clinical information about a child’s 
diagnoses, medication dosage, and whether the medication treatment is in compliance with the 
Parameters. The PMUR is not a second opinion on whether the medication is appropriate for 
that child or whether the child is on “too much” medication. It primarily reviews whether the 
prescribing  physician  violated  the  Parameters  (for  example,  are  two  medications  prescribed 
that are contraindicated). STAR Health has committed to prioritize responses to inquiries from 
judges  concerning  children  under  their  supervision.  PMUR  findings  are  usually  sent  to  the 
child’s caseworker or can be faxed or emailed directly to the court, if requested.

118

Children’s Attorney IssuesAll  PMUR  requests  are  reviewed  by  one  of  two  STAR  Health  Licensed  Behavior  Health 
Clinicians who gather medical records and screen children’s psychotropic medication treatment 
for compliance with the Parameters. If the treatment is outside the Parameters, the clinician 
refers the case to a STAR Health child psychiatrist to conduct a PMUR. The child psychiatrist 
outreaches to the treating physician, works with the treating physician to reduce polypharmacy 
if indicated, and prepares a PMUR report. The PMUR report will contain a formal determination 
about the foster child’s medication treatment. The possible determinations are as follows:

 ● Medication treatment within Parameters;

 ● Medication treatment outside Parameters. Medication treatment reviewed and found to be 

within the standard of care;

 ● Medication  treatment  is  outside  Parameters  and  there  is  opportunity  to  reduce 

 ● Medication treatment is outside Parameters and there is risk for or evidence of significant 

polypharmacy; or

side effects.

Physicians  who  appear  to  consistently  prescribe  outside  the  Parameters  despite  risk  for  or 
evidence  of  significant  side  effects,  or  when  there  is  an  opportunity  to  reduce  polypharmacy, 
are referred to the Quality of Care (QOC) review process. Additional records are examined for 
pervasive  patterns  of  over  or  dangerous  prescribing.  Qualifying  cases  may  be  referred  to  the 
Peer  Review  Committee  for  further  investigation  and  action.  The  Peer  Review  Committee  is 
established by the Managed Care Organization, Superior HealthPlan, and consists of network 
providers  who  review  PMUR  concerns  for  STAR  Health  Members  who  exceed  the  Quality  of 
Care thresholds. Superior HealthPlan also utilizes consultant physicians as needed to review 
specific specialist issues, if a need is identified. The results of Quality Improvement and Peer 
Review  Committee  investigations  and  actions  are  confidential  and  may  not  be  released  to  or 
discussed with the public. All QOC issues are tracked and trended. Any practitioner showing 
a pattern or trend may be placed on corrective action and/or face disciplinary action up to and 
including termination of their contract, if warranted.

A PMUR cannot address whether other medications might be effective, and this process is not 
the appropriate avenue to address immediate concerns about new medications or medication 
side  effects;  the  informed  consent  process  is  considered  the  appropriate  avenue  to  inquire 
about  new  medications  and  side  effects.  In  these  situations,  STAR  Health  recommends  that 
the  Medical  Consenter  contact  the  prescribing  physician  directly.  DFPS  also  employs  Nurse 
Consultants in each administrative region to assist DFPS staff with children’s health issues, 
including questions about psychotropic medications.

The Parameters and PMUR can be accessed on DFPS’s website.

Children’s Attorney IssuesOlder Youth in Foster Care

An attorney representing teenage youth in foster care must be aware of several specific duties 
the attorney, DFPS, and the courts have regarding older youth, as well as best practices that can 
help prevent negative outcomes for youth who age out of DFPS care.

Legal Requirements Before a Youth’s 18th Birthday 
MEDICAL CONSENT

Child’s Attorney Duties Tex. Fam. Code § 107.003(b)(3)(A)

Once a child turns 16, the child’s attorney must advise the child of their right to request the court 
authorize the child to consent to the child’s own medical care and file a motion if the youth wants 
to request that authority. Though the duty applies once the child turns 16, an attorney should 
begin advising and building rapport with the client regarding the issue well ahead of the child’s 
birthday. 

IDENTIFICATION ISSUES

DFPS Duties Tex. Fam. Code § 264.121(a-7), (e), (e-1)

By age 16, DFPS must provide youth with original or certified copies of the following:

 ● Texas Identification Card or Driver’s License

By age 18, DFPS must also provide youth with the following:

 ● Birth certificate

 ● Social Security card

 ● Immunization records

 ● Health passport

 ● A Medicaid card or other proof of Medicaid enrollment or insurance card from the health 

plan that provides health coverage to the youth

Before a youth leaves foster care, if the youth is age 14 or older, DFPS must ensure that the 
youth has an e-mail address through which the youth may receive encrypted copies of personal 
documents and records.

Child’s Attorney Duties Tex. Fam. Code § 107.003(b)(3)(B)

Once a child turns 16, the child’s attorney must ascertain whether the child has received:

 ● Original or certified copy of their birth certificate

 ● Social Security card

 ● Texas Identification Card or Driver’s License

 ● Any other documents DFPS determines appropriate

Child’s Attorney Practice Tip: If the attorney ascertains the child does not have 
the  required  documents,  the  attorney  should  advocate  both  inside  and  outside  of 
court to assist the youth in obtaining the documents. That could mean helping the 
youth connect with appropriate government offices that can assist them in acquiring 
documents, working with DFPS to obtain documents, or setting hearings in front of 
the judge to request orders that missing documents be produced. 

120

Children’s Attorney IssuesChild’s Attorney Practice Tip: A child’s attorney should also ensure the youth has 
original  copies  of  all  immigration  documents.  It  is  essential  that  the  youth  knows 
and  understands  their  immigration  status  and  has  all  their  original  immigration 
documents.  Assumptions  about  citizenship  can  have  disastrous  consequences 
for the youth later in life. Do not rely on third-hand explanations and seek outside 
immigration  expertise  if  necessary.  If  the  youth  appears  to  not  have  immigration 
status or documents, attorneys should verify that DFPS staff is working on obtaining 
legal  immigration  status  or  documentation  of  their  status  and  regular  progress is 
being made. See the Special Immigrant Juvenile Status section of  this  tool   kit  for 
more information.

Child’s Attorney Practice Tip: A child’s attorney should also ensure youth have 
access to their credit report and receive a copy of it before exiting care. Credit issues 
such as identity theft can occur regardless of the age of the child so attorney should 
ensure the report is done as soon as possible. DFPS is required to run and review a 
credit report for foster youth every year between the ages of 14 and 17.

Child’s Attorney Practice Tip: Verify that each identification document has the 
youth’s correct name and that the name is spelled correctly. It is also important to 
ask the youth what name they prefer and if they want to change their legal name. 
Youth may have strong negative feelings about their legal name if they associate it 
with someone who abused, neglected, or abandoned them, but they may not be aware 
they can change it. If there is a problem with the youth’s name or if the youth wants 
to change their name, it is much easier to correct the mistake or change the name 
before the youth turns 18.

121

Children’s Attorney IssuesPreparing for Transition to Adulthood
PREPARATION FOR ADULT LIVING

The Preparation for Adult Living (PAL) program involves an independent living skills assessment, 
life skills classes, transition planning, conferences, and training events. Services may start as 
early as age 14 but must begin by age 16. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.121. PAL services are usually 
offered by local service providers who will also provide voluntary aftercare case management for 
the youth between age 18 and age 21. DFPS has dedicated PAL coordinators to help youth access 
benefits when they leave care.

Youth  with  disabilities  should  not  be  excluded  from  the  PAL  program.  DFPS  must  make 
appropriate  accommodations  that  allow  for  meaningful  participation.  Tex.  Fam.  Code  § 
264.121(a)(4). 

Circle of Support  (COS)  meetings will be scheduled for youth who are on track to age out of 
foster care. A COS is centered on the youth and is the preferred method of transition planning. 
The  youth  is  permitted  to  invite  foster  care  providers,  teachers,  parents,  siblings,  relatives, 
mentors,  attorneys,  CASAs,  and  friends.  In  addition  to  attending  the  COS,  attorneys  should 
help prepare the youth for the COS. A COS may feel intimidating to a youth but going over 
the  structure  and  purpose  of  the  meeting  in  advance  can  help  reduce  anxiety,  this.  This  is 
particularly important as the effects of trauma can impede the youth’s ability to plan ahead and 
see a future for themselves. If an initial COS does not adequately address the youth’s transition 
needs, a child’s attorney can request an additional COS and help the youth plan ahead for the 
meeting.

EXTENDED FOSTER CARE

Youth who wish to remain in extended foster care after their 18th birthday must meet one of the 
following eligibility criteria:

 ● Attend  high  school  or  a  program  leading  to  a  high  school  diploma  or  a  high  school 

equivalency certificate (GED);

 ● Attend  college  or  higher  learning  institution,  or  post-secondary  vocational  program  or 

technical program (6 credit hour minimum); 

 ● Participate in an employment program or activity that promotes or removes barriers to 

employment;

 ● Work at a job at least 80 hours per month; or

 ● Have a documented medical condition that limits other activities.

Not later than six months before the youth’s 18th birthday, DFPS must complete all necessary 
paperwork to ensure the youth has housing on the date the youth enters extended foster care. 
DFPS must also review the qualifications and requirements for the youth’s housing not later 
than 90 days before their 18th birthday. Tex. Fam. Code § 264.1214.

Supervised Independent Living (SIL) is a program available only to youth in extended foster care 
that allows them to live independently in a supervised living arrangement while their expenses 
are paid by DFPS. SIL placement locations can be apartments, college dorms, or shared housing. 
If permitted by the property owner, DFPS should allow the youth to co-sign the lease for their 
housing.

If a youth chooses not to remain in extended foster care, they can return any time before they 
turn  21,  as  long  as  there  are  placements  available.  This  is  an  available  option  regardless  of 
whether the Trial Independence period has ended or if the court still has Extended Jurisdiction.

122

Children’s Attorney IssuesTRANSITIONAL SERVICES AND BENEFITS

Healthcare

 ● Former  Foster  Care  Children’s  Medicaid  (FFCC):  Young  adults  are  eligible  only  if  they 
received federally-funded Medicaid on their 18th birthday; this benefit is not dependent 
on means; youth are eligible for this benefit until age 26.

 ● Medicaid  for  Transitioning  Foster  Care  Youth  (MTFCY):  Young  adults  are  eligible  for 
this  benefit  if  they  were  not  receiving  federally-funded  Medicaid,  but  were  in  DFPS 
conservatorship, on their 18th birthday. Youth are eligible for this benefit until age 21 and 
must be under 400% of the Federal Poverty Guideline.

 ● Maintaining  Medicaid  Eligibility:  All  Medicaid  recipients,  including  youth  formerly 
in  foster  care,  must  renew  their  Medicaid  eligibility  once  every  12  months.  To  ensure 
continuous coverage, youth must provide their current mailing address to HHSC. If the 
youth’s address changes without noticing HHSC, and HHSC receives returned mail and 
cannot locate the youth, the youth’s Medicaid benefits will be denied. A youth can report an 
address change online at YourTexasBenefits.com, through the Your Texas Benefits mobile 
app, calling 211, in person at a local Medicaid eligibility office or by in writing by mail or 
by fax. Youth must also respond to requests for information from HHSC and may need to 
verify that they are a Texas resident and/or their immigration status.

Transitional Expenses

 ● Transitional  Living  Allowance  (TLA):  This  cash  benefit  of  $1,000  is  available  in  two 
separate payments of $500 each. It is available to young adults who were in foster care 
on their 18th birthday, who completed the PAL life skills class, and who are transitioning 
to independent or supervised living. Recipients must meet the same eligibility criteria as 
extended foster care and must receive the benefit before their 21st birthday. CPS Handbook 
§ 10241.

 ● Aftercare  Room  and  Board  (ARB):  This  is  an  emergency  benefit  of  up  to  a  maximum of 
$3,000  paid,  in  increments  of  no  more  than  $500  per  month,  directly  to  landlords  or 
utility companies or as a grocery store gift card. It is available to young adults who were in 
foster care on their 18th birthday and demonstrate emergency financial need. They must 
meet  the  same  eligibility  criteria  as  extended  foster  care  and  must  receive  the  benefit 
before their 21st birthday. CPS Handbook § 10251.

Education

 ● Tuition/Fee Waiver: This benefit waives tuition and fees for all Texas public institutions of 
higher  education  (including  2-year  colleges,  4-year  universities,  and  technical  schools). 
Eligible youth or young adults, including some youth who are reunified with parents, must 
enroll  in  a  dual  credit  or  college  credit  course  before  their  25th  birthday  to  lock  in  the 
benefit. Once the benefit is activated, it does not expire. Tex. Educ. Code § 54.366. Adopted 
youth may also be eligible for the waiver. Tex. Educ. Code § 54.367.

Child’s Attorney Practice Tip: The eligibility criteria for the tuition and fee waiver, 
as well as assessing which programs qualify for the waiver, is complex. Contact the 
regional Preparation for Adult Living specialist to verify eligibility.

123

Children’s Attorney Issues ● Education  and  Training  Voucher  (ETV):  This  is  a  federal  cash  benefit  of  up  to  $5,000 
per year for expenses related to college or training programs (e.g., housing, food, books, 
childcare,  computer  equipment,  other  expenses).  Eligible  young  adults  can  receive  the 
benefit until age 23 (available to more than only aged out foster youth). 40 Tex. Admin. 
Code § 700.1613.

Child’s Attorney  Practice  Tip: Some aftercare benefits are contingent based on 
how the child exits care. It is important to advise the client well before their 18th 
birthday on the benefits which might be available under each exit type, including an 
adult adoption after the client turns 18.

Child’s Attorney Practice Tip: Explaining health insurance and financial benefits 
to  youth  can  be  challenging.  Attorneys  should  take  the  time  to  explain  them  in  a 
way  that  youth  can  understand.  The  Texas  Foster  Youth  Justice  Project  also  has 
resources that can help youth understand the benefits in a way that is accessible to 
them.

Extended Jurisdiction
Extended jurisdiction allows the court to retain a youth’s case on the court’s docket after the 
youth turns 18, hold review hearings to determine whether the youth is receiving appropriate 
services, and order DFPS to provide certain services to the youth. The court may not compel a 
youth to attend a hearing and the youth still maintains all the rights of any adult of the same 
age. Tex. Fam. Code §§ 263.601-263.608. When a young adult turns 18, DFPS conservatorship is 
dismissed. The young adult can choose to either remain in Extended Foster Care (EFC) or can 
exit DFPS’ care to live independently, also known as Trial Independence (TI). When a young 
adult makes a decision to remain in EFC or to begin TI, the young adult is considered to be in 
Extended Court Jurisdiction.

TRANSITIONAL LIVING SERVICES

A  young  adult  who  stays  in  EFC  may  or  may  not  be  receiving  Transitional  Living  Services 
(TLS). TLS are multipurpose and include circles of support, preparation for adult living classes, 
education and training vouchers, college tuition and fee waivers, and other related services and 
support of young people 16 to 21 or up to 22 years of age who are currently or formerly in foster 
care, or who are transitioning out of care.

PATHS FOR YOUNG ADULTS AGING OUT OF FOSTER CARE

Path 1 – Extended Foster Care

For a young adult in EFC, a review hearing is held every six months. A young adult can exit EFC 
for TI at any time prior to age 21. For those remaining in EFC, the court’s extended jurisdiction 
ends at age 21.

Path 2 – Trial Independence

If at age 18 the young adult decides to not stay in EFC, he or she exits to Trial Independence (TI) 
which automatically extends up to six months. Trial Independence may be extended up to 12 
months by court order. The young adult can choose to return to EFC during the TI period or at 
any time before age 21. A young adult may or may not use TLS while in TI but receiving TLS 
effects the court’s extended jurisdiction over the youth’s case.

124

Children’s Attorney IssuesNo hearings are required by the court during TI, but the young adult may request a hearing, or 
the court may set hearings on its own motion. At a hearing, a court may review and make orders 
regarding the services being provided to youth, identification documents the youth may need, 
and sibling contact if the youth has siblings in DFPS conservatorship.

Path 2A – Trial Independence without Transitional Living Services

If  the  young  adult  does  not  receive  TLS,  the  court’s  jurisdiction  ends  on  the  last  day  of  the 
month  in  which  the  young  adult’s  TI  period  ends  or  upon  the  young  adult’s  21st  birthday, 
whichever is earlier, unless the court has extended jurisdiction until age 21.

Path 2B – Trial Independence with Transitional Living Services

When the young adult’s TI ends, the young adult can request a voluntary extension of the court’s 
jurisdiction  beyond  the  TI  period  if  the  young  adult  is  currently  receiving  TLS.  The  court’s 
jurisdiction ends when the young adult turns 21, or before, if the young adult withdraws consent 
to the court’s extended jurisdiction.

Child’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip:  In  the  court  hearing  immediately  before  a  child 
client turns 18, consider submitting a motion to extend the court’s jurisdiction until 
age 21. This establishes a safety net that causes no harm and allows the young adult 
to request assistance from the court if needed for an additional amount of time.

Children’s Attorney IssuesPaternity

Establishing the Parent-Child Relationship
The Mother-Child Relationship is established between a woman and a child by:

 ● The woman giving birth to the child;

 ● An adjudication of the woman’s maternity; or

 ● The adoption of the child by a woman.

The Father-Child Relationship is established between a man and a child by:

 ● An unrebutted presumption of a man’s paternity of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 160.204.;

 ● An  effective  acknowledgment  of  paternity  under  Subchapter  D  of  Tex.  Fam.  Code  § 

160.204, unless the acknowledgment has been rescinded or successfully challenged;

 ● An adjudication of the man’s paternity;

 ● The adoption of a child by the man; or

 ● The  man’s  consent  to  assisted  reproduction  by  his  wife  under  Subchapter  H,  which 

resulted in the birth of the child. Tex. Fam. Code § 160.201.

Types of Fathers as Defined in the Texas Family Code

 ● Presumed

 ● Alleged (or putative)

 ● Acknowledged

 ● Adjudicated

 ● Unknown

PRESUMED FATHER

A man is a presumed father if:

 ● He is married to the mother of the child and the child is born during the marriage;

 ● He is married to the mother of the child and the child is born before the 301st day after 
the date the marriage  is  terminated by death, annulment, declaration of invalidity, or 
divorce;

 ● He is married to the mother of the child before the birth of the child in apparent compliance 
with the law, even if the attempted marriage is or could be declared invalid and the child 
is born during the invalid marriage or before the 301st day after the date the marriage it 
terminated by death, annulment, declaration of invalidity, or divorce;

 ● He married the mother of the child after the birth of the child in apparent compliance with 
law, regardless of whether the marriage is or could be declared invalid, he voluntarily 
asserted his paternity of the child, and:

 ○ the assertion is in a record filed with the Vital Statistics Unit;

 ○ he is voluntarily named as the child’s father on the child’s birth certificate; or

 ○ he promised in a record to support the child as his own; or

 ○ during  the  first  two  years  of  the  child’s  life,  he  continuously  resided  in  the 
household  in  which  the  child  resided  and  he  represented  to  others  that  the 
child was his own. Tex. Fam. Code § 160.204.

127

Parents’ Attorney IssuesALLEGED FATHER

A man is an alleged father if:

 ● He alleges himself to be, or is alleged to be, the genetic father or possible genetic father of 

a child, but his paternity has not been determined.

An alleged father cannot establish paternity or create a presumption of paternity by registering 
with  the  Paternity  Registry,  but  timely  registration  entitles  him  to  notice  of  an  action  for 
termination of parental rights or adoption of a child he may have fathered.

An alleged father’s paternity may be established if:

 ● The mother of a child and the man claiming to be the biological father sign an acknowledgment 
of paternity with the intent to establish the man’s paternity. Tex. Fam. Code § 160.301. 
A valid acknowledgment of paternity filed with the Vital Statistics Unit is the equivalent 
of an adjudication of the paternity of a child and confers all rights and duties. Tex. Fam. 
Code § 160.305.

 ● Both the mother and father can testify in open court and ask the court to establish paternity.

 ● Genetic testing is done. DFPS may obtain genetic testing through the Office of the Attorney 
General. Any party, an attorney ad litem, or guardian ad litem for the child may request 
that genetic testing be ordered by the court to establish paternity.

 ● If the alleged father refuses to submit to genetic testing, the court may adjudicate paternity 

contrary to his position. Tex. Fam. Code § 160.622.

As soon as a legal father is established, any other potential candidates can be dismissed.

Paternity Registry

The Vital Statistics Unit (VSU) maintains a paternity registry. A man who wants to be notified 
of a proceeding for the adoption or the termination of parental rights regarding a child he may 
have fathered must register before the birth of the child or no later than the 31st day after the 
child’s birth. The registrant has the responsibility of keeping his information current with the 
VSU. A man who has filed with the paternity registry within the requisite time frame is entitled 
to be served with notice of a suit involving the child. Registering with the paternity registry also 
establishes a basis for personal jurisdiction of a person who is not a Texas resident.

If no father-child relationship can be established, a petitioner (DFPS) seeking termination of 
parental rights or adoption must obtain a certificate of the results of a search of the paternity 
registry. If the petitioner (DFPS) has reason to believe that conception or birth of the child may 
have occurred in another state, the petitioner must obtain a certificate from the paternity or 
putative father registry of that state.

 ● He has executed an Acknowledgement of Paternity (AOP). A valid AOP filed with  the VSU 

is the equivalent of an adjudication of paternity.

ACKNOWLEDGED FATHER

A man is an acknowledged father if:

ADJUDICATED FATHER

A man is an adjudicated father if:

 ● He  has  been  adjudicated  by  a  court  to  be  the  father  of  a  child.  Adjudication  can  be 
accomplished by an admission of paternity under penalty of perjury during a hearing or in 
response to a refusal to submit to genetic testing.  A signed Acknowledgment of Paternity 
that has been filed with the Department of State Health Services is also the equivalent of 
an adjudication of paternity.

128

Parents’ Attorney IssuesEstoppel of Paternity
The Texas Legislature has recognized that in certain circumstances it may be in the best interest 
of the child not to have the child’s understanding of their paternity disrupted. The value of 
maintaining the child’s relationship with the man identified to the child as their father may 
prevent  interested  parties  from  litigating  the  issue,  including  denying  a  Motion  for  Genetic 
Testing. See Tex. Fam. Code §§ 160.607, 160.608, 160.609.

Child’s Attorney Practice Tip: For a child without an Adjudicated or Presumed 
Father, asking for DNA testing on any alleged father who is present at the hearing 
can  save  time  and  prevent  delays  to  permanency.  If  the  petition  does  not  include 
a request to terminate the rights of the unknown father, a child’s attorney should 
consider including the request in their counter-petition.

129

Parents’ Attorney IssuesChild Support and Kinship Support

Child Support
All parents have a duty to support their child. The court may order either or both parents to 
support a child as follows, per Tex. Fam. Code § 154.001:

Child support may be ordered:

later;

 ● Until the child is 18 years of age or until graduation from high school, whichever occurs 

 ● Until the child is emancipated through marriage, removal of disabilities of minority by a 

court order, or by other operation of law;

 ● Until the death of the child; or

 ● If the child is disabled as defined in Tex. Fam. Code § 154.302, for an indefinite period.

The court may order each parent who is financially able to pay support a child for whom DFPS 
has been appointed managing conservator.

 ● This support continues until the earliest of:

 ○ the child’s adoption;

 ○ the  child’s  18th  birthday  or  graduation  from  high  school,  whichever  occurs 

 ○ the removal of the child’s disabilities of minority by court order, marriage or 

other operation of law;

 ○ the death of the child; or

later;

period.

 ○ if the child is disabled as defined in Tex. Fam. Code § 154.302, for an indefinite 

If the court presiding over a SAPCR involving DFPS orders child support payments or modifies 
existing child support payments so that the payments be made to DFPS, the court must notify 
the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) within 10 days of rendering the order.

Note  that  upon  terminating  a  parent’s  rights,  the  court  may  order  that  parent  to  pay  child 
support post-termination. Tex. Fam. Code § 154.001(a-1). In the absence of evidence of a party’s 
resources, the court shall presume that the party has income equal to the federal minimum 
wage for a 40-hour week. Tex. Fam. Code §154.068.

When computing net resources available for payment of child support, refer to charts and tables 
in Tex. Fam. Code Ch. 154, Subchapter B. This includes: child support tax charts; definition 
of net resources; additional factors for the court to consider; application of guidelines to net 
resources, computing support for children in more than one household, etc. 

Practice  Tip:  When  child  support  is  ordered,  the  court  shall  order  that  child 
support be payable through the state disbursement unit (SDU). See Tex. Fam. Code 
§  154.004(a).  The  OAG  monitors  payment  of  child  support  through  the  SDU  and 
if  a  delinquency  occurs,  the  OAG  has  a  right  to  seek  enforcement  of  child  support 
and  if  delinquency  occurs,  can  move  to  enforce  the  child  support  order.  Texas  law 
requires  the  court  to  order  that  income  be  withheld  from  the  disposable  earnings 
of  the  obligor  for  the  payment  of  child  support.  See  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  158.001.   

he OAG prescribes forms as authorized by federal law in a standard format entitled 
“Income  Withholding  for  Support  (IWO)  Form,  Instructions  &  Sample  OMB  0970-
0154”. See Tex. Fam. Code § 158.106(a). The form is published in 1 Tex. Admin. Code 
§ 55.118.

 ● 300%  of  current  poverty  level,  as  determined  annually  by  federal  poverty  guidelines. 

(Caregivers with a household income over 300% are not eligible.)

With PMC of the Child – Annual Reimbursement Payment (No Medicaid)

The child must have been:

 ● Previously in the managing conservatorship of DFPS; and

 ● Placed in the home by DFPS. 

The caregiver must:

foster caregiver);

 ● Meet all of the requirements for caregivers without PMC (e.g., not be a licensed or verified 

 ● Have obtained PMC of the child after September 1, 2017; and

 ● Continue to comply with the signed caregiver assistance agreement. 

The caregiver’s household income does not exceed:

 ● 300%  of  current  poverty  level,  as  determined  annually  by  federal  poverty  guidelines. 

(Caregivers with a household income over 300% are not eligible.)

PERMANENCY CARE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (PCA)

Requires caregiver to become a licensed/verified foster parent and obtain PMC of the child.

131

Parents’ Attorney IssuesIncludes one-time reimbursement of nonrecurring expenses, monthly payment, and Medicaid. 

The child must:

 ● Have been previously in the managing conservatorship of DFPS;

 ● Have been placed in the home by DFPS;

 ● Have demonstrated a strong attachment to the prospective permanent kinship conservator;

 ● Not  have  reunification  or  adoption  as  a  permanency  option  (DFPS  has  already  ruled 

these out for the child);

 ● If at least 14 years of age, have been consulted by DFPS about the prospective permanent 

kinship conservator’s commitment to assume PMC of the child; and

 ● Have  resided  in  the  caregiver’s  home  since  it  was  licensed/verified  for  at  least  six 

consecutive months.

The caregiver must:

 ● Be a relative of the child or have had a longstanding and significant relationship with the 

child prior to DFPS placing the child in the home;

 ● Have a strong commitment to caring permanently for the child;

 ● Have  been  eligible  for  the  receipt  of  foster  care  reimbursements  on  behalf  of  the  child 
(i.e., caregiver must become a licensed or verified foster parent to the child) for at least 
six consecutive months prior to the effective date of the PCA agreement;

 ● Enter  into  a  PCA  agreement  with  DFPS  on  behalf  of  the  child  prior  to  becoming  the 

child’s permanent kinship conservator; and

 ● Obtain PMC of the child.

The court must NOT issue an order that includes any of the following:

 ● Naming either of the child’s parents as Joint Managing Conservator (JMC) of the child;

 ● Naming DFPS as JMC of the child; or

 ● Awarding  possessory  conservatorship  to  any  parent  of  the  child  under  circumstances 

DFPS determines have the effect of reunifying the child with that parent.

Practice  Tip:  The  earlier  the  relative/caregiver  begins  the  process,  the  earlier 
they can become eligible to finalize a PCA agreement which can increase options for 
negotiation at the end of the case and avoid unnecessary extensions of the deadline. 
Courts are also required to inform relatives caring for children of the ability to apply 
for PCA at the Adversary Hearing, Status Hearing, and Permanency Hearings before 
and  after  a  final  order.  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §§  262.201(n-1),  263.202(i),  263.306(c)(2), 
263.5031(3).

132

Parents’ Attorney IssuesInability to Care & Parents with Disabilities

Inability to Care
In certain circumstances, DFPS may file for termination of a parent’s rights based on the parent’s 
mental illness or deficiency without alleging one of the termination grounds in Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 161.001. 

STATUTE

Tex. Fam. Code § 161.003

The court must find:

 ● That the parent has a mental or emotional illness, or mental deficiency that renders the 

parent unable to provide for the physical, emotional, and mental needs of the child;

 ● That the illness or deficiency will probably continue to render the parent unable to provide 

for the child’s needs until the child’s 18th birthday;

 ● That DFPS has been Temporary or Sole Managing Conservator for at least six months 

prior to the termination hearing;

 ● That DFPS made reasonable efforts to return the child to the parent; and

 ● That termination is in the child’s best interest.

Parent’s Attorney Practice Tip: The needs of the child also affect the impact of 
the deficiency. For example, a parent’s deficiency may prevent them from being able 
to  meet  the  emotional  needs  of  a  3-year-old  who  throws  tantrums,  but  the  same 
parent might be able to meet the emotional needs of an 11-year-old. 

ADVOCACY

When representing a parent who has a mental or emotional deficiency, an attorney still owes 
their client a duty of zealous advocacy to ensure their client’s rights are protected and that 
DFPS makes reasonable efforts to return the child to the parent.

Federal law prohibits governmental entities, including DFPS and the courts, from discriminating 
against people with disabilities in their programs, services, and activities. Once it is determined 
that  a  parent  or  caregiver  has  an  intellectual  or  developmental  disability  and/or  a  mental 
illness, DFPS is obligated to work with the family to identify possible services and supports 
that  can  assist  the  caregiver  in  meeting  the  needs  of  their  child.  If  a  caseworker  suspects 
that a parent has an intellectual or mental disability, they must contact the Developmental 
Disability  specialist  at  DFPS  so  that  a  member  of  that  team  can  work  with  the  parent  on 
whatever services are required. This policy is based on Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 
1973, as well as the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires governmental entities to 
make accommodations for people with disabilities.

Parents With Disabilities
Parents with mental or intellectual disabilities are equally entitled to accommodations as those 
with physical disabilities. DFPS is legally mandated to make reasonable accommodations and 
modifications for disabled parents and caregivers so that they have equal access to services, 
and so that they can complete the services according to their abilities. An attorney may need 
to  advocate  for  transportation  assistance  for  a  parent,  relocation  of  a  service  or  visit  to  an 
accessible facility, or referral to agencies that can help with various supports.

133

Parents’ Attorney IssuesParent’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip:  Accommodations,  modifications,  and  supports 
must be individualized, and there is no one size that fits all. Therefore, it is important 
to understand the clients’ strengths and limitations to effectively advocate for them 
and the accommodations needed. DFPS has a policy handbook called “Working with 
Parents with Disabilities.” This can be a  helpful resource to use when advocating for 
accommodations for the parent, particularly as they relate to Family Service Plans.

134

Parents’ Attorney IssuesIncarcerated Parents

Generally,  an  incarcerated  parent  has  the  same  rights  and  duties  as  a  parent  who  is  not 
incarcerated, and an attorney owes their client the same duties of zealous advocacy to protect 
their  client’s  rights  and  ensure  that  reasonable  efforts  are  made  to  return  the  child  to  the 
parent.

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) is the agency which manages the overall 
operation of the state’s prison system, parole, and state jail systems. The agency also provides 
funding, training, and certain oversight of community supervision.

Types Of Correctional Facilities
CORRECTIONAL CENTERS (PRIVATE)

These are privately operated correctional centers that house Correctional Institutions Division 
(CID) offenders.

County jails are managed by the county sheriff or designee. The county jail facility’s primary 
role is  to  hold  defendants  awaiting  trial  or  those  who  have  been  convicted  and  sentenced  to 
county jail.

COUNTY JAILS

FEDERAL PRISONS

Federal prisons are managed and run by the U.S. government and houses inmates who have 
been convicted of a federal crime. The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is responsible for the 
centralized administration of federal prisons.

STATE JAIL FACILITIES

State  jails  house  individuals  who  have  committed  felony  crimes  (primarily  property  crimes 
and low-level controlled substance offenses) that have a maximum sentence of two years and a 
mandatory term of community supervision. Some state jails are privately operated and house 
state felons as well as CID transfer offenders.

How to Locate an Incarcerated Parent
To  locate  a  parent  in  a  TDCJ  Facility  (a  Texas  prison  or  State  Jail)  contact  the  Office  of 
Classification and Records in Huntsville, Texas at:

 ● 1-936-437-6564 or 1-800-535-0283;

 ● Visit the TDCJ website; or

 ● Look for the Quick (Link) box and use the list just as the TDCJ website has it.

PARENTS NOT UNDER TDCJ SUPERVISION

If the parent is confined in a facility other than TDCJ, the following links may be useful:

 ● Federal  Bureau  of  Prisons  (BOP)  (contains  online  inmate  locator).  The  BOP  Office  of 

Public Affairs phone: (202) 307-3198; Email: webmaster@bop.gov.

 ● Victim Information and Notification Everyday (Vine Link) to locate a parent who may be 

incarcerated in another state.

 ● Corrections Department by state to locate a parent in another state. 

The following are some additional links not supported or endorsed by TDCJ:

 ● Prison Search Ancestor Hunt

 ● Corrections.com

135

Parents’ Attorney IssuesPARENTS IN COUNTY JAILS

To  determine  if  a  parent  is  incarcerated  in  a  county  jail,  conduct  a  search  of  the  county’s 
website in order to locate the parent or contact the county jail directly.

Attendance at Hearings and Trial
Even if a client is incarcerated, they still have a right to be present at the statutory hearings.

Parent’s Attorney Practice Tip: If a client wants to attend a hearing or trial via 
phone or video conference, contact the correctional facility well before the scheduled 
hearing to determine what is required to make the client available at the scheduled 
time. If the client wants to attend in person, a bench warrant will be required and 
the best practice is to work with the court and the attorney representing DFPS to 
facilitate the bench warrant.

Service Plan
A client’s incarceration does not mean they cannot participate in services. To find out what 
services  are  available  to  the  incarcerated  parent,  contact  the  facility  or  go  online  to  view 
Rehabilitation Programs Services where the TDCJ inmate services are located. Some county 
facilities also have classes available for their inmates. Attorneys should contact the jail to obtain 
a list of services available for their parent client and inquire into programming available both 
on-site and through distance learning. There may be programs that parents can participate in 
via mail correspondence even if classes are not being offered on-site.

Visitation
A  client’s  incarceration  does  not  mean  that  visitation  with  their  child  is  impossible  or 
inappropriate.

If  the  court  is  reluctant  to  order  visitation  with  an  incarcerated  parent,  there  are  studies 
which  indicate that allowing contact between children and parents who are incarcerated can 
mitigate the harms of separation for the child. Please see the Additional Resources section of 
this tool kit for more information.

If visitation is ordered by the court, it is important for the parent’s attorney to explain to the 
parent client that they need to notify their attorney if the parent is not permitted visits by 
the facility as a result of disciplinary sanction, because of facility security, transfer to another 
facility, or release from a facility or program.

Parent’s Attorney Practice Tip: Contact the correctional facility about the facility’s 
family visitation policy, including procedures and restrictions (such as whether all 
visitors  must  be  on  the  offender’s  visiting  list  before  being  approved  to  visit)  and 
determine if there is a social worker or chaplain who can help with arranging parent-
child visits at the facility.

An incarcerated parent may send written correspondence to their child. However, it is prudent 
to advise the client that the content of written correspondence is not confidential and discuss 
what information is and is not appropriate to include in written letters.

136

Parents’ Attorney IssuesPlacement
A client’s incarceration does not mean that they are unable to assist in providing information 
about or facilitating a placement for their child. Relatives and fictive kin of an incarcerated 
parent may be placement options or other sources of support for the child and family. A parent 
client  should  be  given  the  opportunity  to  provide  that  information  as  soon  as  possible  after 
appointment.  Please  see  the  Placement  section  of  this  tool  kit  for  more  information  when 
considering placement issues.

137

Parents’ Attorney IssuesParents with an Open Criminal Case

A parent client may have an additional criminal component to a case filed by DFPS. This can be 
difficult to navigate as actions taken in the child welfare case can directly affect the criminal 
case and there are important aspects to consider from the outset for both the child welfare and 
criminal cases.

Information Gathering
Questions to ask the client:

 ● When and where were they arrested? What state and county?

 ● What are the pending charges? Have they been filed?

 ● Is there an alleged victim? Does the client know the alleged victim? If so, how?

 ● Does the client have any previous convictions?

 ● Do they have a criminal attorney? (If they do not have an attorney, it is important they 

understand their right to an attorney, including a court-appointed attorney.)

If the client does not know the above information, then the parent attorney may research the 
answers  as  part  of  an  independent  investigation  into  the  client’s  case.  The  parent  attorney 
can  contact  the  criminal  prosecutor  or  criminal  defense  attorney  to  make  inquiries,  and  if 
those  professionals  cannot  be  identified,  run  an  independent  criminal  record  search.  Even 
though the information above pertains to the criminal case, understanding the criminal case is 
necessary to better represent a client in the child welfare case.

If the parent client does not have a criminal attorney, consider assisting them in the process 
to apply for one. There may be applications and affidavits required, depending on where the 
criminal case is located. Parent attorneys may call the court directly for its specific process for 
appointing a criminal attorney.

CONFIDENTIALITY

It is crucial to establish the importance of confidentiality with the client and advise the client 
not to  discuss the criminal case and any of its details with anyone besides their parent’s attorney 
and their criminal attorney. The client has a Fifth Amendment right to remain silent as to any 
details  regarding  a  current  criminal  investigation  or  ongoing  case.    The  parent’s  attorney 
should strongly consider preparing the client to respond to questions from the investigator or 
caseworker in the child welfare case  about the criminal charges so that the client may respond 
in a way that does not have negative implications for their criminal case.

Parent’s Attorney Practice Tip: The confidentiality discussion should take place 
during the initial contact with the client as a part of the attorney-client privilege 
explanation.

COMMUNICATION WITH DEFENSE COUNSEL

It is crucial to establish an open line of communication with a client’s criminal attorney. Court- 
appointed criminal attorneys often have heavy caseloads which can slow their response time, 
but it is important to initiate a conversation as soon as possible to discuss the client’s criminal 
case.

A parent’s attorney in the child welfare case can provide information that assists the criminal 
defense attorney in preparing a dense and resolving the criminal case, including:

 ● Mitigating circumstances due to the parent’s history and circumstances;

 ● Services  the  parent  has  completed  in  their  child  welfare  case  or  is  in  the  process  of 

completing; and

138

Parents’ Attorney Issues ● Effective ways to communicate with the parent.

Important things to consult with the client’s criminal attorney about include:

●  Upcoming court dates for both the child welfare and criminal case;

●  The evidence being used (video, audio, police reports, etc.);

●  The progress of the case;

●  The general strategy of the defense attorney; and

●  The status of plea negotiations with prosecution (what is the current offer).

Parent’s Attorney Practice Tip: Make it a priority to check in with the criminal 
attorney  for  updates  prior  to  each  statutory  child  welfare  hearing,  if  not  more 
frequently. 

How The Criminal Case Affects the Child Welfare Case
SERVICES OVERLAP

It may be important for the criminal court to determine what services are being provided to 
the parent through the child welfare case. Must they be duplicated or substituted by probation 
services, or are the services being provided in the child welfare case sufficient? Ask the court 
to  allow  consolidation  of  services  as  much  as  possible.  This  is  especially  important  if  the 
transportation and/or time management necessary to comply with a wide array of services are 
challenges for the client.

Parent’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip:  Criminal  cases  involving  domestic  violence 
often  have  bond  or  probation  conditions  that  require  batterer  intervention  classes 
or  components,  which  can  be  used  to  fulfill  requirements  of  a  DFPS  service  plan. 
Attorneys should also look into whether the  conditions  have  a  “ stay  away”  provision 
or if there is an emergency  protective  order  or  full  protective  order  in  place  as 
it  may  cause  additional  issues  in  the  child welfare  case  if  the  victim  is  the  other 
parent.

Most bond or probation conditions will also require drug testing; however, the criminal 
case and civil child welfare cases will likely require independent testing. Caseworkers 
and probation officers  will  often  communicate  after  failed  tests  but  will  want  their 
own tests due to their own specific requirements.

PATTERN OF DANGEROUS CONDUCT

DFPS may use previous criminal convictions and pending charges against the client to show a 
pattern of dangerous behavior. It is important to view any offense reports that the prosecuting 
attorney may have on the client. Any altercation or incident with law enforcement, even if no 
arrest or charge was made, can be used to demonstrate a pattern of conduct that may endanger 
a child.

CONSEQUENCES OF DISPOSITIONS

If a criminal case is concluded or nearing its end, it is imperative to speak with the criminal 
attorney  about  the  possible  implications  of  different  types  of  pleas.  This  is  an  extremely 
impactful  part  of  the  case,  especially  if  a  criminal  charge  is  directly  related  to  the  child 
welfare case. Research and speak with a criminal attorney to better understand criminal case 
dispositions and collateral consequences that may impact the child welfare case.

139

Parents’ Attorney IssuesParent’s Attorney Practice Tip: Construct a timeline with the criminal case dates 
and the statutory deadlines for the child welfare case to better understand how the 
two cases may overlap or exist independently from each other.

FIFTH  AMENDMENT CONSIDERATIONS

Fifth Amendment Does Apply to Civil Cases

The  right  against  self-incrimination  applies  to  both  civil  and  criminal  cases.  McCarthy  v. 
Anderson, 266 U.S. 34 (1924). The application is not dependent on the type of proceeding, but 
on whether  the  answers  to  the  questions  could  subject  the  person  who  answers  to  criminal 
liability in the future. Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70 (1973).

Testifying in a Civil Case

In a civil case, the state has the right to call the opposing party as a witness, but the individual 
retains their right against self-incrimination if they reasonably fear that the answer sought 
may be incriminating. Texas Dept. of Pub. Safety Officers Ass’n v. Denton, 897 S.W.2d 757, 760 
(Tex. 1995)

No Blanket Assertion of Privilege

However, the party may not make a blanket assertion against self-incrimination in a civil case. 
They must assert the privilege in response to each question and the judge rules on whether the 
witness can assert his Fifth Amendment right to a given question. In re Verbois, 10 S.W. 3d 
825, 828 (Tex. App. – Waco 2000).

Negative Inference Allowed

Unlike in a criminal case, the application of the Fifth Amendment in civil cases is not automatic 
and if the witness fails to testify, or fails to answer a question, it may be held against them. 
The fact finder is “free to draw negative inferences from [a witness’s] repeated invocations of 
the Fifth Amendment.” Wilz v. Flournoy, 228 S.W.3d 674, 677 (Tex. 2007).

Parent’s  Attorney  Practice  Tip:  Because  of  the  significant  differences  in  the 
application  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  to  criminal  and  civil  cases,  consult  with  the 
client’s criminal attorney before the client testifies in a DFPS court proceeding.

140

Parents’ Attorney IssuesReinstatement of Parental Rights

Under certain circumstances a parent may petition the court to reinstate their parental rights 
after termination.

Statutes
Tex. Fam. Code §§ 161.301-161.304
Parties That Can File for Reinstatement
 ● DFPS or a single source continuum contractor (SSCC)

 ● The attorney ad litem for the child

 ● A parent whose rights have been involuntarily terminated. 

Practice  Tip:  Since  the  statute  requires  that  the  parent’s  rights  must  have  been 
involuntarily  terminated,  this  may  be  interpreted  to  exclude  parents  who  signed 
affidavits of relinquishment or signed a mediated settlement agreement not to oppose 
termination based on Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(b)(O) or other ground under Section 
161.001.  However,  all  grounds  under  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  161.001  are  listed  under 
“Involuntary  Termination  of  the  Parent-Child  Relationship”  including  Tex.  Fam. 
Code § 161.001(b)(K) (execution of an affidavit of relinquishment) so those parents 
may not be excluded from filing for reinstatement.

Requirements of the Petition 
CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN A PETITION CANNOT BE FILED

A petition for reinstatement cannot be filed if:

 ● It has been less the two years since the parent’s rights were terminated;

 ● The child has been adopted, or is the subject of an adoption placement agreement;

 ● There is a pending appeal; or

 ● It has been less than one year since a court denied a previous petition for reinstatement.

REQUIRED CONTENTS OF THE PETITION

The contents of the petition must be sworn to by the petitioner and must include:

 ● The name of the petitioner;

 ● The name and address of the former parent seeking reinstatement;

 ● The name, date and place of birth, and current residence of the child, if known; 

 ● The  name,  current  residence  address  and  contact  information  for  any  party  that 
participated in the termination hearing and has information relevant to the petition;

 ● A summary of grounds upon which the former parent’s rights were terminated;

 ● A statement of facts and evidence that shows the former parent is rehabilitated and has 
the capacity and willingness to carry out the responsibilities and duties of a parent under 
Tex. Fam. Code § 151.001. Examples of such evidence include:

 ○ mental health treatment,
 ○ substance abuse treatment,

 ○ employment history, or

 ○ other personal history demonstrating rehabilitation.
 ● A summary of prior requests or motions for reinstatement;

 ● A statement by the former parent seeking reinstatement;

 ● If the child is older than 12, a statement of the child’s intent or willingness to consent to 

reinstatement. 

141

Parents’ Attorney IssuesNotice
Notice of the petition must be served on:

 ● The child or child’s representative;

 ● The county attorney;

 ● The child’s attorney ad litem;

 ● DFPS or SSCC, if applicable (if the petitioner is the parent, they must provide 45 days’ 
notice to DFPS of their intent to file and use a form created by the DFPS commissioner. 
Download the Notice of Intent of Former Parent to Petition Court to Reinstate Parental 
Rights form);

 ● The former parent whose parental rights are sought to be reinstated, if they are not the 

petitioner; and

 ● The Tribal representative, if ICWA applies.

Hearing
STATUTE 
Tex. Fam. Code § 161.303
TIMING 

PURPOSE

STANDARD OF PROOF

A hearing must be held no later than 60 days after the filing of the petition. 

For the court to take action regarding whether the parent’s rights should be reinstated. 

The petitioner has the burden of proof. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.303((b). The standard of proof 
required is preponderance of the evidence. Tex. Fam Code § 105.005.

REQUIRED FINDINGS. 

For the court to reinstate the parent’s rights, the court must find that:

 ● Reinstatement of parental rights is in the child’s best interests;

 ● At least two years have passed since the issuance of the order terminating parental rights 

and an appeal of the order is not pending; 

 ● The child has not been adopted and is not the subject of an adoption placement agreement; 

 ● If the child is over 12 years old, that the child consents and desires to reside with the 

parent;

 ● The former parent has remedied the conditions that were grounds for rendering the order 

terminating parental rights; and

 ● The  former  parent  is  willing  and  able  to  perform  parental  duties  as  provided  by  Tex. 
Fam. Code § 151.001 including maintaining the health, safety, and welfare of the child.

If the child is less than 12 when the petition for reinstatement is filed, the court must consider 
the  child’s  age,  maturity,  and  ability  to  express  a  preference  and  may  consider  the  child’s 
preference regarding the reinstatement as one factor in the court’s determination.

COURT ACTION

Grant the petition

142

Parents’ Attorney IssuesIf the court grants the petition after a hearing, the court must issue a written order stating that 
all legal rights, powers, privileges, immunities, duties, and obligations of the former parent 
with respect to the custody, care, control, and support of the child are reinstated.

If the court denies the petition, it must make findings and detail reasons for the denial and 
must issue a statement prohibiting the filing of a subsequent petition for a year from the order 
of denial.

Deny the petition

Defer taking action

The court may defer the decision on the petition and render a temporary order expiring after 
a period of six months during which DFPS remains the managing conservator and the former 
parent is the possessory conservator.

During  the  six-month  time  period,  DFPS  must  monitor  the  possessory  conservatorship  of 
the  former  parent  and  when  the  temporary  order  expires,  the  court  shall  hold  a  hearing  to 
determine whether to grant or deny the petition for reinstatement.

Benefits for Child After Reinstatement
Youth  in  DFPS  conservatorship  are  eligible  for  certain  benefits,  such  as  a  tuition  and  fee 
waiver for attending state higher education institutions, an Education and Training Voucher 
(ETV) to provide financial assistance while attending school, Medicaid eligibility, and waiver 
of fees for state government identification.

Eligibility  for  the  youth  depends  on  a  variety  of  factors  including  the  youth’s  age,  legal 
conservatorship,  and  how  the  youth  exits  DFPS  conservatorship.  If  the  parent’s  rights  are 
reinstated, it may affect the availability of certain benefits for the youth.

TUITION AND FEE WAIVER

If the parent’s rights are reinstated, the child may still be eligible for the tuition and fee waiver 
under the following circumstances:

 ● The child was in DFPS conservatorship on the day of the child’s 14th birthday, if they 

were also eligible for adoption on or after that day; or

 ● The child is 14 years or older on or after June 1, 2016 and left PMC of DFPS to return to 

 ● The child is 16 years or older on or after June 1, 2016 and left TMC of DFPS to return to 

the legal responsibility of a parent; or

the legal responsibility of a parent; or

 ● The child enrolled in a dual credit course or other course in which a high-school student 
may earn joint high school and college credit and was in DFPS conservatorship on the 
day of enrollment; and

 ● The child enrolls in a public higher education institution or in a dual credit course before 

their 25th birthday. Tex. Educ. Code § 54.366; 40 Tex. Admin. Code §700.1630. 

Practice  Tip:  DFPS  Preparation  for  Adult  Living  staff  verify  eligibility  for  the 
tuition and fee waiver, even if the child did not participate in PAL services.

143

Parents’ Attorney IssuesUsing a Trauma-Informed Lens for Interacting with Clients

Interactions with the child welfare system can be traumatizing for children and parents. Both 
children’s and parents’ attorneys may want to be familiar with techniques for interacting with 
clients  who  have  experienced  trauma.  As  of  September  1,  2021,  Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  107.004 
requires attorneys to participate in trauma training to qualify for appointments as an attorney 
ad litem of a child in a child welfare case. The training program must include trauma-informed 
care and the effect of trauma on children in DFPS’ conservatorship. The following information is 
modified content from the Trauma-Informed Legal Advocacy Project. Please see the Additional 
Resources section in this tool kit for more information.

Legal Interviewing & Traumatic Triggers
CONSIDER THE PERSPECTIVE OF PARENTS AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE 
EXPERIENCED TRAUMA

A  person  may  feel  distracted,  anxious,  and  agitated  and  thus  unable  to  meaningfully 
participate in an interview or conversation or may actively prevent a productive conversation 
from occurring. Trauma triggers are one factor that may explain why a child or parent client 
is having trouble connecting with others, including their own attorney. A trigger is something 
that  evokes  a  memory  of  past  traumatizing  events,  including  the  feelings,  sensations,  or 
memories associated with those experiences. Encountering triggers may cause someone to feel 
uneasy, afraid, or withdrawn even without them being consciously aware of these reactions. 
A trigger can make someone feel as if they are reliving a traumatic experience and can elicit 
a fight, flight, or freeze response. Many things can be a possible trigger for someone who has 
experienced trauma. A person might be triggered by a particular color of clothing, by the smell 
of  a  certain  food,  by  certain  phrases  or  behaviors,  by  their  surroundings,  by  an  individual’s 
gender, by authority figures, or by the time of year. Internal sensations, such as rapid heartbeat, 
nausea, or tightened muscles can be triggers as well, or the person may feel nauseous or have 
other physical reactions ranging from being combative to shutting down.

A trigger may be associated with the traumatic experience without their conscious awareness 
and the client may not know why they are feeling or reacting a certain way. Children or adults 
who are triggered by traumatic memories may also appear bored or uninterested, talk about 
things in a flat or unemotional way, have a blank stare and spacey look, or appear to be shut down 
or checked out. They may ramble, avoid conversation, or deflect with humor. Their answers to 
questions may be slow and incomplete. Additionally, many families and communities involved 
with DFPS have been deeply affected by negative experiences with legal and administrative 
systems, such as criminal justice, immigration, and education systems. For these reasons, a 
client may distrust the child welfare system and anyone they associate with it.

WAYS TO PREVENT A CLIENT FROM FEELING TRIGGERED

Offer Options in the Physical Space

Offer choices of where to meet; which chair they can use; and whether a nearby door is closed, 
open,  or  slightly  ajar.  Consider  whether  slight  adjustments  can  be  made  to  accommodate 
multiple seating options. For example:

“Which chair would be most comfortable for you?” 

“Would you prefer the door closed or slightly open?” 

“Is this room ok, or would you prefer to talk in another room or maybe outside?
“Do you feel safe in this space? If not, what would make you feel safe and comfortable?”

“Do you feel safe with a male/female attorney?” “Would you feel safer with an attorney 
of a different gender?”

At the same time, be aware that sometimes options can be overwhelming to someone who is 
not accustomed to being given many choices. Be flexible and follow your client’s preferences. 

145

Trauma-Informed AdvocacyEncourage Self-Regulation

Experiencing trauma can disrupt a person’s ability to manage emotions and calm themselves 
when they are starting to feel upset. Self-regulation may include listening to music, going for 
a walk, playing with a dog or cat, or simply taking a break. In the context of a legal meeting, 
options  are  more  limited,  but  some  strategies  that  may  help  a  client  self-regulate  include 
doodling  or  coloring,  fidgeting  with  toys  or  other  objects,  offering  food  or  snacks,  looking  at 
calming pictures, and drinking water. If you make it clear to your client that their physical, 
mental, and emotional safety comes first, it can help you accomplish the goals of the meeting. 

Explain Things in Advance

For people who have experienced trauma, it can be helpful to know in advance what is going to 
happen, who is going to be involved, and the scope of their participation. This includes telling 
someone how much time their attorney has available to meet with them, which can also help 
build trust. It can also be helpful to tell someone the types of matters that will be discussed 
during the meeting. For example:

“We  have  about  a  half  an  hour  to  talk  today.  I’d  like  to  hear  you  talk  about  what 
happened when DFPS came to your home. Is that ok with you?”

“I’m going to ask you some questions, and you can ask me questions at any time. Then 
we’ll go over some of the paperwork DFPS gave you and I’ll explain what it means. It 
should take about an hour, but we can take a break whenever you need to.” 

Offer Breaks

Taking breaks throughout a meeting can help the client stay present and engaged as well as 
feel physically and emotionally safe. 

Be Thoughtful About Note-Taking

Ask permission to take notes, specify what you’re transcribing, and summarize the notes for 
your client at the end of the meeting. This can help keep build trust and rapport with your 
client. Also, do not allow your note taking to detract from being present with someone.

WHAT CAN HELP IF A CLIENT APPEARS TRIGGERED?

Notice and Validate their Feelings

Noticing and validating a client’s feelings can help them to become aware of what is happening 
with them emotionally if they are not already aware. It also lets the client know their attorney 
cares about their emotional safety. This matters in part because these actions contradict what 
happens in many traumatic incidents, where a person’s feelings of anxiety and fear are often 
ignored and dismissed, or where showing these feelings may be met with increased violence. 
Noticing and validating the client’s feelings includes allowing the client to move through their 
feelings at their own pace. For example:

“That sounds really scary.” 

“I can only imagine how hurtful that felt.”

“That sounds overwhelming for anyone to deal with.”

It’s important to be sincere but to remain within boundaries. Clients can detect when empathy 
seems empty or fake, but over empathizing with your client’s feelings (“I experienced something 
exactly like that”) risks making the conversation about you and not them. 

146

Trauma-Informed AdvocacyAsk What Would Help

When  making  suggestions,  offer  several  options  whenever  possible,  rather  than  just  asking 
“yes or no” questions. Asking someone how to help them when they seem triggered also reflects 
the relationship as a partnership of equal respect. For example:

“Let me know if I can get you a glass of water, or we can just sit together for a moment.” 

“Would it help to have a moment to yourself or visit with your friend in the waiting 
room, or maybe something else?”

Use Open Body Language

If  the  client  is  very  upset  and  agitated,  it  can  be  helpful  for  the  attorney  to  use  open  body 
language  so  that  the  client  knows  that  their  attorney  does  not  pose  a  threat.  This  includes 
keeping shoulders relaxed, keeping body posture and hands open and relaxed, and avoiding 
blocking the client from being able to exit or walk away.

Help the Client to Get Grounded in the Present

If a client seems anxious or uncomfortable, it may be because they feel they are unsafe in the 
current environment. There are tools to help a client feel safe and grounded in the present. 
Some  examples  include  helping  the  client  notice  their  breath,  their  physical  presence,  or 
physical things in the environment. For example:

“You know we can sit here on this bench for as long as we need to. We are okay right 
now,  you and me. We can just take our time, no one is going to bother us here.”

“Is it hard for you to focus on these questions? When that happens, some people say it 
helps  them to just take a minute to notice themselves breathing in and out.”

BUILDING TRUST AND UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF TRAUMA

What is Happening from the Perspective of Parents and Children  
Involved with the Child Welfare System?

There  are  many  reasons  why  someone  might  not  share  information,  some  of  which  may  be 
related  to  experiencing  trauma.  Experiencing  abuse,  especially  by  a  trusted  person,  can 
make it difficult to trust people in the future. Of course, someone’s hesitations about sharing 
information may also reflect an awareness of real danger that the information shared will be 
held  against  them  in  court.  Another  reason  that  someone  may  not  share  information  right 
away is that they do not remember the information, or they can’t recall it in the way that it is 
being asked for.

Survivors of trauma do not always remember their experiences in chronological order or may 
have blocked out the memory entirely as a coping mechanism. On the other hand, survivors 
of trauma may remember events, but they may ascribe different meaning to the events than 
are reflected in legal definitions of abuse. Often, when someone experiences a traumatic event, 
the person may seem distant or they might dissociate, which means there is a change in their 
consciousness which disturbs the normally connected functions of identity, memory, thoughts, 
feelings, and experiences. Their understanding of what is happening and their experience of 
what is happening become disconnected. This is a protective coping mechanism that can keep 
someone  emotionally  safe  during  traumatic  events,  but  it  can  affect  the  person’s  ability  to 
recall those events, or other events that occur when the person experiences a traumatic trigger.

For a person who is agitated or disconnected because of a traumatic trigger, traumatic memory, 
or simply by being in an environment that does not feel safe to them, building a connection and 
developing trust are key to helping the person regulate their emotions and responses.

147

Trauma-Informed AdvocacyWhat Might Help Create Trust with the Client?

 ● Sharing  your  mission  statement  explaining  your  personal  reasons  for  choosing  to 

represent parents and children in DFPS cases.

 ● Being transparent with the client. For example,

 ○ being transparent about limitations on time and resources.

“I’m really glad you called. I have about five minutes to talk right now. If we 
need more time, we can schedule another call.”

 ○ being transparent about the need for and use of information.

“Is there any reason why DFPS might say you were neglectful? The reason I’m 
asking is so that we can prepare together for every possible thing that DFPS 
might say, not because I don’t believe you.”

 ● Understanding fluctuations in the client’s level of trust in their attorney over time.

Keep in mind that sharing personal information, such as details about experiences of abuse, 
can make someone feel vulnerable, especially if they have not shared that information before. 
Thus, in some cases, someone might share a lot about themselves in a meeting and then become 
more guarded, withdraw from the relationship, or even stop responding to calls altogether. As 
the relationship develops, the client may want to share more information, or they may even 
change parts of their story.

What Might Help a Client with Memory Recall?

Reminding  or  emphasizing  the  confidentiality  of  the  attorney-client  relationship  can  help 
establish a sense of safety. Use open-ended questions, if necessary, to gently facilitate more 
detail. Lay out topics in broad terms. If the client is a parent, the best approach is to start by 
letting the client tell their story from start to finish. If the client is a child, do not elicit details 
of abuse or neglect from the child, since discussions about abuse or neglect should occur with a 
trauma-informed mental health professional. 

Preparing a Client for Court
Being involuntarily separated from a parent or child can be a traumatic experience. As the 
client  approaches  the  hearing  date,  they  may  experience  anxiety,  sleep  deprivation,  and 
exhaustion. At court, parents may see the caseworker who made the decision to remove their 
children, which may be a triggering event for them. Parents and children may be seeing each 
other for the first time since removal. Encountering such reminders of trauma may cause the 
client to feel uneasy, afraid, or terrified, and they may re-experience what they felt when they 
were initially traumatized.

TOOLS FOR EMOTIONALLY PREPARING CLIENTS FOR COURT

 ● Offer a Tour of the Court Building Ahead of Time. Describe the logistical and spatial 
details of  attending  court,  including where parties will wait before court opens, where 
they will take breaks, who will be in the courtroom, and the location of restrooms. There 
is  a  balance  between  giving  someone  enough  information  to  help  them  know  what  to 
expect and giving them too much information, which could potentially overwhelm them. 
Let your client be the guide. If possible, take a tour of the courtroom itself.

 ● Identify Your Client’s Supporters. Encourage the client to bring someone appropriate 
to court with them and explain local rules for courtroom decorum. If there is no family 
member or friend who can attend, suggest they ask someone they know through a support 
group, social activity, or church group to accompany them. If no one is available to attend 
in person, friends or family can show that they are there in spirit by sending notes and 
messages of support or trinkets that can be kept close. If a client has very limited support, 
they may want to find a peer support group such as the DFPS Parent Collaborative. 

148

Trauma-Informed AdvocacyIf the client is seeing a therapist, it may help to have an appointment scheduled with the 
therapist as soon as possible after the hearing.

 ● Suggest  Making  a  “Night  Before”  Plan.  Not  sleeping  and  not  eating  can  have  an 
impact on our ability to manage our emotions, but when a client is anxious, they may 
have a hard time doing both. Acknowledging to someone that this is often the case can 
help them to decide how they want to prepare. If unable to address these issues the night 
before, check in with the client prior to the hearing to see if they have had a meal and 
help them locate food options in the courthouse.

 ● Offer to Help Make a “What If ” Plan.  Consider asking the client whether they think 
anything  about  the  court  proceedings  might  be  particularly  difficult  or  triggering  for 
them and make a plan for how to respond. Encourage the client to practice self- calming 
techniques prior to the day of court so that these become automatic and easier to access 
when stress makes it hard to think. Always follow the lead of the client to see how much 
they want to plan.

 ● Make a Plan for  Dealing  with  Stress  at  Court.  It can help to ask the court for a 
recess when the client feels they need one or when observing them experiencing a trauma 
response.  While  on  break,  validate  their  feelings.  Acknowledge  that  what’s  happening 
may be very upsetting and that they are doing a great job. Sometimes just silently being 
with someone for a few minutes can help them to calm themselves and prepare to continue.

Avoiding Burnout and Practicing Self-Care
An attorney’s office may be the first place where a client can safely show frustration and anger. 
This  may  cause  attorneys  to  feel  unappreciated  or  perceive  the  client  as  “demanding”  and 
“difficult.” Over time, attorneys may feel that working with challenging clients in this complex 
area of law might be too difficult. 

CHALLENGES OF DOING EMPATHIC WORK 

Burnout includes exhaustion, cynicism, and ineffectiveness.

Secondary  Trauma  (sometimes  called  vicarious  trauma)  refers  to  the  effects  of  working 
empathically with and feeling responsibility toward people who have survived the trauma of 
abuse, violation, and discrimination.

Consider whether working on these cases made it harder as an attorney to:

 ● Feel positive about the work.

 ● Feel competent.

 ● Get things done and feel productive.

 ● Stay positive.

 ● Stay calm and manage emotions.

 ● Feel safe.

 ● Trust the client, or trust others.

SELF-CARE STRATEGIES

 ● Keep in mind that this may be the first time the client felt safe enough to show emotion.
 ● Set boundaries with clients.

 ● Plan out specific times to work on challenging cases.

 ● Keep positive thoughts in mind about the attorney’s role in the case.

 ● Ask a co-worker or colleague to remind you about positive aspects of the work.

149

Trauma-Informed Advocacy ● Take time to reflect on personal feelings and responses, both in the context of individual 

interactions and after big successes or losses.

 ● Use calming or grounding techniques for yourself during phone calls (e.g., coloring, fidget 

 ● Use a checklist to remember when interacting with clients, such as not to take things 

tools).

personally, etc.

 ● Utilize additional support to help the client (e.g., connect them with a therapist or the 

DFPS Parent Collaboration Groups).

 ● Utilize available assistance such as the Texas Lawyers Assistance Program (TLAP).

 ○ The program provides confidential help for law students, lawyers, and judges 
who have  challenges related to substance use and mental health issues. TLAP 
can be reached online or by phone by dialing 1-800-343-TLAP or text TLAP to

Trauma-Informed AdvocacyIndian Child Welfare Act (ICWA)

Purpose
The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA) is a federal law that imposes special standards 
and requirements when a child welfare agency seeks to intervene to protect an “Indian child” as 
defined by statute. The law was enacted to protect not only Indian children, but their families 
and Tribes.

Statutes
Federal statutes governing ICWA are 25 U.S.C. §§1901-1963; 25 C.F.R. Part 23 Guidelines for 
Implementing the Indian Child Welfare Act (Bureau  of  Indian Affairs, 2016).  Relevant  state 
statutes are Tex. Fam. Code §§ 262.201(f), 263.202(f-1), 263.306(a-1)(3).

When Does ICWA Apply?
ICWA applies to any “child custody proceeding” involving an “Indian child,” if the court “knows 
or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved.” 25 U.S.C. § 1912(a).

*Please note that a case challenging the constitutionality of multiple elements of ICWA, Brackeen 
v.  Haaland,  is  set  for  oral  arguments  before  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States  in  the 
October Term 2022.

CHILD CUSTODY PROCEEDINGS

A  suit  seeking  foster  care  placement,  termination  of  parental  rights,  pre-adoptive,  or  an 
adoptive  placement  is  subject  to  ICWA.  ICWA  does  not  apply  to  most  juvenile  delinquency 
actions. It also does not apply to custody actions in divorce or separation proceedings (unless 
custody  may  be  awarded  to  a  non-parent),  nor  to  Court  Ordered  Services  cases  under  Tex. 
Fam. Code § 264.203. 

INDIAN CHILD 

An “Indian child” is a child who is either:

 ● An unmarried person under age 18 who is either a member of an Indian Tribe; or

 ● Eligible for membership and the biological child of a member. 25 U.S.C. § 1903(4).

There are more than 500 federally recognized Tribes and children from any of these Tribes can 
be found in Texas. There are also three federally recognized Tribes with tribal reservations in 
Texas:

 ● Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, also known as the Tigua, in El Paso;

 ● Kickapoo Tribe of Texas, in Eagle Pass; and

 ● Alabama Coushatta Tribe of Texas, near Livingston.

A child residing on a reservation has specific legal protections 25 U.S.C. § 1911(a), and, in some 
cases, DFPS and the Tribe have a written protocol for handling these cases.

While it is the responsibility of DFPS to notify any Tribe identified by the family in order to 
confirm or deny a child’s status as an “Indian child” under ICWA, attorneys for parents and 
children should inquire about the possibility of Native American heritage and inform the court 
of any such information if it becomes known to them.

REASON TO KNOW AN INDIAN CHILD IS INVOLVED IN THE CASE 

A court has reason to know a child is an Indian child if:

 ● Any party, Tribe, or agency informs the agency or court that the child is an Indian child;

151

Federal Law ● Any  participant,  officer  of  the  court  or  agency  involved  in  the  proceedings  informs  the 

court it has discovered such information;

 ● The child gives the court reason to know he or she is an Indian child;

 ● The domicile or residence of the child, parent or Indian custodian is on a reservation;

 ● The court is informed the child is or has been a ward of a Tribal court; or

 ● The  court  is  informed  either  parent  or  the  child  has  a  Tribal  membership  card.  25 

C.F.R. § 23.107(c).

Texas  courts  are  required  to  ask  the  parties  whether  the  child  or  child’s  family  has  Native 
American heritage and to identify any Native American Tribe the child may be associated with 
at the Adversary, Status, and Permanency Hearings. Tex. Fam. Code §§ 262.201(f), 263.202(f-
1), 263.306(a-1)(3).

If the court knows or has “reason to know” that an “Indian child” is the subject of a child welfare 
suit, DFPS must give each parent and identified Tribe and any Indian custodian (caretaker) 
notice of ICWA rights. 25 U.S.C. § 1912(a).

Practice Tip:  In every case, attorneys for parents and children should confirm that 
every  parent,  extended  family  member,  and  any  child  old  enough  has  been  asked 
whether there is any Native American family heritage. The Court must also instruct 
the parties to inform the court of any such information that arises later. 25 C.F.R. § 
23.107(a).

What Changes if the Case is Identified as an ICWA Case?
INITIAL HEARING

A hearing must be held where DFPS must show by clear and convincing evidence, including 
testimony of a qualified expert witness, that the parent’s continued custody “is likely to result in 
serious emotional or physical damage to the child,” to warrant a foster care placement. 25 U.S.C.§ 
1912(e). This finding cannot be made until 10 days after notice of ICWA has been provided and 
is subject to a 20-day extension on request of a parent or Tribe. To avoid the need to continue 
the hearing, the best practice is to set this hearing at least 30 days out. ICWA also requires that 
DFPS make “active efforts” to reunify among other legal requirements.

Note: The hearing must occur no matter how far along in the case the confirmation is made that 
the child is an “Indian child.”

PLEADINGS  

If ICWA applies, DFPS  should plead concurrently under the Family Code and ICWA.  In  the 
jurisdiction  of  the  Houston  14th  District  Court  of  Appeals,  however,  pleadings  should  be 
limited to the ICWA findings, without parallel Family Code pleadings. In re W.D.H., 43 S.W.3d 
30 (Tex. App.—Houston 2001, pet. denied).

BURDEN OF PROOF

Foster Care Placement – Clear and Convincing Evidence

Including qualified  expert witness (QEW)  testimony  that continued  custody by  the parent  or 
Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child and 
active  efforts  to  provide remedial  and  rehabilitative  services  to  prevent  the  breakup  of  the 
Indian family were made by DFPS and proved unsuccessful. 25 U.S.C. § 1912(d).

152

Federal LawTermination of Parental Rights – Evidence Beyond a Reasonable Doubt

Including qualified expert testimony that continued custody by the parent or Indian custodian 
is likely  to  result  in  serious  emotional  or  physical  damage  to  the  child  and  active  efforts  to 
provide remedial and rehabilitative services to prevent the breakup of the Indian family were 
made by DFPS but proved unsuccessful. 25 U.S.C. § 1912(f).

PLACEMENT

ICWA mandates that placements for foster care and adoption be made according to statutory 
preferences, unless good cause is shown to deviate from the preferences. 25 U.S.C. § 1915; 25 
C.F.R. § 23.129-131. 

The statutory preferences give priority as follows: 

Foster Care or Pre-Adoptive Placement
 ● A member of the child’s extended family;

 ● A foster home licensed, approved, or specified by child’s Tribe;
 ● An  Indian  foster  home  licensed  or  approved  by  an  authorized  non-Indian  licensing 

authority; or

 ● An institution for children approved by the Tribe or operated by an Indian organization 
which has a program suitable to meet the child’s needs. 25 U.S.C. § 1915(b); 25 C.F.R. § 
23.131(b).

For an Adoptive Placement

 ● A member of the child’s extended family;

 ● Other members of the child’s Tribe; or

 ● Other Indian families. 25 U.S.C. § 1915(a); 25 C.F.R. § 23.130.

Departing from ICWA Preferences

The  Tribe  can  by  resolution  alter  the  order  of  preferences.  25  U.S.C.  §  1915(c).  The  Tribe’s 
preference should then be followed as long as it is still the least restrictive setting appropriate 
to the needs of the child.

A party seeking to depart from the placement preferences must show by clear and convincing 
evidence, on the record or in writing, that there is “good cause” to depart from the placement 
preferences.

MANDATORY TRANSFER TO TRIBAL COURT

A parent, an Indian custodian, or the child’s Tribe may petition the state court to transfer a 
suit involving an Indian child to the Tribal court. Transfer to the Tribal court is mandatory, 
unless the court makes a finding of good cause not to transfer, the Tribe declines transfer, or 
either parent objects. 25 U.S.C. § 1911(b); 25 C.F.R. § 23.117. 

The court cannot consider the following factors in assessing good cause: 

 ● The  advanced  stage  of  the  proceedings,  if  notice  to  the  Tribe  did  not  occur  until  an 

advanced stage; 

 ● Whether there was no petition to transfer in a prior proceeding involving the child; 

 ● Whether transfer would affect the child’s placement; 

 ● The child’s cultural connections with the Tribe or its reservation; or 

 ● The socio-economic conditions of the Tribe, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) social services, 

or the judicial systems. 25 C.F.R. § 23.118(c).

153

Federal LawRIGHT TO INTERVENE

The Tribe and the Indian custodian have the right to intervene in the state court action at any 
time  in  the  proceedings.  25  U.S.C.  §  1911(c).  Intervention  may  be  accomplished  informally, 
by oral statement,  or  formally.  Most important, if an Indian child is involved, ICWA applies 
whether or not the child’s Tribe intervenes. 

Who is a Qualified Expert Witness (QEW)?
The statute does not define what constitutes a qualified expert under ICWA. The Regulations 
require that an expert be qualified to testify as to whether the child’s continued custody by the 
parent or custodian is “likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage,” and direct that 
an expert should be qualified to testify as to the “prevailing social and cultural standards” of the 
child’s Tribe. 25 C.F.R. § 23.122. The social worker assigned to the child’s case may not serve as 
an expert (although a caseworker may testify otherwise, as to the parent’s compliance with the 
service plan, visitation, and other issues).

Without question, the child’s Tribe is the best source for an expert. Understandably, many tribal 
members do not want to take a position in a court proceeding adverse to a fellow tribal member 
and  with  very  small  Tribes,  the  pool  of  potential  experts  is  limited.  Courts  with  capability 
should allow participation by phone, video conferencing, or other methods. 25 C.F.R. § 23.133.

ICWA Finding is Essential
The best practice is to request in every child welfare case that the trial court make a finding on 
the record as to whether ICWA applies. If the record is silent, a party may raise the issue on 
appeal, and an appellate court may remand the case for purpose of making this finding. By far 
the most significant impact of failing to identify an ICWA case is that if key ICWA provisions  
are violated, a final order can be invalidated. The remedy for violation of key ICWA provisions 
is a petition to invalidate. 25 U.S.C. § 1914. Similarly, if there is not sufficient information in 
the record to assess whether ICWA applies, an appeal can be abated. 

154

Federal LawInterstate Placements (ICPC)

What is the ICPC?
If a child may be placed in another state, the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children 
(ICPC) may require approval from that state. (See Tex. Fam. Code Ch. 162, Subchapter B.) 
When the ICPC applies, child protective services in the receiving state provides an assessment 
before a placement and monitoring after a placement. This is a multi-step administrative process 
between the sending and receiving states and can take some time to complete.

When does the ICPC Apply?
Generally,  ICPC  applies  to  placements  for  adoption  or  foster  care,  and  in  group  homes  or 
residential placement.

When does the ICPC not Apply?

 ● Birth parents placing with a non-custodial birth parent, or a relative as long as no court 

has assumed jurisdiction of the child to be placed;

 ● Relatives placing with birth parents or another relative as long as no court has assumed 

jurisdiction of the child to be placed;

 ● If a child is being placed in a hospital or school;

 ● Tribal Placements;

 ● Visits, as long as they meet the required criteria.

Practice Tip:  The ICPC is not a fast process. Any attorney can request a court order 
for an expedited ICPC in certain circumstances. Note that this expedites the process 
on the Texas DFPS end, but it does not expedite the ICPC process in the receiving 
state.

Visits Outside Texas
A visit is excluded from the ICPC under Regulation 9 of the ICPC Regulations if it is for brief 
social or cultural experience; and

 ● The visit has a definite end date; and

 ● The visit is no longer than 30 days, or begins and ends within a school vacation; and

 ● There has been no request for a home study or supervision.

Expedited Requests for Placement with a Relative
An  expedited  order  requires  an  approval  or  denial  within  20  business  days.  A  judge  can 
sign an order for an expedited placement under Regulation 7 of the ICPC Regulations if the 
proposed placement is with a parent (subject to non-custodial parent policy below), stepparent, 
grandparent,  adult  uncle  or  aunt,  adult  sibling,  or  legal  guardian,  and  one  of  the  following 
criteria apply:

 ● The  child  was  unexpectedly  placed  in  foster  care  because  the  parent/guardian  was 
recently incarcerated; is unable to care for the child due to a medical, mental, or physical 
condition; or is recently deceased;

 ● The  child  is  four  years  of  age  or younger,  and  can  include  older  siblings  sought  to  be 

placed with the same proposed placement;

 ● The  court  finds  that  the  child  or  sibling  has  a  substantial  relationship  with  the 

proposed placement; or

 ● The child is currently in an emergency placement.

155

Federal LawPlacement with a Non-Custodial Parent
State  courts  throughout  the  nation  have  reached  different  conclusions  on  whether  ICPC 
procedures apply when courts place a child with an out of state biological parent. Texas courts 
had  followed  the  Association  of  Administers  of  the  Interstate  Compact  on  the  Placement  of 
Children (AAICPC) Regulations that state ICPC procedures do apply to placement with parents 
in  certain  circumstances  However,  in  2017,  the  Fourth  Court  of  Appeals  rejected  outright 
application of the ICPC to an out-of-state parent. In the Interest of C.R.-A.A., 521 S.W.3d 893 
(Tex. App. — San Antonio, no pet.). 

To address child safety in this circumstance, DFPS policy requires the caseworker to assess an 
out-of-state parent without using the ICPC. CPS Handbook 4513.1. If the assessment reveals 
no concerns, the court can place the child and dismiss the case as to that child without further 
monitoring.  If  the  assessment  reveals  concerns,  DFPS  must  request  a  noticed  hearing  and 
prove the parent’s unfitness in order to invoke the ICPC. CPS Handbook 4513.13.

Federal LawSpecial Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS)

Statutes
8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J)

8 C.F.R. § 204.11

United States Customs and Immigration Service (USCIS) Policy Manual 

What is Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS)?

Federal law permits eligible foster children to “self-petition” for a Special Immigrant Juvenile 
visa, which is the first of a two-step process required to obtain permanent resident status (a 
“green card”). 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J).

What  Does  a  State  Court  Have  to  Do  with  a  Foster  Child’s 
Immigration Status?
Federal law requires a predicate order from a family court (or other court with jurisdiction over 
the custody and care of juveniles such as a DFPS proceeding) before a child can apply for SIJS. 
The family court or DFPS court order must include three findings:

 ● That the child has been “declared a dependent of the court or has been placed by the court 
under the custody of a state agency or an individual or entity appointed by the court;”

 ● That reunification of the child with one or both parents “is not viable as a result of abuse, 

neglect or abandonment or a similar basis found under state law;” and

 ● That it is “not in the child’s best interest to be returned to the parent or child’s country of 

origin or last habitual residence.”

USCIS policy now requires evidence of the factual basis for these statutory findings, in order 
to  demonstrate  that  the  order  is  bona  fide,  and  not  requested  primarily  for  the  purpose  of 
immigration relief. For this reason, all SIJ orders should reference the facts underlying each 
finding.

In addition, USCIS construes “lack of viable reunification” to mean “that the court intends its 
finding that the child cannot reunify with their parent (or parents) remains in effect until the 
child ages out of the juvenile court’s jurisdiction.” USCIS Policy Manual, Vol. 6, Part J., Ch. 2. 
D.2.

If a child or youth has a SIJS order obtained before these policy changes, it may be necessary 
to request an amended SIJS order.

Practice Tip:  If a child or youth in foster care was not born in the U.S., the attorney 
for the child or the child’s parent should check with the caseworker to find out if:

 ● Notice has been sent to the foreign consulate;

 ● Repatriation or placement in the home country is viable; or

 ● The child may need assistance to obtain immigration status or U.S. citizenship. 
It  is  important  to  start  the  process  as  soon  as  possible  due  to  the  lengthy 
timeline and the serious risks and limitations that impact an undocumented 
youth or young adult.

immigration  issues.  See  Texas  Practice  Guide  for  CPS  Attorneys,  Section  13,  Citizenship  & 
Immigration Issues, DFPS Staff List.

158

Federal LawSchool Stability Under Federal & State Law

School is often a source of stability as well as a place for academic and social development of 
children and youth in foster care. If a child has been removed from their home or is changing 
placements,  consider  the  potential  impact  on  the  child’s  education  and  what  efforts  can  be 
made to keep the child in the same school, if possible.

Statutes
Fostering  Connections  to  Success  and  Increasing  Adoptions  Act,  43  U.S.C.  §  675  et  seq. 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) 20 U.S.C. § 6301 et seq. The Individuals with Disabilities 
Education  Act  (IDEA)  20  U.S.C.  §  1400  et  seq.;  34  C.F.R.  Part  300  Texas  Education  Code, 
Texas Family Code.

Requirements  for  School  Stability

 ● A child’s initial placement into care and any subsequent placement changes must take into 
account the appropriateness of the child’s educational setting and the proximity to the 
school the child is enrolled in at the time of the placement or placement change. 42 U.S.C. 
§ 675(1)(G)(i).

 ● DFPS must coordinate with school districts to ensure that the child remains in the same 
school  the  child  was  attending  at  the  time  of  the  initial  placement  or  any  subsequent 
move, unless it is not in the child’s best interests to remain in that school. 42 U.S.C. § 
675(1)(G)(ii)(I), 20 U.S.C. § 6311(g)(1)(E)(i).

 ● DFPS and the school district must collaborate to ensure that the child is transported to 

the previous school, if necessary. 20 U.S.C. § 6312(c)(5)(B).

 ● If  remaining  in  the  prior  school  is  not  in  the  child’s  best  interest,  the  child  must  be 
immediately  enrolled  in  a  new  school,  even  without  records  normally  required  for 
enrollment. 42 U.S.C. § 675(1)(G)(ii)(II), 20 U.S.C. § 6311 (g)(1)(E)(ii).

 ● DFPS must ensure the child’s education records are provided to the new school within 30 
days. State law requires that the child’s school records are transferred to the new school 
not later than the 10th working day after the date the student begins enrollment at the new 
school. Tex. Educ. Code §§ 25.002(g), 25.007(b)(1).

 ● The  child  is  entitled  to  attend  public  school  in  the  district  in  which  the  foster  parents 
reside,  free  of  any  charge  to  the  foster  parents  or  the  agency.  A  durational  residence 
requirement may not be used to prohibit a child from fully participating in any activity 
sponsored by the school district, including extracurricular activities. Tex. Educ. Code § 
25.001(f).

 ● The child is also entitled to continue to attend the school he or she was enrolled in before 
entering conservatorship, or at the time of a placement change, without payment of tuition, 
until he or she completes the highest grade offered at the school at the time of placement. 
The child is entitled to continue to attend the school even if the child leaves conservatorship. 
Tex. Educ. Code § 25.001(g)-(g-1).

Special Education Services

 ● If a child with a disability who is eligible to receive special education services transfers to a 
new school district during the school year, the new district must schedule an Admission, 
Review,  and  Dismissal  (ARD)  meeting  within  30  days  and  provide  the  child services 
comparable to those described in the child’s Individual Educational Program (IEP) from 
the previous district until the new district either adopts the child’s previous IEP or develops 
a new IEP, or, if the transfer is from another state, until the new district conducts an 
evaluation (if it determines it is necessary) and develops a new IEP. 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)
(2)(C)(i), Tex. Educ. Code § 25.007(9), 19 Tex. Admin. Code § 89.1050(j).

159

Federal Law ● If the child does not receive special education but a disability is suspected, the child must 
be  referred  for  a  special  education  evaluation.  An  evaluation  may  be  initiated  by any 
person involved in the education or care of the student. 20 U.S.C. § 1414(a)(1).

 ● Children eligible to receive special education services must have a parent identified to make 
related decisions. If a parent does not retain education decision-making rights, the child 
is placed in a foster home, and the foster parent is willing and able, the foster parent will 
serve as parent for special education decision-making purposes. Otherwise, a surrogate 
parent must be appointed by the school, and can be appointed by the court, to make special 
education decisions on behalf of the child. Tex. Educ. Code §§ 29.015; 29.0151; Tex. Fam. 
Code 263.0025.

Responsibilities of DFPS, the Court, and Other Parties 

 ● A  child’s  attorney  ad  litem  and  guardian  ad  litem  are  required  to  determine  whether 
the child’s educational needs and goals have been identified and addressed before each 
scheduled Permanency Hearing. Tex. Fam. Code §§ 107.002(i), 107.004(d-2).

 ● DFPS must designate an individual to make the day-to-day educational decisions for a 
child in conservatorship, and must provide that individual’s name (as well as the name 
of  any  surrogate  parent  appointed  for  the  child  for  special  education  decision-making 
purposes, if applicable) to the court and the child’s school within five days after the initial 
Adversary Hearing, and must update the court in the next permanency progress report if 
there are any changes to the education decision-maker or surrogate parent. Tex. Fam. 
Code § 263.004.

 ● DFPS must notify the child’s attorney ad litem, CASA volunteer, caregiver, and education 
decision-maker  of  any  notification  from  the  school  regarding  a  significant  school  event 
such as disciplinary action, referral to special education, or other event. Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 264.018(a)(5)(D), Tex. Educ. Code § 25.007(b)(10).

 ● The court is required at each Permanency Hearing to determine whether an education 
decision-maker for the child has been identified, whether the child’s education needs and 
goals have been identified and addressed, and whether there have been major changes 
in the child’s school performance or any serious disciplinary events. Tex.  Fam.  Code  §§ 
263.306(a-1)(5)(G), 263.5031((a)(4)(J).

 ● If  a  caregiver  desires  to  educate  the  child  in  a  home  setting,  DFPS  may  ask  the 
court  to  make  a  finding  that  home-schooling  is  not  in  the  best  interests  of  a  child  in 
conservatorship because it does not meet the child’s academic and social needs and goals. 
Tex. Fam. Code § 263.0045.

160

Federal LawServicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)

The SCRA provides certain protections for servicemembers involved in a civil action, including 
a child custody proceeding, while the member is in the military or within 90 days after release 
from the military.

Statute
50 U.S.C. §3901 et seq.

Missing Parent
If  a  parent  has  not  appeared  in  a  child  custody  suit,  whether  or  not  this  is  due  to  military 
service, DFPS must file An Affidavit of Military Service (available in the Practice Guide for 
CPS Attorneys, Section 13, Servicemembers Civil Relief Act). 50 U.S.C.S. § 3931(b)(1). The best 
practice is to request a search of the military database before the Status Hearing, if any parent 
has not been located.

The DFPS diligent search unit includes a search of the US Military Database and the certificate 
of military service or non-service in the FINDRS Report provided to a requestor. Alternatively, 
a search can be performed on the U.S. military website. Note that a search requires a parent’s 
date of birth, last name and first name or initial, and ideally, social security number.

A search of the military database will generally result in either a Certificate of Non-Service, or 
a Certificate of Service. The Certificate should be attached to an Affidavit of Military Service, 
provided to parties and counsel of record, and filed with the court.

Default Judgment
If a parent has not appeared in a child welfare suit, no default judgment can be taken unless:

 ● DFPS  has  filed  an  Affidavit  of  Military  Service  with  a  Certificate  of  Service  or  Non- 

Service; and

 ● An attorney has been appointed for the parent. 50 U.S.C. § 3931(b)(2).

If the court determines there may be a defense which cannot be presented without the parent’s 
presence or the attorney has been unable to contact the parent after exercising due diligence, 
the court shall grant a stay for at least 90 days. 50 U.S.C. § 3931(d).

After Notice
If a parent in the military has notice of a child custody suit, the court on its own motion may 
stay the suit, or on request of the servicemember, the court shall stay the action for at least 90 
days, if there is proof that the military duty materially affects the servicemember’s ability to 
appear, and the servicemember provides a letter stating a date when the servicemember will 
be  available;  or,  provides  a  letter  from  the  service  members  commanding  officer  confirming  
military duty prevents the servicemember’s appearance and leave is not authorized. 50 U.S.C. 
§ 3932(b).

Child Custody Protection
If a court renders a temporary custody order solely based on the deployment or anticipated 
deployment of a servicemember parent, the court shall limit the order to the time justified by 
the deployment. 50 U.S.C. § 3938(a). Moreover, a parent’s absence as a result of a deployment 
may not be the sole factor in determining the best interest of child for purposes of a request for 
a permanent custody. 50 U.S.C. § 3938(b). Similar protections are provided in state law. Tex. 
Fam. Code § 156.006(c).
