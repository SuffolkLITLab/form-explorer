Legislative Edition – 81st Legislature 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         July 2009 

The 81st regular legislative session resulted in a number of new laws of interest to the judiciary, including laws 

resulting in: 
 

  The  creation  of  seven  new  district  courts  that  will  serve  Bexar,  Denton,  Midland,  Rockwall  and  Tarrant 
counties as well as the creation of eight new county courts at law in Bexar, Bosque, Fannin, Hidalgo and 
Navarro counties; 

  Authority for commissioners courts to establish veterans court programs; 

  Changes to judicial longevity pay;  

  New  and  increased  filing  fees  and  court  costs  to  support  basic  civil  legal  services  for  indigents,  district 

court technology, and court records preservation; 

  Further measures to protect the security of judges and their families; and 

  Authorization for the Supreme Court to modify or suspend court procedures in the event of a disaster.  

This report briefly  summarizes new legislation directly impacting the Texas  court system, judges, clerks, and 
other judicial actors.  No attempt is made to cover substantive areas of the law in detail; other entities are expected 
to provide legislative updates on substantive legal topics.  Additionally, the final pages of the report make reference 
to a few notable bills that were passed by the Legislature but vetoed by the governor.   

We hope the report will be a useful resource for the judicial and legal community and all those interested in the

Also  would  have  modified 
the  age  difference 
between  a  defendant  and  victim  or  intended  victim 
related  to  a  finding  of  an  age-based  offense.  In  his 
veto  proclamation,  the  Governor  expressed  concern 
that  the  bill  allowed  an  exemption  from  registration 
for  the  sex  offender  regardless  of  the  age  of  the 
victim. “While other provisions of the  criminal code 
provide some protections against very young victims 
being re-victimized in the event that a court  were  to 
improvidently  exempt 
from  sex 
offender  registration,  I  am  not  willing  to  take  that 
gamble with the lives of young Texans."

Would have expanded the list of persons eligible for 
expunction  of  arrest  records  to  include  persons 
granted  relief  on  the  basis  of  actual  innocence, 
persons  released  without  charge  or  conviction  under 
certain circumstances, persons acquitted by a court of 
appeals in certain cases, and persons who were never 
tried  for  an  offense  if  the  prosecutor  recommends 
expunction.  In  vetoing  the  legislation,  the  Governor 
expressed  concern  about  provisions  in  the  proposal 
that  would  have  allowed  expunction  180  days  after 
an arrest if no formal charges were filed, as compared 
with current law which generally results in a two year 
period  before  expunction  is  available.  The  shorter 
period  proposed  in  HB  3481  could  have  required  a 
prosecutor to reveal details of an investigation within 
180  days  of  arrest,  according  to  the  Governor,  who 
stated  in  his  veto  proclamation  that  “[e]xpunction 
statutes  should  not  be  used  as  a  means  of  discovery 
or  as  a  means  to  force  a  prosecutor  to  rush  to  file 
formal  charges  prematurely.  Allowing  a  person  to

Would  have  created  the  Class  C  misdemeanor 
offense  of failure to report barratry or solicitation of 
employment  for  a  lawyer  who  acquires  knowledge 
that  would  reasonably  cause  him  or  her  to  believe 
that  a  non-lawyer  acting  on  behalf  of  a  lawyer, 
committed 
professional 
or

Governor objected to the bill because it would “make

criminal penalties because of the criminal conduct of

the decision related to transporting a child to conduct 
an interview in Gates v. Texas Dept of Protective and 
Regulatory  Services,  the  governor  vetoed  SB  1440, 
asserting that the measure “overreaches and may not 
give  due  consideration  to  the  Fourth  Amendment 
rights  of  a  parent  or  guardian.”  The  governor  then 
directed  the  department  to  study  the  Gates  decision

Would  have  required  courts,  executive  branch 
agencies, 
construe 
nonsubstantive  revisions  of  Texas  statutes  such  that 
no  substantive  effect  is  given  to  the  revisions.    In  a 
message  of  disapproval  attached  to  his  veto,  the 
Governor stated: “The plain words of a statute are the 
starting  point  for  interpreting  the  law.    Senate  Bill 
2038 would eliminate this fundamental principle. . . . 
Judges  would  no  longer  be  able  to  apply  the  law 
simply by looking at its plain text.”   

Would  have  made  confidential  and  privileged  the 
discussions,  thought  processes  and  individual  votes 
of  members  of  the  State  Commission  on  Judicial 
Conduct  and 
the  commission’s  employees  and 
special  counsel  unless  expressly  waived  in  writing. 
Also  would  have  made 
identity  of  any 
the 
confidential  complainant  or 
commission  confidential  and  privileged,  unless 
waived in writing. The governor vetoed this measure 
because  “the  protections  the  commission  needs  in 
order  to  perform  its  duties  are  already  provided  in 
law.”
