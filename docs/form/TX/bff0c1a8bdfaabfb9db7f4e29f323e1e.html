      <pre>Senior and Former Judges
Available to Serve on Assignment

The  following  information  on  Senior  and  Former  Judges  available  for  assignment  was  obtained  from  the  Presiding  Judges  of  the  Administrative 
Judicial  Regions  (AJRs),  and  is  current  as  of  June  2022.  For  an  updated  list  of  the  judges  available  for  assignment  in  a  particular  region  and/or 
the current status and phone number for a judge on this list, please contact the relevant AJR (as indicated in the third column). 

Column  2 below  indicates  the  judge's  status  as  of  June  2022;  this  column  does  not  indicate  the  judge's  status  at  the  time  the  judge  left  office.  As 
used  in  this  directory,  "former"  indicates  a  judge  who  served  as  a  regular  judge  for  at  least  96 months  and  has  not  yet  retired  (i.e.,  a  judge  who 
served  as  a  district  or  appellate  judge  and  is  not  receiving  an  annuity  under  the  Judicial  Retirement    System  or  a  judge  who  served  as  a  statutory 
probate  or  statutory  county  court 
the  Texas  County  and  District  Retirement  System),  "senior" 
indicates  a  judge  who  served  as  a  district  or  appellate  judge  for  at  least  96 months  and  has  retired  (i.e.,  a  judge  who  is  receiving  an  annuity  under 
the  Judicial  Retirement  System),  and  “retired”  indicates  a  judge  who  served  as  a  statutory  county  court  judge  for  at  least  96 months,  or  served  as 
a  statutory  probate  judge  for  at  least  72 months,  and  has  retired  (i.e.,  a  judge  who  is  receiving  an  annuity  under  the  Texas  County  and  District 
Retirement System).

is  not  receiving  an  annuity  under 

judge  and 

The  minimum  number  of  months  of  service  required  to  serve  on  assignment  increased  from  48 months  to  96 months  effective  June  18,  2003.  
However,  judges  who  met  the  eligibility  requirement  in  effect  before  June  18,  2003,  were  grandfathered  and  not  required  to  meet  the  96 months 
minimum. 
For  this  reason,  some  of  the  judges  who  are  on  this  list  may  have  served  fewer  than  96 months  as  a  regular  judge.  See  Texas 
Goverment Code Sec. 74.055. Effective January 1, 2012, the minimum number of months of service required for statutory probate judges to serve

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
