After you file the petition, the clerk will send it to the court, and the court will notify the 
prosecutor.   

 hearing is required if the prosecutor requests one.  

f a hearing is scheduled, the court will notify you. If there is a hearing, the court may ask 
questions regarding your eligibility to receive the order. After the hearing, if the court 
finds  that  you  have  satisfied  the  requirements  of  the  statutes  (Government  Code 
Sections  411.0731  and  411.074)  and  issuance  of  the  order  is  in  the  best  interest  of 
justice, the court will grant your request for the order. 

f the court does not hold a hearing, the court will review your petition to determine 
whether an order of nondisclosure shall issue. The court must find that you satisfy the 
requirements of Sections 411.0731 and 411.074 and issuance of the order is in the best 
interest of justice before the court can grant your request.     

he court will not grant an order of nondisclosure if the prosecuting attorney proves 
that your commission of  the DWI  resulted in  an accident involving  another person, 
including a passenger in your motor vehicle. 

he court will have access to your criminal history record and will use it to determine 
your eligibility for the order.    

f the court grants the order, the clerk will send a copy of the order to DPS no later than 
15  business  days  after  the  order  issues.  Upon  receiving  the  order,  DPS  will  have  10 
business days to seal, not delete, the criminal history record information that is subject 
to the order and forward a copy of the order to the state and federal agencies listed in 
Government  Code  Section  411.075(b).  It  is  important  to  note  that  some  agencies, 
including law enforcement agencies, will still have access to the information, although the 
information is sealed. You will find a list of such agencies at Government Code Section 
411.0765.
