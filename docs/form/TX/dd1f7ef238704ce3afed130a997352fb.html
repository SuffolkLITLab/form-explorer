II.  SEEKING HELP AND GETTING 

INFORMATION 
A.   The Clerk’s Office 
The  Supreme  Court  of  Texas  provides  several 
 
different  resources  for  persons  seeking  help 
in 
understanding  the  Court’s  procedures.  For  example, 
the  Court  employs  other  attorneys  besides  the  Clerk, 
such as the Staff Attorney for Public Information and 
the  Rules  Attorney,  who  may  be  able  to  answer  any 
questions  you  might  have  about 
the  Court’s 
procedures.   

But  Texas  Rule  of  Appellate  Procedure  9.6 
provides  that  parties  and  counsel  may  communicate 
with the appellate court about a case only through the 
Clerk.    If  you  are  a  party  or  counsel  to  a  case,  you 
should  not  contact  anyone  at  the  Court  besides  the 
Clerk’s Office about your case. 
 
The Clerk’s Office can be reached at (512) 463-
1312.  If you need immediate relief from a lower court 
order and intend to file a motion for stay, you should 
contact the Clerk’s Office as soon as possible after the 
need  for  relief  arises.    The  Court  does  not  accept 
filings by facsimile, but if you call the Clerk’s Office 
you will be instructed on the Court’s procedures in the 
event that immediate relief is needed.    

  With  the  assistance  of  the  Office  of  Court 
Administration (“OCA”), the Supreme Court of Texas 
strives to provide a helpful and user-friendly website.  
The Clerk and his staff dedicate a great deal of time to 
suggesting  and  implementing  changes  to  the  Court’s 
website.    The  address  of  the  Court’s  website  is 
http://www.txcourts.gov/supreme/

1.  Frequently Asked Questions 
 
The  Court’s  website  answers  many  frequently 
asked  questions  regarding  the  amount  of  filing  fees, 
the Court’s mailing address, and other basic questions. 
Please  check  the  frequently  asked  questions  page  for 
the answer to your questions before calling the Clerk’s 
Office. A link to the frequently asked questions page 
(FAQ) can be found on the Court’s home page on the 
left-hand side of the page in the Supreme Court Home 
section of the page.2 
 
If you are an attorney, please educate and inform 
your  staff  about  this  resource.    All  of  our  clerks’ 
offices spend a great deal of time answering telephone 
calls about basic information that can be found on the 
courts’  websites.    Please  help  our  clerks’  offices  run 
more  efficiently  by  training  your  staff  to  use  the 
available internet resources.

INTRODUCTION 
The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  provide  an  in-
depth 
internal  operating 
the 
procedures of the Supreme Court of Texas.  Like most 
continuing  legal  education  articles,  this  article  relies 
heavily on other articles written on this same topic in 
previous years.  Much of this article is taken verbatim 
from these previous articles, but the article is updated 
with  new  information  about  the  Court’s  website, 
procedures, electronic briefs and applicable rules.  The 
author  is  indebted  to  the  staff  members  of  the 
Supreme  Court  of  Texas  and  appellate  practitioners 
who  contributed  to  these  previous  articles  and  who 
provided their insights  and  comments  for this  article.  
In  particular,  the  author  wishes  to  thank  Doug 
Alexander and Andrew Weber, for their contributions 
to this article and past articles on this same subject. 

This  article  is  intended  to  assist  attorneys  and 
others  who  wish  to  understand  how  the  Supreme 
Court  of  Texas  operates.    Much  of  the  information 
contained  in  this  article  can  be  found  by  carefully 
reading  the  Texas  Rules  of  Appellate  Procedure—
particularly  Rules  52  through  65,  which  govern 
proceedings  in  the  Supreme  Court  of  Texas.    One 
should also be thoroughly familiar with Texas Rule of 
Appellate Procedure 9 which sets forth important rules 
regarding  signing,  filing,  form,  and  service  of 
documents 
  For 
information regarding the filing of motions, be sure to 
read Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 10, especially 
if you are filing a motion for extension of time as the 
rule requires particular information for these motions.  
See  TEX.  R.  APP.  P.  10.5(b).    Finally,  the  Rules  of 
Appellate  Procedure  now  require  all  attorneys  to  file 
documents  electronically. 
  You  should  read  the 
Court’s  order  amending  the  Rules  of  Appellate 
Procedure before filing any document with the Court.1 
See Appendix A. 

in  all  Texas  appellate  courts. 

Of course the rules and decisions of the courts 
trump  the  author’s  statements  and  opinions  and  you 
must  ultimately  be  guided  by  the  rules  and  the 
decisions of the courts.

1 Misc. Docket No. 13-9165, Order Adopting Texas Rule of 
Civil Procedure 21c and Amendments to Texas Rules of 
Civil Procedure 4, 21, 21a, 45, 57, and 502; Texas Rules of 
Appellate Procedure 6,9, and 48; and the Supreme Court 
Order Directing the Form of the Appellate Record.. 

 

calendar settings, on the Court’s docket sheet for that 
matter.  Of course, counsel should not rely exclusively 
on  this  service  and  should  always  double-check  any 
due  dates  and  calendar  those  dates  independently  of 
this  system.    The  system  can  also  provide  notices  of 
new opinions.   

The  Court’s  website  contains  information  on 
registering to receive Casemail (see the Casemail links 
on  the  left-hand  side).    Once  registered  with  a  user 
name  and  password,  counsel  may  sign  up  to  receive 
opinion  notices  in  any  appellate  court  in  Texas,  and 
counsel  may  elect  to  receive  an  e-mail  notice  for  all 
events  and  calendars  in  any  case  in  those  courts.  
Though one may view a list of all watched cases from 
one webpage, and may delete any watched case from 
that page, one must initially go to a particular case in 
order to elect to receive Casemail on that case. 

.  The Court Calendar 

 
 
The  Court  provides  a  detailed  calendar  on  its 
website  listing  the  dates  that  the  Court  will  discuss 
cases  in  conference  and  hear  oral  arguments.7    The 
calendar  allows  you  to  click  on  events  to  view  more 
detailed  information.    You  can  also  download  events 
to  your  Microsoft  Outlook  calendar  or  Apple  iCal 
calendar.   

the  Court’s 

The Clerk maintains the online calendar and adds 
new events as appropriate.  An RSS feed is available 
for the calendar.   
Mastering 

internal  operating 
procedures will allow you to use the Court’s calendar 
to  predict  when  to  expect  the  Court  to  take  action  in 
your case, or other cases that you are watching.  Using 
what  you  know  about  the  Court’s  calendar  and  the 
internal  operating  procedures  can  also  help  provide 
insight  into  whether  the  Court  is  interested  in  your 
case. 

.  The Rules Page 

 
Free copies of the Rules of Appellate Procedure, 
the  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  the  Rules  of  Evidence, 
and  many  other  rules  and  standards  are  available  on 
the rules page.8   

.  Oral Argument Video and Audio Recordings 

 
On March 12, 2007, the Supreme Court of Texas 
and  St.  Mary’s  University  School  of  Law  began 
broadcasting  oral  arguments  live  over  the  internet.  
The  State  Bar  of  Texas  assumed  responsibility  for 
webcasting oral arguments in September, 2012. All of 
these  oral  argument  videos  are  available  on  a  web 
page  maintained  by  the  State  Bar  of  Texas  for  the

2.  The Clerk’s Page 
The  Clerk  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  Texas 
 
maintains a separate web page.34  One can find a link 
to this page on the left-hand side of the Court’s home 
page—under  Supreme  Court  Home>About 
the 
Court>Clerk’s  Office.    The  Clerk’s  page  provides 
information about electronic filing, mailing addresses, 
filing  fees,  and  the  telephone  number  for  the  Clerk’s 
Office. 
The  Clerk  of  the  Supreme  Court  also  serves  as 
 
the Clerk of the Multidistrict Litigation Panel (“MDL 
Panel”).    The  Clerk  maintains  a  web  page  devoted 
exclusively  to the MDL  panel  and  a  link  to that  web 
page can be found on the Clerk’s home page. 5

3.  Electronic Briefs 
Perhaps the most useful page to both novices and 
 
the 
experienced  appellate  practitioners  alike 
electronic  briefs  page.6    In  2002,  the  Court  began 
asking  parties  to  submit  electronic  copies  of  the 
petition,  response,  reply,  and  all  briefs  in  electronic 
format  for  posting  on  the  Court’s  website  when  the 
Court requested briefs on the merits.  On February 15, 
2010,  the  Court  issued  an  order  requiring  electronic 
courtesy  copies  of  all  petitions,  responses,  replies, 
briefs  on  the  merits,  motions  for  rehearing,  and 
amicus  letters  to  be  e-mailed  to  the  Clerk  the  same 
day  that  the  paper  version  is  filed.    This  new  order 
also  imposed  redaction  requirements  because  all  of 
these  documents  are  posted  on  the  Court’s  website.  
The  Court  promulgated  rules  permitting  electronic 
filing of all documents effective March 15, 2011.  And 
electronic  filing  became  mandatory  for  attorneys  on 
September  12,  2011.  Through  the  Texas  Appeals 
Management  and  E-Filing  System  (TAMES),  the 
Court  now  provides  access  to  almost  all  of  the 
documents filed with the Court.   

If you have questions about the proper format for 
appellate briefs, this is a good place to find examples.  
The electronic briefs page is also a good place to keep 
track of the issues that the Court is reviewing. 

 
Once a number is assigned to a petition or other 
initial  filing,  one  should  register to  receive  case  mail 
from the Court.  And lead counsel is now required to 
register 
for  Casemail.  The  Court’s  automated 
information  system  will  send  registrants  e-mails 
regarding  any  filings  or  other  activity,  including

III.  FILING DOCUMENTS WITH THE COURT 
A.  Electronic Filing 

Electronic filing became mandatory for attorneys 
at  the  Supreme  Court  in  September,  2011.  To  file 
documents  electronically  with  the  Court,  go  to  the 
eFileTexas.gov. 
If  you  don’t  already  have  an 
Electronic Filing Service Provider (“EFSP”) who will 
help  you  file  documents  electronically,  you  can  sign 
up with one after reading about the different services 
they  provide.    The  EFSP  will  be  your  interface  for 
filing  documents  through  eFileTexas,  which  runs  the 
Electronic  Filing  Manager  (“EFM”).    Think  of  the 
EFSP  as  the  courier  and  the  EFM  as  the  central  post 
office.  The EFSP sends the document to the EFM and 
the EFM sends the document to the Clerk. 

Be  sure  to  read  the  Texas  Rule  of  Appellate 
Procedure  9,  especially  paragraph  (j),  before  filing. 
You  should  in  particular  be  aware  of  the  following 
requirements: 

•  Petitions, briefs and other original filings 
must be converted directly to PDF; 
•  Appendix  materials  should  also  be 
converted  directly  to  PDF  and  should 
only be scanned when necessary; 

•  Appendix materials must be bookmarked 
and 
the  same 
included  as  part  of 
computer  file  as  the  document  they 
accompany; 

•  Personal  information  such  as  minors’ 
names,  dates  of  birth,  social  security 
numbers,  bank  account  numbers,  and 
other  sensitive 
information  must  be 
redacted; 

•  A  document  will  be  considered  timely 
filed if it is filed before midnight (in the 
Court’s  time  zone)  on  the  day  that  it  is 
due; 

•  You  must  serve 

the  document  on 
opposing  counsel  electronically  either 
through the electronic filing system or by 
e-mail 
is  not 
if  opposing  counsel 
registered with the system; 

•  Lead  counsel  must  register  to  receive 
notices  about  the  case  through  Casemail 
on the Court’s website; 

•  You must provide the State Bar of Texas 
with  an  electronic 
service  address 
through  your  online  State  Bar  profile 
page.. 
 

Once you have successfully e-filed and e-served your 
documents, you are done. You no longer need to send 
paper copies to the Court.  
 

Supreme Court Of Texas Internal Operating Procedures 
 
Court.9    There  is  also  a  link  to  oral  argument  videos 
on the Court’s web page.  
In  the  past,  the  Clerk’s  Office  posted  audio 
 
recordings of all oral arguments, but discontinued this 
practice  in  September  2012.  Several  years  ago,  the 
Clerk’s Office converted about twenty years of audio 
cassette recordings of oral arguments to digital format 
and  made  them  available  online.    No  other  state 
appellate court has as many oral argument recordings 
available on the internet. 
In  addition,  transcripts  of  oral  arguments  are 
 
available on the docket page for the cases.  Transcripts 
of  oral  arguments  are  usually  posted  three  to  four 
weeks  after  the  argument.    Westlaw  provides  the 
transcripts  to  the  Court  and  also  maintains  its  own 
database of searchable transcripts, which are linked to 
the  video  recordings  in  Westlaw’s  database.    The 
transcripts  are  available  for  free  on  the  Court’s 
website,  but  Westlaw  charges  for  using  its  oral 
arguments database. 
 
For  cases  that  have  been  argued,  the  transcript, 
audio  recording,  and  link  to  the  oral  argument  video 
are  all  attached  to  the  oral  argument  event  on  the 
docket pages for those cases. 

.  The Rules Attorney 

The  Court  employs  a  Staff  Attorney  for  Rules 
 
(aka “The Rules Attorney”) who works exclusively on 
creating,  revising,  and  amending  Texas  court  rules.  
The  Rules  Attorney’s  phone  number  is  published  on 
the website’s rules page.  See The Rules Page, Section 
B,  6  above.    One  may  contact  the  Rules  Attorney  to 
discuss questions regarding the rules and procedure,ut 
the  Rules  Attorney  cannot  discuss  particular  cases 
with parties or counsel or give legal advice.  See TEX. 
R. APP. P. 9.6. 

.  The Staff Attorney for Public Information 

The  Court  employs  a  Staff  Attorney  for  Public 
 
Information to assist the Court in communicating with 
the  press,  the  Bar,  and  the  general  public.    Among 
other things, the Staff Attorney for Public Information 
disseminates  a  weekly  e-mail  to  a  group  e-mail  list 
containing  the  Court’s  orders  and  opinions  and 
prepares case summaries for cases that have been set 
for  oral  argument.    As  with  all  the  Court’s  staff 
attorneys,  the  Staff  Attorney  for  Public  Information 
cannot give you legal advice.  Parties and counsel to a 
case should not contact this staff attorney, or any other 
staff  attorney,  to  answer  questions  about  a  particular 
case.  See TEX. R. APP. P. 9.6.

If  you  need  relief  within  the  next  ten  business 
days,  you  should  call  the  Clerk’s  Office  and  inform 
them that you will be filing a motion for emergency or 
temporary  relief.    The  phone  number  is  (512)  463-
1312.  You will receive instructions on how to e-mail 
your documents to the Clerk and Chief Deputy Clerk 
so  that  the  Staff  Attorney  for  Original  Proceedings 
(aka  the  Mandamus  Attorney)  can  begin  reviewing 
your  documents.    The  Mandamus  Attorney  will 
usually decide when to circulate the documents to the 
Court.   
 
Although  you  may  be  instructed  to  e-mail  your 
documents  to  the  Clerk’s  Office,  e-mailing  the 
documents  is  not  an  accepted  means  of  filing 
documents  with  the  Court.  You  must  still  file  the 
documents  through  the  e-filing  system  if  you  are  an 
attorney,  or,  if  you  are  not  an  attorney,  you  may  file 
them by mail or commercial delivery service.

B.  Filing by Mail 
 
Attorneys may not file by mail. If you are not an 
attorney, you may still file by mail if you do not want 
to use the electronic filing system.  

Rule  9.2(b)(1)  is  frequently  referred  to  as  the 
“mailbox  rule.”    Under  this  rule,  you  may  file  the 
initial  petition  for  review  or  motion  for  extension  of 
time  to  file  the  petition  for  review  by  United  States 
Postal  Service  first  class,  express,  registered,  or 
certified mail.  You must deposit the document in the 
mail on or before the due date.  If you are relying on 
the mail box rule for timely filing, it is a good idea to 
obtain a receipt of certificate of mailing from the post 
office or a receipt endorsed by a commercial delivery 
service  showing  the  date  the  document  was  mailed.  
Tex. R. App. P. 9.2(b)(2)(B), (C). 
 
In  addition  to  the  foregoing,  to  be  timely  filed 
under  the  mail  box  rule,  the  document  must  actually 
be received within ten days.  One should also check to 
make  sure  that  Clerk  receives  the  filing  within  ten 
days  after  you  mailed  the  document.    The  failure  of 
the document to arrive within ten days can be fatal to 
your  reliance  on  the  mail  box  rule.    See  Stokes  v. 
Abderdeen Ins. Co., 917 S.W.2d 267, 268 (Tex. 1996) 
(“The clerk must still receive the documents within 10 
days to perfect the filings.”). 

.  Mailing addresses 

  When  sending  documents  through  the  United 
States Postal Service, address your package to: 

Federal  Express,  UPS,  and  other  overnight 
delivery  services  require  a  physical  address.    When 
using a courier service, address your package to: 

If you are filing electronically, fees are collected 
 
through  the  electronic  filing  system  using  a  credit 
card.  

If you are not an attorney and are filing by mail, 
do not forget to include any applicable filing fees with 
your document. Failure to include your filing fee will 
delay the processing of your case. The Clerk’s Office 
will  call  to  request  missing  fees.  If  fees  are  not 
received  immediately,  the  Clerk’s  Office  will  send 
you  a  letter  stating  that  appropriate  action,  including

3.  Font 
 
Documents created using a computer (as opposed 
to  a  typewriter)  must  use  a  font  size  no  smaller  than 
14-point,  except  for  footnotes,  which  must  be  no 
smaller  than  12-point.  A  typewritten  document  must 
be  printed  in  a  proportionally  spaced  typeface, 
footnotes  may  be  printed  in  typeface  no  smaller than 
10-point.  TEX. R. APP. P. 9.4(e). 
 

TIP: 

typeface  or 

is  probably 

Use a 14-point proportionally 
 
larger.  Many  brief 
spaced 
writers mistakenly use 12-point font because 
Word  defaults  to this  font size.  Times  New 
Roman 
the  most  common 
typeface  used.  The  United  States  Supreme 
Court and the Fifth Circuit use New Century 
Schoolbook,  and  that  is  an  acceptable  font.  
Georgia  is  a  font  that  was  designed  for 
reading  on  a  screen,  so  it  may  be  a  good 
choice  for  electronic  briefs.    The  website 
typegraphyforlawyers.com  provides  lots  of 
tips about fonts.  Whatever font you choose, 
do  not  use  a  font  smaller  than  14-point  for 
computer generated documents. 

The  front  cover  of  petitions  and  briefs  should 
 
include  the  case  number  at  the  top  of  the  page  if 
already assigned.  For an initial motion for extension 
of  time  to  file  a  petition  for  review  or  petition  for 
review  that  has  not  already  been  assigned  a  case 
number,  leave  the  case  number  blank.    The  cover 
should  also  include  the  case  style,  the  title  of  the 
document,  and  the  name,  mailing  address,  telephone 
number,  fax  number,  if  any,  and  the  State  Bar  of 
Texas  identification  number  of  the  lead  counsel  for 
the filing party.  TEX. R. APP. P. 9.4(g).   
 
Although  not  required  by  the  rules,  the  front 
cover  of  the  petition  should  also  list  the  name  of  the 
court of appeals and the court of appeals’ case number 
(e.g. “On Petition for Review from the Third Court of 
Appeals at Austin, Texas, 03-08-0001-CV”).  Both the 
Court  and  the  Clerk’s  Office  prefer  that  court  of 
appeals  name  and  case  number  appear  on  the  front 
cover.  For examples, visit the Court’s electronic brief 
page on the website. 
Rule 53 provides that “[t]he Supreme Court may 
 
review a court of appeals’ final judgment on a petition 
for  review  addressed  to  ‘The  Supreme  Court  of 
Texas.’”  If you are attempting to use a brief you filed 
in the court of appeals as your petition, you should at 
a  minimum  be  sure  to  change  your  cover  and  any 
salutation  to  address  the  Supreme  Court.    Do  not 
forget  that  the  word and page  limits  are shorter for  a 
petition filed with the Supreme Court.

IV.  PETITIONS FOR REVIEW 
The  petition  for review is the  primary  means  by 
 
which  one  usually  seeks  review  of  the  decision  of  a 
court  of  appeals.    Before  filing  a  petition  for review, 
one should be thoroughly familiar with the provisions 
of  Rule  53.    Rule  53  sets  out  the  necessary  contents 
for  a  petition  for  review,  the  page  limits,  and  the 
required  appendix  materials.  One  should  also  be 
thoroughly  familiar  with  Rule  9  which  establishes 
word  and  page  limits,  margins,  font  sizes,  and  other 
format  requirements.    Knowing  these  rules  will  help 
get you past the Clerk’s Office review of your petition 
and  avoid  having  your  petition  struck  for  non-
compliance. 

.  Clerk’s Office Review and Data Input 

they  comply  with 

The  deputy  clerks  review  incoming  filings  to 
 
the  rules 
determine  whether 
governing  the  form  and  content  of  the  documents.  
The  Clerk  is  authorized  by  the  Court  to  strike 
nonconforming  documents.    If  the  Clerk  determines 
that the document should be struck, the document may 
be returned for correction through the e-filing system 
with  instructions  on  how  and  when  to  correct  the 
document.    The  Clerk  may  also  strike  documents  on 
the Court’s weekly orders. 
 
The  deputy  clerks  input  information  about  the 
filing into the Court’s case management system.  For a 
petition,  this  includes  virtually  all  of  the  basic 
information about the case that is required by Rule 53 
(or  Rule  52  for  original  proceedings).    For  example, 
the name of the trial court judge, the court of appeals 
panel,  and  the  identity  of  parties  and  counsel.    This 
data  is  used  for  recusal  purposes,  to  populate  the 
online  docket  sheets,  to  send  notices,  and  to  create 
statistical  reports  published  by  OCA.    It  is  therefore 
critical  that  you  provide  accurate  information.    This 
information about the case will usually appear on the 
Court’s website the day after the filing was received.  
Case  information  is  updated  as  other  documents  are 
filed  or  phone  calls  are  made  or  received  concerning 
the case.

.  The Sections of a Petition for Review 

The  Clerk’s  Office  checks  to  make  sure  that  all 
 
documents  contain  the  required  sections.    Be  sure  to 
make  sure  you  have  included  all  of  the  required 
sections.    The  required  sections  for  a  petition  for 
review are:

count  against  the  word  and  page  limits  for  petitions.  
TEX. R. APP. P. 53.6.   
 

TIP:  When  numbering  the  pages  of 
 
your  petition,  use  small  roman  numerals  (i, 
ii,  iii, iv)  for  the initial  sections  that  do  not 
count  against  your  word  or  page  limit  (e.g. 
Identity  of  Parties  and  Counsel,  Table  of 
Contents, Index of Authorities, etc.).  Begin 
regular  page  numbering  with  the  sections 
that  count  against  your  page  limit.    This 
method will not only help the reader identify 
the substantive sections of your brief, but it 
will help you avoid exceeding the word and 
page  limits—one  of  the  most  common 
reasons for striking petitions. 

. 

Identity of Parties and Counsel 
The petition for review must give a complete list 
 
of all parties to the trial court’s final judgment, and the 
names and addresses of all trial and appellate counsel.  
TEX. R. APP. P. 53.2(a). 

.  Table of Contents 

 
The  petition  must  have  a  table  of  contents  with 
references  to  the  pages  of  the  petition.    The  table  of 
contents must indicate the subject matter of each issue 
or point, or group of issues or points.

5.  Binding for Paper Filings 
The  Clerk’s  Office  scans  paper  filings  in  order  to 
create  PDFs  that  are  attached  to  the  Court’s  case 
management system. Only one unbound paper copy is 
required for paper filings. In other words, you do not 
need to bind paper filings.  
 
C.  Citations 
 
Follow  the  most  recent  edition  of  A  Uniform 
System  of  Citation  (Bluebook)  and  Texas  Rules  of 
Form  (Green  Book).    Many  staff  attorneys  and  law 
clerks  are  former  law  review  and  journal  editors  and 
their views of the quality of your petition or brief may 
be  affected  by  the  accuracy  of  your  citations.    Be 
particularly  careful  to  provide  accurate  subsequent 
history for Texas court of appeals’ cases. 
 
For  citations  to  the  record,  the  accepted  practice 
is to use the abbreviations CR for Clerk’s Record and 
RR  for  Reporter’s  Record  (e.g.  1  CR  123  or  2  RR 
453). Staff prefers that citations to the record be to the 
PDF page number. 
 

D.   Lead Counsel 
 
In  the  Supreme  Court,  lead  counsel  for  the 
petitioner is the attorney who signs the first document 
filed with the Court.  Lead counsel for the respondent 
will be the attorney designated by the petitioner in the 
petition for review, unless the first document filed by 
the  respondent  indicates  otherwise.    The  Clerk’s 
Office  enters  a  notation  in  the  case  management 
system  indicating  which  attorney  is  lead  counsel.  
Lead  counsel  must  sign  up  for  Casemail  electronic 
notifications,  which  are  in  addition  to  the  electronic 
notifications sent by the case management system.  
It  is  not  necessary  to  file  a  notice  of  new  lead 
 
counsel  when  the  lead  counsel  is  not  the  same  lead 
counsel  that  represented  the  party  at  the  court  of 
appeals.    But  if  the  lead  counsel  changes  while  the 
matter  is  pending  at  the  Supreme  Court,  a  new  lead 
counsel  should  be  designated.    See  Tex.  R.  App.  P. 
6.1. 

Computer  generated  documents  are  subject  to 
 
word 
limitations.  For  documents  created  with 
typewriters or written by hand, page limits apply. The 
following  is  a  list  of  word  and  page  limits  for  the 
various documents that may be filed in the petition for

.  Statement of Jurisdiction 

 
The  petition  must  state,  without  argument,  the 
basis  for  the  Court’s  jurisdiction.    TEX.  R.  APP.  P. 
53.2(e).    The  most  often  cited  statutory  bases  for 
jurisdiction in the Supreme Court of Texas are found 
in Texas Government Code § 22.001.  These grounds 
for  jurisdiction  are  parroted  by  the  factors  listed  in 
Rule  56.1  that  the  Court  is  to  consider  in  deciding 
whether to grant the petition.  These factors are: 

  whether  the  Justices  of  the  court  of  appeals 

disagree on an important point of law; 

•  whether there is a conflict between the courts of 

appeals on an important point of law; 

•  whether  a  case  involves  the  construction  or 

validity of a statute; 

•  whether  the  court  of  appeals  appears  to  have 
committed an error of law of such importance to 
the  state’s 
it  should  be 
corrected; and 

jurisprudence 

that 

•  whether  the  court  of  appeals  has  decided  an 
important  question  of  state  law  that  should  be, 
but has not been, decided by the Supreme Court. 

. 

Issues Presented 
 
The  petition  must  state  concisely  all  issues  or 
points presented for review.  The statement of an issue 
or  point  will  be  treated  as  covering  every  subsidiary 
question  that  is  fairly  included. 
  If  the  matter 
complained  of  originated  in  the  trial  court,  it  should 
have  been  preserved  for  appellate  review  in  the  trial 
court  and  assigned  as  error  in  the  court  of  appeals.  
TEX. R. APP. P. 53.2(f). 

.  Statement of Facts 

 
The petition must affirm that the court of appeals 
correctly  stated  the  nature  of  the  case,  except  in  any 
particulars  pointed  out.    The  petition  must  state 
the  facts  and 
concisely  and  without  argument 
procedural  background  pertinent  to  the  issues  or 
points presented.  The statement must be supported by 
record  references.    TEX.  R.  APP.  P.  53.2(g).    The 
statement of facts is included in the fifteen page limit 
for petitions and responses.  TEX. R. APP. P. 53.6. 

.  Summary of the Argument 

The  petition  must  contain  a  succinct,  clear,  and 
 
accurate statement of the arguments made in the body 
of the petition.  This summary is not merely a repeat 
of the issues or points presented for review.  TEX. R. 
APP.  P.  53.2(h).      The  summary  of  the  argument  is 
included  in  the  fifteen  page  limit  for  petitions  and

Index of Authorities 
The  petition  must  have  an  index  of  authorities

.  Statement of the Case 

 
The petition must contain a statement of the case 
that  should  seldom  exceed  one  page  and  should  not 
discuss  the  facts.    The  statement  must  contain  the 
following: 

a concise description of the nature of the case; 
the  name  of  the  judge  who  signed  the  order  or 
judgment appealed from; 
the designation of the trial court and the county in 
which it is located; 
the disposition of the case by the trial court; 
the parties in the court of appeals; 
the  names  of  the  justices  who  participated  in  the 
decision in the court of appeals, the author of the 
opinion  for  the  court,  and  the  author  of  any 
separate opinion; 
the citation for the court of appeals’ opinion; 
the disposition of the case by the court of appeals.

form,  the  statement  of  the  case  should  not  be  a 
narrative in sentence and paragraph form.  Instead, the 
Court  and 
this 
the  Clerk’s  Office  prefer 
information be listed in a table format.  The statement 
of the case is not intended as an opportunity to argue 
your case, rather it is intended to be an easy reference 
to basic information about the case.  The Justices use 
this information for recusal purposes, the staff uses the 
information to  prepare study  memos,  and  the  Clerk’s 
Office  enters 
the  case 
management  system.    Putting  this  information  in  a 
narrative  form  makes  it  difficult  for  everyone  to find 
the information they need about your case.  Avoid any

case to persuade or argue the merits.  Examples of the

TIP: Before filing your petition, check 
 
all  of  the  copies  of  your  petition  to  make 
sure  that  the  appendix  materials  are  not 
missing  any  pages.    One  Justice  often  asks 
the  Clerk’s  Office  to  contact  filers  to  tell 
them  that  they  inadvertently  included  every 
other page of an item in the appendix.  This 
is obviously vexing to someone that is trying 
to  understand  your  case,  so  take  a  few 
minutes 
to  make  sure  your  appendix 
materials are complete and accurate. 

The  appendix  must  be  combined 

into  one 
computer file with the document it accompanies. TEX. 
R.  APP.  P.  9.4(j)(4).  And  you  must  bookmark  each 
item in your appendix, using a description that of the 
appendix item that is helpful (e.g. Appendix A-Court 
of Appeals’ Opinion). TEX. R. APP. P. 9.4(h).   

With  electronic  briefs,  the  size  of  the  appendix 
should usually not be an issue, so long as you are not 
using  a  lot  of  scanned  files.    The  Justices  routinely 
state that they appreciate electronic briefs that provide 
hyperlinks  to  cases,  transcripts  and  other  useful 
materials contained in the appendix. The Court’s case

The  petition  must  contain  a  clear  and  concise 
 
argument  for  the  contentions  made,  with  appropriate 
citations  to  authorities  and  to  the  record.    The 
argument  need  not  address  every  issue  or  point 
included  in  the  statement  of  issues  or  points.    Any 
issue  or  point  not  addressed  may  be  addressed  in  the 
brief  on  the  merits  if  one  is  requested  by  the  Court.  
The  argument  should  state  the  reasons  why  the 
Supreme Court should exercise jurisdiction to hear the 
case  with  specific  reference  to  the  factors  listed  in 
Rule  56.1(a).    The  petition  need  not  quote  at  length 
from a matter included in the appendix; a reference to 
the appendix is sufficient.  The Court will consider the 
court  of  appeals’  opinion  along  with  the  petition,  so 
statements in that opinion need not be repeated.  TEX.

fifteen page limit for petitions and responses.  TEX. R.

The required contents for the appendix are: 

the judgment or other appealable order of the trial 
court from which relief in the court of appeals is 
sought; 
the  jury  charge  and  verdict,  if  any,  or  the  trial 
court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law, if 
any; 
the opinion and judgment of the court of appeals; 
and 
the text of any rule, regulation, ordinance, statute,

Some  major  exceptions 

the  use  of 

 
the 
conveyor  belt  system  are  petitions  for  writ  of 
mandamus  in  which  a  motion  for  emergency  or 
temporary  relief  has  been  filed,  petitions  for  writ  of 
habeas corpus, and parental termination cases.  These 
matters  are  initially  handled  by  the  Mandamus 
Attorney.  The Mandamus Attorney may present these 
matters by memo to the Court that is circulated by e-
mail  or  as  a  preliminary  matter  at  a  regularly 
scheduled conference. 

. 

Initial  Votes:  Pink  Vote  Sheets  and  Purple 
Vote Sheets 
 
The Court uses three different vote sheets, which 
serve three different functions.  Originally printed on 
colored  paper  to  distinguish  them,  these  votes  sheets 
are  now  available  electronically—although  some 
Justices  still  print  them.  Before  electronic  filing,  a 
pink  vote  sheet  was  placed  in  each  petition  and 
rehearing  file  folder  and  was  the  vote  sheet  for  that 
particular case.  Pink vote sheets may still be printed 
and  are  used  by  the  Justices  to  make  notes  about 
petitions.    Pink  vote  sheets  list  the  Supreme  Court 
style  and  case  number,  identify  the  trial  court  and 
court  of  appeals,  and  indicate  whether  a  response  or 
response  waiver  was  received  by  the  Clerk.    They 
provide  blanks  for  the  reviewing  Justice  to  indicate 
the  action  deemed  appropriate: 
  deny;  request 
response;  request  record;  discuss  at  conference; 
request study memo; issue per curiam opinion; grant; 
dismiss for want of jurisdiction; refuse petition; hold; 
dismiss  petition  on  motion  of  party.    The  pink  vote 
sheets  also  provide  space  for  “remarks”  by  the 
reviewing Justice— essentially space for notes that the 
Justice can use to refresh recollections about the case 
when the petition proceeds to conference.  If briefs on 
the  merits  are  requested  in  a  particular  case,  the 
assigned law clerk may review the pink vote sheets of 
the  Justices  to  assist  the  law  clerk  in  preparing  the 
study memo.  For an example of a pink vote sheet, see 
Appendix  C.  Each  Tuesday,  each  chambers  can  also 
print  a  purple  vote  sheet  on  all  matters  forwarded  to 
chambers  that  week.    This  list  is  of  course  also 
available electronically. The purple vote sheet lists not 
only  petitions  for  review,  mandamus,  and  habeas 
corpus, but also rehearing motions, and other matters 
requiring  action  by  the  full  Court.    The  purple  vote 
sheet includes the same blanks as the pink vote sheet 
for  the  Justices  to  record  their  preferred  disposition.  
Justices may cast their votes electronically or give the 
printed  purple  vote  sheet  to  an  assistant  to  enter  into 
the  computer  system.    The  deadline  for  votes  to  be

.  JUDICIAL DETERMINATION AT 

PETITION STAGE:  AN OVERVIEW OF 
ACTION ON PETITIONS FOR REVIEW 
AND ORIGINAL PROCEEDINGS 

A.  “Conveyor Belt” System  
 
The  Court  employs  a  “conveyor-belt”  system  in 
acting  on  petitions  for  review  and  non-emergency 
mandamus  petitions.  Once  a  petition  is  placed  in  the 
hands  of  the  Justices  on  a  given  Tuesday,  it  begins 
moving  along  the  conveyor  belt. 
  Unless  it  is 
affirmatively removed from the belt by one or more of 
the Justices, the petition is automatically denied on the 
Court’s  Friday  orders,  31  days  after  the  Justices  first 
received it.  One or more of the Justices can remove a 
petition from the conveyor belt by voting to take some 
action  other  than  denying  it.    The  Court  votes 
electronically  using  a  software  system  developed  for 
the Court and the other Texas appellate courts, which

system) 

that  conference.    Through  TAMES  (the  court’s  case 
and  agenda  management 
the  Court’s 
Administrative  Assistant,  records  on  the  yellow  vote 
sheet  how  each  Justice  voted  on  each  petition  and 
rehearing  motion  previously  listed  on  a  purple  vote 
sheet.  With respect to the study memos that are to be 
discussed, the Administrative Assistant lists the initial 
votes  that  were  cast  before  the  study  memo  was 
prepared.  The yellow vote sheet is then circulated to 
all of the Justices.  The Justices, once they have had a 
chance  to  see  how  other  Justices  have  voted,  and 
review any study memos that have been circulated, are 
then  at  liberty  to  change  their  vote  on  a  petition  or 
rehearing  of  denial  of  petition  motion.    The  Justices 
record  their  votes  on  all  petitions,  rehearings  of 
petitions, and study  memos  scheduled  for  discussion, 
and  on  the  morning  of  the  conference,  each  Justice 
enters their vote in TAMES.  All new votes and vote 
changes  are  copied  to  a  new  cumulative  yellow  vote 
sheet,  which  is  then  circulated  to  all  the  Justices.  
With  the  votes  thus  compiled,  the  Court  can  move 
more  efficiently  through  the  discussion  of  these 
matters.   The Chief Justice is able to quickly identify 
which  matters  are  candidates  for  an  outright  grant, 
which  are  clear  candidates  for  a  study  memo,  and 
which  Justices  have  an  interest  in  a  particular  matter 
require  more  protracted  discussion.  
that  may 
Achieving  a  consensus  by  the  Justices  that  a  petition 
be  denied  is  the  quickest  and  easiest  disposition  for 
the Court.  

 
If any of the Justices requests that a response be 
filed,  that  is  sufficient  to  pull  the  case  from  the 
“conveyor  belt.”    The  case  is  placed  on  a  “status 
report”  list  until  the  response  is  received  or  the 
deadline  for  filing  the  response  has  passed.    At  that 
point  the  case  is  placed  on  the  Court’s  conference 
agenda,  after  allowing  ample  time  for  a  reply  to  be 
filed (assuming a response was filed) as well as time 
for the Justices to review the response and any reply.  
   
E.  Review of Petitions  
1.  Amount of Review  
 
The practices of the Justices vary with respect to 
 
their 
review, 
reviewing  petitions 
mandamus  and  habeas  corpus  in  order  to  mark  the 
purple  vote  sheets.    Not  all  the  Justices  will  read  all 
the petitions each time.  Some use their court staff to 
summarize petitions and flag those deemed worthy of 
further  study,  and  some  read  all  the  petitions  each 
time.  Although  it  may  vary  somewhat,  most  Justices 
say they spend a maximum of 15 minutes per petition 
package, which includes reviewing the petition, court 
of appeals opinion, and response (if any). The review 
is not to determine the merits of the arguments but to

entered on the matters listed on the purple vote sheet 
is  noon  Thursday,  30  days  after  the  petition  is  first 
forwarded to the Justices.  If any Justice votes to take 
any action other than denying a petition, the petition is 
removed  from  the  conveyor  belt.    A  Justice’s  failure 
to mark a vote on a petition is treated as a vote to deny 
it.    For  an  example  of  a  Purple  Vote  Sheet,  see

.  Conference Votes: Yellow Vote Sheet  

items”  requiring 

the  Court’s  conference 

is 
The  agenda  for 
 
composed  of  “preliminary 
the 
immediate  attention  of  the  court,  post-submission 
discussion  of  prior  oral  arguments,  draft  opinions  in 
causes,  draft  per  curiam  opinions,  motions  for 
rehearings  of  causes  and  denials  of  petitions,  and 
pending  petitions.    The  yellow  vote  sheet  assists  the 
Court’s  disposition  of  the  last  two  categories  of 
agenda  items—rehearings  of  denials  of  petitions  (but 
not rehearings of causes) and pending petitions.  It is 
used  to  allow  the  Justices,  in  advance  of  conference, 
to  see  how  the  other  Justices  voted  on  matters 
previously listed on purple vote sheets, and to record 
votes on circulated study memos due to be discussed 
at conference.  The  votes of the Justices  may  change 
after circulation of study memos.   
At  the  time  the  conference  agenda  is  prepared, 
 
generally  one  week  in  advance  of  the  scheduled 
conference, 
the  Court’s  Administrative  Assistant 
prepares  a  preliminary  yellow  vote  sheet.    That  vote 
sheet  will  not  include  any  petitions  or  rehearing  of 
denial of petition motions that have failed to make the 
“initial  cut”  due  to  lack  of  a  vote  for  anything  other 
than “deny”  on  the  purple vote  sheets  marked  by  the 
Justices.  As for those petitions and rehearing motions 
that do make the “initial cut,” how the Justices voted 
on  matters  listed  on  purple  vote  sheets  determines 
which  conference  the  matter  goes  to.    If  any  of  the 
Justices requests a response to a petition or rehearing 
motion,  the  matter  is  scheduled  for  the  conference 
following the expiration of 30 days after the response 
is  filed.    In  those  rare  occasions  when  a  Justice 
requests the record without full briefing on the merits 
having  been  called  for,  the  matter  is  scheduled  for 
conference  following  the  expiration  of  30  days  after 
the  record  is  received.    If  the  Justices  mark  their 
purple vote sheets for something other than “response 
requested,”  “record  requested,”  or  “deny,”  the  matter 
goes directly to the next scheduled conference.  Thus, 
the  yellow  vote  sheet  could  include  matters  from 
several different purple vote sheets. 
 
Those  petitions  and  rehearing  of  denial  of 
petition  motions  that  make  the  “initial  cut”  and  are 
“ripe” for discussion at the next scheduled conference 
are listed on the yellow vote sheet for that conference, 
along with any study memos that will be discussed at 

  C

 

2.  Length of Conference  
 
Typically,  conference  will  start  at  9:00  a.m.  and 
end between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m.  At the beginning of 
the  term,  in  late  August,  conference  will  usually  last 
two days.   
 
 
3.  Attendance at Conference  
 
The persons required to attend conference for its 
duration  are  the  Justices,  the  Court’s  Administrative 
Assistant,  and  the  Conference  Monitor  for  that  week 
(a  duty  assigned  to  a  law  clerk  in  a  particular 
chambers  on  a  rotating  basis  by  seniority).    Staff 
attorneys  usually  attend  conference  for  its  duration, 
although  this  depends  on  the  particular Justice.    Law 
clerks  are  allowed  to  attend  conference  for  its 
duration,  again  depending  on  the  particular  Justice.  
Interns  may  participate  at  conference  only  to  the 
extent  of  discussing  opinions,  rehearing  of  petitions, 
and  petitions  on  which  they  have  actually  worked.  
The  Mandamus  Attorney  may  be  present  to  present 
preliminary matters to the Court that must be decided 
quickly, such as motions for emergency or temporary 
relief.    And  the  Clerk  is  occasionally  asked  to  attend 
to  discuss  particular  matters  on  the  agenda.    The 
Clerk,  the  General  Counsel,  the  Rules  Attorney,  the 
Staff  Attorney  for  Public  Information,  and 
the 
Administrative Assistant all attend the Administrative 
Conference that follows after the regular conference is 
concluded. 
  
4.  Agenda for Conference  
The conference agenda is prepared by the Court’s 
 
Administrative  Assistant  with 
from  each 
chambers.    Items  included  on  the  agenda  include 
filings  that  require  immediate  attention  by  the  Court 
(“preliminary  items”),  post-submission  discussion  of 
prior  oral  arguments,  draft  opinions  in  causes,  draft 
per curiam opinions, motions for rehearing of causes 
and petitions, and pending petitions.

.  Disposition  of  Petition  Without  Discussion  at 

Conference   
If no Justice has either requested a response to a 
 
petition  or  indicated  a  preferred  disposition  of  the 
petition  other  than  “deny,”  the  petition  will  not  be 
placed  for  discussion  on  the  Court’s  conference 
agenda.    Instead,  the  petition  will  be  automatically 
denied on the Court’s Friday orders, 31 days after the 
petition package was forwarded to the Justices. 

.  Postponement of Discussion of Petition  

 
Sometimes  the  only  Justice  who  has  voted  to 
discuss a petition (or something other than “deny”) is 
not  present  at  conference.    On  other  occasions,  a 
Justice  will  ask  for  additional  time  to  study  the 
petition.  In these instances, the petition will be placed

Supreme Court Of Texas Internal Operating Procedures 
 
reach  an  initial  decision  on  whether  further  study  or 
briefing is appropriate. 

.  Manner of Review  

 
The  order  in  which  the  matters  in  the  petition 
package  are  reviewed  by  the  Justices  also  varies.  
Some  start  with  the  court  of  appeals’  opinion,  since 
the  Court  is  reviewing  the  opinion  for  error.    Some 
start  with  the  issue  statements  and  then  look  at  the 
court  of  appeals’  opinion.    Some  start  with  the 
summary  of  the  argument  and  then  read  only  those 
portions of the court of appeals opinion relevant to the 
issues presented.   

.  Timing of Review  

 
The practice varies with respect to the timing of 
review as well.  Some Justices read the petitions soon 
after  they  are  forwarded;  others  read  them  the  week 
before the purple vote sheet is due.  One or two may 
not read them in time to mark their votes on the purple 
vote  sheet,  but  may  read  them  later  and  pull  from 
orders a petition set to be denied so it can be discussed 
at  the  next  conference.    Those  Justices  who  read 
petitions  earlier  may  alert  the  other  Justices  to  an 
upcoming petition that involves an issue similar to one 
being  discussed,  and  the  Court  may  then  decide  to 
hold the petition to consider them together. 

.  Role of Court Staff in Review  

 
Some Justices have or have had staff attorneys or 
law clerks help screen petitions and recommend votes.  
This  practice  has  ranged  from  having  staff  generally 
screen petitions for particular issues (e.g., family law 
issues,  constitutional  law  issues),  to  having  them 
their 
summarize  all  petitions  and 
disposition.

.  Conference at Petition Stage  

1.  Conference Calendar  
 
The Court sets its calendar for the upcoming term 
during the summer.  Thus, the conference schedule for 
the term is usually available on the Court’s website by 
August  of  each  year.    Generally,  the  Court  holds 
conference once a month on Tuesdays at 9:00 a.m.  If 
the Court is unable to complete its business in a single 
day,  the  conference  carries  over  to  Wednesday, 
starting  at  9:00  a.m.    Holidays,  judicial  conferences 
outside  of  Austin,  and  swearing-in  ceremonies  will 
determine  whether  a 
is 
cancelled, rescheduled, or starts late.  At the end of the 
Court’s  session,  as  summer  approaches,  the  Court 
generally  schedules  several  conferences  each  month, 
as the Court works on wrapping up opinions.  In June, 
the Court usually conferences weekly.   
 

scheduled  conference 

 

allows  time  for  one  or  more  of  the  Justices  to  “pull” 
the  matter  from  orders  for  further  study  or  for  some 
other  reason.    The  various  dispositions  and  required 
votes are set forth below.  
  
1.  Deny  
If all of the votes on the purple vote sheets are to 
 
deny  the  matter,  even  if  fewer  than  9  votes  are  cast, 
the  petition  is  automatically  denied  without  any 
discussion at conference on the following Friday’s set 
of  weekly  orders,  31  days  after  the  petition  package 
was initially forwarded to the Justices. 

.  Request Response  

If  any  Justice  votes  to  request  a  response  to  the 
 
petition, the  Clerk’s  Office  requests  by  letter  that  the 
response  be  filed  within  30  days.    If  the  response  is 
timely filed, the petition is placed on the calendar for 
the  first  conference  following  the  expiration  of  an 
additional  30  days.    If  the  response  is  not  timely 
received and no motion for extension of time is filed 
and  granted,  the  petition  is  ultimately  placed  on  a 
conference  agenda  with  a  notation  that  the  response 
was  never  received.    The  Court  may  then  dispose  of 
the  petition  or  instruct  the  Clerk’s  Office  to  either 
request a status report on the response or make other 
inquiry. 

.  Request Record  

If  any  Justice  votes  to  request  the  record,  the 
 
court of appeals will be directed to send the appellate 
record  to  the  Clerk  of  the  Supreme  Court.    It  is 
relatively rare for a Justice to request the record absent 
a request for full briefing on the merits. 

.  Discuss  

 
If  any  Justice  votes  to  discuss  a  petition,  the 
petition will be discussed at the next conference.  If no 
other interest is shown in the petition, it is denied on 
the following Friday’s orders. 

.  Dismiss WOJ  

in 

the 

Similarly,  if  any  Justice  votes  to  dismiss  a 
 
petition  for  want  of  jurisdiction,  the  petition  is 
discussed 
scheduled  Tuesday 
earliest 
conference.    If  5  or  more  Justices  vote  to  DWOJ the 
petition,  it  is  dismissed  WOJ  on  the  following 
Friday’s  orders.    If  not  DWOJ’ed,  the  petition  is 
denied or otherwise disposed of according to the votes 
in conference. 

.  Request Full Briefing and Memo  

If  3  or  more  Justices  vote  to  do  so,  the  Clerk’s 
 
Office  will  request  full  briefing  on  the  merits  and  a 
study memo will be assigned.  The request letter will 
indicate  when  petitioner’s  and  respondent’s  briefs  on

for  discussion  on  the  next  conference  agenda,  or  the 
petition  may  be  denied  if  the  Justice  reviews  it  and 
declines  to  vote  for  any  action  other  than  deny.    On 
still  other  occasions,  there  may  be  some  votes  for  a 
certain action (e.g., assigning a study memo), but the 
votes are insufficient.  In this instance, the Court may 
hold the petition over for Justices to further study it or 
for an absent Justice to vote.  Or the Court may vote to 
deny  the  petition  on  orders  subject  to  the  absent 
Justice’s prerogative to “pull” the petition from orders 
  The  Court’s  Administrative 
before  they  issue. 
Assistant  is  responsible  for  monitoring  petitions  and 
ensuring  that  they  are  placed  back  on  the  conference 
agenda at the appropriate time.      

 

.  Discussion of Petitions at Conference  

 
Because of the extensive list of matters typically 
included  on  the  conference  agenda,  even  when  a 
petition  survives  automatic  denial  and  makes  it  to 
conference, the amount of time devoted to discussion 
of  the  petition  is  generally  limited—usually  1  to  15 
minutes,  with  15  minutes  being  considered  an 
extraordinarily  lengthy  discussion.      All  petitions  on 
the  conference  agenda  are  called  to  the  table  by  the 
Chief  Justice  in  numeric  order,  oldest  cases  first.    A 
petition  is  discussed  at  conference  according  to  the 
votes  reflected  on  the  yellow  vote  sheet.    Generally, 
the Chief Justice controls the discussion by calling on 
Justices who have either voted to discuss the petition 
or recommended  specific disposition,  such  as  request 
study  memo,  grant,  dismiss  WOJ,  or  hold.    These 
Justices  then  present  their  concerns  to  the  Court.  
Other Justices may jump into the discussion, including 
those who have voted to deny the petition (with their 
reasons  for  denial).    Justices  who  have  not  yet  voted 
may vote at this point.  Justices may also change their 
votes  based  on  the  conference  discussion.    The 
discussion  of  petitions  which  have  been  briefed  and 
for  which  a  study  memo  has  been  circulated  centers 
on  whether  the  petition  should  be  granted,  If  no 
consensus  is  apparent  from  the  discussion,  the  Chief 
Justice  will  call  for  a  vote.    At  this  point,  the  most 
common resolutions are to deny the petition, request a 
study  memo,  or  dismiss  the  petition  for  want  of 
jurisdiction. 

  7

.  Votes Required for Particular Dispositions  

 
The timing and disposition of each petition turns 
on  the  Justices’  votes.    The  initial  votes  on  petitions 
are  due  by  noon  on  Tuesday  four  weeks  after  the 
Clerk’s  Office  forwards  the  petitions  to  the  Court.  
The  Justices  may,  however,  change  their  votes,  or 
place their votes for the first time on a petition, if the 
case  survives  automatic  denial  and  is  placed  on  the 
conference agenda.  Because conferences are held on 
Tuesdays and the Court’s orders issue on Fridays, this

Justices to IG a case. 

3.  Summary of Required Votes

I.  BRIEFS  ON  THE  MERITS  AND  STUDY 

MEMO 

A.  Request for Briefs on the Merits  
1.  Practical Significance of Request  
The Court requests the parties to file full briefing 
 
on the merits in only about 1 in 4 cases.  The request 
for  full  briefing  increases  the  odds  of  a  grant  or  per 
curiam opinion from about 1 in 10 to 1 in 3.   

.  Relationship to  Assignment  of  Study  Memo  and 

Request for Record  

  When  briefing  on  the  merits  is  requested,  the 
Clerk’s Office simultaneously requests the clerk of the 
court of appeals to forward the record to the Supreme 
Court.  Full briefing is almost always requested when 
a  study  memo  is  assigned.    Occasionally,  a  study 
memo  will  be  assigned  without full briefing  (e.g.,  on 
jurisdiction  only),  and  then  the  time  frame  for  the 
study  memo  is  shorter  (i.e.,  it  is  due  to  the  Court 
sooner than if the Court had to wait for full briefing on 
the  merits).    Sometimes  petitions  are  held  while  the 
opinion  in  a  cause  or  a  per  curiam  opinion  is  being 
drafted,  so  that  the  Court  can  be  ready  to  dispose  of 
the  petition  when  the cause  or  per curiam is close  to 
completion.  In such a case, the Court may request full 
briefing  without  an  official  study  memo  ever  being 
prepared;  the  chambers  with  the  per  curiam  or cause 
studies  the  petition,  the  record,  and  the  briefing,  and 
makes  a  recommendation  to  the  Court  on  how  to 

  1

Supreme Court Of Texas Internal Operating Procedures 
 
the  merits  are  due,  and  when  petitioner’s  reply  brief 
on  the  merits  is  due.    The  request  for  full  briefing  is 
invariably accompanied by a request that the court of 
appeals  send  the  appellate  record  to  the  Clerk  of  the 
Supreme Court.  The Clerk usually mails the briefing 
requests the Friday following conference. 

.  Grant Petition for Review  

 
If 4 or more Justices vote to do so, a petition for 
review is granted.  The rules preclude the Court from 
granting a petition without first requesting a response.  
TEX.  R.  APP.  P.  52.4,  53.3.    Nothing  in  the  rules, 
however,  precludes  the  Court  from  granting  the 
petition  before  requesting  a  study  memo  or  full 
briefing on the merits.  As a practical matter, however, 
the Court tries to avoid this and it rarely occurs. 

.  Grant  Petition  for  Writ  of Mandamus  or  Habeas 

Corpus  
It  takes  a  vote  of  5  or  more  Justices  to  grant  a 

 
petition for writ of mandamus or habeas corpus.  

.  Hold  

 
If 6 or more Justices vote to do so, the Court may 
hold off on taking action on a petition.  This may be 
so that the petition can be disposed of with a pending 
cause, or so that further study can be done. 

0.  Per Curiam  

 
If  6  or  more  Justices  vote  to  do  so,  the  Court 
may, without hearing oral argument, grant the petition 
and issue a per curiam opinion in the matter.  TEX. R. 
APP.  P.  59.1.    In  that  event,  the  Chief  Justice  will 
assign a Justice to draft a per curiam opinion, usually 
the  same  Justice  whose  chambers  prepared  the  study 
memo.    Following  further  deliberations,  either  the 
opinion  will  issue  on  5  or  more  votes,  or  the  matter 
will be otherwise disposed of.  In other words, at least 
6  Justices  must  vote  to  issue  a  PC  without  oral 
argument, but only 5 Justices need join in the PC. 

1.  Refuse  

If 6 or more Justices agree, the court of appeals’ 
 
opinion  may  be  refused.    In  practice,  the  Court  will 
generally only consider refusal after a study memo has 
been  prepared,  the  memo  endorses  the  court  of 
appeals’  opinion,  and  the  Court  has  jurisdiction  over 
all issues.  It is the Court’s policy that a petition will 
only be refused after the court of appeals’ opinion has 
been reviewed by a Staff Attorney. 

2.  Improvident Grant  

 
The  Court  may  decide  after  initially  granting 
review,  but  before  issuing  a  decision,  that  review 
never should have been granted in the first place.  In 
that  event,  the  Court  issues  an  “Improvident  Grant” 

  7

(such  as  jurisdiction).    The  law  clerks  are  also 
instructed generally to focus on dispositive issues—if 
the  law  clerk  can  resolve  the  petition  based  on  one 
issue,  the  law  clerk  has  the  discretion  not  to  address 
the  others  unless  the  Court  disagrees  with  the 
resolution  and  sends  it  back  for  the  law  clerk  to 
address the other issues.  It is the responsibility of the 
law  clerk  to  identify  those  issues  that  are  not 
addressed in the study memo. 

.  Reliance  on  Parties’  Briefs  vs.  Independent 

Research  
 
Law  clerks  are  generally  instructed  to  use  the 
briefs  only  as  a  starting  point.    Law  clerks  are 
instructed to  double  check  the  information  (facts  and 
legal authority) presented in the briefs, and then to do 
independent  research  for  authority,  preservation  of 
error, and other dispositive issues that the parties may 
have missed.  The law clerks are specifically charged 
to address error preservation in their study memo. 

.  Study Memo Guidelines  

Law  clerks  are  provided  with  the  Court’s  study 
 
memo  policy.    They  are  also  given  a  study  memo 
orientation,  usually  by  one  of  the  more  senior  Staff 
Attorneys.    The  orientation  includes  review  of  the 
study  memo  policy,  preservation  of  error  principles, 
and  when  to  recommend  a  grant  as  opposed  to  other 
action.  The law clerks may not exceed the Court’s 10-
page (single-space) limit for the study memo without 
the  Chief  Justice’s  permission.    Further  guidelines 
may be provided within each chambers.  Although the 
Justices  are  generally  not  involved  in  the  preparation 
of the memos, the Staff Attorneys generally read, edit, 
and discuss the memos with the law clerks, at least at 
the  beginning  of  the  term.    In  preparing  the  study 
memo,  the  law  clerk  is  charged  to  summarize  each 
side’s  arguments  and  authorities  and  to  provide  an 
objective analysis of each issue.  The law clerk is not 
required to state or frame the issues the same way the 
parties have, or even in the same order.   

.  Law Clerk’s Recommended Disposition  

 
Law clerks are asked to make a recommendation 
of  disposition  to  the  Court—grant,  PC,  deny,  refuse, 
dismiss  WOJ,  or  hold.    The  law  clerk  leaves  that 
question “open” if the law clerk is unable to decide on 
a specific recommended disposition.  If the law clerk 
concludes  that  the  Court  should  grant  a  petition,  the 
clerk  may  simply  recommend  a  “grant”  or  the  law 
clerk  may  recommend  a  “grant”  along  with  a 
proposed resolution of the issue.  Also if the law clerk 
recommends  “refuse,”  the  Court’s  policy  is  to  have 
the  matter  assigned  to  a  Staff  Attorney  for  review  to 
determine if refusal is in fact appropriate.

dispose  of  the  petition  in  light  of  the  per  curiam  or 
cause opinion. 

.  Deadlines  

  3

 
The ordinary rules for filing briefs on the merits 
are  set  out  in  the  appellate  rules.    The  petitioner’s 
opening  brief  is  due  30  days  after  the  notice 
requesting  full  briefing,  the  respondent’s  brief  is  due 
20  days  after  the  petitioner’s  brief,  and  petitioner’s 
reply brief is due 15 days after that.  TEX. R. APP. P.  
55.7.  On  motion  complying  with  Rule  10.5(b),  the 
Court may extend the time for filing these briefs.  Id.  
In  rare  cases,  the  Court  may  decide  to  expedite  full 
briefing.    More  often,  the  deadlines  are  extended 
through motions for extension of time.  Such motions 
are  generally  handled  by  the  Clerk;  the  chambers 
which  has  been  assigned  the  study  memo  is  then 
informed of the extension.  If the Clerk is absent, the 
extension  motions  are  forwarded  for  action  to  the 
chambers assigned the study memo. 

.  Assignment and Preparation of Study Memo  

1.  Manner in Which Assignments are Made  
 
In  most  cases  where  it  requests  full  briefing  on 
the  merits,  the  Court  also  assigns  the  case  to  the 
chambers  of  one  of  the  Justices  for  preparation  of  a 
study  memo.    As  the  Court  makes  its  assignments, 
each successive one is assigned in turn to a Justice in a 
rotation  order  that  begins  with  the  Chief  Justice, 
proceeds down by seniority, and then starts again with 
the  Chief  Justice.    Whichever  chambers  was  next  in 
line  for  assignment  on  the  rotation  at  the  end  of  a 
given conference is first in line at the next conference.  
The  Justice’s  vote  on  the  petition  does  not  affect  the 
assignment  (i.e.,  even  if  a  Justice  votes  to  deny  a 
petition,  the  memo  may  nonetheless  be  assigned  to 
that  Justice’s  chambers).    If,  however,  the  Justice  is 
recused on the petition, the memo will not be assigned 
to  that  Justice’s  chambers.    In  mandamus  or  habeas 
corpus proceedings, the Court may assign the case to 
the  Mandamus  Attorney  for  preparation  of  the  study 
memo,  rather  than  to  the  chambers  of  one  of  the 
Justices.    
 
After  conference,  the  Court’s  Administrative 
Assistant  circulates  a  list  of  all  the  study  memo 
assignments  and  due  dates.    Each  chambers  then 
assigns  study  memos  according  to  their  internal 
system  (which  may 
involve  alternating  memos 
between  law  clerks,  except  where  law  clerk  recusal 
issues  arise,  or 
law  clerk 
workloads).     

it  may  depend  on 

  B

  2

.  Focus on Particular Issues  

 
Sometimes at conference, the Court will instruct 
the  law  clerk  to  focus  on  particular  issues  raised  by 
the  petition,  or  specific  issues  raised  by  the  Court 

 

3.  Treatment in Study Memo  
 
The  law  clerks  are  instructed  to  list  on  the  first 
page of the study memo the names of any amici.  The 
study  memo  will  note  which  side—petitioner  or 
respondent—the amicus supports.  If the arguments in 
the  amicus  brief  are  essentially  the  same  as  those  in 
the  supported  party’s  brief  on  the  merits,  the  study 
memo will merely note that.  If, however, the amicus 
brief  includes  independent  analysis  that  is  different 
from that appearing in the supported party’s brief, the 
study  memo  will  generally  contain  a  more  detailed 
discussion of that independent analysis.   
 
Amici  briefs  can  be  very  helpful  to  the  Justices 
by  identifying  the  practical  impact  of  the  case—e.g., 
describing in concrete terms how a particular outcome 
will  adversely  affect  the  amicus  and  others  similarly 
situated.  In order to have an impact on the substantive 
discussion  appearing  in  the  study  memo,  counsel  for 
an  amicus  should  submit  the  brief  no  later  than  the 
date  the  respondent’s  brief  is  filed  or  very  shortly 
thereafter.  As a general matter, it is better to line up 
amicus  support  at  the  petition  stage  rather  than  wait 
until the merits stage.  

.  Call  for  the  Views  of  the  Solicitor  General 

  When  the  Court  wants  the  Solicitor  General’s 
Office  to  submit  a  brief,  the  Court’s  orders  will 
contain a notation stating that the Solicitor General is 
invited to file a brief in the case.  These requests are 
modeled  after  the  United  State  Supreme  Court’s 
practice  of  inviting  the  U.S.  Solicitor  General  to 
express  views  about  a  matter  pending  before  that 
Court.  These requests appear on the Court’s orders as 
follows: 

(“CVSG”)

SOLICITOR GENERAL INVITED TO FILE 
BRIEF: 

Supreme Court Of Texas Internal Operating Procedures 
 
6.  Deadline for Memo  
 
The  study  memo  is  due  for  circulation  to  the 
Justices 30 days after the response brief on the merits 
is filed.  This allows sufficient time for the law clerk 
to  receive  and  consider  the  petitioner’s  reply  brief, 
which is due 15 days after the response brief.  TEX. R. 
APP.  P.  55.7.    When  the  Court  grants  an  extension 
motion  for  filing  the  reply  brief,  a  corresponding 
change  is  made  to  deadline  for  completing  the  study 
memo—the memo will not be circulated until after the 
extended reply date.    
  When the motion to extend time to file the reply 
brief  on  the  merits  is  unopposed  or  no  response  will 
be filed, the Clerk will inform the chambers assigned 
the study memo that the motion will be granted unless 
otherwise instructed by the chambers.  If the chambers 
objects to extending the deadline to file the reply brief 
on  the  merits,  the  Clerk  will  send  a  letter  indicating 
is  not 
that 
jurisdictional, that  the  reply  can  be  filed  at  any  time,  
and that it will be filed and considered by the Court if 
received  before  the  case  has  been  disposed.    If  the 
reply is filed after the due date for the memorandum, 
the  law  clerk  will  supplement  the  memo  if  a  new 
argument is raised.  Counsel are advised to seek short 
extensions of time to file reply briefs on the merits as 
these shorter extensions are more likely to be granted.  
If  needed,  a  short  extension  of  fifteen  days  is  more 
likely  to  be  granted  than  a  request  for  an  additional 
thirty  days.    And  a  request  for  more  than  thirty  days 
may  result  in  the  Clerk  sending  the  standard  letter 
stating that a reply brief is not jurisdictional, that the 
reply  can  be  filed  at  any  time,  and  that  it  will  be 
considered by the Court if received before the case has 
been disposed of.

.    Review by Justices  
  While  the  practice  varies,  most  Justices  will  not 
review  an  amicus  brief  at  the  time  it  is  submitted, 
unless the Justice is closely monitoring that particular 
case.    Instead,  the  Justices  typically  will  review  the 
amicus  brief  for  the  first  time—shortly  before  the 
conference  at  which  the  study  memo  for  that  case  is 
scheduled  to  be  discussed.    Some  Justices  do  not 
actually review the amicus briefs, but rely instead on 
the study memo’s discussion of any amicus briefs.  
 

 

 
Factors  that  may  trigger  a  supplemental  memo 
include  a  request  by  the  Court  for  clarification  of  a 
particular point in the record.  Additionally, the Court 
may  disagree  with  a  law  clerk’s  assessment  that  a 
particular issue is dispositive and renders unnecessary 
the discussion of other issues; the Court may request a 
supplemental study memo  to discuss the unaddressed 
issues. 

In some cases, many months may go by after the 
 
parties have submitted all their briefing on the merits.  
This  does  not  mean  that  the  Court  has  “forgotten” 
about the case; there is usually an explanation that the 
parties will not be informed of and the Clerk’s office 
is not privileged to convey if asked.  The explanation 
may  be  that  the  Court  has  voted  to  prepare  a  per 
curiam  opinion  and  a  protracted  period  of  time  is 
required  for  that  opinion  to  ultimately  issue.    Or  it 
could be that the Court has decided to “hold” the case 
until either a per curiam opinion issues or a cause has 
been  decided  in  some  other  case  involving  a  similar 
issue  that  is  dispositive.    It  could  also  mean  that  a 
Justice  interested  in  the  case  has  not  been  able  to 
secure  enough  votes  for  a  grant  and  is  attempting  to 
persuade other Justices to go the per curiam route.

.  Voting  on  Disposition  at  Briefs  on  the  Merits 

Stage  

1.    Dispositions Available  
Once  the  case  has  been  fully  briefed  on  the 
 
merits,  by  far  the  most  common  dispositions  are  to 
“grant,” “deny” or “per curiam.”  Less common at this 
stage  is  a  decision  to  dismiss  the  case  for  want  of 
jurisdiction.  Even more rare is a decision to “refuse” 
the  petition.    The  Court  may  also  vote  to  “hold”  the 
petition  pending  issuance  of  a  per  curiam  opinion  or 
the decision of a cause. 

.    Impact of Study Memo on Disposition  

to  follow 

The  law  clerks  are  asked  to  recommend  a 
 
disposition  when 
they  prepare  a  study  memo.  
However,  it  is  frequently  the  case  that  the  Justices 
decline 
the  recommended  disposition.  
Generally speaking, law clerks tend to focus more on 
whether  there  was  error  than  on  whether  the  issue 
involved is important to the development of the state’s 
jurisprudence.    Thus,  a  law  clerk  may  recommend 
“deny”  because,  in  the  clerk’s  opinion,  the  court  of 
appeals committed no error, when, in the view of the 
Justices,  the  core issue is of  sufficient jurisprudential 
importance to warrant review regardless of the merits.   
 
clerk’s 
recommended  disposition,  the  Justices  independently 
scrutinize  whether  to  exercise  their  discretionary 
jurisdiction  in  a  particular  case.    Nonetheless,  the

advance of the next conference.  The agenda includes 
any study memos that have been filed or are due since 
the last conference.  This allows the Justices at least a 
week  to  review  the  memo  before  the  conference  in 
which  the  memo  is  to  be  discussed,  depending  on 
which  day  of  the  week  the  memo  is  actually 
circulated. 

.  No Screening by Justices Before Circulation  

 
Although  each  study  memo  is  assigned  to  a 
particular  chambers  for  preparation,  most  Justices  do 
not  screen  the  memo  before  it  is  circulated—one 
Justice does so fairly consistently and another couple 
of Justices do so occasionally.  

. 

Justices’  Review  of  Study  Memo  vs.  Parties’ 
Briefs  
 
In making their decision to grant or deny review 
at  this  juncture,  the  practices  of  the  Justices  vary.  
Some  may  only  read  the  study  memo,  while  some 
may read the study memo and briefing.  Most Justices 
typically  review  the  study  memos  in  a  batch  before 
conference. 

.  Conference at Briefs on the Merits Stage  

1.    Nature of Discussion  
The  law  clerk  who  prepared  the  study  memo  is 
 
present  in  the  room  during  conference,  but  does  not 
actually  make  a  formal  presentation  of  the  study 
memo.    Instead,  the  law  clerk  is  available  as  a 
resource  in  case  any  of  the  Justices  have  questions.  
The  Chief  Justice  generally  calls  on  those  Justices 
who  have  indicated  some  vote  on  the  yellow  vote 
sheet other than “deny” to allow them the opportunity 
to  present  their  views  or  question  the  law  clerk  who 
prepared the study  memo.  If  4  or  more Justices  have 
already  indicated  an  interest  in  granting  the  case,  the 
discussion  will  typically  be  very  short  if there  is any 
discussion at all.  If the decision to grant or deny is a 
close  one,  however,  the  discussion  may  be  more 
protracted—up to 30 minutes in an unusual case. 

.    Supplemental Study Memo  

 
Occasionally, the Court will table the discussion 
of  a  study  memo  and  request  the  preparation  of  a 
supplemental study memo.  This task is almost always 
assigned  to  the  same  chambers  that  prepared  the 
original  study  memo.    The  supplemental  memo  may 
be  assigned  to  a  different  chambers  if,  for  example, 
the  issue  targeted  for  supplementation  is  one  that  is 
being  addressed  in  another  chambers  as  part  of  its 
preparation  of  a  majority  opinion 
in  a  cause.  
Consequently, in preparing merits briefing, counsel is 
advised  to  let  the  Court  know  if  similar  issues  are 
involved in other matters pending before the Court.

IX.  DIRECT APPEALS 
 
The first  step in  filing  a  direct  appeal  is  filing  a 
statement of jurisdiction along with the record.  Rule 
57.3 states that the appellant must file with the record 
“a  statement  fully  but  plainly  setting  out  the  basis 
asserted 
the  Supreme  Court’s 
jurisdiction.”  Tex. R. App. P. 57.3.  The appellee may 
file  a  response  within  10  days  after  the  date  the 
statement  is  filed.    After  the  Supreme  Court  receives 
the  statement  of  jurisdiction  and  the  record,  it  will 
either note probable jurisdiction or the appeal will be 
dismissed.  Tex.  R.  App. P.  57.4.    If  the  Court  notes 
probable jurisdiction, the parties must file briefs.  Tex. 
R. App. P. 38.   

It  is  important  to  note  that  the  briefing 
requirement is under Rule 38, rather than the briefing 
requirements  for  petitions  for  review  under  Rule  53.  
If  the  Court  declines  jurisdiction,  “any  party  may 
pursue any other appeal available at the time when the 
direct  appeal  was  filed.”    Tex.  R.  App.  P.  57.5.  This 
appeal  must  be  perfected  within  10  days  after  the 
dismissal of the direct appeal.  Id. 

 

See Justice Nathan L. Hecht, TEXAS SUPREME COURT 
PRACTICE MANUAL, State Bar of Texas (2005). 

When filing a direct appeal, you should assist the 
Supreme  Court  Clerk’s  Office  by  filing  a  docketing 
statement  along  with  your  statement  of  jurisdiction 
and  record—otherwise  the  Clerk’s  Office  will  not 
have  all  of  the  necessary  case  information.    Any 
docketing statement used by the courts of appeals will 
suffice. 
 
Direct  appeals  are  sent  to  both  the  Mandamus 
Attorney  and  the  Court.    The  Mandamus  Attorney  is 
responsible  for  making  a  recommendation  regarding 
whether to issue an order noting probable jurisdiction. 

.  MOTIONS  (OTHER  THAN  REHEARING 

MOTIONS) 

A.  Motions to Extend Time (“METs”)  
 
The  Court  has  assigned  METs  to  the  Clerk  for 
disposition.  The Court developed a set of procedures 
to  ensure  consistent  disposition  of  such  motions, 
which are set our below. 
  Motions  for  extension  of  time  filed  must  have  a 
certificate of conference and should make clear in the 
title  or  body  of  the  motion  whether  the  motion  is 
opposed  or  unopposed.    TEX.  R.  APP.  P.  10.1(a)(5).  
Additionally,  each  MET  to  file  a  petition  for  review 
must  provide,  among  other  things,  the  name  of  the 
court  of  appeals,  the  date  of  the  court  of  appeals’ 
judgment, and the case number and style of the case in 
the court of appeals. .  TEX. R. APP. P. 10.5(3).  And 
Rule  10.5(b)(3)(D)  was  added  in  2008  to  require  the 
MET to include the date every motion for rehearing or

II.  ORIGINAL  PROCEEDINGS:  PETITIONS 
FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND HABEAS 
CORPUS 
 
As  discussed  in  passing  above,  two  major 
exceptions  to  the  standard  conveyor  belt  system  for 
petitions are petitions for writ of mandamus in which 
a motion for temporary or emergency relief has been 
filed  and  petitions  for  writ  of  habeas  corpus.    All 
petitions  filed  in  original  proceedings  are  not  held  in 
the  Clerk’s  Office,  but  instead  are  immediately 
forwarded 
  The 
Mandamus Attorney reviews each original proceeding 
to  determine  whether  it  requires  immediate  attention, 
or whether it can be circulated in the ordinary course 
(i.e.  treated  like  a  petition  for  review  that  has  been 
forwarded).    The  Mandamus  Attorney  will  ordinarily 
treat  a  petition  for  writ  of  mandamus 
is 
accompanied by a motion for emergency or temporary 
relief  as  an  expedited  matter  and  make  a 
recommendation to the Court.  Likewise, petitions for 
writ  of  habeas  corpus  are  usually  handled  on  an 
expedited  basis  by  the  Mandamus  Attorney.    Once 
briefs  on  the  merits  are  requested  in  these  matters, 
they  are  usually  assigned  to  a  chambers  for  a  study 
memo. 
 
original 
proceedings  are  similar  to  those  for  petitions  for 
review.    But  there  are  some  important  differences.  
For  example,  petitions  in  original  proceedings  must 
contain a certification signed by the person filing the 
petition  that  he  or  she  has  reviewed  the  petition  and 
concluded  that  every  factual statement in the  petition 
is  supported  by  competent  evidence  included  in  the 
appendix or record.  TEX. R. APP. P. 52.3(j).  And the 
person  filing  the  petition  must  also  file  with  the 
petition a  record containing  certified  or  sworn  copies 
of every document material to the claim for relief, as 
well  as  a  properly  authenticated  transcript  of  any 
relevant  testimony  from  any  underlying  proceeding, 
including any exhibits offered into evidence.  TEX. R. 
APP. P. 52.7.  Be sure to read Texas Rule of Appellate 
Procedure 52 carefully whenever you prepare and file 
a petition or brief in an original proceeding.

language  about  further  requests  being  disfavored  is 
included. 

.  Unopposed MET for Motion for Rehearing 
a.  Of a Cause or Per Curiam Decision  
 
The chambers that authored the majority opinion 
or the per curiam opinion will decide whether to grant 
the MET. 

.  Of a Denied Petition 

The  Clerk’s  Office  processes  these  METs.    The 
 
first  MET  is  granted  for  up  to  30  days;  the  letter 
includes  the  standard language  about further  requests 
being disfavored. 

.  Motions to Abate  

  Motions  to  abate,  whether  for  bankruptcy  or 
settlement  purposes,  are  presented  to  the  Court  for 
action.  The motion is usually accompanied by a short 
memo.    The  Clerk  may  prepare  the  memo  if  time 
permits.    Otherwise,  the  memo  is  prepared  by  the 
motions attorney for the week in which the motion is 
filed.    But  if  the  case  has  already  been  assigned  to  a 
particular  chambers  for  preparation  of  a  study  memo 
or  an  opinion, that  chambers  will  usually  prepare  the 
memo.  The  attorney  authoring 
the  memo  will 
normally  state  that  a  particular  disposition  will  be 
effected  at  a  certain  time  unless  one  of  the  Justices 
objects.

.  Motions to Dismiss Pursuant to Settlement 

 
Parties  may  jointly  move  to  dismiss  if  a  case  is 
settled.    TEX.  R.  APP.  P.  56.3.    Depending  on  the 
particulars  of  the  motion,  the  Court  will  dismiss  the 
petition, vacate the judgments of the lower courts, and 
remand  the  cause  to  the  trial  court  for  rendition  of 
judgment pursuant to the settlement or other requested 
disposition.  Id.  If the dismissal requires granting the 
petition  in  order  to  act  on  the  lower  court(s)’ 
judgments,  the  Court  will  issue  a  judgment  and  a 
mandate.    Settlements  may  not  be  conditioned  upon 
the Court’s vacating the court of appeals’ opinion.  Id.  
Asking  the  Court  to  vacate  the  court  of  appeals’ 
opinion  is  probably  futile  as  the  Court  almost  never 
grants such a request. 

 
Other  motions  are  forwarded  to  the  motions 
attorney  for  the  week  in  which  the  motion  is  filed—
with  two  exceptions.    First,  if  additional  motions  are 
filed in a matter, the attorney who processed the first 
motion  will  process  all  additional  motions  in  that 
matter.    Second,  if  a  matter  has  been  assigned  to  a 
chambers for preparation of a study memo or writing 
an opinion, that Justice will dispose of all motions in

en banc reconsideration was filed, and either the date 
and  nature  of  the  court  of  appeals’  ruling  on  the 
motion, or that it remains pending.  A model MET is 
provided in the Appendix. 
 
The following general rules apply to Unopposed 
METs  for  Petitions  for  Review.    If  the  MET  is 
opposed,  the  Clerk’s  Office  will  inquire  whether 
opposing counsel intends to file any opposition.  If it 
is not clear from the certificate of conference whether 
the  MET  is  opposed,  the  Clerk’s  Office  will  call  the 
movant  and,  if  necessary,  the  nonmovant.    If  no 
certificate  is  present,  the  Clerk  requests  a  certificate 
before  disposing  of  the  motion.    Finally,  no  MET  to 
file  a  petition  for  review  is  ever  denied  without  the 
Court’s approval. 

.  Unopposed MET for Petition for Review  

 
As  a  general rule, the first  MET  will be  granted 
for up to 30 days.  A second will also be granted for 
up  to  30  days,  but  the  grant  letter  will  include 
“standard” language informing the movant that further 
requests  for  extensions  will  be  disfavored.    Parental 
termination  cases  represent  the  exception  to  the 
general  rule—all  standard  times  for  extensions  are 
halved. 

.  Unopposed MET for Response to Petition  

 
If  the  response  was  requested  by  the  Court,  the 
requesting  Justice(s)  will  be  asked  if  they  want  to 
grant  the  extension.    If  so,  it  will  be  granted.    If  the 
response  was  not  requested  by  the  Court,  the  MET 
will be granted for up to 30 days; the grant letter will 
include  the  standard  language  about  further  requests 
being disfavored. 

.  Unopposed  MET  for  Reply  to  Response  to 

Petition  
 
These METs will usually be granted for up to 30 
days  and  standard  language  about  further  requests 
being disfavored is included.

.  Unopposed MET for Petitioner’s Reply Brief on

motion  will  be  granted  unless  the  chambers  instructs 
otherwise.  Normally only short extensions (e.g. 10 to

days  will  rarely,  if  ever,  be  approved.    Standard

2.  Drawing of Opinions  
 
The  Court  usually  conducts  a  random  draw  for 
opinions when it has granted 9 or more petitions that 
are  to  be  scheduled  for  oral  argument  (which,  after 
granting,  become  “causes”).    Before  conducting  the 
draw,  the  Administrative  Assistant  prepares  blue 
index  cards  with  the  cause  number  and  style  of  each 
case  written  on  one  side  of 
  The 
Administrative  Assistant  turns  the  cards  face  down, 
shuffles  the  cards,  and  fans  the  cards  out  while 
continuing  to  hold  the  cards  face  down.    Beginning 
with  the  most  junior  Justice,  each  Justice  then  draws 
one  card  from  the  Administrative  Assistant’s  hand.  
Once  all  the  cards  are  drawn,  the  Administrative 
Assistant records the results of the draw.  The Justice 
who draws the case will ultimately end up writing the 
majority,  a  concurring  or  dissenting  opinion, 
depending  on  the  various  Justices’  views  of  the  case 
following oral argument. 

the  card. 

.  Preparation for Oral Argument  

 
The practices of the Justices in preparing for oral 
argument  vary.    Some  will  look  to  the  study  memo, 
others  to  the  briefs  on  the  merits,  some  to  both,  and 
still  others  will  have  their  chambers  prepare  bench 
memos.    The  Justice  who  has  drawn  the  case  will 
typically devote special effort to preparation, since he 
or she will have the first opportunity to try to fashion a 
majority opinion.  There is no formal pre-submission 
conference—by this stage, most of the Justices have a 
fairly good sense of their colleagues’ views of the case 
based  on  discussions  at  one  or  more  conferences  in 
which  the  Court  considered  whether  to  grant  the 
petition. 
     
4.  Post-submission Conference  
 
post-argument 
discussion  of  the  case  occurs  in  the  first  scheduled 
conference  following  the  argument.    Because  the 
Court 
only 
schedules 
approximately  once  per  month,  this  means  that  the 
Court  could  discuss  up  to  nine  arguments  at  a 
regularly  scheduled  conference.    Assuming  that  the 
Justice who has drawn the case is in the majority after 
the post-submission conference, he or she will draft a 
majority opinion for the Court’s review.  If it is clear 
at  the  post-submission  conference  that  a  dissent  is 
likely,  the  Chief  Justice  may  request  that  a  Justice 
begin drafting the dissent.

By  vote  of  6  of  the  9  Justices,  a  petition  for

Cases  decided  without  oral  argument  are 
typically,  but  not  invariably,  disposed  of  by  per

signed  opinion

for  Deciding  Case  Without  Oral 

Argument  
 
Summary  disposition  without  oral  argument 
provides  a  means  for  the  Court  to  engage  in  error 
correction in cases not involving issues of substantial 
jurisprudential  importance.    It  also  provides  a  means 
for

Court may also elect to issue a signed opinion without

granted to a pro se petitioner.

.  Assignment of Opinion  

 
If the Court votes to issue a per curiam opinion, 
the  Court  may  agree  to  assign  the  case  to  a  Justice 
with  special  familiarity  with  the  issues,  e.g.,  the 
Justice in the chambers that prepared the study memo.  
If that Justice is opposed to the disposition favored by 
the 6 or more Justices who voted in favor of issuing a 
per  curiam opinion,  the  Justice  will  nonetheless 
generally agree to accept the assignment of preparing 
the  opinion.    In  the  rare  case  where  the  Justice  feels 
strongly enough to decline that assignment, the Chief 
Justice will assign the task of preparing the per curiam 
opinion  to  another  Justice  based  on  the  amount  of 
interest shown by and the amount of time available to 
that Justice. 
 
 
B.  Submission With Oral Argument  
1.  Votes Required  
By vote of four of the nine Justices in the case of 
 
petition for review, or the vote of five Justices in the 
case  of  mandamus  or  habeas  corpus,  the  Court  may 
grant review, set the case for oral argument, and notify 
the  parties  of  the  submission  date.    TEX.  R.  APP.  P. 
59.2.   

 

All  proposed  initial  writings  are  due  by  the  last 
conference in April, and all proposed writings are due 
by the last conference in May. 
     
2.  Disposition  
 
After  the  majority  writing  garners  5  or  more 
votes,  and  the  majority  supporters  believe  that  any 
separate writings have been adequately addressed, the 
Court  will  determine  that  the  opinion  should  be 
issued.  The opinion and judgment will issue based on 
the  schedule  determined  at  conference.  Opinions 
typically issue  one to two weeks after conference. 

II.  MOTIONS FOR REHEARING 

 Of Denial of a Petition  

A. 
1.  Distribution  
 
A motion for rehearing of a denial of a petition 
for  review  is  sent  directly  to  the  chambers  of  all  the 
Justices  once  it  is  filed  and  placed  on  the  next 
Tuesday’s vote sheet.   

.  Disposition Without Conference  

The  Tuesday  following  its  distribution  to  all  the 
 
Justices,  the  motion  is  listed  on  the  “purple  vote 
sheet”  along  with  all  other  matters 
requiring 
disposition  by  the  entire  Court.    Like  petitions,  a 
motion for rehearing is thereby placed on a “conveyor 
belt”—if  no Justice takes an  interest, the  motion  will 
be summarily denied in the orders issued by the Court 
31  days  following  its  initially  being  placed  on  the 
conveyor belt. 

.  Disposition With Conference and Required Votes  
 
It  takes  the  vote  of  only  one  Justice  to  pull  a 
motion  for  rehearing  off  the  conveyor  belt.    If  the 
motion  proceeds  to  conference,  it  takes  4  votes  to 
grant  a  motion for rehearing  of  a  denial  of  a  petition 
for review, and 5 votes to grant rehearing of a denial 
of  a  mandamus  or  habeas  corpus  petition.    A  study 
memo could be assigned at this point if 3 Justices vote 
for  it.    This  would  be  most  likely  to  happen  if  no 
study memo was prepared the first time around.  But 
even  if  a  study  memo  was  previously  prepared,  the 
Court  could  assign  a  second  study  memo,  although 
this rarely occurs.  If the motion fails to garner the 3 
votes  required  for  a  study  memo  or  the  4  votes 
required for a grant, some other affirmative action by 
the  Court  is  required  to  save  the  motion  from  being 
denied—absent  an  order  granting  the  motion,  the 
rehearing  motion  will  be  overruled  by  operation  of 
law 180 days after filing.

provide  the  Court  with  pertinent  new  authorities  are 
welcome.  Briefs that more fully or accurately respond 
to  specific  questions  asked  at  oral  argument  can  also 
be  viewed  as  useful.    Most  of  the  Justices  will  read

A.  Opinions Issued Without Oral Argument  
1.  Per Curiam Opinions  
  When  the  Court  votes  to  issue  a  per  curiam 
opinion, a draft opinion is usually circulated within 60 
days.    Because  the  per  curiam  opinion  is  almost 
invariably  assigned 
that 
prepared  the  study  memo,  this  expedites  drafting  of 
the  opinion.    On  some  occasions,  contrary  views 
appear  after  circulation  of  the  draft  per  curiam 
opinion  so  that  the  case  is  ultimately  set  for  oral 
argument or becomes a signed opinion.

.  Signed Opinions Without Oral Argument  

 
On rare occasions, a dissent or concurrence may 
appear after circulation of a draft per curiam opinion, 
but  the  decision  is  made  not  to  set  the  case  for  oral 
argument.    In  such  a  case,  the  draft  per  curiam 
opinion  is  converted  into  a  signed  opinion  without 
oral  argument,  accompanied  by  the  separate  opinion.  
On  other  rare  occasions,  the  Court  has  issued  signed 
opinions  without  oral  argument  and  without  a 
dissenting opinion.

.  Opinions Issued After Oral Argument  

1.  Circulation of Draft Opinions  
 
A  draft  opinion  of  the  Court  in  a  cause  is 
generally circulated after oral argument according to a 
schedule adopted by the Court at the beginning of the 
Term.    The  Chief  Justice  calls  on  the  author  of  the 
opinion  to  explain  why  the  opinion  should  be 
embraced  by  a  majority  of  the  Court.    Then  others 
around  the  table  are  given  an  opportunity  to  express 
their views. Following the conference, any concurring 
or  dissenting  opinions  are  circulated  within  60  days. 
These  opinions  are  scheduled  and  discussed  at 
conference in similar fashion.  At conference, on some 
occasions, what was going to be the majority opinion 
no longer attracts a majority of the Justices and, thus, 
the  opinion  must  be  transformed  into  a  dissent  and 
vice versa.  When any draft opinion is circulated to the 
Justices, it is frequently the case that various Justices 
at  conference  suggest  changes  that  are  changes 
ultimately made by the author.  A Justice may pull an 
opinion  for  further  study  if  that  Justice  is  unsure 
whether to join the opinion or to suggest changes. 

 

The  Court’s  internal  operating  procedures  have 
 
remained  largely  unchanged  over  the  past  several 
years.    Although  the  Court  approved  substantial 
revisions to the Rules of Appellate Procedure in 2008, 
these  changes  brought  little  change  to  the  Court’s 
internal  operating  procedures.    But  the  Court  has 
received a proposal to make the petition process more 
similar  to  the  process  used  by  the  United  States 
Supreme Court. This proposal would remove the two-
stage  briefing  process  for  all  but  granted  cases.  In 
other  words,  merit  briefing  would  only  be  requested 
for  cases  that  are  granted  and  set  for  argument.  The 
Court is taking this proposal seriously. If adopted, the 
proposal  would  have  a  major  impact  on  the  Court’s 
internal operating procedures.

Supreme Court Of Texas Internal Operating Procedures 
 
curiam  decision  is  distributed  to  all  members  of  the 
Court  once  it  is  filed.    A  motion  for  rehearing  of  a 
cause  or  PC,  however,  is  accorded  additional  special 
treatment.  Such a motion is initially processed by the 
chambers that drafted the majority opinion in the case.  
The  staff  prepares  a  brief  memo  to  the  Court 
the  arguments  on 
summarizing  and  analyzing 
rehearing.    The  deadline  for  preparing  the  rehearing 
memo  is  30  days  after  filing  of  the  motion  for 
rehearing.   This  deadline  is  not affected  by  the filing 
or non-filing of a response.  The memo writer usually 
makes a recommendation to grant or deny the motion.  
Once completed, the rehearing memo is circulated and 
the matter is placed on the agenda for discussion at the 
next  scheduled  conference.    If  the  rehearing  motion 
raises  matters 
the  Court  believes  merit  a 
response—such  as  factual matters  that  were  not  fully 
addressed  in  the  Court’s  opinion—the  Court  will 
request  a  response.    In  no  event  will  the  Court  grant 
rehearing without requesting a response if one has not 
already been filed.  TEX. R. APP. P 64.3.  The current 
practice  is  that  only  the  chambers  responsible  for 
preparing the rehearing memo can request a response.  

that 

.  Participation by New Justices in Rehearing  

 
The  former  practice  was  that  Justices  who  were 
not sitting on the Court at the time the initial opinion 
and judgment were issued, could not participate in the 
decision to grant or deny rehearing.  That practice has 
changed.    New  Justices  are  now  permitted  to  decide 
they 
rehearing  motions, 
participated in the initial decision.  A new Justice may 
also ask that the case be reargued. 

regardless  whether 

.  Disposition and Required Votes  

  Motions  for  rehearing  of  causes  or  PCs  are 
infrequently  granted.    The  Court  may  re-issue  the 
opinion  with  changes  to  address  issues  raised  by  the 
motion for rehearing, but unless the Court changes the 
judgment,  it  will  generally  deny  the  motion  for 
rehearing.  Only rarely will a rehearing motion result 
in the judgment being altered.  It takes 5 votes to grant 
a motion for rehearing of a cause or PC. 

.  No Successive Motions  

 
If  the  Court  denies  a  motion  for  rehearing,  the 
Court ordinarily will not consider a second motion for 
rehearing.    TEX.  R.  APP.  P.  64.4.    The  Court  will 
consider  an  additional  motion  for  rehearing  if  the 
Court modifies its judgment, vacates its judgment and 
renders a new judgment, or issues a different opinion.  
Id.    When  the  Court  modifies  its  opinion  without 
modifying its judgment, the Court will ordinarily deny 
a second motion for rehearing unless the new opinion 
is substantially different from the original opinion.  Id. 
(Notes and Comments to 2008 changes).
