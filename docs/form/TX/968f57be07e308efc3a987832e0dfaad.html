Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 145 is amended to read as follows. 

ule 145. Payment of Costs Not Required 

Costs  Defined.  “Costs”  mean  any  fee  charged  by  the  court  or  an  officer  of  the 
court that could be taxed in a bill of costs, including filing fees, fees for issuance 
and  service  of  process,  fees  for  a  court-appointed  professional,  and  fees  charged 
by the clerk or court reporter for preparation of the appellate record. 

b)  General  Rule.  A  party  who  files  a  Statement  of  Inability  to  Afford  Payment  of 
Court  Costs  cannot  be  required  to  pay  costs  except  by  order  of  the  court  as 
provided by this rule. After the Statement is filed, the clerk must docket the case, 
issue citation, and provide any other service that is ordinarily provided to a party. 
The Statement must either be sworn to before a notary or made under penalty of 
perjury. In this rule, “declarant” means the party filing the Statement. 

Supreme  Court  Form;  Clerk  to  Provide.  The  declarant  must  use  the  form 
Statement  approved  by  the  Supreme  Court,  or  the  Statement  must  include  the 
information required by the Court-approved form. The clerk must make the form 
available to all persons without charge or request. 

d)  Defects.  The  clerk  may  refuse  to  file  a  Statement  that  is  not  sworn  to  before  a 
notary or made under penalty of perjury.  No other defect is a ground for refusing 
to file a Statement or requiring the party to pay costs. If a defect or omission in a 
Statement is material, the court—on its own motion or on motion of the clerk or 
any party—may direct the declarant to correct or clarify the Statement. 

Evidence  of  Inability  to  Afford  Costs  Required.  The  Statement  must  say  that  the 
declarant cannot afford to pay costs, or can afford to pay only part of the costs, or 
can  afford  to  pay  costs  only  over  time.  The  declarant  must  provide  in  the 
Statement,  and,  if  available,  in  attachments  to  the  Statement,  evidence  of  the 
declarant’s inability to afford costs, such as evidence that the declarant: 

(1) 

(2) 

receives  benefits  from  a  government  entitlement  program,  eligibility  for 
which is dependent on the recipient’s means; 

is being represented in the case by an attorney who is providing free legal 
services to the declarant, without contingency, through: 

(A) 

a provider funded by the Texas Access to Justice Foundation; 

(B) 

a provider funded by the Legal Services Corporation; or

a  nonprofit  that  provides  civil  legal  services  to  persons  living  at  or 
below 200% of the federal poverty guidelines published annually by 
the United States Department of Health and Human Services; 

(3) 

has applied for free legal services for the case through a provider listed in 
(e)(2)  and  was  determined  to  be  financially  eligible  but  was  declined 
representation; or 

(4) 

does not have funds to afford payment of costs. 

f) 

Requirement  to  Pay  Costs  Notwithstanding  Statement.  The  court  may  order  the 
declarant to pay costs only as follows: 

(1)  On  Motion  by  the  Attorney  Ad  Litem  for  a  Parent  in  Certain  Cases,  the 
Clerk,  or  a  Party.  The  attorney  ad  litem  for  a  parent  in  a  suit  filed  by  a 
governmental entity in which termination of the parent-child relationship or 
the  appointment  of  a  conservator  for  a  child  is  sought,  the  clerk,  or  any 
party  may  move  to  require  the  declarant  to  pay  costs  only  if  the  motion 
contains sworn evidence, not merely on information or belief: 

(A) 

that the Statement was materially false when it was made; or 

(B) 

that  because  of  changed  circumstances,  the  Statement  is  no  longer 
true in material respects. 

(2)  On  Motion  by  the  Court  Reporter.  When  the  declarant  requests  the 
preparation of a reporter’s record but cannot make arrangements to pay for 
it,  the  court  reporter  may  move  to  require  the  declarant  to  prove  the 
inability to afford costs. 

(3)  On  the  Court’s  Own  Motion.  Whenever  evidence  comes  before  the  court 
that  the  declarant  may  be  able  to  afford  costs,  or  when  an  officer  or 
professional  must  be  appointed  in  the  case,  the  court  may  require  the 
declarant to prove the inability to afford costs. 

(4) 

Notice  and  Hearing.  The  declarant  may  not  be  required  to  pay  costs 
without an evidentiary hearing. The court must give 21 days’ notice of the 
hearing. At the hearing, the burden is on the declarant to prove the inability 
to afford costs. 

(5) 

Findings  Required.  An  order  requiring  the  declarant  to  pay  costs  must  be 
supported by detailed findings that the declarant can afford to pay costs.

(6) 

Partial and Delayed Payment. The court  may  order that the  declarant pay 
the  part  of  the  costs  the  declarant  can  afford  or  that  payment  be  made  in 
installments.  But  the  court  must  not  delay  the  case  if  payment  is  made  in 
installments. 

g) 

Review of Trial Court Order.  

(1)  Only Declarant May Challenge; Motion. Only the declarant may challenge 
an  order  issued  by  the  trial  court  under  this  rule.  The  declarant  may 
challenge the order by motion filed in the court of appeals with jurisdiction 
over an appeal from the judgment in the case. The declarant is not required 
to pay any filing fees related to the motion in the court of appeals.  
 
Time for Filing; Extension. The motion must be filed within 10 days after 
the  trial  court’s  order  is  signed,  unless  the  court  of  appeals  grants  the 
declarant an extension. 

(2) 

Record.  After  a  motion  is  filed,  the  court  of  appeals  must  promptly  send 
notice to the trial court clerk and the court reporter requesting preparation 
of  the  record  of  all  trial  court  proceedings  on  the  declarant’s  claim  of 
indigence.  The  court  may  set  a  deadline  for  filing  the  record.  The  record 
must be provided without charge. 

4)  Court of Appeals to Rule Promptly. The court of appeals must rule on the 

motion at the earliest practicable time. 

Judgment.  The  judgment  must  not  require  the  declarant  to  pay  costs,  and  a 
provision in the judgment purporting to do so is void, unless the court has issued 
an order under (f), or the declarant has obtained a monetary recovery out of which 
costs can be paid.

omment to 2016 Change: The rule has been rewritten. Access to the civil justice system 
cannot  be  denied  because  a  person  cannot  afford  to  pay  court  costs.  The  issue  is  not 
merely whether a person can pay costs, but  whether the person can afford to pay costs. 
Experience  indicates  that  almost  all  filers  described  in  (e)(1)-(3),  and  most  filers 
described  in  (e)(4),  cannot  in  fact  afford  to  pay  costs.  Because  costs  to  access  the 
system—filing  fees,  fees  for  issuance  of  process  and  notices,  and  fees  for  service  and 
return—are kept relatively small, the expense involved in challenging a claim of inability 
to afford costs often exceeds the costs themselves. Thus, the rule does not allow the clerk 
or  a  party  to  challenge  a  litigant’s  claim  of  inability  to  afford  costs  without  sworn 
evidence that the claim is false. The filing of a Statement of Inability to Afford Payment 
of Court Costs—which may either be sworn to before a notary or made under penalty of 
perjury,  as  permitted  by  Civil  Practice  and  Remedies  Code  §  132.001—is  all  that  is 

Misc. Docket No. 16-9056 

Page 5 

needed  to  require  the  clerk  to  provide  ordinary  services  without  payment  of  fees  and 
costs.  But  evidence  may  come  to  light  that  the  claim  was  false  when  made.  And  the 
declarant’s  circumstances  may  change,  so  that  the  claim  is  no  longer  true.  Importantly, 
costs may increase with the appointment of officers or professionals in the case, or when 
a reporter’s record must be prepared. The reporter is always allowed to challenge a claim 
of inability to afford costs before incurring the substantial expense of record preparation. 
The trial court always retains discretion to require evidence of an inability to afford costs.

Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 502 is amended as demonstrated below. 

ule 502.  Institution of Suit 

ule 502.3.  Fees; Inability to Pay Afford Fees 

Fees and Statement of Inability to Pay Afford Payment of Court Costs.  On filing 
the  petition,  the  plaintiff  must  pay  the  appropriate  filing  fee  and  service  fees,  if 
any, with the court.  A plaintiff who is unable to afford to pay the fees must file a 
sworn  sStatement  of  iInability  to  pay  Afford  Payment  of  Court  Costs.    The 
Statement  must  either  be  sworn  to  before  a  notary  or  made  under  penalty  of 
perjury.  Upon  filing  the  sStatement,  the  clerk  must  docket  the  action,  issue 
citation, and provide any other customary services.   

Supreme Court Form; Contents of Statement of Inability to Pay. The plaintiff must 
use  the  form  Statement  approved  by  the  Supreme  Court,  or  the  Statement  must 
include  the  information  required  by  the  Court-approved  form.  The  clerk  must 
make the form available to all persons without charge or request.  

(1) 

(2) 

The statement must contain complete information as to the party=s identity, 
nature and amount of governmental entitlement income, nature and amount 
of  employment  income,  other  income  (interest,  dividends,  etc.),  spouse=s 
income  if  available  to  the  party,  property  owned  (other  than  homestead), 
cash or checking account, dependents, debts, and monthly expenses. 

The statement must contain the following: AI am unable to pay court fees. I 
verify that the statements made in this statement are true and correct.@ The 
statement must be sworn before a notary public or other officer authorized 
to administer oaths or be signed under penalty of perjury. 

IOLTA Certificate of Legal-Aid Provider. If the party is represented by an attorney 
who  is  providing  free  legal  services  because  of  the  party=s  indigence,  without 
contingency,  and  the  attorney  is  providing  services  either  directly  or  by  referral 
from  a  program  funded  by  the  Interest  on  Lawyers  Trust  Accounts  (IOLTA) 
program  legal-aid  provider  described  in  Rule  145(e)(2),  the  attorney  may  file  an 
IOLTA a certificate confirming that the IOLTA funded program provider screened 
the  party  for  income  eligibility  under  the  IOLTA  income  and  asset  guidelines 
established  by  the  provider.  A  party=s  sStatement  of  inability  to  pay  that  is 
accompanied  by  an  attorney=s  IOLTA  the  certificate  of  a  legal-aid  provider  may

Contest.  Unless an IOLTA a certificate is filed under (c), the defendant may file a 
contest of the sStatement of inability to pay at any time within 7 days after the day 
the defendant=s answer is due.  If the sStatement attests to receipt of government 
entitlement based on indigence, the sStatement may only be contested with regard 
to  the  veracity  of  the  attestation.    If  contested,  the  judge  must  hold  a  hearing  to 
determine the plaintiff=s ability to pay afford the fees.  At the hearing, the burden 
is  on  the  party  who  filed  the  statement  plaintiff  to  prove  its  the  inability  to  pay 
afford  fees.    The  judge  may,  regardless  of  whether  the  defendant  contests  the 
sStatement,  examine  the  sStatement  and  conduct  a  hearing  to  determine  the 
plaintiff=s  ability  to  pay  afford  fees.    If  the  judge  determines  that  the  plaintiff  is 
able to afford the fees, the judge must enter a written order listing the reasons for 
the determination, and the plaintiff must pay the fees in the time specified in the 
order or the case will be dismissed without prejudice.

Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 20 is amended to read as follows. 

ule 20.  Payment of Costs Not Required 

0.1  Civil Cases 

Costs Defined. In this rule, “costs” mean filing fees charged by the appellate court. 
Fees charged for preparation of the appellate  record are governed by  Texas Rule 
of Civil Procedure 145. 
 

(b)  General  Rule;  Status  in  Trial  Court  Carries  Forward.  A  party  who  filed  a 
Statement  of  Inability  to  Afford  Payment  of  Court  Costs  in  the  trial  court  is  not 
required  to  pay  costs  in  the  appellate  court  unless  the  trial  court  overruled  the 
party’s  claim  of  indigence  in  an  order  that  complies  with  Texas  Rule  of  Civil 
Procedure 145. A party is not required to pay costs in the appellate court if the trial 
court ordered the party to pay partial costs or to pay costs in installments. 
 
Establishing the Right to Proceed Under the General Rule. To establish the right 
to proceed without payment of costs under (b), a party  must communicate to the 
appellate court clerk in writing that the party is presumed indigent under this rule. 
In an appeal under Section Two of these rules, the applicability of the presumption 
should be stated in the notice of appeal and in the docketing statement.  

(c) 

Exception;  Material  Change  in  Circumstances.  An  appellate  court  may  permit  a 
party who is not entitled to proceed under (b) to proceed without payment of costs 
if  the  party  establishes  that  the  party’s  financial  circumstances  have  materially 
changed  since  the  date  of  the  trial  court’s  order  under  Texas  Rule  of  Civil 
Procedure 145. 

 

(1) 

(2) 

Requirements. The party must file a motion in the appellate court alleging 
that  the  party’s  financial  circumstances  have  materially  changed  since  the 
date of the trial court’s order and a current Statement of Inability to Afford 
Payment of Court Costs that complies with Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 
145.  The  Statement  that  was  filed  in  the  trial  court  does  not  meet  the 
requirements of this rule. 
 
Action  by  Appellate  Court.  The  appellate  court  may  decide  the  motion 
based on the record or refer the motion to the trial court with instructions to 
hear evidence and issue findings of fact. If a motion is referred to the trial 
court,  the  appellate  court  must  review  the  trial  court’s  findings  and  the 
record of the hearing before ruling on the motion.

omment to 2016 Change:  

  C

The  rule  has  been  rewritten  so  that  it  only  governs  filing  fees  and  any  other  fee 
charged  by  the  appellate  court.  Texas  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  145  governs  a  party’s 
claim that the party is unable to afford costs for preparation of the appellate record. 

ecause  appellate  filing  fees  are  minimal,  a  party  that  filed  a  Statement  of 
Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs in the trial court is not required to file a new 
Statement  in  the  appellate  court  unless  the  trial  court  made  affirmative  findings  under 
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 145 that the party is able to afford all court costs and to 
pay those costs as they are incurred. Furthermore, because a determination of indigence 
by the trial court carries forward to appeal in all cases, Family  Code section 107.013 is 
satisfied. 
 

Experience has shown that, in most cases, a party’s financial circumstances do not 
change  substantially  between  the  trial  court  proceedings  and  the  appellate  court 
proceedings. Nonetheless, (d) permits a party whom the trial court determined is able to 
afford all costs to demonstrate to the appellate court that the party’s circumstances have 
changed since the trial court’s ruling and that the party is unable to afford appellate filing 
fees.
