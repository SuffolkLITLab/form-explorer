PECIAL COMMITTEE:  

Judge Dean Rucker, Chairman; Judge Missy Medary; Judge 
Billy  Ray  Stubblefield;  Judge  David  L.  Evans;  Judge  Sid 
Harle 

On January 7, 2021, Petitioner requested from the Office of Court Administration (OCA) 
any emails sent to the email domain for OCA (TXcourts.gov) from an email address attributed to 
a presiding judge of an administrative judicial region that mentioned the Petitioner’s name or any 
variations of his name for the period January 1, 2019 through January 7, 2021. Petitioner further 
requested any emails sent from the email address of the identified presiding judge that mentioned 
Petitioner’s name or any variants of his name for the same period. Petitioner’s email, directed to 
OCA’s  General  Counsel,  was  copied  to  more  than  a  dozen  judicial  agency  officials,  including 
selected  presiding  judges  of  the  administrative  judicial  regions  or  their  support  staff,  a  former 
regional presiding judge, an OCA staff person, and the Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court. 

On January 15, 2021, counsel for OCA sent a response to Petitioner stating that because 
(1)  Petitioner  had  requested  records  from  OCA’s  email  domain,  (2)  the  email  domain  was 
maintained by OCA, and (3) none of the individuals copied on the request were the custodians of 
the records responsive to the request, OCA would be the sole Respondent to Petitioner’s request. 
OCA denied Petitioner’s request, explaining that the records responsive to the request were not 
“judicial  records”  as  defined  by  Rule  12.2(d)  because  the  records  pertained  to  the  adjudicative 
function  of  matters  that  had  been  before  previous  special  committees,  and  were  therefore  not 
subject to Rule 12. OCA further explained that, even if the responsive records were subject to Rule 
12, the records would be exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5. 

On January 25, 2021, Petitioner initiated this appeal, disputing that OCA was the proper 
records  custodian  and  alleging  that  because  the  identified  regional  presiding  judge  failed  to 
respond  to  Petitioner’s  Rule  12  request  within  the  proper  timeframe,  the  records  sought  are 
“deemed to be public records.” Lastly, on February 14, 2021, Petitioner made a request for a new 
special committee, alleging that because OCA lacked standing to submit a response its response 
“tainted” the appeal.   

We first address Petitioner’s request for a new special committee. Petitioner offers only 
conclusory allegations to support his request, and as the Petitioner has not provided evidence to 
support his request it is denied.

We now address the merits of the Petitioner’s appeal. Petitioner cites no legal authority for 
his determination that the records sought are deemed to be public records. A close examination of 
Rule  12  reveals  the  absence  of  any  provision  that  automatically  discloses  records  for  a 
respondent’s failure to comply with Rule 12.8. Constrained by language of Rule 12, the special 
committee  cannot  read  a  “deemed  public”  disclosure  provision  into  Rule  12.8.  Petitioner  also 
alleges that OCA was not the proper custodian of the records the subject of Petitioner’s Rule 12 
request. Rule 12 contemplates that judicial records requests can and will be submitted to the wrong 
party, Rule 12.6(f), and Rule 12 demands good faith and reasonableness in replying to requests. 
See  Rule  12.1,  Rule  12.4,  Rule  12.6(b),  and  Rule  12.6(f).  Petitioner  sent  his  request  to  OCA 
General Counsel, addressed his request to “TX Courts,” and received a timely response from OCA 
acting  as  the  actual  respondent  in  the  records  request.  Petitioner  did  not  object  to  OCA’s 
characterization of itself as the proper custodian and sole respondent to Petitioner’s request until 
after the Rule 12.8(b) timeframe had passed for the identified regional presiding judge’s duty to 
respond. OCA reasonably interpreted Petitioner’s request to be directed to “TX Courts” in toto and 
made a good faith effort to respond to Petitioner as the sole custodian of all records sought in the 
request. We therefore conclude that the OCA is the actual respondent in this appeal.1   
 

Having  resolved  that  OCA  is  the  proper  respondent  to  the  request  at  issue,  the  special 
committee notes that Petitioner has not appealed the denial of access to information withheld by 
the OCA. Should Petitioner wish to appeal the denial of access by OCA, the Petitioner must inform 
the  special  committee  by  no  later  than  14  days  after  the  date  of  this  opinion’s  issuance. 
Alternatively,  Petitioner remains  free to  initiate  a  new  Rule  12 records request  to  the  presiding 
judge identified in Petitioner’s January 7, 2021 request. 

1  The  special committee is  aware  that the  appeal’s  initial  styling  identified a  presiding  judge  of an  administrative 
judicial region as the respondent in this case. However, nothing in Rule 12.9 renders an appeal’s styling and OCA’s 
decision in labeling an appeal as determinative of an appeal’s merits.
