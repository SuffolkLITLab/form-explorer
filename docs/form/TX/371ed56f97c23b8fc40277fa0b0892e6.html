1.0        Executive Summary 

On  November  19,  2007  the  Supreme  Court  of  Texas  in  Misc.  Docket  No.  07-91  94  issued  its 
“Order  Creating  Task  Force  to  Ensure  Judicial  Readiness  In  Times  of  Emergency.”   The  Task 
Force  has  the  responsibility  of  recommending  to  the  Supreme  Court  of  Texas  a  Judicial 
Continuity of Operations Plan (JCOOP) for all courts in Texas. 

1.1        Introduction 

Disruptive  events  early  in  this  millennium  have  alerted  Texans  to  the  need  for  the  executive, 
legislative and judicial branches of government to establish coordinated, state-wide Continuity of 
Operations  Plans  (COOPs)  to  ensure  that,  even  during  times  of  disaster,  state  government  can 
provide uninterrupted essential services to its citizens.   Texas judges must be able to continue to 
provide  essential  juridical  services  during  emergency  situations,  whether  the  crisis  arises  from 
natural  disasters,  terrorism,  technical  breakdowns,  civil  unrest,  pandemic  or  other  catastrophes. 
As highly visible symbols of government under the rule of law, judges have a duty to provide a 
stabilizing  influence  during  periods  of  disorder  and  to  help  return  society  to  a  semblance  of 
normality.  This duty includes resuming normal governmental operations as quickly as possible. 

This  document  is  an  interim plan;  if  a  county  wishes  to  make  provisions  for  additional  sites  to 
conduct court within the county and does not need assistance from its neighbors, it is encouraged 
to  do  so.    This  interim  plan  is  designed  to  assist  local  judicial  officials  to  continue  essential 
operations  during  emergencies  until  the  Legislature  passes  future  legislation  addressing  these 
issues and/or individual counties create their own COOPs. 

1.2       Purpose 

The  goal  of  the  JCOOP  is  to  ensure  that  essential  juridical  services  are  available  to  those  who 
seek access to the court when a courthouse is unavailable or inoperable.   Adjunct court services 
provided  by  executive  branch  personnel,  including  court  clerks,  court  reporters,  security 
personnel, etc. should be the subject of their respective COOPs. 

1.3       Definitions 

CJ - The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Texas. 

CJA - The Chief Justice of any intermediate Appellate Court. 

COOP  -  The  Continuity  of  Operations  Plan  is  a  plan  for  the  executive,  legislative  and  judicial 
branches  of  Texas  state  government  to  provide  coordinated,  state-wide  essential  services  to  its 
citizens in the event of an emergency. 

Disruption of court operations – The ceasing of normal court business because of a large scale 
emergency. 

Emergency – A disaster or unforeseen event that precludes a court from conducting business. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Interim Plan 

Page 2 of 13 

Essential court personnel – The minimum amount of staff needed for justice administration in 
the event of disaster or emergency. 

JCOOP – The Judicial Continuity of Operations Plan is the plan for the state judicial branch of 
Texas government to provide essential court services to its citizens in the event of an emergency. 

LAJ – The Local Administrative Judge as defined in section 74.091  of the Texas Government 
Code. 

M.O.U. – Memorandum of Understanding between the Supreme Court of Texas and any county 
supporting  the  continuity  of  court  operations  of  another  county  in  the  event  of  an  emergency. 
(Appendix B - Form MOU attached) 

Necessary  court  proceedings  –  Judicial  proceedings,  which  may  require  court  action  or 
issuance of an order, and must take place within a specific time period to ensure due process of 
law for all citizens. 

PJ – The Presiding Judge of an Administrative Region as described in Chapter 74 of the Texas 
Government Code. 

Supreme Court – Shall mean the Supreme Court of Texas. 

1.4       Applicability and Scope 

This JCOOP, while voluntary in nature, applies to all members of the state judiciary – from trial 
to appellate courts. When a county LAJ or CJA determines that a disruptive event has occurred 
that will interfere with essential judicial services, the JCOOP shall be implemented immediately. 
At  the  CJA  or  the  LAJ’s  discretion,  the  MOU  shall  be  activated  to  ensure  that  essential  court 
operations in a designated county can continue with minimal delay and interruption.  During the 
period  of  disruption,  the  CJ  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  Texas  and/or  the  PJ  of  the  affected 
Administrative  Region  has  the  discretion  to  implement  such  MOUs  as  necessary  to  provide 
essential services to the citizens of the State of Texas. 

1.5       How to Use this Plan 

This JCOOP is organized so as to provide notice to judges and officers of the court who wish to 
provide essential judicial services during periods of disruption.  The Supreme Court and specific 
counties will implement the appropriate MOUs. 

2.0        JCOOP Implementation 

To  implement  this  JCOOP,  judicial  officers  within  an  affected  county  who  wish  to  provide 
essential judicial  services during a period of disruption  shall give such notice in writing.   Once 
the CJ of the Texas Supreme Court or the PJ of the affected region receives such notice, the CJ 
or the PJ shall make a written designation that the assistance of a specific county is required to 
ensure the continued operation of the essential business of judges of a designated county. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Interim Plan 

Page 3 of 13 

Such written notice shall be by internet website and activated emergency e-mail addresses for the 
judges of the designated courts.   Designation shall be made in accordance with the MOUs with 
the  several  specific  counties.    Once  the  MOU  is  implemented,  the  judges  of  the  designated 
county  shall  conduct  their  essential  operations  in  the  specific  county  in  accordance  with  the 
terms of the MOU. (See Appendix A for Communication Plan recommendations) 

Regardless  of  the  cause  of  the  disruption,  this  JCOOP  is  designed  to  ensure  that  essential 
juridical services will be available to the citizens of the State of Texas as soon as possible. 

3.0        Planning Assumptions 

3.1        JCOOP Plan Phases 

Phase I: This JCOOP shall be executed by activation of one or more MOUs in accordance with 
the discretionary decision of the elected local judges, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of 
Texas,  the  Chief  Justice  of  any  intermediate  Appellate  Court,  and/or  the  Presiding  Judge  of  an 
Administrative Region. 

Phase II: Once activated, subsequent alternate sites for essential operations may be required and 
activated at the discretion of the  elected local judges, the CJ, CJA, and/or the PJ of an affected 
region. 

Phase  III:  Recovery  and  reconstitution  of  juridical  services  by  the  judge/judges  of  the 
designated  county/counties  shall  proceed  rapidly  in  accordance  with  recovery  plans  of  the 
appropriate adjunct services which assist the judges in performance of juridical services. 

4.0       JCOOP Elements 

4.1        Alert and Notification 

Court  officers  shall  receive  notice  by  appropriate  postings  on  the  designated  county’s  website. 
Notice  should  be  sent  to  three  e-mail  addresses  maintained  for  the  subject  judge/judges  (e.g. 
hotmail,  gmail,  SBC,  EarthLink,  etc.)   To  avoid  notification  default  because  a  service  provider 
fails,  judges  should  maintain  three  e-mail  addresses.   During  periods  of  disruption,  the  subject 
judge  may  personally  survey  e-mail  communications  from  parties  seeking  essential  juridical 
services,  or  designate  an  adjunct  service  provider  to  maintain  communication  surveillance  and 
report the needs of affected court officers to the judge. 

4.2        Essential Juridical Functions 

Upon receiving a request of a court officer for access to juridical services, the subject judge shall 
address the necessary essential juridical functions.  The subject judge shall provide the requested 
resources in the priority established at the judge’s discretion or in the order in which the judge is 
notified of the request for juridical services.

4.3        Order of Succession 

Each  judge  shall  respond  to  the  instructions  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  Texas  or  the  Presiding 
Judge  of  an  Administrative  Region.   Such  instructions  may  modify  the  order  of  succession  as 
needed  to  provide  essential  juridical  services.    The  Supreme  Court  or  the  PJ  of  the  affected 
region shall give appropriate notice to the subject officer of the court seeking essential juridical 
functions. 

4.4       Delegations of Authority 

Unless  delegated  to  another  entity  or  judge,  all  administrative  authority  shall  remain  with  the 
Supreme Court or the PJ of the affected region. 

As  deemed  necessary  by  the  implementing  authority  and/or  the  local  elected  judge,  alternate 
court sites shall be identified in accordance with the terms of MOUs. 

Communications with a judge shall be maintained through the e-mail addresses published on the 
subject county website. 

4.5       Alternate Sites 

4.6       Communications 

4.7       Devolution 

Whenever  requested,  each  judge’s  essential  juridical  services  shall  devolve  as  directed  to  the 
Supreme Court of Texas or the Presiding Judge of an Administrative Region. 

4.8       Recovery/Reconstitution 

Transition from designation status to pre-disruptive event status shall be in accordance with the 
MOU.      The  implementing  entity  shall  direct  resumption  of  normal  services  as  it  deems 
appropriate. 

5.0       Specific Procedure 

5.1       Delineations 

Within the framework of the plan, the necessity arises for specific instructions to be carried out 
in the event of an emergency. To simplify the process, emergency events have been categorized 
into with warning and without warning. 

5.2       Immediate Actions 

This plan is designed to provide guidance in times of emergency; however, certain preparations 
must be made before an emergency exists.   To fully maximize the potential of this interim plan 
parties should: 

5.2.1 

Review COOP for county and instruct staff to follow.

Communication Plan Recommendations  

Recommendation:  Our recommendation is the use of a mobile smartphone: 

APPENDIX A  

iOS (iPhones)

  T

eason for Mobile Smartphone:  During the last few major incidents that have affected the Texas Gulf 
Coast, there have been valuable lessons learned regarding communication and the ability to effectively 
disseminate  critical  information  to  key  management  personnel.  Traditional  “land  line”  voice 
communication  is  often  not  available  or  is  overutilized  and  not  reliable  during  a  disaster,  therefore  a 
need exists for a secondary and possibly a tertiary method of communication.  

One of the more reliable methods is the use of mobile smartphones. These devices allow the user many 
different  communication  options  with  one  device  such  as  voice,  e-mail,  and  text  messaging.  Using 
smartphones can maintain communications in several different ways:  

1.  You can  send and receive e-mails using the corporate messaging system.  
2.  You can  send  standard  text  messages  using  the  cellular  service  provider,  possibly  with  an 

additional charge by the cellular service provider per text message sent and received. 

3.  You can place voice calls.  

Encryption:    Most  smartphones  have  the  ability  to  encrypt  the  device’s  file  system  to  prevent  users 
from gaining access to locally stored data in the event of theft or loss. You have the ability to manage 
the device’s email access individually as well. You can load software updates to the devices, manage 
settings, and even completely wipe the file system clean in the event of theft or loss.  

Interim Plan 

Page 9 of 13

eed for IT Professional:  To implement high security, you will need an IT professional with the ability 

to oversee and manage mobile devices.  

hen an IT Professional is not available:  If  you do not have the resources to manage an enterprise-
wide solution, each individual can manage their own device. Most mobile devices come with software 
that can be used in conjunction with a PC to change the device’s settings or even send emails. 

ext  message  alternative:    In  the  event  that  corporate  e-mail  systems  are  unavailable,  you  can  still 
maintain  communication  between  users  using  text  messaging  provided  by  your  cellular  service 
provider. Keep in mind that the cellular service provider sometimes charges per text message sent and 
received.   

vailability:  The ability to use voice calls, emails and text messages using your cellular provider could 
possibly  be  limited  in  the  event  of  disaster.  When  a  large  percentage  of  users  try  to  connect  to  their 
cellular  service  at  the  same  time,  the  cellular  service  can  be  overwhelmed  and  a  large  number  of 
subscribers will be unable to communicate using voice, data or text messaging.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING 
BETWEEN 

  

COUNTY AND THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS 

FOR 
SUPPORT OF CONTINUITY OF COURT OPERATIONS 
IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY 

This memorandum of understanding (MOU) is between   
Court of Texas. 

County and the Supreme 

I. 

PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF MOU 

 
The purpose of this MOU is to define the assistance and cooperation that   
County will provide to a county that is designated by the Supreme Court, the presiding judge of 
  Administrative  Judicial  Region,  the  Chief  Justice  of  any  Appellate  Court  or  a 
the    
County’s 
Local   Administrative   Judge   (“designated   county”)   as   requiring     
assistance in order to continue the operation of the courts of the designated county. 

 

The Supreme Court’s intent in executing this MOU is to provide a framework for the continuity 
of court operations in any Texas county that has experienced a disaster or unforeseen event that 
precludes a court from conducting business.  This MOU is not limited to assistance to first tier or 
second tier coastal counties as defined by Sec. 2210.003, Texas Insurance Code.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
