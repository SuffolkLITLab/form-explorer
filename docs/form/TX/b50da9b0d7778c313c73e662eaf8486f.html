1.3  DEFINITIONS 

Attachment – any unique supporting document including exhibits and proposed orders that 
are not defined in Rule 21 (a) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. 
Digital Media – any files stored in an electronic format. This can include (but is not limited 
to) text, audio and video files. 

Judicial Committee on Information Technology

Technology Standards v7.0 

Document – a pleading, plea, motion, application, request, exhibit, brief, memorandum of law, 
order, or other instrument in electronic form. 
Document Access System – the statewide electronic court record system provided by the 
Office of Court Administration (currently Re:SearchTX). 
DPI – Dots per inch 
Lead Document – a document as defined by Rule 21 (a) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. 
If filing a single document, it is the lead document. 
NARA  - National Archives and Records Administration 
NIEM – National Information Exchange Model – a partnership of the U.S. Department of 
Justice, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services designed to develop, disseminate and support enterprise-wide information 
exchange standards and processes that can enable jurisdictions to effectively share critical 
information in emergency situations, as well as support the day-to-day operations of agencies 
throughout the nation. NIEM was adopted formally by JCIT and is promulgated in data 
exchanges in Texas Administrative Code, Title 1, Part 8, Chapter 177. 
Electronic Court Filing (ECF) standards – a set of non-proprietary extensible markup 
language (XML) and Web services specifications, along with clarifying explanations and 
amendments to those specifications that have been added for the purpose of promoting 
interoperability among electronic court filing vendors and systems. 
OCA – Office of Court Administration 
OCR – Optical Character Recognition 
PDF – Portable Document Format – for the purpose of these standards this is PDF 1.4 (ISO 
19005-1:2005 – Revised as ISP/NP 19005-1). This standard specifies how to use PDF for 
long-term preservation of electronic documents and is applicable to documents containing 
combinations of character, raster and vector data. 
PDF Distiller – a program or application that converts files into PDF files so that the printed 
appearance of a document is preserved regardless of the application used to create it. This 
functionality is commonly seen as “Print to PDF”, “Save to PDF” or “Export to PDF”. 
PDF Software – software that conforms to International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO) 32000-1:2008. This standard specifies standards for creating (writing), reading, 
displaying and interacting with PDF documents.

2  SYSTEM DATA EXCHANGE STANDARDS 

Judicial Committee on Information Technology 
 

 

Page 3 of 32 

Technology Standards v7.0 

In accordance with Texas Administrative Code, Title 1, Part 8, Chapter 177, information exchanges 
that occur between the various systems (electronic filing manager, case management, document 
management, etc.) should occur using the current OASIS LegalXML specifications. The OASIS 
LegalXML specification is a subset to NIEM.  

3  DIGITAL MEDIA STANDARDS 
In addition to content and formatting promulgated by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Texas 
Code of Criminal Procedure, and Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, the following standards apply 
to digital media filed electronically or scanned from source records (filed after the effective date of 
these standards) by the clerk.  

3.1  DOCUMENTS 

A.  An e-filed document must be in text-searchable PDF, using fonts specified in the PDF 

specification, on 8.5x11 page size, with the content appropriately rotated.   
 

B.  When possible, the document should be generated directly from the originating software 

using a PDF distiller. 
 

C.  Prior to being filed electronically, a scanned document must have a resolution of 300 DPI. 

Preferably, scanned documents should be made searchable using OCR technology.  
 

D.  An e-filed document may not contain any security or feature restrictions including 

password protection or encryption and may not contain embedded multi-media video, 
audio, or programming.   
 

E.  Documents may not contain package PDF’s.  PDF’s should not be embedded inside of 

another PDF. Documents may not contain embedded fonts. Each document must be a single 
PDF.  An appellate court may require that multiple PDF documents be combined into a 
single PDF document and bookmarks used to separate content appropriately. The content 
of the document should not depend on bookmarks.   
 

F.  Any e-filed document filename should contain only alphanumeric characters that are part of 
the Latin1_General character set. No special characters are allowed and the length of the 
filename should be restricted to 50 characters. 
 

G.  Once accepted, an eFiled document remains available to the filer for download for 30 days. 

 

3.2  AUDIO/VIDEO 

A.  The following media players are supported (specific audio/video formats can be found on 

each media player’s website): 

a. VLC media player (VideoLAN Organization) 
b. Windows media player (Microsoft) 

 

Judicial Committee on Information Technology 
 

 

Page 4 of 32 

Technology Standards v7.0 

B.  When an audio/video file is natively supported by at least one media player listed in these 

standards, the file must not be converted into another format. 
 

C.  If an audio/video file is not natively supported by at least one media player listed in these 
standards, the file must be converted to another format supported by at least one media 
player listed. The original, any hardware requirements, and software needed to view/hear 
the original must be submitted as well.  
 

D.  If modifications are needed to enhance the native audio/video, a copy of the original must 
be made. The modified copy (submitted in addition to the original audio/video) must also 
be generated in a format supported by at least one media player listed in these standards.

4  EFILING FILING CONFIGURATIONS 
Below are the standard filing configurations to be used in the eFiling system for district, county 
court at law, probate, constitutional county, and justice of the peace courts. This list of filing 
configurations must be accepted in each court. Courts and clerks may not add to this configuration 
but may eliminate codes if not needed in a particular jurisdiction.  

It is important to note that these standards only apply to the electronic filing system which is a 
delivery system and are NOT standards for a county case management or document management 
system.

5  DOCUMENT ACCESS CONFIGURATIONS 
Below are the configurations to be used in the document access system provided by OCA for 
district, county court at law, probate, and constitutional county courts.  

It is important to note that these standards only apply to the electronic document access system 
which is a delivery system and are NOT standards for a county case management or document 
management system. 

5.1  ROLE DEFINITIONS 
The following roles are defined for the electronic document access system: 

Role 1 — Judge. “Judge” means any sitting judge on the Supreme Court, the Court of 
Criminal Appeals, the intermediate Courts of Appeals, the District Courts, the County Courts, 
and the County Courts at Law, together with associate judges and designated court staff. 
Justice court judges and municipal court judges are not included at this time. 

Role 2 — Firm on the Case, Visiting Judge. “Firm on the Case” means an attorney licensed 
in Texas who has made an appearance in the case or any staff associated with that firm. This 
term includes other attorneys, staff, paralegals, or other persons authorized by the firm 
administrator. “Visiting Judge” means a qualified judge assigned to a specific case or docket 
for a temporary period.  

Role 3 — Clerk. “Clerk” means the custodian of the official record, including district and 
county clerks and deputy clerks and staff necessary for the performance of the clerk’s 
duties.   

Role 4 – Licensed Attorney.  A Licensed Attorney is an attorney licensed by the State of 
Texas that does not fall into Role 1 (Judge), Role 2 (Attorney on the Case, Visiting Judge), or 
Role 3 (Clerk). 

Role 5 – Registered User. A Registered User is a user that does not fall into Role 1 (Judge), 
Role 2 (Attorney on the Case, Visiting Judge), Role 3 (Clerk), Role 4 (Licensed Attorney) and 
registers with the Document Access System. 

5.2  ROLE PERMISSIONS 
The roles defined in Section 5.1 above are given the following permission: 

Role 1 – Judges - A Judge may access all case index information and all electronically filed 
documents in any case in any court. 

Role 2 – Attorney on the Case, Visiting Judge.  An Attorney on the Case may access case 
index information and all electronically filed documents for any case in which he or she is 
attorney of record or has made an appearance in the case. A Visiting Judge may access case 
index information and all electronically filed documents in a case to which he or she is 
assigned. 

Judicial Committee on Information Technology 
 

 

Page 26 of 32 

Role 3 – Clerk. For purposes of the Document Access System, a Clerk has the same 
permission level as a Judge for cases filed in the district or county. A Clerk may access case 
index information and all electronically filed documents for any case in the district or 
county. Additionally, Clerks will have access to reports and other system features that will 
allow them to configure systems and to provide them with additional information 
concerning their offices. 

Role 4 – Licensed Attorney. Licensed Attorneys can access case index information and all 
publicly available electronically filed documents relating to any case in which they may 
have an interest.  This would exclude cases and documents that are restricted by Court 
Order, Rule or Statute including documents containing un-redacted sensitive data 
(“Restricted Documents”).  

Role 5 – Registered Users. Registered Users can access case index information and 
publicly available electronically filed documents in accordance with the Section 5.3.  
Additionally, Registered User access does not include cases and documents that are 
restricted by Court Order, Rule and Statute including unredacted documents marked as 
containing Sensitive Data (collectively referred to as “Restricted Documents”).

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
