amended  or  supplemental  pleading  that  seeks  any  relief  other  than  the 
monetary relief allowed by (a)(1).  

(2)    A pleading, amended pleading, or supplemental pleading that removes a suit from 
the expedited actions process may not be filed without leave of court unless it is 
filed before the earlier of 30 days after the discovery period is closed or 30 days 
before the date set for trial. Leave to amend may be granted only if good cause for 
filing the pleading outweighs any prejudice to an opposing party.  

(3)

discovery under Rule 190.2(c).

challenges for cause to a juror under Rule 228 are not included in the time 
limit.

resolution, the court may refer the case to an alternative dispute resolution 
procedure once, and the procedure must:

not exceed a half-day in duration, excluding scheduling time;  

(ii)   

not exceed a total cost of twice the amount of applicable civil filing 
fees; and  

(iii)  

be completed no later than 60 days before the initial trial setting.

Page 5 

(B)    The  court  must  consider  objections  to  the  referral  unless  prohibited  by

judgment evidence under Rule 166a or during the trial on the merits. This paragraph 
does not apply to a motion to strike for late designation.   

Comment to 2021 change:  

Rule 169 is amended to implement section 22.004(h-1) of the Texas Government Code—
which calls for rules to promote the prompt, efficient, and cost-effective resolution of civil actions 
filed in county courts at law in which the amount in controversy does not exceed $250,000—and 
changes to section 22.004(h) of the Texas Government Code.  To ensure uniformity, and pursuant 
to section 22.004(b) of the Texas Government Code, Rule 169’s application is not limited to suits 
filed in county courts at law; any suit that falls within the definition of subsection (a) is subject to 
the  provisions  of  the  rule.    However,  certain  suits  are  exempt  from  Rule  169’s  application  by 
statute.  See,  e.g.,  TEX.  ESTATES  CODE  §§  53.107,  1053.105.    The  discovery  limitations  for 
expedited actions are set out in Rule 190.2, which is also amended to implement section 22.004(h-
1) of the Texas Government Code. 

RULE 190.  DISCOVERY LIMITATIONS 

190.1  Discovery Control Plan Required. 

Every case must be governed by a discovery control plan as provided in this Rule. A plaintiff must 
allege in the first numbered paragraph of the original petition whether discovery is intended to be 
conducted under Level 1, 2, or 3 of this Rule.

or Less (Level 1)  

(a)   Application. This subdivision applies to:  

(1) 

any suit that is governed by the expedited actions process in Rule 169; and 

(2)   

unless the parties agree that rule 190.3 should apply or the court orders a discovery 
control plan under Rule 190.4, any suit for divorce not involving children in which 
a party pleads that the value of the marital estate is more than zero but not more 
than $50,000250,000.  

(b)    Limitations. Discovery is subject to the limitations provided elsewhere in these rules and 

to the following additional limitations:

Page 6 

(1)    Discovery period. All discovery must be conducted during the discovery period, 
which begins when the suit is filedthe first initial disclosures are due and continues 
untilfor 180 days after the date the first request for discovery of any kind is served 
on a party.  

(2)    Total time for oral depositions. Each party may have no more than six20 hours in 
total to examine and cross-examine all witnesses in oral depositions. The parties 
may agree to expand this limit up to ten hours in total, but not more except by court 
order. The court may modify the deposition hours so that no party is given unfair 
advantage.  

(3)   

Interrogatories. Any party may serve on any other party no more than 15 written 
interrogatories,  excluding  interrogatories  asking  a  party  only  to  identify  or 
authenticate  specific  documents.  Each  discrete  subpart  of  an  interrogatory  is 
considered a separate interrogatory.  

(4) 

Requests for Production. Any party may serve on any other party no more than 
15 written requests for production. Each discrete subpart of a request for production 
is considered a separate request for production.  

(5)    Requests for Admissions. Any party may serve on any other party no more than 
15 written requests for admissions. Each discrete subpart of a request for admission 
is considered a separate request for admission. 

(6) 

Requests for Disclosure. In addition to the content subject to disclosure under Rule 
194.2, a party may request disclosure of all documents, electronic information, and 
tangible items that the disclosing party has in its possession, custody or control and 
may use to support its claims or defenses. A request for disclosure made pursuant 
to this paragraph is not considered a request for production.   

(c)    Reopening Discovery. If a suit is removed from the expedited actions process in Rule 169 
or, in a divorce, the filing of a pleading renders this subdivision no longer applicable, the 
discovery period reopens, and discovery must be completed within the limitations provided 
in Rules 190.3 or 190.4, whichever is applicable. Any person previously deposed may be 
redeposed. On motion of any party, the court should continue the trial date if necessary to 
permit completion of discovery.  

190.3   Discovery Control Plan - By Rule (Level 2)  

(a)    Application. Unless a suit is governed by a discovery control plan under Rules 190.2 or 

190.4, discovery must be conducted in accordance with this subdivision.  

(b)    Limitations. Discovery is subject to the limitations provided elsewhere in these rules and 

to the following additional limitations:  

Misc. Docket No. 20-9153 
 

Page 7

(B)   

in other cases, the earlier of  

(i)   

30 days before the date set for trial, or  

(ii)   

nine months after the earlier of the date of the first oral deposition

initial disclosures are due.  

(2)    Total time for oral depositions. Each side may have no more than 50 hours in oral 
depositions  to  examine  and  cross-examine  parties  on  the  opposing  side,  experts 
designated by those parties, and persons who are subject to those parties’ control. 
“Side” refers to all the litigants with generally common interests in the litigation. If 
one  side  designates  more  than  two  experts,  the  opposing  side  may  have  an 
additional six hours of total deposition time for each additional expert designated. 
The court may modify the deposition hours and must do so when a side or party 
would be given unfair advantage.  

(3)   

Interrogatories. Any party may serve on any other party no more than 25 written 
interrogatories,  excluding  interrogatories  asking  a  party  only  to  identify  or 
authenticate  specific  documents.  Each  discrete  subpart  of  an  interrogatory  is 
considered a separate interrogatory.  

* * * 

Comment to 2021 change: Rule 190.2 is amended to implement section 22.004(h-1) of the Texas 
Government  Code.  Under  amended  Rule  190.2,  Level  1  discovery  limitations  now  apply  to  a 
broader  subset  of  civil  actions:  expedited  actions  under  Rule  169,  which  is  also  amended  to 
implement  section  22.004(h-1)  of  the  Texas  Government  Code,  and  divorces  not  involving 
children in which the value of the marital estate is not more than $250,000. Level 1 limitations are 
revised  to  impose  a  twenty-hour  limit  on  oral  deposition.  Disclosure  requests  under  Rule 
190.2(b)(6) and Rule 194 are now replaced by required disclosures under Rule 194, as amended. 
The  discovery  periods  under  Rules  190.2(b)(1)  and  190.3(b)(1)  are  revised  to  reference  the 
required disclosures.

on  all  information  reasonably  available  to  the  responding  party  or  its  attorney  at  the  time  the 
response  is  made.  The  responding  party’s  answers,  objections,  and  other  responses  must  be 
preceded by the request or required disclosure to which they apply.  

* * * 

193.3   Asserting a Privilege  

A party may preserve a privilege from written discovery in accordance with this subdivision.  

(a)    Withholding privileged material or information. A party who claims that material or 
information  responsive  to  written  discovery  is  privileged  may  withhold  the  privileged 
material or information from the response. The party must state—in the response (or an 
amended or supplemental response) or in a separate document—that:  

(1)   

information or material responsive to the request or required disclosure has been 
withheld,  

(2)   

the request or required disclosure to which the information or material relates, and  

(3)   

the privilege or privileges asserted.  

(b)    Description of withheld material or information. After receiving a response indicating 
that  material  or  information  has  been  withheld  from  production,  thea  party  seeking 
discovery may serve a written request that the withholding party identify the information 
and  material  withheld.  Within  15  days  of  service  of  that  request,  the  withholding  party 
must serve a response that:  

(1)   

describes  the  information  or  materials  withheld  that,  without  revealing  the 
privileged  information  itself  or  otherwise  waiving  the  privilege,  enables  other 
parties to assess the applicability of the privilege, and  

(2)   

asserts a specific privilege for each item or group of items withheld.  

(c)    Exemption.  Without  complying  with  paragraphs  (a)  and  (b),  a  party  may  withhold  a 
privileged communication to or from a lawyer or lawyer’s representative or a privileged 
document of a lawyer or lawyer’s representative  

Misc. Docket No. 20-9153 
 

Page 10 

(1)   

created or made from the point at which a party consults a lawyer with a view to 
obtaining professional legal services from the lawyer in the prosecution or defense 
of a specific claim in the litigation in which discovery is requested or required, and  

(2)   

concerning the litigation in which the discovery is requested or required.  

(d)  

Privilege  not  waived  by  production.  A  party  who  produces  material  or  information 
without intending to waive a claim of privilege does not waive that claim under these rules 
or the Rules of Evidence if—within ten days or a shorter time ordered by the court, after 
the  producing  party  actually  discovers  that  such  production  was  made—the  producing 
party amends the response, identifying the material or information produced and stating 
the privilege asserted. If the producing party thus amends the response to assert a privilege, 
the  requestingany  party  who  has  obtained  the  specific  material  or  information  must 
promptly return the specified material or information and any copies pending any ruling 
by the court denying the privilege.  

193.4   Hearing and Ruling on Objections and Assertions of Privilege.  

(a)    Hearing. Any party may at any reasonable time request a hearing on an objection or claim 
of  privilege  asserted  under  this  rule.  The  party  making  the  objection  or  asserting  the 
privilege must present any evidence necessary to support the objection or privilege. The 
evidence may be testimony presented at the hearing or affidavits served at least seven days 
before  the  hearing  or  at  such  other  reasonable  time  as  the  court  permits.  If  the  court 
determines that an in camera review of some or all of the requested discovery or required 
disclosure is necessary, that material or information must be segregated and produced to 
the court in a sealed wrapper within a reasonable time following the hearing.  

(b)    Ruling. To the extent the court sustains the objection or claim of privilege, the responding 
party has no further duty to respond to that request or required disclosure. To the extent the 
court overrules the objection or claim of privilege, the responding party must produce the 
requested or required material or information within 30 days after the court’s ruling or at 
such time as the court orders. A party need not request a ruling on that party's own objection 
or assertion of privilege to preserve the objection or privilege.  

(c)    Use  of  material  or  information  withheld  under  claim  of  privilege.  A  party  may  not 
use—at  any  hearing  or  trial—material  or  information  withheld  from  discovery  under  a 
claim of privilege, including a claim sustained by the court, without timely amending or 
supplementing the party's response to that discovery.  

* * * 

193.6  Failing to Timely Respond - Effect on Trial  

(a)    Exclusion of evidence and exceptions. A party who fails to make, amend, or supplement 
a discovery response, including a required disclosure, in a timely manner may not introduce 
in evidence the material or information that was not timely disclosed, or offer the testimony 

Misc. Docket No. 20-9153 
 

Page 11 

of a witness (other  than a named party) who was  not  timely  identified, unless  the court 
finds that:  

(1)   

there  was  good  cause  for  the  failure  to  timely  make,  amend,  or  supplement  the 
discovery response; or  

(2)   

the failure to timely make, amend, or supplement the discovery response will not 
unfairly surprise or unfairly prejudice the other parties.  

(b)    Burden of establishing exception. The burden of establishing good cause or the lack of 
unfair surprise or unfair prejudice is on the party seeking to introduce the evidence or call 
the witness. A finding of good cause or of the lack of unfair surprise or unfair prejudice 
must be supported by the record.  

(c)    Continuance. Even if the party seeking to introduce the evidence or call the witness fails 
to carry the burden under paragraph (b), the court may grant a continuance or temporarily 
postpone the trial to allow a response to be made, amended, or supplemented, and to allow 
opposing parties to conduct discovery regarding  any new  information  presented  by that 
response.
