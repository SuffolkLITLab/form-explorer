Rules and Forms for a Judicial Bypass of Parental Notice and Consent 
Under Chapter 33 of the Family Code (Redline Version) 

Explanatory Statement 

Chapter 33  of the Texas Family  Code provides for judicial authorization of an 
unemancipated  minor  to  consent  to  an  abortion  in  Texas  without  notice  to,  or  the 
consent of, a parent, managing conservator, or guardian. Sections 33.003 and 33.004, 
which  govern  proceedings  in  the  trial  and  appellate  courts,  authorize  the  Court  to 
make rules to ensure that judicial bypass applications are decided confidentially and 
promptly.  See  TEX.  FAM.  CODE  §§ 33.003(l),  33.004(c).  The  statute  also  directs  the 
Court  to  make  forms  for  use  in  judicial  bypass  proceedings.  Id.  §§  33.003(m), 
33.004(d). 

The  Court  approved  the  first  set  of  rules  and  forms  in  1999,  following  the 
enactment of Chapter 33. See Misc. Docket No. 99-9247 (Dec. 22, 1999); Act of May 
25,  1999,  76th  Leg.,  R.S.,  ch.  395,  1999 Tex.  Gen.  Laws 2466  (S.B.  30)  (codified  at 
TEX. FAM. CODE § 33.001 et seq.). In 2015, the Court amended Tthe rules and forms 
have been amended to reflect the 2015 amendments to Chapter 33. See Misc. Docket 
No. 15-9246 (Dec. 29, 2015); Act of June 1, 2015, 84th Leg., R.S., ch. 436 (H.B. 3994). 
The 2022 amendments to the rules and forms track the statutory requirementsreflect 
the enactment of Chapter 170A of the Texas Health and Safety Code. See Act of May 
29, 2021, 87th Leg., R.S., ch. 800 (H.B. 1280) (codified at TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE
§ 170A.001 et seq.).

They rules and forms do not reflect any judgment by the Court that Chapter 33, 
or any part of it, is constitutional. Constitutional questions should be resolved in an 
adversarial proceeding with full briefing and argument. Nor do the rules imply that 
abortion is—or is not—permitted in any specific situation. See, e.g., Roe v. Wade, 410 
U.S.  113  (1973);  TEX.  HEALTH  &  SAFETY  CODE  § 170A.002  (restrictions  on  third 
trimester abortions of viable fetuses). 

The  notes  and  comments  appended  to  the  rules  are  intended  to  inform  their 

construction and application by courts and practitioners. 

Rule 1.  General Provisions 

1.1  Applicability of These Rules. These rules govern proceedings for obtaining 
a court order authorizing a minor to consent to an abortion without notice to, 
or the consent of, a parent, managing conservator, or guardian under Chapter 
33,  Family  Code.  All  references  in  these  rules  to  “minor”  refer  to  the  minor 
applicant.  Other  Texas  court  rules—including  the  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure, 
Rules  of  Evidence,  Rules  of  Appellate  Procedure,  Rules  of  Judicial 
Administration, and local rules approved by the Supreme Court—also apply, 
but  when  the  application  of  another  rule  would  be  inconsistent  with  the

rules control. 

Proceedings under these rules are not intended to create—and an order issued 
under  these  rules  should  not  be  construed  as—a judicial  determination  that 
the minor has a life-threatening physical condition aggravated by, caused by, 
or arising from a pregnancy that places the minor at risk of death or poses a 
serious risk  of  substantial impairment  of  a  major bodily  function  unless the 
abortion is performed or induced. See TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 170A.002.

Instructions for Applying to the Court for a Waiver 
of Parental Notification and Consent (Form 1A)  

Your situation and the law 

An  abortion  in  Texas  is  available  only  if  a  doctor,  in  the  exercise  of 
reasonable medical judgment, determines that you have a life-threatening 
physical  condition  aggravated  by,  caused  by,  or  arising  from  your 
pregnancy  that  places  you  at  risk  of  death  or  poses  a  serious  risk  of 
substantial  impairment  of  one  of  your  major  bodily  functions  unless  the 
abortion is performed or induced. 

If  you  are  younger  than  18  and  have  not  been  legally  “emancipated,”  you  are 
“unemancipated,” which means that you are legally under the custody or control of 
your  parents  (or  one  of  your  parents),  a  managing  conservator,  or  a  guardian.  (A 
“managing conservator” is an adult or agency appointed by a court to have custody or 
control of you.) 

If you are pregnant, unemancipated, and younger than 18, you cannot get an abortion 
in Texas unless: 

• your doctor informs one of your parents or your managing conservator or guardian
at  least  48  hours  before  the  abortion  and  obtains  the  consent  of  your  parent,
managing conservator, or guardian; or

• a judge issues an order that “waives” or removes the requirement that you must
let a parent or your managing conservator or guardian know about your planned
abortion and obtain his or her consent to it.

Rules and Forms for a Judicial Bypass of Parental Notice and Consent 
Under Chapter 33 of the Family Code (Clean Version) 

Explanatory Statement 

Chapter 33  of the Texas Family  Code provides for judicial authorization of an 
unemancipated  minor  to  consent  to  an  abortion  in  Texas  without  notice  to,  or  the 
consent of, a parent, managing conservator, or guardian. Sections 33.003 and 33.004, 
which  govern  proceedings  in  the  trial  and  appellate  courts,  authorize  the  Court  to 
make rules to ensure that judicial bypass applications are decided confidentially and 
promptly.  See  TEX.  FAM.  CODE  §§ 33.003(l),  33.004(c).  The  statute  also  directs  the 
Court  to  make  forms  for  use  in  judicial  bypass  proceedings.  Id.  §§  33.003(m), 
33.004(d). 

The  Court  approved  the  first  set  of  rules  and  forms  in  1999,  following  the 
enactment of Chapter 33. See Misc. Docket No. 99-9247 (Dec. 22, 1999); Act of May

TEX. FAM. CODE § 33.001 et seq.). In 2015, the Court amended the rules and forms to 
reflect the 2015 amendments to Chapter 33. See Misc. Docket No. 15-9246 (Dec. 29, 
2015); Act of June 1, 2015, 84th Leg., R.S., ch. 436 (H.B. 3994). The 2022 amendments 
to the rules and forms reflect the enactment of Chapter 170A of the Texas Health and

Instructions for Applying to the Court for a Waiver of Parental 
Notification and Consent (Form 1A) 

Your situation and the law 

An  abortion  in  Texas  is  available  only  if  a  doctor,  in  the  exercise  of 
reasonable medical judgment, determines that you have a life-threatening 
physical  condition  aggravated  by,  caused  by,  or  arising  from  your 
pregnancy  that  places  you  at  risk  of  death  or  poses  a  serious  risk  of 
substantial  impairment  of  one  of  your  major  bodily  functions  unless  the 
abortion is performed or induced. 

If  you  are  younger  than  18  and  have  not  been  legally  “emancipated,”  you  are 
“unemancipated,” which means that you are legally under the custody or control of 
your  parents  (or  one  of  your  parents),  a  managing  conservator,  or  a  guardian.  (A 
“managing conservator” is an adult or agency appointed by a court to have custody or 
control of you.) 

If you are pregnant, unemancipated, and younger than 18, you cannot get an abortion 
in Texas unless: 

• your doctor informs one of your parents or your managing conservator or guardian
at  least  48  hours  before  the  abortion  and  obtains  the  consent  of  your  parent,
managing conservator, or guardian; or

• a judge issues an order that “waives” or removes the requirement that you must
let a parent or your managing conservator or guardian know about your planned
abortion and obtain his or her consent to it.
