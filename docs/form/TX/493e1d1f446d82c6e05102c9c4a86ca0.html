collaboration, 
education, and 
leadership, thereby 

improving the 
lives of individuals 

with mental health 
needs, substance use 
disorders, or intellectual and

TEXAS JUDICIAL COMMISSION ON MENTAL HEALTHFrom the Chairs

The Judicial Commission on Mental Health develops policy initiatives and best practices designed 
to improve outcomes for individuals with mental illness or intellectual or developmental disabilities 
when they encounter the court system.  The Commission’s work facilitates implementation of these 
practices through collaboration across disciplines and education. As our country grappled with the 
COVID-19  pandemic,  the  last  two  years  have  presented  unique  challenges  for  those  with  mental 
health needs. This Commission and our state judiciary as a whole have demonstrated resilience and 
commitment in their continued efforts to serve these needs. 

As  the  pandemic  progressed,  the  Commission  adapted,  providing  technology  grants  to  courts  and 
counties aimed at facilitating virtual engagement. We presented the Judicial Summit on Mental Health 
virtually, which resulted in record attendance of over 1,500 participants. We offered the 2021 Summit 
virtually and in person to return to in-person engagement while continuing to broaden our reach. We 
debuted  new,  expanded  editions  of  JCMH’s  popular  bench  books  for  judges  and  lawyers,  and  we 
made them available both digitally and in print. Additionally, the JCMH recently launched a statewide 
sequential intercept mapping project, community diversion coordinator pilot programs, and the new 
JCMH website. 

We are very grateful for the tireless work of our Commissioners, Collaborative Council members, and 
staff, who make all of it possible. We also appreciate the generosity of the Legislature in supporting 
the many endeavors we are committed to complete. Together, we will continue to inform and improve 
our judicial system’s interaction with individuals with mental illness and IDD. 

Hon. Jane N. Bland, Chair
Justice
Supreme Court of Texas

Hon. Barbara Hervey, Chair
Judge
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals

From the Executive Director
Dear Colleagues and Friends,

I  am  pleased  to  present  this  Report  to  the  Supreme  Court  of  Texas  and  the  Texas  Court  of 
Criminal Appeals for fiscal years 2020 and 2021. We are grateful for the steadfast leadership of 
Justice Jane Bland and Judge Barbara Hervey as we have built the first joint commission of our 
state’s two highest courts.

The past two years have been marked with challenges that at times seemed insurmountable but 
inevitably revealed quiet heroes. Many of us bore the devastation with a philosophy similar to 
Fred Rogers’s famous advice: “When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news,” 
Rogers said to his television neighbors, “my mother would say to me, ‘Look for the helpers. You 
will always find people who are helping.’”

The Texas  Judicial  Commission  on  Mental  Health,  the  Collaborative  Council,  and  the  many 
committee  members  are  helpers.  The  JCMH  is  made  up  of  judges,  attorneys,  doctors,  law 
enforcement, social workers, and educators—the leaders who show up again and again to serve 
their communities. Thank you for your unwavering dedication and grit.

Despite the challenges, the JCMH was able to move forward with many impactful initiatives. 
Key successes include quickly adapting to a virtual world and continuing to lead and inspire 
judges and attorneys with the annual Judicial Summit on Mental Health and new editions of the 
bench books. During this time, JCMH was also able to develop ten legislative proposals that 
were passed into law.

At JCMH, we will keep looking for the helpers so we can connect and support them. It is our 
great privilege to create and share new tools, resources, and ideas. And it is my honor to lead the 
outstanding JCMH team that brings their experience, commitment, and passion to work every 
day to improve our courts for individuals with mental health challenges or IDD. 

Thank you for all you do.

Kristi Taylor
Executive Director

TEXAS JUDICIAL COMMISSION ON MENTAL HEALTHREPORT TO THE COURTS | 2020–2021INTRODUCING THE DEPUTY LIAISONS

Justice Rebeca Aizpuru Huddle and Judge Jesse F. McClure, III were appointed as Deputy Liaisons to the JCMH from their respective courts in 2021. 

Justice  Rebeca Aizpuru  Huddle  was  appointed  to  the  Supreme  Court  of  Texas  by  Governor  Greg 
Abbott in October 2020. Justice Huddle grew up in El Paso, before earning her undergraduate degree 
from Stanford University and her law degree from the University of Texas School of Law. Prior to her 
time  on  the  Supreme  Court,  Justice  Huddle  practiced  law  at  Baker  Botts  L.L.P.,  where  she  handled 
litigation matters ranging from individual personal injury cases to complex commercial and shareholder 
disputes and appeals. In 2011, Governor Rick Perry appointed Justice Huddle to serve on the Court of 
Appeals  for  the  First  District  of Texas.  She  then  returned  to  Baker  Botts  as  a  partner  in  2017  before 
being appointed to the Supreme Court of Texas. She is a Fellow of the Texas Bar Foundation and the 
Houston Bar Foundation. She enjoys mentoring younger lawyers, always encouraging them to strive for 
excellence and become active leaders within their communities.

COLLABORATION

Prior to the inception of the JCMH, the Supreme Court of Texas directed the Texas Judicial 
Council  to  establish  a  Mental  Health  Committee,  which  was  charged  with  examining  best 
practices in the administration of civil and criminal justice for persons with mental illness. 
One of the concerns the Mental Health Committee identified was a lack of communication, 
coordination,  and  collaboration  between  and  among  the  courts,  the  state  and  local  mental 
health providers, attorneys, and mental health advocates.

The  JCMH  was  created  as  a  result  of  the  findings  of  the  Mental  Health  Committee,  and 
collaboration  has  been  one  of  the  three  key  tenets  of  the  commission  since  the  beginning. 
Since 2018, the JCMH has worked to bring diverse voices to the table to share resources and 
best  practices. The  JCMH  offers  technical  assistance  to  aid  collaboration  among  members 
and stakeholders in communities throughout Texas. This includes trainings and workshops, 
as well as facilitating meetings between stakeholders to provide expert consultation and peer 
networking. 

Judge Jesse F. McClure, III was appointed to the Court of Criminal Appeals in 2020. He previously 
served as Judge of the 339th Judicial District Court in Harris County and as a prosecutor for the Texas 
Department  of  Insurance  (TDI),  assigned  to  the  Harris  County  District Attorney’s  Office  as  a  special 
assistant district attorney. Prior to his service at TDI, he was an attorney for the Department of Homeland 
Security and an assistant district attorney for the Tarrant County District Attorney’s Office. He is a member 
of the State Bar of Texas and the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners. He is also a former member 
of the UTHealth Nurse Anesthesia Division Advisory Board. Judge McClure received a Bachelor of Arts 
in  Philosophy  from  the  University  of  North  Carolina  at  Chapel  Hill  and  his  Juris  Doctorate  from  the 
University of Texas School of Law.

Bench Book
The  Texas  Mental  Health  and  Intellectual  and  Development  Disabilities  Law  Bench  Book  is  a  procedural 
guide for Texas judges hearing cases regarding persons with mental illness and intellectual and developmental 
disabilities (IDD), developed by the JCMH with the help of numerous contributing authors and editors including 
the Bench Book Committee. 

The Bench Book Committee is chaired by Judge Camile G. DuBose and meets as needed to advise on content, 
editing, and feedback on the most up to date version of the book. In 2021, the Committee worked diligently on 
a 3rd edition, ultimately adding more than 70 pages of new information. The new content includes Intercepts 4 
and  5,  plus  additional  sections  on  Risk  Assessments,  Insanity,  and  Expunctions/Non-Disclosures.  The 
newest edition was published before the end of 2021. It is available both online and in print. 

Juvenile Bench Book
The  Texas  Juvenile  Mental  Health  and  Intellectual  and  Developmental  Disabilities  Law  Bench  Book 
(commonly called the Juvenile Bench Book) is a procedural guide for Texas juvenile judges who hear cases 
regarding children with mental illness or IDD, developed by the JCMH and numerous contributing authors 
and editors including the Juvenile Bench Book Committee. 

The Juvenile Bench Book Committee is chaired by Judge Cynthia Wheless and meets as needed to advise 
on  content,  editing,  and  feedback  on  the  most  up  to  date  version  of  the  Juvenile  Bench  Book.  In  2021, 
the Committee reconvened to advise on the 2nd edition of the book. It is available both online and in print.

Summit Planning
The Summit Curriculum Committee, chaired by Judge Brent Carr, advises on speakers and 
curriculum for the annual Summit. The Committee originally started its work in early 2018 
and is composed of representatives from stakeholder agenices including several judicial 
education agencies: the Texas Association of Counties, and the Texas Municipal Courts 
Education Center, as well as representatives from the Texas Indigent Defense Commission, 
and the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association. The Committee works to ensure that 
the presentation topics promote the JCMH mission and lead the way in this ever-changing 
legal field.

Forms
The  Forms  Committee  was  established 
in  December  2019  and  was  tasked  with 
examining common mental health forms with 
the  goal  of  producing  a  set  of  standardized 
forms  that  could  be  used  in  any  county  in 
the  state.  The  Forms  Committee  is  chaired 
by  Judge  Dave  Jahn.  The  Committee 
in  2020  and  continued 
met 
working  into  2021  on  forms  related  to 
Emergency  Detention,  Order  of  Protective 
Custody,  Court-Ordered  Mental  Health 
and  IDD  services,  Jail  and  Magistration, 
Incompetency, Psychoactive Medication, and 
Intellectual  and  Developmental  Disabilities

The  Long-Term  Planning  Committee  focuses  on  long-term  goal  setting  and  offering 
input on possible new JCMH projects. The Long-Term Planning Committee is chaired by 
Judge John Specia, Jr. In 2021, the Committee met to discuss JCMH goals and had many 
suggestions to steer the work of the Commission moving forward. In 2022, the committee 
divided its work into four subcommittees: Ethics, Implicit Bias, Mental Health Courts, 
and Juvenile Mental Health. A new strategic plan is coming in 2022. 

HON. CAMILE DUBOSE
Bench Book Committee Chair

The Bench Book provides information for 
judges, court staff, legal, mental health and 
IDD  professionals,  and  the  community 
trying  to  navigate  the  intersection  of  the 
legal  system  and  mental  health  and  IDD 
challenges.  It  helps  to  clarify  a  system 
with  no  “one  size  fits all” approach. 
The  Committee’s  hard  work  has  given 
professionals  and  families  an  easy  and 
accessible  tool  that  consolidates  available 
information into an understandable format. 

“As a Judge who has worked in a Mental 
Health Specialty Court, when I was asked 
to  chair  this  committee,  I  knew  its  work 
would  have  far  reaching  and  tangible 
benefits to all those who were  seeking 
information regarding the legal system, and 
mental  health  and  IDD  challenges  within 
that system. It has been a privilege to work 
with  all  of  the  members  of  the  committee 
and with the JCMH members and staff in 
developing this resource.”

REPORT TO THE COURTS | 2020–2021

TEXAS JUDICIAL COMMISSION ON MENTAL HEALTHLegislative Research

The Supreme Court of Texas and Texas Court of Criminal Appeals have a strong 
interest  in  studying  the  organization  and  practices  of  the  Texas  Judicial  Branch 
related to behavioral and mental health needs of individuals before the courts. On 
October 1, 2019, the two highest Courts in the state ordered the creation of the 
Legislative Research Committee, to make relevant recommendations to the Texas 
Judicial Council. The 86th Legislature enacted Senate Bill 362, which directed 
the Supreme Court to adopt rules to streamline and promote the efficiency of 
court processes. One task force was chaired by Justice Bill Boyce and the other 
was led by Judge Brent Carr.

The current JCMH Legislative Research Committee now represents those two 
task forces appointed in 2019. The work of the two task forces was submitted 
to  the  Texas  Judicial  Council  and  unanimously  approved  to  be  included  in 
the  Texas  Judicial  Council’s  Criminal  Justice  Committee’s  2020  Report  and 
Recommendations to the Legislature. In the 2021 regular legislative session, 10 
of the 16 JCMH proposals were entered into law.

1) Acceptance of Plea in Justice and Municipal Courts

HB  3774,  Section  3,  amends  Chapter  45  of  the  Texas  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure 
(CCP) and adds art. 45.0241 which states, “A justice or judge may not accept a plea of 
guilty or plea of nolo contendere from a defendant in open court unless it appears to the 
justice or judge that the defendant is mentally competent, and the plea is free and voluntary.”

2) 16.22 Interview for a Defendant No Longer in Custody

SB 49, Section 1 amends Texas Code of Criminal Procedure art. 16.22 (a)(2) to omit the requirement that 

a magistrate order a mental health interview for a defendant that is no longer in custody. 

3) Oath and Promise to Appear for Persons with Mental Illness or IDD
SB 49, Section 3, amends Code of Criminal Procedure art. 17.04 by adding subsection (3)(b). This amendment removes the personal bond
oath requirement if a magistrate makes a determination under 16.22 that the defendant has mental illness or IDD, if the defendant is released
under art. 17.032, or if the defendant is found incompetent to stand trial in accordance with CCP chapter 46B.

4) Jail-Based Competency Restoration Pilot Program and County Programs
SB 49, Section 6 amends Code of Criminal Procedure art. 46B.090 to set standards and procedures for a Jail-Based Competency Restoration
(JBCR) program that is aligned with programs established by a county and also mandates a sunset provision of the Texas Health and Human
Services Commission (HHSC) pilot program, set for September 1, 2022.

7) Deadlines for Competency Evaluations and Timelines in Jail-Based Competency
Restoration Programs
SB  49,  Section  7,  amends  CCP  art.  46B.091  to  allow  for  extended  periods  of  JBCR  and  for
outpatient competency restoration for defendants who are determined not to be a danger to others.

PROF. BRIAN SHANNON
Legislative Research 
Subcommittee Chair

Time Periods for Competency Orders
5) SB 49, Section 4, adds art. 46B.0735 to clarify the commencement of competency restoration.
The  added  article  states:  “The  initial  restoration  period  for  a  defendant  under  art.  46B.0711,
46B.072 or 46B.073 begins on the later of (1) the date the defendant is: (A) ordered to participate
in an outpatient competency restoration program; or (B) committed to a mental health facility,
residential care facility, or jail-based competency restoration program; or (2) the date competency
restoration services actually begin.”

6) SB 49, Section 5, clarifies and amends art. 46B.080 by adding subsection (d), which states,
“An extension under this article begins the later of: (1) the date the court enters the order under
Subsection (a); or (2) the date competency restoration services actually begin pursuant to the order
entered under Subsection (a).”

8) Possibility of a Step Down from Court-Ordered Inpatient to Outpatient Mental Health
Services under 46B.105
SB 49, Section 8, amends Chapter 46B of the Code of Criminal Procedure by adding art. 46B.1055.
The article creates a process to request a defendant’s step-down in their civil commitment order to
include a transfer to outpatient treatment services.

9) Expert Qualifications in Competency and Insanity Evaluations
SB 49, Section 9, amends CCP art. 46C.102 to eliminate the 5-year legacy exception and align the
expert qualifications for insanity with those for incompetency.

10) Psychiatric Stabilization at the Jail
SB  49,  Section  10,  adds  Government  Code  sec.  511.009(d)(2),  which  mandates  that  inmates
with mental illness be provided with each necessary medication that is prescribed by a qualified
medical professional or mental health professional.

REPORT TO THE COURTS | 2020–2021

TEXAS JUDICIAL COMMISSION ON MENTAL HEALTHEDUCATION

The JCMH was created to develop, implement, and coordinate policy initiatives designed to 
improve the courts’ interaction with—and the administration of justice for—children, adults, 
and families with mental health needs. Since 2018, the JCMH has published three editions 
of  the  Texas  Mental  Health  and  Intellectual  and  Developmental  Disabilities  Law  Bench 
Book, two  editions  of  the  juvenile  version  of  the  bench  book,  and  two  editions  of  Texas 
Mental  Health and Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Law: Selected Statutes and 
Rules. The goal of these publications is to educate stakeholders about existing policies and 
procedures and serve as a reference. 

The JCMH also facilitates education at the annual Judicial Summit on Mental Health. The 
two-day  conference  provides  attendees  with  an  opportunity  to  learn  from  presentations  by 
experts in their fields, as well as to discuss best practices at the intersection of criminal justice 
and mental health with peers.

Code Book | 2021–2022 Edition

The  JCMH,  building  on  the  work  of  Chris  Lopez  at 
HHSC,  created  Texas  Mental  Health  and  Intellectual 
and  Developmental  Disabilities  Law:  Selected  Statutes 
and  Rules,  a  collection  of  Texas  statutes  related  to 
mental health  and  IDD  in  one  convenient  volume.  The

Leading Change | Judicial Summit on Mental Health
Third Annual Summit: November 9–10, 2020
The  Judicial  Commission  on  Mental  Health  hosted  its  third  annual  Judicial  Summit  on  Mental 
Health November 9–10, 2020, on a completely virtual platform. The 2020 Summit drew over 1,500 
attendees from across Texas and the nation to discuss and develop solutions to the many challenges 
faced by individuals in the court system with mental illness or IDD. This was a nearly 200% increase 
in attendance from the 2019 Summit.

Reviews of the 2020 Summit

Attendees included judges from all levels of the judiciary, academics, law enforcement, advocacy 
groups, prosecutors, defense attorneys, mental health and IDD service providers, representatives 
from  various  state  agencies,  policymakers,  persons  with  lived  experience,  and  many  others. 
Each  Summit  attendee  was  provided  access  to  over  sixty  resources,  including  supporting  slides 
and  one-pagers  created  by  the  presenters;  reports,  websites,  and  videos  referenced  by  the 
speakers during their presentations; and downloadable books.

TEXAS JUDICIAL COMMISSION ON MENTAL HEALTHFourth Annual Summit: October 14–15, 2021

After putting on a fully virtual event in 2020, the JCMH hosted the fourth annual Judicial Summit in Georgetown, Texas. The event was also 
livestreamed on a virtual platform. The decision to host a hybrid event was based on the success of the virtual event the previous year. In 2021, the 
Summit drew 1,400 judges and stakeholders from across Texas and the U.S. Attendance makeup was similar to that of the 2020 Summit: judges 
from  all  levels  of  the  judiciary,  academics,  law  enforcement,  advocacy  groups,  prosecutors,  defense  attorneys,  mental  health  and  IDD  service 
providers, representatives from various state agencies, policymakers, persons with lived experience, and many others. 

Speakers attended both in Georgetown and virtually. The Summit’s presentations included: “Mental Health Law Legislative Update,” “Resources 
for Justice-Involved Youth,” and “Competency Restoration Crisis,” among others. Summit attendees were provided access to resources including 
the  newly  released  2021  editions  of  the  Texas  Mental  Health  and  Intellectual  and  Development  Disabilities  Law  Bench  Book  and  its  juvenile 
bench book  counterpart;  the  Eliminate the  Wait  toolkit,  which  provided  targeted  checklists  for  a  variety  of  professions  to  actively combat  the 
competency restoration inpatient services waitlist; and all presenter supporting slides, websites, and reports. All resources and session recordings 
are available on the JCMH website.

Breaking Barriers | New in 2021
1) The 2021 Summit featured the debut of the Eliminate the Wait
toolkit. An expansive panel discussed issues relating to competency
restoration in Texas, then introduced the joint JCMH and HHSC
initiative  entitled  Eliminate  the  Wait. Attendees  learned  how  to
use the toolkit as a starting point for comprehensive and systemic
change to competency restoration processes.

2) The  Summit showcased  a short  documentary film about  the
TILT  Performance    Group,  a  theater  troupe  consisting    entirely
of    individuals  with  disabilities. Attendees    learned    about    this
engaging  group’s  important  work  in  Central  Texas.

3) Judge Brent Carr discussed ethical considerations in specialty
courts,  specifically,  the  2021  Supreme  Court  Order  Adopting
Comment  to  the  Texas  Code  of  Judicial  Conduct  Canon  3,
which  specifies  that  it  is  not  a  violation  for  a  judge  presiding
over a specialty court to initiate, permit, or consider any ex parte
communications in a matter pending in that court.

TEXAS JUDICIAL COMMISSION ON MENTAL HEALTHLEADERSHIP

Since  its  inception,  the  JCMH  has  identified  and  assessed  current  and  future  needs  for 
the  courts  to  be  more  effective  in  achieving  positive  outcomes  for  Texans  with  mental 
illness. In order to do this, the JCMH has convened a diverse group of Commissioners and 
Collaborative Councilmembers. These individuals are leaders in their respective fields; the 
Commission and Collaborative Council are made up of judges, attorneys, law enforcement, 
mental  health  advocates,  people  with  lived  experience,  and  more.  In  2018,  the  JCMH 
had 36 Commissioners and 61 Collaborative Councilmembers. As of 2022, there are 46 
Commissioners and 64 Collaborative Councilmembers. 

Over time, the JCMH has gained recognition by stakeholders across the state of Texas and 
is a leader in promoting best practices and programs that are data-driven, evidence-based, 
and outcome-focused. The Commission does this by awarding grants and both promoting 
and increasing available judicial system resources. 

Making a Difference | Eliminate the Wait

The competency to stand trial process is designed to protect the rights of people who do not understand the charges against them and are unable to 
assist in their own defense. Like other states across the U.S., Texas faces a growing crisis in the number of people who are waiting in county jails 
for inpatient competency restoration services after being declared incompetent to stand trial. Not only has this increased costs and overburdened 
state agencies and county jails, but it also is taking a significant toll on the health and well-being of people waiting in Texas jails for inpatient 
competency restoration services. Meanwhile, resources available to the behavioral health and justice professionals serving our communities are 
becoming scarce.

It is time to right size competency restoration services for Texans by taking a comprehensive and integrated 
approach to this challenge. That’s why the Judicial Commission on Mental Health and HHSC created the 
Eliminate  the  Wait  toolkit. We  ask  judges,  prosecutors,  defense  attorneys,  sheriffs and  jail  staff, police, 
and  behavioral  health  providers  to  join  our  collaborative  effort to change how Texas serves people at the 
intersection  of  mental  health  and  criminal  justice.  We  all  have  a  role  to  play  to  ELIMINATE  THE 
WAIT. The full toolkit is available on the JCMH website.

“We applaud this collaborative effort to raise awareness about competency-restoration services 
and best practices. It engages courts, law enforcement, and mental health professionals in an 
effort to better use state resources for people with mental health disorders or intellectual and 
developmental disabilities who encounter our justice system.”

TEXAS JUDICIAL COMMISSION ON MENTAL HEALTHFunding Innovation | Community 
Diversion Coordinator Pilot Program

Defendants  with  mental  illness  often  languish  in  jail  while  on  the  State  Hospital’s  forensic 
waitlist for  inpatient  competency  restoration  services.  To  help  alleviate  this  burden  on  both 
defendants  and  the  system,  the  JCMH  has  partnered  with  HHSC  to  develop  a  Pilot  Program 
with  the  goal  of increasing the judiciary’s connection to diversionary resources and treatment 
with  the  benefit  of  reducing  the  use  of  competency  restoration  services  and  stalling  the 
growth  of  the  forensic  waitlist.  The  Pilot  Program  also  focuses  on  an  innovative  pathway 
that  will  place  a  stronger  emphasis  on  public  safety  and  prevention  of  deterioration,  quicker 
interventions, and a greater emphasis on maintaining outpatient compliance with treatment.

Three counties (Denton, Grayson, and Smith) were selected and have received funding for a 
Community Diversion Coordinator. The duties of the Community Diversion Coordinator include:

• Develop  and  foster  collaborative  relationships  with  and  between  Local  Mental  Health
Authorities and Local Behavioral Health Authorities, State Hospitals, State Supported Living
Centers, courts, community providers, contract providers, probation/community supervision
and corrections department, sheriffs’ offices, police departments, district attorney and county
attorney offices, public defender’s offices, and defense bar associations.
Engage stakeholders in education on the many diversion opportunities across the Sequential
Intercept  Model  (SIM),  including  the  process  of  transferring  appropriate  cases  from  the
criminal court to probate court, local mental health crisis and diversion programs, mental
health and substance use treatment resources and community-based supports, competency- 
restoration processes, waitlist procedures, and available diversions and services.

•

• Assist the court and attorneys in evaluating cases and defendants to determine if a pathway
other than jail would better serve the community and the defendant’s mental health needs.

The  National  Center  for  State  Courts  will  assist  the  three  Pilot  Program  counties  with 
the development and implementation of specific, measurable, attainable, reasonable, and 
time-specific  goals.  NCSC  will  also  provide  process  evaluations,  outcome  evaluations, 
and cost-benefit analyses for the Pilot Programs.

Denton  County  is  the  largest  pilot  county, 
located immediately north of Dallas and Tarrant 
Counties.  It  is  the  7th  largest  county  in  Texas 
and  is  quickly  growing.  With  that  growth  in 
population,  there  has  also  been  a  growing 
consensus among the county Judiciary that there 
is  a  need  for  jail  diversion  and  competency 
measures  at  a  local  level.  The  county  hopes 
the  diversion  program  will  bring  awareness, 
treatment  options,  education,  and  coordination 
among all stakeholders.  

Grayson County
Coordinator: Elizabeth Groves

Smith County is located in East Texas with Tyler 
serving as its county seat. The county wrote in 
its  application  for  the  grant  that  most  inmates 
are released from jail without an adequate, long-
term treatment plan and are often rearrested. The 
cycle  places  a  strain  on  law  enforcement,  the 
jail,  courts,  and  LMHA.  County  leaders  hope 
the Community Diversion Coordinator will be a 
resource for individuals who have mental health 
needs and will help reduce recidivism.

Denton County
Coordinator: Erica Baldwin

Grayson  County  is  the  smallest  pilot  county, 
located  on 
the  Oklahoma  border.  The 
community has come together in recent years 
to improve the county’s response to those in the 
community struggling with mental health issues. 
The  Texoma  Behavioral  Health  Leadership 
Team  was  formed  in  2017  and  consists  of  35 
community  leaders.  While  forming  this  team 
was  a  good  start,  county  leaders  identified  a 
need  for  a  full  time  Community  Diversion 
Coordinator to continue the work.

JOHN PETRILA
Data Subcommittee Chair

The  Data  Committee’s  Competency 
Restoration  Subcommittee  focuses  on  the 
collection  and  utilization  of  court  data  as 
it  pertains  to  individuals  who  have  been 
deemed incompetent to stand trial in Texas, 
and  explores  ways  to  use  this  data  to 
decrease the wait times for State Hospital 
inpatient competency restoration services.

“The volume of cases before the courts in 
which mental illness and substance abuse 
are issues only continues to grow. The more 
we  can  use  data  to  help  understand  not 
only  volume  but  the  characteristics  of  the 
people  who  make  up  those  caseloads,  the 
more likely we can find alternatives to the 
justice system for those who would benefit, 
match  the  person  to  treatment  resources, 
and  hopefully  over  time  create  different 
paths  for  those  suffering  from  serious 
mental health issues.”

TEXAS JUDICIAL COMMISSION ON MENTAL HEALTHFrom the Jurist in Residence
Four years ago, the need for a mental health commission could not have been clearer. At the unprecedented 
joint  public  hearing  where  both  high  courts  sat  together  for  the  first time, we heard testimony about 
overcrowded dockets; the lack of communication between courts, attorneys, advocates, and local mental 
health providers; the demand for multidisciplinary legal training; a call for technology solutions to manage 
dockets and track cases; and the need for increased community mental health resources for children, youth, 
and adults. The call for help was loud and clear, and our 31 original Commissioners resolutely answered it.

Mental Health Education and Resources 
from the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
Education Grants

The Judicial Education Section of the Court of Criminal Appeals administers grants to judges, 
court personnel, prosecuting attorneys and their personnel, and criminal defense attorneys who 
regularly represent indigent defendants in criminal matters. Pursuant to Chapter 56 of the Texas 
Government Code and the General Appropriations Act, the purpose of these grants is to provide 
continuing  legal  education  courses,  programs,  and  technical  assistance  projects.  The  grants 
can also be administered to law enforcement officers, law students, and other participants to 
attend innocence training programs related to defendants’ claims of actual innocence following 
conviction. 

These grants from the Court of Criminal Appeals have been supported by the Texas Legislature, 
which has continued to invest resources into mental health. In 2017, the Legislature appropriated 
funds to the Court of Criminal Appeals to provide grants for continuing legal education, courses, 
and programs for judges and court staff, prosecuting attorneys, and criminal defense attorneys 
on mental health issues and pre-trial diversion. 

In 2019, the Legislature appropriated additional funds to the Court of Criminal Appeals for 
the development of a training program to educate and inform judges and their staff on mental 
health care resources available in Texas.

Texas Mental Health Resource Guide
The  Texas  Mental  Health  Resource  Guide  was  born  out  of 
a  vision  by  Judge  Barbara  Hervey.  Judge  Hervey  wanted  to 
create  a 
resource  guide  with  practical 
information  that  would improve the lives of those in the criminal 
justice system who could benefit from alternatives to incarceration.

The Court of Criminal Appeals, along with grantee organizations, 
published the first guide in 2019. The Resource Guide provides an 
explanation of mental health services and lists resources  by type, 
region, and county. 

HON. YOLANDA HUFF
Data Subcommittee Chair

The  Data  Committee  is  instrumental  in 
providing  the  numbers  that  help  identify 
the gaps in the judiciary in regard to mental 
health. Judge Huff’s Subcommittee targets 
data relating to Art. 16.22 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure. The data is there for 
courts  to  avail  themselves  of  how,  why, 
and who needs the most help. 

“I  think  it  is  vital  that  the  judiciary 
understands  what  the  16.22  law  is  and 
how  it  helps  the  Judiciary  as  a  whole  in 
dealing with mental health at the earliest 
opportunity possible. I have enjoyed myself 
serving  on  various  committees.  Not  only 
am I learning a lot, but I am meeting some 
fantastic people from all across Texas.”

TEXAS JUDICIAL COMMISSION ON MENTAL HEALTHSharing Knowledge | Technical Assistance

Discovering what your community needs to be at its best is a process, and we’re here to help. Our JCMH staff is available to provide technical 
assistance to Texas state and local courts to implement policies and procedures within the justice system that improve the lives of individuals with 
mental health needs, substance use disorders, or IDD.

Our team can help with the following types of technical assistance:

Providing training resources for local judges/lawyers on specific mental health related laws and procedures;
Providing on-site assistance, such as facilitating a SIM Mapping Workshop;
Participating in planning meetings and offering feedback;

•
•
•
• Connecting judges and attorneys with peers for mentorship, advising, and brainstorming;
• Creating, expanding, or improving a county mental health court;
•
• Assisting in finding external sources of technical assistance.

Facilitating virtual or in-person meetings between judges, mental or behavioral health experts, lawyers, and more; and

Identifying Resources | Sequential Intercept Model Mapping Workshops

JCMH partners with HHSC’s Texas Behavioral Health and Justice Technical Assistance Resource 
Center to provide SIM mapping workshops for communities. Generally, SIM mapping workshops 
have three primary objectives: 

• Development of a comprehensive picture of how people with mental illness and co-occurring
disorders  flow  through  the  criminal  justice  system  along  six  distinct  intercept  points:  (0)
Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams/Co-Response, (1) Law Enforcement and Emergency Services,
(2) Initial Detention and Initial Court Hearings, (3) Jails  and Courts,  (4) Re-entry, and (5)
Community Corrections/Community Support.
Identification  of  gaps,  resources,  and  opportunities  at  each  intercept  for  individuals  in  the
target population.

•

• Development of priorities for activities designed to improve system and service level response

for individuals in the target population.

The Sequential Intercept Model has been used as 
a focal point for states and communities to assess 
available resources, determine gaps in services, 
and plan for community change. These activities 
are best accomplished by a team of stakeholders 
that  span  multiple  systems,  including  mental 
health, substance abuse, law enforcement, pretrial 
services,  courts,  jails,  community  corrections, 
housing,  health,  social  services,  peers,  family 
members, and many others.

A SIM mapping is a workshop to develop a map that illustrates how people with behavioral health needs come into contact with and flow through the 
criminal justice system. Through the workshop, facilitators and participants identify opportunities for linkage to services and prevention of further 
penetration into the criminal justice system. The Sequential Intercept Model was developed through SAMHSA’s GAINS Center at Policy Research 
Associates. The JCMH is scheduled to facilitate numerous SIM mapping workshops in 2022.

SIM Mapping in Denton County 

The National Center for Youth Opportunity and Justice 
facilitated  a  mapping  workshop  of  Denton  County’s 
juvenile  justice  system  July  28–29,  2021.  Twenty-
nine  stakeholders  including  schools,  police,  probation, 
courts, providers, family members, and Denton County 
based  agencies,  were  represented  at  the  day-and-a-half 
workshop. The  group  created  a  map  of  how  youth  and 
families  interact  with  child-serving  systems  in  Denton 
County, specifically:

•
•
•
•
•
•

Schools
Health and Public Health Services
Behavioral Health Services
Support Services
Child Welfare
Juvenile Justice

Together,  the  group  identified  gaps  and  opportunities 
and  established  four  main  priorities  for  change.  Based 
on those priorities, the stakeholders created a preliminary 
action  plan  to  improve  the  community’s  capacity  to 
respond to youth with behavioral health needs.

training for judges and other stakeholders 
in a variety of areas, including intellectual 
disability and peer support. 

“Judicial  input  in  the  development  of 
statewide  policy  recommendations 
is 
critical.  I  was  honored  to  step  up  and 
provide  a 
judicial  perspective.  The 
to  critically  analyze  and 
opportunity 
collaborate with  judges and  stakeholders 
across the state has impacted my work on 
the bench.”  

Written by Professor Brian Shannon, friend of Dr. Jennings

Sadly,  Floyd  Jennings  passed  away  in April  2021. A member  of  the  JCMH  Collaborative 
Council, he was one of the state’s foremost experts on Texas mental health law.

Dr. Jennings had a lifelong thirst for knowledge. After graduating from McMurry University, 
he earned two divinity degrees from Perkins School of Theology at SMU, before obtaining 
his Ph.D. in clinical psychology at UT’s Southwestern Medical School. After many years as a 
clinical psychologist, he became very interested in mental health law and began law school at 
the age of 51 at the University of Houston, where he earned his J.D. in 1996.

After having spent many years as a consultant for various mental health agencies and as a 
long-time adjunct professor in Psychiatry at the UT Medical School in Houston, Dr. Jennings 
joined the staff of the Harris County Office of County Court Administration in 2008 and then 
moved to the Harris County Public Defender’s office in 2010, where he was still heading up 
the Misdemeanor Mental Health Division at the time of his death.

I got to know Floyd during this last great chapter of his life. He and I collaborated on draft 
legislation  in  multiple  legislative  sessions,  on  various  JCMH  projects,  and  on  many  CLE 
conference  presentations.  We  also  visited  by  email  or  phone  almost  weekly  over  the  last 
decade of his life to discuss and share our respective viewpoints on real world challenges and 
interpretations of Chapter 46B and other legal issues involving persons with mental illness.

In  the  last  edition  of  my  guidebook,  Texas  Criminal  Procedure  &  the  Offender  with 
Mental Illness, I had the chance to thank Floyd publicly for reviewing drafts of my book and 
offering very  helpful  suggestions,  but  more  importantly  “for  our  many  years  of  delightful 
exchanges  and collaborations on some of the thorny legal problems involving persons with 
mental illness and the Texas criminal justice system.” 

He was always generous with his time. He cared for his family, clients, colleagues, and the rule 
of law. His wisdom and commitment will continue to be sorely missed.

legislative  recommendations  pertaining 
to  the  effective  diversion  of  individuals 
with  mental  health  issues  and  IDD  away

“While the role of the judiciary is limited

a unique vantage point on how the lives of 
people with mental illness and intellectual 
disabilities can traverse the legal system. 
When  we  can  serve  as  a  resource  for 
policy  makers  and  help  improve  the  law, 
we should welcome the opportunity.”
