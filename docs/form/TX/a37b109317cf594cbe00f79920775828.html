PROPOSED STATEWIDE RULES 

governing  

ELECTRONIC FILING in CRIMINAL CASES 
 
PART 1.  GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 

Rule 1.1 Scope 
These rules govern the electronic filing of documents with the clerk in criminal cases in district 
courts, statutory county courts, constitutional county courts, justice courts, and municipal courts 
in those counties in which criminal case electronic filing has been implemented pursuant to Rule 
1.2 of these rules. 
  
Rule 1.2 Electronic Filing Permitted 
A clerk may implement criminal case electronic filing in that clerk’s office when he or she has 
the written consent  of  a  majority of the judges in the  county who have jurisdiction in  criminal 
cases  and  who  are  served  by  that  clerk.    Where  criminal  case  electronic  filing  has  been 
implemented in a clerk’s office, a filer may file and serve documents in a case either through the 
electronic filing system or by paper.  

Rule 1.3 Documents That May Be Electronically Filed 
Any document that can be filed with a court in paper form may be electronically filed with the 
following exceptions: 
 

charging instruments; 

documents filed under seal or presented to the court in camera; and 

documents  to  which  access  is  otherwise  restricted  by  these  rules,  law,  or  court 
order. 

Rule 1.4 Documents Containing Signatures 
(a)   A document that is electronically served, filed, or issued by a court or clerk is considered 

signed if the document includes:  

a “/s/” and name typed in the space where the signature would otherwise appear, 
unless the document is notarized or sworn; or 

an electronic image or scanned image of the signature. 

(b)  

 
If  a  paper  document  must  be  notarized,  sworn  to,  or  made  under  oath,  the  filer  may 
electronically  file  the  paper  document  as  a  scanned  image  containing  the  necessary 
signature(s).

3)

(c)  

If  a  paper  document  requires  the  signature  of  an  opposing  party,  the  filer  may 
electronically file the paper document as a scanned image containing the opposing party’s 
signature. 

   
Comment to Part 1: These rules apply to electronic filers who would otherwise have been filing 
manually  with  clerks.    These  rules  do  not  affect  court  reporters,  exhibits  filed  in  a  hearing  or 
trial, or documents filed directly with a judge.  Further, permitting electronic filing should not be 
construed  as  authority  to  mandate  electronic  filing.   These  rules  also  do  not  affect  whether 
electronically filed documents may be posted on the internet. 
 

PART 2.  FILING MECHANISM 
 

Rule 2.1 Office of Court Administration established Electronic Filing Manager 
Electronic filing must be done through the electronic filing manager established by the Office of 
Court  Administration  and  an  electronic  filing  service  provider  certified  by  the  Office  of  Court 
Administration. 

(1) 

be in text-searchable portable document format (PDF); 

be directly converted to PDF rather than scanned, if possible; 

not be locked; and 

An electronically filed document must: 
 

ule 2.2 Format 

  R

otherwise comply  with  the Technology Standards set by the  Judicial Committee 
on Information Technology and approved by the Supreme Court and the Court of 
Criminal Appeals. 

Rule 2.3 Timely Filing 
(a)  

Unless a statute, rule, or court order requires that a document be filed by a certain time of 
day, a document is considered timely filed if it is electronically filed at any time before 
midnight  (in  the  court’s  time  zone)  on  the  day  of  the  filing  deadline.  An  electronically 
filed  document  is  deemed  filed  when  transmitted  to  the  filing  party’s  electronic  filing 
service provider, except: 

if a document is transmitted on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, it is deemed 
filed on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday; and 

if a document requires a motion and an order allowing its filing, the document is 
deemed filed on the date the motion is granted.  

(b) 

 
 If a document is untimely filed due to a technical failure or a system outage, the filing 
party may seek appropriate relief from the court.

Comment  to  Rule  2.3:  This  rule  addresses  when  a  document  is  timely  filed  for  purposes  of 
meeting a legal deadline imposed by a statute or a court.  A clerk’s acceptance of a document on 
a weekend or legal holiday does not impact whether a document is timely filed under this rule. 

ule 2.4 Official Record 

The  clerk  may  designate  an  electronically  filed  document  or  a  scanned  paper  document  as  the 
official court record. The clerk is not required to keep both paper and electronic versions of the 
same document. 

ule 2.5 E-Mail Address Required 

The  email  address  of  any  person  who  electronically  files  a  document  must  be  included  on  the 
document.  

ule 2.6 Paper Copies 

At the time of filing, a filer need not provide paper copies of an electronically filed document.  A 
filer should provide paper copies of electronically filed documents upon request by a court. 

ule 2.7 Electronic Notices from the Court 

The  clerk  may  send  notices,  orders,  or  other  communications  about  the  case  to  the  party 
electronically. A court seal may be electronic. 

ule 2.8 Non-Conforming Documents 

The  clerk  may  not  refuse  a  document  that  fails  to  conform  to  these  rules.  But  the  clerk  may 
identify the error to be corrected and state a deadline for the party to resubmit the document in a 
conforming format. 
  
Comment  to  Rule  2.8:  The  intent  of  this  rule  is  to  establish  that  a  clerk  may  not  refuse  a 
document  for  any  perceived  violation  of  these  rules.  However,  the  rule  permits  a  clerk  the 
limited  authority  to  identify  errors  the  clerk  perceives  with  whether  a  filing  complies  with  the 
Judicial  Committee  on  Information  Technology  Standards  currently  in  effect.  When  a  clerk 
notifies a filer of an error, it is inconsequential to a judicial determination regarding whether the 
document submitted actually violates these rules, and it does not constitute an extension of time 
to file the document. The purpose of the deadline is to allow for a non-conforming document to 
be conformed to these rules. The deadline for correction established by the clerk should permit 
only a reasonable amount of time to allow for the filing to be conformed to the requirements of 
these rules, and, in general, the deadline should not exceed 72 hours. 
 

PART 3. SERVICE OF DOCUMENTS 
  

Rule 3.1 Electronic Service of Documents Permissible 
Every notice required by these rules, and every pleading, plea, motion, or other form of request 
required to be served, except as otherwise  expressly provided in these rules, may be served by 
delivering a  copy to the  party to be served, or  the  party’s  duly  authorized  agent or  attorney of 
record.

Documents  Filed  Electronically.  A  document  filed  electronically  under  these  rules  must  be 
served  electronically  through  the  electronic  filing  manager  if  the  email  address  of  the  party  or 
attorney  to  be  served  is  on  file  with  the  electronic  filing  manager.  If  the  email  address  of  the 
party or attorney to be served is not on file with the electronic filing manager, the document may 
be served on that party or attorney as permitted by law. 

ule 3.2 Electronic Service Complete 

Electronic service is complete on transmission of the document to the serving party’s electronic 
filing  service  provider.  The  electronic  filing  manager  will  send  confirmation  of  service  to  the 
serving party. 

ule 3.3 Proof of Service 

The  party  or  attorney  of  record  shall  certify  to  the  court  compliance  with  this  rule  in  writing 
above the signature on the filed instrument. A certificate by a party or an attorney of record, or 
the return of the officer, or the affidavit of any other person showing service of a notice shall be 
prima facie evidence of the fact of service. Nothing herein shall preclude any party from offering 
proof that the document, notice, or instrument was not received, and upon so finding, the court 
may extend the time for taking the action required of such party or grant such other relief as it 
deems just. 
 

PART 4.  ELECTRONIC ORDERS AND VIEWING OF 
ELECTRONICALLY-FILED DOCUMENTS 
 

Rule 4.1 Courts Authorized to Make Electronic Orders 
A judge may electronically sign an order by applying his or her electronic signature to the order.  
Judges are not required to electronically sign orders. 
  

PART 5.  PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR FILED DOCUMENTS 
 

a  driver’s  license  number,  passport  number,  social  security  number,  tax 
identification  number,  or  similar  government-issued  personal  identification 
number; 

a  bank  account  number,  credit  card  number,  or  other  financial  account  number; 
and 

a birth date, home address, and the name of any person who was a minor when the 
underlying suit was filed.

Rule 5.2 Filing of Documents Containing Sensitive Data Prohibited 
An electronic or paper document containing sensitive data may not be filed with a court unless 
the  sensitive  data  is  redacted.    Documents  containing  sensitive  data  may  be  filed  with  a  court 
when  the  data’s  inclusion  is  specifically  required  by  a  statute,  court  rule,  or  administrative 

4 

Rule 5.1 Sensitive Data Defined 
Sensitive data consists of: 
 

  R

  R

 

regulation, or when the data is exempt from redaction under Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure 
rule 9.10. 

ule 5.3 Redaction of Sensitive Data; Retention Requirement  

Sensitive data must be redacted by using the letter “X” in place of each omitted digit or character 
or  by  removing  the  sensitive  data  in  a  manner  indicating  that  the  data  has  been  redacted.  The 
filing party must retain an unredacted version of the filed document during the pendency of the 
case  and  any  related  appellate  proceedings  filed  within  three  years  of  the  date  the  judgment  is 
signed. 

ule 5.4 Notice to Clerk  

If an electronic or paper document must contain sensitive data, the filing party must state on the 
upper left-hand side of the first page, “NOTICE: THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS SENSITIVE 
DATA.”  This  notice  is  not  required  if  the  only  sensitive  data  contained  in  the  document  is 
exempt from redaction under Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.10. 

ule 5.5 Non-Conforming Documents  

The clerk may not refuse a document that  contains sensitive data in violation  of these rules or 
any  other  statute,  rule,  or  court  order.  But  the  clerk  may  identify  the  error  to  be  corrected  and 
state a deadline for the party to resubmit a redacted, substitute document. 

omment  to  Rule  5.5:  The  intent  of  this  rule  is  to  establish  that  a  clerk  may  not  refuse  a 
document  for  any  perceived  violation  of  these  rules.  However,  the  rule  permits  a  clerk  the 
limited  authority  to  identify  information  the  clerk  perceives  to  be  sensitive  data.  When  a  clerk 
identifies  such  information  to  a  filer,  it  does  not  constitute  an  extension  of  time  to  file  the 
document.  The  purpose  of  the  deadline  is  to  allow  for  a  non-conforming  document  to  be 
conformed to these rules. The deadline for correction established by the clerk should permit only 
a reasonable amount of time to allow for the filing to be conformed to the requirements of these 
rules, and, in general, the deadline should not exceed 72 hours. 
  
Rule 5.6 Restriction on Remote Access  
Documents  that  contain  sensitive  data  in  violation  of  these  rules  must  not  be  posted  on  the 
internet.
