TEXAS JUDICIARY LEGISLATIVE UPDATE
TEXAS JUDICIAL COUNCIL

85th
Legislature

Increasing Compliance with Court Costs and Fees

Addressing Mental Health

Improving the Guardianship System

Funding the Judiciary

JULY 2017Strengthening Court SecurityFrom the Executive Director

The  85th  Legislative  Session  was  one  of  the  most  active 
sessions for the Texas Judiciary in recent years. More than 1700 
bills were filed that had a direct impact on the third branch of 
government. The Office of Court Administration also analyzed 
and drafted 1181 fiscal notes for the Legislative Budget Board. 
The  Texas  Judicial  Council,  the  policy  making  body  for  the 
Judiciary,  had  a  full  legislative  package  and  found  success  in 
multiple policy areas. 

Increasing Compliance with Court Costs and 
Fees

In his 2017 State of the Judiciary speech, Texas Supreme Court 
Chief  Justice  Nathan  L.  Hecht  discussed  what  is  commonly 
known  as  “debtors’  prisons,”  the  practice  of  jailing  criminal 
defendants for being unable to pay their fines and court costs.  
He said debtors’ prisons are not only illegal under the United 
States  Constitution,  they  also  keep  people  “from  jobs,  hurts 
their  families,  makes  them  dependent  on  society  and  costs 
taxpayers money.” The Legislature agreed and passed SB 1913. 
The  bill  makes  statutory  changes  to  improve  the  assessment 
and collection of criminal court costs including:   

•  Requiring  judges  handling  cases  in  open  court  to  ask 
about  a  defendant’s  ability  to  pay  when  imposing 
the  sentence  and  to  use  existing  tools  of  installment 
plans, community service, full or partial waiver, or any 
combination of those, if a defendant has an inability to pay in full;

•  Expanding community service options a judge may impose;
• 
•  Prohibits the posting of a monetary bail in a fine-only offense unless the defendant fails to appear and the judge 

Increasing the minimum amount of credit for jail or community service from $50 to $100 for each day; and

finds that the defendant can post bail.

Addressing Mental Health

More than 20 percent of the inmate population in Texas needs mental health services. With that sobering statistic in mind, 
the Judicial Council made several legislative recommendations to improve the administration of justice for those suffering 
from  or  affected  by  mental  illness.  While  several  bills  were  filed  that  addressed  mental  health,  the  Judicial  Council’s 
recommendations passed both chambers in SB 1326 and SB 292. The bills make several statutory changes including:

SB 1326

•  Revises  the  process  of  gathering  and  assessing 
information  about  an  arrestee  who  may  have  a 
mental illness in the magistration process;

•  Streamlines the competency restoration process; 

and

•  Authorizes  counties 

to  establish 

jail-based 

competency restoration programs.

2

SB 292 – Jail Diversion Grant Programs

•  The  grant  program  was  created  for  the  purpose 
of  reducing  recidivism,  arrest,  and  incarceration 
of  individuals  with  mental  illness.  The  program 
is  funded  by matching  funds  from  the state and 
counties. 

TEXAS JUDICIAL COUNCIL85TH LEGISLATIVE UPDATEStrengthening Court Security

On  the  night  of  November  6,  2015,  Travis  County  District  Judge  Julie  Kocurek  was  shot  in  her  driveway,  shortly  after 
returning  home  with  her  family  from  a  football  game.  Judge  Kocurek  was  hospitalized  for  several  months  recovering 
from injuries from the attempted assassination before she returned to the bench on February 29, 2016. One of the three 
individuals connected with the shooting had a probation revocation proceeding pending in Judge Kocurek’s court at the 
time of the shooting. While this horrible event was not the first court security incident to occur in Texas, it reminded the 
judiciary of the importance of ensuring that judges and court personnel are protected. The Legislature enacted several 
court security changes recommended by the Judicial Council in SB 42 – The Judge Julie Kocurek Judicial and Courthouse 
Security Act of 2017. The changes include:

•  Establishing a Director of Security and Emergency Preparedness at OCA;
•  Requiring municipal judges and local administrative judges to establish court security committees;
•  Certification of court security personnel;
•  Changes to statutes impacting judges’ personal security and privacy; and
•  Clarifying that law enforcement has authority to protect threatened judges when necessary. 

Improving the Guardianship System

During the 84th Legislative session, lawmakers made several improvements to the guardianship system in our state and 
the 85th Legislature continued to build on that work. With the senior population in Texas expected to triple by 2050, the 
Judicial Council made recommendations to the Legislature to protect some of our most vulnerable citizens. SB 1096 and 
SB 36 contain those recommendations. They include: 

SB 1096

SB 36 

•  Requires  all  guardians  other  than  attorneys, 
corporate  fiduciaries,  and  certified  guardians, 
to  receive  training,  undergo  a  criminal  history 
background  check  and  register  with  the  Judicial 
Branch Certification Commission (JBCC); and 
•  Authorizes the creation of a statewide guardianship 
registry available for query by law enforcement.

•  Expands Judicial Branch Certification Commission’s 
authority to regulate guardianship programs. 
•  OCA  anticipates  less  than  30  programs  will  be 

registered with the commission. 

The 85th Legislative session resulted in a number of other new laws of interest to the judiciary. The following report briefly 
summarizes new legislation directly impacting the Texas court system, judges, clerks, and other judicial actors. No attempt 
is made to cover substantive areas of the law in detail. We hope the report will be a useful resource for the judicial and 
legal community and all those interested in the administration of justice.

TEXAS JUDICIAL COUNCIL85TH LEGISLATIVE UPDATEFunding the Judiciary

The Texas Judicial Branch courts and agencies collectively submitted a total biennial budget request of $656.8 million in 
all funds, which included a 4% reduction from the 2016 – 2017 budget.  Exceptional Item requests totaled $252.7 million.  

The Conference Committee Report for Senate Bill 1 (CCR SB1) approved by the 85th Legislature appropriated a total of 
$699.5 million to the Judicial Branch courts and agencies.  This figure includes the contingency riders, excludes employee 
benefits and includes interagency contract funding.  This funding level is an additional $17.3 million or 2.5% higher than 
baseline budgets for 2016-2017.  CCR SB1 provides a total of 1,476.9 FTEs, a slight drop from the 2016-2017 levels.  The 
entire budget for the third branch of government makes up 0.4% of the state budget of Texas.

HB 1787—Effective 9/1/17 (applies to declarations executed on or after that date).

Provides that a declaration for mental health treatment may be signed by the principal and acknowledged before 
a notary public—current law requires the declaration to be signed by the principal in the presence of two or more 
subscribing witnesses. See Estates Code §§ 137.003(a), 137.011.

SB 1326—Effective 9/1/17 (applies to defendants accused of offenses committed on or after that date).

Establishes procedures to facilitate the early identification and treatment of pre-trial detainees with mental illness 
or intellectual disability:
•  Requires a sheriff or custodial agent with custody of a person suspected of a Class B or higher offense to transmit 
any information indicating the person might have a mental illness or an intellectual disability to a magistrate 
within 12 hours of receipt; requires the magistrate to evaluate the information and, upon finding reasonable 
cause  to  believe  the  suspect  has  a  mental  illness  or  an  intellectual  disability,  to  order  an  assessment  by  a 
local mental health authority, a local intellectual and developmental disability authority, or another qualified 
expert.  

•  Requires any written mental health assessment ordered by a judge to be provided to the magistrate within 96 

hours if the suspect is in custody or within 30 days if the suspect has been released. 

•  Authorizes  the  magistrate,  in  the  event  a  suspect  fails  or  refuses  to  submit  to  the  assessment  as  ordered, 
to order the person to submit to an examination in a jail or another appropriate place of confinement for a 
reasonable period not to exceed 72 hours. 

•  Requires the magistrate, upon a determination that a defendant charged with a Class B misdemeanor or higher 
is  incompetent  to  stand  trial,  to  order  the  defendant  to  participate  in  a  jail-based  competency  restoration 
program  or  to  seek  treatment  at  an  in-patient  mental  health  facility  or  residential  care  facility.  Allows  the 
magistrate to order out-patient treatment for a period of up to 60 days where the defendant is not a danger 
to others and may be safely treated in that manner.

•  Provides  that  a  magistrate  must  release  from  custody,  notwithstanding  a  locally  adopted  bond  schedule 
or other standing order, defendants not charged with a violent offense or previously convicted of a violent 
offense determined to have a mental illness or an intellectual disability if the assessment reveals appropriate 
treatment is available in the community and release will reasonably ensure the defendant’s appearance in 
court and the safety of the community and the victim of the alleged defense.

•  Allows  the  magistrate  to  use  the  results  of  the  assessment  to  refer  the  defendant  to  a  specialty  court,  as 

appropriate. 

•  Addresses the availability of prescribed medications for suspects and defendants in custody.
•  Requires  each  magistrate  to  report  the  number  of  mental  health  assessments  to  the  Office  of  Court 

Administration (OCA). 

•  Requires the specialty courts to report cases and outcomes to OCA.

of  the  charged  offense,  was  civilly  committed  as  a  violent  sex  offender.  Expands  the  scope  of  certain  criminal 
offenses  and  enhancements  to  reach  civil  commitment  facilities  and  individuals  committed  to  those  facilities. 
Makes  it  an  offense  for  any  person  to  provide  or  intend  to  provide  alcohol,  controlled  substances,  dangerous 
drugs, or deadly weapons to a person in the custody of a civil commitment facility, or to possess a deadly weapon 
while in a civil commitment facility. See Code of Crim. Proc. art. 17.03(b-1); Health & Safety Code ch. 841; Penal

TEXAS JUDICIAL COUNCIL85TH LEGISLATIVE UPDATEVetoed Legislation

HB 2783

SB 667

SB 813

SB 1444

SB 1912

The bill would have expanded the court’s discretion to award costs and reasonable attorney’s fees under the public 
information statute.

The bill would have established a statewide guardianship compliance program to provide resources and assistance 
to courts, consistent with the recommendations of the Judicial Council and the Supreme Court of Texas. SB 667 
overwhelmingly passed in the Senate and the House, but funding was removed from the budget via line-item veto, 
and the bill itself was vetoed shortly thereafter.

The bill would have created a new cause of action allowing the recovery of damages, attorney’s fees, and court 
costs from a state agency that pursued a regulatory action found frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation 
and that could not demonstrate good cause for the action.

The bill would have revised procedures governing the de novo hearing of orders rendered by an associate judge, 
requiring the referring court to give precedence to the de novo review and authorizing mandamus relief where the 
referring court failed to hold a timely de novo hearing. 

The bill would have revised certain procedures governing the civil commitment of persons with mental illness and 
intellectual disability and would have allowed the courts, with the permission of the governing commissioners 
court, to establish a mental health public defender office to provide representation.
