ARTICLE XII—MINIMUM CONTINUING LEGAL EDUCATION 

ection 4.  Accreditation 

The Committee shall develop criteria for the accreditation of continuing legal education 
activities and shall designate the number of hours to  be earned by participation in  such 
activities,  as  approved  by  the  Committee.  In  order  for  an  activity  to  be  accredited,  the 
subject  matter  must  directly  relate  to  legal  subjects  and  the  legal  profession,  including 
professional  responsibility,  legal  ethics,  or  law  practice  management.  The  Committee 
may,  in  appropriate  cases,  extend  accreditation  to  qualified  activities  that  have  already 
occurred. The Committee shall not  extend credit to  activities completed in  the ordinary 
course of the practice of law, in the performance of regular employment, as a volunteer 
service to clients or the general public, as a volunteer service to government entities, or in 
a  member’s  regular  duties  on  a  committee,  section  or  division  of  any  bar  related 
organization. The Committee may extend accredited status, subject to periodic review, to 
a  qualified  sponsor  for  its  overall  continuing  legal  education  curriculum.  No 
examinations shall be required.  

Self-study  credit  may  be  given  for  individual  viewing  or  listening  to  audio,  video,  or 
digital  media,;  reading  written  material,;  attending  organized  in-office  educational 
programs; or such other activities as may be approved by the Committee. No more than 
five  (5)  three  hours  of  credit  may  be  given  during  any  compliance  year  for  self-study 
activities. Time spent viewing or listening to audio, video, or digital media as part of an 
organized  CLE  activity  approved  by  the  Committee  counts  as  conventional  continuing 
legal education and is not subject to the self-study limitation. 

Credit  may  be  earned  through  teaching  or  participating  in  an  accredited  CLE  activity. 
Credit shall be granted for preparation time and presentation time, including preparation 
credit for repeated presentations. 

Credit  may  be  earned  through  legal  research-based  writing  upon  application  to  the 
Committee provided the activity (1) produced material published or to be published in the 
form  of  an  article,  chapter,  or  book  written,  in  whole  or  in  part,  by  the  applicant;  (2) 
contributed  substantially  to  the  continuing  legal  education  of  the  applicant  and  other 
attorneys;  and  (3)  is  not  done  in  the  ordinary  course  of  the  practice  of  law,  the 
performance of regular employment, or as a service to clients. 

The  Committee  may,  in  appropriate  cases,  charge  a  reasonable  fee  to  the  sponsor  for 
accrediting CLE activities. 

A member who holds a full-time faculty position in any law school which is approved by 
the  American  Bar  Association  may  be  credited  as  fulfilling  the  requirements  of  this 
article, except as to the minimum requirements for CLE in legal ethics and professional 
responsibility. A member who holds a part-time faculty position in any such law school

twelve (12) hours per compliance year, except as to the minimum requirements for CLE 
in legal ethics and professional responsibility. 

The  Committee  shall  grant  exemption  from  this  Article  to  any  emeritus  member  of  the 
State Bar of Texas. (Emeritus as defined by the State Bar Act, Section 81.052 (e)). 

Credit to meet the minimum educational requirement shall be extended to attorneys who 
are  members  of  the  Senate  and  House  of  Representatives  of  present  and  future  United 
States and Texas Legislatures for each regular session in which the attorney member shall 
serve. 

No  credit  shall  be  given  for  activities  directed  primarily  to  persons  preparing  for 
admission to practice law. 

Credit,  not  to  exceed  thirty  (30)  hours  in  any  compliance  year,  may  be  earned  for 
attending  a  law  school  class  after  admission  to  practice  in  Texas  provided  (1)  that  the 
member officially  registered for the class with  the law school; and (2) that the member 
completed  the  course  as  required  by  the  terms  of  registration.  Credit  for  approved 
attendance  at  law  school  classes  shall  be  for  the  actual  number  of  hours  of  class 
instruction time the member is in attendance at the law school course. 

ection 6.  Minimum Educational Requirements 

Every  member  shall  must  complete  fifteen  (15)  hours  of  continuing  legal  education 
during  each  compliance  year  as  provided  by  this  article.  No  more  than  five  (5)  three 
credit hours may be given for completion of self-study activities during any compliance 
year.
