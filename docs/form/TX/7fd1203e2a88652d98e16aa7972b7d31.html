Legislative Edition – 83rd Legislature 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 September 2013 

The 83rd regular legislative session was a big success for the judicial branch.  In addition to providing a 

substantial pay increase for district and appellate court judges, the Legislature: 
  

•  Established a new State fund known as the Statewide Electronic Filing System Fund to pay for the 

statewide e-filing program that is funded through a new civil filing fee and a new criminal court cost;  

•  Expanded the confidentiality of records of children in criminal cases in the justice and municipal 

   

courts;   

the courts; 

•  Expanded the situations in which juvenile case managers can provide services; 

•  Limited the situations in which complaints for school offenses committed by children can be filed in 

•  Created the Judicial Branch Certification Commission to license and regulate court reporters and court 

reporting firms, professional guardians, process servers, and licensed court interpreters;  

•  Prohibited courts from disclosing to the public any information contained in court records that are the 

subject of an order of nondisclosure; 

•  Created four new district courts and four new county courts at law including the first-ever multi-county 

court at law covering Fisher, Mitchell and Nolan Counties;  

•  Revised of the provisions regarding vexatious litigants; 

•  Made the amount of court costs imposed on a criminal defendant the amount established under the law 
in effect on the date of conviction instead of the date on which the offense was committed; and  

•  Required defendants to pay any unpaid fines and court costs after the expiration of a defendant’s 

period of community supervision.  
 

This report briefly summarizes new legislation impacting the Texas court system, judges, clerks, and other 

judicial actors.  No attempt is made to cover substantive areas of the law in detail; other entities are expected to 
provide legislative updates on substantive legal topics.  We hope this report will be a useful resource for the judicial 
and legal community and all those interested in the administration of justice.

See §§ 51.305, 51.317, Gov’t Code; § 118.011, Loc. Gov’t Code.  See also District and County Clerks. 

B 1755 – Effective 1/1/14.  (New fee effective 1/1/14.) 

Authorizes the appointment of a public probate administrator who would take possession of a decedent’s property 
and administer the estate when the estate has no appointed personal representative or suitable next of kin.  Requires 
the assessment of a $10 “supplemental public probate administrator fee” in counties that have appointed a public 
probate administrator when an original probate action or an adverse probate action is filed.  See  § 304.001(a) and 
Chapter 455, Estates Code; §25.00251, Gov’t Code; §§ 118.052, 118.068, Loc. Gov’t Code.  See also Probate, 
Guardianships and Mental Health.   

B 2021 – Effective 6/14/13. 

Authorizes counties and cities to contract with collection vendors for the collection of unpaid amounts related to 
civil cases.  Permits the county or city to authorize a 30% collection fee that is assessed in addition to the underlying 
unpaid amount.  The collection fee is directed entirely to the collection vendor. See § 140.009, Loc. Gov’t Code.   

B 2080 – Amends payment provisions related to guardianship proceedings and allows courts to authorize court 
costs and attorney fee payments from the county treasury.  Allows a court to require a party found to have acted in 
bad faith to reimburse a ward’s estate for court costs and attorney fees. Makes certain rules of civil procedure 
inapplicable in guardianship proceedings.  Provides for mediation of contested guardianship proceedings.  Requires 
that certain orders appointing a guardian contain a specified notice to peace officers. See §§ 1052.051, 1053.105, 
1101.151, 1101.152, 1155.151, Estates Code.  See also Probate, Guardianships and Mental Health.    

B 2302 – Effective 9/1/13.  (New Fees and Costs effective 9/1/13 except that the new $2 e-filing transaction fee 

becomes effective 1/1/14.) 
Establishes a new State fund known as the Statewide Electronic Filing System Fund. Creates a new civil filing fee 
and a new criminal court cost that are directed to the foregoing fund to primarily pay for TexFile – the  State’s new 
e-filing portal.  The new civil fee will be $20 in all courts except justice courts (in which the filing fee will be $10).  
The fee is to be charged upon the filing of a petition or other original document in a case and on the filing of certain 
other documents such as counterclaims.  The new criminal court cost will be a $5 cost assessed upon conviction of 
an offense in a district court or county-level court.  There is no new criminal court cost in the justice and municipal 
courts to support e-filing.  Also allows local governments and appellate courts to continue to assess a $2 fee on 
every e-filing transaction.  The $2 fee can only be charged if the local government or appellate court annually 
certifies to the Office of Court Administration [OCA] that the amount of the fee is necessary to recover the operating 
costs of the e-filing system.    OCA is to promulgate a form on which such a certification can be made.  Revenue 
from this $2 fee is retained by the local governments and appellate courts so they may recoup their costs associated 
with e-filing.  The authority of local governments and appellate courts to charge this $2 fee is scheduled to expire on 
September 1, 2019.  A court may waive any or all of the foregoing fees for an indigent individual.  A Title IV-D 
agency is to pay only the $2 transaction fee; a Title IV-D agency does not pay the filing fees destined for the 
Statewide Electronic Filing System Fund.   OCA is required to file a report by December 1, 2018 with the lieutenant 
governor and others detailing the number of local governments and appellate courts collecting the $2 fee and 
addressing the necessity of permitting local governments and appellate courts to continue to assess the fee. See §§ 
21.011, 51.851, 51.852, 72.031, Gov’t Code; §§ 231.202, 231.204, Fam. Code.  See also Office of Court 
Administration.  

B 3153 – Effective 9/1/13.  (New fee effective 1/1/14.) 

Creates a $25 stenographer’s fee to be collected in each civil (including probate) case in which a record of any part 
of the evidence in the case is made by the official court reporter of the 1st  Multicounty Court at Law (consisting of 
Fisher, Mitchell and Nolan Counties).  Also creates a $25 stenographer’s fee to be collected in any criminal case in 
which a record of any part of the evidence in the case is made by the official court reporter of the 1st Multicounty 
Court at Law.  See § 25.2702, Gov’t Code.

B 391 – 9/1/13. 

Clarifies that a defendant’s obligation to pay a fine and court costs is independent of any requirement to pay the fine 
and court costs as a condition of community supervision.  Accordingly, a defendant remains obligated to pay any 
unpaid fine and court costs after the expiration of a defendant’s period of community supervision. See art. 42.12, 
Section 11(b-1), Code Crim. Proc. 

B 393 – Effective 9/1/13. 

Permits judge to allow child convicted of fine-only misdemeanor to elect to perform community service or receive

performing community service would be an undue hardship. Makes largely confidential the court records of a child 
who has received deferred disposition for a fine-only misdemeanor and has satisfied the judgment and received a 
dismissal of the charges. Expands the scope of juvenile case manager services to include children referred to a court 
prior to any case being filed for conduct that would otherwise be within the court’s jurisdiction. Allows juvenile case

for filing of a criminal complaint if a child fails to comply with graduated sanctions. Permits prosecuting attorneys 
to adopt rules pertaining to the filing of such complaints.  Authorizes inclusion in first offender programs of children 
accused prior to the filing of a criminal charge of non-traffic Class C misdemeanors. Prohibits person younger than 
10 from being prosecuted for a fine-only misdemeanor or a penal ordinance of a political subdivision. Creates 
rebuttable presumption that child between the ages of 10 and 14 is incapable of committing a fine-only misdemeanor 
or of violating a penal ordinance of a political subdivision.  Creates procedure for handling cases in which child 
accused of committing a fine-only misdemeanor or violating a penal ordinance of a political subdivision may have 
mental illness or a developmental disability. Makes most disorderly conduct offenses committed on public school 
campuses during school hours inapplicable to children under 12. See arts. 42.15, 43.091, 44.2811, 45.0217, 45.041, 
45.0491, 45.056, Code Crim. Proc.; §§ 25.0915, 37.124, 37.126, 37.141, 37.143, 37.144, 37.145, 37.146, 37.147,

court costs if the child is unable to perform community service.  See arts. 42.15, 43.091, 45.041, 45.0491, Code  
Crim. Proc.  See also Juvenile Justice.

information, counseling and services related to sex addiction.  Requires courts to enter an order of nondisclosure if 
the participant successfully completes the program.  Authorizes programs to collect a program fee of up to $1,000 
from program participants. See Chapter 169A, Health & Safety Code. See also Criminal Law and Procedure;

B 2302 – Effective 9/1/13.  (New Fees and Costs effective 9/1/13 except that the new $2 e-filing transaction fee 

becomes effective 1/1/14.) 
Establishes a new State fund known as the Statewide Electronic Filing System Fund. Creates a new civil filing fee 
and a new criminal court cost that are directed to the foregoing fund to primarily pay for TexFile – the  State’s new 
e-filing portal.  The new civil fee will be $20 in all courts except justice courts (in which the filing fee will be $10).  
The fee is to be charged upon the filing of a petition or other original document in a case and on the filing of certain 
other documents such as counterclaims.  The new criminal court cost will be a $5 cost assessed upon conviction of 
an offense in a district court or county-level court.  There is no new criminal court cost in the justice and municipal 
courts to support e-filing.  Also allows local governments and appellate courts to continue to assess a $2 fee on 
every e-filing transaction.  The $2 fee can only be charged if the local government or appellate court annually 
certifies to the Office of Court Administration [OCA] that the amount of the fee is necessary to recover the operating 
costs of the e-filing system.    OCA is to promulgate a form on which such a certification can be made.  Revenue 
from this $2 fee is retained by the local governments and appellate courts so they may recoup their costs associated 
with e-filing.  The authority of local governments and appellate courts to charge this $2 fee is scheduled to expire on 
September 1, 2019.  A court may waive any or all of the foregoing fees for an indigent individual.  A Title IV-D 
agency is to pay only the $2 transaction fee; a Title IV-D agency does not pay the filing fees destined for the 
Statewide Electronic Filing System Fund.   OCA is required to file a report by December 1, 2018 with the lieutenant 
governor and others detailing the number of local governments and appellate courts collecting the $2 fee and 
addressing the necessity of permitting local governments and appellate courts to continue to assess the fee. See §§ 
21.011, 51.851, 51.852, 72.031, Gov’t Code; §§ 231.202, 231.204, Fam. Code.  See also Costs, Fees, Fines and

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
