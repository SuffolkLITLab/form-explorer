Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 
 
Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 

   

APPEAL NO.: 

16-005 Supplemental 

ESPONDENT: 

Office of Court Management – Harris County Criminal Courts 

ATE: 

 

December 6, 2016 

PECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge Stephen B. Ables, Chairman; Judge Billy Ray Stubblefield; 
Judge David Peeples; Judge Dean Rucker; Judge David L. Evans 

 

 

 

Petitioner requested from Respondent records related to actions taken by the judges of the 
Harris County Criminal Courts at Law to remove Petitioner from the list of attorneys eligible for 
appointment  under  the  Fair  Defense  Act  Plan  of  the  Harris  County  Criminal  Courts  at  Law. 
Respondent denied Petitioner’s request claiming the requested records are exempt from the Public 
Information  Act  and  are  exempt  from  disclosure  under  Rule  12.5(b)  of  the  Rules  of  Judicial 
Administration  because  they  relate  to  the  internal  deliberations  of  a  court  or  judicial  agency.  
Petitioner appealed the denial.  On April, 4, 2016, this special committee decided that it was without 
authority to issue a decision in the matter because the records at issue are not “judicial records” 
subject to Rule 12. 

Respondent has filed a Motion for Rehearing requesting that we withdraw or amend our 
decision and issue a new decision following the precedent established by Rule 12 Decision No. 08-
009 issued on February 27, 2009.   

Petitioner  has  filed  a  mandamus  proceeding  in  district  court  regarding the denial of the 
requested records and argues that we should not rule on the request for rehearing and “respondents 
should be estopped from seeking rehearing after Petitioner has relied on Respondent’s inaction by 
seeking mandamus relief.”  Petitioner also argues that we do not have the authority to rule on the 
rehearing because it is time barred.  Respondent acknowledges that Rule 12 does not provide a 
procedure for rehearing but argues that it does not preclude it. 

Respondent is correct that Rule 12 does not provide a mechanism for a respondent to appeal a 
Rule 12 decision or request a rehearing.  The only reference to post-decision relief in Rule 12 is one 
clarifying that an appeal under Rule 12 is “not exclusive and does not preclude relief by mandamus.” 
 See Rule12.9(n).  Accordingly, we conclude that we are without authority to consider a motion to 
rehear or an appeal of a Rule 12 decision.   

Though we are without authority to consider Respondent’s motion for rehearing, we feel 
compelled to address Respondent’s concern that we did not follow the precedent set by Rule 12 
Decision No. 08-009.  The records at issue in that matter were similar to those at issue in this one.  In 
that  appeal,  Petitioner  had  been  removed  from  the  list  of  attorneys  who  are  eligible  for  court

appointments  in  juvenile  felony  cases  and  had  not  been  “renewed”  for  eligibility  for  court 
appointments in felony trial cases. Petitioner was denied access to records regarding Respondent’s 
decision to remove him from the lists.  In that decision, the special committee stated that “the process 
of  reviewing  applicants  for  eligibility  on  the  court  appointment  list  is  a  judicial  administration 
matter.” 

Approximately two months after the release of Rule 12 Decision No. 08-009, the U. S. Fifth 
Circuit Court of Appeals in Davis v. Tarrant County, Texas, et al, 565 F.3rd 214 (5th Cir. 2009) found 
that “the act of selecting applicants for inclusion on a rotating list of attorneys eligible for court 
appointments is inextricably linked to and cannot be separated from the act of appointing counsel in 
a particular case.” The court also stated that these acts “involve the performance of duties which are 
intimately connected to a judge’s adjudicatory role.”  Davis, 565 F.3rd at 226.  We found the court’s 
analysis persuasive and applicable to our analysis of the nature of the records at issue in this appeal.  
Rule 12 applies to records “made or maintained by or for a court or judicial agency in its regular 
course of business but not pertaining to its adjudicative function, regardless of whether that function 
relates to a specific case.”  See Rule 12.2(d).  Based on the 5th Circuit’s analysis, we decided that the 
records at issue in this appeal were related to the judges’ adjudicative function and not subject to 
Rule 12.   
 

Respondent disagrees with our decision and argues that the definition of judicial records does 
not exclude all records related to a matter that is or has been before a court.  Rule 12.2(d) defines a 
judicial record as one that is “made or maintained by or for a court or judicial agency in its regular 
course of business but not pertaining to its adjudicative function, regardless of whether that function 
relates to a specific case.  A record of any nature created, produced, or filed in connection with any 
matter that is or has been before a court is not a judicial record.”   

espondent argues that the second sentence of the definition, “a record of any nature created, 
produced, or filed in connection with any matter that is or has been before a court is not a judicial 
record”  (emphasis  provided  by  Respondent),  excludes  only  “records that are  produced  in open 
court.” They argue that “records that are not published in court are judicial records.”  We first note 
that we need not reach this argument because our analysis ended once we concluded that the records 
were related to the judges’ adjudicative function.  Assuming we had continued our analysis, we 
disagree  with  Respondent’s  interpretation.    The  second sentence does not carve out  a group of 
records that may still be considered judicial records even if they relate to a judge’s adjudicatory 
function.  It emphasizes that any record connected to a case that is or has been before a court is 
exempt from Rule 12.  

o the extent that Rule 12 Decision No. 08-009 is inconsistent with the decision we reached 
in Rule 12 Decision No. 16-005, it is overruled.  We also note that our decision does not mean that 
the records at issue in Rule 12 Appeal No. 16-005 are subject to disclosure or are subject to the 
Public Information Act.  It means that the procedures provided in Rule 12 for responding to requests 
and appealing the denial of requests do not apply.
