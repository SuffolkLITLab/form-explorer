published  each  of  the  Proposed  Rules  in  the  Texas  Register  and  Texas  Bar
Journal within six months of initiation;

accepted  public  comments  for  at  least  30  days  and  held  one  or  more  public

will count.

The ballot must be substantively in the form attached to this Order in Exhibit 2.

3.

2) whether to accept an offer of settlement of a matter, except as otherwise authorized by 
law; 

3) In a criminal case, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered, whether 
to waive jury trial, and whether the client will testify. 

  (

  (

a) Subject to paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e), and (f), and (g), a lawyer shall abide by a client's 
decisions: 
 

(1) concerning the objectives and general methods of representation; 

b) A lawyer may limit the scope, objectives and general methods of the representation if the client 
consents after consultation. 

c) A  lawyer shall not  assist  or counsel a client to engage  in  conduct that  the lawyer knows is 
criminal or fraudulent. A lawyer may discuss the legal consequences of any proposed course of 
conduct with a client and may counsel and represent a client in connection with the making of a 
good faith effort to determine the validity, scope, meaning or application of the law. 

d) When a lawyer has confidential information clearly establishing that a client is likely to commit 
a criminal or fraudulent act that is likely to result in substantial injury to the financial interests or 
property of another, the lawyer shall promptly make reasonable efforts under the circumstances to 
dissuade the client from committing the crime or fraud. 

e) When a lawyer has confidential information clearly establishing that the lawyer's client has 
committed a criminal or fraudulent act in the commission of which the lawyer's services have been 
used, the lawyer shall make reasonable efforts under the circumstances to persuade the client to 
take corrective action. 

f)  When  a  lawyer  knows  that  a  client  expects  representation  not  permitted  by  the  rules  of 
professional conduct or other law, the lawyer shall consult with the client regarding the relevant 
limitations on the lawyer's conduct.

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 5(g) A lawyer shall take reasonable action to secure the appointment of a guardian or other legal 
representative for, or seek other protective orders with respect to, a client whenever the lawyer 
reasonably believes that the client lacks legal competence and that such action should be taken to 
protect the client. 

ule 1.16. Clients with Diminished Capacity  

a)  When  a  client’s  capacity  to  make  adequately  considered  decisions  in  connection  with  a 
representation  is  diminished,  whether  because  of  minority,  mental  impairment,  or  for  another 
reason, the lawyer shall, as far as reasonably possible, maintain a normal client-lawyer relationship 
with the client.  

b)  When  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  that  the  client  has  diminished  capacity,  is  at  risk  of 
substantial physical, financial, or other harm unless action is taken, and cannot adequately act in 
the client’s own interest, the lawyer may take reasonably necessary protective action. Such action 
may include, but is not limited to, consulting with individuals or entities that have the ability to 
take action to protect the client and, in appropriate cases, seeking the appointment of a guardian 
ad litem, attorney ad litem, amicus attorney, or conservator, or submitting an information letter to 
a court with jurisdiction to initiate guardianship proceedings for the client.  

c) When taking protective action pursuant to (b), the lawyer may disclose the client’s confidential 
information  to  the  extent  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  is  necessary  to  protect  the  client’s 
interests.

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 8Conflict of Interest Exceptions for Nonprofit and  
Limited Pro Bono Legal Services 

Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct 

ule 6.05. Conflict of Interest Exceptions for Nonprofit and Limited Pro Bono Legal Services 

a)  The  conflicts  of  interest  limitations  on  representation  in  Rules  1.06,  1.07,  and  1.09  do  not 
prohibit a lawyer from providing, or offering to provide, limited pro bono legal services unless the 
lawyer knows, at the time the services are provided, that the lawyer would be prohibited by those 
limitations from providing the services. 

b)  Lawyers  in  a  firm  with  a  lawyer  providing,  or  offering  to  provide,  limited  pro  bono  legal 
services shall not be prohibited by the imputation provisions of Rules 1.06, 1.07, and 1.09 from 
representing a client if that lawyer does not: 
 

(1) disclose confidential information of the pro bono client to the lawyers in the firm; or 

(2) maintain such information in a manner that would render it accessible to the lawyers in 
the firm. 

c) The eligibility information that an applicant is required to provide when applying for free legal 
services or limited pro bono legal services from a program described in subparagraph (d)(1) by 
itself will not create a conflict of interest if: 
 

(1) the eligibility information is not material to the legal matter; or 

(2)  the  applicant’s  provision  of  the  eligibility  information  was  conditioned  on  the 
applicant’s informed consent that providing this information would not by itself prohibit a 
representation of another client adverse to the applicant. 

d) As used in this Rule, “limited pro bono legal services” means legal services that are: 

(1)  provided  through  a  pro  bono  or  assisted  pro  se  program  sponsored  by  a  court,  bar 
association, accredited law school, or nonprofit legal services program; 

(2) short-term services such as legal advice or other brief assistance with pro se documents 
or  transactions,  provided  either  in  person  or  by  phone,  hotline,  internet,  or  video 
conferencing; and 

(3) provided without any expectation of extended representation of the limited assistance 
client or of receiving any legal fees in that matter. 

e) As used in this Rule, a lawyer is not “in a firm” with other lawyers solely because the lawyer 
provides limited pro bono legal services with the other lawyers.

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 9Information About Legal Services (Lawyer Advertising and Solicitation) 

Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct 

VII. INFORMATION ABOUT LEGAL SERVICES 

ule 7.01. Communications Concerning a Lawyer’s Services Firm Names and Letterhead 

a)  A  lawyer  shall  not  make  or  sponsor  a  false  or  misleading  communication  about  the 
qualifications or services of a lawyer or law firm. Information about legal services must be truthful 
and  nondeceptive.  A  communication  is  false  or  misleading  if  it  contains  a  material 
misrepresentation of fact or law, or omits a fact necessary to make the statement considered as a 
whole not materially misleading. A statement is misleading if there is a substantial likelihood that 
it will lead a reasonable person to formulate a specific conclusion about the lawyer or the lawyer’s 
services for which there is no reasonable factual foundation, or if the statement is substantially 
likely to create unjustified expectations about the results the lawyer can achieve. 

1) An “advertisement” is a communication substantially motivated by pecuniary gain that 
is made by or on behalf of a lawyer to members of the public in general, which offers or 
promotes  legal  services  under  circumstances  where  the  lawyer  neither  knows  nor 
reasonably should know that the recipients need legal services in particular matters. 

2)  A  “solicitation  communication”  is  a  communication  substantially  motivated  by 
pecuniary gain that is made by or on behalf of a lawyer to a specific person who has not 
sought the lawyer’s advice or services, which reasonably can be understood as offering to 
provide legal services that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know the person needs 
in a particular matter.   

  (

  (

b) This Rule governs all communications about a lawyer’s services, including advertisements and 
solicitation communications. For purposes of Rules 7.01 to 7.06: 

c) Lawyers may practice law under a trade name that is not false or misleading. A law firm name 
may include the names of current members of the firm and of deceased or retired members of the 
firm, or of a predecessor firm, if there has been a succession in the firm identity. The name of a 
lawyer holding a public office shall not be used in the name of a law firm, or in communications 
on  its  behalf,  during  any  substantial  period  in  which  the  lawyer  is  not  actively  and  regularly 
practicing with the firm. A law firm with an office in more than one jurisdiction may use the same 
name or other professional designation in each jurisdiction, but identification of the lawyers in an 
office of the firm shall indicate the jurisdictional limitations on those not licensed to practice in 
the jurisdiction where the office is located. 

d)  A  statement  or  disclaimer  required  by  these  Rules  shall  be  sufficiently  clear  that  it  can 
reasonably  be  understood  by  an  ordinary  person  and  made  in  each  language  used  in  the 
communication. A statement that a language is spoken or understood does not require a statement 
or disclaimer in that language.

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 10(e) A lawyer shall not state or imply that the lawyer can achieve results in the representation by 
unlawful use of violence or means that violate these Rules or other law. 

f) A lawyer may state or imply that the lawyer practices in a partnership or other business entity 
only when that is accurate. 

g) If a lawyer who advertises the amount of a verdict secured on behalf of a client knows that the 
verdict was later reduced or reversed, or that the case was settled for a lesser amount, the lawyer 
must state in each advertisement of the verdict, with equal or greater prominence, the amount of 
money that was ultimately received by the client. 

a) A lawyer in private practice shall not practice under a trade name, a name that is misleading as 
to the identity of the lawyer or lawyers practicing under such name, or a firm name containing 
names  other  than  those  of  one  or  more  of  the  lawyers  in  the  firm,  except  that  the  names  of  a 
professional  corporation,  professional  association,  limited  liability  partnership,  or  professional 
limited liability company may contain “P.C.,” “L.L.P.,” “P.L.L.C.,” or similar symbols indicating 
the nature of the organization, and if otherwise lawful a firm may use as, or continue to include in, 
its  name  the  name  or  names  of  one  or  more  deceased  or  retired  members  of  the  firm  or  of  a 
predecessor firm in a continuing line of succession. Nothing herein shall prohibit a married woman 
from practicing under her maiden name. 

b) A firm with offices in more than one jurisdiction may use the same name in each jurisdiction, 
but identification of the lawyers in an office of the firm shall indicate the jurisdictional limitations 
on those not licensed to practice in the jurisdiction where the office is located. 

c) The name of a lawyer occupying a judicial, legislative, or public executive or administrative 
position shall not be used in the name of a firm, or in communications on its behalf, during any 
substantial period in which the lawyer is not actively and regularly practicing with the firm. 

d) A lawyer shall not hold himself or herself out as being a partner, shareholder, or associate with 
one or more other lawyers unless they are in fact partners, shareholders, or associates. 

e)  A  lawyer  shall  not  advertise  in  the  public  media  or  seek  professional  employment  by  any 
communication under a trade or fictitious name, except that a lawyer who practices under a firm 
name  as  authorized  by  paragraph  (a)  of  this  Rule  may  use  that  name  in  such  advertisement  or 
communication  but  only  if  that  name  is  the  firm  name  that  appears  on  the  lawyer's  letterhead, 
business cards, office sign, fee contracts, and with the lawyer's signature on pleadings and other 
legal documents. 

f) A lawyer shall not use a firm name, letterhead, or other professional designation that violates 
Rule 7.02(a). 

ule 7.02. Advertisements Communications Concerning a Lawyer's Services 

a) An advertisement of legal services shall publish the name of a lawyer who is responsible for 
the content of the advertisement and identify the lawyer’s primary practice location.

of Legal Specialization in the area so advertised, may state with respect to each such area, 
“Board Certified, area of specialization -- Texas Board of Legal Specialization”; and 

2)  a  lawyer  who  is  a  member  of  an  organization  the  name  of  which  implies  that  its 
members  possess  special  competence,  or  who  has  been  certified  or  designated  by  an 
organization  as  possessing  special  competence  in  a  field  of  practice,  may  include  a 
factually accurate, non-misleading statement of such membership or certification, but only 
if that organization has been accredited by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization as a 
bona fide organization that admits to membership or grants certification only on the basis 
of  published  criteria  which  the  Texas  Board  of  Legal  Specialization  has  established  as 
required for such certification.

d) A lawyer who advertises a specific fee or range of fees for an identified service shall conform 
to the advertised fee or range of fees for the period during which the advertisement is reasonably 
expected to be in circulation or otherwise expected to be effective in attracting clients, unless the

advertised fee or range of fees for a period of more than one year after the date of publication, 
unless the lawyer has expressly promised to do so. 

a)  A  lawyer  shall  not  make  or  sponsor  a  false  or  misleading  communication  about  the

(1) contains a material misrepresentation of fact or law, or omits a fact necessary to make 
the statement considered as a whole not materially misleading; 

(2)  contains  any  reference  in  a  public  media  advertisement  to  past  successes  or  results 
obtained unless 

(i) the communicating lawyer or member of the law firm served as lead counsel in

(iv) if the gross amount received is stated, the attorney's fees and litigation expenses 
withheld from the amount are stated as well; 

(3) is likely to create an unjustified expectation about results the lawyer can achieve, or

grounds any tribunal, legislative body, or public official;  

(6) designates one or more specific areas of practice in an advertisement in the public media 
or in a solicitation communication unless the advertising or soliciting lawyer is competent 
to handle legal matters in each such area of practice; or 

(7) uses an actor or model to portray a client of the lawyer or law firm. 

b)  Rule  7.02(a)(6)  does  not  require  that  a  lawyer  be  certified  by  the  Texas  Board  of  Legal 
Specialization at the time of advertising in a specific area of practice, but such certification shall 
conclusively establish that such lawyer satisfies the requirements of Rule 7.02(a)(6) with respect 
to the area(s) of practice in which such lawyer is certified. 

c) A lawyer shall not advertise in the public media or state in a solicitation communication that 
the lawyer is a specialist except as permitted under Rule 7.04. 

d) Any statement or disclaimer required by these rules shall be made in each language used in the

understood shall not alone result in the need for a statement or disclaimer in that language.

to practice law for soliciting or referring prospective clients for professional employment, except 
nominal  gifts  given  as  an  expression  of  appreciation  that  are  neither  intended  nor  reasonably 
expected to be a form of compensation for recommending a lawyer’s services.

public relations services or the usual charges of a lawyer referral service that meets the 
requirements of Texas law.

give, or advance anything of value to a prospective client, other than actual litigation expenses and 
other  financial  assistance  permitted  by  Rule  1.08(d),  or  ordinary  social  hospitality  of  nominal 
value.

as  defined  in  paragraph  (f)  seek  professional  employment  concerning  a  matter  arising  out  of  a

nonclient who has not sought the lawyer's advice regarding employment or with whom the lawyer 
has  no  family  or  past  or  present  attorney-client  relationship  when  a  significant  motive  for  the 
lawyer's doing so is the lawyer's pecuniary gain. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, 
a lawyer for a qualified nonprofit organization may communicate with the organization's members 
for the purpose of educating the members to understand the law, to recognize legal problems, to 
make intelligent selection of counsel, or to use legal services. In those situations where in-person 
or telephone or other electronic contact is permitted by this paragraph, a lawyer shall not have such 
a contact with a prospective client if: 
 

(1) the communication involves coercion, duress, fraud, overreaching, intimidation, undue 
influence, or harassment;

(3)  the  communication  contains  a  false,  fraudulent,  misleading,  deceptive,  or  unfair

Rule 1.04(f) or by paragraph (b) of this Rule. 

d) A lawyer shall not enter into an agreement for, charge for, or collect a fee for professional 
employment obtained in violation of Rule 7.03(a), (b), or (c).

lawyer knows or reasonably believes that the lawyer referral service meets the requirements of 
Occupational Code Title 5, Subtitle B, Chapter 952. 

f) As used in paragraph (a), “regulated telephone or other electronic contact” means any electronic 
communication initiated by a lawyer or by any person acting on behalf of a lawyer or law firm that 
will  result  in  the  person  contacted  communicating  in  a  live,  interactive  manner  with  any  other

will consist of a proposed text, production script, or other description, including details about the 
illustrations, actions, events, scenes, and background sounds that will be depicted. A finding of 
noncompliance by the Advertising Review Committee is not binding in a disciplinary proceeding 
or action, but a finding of compliance is binding in favor of the submitting lawyer as to all materials 
submitted  for  pre-approval  if  the  lawyer  fairly  and  accurately  described  the  advertisement  or 
solicitation  communication  that  was  later  produced.  A  finding  of  compliance  is  admissible

whose firm's services are being advertised, or who narrates an advertisement as if he or she were 
such a lawyer, shall be one or more of the lawyers whose services are being advertised.  

h) If an advertisement in the public media by a lawyer or firm discloses the willingness or potential 
willingness of the lawyer or firm to render services on a contingent fee basis, the advertisement 
must state whether the client will be obligated to pay all or any portion of the court costs and, if a 
client may be liable for other expenses, this fact must be disclosed. If specific percentage fees or

Federal Court or Federal Agency Discipline 

Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct 

ule 8.03. Reporting Professional Misconduct 

A  lawyer  who  has  been  disciplined  by  the  attorney-regulatory  agency  of  another 
jurisdiction,  or  by  a  federal  court  or  federal  agency,  must  notify  the  chief  disciplinary 
counsel within 30 days of the date of the order or judgment. The notice must include a copy 
of the order or judgment. For purposes of this paragraph, “discipline” by a federal court or 
federal agency means a public reprimand,  suspension, or  disbarment;  the  term does not 
include a letter of “warning” or “admonishment” or a similar advisory by a federal court 
or federal agency. 

Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure

“Professional Misconduct” includes: 

Attorney conduct that occurs in another state or in the District of Columbia

jurisdiction, including before any federal court or federal agency, and results in the 
disciplining of an attorney in that other jurisdiction, if the conduct is Professional 
Misconduct under the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct. 

.01.  Orders  From  Other  Jurisdictions:  Upon  receipt  of  information  indicating  that  an 
attorney licensed to practice law in Texas has been disciplined in another jurisdiction, including 
by  any  federal  court  or  federal  agency,  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  shall  diligently  seek  to 
obtain a certified copy of the order or judgment of discipline from the other jurisdiction, and file 
it  with  the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals  along  with  a  petition  requesting  that the attorney  be 
disciplined  in  Texas.  A  certified  copy  of  the  order  or  judgment  is  prima  facie  evidence  of  the 
matters contained therein, and a final adjudication in another jurisdiction that an attorney licensed 
to practice law in Texas has committed Professional Misconduct is conclusive for the purposes of 
a Disciplinary Action under this Part, subject to the defenses set forth in Rule 9.04 below. For 
purposes of this Part, “discipline” by a federal court or federal agency means a public reprimand,

a)  When  a  client’s  capacity  to  make  adequately  considered  decisions  in  connection  with  a 
representation  is  diminished,  whether  because  of  minority,  mental  impairment,  or  for  another 
reason, the lawyer shall, as far as reasonably possible, maintain a normal client-lawyer relationship

the client’s own interest, the lawyer may take reasonably necessary protective action. Such action 
may include, but is not limited to, consulting with individuals or entities that have the ability to 
take action to protect the client and, in appropriate cases, seeking the appointment of a guardian

Limited Pro Bono Legal Services 

Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct 

ule 6.05. Conflict of Interest Exceptions for Nonprofit and Limited Pro Bono Legal Services 

a)  The  conflicts  of  interest  limitations  on  representation  in  Rules  1.06,  1.07,  and  1.09  do  not 
prohibit a lawyer from providing, or offering to provide, limited pro bono legal services unless the 
lawyer knows, at the time the services are provided, that the lawyer would be prohibited by those 
limitations from providing the services. 

b)  Lawyers  in  a  firm  with  a  lawyer  providing,  or  offering  to  provide,  limited  pro  bono  legal 
services shall not be prohibited by the imputation provisions of Rules 1.06, 1.07, and 1.09 from 
representing a client if that lawyer does not: 
 

(1) disclose confidential information of the pro bono client to the lawyers in the firm; or 

(2) maintain such information in a manner that would render it accessible to the lawyers in 
the firm. 

c) The eligibility information that an applicant is required to provide when applying for free legal 
services or limited pro bono legal services from a program described in subparagraph (d)(1) by 
itself will not create a conflict of interest if: 
 

(1) the eligibility information is not material to the legal matter; or 

(2)  the  applicant’s  provision  of  the  eligibility  information  was  conditioned  on  the 
applicant’s informed consent that providing this information would not by itself prohibit a 
representation of another client adverse to the applicant. 

d) As used in this Rule, “limited pro bono legal services” means legal services that are: 

(1)  provided  through  a  pro  bono  or  assisted  pro  se  program  sponsored  by  a  court,  bar 
association, accredited law school, or nonprofit legal services program; 

(2) short-term services such as legal advice or other brief assistance with pro se documents 
or  transactions,  provided  either  in  person  or  by  phone,  hotline,  internet,  or  video 
conferencing; and 

(3) provided without any expectation of extended representation of the limited assistance 
client or of receiving any legal fees in that matter. 

e) As used in this Rule, a lawyer is not “in a firm” with other lawyers solely because the lawyer 
provides limited pro bono legal services with the other lawyers.

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 39Information About Legal Services (Lawyer Advertising and Solicitation) 

Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct 

VII. INFORMATION ABOUT LEGAL SERVICES 

a)  A  lawyer  shall  not  make  or  sponsor  a  false  or  misleading  communication  about  the 
qualifications or services of a lawyer or law firm. Information about legal services must be truthful 
and  nondeceptive.  A  communication  is  false  or  misleading  if  it  contains  a  material 
misrepresentation of fact or law, or omits a fact necessary to make the statement considered as a 
whole not materially misleading. A statement is misleading if there is a substantial likelihood that 
it will lead a reasonable person to formulate a specific conclusion about the lawyer or the lawyer’s 
services for which there is no reasonable factual foundation, or if the statement is substantially 
likely to create unjustified expectations about the results the lawyer can achieve. 

1) An “advertisement” is a communication substantially motivated by pecuniary gain that 
is made by or on behalf of a lawyer to members of the public in general, which offers or 
promotes  legal  services  under  circumstances  where  the  lawyer  neither  knows  nor 
reasonably should know that the recipients need legal services in particular matters. 

2)  A  “solicitation  communication”  is  a  communication  substantially  motivated  by 
pecuniary gain that is made by or on behalf of a lawyer to a specific person who has not 
sought the lawyer’s advice or services, which reasonably can be understood as offering to 
provide legal services that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know the person needs 
in a particular matter.   

  (

  (

b) This Rule governs all communications about a lawyer’s services, including advertisements and 
solicitation communications. For purposes of Rules 7.01 to 7.06: 

c) Lawyers may practice law under a trade name that is not false or misleading. A law firm name 
may include the names of current members of the firm and of deceased or retired members of the 
firm, or of a predecessor firm, if there has been a succession in the firm identity. The name of a 
lawyer holding a public office shall not be used in the name of a law firm, or in communications 
on  its  behalf,  during  any  substantial  period  in  which  the  lawyer  is  not  actively  and  regularly 
practicing with the firm. A law firm with an office in more than one jurisdiction may use the same 
name or other professional designation in each jurisdiction, but identification of the lawyers in an 
office of the firm shall indicate the jurisdictional limitations on those not licensed to practice in 
the jurisdiction where the office is located. 

d)  A  statement  or  disclaimer  required  by  these  Rules  shall  be  sufficiently  clear  that  it  can 
reasonably  be  understood  by  an  ordinary  person  and  made  in  each  language  used  in  the 
communication. A statement that a language is spoken or understood does not require a statement 
or disclaimer in that language.

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 40(e) A lawyer shall not state or imply that the lawyer can achieve results in the representation by 
unlawful use of violence or means that violate these Rules or other law. 

f) A lawyer may state or imply that the lawyer practices in a partnership or other business entity 
only when that is accurate. 

g) If a lawyer who advertises the amount of a verdict secured on behalf of a client knows that the 
verdict was later reduced or reversed, or that the case was settled for a lesser amount, the lawyer 
must state in each advertisement of the verdict, with equal or greater prominence, the amount of 
money that was ultimately received by the client. 

a) An advertisement of legal services shall publish the name of a lawyer who is responsible for 
the content of the advertisement and identify the lawyer’s primary practice location. 

1) a lawyer who has been awarded a Certificate of Special Competence by the Texas Board 
of Legal Specialization in the area so advertised, may state with respect to each such area, 
“Board Certified, area of specialization -- Texas Board of Legal Specialization”; and 

2)  a  lawyer  who  is  a  member  of  an  organization  the  name  of  which  implies  that  its 
members  possess  special  competence,  or  who  has  been  certified  or  designated  by  an 
organization  as  possessing  special  competence  in  a  field  of  practice,  may  include  a 
factually accurate, non-misleading statement of such membership or certification, but only 
if that organization has been accredited by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization as a 
bona fide organization that admits to membership or grants certification only on the basis 
of  published  criteria  which  the  Texas  Board  of  Legal  Specialization  has  established  as 
required for such certification. 

  (

  (

b)  A  lawyer  who  advertises  may  communicate  that  the  lawyer  does  or  does  not  practice  in 
particular  fields  of  law,  but  shall  not  include  a  statement  that  the  lawyer  has  been  certified  or 
designated by an organization as possessing special competence or a statement that the lawyer is 
a  member  of  an  organization  the  name  of  which  implies  that  its  members  possess  special 
competence, except that: 

c) If an advertisement by a lawyer discloses a willingness to render services on a contingent fee 
basis, the advertisement must state whether the client will be obligated to pay for other expenses, 
such as the costs of litigation. 

d) A lawyer who advertises a specific fee or range of fees for an identified service shall conform 
to the advertised fee or range of fees for the period during which the advertisement is reasonably 
expected to be in circulation or otherwise expected to be effective in attracting clients, unless the 
advertisement  specifies  a  shorter  period.  However,  a  lawyer  is  not  bound  to  conform  to  the 
advertised fee or range of fees for a period of more than one year after the date of publication, 
unless the lawyer has expressly promised to do so.

public relations services or the usual charges of a lawyer referral service that meets the 
requirements of Texas law. 

2) A lawyer may refer clients to another lawyer or a nonlawyer professional pursuant to 
an agreement not otherwise prohibited under these Rules that provides for the other person 
to refer clients or customers to the lawyer, if:

Federal Court or Federal Agency Discipline 

Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct 

ule 8.03. Reporting Professional Misconduct 

A  lawyer  who  has  been  disciplined  by  the  attorney-regulatory  agency  of  another 
jurisdiction,  or  by  a  federal  court  or  federal  agency,  must  notify  the  chief  disciplinary 
counsel within 30 days of the date of the order or judgment. The notice must include a copy 
of the order or judgment. For purposes of this paragraph, “discipline” by a federal court or 
federal agency means a public reprimand, suspension,  or  disbarment; the  term does not 
include a letter of “warning” or “admonishment” or a similar advisory by a federal court 
or federal agency. 

Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure 

.06.  Definitions: 

CC. 

“Professional Misconduct” includes: 

Attorney conduct that occurs in another jurisdiction, including before any 
2. 
federal court or federal agency, and results in the disciplining of an attorney in that 
other  jurisdiction,  if  the  conduct  is  Professional  Misconduct  under  the  Texas 
Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct. 

.01.  Orders  From  Other  Jurisdictions:  Upon  receipt  of  information  indicating  that  an 
attorney licensed to practice law in Texas has been disciplined in another jurisdiction, including 
by  any  federal  court  or  federal  agency,  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  shall  diligently  seek  to 
obtain a certified copy of the order or judgment of discipline from the other jurisdiction, and file 
it  with  the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals  along  with  a  petition  requesting  that the  attorney  be 
disciplined  in  Texas.  A  certified  copy  of  the  order  or  judgment  is  prima  facie  evidence  of  the 
matters contained therein, and a final adjudication in another jurisdiction that an attorney licensed 
to practice law in Texas has committed Professional Misconduct is conclusive for the purposes of 
a Disciplinary Action under this Part, subject to the defenses set forth in Rule 9.04 below. For 
purposes of this Part, “discipline” by a federal court or federal agency means a public reprimand,

region  shall  be  under  Chapter  74,  Government  Code.  The  Presiding  Judge  shall 
transmit a copy of the Presiding Judge’s assignment order to the Chief Disciplinary 
Counsel. Should the judge so assigned be unable to fulfill the assignment, he or she 
shall immediately notify the Presiding Judge, and the Presiding Judge shall assign 
a  replacement  judge  whose  district  does  not  include  the  county  of  appropriate 
venue.  A  judge  assigned  under  this  Rule  shall  be  subject  to  recusal  or

this state. The motion seeking recusal or motion to disqualify must be filed by either 
party within the time provided by Rule 18a, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. In the 
event of recusal or disqualification, the Presiding Judge shall assign a replacement 
judge whose district does not include the county of appropriate venue. If an active 
district judge assigned to a disciplinary case becomes a retired, senior, or former 
judge, he or she may be assigned by the Presiding Judge to continue to preside in 
the case, provided the judge has been placed on a visiting judge list. If the Presiding 
Judge decides not to assign the retired, senior, or former judge to continue to preside 
in the case, the Presiding Judge shall assign an active district judge whose district 
does  not  include  the  county  of  appropriate  venue.  A  visiting judge  may only  be 
assigned if he or she was originally assigned to preside in the case while an active 
judge. Any judge assigned under this Rule is not subject to objection under Chapter 
74, Government Code. 

B.  

Transfer of Case: If the county of alleged venue is successfully challenged, the case 
shall be transferred to the county of proper venue. If the case is transferred to a 
county in the assigned judge’s district, the judge must recuse himself or herself, 
unless  the  parties  waive  the  recusal  on  the  record.  In  the  event  of  recusal,  the 
Presiding  Judge  of  the  administrative  judicial  region  shall  assign  a  replacement 
judge whose district does not include the county of appropriate venue. If the case 
is transferred to a county outside the administrative judicial region of the Presiding 
Judge who made the assignment, the Presiding Judge of the administrative judicial 
region where the case is transferred shall oversee assignment for the case and the 
previously  assigned  judge  shall  continue  to  preside  in  the  case  unless  he  or  she 
makes a good cause objection to continued assignment, in which case the Presiding 
Judge shall assign a replacement judge whose district does not include the county 
of appropriate venue. 

.03.  Filing, Service and Venue: After the trial judge has been assigned, the Chief Disciplinary 
Counsel  shall  promptly  file  the  Disciplinary  Petition  and  a  copy  of  the  Presiding  Judge’s 
assignment order with the district clerk of the county of alleged venue. The Respondent shall then 
be served as in civil cases generally with a copy of the Disciplinary Petition and a copy of the 
Presiding  Judge’s  assignment  order.  In  a  Disciplinary  Action,  venue  shall  be  in  the  county  of 
Respondent's principal place of practice; or if the Respondent does not maintain a place of practice 
within the State of Texas, in the county of Respondent's residence; or if the Respondent maintains 
neither a residence nor a place of practice within the State of Texas, then in the county where the 
alleged Professional Misconduct occurred, in whole or in part. In all other instances, venue is in 
Travis County, Texas.

Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure 

Scope and Objectives of Representation; Clients with Diminished Capacity 

Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct 

Rule 1.02. Scope and Objectives of Representation 

(a) Subject to paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e), and (f), and (g), a lawyer shall abide by a client's
decisions:

(1) concerning the objectives and general methods of representation;

(2) whether to accept an offer of settlement of a matter, except as otherwise authorized by
law;

(3) In a criminal case, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered, whether
to waive jury trial, and whether the client will testify.

(b) A lawyer may limit the scope, objectives and general methods of the representation if the client
consents after consultation.

(c) A  lawyer shall not assist or counsel  a  client  to engage  in conduct that  the lawyer  knows is
criminal or fraudulent. A lawyer may discuss the legal consequences of any proposed course of
conduct with a client and may counsel and represent a client in connection with the making of a
good faith effort to determine the validity, scope, meaning or application of the law.

(d) When a lawyer has confidential information clearly establishing that a client is likely to commit
a criminal or fraudulent act that is likely to result in substantial injury to the financial interests or
property of another, the lawyer shall promptly make reasonable efforts under the circumstances to
dissuade the client from committing the crime or fraud.

(e) When a lawyer has confidential information clearly establishing that the lawyer's client has
committed a criminal or fraudulent act in the commission of which the lawyer's services have been
used, the lawyer shall make reasonable efforts under the circumstances to persuade the client to
take corrective action.

(f) When  a  lawyer  knows  that  a  client  expects  representation  not  permitted  by  the  rules  of
professional conduct or other law, the lawyer shall consult with the client regarding the relevant
limitations on the lawyer's conduct.

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 61(g) A lawyer shall take reasonable action to secure the appointment of a guardian or other legal 
representative for, or seek other protective orders with respect to, a client whenever the lawyer 
reasonably believes that the client lacks legal competence and that such action should be taken to 
protect the client. 

2. Paragraph (a) assumes that the lawyer is legally authorized to represent the client. The usual 
attorney-client relationship is established and maintained by  consenting adults who possess the 
legal capacity to agree to the relationship. Sometimes the relationship can be established only by 
a legally effective appointment of the lawyer to represent a person. Unless the lawyer is legally 
authorized to act for a person under a disability, an attorney-client relationship does not exist for 
the purpose of this rule. 

3. If a legal representative has already been appointed for the client, the lawyer should ordinarily 
look to the representative for decisions on behalf of the client. If a legal representative has not been 
appointed,  paragraph  (g)  requires  a  lawyer  in  some  situations  to  take  protective  steps,  such  as 
initiating the appointment of a guardian. The lawyer should see to such appointment or take other 
protective steps when it reasonably appears advisable to do so in order to serve the client's best 
interests. See Rule 1.05(c)(4), d(1) and (d)(2)(i) in regard to the lawyer's right to reveal to the court 
the facts reasonably necessary to secure the guardianship or other protective order. 

ule 1.16. Clients with Diminished Capacity  

a)  When  a  client’s  capacity  to  make  adequately  considered  decisions  in  connection  with  a 
representation  is  diminished,  whether  because  of  minority,  mental  impairment,  or  for  another 
reason, the lawyer shall, as far as reasonably possible, maintain a normal client-lawyer relationship 
with the client.  

b)  When  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  that  the  client  has  diminished  capacity,  is  at  risk  of 
substantial physical, financial, or other harm unless action is taken, and cannot adequately act in 
the client’s own interest, the lawyer may take reasonably necessary protective action. Such action 
may include, but is not limited to, consulting with individuals or entities that have the ability to 
take action to protect the client and, in appropriate cases, seeking the appointment of a guardian 
ad litem, attorney ad litem, amicus attorney, or conservator, or submitting an information letter to 
a court with jurisdiction to initiate guardianship proceedings for the client.  

c) When taking protective action pursuant to (b), the lawyer may disclose the client’s confidential 
information  to  the  extent  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  is  necessary  to  protect  the  client’s 
interests.

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 62. The normal client-lawyer relationship is based on the assumption that the client, when properly 
advised  and  assisted,  is  capable  of  making  decisions  about  important  matters.  However, 
maintaining the ordinary client-lawyer  relationship may not be possible when the client suffers 
from a mental impairment, is a minor, or for some other reason has a diminished capacity to make 
adequately considered decisions regarding representation. In particular, a severely incapacitated 
person  may  have  no  power  to  make  legally  binding  decisions.  Nevertheless,  a  client  with 
diminished  capacity  often  can  understand,  deliberate  on,  and  reach  conclusions  about  matters 
affecting the client's own well-being. For example, some people of advanced age are capable of 
handling routine financial matters but need special legal protection concerning major transactions. 
Also,  some  children  are  regarded  as  having  opinions  entitled  to  weight  in  legal  proceedings 
concerning their custody. 

2. In determining the extent of the client's diminished capacity, the lawyer should consider and 
balance such factors as the client's ability to articulate reasoning leading to a decision, variability 
of state of mind, and ability to appreciate consequences of a decision; the substantive fairness of a 
decision; and the consistency of a decision with the lawyer's knowledge of the client's long-term 
commitments and values. 

3. The fact that a client suffers from diminished capacity does not diminish the lawyer's obligation 
to  treat  the  client  with  attention  and  respect.  Even  if  the  client  has  a  guardian  or  other  legal 
representative, the lawyer should, as far as possible, accord the client the normal status of a client, 
particularly in maintaining communication.  If a guardian or other legal representative has been 
appointed  for  the  client,  however,  the  law  may  require  the  client's  lawyer  to  look  to  the 
representative for decisions on the client's behalf. If the lawyer represents the guardian as distinct 
from the ward and is aware that the guardian is acting adversely to the ward's interest, the lawyer 
may have an obligation to prevent or rectify the guardian's misconduct. 

4. The client may wish to have family members or other persons participate in discussions with 
the lawyer; however, paragraph (a) requires the lawyer to keep the client's interests foremost and, 
except when taking protective action authorized by paragraph (b), to look to the client, not the 
family members or other persons, to make decisions on the client's behalf. In matters involving a 
minor, whether the lawyer should look to the parents as natural guardians may depend on the type 
of proceeding or matter in which the lawyer is representing the minor. 

 

 

 

 

Taking Protective Action 

.  Paragraph  (b)  contains  a  non-exhaustive  list  of  actions  a  lawyer  may  take  in  certain 
circumstances to protect a client who does not have a guardian or other legal representative. Such 
actions could include consulting with family members, using a reconsideration period to permit 
clarification or improvement of circumstances, using voluntary surrogate decision-making tools 
such  as  existing  durable  powers  of  attorney,  or  consulting  with  support  groups,  professional 
services, adult-protective agencies, or other individuals or entities that have the ability to protect 
the  client.  In  taking  any  protective  action,  the  lawyer  should  be  guided  by  such  factors  as  the 
client's wishes and values to the extent known, the client's best interests, and the goals of intruding 

  1

  5

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 63into  the  client's  decision-making  autonomy  to  the  least  extent  feasible,  maximizing  client 
capacities, and respecting the client's family and social connections. 

6. A client with diminished capacity also may cause or threaten physical, financial, or other harm 
to third parties. In such situations, the client's lawyer should consult applicable law to determine 
the appropriate response. 

7.  When  a  legal  representative  has  not  been  appointed,  the  lawyer  should  consider  whether  an 
appointment is reasonably necessary to protect the client's interests. Thus, for example, if a client 
with  diminished  capacity  has  substantial  property  that  should  be  sold  for  the  client's  benefit, 
effective  completion  of  the  transaction  may  require  appointment  of  a  legal  representative.  In 
addition,  applicable  law  provides  for  the  appointment  of  legal  representatives  in  certain 
circumstances. For example, the Texas Family Code prescribes when a guardian ad litem, attorney 
ad litem, or amicus attorney should be appointed in a suit affecting the parent-child relationship, 
and the Texas Probate Code prescribes when a guardian should be appointed for an incapacitated 
person.  In  many  circumstances,  however,  appointment  of  a  legal  representative  may  be  more 
expensive  or  traumatic  for  the  client  than  circumstances  in  fact  require.  Evaluation  of  such 
circumstances  is  a  matter  entrusted  to  the  lawyer's  professional  judgment.  In  considering 
alternatives, the lawyer should be aware of any law that requires the lawyer to advocate on the 
client's behalf for the action that imposes the least restriction. 

. Disclosure of the client's diminished capacity could adversely affect the client's interests. For 
example,  raising  the  question  of  diminished  capacity  could,  in  some  circumstances,  lead  to 
proceedings  for  involuntary  commitment.  As  with  any  client-lawyer  relationship,  information 
relating to the representation of a client is confidential under Rule 1.05. However, when the lawyer 
is  taking  protective  action,  paragraph  (b)  of  this  Rule  permits  the  lawyer  to  make  necessary 
disclosures. Given the risks to the client of disclosure, paragraph (c) limits what the lawyer may 
disclose in consulting with other individuals or entities or in seeking the appointment of a legal 
representative. At the very least, the lawyer should determine whether it is likely that the person 
or entity consulted will act adversely to the client's interests before discussing matters related to 
the client.

Emergency Legal Assistance 

9.  In  an  emergency  where  the  health,  safety  or  a  financial  interest  of  a  person  with  seriously 
diminished capacity is threatened with imminent and irreparable harm, a lawyer may take legal 
action on behalf of such a person even though the person is unable to establish a client-lawyer 
relationship  or  to  make  or  express  considered  judgments  about  the  matter,  when  the  person  or 
another acting in good faith on that person's behalf has consulted with the lawyer. Even in such an 
emergency,  however,  the  lawyer  should  not  act  unless  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  that  the 
person has no other lawyer, agent or other representative available. The lawyer should take legal 
action on behalf of the person only to the extent reasonably necessary to maintain the status quo 
or otherwise avoid imminent and irreparable harm. A lawyer who undertakes to represent a person 

 

 

 

 

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 64in such an exigent situation has the same duties under these Rules as the lawyer would with respect 
to a client. 

 

10. A lawyer who acts on behalf of a person with seriously diminished capacity in an emergency 
should keep the confidences of the person as if dealing with a client, disclosing them only to the 
extent necessary to accomplish the intended protective action. The lawyer should disclose to any 
tribunal involved and to any other counsel involved the nature of his or her relationship with the 
person. The lawyer should take steps to regularize the relationship or implement other protective 
solutions  as  soon  as  possible.  Normally,  a  lawyer  would  not  seek  compensation  for  such 
emergency actions taken.

lawyer knows, at the time the services are provided, that the lawyer would be prohibited by those 
limitations from providing the services. 

b)  Lawyers  in  a  firm  with  a  lawyer  providing,  or  offering  to  provide,  limited  pro  bono  legal 
services shall not be prohibited by the imputation provisions of Rules 1.06, 1.07, and 1.09 from 
representing a client if that lawyer does not: 
 

(1) disclose confidential information of the pro bono client to the lawyers in the firm; or 

(2) maintain such information in a manner that would render it accessible to the lawyers in 
the firm. 

c) The eligibility information that an applicant is required to provide when applying for free legal 
services or limited pro bono legal services from a program described in subparagraph (d)(1) by 
itself will not create a conflict of interest if: 
 

(1) the eligibility information is not material to the legal matter; or 

(2)  the  applicant’s  provision  of  the  eligibility  information  was  conditioned  on  the 
applicant’s informed consent that providing this information would not by itself prohibit a 
representation of another client adverse to the applicant. 

d) As used in this Rule, “limited pro bono legal services” means legal services that are: 

(1)  provided  through  a  pro  bono  or  assisted  pro  se  program  sponsored  by  a  court,  bar 
association, accredited law school, or nonprofit legal services program; 

(2) short-term services such as legal advice or other brief assistance with pro se documents 
or  transactions,  provided  either  in  person  or  by  phone,  hotline,  internet,  or  video 
conferencing; and 

(3) provided without any expectation of extended representation of the limited assistance 
client or of receiving any legal fees in that matter. 

e) As used in this Rule, a lawyer is not “in a firm” with other lawyers solely because the lawyer 
provides limited pro bono legal services with the other lawyers.

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 69. Nonprofit legal services organizations, courts, law schools, and bar associations have programs 
through  which  lawyers  provide  short-term  limited  legal  services  typically  to  help  low-income 
persons  address  their  legal  problems  without  further  representation  by  the  lawyers.  In  these 
programs, such as legal-advice hotlines, advice-only clinics, disaster legal services, or programs 
providing  guidance  to  self-represented  litigants,  a  client-lawyer  relationship  is  established,  but 
there is no expectation that the relationship will continue beyond the limited consultation and there 
is no expectation that the lawyer will receive any compensation from the client for the services. 
These programs are normally operated under circumstances in which it is not feasible for a lawyer 
to check for conflicts of interest as is normally required before undertaking a representation.   

.  Application  of  the  conflict  of  interest  rules  has  deterred  lawyers  from  participating  in  these 
programs, preventing persons of limited means from obtaining much needed legal services. To 
facilitate the provision of free legal services to the public, this Rule creates narrow exceptions to 
the  conflict  of  interest  rules  for  limited  pro  bono  legal  services.  These  exceptions  are  justified 
because the limited and short-term nature of the legal services rendered in such programs reduces 
the risk that conflicts of interest will arise between clients represented through the program and 
other clients of the lawyer or the lawyer’s firm. Other than the limited exceptions set forth in this 
Rule, a lawyer remains subject to all applicable conflict of interest rules. 

cope of Representation 

. A lawyer who provides services pursuant to this Rule should secure the client's consent to the 
limited scope of the representation after explaining to the client what that means in the particular 
circumstance.  See Rule 1.02(b). If a short-term limited representation would not be fully sufficient 
under the circumstances, the lawyer may offer advice to the client but should also advise the client 
of the need for further assistance of counsel. See Rule 1.03(b). 

onflicts and the Lawyer Providing Limited Pro Bono Legal Services 

. Paragraph (a) exempts compliance with Rules 1.06, 1.07, and 1.09 for a lawyer providing limited 
pro bono legal services unless the lawyer actually knows that the representation presents a conflict 
of interest for the lawyer or for another lawyer in the lawyer's firm. A lawyer providing limited 
pro bono legal services is not obligated to perform a conflicts check before undertaking the limited 
representation.  If,  after  commencing  a  representation  in  accordance  with  this  Rule,  a  lawyer 
undertakes to represent the client in the matter on an ongoing basis or the lawyer charges a fee for 
the legal assistance, the exceptions provided by this Rule no longer apply. 

mputation of Conflicts 

. Paragraph (b) provides that a conflict of interest arising from a lawyer’s representation covered 
by this Rule will not be imputed to the lawyers in the pro bono lawyer’s firm if the pro bono lawyer 
complies with subparagraphs (b)(1) and (2).

Comment: 

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 706. To prevent a conflict of interest arising from limited pro bono legal services from being imputed 
to the other lawyers in the firm, subparagraph (b)(1) requires that the pro bono lawyer not disclose 
to any lawyer in the firm any confidential information related to the pro bono representation.  

. Subparagraph (b)(2) covers the retention of documents or other memorialization of confidential 
information, such as the pro bono lawyer’s notes, whether in paper or electronic form. To prevent 
imputation, a pro bono lawyer who retains confidential information is required by subparagraph 
(b)(2) to segregate and store it in such a way that no other lawyer in the pro bono lawyer’s firm 
can access it, either physically or electronically.  

ligibility Information 

. Paragraph (c) recognizes the unusual and uniquely sensitive personal information that applicants 
for free legal assistance may be required to provide. Organizations that receive funding to provide 
free legal assistance to low-income clients are generally required, as a condition of their funding, 
to screen the applicants for eligibility and to document eligibility for services paid for by those 
funding sources. Unlike other lawyers, law firms, and legal departments, these organizations ask 
for confidential information to determine an applicant’s eligibility for free legal assistance and are 
required to maintain records of such eligibility determinations for potential audit by their funding 
sources. Required eligibility information typically includes income, asset values, marital status, 
citizenship or immigration status, and other facts the applicant may consider sensitive. Paragraph 
(c) provides a limited exception to the conflict of interest provisions contained in Rules 1.06, 1.07, 
and 1.09 that apply when an applicant provides such information but no legal services are provided. 
This exception is available only in the two situations described in subparagraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2).  

. The first situation where the paragraph (c) exception is available is where none of the eligibility 
information is material to an issue in the legal matter. Alternatively, under subparagraph (c)(2), if 
the applicant provided confidential information after giving informed consent that the eligibility 
information would not prohibit the persons or entities identified in the consent from representing 
any  other  present  or  future  client,  then  the  eligibility  information  alone  will  not  prohibit  the 
representation. The lawyer should document the receipt of such informed consent, though a formal 
writing is not required. What constitutes informed consent is discussed in the comments to Rule 
1.06. 

0. Rule 1.05 continues to apply to the use or disclosure of all confidential information provided 
during an intake interview. Similarly, Rule 1.09 continues to apply to the representation of a person 
in a matter adverse to the applicant. Notably, Rule 1.05(c)(2) permits a lawyer to use or disclose 
information provided during an intake interview if the applicant consents after consultation to such 
use or disclosure, and Rule 1.09(a) excludes from its restrictions the representation of a person 
adverse to the applicant in the same or a substantially related matter if the applicant consents to 
such a representation.

in subparagraph (d)(1), regardless of the nature and amount of support provided. Some programs 
may be jointly sponsored by more than one of the listed sponsor types. 

2. The second element of “limited pro bono legal services,” set forth in subparagraph (d)(2), is 
designed to ensure that the services offered are so limited in time and scope that there is little risk 
that conflicts will arise between clients represented through the program and other clients of the 
lawyer or the lawyer’s firm. 

3. The third element of the definition, set forth in subparagraph (d)(3), is that the services are 
offered and provided without any expectation of either extended representation or the collection 
of legal fees in the matter. Before agreeing to proceed in the representation beyond “limited pro 
bono legal services,” the lawyer should evaluate the potential conflicts of interest that may arise 
from the representation as with any other representation. Likewise, the exceptions in paragraphs 
(a) and (b) do not apply if the lawyer expects to collect any legal fees in the limited assistance 
matter. 

irm 

4. Lawyers are not deemed to be part of the same firm simply because they volunteer through the 
same pro bono program. Nor will the personal prohibition of a lawyer participating in a pro bono 
program be imputed to other lawyers participating in the program solely by reason of that volunteer 
connection.

Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct 

VII. INFORMATION ABOUT LEGAL SERVICES 

ule 7.01. Communications Concerning a Lawyer’s Services Firm Names and Letterhead 

a)  A  lawyer  shall  not  make  or  sponsor  a  false  or  misleading  communication  about  the 
qualifications or services of a lawyer or law firm. Information about legal services must be truthful 
and  nondeceptive.  A  communication  is  false  or  misleading  if  it  contains  a  material 
misrepresentation of fact or law, or omits a fact necessary to make the statement considered as a 
whole not materially misleading. A statement is misleading if there is a substantial likelihood that 
it will lead a reasonable person to formulate a specific conclusion about the lawyer or the lawyer’s 
services for which there is no reasonable factual foundation, or if the statement is substantially 
likely to create unjustified expectations about the results the lawyer can achieve. 

1) An “advertisement” is a communication substantially motivated by pecuniary gain that 
is made by or on behalf of a lawyer to members of the public in general, which offers or 
promotes  legal  services  under  circumstances  where  the  lawyer  neither  knows  nor 
reasonably should know that the recipients need legal services in particular matters. 

2)  A  “solicitation  communication”  is  a  communication  substantially  motivated  by 
pecuniary gain that is made by or on behalf of a lawyer to a specific person who has not 
sought the lawyer’s advice or services, which reasonably can be understood as offering to 
provide legal services that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know the person needs 
in a particular matter.   

  (

  (

b) This Rule governs all communications about a lawyer’s services, including advertisements and 
solicitation communications. For purposes of Rules 7.01 to 7.06: 

c) Lawyers may practice law under a trade name that is not false or misleading. A law firm name 
may include the names of current members of the firm and of deceased or retired members of the 
firm, or of a predecessor firm, if there has been a succession in the firm identity. The name of a 
lawyer holding a public office shall not be used in the name of a law firm, or in communications 
on  its  behalf,  during  any  substantial  period  in  which  the  lawyer  is  not  actively  and  regularly 
practicing with the firm. A law firm with an office in more than one jurisdiction may use the same 
name or other professional designation in each jurisdiction, but identification of the lawyers in an 
office of the firm shall indicate the jurisdictional limitations on those not licensed to practice in 
the jurisdiction where the office is located. 

d)  A  statement  or  disclaimer  required  by  these  Rules  shall  be  sufficiently  clear  that  it  can 
reasonably  be  understood  by  an  ordinary  person  and  made  in  each  language  used  in  the 
communication. A statement that a language is spoken or understood does not require a statement 
or disclaimer in that language.

unlawful use of violence or means that violate these Rules or other law. 

f) A lawyer may state or imply that the lawyer practices in a partnership or other business entity 
only when that is accurate. 

g) If a lawyer who advertises the amount of a verdict secured on behalf of a client knows that the 
verdict was later reduced or reversed, or that the case was settled for a lesser amount, the lawyer 
must state in each advertisement of the verdict, with equal or greater prominence, the amount of 
money that was ultimately received by the client. 

a) A lawyer in private practice shall not practice under a trade name, a name that is misleading 
as to the identity of the lawyer or lawyers practicing under such name, or a firm name containing 
names other than those of one or more of the lawyers in the firm, except that the names of a 
professional corporation, professional association, limited liability partnership, or professional 
limited liability company may contain “P.C.,” “L.L.P.,” “P.L.L.C.,” or similar symbols indicating 
the nature of the organization, and if otherwise lawful a firm may use as, or continue to include 
in, its name the name or names of one or more deceased or retired members of the firm or of 
a predecessor firm in a continuing line of succession. Nothing herein shall prohibit a married 
woman from practicing under her maiden name. 

b) A firm with offices in more than one jurisdiction may use the same name in each jurisdiction, 
but identification of the lawyers in an office of the firm shall indicate the jurisdictional limitations 
on those not licensed to practice in the jurisdiction where the office is located. 

c) The name of a lawyer occupying a judicial, legislative, or public executive or administrative 
position shall not be used in the name of a firm, or in communications on its behalf, during any 
substantial period in which the lawyer is not actively and regularly practicing with the firm. 

d) A lawyer shall not hold himself or herself out as being a partner, shareholder, or associate with 
one or more other lawyers unless they are in fact partners, shareholders, or associates. 

e)  A  lawyer  shall  not  advertise  in  the  public  media  or  seek  professional  employment  by  any 
communication under a trade or fictitious name, except that a lawyer who practices under a firm 
name  as  authorized  by  paragraph  (a)  of  this  Rule  may  use  that  name  in  such  advertisement  or 
communication  but  only  if  that  name  is  the  firm  name  that  appears  on  the  lawyer's  letterhead, 
business cards, office sign, fee contracts, and with the lawyer's signature on pleadings and other 
legal documents. 

f) A lawyer shall not use a firm name, letterhead, or other professional designation that violates 
Rule 7.02(a). 

omment: 

 
1.  This  Rule  governs  all  communications  about  a  lawyer’s  services,  including  firm  names, 
letterhead, and professional designations. Whatever means are used  to make known a  lawyer’s 

  (

make  clear,  some  rules  apply  only  to  “advertisements”  or  “solicitation  communications.”  A 
statement  about  a  lawyer’s  services  falls  within  those  categories  only  if  it  was  “substantially 
motivated by  pecuniary  gain,” which means that pecuniary  gain was a substantial  factor in the 
making of the statement. 

isleading Truthful Statements 

. Misleading truthful statements are prohibited by this Rule. For example, a truthful statement is 
misleading if presented in a way that creates a substantial likelihood that a reasonable person would 
believe the lawyer’s communication requires that person to take further action when, in fact, no 
action is required.   

se of Actors 

. The use of an actor to portray a lawyer in a commercial is misleading if there is a substantial 
likelihood that a reasonable person will conclude that the actor is the lawyer who is offering to 
provide  legal  services.  Whether  a  disclaimer—such  as  a  statement  that  the  depiction  is  a 
“dramatization” or shows an “actor portraying a lawyer”—is sufficient to make the use of an actor 
not misleading depends on a careful assessment of the relevant facts and circumstances, including 
whether  the  disclaimer  is  conspicuous  and  clear.  Similar  issues  arise  with  respect  to  actors 
portraying clients in commercials. Such a communication is misleading if there is a substantial 
likelihood that a reasonable person will reach erroneous conclusions based on the dramatization. 

ntent to Refer Prospective Clients to Another Firm 

.  A  communication  offering  legal  services  is  misleading  if,  at  the  time  a  lawyer  makes  the 
communication,  the  lawyer  knows  or  reasonably  should  know,  but  fails  to  disclose,  that  a 
prospective client responding to the communication is likely to be referred to a lawyer in another 
firm.  

njustified Expectations 

. A communication is misleading if there is a substantial likelihood that it will create unjustified 
expectations  on  the  part  of  prospective  clients  about  the  results  that  can  be  achieved.  A 
communication that truthfully reports results obtained by a lawyer on behalf of clients or former 
clients may be misleading if presented so as to lead a reasonable person to form an unjustified 
expectation  that  the  same  results  could  be  obtained  for  other  clients  in  similar  matters  without 
reference to the specific factual and legal circumstances of each client’s case. Depending on the 
facts and  circumstances, the inclusion of an  appropriate disclaimer or qualifying language may 
preclude a finding that a statement is likely to mislead the public.   

equired Statements and Disclaimers 

. A statement or disclaimer required by these Rules must be presented clearly and conspicuously 
such  that  it  is  likely  to  be  noticed  and  reasonably  understood  by  an  ordinary  person.  In  radio,

content  is  easily  intelligible,  and  written  statements  must  appear  in  a  size  and  font,  and  for  a 
sufficient length of time, that a viewer can easily see and read the statements.  

nsubstantiated Claims and Comparisons 

. An unsubstantiated claim about a lawyer’s or law firm’s services or fees, or an unsubstantiated 
comparison of the lawyer’s or law firm’s services or fees with those of other lawyers or law firms, 
may be misleading if presented with such specificity as to lead a reasonable person to conclude 
that the comparison or claim can be substantiated.  

ublic Education Activities 

.  As  used  in  these  Rules,  the  terms  “advertisement”  and  “solicitation  communication”  do  not 
include statements made by a lawyer that are not substantially motivated by pecuniary gain. Thus, 
communications which merely inform members of the public about their legal rights and about 
legal services that are available from public or charitable legal-service organizations, or similar 
non-profit entities, are permissible, provided they are not misleading. These types of statements 
may  be  made  in  a  variety  of  ways,  including  community  legal  education  sessions,  know-your-
rights brochures, public service announcements on television and radio, billboards, information 
posted on organizational social media sites, and outreach to low-income groups in the community, 
such as in migrant labor housing camps, domestic violence shelters, disaster resource centers, and 
dilapidated apartment complexes. 

. A lawyer or law firm may be designated by a distinctive website address, e-mail address, social 
media  username  or  comparable  professional  designation  that  is  not  misleading  and  does  not 
otherwise violate these Rules. 

eb Presence 

ast Success and Results 

0. A communication about legal services may be misleading because it omits an important fact 
or tells only part of the truth. A lawyer who knows that an advertised verdict was later reduced or 
reversed, or that the case was settled for a lesser amount, must disclose those facts with equal or 
greater prominence to avoid creating unjustified expectations on the part of potential clients. A 
lawyer may claim credit for a prior judgement or settlement only if the lawyer played a substantial 
role in obtaining that result. This standard is satisfied if the lawyer served as lead counsel or was 
primarily responsible for the settlement. In other cases, whether the standard is met depends on 
the  facts.  A  lawyer  who  did  not  play  a  substantial  role  in  obtaining  an  advertised  judgment  or 
settlement is subject to discipline for misrepresenting the lawyer’s experience and, in some cases, 
for creating unjustified expectations about the results the lawyer can achieve.

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 7611. It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, 
deceit  or  misrepresentation.  See  Rule  8.04(a)(3);  see  also  Rule  8.04(a)(5)  (prohibiting 
communications stating or implying an ability to improperly influence a government agency or 
official). 

. A lawyer or law firm may not practice law using a name that is misleading as to the identity of 
the lawyers practicing under such name, but the continued use of the name of a deceased or retired 
member of the firm or of a predecessor firm is not considered to be misleading. Trade names are 
generally considered inherently misleading. Other types of firm names can be misleading as well, 
such as a firm name that creates the appearance that lawyers are partners or employees of a single 
law firm when in fact they are merely associated for the purpose of sharing expenses. In such cases, 
the lawyers involved may not denominate themselves in any manner suggesting such an ongoing 
professional relationship as, for example, “Smith and Jones” or “Smith and Jones Associates” or 
“Smith  and  Associates.”  Such  titles  create  the  false  impression  that  the  lawyers  named  have 
assumed a joint professional responsibility for clients' legal affairs. See paragraph (d). 

. The practice of law firms having offices in more than one state is commonplace. Although it is 
not necessary that the name of an interstate firm include Texas lawyers, a letterhead including the 
name of any lawyer not licensed in Texas must indicate the lawyer is not licensed in Texas. 

. Paragraph (c) is designed to prevent the exploitation of a lawyer's public position for the benefit 
of the lawyer's firm. Likewise, because it may be misleading under paragraph (a), a lawyer who 
occupies a judicial, legislative, or public executive or administrative position should not indicate 
that fact on a letterhead which identifies that person as an attorney in the private practice of law. 
However, a firm name may include the name of a public official who is actively and regularly 
practicing law with the firm. But see Rule 7.02(a)(5). 

.  With  certain  limited  exceptions,  paragraph  (a)  forbids  a  lawyer  from  using  a  trade  name  or 
fictitious name. Paragraph (e) sets out this same prohibition with respect to advertising in public 
media or communications seeking professional employment and contains additional restrictions 
on the use of trade names or fictitious names in those contexts. In a largely overlapping measure, 
paragraph (f) forbids the use of any such name or designation if it would amount to a “false or 
misleading communication” under Rule 7.02(a). 

ule 7.02. Advertisements Communications Concerning a Lawyer's Services 

a) An advertisement of legal services shall publish the name of a lawyer who is responsible for 
the content of the advertisement and identify the lawyer’s primary practice location. 

b)  A  lawyer  who  advertises  may  communicate  that  the  lawyer  does  or  does  not  practice  in 
particular  fields  of  law,  but  shall  not  include  a  statement  that  the  lawyer  has  been  certified  or 
designated by an organization as possessing special competence or a statement that the lawyer is 
a  member  of  an  organization  the  name  of  which  implies  that  its  members  possess  special 
competence, except that:

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 77(1) a lawyer who has been awarded a Certificate of Special Competence by the Texas Board 
of Legal Specialization in the area so advertised, may state with respect to each such area, 
“Board Certified, area of specialization -- Texas Board of Legal Specialization”; and 

2)  a  lawyer  who  is  a  member  of  an  organization  the  name  of  which  implies  that  its 
members  possess  special  competence,  or  who  has  been  certified  or  designated  by  an 
organization  as  possessing  special  competence  in  a  field  of  practice,  may  include  a 
factually accurate, non-misleading statement of such membership or certification, but only 
if that organization has been accredited by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization as a 
bona fide organization that admits to membership or grants certification only on the basis 
of  published  criteria  which  the  Texas  Board  of  Legal  Specialization  has  established  as 
required for such certification. 

  (

c) If an advertisement by a lawyer discloses a willingness to render services on a contingent fee 
basis, the advertisement must state whether the client will be obligated to pay for other expenses, 
such as the costs of litigation. 

d) A lawyer who advertises a specific fee or range of fees for an identified service shall conform 
to the advertised fee or range of fees for the period during which the advertisement is reasonably 
expected to be in circulation or otherwise expected to be effective in attracting clients, unless the 
advertisement  specifies  a  shorter  period.  However,  a  lawyer  is  not  bound  to  conform  to  the 
advertised fee or range of fees for a period of more than one year after the date of publication, 
unless the lawyer has expressly promised to do so. 

a)  A  lawyer  shall  not  make  or  sponsor  a  false  or  misleading  communication  about  the 
qualifications or the services of any lawyer or firm. A communication is false or misleading if it: 
 

(1) contains a material misrepresentation of fact or law, or omits a fact necessary to make 
the statement considered as a whole not materially misleading; 

(2)  contains  any  reference  in  a  public  media  advertisement  to  past  successes  or  results 
obtained unless 

(i) the communicating lawyer or member of the law firm served as lead counsel in 
the  matter  giving  rise  to  the  recovery,  or  was  primarily  responsible  for  the 
settlement or verdict. 

 

(ii) the amount involved was actually received by the client, 

(iii) the reference is accompanied by adequate information regarding the nature of 
the case or matter, and the damages or injuries sustained by the client, and 

(iv) if the gross amount received is stated, the attorney's fees and litigation expenses 
withheld from the amount are stated as well;

be substantiated by reference to verifiable, objective data; 

(5)  states  or  implies  that  the  lawyer  is  able  to  influence  improperly  or  upon  irrelevant 
grounds any tribunal, legislative body, or public official;

or in a solicitation communication unless the advertising or soliciting lawyer is competent 
to handle legal matters in each such area of practice; or 

(7) uses an actor or model to portray a client of the lawyer or law firm. 

b)  Rule  7.02(a)(6)  does  not  require  that  a  lawyer  be  certified  by  the  Texas  Board  of  Legal 
Specialization at the time of advertising in a specific area of practice, but such certification shall 
conclusively establish that such lawyer satisfies the requirements of Rule 7.02(a)(6) with respect 
to the area(s) of practice in which such lawyer is certified. 

c) A lawyer shall not advertise in the public media or state in a solicitation communication that 
the lawyer is a specialist except as permitted under Rule 7.04. 

d) Any statement or disclaimer required by these rules shall be made in each language used in the 
advertisement  or  solicitation  communication  with  respect  to  which  such  required  statement  or 
disclaimer relates; provided however, the mere statement that a particular language is spoken or 
understood shall not alone result in the need for a statement or disclaimer in that language. 

omment:  

.  These  Rules  permit  the  dissemination  of  information  that  is  not  false  or  misleading  about  a 
lawyer’s or law firm’s name, address, e-mail address, website, and telephone number; the kinds of 
services the lawyer will undertake; the basis on which the lawyer’s fees are determined, including 
prices  for  specific  services  and  payment  and  credit  arrangements;  a  lawyer’s  foreign  language 
abilities; names of references and, with their consent, names of clients regularly represented; and 
other similar information that might invite the attention of those seeking legal assistance. 

ommunications about Fields of Practice 

. Lawyers often benefit from associating with other lawyers for the development of practice areas. 
Thus, practitioners have established associations, organizations, institutes, councils, and practice 
groups to promote, discuss, and develop areas of the law, and to advance continuing education and 
skills  development.  While  such  activities  are  generally  encouraged,  participating  lawyers  must 
refrain from creating or using designations, titles, or certifications which are false or misleading. 
A lawyer shall not advertise that the lawyer is a member of an organization whose name implies

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 79that  members  possess  special  competence,  unless  the  organization  meets the  standards  of  Rule 
7.02(b). Merely stating a designated class of membership, such as Associate, Master, Barrister, 
Diplomate, or Advocate, does not, in itself, imply special competence violative of these Rules. 

. Paragraph (b) of this Rule permits a lawyer to communicate that the lawyer does or does not 
practice  in  particular  areas  of  law.  A  lawyer  is  generally  permitted  to  state  that  the  lawyer 
“concentrates in” or is a “specialist,” practices a “specialty,” or “specializes in” particular fields 
based on the lawyer’s experience, specialized training or education, but such communications are 
subject to the “false and misleading” standard applied by Rule 7.01 to communications concerning 
a lawyer’s services. 

.  The  Patent  and  Trademark  Office  has  a  long-established  policy  of  designating  lawyers 
practicing  before  the  Office.  The  designation  of  Admiralty  practice  also  has  a  long  historical 
tradition associated with maritime commerce and the federal courts. A lawyer’s communications 
about these practice areas are not prohibited by this Rule. 

ertified Specialist 

. This Rule permits a lawyer to state that the lawyer is certified as a specialist in a field of law if 
such certification is granted by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization or by an organization that 
applies standards of experience, knowledge and proficiency to ensure that a lawyer’s recognition 
as a specialist is meaningful and reliable, if the organization is accredited by the Texas Board of 
Legal Specialization. To ensure that consumers can obtain access to useful information about an 
organization granting certification, the name of the certifying organization must be included in any 
communication regarding the certification. 

. The Rules within Part VII are intended to regulate communications made for the purpose of 
obtaining  professional  employment.  They  are  not  intended  to  affect  other  forms  of  speech  by 
lawyers,  such  as  political  advertisements  or  political  commentary,  except  insofar  as  a  lawyer's 
effort to obtain employment is linked to a matter of current public debate. 

.  This  Rule  governs  all  communications  about  a  lawyer's  services,  including  advertisements 
regulated  by  Rule  7.04  and  solicitation  communications  regulated  by  Rules  7.03  and  7.05. 
Whatever  means  are  used  to  make  known  a  lawyer's  services,  statements  about  them  must  be 
truthful and nondeceptive. 

. Sub-paragraph (a)(1) recognizes that statements can be misleading both by what they contain 
and what they leave out. Statements that are false or misleading for either reason are prohibited. A 
truthful statement is misleading if it omits a fact necessary to make the lawyer's communication 
considered as a whole not materially misleading. A truthful statement is also misleading if there is 
a  substantial  likelihood  that  it  will  lead  a  reasonable  person  to  formulate  a  specific  conclusion 
about the lawyer or the lawyer's services for which there is no reasonable factual foundation. 

.  Sub-paragraphs  (a)(2)  and  (3)  recognize  that  truthful  statements  may  create  “unjustified 
expectations.” For example, an advertisement that truthfully reports that a lawyer obtained a jury 
verdict of a certain amount on behalf of a client would nonetheless be misleading if it were to turn 

  3

  4

  C

  5

  1

  2

  3

  4

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 80out that the verdict was overturned on  appeal  or later  compromised  for a  substantially  reduced 
amount, and the advertisement did not disclose such facts as well. Even an advertisement that fully 
and  accurately  reports  a  lawyer's  achievements  on  behalf  of  clients  or  former  clients  may  be 
misleading if presented so as to lead a reasonable person to form an unjustified expectation that 
the  same  results  could  be  obtained  for  other  clients  in  similar  matters  without  reference  to  the 
specific factual and legal circumstances of each client's case. Those unique circumstances would 
ordinarily  preclude  advertisements  in  the  public  media  and  solicitation  communications  that 
discuss  the  results  obtained  on  behalf  of  a  client,  such  as  the  amount  of  a  damage  award,  the 
lawyer's record in obtaining favorable settlements or verdicts, as well as those that contain client 
endorsements. 

. Sub-paragraph (a)(4) recognizes that comparisons of lawyer's services may also be misleading 
unless  those  comparisons  “can  be  substantiated  by  reference  to  verifiable  objective  data.” 
Similarly, an unsubstantiated comparison of the lawyer's services or fees with the services or fees 
of other lawyers may be misleading if presented with such specificity as would lead a reasonable 
person  to  conclude  that  the  comparison  can  be  substantiated.  Statements  comparing  a  lawyer's 
services with those of another where the comparisons are not susceptible of precise measurement 
or verification, such as “we are the toughest lawyers in town”, “we will get money for you when 
other  lawyers  can't”,  or  “we  are  the  best  law  firm  in  Texas  if  you  want  a  large  recovery,”  can 
deceive or mislead prospective clients. 

. The inclusion of a disclaimer or qualifying language may preclude a finding that a statement is 
likely to create unjustified expectations or otherwise mislead a prospective client, but it will not 
necessarily do so. Unless any such qualifications and disclaimers are both sufficient and displayed 
with equal prominence to the information to which they pertain, that information can still readily 
mislead prospective  clients  into  believing that similar results can be obtained  for  them without 
reference to their specific factual and legal circumstances. Consequently, in order not to be false, 
misleading, or deceptive, other of these Rules require that appropriate disclaimers or qualifying 
language must be presented in the same manner as the communication and with equal prominence. 
See Rules 7.04 (q) and 7.05(a)(2). 

. On the other hand, a simple statement of a lawyer's own qualifications devoid of comparisons 
to other lawyers does not pose  the same risk  of  being  misleading and  so does not violate sub-
paragraph (a)(4). Similarly, a lawyer making a referral to another lawyer may express a good faith 
subjective opinion regarding that other lawyer. 

. Thus, this Rule does not prohibit communication of information concerning a lawyer's name or 
firm name, address, and telephone numbers; the basis on which the lawyer's fees are determined, 
including prices for specific services and payment and credit arrangements; names of references 
and with their consent, names of clients regularly represented; and other truthful information that 
might invite the attention of those seeking legal assistance. When a communication permitted by 
Rule 7.02 is made in the public media, the lawyer should consult Rule 7.04 for further guidance 
and restrictions. When a communication permitted by Rule 7.02 is made by a lawyer through a 
solicitation communication, the lawyer should consult Rules 7.03 and 7.05 for further guidance 
and restrictions.

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 819. Sub-paragraph (a)(5) prohibits a lawyer from stating or implying that the lawyer has an ability 
to influence a tribunal, legislative body, or other public official through improper conduct or upon 
irrelevant grounds. Such conduct brings the profession into disrepute, even though the improper 
or irrelevant activities referred to are never carried out, and so are prohibited without regard to the 
lawyer's actual intent to engage in such activities. 

ommunication of Fields of Practice 

0. Paragraphs (a)(6), (b) and  (c) of Rule  7.02  regulate communications concerning  a lawyer's 
fields of practice and should be construed together with Rule 7.04 or 7.05, as applicable. If a lawyer 
in a public media advertisement or in a solicitation communication designates one or more specific 
areas of practice, that designation is at least an implicit representation that the lawyer is qualified 
in the areas designated. Accordingly, Rule 7.02(a)(6) prohibits the designation of a field of practice 
unless the communicating lawyer is in fact competent in the area. 

1.  Typically,  one  would  expect  competency  to  be  measured  by  special  education,  training,  or 
experience in the particular area of law designated. Because certification by the Texas Board of 
Legal  Specialization  involves  special  education,  training,  and  experience,  certification  by  the 
Texas Board of Legal Specialization conclusively establishes that a lawyer meets the requirements 
of Rule 7.02(a)(6) in any area in which the Board has certified the lawyer. However, competency 
may be established by means other than certification by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization. 
See Rule 7.04(b). 

2. Lawyers who wish to advertise in the public media that they specialize should refer to Rule 
7.04. Lawyers who wish to assert a specialty in a solicitation communication should refer to Rule 
7.05. 

ctor Portrayal Of Clients 

3. Sub-paragraph (a)(7) further protects prospective clients from false, misleading, or deceptive 
advertisements and solicitations by prohibiting the use of actors to portray clients of a lawyer or 
law firm. Other rules prohibit the use of actors to portray lawyers in the advertising or soliciting 
lawyer's firm. See Rules 7.04(g), 7.05(a). The truthfulness of such portrayals is extremely difficult 
to  monitor,  and  almost  inevitably  they  involve  actors  whose  apparent  physical  and  mental 
attributes differ in a number of material respects from those of the actual clients portrayed. 

ommunication in a Second Language 

4. The ability of lawyers to communicate in a second language can facilitate the delivery and 
receipt of legal services. Accordingly, it is in the best interest of the public that potential clients be 
made aware  of  a lawyer's  language  ability. A lawyer may state an  ability  to communicate in a 
second language without any further elaboration. However, if a lawyer chooses to communicate 
with potential clients in a second language, all statements or disclaimers required by the Texas 
Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct must also be made in that language. See paragraph (d). 
Communicating  some  information  in  one  language  while  communicating  the  rest  in  another  is 
potentially misleading if the recipient understands only one of the languages.

Payments 

a) The following definitions apply to this Rule: 

1)  “Regulated  telephone,  social  media,  or  other  electronic  contact”  means  telephone, 
social media, or electronic communication initiated by a lawyer, or by a person acting on 
behalf  of  a  lawyer,  that  involves  communication  in  a  live  or  electronically  interactive 
manner. 

2)  A  lawyer  “solicits”  employment  by  making  a  “solicitation  communication,”  as  that 
term is defined in Rule 7.01(b)(2). 

b)  A  lawyer  shall  not  solicit  through  in-person  contact,  or  through  regulated  telephone,  social 
media, or other electronic contact, professional employment from a non-client, unless the target of 
the solicitation is: 
 

(1) another lawyer; 

(2) a person who has a family, close personal, or prior business or professional relationship 
with the lawyer; or 

(3) a person who is known by the lawyer to be an experienced user of the type of legal 
services involved for business matters. 

c) A lawyer shall not send, deliver, or transmit, or knowingly permit or cause another person to 
send, deliver, or transmit, a communication that involves coercion, duress, overreaching, 
intimidation, or undue influence. 

d) A lawyer shall not send, deliver, or transmit, or knowingly permit or cause another person to 
send, deliver, or transmit, a solicitation communication to a prospective client, if: 
 

(1) the communication is misleadingly designed to resemble a legal pleading or other legal 
document; or

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 831) This Rule does not prohibit a lawyer from paying reasonable fees for advertising and 
public relations services or the usual charges of  a lawyer referral service that meets the 
requirements of Texas law. 

2) A lawyer may refer clients to another lawyer or a nonlawyer professional pursuant to 
an agreement not otherwise prohibited under these Rules that provides for the other person 
to refer clients or customers to the lawyer, if:  

  (

  (

(e) A lawyer shall not pay, give, or offer to pay or give anything of value to a person not licensed 
to practice law for soliciting or referring prospective clients for professional employment, except 
nominal  gifts  given  as  an  expression  of  appreciation  that  are  neither  intended  nor  reasonably 
expected to be a form of compensation for recommending a lawyer’s services.  

i) the reciprocal referral agreement is not exclusive;  

ii) clients are informed of the existence and nature of the agreement; and 

iii) the lawyer exercises independent professional judgment in making referrals. 

f) A lawyer shall not, for the purpose of securing employment, pay, give, advance, or offer to pay, 
give, or advance anything of value to a prospective client, other than actual litigation expenses and 
other  financial  assistance  permitted  by  Rule  1.08(d),  or  ordinary  social  hospitality  of  nominal 
value. 
  
(g) This Rule does not prohibit communications authorized by law, such as notice to members of 
a class in class action litigation. 

a) A lawyer shall not by in-person contact, or by regulated telephone or other electronic contact 
as  defined  in  paragraph  (f)  seek  professional  employment  concerning  a  matter  arising  out  of  a 
particular  occurrence  or  event,  or  series  of  occurrences  or  events,  from  a  prospective  client  or 
nonclient who has not sought the lawyer's advice regarding employment or with whom the lawyer 
has  no  family  or  past  or  present  attorney-client  relationship  when  a  significant  motive  for  the 
lawyer's doing so is the lawyer's pecuniary gain. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, 
a lawyer for a qualified nonprofit organization may communicate with the organization's members 
for the purpose of educating the members to understand the law, to recognize legal problems, to 
make intelligent selection of counsel, or to use legal services. In those situations where in-person 
or telephone or other electronic contact is permitted by this paragraph, a lawyer shall not have such 
a contact with a prospective client if: 
 

(1) the communication involves coercion, duress, fraud, overreaching, intimidation, undue 
influence, or harassment; 

(2) the communication contains information prohibited by Rule 7.02(a); or

statement or claim. 

b) A lawyer shall not pay, give, or offer to pay or give anything of value to a person not licensed 
to practice law for soliciting prospective clients for, or referring clients or prospective clients to, 
any  lawyer  or  firm,  except  that  a  lawyer  may  pay  reasonable  fees  for  advertising  and  public 
relations services rendered in accordance with this Rule and may pay the usual charges of a lawyer 
referral service that meets the requirements of Occupational Code Title 5, Subtitle B, Chapter 952. 

c) A lawyer, in order to solicit professional employment, shall not pay, give, advance, or offer to 
pay, give, or advance anything of value, other than actual litigation expenses and other financial 
assistance  as  permitted  by  Rule  1.08(d),  to  a  prospective  client  or  any  other  person;  provided 
however, this provision does not prohibit the payment of legitimate referral fees as permitted by 
Rule 1.04(f) or by paragraph (b) of this Rule. 

d) A lawyer shall not enter into an agreement for, charge for, or  collect a fee for professional 
employment obtained in violation of Rule 7.03(a), (b), or (c). 

e) A lawyer shall not participate with or accept referrals from a lawyer referral service unless the 
lawyer knows or reasonably believes that the lawyer referral service meets the requirements of 
Occupational Code Title 5, Subtitle B, Chapter 952. 

f) As used in paragraph (a), “regulated telephone or other electronic contact” means any electronic 
communication initiated by a lawyer or by any person acting on behalf of a lawyer or law firm that 
will  result  in  the  person  contacted  communicating  in  a  live,  interactive  manner  with  any  other 
person by telephone or other electronic means. For purposes of this Rule a website for a lawyer or 
law firm is not considered a communication initiated by or on behalf of that lawyer or firm. 

omment: 

olicitation by Public and Charitable Legal Services Organizations 

.  Rule  7.01  provides  that  a  “‘solicitation  communication’  is  a  communication  substantially 
motivated by pecuniary gain.”  Therefore, the ban on solicitation imposed by paragraph (b) of this 
Rule does not apply to  the activities of lawyers  working  for public or  charitable legal services 
organizations.   

ommunications Directed to the Public or Requested 

. A lawyer’s communication is not a solicitation if it is directed to the general public, such as 
through a billboard, an Internet banner advertisement, a website or a television commercial, or if 
it is made in response to a request for information, including an electronic search for information. 
The terms “advertisement” and “solicitation communication” are defined in Rule 7.01(b).

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 853. A potential for overreaching  exists  when  a  lawyer,  seeking  pecuniary gain,  solicits  a person 
known to be in need of legal services via in-person or regulated telephone, social media, or other 
electronic contact. These forms of contact subject a person to the private importuning of the trained 
advocate in a direct interpersonal encounter. The person, who may already feel overwhelmed by 
the circumstances giving rise to the need for legal services, may find it difficult to fully evaluate 
all available alternatives with reasoned judgment and appropriate self‑interest in the face of the 
lawyer’s presence and insistence upon an immediate response. The situation is fraught with the 
possibility of undue influence, intimidation, and overreaching. 

. The potential for overreaching that is inherent in in-person or regulated telephone, social media, 
or  other  electronic  contact  justifies  their  prohibition,  since  lawyers  have  alternative  means  of 
conveying necessary information. In particular, communications can be sent by regular mail or e-
mail, or by other means that do not involve communication in a live or electronically interactive 
manner. These forms of communications make it possible for the public to be informed about the 
need  for  legal  services,  and  about  the  qualifications  of  available  lawyers  and  law  firms,  with 
minimal risk of overwhelming a person’s judgment. 

.  The  contents  of  live  person-to-person  contact  can  be  disputed  and  may  not  be  subject  to 
third‑party scrutiny. Consequently, they are much more likely to approach (and occasionally cross) 
the dividing line between accurate representations and those that are false and misleading. 

argeted Mail Solicitation 

. Regular mail or e-mail targeted to a person that offers to provide legal services that the lawyer 
knows  or  reasonably  should  know  the  person  needs  in  a  particular  matter  is  a  solicitation 
communication within the meaning of Rule 7.01(b)(2), but is not prohibited by subsection (b) of 
this Rule.  Unlike in-person and electronically interactive communication by “regulated telephone, 
social media, or other electronic contact,” regular mail and e-mail can easily be ignored, set aside, 
or reconsidered. There is a diminished likelihood of overreaching because no lawyer is physically 
present  and  there  is  evidence  in  tangible  or  electronic  form  of  what  was  communicated.    See 
Shapero v. Kentucky B. Ass'n, 486 U.S. 466 (1988). 

ersonal, Family, Business, and Professional Relationships 

. There is a substantially reduced likelihood that a lawyer would engage in overreaching against 
a  former  client,  a  person  with  whom  the  lawyer  has  a  close  personal,  family,  business  or 
professional relationship, or in situations in which the lawyer is motivated by considerations other 
than pecuniary gain. Nor is there a serious potential for overreaching when the person contacted is 
a lawyer or is known to routinely use the type of legal services involved for business purposes. 
Examples include persons who routinely hire outside counsel to represent an entity; entrepreneurs 
who regularly engage business, employment law, or intellectual property lawyers; small business 
proprietors who routinely hire lawyers for lease or contract issues; and other people who routinely 
retain lawyers for business transactions or formations.

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 868. Paragraph (b) is not intended to prohibit a lawyer from participating in constitutionally protected 
activities of public  or charitable legal-service  organizations  or bona fide political,  social, civic, 
fraternal, employee, or trade organizations whose purposes include providing or recommending 
legal services to their members or beneficiaries. See In re Primus, 436 U.S. 412 (1978). 

roup and Prepaid Legal Services Plans 

. This Rule does not prohibit a lawyer from contacting representatives of organizations or entities 
that may be interested in establishing a group or prepaid legal plan for their members, insureds, 
beneficiaries,  or  other  third  parties.  Such  communications  may  provide  information  about  the 
availability and terms of a plan which the lawyer or lawyer's firm is willing to offer. This form of 
communication is not directed to persons who are seeking legal services for themselves. Rather, it 
is usually addressed to a fiduciary seeking a supplier of legal services for others, who may, if they 
choose,  become  prospective  clients  of  the  lawyer.  Under  these  circumstances,  the  information 
transmitted is functionally similar to the types of advertisements permitted by these Rules. 

esignation as an Advertisement 

0. For purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this Rule, a communication is rebuttably presumed to be 
“plainly  marked  or  clearly  designated  an  ‘ADVERTISEMENT’”  if:    (a)  in  the  case  of  a  letter 
transmitted in an envelope, both the outside of the envelope and the first page of the letter state the 
word  “ADVERTISEMENT”  in  bold  face  all-capital  letters  that  are  3/8”  high  on  a  uncluttered 
background;  (b)  in  the  case  of  an  e-mail  message,  the  first  word  in  the  subject  line  is 
“ADVERTISEMENT” in all capital letters; and (c) in the case of a text message or message on 
social media, the first word in the message is “ADVERTISEMENT” in all capital letters. 

aying Others to Recommend a Lawyer  

1. This Rule allows a lawyer to pay for advertising and communications, including the usual costs 
of printed or online directory listings or advertisements, television and radio airtime, domain-name 
registrations,  sponsorship  fees,  and  group  advertising.  A  lawyer  may  compensate  employees, 
agents, and vendors who are engaged to provide marketing or client development services, such 
as publicists, public-relations personnel, business-development staff, television and radio station 
employees or spokespersons, and website designers. 

2. This Rule permits lawyers to give nominal gifts as an expression of appreciation to a person 
for recommending the lawyer’s services or referring a prospective client. The gift may not be more 
than a token item as might be given for holidays, or other ordinary social hospitality. A gift is 
prohibited if offered or given in consideration of any promise, agreement, or understanding that 
such a gift would be forthcoming or that referrals would be made or encouraged in the future. 

3. A lawyer may pay others for generating client leads, such as  Internet-based client leads, as 
long as the lead generator does not recommend the lawyer, any payment to the lead generator is 
consistent  with  Rule  5.04(a)  (division  of  fees  with  nonlawyers)  and  Rule  5.04(c)  (nonlawyer 
interference  with  the  professional  independence  of  the  lawyer),  and  the  lead  generator’s 
communications are consistent with Rule 7.01 (communications concerning a lawyer’s services). 

  G

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 87To comply with Rule 7.01, a lawyer must not pay a lead generator that states, implies, or creates a 
reasonable impression that it is recommending the lawyer, is making the referral without payment 
from the lawyer, or has analyzed a person’s legal problems when determining which lawyer should 
receive the referral. See also Rule 5.03 (duties of lawyers and law firms with respect to the conduct 
of nonlawyers); Rule 8.04(a)(1) (duty to avoid violating the Rules through the acts of another). 

harges of and Referrals by a Legal Services Plan or Lawyer Referral Service 

4. A lawyer may pay the usual charges of a legal services plan or a not-for-profit or qualified 
lawyer referral service. A legal service plan is a prepaid or group legal service plan or a similar 
delivery  system  that  assists  people  who  seek  to  secure  legal  representation.  A  lawyer  referral 
service, on the other hand, is any organization that holds itself out to the public as a lawyer referral 
service.  Qualified  referral  services  are  consumer-oriented  organizations  that  provide  unbiased 
referrals to  lawyers  with  appropriate  experience in the subject matter of the representation  and 
afford  other  client  protections,  such  as  complaint  procedures  or  malpractice  insurance 
requirements.   

5. A lawyer who accepts assignments or referrals from a legal service plan or referrals from a 
lawyer referral service must act reasonably to assure that the activities of the plan or service are 
compatible  with  the  lawyer's  professional  obligations.  Legal  service  plans  and  lawyer  referral 
services may communicate with the public, but such communication must be in conformity with 
these  Rules.  Thus,  advertising  must  not  be  false  or  misleading,  as  would  be  the  case  if  the 
communications of a group advertising program or a group legal services plan would mislead the 
public to think that it was a lawyer referral service sponsored by a state agency or bar association. 

eciprocal Referral Arrangements 

6. A lawyer does not violate paragraph (e) of this Rule by agreeing to refer clients to another 
lawyer or nonlawyer professional, so long as the reciprocal referral agreement is not exclusive, the 
client is informed  of the referral  agreement, and  the lawyer  exercises independent  professional 
judgment  in  making  the  referral.  Reciprocal  referral  agreements  should  not  be  of  indefinite 
duration and should be reviewed periodically to determine whether they comply with these Rules. 
A lawyer should not enter into a reciprocal referral agreement with another lawyer that includes a 
division of fees without determining that the agreement complies with Rule 1.04(f). 

eals or Entertainment for Prospective Clients 

7. This Rule does not prohibit a lawyer from paying for a meal or entertainment for a prospective 
client that has a nominal value or amounts to ordinary social hospitality. 

. In many situations, in-person, telephone, or other prohibited electronic solicitations by lawyers 
involve  well-known  opportunities  for  abuse  of  prospective  clients.  Traditionally,  the  principal 
concerns presented by such contacts are that they can overbear the prospective client's will, lead 
to hasty and ill advised decisions concerning choice of counsel, and be very difficult to police. The 
approach taken by this Rule may be found in paragraph (f), which prohibits such communications 
if they are initiated by or on behalf of a lawyer or law firm and will result in the person contacted 

  C

  1

  1

  R

  1

  M

  1

  1

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 88communicating with any person by telephone or other electronic means. Thus, forms of electronic 
communications are prohibited that pose comparable dangers to face-to-face solicitations, such as 
soliciting business and “chat rooms” or transmitting an unsolicited, interactive communication to 
a prospective client that, when accessed, puts the recipient in direct contact with another person. 
Those that do not present such opportunities for abuse, such as pre-recorded telephone messages 
requiring a separate return call to speak to or retain an attorney or websites that must be accessed 
by an interested person and that provide relevant and truthful information concerning a lawyer or 
law firm, are permitted. 

. Nonetheless, paragraph (a) and (f) unconditionally prohibit those activities only when profit for 
the lawyer is a significant motive and the solicitation concerns matters arising out of a particular 
occurrence, event, or series of occurrences or events. The reason this outright ban is so limited is 
that there are circumstances where the dangers of such contacts can be reduced by less restrictive 
means.  As long as  the  conditions of sub-paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) are  not violated by  a 
given contact, a lawyer may engage in in-person, telephone, or other electronic solicitations when 
the  solicitation  is  unrelated  to  a  specific  occurrence,  event,  or  series  of  occurrences  or  events. 
Similarly, subject to the same restrictions, in-person, telephone, or other electronic solicitations 
are permitted where the  prospective client either  has a family or past or present attorney-client 
relationship with the lawyer or where the potential client had previously contacted the lawyer about 
possible employment in the matter. 

. In addition, Rule 7.03(a) does not prohibit a lawyer for a qualified non-profit organization from 
in-person, telephone, or other electronic solicitation of prospective clients for purposes related to 
that organization. Historically and by law, nonprofit legal aid agencies, unions, and other qualified 
nonprofit organizations and their lawyers have been permitted to solicit clients in-person or by 
telephone,  and  more  modern  electronic  means  of  communication  pose  no  additional  threats  to 
consumers justifying a more restrictive treatment. Consequently, Rule 7.03(a) is not in derogation 
of those organizations' constitutional rights to employ such methods. Attorneys for such nonprofit 
organizations, however, remain subject to this Rule's general prohibitions against undue influence, 
intimidation, overreaching, and the like. 

aying for Solicitation 

. Rule 7.03(b) does not prohibit a lawyer from paying standard commercial fees for advertising 
or public relations services rendered in accordance with these Rules. In addition, a lawyer may pay 
the fees required by a lawyer referral service that meet the requirements of Occupational Code 
Title 5, Subtitle B, Chapter 952. However, paying, giving, or offering to pay or give anything of 
value to persons not licensed to practice law who solicit prospective clients for lawyers has always 
been considered to be against the best interest of both the public and the legal profession. Such 
actions circumvent these Rules by having a non-lawyer do what a lawyer is ethically proscribed 
from doing. Accordingly, the practice is forbidden by Rule 7.03(b). As to payments or gifts of 
value to licensed lawyers for soliciting prospective clients, see Rule 1.04(f). 

. Rule 7.03(c) prohibits a lawyer from paying or giving value directly to a prospective client or 
any  other  person  as  consideration  for  employment  by  that  client  except  as  permitted  by  Rule 
1.08(d).

obtained  in  violation  of  Rule  7.03.  Paragraph  (e)  further  requires  a  lawyer  to  decline  business 
generated by a lawyer referral service unless the lawyer knows or reasonably believes that service 
is operated in conformity with statutory requirements. 

. References to “a lawyer” in this and other Rules include lawyers who practice in law firms. A 
lawyer associated with a firm cannot circumvent these Rules by soliciting or advertising in the 
name of that firm in a way that violates these Rules. See Rule 7.04(e). 

ule  7.04.  Filing  Requirements  for  Advertisements  and  Solicitation  Communications 

Advertisements in the Public Media 

a) Except as exempt under Rule 7.05, a lawyer shall file with the Advertising Review Committee, 
State Bar of Texas, no later than ten (10) days after the date of dissemination of an advertisement 
of legal services, or ten (10) days after the date of a solicitation communication sent by any means: 

1)  a  copy  of  the  advertisement  or  solicitation  communication  (including  packaging  if 
applicable) in the form in which it appeared or will appear upon dissemination; 

2) a completed lawyer advertising and solicitation communication application; and 

3) payment to the State Bar of Texas of a fee authorized by the Board of Directors. 

  (

  (

  (

b) If requested by the Advertising Review Committee, a lawyer shall promptly submit information 
to substantiate statements or representations made or implied in an advertisement or solicitation 
communication. 

c) A lawyer who desires to secure pre-approval of an advertisement or solicitation communication 
may submit to the Advertising Review Committee, not fewer than thirty (30) days prior to the date 
of  first  dissemination,  the  material  specified  in  paragraph  (a),  except  that  in  the  case  of  an 
advertisement or solicitation communication that has not yet been produced, the documentation 
will consist of a proposed text, production script, or other description, including details about the 
illustrations, actions, events, scenes, and background sounds that will be depicted. A finding of 
noncompliance by the Advertising Review Committee is not binding in a disciplinary proceeding 
or action, but a finding of compliance is binding in favor of the submitting lawyer as to all materials 
submitted  for  pre-approval  if  the  lawyer  fairly  and  accurately  described  the  advertisement  or 
solicitation  communication  that  was  later  produced.  A  finding  of  compliance  is  admissible 
evidence if offered by a party. 

a) A lawyer shall not advertise in the public media by stating that the lawyer is a specialist, except 
as permitted under Rule 7.04(b) or as follows: 
 

(1)  A  lawyer  admitted  to  practice  before  the  United  States  Patent  Office  may  use  the 
designation  “Patents,”  “Patent  Attorney,”  or  “Patent  Lawyer,”  or  any  combination  of 
those  terms.  A  lawyer  engaged  in  the  trademark  practice  may  use  the  designation

 (

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 90“Trademark,” “Trademark Attorney,” or “Trademark Lawyer,” or any combination of 
those  terms.  A  lawyer  engaged  in  patent  and  trademark  practice  may  hold  himself  or 
herself out as specializing in “Intellectual Property Law,” “Patent, Trademark, Copyright 
Law and Unfair Competition,” or any of those terms. 

(2) A lawyer may permit his or her name to be listed in lawyer referral service offices that 
meet the requirements of Occupational Code Title 5, Subtitle B, Chapter 952, according 
to the areas of law in which the lawyer will accept referrals. 

(3) A lawyer available to practice in a particular area of law or legal service may distribute 
to other lawyers and publish in legal directories and legal newspapers (whether written or 
electronic) a listing or an announcement of such availability. The listing shall not contain 
a  false  or  misleading  representation  of  special  competence  or  experience,  but  may 
contain the kind of information that traditionally has been included in such publications. 

1) shall publish or broadcast the name of at least one lawyer who is responsible for the 
content of such advertisement; and 

(2) shall not include a statement that the lawyer has been certified or designated by an 
organization as possessing special competence or a statement that the lawyer is a member 
of  an  organization  the  name  of  which  implies  that  its  members  possess  special 
competence, except that: 

  (

  (

i) a lawyer who has been awarded a Certificate of Special Competence by the 
Texas  Board  of  Legal  Specialization  in  the  area  so  advertised,  may  state  with 
respect to each such area, “Board Certified, area of specialization -- Texas Board 
of Legal Specialization;” and 

(ii) a lawyer who is a member of an organization the name of which implies that 
its members possess special competence, or who has been certified or designated 
by  an  organization  as  possessing  special  competence,  may  include  a  factually 
accurate  statement  of  such  membership  or  may  include  a  factually  accurate 
statement, “Certified area of specialization name of certifying organization,” but 
such statements may be made only if that organization has been accredited by the 
Texas Board of Legal Specialization as a bona fide organization that admits to 
membership  or  grants  certification  only  on  the  basis  of  objective,  exacting, 
publicly  available  standards  (including  high  standards  of  individual  character, 
conduct,  and  reputation)  that  are  reasonably  relevant  to  the  special  training  or 
special competence that is implied and that are in excess of the level of training 
and competence generally required for admission to the Bar; and 

(3) shall, in the case of infomercial or comparable presentation, state that the presentation 
is an advertisement; 

b) A lawyer who advertises in the public media: 

 

 

  (

 

 

 

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 91(i) both verbally and in writing at its outset, after any commercial interruption, and 
at its conclusion; and 

(ii) in writing during any portion of the presentation that explains how to contact 
a lawyer or law firm. 

c) Separate and apart from any other statements, the statements referred to in paragraph (b) 
shall be displayed conspicuously, and in language easily understood by an ordinary consumer. 

d) Subject to the requirements of Rules 7.02 and 7.03 and of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this 
Rule, a lawyer may, either directly or through a public relations or advertising representative, 
advertise services in the public media, such as (but not limited to) a telephone directory, legal 
directory,  newspaper  or  other  periodical,  outdoor  display,  radio,  television,  the  Internet,  or 
electronic, or digital media. 

e) All advertisements in the public media for a lawyer or firm must be reviewed and approved 
in writing by the lawyer or a lawyer in the firm. 

f) A copy or recording of each advertisement in the public media and relevant approval referred 
to in paragraph (e), and a record of when and where the advertisement was used, shall be kept 
by the lawyer or firm for four years after its last dissemination. 

g) In advertisements in the public media, any person who portrays a lawyer whose services or 
whose firm's services are being advertised, or who narrates an advertisement as if he or she were 
such a lawyer, shall be one or more of the lawyers whose services are being advertised.  

h)  If  an  advertisement  in  the  public  media  by  a  lawyer  or  firm  discloses  the  willingness  or 
potential  willingness  of  the  lawyer  or  firm  to  render  services  on  a  contingent  fee  basis,  the 
advertisement must state whether the client will be obligated to pay all or any portion of the court 
costs and, if  a client may be  liable for other expenses, this fact must  be disclosed.  If specific 
percentage fees or fee ranges of contingent fee work are disclosed in such advertisement, it must 
also disclose whether the percentage is computed before or after expenses are deducted from 
the recovery. 

i) A lawyer who advertises in the public media a specific fee or range of fees for a particular 
service  shall  conform  to  the  advertised  fee  or  range  of  fees  for  the  period  during  which  the 
advertisement is reasonably expected to be in circulation or otherwise expected to be effective 
in attracting clients, unless the advertisement specifies a shorter period; but in no instance is the 
lawyer bound to conform to the advertised fee or range of fees for a period of more than one 
year after the date of publication. 

j) A lawyer or firm who advertises in the public media must disclose the geographic location, by 
city or town, of the lawyer's or firm's principal office. A lawyer or firm shall not advertise the 
existence of any office other than the principal office unless: 

 

 

  (

  (

  (

  (

  (

  (

  (

  (

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 92(1) that other office is staffed by a lawyer at least three days a week; or 

(2) the advertisement states: 

 

 

(i) the days and times during which a lawyer will be present at that office, or 

(ii) that meetings with lawyers will be by appointment only. 

k) A lawyer may not, directly or indirectly, pay all or a part of the cost of an advertisement in 
the public media for a lawyer not in the same firm unless such advertisement discloses the name 
and  address  of  the  financing  lawyer,  the  relationship  between  the  advertising  lawyer  and  the 
financing lawyer, and whether the advertising lawyer is likely to refer cases received through the 
advertisement to the financing lawyer. 

l) If an advertising lawyer knows or should know at the time of an advertisement in the public 
media that a case or matter will likely be referred to another lawyer or firm, a statement of such 
fact shall be conspicuously included in such advertisement. 

m) No motto, slogan or jingle that is false or misleading may be used in any advertisement in 
the public media. 

n) A lawyer shall not include in any advertisement in the public media the lawyer's association 
with  a  lawyer  referral  service  unless  the  lawyer  knows  or  reasonably  believes  that  the  lawyer 
referral service meets the requirements of Occupational Code Title 5, Subtitle B, Chapter 952. 

o)  A  lawyer  may  not  advertise  in  the  public  media  as  part  of  an  advertising  cooperative  or 
venture of two or more lawyers not in the same firm unless each such advertisement: 

(1) states that the advertisement is paid for by the cooperating lawyers; 

(2) names each of the cooperating lawyers; 

(3)  sets  forth  conspicuously  the  special  competency  requirements  required  by  Rule 
7.04(b) of lawyers who advertise in the public media; 

(4) does not state or imply that the lawyers participating in the advertising cooperative or 
venture  possess  professional  superiority,  are  able  to  perform  services  in  a  superior 
manner,  or  possess  special  competence  in  any  area  of  law  advertised,  except  that  the 
advertisement may contain the information permitted by Rule 7.04(b)(2); and 

(5) does not otherwise violate the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct. 

p)  Each  lawyer  who  advertises  in  the  public  media  as  part  of  an  advertising  cooperative  or 
venture shall be individually responsible for: 

   

   

   

   

  (

  (

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 93(1) ensuring that each advertisement does not violate this Rule; and 

(2) complying with the filing requirements of Rule 7.07. 

q) If these rules require that specific qualifications, disclaimers or disclosures of information 
accompany  communications  concerning  a  lawyer's  services,  the  required  qualifications, 
disclaimers or disclosures must be presented in the same manner as the communication and 
with equal prominence. 

r) A lawyer who advertises on the Internet must display the statements and disclosures required 
by Rule 7.04. 

omment:  

. The Advertising Review Committee shall report to the appropriate disciplinary authority any 
lawyer  whom,  based  on  filings  with  the  Committee,  it  reasonably  believes  disseminated  a 
communication that violates Rules 7.01, 7.02, or 7.03, or otherwise engaged in conduct that raises 
a substantial question as to that lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other 
respects. See Rule 8.03(a). 

ultiple Solicitation Communications 

. Paragraph (a) does not require that a lawyer submit a copy of each written solicitation letter a 
lawyer sends. If the same form letter is sent to several persons, only a representative sample of 
each form letter, along with a representative sample of the envelopes used to mail the letters, need 
be filed. 

equests for Additional Information 

. Paragraph (b) does not empower the Advertising Review Committee to seek information from 
a lawyer to substantiate statements or representations made or implied in communications about 
legal services that were not substantially motivated by pecuniary gain. 

. Neither Rule 7.04 nor Rule 7.05 prohibits communications authorized by law, such as notice to 
members of a class in class action litigation. 

dvertising Areas of Practice and Special Competence 

.  Paragraphs  (a)  and  (b)  permit  a  lawyer,  under  the  restrictions  set  forth,  to  indicate  areas  of 
practice in advertisements about the lawyer's services. See also paragraph (d). The restrictions are 
designed primarily to require that accurate information be conveyed. These restrictions recognize 
that a lawyer has a right protected by the United States Constitution to advertise publicly, but that 
the right may be regulated by reasonable restrictions designed to protect the public from false or 
misleading information. The restrictions contained in Rule 7.04 are based on the experience of the 
legal profession in the State of Texas and are designed to curtail what experience has shown to be

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 94misleading  and  deceptive  advertising.  To  ensure  accountability,  sub-paragraph  (b)(1)  requires 
identification of at least one lawyer responsible for the content of the advertisement. 

. Because of long-standing tradition a lawyer admitted to practice before the United States Patent 
Office may use the designation “patents,” “patent attorney,” or “patent lawyer” or any combination 
of  those  terms.  As  recognized  by  paragraph  (a)(1),  a  lawyer  engaged  in  patent  and  trademark 
practice  may  hold  himself  out  as  concentrating  in  “intellectual  property  law,”  “patents,  or 
trademarks and related matters,” or “patent, trademark, copyright law and unfair competition” or 
any combination of those terms. 

. Paragraph (a)(2) recognizes the propriety of listing a lawyer's name in legal directories according 
to the areas  of  law in  which the lawyer will accept new matters. The  same  right is  given with 
respect  to  lawyer  referral  service  offices,  but  only  if  those  services  comply  with  statutory 
guidelines. The restriction in paragraph (a)(2) does not prevent a legal aid agency or prepaid legal 
services plan from advertising legal services provided under its auspices. 

. Paragraph (a)(3) continues the historical exception that permits advertisements by lawyers to 
other lawyers in legal directories and legal newspapers (whether written or electronic), subject to 
the same requirements of truthfulness that apply to all other forms of lawyer advertising. Such 
advertisements traditionally contain information about the name, location, telephone numbers, and 
general  availability  of  a  lawyer  to  work  on  particular  legal  matters.  Other  information  may  be 
included so long as it is not false or misleading. Because advertisements in these publications are 
not available to the general public, lawyers who list various areas of practice are not required to 
comply with paragraph (b). 

.  Some  advertisements,  sometimes  known  as  tombstone  advertisements,  mention  only  such 
matters as the name of the lawyer or law firm, a listing of lawyers associated with the firm, office 
addresses and telephone numbers, office and telephone service hours, dates of admission to bars, 
the  acceptance  of  credit  cards,  and  fees.  The  content  of  such  advertisements  is  not  the  kind  of 
information intended to be regulated by Rule 7.04 (b). However, if the advertisement in the public 
media mentions any area of the law in which the lawyer practices, then, because of the likelihood 
of misleading material, the lawyer must comply with paragraph (b). 

. Sometimes lawyers choose to advertise in the public media the fact that they have been certified 
or designated by a particular organization or that they are members of a particular organization. 
Such statements naturally lead the public to believe that the lawyer possesses special competence 
in the area of law mentioned. Consequently, in order to ensure that the public will not be misled 
by such statements, sub-paragraph (b)(2) and paragraph (c) place limited but necessary restrictions 
upon a lawyer's basic right to advertise those affiliations. 

. Rule 7.04(b)(2) gives lawyers who possess certificates of specialization from the Texas Board 
of Legal Specialization or other meritorious credentials from organizations approved by the Board 
the option of stating that fact, provided that the restrictions set forth in subparagraphs (b)(2)(i) and 
(b)(2)(ii) are followed.

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 959. Paragraph (c) is intended to ensure against misleading or material variations from the statements 
required by paragraph (b). 

0. Paragraphs (e) and (f) provide the advertising lawyer, the Bar, and the public with requisite 
records should questions arise regarding the propriety of a public media advertisement. Paragraph 
(e),  like  paragraph  (b)(1),  ensures  that  a  particular  attorney  accepts  responsibility  for  the 
advertisement. It is in the public interest and in the interest of the legal profession that the records 
of those advertisements and approvals be maintained. 

xamples of Prohibited Advertising 

1.  Paragraphs  (g)  through  (o)  regulate  conduct  that  has  been  found  to mislead  or  be  likely  to 
mislead  the  public.  Each  paragraph  is  designed  to  protect  the  public  and  to  guard  the  legal 
profession against these documented misleading practices while at the same time respecting the 
constitutional rights of any lawyer to advertise. 

2.  Paragraph  (g)  prohibits  lawyers  from  misleading  the  public  into  believing  a  non-lawyer 
portrayor or narrator in the advertisement is one of the lawyers prepared to perform services for 
the public. It does not prohibit the narration of an advertisement in the third person by an actor, as 
long as it is clear to those hearing or seeing the advertisement that the actor is not a lawyer prepared 
to perform services for the public. 

3.  Contingent  fee  contracts  present  unusual  opportunities  for  deception  by  lawyers  or  for 
misunderstanding  by  the  public.  By  requiring  certain  disclosures,  paragraph  (h)  safeguards  the 
public from misleading or potentially misleading advertisements that involve representation on a 
contingent fee basis. The affirmative requirements of paragraph (h) are not triggered solely by the 
expression  of  “contingent  fee”  or  “percentage  fee”  in  the  advertisement.  To  the  contrary,  they 
encompass  advertisements  in  the  public  media  where  the  lawyer  or  firm  expresses  a  mere 
willingness or potential willingness to render services for a contingent fee. Therefore, statements 
in an advertisement such as “no fee if no recovery” or “fees in the event of recovery only” are 
clearly included as a form of advertisement subject to the disclosure requirements of paragraph 
(h). 

4. Paragraphs (i), (j), (k) and (l) jointly address the problem of advertising that experience has 
shown misleads the public concerning the fees that will be charged, the location where services 
will be provided, or the attorney who will be performing these services. Together they prohibit the 
same sort of “bait and switch” advertising tactics by lawyers that are universally condemned. 

5. Paragraph (i) requires  a lawyer who  advertises  a  specific  fee or range  of fees in the  public 
media to honor those commitments for the period during which the advertisement is reasonably 
expected to be in circulation or otherwise expected to be effective in attracting clients, unless the 
advertisement itself specifies a shorter period. In no event, however, is a lawyer required to honor 
an advertised fee or range of fees for more than one year after publication. 

6. Paragraph (j) prohibits advertising the availability of a satellite office unless the requirements 
of subparagraphs (1) or (2) are satisfied. Paragraph (j) does not require, however, that a lawyer or 

  1

  E

  1

  1

  1

  1

  1

  1

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 96firm  specify  which  of  several  properly  advertised  offices  is  its  “principal”  one,  as  long  as  the 
principal office is among those advertised and the advertisement discloses the city or town in which 
that office is located. Experience has shown that, in the absence of such regulation, members of 
the public have been misled into employing a lawyer in a distant city who advertises that there is 
a nearby satellite office, only to learn later that the lawyer is rarely available to the client because 
the nearby office is seldom open or is staffed only by lay personnel. Paragraph (j) is not intended 
to restrict the ability of legal services programs to advertise satellite offices in remote parts of the 
program's service area even if those satellite offices are staffed irregularly by attorneys. Otherwise 
low-income individuals in and near such communities might be denied access to the only legal 
services truly available to them. 

7. When a lawyer  or  firm advertises, the  public has  a right to expect  that  lawyer or  firm will 
perform the legal services. Experience has shown that attorneys not in the same firm may create a 
relationship wherein one will finance advertising for the other in return for referrals. Nondisclosure 
of such a referral  relationship is misleading to the public. Accordingly, paragraph (k) prohibits 
such a relationship between an advertising lawyer and a lawyer who finances the advertising unless 
the  advertisement  discloses  the  nature  of  the  financial  relationship  between  the  two  lawyers. 
Paragraph (l)  addresses the same problem from a different perspective, requiring a lawyer who 
advertises  the  availability  of  legal  services  and  who  know  or  should  know  at  the  time  that  the 
advertisement is placed in the media that business will likely be referred to another lawyer or firm, 
to include a conspicuous statement of that fact in any such advertising. This requirement applies 
whether or not the lawyer to whom the business is referred is financing the advertisements of the 
referring lawyer. It does not, however, require disclosure of all possible scenarios under which a 
referral could occur, such as an unforeseen need to associate with a specialist in accordance with 
Rule 1.01(a) or the possibility of a referral if a prospective client turns out to have a conflict of 
interest precluding representation by the advertising lawyer. Lawyers participating in any type of 
arrangement to refer cases must comply with Rule 1.04(f). 

8. Paragraph (m) protects the public by forbidding mottos, slogans, and jingles that are false or 
misleading. There are, however, mottos, slogans, and jingles that are informative rather than false 
or misleading. Accordingly, paragraph (m) recognizes an advertising lawyer's constitutional right 
to include appropriate mottos, slogans, and jingles in advertising. 

9. Some lawyers choose to band together in a cooperative or joint venture to advertise. Although 
those arrangements are lawful, the fact that several independent lawyers have joined together in a 
single  advertisement  increases  the  risk  of  misrepresentation  or  other  forms  of  inappropriate 
expression.  Special  care  must  be  taken  to  ensure  that  cooperative  advertisements  identify  each 
cooperating  lawyer,  state  that  each  cooperating  lawyer  is  paying  for  the  advertisement,  and 
accurately describe the professional qualifications of each cooperating lawyer. See paragraph (o). 
Furthermore, each cooperating lawyer must comply with the filing requirements of Rule 7.07. See 
paragraph (p). 

0. The use of disclosures, disclaimers and qualifying information is necessary to inform the public 
about various aspects of a lawyer or firm's practice in public media advertising and solicitation 
communications.  In  order  to  ensure  that  disclaimers  required  by  these  rules  are  conspicuously 
displayed,  paragraph  (q)  requires  that  such  statements  be  presented  in  the  same  manner  as  the 

  1

  1

  1

  2

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 97communication and with prominence equal to that of the matter to which it refers. For example, in 
a television advertisement that necessitates the use of a disclaimer, if a statement or claim is made 
verbally, the disclaimer should also be included verbally in the commercial. When a statement or 
claim  appears  in  print,  the  accompanying  disclaimer  must  also  appear  in  print  with  equal 
prominence and legibility.

(1) shall, in the case of a non-electronically transmitted written communication, be plainly 
marked “ADVERTISEMENT” on its first page, and on the face of the envelope or other

to transmit the communication, or on the outside of a self-mailing brochure or pamphlet, 
the nature of the legal problem of the prospective client or non-client; and 

(5) shall disclose how the lawyer obtained the information prompting the communication 
to solicit professional employment if such contact was prompted by a specific occurrence 
involving the recipient of the communication, or a family member of such person(s). 

c) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this Rule, an audio, audio-visual, digital media, recorded 
telephone message, or other electronic communication sent to prospective clients for the purpose

(1) shall, in the case of any such communication delivered to the recipient by non-electronic

(1) directed to a family member or a person with whom the lawyer had or has an attorney

omment: 

Website-Related Filings 

 

 

. This Rule exempts certain types of communications from the filing requirements of Rule 7.04. 
Communications that were not substantially motivated by pecuniary gain do not need to be filed. 

2. While the entire website of a lawyer or law firm must be compliant with Rules 7.01 and 7.02, 
the only material on the website that may need to be filed pursuant to this Rule is the contents of 
the  homepage.    However,  even  a  homepage  does  not  need  to  be  filed  if  the  contents  of  the 
homepage are exempt from filing under the provisions of this Rule. Under Rule 7.04(c), a lawyer 
may voluntarily seek pre-approval of any material that is part of the lawyer’s website. 

. Rule 7.03 deals with in-person, telephone, and other prohibited electronic contact between a 
lawyer  and  a  prospective  client  wherein  the  lawyer  seeks  professional  employment.  Rule  7.04 
deals with advertisements in the public media by a lawyer seeking professional employment. This 
Rule  deals  with  solicitations  between  a  lawyer  and  a  prospective  client.  Typical  examples  are 
letters  or  other  forms  of  correspondence  (including  those  sent,  delivered,  or  transmitted 
electronically), recorded telephone messages, audiotapes, videotapes, digital media, and the like, 
addressed to a prospective client. 

. Written, audio, audio-visual, and other forms of electronic solicitations raise more concerns than 
do  comparable  advertisements.  Being  private,  they  are  more  difficult  to  monitor,  and  for  that 
reason  paragraph  (e)  requires  retention  for  four  years  of  certain  information  regarding  all  such 
solicitations. See also Rule 7.07(a). Paragraph (a) addresses such concerns as well as problems 
stemming from exceptionally outrageous communications such as solicitations involving fraud, 

  (

 

 

   

  C

  1

  1

  2

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 102intimidation, or deceptive and misleading claims. Because receipt of multiple solicitations appears 
to be most pronounced and vexatious in situations involving accident victims, paragraphs (b)(1), 
(b)(2), (c)(1), (c)(4) and (c)(5) require that the envelope or other packaging used to transmit the 
communication, as well as the communication itself, plainly disclose that the communication is an 
advertisement, while paragraphs (b)(5) and (c)(3) require disclosure of the source of information 
if the solicitation was prompted by a specific occurrence. 

. Because experience has shown that many written, audio, audio-visual, electronic mail, and other 
forms of electronic solicitations have been intrusive or misleading by reason of being personalized 
or  being  disguised  as  some  form  of  official  communication,  special  prohibitions  against  such 
practices are necessary. The requirements of paragraph (b) and (c) greatly lessen those dangers of 
deception and harassment. 

.  Newsletters  or  other  works  published  by  a  lawyer  that  are  not  circulated  for  the  purpose  of 
obtaining professional employment are not within the ambit of paragraph (b) or (c). 

. This Rule also regulates audio, audio-visual, or other forms of electronic communications being 
used to solicit business. It includes such formats as recorded telephone messages, movies, audio 
or  audio-visual  recordings  or  tapes,  digital  media,  the  Internet,  and  other  comparable  forms  of 
electronic  communications.  It  requires  that  such  communications  comply  with  all  of  the 
substantive requirements applicable to written solicitations that are compatible with the different 
forms  of  media  involved,  as  well  as  with  all  requirements  related  to  approval  of  the 
communications and retention of records concerning them. See paragraphs (c), (d), and (e). 

. In addition to addressing these special problems posed by solicitations, Rule 7.05 regulates the 
content of those communications. It does so by incorporating the standards of Rule 7.02 and those 
of Rule 7.04 that would apply to the solicitation were it instead a comparable form of advertisement 
in the public media. See paragraphs (a)(2) and (3). In brief, this approach means that, except as 
provided in paragraph (f), a lawyer may not include or omit anything from a solicitation unless the 
lawyer could do so were the communication a comparable form of advertisement in the public 
media. 

.  Paragraph  (f)  provides  that  the  restrictions  in  paragraph  (b)  and  (c)  do  not  apply  in  certain 
situations because the dangers of deception, harassment, vexation and overreaching are quite low. 
For example, a written solicitation may be directed to a family member or a present or a former 
client, or in response to a request by a prospective client without stating that it is an advertisement. 
Similarly, a written solicitation may be used in seeking general employment in commercial matters 
from  a  bank  or  other  corporation,  when  there  is  neither  concern  with  specific  existing  legal 
problems nor concern with a particular past event or series of events. All such communications, 
however,  remain  subject  to  Rule  7.02  and  paragraphs  (h)  through  (o)  of  Rule  7.04.  See  sub-
paragraph (a)(2). 

. In addition, paragraph (f) allows such communications in situations not involving the lawyer's 
pecuniary gain. For purposes of these rules, it is presumed that communications made on behalf 
of a nonprofit legal aid agency, union, or other qualified nonprofit organization are not motivated 

  3

rebutted. 

ule 7.06. Prohibited Employment 

a)  A  lawyer  shall  not  accept  or  continue  employment  in  a  matter  when  that  employment  was 
procured  by  conduct  prohibited  by  any  of  Rules  7.01  through  7.035,  8.04(a)(2),  or  8.04(a)(9), 
engaged in by that lawyer personally or by another any other person whom the lawyer ordered, 
encouraged, or knowingly permitted to engage in such conduct. 

b)  A  lawyer  shall  not  accept  or  continue  employment  in  a  matter  when  the  lawyer  knows  or 
reasonably should know that employment was procured by conduct prohibited by any of Rules 
7.01 through 7.035, 8.04(a)(2), or 8.04(a)(9), engaged in by another any other person or entity that 
is a shareholder, partner, or member of, an associate in, or of counsel to that lawyer's firm; or by 
any other person whom any of the foregoing persons or entities ordered, encouraged, or knowingly 
permitted to engage in such conduct. 

c) A lawyer who has not violated paragraph (a) or (b) in accepting employment in a matter shall 
not continue employment in that matter once the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that 
the person procuring the lawyer's employment in the matter engaged in, or ordered, encouraged, 
or knowingly permitted another to engage in, conduct prohibited by any  of Rules 7.01 through 
7.035,  8.04(a)(2),  or  8.04(a)(9)  in  connection  with  the  matter  unless  nothing  of  value  is  given 
thereafter in return for that employment.

ersonal Disqualification 

 

.  This  Rule  deals  with 
disqualification, and referral-related payments.   

three  different  situations:  personal  disqualification, 

imputed 

2.  Paragraph  (a)  addresses  situations  where  the  lawyer  in  question  has  violated  the  specified 
advertising rules or other provisions dealing with serious  crimes  and barratry. The Rule makes 
clear  that  the  offending  lawyer  cannot  accept  or  continue  to  provide  representation.  This 
prohibition  also  applies  if  the  lawyer  ordered,  encouraged,  or  knowingly  permitted  another  to 
violate the Rules in question. 

mputed Disqualification 
 

3. Second, paragraph (b) addresses whether other lawyers in a firm can provide representation if a 
person or entity in the firm has violated the specified advertising rules or other provisions dealing 
with serious crimes and barratry, or has ordered, encouraged, or knowingly permitted another to 
engage  in  such  conduct.  The  Rule  clearly  indicates  that  the  other  lawyers  cannot  provide 
representation if they knew or reasonably should have known that the employment was procured 
by  conduct  prohibited  by  the  stated  Rules.  This  effectively  means  that,  in  such  cases,  the

is imputed to other members of the firm.   

estriction on Referral-Related Payments 

 

4. Paragraph (c) deals with situations where a lawyer knows or reasonably should know that a case 
referred to the lawyer or the lawyer’s law firm was procured by violation of the advertising rules 
or  other  specified  provisions.  The  Rule  makes  clear  that,  even  if  the  lawyer’s  conduct  did  not 
violate paragraph (a) or (b), the lawyer can continue to provide representation only if the lawyer 
does not pay anything of value, such as a referral fee, to the person making the referral. 

election of a lawyer by a client often is a result of the advice and recommendation of third parties-
-relatives, friends, acquaintances, business associates, and other lawyers. Although that method of 
referral is perfectly legitimate, the client is best served if the recommendation is disinterested and 
informed.  All  lawyers  must  guard  against  creating  situations  where  referral  from  others  is  the 
consequence of some form of prohibited compensation or from some form of false or misleading 
communication, or by virtue of some other violation of any of Rules 7.01 through 7.05, 8.04(a)(2), 
or 8.04(a)(9). Paragraph (a) forbids a lawyer who violated these rules in procuring employment in 
a matter from accepting or continuing employment in that matter. This prohibition also applies if 
the lawyer ordered, encouraged, or knowingly permitted another to violate these rules. Paragraph 
(b) also forbids a lawyer from accepting or continuing employment in a matter if the lawyer knows 
or reasonably should know that a member or employee of his or her firm or any other person has 
procured employment in a matter as a result of  conduct that violates these rules. Paragraph (c) 
addresses the situation where the lawyer becomes aware that the matter was procured in violation 
of these rules by an attorney or individual, but had no culpability. In such circumstances, the lawyer 
may continue employment and collect a fee in the matter as long as nothing of value is given to 
the attorney or individual involved in the violation of the rule(s). See also Rule 7.03(d), forbidding 
a lawyer to charge or collect a fee where the misconduct involves violations of Rule 7.03(a), (b), 
or (c). 

ule  7.07.  Filing  Requirements  for  Public  Advertisements  and  Written,  Recorded, 

Electronic, or Other Digital Solicitations 

a)  Except  as  provided  in  paragraphs  (c)  and  (e)  of  this  Rule,  a  lawyer  shall  file  with  the

of Directors. Such fee shall be for the sole purpose of defraying the expense of enforcing 
the rules related to such solicitations. 

b) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this Rule, a lawyer shall file with the Advertising Review 
Committee of the State Bar of Texas, no later than the first dissemination of an advertisement in 
the public media, a copy of each of the lawyer's advertisements in the public media. The filing 
shall include: 
 

(1)  a  copy  of  the  advertisement  in  the  form  in  which  it  appears  or  will  appear  upon 
dissemination, such as a videotape, audiotape, DVD, CD, a print copy, or a photograph of 
outdoor advertising; 

(2) a production script of the advertisement setting forth all words used and describing in 
detail  the  actions,  events,  scenes,  and  background  sounds  used  in  such  advertisement 
together with a listing of the names and addresses of persons portrayed or heard to speak, 
if the advertisement is in or will be in a form in which the advertised message is not fully 
revealed by a print copy or photograph; 

(3) a statement of when and where the advertisement has been, is, or will be used;  

(4) a completed lawyer advertising and solicitation communication application form; and 

(5) a check or money order payable to the State Bar of Texas for the fee set by the Board 
of Directors. Such fee shall be for the sole purpose of defraying the expense of enforcing 
the rules related to such advertisements. 

c) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this Rule, a lawyer shall file with the Advertising Review 
Committee  of  the  State  Bar  of  Texas  no  later  than  its  first  posting  on  the  internet  or  other 
comparable network of computers information concerning the lawyer's or lawyer's firm's website. 
As used in this Rule, a “website” means a single or multiple page file, posted on a computer server, 
which describes a lawyer or law firm's practice or qualifications, to which public access is provided 
through publication of a uniform resource locator (URL). The filing shall include: 
 

(1) the intended initial access page of a website; 

(2) a completed lawyer advertising and solicitation communication application form; and 

(3) a check or money order payable to the State Bar of Texas for the fee set by the Board 
of Directors. Such fee shall be set for the sole purpose of defraying the expense of enforcing 
the rules related to such websites, 

d) A lawyer who desires to secure an advance advisory opinion, referred to as a request for pre-
approval, concerning compliance of a contemplated solicitation communication or advertisement 
may submit to the Advertising Review Committee, not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date 
of first dissemination, the material specified in paragraph (a) or (b), or the intended initial access

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 106page  submitted  pursuant  to  paragraph  (c),  including  the  application  form  and  required  fee; 
provided however, it shall not be necessary to submit a videotape or DVD if the videotape or DVD 
has not then been prepared and the production script submitted reflects in detail and accurately the 
actions,  events,  scenes,  and  background  sounds  that  will  be  depicted  or  contained  on  such 
videotapes or DVDs, when prepared, as well as the narrative transcript of the verbal and printed 
portions  of  such  advertisement.  If  a  lawyer  submits  an  advertisement  or  solicitation 
communication  for  pre-approval,  a  finding  of  noncompliance  by  the  Advertising  Review 
Committee  is  not  binding  in  a  disciplinary  proceeding  or  disciplinary  action  but  a  finding  of 
compliance is binding in favor of the submitting lawyer as to all materials actually submitted for 
pre-approval if the representations, statements, materials, facts and written assurances received in 
connection  therewith  are  true  and  are  not  misleading.  The  finding  of  compliance  constitutes 
admissible evidence if offered by a party. 

e) The filing requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) do not extend to any of the following 
materials, provided those materials comply with Rule 7.02(a) through (c) and, where applicable,

information: 

(i) the name of the lawyer or firm and lawyers associated with the firm, with office

hours, telecopier numbers, and a designation of the profession such as “attorney”, 
“lawyer”, “law office”, or “firm;” 

(ii) the particular areas of law in which the lawyer or firm specializes or possesses 
special competence; 

(iii) the particular areas of law in which the lawyer or firm practices or concentrates

omment: 

. Rule 7.07 covers the filing requirements for public media advertisements (see Rule 7.04) and 
written,  recorded,  or  other  electronic  solicitations  (see  Rule  7.05).  Rule  7.07(a)  deals  with 
solicitation communication sent by a lawyer to one or more specified prospective clients. Rule 
7.07(b) deals with advertisements in the public media. Rule 7.07(c) deals with websites. Although 
websites are a form of advertisement in the public media, they require different treatment in some 
respects  and  so  are  dealt  with  separately.  Each  provision  allows  the  Bar  to  charge  a  fee  for 
reviewing  submitted  materials,  but  requires  that  fee  be  set  solely  to  defray  the  expenses  of 
enforcing those provisions. 

. Copies of non-exempt solicitations communication or advertisements in public media (including 
websites) must be provided to the Advertising Review Committee of the State Bar of Texas either 
in advance or concurrently with dissemination, together with the fee required by the State Bar of 
Texas  Board  of  Directors.  Presumably,  the  Advertising  Review  Committee  will  report  to  the 
appropriate  grievance  committee  any  lawyer  whom  it  finds  from  the  reviewed  products  has 
disseminated  an  advertisement  in  the  public  media  or  solicitation  communication  that  violates 
Rules 7.02, 7.03, 7.04, or 7.05, or, at a minimum, any lawyer whose violation raises a substantial 
question as to that lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects. See 
Rule 8.03(a). 

. Paragraph (a) does not require that a lawyer submit a copy of each and every written solicitation 
letter a lawyer sends. If the same form letter is sent to several people, only a representative sample 
of each form letter, along with a representative sample of the envelopes used to mail the letters, 
need be filed.

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 1094.  A  lawyer  wishing  to  do  so  may  secure  an  advisory  opinion  from  the  Advertising  Review 
Committee concerning any proposed advertisement in the public media (including a website) or 
any solicitation communication in advance of its first use or dissemination by complying with Rule 
7.07(d). This procedure is intended as a service to those lawyers who want to resolve any possible 
doubts about their proposed advertisements' or solicitations' compliance with these Rules before 
utilizing them. Its use is purely optional. No lawyer is required to obtain advance clearance of any 
advertisement in the public media (including a website) or any solicitation communication from 
the State Bar. Although a finding of noncompliance by the Advertising Review Committee is not 
binding in a disciplinary proceeding, a finding of compliance is binding in favor of the submitting 
lawyer as to all materials actually submitted for review, as long as the lawyer's presentation to the 
Advertising  Review  Committee  in  connection  with  that  advisory  opinion  is  true  and  not 
misleading. 

. Under its Internal Rules and Operating Procedures, the Advertising Review Committee is to 
complete its evaluations no later than 25 days after the date of receipt of a filing. The only way 
that the Committee can extend that review period is to: (1) determine that there is reasonable doubt 
whether the advertisement or solicitation communication complies with these Rules; (2) conclude 
that further examination is warranted but cannot be completed within the 25-day period; and (3) 
advise the lawyer of those determinations in writing within that 25 day period. The Committee's 
Internal Rules and Operating Procedures also provide that a failure to send such a communication 
to the lawyer within the 25-day period constitutes approval of the  advertisement or solicitation 
communication.  Consequently,  if  an  attorney  submits  an  advertisement  in  the  public  media 
(including a website) or a solicitation communication to the Committee for advance approval not 
less than 30 days prior to the date of first dissemination as required by these Rules, the attorney 
will  receive  an  assessment  of  that  advertisement  or  communication  before  the  date  of  its  first 
intended use. 

. Consistent with the effort to protect the first amendment rights of lawyers while ensuring the 
right of the public to be free from misleading advertising and the right of the Texas legal profession 
to maintain its  integrity,  paragraph  (e) exempts certain types of advertisements  and solicitation 
communications prepared for the purpose of seeking paid professional employment from the filing 
requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c). Those types of communications need not be filed at 
all if they were not prepared to secure paid professional employment. 

. For the most part, the types of exempted advertising listed in sub-paragraphs (e)(1) to (e)(5) are 
objective and less likely to result in false, misleading or fraudulent content. Similarly the types of 
exempted  solicitation  communications  listed  in  sub-paragraphs  (e)(6)  to  (e)(8)  are  those  found 
least likely to result in harm to the public. See Rule 7.05(f), and comment 7 to Rule 7.05. The fact 
that  a  particular  advertisement  or  solicitation  made  by  a  lawyer  is  exempted  from  the  filing 
requirements of this Rule does not exempt a lawyer from the other applicable obligations of these 
Rules. See generally Rules 7.01 through 7.06. 

. Paragraph (f) does not empower the Advertising Review Committee to seek information from a 
lawyer to substantiate statements or representations made or implied in advertisements or written 
communications that do not seek to obtain paid professional employment for that lawyer.

Federal Court or Federal Agency Discipline 

Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct 

ule 8.03. Reporting Professional Misconduct 

A  lawyer  who  has  been  disciplined  by  the  attorney-regulatory  agency  of  another 
jurisdiction,  or  by  a  federal  court  or  federal  agency,  must  notify  the  chief  disciplinary 
counsel within 30 days of the date of the order or judgment. The notice must include a copy 
of the order or judgment. For purposes of this paragraph, “discipline” by a federal court or 
federal agency  means a  public reprimand,  suspension,  or disbarment; the term  does not 
include a letter of “warning” or “admonishment” or a similar advisory by a federal court 
or federal agency.

“Professional Misconduct” includes: 

Attorney conduct that occurs in another state or in the District of Columbia

jurisdiction, including before any federal court or federal agency, and results in the 
disciplining of an attorney in that other jurisdiction, if the conduct is Professional 
Misconduct under the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct. 

.01.  Orders  From  Other  Jurisdictions:  Upon  receipt  of  information  indicating  that  an 
attorney licensed to practice law in Texas has been disciplined in another jurisdiction, including 
by  any  federal  court  or  federal  agency,  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  shall  diligently  seek  to 
obtain a certified copy of the order or judgment of discipline from the other jurisdiction, and file 
it  with the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals  along  with  a  petition  requesting  that  the  attorney  be 
disciplined  in  Texas.  A  certified  copy  of  the  order  or  judgment  is  prima  facie  evidence  of  the 
matters contained therein, and a final adjudication in another jurisdiction that an attorney licensed 
to practice law in Texas has committed Professional Misconduct is conclusive for the purposes of 
a Disciplinary Action under this Part, subject to the defenses set forth in Rule 9.04 below.  For 
purposes of this Part, “discipline” by a federal court or federal agency means a public reprimand,

judge so appointed assigned be unable to fulfill the appointment assignment, he or 
she shall immediately notify the Clerk of the Supreme Court Presiding Judge, and 
the Supreme Court Presiding Judge shall appoint assign a replacement judge whose 
district does not include the county of appropriate venue. The A judge appointed 
assigned under this Rule shall be subject to objection, recusal or disqualification as 
provided by law the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and the laws of this state. The 
objection, motion seeking recusal or motion to disqualify must be filed by either 
party  not  later  than  sixty  days  from  the  date  the  Respondent  is  served  with  the 
Supreme Court's order appointing the judge within the time provided by Rule 18a, 
Texas  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.  In  the  event  of  objection,  recusal  or 
disqualification,  the  Supreme  Court  Presiding  Judge  shall  appoint  assign  a 
replacement judge within thirty days whose district does not include the county of 
appropriate  venue.  If  an  active  district  judge  assigned  to  a  disciplinary  case 
becomes  a  retired,  senior,  or  former  judge,  he  or  she  may  be  assigned  by  the 
Presiding  Judge  to  continue  to  preside  in  the  case,  provided  the  judge  has  been 
placed  on  a  visiting  judge  list.  If  the  Presiding  Judge  decides  not  to  assign  the

originally assigned to preside in the case while an active judge. Any judge assigned 
under this Rule is not subject to objection under Chapter 74, Government Code. 

B.  

Transfer of Case: If the county of alleged venue is successfully challenged, the case 
shall be  transferred to  the  county  of proper venue.  If  the  case  is  transferred to a 
county in the assigned judge’s district, the judge must recuse himself or herself, 
unless  the  parties  waive  the  recusal  on  the  record.  In  the  event  of  recusal,  the 
Presiding  Judge  of  the  administrative  judicial  region  shall  assign  a  replacement 
judge whose district does not include the county of appropriate venue. If the case 
is transferred to a county outside the administrative judicial region of the Presiding 
Judge who made the assignment, the Presiding Judge of the administrative judicial 
region where the case is transferred shall oversee assignment for the case and the 
previously  assigned  judge  shall  continue  to  preside  in  the  case  unless  he  or  she 
makes a good cause objection to continued assignment, in which case the Presiding 
Judge shall assign a replacement judge whose district does not include the county

2) whether to accept an offer of settlement of a matter, except as otherwise authorized by 
law;

c) A lawyer  shall not assist or counsel a  client  to  engage in  conduct  that the  lawyer  knows is 
criminal or fraudulent. A lawyer may discuss the legal consequences of any proposed course of 
conduct with a client and may counsel and represent a client in connection with the making of a

f)  When  a  lawyer  knows  that  a  client  expects  representation  not  permitted  by  the  rules  of 
professional conduct or other law, the lawyer shall consult with the client regarding the relevant 
limitations on the lawyer's conduct.

Comment Paragraphs 1 – 11 Unchanged] 

ule 1.16. Clients with Diminished Capacity  

a)  When  a  client’s  capacity  to  make  adequately  considered  decisions  in  connection  with  a 
representation  is  diminished,  whether  because  of  minority,  mental  impairment,  or  for  another 
reason, the lawyer shall, as far as reasonably possible, maintain a normal client-lawyer relationship 
with the client.  

b)  When  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  that  the  client  has  diminished  capacity,  is  at  risk  of 
substantial physical, financial, or other harm unless action is taken, and cannot adequately act in 
the client’s own interest, the lawyer may take reasonably necessary protective action. Such action 
may include, but is not limited to, consulting with individuals or entities that have the ability to 
take action to protect the client and, in appropriate cases, seeking the appointment of a guardian 
ad litem, attorney ad litem, amicus attorney, or conservator, or submitting an information letter to 
a court with jurisdiction to initiate guardianship proceedings for the client.  

c) When taking protective action pursuant to (b), the lawyer may disclose the client’s confidential 
information  to  the  extent  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  is  necessary  to  protect  the  client’s 
interests.  

omment: 

. The normal client-lawyer relationship is based on the assumption that the client, when properly 
advised  and  assisted,  is  capable  of  making  decisions  about  important  matters.  However, 
maintaining the ordinary client-lawyer  relationship may not be possible when the client suffers 
from a mental impairment, is a minor, or for some other reason has a diminished capacity to make 
adequately considered decisions regarding representation. In particular, a severely incapacitated 
person  may  have  no  power  to  make  legally  binding  decisions.  Nevertheless,  a  client  with 
diminished  capacity  often  can  understand,  deliberate  on,  and  reach  conclusions  about  matters 
affecting the client's own well-being. For example, some people of advanced age are capable of 
handling routine financial matters but need special legal protection concerning major transactions. 
Also,  some  children  are  regarded  as  having  opinions  entitled  to  weight  in  legal  proceedings 
concerning their custody. 

 

 

2. In determining the extent of the client's diminished capacity, the lawyer should consider and 
balance such factors as the client's ability to articulate reasoning leading to a decision, variability 
of state of mind, and ability to appreciate consequences of a decision; the substantive fairness of a 
decision; and the consistency of a decision with the lawyer's knowledge of the client's long-term 
commitments and values. 

3. The fact that a client suffers from diminished capacity does not diminish the lawyer's obligation 
to  treat  the  client  with  attention  and  respect.  Even  if  the  client  has  a  guardian  or  other  legal 
representative, the lawyer should, as far as possible, accord the client the normal status of a client, 

  [

  (

  R

  (

  (

  C

  1

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 118particularly in maintaining communication.  If a guardian or other legal representative has been 
appointed  for  the  client,  however,  the  law  may  require  the  client's  lawyer  to  look  to  the 
representative for decisions on the client's behalf. If the lawyer represents the guardian as distinct 
from the ward and is aware that the guardian is acting adversely to the ward's interest, the lawyer 
may have an obligation to prevent or rectify the guardian's misconduct. 

4. The client may wish to have family members or other persons participate in discussions with 
the lawyer; however, paragraph (a) requires the lawyer to keep the client's interests foremost and, 
except when taking protective action authorized by paragraph (b), to look to the client, not the 
family members or other persons, to make decisions on the client's behalf. In matters involving a 
minor, whether the lawyer should look to the parents as natural guardians may depend on the type 
of proceeding or matter in which the lawyer is representing the minor. 

.  Paragraph  (b)  contains  a  non-exhaustive  list  of  actions  a  lawyer  may  take  in  certain 
circumstances to protect a client who does not have a guardian or other legal representative. Such 
actions could include consulting with family members, using a reconsideration period to permit 
clarification or improvement of circumstances, using voluntary surrogate decision-making tools 
such  as  existing  durable  powers  of  attorney,  or  consulting  with  support  groups,  professional 
services, adult-protective agencies, or other individuals or entities that have the ability to protect 
the  client.  In  taking  any  protective  action,  the  lawyer  should  be  guided  by  such  factors  as  the 
client's wishes and values to the extent known, the client's best interests, and the goals of intruding 
into  the  client's  decision-making  autonomy  to  the  least  extent  feasible,  maximizing  client 
capacities, and respecting the client's family and social connections. 

6. A client with diminished capacity also may cause or threaten physical, financial, or other harm 
to third parties. In such situations, the client's lawyer should consult applicable law to determine 
the appropriate response. 

7.  When  a  legal  representative  has  not  been  appointed,  the  lawyer  should  consider  whether  an 
appointment is reasonably necessary to protect the client's interests. Thus, for example, if a client 
with  diminished  capacity  has  substantial  property  that  should  be  sold  for  the  client's  benefit, 
effective  completion  of  the  transaction  may  require  appointment  of  a  legal  representative.  In 
addition,  applicable  law  provides  for  the  appointment  of  legal  representatives  in  certain 
circumstances. For example, the Texas Family Code prescribes when a guardian ad litem, attorney 
ad litem, or amicus attorney should be appointed in a suit affecting the parent-child relationship, 
and the Texas Probate Code prescribes when a guardian should be appointed for an incapacitated 
person.  In  many  circumstances,  however,  appointment  of  a  legal  representative  may  be  more 
expensive  or  traumatic  for  the  client  than  circumstances  in  fact  require.  Evaluation  of  such 
circumstances  is  a  matter  entrusted  to  the  lawyer's  professional  judgment.  In  considering 
alternatives, the lawyer should be aware of any law that requires the lawyer to advocate on the 
client's behalf for the action that imposes the least restriction. 
 

Taking Protective Action 

  5

 

 

 

 

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 119Disclosure of the Client's Condition 

. Disclosure of the client's diminished capacity could adversely affect the client's interests. For 
example,  raising  the  question  of  diminished  capacity  could,  in  some  circumstances,  lead  to 
proceedings  for  involuntary  commitment.  As  with  any  client-lawyer  relationship,  information 
relating to the representation of a client is confidential under Rule 1.05. However, when the lawyer 
is  taking  protective  action,  paragraph  (b)  of  this  Rule  permits  the  lawyer  to  make  necessary 
disclosures. Given the risks to the client of disclosure, paragraph (c) limits what the lawyer may 
disclose in consulting with other individuals or entities or in seeking the appointment of a legal 
representative. At the very least, the lawyer should determine whether it is likely that the person 
or entity consulted will act adversely to the client's interests before discussing matters related to 
the client.  

 

 

 

Emergency Legal Assistance 

9.  In  an  emergency  where  the  health,  safety  or  a  financial  interest  of  a  person  with  seriously 
diminished capacity is threatened with imminent and irreparable harm, a lawyer may take legal 
action on behalf of such a person even though the person is unable to establish a client-lawyer 
relationship  or  to  make  or  express  considered  judgments  about  the  matter,  when  the  person  or 
another acting in good faith on that person's behalf has consulted with the lawyer. Even in such an 
emergency,  however,  the  lawyer  should  not  act  unless  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  that  the 
person has no other lawyer, agent or other representative available. The lawyer should take legal 
action on behalf of the person only to the extent reasonably necessary to maintain the status quo 
or otherwise avoid imminent and irreparable harm. A lawyer who undertakes to represent a person 
in such an exigent situation has the same duties under these Rules as the lawyer would with respect 
to a client. 

10. A lawyer who acts on behalf of a person with seriously diminished capacity in an emergency 
should keep the confidences of the person as if dealing with a client, disclosing them only to the 
extent necessary to accomplish the intended protective action. The lawyer should disclose to any 
tribunal involved and to any other counsel involved the nature of his or her relationship with the 
person. The lawyer should take steps to regularize the relationship or implement other protective 
solutions  as  soon  as  possible.  Normally,  a  lawyer  would  not  seek  compensation  for  such 
emergency actions taken.

3. A lawyer's confidentiality obligations do not preclude a lawyer from securing confidential legal 
advice about the lawyer's responsibility to comply with these Rules. In most situations, disclosing 
or using confidential information to secure such advice will be impliedly authorized for the lawyer 
to  carry  out  the  representation.  Even  when  the  disclosure  or  use  is  not  impliedly  authorized, 
subparagraph  (c)(9)  allows  such  disclosure  or  use  because  of  the  importance  of  a  lawyer's 
compliance with these Rules.

Prevent Client Death by Suicide 

Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct 

ule 1.05. Confidentiality of Information 

a)  “Confidential  information”  includes  both  “privileged  information”  and  “unprivileged  client 
information.”  “Privileged  information”  refers  to  the  information  of  a  client  protected  by  the 
lawyer-client privilege of Rule 503 of the Texas Rules of Evidence or of Rule 503 of the Texas 
Rules of Criminal Evidence or by the principles of attorney-client privilege governed by Rule 501 
of the Federal Rules of Evidence for United States Courts and Magistrates. “Unprivileged client 
information”  means  all  information  relating  to  a  client  or  furnished  by  the  client,  other  than 
privileged  information,  acquired  by  the  lawyer  during  the  course  of  or  by  reason  of  the 
representation of the client. 

b) Except as permitted by paragraphs (c) and (d), or as required by paragraphs (e) and (f), a lawyer 
shall not knowingly: 
 

(1) Reveal confidential information of a client or a former client to: 

ii) anyone else, other than the client, the client's representatives, or the members, 
associates, or employees of the lawyer's law firm. 

  (

(i) a person that the client has instructed is not to receive the information; or 

(2)  Use  confidential  information  of  a  client  to  the  disadvantage  of  the  client  unless  the 
client consents after consultation. 

3) Use confidential information of a former client to the disadvantage of the former client 
after the representation is concluded unless the former client consents after consultation or 
the confidential information has become generally known. 

4)  Use  privileged  information  of  a  client  for  the  advantage  of  the  lawyer  or  of  a  third 
person, unless the client consents after consultation. 

c) A lawyer may reveal confidential information: 

(10) When the lawyer has reason to believe it is necessary to do so in order to prevent the 
client from dying by suicide.

Limited Pro Bono Legal Services 

Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct 

ule 6.05. Conflict of Interest Exceptions for Nonprofit and Limited Pro Bono Legal Services 

a)  The  conflicts  of  interest  limitations  on  representation  in  Rules  1.06,  1.07,  and  1.09  do  not 
prohibit a lawyer from providing, or offering to provide, limited pro bono legal services unless the 
lawyer knows, at the time the services are provided, that the lawyer would be prohibited by those 
limitations from providing the services. 

b)  Lawyers  in  a  firm  with  a  lawyer  providing,  or  offering  to  provide,  limited  pro  bono  legal 
services shall not be prohibited by the imputation provisions of Rules 1.06, 1.07, and 1.09 from 
representing a client if that lawyer does not: 
 

(1) disclose confidential information of the pro bono client to the lawyers in the firm; or 

(2) maintain such information in a manner that would render it accessible to the lawyers in 
the firm. 

c) The eligibility information that an applicant is required to provide when applying for free legal 
services or limited pro bono legal services from a program described in subparagraph (d)(1) by 
itself will not create a conflict of interest if: 
 

(1) the eligibility information is not material to the legal matter; or 

(2)  the  applicant’s  provision  of  the  eligibility  information  was  conditioned  on  the 
applicant’s informed consent that providing this information would not by itself prohibit a 
representation of another client adverse to the applicant. 

d) As used in this Rule, “limited pro bono legal services” means legal services that are: 

(1)  provided  through  a  pro  bono  or  assisted  pro  se  program  sponsored  by  a  court,  bar 
association, accredited law school, or nonprofit legal services program; 

(2) short-term services such as legal advice or other brief assistance with pro se documents 
or  transactions,  provided  either  in  person  or  by  phone,  hotline,  internet,  or  video 
conferencing; and 

(3) provided without any expectation of extended representation of the limited assistance 
client or of receiving any legal fees in that matter. 

e) As used in this Rule, a lawyer is not “in a firm” with other lawyers solely because the lawyer 
provides limited pro bono legal services with the other lawyers.

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 124. Nonprofit legal services organizations, courts, law schools, and bar associations have programs 
through  which  lawyers  provide  short-term  limited  legal  services  typically  to  help  low-income 
persons  address  their  legal  problems  without  further  representation  by  the  lawyers.  In  these 
programs, such as legal-advice hotlines, advice-only clinics, disaster legal services, or programs 
providing  guidance  to  self-represented  litigants,  a  client-lawyer  relationship  is  established,  but 
there is no expectation that the relationship will continue beyond the limited consultation and there 
is no expectation that the lawyer will receive any compensation from the client for the services. 
These programs are normally operated under circumstances in which it is not feasible for a lawyer 
to check for conflicts of interest as is normally required before undertaking a representation.   

.  Application  of  the  conflict  of  interest  rules  has  deterred  lawyers  from  participating  in  these 
programs, preventing persons of limited means from obtaining much needed legal services. To 
facilitate the provision of free legal services to the public, this Rule creates narrow exceptions to 
the  conflict  of  interest  rules  for  limited  pro  bono  legal  services.  These  exceptions  are  justified 
because the limited and short-term nature of the legal services rendered in such programs reduces 
the risk that conflicts of interest will arise between clients represented through the program and 
other clients of the lawyer or the lawyer’s firm. Other than the limited exceptions set forth in this 
Rule, a lawyer remains subject to all applicable conflict of interest rules. 

cope of Representation 

. A lawyer who provides services pursuant to this Rule should secure the client's consent to the 
limited scope of the representation after explaining to the client what that means in the particular 
circumstance.  See Rule 1.02(b). If a short-term limited representation would not be fully sufficient 
under the circumstances, the lawyer may offer advice to the client but should also advise the client 
of the need for further assistance of counsel. See Rule 1.03(b). 

onflicts and the Lawyer Providing Limited Pro Bono Legal Services 

. Paragraph (a) exempts compliance with Rules 1.06, 1.07, and 1.09 for a lawyer providing limited 
pro bono legal services unless the lawyer actually knows that the representation presents a conflict 
of interest for the lawyer or for another lawyer in the lawyer's firm. A lawyer providing limited 
pro bono legal services is not obligated to perform a conflicts check before undertaking the limited 
representation.  If,  after  commencing  a  representation  in  accordance  with  this  Rule,  a  lawyer 
undertakes to represent the client in the matter on an ongoing basis or the lawyer charges a fee for 
the legal assistance, the exceptions provided by this Rule no longer apply. 

mputation of Conflicts 

. Paragraph (b) provides that a conflict of interest arising from a lawyer’s representation covered 
by this Rule will not be imputed to the lawyers in the pro bono lawyer’s firm if the pro bono lawyer 
complies with subparagraphs (b)(1) and (2).

Comment: 

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 1256. To prevent a conflict of interest arising from limited pro bono legal services from being imputed 
to the other lawyers in the firm, subparagraph (b)(1) requires that the pro bono lawyer not disclose 
to any lawyer in the firm any confidential information related to the pro bono representation.  

. Subparagraph (b)(2) covers the retention of documents or other memorialization of confidential 
information, such as the pro bono lawyer’s notes, whether in paper or electronic form. To prevent 
imputation, a pro bono lawyer who retains confidential information is required by subparagraph 
(b)(2) to segregate and store it in such a way that no other lawyer in the pro bono lawyer’s firm 
can access it, either physically or electronically.  

ligibility Information 

. Paragraph (c) recognizes the unusual and uniquely sensitive personal information that applicants 
for free legal assistance may be required to provide. Organizations that receive funding to provide 
free legal assistance to low-income clients are generally required, as a condition of their funding, 
to screen the applicants for eligibility and to document eligibility for services paid for by those 
funding sources. Unlike other lawyers, law firms, and legal departments, these organizations ask 
for confidential information to determine an applicant’s eligibility for free legal assistance and are 
required to maintain records of such eligibility determinations for potential audit by their funding 
sources. Required eligibility information typically includes income, asset values, marital status, 
citizenship or immigration status, and other facts the applicant may consider sensitive. Paragraph 
(c) provides a limited exception to the conflict of interest provisions contained in Rules 1.06, 1.07, 
and 1.09 that apply when an applicant provides such information but no legal services are provided. 
This exception is available only in the two situations described in subparagraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2).  

. The first situation where the paragraph (c) exception is available is where none of the eligibility 
information is material to an issue in the legal matter. Alternatively, under subparagraph (c)(2), if 
the applicant provided confidential information after giving informed consent that the eligibility 
information would not prohibit the persons or entities identified in the consent from representing 
any  other  present  or  future  client,  then  the  eligibility  information  alone  will  not  prohibit  the 
representation. The lawyer should document the receipt of such informed consent, though a formal 
writing is not required. What constitutes informed consent is discussed in the comments to Rule 
1.06. 

0. Rule 1.05 continues to apply to the use or disclosure of all confidential information provided 
during an intake interview. Similarly, Rule 1.09 continues to apply to the representation of a person 
in a matter adverse to the applicant. Notably, Rule 1.05(c)(2) permits a lawyer to use or disclose 
information provided during an intake interview if the applicant consents after consultation to such 
use or disclosure, and Rule 1.09(a) excludes from its restrictions the representation of a person 
adverse to the applicant in the same or a substantially related matter if the applicant consents to 
such a representation.

in subparagraph (d)(1), regardless of the nature and amount of support provided. Some programs 
may be jointly sponsored by more than one of the listed sponsor types. 

2. The second element of “limited pro bono legal services,” set forth in subparagraph (d)(2), is 
designed to ensure that the services offered are so limited in time and scope that there is little risk 
that conflicts will arise between clients represented through the program and other clients of the 
lawyer or the lawyer’s firm. 

3. The third element of the definition, set forth in subparagraph (d)(3), is that the services are 
offered and provided without any expectation of either extended representation or the collection 
of legal fees in the matter. Before agreeing to proceed in the representation beyond “limited pro 
bono legal services,” the lawyer should evaluate the potential conflicts of interest that may arise 
from the representation as with any other representation. Likewise, the exceptions in paragraphs 
(a) and (b) do not apply if the lawyer expects to collect any legal fees in the limited assistance 
matter. 

irm 

4. Lawyers are not deemed to be part of the same firm simply because they volunteer through the 
same pro bono program. Nor will the personal prohibition of a lawyer participating in a pro bono 
program be imputed to other lawyers participating in the program solely by reason of that volunteer 
connection.

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 127Information About Legal Services (Lawyer Advertising and Solicitation) 

Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct 

VII. INFORMATION ABOUT LEGAL SERVICES 

a)  A  lawyer  shall  not  make  or  sponsor  a  false  or  misleading  communication  about  the 
qualifications or services of a lawyer or law firm. Information about legal services must be truthful 
and  nondeceptive.  A  communication  is  false  or  misleading  if  it  contains  a  material 
misrepresentation of fact or law, or omits a fact necessary to make the statement considered as a 
whole not materially misleading. A statement is misleading if there is a substantial likelihood that 
it will lead a reasonable person to formulate a specific conclusion about the lawyer or the lawyer’s 
services for which there is no reasonable factual  foundation, or if the statement is substantially 
likely to create unjustified expectations about the results the lawyer can achieve. 

1) An “advertisement” is a communication substantially motivated by pecuniary gain that 
is made by or on behalf of a lawyer to members of the public in general, which offers or 
promotes  legal  services  under  circumstances  where  the  lawyer  neither  knows  nor 
reasonably should know that the recipients need legal services in particular matters. 

2)  A  “solicitation  communication”  is  a  communication  substantially  motivated  by 
pecuniary gain that is made by or on behalf of a lawyer to a specific person who has not 
sought the lawyer’s advice or services, which reasonably can be understood as offering to 
provide legal services that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know the person needs 
in a particular matter.   

  (

  (

b) This Rule governs all communications about a lawyer’s services, including advertisements and 
solicitation communications. For purposes of Rules 7.01 to 7.06: 

c) Lawyers may practice law under a trade name that is not false or misleading. A law firm name 
may include the names of current members of the firm and of deceased or retired members of the 
firm, or of a predecessor firm, if there has been a succession in the firm identity. The name of a 
lawyer holding a public office shall not be used in the name of a law firm, or in communications 
on  its  behalf,  during  any  substantial  period  in  which  the  lawyer  is  not  actively  and  regularly 
practicing with the firm. A law firm with an office in more than one jurisdiction may use the same 
name or other professional designation in each jurisdiction, but identification of the lawyers in an 
office of the firm shall indicate the jurisdictional limitations on those not licensed to practice in 
the jurisdiction where the office is located. 

d)  A  statement  or  disclaimer  required  by  these  Rules  shall  be  sufficiently  clear  that  it  can 
reasonably  be  understood  by  an  ordinary  person  and  made  in  each  language  used  in  the 
communication. A statement that a language is spoken or understood does not require a statement 
or disclaimer in that language.

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 128(e) A lawyer shall not state or imply that the lawyer can achieve results in the representation by 
unlawful use of violence or means that violate these Rules or other law. 

f) A lawyer may state or imply that the lawyer practices in a partnership or other business entity 
only when that is accurate. 

g) If a lawyer who advertises the amount of a verdict secured on behalf of a client knows that the 
verdict was later reduced or reversed, or that the case was settled for a lesser amount, the lawyer 
must state in each advertisement of the verdict, with equal or greater prominence, the amount of 
money that was ultimately received by the client. 

 
1.  This  Rule  governs  all  communications  about  a  lawyer’s  services,  including  firm  names, 
letterhead, and professional designations. Whatever means are used  to make known a  lawyer’s 
services, statements about them must be truthful and not misleading.  As subsequent provisions 
make  clear,  some  rules  apply  only  to  “advertisements”  or  “solicitation  communications.”  A 
statement  about  a  lawyer’s  services  falls  within  those  categories  only  if  it  was  “substantially 
motivated by  pecuniary  gain,” which means that pecuniary  gain was a substantial  factor  in the 
making of the statement. 

isleading Truthful Statements 

. Misleading truthful statements are prohibited by this Rule. For example, a truthful statement is 
misleading if presented in a way that creates a substantial likelihood that a reasonable person would 
believe the lawyer’s communication requires that person to take further action when, in fact, no 
action is required.   

omment: 

  C

se of Actors 

. The use of an actor to portray a lawyer in a commercial is misleading if there is a substantial 
likelihood that a reasonable person will conclude that the actor is the lawyer who is offering to 
provide  legal  services.  Whether  a  disclaimer—such  as  a  statement  that  the  depiction  is  a 
“dramatization” or shows an “actor portraying a lawyer”—is sufficient to make the use of an actor 
not misleading depends on a careful assessment of the relevant facts and circumstances, including 
whether  the  disclaimer  is  conspicuous  and  clear.  Similar  issues  arise  with  respect  to  actors 
portraying clients in commercials. Such a communication is misleading if there is a substantial 
likelihood that a reasonable person will reach erroneous conclusions based on the dramatization. 

ntent to Refer Prospective Clients to Another Firm 

.  A  communication  offering  legal  services  is  misleading  if,  at  the  time  a  lawyer  makes  the 
communication,  the  lawyer  knows  or  reasonably  should  know,  but  fails  to  disclose,  that  a 
prospective client responding to the communication is likely to be referred to a lawyer in another 
firm.

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 129njustified Expectations 

. A communication is misleading if there is a substantial likelihood that it will create unjustified 
expectations  on  the  part  of  prospective  clients  about  the  results  that  can  be  achieved.  A 
communication that truthfully reports results obtained by a lawyer on behalf of clients or former 
clients may be misleading if presented so as to lead a reasonable person to form an unjustified 
expectation  that  the  same  results  could  be  obtained  for  other  clients  in  similar  matters  without 
reference to the specific factual and legal circumstances of each client’s case. Depending on the 
facts and  circumstances, the inclusion of an  appropriate disclaimer or qualifying language may 
preclude a finding that a statement is likely to mislead the public.   

equired Statements and Disclaimers 

. A statement or disclaimer required by these Rules must be presented clearly and conspicuously 
such  that  it  is  likely  to  be  noticed  and  reasonably  understood  by  an  ordinary  person.  In  radio, 
television, and Internet advertisements, verbal statements must be spoken in a manner that their 
content  is  easily  intelligible,  and  written  statements  must  appear  in  a  size  and  font,  and  for  a 
sufficient length of time, that a viewer can easily see and read the statements.  

nsubstantiated Claims and Comparisons 

. An unsubstantiated claim about a lawyer’s or law firm’s services or fees, or an unsubstantiated 
comparison of the lawyer’s or law firm’s services or fees with those of other lawyers or law firms, 
may be misleading if presented with such specificity as to lead a reasonable person to conclude 
that the comparison or claim can be substantiated.  

ublic Education Activities 

.  As  used  in  these  Rules,  the  terms  “advertisement”  and  “solicitation  communication”  do  not 
include statements made by a lawyer that are not substantially motivated by pecuniary gain. Thus, 
communications which merely inform members of the public about their legal rights and about 
legal services that are available from public or charitable legal-service organizations, or similar 
non-profit entities, are permissible, provided they are not misleading. These types of statements 
may  be  made  in  a  variety  of  ways,  including  community  legal  education  sessions,  know-your-
rights brochures, public service announcements on television and radio, billboards, information 
posted on organizational social media sites, and outreach to low-income groups in the community, 
such as in migrant labor housing camps, domestic violence shelters, disaster resource centers, and 
dilapidated apartment complexes.

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 130Past Success and Results 

0. A communication about legal services may be misleading because it omits an important fact 
or tells only part of the truth. A lawyer who knows that an advertised verdict was later reduced or 
reversed, or that the case was settled for a lesser amount, must disclose those facts with equal or 
greater prominence to avoid creating unjustified expectations on the part of potential clients. A 
lawyer may claim credit for a prior judgement or settlement only if the lawyer played a substantial 
role in obtaining that result. This standard is satisfied if the lawyer served as lead counsel or was 
primarily responsible for the settlement. In other cases, whether the standard is met depends on 
the  facts.  A  lawyer  who  did  not  play  a  substantial  role  in  obtaining  an  advertised  judgment  or 
settlement is subject to discipline for misrepresenting the lawyer’s experience and, in some cases, 
for creating unjustified expectations about the results the lawyer can achieve. 

1. It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, 
deceit  or  misrepresentation.  See  Rule  8.04(a)(3);  see  also  Rule  8.04(a)(5)  (prohibiting 
communications stating or implying an ability to improperly influence a government agency or 
official). 

a) An advertisement of legal services shall publish the name of a lawyer who is responsible for 
the content of the advertisement and identify the lawyer’s primary practice location. 

1) a lawyer who has been awarded a Certificate of Special Competence by the Texas Board 
of Legal Specialization in the area so advertised, may state with respect to each such area, 
“Board Certified, area of specialization -- Texas Board of Legal Specialization”; and 

2)  a  lawyer  who  is  a  member  of  an  organization  the  name  of  which  implies  that  its 
members  possess  special  competence,  or  who  has  been  certified  or  designated  by  an 
organization  as  possessing  special  competence  in  a  field  of  practice,  may  include  a 
factually accurate, non-misleading statement of such membership or certification, but only 
if that organization has been accredited by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization as a 
bona fide organization that admits to membership or grants certification only on the basis 
of  published  criteria  which  the  Texas  Board  of  Legal  Specialization  has  established  as 
required for such certification. 

  (

  (

b)  A  lawyer  who  advertises  may  communicate  that  the  lawyer  does  or  does  not  practice  in 
particular  fields  of  law,  but  shall  not  include  a  statement  that  the  lawyer  has  been  certified  or 
designated by an organization as possessing special competence or a statement that the lawyer is 
a  member  of  an  organization  the  name  of  which  implies  that  its  members  possess  special 
competence, except that:

basis, the advertisement must state whether the client will be obligated to pay for other expenses, 
such as the costs of litigation. 

d) A lawyer who advertises a specific fee or range of fees for an identified service shall conform 
to the advertised fee or range of fees for the period during which the advertisement is reasonably 
expected to be in circulation or otherwise expected to be effective in attracting clients, unless the 
advertisement  specifies  a  shorter  period.  However,  a  lawyer  is  not  bound  to  conform  to  the 
advertised fee or range of fees for a period of more than one year after the date of publication, 
unless the lawyer has expressly promised to do so. 

omment:  

.  These  Rules  permit  the  dissemination  of  information  that  is  not  false  or  misleading  about  a 
lawyer’s or law firm’s name, address, e-mail address, website, and telephone number; the kinds of 
services the lawyer will undertake; the basis on which the lawyer’s fees are determined, including 
prices  for  specific  services  and  payment  and  credit  arrangements;  a  lawyer’s  foreign  language 
abilities; names of references and, with their consent, names of clients regularly represented; and 
other similar information that might invite the attention of those seeking legal assistance. 

ommunications about Fields of Practice 

. Lawyers often benefit from associating with other lawyers for the development of practice areas. 
Thus, practitioners have established associations, organizations, institutes, councils, and practice 
groups to promote, discuss, and develop areas of the law, and to advance continuing education and 
skills  development.  While  such  activities  are  generally  encouraged,  participating  lawyers  must 
refrain from creating or using designations, titles, or certifications which are false or misleading. 
A lawyer shall not advertise that the lawyer is a member of an organization whose name implies 
that  members  possess  special  competence,  unless  the  organization  meets the  standards  of  Rule 
7.02(b). Merely stating a designated class of membership, such as Associate, Master, Barrister, 
Diplomate, or Advocate, does not, in itself, imply special competence violative of these Rules. 

. Paragraph (b) of this Rule permits a lawyer to communicate that the lawyer does or does not 
practice  in  particular  areas  of  law.  A  lawyer  is  generally  permitted  to  state  that  the  lawyer 
“concentrates in” or is a “specialist,” practices a “specialty,” or “specializes in” particular fields 
based on the lawyer’s experience, specialized training or education, but such communications are 
subject to the “false and misleading” standard applied by Rule 7.01 to communications concerning 
a lawyer’s services. 

.  The  Patent  and  Trademark  Office  has  a  long-established  policy  of  designating  lawyers 
practicing  before  the  Office.  The  designation  of  Admiralty  practice  also  has  a  long  historical 
tradition associated with maritime commerce and the federal courts. A lawyer’s communications 
about these practice areas are not prohibited by this Rule.

such certification is granted by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization or by an organization that 
applies standards of experience, knowledge and proficiency to ensure that a lawyer’s recognition 
as a specialist is meaningful and reliable, if the organization is accredited by the Texas Board of 
Legal Specialization. To ensure that consumers can obtain access to useful information about an 
organization granting certification, the name of the certifying organization must be included in any 
communication regarding the certification. 

1)  “Regulated  telephone,  social  media,  or  other  electronic  contact”  means  telephone, 
social media, or electronic communication initiated by a lawyer, or by a person acting on 
behalf  of  a  lawyer,  that  involves  communication  in  a  live  or  electronically  interactive 
manner. 

2)  A  lawyer  “solicits”  employment  by  making  a  “solicitation  communication,”  as  that 
term is defined in Rule 7.01(b)(2). 

b)  A  lawyer  shall  not  solicit  through  in-person  contact,  or  through  regulated  telephone,  social 
media, or other electronic contact, professional employment from a non-client, unless the target of 
the solicitation is: 
 

(1) another lawyer; 

(2) a person who has a family, close personal, or prior business or professional relationship 
with the lawyer; or 

(3) a person who is known by the lawyer to be an experienced user of the type of legal 
services involved for business matters. 

c) A lawyer shall not send, deliver, or transmit, or knowingly permit or cause another person to 
send, deliver, or transmit, a communication that involves coercion, duress, overreaching, 
intimidation, or undue influence.

omment: 

olicitation by Public and Charitable Legal Services Organizations 

.  Rule  7.01  provides  that  a  “‘solicitation  communication’  is  a  communication  substantially 
motivated by pecuniary gain.”  Therefore, the ban on solicitation imposed by paragraph (b) of this 
Rule does not apply to the activities of lawyers  working  for public  or  charitable legal services 
organizations.

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 1342. A lawyer’s communication is not a solicitation if it is directed to the general public, such as 
through a billboard, an Internet banner advertisement, a website or a television commercial, or if 
it is made in response to a request for information, including an electronic search for information. 
The terms “advertisement” and “solicitation communication” are defined in Rule 7.01(b). 

he Risk of Overreaching 

. A potential for overreaching  exists  when  a  lawyer,  seeking  pecuniary gain,  solicits  a person 
known to be in need of legal services via in-person or regulated telephone, social media, or other 
electronic contact. These forms of contact subject a person to the private importuning of the trained 
advocate in a direct interpersonal encounter. The person, who may already feel overwhelmed by 
the circumstances giving rise to the need for legal services, may find it difficult to fully evaluate 
all available alternatives with reasoned judgment and appropriate self‑interest in the face of the 
lawyer’s presence and insistence upon an immediate response. The situation is fraught with the 
possibility of undue influence, intimidation, and overreaching. 

. The potential for overreaching that is inherent in in-person or regulated telephone, social media, 
or  other  electronic  contact  justifies  their  prohibition,  since  lawyers  have  alternative  means  of 
conveying necessary information. In particular, communications can be sent by regular mail or e-
mail, or by other means that do not involve communication in a live or electronically interactive 
manner. These forms of communications make it possible for the public to be informed about the 
need  for  legal  services,  and  about  the  qualifications  of  available  lawyers  and  law  firms,  with 
minimal risk of overwhelming a person’s judgment. 

.  The  contents  of  live  person-to-person  contact  can  be  disputed  and  may  not  be  subject  to 
third‑party scrutiny. Consequently, they are much more likely to approach (and occasionally cross) 
the dividing line between accurate representations and those that are false and misleading. 

argeted Mail Solicitation 

. Regular mail or e-mail targeted to a person that offers to provide legal services that the lawyer 
knows  or  reasonably  should  know  the  person  needs  in  a  particular  matter  is  a  solicitation 
communication within the meaning of Rule 7.01(b)(2), but is not prohibited by subsection (b) of 
this Rule.  Unlike in-person and electronically interactive communication by “regulated telephone, 
social media, or other electronic contact,” regular mail and e-mail can easily be ignored, set aside, 
or reconsidered. There is a diminished likelihood of overreaching because no lawyer is physically 
present  and  there  is  evidence  in  tangible  or  electronic  form  of  what  was  communicated.    See 
Shapero v. Kentucky B. Ass'n, 486 U.S. 466 (1988). 

ersonal, Family, Business, and Professional Relationships 

. There is a substantially reduced likelihood that a lawyer would engage in overreaching against 
a  former  client,  a  person  with  whom  the  lawyer  has  a  close  personal,  family,  business  or 
professional relationship, or in situations in which the lawyer is motivated by considerations other 
than pecuniary gain. Nor is there a serious potential for overreaching when the person contacted is 
a lawyer or is known to routinely use the type of legal services involved for business purposes.

who regularly engage business, employment law, or intellectual property lawyers; small business 
proprietors who routinely hire lawyers for lease or contract issues; and other people who routinely 
retain lawyers for business transactions or formations.  

onstitutionally Protected Activities 

. Paragraph (b) is not intended to prohibit a lawyer from participating in constitutionally protected 
activities of public or  charitable  legal-service  organizations  or bona fide political,  social, civic, 
fraternal, employee, or trade organizations whose purposes include providing or recommending 
legal services to their members or beneficiaries. See In re Primus, 436 U.S. 412 (1978). 

roup and Prepaid Legal Services Plans 

. This Rule does not prohibit a lawyer from contacting representatives of organizations or entities 
that may be interested in establishing a group or prepaid legal plan for their members, insureds, 
beneficiaries,  or  other  third  parties.  Such  communications  may  provide  information  about  the 
availability and terms of a plan which the lawyer or lawyer's firm is willing to offer. This form of 
communication is not directed to persons who are seeking legal services for themselves. Rather, it 
is usually addressed to a fiduciary seeking a supplier of legal services for others, who may, if they 
choose,  become  prospective  clients  of  the  lawyer.  Under  these  circumstances,  the  information 
transmitted is functionally similar to the types of advertisements permitted by these Rules. 

esignation as an Advertisement 

0. For purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this Rule, a communication is rebuttably presumed to be 
“plainly  marked  or  clearly  designated  an  ‘ADVERTISEMENT’”  if:    (a)  in  the  case  of  a  letter 
transmitted in an envelope, both the outside of the envelope and the first page of the letter state the 
word  “ADVERTISEMENT”  in  bold  face  all-capital  letters  that  are  3/8”  high  on  a  uncluttered 
background;  (b)  in  the  case  of  an  e-mail  message,  the  first  word  in  the  subject  line  is 
“ADVERTISEMENT” in all capital letters; and (c) in the case of a text message or message on 
social media, the first word in the message is “ADVERTISEMENT” in all capital letters. 

aying Others to Recommend a Lawyer  

1. This Rule allows a lawyer to pay for advertising and communications, including the usual costs 
of printed or online directory listings or advertisements, television and radio airtime, domain-name 
registrations,  sponsorship  fees,  and  group  advertising.  A  lawyer  may  compensate  employees, 
agents, and vendors who are engaged to provide marketing or client development services, such 
as publicists, public-relations personnel, business-development staff, television and radio station 
employees or spokespersons, and website designers. 

2. This Rule permits lawyers to give nominal gifts as an expression of appreciation to a person 
for recommending the lawyer’s services or referring a prospective client. The gift may not be more 
than a token item as might be given for holidays, or other ordinary social hospitality. A  gift is 

  C

  1

Misc. Docket No. 20-9114Page 136prohibited if offered or given in consideration of any promise, agreement, or understanding that 
such a gift would be forthcoming or that referrals would be made or encouraged in the future. 

3. A lawyer may pay others for generating client leads, such as  Internet-based client leads, as 
long as the lead generator does not recommend the lawyer, any payment to the lead generator is 
consistent  with  Rule  5.04(a)  (division  of  fees  with  nonlawyers)  and  Rule  5.04(c)  (nonlawyer 
interference  with  the  professional  independence  of  the  lawyer),  and  the  lead  generator’s 
communications are consistent with Rule 7.01 (communications concerning a lawyer’s services). 
To comply with Rule 7.01, a lawyer must not pay a lead generator that states, implies, or creates a 
reasonable impression that it is recommending the lawyer, is making the referral without payment 
from the lawyer, or has analyzed a person’s legal problems when determining which lawyer should 
receive the referral. See also Rule 5.03 (duties of lawyers and law firms with respect to the conduct 
of nonlawyers); Rule 8.04(a)(1) (duty to avoid violating the Rules through the acts of another). 

harges of and Referrals by a Legal Services Plan or Lawyer Referral Service 

4. A lawyer may pay the usual charges of a legal services plan or a not-for-profit or qualified 
lawyer referral service. A legal service plan is a prepaid or group legal service plan or a similar 
delivery  system  that  assists  people  who  seek  to  secure  legal  representation.  A  lawyer  referral 
service, on the other hand, is any organization that holds itself out to the public as a lawyer referral 
service.  Qualified  referral  services  are  consumer-oriented  organizations  that  provide  unbiased 
referrals to  lawyers  with  appropriate  experience in the subject matter of the representation  and 
afford  other  client  protections,  such  as  complaint  procedures  or  malpractice  insurance 
requirements.   

5. A lawyer who accepts assignments or referrals from a legal service plan or referrals from a 
lawyer referral service must act reasonably to assure that the activities of the plan or service are 
compatible  with  the  lawyer's  professional  obligations.  Legal  service  plans  and  lawyer  referral 
services may communicate with the public, but such communication must be in conformity with 
these  Rules.  Thus,  advertising  must  not  be  false  or  misleading,  as  would  be  the  case  if  the 
communications of a group advertising program or a group legal services plan would mislead the 
public to think that it was a lawyer referral service sponsored by a state agency or bar association. 

eciprocal Referral Arrangements 

6. A lawyer does not violate paragraph (e) of this Rule by agreeing to refer clients to another 
lawyer or nonlawyer professional, so long as the reciprocal referral agreement is not exclusive, the 
client is informed of  the referral  agreement, and  the  lawyer  exercises  independent professional 
judgment  in  making  the  referral.  Reciprocal  referral  agreements  should  not  be  of  indefinite 
duration and should be reviewed periodically to determine whether they comply with these Rules. 
A lawyer should not enter into a reciprocal referral agreement with another lawyer that includes a 
division of fees without determining that the agreement complies with Rule 1.04(f).

ule 7.04. Filing Requirements for Advertisements and Solicitation Communications 

a) Except as exempt under Rule 7.05, a lawyer shall file with the Advertising Review Committee, 
State Bar of Texas, no later than ten (10) days after the date of dissemination of an advertisement 
of legal services, or ten (10) days after the date of a solicitation communication sent by any means: 

1)  a  copy  of  the  advertisement  or  solicitation  communication  (including  packaging  if 
applicable) in the form in which it appeared or will appear upon dissemination; 

2) a completed lawyer advertising and solicitation communication application; and 

3) payment to the State Bar of Texas of a fee authorized by the Board of Directors. 

  (

  (

b) If requested by the Advertising Review Committee, a lawyer shall promptly submit information 
to substantiate statements or representations made or implied in an advertisement or solicitation 
communication. 

c) A lawyer who desires to secure pre-approval of an advertisement or solicitation communication 
may submit to the Advertising Review Committee, not fewer than thirty (30) days prior to the date 
of  first  dissemination,  the  material  specified  in  paragraph  (a),  except  that  in  the  case  of  an 
advertisement or solicitation communication that has not yet been produced, the documentation 
will consist of a proposed text, production script, or other description, including details about the 
illustrations, actions, events, scenes, and background sounds that will be depicted. A finding of 
noncompliance by the Advertising Review Committee is not binding in a disciplinary proceeding 
or action, but a finding of compliance is binding in favor of the submitting lawyer as to all materials 
submitted  for  pre-approval  if  the  lawyer  fairly  and  accurately  described  the  advertisement  or 
solicitation  communication  that  was  later  produced.  A  finding  of  compliance  is  admissible 
evidence if offered by a party. 

omment:  

. The Advertising Review Committee shall report to the appropriate disciplinary authority any 
lawyer  whom,  based  on  filings  with  the  Committee,  it  reasonably  believes  disseminated  a 
communication that violates Rules 7.01, 7.02, or 7.03, or otherwise engaged in conduct that raises 
a substantial question as to that lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other 
respects. See Rule 8.03(a). 

ultiple Solicitation Communications 

. Paragraph (a) does not require that a lawyer submit a copy of each written solicitation letter a 
lawyer sends. If the same form letter is sent to several persons, only a representative sample of 
each form letter, along with a representative sample of the envelopes used to mail the letters, need 
be filed.

2. While the entire website of a lawyer or law firm must be compliant with Rules 7.01 and 7.02, 
the only material on the website that may need to be filed pursuant to this Rule is the contents of 
the  homepage.    However,  even  a  homepage  does  not  need  to  be  filed  if  the  contents  of  the

by  that  lawyer  personally  or  by  another  person  whom  the  lawyer  ordered,  encouraged,  or 
knowingly permitted to engage in such conduct. 

b)  A  lawyer  shall  not  accept  or  continue  employment  in  a  matter  when  the  lawyer  knows  or 
reasonably  should  know  that  employment  was  procured  by  conduct  prohibited  by  Rules  7.01 
through 7.03, 8.04(a)(2), or 8.04(a)(9), engaged in by another person or entity that is a shareholder, 
partner, or member of, an associate in, or of counsel to that lawyer's firm; or by any other person 
whom the foregoing persons or entities ordered, encouraged, or knowingly permitted to engage in 
such conduct. 

c) A lawyer who has not violated paragraph (a) or (b) in accepting employment in a matter shall 
not continue employment in that matter once the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that 
the person procuring the lawyer's employment in the matter engaged in, or ordered, encouraged, 
or  knowingly  permitted  another  to  engage  in,  conduct  prohibited  by  Rules  7.01  through  7.03, 
8.04(a)(2), or 8.04(a)(9) in connection with the matter unless nothing of value is given thereafter 
in return for that employment.

ersonal Disqualification 

 

2.  Paragraph  (a)  addresses  situations  where  the  lawyer  in  question  has  violated  the  specified 
advertising rules or other provisions dealing with serious  crimes  and barratry. The Rule makes 
clear  that  the  offending  lawyer  cannot  accept  or  continue  to  provide  representation.  This 
prohibition  also  applies  if  the  lawyer  ordered,  encouraged,  or  knowingly  permitted  another  to 
violate the Rules in question.

3. Second, paragraph (b) addresses whether other lawyers in a firm can provide representation if a 
person or entity in the firm has violated the specified advertising rules or other provisions dealing 
with serious crimes and barratry, or has ordered, encouraged, or knowingly permitted another to 
engage  in  such  conduct.  The  Rule  clearly  indicates  that  the  other  lawyers  cannot  provide 
representation if they knew or reasonably should have known that the employment was procured 
by  conduct  prohibited  by  the  stated  Rules.  This  effectively  means  that,  in  such  cases,  the 
disqualification that arises from a violation of the advertising rules and other specified provisions 
is imputed to other members of the firm.

4. Paragraph (c) deals with situations where a lawyer knows or reasonably should know that a case 
referred to the lawyer or the lawyer’s law firm was procured by violation of the advertising rules 
or  other  specified  provisions.  The  Rule  makes  clear  that,  even  if  the  lawyer’s  conduct  did  not 
violate paragraph (a) or (b), the lawyer can continue to provide representation only if the lawyer 
does not pay anything of value, such as a referral fee, to the person making the referral.

Federal Court or Federal Agency Discipline 

Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct 

ule 8.03. Reporting Professional Misconduct 

A  lawyer  who  has  been  disciplined  by  the  attorney-regulatory  agency  of  another 
jurisdiction,  or  by  a  federal  court  or  federal  agency,  must  notify  the  chief  disciplinary 
counsel within 30 days of the date of the order or judgment. The notice must include a copy 
of the order or judgment. For purposes of this paragraph, “discipline” by a federal court or 
federal agency  means a  public reprimand,  suspension,  or disbarment; the term  does not 
include a letter of “warning” or “admonishment” or a similar advisory by a federal court 
or federal agency. 

Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure 

.06.  Definitions: 

CC. 

“Professional Misconduct” includes: 

Attorney conduct that occurs in another jurisdiction, including before any 
2. 
federal court or federal agency, and results in the disciplining of an attorney in that 
other  jurisdiction,  if  the  conduct  is  Professional  Misconduct  under  the  Texas 
Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct. 

.01.  Orders  From  Other  Jurisdictions:  Upon  receipt  of  information  indicating  that  an 
attorney licensed to practice law in Texas has been disciplined in another jurisdiction, including 
by  any  federal  court  or  federal  agency,  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  shall  diligently  seek  to 
obtain a certified copy of the order or judgment of discipline from the other jurisdiction, and file 
it  with the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals  along  with  a  petition  requesting  that  the  attorney  be 
disciplined  in  Texas.  A  certified  copy  of  the  order  or  judgment  is  prima  facie  evidence  of  the 
matters contained therein, and a final adjudication in another jurisdiction that an attorney licensed 
to practice law in Texas has committed Professional Misconduct is conclusive for the purposes of 
a Disciplinary Action under this Part, subject to the defenses set forth in Rule 9.04 below. For 
purposes of this Part, “discipline” by a federal court or federal agency means a public reprimand,

Assignment Generally: Upon receipt of a Disciplinary Petition, the Presiding Judge 
shall assign an active district judge whose district does not include the county of 
appropriate venue to preside in the case. An assignment of a judge from another 
region  shall  be  under  Chapter  74,  Government  Code.  The  Presiding  Judge  shall 
transmit a copy of the Presiding Judge’s assignment order to the Chief Disciplinary 
Counsel. Should the judge so assigned be unable to fulfill the assignment, he or she 
shall immediately notify the Presiding Judge, and the Presiding Judge shall assign 
a  replacement  judge  whose  district  does  not  include  the  county  of  appropriate 
venue.  A  judge  assigned  under  this  Rule  shall  be  subject  to  recusal  or

this state. The motion seeking recusal or motion to disqualify must be filed by either 
party within the time provided by Rule 18a, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. In the 
event of recusal or disqualification, the Presiding Judge shall assign a replacement 
judge whose district does not include the county of appropriate venue. If an active 
district judge assigned to a disciplinary case becomes a retired, senior, or former 
judge, he or she may be assigned by the Presiding Judge to continue to preside in 
the case, provided the judge has been placed on a visiting judge list. If the Presiding 
Judge decides not to assign the retired, senior, or former judge to continue to preside 
in the case, the Presiding Judge shall assign an active district judge whose district 
does not  include the county of appropriate  venue.  A  visiting judge may only be 
assigned if he or she was originally assigned to preside in the case while an active 
judge. Any judge assigned under this Rule is not subject to objection under Chapter 
74, Government Code. 

B.  

Transfer of Case: If the county of alleged venue is successfully challenged, the case 
shall be transferred to the county of proper venue.  If  the case  is  transferred to a 
county in the assigned judge’s district, the judge must recuse himself or herself, 
unless  the  parties  waive  the  recusal  on  the  record.  In  the  event  of  recusal,  the 
Presiding  Judge  of  the  administrative  judicial  region  shall  assign  a  replacement 
judge whose district does not include the county of appropriate venue. If the case 
is transferred to a county outside the administrative judicial region of the Presiding 
Judge who made the assignment, the Presiding Judge of the administrative judicial 
region where the case is transferred shall oversee assignment for the case and the 
previously  assigned  judge  shall  continue  to  preside  in  the  case  unless  he  or  she 
makes a good cause objection to continued assignment, in which case the Presiding 
Judge shall assign a replacement judge whose district does not include the county 
of appropriate venue. 

.03.  Filing, Service and Venue: After the trial judge has been assigned, the Chief Disciplinary 
Counsel  shall  promptly  file  the  Disciplinary  Petition  and  a  copy  of  the  Presiding  Judge’s 
assignment order with the district clerk of the county of alleged venue. The Respondent shall then 
be served as in civil cases generally with a copy of the Disciplinary Petition and a copy of the 
Presiding  Judge’s  assignment  order.  In  a  Disciplinary  Action,  venue  shall  be  in  the  county  of 
Respondent's principal place of practice; or if the Respondent does not maintain a place of practice 
within the State of Texas, in the county of Respondent's residence; or if the Respondent maintains 
neither a residence nor a place of practice within the State of Texas, then in the county where the 
alleged Professional Misconduct occurred, in whole or in part. In all other instances, venue is in 
Travis County, Texas.

Apply for extension of time before any court or any administrative body pending
the client's employment of other legal counsel.

With the prior consent of the client, file such motions and pleadings on behalf of

carry  out  the  purposes  of  this  Rule.  Except  for  intentional  misconduct  or  gross  negligence,  no 
person acting as custodian attorney under this Rule shall incur any liability by reason of the actions 
taken pursuant to this Rule. 

The  privileges  and  limitations  of  liability  contained  herein  shall  not  apply  to  any  legal 
representation taken over by the custodian attorney.
