An applicant must comply with submission requirements stated on the application form. 
Incomplete applications will not be processed. 

An applicant must provide the Commission with his or her Texas and national criminal 
history  records  by  fingerprint  search  according  to  directions  published  on  the 
Commission’s website. The criminal history searches must be conducted no more than 90 
days before after an application is submitted. 

.2 

Renewal Applications 

A person must not perform work requiring certification, registration, or a license under the 
Act with an expired certification, registration, or license. 

The Commission will notify a regulated person by email no later than 30 days before the 
date  that  the  person’s  certification,  registration,  or  license  is  scheduled  to  expire.  A 
regulated  person’s  failure  to  receive  a  renewal  notice  from  the  Commission  does  not 
exempt the person from any requirement of these rules or of any other rules governing the 
person’s profession. 

All certification, registration, and license renewal applications must be submitted through 
the JBCC online certification, registration, and licensing system on forms published on the 
Commission’s  website.  A  regulated  person  must  comply  with  submission  requirements 
stated on the renewal form. Incomplete applications will not be processed. 

The renewal application and all applicable fees are due 45 days prior to on or before the 
expiration  of  the  certification,  registration,  or  license.  An  application  is  timely  if  it  is 
submitted postmarked on or before its expiration the due date. Failure to submit complete 
a renewal application at least 45 days prior to on or before expiration will may result in a 
lapse of the legal authority to practice in accordance with the certification, registration, or 
license. 

In  order  to  renew  a  certification,  registration,  or  license  after  its  expiration,  a  regulated 
person must pay late renewal fees as follows:

Certification, Registration, and Licensing 

Initial Applications 

If the renewal application is submitted 90 days or less after expiration, the renewal 
fee is one and one-half times the normally required renewal fee; and 

If the renewal application is submitted more than 90 days but less than 1 year after 
expiration, the renewal fee is twice the normally required renewal fee. 

Upon the 1-year anniversary of the expiration of a certification, registration, or license, it 
terminates,  becomes  permanently  invalid,  and  cannot  be  renewed.  A  person;  program; 
corporation; partnership; firm; other business entity; local, county, or regional agency; or 
nonprofit  entity  whose certification, registration,  or license is  invalid  may obtain a new 
certification, registration, or license by fulfilling all requirements, including examination, 
for obtaining an initial certification, registration, or license. 

g) 

Notwithstanding (f), a person may renew a certification, registration, or license 1 year after 
expiration or later, if: 

(1) 

the person moved to another state or jurisdiction before applying for renewal; 

the  person  is  certified,  registered,  or  licensed  in  good  standing  to  engage  in  the 
practice of the same profession in the other state or jurisdiction; 

the person has been engaged in that practice for a period of at least 1 year preceding 
the date the person applies for renewal; and 

4) 

the person pays a renewal fee which is twice the normally required renewal fee.  

h)(e)  Any continuing education that is required to be fulfilled as part of the renewal application 
must be completed prior to the certification, registration, or license expiration date to avoid 
payment of a late renewal fee. 

i)(f)  Notwithstanding  (b)  through  (h)(e),  a  regulated  person  who  fails  to  renew  his  or  her 
certification, registration, or license in a timely manner because the person was on active 
duty  in  the  United  States  armed  forces  serving  outside  this  State  is  exempt  from  any 
increased  renewal  fee  that  the  person  would  otherwise  be  required  to  pay  for  failing  to 
renew in a timely manner. 

j)(g)  Notwithstanding (b) through (h)(e):

A  regulated  person  who  is  a  member  of  the  state  military  forces  or  a  reserve 
component of the armed forces of the United States, and who is ordered to active 
duty by the proper authority, is entitled to an extension of his or her certification, 
registration,  or  license  period  equal  to  the  deployment  period  and  an  additional 
amount of time to complete any continuing education requirements and any other 
requirements  related  to  the  renewal  of  the  person’s  certification,  registration,  or 
license.

The individual must submit  to  the Director  a  written request,  accompanied by a 
copy of the orders placing the person on active duty. 

The  Director  must  make  the  extension  based  on  information  in  the  copy  of  the 
orders provided. The additional amount of time must be equal to the total number 
of months that the person serves on active duty. 

An  individual  making  a  request  under  this  rule  must  notify  the  Director  of  any 
change in the length of deployment. 

A regulated person is exempt from any increased fee or other penalty for failing to 
renew the person’s certification, registration, or license in a timely manner if the 
individual  furnishes  to  the  Commission  satisfactory  documentation  that  the 
individual failed to renew in a timely manner because the individual was on active 
duty in the United States armed forces serving outside this State.

k)(h)  The Commission must refuse to accept a regulated person’s application for renewal if the 
Commission receives notice of child support arrearages pursuant to Section 232.0135 of 
the Family Code. Upon receipt of further notice that the person has complied with Section 
232.0135(b),  the  Commission  must  accept  an  application  for  renewal  subject  to  all 
requirements of these rules. 

.3 

Endorsement; Reciprocity 

The Commission may waive any prerequisite to obtaining a certification, registration, or 
license for an applicant after reviewing the applicant’s credentials and determining that the 
applicant holds a certification, registration, or license issued by another jurisdiction that 
has certification, registration, or licensing requirements substantially equivalent to those of 
this State. 

The Commission may waive any prerequisite to obtaining a certification, registration, or 
license for an applicant who holds a certification, registration, or license issued by another 
jurisdiction with which this State has a reciprocity agreement. Subject to the approval of 
the Supreme Court, the Commission may make an agreement with another state to allow 
for certification, registration, or licensing by reciprocity. 

Alternative Application Procedure for Military Spouses, Military Service Member, 

.4 
and Veterans 

Pursuant to Chapter 55 of the Occupations Code, the Commission must grant credit toward 
certification, registration, and licensing requirements for relevant verified military service 
education,  training,  and  experience  earned  by  a  military  service  member  or  a  military 
veteran  who  applies  for  certification,  registration,  or  licensure.  The  Commission  may 
withhold  credit  from  a  military  service  member  or  veteran  who  holds  a  restricted 
certification, registration, or license issued by another jurisdiction or has an unacceptable 
criminal history.

The Commission must expedite applications for certification, registration, and licensure 
which are filed by military service members, military veterans, and military spouses. This 
rule  applies  to  an  applicant  who  is  the  spouse  of  a  person  serving  on  active  duty  as  a 
member of the armed forces of the United States. 

c)(b)  The Commission may issue a certification, registration, or license to an applicant described 
under (a) who is a military service member, the spouse of a military service member, or a 
military veteran and: 

holds a current certification, registration, or license issued by another state that has 
requirements  that  are  substantially  equivalent  to  the  requirements  for  the 
certification, registration, or license; or

registration, or license in this State that expired while the applicant lived in another 
state for at least six months. 

d)(c)  The  Commission  may  allow  an  applicant  who  meets  the  requirements  of  (c)(b)  to 
demonstrate  competency  by  alternative  methods  or  credentials  in  order  to  meet  the 
requirements for obtaining a particular certification, registration, or license issued by the 
Commission.  For  purposes  of  this  Section,  the  standard  methods  of  demonstrating

the requirements of (b) in the same manner set forth in Section 51.404 of the Occupations 
Code. 

.5 

Eligibility for Persons with Criminal History 

An initial or renewal application may be denied, and a regulated person may be disciplined, 
if  the  person’s  criminal  history  or  other  information  indicates  that  the  person  lacks  the 
honesty, trustworthiness, or integrity to hold the certification, registration, or license. After 
consultation  with  the  appropriate  advisory  boards,  the  Commission  will  develop  and 
publish  on  its  website  guidelines  for  each  regulatory  program  listing  the  categories  of 
crimes that are considered to indicate that a person lacks the honesty, trustworthiness, or 
integrity  to  hold  the  particular  certification,  registration,  or  license.  The  Director  will 
determine whether an initial or renewal application will be denied under this rule using the 
guidelines developed by the Commission and the factors listed in (b). If the Director denies 
an  application,  the  applicant  may  request  that  the  Commission  reconsider  the  decision 
under Rule 3.6. 

b) 

In making a determination under (a), the Commission or Director may consider: 

(1) 

the nature and seriousness of the crime; 

  (

  (

  (

 

g) 

a) 

the  extent  to  which  certification,  registration,  or  licensing  might  offer  an 
opportunity to engage in further criminal activity of the same type as that in which 
the person previously had been involved; 

the relationship of the crime to the ability, capacity, or fitness required to perform 
the duties and discharge the responsibilities of the occupation; 

the extent and nature of the person’s past criminal activity; 

the age of the person when the crime was committed; 

the amount of time that has elapsed since the person’s last criminal activity; 

the conduct and work activity of the person before and after the criminal activity;

any other evidence of the person’s fitness, including, but not limited to, letters of 
recommendation. 

c) 

A person may request that the Commission, through the Director, issue a criminal history 
evaluation letter regarding the person’s eligibility for certification or licensure under this 
rule. 

(1) 

The person may request a criminal history evaluation letter if the person: 

is enrolled or is planning to enroll in an educational program that prepares 
a  person  for  an  initial  certification  or  license  or  is  planning  to  take  an 
examination  required  by  the  Commission  for  an  initial  certification  or 
license; and 

has  reason  to  believe  that  the  person  is  ineligible  for  certification  or 
licensing  due  to  a  conviction  or  deferred  adjudication  for  a  felony  or 
misdemeanor offense or other criminal history. 

The request must be in writing and must state the basis for the person’s potential 
ineligibility. The requestor must provide the Commission with his or her criminal 
records pursuant to the fingerprinting requirements for the particular certification 
or licensing program. The Commission may request additional information from 
the requestor. 

If the Director determines that a ground for ineligibility does not exist, the Director 
must notify the requestor in writing of the Director’s determination on each ground 
of potential ineligibility. 

If the Director determines that the requestor is ineligible, the Director must issue a 
letter  setting  out  each  basis  for  potential  ineligibility  and  the  Director’s 
determination as to eligibility.

.6 

Denial of Application; Reconsideration 

Application Review. The Director must review each application and determine whether the 
applicant  meets  the  Commission’s  qualifications  for  the  particular  certification, 
registration, or license. The Director must also determine whether the applicant meets the 
Commission’s criminal history eligibility requirements. If a person who has applied to be 
a certified guardian does not clearly meet the experience or education requirements in these 
rules, the Director must consult with members of the Guardianship Certification Advisory 
Board before approving or denying the application. 

Denial of Application. The Director may deny an application only if the applicant fails to 
meet  the  qualifications  set  forth  in  these  rules  or  the  Commission’s  criminal  history 
eligibility requirements. The Director must furnish to the applicant a written statement that 
succinctly states the reason for denying the application. 

Request for Reconsideration. Within 20 days of the date of the notice that the Director has 
denied an application, the applicant may request that the Commission reconsider the denial. 
The request must be in writing, identify each point or matter about which reconsideration 
is requested, and set forth the grounds for the request for reconsideration. 

Reconsideration  Procedure.  The  Commission  must  reconsider  the  request  at  its  next 
meeting and may allow the applicant or other witnesses to appear at the meeting and present 
sworn testimony. The Commission may limit the number of witnesses appearing and the 
time allotted for a witness’s testimony. 

e) 

Commission  Action  on  Request.  After  reconsidering  a  decision  of  the  Director,  the 
Commission may:

Final Decision. The Commission  must  notify the  applicant  in  writing of its decision on 
reconsideration. The Commission’s decision is final and may not be appealed. 

.7 

Examination Security 

Except as provided in Rule 3.10, when an applicant must take an examination in order to 
obtain a certification or license, the applicant may only use methods of assistance that are 
available to, and authorized for, other persons taking the examination. A person who uses 
or provides unauthorized assistance in connection with an examination violates this rule. 
Conduct that violates this rule includes but is not limited to the following: 

obtaining or attempting to obtain from any source examination questions or answers 
for  use  by  an  applicant,  prospective  applicant,  or  any  other  person,  including  a 
person associated with a school or examination preparation course; 

providing  or  attempting  to  provide  examination  questions  or  answers  to  an 
applicant, prospective applicant, or any other person, including a person associated 
with a school or examination preparation course; 

presenting a falsified or fraudulent document to gain entry to an examination; 

presenting  a  falsified  or  fraudulent  document  concerning  an  individual’s  results 
from an examination; 

taking an examination for another person; 

as an applicant or prospective applicant, knowingly allowing another person to take 
an examination for the applicant or prospective applicant; 

while taking an examination, using any materials not authorized by the Commission 
or testing service for use in the examination, including but not limited to notes or 
study aides; 

bringing to the examination site or leaving the examination site with examination 
questions  or  answers  obtained  from  the  current  examination  or  from  previous 
examination attempts; 

while  taking  an  examination,  communicating  with  any  person,  other  than  an 
authorized  representative  of  the  Commission  or  testing  service,  about  the 
examination; or 

10) 

for open book examinations, bringing any materials into the examination, including 
hand-written  notes  in  approved  reference  materials,  other  than  those  materials 
approved by the Commission or testing service.

The  contents  of  any  examination  that  is  required  for  the  issuance  of  a  Commission 
certification or license are confidential. 

An  applicant  who  cheats  on  an  examination  will  be  disqualified  and  may  not  take  the 
examination again until two years have elapsed from the date of the examination at which 
the applicant was disqualified. 

.8 

Examination Rescheduling 

A person may reschedule an examination to another regularly scheduled examination date 
at no charge if the person notifies the Commission or vendor at least two days prior to the 
examination and complies with the instructions of the Commission or vendor. 

A person who reschedules an examination under this rule may apply the examination fee 
paid for the cancelled examination to the rescheduled examination. 

.9 

Examination Fee Refund 

a) 

To obtain a refund of an examination fee, a person who is unable to take the examination 
must: 

if the examination is administered by a vendor, comply with the vendor’s notice 
and documentation requirements; or 

if the examination is administered by the Commission, provide written notice to the 
Director not less than 10 days prior to the date of the examination or provide the 
Director, as soon as possible, with documentation of the person’s inability to take 
the examination because of an emergency. 

(1) 

2) 

  (

A person seeking a refund must apply for the refund in writing within one year of the date 
that the person paid the fee. The person must, upon request, provide the Office additional 
information necessary to process the refund. 

.10  Access to Examinations and Examination on Religious Holy Days 

Reasonable accommodation  for examinations  will  be made available as  required by the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Public Law 101-336, to address a condition or 
circumstances that would prevent a person from taking the examination in the same manner 
as  a  person  who  does  not  need  accommodation.  Reasonable  accommodation  means  an 
adjustment or modification of the standard testing conditions that ameliorates the impact 
of the applicant’s disability, after the applicant provides reasonable notice under subsection 
(c), without doing any of the following: 

fundamentally altering the nature of the examination;

fundamentally  altering  the  Commission’s  ability  to  determine  through  the 
examination whether the applicant possesses the essential eligibility requirements; 

compromising the validity of the examination; 

compromising the security of the examination; or 

imposing an undue burden on the Commission or on the examination vendor. 

If  an  examination  is  scheduled  on  a  date  that  is  a  religious  holy  day,  a  person  whose 
religious  beliefs  prevent  that  person  from  taking  an  examination  on  such  date  will  be 
permitted  to  take  the  examination  on  an  alternate  date.  The  alternate  date  must  be  a 
regularly  scheduled  examination  date  unless  the  person’s  religious  beliefs  prevent  the 
person from taking the examination on such date. 

A person who needs a reasonable accommodation for an examination or who requests to 
take the examination on an alternate date must notify the Director or examination vendor, 
as applicable, of the request at least 10 days prior to the scheduled examination. 

.11  Examination Results 

Unless the examination is graded or reviewed by a testing service, not later than the 30th 
day  after  the  date  that  a  person  takes  an  examination,  the  Commission  must  notify  the 
person of the results of the examination. 

b) 

If the examination is graded or reviewed by a testing service: 

the Commission must notify the person of the results of the examination not later 
than the 30th day after the date that the Commission receives the results from the 
testing service; and 

if notice of the examination results will be delayed for longer than 90 days after the 
examination  date,  the  Commission  must  notify  the  person  of  the  reason  for  the 
delay before the 90th day. 

If requested in writing by a person who fails an examination, the Commission must furnish 
the person with an analysis of the person’s performance on the examination. 

Examination  results  are  valid  for  two  years  one  year  from  the  date  of  the  examination, 
unless stated otherwise in specific program statutes or rules. A person who does not apply 
or otherwise meet qualifications for a certificate or license within two years after the date 
of the examination must pass the examination again in order to apply for the certificate or 
license.

complete, and changes the person’s status on the Commission’s website. 

The  person  must  provide  written  notice  of  the  voluntary  surrender  as  required  by  the 
Director. 

The circumstances under which the certification, registration, or license is surrendered will

videoconference, upon timely motion stating the reason for the request and the city 
in which the party or witness will be located at the time of the proceeding. A timely 
motion for telephone or videoconference appearance will not be deemed granted 
unless granted by written order of the presiding officer.

complaint  review  committee  may  attend  the  hearing  to  respond  to  consult  with  the 
Commission inquiries on the reasons for the advisory board complaint review committee’s 
determination and imposed disciplinary action recommendations under Rule 5.8(d). 

At the hearing, the Commission must apply the general rules of evidence applicable in a 
district court, except that the Commission may admit and consider any information that the 
Commission  determines  is  relevant,  trustworthy,  and  necessary  for  a  full  and  fair 
adjudication and determination of fact or law. The Commission may establish rules for the 
conduct of the hearing.

.11  Options Following Decision: Pay, Accept, or Appeal 
Not  later  than  the  30th  day  after  the  date  that  the  Commission  issues  an  order  imposing  an 
administrative penalty or sanction, the respondent must: 

accept the obligation to pay the penalty in accordance with the order or accept the sanction; 
or 

file an appeal of the Commission’s order contesting the occurrence of the violation, the 
imposition or amount of the penalty, or the imposition of the sanction. 

.12  Collection of Penalty 

If the respondent does not pay the penalty and the enforcement of the penalty is not stayed, 
the Attorney General may sue to collect the penalty and may recover reasonable expenses, 
including attorney’s fees, incurred in recovering the penalty. 

A penalty collected under these rules will be deposited in the state treasury in the general 
revenue fund. 

.13  Appeal 

A  person  seeking  to  appeal  an  order  that  imposes  a  penalty  or  sanction  must  submit  a 
written appeal of the order to the General Counsel of the Office within 30 days after the 
Commission’s order is issued. The General Counsel must promptly forward the appeal to 
a special committee consisting of three Administrative Regional Presiding Judges. 

The committee will be chosen by the Presiding Judges, but the committee must not include 
the Presiding Judge for the administrative region in which the appellant resided at the time 
of the decision. If the alleged violation involves a certified guardian, the committee must 
consist of two Regional Presiding Judges and the Presiding Judge of the statutory probate 
courts. 

The  General  Counsel  must  notify  the  Commission  of  the  filing  of  an  appeal  and,  upon 
request,  must  make  the  appeal  materials  available  to  the  Commission  or  its  legal 
representative.

a  copy  of  the  notice  of  the  Commission’s  order  with  which  the  appellant  is 
dissatisfied; and 

a  statement  succinctly  explaining  why  the  appellant  is  dissatisfied  with  the 
Commission’s decision.

2) 

  (

The Office must adopt rules or policies to ensure that any Office employee who provides 
clerical, administrative, or other direct support to the Commission does not communicate 
regarding the substance of any appeal under this rule with any other Office employee who 
facilitates the appeal process under this rule. The rules or policies must also provide that 
Office employees may communicate regarding nonsubstantive aspects of appeals, such as 
to ensure the completeness and accuracy of appeal materials to be forwarded to the special 
committee. 

Upon receiving notice of an appeal of a disciplinary action imposing a penalty or sanction, 
the  Commission  must  provide  to  the  General  Counsel,  and  the  General  Counsel  must 
submit  to  the  special  committee,  electronic  or  paper  copies  of  the  complaint  and  any 
original attachments, any written answer timely submitted by the appellant, notice of the 
Commission’s decision imposing a penalty or sanction, and any other documents or written 
evidence admitted into the record considered by the Commission pertaining to the decision 
complained of on appeal. The Commission staff must provide a copy of these items to an 
appellant upon request, and may charge costs for such copies as set forth in Rule 12.7 of 
the Rules of Judicial Administration. 

Absent  approval  by  the  special  committee,  submission  of  materials  other  than  those 
described in (f) is prohibited. The special committee may, in its sole discretion, allow an 
appellant to submit additional written materials relating to the appeal. Otherwise, only the 
written  materials  described  in  (f)  will  be  considered.  A  request  to  submit  additional 
materials must clearly identify the additional materials for which inclusion is requested. 

The special committee must consider the appeal under an abuse of discretion standard of 
review for all issues except issues involving questions of law. The standard of review for 
issues involving questions of law is de novo. Under either standard, the burden is on the 
appellant to establish that the Commission’s decision was erroneous. 

The  special  committee  may  consider  the  appeal  without  a  hearing  and  may  conduct  its 
deliberations by any appropriate means. The special committee may, in its sole discretion, 
conduct  a  hearing  and  allow  testimony  from  the  appellant  or  any  other  person  with 
knowledge of the underlying facts relating to the disciplinary action complained of. 

The special committee may confer in writing with a certification, registration, or license 
holder who is in the same profession as the appellant if the special committee provides to 
the appellant:

If  the  special  committee  sustains  the  finding  that  a  violation  occurred,  the  special 
committee may: 

(k) 

uphold or reduce the amount of any penalty and order the appellant to pay the full 
or reduced amount of the penalty; and 

uphold or reduce any sanction and order the imposition of the sanction. 

If the special committee does not sustain the finding that a violation occurred, the special 
committee must order that a penalty is not owed and that a sanction may not be imposed. 

If the appellant paid the penalty and if the amount of the penalty is reduced or the penalty 
is  not  upheld  by  the  special  committee,  the  special  committee  must  order  that  the 
appropriate amount plus accrued interest be remitted to the appellant not later than the 30th 
day after the date the judgment of the special committee becomes final. The interest accrues 
at the rate charged on loans to depository institutions by the New York Federal Reserve 
Bank. The interest must be paid for the period beginning on the date the penalty is paid and 
ending on the date the penalty is remitted. 

n) 

The special committee must notify the Commission and appellant in writing of its decision. 
No rehearing or further appeal is allowed. 

.14  Disposition by Agreement 

Any disciplinary matter may be disposed of by agreement, unless precluded by law. The 
agreement  must  be  in  writing  and  may  be  in  the  form  of  a  stipulation,  a  settlement 
agreement, or a consent order. 

The Commission may designate its presiding officer or the Director to adopt or reject an 
agreement. 

c) 

The agreement must: 

include proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law; and 

be signed by all parties to the agreement and their representatives.

In addition to the procedures under Rule 5.14, the Commission encourages the resolution 
and  early  settlement  of  all  contested  disciplinary  matters  through  voluntary  settlement 
procedures. 

At any time after the filing of a complaint against a regulated person respondent and before 
referral to a review committee under Rule 5.8(d), the Director may initiate a settlement 
conference  on  the  Director’s  own  motion  or  at  the  request  of  any  party.  Settlement 
conferences are voluntary. 

The  Director,  on  behalf  of  Commission  staff,  complainant  and  the  respondent  are  the 
parties  in  a  settlement  conference.  The  complainant  Commission  (through  one  or  more 
Commission  members,  Office  staff,  or  counsel)  may  also  participate  as  a  party  in  a 
settlement conference at the sole option of the presiding officer. 

A  settlement  conference  may  be  used  to  reach  agreement  about  all  or  a  portion  of  the 
ultimate issues in a disciplinary matter or to reach agreement about how to handle disputed 
matters.  The  parties  may  use  a  mediator  for  a  settlement  conference  or  conduct  the 
settlement conference without a mediator. 

The parties to a settlement conference cannot complainant and the respondent may not bind 
the Commission to any resolution of a disciplinary matter pending before the Commission. 
The presiding officer may appoint one or more Commission members or staff to attend the 
settlement conference. The Commission representative must participate in the proceedings 
in an effort to resolve the dispute within the parameters of any instructions received from 
the Commission and must recuse themselves from any subsequent hearings or deliberations 
regarding the case. 

In  the  event  a  settlement  of  some  or  all  of  the  disputed  issues  is  reached  during  the 
settlement conference, the Commission must review the terms of the settlement at the next 
regularly  scheduled  Commission  meeting.  The  Commission  may  accept  the  settlement 
terms, reject the settlement terms and restore all proceedings on the disciplinary matter to 
the  status  quo  as  it  existed  immediately  prior  to  the  settlement  conference,  or  refer  the 
matter for further negotiation. 

g) 

The parties may agree to retain a mediator to assist with the settlement conference. 

(1) 

The parties must notify the presiding officer in writing of their agreement to retain 
a mediator. That notice must include the name, address, and telephone number of 
the mediator selected; a statement that the parties have entered into an agreement

with  the  mediator  as  to  rate  and  method  of  his  or  her  compensation;  and  an 
affirmation that the mediator is qualified to serve. 

Upon receipt of a properly filed notice under (1), the presiding officer will enter an 
order referring the case to the mediator. 

2) 

  (

If the parties do not agree to a mediator, the presiding officer may appoint an individual to 
serve as mediator in the settlement conference. 

An individual appointed to serve as a mediator under (g) or (h) must meet the qualifications 
set forth in the Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section 154.052.  Pursuant to Section 
154.052(e) of the Code, an individual who has served as a judge in Texas may be appointed 
to serve as a mediator. 

The Commission will not pay any fees or costs associated with a settlement conference 
unless good cause is shown and the Commission and Office agree to do so prior to the 
settlement conference. 

All  communications  in  the  settlement  conference  between  or  among  the  parties,  and 
between each party and mediator, if any, are confidential under the same terms as provided 
in Section 154.053 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Information shared with the 
mediator in separate meetings will not be given to any other party unless the party sharing 
the information explicitly gives the mediator permission to do so. Material provided to the 
mediator is not required to be provided to the other parties and will not be filed or become 
a record in the disciplinary proceedings. Notes taken during the settlement conference by 
the parties and the mediator must be destroyed at the end of the process. 

Any agreement reached by the parties will be reduced to writing and signed by the parties 
before the end of the settlement conference. These writings may be informal in nature. The 
parties may agree that the written agreement remain confidential if there is no requirement 
of law to the contrary. Any part of the agreement that may affect the disposition of the 
disciplinary proceeding (such as agreements concerning relevant facts) must be filed in the 
record of the disciplinary proceeding. 

If  the  parties  use  a  mediator  for  the  settlement  conference,  the  mediator  must  maintain 
confidentiality  in  accordance  with  Section  2009.054  of  the  Government  Code.  The 
mediator may not communicate to the Commission matters discussed with the parties in 
the settlement conference. The mediator will report to the Commission in writing whether

If  the  Commission  has  on  file  a  valid  statement  of  proficiency  for  an 
applicant,  the  applicant  is  not  required  to  file  a  new  statement  of 
proficiency. A statement of proficiency is valid for one year from the date

h)(i)  An applicant who fails an examination may request that the examination be regraded by 
sending a written request to the Commission office within 20 days of the date of notice that 
the applicant has failed the examination. If the examination is regraded, the Commission

results, the applicant may request a personal review of the examination with a member of 
the advisory board. The request for a personal review must be in writing and filed within 
twenty 20 days of the notice of regrading results. 

i)(j)  The Commission must certify to the Supreme Court of Texas the names of applicants who 
have  completed  all  application  requirements  and  are  determined  on  examination  to  be 
qualified  in  professional  shorthand  reporting.  In  its  certification,  the  Commission  must 
specify the method or methods of reporting used by each successful applicant in taking the 
examination. 

j)(k)  A person certified under Chapter 52 of the Government Code prior to September 1, 1983, 
may retain a general certification authorizing the person to use any method of shorthand 
reporting authorized in Rule 6.2(a)(1), provided that the person keeps the certification in 
continuous effect.

Renewal of Certification or Registration 

Notwithstanding Rule 3.2(b), not later than the 30th day before the date a court reporter’s 
or court reporting firm’s certification or registration is scheduled to expire, the Commission 
will notify the reporter or firm of the impending expiration at the reporter’s or firm’s last 
known address according to the Commission’s records. Failure to receive the notice does 
not exempt a court reporter or a court reporting firm from any requirements of these rules. 

b) 

Nonrenewal due to student loan default. 

(1) 

The Commission must not renew the certification of a certified shorthand reporter 
who is designated to be in default on loans guaranteed by the Texas Guaranteed

certifying that: 

(A) 

the reporter has entered a repayment agreement on the defaulted loan; or 

B) 

the reporter is not in default on a loan guaranteed by TGSLC. 

(2) 

The Commission must not renew the certification of a certified shorthand reporter 
who is designated to be in default on a repayment agreement with TGSLC under 
Section  57.491(g)  of  the  Education  Code  unless  the  reporter  presents  to  the 
Commission a certificate issued by TGSLC certifying that:

A court may waive the training requirement as a qualification for appointment as guardian, 
if the court finds the proposed guardian received the training during the one-year period 
immediately preceding the date of the application for appointment as guardian. 

A  court  may  postpone  the  training  requirement  as  a  qualification  for  appointment  as 
guardian to a date not later than 60 days after appointment, if:

an immediate appointment of a guardian is necessary. 

If  the  court  finds  that  the  training  is  not  available  in  a  language  in  which  the  proposed 
guardian is proficient, a court may postpone the training requirement as a qualification for 
appointment  to  a  date  no  later  than  60  days  after  the  Commission  develops  or  obtains 
training materials in the language in which the proposed guardian is proficient. 

The court must provide the Commission written notice of waiver or postponement of the 
training requirement, and of the reason for the waiver or postponement, within 5 days after

Rule 10.2, unless the proposed guardian is a certified guardian, a provisionally certified 
guardian, an attorney, or a corporate fiduciary.  

b) 

A proposed guardian may not be appointed guardian, or temporary guardian, unless: 

the criminal history records of the Department of Public Safety are searched for the 
name and any former name of the proposed guardian if the value of the estimated 
liquid assets in the estate of the proposed ward is $50,000 or less; or 

the fingerprints of the proposed guardian are searched in the records of the Federal 
Bureau of  Investigations if the value of the liquid assets  of the proposed ward’s 
estate exceed $50,000. 

Not  later  than  10  days  before  the  court’s  hearing  to  consider  the  proposed  guardian’s 
appointment,  the  Commission  must  provide  a  copy  of  the  criminal  history  background 
information regarding a proposed guardian to the clerk of the court in which the related

Commission  must  register  information  regarding  the  guardianship  obtained  under  Rule 
10.1  in  the  guardianship  database  maintained  by  the  Commission  pursuant  to  Section 
155.152 of the Government Code.  

A clerk of the court must notify the Commission of the dismissal, denial, or non-suit of a
