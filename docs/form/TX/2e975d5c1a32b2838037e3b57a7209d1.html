REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS:
Estimated amounts are based on the assumption that the demand for services will continue at current levels for all programs.  There are cyclical variations in revenue between 
years due to the transition of all renewals to a 2-year renewal cycle. Projections factor in lapsed licenses in the renewal calculation for the largest population, Process Servers, at 
10% due to the transitory nature of this population.  Certified court reporters continue working into retirement years.   Guardians and Licensed Court Interpreters, small populations 
of less than 500 individuals, are more static therefore lapsed licenses are not factored in.

REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS:
Court costs collected from criminal defendants, which fund roughly 75% of the TIDC's budget, declined 20% during the pandemic.  Similarly, surety bond fees, which fund roughly 
4% of TIDC's budget, declined 15%.  Combined, these decreases resulted in approximately $7 million in lost revenue annually.  This $14 million revenue loss negatively impacted 
TIDC's ability to fund indigent defense, as well as TIDC's ability to monitor counties' compliance with the Fair Defense laws.  Specifically, TIDC reduced both formula grant and 
improvement grant funding to Texas counties and forewent hiring policy analysts to conduct policy monitoring .  Senate Bill 8, 87th(3) restored the lost revenues to Fund 5073 in 
the amount of $13,942,466, from the Federal Coronavirus State Fiscal Recovery Fund (CSFR) in FY22.   The Office of Capital and Forensic Writs (OCFW) also received 
appropriations from the CSFR, but appropriated as Fund 0325, not Fund 5073.

REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS:
Revenue estimate for 2022 is based on historical trends in 2021, adjusted to match appropriation authority and legislative changes.  SB 41, 87th Regular Session, consolidated civil 
filing fees.  The changes to the fee structure will result in additional revenues being deposited into Fund 5157.  It is unknown what impact the legislation will have on revenues but 
the former Administrative Director estimated the increase in deposits to be between $3 to $5 million.

The IT department increased Austin bandwidth from 200Mb to 500Mb to sustain the teleworking load generated for our end users that go through the Austin network  (about 
600 of the 1100 users we support); pushed Teams to all users - no additional cost; increased the abilities of AnyConnect to handle all people working from home; and reimaged 
and re-purposed 46 laptops and distributed them to people that needed them.  This was done across all agencies we support (including the judicial branch agencies and Courts 
of Appeals that requested them). The agency also purchased 100 additional webcams.  In an effort to assist judges to hold both essential and non-essential proceedings 
remotely, OCA has tested and procured licenses from Zoom to permit any judge in the state to host and provide public access to the proceedings . The system has been tested 
by several judges at each level of court, and the feedback from the judges has been very positive. Here are some highlights of using Zoom:
• The tool is widely available and free for use by the public. Individuals can download for free the app using a cell phone, tablet, or a computer device. The only requirement on
their end is an internet connection. If the person does not have access to the internet or a video-capable device, they can join using a telephone.
• The tool is easy to use by judges and court staff.
• It is easy to publish the electronic proceeding to YouTube, so that the public can have access to the proceeding away from the courthouse, which permits compliance with the
Open Courts provision of the Texas Constitution and the orders of the Supreme Court and Court of Criminal Appeals .
• No cost to local government or courts.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
