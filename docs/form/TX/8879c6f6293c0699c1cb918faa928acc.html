This rule applies to cases filed in a district court in this state in which the state or a state officer 
or agency is a defendant in a claim that: 

challenges the finances or operations of this state’s public school system; or  

involves  the  apportionment  of  districts  for  the  house  of  representatives,  the  senate,  the 
State Board of Education, or the United States Congress, or state judicial districts. 

4.2  Procedure for Initiating the Creation of a Special Three-Judge District Court 

The  attorney  general  may  petition  the  Chief  Justice  to  convene  a  special  three-judge 
district court in any case to which this rule applies. The petition must be submitted to the 
Supreme  Court  clerk  for  presentation  to  the  Chief  Justice.  A  copy  must  be  filed  in  the 
district court in which the case is pending and served on all parties to the case.  
 
The petition must: 

list all parties and counsel and complete contact information for all counsel; 

state  the  cause  number  and  style  of  the  case,  the  district  court  in  which  it  is 
pending, and the name of the judge to whom it is assigned; 

state concisely whether the case falls under Rule 14.1(a) or (b); 

summarize the dispute and all claims asserted against the state or a state officer or 
agency;  

include  a  certificate  of  service  that  complies  with  Texas  Rule  of  Appellate

docket sheet for the case. 
 

(c) 

Any  party  may  submit  a  response to  the  petition  within  seven  days  of  the  date  that  the 
petition is filed in the district court. The Chief Justice may shorten the time for submitting

hearings  in  the  district  in  which  the  case  was  filed  and  may  use  the  courtroom,  other 
facilities, and administrative support of the original district court.  

Except as provided by this rule or Chapter 22A, Government Code, the Texas Rules of 
Civil Procedure and all other statutes and rules applicable to civil litigation in a district

(b)   A  judge  or  justice  of  a  special  three-judge  district  court  may  not  independently  order  a

related case.  

On the motion of any party to a case assigned to a special three-judge district court, the 
special three-judge district court must transfer a related case to itself and consolidate the 
related  case  with  the  case  before  the  court.  The  special  three-judge  district  court  may

a  demonstration  that  the  related  case  arises  from  the  same  nucleus  of  operative 
facts as the case before the special three-judge district court; 

the live pleadings on file in the related case; and 
 
a certificate of service on all parties to the case pending before the special three-
judge district court and to the related case. 

1) 

2) 

3) 

  (

  (

  (

  (

4) 

(5) 

The motion must be in writing and include:   

After a motion to transfer and consolidate a related case is filed, the special three-judge 
district court or the court in the related case may stay the proceedings in the case before it 
until the special three-judge district court has ruled on the motion.  

4.7  Appeals and Original Proceedings 

An  appeal  from  an  appealable  interlocutory  order  or  from  a  final  judgment  of  a  special  three-
judge  district  court  is  to  the  Supreme  Court  under  Texas  Rule  of  Appellate  Procedure  57.  An 
original  appellate  proceeding  seeking  extraordinary  relief  from  an  action  taken  by  the  special
