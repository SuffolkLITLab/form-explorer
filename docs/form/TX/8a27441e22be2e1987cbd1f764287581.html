      <pre>Fourteenth Court of Appeals Leave Policies 

III.  EMPLOYEE LEAVE TIME 

his section III does not apply to elected officials or unpaid interns. 

A.  Overview of State of Texas Employee Leave System 

 

 

The  employee  leave  system  is  considered  an  "exception-based  system  of  time-
keeping."  That is, an employee automatically accrues certain types and amounts of leave 
time  on  a  monthly  basis,  but  is  expected  to  report  and  account  for  any  exception  to  the 
accrual.   Each  employee  receives a  monthly  "Employee  Leave  Summary"  that  shows  the 
employee's current leave balances reported to the state.  Leave balances are calculated from 
the number of leave hours an employee has requested on the Request for Leave forms which 
apply to all employees. 

It  is  Fourteenth  Court  policy  that  every  employee  must  request  approval  from  the 
employee’s  supervisor  before  being  absent  from  work  and  a  corresponding  Request  for 
Leave  form  must  be  signed  by  the  supervisor.    Every  employee  has  the  responsibility  to 
submit the signed Request for Leave form to the court's supervisory personnel designated to 
complete the necessary leave reports required by the State of Texas. 

When a non-exempt employee does not work 40 hours in a work week, and the Court 
has  not  been  officially  closed  on  a  work  day,  a  signed  Request  for  Leave  form  must  be 
submitted to establish the amount of time excepted from that 40-hour work week. 

A  Request  for  Leave  form  submitted  by  the  Chief  Deputy  Clerk,  the  Financial 
Services Director, a Deputy Clerk, or a member of the administrative staff is to be signed by 
the Clerk of Court, or designee.   

Exempt employees also must submit Request for Leave forms for any leave or sick 
time used.  A law clerk's Request for Leave form is to be signed by the assigned Justice or 
staff lawyer assigned to that Justice.  A staff lawyer's Request for Leave form is to be signed 
by the assigned Justice or, in the absence of the Justice, the Chief Staff Attorney.  

The Chief Justice is to sign Request for Leave forms for the Clerk of Court and Chief 

Staff Attorney.

Annual  leave,  or  paid  vacation  time,  is  accrued  on  a  monthly  basis  determined  by 
length  of  service.    Employees  with  less  than  two  years  of  service  accrue  8  hours  of  paid 
vacation time per  month; employees with  more than two  years of service accrue nine (9) 
hours per month, up to 21 hours a month for a 35+ year employee.  An employee may carry 
into a new fiscal year certain amounts of annual leave time up to an established maximum 
that,  if  not  used,  automatically  converts  to  sick  leave.    The  monthly  Employee  Leave 
Summary states when an employee is reaching an automatic conversion point.  Additional 
information may be found on the website for the Employees Retirement System of Texas, 
www.ers.state.tx.us. 

Although annual leave accrues from the first date of employment, vacation with pay 
may not be taken until an employee has been continuously employed for six months.  An 
employee  who  has  been  continuously  employed  for  six  months  and  who  then  resigns,  is 
dismissed, or otherwise separates from state employment is entitled to be paid for accrued 
and unused vacation time. 

A Request for Leave form must be signed by the employee's supervisor in advance of 

the use of accrued vacation time or as soon as is practicable.   

A State employee accrues sick leave at the rate of 8 hours per month from the first 
day of employment.  Unused accrued sick leave can be carried forward annually.  Sick leave 
is available for an employee's illness, injury, pregnancy and confinement, and for when an 
employee must care for a member of the employee’s immediate family who is actually ill.  

An employee who is absent from work due to an illness must notify the employee’s 
supervisor at the earliest practicable time.  To be eligible for accumulated sick leave, with 
pay, for a continuous period of more than three working days, an employee must provide 
a  doctor's  certification,  or  on  the  Request  for  Leave  form,  must  provide  an  acceptable 
written statement of facts about the absence.   

he Chief Justice has the discretion to require a doctor's certificate, or an acceptable 
written statement of facts from the employee, about any absence, even those for less than 
three continuous days.

1.  Working More Than 40 Hours a Week 

Compensatory Time 
 

. 

  C

The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) applies to Texas employees.  This means that 
a non-exempt employee is entitled to compensation for any hours worked in excess of 40 
hours in one work week.  Compensation may be in the form of either 1.5 hours credited per 
each hour worked in excess of 40 hours of compensatory time or, at the discretion of the 
employing state entity, pay at the rate of 1.5 times the regular pay in effect for the employee 
when the excess time was worked.  The Fourteenth Court's overtime policy only allows for 
the  possibility  of  earning  compensatory  time  off  under  specific  circumstances;  earning 
additional pay for overtime is not available.   

A  non-exempt  employee  may  only  work  8  hours  a  day,  unless  the  employee's 
supervisor has approved a prior written request for work time in excess of 8 hours.  Such 
written request must provide a detailed explanation of the reason(s) the employee finds it 
necessary to work longer than the usual work day, that is, why the employee has been unable 
to complete the work during the regular hours during the work week.  When the employee 
claims compensatory time earned this way, the supervisor's authorization must be attached 
to the Request for Leave form.   

Paid leave or holidays taken during a work week are not counted as hours worked in 
determining  FLSA  overtime  hours.    Any  compensatory  time  earned  must  be  used  within 
twelve months of the end of the work week in which it was earned, or the employee loses 
the time.  The Fourteenth Court also requires an employee to exhaust any FLSA overtime 
hours before using annual leave.  

Compensatory time off for exempt employees is within the discretion of the justice to 

whom the exempt employee reports.   

2.  Working National or State Holidays 

 

 

For  each  fiscal  year,  the  State  of  Texas  publishes  a  list of  three  types  of  holidays:  
national, state, and optional.  An employee is entitled to a paid day off from work for each 
national or state holiday that does not fall on a Saturday or Sunday, and if the employee is 
not on unpaid leave.  

The  Fourteenth  Court  is  officially  closed  on  all  national  holidays,  the  Friday  after 
Thanksgiving  Day,  and  December  24th  and  December  26th,  when  those  days  fall  on  a 
weekday.  Days designated as state holidays are considered Skeleton Crew Holidays when 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court is open and is required to have enough employees on duty to conduct its official 
business. 

An employee who works a Skeleton Crew Holiday is entitled to compensatory time 
off during the 12-month period following the date worked.  Employees are required to give 
reasonable advance notice when taking this compensatory time, although the reason for the 
request is not required.  The Request for Leave form must state the date of the Skeleton Crew 
Holiday being claimed for compensatory time. 

Every year, the State designates some religious holidays such as Rosh Hashanah, Yom 
Kippur, and Good Friday that fall on weekdays as Optional Holidays.  An employee may 
substitute an Optional Holiday for a Skeleton Crew Holiday during the same fiscal year as 
the Optional Holiday worked.  The Request for Leave form must state the Optional Holiday 
being substituted for the Skeleton Crew Holiday.   

  

 

 

 

In addition, the Chief Justice may allow an employee to observe Cesar Chavez Day 
as a state holiday, instead of another state holiday that falls on a weekday when the agency 
must remain open for business at minimum staffing levels (i.e., a Skeleton Crew Holiday). 

 

 

POLICY GUIDELINES FOR EMERGENCY LEAVE PROGRAM (Tex. Gov’t Code. 
661.252 & 661.902, 661.923) 
Effective: 9/1/17

D. 
 

rogram Purpose 

ursuant to Texas Government Code § 661.252, the Fourteenth Court  (Court) is providing staff 
with  clear  guidelines  to  establish  under  what  circumstances  an  employee  may  be  entitled  to or 
granted emergency leave provided by Tex. Gov’t Code Chapter 661.  The Court  leave provisions 
are incorporated herein by reference and the following supplement is provided: 

mergency Leave: The Chief Justice may grant emergency leave for a reason other than a reason 
described  under  section  661.902(a)  of  the  Government  Code,  which  provides emergency leave 
because of a death in the employee’s family. 

he Chief Justice shall grant emergency leave if 
1)  the employee requests the leave; and 
2)  the  Chief Justice determines  the  employee  has  shown  good  cause  for  taking 

emergency leave; and 

3)  the Chief Justice believes in good faith that the employee being granted the leave 
intends to return to the employee’s position upon expiration of the leave granted. 

Guidelines  for  emergency leave are  provided  below  in  this  policy  section.

  T

ot later than October 1 of each year, the Chief Justice or the Chief Justice’s  designee shall report 
to the Comptroller  the  name  and  position  of  each  Court employee  granted  more  than  32  hours 
of emergency leave during the previous state fiscal year, the reason for the granting of such leave, 
and the total number of hours of emergency leave granted to the employee in the state fiscal year. 

mergency Leave due to Death in the Family: The Chief Justice may grant reasonable time off 
with  pay  to  a  Court  employee  due to the death of the employee's spouse, child, parent, sibling, 
grandparent, or grandchild or a child, parent, sibling, grandparent, or grandchild of the employee’s 
spouse.  For  the  purpose  of  this  policy,  the  term  sibling  includes  an  employee’s  stepbrother or 
stepsister.  The employee, however,  is  not  eligible  for  this  leave  if  the employee  is  in  an  unpaid 
absence status at the time emergency leave is to commence.  [Tex. Gov’t Code § 661.902(a)] 

mergency Leave due to Inclement Weather or Observance of a Holiday:  The Chief Justice 
may grant emergency leave because the Court is closed due to weather conditions or in observance 
of a holiday.  [Tex. Gov’t Code § 661.902(c)] 

mergency Leave During Agency Investigation: The Chief Justice may grant emergency leave 
to a Court employee who is the subject of an investigation being conducted by the Court. The Court 
employee who is subject to an agency investigation is ineligible to receive leave  for that reason 
under any other provision of Subchapter Z, Chapter 661 of the Government Code.  Not later than 
the last day of each quarter, the Court shall report to the State Auditor and the Legislative Budget 
Board each Court employee who has been granted 168 hours or more of leave under this provision 
during  the  fiscal  quarter.  The  report  must  include  a  brief  statement  as  to  the  reason  each  such 
employee remains on leave. [Tex. Gov’t Code § 661.923] 

he Chief  Justice  of the  Court may also grant emergency leave to a Court  employee who is the 

victim of, or a witness to, an act or event that is the subject of a Court investigation. 
Medical and Mental Health Leave for Certain Veterans:  A Court employee who is a veteran 
as defined by section 434.023(a) of the Government Code and is eligible to receive health benefits 
under  a  program  administered  by  the  Veterans  Health  Administration  (VHA)  of  the  U.S. 
Department of Veterans Affairs may be granted emergency leave without loss of vacation time, 
sick leave, earned overtime credit, or state compensatory time to obtain medical or mental health 
care administered by VHA, including physical rehabilitation. Leave granted under this provision 
may  not  exceed  15  days  each  fiscal  year,  unless  the  C h i e f   J u s t i c e   determines  it  is 
appropriate  to  grant  additional  days  of  emergency  leave.  [Tex.  Gov’t  Code  § 661.924]

exercising its right to terminate the employee. 

d.  The recipient of emergency leave is not to work elsewhere while on emergency leave. 
e.  If the employee does not utilize the full grant of the emergency leave, then any remaining 

unused emergency leave expires upon the employee’s return to work.

Voting 
 

The Fourteenth Court encourages all employees to exercise their right to vote in all 
elections and, pursuant to state statute, will allow an employee sufficient time off, without a 
deduction in salary or accrued leave, to vote in each national, state, and local election.  The 
Fourteenth Court defines "sufficient time off" to mean not more than 3 hours away from the 
employee's workstation.   

Donation of Blood 

 

 

 

An employee is allowed sufficient time off with pay to donate blood up to four times 
in a fiscal year.  The Fourteenth Court defines "sufficient time off" to mean not more than 3  
hours away from the employee's desk.   

Before an employee takes time off to donate blood, a request for the time off must be 
approved in writing by the employee's supervisor.  On returning to work, an employee shall 
provide proof that the employee donated blood during the time off.  If an employee fails to 
provide proof of the blood donation, the Fourteenth Court shall deduct the amount of time 
for which the employee was granted time off from the employee's salary or accrued leave, 
whichever the employee chooses.  TEX.  GOV=T CODE 661.917.   

Employee Training/MCLE  
 

 

The  time  that  an  employee  is  allowed  for  attendance  at  training  or  minimum 
continuing legal education (MCLE) seminars is time for which the employee receives pay. 

IV.  FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT (FMLA)

  H

 

. 

  I

he Department of Labor's Fact Sheet 28 describes the rights and responsibilities 
of  the  employer  and  employee  under  the  Family  and  Medical  Leave  Act  (FMLA). 
Additional  information  may  be  found  on  the  Department  of  Labor  posters  on  bulletin 
boards in the break rooms.  General information is set out below. 

  T

This section IV does not apply to elected officials or unpaid interns. 

Purpose of FMLA 

FMLA  requires  an  employer  to  provide  an  eligible  employee  with  up  to  12 
workweeks  of  unpaid,  job-protected  leave  during  a  12-month  period  of  time  for  certain 
family and medical reasons.  An employee who takes FMLA leave must be returned to the 
same job, or a job with equivalent status, benefits, and pay. 

Availability of FMLA Unpaid Leave 

An eligible employee may take a total of 12 weeks unpaid FMLA leave for: 

•  The birth of a son or daughter or placement of a son or daughter with the employee 

• 
• 

• 

for adoption or foster care;  
 To care for a spouse, son, daughter, or parent who has a serious health condition;  
 For  a  serious  health  condition  that  makes  the  employee  unable  to  perform  the 
essential functions of his or her job; or  
 For any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that a spouse, son, daughter, or 
parent is a military member on covered active duty or call to covered active duty 
status.  
. 
Serious Health Condition 

A serious health condition is defined as an illness, injury, impairment, or physical 

or mental condition that involves: 
 

• 
• 

inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential care facility; 
the absence of more than three calendar days from work that also involves 
continuing treatment by a health care provider; 

•  any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for prenatal care; 
•  a chronic serious health condition (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.); 
•  a period of incapacity that is permanent or long-term, due to a condition for 
which  treatment  may  not  be  effective  (e.g.,  Alzheimer's,  stroke,  terminal 
diseases); 

•  any  absences  to  receive  multiple  treatments  that  would  likely  result  in 
incapacity  for  more  than  three  consecutive  days  if  left  untreated  (e.g., 

. 

  A

 

. 

  B

   

 

C. 
 

chemotherapy, physical therapy, dialysis, etc.). 

 
Intermittent Leave or a Reduced Work Schedule 

FMLA permits the use of intermittent leave or work on a reduced schedule when: 

•  medically necessary to care for a seriously ill family member, or because of 

• 

the employee's serious health condition or 
to  care  for  a  newborn  or  newly  placed  adopted  or  foster  care  child,  if 
approved by the employer.   

State of Texas and the FMLA 

1. 

Use of Paid and Unpaid Leave 

A State of Texas employee is entitled to FMLA leave if the employee has a total of 
at least 12 months of state service and has worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month 
period immediately preceding the commencement of leave.  A State employee is required 
to utilize all available paid vacation and sick leave while taking FMLA unpaid leave.  Paid 
and unpaid leave are exhausted concurrently, not consecutively.   

owever, when an employee on FMLA leave is also receiving temporary disability 
benefits  payments  or  workers'  compensation  benefits,  the  employee  is  not  required  to 
utilize paid vacation or sick leave concurrently with the FMLA leave.  TEX. GOV’T CODE 
ANN. 661.912 Family and Medical Leave Act. 
 

2. 

Health Insurance During FMLA Leave 

  H

When all paid leave has been exhausted, the State will continue to pay its portion of 
the  employee's  premium  for  coverage  under  the  group  health  plan.    During  the  unpaid 
FMLA leave period, the employee must pay his or her portion of the insurance premium 
above the state-paid portion. 
 

If  an  employee  fails  to  return  to  work  after  taking  FMLA  leave,  the  State  may 

recover the health care premiums it paid on behalf of the employee.  
 

3. 

Effect of FMLA Leave 
 

Service credit, annual leave, or sick leave is not earned for any full calendar months 
of leave without pay while on FMLA.  This time is also not included in the calculation of 
the number of continuous months of employment for purposes of merit increases and leave.

  F

 

1.  Method Used to Calculate Eligibility 

 

Eligibility  for  the  12-week  leave  period  is  calculated  for  the  12-month  period 

measured forward from the date any employee’s first FMLA leave begins.  
 

2. 

Designation of Leave and Notice by Employer 
 

The Fourteenth Court  must designate leave,  paid or unpaid, as FMLA-qualifying 
and will provide notice to the employee of the designation.  Once the Fourteenth Court has 
acquired knowledge that the leave is for an FMLA reason, the employee will be notified 
that any applicable accrued paid leave will be designated as FMLA leave, will be reported 
in the State's timekeeping system as FMLA leave, and the leave will be counted against the 
12-week FMLA leave entitlement.   
 

Notice of the designation should be provided to the employee within two business 
days.  Leave cannot be retroactively designated as FMLA leave, unless the employee was 
absent  for  an  FMLA  reason  and  the  Fourteenth  Court  did  not  learn  the  reason  until the 
employee's return to work. 
 

3. 

Notice by the Employee 
 

When the need for FMLA leave is foreseeable, the employee is required to provide 
a written 30-day advance notice before the leave is to begin.  The notice should include the 
anticipated  timing  and  duration  of  the  leave.    Notice  must  be  provided  as  soon  as 
practicable  if  the  dates  of  the  leave  change,  are  extended,  or  were  not  initially  known.  
When the need for FMLA leave is not foreseeable, notice must be provided "as soon as 
practicable" under the particular circumstances. “As soon as practicable” means under the 
particular  circumstances,  but,  at  the  least,  verbal  notice  should  be  provided  within  two 
business days of when the need for leave becomes known to the employee. 
 

Whether  the  need  for  FMLA  leave  is  foreseeable  or  not,  the  employee  should 
provide information sufficient to make the Fourteenth Court aware that the employee needs 
FMLA-qualifying leave, the anticipated timing and the duration.  Failure to provide notice, 
with no reasonable excuse for the delay, may delay the taking of FMLA leave until at least 
30 days after the date the employee provides the required notice. 
 

The  Fourteenth  Court  may  inquire  further,  if  it  is  necessary  to  have  more 
information about the need for the FMLA leave.  Any medical information the employee 
provides will be stored in the employee's confidential medical file and kept separate from 
the personnel file.  

 

4. 

Standard Leave Forms Required 

 

 

In addition to providing notice, an employee is required to complete the Fourteenth 

Court's standard leave forms and follow its procedures for taking leave.   
 

5.  Medical Certification Required for Serious Health Condition 

For a serious health condition, the Fourteenth Court requires a medical certification 
confirming that such a condition exists.  Once leave has been granted, the employee may 
be required to provide updated medical information on a periodic basis.  To return to work 
when an absence was caused by a serious health condition, the employee must provide a 
"fitness-for-duty" certificate from the health care provider.

V

.  EMPLOYEE SICK LEAVE POOL POLICY 

his section V does not apply to elected officials or unpaid interns.  

he Employee Sick Leave Pool (the Pool) consists of accrued sick leave which is 
voluntarily donated to the Pool by eligible employees of the Fourteenth Court of Appeals.  
The Pool is intended to assist employees and their immediate families in dealing with a 
catastrophic illness or injury that forces them to exhaust all earned leave time or when the 
employee has exhausted all sick leave because of a previous donation of time to the Pool. 

Pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  TEX.  GOV’T  CODE  ANN.  661.001-661.008,  the 

Employee Sick Leave Pool Policy is established for the Fourteenth Court of Appeals.

been defined by the Employees Retirement System of Texas). 
 

Licensed  practitioner  means  a  practitioner,  as  defined  in  the  Texas  Insurance 

Code, who is practicing within the scope of the practitioner’s license. 
 

Immediate family means (1) an individual who resides in the same household as 
the  employee  and  is  related  by  kinship,  adoption,  or  marriage;  (2)  a  foster  child  of  the 
employee  who  resides  in  the  same  household  as  the  employee  and  who  is  under  the 
conservatorship of the Department of Protective and Regulatory Services; (3) a minor child 
of the employee, regardless of whether the child lives in the same household. 

n employee may also apply for permission to withdraw time from the Pool for a 
spouse, child, or parent of the employee who is not included in the definition of immediate 
family,  but  who  needs  care  and  assistance  as  a  direct  result  of  a  documented  medical 
condition.  Any such time requested and withdrawn is strictly limited to the time necessary 
to provide care and assistance for the documented medical condition. 
 

Earned leave time means all accrued sick, vacation, and compensatory time.

.  General Provisions 

 

. 

  C

 

  D

 

An  employee  of  the  Fourteenth  Court  of  Appeals,  other  than  a  state  official,  is 
eligible  to  use  time  contributed  to  the  Pool,  if  the  employee  has  exhausted  all  of  the 
employee's earned leave time because of (1) a catastrophic illness or injury or (2) a previous 
donation of time to the Pool and, the employee will be forced to lose compensation from 
the State. 
 

An employee may not receive sick leave from the Pool in excess of one-third of the 

total time in the Pool or 90 days, whichever is less. 
 

An  eligible  employee  may  apply  to  the  Pool  Administrator  for  permission  to 
withdraw leave time from the Pool for the employee's own catastrophic illness or injury, 

or for a catastrophic illness or injury of a member of the employee's immediate family. 
 

If  the  employee  is  seeking  to  withdraw  time  because  of  a  catastrophic  illness  or 
injury, the employee must provide the Pool Administrator with a written statement from 
the licensed practitioner who is treating the employee or the employee's immediate family 
member.   
 

The statement must provide sufficient information regarding the illness or injury to 
enable  the  Pool  Administrator  to  evaluate  the  employee's  eligibility.    If  the  Pool 
Administrator determines that the employee  is eligible, the Pool Administrator shall (1) 
approve the transfer of time from the Pool to the employee and (2) credit the time to the 
employee on the Fourteenth Court's leave records. 
 

An employee with a catastrophic illness or injury is not required to contribute to the 

Pool before the employee may apply to use Pool leave. 
 

An employee who uses leave from the Pool is not required to pay that leave time 

back to the Pool. 
 

If the employee is a contributing member of the Pool, the employee may apply to 
use the Pool for other than catastrophic illness or injury, when the employee has exhausted 
the employee’s sick leave balance in the same fiscal  year.  Such employee may receive 
credit for only the number of hours they have contributed to the Pool in the same fiscal 
year for absences other than those caused by catastrophic illness or injury. 
 

An employee must exhaust all earned leave time before the employee is eligible to 
use  leave  from  the  Pool.    However,  an  employee  who  is  off  work  due  to  an  on-the-job 
injury or illness is not required to exhaust annual or compensatory leave before becoming 
eligible to use leave from the Pool. 
 

An employee who has terminated from the Fourteenth Court due to retirement may 
withdraw  Pool  contributions  within  90  days  of  rehire  to  the  Fourteenth  Court.    Such 
employee may receive credit for only the number of hours the employee has contributed to 
the Pool in the same fiscal year as retirement. 
 

An  employee  absent  on  time  withdrawn  from  the  Pool  may  use  the  time  as  sick 
leave  earned  by  the  employee,  and  the  employee  is  treated  for  all  purposes  as  if  the 
employee were absent on earned sick leave. 
 

An  employee's  request  to  withdraw  time  from  the  Pool  more  than  once  during  a 
fiscal  year  will  be  reviewed  by  the  Pool  Administrator  on  the  facts  and  documentation 
submitted specific to the necessity for the multiple requests.  The facts and documentation 
supporting the request will be submitted to the Human Resources Committee and the Chief 

Justice before a final decision is made to grant or deny the additional withdrawal of time. 

he  estate  of  a  deceased  employee  is  not  entitled  to  payment  for  unused  time 

withdrawn by the employee from the Pool. 

 
Contributing Sick Leave to the Pool 

E. 

 

Contributions to the Pool are strictly voluntary on the part of each employee. But 

employees are encouraged to contribute to the Pool. 

n employee may contribute to the Pool one or more days of the employee's accrued 
sick  leave.    The  Pool  Administrator  shall  credit  the  Pool  with  the  amount  of  time 
contributed by the employee and shall deduct a corresponding amount of time from the 
employee's earned sick leave as if the employee had used the time for personal purposes. 

 contribution to the Pool by an active employee must be in increments of 8 hours, but a 
retiring employee may contribute accrued sick leave in increments of less than 8 hours. A 
retiring employee may designate the number of the retiring employee's accrued sick leave 
hours to be used for retirement credit and the number of the retiring employee's accrued 
sick leave hours to be donated to the Pool. An employee who makes a contribution to the 
Pool may not stipulate who is to receive that contribution.
