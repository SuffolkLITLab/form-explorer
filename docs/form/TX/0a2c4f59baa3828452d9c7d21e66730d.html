Appendix B 
Language Access and Remote Interpretation 
 

itigants and other court patrons who have limited English proficiency need language assistance services 
such as interpretation and translation to access the courts and resolve their legal problems. The same 
laws and rules about language access in Texas courts still apply when courts are partially closed and 
many proceedings are virtual. Below is a recap of the relevant law and some quick tips on best practices 
for how to provide meaningful access to justice for LEP persons in remote hearings. Many of these 
recommendations are also best practices under normal circumstances.

1. 

Important Terms 

• 

• 

• 

Limited English Proficient – Individuals who do not speak English as their primary language 
and who have limited ability to read, speak, write, or understand English can be limited 
English proficient, or "LEP." It is important to note that someone can be English proficient in 
certain contexts but not in others. For example, they may know enough English to 
accomplish basic tasks like small talk and grocery shopping, but not enough to understand 
what the teacher is saying at a parent conference or participate in a court proceeding. The 
English proficiency needed in legal settings is much higher than what most people need in 
typical daily encounters, which is why legal information and court proceedings can be 
difficult even for many native English speakers to understand, and why people who know 
some English often need language assistance services in court. See below for some sample 
questions to help you assess whether a person would benefit from an interpreter in court. 
Language access – An umbrella term encompassing the idea that people with limited English 
proficiency (LEP) are entitled to meaningful access to programs and services. It implies the 
existence of laws and policies and the availability of services and supports to ensure that 
access is not significantly restricted, delayed, or inferior as compared to English proficient 
individuals. 
Interpretation – When a competent interpreter listens to something in one language 
(source language) and orally translates it into another language (target language).  

•  Translation – When a competent translator renders written text from one language (source 

language) into an equivalent written text in another language (target language). 
•  Sight translation - The reading of text written in one language (source language) by a 

competent interpreter who orally translates it into another language (target language).  
•  Vital document - A document that contains information critical for obtaining access to 

justice. Some examples of vital documents that courts may need to translate to ensure that 
LEP individuals are provided meaningful access can include information about and 
applications for programs, benefits, or services; intake forms; court forms; consent or 
complaint forms; notices of rights; letters or notices that require a response or responsive 
action; or orders that prohibit or compel conduct; and information about language 
assistance services.  

•  Simultaneous interpretation - When a competent interpreter listens to something in one 
language (source language) and orally translates it into another language (target language) 
in real-time without pauses. 

•  Consecutive interpretation – When a competent interpreter listens to something in one 

language (source language) and orally translates it into another language (target language) 
while the speaker pauses to allow for the interpretation before continuing. 

 

itle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 
Title VI and its implementing regulations prohibit national origin discrimination in court programs 
and services, whether criminal, civil, or administrative.1 The regulations prohibit discriminatory 
conduct such as providing a service or benefit that is different, or provided in a different manner, 
from what is provided to others under the program or that restricts in any way the enjoyment of any 
advantage or privilege enjoyed by others under the program on the basis of national origin.2  The 
regulations also prohibit administering programs in a manner that has the effect of discriminating in 
those ways or “substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program” based on 
national origin.3  In 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court held that Title VI’s prohibition against 
discrimination on the basis of national origin includes discrimination against LEP individuals based 
on language.4  

his means that courts must “ensure that LEP parties and witnesses receive competent language 
services … At a minimum, every effort should be taken to ensure competent interpretation for LEP 
individuals during all hearings, trials, and motions during which the LEP individual must and/or may 
be present.” In situations where courts typically rely on written communication, translating 
documents that are vital to providing meaningful access is also required.5 Language assistance must 
be provided free of charge.6   

Texas Government Code Chapter 57 
Section 57.002 defines when a judge must appoint a licensed court interpreter7 and when a judge 
may appoint an unlicensed court interpreter. It also describes the minimum criteria an unlicensed 
interpreter must meet to be appointed in a court proceeding. It applies to all courts and both civil 
and criminal proceedings. Because the language of the statute has become somewhat convoluted 
over the years, we have summarized its requirements in the charts below for simplicity’s sake.  

he first chart illustrates when a judge is required to appoint an interpreter and when the judge has 
discretion to appoint an interpreter. The second chart is for after a judge decides to appoint an 
interpreter either because a motion was filed, a request was made, or the judge decided sua sponte 
that an interpreter is needed to provide meaningful access to the proceeding for an LEP person. It 
illustrates when a judge must appoint a licensed court interpreter and when a court has discretion 
to appoint an unlicensed court interpreter. It also shows what minimum criteria an unlicensed court 
interpreter must meet to interpret in a Texas court proceeding.

7 There are two types of licenses for Texas court interpreters: a basic license that authorizes you to interpret in 
municipal and justice courts, and a master license that authorizes you to interpret in any Texas court. When you 
hire a licensed interpreter, be sure they hold the appropriate license for your court.  

Step One: Are you required to appoint an interpreter?

8 Tex. Gov. Code. Sec. 57.002(a). 
9 Tex. Gov. Code Sec. 57.001(7) states a “court proceeding” “includes an arraignment, deposition, mediation, 
court-ordered arbitration, or other form of alternative dispute resolution.” 
10 Tex. Gov. Code Sec. 57.002(b). Note the statute does not specify that the person must be a party or a witness. 
An example of a situation where a court may elect to appoint an interpreter for an LEP person who is not a party or 
witness is when the parent of a minor who is a party or witness has limited English proficiency and needs an 
interpreter to comprehend the proceeding affecting his or her child. In some cases involving minors, state law 
includes parents and guardians in the definition of “party” or “plaintiff,” but the court may appoint an interpreter 
for the parent even in cases where they are not explicitly a “party.” 
11 The counties with a population over 50,000 that aren’t subject to Tex. Civ. Prac. Rem. Code Sec. 21.021 are

estimates from the Census Bureau. All other counties already had a population of at least 50,000 in 2010 when the 
last census was completed.

Code of Criminal Procedure 38.30  
Requires a court to appoint an interpreter upon a party’s motion or upon the court’s motion if the 
accused or a witness does not have English proficiency.13 Before Section 57.002 became law, “any 
person” could be appointed as an interpreter in criminal proceedings regardless of their 
qualifications. However, as of 2001, when a court appoints an interpreter in a criminal proceeding, 
the interpreter must fulfill the requirements of 57.002.14 The statute also requires the county to pay 
for the interpreter in criminal proceedings. 

exas Rule of Civil Procedure 183 
A court may appoint an interpreter and may tax the interpreter fee as costs unless the law provides 
otherwise or the litigant has filed an uncontested Statement of Inability to Afford Costs pursuant to 
Tex. R. Civ. Proc. 145.

understand the English language, unless the defendant expressly waives the right to a licensed interpreter); Franco

article 38.30 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure). See also Op. Tex. Att’y Gen. No. JC-0584 (2001) (concluding 
that when a court appoints a spoken-language interpreter in a criminal case, chapter 57 establishes the requisite 
interpreter qualifications. Therefore, the interpreter must be licensed under chapter 57 unless the section 
57.002(c) exception applies.).

to pay costs issued after an oral evidentiary hearing. “Costs” as defined by Rule 145 include the fees 
for an interpreter or translator. Therefore, LEP parties who file a Statement of Inability to Afford 
Payment of Court Costs must not be charged for the language assistance services they need to have 
meaningful access to the court. 

oom 
Interpretation can be provided remotely in virtual proceedings on Zoom both simultaneously and 
consecutively.15 Zoom allows for simultaneous interpretation by providing a separate audio channel 
that only the LEP person will hear. You can also use “breakout” rooms when an interpreter is 
needed for an attorney and client to have a private conversation during a proceeding. See How to 
Use Simultaneous Interpretation in Zoom Proceedings for detailed instructions about remote 
interpretation in Zoom for more information about scheduling the proceeding with an interpreter 
and using the interpreter controls during the proceeding.  

 

What to do Before the Proceeding 

•  Notice – As mentioned in the Best Practices for Court in Zoom Hearings Involving SRLs, 

include with your notice Spanish (and any other languages common in your jurisdiction) 
instructions about how to contact the court for language assistance. Using an interpreter 
icon can also help LEP persons who speak languages other than Spanish or who have low 
literacy. Language assistance may include translation or sight translation of the notice and 
interpretation for the proceeding(s).  

•  The LEP Person – When you learn an LEP person will need an interpreter for a remote 

proceeding, confirm their preferred language to ensure you select an interpreter that will be 
able to communicate with them. Be sure to find out if they need any specific dialect. Some 
languages vary greatly between dialects. Also determine if the person has the technology 
they need to participate remotely. The simultaneous interpretation feature in Zoom will 
only work if the LEP person is able to join via the internet through a computer or other 
device. It will not work if they call in over the phone. They will need stable access to the 
internet and the latest version of Zoom to participate.16 If they don’t, you can still use a 
remote interpreter via Zoom, but the interpretation will need to be consecutive instead of 
simultaneous and you will need to plan for a longer proceeding.  

•  The Interpreter  

  Selecting an Interpreter: After confirming the preferred language of the LEP person, 
you will need to select an interpreter. If you already have an interpreter for your 
court in the language you need, this will be easy. If not, you may be able to find an 
interpreter through an existing contract your court or county already has, or you 
may need to hire an interpreter independently. If the language is Spanish and the 
proceeding is going to be short, you can use OCA’s Texas Court Remote Interpreter 
Service (TCRIS) to schedule a free interpreter. For remote proceedings you also have

15 Most Texas courts are using Zoom for remote proceeding so we are focusing on Zoom here. If your court is using 
a different platform such as WebEx and you need help developing protocols for remote interpretation, you may 
contact the Texas Access to Justice Commission by emailing atjmail@texasatj.org.  
16 Some of the earlier versions of Zoom do not include the interpreter function. 

the option of hiring licensed interpreters from anywhere in the state.17 Similarly, 
where the law allows you to hire an unlicensed interpreter and a licensed one is not 
available, you can hire an interpreter from anywhere without incurring travel costs. 
Just remember that even unlicensed interpreters must meet the minimum 
requirements in Section 57.002.  

  Sample Questions to Help Assess Interpresters: These questions can be used to 
assess an interpreter you are considering hiring for a proceeding or to assess an 
interpreter prior to appointing them and swearing them in during the proceeding.18 

o  Are you a Texas licensed court interpreter? 
o  What is your license level and number? 
o  How long have you been an interpreter? 
o  How many times have you interpreted in court? 
o  What credentials or specialized training do you hold? 
o  Describe the Texas Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility for 

Licensed Court Interpreters.  

  Best Practice Tip: Please note that if the proceeding is expected to be long or 
complex, the best practice is to hire two interpreters to interpret as a team by 
switching off approximately every 30 minutes. This is because the cognitive load of 
interpreting for long stretches is very taxing and the longer an interpreter 
interprets, the more likely they are to make mistakes. In fact, the accuracy of most 
interpreters begins to show a measurable decline after 30 minutes of interpreting. 
The cognitive load of remote interpretation is even higher than on-site 
interpretation, so team interpretation may be even more useful for longer remote 
proceedings. Taking regular breaks is another option if you are unable to use an 
interpreter team for a long or complex proceeding. 

  Technology Needs for Interpreter: In addition to ensuring that the interpreter you 
select meets the requirements of Section 57.002, for remote proceedings you will 
also want to ensure that they have what they need to minimize the chances of any 
problems with the technology that could cause a delay. For example, they will need 
a computer or other device, webcam, headset and the latest version of Zoom on 
their device, as well as stable internet access and a place to work with minimal 
background noise and distractions. If they have never used Zoom for remote 
interpretation before, you may wish to arrange a practice run with them prior to the 
proceeding to ensure everything is going to work properly.19  

  Provide Pleadings or Documents: Provide the interpreter with the pleadings or other 

documents that are relevant to the proceeding to familiarize themselves with 
names, parties, and unique vocabulary. 
Inform Litigant: Once you have arranged for the interpreter, let the litigant know in 
their preferred language that you have done so. Knowing there will be an

17 Other options for finding competent interpreters are the Texas Association of Judiciary Interpreters and 
Translators, Metroplex Interpreters and Translators Association, Houston Interpreters and Translators Association, 
El Paso Interpreters and Translators Association, Austin Area Translators and Interpreters Association, National 
Association of Judiciary Interpreters and Translators, and American Translators Association. 
18 Here is an example video of assessing an interpreter prior to appointing them and swearing them in: Example of 
Court Interpreter's Interview to Verify Credentials.  
19 You may wish to share this video from the University of Arizona National Center for Interpretation with the 
interpreter. It is geared toward interpreters and provides a detailed explanation of using Zoom for remote 
interpretation: Expanding your Toolbox: Using Zoom for Remote Simultaneous Interpreting (RSI). 

 

interpreter can help reduce the anxiety for the litigant and give them an opportunity 
to focus on other aspects of preparing for their proceeding.  

During the Proceeding 

 

•  See How to Use Simultaneous Interpretation in Zoom Proceedings for detailed information 

about using the interpretation features and conducting a remote hearing in Zoom.  

•  Explain the role of the interpreter to the LEP person including the following: 

  The interpreter will interpret everything said in the proceeding with no additions, 

omissions, explanations, or personal input. 

  The interpreter cannot give advice, make suggestions, or engage in private 

conversation with the LEP person.  

  The LEP person should raise a hand if s/he has a question or does not understand 
something during the proceeding rather than asking the interpreter to explain it. 
•  Perform a sound check including allowing the interpreter and LEP party to assess whether 

they can hear and understand each other.  
Instruct participants on these best practices before you begin: 

• 

  Speak slowly, clearly, and one at a time. Whenever possible use plain language and 

avoid “legalese” and unnecessary terms of art.  

  Speak directly to the participants as you normally would in court, not to the 

interpreter. 

  Do not ask the interpreter to explain or restate what the LEP person said. 
  During consecutive interpretation such as witness testimony, use short, complete 
sentences and pause after each complete thought to allow for interpretation.  
  Open any statement to the interpreter with “Mr./Ms./Mx. [Interpreter Name]” or 
“Mr./Ms./Mx. Interpreter” to alert the interpreter that they are being addressed. 

  Encourage the interpreter to request repetitions or clarifications as needed 

throughout the proceeding. 

 

  Attorneys representing LEP litigants may use a Zoom breakout room to consult with 
their client if necessary. If they need an interpreter, the interpreter will be able to 
join them in the breakout room. 
Immediately alert the court if they are unable to hear or understand the participant 
who is speaking, or if the equipment they are using is not working properly. 
Instruct all participants about what to do if they get disconnected due to a problem 
with the internet or other technology including providing contact information for a 
staff person who will be responsive if needed. 

 

  Give basic instructions about what the participants can expect and need to do to use 

the interpreter mode in Zoom. 

•  Ask the interpreter to say and spell their name for the record and what type of license they 

hold, if any, and to state their license number for the record. 

•  Administer the interpreter’s oath.20 
•  Red Flags: During simultaneous interpretation only the LEP person will hear the 

interpretation, but during consecutive interpretation be aware of these red flags that may 
indicate poor quality interpretation: 

                                                           
20 Tex. R. Evidence 604 requires that interpreters are qualified and take an oath. Sample interpreter’s oath: “Do 
you solemnly swear or affirm that you will interpret accurately, completely and impartially, using your best skill 
and judgment in accordance with the standards prescribed by law and the Code of Ethics and Professional 
Responsibility; follow all official guidelines established by this court for legal interpreting; and discharge all of the 
duties and obligations of legal interpretation?” 

 

  The interpretation is much longer or much shorter than what was said in the source 

language. 

  The LEP person repeatedly asks for repetition or clarification. 
  The LEP person appears to be correcting or disagreeing with the interpreter. 
  The LEP person attempts to speak in English without using the interpreter. 
  The interpreter doesn’t seem to have a strong command of English. 
  There are non-verbal cues on the part of the interpreter or LEP person that indicate 

  The interpreter doesn’t appear to take notes, especially for names, numbers, and 

there is some sort of problem. 

long segments of speech. 

  The interpreter seems to be engaging in side conversations.  
  The interpreter has an inappropriate facial expression or tone. This could indicate 

the interpreter is not neutral or is biased in some way that could affect the accuracy 
of the interpretation. 

  The interpreter answers for the LEP person or attempts to explain or elaborate on 

the LEP person’s answer. 

  The interpreter attempts to modify or discredit the LEP person’s answer. 
  The LEP person appears unusually uncomfortable or confused or has an 

inappropriate facial expression or tone. 

•  When Party or Witness Has Difficulty Communicating: If you are in a proceeding without an 
interpreter and a litigant or witness is having difficulty communicating, these are some 
questions you can ask to assess whether an interpreter may be needed. Avoid questions 
that can be answered with a yes or no and try using questions that are slightly more 
complex to approximate the type of language that is common in court. If the person has 
difficulty answering these questions in a meaningful way, an interpreter is recommended. 

  Please tell the court your name. 
  How did you arrive at court today? 
 
  Tell me about your education. 
  How comfortable are you proceeding with the matter as we are communicating 

In what language do you feel most comfortable speaking and communicating? 

  What is the purpose of your court hearing today? 
  To help me evaluate your English language proficiency, would you be willing to 
describe for me a scenario in which you may have found it challenging to 
communicate effectively in spite of familiarity with the content? 

now?  

 

After the Proceeding 
If there is a written decision or order, especially one that prohibits or compels action of any kind, 
enumerates rights or responsibilities, or requires a response or action to be taken, it is probably a 
vital document that needs to be translated for the LEP person.21 

                                                           
21 See State of Vermont v. Onix Fonseca-Citron, No. 2018-197 (Vt. June 12, 2020) (order granting Defendant’s 
request for translation of the Supreme Court’s opinion affirming his conviction pursuant to Title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964). See also Michael W. Finigan, Ph.D. and Theresa Herrera Allen, Ph.D., Evaluation of the 
Introduction of Plain Language Forms with a Spanish Translation in Two Family Court Settings (October 2016), 
https://richardzorza.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/plain-language-report_10-24-16.pdf (Spanish-speakers in Travis 
County, Texas who did not receive their protective orders in Spanish were three times more likely to violate them 
than those who received their order in Spanish. The reduction in enforcement proceedings saved the court over 
$100,000 in a six week period.)

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
