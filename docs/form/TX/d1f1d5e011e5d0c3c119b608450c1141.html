Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)9/2/2022  3:26:31PM227 Seventh Court of Appeals District, Amarillo88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's StatementTexas’ intermediate appellate courts have weathered serious challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 ransomware attack.  The effect of these challenges continue.   into the foreseeable future. The courts have not been fully funded since 2015 yet have dutifully risen to the task as can be seen by the dramatic decline in the number of cases pending in the courts of appeals. Respectfully, additional funding is now necessary to ensure the efficient administration of justice going forward.The core function of Texas intermediate appellate courts is to process, review, and decide appeals from trial courts in civil and criminal cases. Population growth across the State and the magnitude of annual case filings, in concert with an ever-increasing number of case types requiring expedited review, make clear that the courts of appeals need sufficient resources to manage their busy dockets and provide the high quality of justice to which the citizens of Texas are entitled. Although case filings decreased in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic, filings have, unsurprisingly, returned to pre-pandemic levels as of June 2022 and are expected to continue to increase as trial courts resume full operation. Furthermore, the Annual Statistical Report for 2021 reported that family violence cases increased at the highest rate over the past five years. We anticipate a rise in those and other types of appeals  over the next biennium. The courts of appeals, collectively, work toward a zero-based budget model referred to as Similar Funding for Same-Sized Courts. The model quantifies the funding required to meet the personnel and operational needs of the courts, thus enabling them to perform their core function and satisfy performance standards. The Similar Funding for Same-Sized Courts initiative was fully funded in 2015, and the courts have been operating under this zero-based budget model since that time. Since then, the demands of the core function of the courts have required higher-skilled and higher-salary positions. The prior model used salary classification levels for attorneys and staff that are now outdated. Additionally, operating costs for necessary resources such as Westlaw/LexisNexis and other administrative needs increased dramatically. Considering recent attacks on judges and an increase in mass shootings, more funds also are needed to provide adequate security for court personnel.While preparing for the upcoming legislative session, the Council of Chief Justices is keenly aware that the need for state funds to address the pandemic is the highest priority.  Because there were many uncertainties regarding the state of the economy and anticipated limitation on state revenues, agencies were asked to reduce budgets by 5%. The Council appreciated and respected the position of the state and, therefore, did not seek additional funding at that time. While the Council greatly appreciates that budgets of the courts of appeals in the last biennium were not cut, funding of the updated budget model is, nonetheless, now necessary. Accordingly, the budget model data has been further updated to reflect current operating needs.Since 1983, the work of the intermediate courts of appeals has been accomplished by 80 justices statewide. In that time, the population of Texas has nearly doubled. A key component to handling the ever-increasing workload without additional justices has been the employment of a highly skilled and trained professional workforce.  It includes appellate lawyers and clerical staff assisting justices in disposing of cases requiring extensive legal research and legal drafting.  Accompanying the normal appeals are growing numbers of accelerated and emergency matters necessitating disposition within statutorily set short time periods.  Appellate work requires use of personnel having specialized knowledge and significant experience.  Obtaining and retaining them has grown difficult due to enhanced competition from the private sector and other governmental entities.  Our transitioning to a new case management system in the next biennium will further strain limited resource.  Hiring and retaining qualified support staff is critical to the courts’ ability to manage their dockets and efficiently resolve the cases before them.Funding for all fourteen courts of appeals comprises merely 0.035% of the State budget as a whole. Yet, on average, 96.5% of each appellate court’s budget is dedicated to salaries and benefits. Without additional funding, appellate courts will be unable to attract and retain the highly trained and skilled support staff with the specialized knowledge and relevant experience critical to the courts’ function. Without sufficient qualified staff, courts cannot comply with Legislative mandates to give accelerated and preferential treatment to certain appeals, such as parental-termination and juvenile-certification appeals under the Family Code, mental-health appeals under the  Page 1 of 3Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)9/2/2022  3:26:31PM227 Seventh Court of Appeals District, Amarillo88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's StatementHealth and Safety Code, and interlocutory appeals under the Civil Practice and Remedies Code.All fourteen courts of appeals continue to expend resources to recover from the 2020 ransomware attack on the courts’ computer systems. The loss of data overall was substantial and continues to require resources to reconstitute work that could not be recovered. And while all State agencies experienced the negative effects of COVID-19, the combined effects of the ransomware attack plus COVID-19 created a unique hardship for the appellate courts.Texas’ intermediate appellate courts have weathered serious challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 ransomware attack.  The effect of these challenges continue.   into the foreseeable future. The courts have not been fully funded since 2015 yet have dutifully risen to the task as can be seen by the dramatic decline in the number of cases pending in the courts of appeals. Respectfully, additional funding is now necessary to ensure the efficient administration of justice going forward.EXCEPTIONAL ITEM #1: INCREASE THE GENERAL REVENUE LIMIT TO MEET THE UPDATED BUDGET MODELPrior to this LAR, the budget model had not been completely updated since 2005. Operating at this funding level has prevented the courts of appeals from increasing salaries to a level that will help the courts attract and retain the most qualified attorneys and staff. In FY 2021, the Judiciary had the third highest turnover rate in the state by General Appropriations Act Article at 14.5 percent.  Loss of key personnel will effect performance standards thus preventing the courts from reaching the disposition target of 100% of new appeals filed in the biennium. It will further result in an increase in the time from filing until disposition for remaining appeals.EXCEPTIONAL ITEM #2: JUDICIARY-WIDE INFLATION RELIEFInflation is diminishing the buying power of attorneys and staff. Many are struggling to pay mortgages, rent and other items necessary for their livelihood. A ten percent (10%) increase on the budget model salaries is sought to offset the current impact of inflation, diminish the effect of future inflation, and permit the courts of appeals to pay competitive salaries.  RIDER REQUESTS:The courts of appeals also request the following with regard to the across-the-board riders found in Article IV (p. IV-38):1. Retain Article IV rider, Sec. 3, Appellate Court Exemptions2. Retain Article IV rider, Sec. 5, Interagency Contracts for Assigned Judges for Appellate Courts3. Retain Article IV rider, Sec. 6, Appellate Court Transfer AuthorityHistorically, the Legislature has granted the courts exemption from certain limitations in the General Appropriations Act. They have also granted the courts the authority to carry over unexpended budget balances between years within the biennium. The flexibility afforded by these measures enhances the courts’ management ability, and we seek continuation of these budget features.ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS OF SUPPORT:In order for the courts of appeal to function efficiently, it is vital that the Office of Court Administration (OCA) be adequately funded.  The courts of appeal rely on many  Page 2 of 3Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)9/2/2022  3:26:31PM227 Seventh Court of Appeals District, Amarillo88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's Statementof the services provided by OCA.  They fully support the exceptional items the OCA requests as part of its funding.  More specifically, the courts of appeal strongly support the request for funding related to the acquisition of a new appellate case management system to replace the current system known as TAMES as well as a case-level data system.If the Legislature appropriates a cost-of-living increase to state employees, the courts of appeal request that all court employees be included.   Finally, the courts of appeal wish to express appreciation to and support for the Judicial Compensation Commission and the Legislature’s efforts to strengthen the justice system by increasing judicial salaries to attract and retain a strong judiciary.  The courts of appeal request implementation of the Judicial Compensation Commission’s recommendations.NOTE ON APPROPRIATED RECEIPTS:At the direction of the LBB & Governor’s Office, this Court has included appropriated receipts reflecting reimbursement for copies of opinions and other court documents.  These amounts are merely an offset for additional expenses incurred by the Court and do not constitute additional funds available for general expenditures for the Court.  The amount can vary significantly from year to year Page 3 of 3ORGANIZATION CHART – SEVENTH DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS

Without an increase in funding, appellate courts will lose talented personnel to higher-paying private jobs. This loss of key personnel will detrimentally effect performance standards, including (1) a reduction in overall dispositions of appeals, preventing the courts from clearing older cases and reaching the disposition target of 100% of new appeals filed in the biennium, and (2) an increase in the time from filing until disposition for those appeals which remain pending. Any unnecessary delay will be particularly devastating to the State by creating significant adverse consequences for the business, families, and children awaiting justice. Please note, the updated budget model does not address the impact of inflation.EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS:Prior to this LAR, the budget model had not been completely updated since 2005. Operating at this funding level has prevented many courts of appeals from increasing salaries to a level that will help the courts attract and retain the most qualified attorneys and staff. In FY 2021, the Judiciary had the third highest turnover rate in the state by General Appropriations Act Article at 14.5 percent.  Loss of key personnel jeopardizes court performance which impedes the thorough and efficient disposition of appeals within both acceptable and statutory efficiency measures.PCLS TRACKING KEY:4.A.

The impact has been devastating for many because the State has not given them a meaningful raise in a significant period of time. Their buying power for goods and services has diminished and has resulted in attrition from those seeking higher-paying jobs. If salaries are not increased, courts risk losing more trained personnel. Training of new hires takes time and delays the ability of a court to efficiently and timely perform its crucial functions.  On May 4, 2022, the Council of Chiefs submitted written testimony to the Senate Committee on Finance comprised of testimonials from court personnel describing personal experiences with rising costs. The Council asks this testimony be considered.  Consequently, the Seventh Court of Appeals joins in the judiciary-wide inflation relief for employees sought by Article IV courts and agencies. Respectfully, a ten percent (10%) increase on the budget model salaries is requested to offset inflation. This exceptional item is not duplicative of exceptional item 1 since the latter does not include an inflation factor.EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS:Inflation is diminishing the buying power of attorneys and staff. Many are struggling to pay mortgages, rent and other items necessary for their livelihood. A ten percent (10%) increase on the budget model salaries is sought to offset the current impact of inflation, diminish the effect of future inflation, and permit the courts of appeals to pay competitive salaries.4.A.

Historically Underutilized Business Supporting ScheduleThe Court continues to make a good faith effort to increase purchase and contract awards to HUB's. All other factors under the TX SmartBuy purchasing rules being equal, HUB vendors are given preference for any purchase to increase HUB participation. However, there are instances where HUB products or services are a great deal more costly than non-HUB, and under these circumstances the Court will choose the best value as it is incurring expenses using the taxpayer's dollars.6.A.

Constitutional or Statutory Creation and Use of Funds:

Texas Government Code Subchapter C, Section 22.2081

Method of Calculation and Revenue Assumptions:

The County Commissioners Court for each county within the Seventh District is required to set a court fee of $5 for each civil suit filed in a County 
Court, Court at Law, Probate Court, or District Court in the county.  The difference between FY 22-23 and the Estimated Beginning Balance in FY 2024 
is due to projected increased costs for moving expenses to a new Courts Buidling in 2023, additional security expenses, increasing travel expenses, 
addtional costs for assigned judges due to a vacancy at the Court, and inflation.
