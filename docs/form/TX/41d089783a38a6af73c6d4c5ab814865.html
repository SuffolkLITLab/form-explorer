PURPOSE OF THE OFFICE OF COURT ADMINISTRATION 

he Office of Court Administration (OCA) is an agency of the state in the Judicial Branch that provides resources and information for 
the efficient administration of the Judicial Branch of Texas. The agency operates under the direction of the Supreme Court of Texas 
and the Chief Justice. 

CA operates in conjunction with the Texas Judicial Council, which is the policy-making body for the Judicial Branch. The Council was 

created by the 41st Legislature to continuously study and report on the organization, rules, procedures and practice, work 
accomplished, results and uniformity of the discretionary powers of the state courts and methods for their improvement. 

CA provides resources to the Judicial Branch of Texas. These resources include the following: 

•  For trial courts - technical assistance, training, and research on court administration and court security; technology 

solutions for electronic filing, judicial case management, and remote technology solutions; language access services; 
assistance with monitoring guardianship cases for potential fraud and exploitation; and funding and standards for 
indigent defense services; 

•  For appellate courts, specialty courts, and judicial branch agencies - information technology solutions and fiscal 

consultation; 

•  For judicial branch regulatory boards and policymaking bodies - staffing and support; and 
•  For child protection and child support courts and the regional presiding judges - staffing and administration. 

CA provides information about the judicial branch to the public, the legislative and executive branches, state and federal agencies, 

local governments, private associations and public interest groups, and members of the bar, among others. These persons and 
organizations rely on OCA for information about the judicial branch, including statistics and analysis of court information and case 
activity, descriptions of the court system structure and jurisdiction, and results of comparative policy studies and other research 
affecting courts and the judiciary. 

CA provides staff support to a wide array of judicial branch boards, including the Texas Judicial Council, Judicial Committee on 
Information Technology, Council of Chief Justices, Conference of Regional Presiding Judges, State Board of Regional Judges for Title 
IV-D Account, Judicial Districts Board, Judicial Compensation Commission, Texas Indigent Defense Commission, Judicial Branch 
Certification Commission, and the Forensic Science Commission.

Page 1SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PROVISION OF SERVICES 
 

•  OCA’s role in providing guidance to the courts increased dramatically over the past two years due to the COVID-19 

Pandemic. The Supreme Court of Texas placed responsibility on OCA to provide regular guidance to courts on how to 
conduct court proceedings safely and in a virtual environment. In March of 2020, OCA provided Zoom licenses for all 
courts in the state to permit courts to conduct court proceedings remotely. Today, many court proceedings are hybrid 
where the judge is in the courtroom and one or more parties appear via Zoom. 

 

•  The court backlog created by the pandemic is significant. OCA has worked with jurisdictions to 
create backlog plans and is hosting a summit in the Fall of 2022 to train judges and court staff on 
best practices in caseflow management. Courts continue to make progress in reducing the backlog 
with district court’s clearance rates rising to 107 and 108 percent in April and May of 2022. 

District Court Clearance Rates March 2020-present 

 

               

Page 2Conducting in-person jury trials during the pandemic was difficult. The threat of going to 

• 
trial is a key tactic in moving cases forward. District courts have returned to pre-pandemic 
jury trial levels and jurisdictions are creating auxiliary courts staffed by visiting judges to 
quickly work through the backlog of cases. 
•  OCA received $3 million dollars in American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds (SB 8 87th 3rd 
called S.S.) to help address the court backlog. Funding is being used for data analysts, 
interpreters and training. The judiciary also received an additional $7 million dollars to 
support visiting judges and court staff. OCA has worked with the Regional Presiding Judges 
and Comptroller Judiciary Section to provide grants to counties with the highest backlogs. 
In July 2021, OCA began supporting local court systems impacted by Operation Lone Star. This ongoing support includes 
technical assistance, training, interpretation services, consulting services, and facilitation of central magistration. As of July 
31, 2022, visiting judges supported by OCA have magistrated 5,569 individuals through Operation Lone Star. 

• 

 

 

•  OCA was charged 

with implementing 
bail reform (87th 2nd 
called S.S. HB5/SB6.) 
Reforms included 
procuring and 
implementing the 
Public Safety Reports 
System to be used by 
all judges in setting 
bail. The system 
went live April 1, 
2022 and has more 
than 5,700 registered 
users. 
 

 

Page 3•  Demand for OCA’s language interpretation services continues to increase. From September 1, 2021, through June 30, 

2022, OCA interpreters provided interpreting services in 2,603 hearings in 113 counties. 

•  OCA continues to implement SB 31 (86th R.S.), which mandates that OCA create and maintain the Guardianship Abuse, 
Fraud, and Exploitation Deterrence Program. OCA has made significant progress toward assisting courts with protecting 
the elderly and incapacitated reviewing more than 65,000 guardianship cases in 196 counties and 245 courts. 

•  OCA signed a new contract for electronic filing, which is mandatory in all counties of the state in appellate, district, and 

county courts. The system includes many updates to enhance the eFiling experience for all users. 

•  OCA signed contracts for a uniform case management system funded by the 86th Legislature at the end of FY21. The 

system will permit counties who wish to use the system the ability to increase automation of functions and reporting to 
state and federal databases. The first counties are planned to come online in late Fall of 2022. 

IGNIFICANT EXTERNALITIES 

 

  S

 

• 

•  The Texas Judiciary closed out FY21 with more than 6.9 million filings and judges disposing of more than 6.4 million cases. 
The overall court backlog caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic was up 8 percent when comparing active pending cases from 
March 2020 versus active pending cases in August 2021. OCA expects case filings to continue to increase and return to or 
exceed pre-pandemic levels. 
In 2010 there were 3.8 million people in Texas age 60 and older that made up approximately 15 percent of the total Texas 
population. This population is expected to more than triple by 2050 growing to more than 12 million. Expectations are 
that the number of guardianships and dollar amounts in estates under guardianship will increase significantly as well. 
•  The demand for court security consultation and technical assistance services has increased dramatically during FY22. The 
number of court security incidents reported to OCA has increased by over 150 percent since the division was established. 
In addition, 949 judges have asked OCA to assist in removing their personal information from public databases. 

•  Due to increased attention on the accuracy and timeliness of reporting of disqualifying offenses to the National Instant 

Criminal Background Check System (NICS), there has been an increased demand for technical assistance and training from 
OCA’s research and court services division. 

 

 

Page 41.  JUDICIARY-WIDE INFLATION RELIEF - $2,815,666 
The staff positions within the Article IV Courts and Agencies require a unique level of skill. From attorneys, to clerks and 
interpreters, to researchers and IT professionals, the expertise needed to keep the third branch of government running is 
vast. Recruiting and retaining qualified staff is challenging, even more so with inflation at 9.1 percent and rising. In FY21, the 
Judiciary had the third highest turnover rate in the state by General Appropriations Act Article at 14.5 percent. Salaries within 
the judiciary are not keeping up with inflation and are not competitive with other agencies or the private sector. Over the 
past year, Article IV Courts and Agencies have noticed a concerning trend of positions remaining open for lengthy periods of 
time and a steep decline in qualified applicants. Some entities have resorted to paying for recruiting tools to get a small pool 
of qualified candidates. Salary compression is also a major issue, where out of necessity, positions are posted at higher 
salaries than what current employees are making. The Article IV Courts and Agencies request a 10 percent salary increase for 
staff to maintain and recruit a strong and experienced judicial workforce. 

.  REPLACE JUDICIAL BRANCH LEGACY SYSTEM – CASE LEVEL DATA - $6,000,000 
This project replaces the legacy system responsible for collecting and analyzing judicial data. The system in production today 
was last upgraded in 2010. The legacy system only collects court data in aggregate, limiting the policy analysis that can be 
done to make our courts more efficient.  The new system will be a vendor-hosted, cloud-based system that will collect case-
level data. Automated Programming Interfaces (APIs) will be used to allow each court to report data in near real-time. 
Additionally, OCA staff will be given a business intelligence platform to manipulate the data to answer policy questions posed 
by the Judicial Council and the Legislature. 

f this project is not funded, the existing system will continue to be run in production. The operating system and database are 
at end of life and several cybersecurity vulnerabilities will remain. OCA staff will upgrade the OS and database, however, 
solving the cybersecurity issues will remain difficult. Additionally, data for use by policy decision makers will remain at the 
aggregate level.

OVERVIEW OF OCA’s FY 2024-2025 LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATIONS REQUEST 
In addition to amounts submitted in OCA’s baseline request, OCA respectfully requests the following exceptional items: 

CA EXCEPTIONAL ITEM FUNDING REQUESTS 

  O

 

Page 5This project replaces the legacy system that provides case management to the appellate courts. Additionally, it also replaces 
the external interfaces to appellate attorneys, trial court clerks, and the public in general that want to review case 
documents at the appellate courts.  The new system will be a vendor-hosted, cloud-based system that will manage appellate 
court cases and provide access to court documents. It will also manage court conferencing for the two high courts as well as 
writs management for the Court of Criminal Appeals. 

f this project is not funded, the appellate courts will continue to use the existing system. OCA programmers will continue to 
fix any issues from the database to programming issues, however, no additional development will be done. The physical 
equipment running these systems will be on an extended warranty from a third-party provider since the equipment will be at 
end of life at the end of the 2024-25 biennium. 

.  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY LICENSING - $4,311,516 
OCA provides direct IT services to the high courts, courts of appeals, and all judicial branch agencies. This includes the 
licensing of Windows, Adobe, cybersecurity tools, Zoom and other various software to ensure that our users operate 
efficiently and are secure. At the same time, as OCA continues to shift operations to the cloud, cloud costs are naturally 
increasing as well. For the trial courts, OCA provided Zoom licenses have been extremely effective. Courts are using Zoom to 
hold virtual hearings when appropriate and loading in dockets to make the litigant experience more streamlined. The 
changes in process have also allowed litigants to avoid traveling to the courthouse and has led to higher appearance rates 
and participation in court proceedings. OCA is requesting that a portion of the annual cost increase be funded.  

he OCA network that provides service to the high courts, courts of appeals, and judicial branch agencies is nearing the 
manufacturer’s end of life. Replacing the equipment greatly improves the agency’s cybersecurity posture with additional 
features that do not exist on the current network. This includes the replacement of switches, routers, WiFi, perimeter 
networking devices and cybersecurity upgrades. 

.  SPECIALTY COURT AND COURT SECURITY STAFFING NEEDS - $657,500 
Court Services is a critical part of OCA. Effective September 2019, as a result of legislation during the 86th Legislative Session, 
the oversight of specialty courts was transferred from the Criminal Justice Division of the Governor’s Office to OCA. A large 
amount of responsibilities came with the oversight, but no FTE resources. Texas courts are required to register their specialty 
court prior to operating by submitting required documentation for official acknowledgement. OCA accepts, reviews, and 
processes all registration documents. As of June 2022, there are currently 247 registered and active specialty courts in the 
state. OCA expects an increase demand for specialty courts especially mental health courts in the near future. OCA, upon 

  I

  T

  5

Page 6request, is required to provide technical assistance to any registered specialty court. OCA is also charged to monitor specialty 
court programs for compliance with best practices which are required to be developed by the Texas Judicial Council, which is 
also staffed by OCA. Additional staff is needed to support specialty courts across the state. Judicial and courthouse security 
received necessary resources from Senate Bill 42 of the 85th Legislative Session with the passage of the Judge Julie Kocurek 
Judicial and Courthouse Security Act of 2017. The Court Security Division of OCA is currently comprised of two FTEs whose 
responsibility includes supporting judicial security for all judicial officers, their spouse and employees of courts. They are also 
responsible for supporting physical security at courthouses across the state. Over time, court personnel have recognized the 
increased needs in this area and make a number of requests for training on personal security best practices, as well as 
suggestions for improving courthouse security. 

 

Page 76.  CHILDRENS COURT NEEDS - $1,111,789 
OCA has a large group of Judges and Court Coordinators that can retire. Due to the length in state government of staff, lump 
sum payments can be very high. Payouts of this size are very costly to the budget and is especially hard for the IV-D Child 
Support program. While the OAG reimburses OCA for 66 percent of IV-D program costs utilizing federal funds, they will not 
reimburse 66 percent of the annual leave. OCA must use its GR funding to cover the full payment; reducing federal leverage 
those lost GR dollars could have brought. During FY20-21, OCA found that 57 percent of the CSC Staff and 20 percent of the 
CPC Court staff were eligible to retire by the end of the FY20-21. OCA was appropriated $300,000 for the 20-21 biennium in a 
rider dedicated solely for these purposes. OCA spent all but $1,728 of the $300,000. The LBB removed funding, as a one-time 
expense in their recommendations for the FY22-23 biennium. During FY24-25, 51 percent of CSC and 18 percent of CPC staff 
are eligible to retire; a liability that exceeds $1 million. OCA seeks restoration of the funding in FY24-25, including the rider 
language that restricts this funding only for the purposes of paying annual leave lump sum payments. In FY22, OCA has 
already spent over $210,000 on retirements. This project covers costs related to the hardware used for the IV-D Child 
Support Courts. Following DIR’s recommended replacement schedule, OCA will replace desktops and laptops that have been 
in use for more than four years. These funds will also be used to replace network printers and monitors as they fail. 
Currently, these services are provided by the Office of Attorney General, creating a conflict of interest in the IV-D courts, with 
one party to the case (OAG) responsible for maintaining the Judge’s and coordinator’s equipment. This project would resolve 
the conflict of interest. The IT division requests an additional FTE for the support desk for taking on 86 more users. The 
Conference of Regional Presiding Judges request a 5 percent increase in addition to the Judiciary-wide inflation rate of 10 
percent for the court coordinators. The court staff employed by the OCA are among the lowest paid in the field. The max 
salary for an OCA court coordinator is $47,365. With this increase, the court coordinators will still be below the max of the 
classification group. Our coordinators are often recruited to the county they live in at a significant increase. The presiding 
judges want to increase their base to retain these valuable court staff. 

.  OPERATION LONE STAR - $1,033,216 
OCA greatly appreciates the baseline appropriation for Operation Lone Star. Since the original budget was requested, 
revisions to the financial needs of providing magistration services have been made to accommodate actual needs. Our 
original request did not include administrative assistants needed to manage the magistration hearings. We have also 
identified the need for administrative assistants for weekend magistrations. We determined the need for a court consultant 
to assist counties with adjudication of cases. The revised budget results in an additional request of $1,003,804 to supplement 
that baseline funding and 4.1 FTEs for the upcoming biennium.

Page 8TEXAS INDIGENT DEFENSE COMMISSION (TIDC) EXCEPTIONAL ITEM REQUESTS 
Pursuant to Section 79.033, Govt. Code, TIDC is submitting an LAR separate and apart from OCA. While the Commission remains 
administratively attached to the Office of Court Administration (OCA) and funding is provided within the OCA appropriation pattern, 
the legislature directed the Commission to submit its LAR separate from OCA. The following are exceptional item requests contained 
in the TIDC LAR: 
 

1.  TIDC - ASSIST RURAL TEXAS COMMUNITIES - $50,000,000 
Assist rural Texas communities with complying with State and Federal Law. TIDC can build rural defender offices in dozens of 
rural Texas communities. Without this funding, TIDC will not be able to assist rural Texas communities combat ineffective 
counsel.  
• Rural Texas is struggling to provide defense guaranteed by the U.S. and Texas Constitutions. 
• Dwindling attorney numbers have left half of rural misdemeanor defendants without an attorney. 
• Rural regional defender offices are an effective solution, attracting attorneys to rural areas. 
• Demand for rural regional defender offices is more than double available TIDC funds. 
• With additional funding, TIDC can build rural defender offices in dozens of rural Texas communities. 

IDER REVISIONS AND ADDITIONS 

Included with this appropriations request are proposed changes to riders to reflect funding requests, as outlined in OCA’s baseline 
and exceptional item appropriations. OCA requested restoration of a rider present in the FY20-21 GAA related to lump sum annual 
leave appropriations for the Childrens’ Courts. 

ACKGROUND CHECKS The Judicial Branch Certification Commission (JBCC) is authorized by Government Code §§ 411.1408, 
411.1386, 411.081, and Estates Code §1104.407 to obtain criminal history information on individuals regulated by the JBCC. The

2.  Allow for six additional TIDC employees 
• Fewer than 20 TIDC staff oversee, fund, and improve indigent defense in all 254 counties. 
• TIDC requests six additional staff to ensure compliance with state and federal law: 

° Two grants specialists 
° Two fiscal monitors 
° Two policy monitors 

• TIDC requires no additional funds to add these six employees. 

Page 9information obtained is destroyed after use for issuance, denial, suspension, revocation, or renewal of a certificate, registration or 
license issued by JBCC. 

CA also has the authority under Government Code §411.1405(b) to obtain criminal history information on an individual who is an 
employee, applicant for employment, contractor, subcontractor, intern or other volunteer who has access to information resources 
or technology, other than a desktop computer or telephone station assigned to the individual. OCA regularly requests this 
information for individuals who will be working with OCA’s technology resources. Information is destroyed after review. 

O NEW PERFORMANCE MEASURES 
OCA has no new performance measures. 

UMMARY 
OCA is committed to administering efficient and effective programs and using those programs to improve the administration of 
justice in the Texas Judiciary to benefit the citizens of Texas. While there are other areas of need for the agency, this request is 
limited to those areas deemed essential to carrying out OCA’s core mission and to serving the courts and needs of Texans. We will 
be happy to discuss any of the items in the appropriations request and will provide any additional information you may need to 
make an informed decision concerning this request.

OCA collects, analyzes and publishes case activity statistics and other judicial data and is the only statewide repository for this information in Texas. OCA assists courts by providing guidance on court security best practices; providing analysis, advice and recommendations on court administration issues; preparing manuals; providing training; obtaining grant funds for projects and programs; and researching and identifying innovative ideas and programs. This strategy also funds the Guardianship Abuse, Fraud, and Exploitation Deterrence Program.  The Program reviews guardianship cases to identify deficiencies by guardians of elderly and incapacitated protected persons; and audits annual accountings to report to the courts any concerns of potential abuse, fraud, or financial exploitation being committed against a person under guardianship.   This strategy funds the Texas Court Remote Interpreter Services program, whereby experienced and licensed Spanish court interpreters provide services in all case types for short, limited or non-evidentiary hearings that typically last 30 minutes or less. This strategy also funds the majority of OCA's administrative support functions, including executive, legal, finance, human resources, and property accounting and operations.EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS  IMPACTING STRATEGY:3.A.

There is over $5 billion under court protection in guardianship cases. The number of elderly individuals and amounts in estates is expected to continue increasing rapidly as the population of Texans over age 65 climbs as projected by the state demographer.  With the funding of two court security personnel to support the over 3,200 judges in the state, the court security division has remained extremely active assisting judges in responding to court security incidents and planning activities. The number of incidents reported to OCA since the creation of the court security division has increased by over 150% from the previous year and the requests for assistance with security issues have been significant. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a major adaptation to the administration of the Texas court system.  In order to facilitate court proceedings during the pandemic, OCA provided judges the ability to stream and host court proceedings via Zoom and YouTube.  Under the Open Courts Provision of the Texas Constitution, all courts maintain public access. Since March 2020 through June 2022, judges held almost 2.5 million remote court hearings with over 8.9 million participants.3.A.

OCA’s centralized server and network administration creates internal economies of scale and security protection for the participating appellate courts and judicial agencies.  In total, OCA Information Services staff provide direct technical support to twenty-three (23) entities (with 988.6 FTEs), as follows:  OCA (304.6), Appellate Courts (558.5), Office of Capital Writs (20.5), State Law Library (12), State Prosecuting Attorney (4), State Commission on Judicial Conduct (14), Regional Public Defender’s Office (55 FTEs), and the Board of Law Examiners (20).  Technology support is also provided to interns and law clerks that rotate through these agencies.This strategy also manages the operations of the statewide electronic filing system including contract management, governance, and standardization.  The system securely delivers approximately 14,000,000 electronic documents to the appellate, district, county and Justice courts. It also provides electronic access to court documents to the general public, provides redaction services for filers, and guidance on filing for self-represented litigants.  This strategy also provides technology support to the citation by publication system and the protective order registry.STRATEGY DESCRIPTION AND JUSTIFICATION:3.A.

The IS staff also provides technology assistance to the 3,000 trial courts and clerks of Texas.  To provide cost effective technology support with minimal staff, it is critical to continue to maintain a standardized, up-to-date technology environment for the entities that are directly supported by the IS division.  External Factors – The Information Services (IS) division continues to monitor the cybersecurity threat landscape in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security, DIR and other state agencies. OCA continues to evolve its cybersecurity program based on industry trends and ongoing threats. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the Information Services division had to quickly adapt to provide more than 60 loaner laptops for employee home use. This was achieved by re-imaging laptops returning to OCA from the FY20-21 capital equipment project. Additionally, several cloud-based services (Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint) were accelerated in their implementation. This created an additional support need for the division with additional machines and new services.  Qualified technologists are in high demand across Austin. Due to this demand and the associated pay difference, it is difficult for OCA to hire and retain qualified FTE IT staff.EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS  IMPACTING STRATEGY:3.A.

OCA currently administers 43 child support dockets throughout the state.  Each docket is staffed by one associate judge and one court coordinator.  The associate judges are assigned to a “host county,” but generally “ride circuit” to cover all areas within their designated “court” boundaries.  Roughly 91.1% of the budget for this strategy is used for salaries and travel costs.STRATEGY DESCRIPTION AND JUSTIFICATION:The CSC program is funded by General Revenue (34%) appropriated directly to OCA and federal funds (66%) that come to OCA through an Interagency Contract with the Office of Attorney General (OAG).Visiting associate judges are used on occasion to cover temporary vacancies that occur because of vacations, illness, or family and medical leave.  The child support dockets must be staffed to meet the needs of citizens and children and to avoid losing federal funds.EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS  IMPACTING STRATEGY:3.A.

In FY2020, these courts held 44,318 hearings.  8,934 children received final orders.  All 30 courts are staffed by a dedicated associate judge and a court coordinator, who travel to the counties served by their court to hear cases.  The judge for the Dallas County Child Protection and Permanency Court does not travel. As compared to counties not served by these courts, OCA child protection courts have better outcomes for children and families.   The courts receive policy guidance from the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions and technical assistance from OCA, including access to an in-house online case management system.

The judges assigned to these dockets hear child abuse and neglect cases exclusively.  Therefore, children can achieve permanency more quickly and the quality of placement decisions should be higher.  These courts plan a key role in determining whether and how long children will remain in foster care, and where they will permanently reside.  The length of time that a child remains in foster care and the appropriateness of the permanent placement depend largely on how efficiently and effectively courts facilitate case review, which is largely a function of the timeliness and appropriateness of judicial decisions.EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS  IMPACTING STRATEGY:STRATEGY BIENNIAL TOTAL - ALL FUNDSBase Spending (Est 2022 + Bud 2023)     Baseline Request (BL 2024 + BL 2025)BIENNIALCHANGE        EXPLANATION OF BIENNIAL CHANGE   $ Amount     Explanation(s) of Amount (must specify MOFs and FTEs)EXPLANATION OF BIENNIAL CHANGE (includes Rider amounts):$13,150,763 $13,150,763 $0 Total of Explanation of Biennial Change $0 3.A.

Established in Section 79.002 of the Government Code and administratively attached to the Office of Court Administration, TIDC oversees, funds, and improves indigent defense throughout the State of Texas. Specifically, the Commission monitors indigent defense in all 254 counties through data collection and in-person audits; funds all 254 counties to help ensure constitutional and statutory compliance; and creates more efficient and effective indigent defense systems through training, publications, presentations, technical assistance, policies, and standards. Despite advancements over the past 20 years, TIDC continues to observe and remedy constitutional and statutory deficiencies across the State.Three factors affect the strategy: (1) underinvestment; (2) revenue loss; and (3) rural attorney shortages. (1) Texas spends half the national average on indigent defense. Texas’s counties bear 87% of the funding burden, which has led to unequal investment and unequal application of the law. While the constitutional right to an attorney applies equally across the State, appointment of counsel varies county-to-county (from 0% to over 90%), often depending on county taxbases. (2) TIDC is funded through the Fair Defense Account (GR-D 5073), primarily through court cost collections. For several biennia, Fair Defense Account deposits have fallen about 2% annually, driven by decreases in misdemeanor cases filed and traffic tickets issued. During Covid, deposits fell more precipitously, leading to a nearly $20 million decline in GR-D inflows. The 87th Legislature appropriated $14 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds to help address this loss. TIDC anticipates additional GR-D losses in the next biennium. Aside from Operation Lone Star, TIDC receives no GR. (3) From 2015 to today, the number of indigent defense attorneys in rural Texas fell 25%.

Effective September 2019, as a result from the 86th legislative session, the oversight of specialty courts was transferred from the Criminal Justice Division of the Governor’s Office to OCA. A large amount of responsibilities came with the oversight, but no FTE resources. Texas courts are required to register their specialty court prior to operating by submitting required documentation for official acknowledgement. OCA accepts, reviews, and processes all registration documents. As of June 2022, there are currently 247 registered and active specialty courts in the state.  OCA expects an increase demand for specialty courts especially mental health courts in the near future. OCA, upon request, is to provide technical assistance to any registered specialty court. OCA is also charged to monitor specialty court programs for compliance with best practices. OCA also identifies an existing staff member who serves as the Statewide Problem-Solving Court Coordinator (SPCC), representing OCA by attending and participating in specialty court-related meetings sponsored by a diverse body of state and federal governmental and non-profit agencies and other stakeholders. Additionally, judicial and courthouse security received necessary resources from Senate Bill 42 of the 85th Legislative Session with the passage of the Judge Julie Kocurek Judicial and Courthouse Security Act of 2017. This division of OCA is currently comprised of two FTEs whose responsibility it is to support judicial security for all judicial officers, their spouse and employees of courts. They are also responsible for support physical security at courthouses across the state.  4.00 4.00FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT POSITIONS (FTE):4.A.

Exceptional Item Request ScheduleOver time, court personnel have recognized the needs in this area and make a number of requests for training on personal security best practices, as well as suggestions for improving courthouse security.EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS:In regard to specialty courts, without funding for these positions, OCA will find it challenging to meet its legislative mandate to register new specialty courts. It will also lack the ability to monitor existing courts compliance with best practices, therefore, having possible negative impacts on defendants participating in the programs. The goal of specialty courts is to provide individualized treatment options and interventions, and in many cases, help prevent defendant’s from being incarcerated and limit reoffending.  Without funding, there will likely be a decrease in quality assurance, training, research and evaluation and advocacy goals. For judicial and court security, two FTEs do not provide enough time nor resources to adequately serve all judicial officers and courthouses in the state. Judicial and courthouse security continues to be at risk across in Texas and across the county. The lives of judicial officers are being targeted, along with their families. Texas needs to have more dedicated resources to help improve privacy protections, physical protections and training for those in courthouses. Courts as public institutions are also becoming targets for lethal threats, and emergency preparedness assistance will continue to help all individuals in these buildings.PCLS TRACKING KEY:Continued salary for four FTEs for Specialty Court staff and Court Security staffDESCRIPTION OF ANTICIPATED OUT-YEAR COSTS :$324,760 $324,760  2027 2026ESTIMATED ANTICIPATED OUT-YEAR COSTS FOR ITEM:$335,620  20284.A.

OCA has a large group of Judges and Court Coordinators that can retire.  Due to the length in state government of the staff, lump sum payments can be very high.  Payouts of this size are very costly to the budget and is especially hard for the IV-D Child Support program.  While the OAG reimburses OCA for 66% of IV-D program costs utilizing federal funds, they will not reimburse 66% of the annual leave.  OCA must use its GR funding to cover the full payment; reducing federal leverage those lost GR dollars could have brought. During 20-21, OCA was appropriated $300,000 for the 20-21 biennium in a rider dedicated solely for these purposes.  OCA spent all but $1,728 of the $300,000.  The LBB removed funding, as a one-time expense in their recommendations for the 22-23 biennium.  During the 24-25 51% of CSC and 18% of CPC staff are eligible to retire; the liability exceeds $1 million.  OCA seeks restoration of the funding in 24-25, including the rider language that restricts this funding only for lump sum payments.  In 22, OCA has already spent over $200,000 on retirements. $300,000 2. This project covers costs for hardware used by the IV-D Child Support Courts. Currently, these services are provided by the Office of Attorney General, creating a conflict of interest in the IV-D courts, with one party to the case (OAG) responsible for maintaining the Judge’s and coordinator’s equipment. This project would resolve the conflict of interest. The IT division requests an extra FTE for the support desk for taking on 86 more users. $460,551 3. The Presiding Judges request a total 5% increase in addition to the Judiciary-wide inflation rate of 10% for the court coordinators.  The court staff employed by the OCA are among the lowest paid in the field.  The max salary for an OCA court coordinator is $47,365.  Our coordinators are often recruited to the county they live in at a significant increase. The presiding judges want to increase their base to retain these staff.  $351,236 1.00 1.00FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT POSITIONS (FTE):4.A.

Exceptional Item Request ScheduleEXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS:If funding is not provided for lump sum annual leave payments, OCA may have to leave Associate Judge positions unfilled when they become vacant in order to accrue enough salary surplus to cover the cost of the lump sum payment.  This will negatively impact the services the child support and child protection courts provide to children and their families.  Vacated positions are typically filled immediately for continuity of services, eliminating the option to accrue salary savings.  In court coordinator positions, the judges often request two weeks overlap for training, further hindering the opportunity to accrue salary savings. Having OCA employees computer equipment and support provided by another state agency is a conflict and hinders the agency IT staff from providing technical support to access VPN networks managed by OCA. The agency risks losing our court coordinators to counties that have the available funding to pay those positions higher wages.PCLS TRACKING KEY:N/ADESCRIPTION OF IT COMPONENT INCLUDED IN EXCEPTIONAL ITEM:Computer Equipment, two monitors, a printer, associated licenses.IS THIS IT COMPONENT RELATED TO A NEW OR CURRENT PROJECT?CURRENTThis request is for funds to be added to the current Capital Project for Acquisition of Computer Hardware and SoftwareSTATUS:N/AOUTCOMES:OUTPUTS:N/AAcquisition and Refresh of Hardware and SoftwareTYPE OF PROJECTThe Office of the Attorney General would continue purchasing computers and providing technical support to OCA's IV-D employees.ALTERNATIVE ANALYSISESTIMATED IT COST$0 $0 $261,000 $87,901 $87,901 $87,901 $785,703 Total Over Life of Project 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028$261,000 4.A.

Capital Budget Project InformationAgency name:Agency Code:Category Number:Project number:212 9500 2Category Name:Project Name:Office of Court Administration, Texas Judicial CouncilLegacy ModernizationReplace Legacy System - TAMESThe Appellate Case Management System project will replace the legacy system that provides case management to the appellate courts of Texas. Additionally, it will also replace external interfaces to systems that service the appellate attorneys, trial court clerks, and the public in general that want to review case documents at the appellate courts.The new system will be a vendor-hosted, cloud-based, system that manages appellate court cases, provides access to court documents and manages court conferencing for the two high courts as well as writs management for the Court of Criminal Appeals.General InformationPROJECT DESCRIPTIONNumber of Units / Average Unit Cost$10,492,000 for development; ongoing $1,450,000/year.Estimated Completion Date2025PLCS Tracking KeyPCLS_88R_212_1106485 1,450,000 1,450,000Additional Capital Expenditure Amounts Required20262027Type of FinancingCURRENT APPROPRIATIONSCAProjected Useful Life10-15 yearsEstimated/Actual Project Cost$10,492,000Length of Financing/ Lease PeriodOngoingESTIMATED/ACTUAL DEBT OBLIGATION PAYMENTS 0 0 0 0Total over project life 02024202520262027REVENUE GENERATION / COST SAVINGSAVERAGE_AMOUNTMOF_CODEREVENUE_COST_FLAGExplanation: The current, legacy system was developed in-house over 14 years ago, in 2008. It was deployed to all courts of appeals in 2011 and 2012. The system’s architecture is physically and logically decentralized and managed and maintained at disparate locations. The outdated architecture is burdensome and increasingly difficult to secure and maintain. The customized software and underlying hardware require maintenance and support that is increasingly difficult to acquire.Project Location: Public/Government CloudBeneficiaries: CourtsFrequency of Use and External Factors Affecting Use:Over the past decade, commercial case management software has begun to catch up with functionality needed by the appellate courts. Many solutions are cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) case management systems. Moving from a locally installed and managed system to a SaaS environment will eliminate OCA’s need to struggle with finding skilled labor to maintain a high-risk legacy system and will centralize maintenance and support into a commercially provided secure service.5.B.

The system in production today was last upgraded in 2010. The legacy system only collects court data in aggregate, limiting the policy analysis that can be done to make our courts more efficient. The new system will be a vendor-hosted, cloud-based system that will collect case-level data. Automated Programing Interfaces (APIs) will be used to allow each court to report data in near real-time. Additionally, OCA staff will be given a business intelligence platform to manipulate the data to answer policy questions posed by the Judicial Council and the Legislature.General InformationPROJECT DESCRIPTIONNumber of Units / Average Unit CostN/AEstimated Completion Date8/31/2026PLCS Tracking KeyPCLS_88R_212_1106431 2,000,000 2,000,000Additional Capital Expenditure Amounts Required20262027Type of FinancingCURRENT APPROPRIATIONSCAProjected Useful Life10-15 yearsEstimated/Actual Project Cost$4,000,000Length of Financing/ Lease PeriodN/AESTIMATED/ACTUAL DEBT OBLIGATION PAYMENTS 0 0 0 0Total over project life 02024202520262027REVENUE GENERATION / COST SAVINGSAVERAGE_AMOUNTMOF_CODEREVENUE_COST_FLAGExplanation: The Texas Judicial Council is charged with ensuring the courts of Texas operate in an efficient manner. The current system does not provide the depth of data needed to gauge the efficiency improvements made by the judicial council. With each court having the ability to choose their own local case management system, the new system will need to have automated programming interfaces to allow for data to be added and modified from any court case management system.Project Location: Public/Government CloudBeneficiaries: Texas Judicial Council, Legislature, general public, courts.Frequency of Use and External Factors Affecting Use:The current court statistical system in place was originally built in 2003 and upgraded in 2010 to then current technology. The system only allows for aggregate data to be collected and reported, limiting the visibility of policy makers. The system also appears in almost all cyber security reports for the agency, needing constant security attention and is desperate need to be replaced.5.B.

OCA does not have any strategies or programs related to these categories.Applicability:FY20 OCA did not meet the statewide or internal HUB goal for Other Services or Commodities. For Other Services, included in the total of non-HUB expenditures is approximately $169,600 in expenses pertaining to our visiting judges and workshop participants, which are unable to be sourced to a HUB vendor. Over $1,049,300 in expenditures for DIR cooperative contracts do not always have a HUB seller available. If these were excluded, our performance would be 54%. For Commodities, over $1,304,280 in payments for DIR cooperative contracts do not always have a HUB seller available. If these expenditures were excluded, our performance would be over 57%. FY21 OCA did not meet the statewide or internal HUB goal for Other Services. For this category, approximately $171,535 in expenses related to our visiting judges and workshop participants are unable to be sourced to a HUB vendor, and $2,047,430 in expenditures for DIR cooperative contracts do not always have a HUB seller available.  If these expenditures were excluded, our performance would be over 8.5%. For Commodities, we exceeded the statewide and our internal HUB goal.Factors Affecting Attainment:OCA has no current Mentor Protégé program participants at this time.

Specialty Court Monitoring

Legal Authority for Item:
HB 2955, 86th R.S.

Description/Key Assumptions (including start up/implementation costs and ongoing costs):
Effective September 2019, as a result of the 86th legislative session, the oversight of specialty courts was transferred from the Criminal Justice Division of the Governor' s Office to the OCA.  
A large number of responsibilities came with the oversight, but no FTE resources.  Texas courts are required to register their specialty court prior to operating by submitting required 
documentation for official acknowledgment.  OCA accepts, reviews, and processes all registration documents.  As of June 2022, there are currently 247 registered and active specialty courts 
in the state.  OCA expects an increase in demand for specialty courts, especially mental health courts in the near future.  OCA, upon request, is to provide technical assistance to any 
registered specialty court.  OCA is also charged to monitor specialty court programs for compliance with best practices.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
