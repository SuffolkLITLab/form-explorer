9.2.   Response to Motion for Rehearing

49.6.   Amendments 
 

A  motion  for  rehearing  or  en  banc  reconsideration  may  be  amended  as  a 
matter  of  right  anytime  before  the  15-day  period  allowed  for  filing  the  motion 
expires, and with leave of the court, anytime before the court of appeals decides the 
motion. 

9.75.  En Banc Reconsideration 

A party may file a motion for en banc reconsideration as a separate motion, 
with  or  without  filing  a  motion  for  rehearing.  The  motion  must  be  filed  within  15 
days  after  the  court  of  appeals’  judgment  or  order,  or  when  permitted,  within  15 
days  after  the  court  of  appeals’  denial  of  the  party's  last  timely  filed  motion  for 
rehearing  or  en  banc  reconsiderationthe  time  prescribed  by  Rule  49.1  for  filing  a 
motion  for  rehearing.  The  motion  should  address  the  standard  for  en  banc 
consideration  in  Rule  41.2(c).  No  response  to  a  motion  for  en  banc  reconsideration 
need  be  filed  unless  the  court  so  requests.  While  the  court  has  plenary  power,  a 
majority  of  the  en  banc  court  may,  with  or  without  a  motionon  its  own  initiative, 
order  en  banc  reconsideration  of  a  panel’s  decision.  If  a  majority  orders 
reconsideration, the panel’s judgment or order does not become final, and the case 
will be resubmitted to the court for en banc review and disposition. The court may 
dispose of the case with or without rebriefing and oral argument. 

9.6.   Further Motion for En Banc Reconsideration 

After a  court decides a motion for en banc reconsideration, a further motion 
for en banc reconsideration may be filed within 15 days of the court’s action if the 
court: 

(a)  modifies its judgment; 

(b) 

vacates its judgment and renders a new judgment; or 

(c) 

issues a different opinion.

49.7.   Accelerated Appeals 

In  an  accelerated  appeal,  the  appellate  court  may  deny  the  right  to  file  a 
motion  for  rehearing  or  en  banc  reconsideration  or  shorten  the  time  to  file  such  a 
motion.  

9.8.   Amendments 

A  motion  for  rehearing  or  en  banc  reconsideration  may  be  amended  as  a 
matter  of  right  anytime  before  the  15-day  period  allowed  for  filing  the  motion 
expires, and with leave of the court, anytime before the court of appeals decides the 
motion. 

9.89.  Extension of Time 

A court of appeals may extend the time for filing a motion for rehearing or en 
banc reconsideration if a party files a motion complying with Rule 10.5(b) no later 
than 15 days after the last date for filing the motion. 

9.910. Not Required for Review 

A motion for rehearing or for en banc reconsideration is not a prerequisite to 
filing  a  petition  for  review  in  the  Supreme  Court  or  a  petition  for  discretionary 
review in the Court of Criminal Appeals nor is it required to preserve error. 

9.10.  

Deleted 

9.11.  

Relationship to Petition for Review 

A party may not file a motion for rehearing or en banc reconsideration in the 
court  of  appeals  after  that  party  has  filed  a  petition  for  review  in  the  Supreme 
Court unless the court of appeals modifies its opinion or judgment after the petition 
for review is filed. The filing of a petition for review does not preclude another party 
from filing a motion for rehearing or en banc reconsideration or preclude the court 
of  appeals  from  ruling  on  the  motion.  If  a  motion  for  rehearing  or  en  banc 
reconsideration is timely filed after a petition for review is filed, the petitioner must 
immediately  notify  the  Supreme  Court  clerk  of  the  filing  of  the  motion,  and  must 
notify  the  clerk  when  the  last  timely  filed  motion  is  overruled  by  the  court  of 
appeals.

banc reconsideration of a panel’s decision. 
 
Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: This is former Rule 100. Subdivision 49.4 is moved 

here from former Rule 43(h). Subdivisions 49.9 and 49.10 are added. 
 

Comment  to  2008  change:  Rule  49  is  revised  to  treat  a  motion  for  en  banc 
reconsideration  as  having  the  effect  of  a  motion  for  rehearing  and  to  include 
procedures governing the filing of a motion for en banc reconsideration. Subdivision 
49.5(c) is amended to clarify that a further motion for rehearing may be filed if the 
court  issues  a  different  opinion,  irrespective  of  whether  the  opinion  is  issued  in 
connection  with  the  overruling  of  a  prior  motion  for  rehearing.  Issuance  of  a  new 
opinion that is not substantially different should not occasion a further motion for 
rehearing,  but  a  motion's  lack  of  merit  does  not  affect  appellate  deadlines.  The 
provisions  of  former  Rule  53.7(b)  that  address  motions  for  rehearing  are  moved  to 
new  subdivision  49.11  without  change,  leaving  the  provisions  of  Rule  53.7(b)  that 
address petitions for review undisturbed.   Subdivision 49.12 mirrors Rule 10.1(a)(5) 
in excepting motions for rehearing and motions for en banc reconsideration from the 
certificate-of-conference requirement. 

Comment to 2021 change: Rule 49 is revised to clarify when a motion for en 
banc  reconsideration  may  be  filed.  A  motion  for  en  banc  reconsideration  must  be 
filed  by  the  deadline  for  filing  an  initial  motion  for  rehearing  under  subdivision 
49.1.  Some  subdivisions  have  been  rearranged.  Amended  subdivision  49.5  adds  a 
cross-reference to the standard for en banc consideration in Rule 41.2(c).

Petitions  Filed  by  Other  Parties.  If  a  party  files  a  petition  for  review  within 
the time  specified in 53.7(a) — or within the time specified by the Supreme 
Court in an order granting an extension of time to file a petition — any other 
party required to file a petition may do so within 45 days after the last timely 
motion  for  rehearing  or  en  banc  reconsideration  is  overruled  or  within  30 
days after any preceding petition is filed, whichever date is later.

considered or reconsidered en banc need not be taken unless a justice of the 
court  requests  a  vote.  If  a  vote  is  requested  and  a  majority  of  the  court’s 
members  vote  to  consider  or  reconsider  the  case  en  banc,  the  en  banc  court 
will  consider  or  reconsider  the  case.  Otherwise,  a  panel  of  the  court  will 
consider the case.

Rule 49. Motion for Rehearing and En Banc Reconsideration 

9.1.  Motion for Rehearing 

A motion for rehearing may be filed within 15 days after the court of appeals’ 
judgment or order is rendered. The motion must clearly state the issues relied on for 
the rehearing. 

9.2.   Response to Motion for Rehearing 

No  response  to  a  motion  for  rehearing  need  be  filed  unless  the  court  so 
requests.  The  motion  will  not  be  granted  unless  a  response  has  been  filed  or 
requested by the court. 

9.3.   Decision on Motion for Rehearing 

A  motion  for  rehearing  may  be  granted  by  a  majority  of  the  justices  who 
participated in the decision of the case. Unless two justices who participated in the 
decision  of  the  case  agree  on  the  disposition  of  the  motion  for  rehearing,  the  chief 
justice  of  the  court  of  appeals  must  assign  a  justice  to  replace  any  justice  who 
participated in the panel decision but cannot participate in deciding the motion for 
rehearing. If rehearing is granted, the court may dispose of the case with or without 
rebriefing and oral argument. 

9.4.  Further Motion for Rehearing 

After  a  court  decides  a  motion  for  rehearing,  a  further  motion  for  rehearing 

may be filed within 15 days of the court’s action if the court: 
 

(a)  modifies its judgment; 

(b) 

vacates its judgment and renders a new judgment; or

(c) 

issues a different opinion. 

49.5.  En Banc Reconsideration 
 

A party may file a motion for en banc reconsideration as a separate motion, 
with or without filing a motion for rehearing. The motion must be filed within the 

Misc. Docket No. 21-9110 

Page 16 

time  prescribed  by  Rule  49.1  for  filing  a  motion  for  rehearing.  The  motion  should 
address  the  standard  for  en  banc  consideration  in  Rule  41.2(c).  No  response  to  a 
motion for en banc reconsideration need be filed unless the court so requests. While 
the  court  has  plenary  power,  a  majority  of  the  en  banc  court  may,  on  its  own 
initiative,  order  en  banc  reconsideration  of  a  decision.  If  a  majority  orders 
reconsideration,  the judgment  or  order  does  not  become  final,  and  the  case  will  be 
resubmitted to the court for en banc review and disposition. The court may dispose 
of the case with or without rebriefing and oral argument. 

9.6.   Further Motion for En Banc Reconsideration 

After a court decides a motion for en banc reconsideration, a further motion 
for en banc reconsideration may be filed within 15 days of the court’s action if the 
court: 

(a)  modifies its judgment; 

(b) 

vacates its judgment and renders a new judgment; or 

(c) 

issues a different opinion. 

9.7.   Accelerated Appeals 

In  an  accelerated  appeal,  the  appellate  court  may  deny  the  right  to  file  a 
motion  for  rehearing  or  en  banc  reconsideration  or  shorten  the  time  to  file  such  a 
motion.  

9.8.   Amendments 

A  motion  for  rehearing  or  en  banc  reconsideration  may  be  amended  as  a 
matter  of  right  anytime  before  the  15-day  period  allowed  for  filing  the  motion 
expires, and with leave of the court, anytime before the court of appeals decides the 
motion. 

9.9.  Extension of Time 

A court of appeals may extend the time for filing a motion for rehearing or en 
banc reconsideration if a party files a motion complying with Rule 10.5(b) no later 
than 15 days after the last date for filing the motion.

49.10. Not Required for Review 
 

A motion for rehearing or for en banc reconsideration is not a prerequisite to 
filing  a  petition  for  review  in  the  Supreme  Court  or  a  petition  for  discretionary 
review in the Court of Criminal Appeals nor is it required to preserve error. 

 

49.11. Relationship to Petition for Review 
 

A party may not file a motion for rehearing or en banc reconsideration in the 
court  of  appeals  after  that  party  has  filed  a  petition  for  review  in  the  Supreme 
Court unless the court of appeals modifies its opinion or judgment after the petition 
for review is filed. The filing of a petition for review does not preclude another party 
from filing a motion for rehearing or en banc reconsideration or preclude the court 
of  appeals  from  ruling  on  the  motion.  If  a  motion  for  rehearing  or  en  banc 
reconsideration is timely filed after a petition for review is filed, the petitioner must 
immediately  notify  the  Supreme  Court  clerk  of  the  filing  of  the  motion,  and  must 
notify  the  clerk  when  the  last  timely  filed  motion  is  overruled  by  the  court  of 
appeals. 

9.12. Certificate of Conference Not Required 

A  certificate  of  conference  is  not  required  for  a  motion  for  rehearing  or  en 

banc reconsideration. 

 
Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: This is former Rule 100. Subdivision 49.4 is moved 

here from former Rule 43(h). Subdivisions 49.9 and 49.10 are added. 
 

Comment  to  2008  change:  Rule  49  is  revised  to  treat  a  motion  for  en  banc 
reconsideration  as  having  the  effect  of  a  motion  for  rehearing  and  to  include 
procedures governing the filing of a motion for en banc reconsideration. Subdivision 
49.5(c) is amended to clarify that a further motion for rehearing may be filed if the 
court  issues  a  different  opinion,  irrespective  of  whether  the  opinion  is  issued  in 
connection  with  the  overruling  of  a  prior  motion  for  rehearing.  Issuance  of  a  new 
opinion that is not substantially different should not occasion a further motion for 
rehearing,  but  a  motion's  lack  of  merit  does  not  affect  appellate  deadlines.  The 
provisions  of  former  Rule  53.7(b)  that  address  motions  for  rehearing  are  moved  to 
new  subdivision  49.11  without  change,  leaving  the  provisions  of  Rule  53.7(b)  that 

  4

 

 

Misc. Docket No. 21-9110 

Page 18 

address petitions for review undisturbed.   Subdivision 49.12 mirrors Rule 10.1(a)(5) 
in excepting motions for rehearing and motions for en banc reconsideration from the 
certificate-of-conference requirement. 

Comment to 2021 change: Rule 49 is revised to clarify when a motion for en 
banc  reconsideration  may  be  filed.  A  motion  for  en  banc  reconsideration  must  be 
filed  by  the  deadline  for  filing  an  initial  motion  for  rehearing  under  subdivision 
49.1.  Some  subdivisions  have  been  rearranged.  Amended  subdivision  49.5  adds  a 
cross-reference to the standard for en banc consideration in Rule 41.2(c).

Rule 53. Petition for Review 

3.7.   Time and Place of Filing 

Petitions  Filed  by  Other  Parties.  If  a  party  files  a  petition  for  review  within 
the  time  specified  in  53.7(a)  —  or  within  the  time  specified  by  the  Supreme 
Court in an order granting an extension of time to file a petition — any other 
party required to file a petition may do so within 45 days after the last timely 
motion  for  rehearing  or  en  banc  reconsideration  is  overruled  or  within  30 
days after any preceding petition is filed, whichever date is later.
