In 2004,  the Appellate Section of the State Bar of Texas and the Courts of Appeals  worked together to identify key information needed by appellate 

attorneys and pro se litigants to practice effectively before the court. To assist the court in this effort, the Appellate Section collected and formatted the relevant 
information and published it in the Appellate Advocate in February 2005.  This information was updated in February 2023 and the court intends to keep the 
information current for the use of persons with matters before the court.

matrix. The Chief Justice always 
presides  over  A  Panel  or  any 
other  panel  on  which  the  Chief 
Justice  is  assigned.  The  most 
senior justice selected for each of 
the other panels will preside over 
that  panel.  A  random  draw 
several weeks before submission 
determines  initial  authorship  of 
each case.  
The Court grants 15 minutes per 
side,  and  appellant  may  reserve 
time  for  rebuttal.  Requests  to 
modify  the  time  permitted  for 
argument should be made before 
the  day  of  argument.  Parties  are 
notified  of  the  justices  on  the 
panel  when  a  submission  notice 
letter  is  mailed  about  30  days 
before argument.  

Oral argument exhibits may be 
filed  electronically  before  the 
day  of  argument.    There  is  a 
charge of $25 per exhibit. 

The Court grants oral argument 
under the guidelines of Tex. R. 
App. P. 39.  If the Court grants 
oral  argument,  both  sides 
generally  will  be  given  an 
opportunity  to  argue  even  if 
one  side  did  not  request  oral 
argument in their brief(s). 

Oral Argument  A request for oral argument must be 
noted  on  the  front  cover  of  the 
party’s brief (somewhere other than 
the  top  right  corner).  A  party 
requesting argument is encouraged 
to include a statement of reasons in 
the  body  of  the  brief  addressing 
why argument should be permitted.  
See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(e), 39.7. If 
the case is part of the SBOT/HBA 
pro bono program, that fact should 
be  included  in  the  statement.    A 
party’s  failure 
to  request  oral 
argument on the front cover waives 
the right to argue. If the request is 
inadvertently omitted, it is proper to 
file  a  motion  requesting  argument 
promptly  after  discovering 
the 
omission.  Late  requests  are  not 
favored.

COURT’S PARTICULAR 
PRACTICES 

The Justices of the 14th Court 
of  Appeals  strive  to  limit  the 
use of visiting justices in their 
court. In the event that a justice 
may need help for an extended 
period of time, the justice, with 
the  approval  of  a  majority  of 
the  justices,  may  request  a 
visiting  justice  in  one  of  two 
ways. The justice can either ask 
the chief justice of the supreme 
court  for  a  particular  judge  or 
justice  to  be  assigned  to  the 
court  or  can  ask  the  chief 
justice of the supreme court to 
justice, 
a  visiting 
assign 
without a recommendation.  

1.  The Court uses Westlaw primarily.  The Court does not have access to Lexis. The Court has Supreme Court Reporters, but not U.S 

Reporters. Providing citations to the Supreme Court Reporter is helpful. 

2.  The Court no longer accepts any filings filed by fax. For a motion that needs immediate consideration, parties should file motions 

through eFileTexas.gov, the portal established by the Texas Legislature. 

3.  The Court has access to the Harris County Law Library, but appreciates it if the parties provide copies of authorities not available 

on Westlaw.  

4.  The Court distributes its orders and opinions electronically on its website. 
5.  The Court records oral arguments.

Appellate Mediation 

.  The Court has a process for appellate mediation.  
2. 

Parties are ordered to mediation if the Court determines the case is appropriate for mediation or the parties agree. If mediation is 
ordered, the appeal is abated for 60 days, or longer if an extension is granted. Parties are entitled to object to a mediation order within 
10 days of the date of the order.  The Parties must agree on the selection of a mediator. The Court does not appoint a mediator or 
track mediation fees.  

3.  When a civil appeal is filed, the parties are notified that the appellant should complete and file a docketing statement, which includes 
a mediation section, and appellee should complete and file a one-page mediation docketing statement, both within 15 days of the 
date the case is docketed. A failure to comply may be deemed as an affirmative response to mediation by the non-filing party.

building. After hours filing is available through electronic filing. A party represented by an attorney must e-file any document filed 
with the Court, except a document under seal or subject to a motion to seal. Documents e-filed with the Fourteenth Court of Appeals

The Court occasionally utilizes the services of visiting judges. 
In transfer cases in which the Court decides to hear oral argument, the Court gives the parties the option to hold argument in person 
in Houston or to allow the parties to appear through the use of teleconferencing technology in the city of the transferor court as 
provided by Section 73.003 of the Texas Government Code.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
