Introduction

People with mental illness, intellectual disabilities, and developmental disabilities are greatly overrepresented in 
the criminal justice system compared to their prevalence in the general population.1 These individuals often cycle 
in and out of our justice system with little, if any, treatment. These Texans and the communities in which they live 
must navigate the challenges of mental health issues in jails, hospital emergency departments, adult criminal and 
juvenile justice agencies, schools, and child protective services. 

The  challenges  are  as  big  as  Texas  itself.  Of  the  27  million  people  who  live  in  Texas,  approximately  1  million 
adults experience serious mental illness; roughly half of these adults have serious and persistent mental illnesses 
including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.2 Approximately 
500,000 children aged 17 or younger have severe emotional disturbance.3 An estimated 1.6 million adult Texans 
and 181,000 children aged 12 to 17 have substance use disorders, which frequently accompany mental illness and 
further complicate management of mental health issues in the justice systems.4  Nearly 25 percent of the inmate 
population in Texas has a mental health need; adults with untreated mental health conditions are eight times 
more likely to be incarcerated than the general population.5

These issues are most acutely felt at the local level. In Houston, approximately 2,200 inmates received psychotropic 
medications and mental health services at the Harris County jail in 2013 at a cost of $26 million.6 Total jail costs 
related to  mental  illness  in  Harris  County  in  2013 were estimated at  more than  $49  million.  In  Dallas  County 
in  2013,  these  costs  were  more  than  $47  million.7  Rural  counties  face  a  host  of  unique  challenges  including 
limited  personnel  and  infrastructure  for  addressing  mental  health  needs;  lack  of  community-based  mental 
health  expertise  and  resources;  and  long  travel  distances  for  defendants  to  access  supervision  and  treatment 
appointments, as well as to attend court.

People with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) also face significant barriers in our criminal justice 
system. Texas is home to more than 485,000 adults and children with IDD.8 People with IDD include individuals 
with autism, cerebral palsy,  fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, and  many other disabilities  that affect a person’s 
intellectual ability or daily living. According to reports by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, less than four percent of 
the U.S. population has IDD, yet up to 10 percent of the prison and jail population have been identified as having 
such disabilities.9 Individuals with IDD are more likely than their non-disabled peers to be arrested, convicted, 
incarcerated, and serve longer sentences.10 People with IDD are more likely to be persuaded to confess; more likely 
to be refused bail, probation, or parole; and are more frequently exploited and abused when incarcerated.11

The  judiciary  is one stakeholder  in a  highly  fragmented system  intended to  meet the  needs and  facilitate the 
recovery  of  those  experiencing  or  affected  by  mental  health  and  IDD  issues.  Judges  are  well  positioned  to 
convene stakeholders and help communities address these challenges. In some localities, there has been effective 
collaboration among judges, mental health and IDD authorities, and law enforcement to reduce fragmentation 
and create innovative programs. The following discussion recognizes that no one-size-fits-all approach works in 
a state as big as Texas because resources, availability of treatment options, and local practices vary widely. This 
Bench Book provides immediate information to help address mental health and IDD issues as they arise in your 
courtroom and community.

Even with variations in resources, options, and local practices, the statutes discussed in this Bench Book provide 
a baseline for procedures aimed at identifying and addressing the needs of persons with mental health challenges 
or IDD.

Definitions

Adaptive Behavior:
Adaptive  behavior  means  the effectiveness with or degree  to which a person  meets  the standards of personal 
independence and social responsibility expected of the person’s age and cultural group. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 
46B.001(1); Tex. Health and Safety Code § 591.003(1).

Admission:
Admission means the formal acceptance of a prospective patient to a facility. Tex. Health & Safety Code  
§ 572.0025(h)(1).

Assessment:
Assessment means the administrative process a facility uses to gather information from a prospective patient, 
including a medical history and the problem for which the patient is seeking treatment, to determine whether 
a  prospective  patient  should  be  examined  by  a  physician  to  determine  if  admission  is  clinically  justified.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.0025(h)(2). Note that the term “assessment” is generally no longer used to refer 
to the interview and written report required by article 16.22 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.

Capacity:
Capacity means a patient’s ability to understand the nature and consequences of a proposed treatment, including 
the benefits, risks, and alternatives to the proposed treatment, and to make a decision whether to undergo the 
proposed treatment. Tex. Health and Safety Code § 574.101(1).

Competency Restoration:
Competency  Restoration  means  the  treatment  or  education  process  for  restoring  a  person’s  ability  to  consult 
with the person’s attorney with a reasonable degree of rational understanding, including a rational and factual 
understanding of the court proceedings and charges against the person. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.001(3).

Developmental Disability (DD):
Manifests before age of 22; severe chronic disability that involves impairments of general mental abilities resulting 
in at least three out of six of the following functional limitations:

•  understanding & use of receptive and expressive language;

• 

self-care;

• 

learning;

•  mobility;

• 

self-direction; and/or

•  capacity for independent living, including economic self-sufficiency.

Examples of such disabilities include autism-spectrum disorder, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, and cerebral palsy.

Developmental Period:
This is the period of a person’s life from birth through 17 years of age. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.001(4).

Electronic Broadcast System:
A two-way electronic communication of image and sound  between the defendant and the court and  includes 
secure Internet videoconferencing. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.001(5).

5

Emergency Medical Services Personnel (EMS):
EMS refers to any of the following:

•  emergency care attendant;

•  emergency medical technicians;

•  advanced emergency medical technicians;

•  emergency medical technicians—paramedic; or

• 

licensed paramedic.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 773.003(10).

Home and Community-Based Services (HCS) Program:
HCS is a Medicaid waiver program approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) pursuant to 
section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act. 42 U.S.C. 1396n. It provides community-based services and support to 
eligible individuals as an alternative to an intermediate care facility for individuals with an intellectual disability 
or related conditions program. The HCS Program is operated by the authority of the Health and Human Services 
Commission (HHSC). 40 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 9.153(36), 9.154(a).

Home and Community-based Services Adult Mental Health (HCBS-AMH):
A state plan amendment operated  by  HHSC  Behavioral  Health  Services,  not to  be confused with  HCS waiver 
programming for the IDD population. This service is for persons who meet eligibility criteria for the program. 
The purpose of this program is to provide home and community-based services to adults with extended tenure in 
psychiatric hospitals (or persons at high risk for recurring inpatient hospitalizations) in lieu of them remaining 
as long-term residents in those facilities. This program also serves to divert individuals from emergency rooms 
as  well  as  to  divert  them  from  jails  into  more  appropriate,  community-based  care.  The  HCBS-AMH  program 
provides an array of services, appropriate to each individual’s needs, to enable individuals to live and experience 
successful tenure in his or her community.

Inpatient Mental Health Facility:
Refers to a mental health facility that can provide 24-hour residential and psychiatric services and that is:

•  a facility operated by the Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC);

•  a private mental hospital licensed by HHSC; 

•  a community center, facility operated by or under contract with a community center or other entity HHSC 

designates to provide mental health services;

•  a  local  mental  health authority or a  facility operated  by or  under contract with a  local  mental  health 

authority;

•  an identifiable part of a general hospital in which diagnosis, treatment, and care for persons with mental 

illness is provided and that is licensed by the department; or

•  a hospital operated by a federal agency. 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 571.003(9).

Intake:
Intake  means  the  administrative  process  for  gathering  information  about  a  prospective  patient  and  giving  a 
prospective patient information about the facility and the facility’s treatment and services. Tex. Health & Safety 
Code § 572.0025(h)(3).

Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD):
IDD is a broader category than ID: it includes people with ID, DD, or both. DD are often lifelong disabilities that 
can be cognitive, physical, or both. Some Texas statutes on early identification, screening, and assessment still 
do not currently address developmental disabilities, but developmental disabilities are important to consider as 
they often co-occur with mental illness and ID. Further, people with IDD are more likely than their peers without 
disabilities to be involved in the justice system, both as victims and suspects.12

Intellectual Disability (ID):
ID  means significantly subaverage general  intellectual functioning that  is concurrent with deficits  in adaptive 
behavior and originates during the developmental period. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.001(8); Tex. Health & 
Safety Code § 591.003. 

Intellectual Disability Services:
Intellectual  disability  services  includes  all  services  concerned  with  research,  prevention,  and  detection  of 
intellectual  disabilities,  and  all  services  related  to  the  education,  training,  habilitation,  care,  treatment,  and 
supervision of persons with an intellectual disability, but does not include the education of school-age persons 
that the public education system is authorized to provide. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 531.002(10).

Local Intellectual and Developmental Disability Authority (LIDDA):
LIDDAs are units of government that provide services to a specific geographic area of the state, called the local 
service area.  LIDDAs serve as the point of entry  for publicly  funded  intellectual and developmental disability 
programs, whether the program is provided by a public or private entity. LIDDA responsibilities are delineated in 
section 533.035 of the Texas Health and Safety Code. See Tex. Health & Safety Code § 531.002.

Local Mental Health Authority (LMHA or LMHA/LBHA):
LMHAs—also referred  to as community centers, community  mental  health centers, or  MHMRs—are units of 
local  government  that  provide  services  to  a  specific  geographic  area  of  the  state  called  the  local  service  area. 
HHSC  contracts  with  the  39  LMHAs/LBHAs  to  deliver  mental  health  services  in  communities  across  Texas. 
Their responsibilities in this capacity are set out in Title 25, Chapter 412 of the Texas Administrative Code. See  
Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 533.035, 533.0356, 571.003(11).

Long Term Services and Supports (LTSS):
LTSS  enable  people  age  65  and  over  and  those  with  physical,  psychological,  intellectual,  or  developmental 
disabilities  to  experience  productive  lives  in  safe  living  environments  through  a  continuum  of  services  and 
supports  ranging  from  in-home  and  community-based  services  to  institutional  services.  LTSS,  in  contrast  to 
medical care, are meant to support an individual with ongoing, day-to-day activities, rather than treat or cure a 
disease or condition.

Magistrate:
As used in the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, a magistrate refers to any of the following:

justices of the Supreme Court and judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals;

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

justices of the courts of appeals;

judges of the district courts;

Mental Health Services:
“Mental  Health  Services”  includes  all  services  concerned  with  research,  prevention,  and  detection  of  mental 
disorders and disabilities, and all services necessary to treat, care for, supervise and rehabilitate persons who have 
a mental disorder or disability, including persons whose mental disorders or disabilities result from a substance 
abuse disorder. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 531.002(14).

Mental Health Facility:
A mental health facility refers to:

subdivision, or any person;

•  an inpatient or outpatient mental health facility operated by the department, a federal agency, a political 

•  a community center or a facility operated by a community center;

• 

that identifiable part of a general hospital in which diagnosis, treatment, and care for persons with mental 
illness is provided; or

•  with respect to a reciprocal agreement entered into under section 571.0081 of the Texas Health and Safety 
Code,  any  hospital  or  facility  designated  as  a  place  of  commitment  by  HHSC,  a  local  mental  health 
authority, and the contracting state or local authority.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 571.003.

Note that Chapter 46B of the Code of Criminal Procedure also defines this term and, in contrast to the definition 
above, provides that mental illness is an illness, disease, or condition that grossly impairs (rather than substantially 
impairs) a person’s thoughts, perception of reality, emotional process, or judgment; or grossly impairs behavior as 
demonstrated by recent disturbed behavior. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.001(11).

Modification:
Modification  means  a  change  of  a  class  of  medication  authorized  in  the  psychoactive  medication  order.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.106(j).

Alternatively, and more commonly, the word modification is used when a court order for mental health services is 
changed or modified - e.g., an inpatient commitment may be modified by the court to an outpatient commitment 
and vice versa.

Using This Bench Book  

This Bench Book is a procedural guide organized around the Sequential Intercept Model. 
This Bench Book is a procedural guide for Texas judges hearing cases regarding persons with mental illness and/
or IDD. Each section contains applicable statutory processes, relevant guidance, and mandatory forms (sample 
forms can also be found in an online forms bank on the JCMH website). Statutory language is simplified where 
possible, and practice notes are included in text boxes and footnotes.

The procedures discussed below are organized according to the widely recognized Sequential Intercept Model 
(SIM). This model was developed as a “conceptual framework for communities to organize targeted strategies for 
justice-system involved individuals with behavioral health disorders.”13

Appropriate responses at identified intercepts can prevent entry or divert an individual from the criminal justice 
system. Using the SIM can help communities transform fragmented systems, identify local resources and gaps, 
and develop strategies for intervention. The most effective responses will engage community collaborators early 
and often.

What this Third Edition of the JCMH Bench Book Covers
The ultimate aim of the JCMH Bench Book is to provide guidance to the judiciary for handling issues pertaining 
to mental health and intellectual and developmental disabilities across all intercepts and systems. Specifically, 
this Bench Book will cover:

Early Identification, Assessment, and Diversion

Civil Commitment

Incompetency to Stand Trial

Insanity Defense 

Post-Conviction Procedures

Re-Entry into the Community from Custody

The  first  section  of  this  Bench  Book—Early  Identification,  Assessment,  and  Diversion—spans  Intercepts  0 
through 3, which includes the earliest diversion points in which the justice system is involved. The first edition of 
the JCMH Bench Book described procedures relating to community-based services, emergency detention, initial 
contact with law enforcement, jail, bail, and pre-adjudicatory diversion programs and strategies. It detailed both 
criminal and civil statutory and regulatory procedures relating to early identification and diversion, as well as 
immediate strategies for consistency and improved decision-making.

The second edition of the Bench Book added two new sections: court-ordered services (Intercept 0, section 3) and 
incompetency to stand trial (Intercept 3, section 7). 

The  third  edition  of  the  Bench  Book  adds  two  new  Intercepts  (4  &  5)  and  the  addition  of  Risk  Assessments 
(Intercept  2,  part  2,  section  3),  and  Insanity,  and  Expunctions/Non-Disclosures  (Intercept  3,  sections  8  &  9). 
Legislative changes from the 87th legislative session (2021) are noted throughout the book. Look for boxes with 
this icon:

In  the  context  of  the  judicial  system,  the  concepts  of  justice  and  fairness  should  drive  system  responses  and 
outcomes based on the unique characteristics and individual treatment or rehabilitative needs of each impacted 
person.  Despite differences, practitioners must endeavor to treat each person equally within the framework of due 
process and fundamental fairness. Throughout this bench book, you will find Reflection Points at critical places 
in the processing of a case where the consequences of systemic bias and disproportionality can be minimized. 
Although the Reflection Points are generally directed at judges, each one of us has a role to play in identifying and 
ending systemic bias in the justice system, and we encourage all justice system professionals to use these points 
for honest and thoughtful consideration in their work. Look for Reflection Points with this icon:

Sample forms submitted from several courts can now be found in an online forms bank on the JCMH website: 
http://texasjcmh.gov/publications/resources/. If your court would like to add forms to the online bank, please 
send them to JCMH@txcourts.gov. Note that the third edition of the Bench Book only contains forms mandated 
by the Legislature to be used statewide. Those forms are located within relevant chapters.

There  are  many  additional  topics  related  to  mental  illness  and  IDD,  such  as  substance  use  disorder,  poverty, 
inadequate low-income housing, veterans, trauma (e.g., child abuse, domestic violence, natural disasters), human 
trafficking, race, and other health conditions (e.g., dementia or epilepsy). These issues frequently overlap with 
mental illness and IDD issues and, while critical to a thorough understanding of mental illness and IDD, are not 
the focus of this edition.

Stakeholder Input Is Essential
Finally,  this  Bench  Book  represents  a  collaborative  effort  among  stakeholders  from  across  disciplines.  It  is  a 
dynamic publication that will be regularly updated to incorporate legislative changes, provide current practice 
tips and other practical information, and highlight matters about which stakeholders disagree. If you are reading 
this book, you are a stakeholder, and we value your opinion. If you would like to provide feedback on any part of 
this book, please email us at JCMHBenchBook@txcourts.gov. Thank you for your service and for your interest in 
these issues.

Early Identification and Diversion Procedures

The Judiciary’s Role in Breaking the Cycle of Recidivism
Breaking the cycle of recidivism for people with mental illness or IDD does not begin with the justice system, 
but the justice system is where individuals with mental illness or IDD often find themselves. Early identification 
allows for diversion from the criminal justice system when the criminal acts are clearly attributable to the illness 
or disability. Diversion processes help break the cycle by using community-based treatment and services as an 
alternative to jail.14 Jail-diversion program interventions can occur before or after booking. These programs may 
be court-based, jail-based, or community-based.

Legislation Promoting Early Identification

Although statutes requiring early identification of individuals with mental illness or intellectual disabilities have 
been on the books for decades, the issue received renewed attention in the 85th Texas Legislative Session (2017). 
In response to the tragic suicide of Sandra Bland in a Texas jail three days after a traffic stop in 2015, the 85th 
Legislature passed Senate Bill 1849 (the Sandra Bland Act) amending early- intake and bail procedures for persons 
with MI or ID. 

The bill addressed a variety of criminal justice topics and identified areas of improvement in officer training, jail 
safety, bail reform, and behavioral health and data collection. Specifically, the bill:

• 

shortened the periods for the notice by the jail of possible MI or ID to the magistrate and for completing 
the written report;

•  mandated  release  on  personal  bond  for  a  defendant  with  a  mental  illness  or  intellectual  disability  if 

certain criteria are met;

• 

• 

• 

required law enforcement to make a good-faith effort to divert to treatment a person suffering a mental 
health crisis or from the effects of substance abuse;

required training by law enforcement and jail personnel in the areas of mental illness and intellectual 
disabilities; and

required continuity of, and access to, mental health care, including availability of medication to persons 
incarcerated in Texas jails.

Similarly, resolutions passed by the Texas Judicial Council—the policy-making body for the state judiciary—led 
to legislative changes in the 85th Session that promote early identification. Senate Bill 1326 revised the process of 
collecting information about an arrestee who may have mental illness in the magistration process; streamlined the 
competency restoration process; and allowed counties to establish jail-based competency restoration programs.

Building  on  that  work,  the  86th  Legislature  (2019)  and  the  87th  Legislature  (2021)  likewise  demonstrated  a 
commitment  to  early  identification  and  diversion.  The  JCMH  summarized  the  bills  related  to  mental  health 
and  IDD,  with  a  focus  on  the  criminal  justice  system.  Those  bills,  when  organized  by  sequential  intercept, 
demonstrated comprehensive changes at each point  in the criminal  justice system where  individuals with  MI 
or IDD may be diverted to the community for services.15  The new laws also appropriately concentrated on early 
intercepts, such as public outreach, community services, and initial detention. Relevant legislative changes have 
been noted throughout the Bench Book.

The following are the most notable bills16 affecting early identification and diversion from 2021:

•  Senate  Bill  49  removed  the  requirement  that  a  magistrate  order  a  16.22  interview  if  the  defendant  is 
no longer in custody. This bill amends the statute to focus on screening those individuals suspected of 
mental illness or ID who remain in the jail population, and not “out-of-custody” defendants. The judge, 
however, can still order assessments as deemed appropriate. Senate Bill 49 also expanded the individuals 
required (entitled) to receive the 16.22 report to include defense counsel, the prosecuting attorney, the 
trial court, the sheriff, or other person responsible for the defendant’s medical records while they are in 
county jail, and, if applicable, the personal bond office.

•  Additionally, S.B. 49 removed the requirement that certain individuals with MI or ID “swear under oath” 
that  they  will  appear  in  court  as  part  of  their  release  on  bond.  This  oath  is  waived  for  the  qualifying 
individuals (individuals released under certain statutes involving MI, ID, or a finding of incompetent to 
stand trial).

•  S.B. 49, section 10, specifically requires that while in jail, prisoners with a mental illness be provided with 
each prescription medication that a physician or mental health professional determines to be necessary 
for the care and/or stabilization of the prisoner.

•  House  Bill  3774 codified  the  requirement  that a  justice or  judge  (including a  justice of  the  peace or a 
municipal judge) may not accept a plea of guilty or plea of nolo contendre from a defendant in open court 
unless it appears to the justice or judge that the defendant is mentally competent and the plea is free and 
voluntary. H.B. 3774 added article 45.0241 to the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. 

Civil Commitment as a Diversionary Tool
Civil commitment can be an important diversionary tool, but it is utilized inconsistently and/or sporadically in 
many areas of the state.17 Ideally, civil interventions would occur before an individual ever enters the criminal 
justice system at Intercept 0. Initiation of civil commitment orders and other court- ordered treatment can be 
enhanced with the expansion of innovative programs such as assisted outpatient treatment, advance directives, 
and springing powers of attorney.

Civil commitment remains an option for diversion of some individuals with a mental illness or intellectual disability 
even after an individual enters the criminal justice system. The civil commitment provisions in the Texas Health 
and Safety Code permit the county or district attorney to pursue an order of temporary or extended mental health 
services (45-day, 90-day, or 12-month commitments, as appropriate) for an individual who faces criminal charges, 
provided that the person has not been “charged with a criminal offense that involves an act, attempt, or threat of 
serious bodily injury to another person.” However, note that, with limited exceptions, mental health services may 
be ordered only by a court with probate jurisdiction. Prior to a formal determination of competency, a magistrate 
may release a defendant on a mental health bond so that the court with probate jurisdiction may order services 
as appropriate under applicable law. This alternative has been little utilized but has been authorized since 1995.

Public Outreach

Public Health addresses the importance of laying a groundwork that sets up individuals, families, and public 
outreach systems for appropriate identification and responses to mental health and IDD issues before any justice-
related system comes into play.18 Addressing mental health issues does not and should not begin with the justice 
system.19 While there is no guarantee that an individual with MI or IDD may not eventually interact with the civil 
and/or criminal justice system, early intervention is ideal.20  Therefore, this Bench Book includes Public Health, 
though in the model above, it might be more appropriate for public health to surround all the intercepts.

Mental  health awareness should  be  heightened  through public outreach  to  individuals,  families, and support 
systems. Awareness is intentionally broad and refers to identification as well as awareness of resources.

1.  Health and Human Services

The Texas Health and Human Services System

1.1 
The Texas Health and Human Services (HHS) System is comprised of more than 41,000 public servants under two 
agencies: 

•  The Health and Human Service Commission (HHSC)

•  The Department of State Health Services (DSHS) 

These agencies serve millions of people each month and affect the lives of all Texans, both directly and indirectly. 
The client-focused HHSC delivers hundreds of programs and services. It provides for those who need assistance to

buy necessities, eat nutritious foods, and pay for healthcare costs, by administering programs such as: Temporary 
Assistance  for  Needy  Families  (TANF);  the  Supplemental  Nutrition  Assistance  Program  (SNAP);  the  Special 
Supplemental Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC); Medicaid; and the Children’s Health Insurance 
Program (CHIP). 

The  agency  operates  13  state  supported  living  centers,  which  provide  direct  services  and  supports  to  people 
with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and 10 state hospitals, which serve people who need inpatient 
psychiatric care. All 23 of these facilities are operated all hours of the day, all days of the year. HHSC also provides 
a multitude of additional mental health and substance use services, regulation of childcare and nursing facilities, 
help for people with special healthcare needs, community supports and services for older Texans, disaster relief 
assistance, and resources to fight human trafficking. 

Combined, HHSC programs account for approximately $38 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2020, or about one-third 
of  state  spending.  Of  this  funding,  90  percent  is  used  for  grants  and  client  services,  while  3.6  percent  is  for 
state-operated, facility-based services, and 6.4 percent is for administrative services, including the functions of 
eligibility determination services, contract management, financial services, information technology, regulatory 
services, and oversight.21

1.1.1  Statewide Behavioral Health Strategic Plan
Within HHSC, there are divisions and strategies focused on behavioral health services—which encompass both 
mental health and substance use disorders (SUDs). Texas has come to recognize the unique needs of individuals 
with  complex  behavioral  health  issues.  These  individuals  experience  a  range  of  other  risk  factors,  including 
unemployment, homelessness, and co-occurring health issues. Texas also appreciates the need for specialized 
services for individuals with intellectual disabilities, new mothers with depression, and military trauma-affected 
veterans and their families.

Technological innovations such as telehealth and telemedicine allow people to have greater access to the care they 
need without having to drive hours to receive it. Agencies now have increased access to behavioral health data to 
inform decision making. Texas state agencies have continued to move toward research-based assessment tools and 
services that enable us to do a better job defining and coordinating services. There are also noted improvements 
in cross agency coordination and collaboration. 

1.1.2  Behavioral Health Advisory Committee
The  Health  and  Human  Services  Commission  established  the  Behavioral  Health  Advisory  Committee  as 
the  state  mental  health  planning  council  in  accordance  with  the  state’s  obligations  under  42  U.S.C.  
§ 3 00x-3.

The purpose of the committee is to provide customer/consumer and stakeholder input to the Health and Human 
Services system  in  the  form of  recommendations  regarding  the allocation and adequacy of  behavioral  health 
services and programs within the State of Texas. The BHAC considers and makes recommendations to the HHS 
Executive Commissioner consistent with the committee’s purpose.

Recommendations22 to Health and Human Services system agencies regarding behavioral health services include:

•  The promotion of cross-agency coordination, state/local and public/private partnerships in the funding 

and delivery of behavioral health services;

•  The promotion of data-driven decision-making;

In  an  effort  to  improve  coordination  between  state  agencies  and  to  create  a  strategic  approach  to  providing 
behavioral health services, lawmakers directed the creation of a statewide mental health coordinator position 
through the2014-15 General Appropriations Act, Senate Bill (S.B.) 1, 83rd Legislature, Regular Session, 2013 (Article 
II, Health and Human Services Commission, Rider 82) and 84th Legislature, Regular Session, 2015 (Article IX, 
Section  10.04)  by  directing  18  state  agencies  that  receive  general  revenue  behavioral  health  funding  to  work 
collectively to develop this collaborative five-year behavioral health strategic plan and coordinated expenditures 
proposal.23

1.1.4  Statewide IDD Strategic Plan  
In  addition  to  developing  a  five-year  strategic  plan  to  address  gaps  in  the  behavioral  health  services  system, 
stakeholders across Texas recognize the unique challenges faced by individuals with intellectual and developmental 
disabilities  (IDD).  In response, stakeholders  identified the  need to develop a  Statewide  IDD  Strategic  Plan to 
focus on the IDD system across the state. The Foundation of the Statewide IDD Strategic Plan is the first phase 
in the development.

1.1.5  Mental Health Texas Website
The website serves as a one-stop resource for behavioral health services across the state. Mental Health Block 
Grant funding is being used to enhance the mentalhealthtx.org website. It reflects the work of the HHSC Office 
of Mental Health Coordination and the strategic goals of the 23 member agencies that comprise the Council. An 
update and enhancement to the site funded in part by a SAMHSA grant will allow for Council members to update 
the site with individual agency resource and contact information.24 Advanced web-based resources such as 2-1-
1, MentalHealthTX.org, the ASK: Ask About Suicide App, Behavioral Health Wellness and Mental Health First 
Aid (MHFA) trainings, and the Texas Veterans Phone App connect Texans to behavioral health services and live 
supports.

1.1.6  State Forensic Director
The 84th Legislature created a Forensic Director position within in HHSC  to coordinate and oversee forensic 
services and to address issues such as the significant increases in populations with serious mental illness and 
criminal justice system involvement, adequate availability of department facilities for civilly committed forensic 
patients, wait times for forensic patients who require competency restoration services, interruption of mental 
health services of recently released forensic patients, statewide coordination and oversight of forensic services; 
and coordination of services provided to forensic patients by state agencies.25

Joint Commission on Access and Forensic Services

1.1.7 
The Department of State Health Services established the Joint Committee on Access and Forensic Services in 
accordance with S.B. 1507, 84th Legislature, Regular Session, 2015.

The purpose of the committee is to provide customer/consumer and stakeholder input to the Health and Human 
Services system in the form of recommendations regarding access to forensic services within the state of Texas. 
The JCAFS considers and makes recommendations to the Legislature consistent with the committee’s purpose.

Recommendations26 to the Legislature regarding access to forensic services include:

•  Monitoring the implementation of updates to the bed day allocation methodology for allocating to each 
designated region a certain number of state-funded beds in state hospitals and other inpatient mental 
health facilities for voluntary, civil and forensic patients.

• 

Implementing a bed day utilization review protocol, including a peer review process.

•  Planning for the coordination of forensic services.

Public Health Initiatives and Best Practices

Individual Awareness: 

2.1 
Identifying  mental  illness  is  the  first  step  to  effective  responses.  Individuals  can  seek  medical  assistance  and 
treatment if they are able to recognize that it is necessary to seek help and comply with prescribed medications 
and/or treatment. Comprehensive treatment plans that are proactive and focus on developing protective factors 
against  mental  illness provide  long-term effects. Avenues of awareness  include schools,  medical professionals 
(especially pediatricians), and media.

Mental Health Workforce Shortage

According to NAMI-Texas, three million Texans live in counties that have no psychiatrist. About 200 of the state’s 
254 counties have a mental health workforce shortage. Therefore, some Texans travel long distances for care 
and  others  use  telehealth  services.  Some  specific  recommendations  to  address  this  issue  include  step-down, 
supportive housing in communities and peer support services. S.B. 1636 (86th Reg. Sess. (2019)) requires the 
Health  Professions  Council  to  include  in  its  annual  report  strategies  to  expand  the  health  care  workforce, 
including  methods  for  increasing  the  number  of  health  care  practitioners  providing  mental  and  behavioral 
health care services.

Family Support 

 2.2 
Often family or friends are the first to respond to a crisis for a loved one. Organizations like the National Alliance 
on Mental Health (NAMI), and the Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC) provide guidelines for how to respond to 
a mental health crisis, including how to navigate HIPPA, how to find available resources within the community, 
and how to navigate the civil and criminal justice system.

Public Outreach:  

2.3 
Public outreach and campaigns to enhance mental health awareness enable citizens, loved ones, and professionals 
to identify and correctly respond to the need for mental health interventions before a crisis occurs.

https://www.hhs.texas.gov/about-hhs/leadership/advisory-committees/joint-committee-access-forensic-services (last visited, Aug. 2, 2021). 

19

2.4 

Advance Directives: 

Advance directives enable an appointment of an agent to give consent or make decisions on an individual’s behalf 
concerning  medical,  mental  health,  and  financial  issues.    Some  examples  include  powers  of  attorney  (POA), 
psychiatric  advance  directives  (PAD),  “springing”  powers  of  attorney,  and  appointment  of  guardianship  for 
incapacity determinations.

2.5 

Public Awareness Initiative: Eliminate the Wait

To address  the growing crisis  in effectively serving  the number of  people waiting in county jails for inpatient 
competency  restoration  services,  the  JCMH  and  HHSC  have  partnered  with  key  stakeholders  across  Texas  to 
develop  a  campaign  to  right-size  competency  restoration  services  for  Texans.  The  effort  calls  for  a 
comprehensive and integrated approach to Eliminate the Wait. See the Eliminate the Wait Checklist Series on 
the JCMH website.

Community-based Mental Health Services

1. 
Community-based  mental  health  services  are  available  for  individuals  with  intellectual  disabilities,  other 
developmental  disabilities,  serious  mental  illnesses,  and  substance  use  disorders.  As  a  judge  and  community 
leader, it is advantageous to have a general understanding of those resources.27

Services Provided by LMHAs/LBHAs

1.1 
Each of the 39 LMHAs/LBHAs is required to provide:

•  crisis-response services for all individuals in the service area; and

•  ongoing outpatient mental health services for individuals who meet diagnostic and need- based 

eligibility requirements.

27 HHSC has a program called 2-1-1 Texas, which helps Texas citizens connect with services. See https://www.211texas.org/about-2-1-1/ for more 
information. See also the Texas Mental Health Resource Guide, created by Judge Barbara Hervey, Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, and her staff. 
It is a compilation of mental health and substance use disorder resources across Texas organized by county. The first edition (2019) is available 
at https://www.txcourts.gov/media/1444700/texas-mental-health-resource-guide-email-corrected-09092019.pdf.

Crisis Services

1.2 
A crisis is defined as a situation in which:

•  an individual presents an immediate danger to self or others;

•  an individual’s mental or physical health is at risk of serious deterioration; or

•  an individual believes either that:

 ◦ he or she presents an immediate danger to self or others; or
 ◦ his or her mental or physical health is at risk of serious deterioration. 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 412.303(13).

All  providers of crisis  services  must  be available  24  hours a day, every day of  the year,  to  perform  immediate 
screenings  and  assessments  of  individuals  in  crisis,  including  assessments  to  determine  risk  of  deterioration 
and  immediate  danger  to  self  or  others.  Crisis  assessments  cannot  be  delegated  to  law  enforcement  officials.  
25 Tex. Admin. Code § 412.321.

1.2.1  What Crisis Response Services Include  
Crisis response services include three services:

•  a crisis screening;

•  a crisis assessment; and

•  a recommendation about the level of care required to resolve the crisis.

An LMHA/LBHA shall ensure immediate screenings and assessments of any person found in the LMHA/LBHA’s 
local  service  area  who  is  experiencing  a  crisis  in  accordance  with  Texas  Administrative  Code,  Title  25,  Part  1, 
Chapter 412, Subchapter G, Division 2, section 412.314, which governs access to mental health community services. 
25 Tex. Admin. Code § 412.161.

LMHAs/LBHAs Conduct Crisis Response for Both MI and ID

For persons with MI and IDD, crisis response will be conducted by the LMHA/LBHA. However, it is recommended 
that the LMHA/LBHA consult with the LIDDA. For persons with IDD who are NOT in crisis, the LIDDA will serve as 
the point of access for services. In all but two Texas counties (Bexar and Dallas) the LMHA and LIDDA functions 
are performed by one local agency. See Tex. Health & Safety Code § 533.035(a).

Note: In Bexar County, the Alamo Area Council of Government serves as the LIDDA. In Dallas County, Metrocare 
serves as the LIDDA.

1.2.2  Crisis Screening and Response System
All LMHAs/LBHAs have a crisis screening and response system in operation 24/7 that is available to individuals 
throughout its contracted service delivery area. 28The telephone system to access the crisis screening and response 
system includes a toll-free crisis hotline number. The crisis hotline number is prominently placed on each LMHA/
LBHA website and is typically the primary point of contact for a county jail that does not have mental health 
professionals available on staff or through a local contract.

28 HHSC Performance Contract, Excerpts from Information Item V, Crisis Services Standards.

22

1.2.3  Crisis Hotline
The crisis hotline is a continuously available telephone service staffed by trained and competent QMPC-CSs who 
provide information, screening, intervention, support, and referrals to callers 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
The hotline facilitates referrals to 911, a Mobile Crisis Outreach Team (discussed below), or other crisis services 
and conducts follow-up contacts to ensure that callers successfully accessed the referred services. If an emergency 
is not evident after further screening, the hotline includes referral to other appropriate resources within or outside 
the LMHA/LBHA local service area. The hotline works in close collaboration with local law enforcement, 211, and 
911 systems.

1.2.4  Mobile Crisis Outreach Team (MCOT)
When the crisis hotline is called, the crisis hotline staff member provides a crisis screening, and determines if 
the crisis situation requires deployment of the LMHA/LBHA MCOT. If the crisis situation is determined to be 
emergent or urgent, at least one trained MCOT member shall respond to the site of the crisis situation and conduct 
a crisis assessment. Immediately upon arrival, a face-to-face screening shall be completed by at least a QMPC-
CS if a telephone screening has not been previously completed. MCOTs provide a combination of crisis services 
including emergency care, urgent care, crisis follow-up, and relapse prevention to the child, youth, or adult in the 
community. Some local intellectual and developmental disability authorities operate integrated teams to include 
staff with IDD expertise but may not always have a professional available for the crisis call.

Note: Some counties, such as Travis County, have Expanded Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams (EMCOT) that respond 
to law enforcement when a crime has been committed, but there is a diversion agreement with law enforcement.

1.2.5  What a Crisis Assessment Includes
A crisis assessment shall include an evaluation of risk of harm to self or others, presence or absence of cognitive 
signs suggesting delirium, need for immediate full crisis assessment, need for emergency intervention, and an 
evaluation of the need for an immediate medical screening/assessment by a physician (preferably a psychiatrist), 
psychiatric advanced practice nurse, physician assistant or registered nurse.29

After the crisis assessment  is conducted, the  LMHA/LBHA will  make a recommendation about the treatment 
necessary to resolve the crisis.

1.2.6  Emergency Care Services: LMHA/LBHA Shall Respond Within One Hour
If, during a crisis screening, it is determined that an individual is experiencing a crisis that may require emergency 
care services, the QMHP-CS must:

• 

take immediate action to address the emergency situation to ensure the safety of all parties involved;

•  activate the immediate screening and assessment processes as described in title 25, section 412.321 of the 

Texas Administrative Code; and

•  provide or obtain  mental  health community  services or other  necessary  interventions  to  stabilize  the 

crisis.

25 Tex. Admin. Code § 412.314(1)(B).

For emergency calls, a face-to-face crisis response (or telehealth based on policies and procedures approved by 
the medical director) shall be provided within one hour. After crisis intervention services are provided, and if 
the  individual  is still  in  need of emergency care services, then the  individual shall  be assessed  by a physician 
(preferably a psychiatrist) within 12 hours.

29 HHSC Performance Contract, Excerpts from Information Item V, Crisis Services Standards.

23

1.2.7  Urgent Care Services: LMHA/LBHA Shall Respond Within Eight Hours
If  the crisis screening  indicates  that an  individual  needs urgent care services, a  QMHP-CS shall, within eight 
hours of the initial incoming hotline call or notification of a potential crisis situation:

•  provide or obtain  mental  health community  services or other  necessary  interventions  to  stabilize  the 

•  perform a face-to-face assessment; and

crisis.

25 Tex. Admin. Code § 412.314(1)(C).

Legislative Change

In 2019, the legislature enacted a one-time initiative to better leverage the resources of individual 
LMHAs  by  requiring  LMHAs  to  work  together  in  groups  to  produce  regional  plans  to  build  new 
capacity, reduce local government costs, lower emergency room visits, and reduce transportation 
costs. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the regional planning groups were only able to partially fulfill 
their purpose. S.B. 454 (87th Reg. Sess. (2021)) provides for the continuation of the LMHA groups and makes the 
planning process permanent.

S.B. 454 (87th Reg. Sess. (2021)) adds Tex. Gov’t Code § 531.0222 and requires each LMHA group (determined 
by HHSC) to meet at least quarterly to collaborate on planning and implementing regional strategies to 
reduce the following:

• 

• 

• 

• 

costs to local governments of providing services to persons experiencing a mental health crisis;

transportation to mental health facilities of persons served by a member LMHA;

incarceration of persons with mental illness in county jails that are located in an area served by a member 
LMHA; and

visits by persons with mental illness at hospital emergency rooms located in an area served by a member 
LMHA.

Additionally,  S.B.  454  requires  HHSC,  in  coordination  with  each  LMHA,  to  annually  update  the  mental  health 
services development plan that was initially developed by HHSC and the group. The updated plan must include a 
description of actions taken by the group to implement the plan’s regional strategies and new regional strategies 
identified  by  the  group  to  reduce  the  circumstances  set  out  by  the  bill,  including  the  estimated  number  of 
outpatient and inpatient beds necessary to meet the goals of each group’s regional strategy.

HHSC is required, not later than December  1 of each year,  beginning in 2022, to produce and publish on its 
website a report containing the most recent version of each mental health services development plan developed 
by HHSC and an LMHA group. The bill requires HHSC to use federal funds in accordance with state and federal 
guidelines to implement the bill’s provisions.

Ongoing Non-crisis Outpatient Mental Health Services

1.3 
Individuals who  meet diagnostic-  and  need-based  requirements will  be  assigned a  level of  care  to determine 
which services they may be eligible to receive. Section 534.53 of the Texas Health and Safety Code describes the 
required community-based mental health services:

(A) HHSC shall ensure at a minimum, the following are available in each LMHA/LBHA service area:

(1)  24-hour emergency screening and rapid crisis stabilization services;

(2)  community-based crisis residential services or hospitalization;

(3)  community-based assessments, including the development of interdisciplinary treatment plans and 

diagnosis and evaluation services;

(4)  medication-related  services,  including  medication  clinics,  laboratory  monitoring,  medication 

education, mental health maintenance education, and the provision of medication; and

(5)  psychosocial rehabilitation programs, including social support activities, independent living skills, 

and vocational training.

(B) HHSC shall arrange for appropriate community-based services to be available in each service area for each 

person discharged from a department facility who is in need of care.

(C) To the extent that resources are available, HHSC shall:

(1)  ensure that the services listed in this section are available for children, including adolescents, as well 

as adults, in each service area;

(2)  emphasize early intervention services for children, including adolescents, who meet the department’s 
definition of being at high risk of developing severe emotional disturbances or severe mental illnesses; 
and

(3)  ensure that services listed in this section are available for defendants required to submit to mental 
health treatment under articles 17.032 (Personal Bond for Person with MI or ID, discussed in Intercept 
2, Part II, section 1 of this Bench Book) or 42A.104 or 42A.506 (Community Supervision of Person with 
MI or ID, discussed in Intercept 3 of this Bench Book) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.

Eligibility for ongoing outpatient mental health treatment is a diagnosis- and need-based determination governed 
by state and federal requirements and the HHSC performance contract with LMHAs/LBHAs and section 534.053 
of the Texas Health and Safety Code.

The  Adult  Mental  Health  Priority  Population  are  people  age  18  or  older  who  have  a  diagnosis  of  severe  and 
persistent MI with the application of significant functional impairment and the highest need for intervention. 
This would include people who have severe and persistent MI such as schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar 
disorder,  post-traumatic  stress disorder, obsessive  compulsive  disorder,  bulimia  nervous, anorexia  nervosa, or 
other severely disabling mental disorders that require crisis resolution or ongoing and long-term support and 
treatment.

The Child and Youth Mental Health Priority Population are children ages 3-17 with serious emotional disturbance 
(excluding a single diagnosis of substance abuse, IDD, or autism spectrum disorder) who have a serious functional 
impairment or who are at risk of disruption of a preferred living or child care environment due to psychiatric 
symptoms or are enrolled in special education because of a serious emotional disturbance.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 534.053.

Note: Section 534.053(c) of the Texas Health and Safety Code acknowledges the reality of resource limitations for 
defendants who are court-ordered to receive mental health treatment under articles 17.032, 42A.104, or 42A.506 
of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.

Community-based IDD Services  

2.1 

How People with IDD Receive Services and Supports

2.1.1  Waiver Services
Waiver services include the following:

•  Home and Community-based Services (HCS) is a Medicaid waiver program approved by Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) pursuant to section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act. It provides 
community-based services and supports to eligible individuals as an alternative to an intermediate care 
facility for individuals with an intellectual disability or related conditions program. The HCS Program 
is operated by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC), formerly the Department of 
Aging and Disabilities Services. 40 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 9.153(36), 9.154(a).

•  Texas Home Living (TxHmL) supplies essential services and supports to Texans with ID or a related 

condition so that they can continue to live in the community.

•  Community Living Assistance and Support Services (CLASS) provides home- and community-based 
services to people with related conditions as a cost-effective alternative to placement in Intermediate Care 
Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/IID).

•  Deaf-blind with Multiple Disabilities (DBMD) focuses on increasing opportunities for people who 
are deaf-blind with multiple disabilities to communicate and interact with their environment, providing 
a cost-effective alternative to institutional placement.

2.1.2  State Plan Services
Community First Choice (CFC) is a state plan option that allows states to provide home- and community-based 
attendant services and supports to eligible Medicaid enrollees under their state plan.

2.2 

How Programs are Funded

Medicaid Waivers are federal funds that help provide services to people who would otherwise being an institution, 
nursing home, or hospital to receive long-term care in the community.

General Revenue (GR) Funded Services are state funds from the GR that are primarily intended to help people 
remain in their own or their family’s homes. Not all GR funded services are available in all areas of the state. GR 
services are provided by or directly through a LIDDA.

• 

Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with an ID or Related Condition (ICF/IID)

2.3  Where Services are Provided  

•  State Supported Living Centers (SSLC)

•  Nursing Facilities

2.4 

LIDDAs Serve Individuals with IDD

2.4.1  The Role of LIDDAs
A LIDDA’s role is to serve as the single point of access to certain publicly funded services and supports for the 
residents within the LIDDA’s local service area. A LIDDA’s responsibilities include:

•  providing information about services and supports;

•  ensuring an individual’s access to services and supports by:

 ◦ conducting intake and eligibility activities for an individual seeking services and supports; and
 ◦ enrolling or assisting an eligible individual to access long-term services and supports or GR revenue 

services;

28

•  performing safety net functions ensuring the provision and oversight of general revenue services by:

 ◦ developing and managing a network of general revenue services providers; and
 ◦ establishing processes to monitor the performance of general revenue services providers;

•  conducting service coordination for individuals in HCS, TxHml, and GR;

•  conducting  planning  for  the  local  service  area,  including  ensuring  involvement  by  a  local  advisory 

committee and other stakeholders;

•  conducting permanency planning for certain individuals under 22 years of age; and 

•  protecting the rights of an individual.

40 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 2.305, 9.154; see also LIDDA Performance Contract.30

2.4.2  Types of Services Offered or Contracted
Service coordination helps people access medical, social, educational, and other services and supports that will 
help them achieve an acceptable quality of life and community participation.

Community supports are individualized activities that are provided in the person’s home and at community 
locations, such as libraries and stores. Supports may include:

•  habilitation and support activities that foster improvement of, or facilitate, the person’s ability to perform 

daily living activities;

placement of the person;

•  activities  for  the  person’s  family  that  help  preserve  the  family  unit  and  prevent  or  limit  out-of-home 

transportation for the person between home and his or her community employment site or day habilitation 
site; and

transportation  to  facilitate  the  person’s  employment  opportunities  and  participation  in  community 
activities.

Respite is either planned or emergency short-term relief provided by trained staff to the person’s unpaid caregiver 
when the caregiver is temporarily unavailable. If enrolled in other services, the person continues to receive those 
services as needed during the respite period.

Employment assistance helps people locate paid jobs, and includes helping them:

identify employment preferences, skills, and work requirements and conditions; and 

identify prospective employers who offer appropriate employment.

• 

• 

• 

• 

Supported employment  is  provided  to  a  person  who  has  paid  employment  to  help  him  or  her  sustain  that 
employment. It includes individualized support services, supervision, and training.

Nursing is provided to people who require treatment and monitoring of health care procedures that are prescribed 
by a physician or medical practitioner or that are required by standards of professional practice or state law to be 
performed by licensed nursing personnel.

Behavioral supports are specialized interventions to help people increase adaptive behaviors and to replace or 
modify maladaptive behaviors that prevent or interfere with their inclusion in home and family life or community 
life. Supports include: 

•  assessing and analyzing assessment findings so that an appropriate behavior support plan can be designed;

•  developing  an  individualized  behavior  support  plan  consistent  with  the  outcomes  identified  in  the 

person-directed plan;

• 

training and consulting with family members or other providers and, as appropriate, to the person; and

•  monitoring and evaluating the success of the behavior support plan and modifying it as necessary.

Specialized therapies include assessment and treatment by licensed or certified professionals for social work 
services,  counseling  services,  occupational  therapy,  physical  therapy,  speech  and  language  therapy,  audiology 
services,  dietary  services,  and  behavioral  health  services  other  than  those  provided  by  an  LMHA,  as  well  as 
training and consulting with family members or other providers.

Vocational training is a service provided to people in industrial enclaves, work crews, sheltered workshops or 
affirmative industry settings to help them get a job.

Day habilitation is assistance with getting, keeping, or improving self-help, socialization, and adaptive skills 
necessary to live successfully in the community and to participate in home and community life. Day habilitation is 
normally provided regularly in a group setting (not in the person’s residence) and includes personal assistance for 
those who cannot manage their personal care needs during day habilitation and need assistance with medications 
and performing tasks delegated by a registered nurse.

Medicaid Program Enrollment:  LIDDAs are responsible for enrolling eligible  individuals  into the following 
Medicaid programs:

• 

Intermediate  Care  Facilities for  Individuals with  Intellectual  Disabilities  (a  24-hour residential setting 
including state-supported living centers);

•  Home and Community-based Services (HCS);31 and

Transition Support Teams (TST) were originally developed to assist people in the transition from an institutional 
setting (e.g., SSLCs and nursing facilities) into a community setting, but these TSTs have since expanded their 
reach. Because individuals with complex needs often require more experienced staff, HHSC has contracted with 
eight LIDDAs across Texas to provide support to other LIDDAs and community waiver providers in designated 
service areas.

The eight contracted LIDDAs have teams that offer educational activities, technical assistance, and case review. 
The teams have licensed medical staff such as physicians, registered nurses, psychiatrists, and psychologists with 
experience working with people with IDD.

These programs are currently funded through the Money Follows the Person (MFP) Grant which is distributed 
by CMS to Texas and passed on to the LIDDAs. Because MFP rebalancing funds are evaluated yearly, uncertainty 
of ongoing funding affects the existence of the TST Program. LIDDAs are aware that funding is subject to change 
based on guidance from CMS which impacts whether or not the TST program is an available resource.

Housing through the HCS Program

The  HCS  Program  can  be  an  important  diversionary  program  because  it  can  provide  housing  to  prevent  an 
individual’s  admission  to  institutional  services.  Providers  offering  services  under  the  HCS  program  maintain 
three- to four-bed group homes where individuals reside. When residing in an HCS group home, individuals are 
entitled to many services, including:

• 

supervised and supported home living 24 hours a day, seven days a week;

•  direct personal assistance with activities of daily living (grooming, eating, bathing, dressing, and personal 

hygiene);

•  assistance with meal planning and preparation;

• 

securing and providing transportation;

•  assistance with housekeeping;

•  day habilitation;

• 

supported employment;

•  financial management services;

•  behavioral support by a licensed professional;

• 

social worker;

•  physicians;

•  dietary services; and

•  dental treatment.

•  assistance with medications and the performance of tasks delegated by a registered nurse;

Those interested in receiving HCS services are placed on an interest list by the LIDDA until funding becomes 
available.  An  offer  from  the  HCS  program  to  provide  services  depends  on  individual  need  and  one’s  date  of 
placement on the interest list.  Further, funding each individual placement depends on the outcome of HHSC’s 
Legislative Appropriations Request (LAR) where HHSC outlines its funding requirements and/or needs for the 
upcoming biennium.

Civil Mental Health Law: The Texas Mental Health Code  

3. 
The statutes that govern the provision of mental health treatment are found in Chapters 571 – 578 of the Texas 
Health and Safety Code, commonly referred to as the “Texas Mental Health Code.” These substantive provisions 
and procedures apply to all public and private facilities operating in the State of Texas. It is important to remember 
that the purpose of the Mental Health Code is to provide persons with severe mental illness33 access to humane 
care  and  treatment  in  the  least  restrictive appropriate  setting  while  also  protecting  their  fundamental  rights.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 571.002.

An individual 16 years of age or older may decide voluntarily to request mental health treatment. For adults, only 
the patient seeking such treatment may voluntarily agree to the treatment. Chapter 572 of the Texas Mental Health 
Code addresses the requirements for voluntary admission to mental health treatment. Voluntary admission does 
not involve the court except when the involuntary commitment process is initiated because a voluntary patient 
requests discharge and a treating physician determines that the person poses an imminent risk of harm to self or 
others unless continued treatment is provided. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.004. Courts may also be involved 

33 For provisions related to persons with ID, see the Persons with Intellectual Disabilities Act (PIDA) located in Title 7, Subtitle D, Chapters 591-597 
of the Texas Health and Safety Code.

31

when violations of the Mental Health Code in reference to voluntary patients are brought to the attention of the 
judge and the judge’s role as a magistrate comes into play.34 

Involuntary civil commitment, referred to in the Mental Health Code as court-ordered mental health services, 
represents a deprivation of personal liberty and of the right of self-determination regarding treatment.  As such, 
a court must delicately balance the civil liberties of a person with mental illness and that person’s right to live life 
as they desire against the government’s interest in public safety. As the name suggests, civil commitment is a civil, 
not criminal, process; yet it can still result in a denial of freedom and basic constitutional rights. Because of this, 
court-ordered mental health services are only authorized when the mental illness is likely to pose a substantial 
risk of serious harm either to the patient or to others and inpatient mental health treatment is the least restrictive 
appropriate setting.

3.1 

Jurisdiction

3.1.1  Courts

• 

• 

• 

• 

•  Statutory probate courts and county courts at law have jurisdiction over civil mental health proceedings 
for  persons  who  do  not  have  criminal  charges  pending.  These  courts  also  share  jurisdiction  with 
constitutional county courts.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.008(a).

In a county with no county court at law, and in which the county judge is not a lawyer, a district court 
has jurisdiction to hear civil mental health cases, and the case may be transferred there if the proposed 
patient’s attorney files such a request. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.008(b).  

If a patient is receiving temporary inpatient mental health services in a county other than the county 
that initiated the court-ordered inpatient mental health services, and the patient then requires extended 
inpatient mental health services, the patient shall be transferred back to the county where the proceedings 
originated, UNLESS the initial court arranges with the appropriate court in the county where the patient 
is  receiving  services  to  hold  the  hearing  before  the  original  order  expires.  Tex.  Health  &  Safety  Code  
§ 574.008(c).

If a patient receives court-ordered outpatient services in a different county from the court that ordered 
the services, the court can transfer the case to an appropriate court in that county, and then that court 
shall have exclusive, continuing jurisdiction. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.008(d).

3.1.2  Associate Judges (formerly Masters)

If the commissioners court authorizes it, a county judge may appoint a full-time or part-time associate 
judge to preside over the proceedings for court-ordered mental health services. Tex. Health & Safety Code 
§ 574.0085(a).

 ◦ To be eligible for such an appointment, a person must be a resident of Texas and have practiced law in 

Texas for at least four years; or

Safety Code § 574.0085(b).

Code § 574.085(e).

 ◦ be a retired county judge, statutory or constitutional, with at least 10 years of service.  Tex. Health & 

•  To refer cases to an associate judge, the referring court must issue an order of referral. Tex. Health & Safety 

 ◦

If a jury trial is demanded or required, the associate judge shall refer the entire matter back to the 
referring court for trial. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.085(j).

In 2009, the Legislature passed H.B. 890, which amended Section 574.0085 of the Texas Health and Safety Code 
by striking the term “master” from the code and substituting the term “associate judge.”

3.1.3  Magistrates

& Safety Code § 573.012.

•  Magistrates may sign emergency detention warrants. Tex. Code of Crim. Procedure Art. 2.09, Tex. Health 

Magistrate’s Emergency Detention Powers Limited in Some Counties

Under subsection 573.012(a) of the Texas Health and Safety Code, a probate judge may issue an administrative 
order  requiring  that  all  emergency  detention  warrants  be  submitted  personally  to  the  court  with  probate 
jurisdiction,  rather  than  retained  by  court  staff  and  submitted  to  another  judge  or  a  magistrate  as  soon  as 
practicable. In counties where there is more than one judge with probate jurisdiction, all the judges must agree 
to such an order. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.012(g).

•  A judge of the mental health court may also designate a magistrate to sign Orders of Protective Custody. 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.021(e).

3.1.4  Habeas Corpus

•  A petition  for a writ of  habeas corpus arising  from a commitment order  must  be  filed  in  the court of 

appeals for the county in which the order is entered. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 571.0167(a).

3.2 

Voluntary Mental Health Services

3.2.1  Request for Admission

•  A  person  16 years  of  age  or  older  may  request  admission  to  an  inpatient  mental  health  facility  or  for 
outpatient mental health services by filing a request with the administrator of the facility where admission 
or outpatient treatment is requested. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.001(a).

Mental Health Law and Minors

At  16,  a  person  is  considered  an  adult  for  the  purposes  of  seeking  mental  health  treatment.  However,  there 
are special rules for those 18 and under. Those rules will be discussed in a later edition of this Bench Book. The 
current section focuses on persons 18 and older seeking treatment.

•  An admission request must be in writing and signed by the person requesting the admission. Tex. Health 

& Safety Code § 572.001(b).

•  A request for admission as a voluntary patient must state that the person for whom admission is requested 
agrees to voluntarily remain in the facility until the person’s discharge and that the person consents to the 
diagnosis, observation, care, and treatment provided until the earlier of:

 ◦
 ◦

the person’s discharge; or

the period prescribed by section 572.004.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.001(e).

33

How “Voluntary” is Voluntary Mental Health Treatment?

Under a voluntary civil commitment, a patient may request a discharge, but a facility has four hours in which 
to notify a physician of the patient’s request, and that physician must make a determination whether there is 
reasonable cause to believe the patient meets the criteria for court-ordered mental health services or emergency 
detention. The physician has 24 hours from the initial request to conduct an examination and decide whether 
the patient should be discharged, or whether the facility should pursue court-ordered mental health services. See 
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.004 and section 3.2.6 below for the statutory requirements for discharge as well 
as 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 404.157 for the accompanying administrative rules regarding requests for discharge.

3.2.2  Admission
After the person requests admission to a facility, the facility may admit the person if the facility determines:

• 

• 

• 

that the person has symptoms of mental illness and will benefit from the inpatient or outpatient services 
after conducting a preliminary exam;

that the person has been informed of the person’s rights as a voluntary patient; and

that the admission was voluntarily agreed to by said person. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.002.

Note also  that  the  facility  must ascertain whether  the person  has sufficient capacity  to consent  to admission.  
See Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113 (1990).

3.2.3 

Information on Medications

•  A mental health facility must provide a patient with information about the patient’s medication ordered 
by a treating physician. The information must, if possible, be in the patient’s own language. Tex. Health 
& Safety Code § 572.0022(a).

•  A facility must also provide the information to the patient’s family if they request it, but only if it does not 

violate state and federal privacy laws. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.0022(b).

3.2.4 

Intake, Assessment, and Admission

•  HHSC  has  promulgated  administrative  regulations  that  establish  rules  regarding  the  intake  and 
assessment process that takes place prior to a formal admission of the patient to an  inpatient facility. 
These rules govern a patient’s consent to treatment as well as ensure the patient’s understanding of the 
financial commitments such treatment will entail. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.0025.

•  The three following terms are defined in a way that is unique to this section. 

 ◦ An “admission” means the formal acceptance of a prospective patient to a facility. Tex. Health & Safety 

Code § 572.0025(h)(1).

 ◦ An  “assessment”  means  the  administrative  process  a  facility  uses  to  gather  information  from  a 
prospective patient to determine whether a prospective patient should be examined by a physician to 
determine if admission is clinically justified. This term does not refer to the examination that must be 
performed within 72 hours before or 24 hours after a patient or  prospective patient is admitted to the 
facility. Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 572.0025(g), (f); 572.0025(h)(2).

 ◦

“Intake” means the administrative process for gathering information about a prospective patient and 
giving a prospective patient information about the facility and treatment services. Tex. Health & Safety 
Code § 572.0025(h)(3).

•  The rules governing the intake process shall establish minimum standards for:

reviewing a prospective patient’s finances and insurance benefits;

 ◦
 ◦ explaining to a prospective patient the patient’s rights; and

34

 ◦ explaining to a prospective patient the facility’s services and treatment process. Tex. Health & Safety 

Code § 572.0025(b).

•  The rules governing the assessment process prescribe:

 ◦ The types of professionals who may conduct an assessment,
 ◦ The minimum credentials each type of professional must have to conduct an assessment; and
 ◦ The type of assessment that professional may conduct. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.0025(d).

•  The applicable rules can be found in the Texas Administrative Code. 25 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 411.490; 411.461.

•  A prospective patient may not be formally admitted to the facility unless:

there is an order from a physician who has conducted a physical and psychiatric exam of the patient, 
in person or through communications technology:

 –

 –

72 hours before admission; or

24 hours after admission; or

 ◦

 ◦

 ◦

the admitting physician consulted with another physician who examined the patient within the above 
time frames; and

the facility agrees to accept the patient in writing. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.0025(f).

• 

If a facility admits a patient prior to performing a physical and psychiatric exam, the patient  must  be 
immediately  discharged  if  a  physician  performing  the  exams  after  admittance  determines  the  person 
does not meet clinical standards to receive inpatient mental health services. Tex. Health & Safety Code  
§ 572.0025(f)(1).

• 

If a person is discharged under these circumstances, the facility may not bill the patient or the patient’s 
insurance for the temporary admission. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.0025(f)(2).

3.2.5  Rights of Patients

•  A person’s voluntary admission into an inpatient mental health facility does not affect any legal capacity, 
civil rights, or the person’s right to obtain a writ of habeas corpus. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.003(a).

Mental Illness, Legal Capacity, and Competency

It  is  worth  noting  here  the  difference  between  terms  related  to  an  individual’s  mental  health  and  their  legal 
status.  The  Texas  Health  and  Safety  Code  is  careful  to  point  out  that  receiving  voluntary  services  for  mental 
health treatment will not have any effect on that person’s legal capacity in a civil sense (i.e. guardianship issues, 
the ability to sign legal documents). Civil capacity in voluntary and involuntary mental health treatment must 
also  be  differentiated  from  competency  in  criminal  cases,  which  analyzes  not  whether  a  person  suffers  from 
mental illness, but whether a person is able to consult with a lawyer and understand the charges brought against 
himself or herself. (See Koehler v. State, 830 S.W. 2d 665 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1992, no pet.) for a discussion 
of civil incapacity vs. criminal competency.) See also Tex. Health & Safety Code § 576.002(a), which states: “[t]he 
provision of court-ordered, emergency, or voluntary mental health services to a person is not a determination or 
adjudication of mental incompetency and does not limit the person’s rights as a citizen, or the person’s property 
rights or legal capacity.”

35

3.2.6  Discharge  

 ◦

 ◦

•  Specifically, a person voluntarily admitted to an inpatient mental health facility has the right:

 ◦ To be reviewed periodically to determine the need for continued treatment; and
 ◦ To have an application for court-ordered services (involuntary civil commitment) filed only as provided 

by the requirements of section 572.005. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.003(b).

•  A person must be informed of the rights contained in this section and section 572.004 (Discharge):

 ◦ both orally and  in writing  (in the person’s primary  language,  if possible) within  24  hours after the 

person is admitted Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.003(c)(1); or 

through means necessary to communicate with a hearing or visually impaired person. Tex. Health & 
Safety Code § 572.003(c)(2).

•  Except as noted below, a patient is entitled to leave the facility after the patient signs, times, and dates the 
written request for discharge and files it with the facility administrator. This document must be made part 
of the patient’s clinical record. 

If a  patient  informs an employee of  his or  her wish  to  be discharged,  the employee  must  help  the 
patient  in  creating  the  document  and  present  it  to  the  patient  for  signature  as  soon  as  possible.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.004(a).

•  After the patient files the request for discharge, the facility has four hours to notify the patient’s treating 
physician.  If  that  physician  is  not available during  that  time  period,  the  facility  may  notify any other 
physician. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.004(b).

•  The physician must discharge the patient before the end of the four-hour period unless the physician 
has reasonable cause to believe that the patient might meet the criteria for court-ordered mental health 
services or emergency detention. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.004(c).

• 

If the physician does have reasonable cause, the physician has to examine the patient as soon as possible, 
but no later than 24 hours after the written request for discharge was filed. 

 ◦ After the exam, if the physician determines that the patient does not meet the criteria for court-ordered 

mental health services or emergency detention, the physician shall discharge the patient.

 ◦

If the patient does meet the criteria for court-ordered mental health services or emergency detention, 
the physician has until 4 p.m. on the next business day after the exam to either discharge the patient 
or file an application for court-ordered mental health services or emergency detention and obtain a 
written order for any further detention.

 ◦ The  patient  must  be  notified  if  the  physician  files  an  application  for  court-ordered  mental  health 

services or seeks an emergency detention. 

 ◦ The physician’s decision and the reasons behind it must be made part of the patient’s clinical record. 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.004(d).

• 

• 

In the case of extremely hazardous weather conditions or a disaster, the physician may request the judge 
who has jurisdiction over court-ordered mental health services proceedings to extend the time period 
for which the patient may be detained. There must be a new order from the judge every day, which may 
extend the time period until 4 p.m. on the next business day, and this order must state that an emergency 
exists due to the weather or a disaster. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.004(e).

If  the  patient  files a written withdrawal of  the  request  for discharge  before  the end of  the  proscribed 
period, or an application for court-ordered mental health services or emergency detention is filed, the 
patient cannot leave the facility. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.004(f)(1); (f)(2).

36

•  The facility must prepare a plan for continuing care in accordance with section 574.081 (Continuing Care 
Plan Before Furlough or Discharge) for each patient who is discharged. If there is not time to prepare 
the  plan  before discharge,  the  facility  may  mail  the  plan  to  the  patient within  24  hours of discharge.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.004(g).

•  The facility must notify the patient (or other person who files a request for discharge of a patient) that the 
person filing the request assumes all responsibility for the patient upon discharge. Tex. Health & Safety 
Code § 572.004(h).

Notification of Family Members

Section  576.007  of  the  Texas  Health  and  Safety  Code  addresses  a  concern  that  family  members  often  have 
regarding whether a facility will notify them when their relative is released. By law, the facility is required to notify 
a patient that he or she has a right to have family notified upon discharge. The facility is then required to make a 
reasonable effort to notify the patient’s family if the patient grants permission for such a notification. Tex. Health 
& Safety Code § 576.007.

3.2.7  Application for Court-Ordered Treatment

•  The physician responsible for the patient’s treatment must notify the patient if the physician intends to 
file an application for court-ordered mental health services. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.005(b).

•  An  application  for  court-ordered  mental  health  services  may  not  be  filed  against  a  voluntary  patient 

unless:

 –

 –

 –

 ◦ A request for release has been filed with the facility administrator; or
 ◦

In  the  opinion  of  the  patient’s  treating  physician,  the  patient  meets  the  criteria  for  court-ordered 
services and:

Is absent from the facility without authorization;

Is unable to consent to appropriate and necessary psychiatric treatment; or

Refuses to consent to such treatment as recommended by the treating physician, and said physician 
 
completes a certificate of medical examination (CME) for mental illness that, in addition to the 
information required by section 574.011 (Certificate of Examination for Mental Illness), includes 
the opinion of the physician that:

 ◦ There is no reasonable alternative to the treatment recommended by the physician; and
 ◦ The  patient  will  not  benefit  from  continued  inpatient  care  without  the  recommended  treatment.  

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.005(a)(1); (a)(2).

3.2.8  Transportation of Patient to Another State

•  A court order is required to transport a patient to another state for voluntary inpatient mental health 

services. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.0051.

37

3.3 

Involuntary Commitment (Court Ordered Mental Health Services)

Understanding the Parts of the Commitment Process 

Substantial  confusion  surrounding  the  civil  commitment  process  can  be  avoided  by  being  specific  and  clear 
about the terminology involved. The process can be broken into three distinct parts:

1)  Emergency Detention

2)  Protective Custody

3)  Commitment (Inpatient or Outpatient)

Many people confuse these terms, for example, asking for an Order of Protective Custody when what they really 
want is an emergency detention. By making sure one has a clear understanding of each part of the process and 
what it does, a waste of valuable time and resources can be avoided.35

3.3.1  Emergency Detention
A  detailed  description  of  emergency  detention  procedures  initiated  by  peace  officers,  both  with  and  without 
warrants,  can  be  found  under  Intercept  1,  section  2  of  this  Bench  Book.  This  section  has  a  brief  overview  of 
the emergency detention process but focuses on non-law enforcement persons who may initiate an emergency 
detention.

Least Restrictive Appropriate Setting 

The  Mental  Health  Code  is  clear  to  point  out  that  the  patient’s  right  to  liberty  must  always  be  respected  and 
balanced  against  society’s  interest  in  safety.  This  balance  is  seen  in  section  571.004  of  the  Texas  Health  and 
Safety Code:

The least restrictive appropriate setting for the treatment of a patient is the treatment setting that:

1. 

is available;

2.  provides the patient with the greatest probability of improvement or cure; and

3. 

is no more restrictive of the patient’s physical or social liberties than is necessary to provide the patient 
with  the  most  effective  treatment  and  to  protect  adequately  against  any  danger  the  patient  poses  to 
himself or others.

•  Found  in  sections  573.001 and  573.011 of  the  Texas  Health  and  Safety  Code,  the  emergency  detention 

procedure is the way that the civil commitment process is initiated in most cases.36  

•  Emergency detention is the legal procedure by which a person experiencing a severe mental health crisis 

may be detained for a preliminary examination and crisis stabilization, if appropriate.

•  Emergency  detention  may  be  necessary  and  appropriate  when  a  person  must  be  placed  in  the  least 
restrictive, most appropriate setting, while safeguarding the person’s legal rights to a subsequent judicial 
determination of their need for involuntary mental health services. Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 571.004; 
576.021(a)(1). 

•  The Texas Health and Safety Code permits peace officers to make a warrantless apprehension of a person 
with  mental  illness when appropriate  for  the  purpose  of  transporting  that  person  to  a  mental  health 
treatment facility for evaluation. A legal guardian of the person, if any, may also so transport the person 
to  an  inpatient  treatment  facility.  Persons  other  than  peace  officers  or  a  legal  guardian  must  file  an 
application for emergency detention to seek a magistrate’s warrant for emergency detention.

Rights of Persons during Emergency Detention Procedures

The  purpose  of  emergency  detention  procedures  is  not  “to  punish  a  person  for  acting  with  criminal  intent, 
but to protect individuals from self-inflicted harm and to protect society from harm from others as a result of 
mental illness.”37 Section 573.025 of the Texas  Health and Safety Code codifies the rights of persons involved 
in  the  emergency  detention  process.  These  rights  are  the  same  whether  the  person  is  detained  by  a  peace 
officer, a guardian, or some other person, and whether the detention occurs with or without a warrant. A person 
apprehended, detained, or transported under Chapter 573 has the right:

to be advised of the location and reasons for the detention, and that the detention could result in a longer 
period of involuntary commitment;

to a reasonable opportunity to communicate with and retain an attorney;

to be transported upon release to a location as provided by section 573.024 unless the person is arrested 
or objects;

to be released as provided by section 573.023 if the person does not meet the requirements for admission 
to an inpatient mental health38 facility after the preliminary examination, or if the facility determines that 
the requirements of subsection 573.022(a)(2) no longer apply;

to be advised that any communication with a mental health professional may be used in proceedings for 
further detention;

to be transported in accordance with the requirements of Chapters 573 and 574; and

to a reasonable opportunity to communicate with a relative or other responsible person who has a proper 
interest in the person’s welfare.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.025(a)(1)-(7).

A person must be notified of these rights both orally and in writing (in the person’s primary language, if possible) 
within 24 hours after the person is admitted, or through means necessary to communicate with a hearing or 
visually impaired person. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.025(b)(1); (b)(2).

 3.3.1a Guardian: Transport to a Facility Without a Warrant

•  A guardian may transport an adult ward under their guardianship to an inpatient mental health facility 

for a preliminary examination under the same standard set forth for peace officers. 

 ◦ The guardian must have reason to believe and must believe that:

 –

the ward is a person with mental illness; and

because of that mental illness there is a substantial risk of serious harm to the ward or to others. 

 –
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.003(a).

 ◦ A substantial risk of serious harm must be demonstrated by:

 –

the ward’s behavior; or

evidence of severe emotional distress and deterioration  in  the ward’s  mental condition  to  the 

 –
extent that the ward cannot remain at liberty. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.003(b).

•  A guardian may also transport a ward to an inpatient mental health facility for a preliminary examination 

pursuant to section 1151.051(d) of the Texas Estates Code.

37  Hon. Guy Herman, Mental Health Law 4 (August 2019) (unpublished manuscript, on file with the Judicial Commission on Mental Health). 

38  Note that this language is not in the statute, which less specifically refers to a facility.

• 

If a guardian needs assistance or is unable to bring the ward into a mental health facility, the guardian 
may file an application for an emergency detention under section 573.011 which will result in the issuance 
of a warrant to a peace officer. 

3.3.1b  Any Adult: Application for Emergency Detention Order and Warrant

•  Any adult may file an application for the emergency detention of another person. The application must 

include:

§ 573.011(b). 

§ 573.011(c). 

judge, who: 

 ◦ The contents required for the guardian application (see Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.004); and
 ◦ A detailed description of the applicant’s relationship to the person. Tex. Health & Safety Code  

•  The application may be accompanied by any relevant information. Tex. Health & Safety Code  

•  An applicant for emergency detention must present the application personally to the magistrate or 

 ◦ must examine the application; and
 ◦ may interview the applicant. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.012(a).

When Personal Presentment of an Application is Not Required

Physician. If the applicant is a physician, the magistrate may permit electronic presentation of the application 
following the procedure described in section 573.012(h) of the Texas Health and Safety Code.

Administrative Order. See the discussion relating to the jurisdiction of magistrates in section 3.1.3 above. The 
judge  of  a  court  with  probate  jurisdiction  by  administrative  order  may  provide  that  the  application  must  be 
retained by court staff and presented to another judge or magistrate as soon as practicable if the judge of the 
court  is  not  available  at  the  time  the  application  is  presented.  Tex.  Health  &  Safety  Code  §  573.012(a).  Note 
that  if  there  is  more  than  one  court  with  probate  jurisdiction  in  a  county,  an  administrative  order  regarding 
presentation of an application must be jointly issued by all the judges of those courts. Tex. Health & Safety Code 
§ 573.012(g).

3.3.1c  When the Magistrate Must Issue a Warrant

•  The magistrate must deny the application and refuse to issue a warrant unless the magistrate finds that 

there is reasonable cause to believe that:

the person evidences mental illness;

 ◦
 ◦

 ◦
 ◦

the person evidences a substantial risk of serious harm to self or others as described in section 3.3.1a 
above;

the risk of harm is imminent unless the person is immediately restrained; and

the necessary restraint cannot be accomplished without emergency detention. Tex. Health & Safety 
Code § 573.012(b).

• 

If the magistrate finds reasonable cause, the magistrate must issue a warrant to an on-duty peace officer39 
for  the  person’s  immediate  apprehension,  detention,  and  transportation  to  the  nearest  appropriate 
inpatient mental health facility or a mental health facility deemed suitable by the LMHA, if an appropriate 
inpatient mental health facility is not available for a preliminary examination under section 573.021 of the 
Texas Health and Safety Code. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.012(d). 

39  A 2018 Attorney General Opinion concluded that “a magistrate may direct the emergency detention warrant to any on-duty peace officer listed 
in article 2.12 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, regardless of the apprehended person’s location within the county.” Tex. Att’y Gen. Op. 
KP-0206 at *1 (May 16, 2018) (internal footnote omitted).

40

3.3.1d  The Warrant is the Application for Detention

•  The warrant serves as an application for detention in the facility. The warrant and a copy of the application 
for the warrant shall be immediately transmitted to the facility. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.012(f).

3.3.1e  Temporary Acceptance Required

•  A facility must temporarily accept a person for whom:

 ◦ an application for detention is filed; or
 ◦ an officer or EMS personnel under an MOU provides a notice of detention completed by the officer 

under section 573.002(a) of the Texas Health and Safety Code. 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.021(a).

•  Exception: A person may not be detained in a private mental health facility without the consent of the 

facility administrator. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.021(e).

3.3.1f  Within 12 Hours of Apprehension, a Physician Must Perform a Preliminary Examination
Regardless  of  whether  a  person  was  transported  to  a  facility  with  or  without  a  warrant,  the  person  must  be 
evaluated by at least one physician within 12 hours after the time the person is apprehended by the peace officer or 
transported for emergency detention by the person’s guardian. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.003(18).

3.3.1g  When a Person May be Admitted to a Facility After a Preliminary Exam

•  The person can be admitted to a facility only if the physician who performed the preliminary examination 

makes a written statement that:

is acceptable to the facility;

 ◦
 ◦

states that after a preliminary examination it is the physician’s opinion that:

the person is a person with mental illness;

the person evidences a substantial risk of serious harm to self or others;

the risk of harm is imminent unless the person is immediately restrained; and

emergency  detention  is  the  least  restrictive  means  by  which  the  necessary  restraint  may  be 

a description of the nature of the person’s mental illness;

a specific description of the risk of harm, which may be demonstrated by:

the person’s behavior; or

 ◦
 ◦ evidence of severe emotional distress and deterioration in the person’s mental condition to the extent 

that the person cannot remain at liberty; and

 ◦

the specific detailed information from which the physician formed the opinion.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.022.

Distinguish: CME for Mental Illness

A physician’s “written statement” documenting a preliminary examination under section 573.022 of the Texas 
Health and Safety Code is not a “CME for mental illness” under section 574.011 of the Texas Health and Safety 
Code. The former is required after a preliminary examination is performed for a facility to hold a person under 
emergency detention provided by Chapter 573 (Emergency Detention); the latter must accompany a motion for 
protective custody under Chapter 574 as discussed in section 3.3.2.

• The person must be released on completion of the preliminary examination unless the person is admitted 
to a facility as described in section 3.3.1g above. If the person is admitted, the person must be released if
the facility administrator determines at any time during the emergency detention period that one of the
criteria described above no longer applies. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.022(a), (b).

3.3.1h  Release

3.3.1i  Transport

• After  admission,  the  admitting  facility  may  transport  the  person  to  a  facility  deemed  suitable  by  the
LMHA. At the LHMA’s request, the judge may order that the person be detained in a department mental
health facility (i.e., State Mental Health Hospital). Either the admitting facility or the facility where the
person is detained may transfer the person to an appropriate mental hospital (inpatient mental health
facility) with the written consent of the hospital administrator. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.022(b), (c);
see also Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.045 (detailing more requirements pertaining to transportation
of a patient).

3.3.1j 

 
Within 48 Hours of Initial Detention, the Person Must be Released if No Order of Protective 
Custody Is Obtained

• Unless a written order of protective custody (OPC) is obtained under section 574.022 of the Texas Health
and Safety Code as discussed in section 3.3.2 below, a person accepted for a preliminary examination may 
be detained in custody for no more than 48 hours after the time the person is presented to the facility. That 
includes any time the person spends waiting in the facility for medical care before the person receives the
preliminary examination. Tex. Health and Safety Code § 573.021(b).

•

If the 48-hour period ends on a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or before 4 p.m. on the first succeeding
business day, the person may be detained until 4 p.m. on the first succeeding business day. If the 48-hour
period ends at a different time, the person  may  be detained only until  4 p.m. on the day the  48-hour
period ends. Tex. Health and Safety Code § 573.021(b).

Subsequent Applications for Emergency Detention

As  described  in  section  3.3.1j,  there  are  statutory  limits  on  the  allowable  period  for  an  emergency  detention 
under  subsection  573.021(b)  of  the  Texas  Health  and  Safety  Code.  The  statute  contemplates  that,  if  after  a 
preliminary  examination,  additional  involuntary  inpatient  mental  health  services  are  required,  steps  must  be 
taken to seek and obtain an order of protective custody during the emergency detention period. The legislative 
intent  of  section  573.021  bolsters  the  interpretation  that  a  second  consecutive  emergency  detention  order 
arising out of the same nexus of events would not be authorized. In contrast, however, a subsequent emergency 
detention order following the expiration of the statutory period would be permissible if supported by a new or 
different nexus of events that meet the statutory criteria. Similarly, sequential warrants should not be issued on 
the basis of a single nexus of events.

42

3.3.2  Order of Protective Custody

3.3.2a  Where to File an OPC Motion

• The OPC Motion must be filed in the Court whether the Application for Court Ordered Mental Health

Services is filed. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.021(a).

◦ The Application for Court Ordered Mental Health Services may be filed with the county clerk of any

of the following:

– County where the patient resides;

– County where the patient is found;

–

–

County where the patient is receiving mental health services by court order or under Emergency
 
Detention;

 
County of child’s commitment if proposed patient is in the custody of the Texas Juvenile Justice
Department.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.001(b), (f).

◦

If the application is not filed in the county where the patient resides, the court may, on the request of
the proposed patient or the proposed patient’s attorney, transfer the application to the county where
the proposed resides. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.001(c).

◦ An application may be transferred to the county in which the person is being detained if the county to
which the application is to be transferred approves the transfer. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.001(d).

◦ An  order  transferring  a  criminal  defendant  against  whom  all  charges  have  been  dismissed  to  the
appropriate court for a hearing on court-ordered mental health services under Chapter 46B serves as
the application for court-ordered mental health services. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.001(e).

•

In contrast to an application for emergency detention, which may be presented to any judge or magistrate, 
a motion for OPC may be filed only if an application for court-ordered mental health services has been
filed,  and  only  in  the  court  in  which  the  application  is  pending.  Compare  Tex.  Health  &  Safety  Code
§ 573.021 with Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.008(a). An application for court-ordered mental health
services must be filed in the statutory or constitutional county court that has jurisdiction of a probate
court in mental health proceedings. See Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.021(a).

Hearings, Notice, and Appointment of Attorney

When an Application for Court-Ordered Mental Health Services is filed, the court or its designated magistrate 
becomes obligated to:

appoint an attorney for the proposed patient;

set a probable cause hearing if an OPC has been or will be issued;

set a final hearing on the merits;

1)

2)

3)

4)

serve notice of all pleadings, attorney appointments, and hearings to the proposed patient and his or her
attorney, as well as provide a written list of attorney duties.

These things should be done along with the issuance of an OPC, and the county clerk is responsible for service 
of any notice.40 Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 574.001–574.0006. See section 3.3.6 below. 

40  Hon. Guy Herman, Mental Health Law 7 (August 2019) (unpublished manuscript, on file with the Judicial Commission on Mental Health).

43

3.3.2b  Who May File an OPC Motion

• The motion may be filed by the county or district attorney or on the motion of the court with probate

jurisdiction. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.021(b).

3.3.2c  Contents

• The motion must state that:

◦ The  judge  or  county  or  district  attorney  has  reason  to  believe  and  does  believe  that  the  proposed

patient meets the criteria authorizing the court to order protective custody; and

◦ The belief is derived from:

– The representations of a credible person;

– The proposed patient’s conduct; or

– The circumstances under which the proposed patient is found.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.021(c).

3.3.2d  CME Required

• The motion must be accompanied by a CME for mental illness prepared by a physician who has examined
the proposed patient. The physician must have prepared the CME not earlier than the third day before
the day the motion is filed (in other words, the CME must be very recent). Tex. Health & Safety Code
§§ 574.011; 574.021(d).

3.3.2e  Judge May Appoint a Magistrate

• The judge of the court in which the application is pending may designate a magistrate to issue OPCs.
That  includes a  magistrate appointed  by  the  judge of another court  if  the  magistrate  has at  least  the
qualifications required for a magistrate of the court in which the application is pending.  Tex. Health &
Safety Code § 574.021(e).

3.3.2f  When the Judge or Designated Magistrate May Issue an OPC

•

The judge or designated magistrate may issue an OPC if the judge or magistrate determines:

◦ That a physician has stated the physician’s opinion and the detailed reasons for the physician’s opinion 

that the proposed patient is a person with mental illness; and

◦ The proposed patient presents a substantial risk of serious harm to the proposed patient or others if

not immediately restrained pending the hearing.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.022(a).

•

Substantial risk of serious harm may be demonstrated by the patient’s behavior or by evidence of severe
emotional distress and deterioration in the proposed patient’s mental condition to the extent that the
proposed patient cannot remain at liberty. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.022(b).

• Note: The judge or magistrate may issue an OPC for a proposed patient charged with a criminal offense if:

◦

◦

the proposed patient meets the requirements of section 574.022 of the Texas Health and Safety Code;
and

the facility administrator designated to detain the proposed patient agrees to the detention.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.022(a).

44

Who May Sign an Order of Protective Custody vs. an Order for  
Emergency Detention

While any Texas magistrate can issue an Order for Emergency Detention, a magistrate may only sign an Order 
of Protective Custody if the judge of the court where an Application for Court-Ordered Mental Health Services is 
pending has designated the magistrate to sign such orders. If the magistrate does not have such a designation 
and is not the judge in a court that has original jurisdiction over probate matters, then the magistrate should 
decline to sign any OPCs that are presented.41

3.3.2g  Apprehension Under an OPC

•  An  OPC  shall  direct  a  person  authorized  to  transport  patients  under  section  574.045  to  take  the 
proposed  patient  into  protective  custody  and  transport  the  person  immediately  to  a  mental  health 
facility deemed suitable by the LMHA. On the LMHA’s request, the judge may order that the proposed 
patient  be detained  in an  inpatient  mental  health facility operated  by  HHSC. The proposed patient 
shall be detained in the facility until a probable cause hearing is held under section 574.025 as discussed 
in section 3.3.3 below. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.022.

• 

In many cases, a person for whom an OPC is sought is already in a mental health facility or hospital 
under an Order for Emergency Detention, and the need to transport the person will not arise.

Note: A facility must comply with this section only to the extent that the commissioner of HHSC deter-
mines that the facility has sufficient resources to perform the necessary services. Tex. Health & Safety Code 
§ 574.022(c).

Bed Availability

Some  judges  hesitate  to  sign  an  OPC  until  a  placement  option  for  the  patient  has  been  specifically  identified 
(sometimes referred to as a “bed letter”). This is not required by Chapter 574 and due to the limited capacity 
of inpatient beds statewide, delays caused by such a practice could result in the expiration of the emergency 
detention period with no option to continue to detain a person who has been shown to meet the criteria for 
protective custody.

3.3.3  Within 72 Hours of OPC Detention, Court Must Hold Probable Cause Hearing

•  Not later than 72 hours after the time that the proposed patient was detained under an OPC, the court 

must hold a hearing to determine if:

 ◦

there is probable cause to believe that a proposed patient under an OPC presents a substantial risk of 
serious harm to the proposed patient or others to the extent that the proposed patient cannot be at 
liberty pending the hearing on court-ordered mental health services; and

 ◦ a  physician  has  stated  that  it  is  the  physician’s opinion  that  the  proposed  patient  is a  person with 
mental illness, and has also detailed the reasons for this opinion. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.025.

It is important to note that the purpose of the probable cause hearing is to determine if the patient continues to 
meet the criteria for detention. It is NOT a ratification of the original detention or the OPC itself.

Distinguish the Hearing 

• 

If the 72-hour period ends on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the hearing must be held on the next 
day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.025(b).

41  Id.

45

• The court may postpone the hearing each day for an additional 24 hours if the court declares that an
extreme  emergency  exists  because  of  extremely  hazardous  weather  conditions  or  the  occurrence  of
a  disaster  that  threatens  the  safety  of  the  proposed  patient  or  another  essential  party  to  the  hearing.
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.025(b).

• The proposed patient and the proposed patient’s attorney may appear at the hearing to present evidence
to challenge the allegation that the proposed patient presents a substantial risk of serious harm to himself
or others. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.025(d).

◦

In practice, the patient often waives his or her appearance at the probable cause hearing because the
probable cause standard can be met on the basis of the CME, and this is not typically contested.

◦ Note that some courts allow a proposed patient’s attorney to waive an appearance at the probable cause 

hearing on behalf of their client by the filing of a motion.

• The state  is represented at  the  hearing  by  the county or district attorney, and  the state  may prove  its
case  based  on  the  physician’s  CME  filed  in  support  of  the  initial  motion.  Tex.  Health  &  Safety  Code
§ 574.025(f).

• Certain hearsay testimony that would not be admissible under the Texas Rules of Evidence is admissible
at  this  hearing  although  it  would  not  be  at  the  final  hearing  if  it  was  objected  to.  Examples  of  such
evidence include letters or affidavits. Tex. Health & Safety Code §574.025(e).

•

If the court determines that the above criteria are met, the court may order that the proposed patient
remain in protective custody pending a hearing on an application for court-ordered services. Tex. Health
& Safety Code § 574.026.

3.3.4  Notification of Probable Cause Hearing

• After the probable cause hearing, the court shall arrange for the proposed patient to be returned to the

mental health facility, or other suitable place, along with:

◦ copies of the CME;

◦ any affidavits or other material submitted as evidence in the hearing; and

◦ a notification of probable cause hearing (note that the language of this notification is mandated

by the statute; see page 47 of this Bench Book).

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.026(b), (d).

•

If  a  facility  administrator  where  the  person  is  being  detained  does  not  receive  a  copy  of  the  notice  of
probable cause hearing within 72 hours of the person’s initial detention under an OPC and there is no final
commitment order, the facility must release the person. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.028(c)(1), (2).

◦ Note  that  the  72-  hour  period  does  not  include  Saturdays,  Sundays,  legal  holidays,  or  periods  of
extreme emergencies as codified in subsection 574.025(b). Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.028(c)(1).

• A facility must also release a person under an OPC if at any time the facility determines that the person

no longer meets the criteria for protective custody under section 574.022.

Collaboration is Key

It is essential for local probate courts to collaborate with the LMHA/LBHA and LIDDA to ensure that: 

services are available;

1)

2)

3)

the judge and court personnel know what exactly the local services can and will provide; and

there are no time delays due to questions surrounding bed availability or eligibility for certain services.

3.3.5  Detention in Protective Custody

If  probable  cause  is  found,  a  person  under  the  authority  of  a  protective  custody  order  shall  then  be
detained in a mental health facility deemed suitable by the applicable LHMA until a final order for court-
ordered mental health services is entered or the patient is discharged prior to the hearing because they
no longer meet the criteria for detention. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.027.

If the court does not find probable cause at the hearing, the person must be released, and arrangements
must be made to return the person to:

the location of the person’s apprehension;

the person’s residence in Texas; or

◦ another suitable location.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.028.

3.3.6  Pre-Hearing Proceedings for Court-Ordered Mental Health Services 

3.3.6a  Application for Court-Ordered Mental Health Services

• Any adult can file a sworn, written application for court-ordered mental health services, but only a county
or district attorney can file an application that is not accompanied by a certificate of mental examination.
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.001(a).

• The application must be filed in the county where:

the proposed patient resides;

is found; or

is receiving mental health services by court order or an emergency detention without a warrant.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.001(b).

If the application is filed in a different county than where the proposed patient lives, the proposed patient
or their attorney can request that the application be transferred to the county where the proposed patient 
lives. Tex. Health & Safety Code §574.001(c).

If a person is being detained under an OPC, the application can also be transferred to that county, but
only if the county approves such a transfer. This does not preclude the proposed patient being able to
request a transfer to the county of his or her residence. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.001(d).

If a proposed patient is a criminal defendant and all pending charges have been dismissed, then an order 
transferring the case to an appropriate court for court-ordered mental health services under Chapter 46B
of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure (Incompetency to Stand Trial) will be considered an application
for court-ordered mental health services under section 574.001. This order must state that all criminal
charges have been dismissed. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.001(e).

What Should be Included in the Application

An application must:

be styled using the proposed patient’s initials and not the proposed patient’s full name;

state whether the application is for temporary or extended services;

the proposed patient’s name, address, and county of residence in Texas;

a statement that the proposed patient is a person with mental illness and meets the criteria in Chapter 574
for court-ordered mental health services; and

• whether the proposed patient is charged with a criminal offense.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.002(b), (c).

Application Requirements for Extended vs. Temporary Court-Ordered Services

Applications  for  extended  court-ordered  services  have  several  statutory  requirements  that  applications  for 
temporary court-ordered services do not require. 

•  An application for extended inpatient mental health services must state that the person has received:

court-ordered inpatient mental health services under either this subtitle or Chapter 46B, Subchapter D of 
the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure (Procedures after Determination of Incompetency) or Subchapter 
E (Civil Commitment: Charges Pending) for at least 60 consecutive days during the prior 12 months.

•  An application for extended outpatient mental health services must state that the person has received:

court-ordered  inpatient  mental  health  services  under  either  this  subtitle  OR  under  Chapter  46B, 
Subchapter D or E of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure for a total of at least 60 days during the prior 
12 months; OR

court-ordered outpatient mental health services under this subtitle or Chapter 46B, Subchapters D or E 
during the preceding 60 days.

Tex. Health & Safety Code §574.002(b).

3.3.6b  Appointment and Duties of an Attorney

•  The judge must appoint an attorney for the proposed patient within 24 hours after the application is filed 

unless the proposed patient already has an attorney. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.003(a).

•  Texas codifies the duties that an attorney has toward a client in a court-ordered services proceeding in 
section 574.004, and the court is required to give a copy of these duties to every court-appointed attorney. 
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.003(b).

The Statutory Professional Responsibility of Attorneys in Civil Commitment Cases

The requirements set forth in section 574.004 of the Texas Health and Safety Code were the result of publicity 
surrounding  the  actions  of  some  court-appointed  lawyers  who  were  not  communicating  with  clients  before 
hearings or were conducting group interviews with multiple clients. “The publicity surrounding such inappropriate 
and inadequate representation caused the Legislature to strengthen the rights of patients.”42 

Note  that  the  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  governing  attorneys  comment  specifically  on  the  attention  and 
respect that is to be given to every client, regardless if the client suffers from a mental illness. Comment 5 to Rule 
1.02 of the TDRPC states: “When a lawyer reasonably believes a client suffers a mental disability or is not legally 
competent, it may not be possible to maintain the usual attorney-client relationship. Nevertheless, the client may 
have the ability to understand, deliberate upon, and reach conclusions about some matters affecting the client’s 
own well-being…The fact that a client suffers a disability does not diminish the desirability of treating the client 
with attention and respect.” 

• 

Included  in  the  list of duties owed  by  the attorney  to  the  proposed  patient  is  that  the attorney  must 
respect the client’s decision to agree or resist the efforts to provide mental health services, even though he 
or she may personally disagree with the client’s wishes. Though the attorney may provide counsel, he or 
she must abide by the client’s final decision on the matter. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.004(c).

3.3.6c  Setting the Hearing

• The court  must set a  hearing within  14 days of  the date  the application was  filed  but  may  not  hold a
hearing within the first three days after the application is filed if the proposed patient or the attorney
objects. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.005(a), (b).

◦ There are witnesses that may appear at the hearing to present evidence, which may be unknown to
the parties prior to the hearing date. If either party wishes, they may request a continuance based on
surprise and the court may continue the hearing date. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.006(d).

• While the court may grant continuances for the hearing, the final hearing must be held no more than
30 days from the date the application was filed. The only exception is for extreme weather or disaster, in
which case the judge may by a written order each day postpone the hearing for 24 hours. Tex. Health &
Safety Code § 574.005 (c).

Continuances and CMEs

A court must carefully consider granting a continuance, as doing so may negatively affect the 30-day requirement 
for having two valid CMEs, if there was an OPC filed at the same time an application for commitment was filed, 
and an examination was conducted within the three days allowable prior to filing the OPC. See Tex. Health & 
Safety Code § 574.021(d).

3.3.6d  Notice of Hearing

• The proposed patient and attorney are entitled to receive a copy of the application and written notice of
the court hearing immediately after it is set. Notice must also be delivered in person or via certified mail
to the proposed patient’s:

◦ Parent, if a minor; or

◦ Appointed guardian, if applicable; or

◦ Each managing and possessory conservator, if applicable. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.006(b).

•

If a  parent cannot  be  located, and  the  proposed  patient does  not  have a guardian or conservator,  the
notice may be given to the proposed patient’s next of kin. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.006(c).

Notice and Confidentiality

Upon  request,  any  clerk,  judge,  magistrate,  court  coordinator,  or  other  officer  of  the  court  must  provide  the 
time and place of any hearing as well as the names and addresses of the attorneys for the proposed patient 
and the state to anyone claiming to have evidence to present at the hearing. If this information is provided, the 
above persons are immune from any civil suit resulting from providing such notice. However, these persons are 
not to release ANY other information about the patient or the hearing whatsoever. Tex. Health & Safety Code 
§ 574.006(d).

3.3.6e  Disclosure of Information

•

If the proposed patient’s attorney seeks information that he or she cannot obtain in any other way, he
or she may request that information from the county or district attorney at least 48 hours prior to the
hearing date. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.007(a).

• The county or district attorney is also required to tell the proposed patient’s attorney whether they will
request inpatient or outpatient services no later than 48 hours prior to the hearing UNLESS the proposed
patient and proposed patient’s attorney agree to waive this requirement:

◦ orally and in court; OR

◦

in a sworn, written statement signed by the proposed patient and his or her attorney.
Tex. Health & Safety Code. § 574.007(d).

50

•  The county or district attorney is then required to provide a statement that includes:

 ◦ under which subtitle the state is seeking to establish that the proposed patient requires mental health 

services;

required;

hearing.

the reasons that voluntary outpatient services are not appropriate;

 ◦
 ◦
 ◦ a  brief  description  of  the  reasons  why  the  particular  mental  health  services  being  requested  are 

the name, phone number, and address of each witness who may testify;

 ◦ a list of any acts committed by the proposed patient which the applicant will attempt to prove at the 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.007(b).

•  Note that the judge is able to admit evidence not provided to the proposed patient and his or her attorney 
prior  to  the  hearing  if  the admission would  not deprive  the proposed patient of a  fair opportunity  to 
contest the evidence or testimony. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.007(c).

3.3.6f  Medical Examination Requirement  

•  Prior to the final hearing, two certificates of medical examination must be on file. They must be conducted 
by two different physicians, one of which must be a psychiatrist, if a psychiatrist is available in that county. 
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.009(a).

 ◦ Both of these examinations must have been completed within 30 days of the hearing. Tex. Health & 

Safety Code § 574.009 (a).

• 

• 

If two certificates of medical examination are not filed at the time of the application for court-ordered 
mental health services, then the court may appoint a physician to examine the proposed patient and file 
the certificates. The court can also order the proposed patient to submit to the examinations, in some 
cases issuing a warrant authorizing a peace officer to transport the proposed patient to the examination. 
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.009(b), (c).

If, on the hearing date, the required certificates are not on file, the court must dismiss the application and 
order the immediate release of the proposed patient if he or she is detained. Tex. Health & Safety Code  
§ 574.009(d).  

•  The  court  also  has  the  authority  to  order  an  independent  evaluation  of  the  proposed  patient  by  a 
psychiatrist of  the proposed patient’s choosing  if  the court  feels  it will assist  the  finder of  fact.  If  the 
proposed  patient  is  indigent,  the  county  must  reimburse  the  proposed  patient’s  appointed  attorney 
for any expenses incurred in securing the psychiatrist’s testimony. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.010 
(a), (b).

51

What Should a CME for Mental Illness Include?

1) Name and address of examining physician

2) Name and address of the person examined

3) Date and place of examination

4) Brief diagnosis of the examined person’s physical and mental condition

5)

The time period, if any, the person has been under the physician’s care

6) A description of the mental health treatment the examining physician has given to the person, if any

7)

The examining physician’s opinion that:

A. The examined person is a person with mental illness; and

B. As  a  result  of  that  illness  the  examined  person  is  likely  to  cause  serious  harm  to  the  person  or  to

others or is:

(1) suffering severe and abnormal mental, emotional, or physical distress;

(2) experiencing  substantial  mental  or  physical  deterioration  of  the  proposed  patient’s  ability  to

function independently, exhibited by the inability to provide for basic needs; and

(3) not able to make a rational and informed decision as to whether to submit to treatment.

The examining physician must be as specific and detailed as possible as to what criterion form the basis of the 
opinion, and if it is offered in support of an application for court-ordered services, must state that the person’s 
condition is likely to continue for more than 90 days. If offered in support of an OPC motion, it must include 
the opinion that the person presents a substantial risk of serious harm to himself or others if not immediately 
restrained, and such harm may be demonstrated by the examined person’s behavior or by evidence of severe 
emotional distress and deterioration in the examined person’s mental condition to the extent that the person 
cannot remain at liberty. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.011.

3.3.6g  Recommendation and Responsibility for the Treatment to be Ordered

• Unless the person will be receiving treatment in a private mental health facility, the LMHA in the county
where the application is filed must file a recommendation for the most appropriate treatment alternative
with the court prior to the date of the hearing. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.012(a), (b).

◦ The court cannot hold a hearing without this recommendation on file except in cases of emergency.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.012(d).

◦

If  the  LMHA  recommends  outpatient  treatment,  the  LMHA  must  file  a  statement  regarding
whether  those services are available,  but  this section does  not relieve a county of  its responsibility
under  other  provisions  of  this  subtitle  to  diagnose,  care  for,  or  treat  persons  with  mental  illness.
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.012(c)(d).

• Three days before the hearing, the court must identify the person the court intends to be responsible for

any outpatient treatment that may be ordered. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.0125.

3.3.7  Proceedings for Court-Ordered Mental Health Services
Proceedings for Court-Ordered Mental Health Services are divided into four parts, one for each procedure:

•  Order for Temporary Inpatient Mental Health Services. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.034.
•  Order for Temporary Outpatient Mental Health Services. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.0345.
•  Order for Extended Inpatient Mental Health Services. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.035.

•  Order for Extended Outpatient Mental Health Services. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.0355.

3.3.7a  General Hearing Provisions  

•  The  hearing  may  be  held  anywhere  in  the  county  unless  the  proposed  patient  or  his  or  her  attorney 

request that it be held at the courthouse. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(a), (b).

•  The proposed patient is entitled to be present at the hearing, but the proposed patient or the proposed 

patient’s attorney may waive this right. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(c).

•  The hearing must be open to the public unless the proposed patient or his or her attorney request that it 

be closed and the court finds good cause to do so. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(d).

• 

In a hearing for temporary inpatient or outpatient mental health services, the proposed patient or the 
proposed patient’s attorney may waive the right to cross-examine witnesses by filing a written waiver with 
the court. If that right is waived, the court may admit the CMEs as evidence, the CMEs will constitute 
competent  medical  or  psychiatric  testimony,  and  the  court  can  make  its  findings  based  solely  on  the 
CMEs. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(d-1).

• 

In a hearing for extended inpatient or outpatient mental health services, the court must hear testimony 
and cannot make findings solely on the CMEs. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(d-2). 

•  Unlike the probable cause hearing, the final hearing is governed by the Texas Rules of Evidence unless 

otherwise stated in this subtitle. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(e).

•  The state must prove each element of the applicable criteria by clear and convincing evidence, and the 

hearing must be on the record. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(g).

•  The  court  may  consider  the  testimony  of  a  non-physician  mental  health  professional  in  addition  to 

medical or psychiatric testimony. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(f).

•  The hearing for temporary mental health services must be before the court unless the proposed patient or 
the proposed patient’s attorney requests a jury trial. A hearing for extended mental health services must 
be in front of a jury unless waived by the proposed patient or the attorney. The waiver must be sworn 
and signed unless orally made in the court’s presence. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.032(a), (b), (c). 
The court may allow a jury waiver to be withdrawn for good cause no later than the eighth day before the 
hearing. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.032(d). 

•  A  jury  must determine  if  the  proposed  patient  is a  person with  mental  illness and  meets  the criteria 
for court-ordered services, however, the jury cannot make a finding regarding the type of services to be 
provided. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.032(f).

3.3.7b  Order for Temporary Inpatient Mental Health Services

•  The  judge  may  order  a  proposed  patient  to  receive  court-0rdered  temporary  inpatient  mental  health 

services only if the judge or jury finds, from clear and convincing evidence, that:

the proposed patient is a person with mental illness; and

 ◦
 ◦ as a result of that mental illness the proposed patient:

 –

 –

is likely to cause serious harm to himself;

is likely to cause serious harm to others; or

54

 –

is:

 •

 •

 •

suffering severe and abnormal mental, emotional, or physical distress;

experiencing  substantial  mental  or  physical  deterioration  of  the  proposed  patient’s  ability 
to  function  independently,  which  is  exhibited  by  the  proposed  patient’s  inability,  except 
for reasons of  indigence, to provide  for the proposed patient’s  basic  needs,  including  food, 
clothing, health, or safety; and

unable to make a rational and informed decision as to whether or not to submit to treatment. 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.034(a).

•  The judge or jury must specify which criteria form the basis for the decision, should the judge or jury 
decide the proposed patient meets the commitment criteria. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.034(c).

Orders that Clearly Specify Commitment Criteria

The Code requires that orders for temporary or extended inpatient treatment must specify which criteria the 
judge or jury is basing their decision upon. There has been conflicting caselaw in this area. Some appellate courts 
have allowed an order to submit the criteria in the disjunctive (i.e., listing the criteria with OR), while other courts 
have found that listing the criteria in the conjunctive (with AND) is the only way to ensure that there are specific 
findings.43 

A suggested practice to avoid any confusion is to take the word “or” out of any order for temporary or extended 
inpatient treatment, thus requiring specific findings on any of the criteria listed. 

• 

In order  for the  judge or  jury to  make a  finding on the above requirements  by a clear and convincing 
evidence standard, the evidence must include expert testimony and evidence of a recent overt act44 or a 
continuing pattern of behavior that tends to confirm:

 ◦ The likelihood of serious harm to the proposed patient or others; or
 ◦ The  proposed  patient’s  distress  and  the  proposed  patient’s  deterioration  of  ability  to  function.  

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.034(d).

•  An order for temporary  inpatient services  must  include a treatment period of  not  more than  45 days, 
except that the judge may order 90 days if he or she finds the longer period necessary. Tex. Health & Safety 
Code § 574.034(g).

Note: The “majority of [appellate courts] find that the requirement of ‘overt acts or patterns of behavior’ 
may not be fulfilled merely by citing a patient’s refusal of treatment.45

Person Must Be Released If They Stop Meeting Commitment Criteria

Note  that  a  facility  still  must  release  a  person  if  he  or  she  no  longer  meets  commitment  criteria,  even  if  the 
court-mandated time period has not elapsed. O’Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 574-75 (1975) (“even if his 
involuntary confinement was initially permissible, it could not constitutionally continue after that basis no longer 
existed.”)

43  Id. at 11.

44  Note that the Texas Supreme Court in State v. K.E.W., 315 S.W. 3d 16 (Tex. 2010), clarified the “overt act” requirement. The Court held that the 
act does not have to be actually harmful or demonstrate that harm to others is imminent. The case also states that speech alone may be consid-
ered an overt act. See State v. K.E.W., 315 S.W. 3d 16, 24 (Tex. 2010).

3.3.7c  Order for Temporary Outpatient Mental Health Services

•  The judge may order a proposed patient to receive court-ordered temporary outpatient services only if:

the judge finds that appropriate mental health services are available to the proposed patient; and

the judge or jury finds, from clear and convincing evidence, that:

the proposed patient is a person with severe and persistent mental illness;

as a result of the mental illness, the proposed patient will, if not treated, experience deterioration 
 
of the ability to function independently to the extent that the proposed patient will be unable to 
live safely in the community without court-ordered outpatient mental health services;

outpatient  mental  health  services  are  needed  to  prevent  a  relapse  that  would  likely  result  in 
 
serious harm to the proposed patient or others; and

 
the proposed patient has an inability to participate in outpatient treatment services effectively 
and voluntarily, demonstrated by:

any of the proposed patient’s actions occurring within the two-year period that immediately 
precedes the hearing; or

specific characteristics of the proposed patient’s clinical condition that significantly  impair 
the proposed patient’s ability to make a rational and informed decision whether to submit to 
voluntary outpatient treatment. 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.0345(a).

• 

In order  for the  judge or  jury to  make a  finding on the above requirements  by a clear and convincing 
evidence standard, the evidence must include expert testimony and evidence of a recent overt act or a 
continuing pattern of behavior that tends to confirm the listed requirements. Tex. Health & Safety Code 
§ 574.0345(b).

•  An order  for temporary outpatient  mental  health services  must state that treatment  is authorized  for 
not longer than 45 days, but the judge may specify a period up to 90 days if he or she finds it necessary.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.0345(c).

Open and Frequent Communication Between Courts and LMHAs

In  order  to  maintain  the  most  up-to-date  information  about  the  availability  of  outpatient  civil  commitment 
services, courts should ensure that they are familiar with their LMHA and have a contact person who can provide 
them with what resources are available.

the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure during the preceding 60 days. (However, this finding is 
not required if the proposed patient has already been subject to an order for extended mental 
health services. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.0355(b).

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.0355(a).

• 

In order  for the  judge or  jury to  make a  finding on the above requirements  by a clear and convincing 
evidence standard, the evidence must include expert testimony and evidence of a recent overt act or a 
continuing pattern of behavior that tends to confirm:

 ◦

 ◦

 ◦

the deterioration of the ability to function independently to the extent that the proposed patient will 
be unable to live safely in the community;

the need for outpatient mental health services to prevent a relapse that would likely result in serious 
harm to the proposed patient or others; and

the  proposed  patient’s  inability  to  participate  in  outpatient  treatment  services  effectively  and 
voluntarily. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.0355(c).

•  An order for extended outpatient mental health services must have a treatment period of no longer than 

12 months. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.0355(d).

58

3.3.7f  The Order for Care or Commitment  

•  The judge can hear additional evidence relating to where the patient will receive care, but only after he or 
she has dismissed the jury, if any, once an affirmative commitment finding has been entered. Tex. Health 
& Safety Code § 574.036(a), (b).

•  As  part  of  the  decision  on  the  appropriate  setting  for  care,  the  judge  must  consider  the  LMHA’s 
recommendation, and must order the mental health services provided in the least restrictive appropriate 
setting available. Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 574.036(c), (d); 574.012.

3.3.7g  Court-Ordered Outpatient Services

• 

If, after the commitment hearing, the court orders the patient to receive outpatient services, the court in 
that order must designate a person to provide those services. This person does not have to be the same 
person that the court previously identified under section 574.0125. That person may not be designated by 
the court without consenting, unless the person designated is the administrator of a facility that provides 
such services:

in the region where the committing court is located; or

 ◦
 ◦

in a county where a patient has previously received mental health services. Tex. Health & Safety Code 
§ 574.037(a).

•  The court order must also include a general program for treatment submitted to the court by the facility 

administrator. The program must include:

services to provide care coordination; and

 ◦
 ◦ any other treatment or services, including medication and supported housing, that are available and 
considered clinically  necessary  by a treating physician or the person responsible for the services to 
assist the patient in functioning safely in the community. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.037(b).

• 

If the patient is receiving inpatient services at the time, the person preparing the program should seek 
input from those treatment providers. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.037(b-1).

•  The program must be submitted to the court before any hearing. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.037(b-2). 

•  A patient may petition the court for specific enforcement of the court order. Additionally, the court can 
order  the  patient  to  participate  in  the  program  but cannot compel  performance.  If  the court  receives 
information that a patient is not participating, the court can:

 ◦ Set a modification hearing; and
 ◦

Issue  an  order  for  temporary  detention  if  an  application  is  filed  by  the  person  responsible  for  the 
patient’s court-ordered outpatient treatment. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.037(c-1), (c-2), (c-3). See 
also Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.063. The patient may not be punished for contempt of court. Tex. 
Health & Safety Code § 574.037(c-4).

•  A facility must comply with this section to the extent that the commissioner determines that the designated 
mental health facility has enough resources to perform the services. However, a private mental health 
facility does not have to accept a patient without the consent of the administrator. Tex. Health & Safety 
Code § 574.037(d), (e).

59

3.3.7h  Writs of Commitment  

•  The court shall direct the court clerk to issue to the person authorized to transport the patient two writs of 
commitment requiring the person to take custody of and transport the patient to the designated mental 
health facility. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.046.

Transportation of Patients

The persons responsible for transporting a patient to the designated mental health facility in order of priority 
are as follows: 

1)  Certified Mental Health Officer (This may be a peace officer who is certified under section 1701.404 of the 

Texas Occupations Code.)

2)  Facility Administrator of the designated mental health facility

3)  LMHA representative (must be reimbursed by the county)

4)  Qualified  transportation  service  provider  (this  person  must  be  selected  from  a  list  that  county 

commissioners may establish under section 574.0455 of the Texas Health and Safety Code)

5)  The sheriff or constable

6)  A  relative  or  other  responsible  person  who  has  a  proper  interest  in  the  patient’s  welfare  (this  person 

receives no remuneration for the care of the patient, aside from actual and necessary expenses)

Texas Health & Safety Code § 574.045(a)(1). 

Note that a patient may not be physically restrained unless it is necessary to protect the health and safety of 
the patient or the person traveling with them. Also note that subsection 574.045(b)-(l) lists the requirements of 
transport.

3.3.7i  Transcripts

•  The court clerk must prepare a certified transcript of any proceedings for court-ordered mental health 
services and must send the transcript to the designated mental health facility along with the patient.

 ◦ The  clerk  must  also  send  any  available  information  relating  to  the  patient’s  medical,  social,  and 
economic status and history as well as information related to the patient’s family. Tex. Health & Safety 
Code § 574.047.

3.3.7j  Acknowledgement of Patient Delivery

•  After a facility admits the patient, the facility administrator must:

 ◦ give the person transporting the patient a written statement acknowledging that they received the 

patient and all of patient’s personal property; and

 ◦ must file a copy of that statement with the clerk of the committing court.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.048.

3.3.8  Post-Commitment Proceedings

3.3.8a  Modification of Order for Inpatient Treatment

•  The  facility  administrator  of  the  facility  in  which  a  patient  has  been  committed  for  inpatient  court-
0rdered mental health services must assess the appropriateness of transferring the patient to outpatient 
mental health services no later than the 30th day after the patient is committed to the facility. Tex. Health 
& Safety Code § 574.061(a).

60

•  The  facility  administrator  may  then  recommend  that  the  court  who  entered  the  commitment  order 
modify that order to require the patient to participate in outpatient services. Tex. Health & Safety Code 
§ 574.061(a).

• 

If the administrator recommends transfer, he or she must support the written request with a CME from a 
physician who examined the patient within seven days of the administrator’s request.

•  The patient must be given notice of such a recommendation. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.061(b).

•  On the request of the patient or any other interested person, the court must hold a hearing on the facility 

administrator’s recommendation that the court modify the commitment order. 

 ◦ The patient must be represented by an attorney, and the court must appoint an attorney to represent 

the patient at the hearing.

 ◦ The court must consult with the LMHA before issuing a decision.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.061(d), (e).

•  The hearing must be held before the court, without a jury, and conducted according to section 574.031, 
just  as  a  hearing  for  court-ordered  mental  health  services  is  conducted.  Tex.  Health  &  Safety  Code  
§ 574.061(d).

• 

If no one requests a hearing, the court can make a decision regarding the recommendation based on: 

 the recommendation;

 ◦
 ◦
 ◦ consultation with the LMHA concerning available resources.

the supporting certificate; and

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.061(e).

• 

If the court modifies the order, the court must designate a person to be responsible for the outpatient 
services, and that person must comply with subsection 574.037(b). Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.061 
(f), (g).

•  The court can extend the term of the modified order but cannot exceed the original order by more than 

60 days. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.061(h).

3.3.8b   Modification of Order for Outpatient Treatment

•  On  its  own  motion,  a  request  of  the  person  responsible  for  treatment,  or  a  request  of  any  interested 
person, the court that entered an order directing a patient to participate in outpatient services may hold 
a hearing to determine whether that order should be modified in a substantial way from the treatment 
program in the court’s original order. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.062(a). 

•  The  court  must  give  the  patient  notice  as  set  out  in  section  574.006  and  appoint  an  attorney  for  the 

patient. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.062(b).

•  The hearing must be held before the court, without a jury, and conducted according to section 574.031, 
just  as  a  hearing  for  court-ordered  mental  health  services  is  conducted.  Tex.  Health  &  Safety  Code  
§ 574.062(c).

•  The court must set the hearing no later than seven days after the motion is filed. While the court may 
grant  one  or  more  continuance,  the  hearing  must  be  held  within  14  days.  Tex.  Health  &  Safety  Code  
§ 574.062(d).

•  A hearing may be held outside of the 14-day requirement only in case of extremely hazardous weather 
conditions or disaster. In that case the court, by written order each day that declares such an emergency 
exists, may postpone the hearing for not more than 24 hours. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.062(e).

Temporary Detention Order

•  When  a  modification  of  outpatient  treatment  hearing  under  section  574.062  is  pending,  the  person 
responsible for a patient’s outpatient treatment may file a sworn application for the patient’s temporary 
detention. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.063(a).

•  The application must state the applications opinion and details reasons for that opinion that:

the patient meets the criteria described by subsection 574.064(a-1); and

 ◦
 ◦ detention  in an  inpatient  mental  health facility  is  necessary to evaluate the appropriate setting for 

continued court-ordered services. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.063(b).

• 

• 

If the court finds probable cause to believe that the opinion in the application is valid, the court may issue 
an order for temporary detention if a modification hearing is set. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.063(c). 

If  a  patient  does  not  have  an  attorney  at  the  time  the  order  is  signed,  the  court  must  appoint  one.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code §574.063(d). 

•  Within 24 hours after the detention begins, the court must provide notice to the patient and the attorney 

that states:

the patient has been placed under a temporary detention order;

the grounds for the order; and

the time and place of the modification hearing. 

 

 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.063(e).

Apprehension and Release under a Temporary Detention Order

•  After the court issues a temporary detention order, a peace officer or other designated person must take a 

patient into custody and transport the patient immediately to:

the nearest appropriate inpatient mental health facility; or

if that facility is not available, a mental health facility deemed suitable by the LMHA for the area. 

 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.064(a).

•  Once at the facility, a physician must evaluate the patient as soon as possible, but within 24 hours after 
the time the detention began. The physician must determine whether the patient, due to mental illness, 
presents a substantial risk of serious harm to the patient or others so that the patient cannot be at liberty 
pending the probable cause hearing. Whether the patient presents a substantial risk of serious harm may 
be demonstrated by:

the patient’s behavior; or

 ◦
 ◦ evidence of severe emotional distress and deterioration in the patient’s mental condition to the extent 

that the patient cannot live safely in the community.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.064(a-1).

• 

If the physician who conducted the evaluation determines that the patient does not present a substantial 
risk of serious harm, the facility must:

 ◦ notify the person responsible for providing outpatient services to the patient; and
 ◦ notify the court; and
 ◦
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.064(a-2).

release the patient. 

62

• 

If the physician conducting the evaluation does find that the patient presents a substantial risk of serious 
harm, then the court must hold a probable cause hearing within 72 hours. The patient may not be detained 
until the modification hearing unless the court finds probable cause to believe that:

 ◦

the patient, due to mental illness, presents a substantial risk of serious harm to the patient or others 
using the criteria from subsection 574.064(a-1) to the extent that the patient cannot remain at liberty 
until the modification hearing; and

 ◦ detention  in an  inpatient  mental  health facility  is  necessary to evaluate the appropriate setting for 

continued court-ordered services.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.064(b), (c).

•  A patient remains subject to the original court order for outpatient services if he or she is released by the 
facility under section 574.064, as long as the order has not expired. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.064(e).

Modification Hearing

•  The court can modify the original order for outpatient services if at the modification hearing the court 
finds  the  patient  meets  the criteria  for court-ordered  inpatient services  OR  the court  may decide  not 
to modify the order and the patient will continue in outpatient treatment. Tex. Health & Safety Code  
§ 574.065(a), (b).

• 

If the court decides to modify the order, that decision must be supported by at least one CME signed by 
a physician who examined the patient no more than seven days prior to the hearing. Tex. Health & Safety 
Code § 574.065(c).

•  The court can order a revised treatment program and continue a patient in outpatient services, OR the 
court can commit the patient to an inpatient facility. However, a court cannot extend the time period 
beyond the time in the original order. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.065(d)(e).

3.3.8c  Application for Renewal of Order for Extended Mental Health Services

•  A county or district attorney or other adult may file an application to renew an order for extended mental 

health services. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.066(a).

•  The Application must contain:

 ◦ a  detailed  explanation  why  the  person  requests  renewal  and  why  a  less  restrictive  setting  is  not 

appropriate Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.066(b).

 ◦

two CMEs signed within 30 days preceding the application Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.066(c).

•  The court must appoint an attorney for the patient when the application is filed. Tex. Health & Safety 

Code § 574.066(d).

•  The patient or attorney may request a hearing, or the court may set a hearing on its own motion. If a 
hearing  is set or requested,  the application  for renewal will  be  treated  like an original application  for 
court-ordered extended health services. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.066(e).

•  Whether or not a hearing is set, a court must make findings that the patient meets the criteria for extended 
mental health services under subsections 574.035(a)(1), (2), and (3), and the new order may not extend 
treatment by more than 12 months. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.066(f).

•  The court can admit the CMEs into evidence and make findings based solely upon them and the application 

only if there is no hearing. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.066(g).

• 

If the court renews the order, it can modify the order to provide outpatient mental health services under 
section 574.037. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.066(h).

require an appearance bond if the patient is released.

 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.067(b).

3.3.8f  Request for Reexamination
A  patient  receiving  court-ordered  extended  mental  health  services,  or  any  interested  person  on  the  patient’s 
behalf AND with the patient’s consent, may file a request for reexamination in the county where the patient is 
receiving services. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.068(a), (b).

•  Upon a showing of good cause the court:

 ◦ may require that the patient be reexamined
 ◦ may schedule a hearing
 ◦ may notify the facility

 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.068(c).

A court is not required to order a reexamination if the request is within six months of the original order or another 
request. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.068(d).

• 

• 

If after the examination the facility administrator determines that the patient does not meet the criteria 
for court-ordered mental health services, he or she must immediately discharge the patient. Tex. Health 
& Safety Code § 574.068(f).

If the facility administrator determines the patient does meet the criteria, he or she must file a certificate 
stating as such with the court within 10 days of the request for reexamination. Tex. Health & Safety Code 
§ 574.068(g).

64

Hearing on Request for Examination

• 

If a court requires a patient’s reexamination, the court may set a hearing on the request if not later than 
the 10th day after the date the request is filed:

 ◦ a CME stating that the patient continues to meet the criteria has been filed; or
 ◦ a CME has not been filed and the patient has not been discharged.

 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.069(a).

•  The judge must appoint an attorney for the patient if he or she is not represented and must give notice 

to both of them, along with the facility administrator. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.069(b).

•  The judge must also appoint a physician to examine the patient and file a CME. This physician should be 
a psychiatrist (if one is available in the county) who is not on the staff of the facility where the patient is 
receiving treatment. However, if the patient requests a physician, the court must ensure that the patient 
be examined by the physician the patient chooses (at the patient’s own expense). Tex. Health & Safety 
code §574.069(c). 

• 

If the court finds from clear and convincing evidence that the patient continues to meet the criteria for 
treatment, the court must dismiss the request. If the court does not make such a finding, the court must 
order the facility to discharge the patient. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.069(e), (f). 

3.3.8g  Appeal

•  An appeal must be filed in the county in which the order for court-ordered mental health services was

stay the order and release the patient if he or she does not meet the requirements for protective custody 
under section 574.022; and

Data Collection

The clerk of each court with jurisdiction to order commitment must provide a monthly report to OCA containing 
the number of applications for commitment orders for involuntary mental health services filed with the court 
and  the  dispositions  of  those  cases.  The  dispositions  should  include  the  number  of  commitment  orders  for 
inpatient and outpatient mental health services. OCA will make this data available to HHSC.46 

Note that this collection requirement does not require the court to produce confidential information or court 
records protected by section 571.015 of the Texas Health and Safety Code. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.014 
(a), (b).

3.3.9  Furlough, Discharge, and Termination of Court-Ordered Mental Health Services

3.3.9a  Continuing Care Plan Before Furlough or Discharge
A furlough or pass is when a facility administrator may permit a patient to leave the facility for not more than 
72 hours (pass) or for a longer period as specified by the administrator (furlough). Tex. Health & Safety Code 
§  574.081.  The  administrator  may  attach  certain  conditions  and  must  notify  the  court  if  either  is  granted.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.082.

•  When a patient is scheduled to be furloughed or discharged from services, the physician responsible for 
the patient’s treatment must prepare a continuing care plan, unless the patient does not need continuing 
care. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.081(a).

•  The plan must be prepared according to the rules of HHSC found in the Texas Administrative Code. 25 

Tex. Admin. Code § 412.201.

 ◦ The plan must address the patient’s mental health and physical needs, including, if appropriate the 

need for:

 –

 –

outpatient mental health services; and

sufficient psychoactive medication to last until the patient can see a physician. 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.081(c). 

•  A private  mental  health  facility  is responsible, unless otherwise specified  in the plan,  for providing and 
paying for certain medication until the patient can see a physician, subject to available funding from HHSC, 
and only for up to seven days. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.081(c-1), (c-2). 

• 

 Note that a patient who is to be discharged may refuse the continuing care services. Tex. Health & Safety 
Code § 574.081(f). 

3.3.9b  Discharge

•  When a court order expires, a facility must discharge the patient. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.085.

• 

If at any  time  before  the court order expires  the  facility administrator determines  that  the  patient  no 
longer meets the criteria for court-ordered services, the patient must be discharged. Tex. Health & Safety 
Code § 574.086(a).

 ◦

In this instance, before discharging the patient, the administrator must consider whether the patient 
needs court-ordered outpatient services through (1) a furlough or (2) a modified order under section 
574.061.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.086(b).

•  A facility must file a certificate of discharge with the court. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.087.

3.3.9c  Relief from Firearms Disability

• 

18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(4) makes it a federal crime for anyone who has been civilly committed to possess a 
firearm.

•  A person who is furloughed or discharged from court-ordered mental health services may petition the 
court for an order granting relief from a firearms disability. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.088(a).

•  The court must hear and consider evidence about:

the circumstances that led to the disability;

the person’s mental history;

the person’s criminal history; and

the person’s reputation.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.088(b).

 ◦
 ◦
 ◦
 ◦

 ◦
 ◦

•  The court may not grant relief unless it finds and enters into the record that:

the person is no longer likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety; and

removing the person’s disability to purchase a firearm is in the public interest.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.088(c).

Psychoactive Medication Orders  

3.4 
In  1993,  Texas  first  adopted  procedures  regulating  the  administration  of  psychoactive  medication  following 
litigation  challenging  the  use  of  forced  psychoactive  medication  in  non-emergencies  during  involuntary 
commitments.  Rather  than  cumbersome  guardian  proceedings,  the  Mental  Health  Code  permits  treating 
physicians  to  seek  court  orders  to  allow  the  administration  of  psychoactive  medications  to  persons  who  lack 
capacity to consent to such medication. 

•  These  Mental  Health  Code  provisions  described  below  are  also  relevant  to  the  administration  of 
medication in certain criminal proceedings relating to a defendant’s lack of competency to stand trial 
and are discussed in detail infra at Subchapter 7.2.8.

3.4.1 

 
Administration of Psychoactive Medication to Patient Under Order for Court-Ordered Mental 
Health Services

For the court to order the administration of psychoactive medication,47 the patient must be subject to an order 
for  inpatient  mental  health services  (section  574.106 of  the Texas  Health and  Safety  Code does  not authorize 
a  court  to  order  forced  medication  for  a  person  in  outpatient  services)  or  in  custody  awaiting  trial  and  was 
ordered to receive inpatient mental health services in the six months preceding a hearing for forced medication.48  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.106 (a)(1)-(2).

•  A person may not administer a psychoactive medication to a patient who refuses to take the medication 

voluntarily unless:49

 ◦

the patient is having a medication-related emergency (Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.103 (1));

47  “Psychoactive medication” means a medication prescribed for the treatment of symptoms of psychosis or other severe mental or emotional 
disorders and that is used to exercise an effect on the central nervous system to influence and modify behavior, cognition, or affective state 
when treating the symptoms of mental illness. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.101(3).

48  Judge Herman clarifies in his paper that “inpatient mental health services” are services under section 574.034 or section 574.035 (temporary 
or extended commitment).

49  Hon. Guy Herman, Mental Health Law 20 (August 2019) (unpublished manuscript, on file with the Judicial Commission on Mental Health), 
summarizing sections 576.025 and 574.103 of the Texas Health and Safety Code.

68

 ◦

 ◦

 ◦

 ◦

 ◦

the patient is younger than 16 years of age (or younger than 18 years of age and voluntarily admitted) 
and the patient’s parent, managing conservator, or guardian consents to the administration on behalf 
of the patient (Tex. Health & Safety Code § 576.025 (a)(2));

the patient’s representative authorized by law to consent on behalf of the patient has consented to the 
administration (Tex. Health & Safety Code § 576.025 (a)(3)); 

the  patient  is  under  an  order  issued  under  section  574.106  authorizing  the  administration  of  the 
medication regardless of the patient’s refusal (Tex. Health & Safety Code § 576.025 (a)(4));

the administration of the medication regardless of the patient’s refusal is authorized by an order issued 
under article 46B.086 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure (Tex. Health & Safety Code § 576.025 
(a)(5)); or

the adult patient’s guardian, if any, consents. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.103 (b)(3).

Note:  It  is a common  mistaken  belief  that guardians cannot consent  to psychoactive  medications.  Guardians 
CAN and SHOULD consent as necessary. Guardians can also decide that certain medications are NOT necessary.

•  An application by a physician treating a patient may be filed in a probate court or a court with probate 
jurisdiction or a judge may refer a hearing to a magistrate or court-appointed associate judge who has 
training regarding psychoactive medications. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.106 (c), (d).

Training Regarding Psychoactive Medications

An  identified  area  of  concern  is  that  section  574.106(d)  includes  a  specific  requirement  that  magistrates  or 
associate judges can hear applications of court-ordered mental health services upon referral from the court with 
probate jurisdiction if the magistrate or associate judge has “training regarding psychoactive medications.” It is 
unclear what type of training meets this requirement. Further, it is unclear whether this requirement applies to 
an associate judge appointed under Chapter 54A of the Texas Government Code, or just to one appointed under 
section 574.0085 of the Texas Health and Safety Code.

•  A trial before the court shall be on the record while a trial in front of an associate judge does not need to 

be on the record. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.106 (g), (e).

•  A party is entitled to a trial de novo by a judge if an appeal of the magistrate’s or associate judge’s report 
is filed with the court within three days after the report is issued. Tex. Health & Safety Code 574.106 (e).

• 

• 

3.4.3  Motion to Transfer Hearing for Court-Ordered Psychoactive Medication

If a hearing or an appeal of an associate judge’s or magistrate’s report is to be held in a county court in 
which the judge is not a licensed attorney, the proposed patient or the proposed patient’s attorney may 
request that the proceeding be transferred to a court with a judge who is licensed to practice law in this 
state. The county judge shall transfer the case after receiving the request, and the receiving court shall 
hear the case as if it had been originally filed in that court. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.106 (f).

3.4.3  Motion to Transfer Hearing for Court-Ordered Psychoactive Medication

If a hearing or an appeal of an associate judge’s or magistrate’s report is to be held in a county court in 
which the judge is not a licensed attorney, the proposed patient or the proposed patient’s attorney may 
request that the proceeding be transferred to a court with a judge who is licensed to practice law in this 
state. The county judge shall transfer the case after receiving the request, and the receiving court shall 
hear the case as if it had been originally filed in that court. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.106 (f).

3.4.4  Physician’s Application for Order to Authorize Psychoactive Medication

•  A physician who is treating a patient may, on behalf of the state, file an application in a probate court or a 
court with probate jurisdiction for an order to authorize the administration of a psychoactive medication 
regardless of the patient’s refusal if:

the physician believes that the patient lacks the capacity to make a decision regarding the administration 
of the psychoactive medication;

the physician determines that the medication is the proper course of treatment for the patient;

the patient is under an order for inpatient mental health services under Chapter 574 or other law or 
an application for court-ordered mental health services under section 574.034 or 574.035 of the Texas 
Health and Safety Code has been filed for the patient; and

 the patient, verbally or by other indication, refuses to take the medication voluntarily. 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.104(a).

•  The application must state:

that the physician believes that the patient lacks the capacity to make a decision regarding administration 
of the psychoactive medication and the reasons for that belief;

 ◦ each medication the physician wants the court to compel the patient to take;
 ◦ whether an application for court-ordered mental health services under section 574.034 or 574.035 of 

the Texas Health and Safety Code has been filed;

 ◦ whether a court order for inpatient mental health services for the patient has been issued and under 

what authority;

the physician’s diagnosis of the patient; and

the  proposed  method  for  administering  the  medication  and,  if  the  method  is  not  customary,  an 
explanation justifying the departure from customary methods. 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.104(b).

3.4.5  Timing of the Hearing for Court-ordered Medication

•  The hearing on the application for medication may be held on the date of a hearing for court-ordered 
mental health services under section 574.034 or 574.035 but shall be held not later than 30 days after the 
filing of the application for the order to authorize psychoactive medication. Tex. Health & Safety Code  
§ 574.104(d).

• 

If the hearing is not held on the same day as the application for court-ordered mental health services 
under  section  574.034  or  574.035  and  the  patient  is  transferred  to  a  mental  health  facility  in  another 
county, the court may transfer the application for an order to authorize psychoactive medication to the 
county where the patient has been transferred. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.104(d).

•  Subject to the requirement in subsection 574.104(d) that the hearing shall be held not later than 30 days 
after the filing of the application, the court may grant one continuance on a party’s motion and for good 
cause shown. The court may grant more than one continuance only with the agreement of the parties. 
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.104(e).

3.4.6  The Hearing

•  A  hearing  shall  be  conducted  on  the  record  by  the  probate  judge  or  judge  with  probate  jurisdiction.  

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.106(c).

• 

In proceedings under Chapter 574, judges may use secure electronic means, including satellite transmission, 
closed-circuit TV, or any other method of secure, two-way electronic communication accessible to both 
parties, approved by the court, and capable of visually and audibly recording the proceedings. The patient 

70

and his attorney and the local prosecutor must consent in writing. If requested, the patient must be able 
to communicate privately with his attorney without being heard by the judge or prosecutor. Tex. Health 
& Safety Code § 574.203.

•  A hearing for psychoactive medication may not be held for a patient who receives services under an 

order of protective custody under section 574.021. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.106(k).

• 

If criminal charges are pending, the county in which the charges are pending or were adjudicated must 
pay the costs of a hearing for a patient ordered to receive mental health services. Tex. Health & Safety 
Code § 574.107(b). 

3.4.7  Procedural Rights of Patient and Requirements

•  Under section 574.105 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, a patient for whom an application for an order 

to authorize the administration of a psychoactive medication is filed is entitled to:

representation by a court-appointed attorney who is knowledgeable about issues to be adjudicated at 
the hearing;

 ◦ meet with that attorney as soon as is practicable to prepare for the hearing and to discuss any of the 

patient’s questions or concerns;

receive, immediately after the time of the hearing is set, a copy of the application and written notice of 
the time, place, and date of the hearing;

 ◦ be told, at the time personal notice of the hearing is given, of the patient’s right to a hearing and right 
to the assistance of an attorney to prepare for the hearing and to answer any questions or concerns;

 ◦ be present at the hearing;
 ◦
 ◦ oral notification, at the conclusion of rehearing, of the court’s determinations of the patient’s capacity 

request from the court an independent expert; and

and best interests. 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.105.   

3.4.8  Order Authorizing Psychoactive Medication

•  The court may consider ordering psychoactive medication for only two classes of patients:

those under court order to receive inpatient mental health services; or

those in custody awaiting trial in a criminal proceeding who were ordered to receive inpatient mental 
health services in the six months preceding the current hearing. 

 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.106(a).

•  The  court  may  issue  an  order  authorizing  the  administration  of  one  or  more  classes  of  psychoactive 

medication if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence after the hearing:

that the patient lacks the capacity, as defined in section 574.101(1) of the Texas Health and Safety Code, 
to make a decision regarding the administration of the proposed medication and treatment with the 
proposed medication is in the best interest of the patient; or

if  the  patient  was  ordered  to  receive  inpatient  mental  health  services  by  a  criminal  court  with 
jurisdiction over the patient, that treatment with the proposed medication is in the best interest of the 
patient and either:

 the patient presents a danger to self or others in the inpatient mental facility in which the patient is 
being treated as a result of a mental disorder or mental defect as determined under section 574.1065; or

 ◦

 ◦

 ◦
 ◦

 ◦

 ◦

 ◦

71

 ◦

the patient  has remained confined  in a correctional facility for  more than seventy-two  hours while 
awaiting transfer for competency restoration proceedings and presents a danger to himself or others 
in the correctional facility as a result of a mental disorder or defect. 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.106(a-1).

• 

In making the finding that treatment with the proposed medication is in the patient’s best interest, the 
court must consider: 

the risks and benefits, from the perspective of the patient, of taking psychoactive medication;

the patient’s religious beliefs;

the patient’s expressed preferences regarding treatment with psychoactive medication;

 ◦
 ◦
 ◦
 ◦
 ◦
 ◦ alternative, less intrusive treatments that are likely to produce the same result; and
 ◦

the prognosis for the patient if the patient is treated with psychoactive medication;

 the consequences to the patient if the psychoactive medication is not administered;

less intrusive treatments likely to secure the patient’s agreement to take the psychoactive medication.

  

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.106(b).

•  A  court  may  order  psychoactive  medication  when  a  treatment  facility  or  applicant  believes  a  current 
patient receiving inpatient mental health services is a danger to self or others because of a mental disorder 
or defect. Under section 574.1065, the court must consider the following when deciding whether to order 
psychoactive medication for the potentially dangerous patient:

 ◦ an assessment of the patient’s present mental condition;
 ◦ whether the patient has inflicted, attempted to inflict, or made a serious threat of inflicting substantial 

physical harm to himself or to another while in the facility; and

 ◦ whether the patient, in the six months prior to being placed in the facility, has inflicted, attempted to 
inflict, or threatened to inflict substantial physical harm to another that resulted in the patient being 
placed in the facility. 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.1065.

•  As soon as practicable after the conclusion of the hearing, the patient and patient’s attorney are entitled 
to written notification of the court’s determinations. The notification shall include a statement of the 
evidence on which the court relied and the reasons for the court’s determinations. Tex. Health & Safety 
Code § 574.106(g).

•  An order for psychoactive medication must authorize the administration to a patient, regardless of the 
patient’s refusal, of one or more medications specified in the application and consistent with the patient’s 
diagnosis. The order must also permit an increase or decrease in the medication’s dosage, restitution of 
medication authorized  but discontinued during  the  period  the order  is valid, or  the substitution of a 
medication within the same class. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.106(h).

•  The  classes  of  psychoactive  medications  in  the  order  must  conform  to  classes  determined  by  HHSC.  

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.106(i).

•  Any  party  may  petition  for  reauthorization  or  modification  of  the  order.  The  order  remains  in  effect 
pending action on a petition for reauthorization or modification. (“Modification” means a change of a 
class of medication authorized in the order.) Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.106(j).

•  For patients who are confined in a correctional facility while awaiting transfer for competency restoration 
treatment,  the  court  may  issue  an  order  that  authorizes  initiation  of  any  appropriate  mental  health 
treatment, but the order may not authorize the correctional facility to retain the patient while the patient 
is receiving competency restoration treatment. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.106(L).

72

3.4.9  Appeal
A  patient  may  appeal  an  order.  The  requirements  for  this  appeal  are  the  same  as  for  an  appeal  of  an  order 
requiring court-ordered mental health services under section 574.070 of the Texas Health and Safety Code. An 
order authorizing the administration of medication regardless of the refusal of the patient is effective pending an 
appeal of the order. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.108.

Chapter  574  does  not  provide  the  State  with  the  right  to  appeal  a  denial  of  an  application  for  court-ordered 
medication.  For  persons  who  have  been  adjudicated  incompetent  to  stand  trial  in  a  criminal  case,  however, 
there is a further legal mechanism for the State to seek court-ordered medications. As described in more detail 
infra  at  Subchapter  7.2.8b,  for  certain  defendants  who  have  been  adjudicated  incompetent  to  stand  trial  and 
refuse medications, Article 46B.086 provides a procedure for the consideration of a court order for medications. 
However, before a criminal court can conduct a medication hearing under article 46B.086, there must first be a 
threshold medication proceeding conducted by the court with probate jurisdiction under Chapter 574 (MI) or 
Chapter 592 (IDD) of the Texas Health and Safety Code, as appropriate. If the court with probate jurisdiction 
determines that the defendant does not meet the criteria for court-ordered medication (in sections 574.106 or 
592.156 of the Texas Health and Safety Code), the prosecutor may thereafter seek an order for the administration 
of medication under article 46B.086.50

3.4.10  Effect of Order

•  A person’s consent to take a psychoactive medication is not valid and may not be relied on if the person is 

subject to an order issued under section 574.106 of the Texas Health and Safety Code.

•  The  issuance  of  an  order  under  section  574.106  is  not  a  determination  or  adjudication  of  mental 
incompetency and does not limit in any other respect that person’s rights as a citizen or that person’s 
property rights or legal capacity. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.109(b).

3.4.11  Expiration of Order
With one exception, all orders expire on the same date as expiration of the temporary or extended mental health 
services in effect when the medication is ordered. An order for medication of a person returned to a correctional 
facility and awaiting trial in a criminal proceeding continues to be in effect until the earlier of: 

the 180th day after the defendant returns to the correctional facility;

the date the defendant is acquitted, convicted, or pleads guilty; or

• 

• 

• 

the date all criminal charges are dismissed. 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.110(b).

Admission and Commitment to Intellectual Disability Services

3.5 
Chapter  593  of  the  Texas  Health  and  Safety  Code  governs  the  admission  of  persons  with  an  ID  into  services 
offered by departments of HHSC, Community Centers, voluntary residential care programs, and commitments 
to  residential  care  facilities.  This  chapter  is  part  of  the  “Persons  with  an  Intellectual  Disability  Act,”  which 
encompasses Chapters 591–587 of the Texas Health and Safety Code. 

Emergency admission to a residential care facility, and the receipt of emergency services by a person with an ID 
do not require court involvement. However, there are two areas in which the courts can become involved. The 
first is when there is an application for commitment to a residential care facility, and the second is when a patient 
needs a transfer to a mental hospital for more than 30 days.51  Just as in voluntary and involuntary mental health 
proceedings, an order for an  ID commitment  is  NOT an adjudication of  mental  incompetency. Tex.  Health  & 
Safety Code § 593.054.

3.5.1  Determination of ID

• 

In most cases, an authorized provider must first make a determination that a person has an ID before that 
person will be able to receive services or be admitted to any facility or program. Tex. Health & Safety Code 
§ 593.003.

•  An “authorized provider” in this section is:

 ◦ a physician licensed to practice in Texas;
 ◦ a psychologist licensed to practice in Texas;
 ◦ a professional licensed to practice in Texas and certified by the Department of Aging and Disability 

Services (DADS); or

 ◦ a provider certified by DADS prior to September 1, 2013.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.004(a)(1)–(a)(4).

3.5.2  Emergency Admission without an ID Determination

•  An  emergency  admission  to  a  residential  care  facility  is  permitted  without  a  determination  of  an 

intellectual disability and an interdisciplinary team recommendation if:

 ◦
 ◦
 ◦

 ◦

there is persuasive evidence that the proposed resident is a person with an ID;

space is available at the facility for which placement is requested;

the proposed resident has an urgent need for services that the facility director determines the facility 
provides; and

the facility can provide relief for the urgent need within one year after admission.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.027(a).

•  A determination of an ID and an interdisciplinary team recommendation for the person admitted under 
this section shall be performed within  30 days after the date of admission. Tex.  Health  &  Safety  Code  
§ 593.027(b).

3.5.3  Emergency Services Without an ID Determination

•  A person may receive emergency services without a determination of an ID if:

there is persuasive evidence that the person is a person with an ID;

 ◦
 ◦ emergency services are available; and
 ◦

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.0275(a).

the person has an urgent need for emergency services.

•  A determination of an ID for the person served under this section must be performed within 30 days after 

the date the services begin. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.0275(b).

3.5.4  Respite Care

•  Respite  care  provides  temporary  help  or  relief  to  a  person  with  a  developmental  disability  or  his  or 
her family.  Respite can  be provided for up to  30 days with one  30-day extension.  Respite admission  is 
considered voluntary and requires the consent of the proposed resident, if he or she is capable of giving 
legally adequate consent; the guardian of an adult who cannot give consent; or the parent of a minor.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.028.

3.5.5  Commitment to a Residential Care Facility

•  The following persons may apply for a recommendation that a person is in need of long-term placement 

in a residential care facility:

74

the guardian of the person;

the proposed resident, if an adult;

 ◦
 ◦
 ◦
 ◦ any other interested person, including a community center or agency that conducted a determination 

the court;

of ID for the proposed resident.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.041(a).

•  The  proposed  patient  must  be a  person with an  ID as determined  by an authorized  provider, and an 
interdisciplinary  team  must  have  recommended  the  placement  in  the  six  months  preceding  the 
hearing. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.041(d). If there is not a determination of ID or a report from an 
interdisciplinary team, the court shall order such a determination to be conducted. Tex. Health & Safety 
Code § 593.048(a).

•  The application for commitment of a person to a residential care facility must:

 ◦ Be executed under oath and include:

 –

 –

 –

 
the name, birthdate, address, and sex of the resident and the name and address of the guardian 
or parent, if applicable;

 
a short, plain statement of the facts demonstrating that commitment to a facility is necessary and 
appropriate; and

 
a  short,  plain  statement  explaining  why  the  proposed  patient  cannot  be  admitted  to  a  less 
restrictive alternative.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.042(a). 

•  The court must appoint an attorney for the proposed resident if necessary, and the attorney must be paid 
by the county in which the proceeding is brought. The parent or guardian may also be represented by 
counsel. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.043. 

3.5.5a  Order of Protective Custody

•  While the commitment hearing is pending, a court may order the proposed patient taken into protective 

custody if the court determines from certificates filed with the court that the proposed resident is:

 ◦ believed to be a person with an ID; and
 ◦

likely to cause injury to the proposed resident or others if not immediately restrained.

• 

If the court issues an OPC, the court may order a health or peace officer to take the person into custody 
and transport him or her to:

 ◦ a designated residential care facility that has space available; or
 ◦ a place deemed suitable by the county health authority. 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.044(a), (b).

•  A person may not be detained under an OPC for more than 20 days after custody begins. Tex. Health & 

Safety Code § 593.045(a).

•  A person may not be detained under an OPC in a jail unless an extreme emergency exists and even then, 

not for more than 24 hours. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.045(b). 

•  After 20 days, the facility must release the person if there are no further orders from the court. However, 
if the facility administrator believes the person is a danger to him or herself or others, the administrator 
must notify the court. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.046.

75

3.5.5b  Commitment Hearing

•  The court must set a hearing on the earliest practicable date and must serve notice of the hearing on 
the proposed resident, the proposed resident’s parent or guardian,  if applicable, and the department. 
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.048.

 ◦

If a party requests, or upon motion of the court, the hearing must be in front of a jury. Tex. Health & 
Safety Code § 593.049(a).

 ◦ The hearing must be open to the public unless the judge determines there is good cause for a closed 

hearing. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.050(a). 

 ◦ The proposed resident must be present at the hearing unless the court finds in writing that it would 

cause harm to the proposed resident. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.050(b). 

 ◦ The  Texas  Rules  of  Evidence  apply,  and  the  proposed  resident  may  cross-examine  witnesses. 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.050(c), (d). 

 ◦ The party who filed the application must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that long-term placement 
of  the  proposed  resident  in  a  residential  care  facility  is  appropriate.  Tex.  Health  &  Safety  Code  
§ 593.050(e).

•  Criteria for Order of Commitment

the proposed resident must be a person with an ID;

 ◦
 ◦ evidence must show that because of the ID, the proposed resident:

 –
  or

 –

 ◦

 ◦

represents a substantial risk of physical impairment or injury to the proposed resident or others;  

 
is  unable  to  provide  for  and  is  not  providing  for  the  proposed  resident’s  most  basic  personal 
physical needs;

the  proposed  resident  cannot  be  adequately  and  appropriately  habilitated  in  an  available,  less 
restrictive setting; and

the residential care facility provides habilitative services, care, training, and treatment appropriate to 
the proposed resident’s needs.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.052(a).

Burden of Proof

At least two Texas courts of appeals have found that in order to commit a person for long-term placement in 
a State Supported Living Center, each of the elements in subsection 593.052(a) of the Texas Health and Safety 
Code must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. See Pratt v. State, 907 S.W.2d 38, 44 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1995, 
writ denied); In re A.W., 443 S.W.3d 405, 414 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2014, no pet.).

 3.5.6  Appeal

•  A party to a commitment proceeding has the right to appeal, and the court may grant a stay of commitment 

pending appeal. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.056.

76

3.5.7  Transfer to a Mental Hospital

for mental health care if:

•  A director of a residential care facility may transfer a court-committed resident to a state mental hospital 

• 

the resident  has  been examined  by a physician who  is of the opinion that the resident  has symptoms 
of mental illness to the extent that transfer of the resident for services at the state hospital are in the 
resident’s best interest; and

 ◦

the hospital administrator agrees to the transfer and the director coordinates the transfer.

 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 594.032(a).

•  A resident may not be transferred for more than 30 days without a court order. Tex. Health & Safety Code 

§ 594.032(b).

•  After  the  resident  is  transferred,  the  state  hospital  must  perform  an  evaluation  on  the  resident.  

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 594.033.

• 

If the evaluation reveals that a  hospitalization  for  longer than  30 days  is  necessary, the  hospital  must 
promptly request and order transferring the resident to the hospital from the court originally committing 
the resident. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 594.034(a).

•  The  hospital  must  send  two  CMEs  for  mental  illness  (described  in  §574.011)  along  with  this  request.  

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 594.034(b).

•  A copy of the transfer request and notice of the transfer hearing must be served on the resident, or the 
resident’s parent or guardian, if appropriate, at least 8 days prior to the hearing. Tex. Health & Safety Code 
§ 594.036. 

•  The hearing should be held in a setting that will not adversely affect the resident. Tex. Health & Safety 

Code § 594.037.

•  The hearing must be before a jury unless waived in writing by the resident (or parent or guardian). Even if 
the resident waives a jury, the resident may change his or her mind and request a jury determine the issue 
at any time before a determination is made. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 594.038.

•  Unless the court determines that it is in the resident’s best interest not to be present, the resident must be 

present at the hearing. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 594.039.

•  The  hearing  must  be open to the public unless the court determines that  is  not  in the resident’s  best 

interest. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 594.040.

3.5.7a  Medical Evidence

•  A person may not be transferred to a state mental hospital except on competent psychiatric or medical 

testimony. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 594.041(b).

•  Two physicians, one of whom  must  be a psychiatrist,  must testify at the  hearing, and they  must  have 
examined the resident no more than 15 days prior to the hearing. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 594.041(a).

While the statute does not state the burden of proof for involuntary commitment to a mental health facility, the 
U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that a clear and convincing evidence standard is required in these cases. Addington 
v. Tex., 441 U.S. 418 (1979).

Burden of Proof

77

 3.5.7b Criteria for Court-Ordered Transfer

• 

In order for a court or jury to order a resident transferred to a state mental hospital, the court or jury must 
determine the resident:

is a person with mental illness; and

 ◦
 ◦

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 594.042.

requires a transfer to a state mental hospital for treatment for the resident’s own welfare and protection 
or for the protection of others.

3.5.7c  Return of Court-Ordered Transfer Resident
If a resident who is the subject of a court-ordered transfer no longer requires hospitalization in a state mental 
hospital, the administrator must send a certificate to the committing court stating the resident no longer requires 
hospital  care  but  does  require  residential  facility  care.  The  transfer  can  only  be  made  with  court  approval.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 594.045.

Intercept 1: Initial Contact with Law Enforcement is the gateway to the criminal justice system. Officers have 
considerable discretion in responding to a situation in the community involving a person with a mental illness or 
intellectual disability who may be engaging in criminal conduct, experiencing a mental health crisis, or both. New 
practices and programs are emerging across the state which recognize the gatekeeper role that law enforcement 
plays.

While arrest may be legally permissible, there may be alternatives that would better serve the individual and the 
community. It is important that judges (1) are informed of alternatives to incarceration and (2) encourage the 
provision of training and resources for law enforcement on these issues.

QUICK SECTION OVERVIEW

1. Law Enforcement Must Divert When Appropriate

2. Emergency Detention and Protective Custody of Persons with MI

3. Arrest

Reflection Point

The initial contact with law enforcement is an important discretionary point to examine whether 
race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status are factors in deciding if a person is issued a citation, 
taken into custody, transported to a medical facility, or released on their own recognizance. 

Remember, while an officer may have the authority to arrest, they also may use their discretion on 
a misdemeanor, to issue a citation or to immediately release the individual and issue an arrest warrant later. 
Additionally,  Tex.  Code  Crim.  Proc.  art.  14.035  also  gives  officers  discretion  to  release  individuals  with  IDD  in 
certain situations.

Distinguish: Emergency Detention and Emergency Admission

Note that the emergency detention provisions discussed in this section apply only to persons with MI. Emergency 
admission of persons with ID is discussed in Intercept 0, section 3.5 of this Bench Book.

1. 

Law Enforcement Must Divert When Appropriate

Good-faith Effort Required

1.1 
Every law enforcement agency must make a good-faith effort to divert a person (1) suffering a mental health crisis 
or (2) suffering from the effects of substance abuse, to a proper treatment center in the agency’s jurisdiction. This 
provision applies if:

•  a treatment center is available;

•  diversion is reasonable;

the offense is a non-violent misdemeanor; and

• 

• 

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.23(a).

the mental health or substance abuse issue is suspected to be the reason for the offense. 

Scope of Provision

1.2 
This provision applies to all persons described above except for persons accused of certain intoxication offenses. 
See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.23(b). Note that the statute does not specify when the dictates of this provision 
begin or end.

The statute also does not specify which law enforcement agencies are subject to this provision. Absent a definition 
or limiting language, that term should be given its commonly understood meaning. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 
3.01; see also Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 59.01(5) (“‘Law enforcement agency’ means an agency of the state or an 
agency of a political subdivision of the state authorized by law to employ peace officers.”); Tex. Code Crim. Proc. 
art. 2.12 (defining “peace officer”).

2. 

Emergency Detention and Protective Custody of Persons with MI

2.1  What Is an Emergency Detention?
An  emergency  detention  is  not  an  arrest.  Emergency  detention  is  the  legal  procedure  by  which  a  person 
experiencing a severe mental health crisis may be detained for a preliminary examination and crisis stabilization, 
if appropriate. Law enforcement officers have significant discretion to make a warrantless apprehension for an 
emergency detention if the statutory criteria are met (See Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.001(a)) rather than 
choosing  to  make  an  arrest.  This  is  frequently  referred  to  as  an  “APOWW”  (Apprehension  by  Police  Officer 
Without a Warrant).

Emergency detention  may  be  necessary and appropriate when a person will  not submit to voluntary services. 
The person must be placed in the least restrictive, most appropriate setting, while safeguarding the person’s legal 
rights to a subsequent judicial determination of their need for involuntary mental health services. See Tex. Health 
& Safety Code §§ 571.004, 576.021(a)(1).

I.   Emergency Detention (ED) Under Chapter 573 of the Texas Health and Safety Code 

Overview of Emergency Mental Health Procedures

  A.  Transporting Person to, or Holding Person Currently at, a Facility

1.  Law Enforcement—No Warrant (no initial court involvement required) (“APOWW”)

•  Apprehension: a peace officer believes that the person has MI, and because of the MI, there is a substantial 
risk of serious harm to self or others (demonstrated by behavior or evidence of severe emotional distress 
and deterioration) unless the person is immediately restrained, and there is no time to get a warrant.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.001(a).

•  Notice to Facility: officer must give notice of detention to facility, Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.002; 

without notice, the facility may not detain the person involuntarily. 

•  Notice to Court: only if guardianship exists. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.0021.

2.  Guardian—No Warrant (must notify court)

•  Apprehension: same as law enforcement apprehension but not required to show insufficient time to 

get a warrant. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.003.

•  Notice to Court: immediately to court that granted guardianship. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.002(c).

•  Application: substantial risk of serious harm to self or others; risk of harm is imminent unless the 

person is immediately restrained. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.004(a), (b).

3.  Any adult—Warrant (must apply to court)

•  Application:  [same  as  guardian  application  standard]  +  application  must  be  presented  in  person.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.011(b). Exception: a physician applicant may present the application 
by email or secure electronic transmission. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.011(h).

•  Warrant: reasonable cause to believe that [same as application standard] + the necessary restraint 

cannot be accomplished without ED. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.012.

• 

Important  Note:  any  adult  who  is  not  a  guardian  or  law  enforcement,  such  as  family  members, 
friends, or EMS, must apply for a warrant or obtain an APOWW notice. Without a warrant, a facility has 
no legal right to hold an individual if that individual refuses preliminary examination or treatment.

4.  Facility (must apply to court)

•  Application: [same as guardian application standard] + ED is the least restrictive means by which the 

necessary restraint may be accomplished. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.022(a).

•  Warrant: [same as warrant standard for any adult]

B.  Preliminary Examination at Facility

1.  When it Must Occur

The  exam  must  be  performed  by  a  physician  within  12  hours  after  the  person  is  apprehended  or 
transported by guardian. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.021(c).

(continued next page)

81

(Continued) 

2.  Standard for ED Admission

Preliminary examination must show that person (1) has MI and (2) is a substantial risk of serious and 
 
imminent harm to self or others. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.022(a).

3.  Order of Protective Custody (OPC) Required

The facility has 48 hours from the time of person’s arrival to obtain an OPC. Tex. Health & Safety Code  
 
§ 573.021(b).

4.  Person Must be Released if the Person Does Not Meet the Above Criteria. 

5.  Transportation After Release

 
The person must be returned to the location of apprehension, residence in Texas, or another suitable location. 
This does not apply if person was arrested or objects to transportation. If the person was apprehended by peace 
officer, immediate transport is required; otherwise, it must be reasonably prompt. Tex. Health & Safety Code  

§ 573.024.

• 

• 

II.  Protective Custody and Probable Cause Under HSC Chapter 574

A.  Motion for Protective Custody Order (filed with 574 commitment application)

 
(1) Trial court may issue order for protective custody if the person presents a substantial risk of serious harm 
to self or others if not immediately restrained pending the hearing. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.022 
(a)(2). 

(2)  If  person  is  charged  with  criminal  offense,  facility  administration  must  agree  to  the  detention.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.022(e). 

B.  Probable Cause Hearing to Determine Continued Detention (within 72 hours)

Trial court may order continued detention if it finds probable cause to believe that the person presents a 
substantial risk of serious harm to self or others to the extent that he cannot remain at liberty pending the 
hearing on court-ordered mental health services. [no immediacy requirement] Tex. Health & Safety Code  
§ 574.026(a).

Peace Officer: Transport to a Facility Without a Warrant

2.2 
Law enforcement officers have the opportunity to provide the fastest intervention to begin deescalating a crisis 
and obtain the necessary early information to evaluate, stabilize, and safeguard the individual. Law enforcement 
officers trained in crisis intervention can provide an immediate response with support and access to emergency 
medical services that would be further delayed during the time necessary to obtain a warrant.52

2.2.1  Standard:  A Substantial Risk of Serious Harm
A peace officer may take a person into custody, regardless of the age of the person, without a warrant if the officer 
has reason to believe and does believe that:

• 

the person has MI;

immediately restrained; and

•  because of that MI, there is a substantial risk of serious harm to the person or others unless the person is 

• 

there is insufficient time to obtain a warrant before taking the person into custody. 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.001(a).

82

A substantial risk of serious harm may be demonstrated by:

• 

the person’s behavior; or

that the person cannot remain at liberty.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.001(b).

•  evidence of severe emotional distress and deterioration in the person’s mental condition to the extent 

2.2.2  What May Support an Officer’s Belief
The officer must be able to cite specific recent behavior, overt acts, attempts, or threats in support of his belief. 
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.002(b)(5).

The officer’s belief may be based on:

the representation of a credible person;

the person’s conduct; or

the circumstances under which the person is found. 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.001(c).

Officer’s Personal Observations Not Required

Note that the statute does not require an officer’s personal observations of conduct or behavior suggesting a 
substantial risk of serious harm. An officer’s belief may be based on credible information given to the officer by 
a witness, such as a family member.

2.2.3  An Officer Must Investigate
A peace officer must “investigate the circumstances surrounding a mental health call prior to taking the subject 
into custody and before transporting the subject to a mental health facility.” Trevino v. State, 512 S.W.3d 587, 595 
(Tex. App.—El Paso 2017, no pet.).

Barriers to Communication with an Officer

An  individual  with  a  health  condition  or  disability,  including  mental  illness  or  IDD,  which  may  impede 
effective  communication  with  a  police  officer,  may  voluntarily  indicate  this  information  on  their  Texas 
driver  license,  state  ID,  and/or  vehicle  registration  through  Texas  Department  of  Motor  Vehicles  (TxDMV). 
If  provided,  this  information  would  be  made  available  when  an  officer  runs  a  query  through  TLETS,  thereby 
letting  the  officer  know  of  any  potential  impediments  to  effective  communication  with  the  individual.   
Tex. Transportation Code § 502.061.

2.2.4  Transport to a Facility
An officer must transport the person:

to the nearest appropriate inpatient mental health facility;

if such a facility is unavailable, to another mental health facility53 deemed suitable by the LMHA; or

to  EMS  personnel  in  accordance  with  a  memorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  for  transport  to  an 
appropriate facility as described in section 2.2.5 below.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.001(d).

53  The definition of mental health facility includes “that identifiable part of a general hospital in which diagnosis, treatment, and care for persons 
with mental illness is provided.” Tex. Health & Safety Code § 571.003(12). Pursuant to their obligations under the federal Emergency Medical 
Treatment and Active Labor Act or otherwise, hospital emergency departments often diagnose, treat, and care for persons with mental illness.

The jail must not be used except in an extreme emergency, and the person must be kept separate from inmates 
charged with or convicted of a crime. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.001(e), (f).

2.2.5  Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Regarding Transportation for Emergency Detention
A law enforcement agency and an EMS provider may execute an MOU under which EMS personnel employed 
by  the  provider  may  transport  a  person  taken  into  custody  under  an  emergency  detention  by  a  peace  officer 
employed by the law enforcement agency.  The MOU must:

•  address responsibility for the cost of transporting the person taken into custody; and 

•  be approved by the county in which the law enforcement agency is located and the LMHA that provides 
services in that county with respect to provisions of the MOU that address the responsibility for the cost 
of transporting the person.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.005(b).

2.2.6  Person’s Rights
An officer must immediately inform the person orally in simple, nontechnical terms:

•  of the reason for the detention; and

• 

that a staff member of the facility will inform the person of their rights within 24 hours.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.001(g).

2.2.7  Firearms
An  officer  may  immediately  seize  any  firearms  in  the  person’s  possession.  Tex.  Health  &  Safety  Code  
§ 573.001(h). Note that specific procedures for seizure and return of firearms will vary by jurisdiction.

2.2.8  Notice of Detention to Facility

After taking the person to a facility, the officer must immediately file with the facility a notification of detention 
on  the  statutorily  required  form  (see  page  85  of  this  Bench  Book).  The  facility  must  honor  the  statutorily 
prescribed form and cannot require use of a different form. The facility must include the notice in the person’s 
clinical file. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.002(a), (c).

If emergency medical personnel transport the person at the request of a peace officer, they must immediately file 
with the facility the notification of detention completed by the peace officer who made the request. Tex. Health 
& Safety Code § 573.

3.  Arrest

Reflection Point

Absent a mental health crisis, a law enforcement custodial event is an important discretionary 
point  to  examine  whether  race,  ethnicity,  or  socioeconomic  status  are  factors  in  the  arrest 
decision. Remember, while an officer may have the authority to arrest, they also may use their 
discretion on a misdemeanor, to issue a citation or to immediately release the individual and 
issue an arrest warrant later. Additionally, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 14.035 also gives officers discretion to 
release individuals with IDD in certain situations.

Arrest Is Usually Discretionary

 3.1 
A peace officer may arrest a person who:

•  has committed an offense in the officer’s view (Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 14.01(b));

• 

• 

is found in a suspicious place if the circumstances reasonably show that the person has committed or is 
about to commit certain offenses (Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 14.03(a));

the officer has probable cause to believe has committed certain offenses (Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 14.03(a)); 
or

•  has made an admissible statement to the officer that establishes probable cause to believe that the person 

has committed a felony.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 14.03(a)

In lieu of arresting a person with IDD who lives in a group home or ICF/IID, a peace officer may release him or her 
at the person’s residence if the officer:

•  believes confinement of the person in a correctional facility as defined by section 1.07 of the Texas Penal 

Code is unnecessary to protect the person and the other persons who reside at the residence; and 

•  made reasonable efforts to consult with the staff at the person’s residence and with the person regarding 

the decision.54 

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 14.035.

3.2  When Arrest Is Mandatory
A peace officer must arrest a person whom the officer has probable cause to believe has committed an offense 
under section 25.07 of the Texas Penal Code (Violations of Certain Court Orders or Conditions of Bond) in the 
presence of the officer. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 14.03(b).

Notice to the Magistrate May Be Required

3.3 
If the arresting officer is a sheriff or deputy sheriff and the officer suspects the person has MI or ID, the officer 
must notify the magistrate within 12 hours as discussed in Intercept 2, Part I, section 5.1. of this Bench Book (a 
municipal jailer has the same duty). Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(a)(1).

54  A peace officer and the agency or political subdivision that employs the peace officer may not be held liable for damage to persons or proper-
ty that results from the actions of a person released. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 14.035(c).

Intercept 2: Initial Detention and Court Hearings focuses on initial detention and court hearings. This intercept 
will frequently be the first opportunity for judicial involvement. This includes matters such as intake screening, 
early assessment, and pretrial release of those with mental illness or intellectual disabilities. Identification at this 
stage can facilitate informed decision making around an individual’s care, treatment continuation, and pretrial 
orders. Diversion and data sharing continue to be a focus in this intercept.

88

Part I: Jail

Article 16.22 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure55 details a procedure for identifying a person’s possible MI 
or ID at the earliest stages of—and throughout—a criminal proceeding. Under article 16.22, a magistrate must, 
under certain circumstances discussed below, order an expert to interview the defendant and otherwise collect 
information regarding whether the defendant has a MI or ID in order to alert the necessary stakeholders if the 
resulting report indicates possible MI or ID.

9. Information Sharing is Mandatory

1.  A 16.22 Report 
Since the passage of article 16.22 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure in 1993, much confusion has surrounded 
the question of what a report (before the 2019 legislative change this was called an “assessment”) under article 
16.22 is, particularly in light of other, similar-sounding concepts in mental health and ID law. It is thus helpful to 
consider what a 16.22 report is, and what a 16.22 report is not. 

1.1  What a 16.22 Report Is
A report provided to the  magistrate under article  16.22  is a  limited-purpose tool:  it  is a report of  information 
collected  in  an  interview  regarding  a  person’s  possible  MI  or  ID.  Tex.  Code  Crim.  Proc.  art.  16.22(a)(1).  The 
interview, collection of information, and written report must be performed by a “qualified professional,” which is 
described in section 2 below.

Information the Report Must Include

1.1.1 
The written report must include:

• 

information from any previous interview of the defendant, if applicable;56

•  previously recommended treatment, if applicable;

•  a description of the procedures used in the collection of information; and

55  The 85th Legislature passed two bills in 2017 amending article 16.22, the statute affecting procedures in this intercept (S.B. 1326 and S.B. 
1849), which resulted in substantive changes made by one bill but not the other. The first edition of this Bench Book highlighted the subsequent 
issues related to those changes. However, the 86th Legislature passed H.B. 4170 in 2019, which reenacted article 16.22. This Bench Book reflects 
the current version of the statute.

56  Note, depending on who conducts the interview, there may be records readily available. For example, the sheriff’s office medical staff may 
have records from a previous incarceration or an LHMA may have records if the defendant is a client. Article 16.22 does not require obtaining 
records that other entities may maintain.

89

• 

the provider’s observations and findings regarding:

 ◦ whether the person has MI or ID,
 ◦ whether there is clinical evidence to support a belief that the person may be incompetent and should 

undergo a competency exam under Chapter 46B of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure; and 

 ◦ appropriate or recommended treatment or service (which is key to creating bond conditions under 
article 17.032 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure as discussed in Intercept 2, Part II of this Bench 
Book).

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(a)(1)(A), (b-1).

1.1.2  Form that the Provider Must Use
The written report must be submitted on the form approved by the Texas Correctional Office on Offenders with 
Medical or Mental Impairments (TCOOMMI) entitled “COLLECTION OF INFORMATION FORM FOR MENTAL 
ILLNESS AND INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY.”

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(a)(1)(B). 

TCOOMMI must approve and make generally available in electronic format a standard form for use by a person 
providing a written report under article 16.22(a)(1)(B) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 614.0032. The standard form is available here: https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/
documents/rid/SB_1326.pdf. See also page 91 of this Bench Book.

Ask yourself, as a judge:

Reflection Point

 ➢ Has a previous or current diagnosis of MI or IDD been overlooked? 
 ➢ Are there education or other records that document diagnoses? 
 ➢ Has any party previously sought evaluations for MI or IDD? 
 ➢ Has equity been considered in prior intercept points? 
 ➢ If  not,  could  the  cultural  identity,  profession,  or  background  of  the  person  be  clouding  their 

appropriateness or access to services for MI or IDD?

 ➢ Has trauma affected this person’s ability to access services in any system, including education 

 ➢ How have I challenged any assumptions I might have made based on cultural identity, profession, 

or the LMHA? 

or background? 

 ➢ Is my jurisdiction gathering data on whether people who identify as BIPOC are assessed 
and/or  diagnosed  with  a  MI  or  IDD  at  higher  rates  than  people  who  do  not  identify  as 
BIPOC?

1.1.3  16.22 Reports Are Required
16.22 reports are critical to proper case management. Early identification can affect case management in a variety 
of ways over the course of a criminal proceeding, including but not limited to the following:

•  bail decisions;

•  appointment of counsel;

and services);

•  charging decisions;

•  early involvement of local health provider (e.g., crisis stabilization, provision or continuation of treatment 

•  diversion of the person from the criminal justice system;

•  flagging potential incompetency issues or initiating incompetency proceedings;

• 

initiation of civil-commitment proceedings (with or without dismissing charges);

•  consideration during punishment or as a basis for imposing treatment conditions as part of community 

supervision; and

•  creating a record for future use and information sharing.

1.1.4  16.22 Reports Are Confidential
A written report submitted to a magistrate under article 16.22(a)(1)(B) is confidential and not subject to disclosure 
under  Chapter  522 of  the  Texas  Government  Code  but  may  be  used or disclosed as  provided  by article  16.22.  
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(f).

1.2  What a 16.22 Report Is Not
A  16.22  report  is  not  a  diagnosis  of  MI  or  ID  and  neither  the  interview  nor  the  report  need  to  be  completed 
by a licensed medical or mental health professional. This is a common misconception and one that may make 
magistrates hesitant to order a 16.22 interview. See Intercept 2, Part I, section 2 of this Bench Book for information 
on  who  may  perform  an  interview.    Further,  a  magistrate  does  not  need  evidence  that  the  person  has  been 
previously diagnosed with MI or ID before the magistrate may order a 16.22 interview.

1.2.1  A 16.22 Interview Is NOT a Full Competency Evaluation
A  16.22  interview  should  not  be confused with  forensic evaluations  in  Chapters  46B  (Incompetency  to  Stand 
Trial)57 and 46C (Insanity Defense) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.

The type of evaluation that is most frequently confused with a 16.22 interview is a competency examination under 
Chapter  46B of the Texas  Code of  Criminal  Procedure.  Under  Chapter  46B, a person  is  incompetent to stand 
trial if the person does not have (1) sufficient present ability to consult with the person’s lawyer with a reasonable 
degree of rational understanding; or (2) a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against the 
person. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 46B.003(a).

A 16.22 interview may flag the need for a full competency evaluation under Chapter 46B: “If evidence suggesting 
the defendant may be incompetent to stand trial comes to the attention of the court, the court on its own motion 
shall suggest that the defendant may be incompetent to stand trial.” Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 46B.004(b).28.58 
However,  the  court  may  have  reasonable  cause  to  believe  that  a  person  has  MI  or  ID  but  not  have  evidence 
suggesting that the person may be incompetent to stand trial.

57  See Intercept 3, section 7 of this Bench Book for procedures related to competency under Chapter 46B of the Texas Code of Criminal Proce-
dure.

58  Note that a competency examination may not be performed until the case is filed with the trial court. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.004.

94

A Person Can Have MI or ID and Still be Competent Under Chapter 46B

It is important to understand that a magistrate may receive information that may not suggest that a person is 
incompetent to stand trial under Chapter 46B of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, but that may suggest 
that the person has a MI or ID. Such a condition may not render the person incompetent to stand trial, but it may 
warrant special consideration and management of the person’s criminal case.

1.2.2  A 16.22 Interview Is NOT the Mandatory Jail Screening
A 16.22 interview is not an “approved mental disabilities/suicide prevention screening instrument” under Texas 
Administrative Code, Title 37, Part 9, Chapter 273, section 273.5, which must be completed by a jail employee for 
all inmates immediately upon intake as discussed in Intercept 2, Part I, section 5.1.3 of this Bench Book. 

1.2.3  A 16.22 Interview Is NOT a Full Clinical Assessment
A 16.22 interview is not an assessment under Texas Administrative Code, Title 25, Part I, Chapter 441, Subchapter 
A, section 441.101, which contemplates a more rigorous and ongoing clinical evaluation for purposes of developing 
a treatment plan and measuring progress.

2. 

 
Who May Perform a 16.22 Interview and Collection of 
Information

Article 16.22 Requirements

2.1 
The statute provides that the interview and collection of information must be performed by:

the service provider that contracts with the jail to provide mental health or IDD services,

• 

• 

• 

the LMHA,

the LIDDA, or

•  another qualified mental health or IDD expert. 

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(a)(1).

2.2 

 
Article  16.22  Does  Not  Define  “Another  Qualified  Mental  Health  or  Intellectual  and 
Developmental Disability Expert”

Article 16.22 does not define “another qualified mental health or intellectual and developmental disability expert” 
either expressly or by reference or incorporation. Definitions of other similar terms may offer guidance but note 
that they are not expressly incorporated into article 16.22. A discussion of those terms follows.

2.2.1  QMHP-CS

•  25  Texas  Administrative  Code  section  412.303 defines  “QMHP-CS” as a  person who works or  provides 

services for a LMHA/LBHA or provider as an employee, contractor, intern, or volunteer, who:

• 

is credentialed as a QMHP-CS;

•  has demonstrated and documented competency in the work to be performed; and

 ◦ has  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  psychology,  social  work,  medicine,  nursing,  rehabilitation,  counseling, 
sociology,  human  growth  and  development,  physician  assistant,  gerontology,  special  education, 
educational psychology, early childhood education, or early childhood intervention;

is a registered nurse; or

 ◦
 ◦ completes an alternative credentialing process as determined by the LMHA or MCO.

25 Tex. Admin. Code § 412.303.

95

2.2.2  Non-physician Mental Health Professional
Section 571.003(15) of the Texas Health and Safety Code defines “non-physician mental health professional” as a 
licensed professional.  Examples include:

•  psychologist,

• 

registered nurse,

•  clinical social worker,

• 

licensed professional counselor, or

•  physician assistant who has expertise in psychiatry or is working in a mental health facility.

Tex. Health & Safety Code 571.003(15).

Legislative Change

H.B. 2093 (87th Reg. Sess. (2021)) amends Section 571.003(15) of the Health and Safety Code to 
expand  the  definition  of  “non-physician  mental  health  professional”  to  include  a  physician 
assistant licensed to practice in this state who has expertise in psychiatry or is currently working 
in a mental health facility. 

This expansion will increase the number of individuals who are permitted to conduct mental health evaluations, 
which could increase efficiency in the intake and pre-hearing processes. 

 2.2.3  Qualified Intellectual Disability Professional
Title  25,  section  416.78(18)  of  the  Texas  Administrative  Code  adopts  the  definition  of  a  qualified  intellectual 
disability professional in 42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) section 483.430(a). The CFR defines a “qualified 
intellectual disability professional” as one who:

•  has  at  least  one  year  of  experience  working  directly  with  persons  with  ID  or  other  developmental 

disabilities; and

• 

is one of the following:

 ◦ a doctor of medicine or osteopathy; 
 ◦ a registered nurse or 
 ◦ an individual who holds at least a bachelor’s degree described in CFR 483.430(b)(5). 

42 CFR § 483.430.

“Qualified Professional”

2.3 
For simplicity, this Bench Book uses the term “qualified professional” to describe a person who may perform an 
interview under article 16.22.

Not an “Expert” as that Term Is Typically Used

The letter and spirit of article 16.22 suggest that the person who performs a 16.22 interview need not qualify as 
an “expert” as that term is used in other contexts, such as article 46B.022 (Competency Evaluation) or 46C.102 
(Insanity  Evaluation)  of  the  Texas  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure,  or  under  the  Texas  Rules  of  Evidence  and 
interpreting case law.

96

3.  Where May a 16.22 Interview be Performed

Location

3.1 
A 16.22 interview may be conducted in person in the jail, by telephone, or through a telemedicine medical service 
or telehealth service. 

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(a-4).

4. 

The Standard for Ordering a 16.22 Interview

Reasonable Cause

4.1 
The  magistrate  must  determine  whether  there  is  reasonable  cause  to  believe  that  the  person  has  MI  or  ID. 
Magistrates might consider requesting the TCJS mandatory jail screening form if it was not included with the 
16.22 notice. See Tex. Health & Safety Code 614.017(a)(2) (requiring disclosure of such information for purposes 
of continuity of care and services). Note again that a specific diagnosis is not required. See Bench Cards at the 
end of Intercept 2, Part I of this Bench Book for information on observations that indicate a defendant may have 
a MI or ID.

If Reasonable Cause Is NOT found, a 16.22 Interview Is Not Required

4.1.1 
If the magistrate determines that there is not reasonable cause, the magistrate is not required to order an interview. 
But note that jail conditions frequently trigger decompensation of mental health conditions, so additional 16.22 
interviews may be necessary over time.

Substance Use

Be aware that, because many persons with MI also use substances, the need for an interview may not come 
to  light  until  the  person  is  sober  or  has  detoxed.  Each  county  jail’s  health  service  plan  should  include  a 
detoxification protocol for supporting withdrawal from alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines, and other commonly 
used substances, in conformance with current national standards.59

If Reasonable Cause Is Found, a 16.22 Interview Is Required

4.1.2 
If the magistrate determines that there is reasonable cause, the magistrate must order a qualified professional to 
(1) interview the defendant and otherwise collect information regarding whether the person has MI or ID and (2) 
provide to the magistrate a written report of the interview and other information collected on the TCOOMMI-
approved form. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(a)(1).   

Exception  1:    If  reasonable  cause  is  found,  a  magistrate  need  not  order  an  interview  and  collection  of  other 
information if the defendant in the year preceding the defendant’s applicable date of arrest has been determined 
to have a MI or to be a person with an ID by the service provider that contracts with the jail to provide mental 
health or IDD services, the LMHA, the LIDDA, or another qualified mental health or IDD expert.

In the event of an exception, the magistrate may proceed with the results of the prior interview captured in the 
previous  written  report.  Tex.  Code  Crim.  Pro.  Art.  16.22(a)(2).  A  magistrate,  however,  is  not  prohibited  from 
ordering a new interview and collection of information.

Exception 2: The magistrate is not required to order the interview under 16.22 if the defendant is no longer in 
custody.  Tex.  Code  Crim.  Pro.  Art.  16.22(a)(2).  A  magistrate,  however,  is  not  prohibited  from  ordering  a  new 
interview and collection of information.

(November 2016).

97

Legislative Change

S.B. 49 (87th Reg. Sess. (2021)) amended article 16.22 to no longer require that a magistrate order a 
16.22 if the defendant is not in custody. A magistrate, however, is not prohibited from ordering an 
interview and collection of information.

Article 16.22 Does Not Limit When the Magistrate May Order an Interview

Because the statute does not expressly limit when the magistrate may order an interview, article 16.22 suggests 
that the magistrate may determine whether to order an interview at any time—during magistration, arraignment, 
or any other time the magistrate receives credible information suggesting MI or ID. This is important to note, 
because jail conditions and the stress of criminal proceedings may cause a person to decompensate over time 
and demonstrate signs of MI that were not initially present.

5.  Who Pays for an Interview and Collection of Information
If a magistrate orders a LMHA, LIDDA, or another qualified mental health or IDD expert to conduct an interview 
or collect information under article 16.22(a)(1), the commissioners court for the county in which the magistrate is 
located must reimburse the respective authority or expert for the cost of performing those duties. Tex. Code Crim. 
Proc. art. 16.22(a-1).

The amount of reimbursement depends on whether the commissioners court adopts a fee schedule authorized in 
article 16.22(a-2). If so, it must consider the generally accepted reasonable cost in that county of performing the 
duties described by article 16.22(a)(1). The fee schedule must also be adopted in a public hearing and periodically 
reviewed by the commissioners court.

• 

• 

• 

If  the  commissioners  court  adopts  a  fee  schedule  described  by  article  16.22(a-2),  the  amount  of 
reimbursement is dictated by that fee schedule.

If  the  cost  of  performing  the  duties  described  by  article(a)(1)  exceeds  the  amount  provided  by  the 
applicable fee schedule, the authority or expert who performed the duties may request that the judge who 
has jurisdiction over the underlying offense determine the reasonable amount for which the authority or 
expert is entitled to be reimbursed. That amount must be determined no later than the 45th day after the 
date of the request and may not be less than the amount provided by the fee schedule.

If the commissioners court has not adopted a fee schedule, the authority or expert may request that the judge 
who has jurisdiction over the underlying offense determine the reasonable amount of reimbursement. 
Such determination must be made no later than the 45th day after the date of the request.

Tex. Code Crim. Pro. Art. 16.22(a-1), (a-2), (a-3).

Note: This reimbursement is distinct from the reimbursement required under article 16.22(a)(1)(B)(3).

6. 

 
Types of Information that Can Prompt a Magistrate to Order  
a 16.22 Interview

Notice from Sheriff or Jailer of Possible MI or ID

6.1 
For defendants held on Class B misdemeanors or higher,60 sheriffs and municipal jailers must provide written 
or electronic notice of credible information that may establish reasonable cause to believe that a defendant is a 
person with MI or ID. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(a)(1).

6.1.1  The Notice Must Include
The notice must include any information related to the sheriff’s or jailer’s determination, such as:

• 

• 

information regarding the defendant’s  behavior  immediately  before, during, and after the defendant’s 
arrest; and

the results of any previous assessment, if applicable (note that the statute still uses the term “assessment” 
in this subsection but could refer to a previous 16.22 interview and collection of information).

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(a)(1). 

The sheriff or jailer may include with the notice other documents containing related information, such as the 
TCJS-mandated screening form discussed at section 6.1.3 below.

6.1.2  Deadline for Providing Notice
The sheriff or jailer must provide notice to the magistrate within 12 hours of receiving the credible information. 
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(a)(1).

Duration of Article 16.22 Sheriff/Jailer Notice Requirement

Article 16.22 does not specify the duration of this notice requirement. Rather, it states broadly that the sheriff 
or jailer must provide notice within 12 hours when “the sheriff or municipal jailer [has] custody of a defendant 
for an offense punishable as a Class B misdemeanor or any higher category of offense . . . .” In the absence of 
an express limitation, the requirement should be read as extending beyond booking and magistration so that 
a sheriff or jailer must provide notice anytime he or she receives credible information under this provision. See 
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(a)(1). This includes decompensation while in custody.

6.1.3  Possible Sources of “Credible Information”

6.1.3a  Mandatory Screening of Inmates for Suicide and MI and ID
The  Texas  Commission  on  Jail  Standards  (TCJS)  requires  that  the  TCJS-approved  mental  disabilities/suicide 
prevention  screening  instrument  must  be  completed  immediately  for  all  inmates  admitted  (see  page  102  of 
this Bench Book). That screening is part of a mental disabilities/suicide prevention plan that all sheriffs and 
operators must develop and implement to address various statutorily enumerated principles and procedures.61 
See 37 Tex. Admin. Code § 273.5.

60  The 85th Texas Legislature passed two bills in 2017 amending article 16.22. S.B. 1326 modified subsection (a)(1) by (1) adding municipal jailers 
and (2) limiting the notice requirement to defendants held on Class B misdemeanors and higher. S.B. 1849 (the Sandra Bland Act) made no such 
limitation on the notice requirement. There was disagreement among magistrates regarding whether these bills could be harmonized, and if so, 
how. See Tex. Gov’t Code § 311.025(b). However, the 86th Texas Legislature passed H.B. 4170 in 2019, which reenacted article 16.22 for purposes 
of Section 43, Article III of the Texas Constitution. As reenacted, the notice requirement in article 16.22(a)(1) is limited to defendants in custody for 
an offense punishable as a Class B misdemeanor or higher. Note that nothing expressly prohibits an interview of persons charged with Class C 
misdemeanors. Indeed, some jurisdictions such as Burnet County include defendants with such charges in their agreement with the LMHA.

61  The owner/operator of each facility must also provide medical, mental, and dental services in accordance with the approved health ser-
vicesplan, which may include, but may not be limited to, the services of a licensed physician, professional and allied health personnel, hospital, 
orsimilar services. 37 Tex. Admin. Code § 273.1. Screening form can also be found here: https://mmhpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/New-

intellectual and developmental disabilities62

H.B. 3116 was passed during the 86th Legislative Session and became effective on September 1, 2019. The law 
required a comprehensive study of standards for the detention of individuals with intellectual and developmental 
disabilities. In response to the passage of H.B. 3116 the Texas Commission on Jail Standards (TCJS) appointed a 
taskforce which focused on 5 key areas: 

Current policies and procedures.

Barriers to accommodation and justice.

Best practices used in other states.

Policies that would improve jail standards.

Any other issue that the task force found to be appropriate.

After consideration of these 5 areas the task force submitted a report which included their analysis and findings, 
as well as recommendations to provide superlative care for those incarcerated who are diagnosed with IDD by 
ensuring that the organizations charged with their care have the resources and knowledge to do so. The report 
contains their results in regard to data collection, existing resources and programs, national approaches, and 
desired outcomes. This study is a valuable resource that explains the relationships between law enforcement, 
LMHAs and other community service providers in assisting individuals with IDD who are confined in Texas jails.

Recommendations include:

1. Collect  accurate  data,  using  systems  already  in  place  and  mandated  in  county  jails,  of  the  number  of

individuals incarcerated who may have an IDD diagnosis.

Study the feasibility of providing local law enforcement access to relevant information, to include CCQ,
for the purpose of diverting individuals into proper treatment instead of jail.

Instruct the Texas Commission on Jail Standards to create a TCOLE certified course on how to utilize the
Intake Screening Form. The course should be available for both in person and virtual instruction.

4. Continue to support the TCOLE certified Master Mental Health Jailer Training Program presented by the

Correctional Management Institute of Texas at Sam Houston State University.

5.

Ensure  that  all  TCOLE  certified  training  identified  as  possessing  a  Mental  Health  or  Behavioral  Health
component are updated regularly to reflect current best practices.

Legislative Change

On  the  heels  of  the  study  (left)  for  persons  being  housed  in  the  Texas  Jails  with  IDD,  Texas 
passed H.B. 2831 (87th Reg. Sess. (2021)), which amended Government Code chapter 511 to 
establish an advisory committee to advise the Texas Commission on Jail Standards (TCJS). The 
committee consists of 13 members appointed by officers of TCJS and make recommendations 
regarding  the  confinement of  individuals  with  intellectual  or  developmental  disabilities.  The 
committee is to include representatives from various state agencies, county sheriff departments, statewide 
mental health and IDD organizations, and state law enforcement agencies. Tex. Gov’t Code § 511.022. 

The  advisory  committee  will  gather  and  review  data  regarding  the  confinement in  county  jails  of  individuals 
with intellectual or developmental disabilities, and then use that data to make recommendations and guidelines 
to  county  sheriffs and  other  officials. The  advisory  committee  will  also  focus  on  the  intake  of  individuals  with 
intellectual  or  developmental  disabilities  and  help  with  periodic  updates  to  the  jails’  intake  forms.   Tex. 
Gov’t  Code § 511.023.

H.B.  2831  also  amends  the  Occupations  Code,  adding  a  section  that  mandates  the  creation  of  a  training 
program  for  county  jail  administration  and  staff  to  teach  techniques  to  identify  individuals  with  intellectual  or 
developmental  disabilities.  The  training  program  must  consist  of  at  least  4  hours  of  substantive  training.  Tex. 
Occupations Code § 1701.269.

6.1.3b  Mandatory Continuity of Care Query (CCQ)
With limited exceptions, every jail is required to conduct a CCQ check on each inmate upon intake into the jail.63 
The CCQ is originated through the Department of Public Safety’s Texas Law Enforcement Telecommunications 
System, which initiates a data exchange with the HHSC’s Clinical Management for Behavioral Health Services 
system to determine if the inmate has previously received state mental healthcare. 37 Tex. Admin. Code § 273.5.

TLETS CCQ Now Includes LIDDA and SSLC Services

As  of  August  14,  2020,  a  TLETS  CCQ  (Texas  Law  Enforcement  Telecommunications  System  Continuity  of  Care 
Query) will now reflect whether a person has received LIDDA or SSLC services in the last three years.64 In addition 
to providing information to support ordering a 16.22 interview, TLETS CCQ process provides a system to identify 
inmates with a history of receiving intellectual disability services.65 

Since  the  IDD  information  has  only  recently  been  incorporated,  the  system  continues  to  be  monitored  and 
updated to ensure accuracy. As previously done, if a person is suspected of having ID, or states that they are 
or have received services, but that information is not in the TLETS CCQ system, contact the LIDDA to determine 
whether the person has received or is receiving services. These additional contacts may be able to recommend 
appropriate treatment of the person and help to develop a case

management plan.

‐

6.1.3c  Mandatory Prescription Review
TCJS  requires  that  a  qualified  medical  professional  review  as  soon  as  possible  any  prescription  medication  a 
prisoner is taking when the prisoner is taken into custody. Tex. Gov’t Code § 511.009(d); 37 Tex. Admin. Code Ch. 
273.2(12).

Continuing Medication is Critical to Continuity of Care

Continuing a person’s prescription medication is critical to preventing mental health deterioration. Intake officials 
should consult the person, family members, LMHA/LBHA, or a prior provider regarding current medications. Not 
all medications may be available in jail due to costs, availability, and concerns regarding possible abuse.

Jails generally do not accept prescriptions provided by family members. However, it is not uncommon for family 
members to communicate mental health diagnoses with the jail, magistrate, or bond offices. This information 
may be considered, and the magistrate should order an interview (or check for prior interviews) if the information 
is credible.

63  Municipal jails that are operated by the local government do not have access to the CCQ because DPS cannot grant access to jails that do not 
operate under TCJS (note that jail standards do apply to privately operated municipal jails but not to municipal jails operated by the local govern-
ment). As a result, magistrates at some municipal jails do not know whether an inmate has previously received state mental healthcare unless 
that information comes from the inmate, defense counsel, or another source.

64  The 86th Texas Legislature provided rider funding to HHSC to incorporate IDD service history into the CCQ system. Texas Commission on Jail 
Standards, Detention of Persons with IDD Comprehensive Study 14, https://www.tcjs.state.tx.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Detention_of_Per-

Legislative Change

S.B.  49  (87th  Reg.  Sess.  (2021))  ,  effective  September  1,  2021,  amended  Tex.  Gov’t  Code  
§ 511.009(d) and now requires that not only must a qualified medical professional review as 
soon as possible any prescription medication a prisoner is taking when the prisoner is taken 
into custody, but also that a prisoner with a mental illness be provided with each prescription 
medication  that  a  qualified  medical  professional  or  mental  health  professional  determines  

is necessary for the care, treatment, or stabilization of the prisoner.

The  2021  legislation  expanded  upon  requirements  from  2017’s  Sandra  Bland  Act  that  inmates  be  able 
to  access  a  mental  health  professional  at  the  jail  or  through  a  telemental  health  service  24  hours  a  day.  
Tex. Gov’t Code § 511.009(a)(19)(A).

6.2 

Notice from Another Source

If the magistrate receives written or electronic notice of credible information that may establish reasonable cause 
to believe that a person brought before the magistrate has MI or ID, the magistrate must conduct proceedings 
under article 16.22 or bond proceedings under article 17.032, as appropriate. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 15.17(a-1).

6.3  When the Magistrate Observes Behavior Suggesting MI or ID
Although not expressly provided in the statute, the spirit of the statutory scheme suggests that the magistrate 
should order an interview upon the magistrate’s own observations of behavior that establishes reasonable cause 
to believe that a person has MI or ID, such as during magistration,66 a probable cause hearing, or arraignment.

7.  When a Defendant Refuses to Submit to an Interview
If the defendant fails or refuses to submit to the interview and collection of other information as required under 
article 16.22(a)(1), the magistrate may order the person to submit to an examination in a jail or in another place 
determined to be appropriate by the LMHA or LIDDA for a reasonable period not to exceed 72 hours.67  Tex. Code 
Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(a)(3). 

When a Person Refuses to be Interviewed

Some example strategies for obtaining an interview and collection of other information from an unwilling person 
include:

• 

requesting the appropriate personnel to contact the person to discuss noncompliance, such as the:

LMHA, LIDDA, other mental health or ID provider,

 ◦
 ◦
 ◦

case manager, or

peace officer;

•  ordering the person to appear in court to discuss noncompliance; or 

•  ordering an emergency detention under Chapter 573 of the Texas Health and Safety Code as described in 

Intercept 1, section 2 of this Bench Book, if appropriate.

66  “Magistration” is not a statutorily defined term but is a term that is widely used in the criminal justice system. It refers to the event in which 
the magistrate performs the duties set forth in article 15.17 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure after the arrest of an individual. It is also 
referred to as an “initial appearance” and “15.17 warnings.” Magistration is not an arraignment. An arraignment occurs when formal charges are 
read to the defendant and the defendant enters a plea.

67  The LMHA or LIDDA is entitled to reimbursement from the county for mileage and per diem expenses for transporting the defendant.  
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(a)(3).

104

8.  What to Do with the Written Report

8.1 

The Magistrate

8.1.1  When the Qualified Professional Must Submit the Report to the Magistrate
Unless  good  cause  is  shown,  once  the  magistrate  orders  the  interview  and  collection  of  other  information, 
the qualified professional must submit a written report of an interview and other information collected to the 
magistrate:

•  within 96 hours if the person is in jail; or

•  within 30 days if the person has been released from custody; 

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(b).

8.1.2  The Magistrate Must Send Copies
Regardless of whether the interview and collection of information indicate MI or ID, the magistrate must send 
copies of the written report to the: 

1.  defense counsel; 

2.  prosecutor;

3. 

the trial court with jurisdiction;68 

in jail; and 

5.  as applicable:

confined; or

4.  the sheriff or other person responsible for the defendant’s medical records while the defendant is confined 

A.  any personal bond office established under article 17.42 for a county in which the defendant is being 

B.  the director of the office or department that is responsible for supervising the defendant while the 
defendant is released on bail and receiving mental health or IDD services as a condition of bail.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(b-1).

Note: Effective September 1, 2019, upon receipt of the written report from the magistrate, the trial court may, 
among other things, if the offense charged does not involve an act, attempt, or threat of serious bodily injury to 
another person, release the defendant on bail while charges against the defendant remain pending and enter an 
order transferring the defendant to the appropriate court  for court-ordered outpatient  mental  health services 
under Chapter 574 of the Texas Health and Safety Code. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(c)(5). 

68  If the case has not been filed when the magistrate receives the written report, the magistrate must hold the report and send a copy to the trial 
court once the case is filed. However, magistrates often do not receive notice when the case is filed, which makes this requirement a challenge. 
A related issue is that magistrates who are municipal judges without authority to appoint attorneys are likely unable to meet the requirement to 
provide a copy to defense counsel.

105

Legislative Change

S.B. 49 (87th Reg. Sess. (2021)), effective September 1, 2021, amended article 16.22(b-1) requiring 
the magistrate to send the written report to additional individuals. The additional individuals that 
must be sent the report, above and beyond the defense, state, and court, now include:

the sheriff or other person responsible for the defendant’s medical records while the defendant is confined
in jail; and

 — any personal bond office established under article 17.42 for a county in which the defendant is being

 — the  director  of  the  office  or  department  that  is  responsible  for  supervising  the  defendant  while  the 

defendant is released on bail and receiving mental health or IDD services as a condition of bail.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(b-1).

confined; or 

Multiple Interviews May Be Necessary

Depending on an inmate’s behavior, multiple orders for an interview and collection of other information may be 
necessary over the course of a criminal case. Consider leaving a copy of the written report in the person’s inmate file, 
along with the TCJS mandatory inmate screening form. See 37 Tex. Admin. Code § 273.4 (governing maintenance 
of inmate health records). Note that nothing expressly prohibits the trial court from ordering additional interviews, 
if appropriate.

Reporting the Number of Written Reports to OCA

8.2 
In  2019,  the  Legislature  tasked  the  Texas  Judicial  Council with adopting  rules  to  require  the  reporting of  the 
number of written reports provided to a court under article 16.22.69 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(e). Prior law 
required the magistrate to submit to OCA the number of written reports provided to a court. Because magistrates 
had no formal mechanism of reporting to OCA, legislation was needed. 

Until the Texas Judicial Council adopts new rules, the magistrate should send the report to the custodian of the 
district or county court records—the district clerk or county clerk—for inclusion in the defendant’s case file. The 
number of written reports will be captured from district and county courts on Judicial Council Monthly District 
and County Court Activity Reports, submitted by district clerks and county clerks.  

Please note that OCA requires only the 16.22 written report (as of the writing of this Bench Book, the form uses 
the old term “assessment”) and NOT the mandatory TCJS jail screening form (see page 102 of this Bench Book). 

69  H.B. 601, 86th Reg. Sess. (2019). Note that article 16.22(e) requires reporting of the number of written reports “provided to a court under 
subsection (a)(1)(B).” That provision requires an expert to provide a written report of the interview to the magistrate. Article 16.22(b-1) requires 
the magistrate to provide copies of the written report to the trial court. Find the OCA Reporting website here: https://www.txcourts.gov/report-
ing-to-oca/. 

106

Other Considerations

Promptly appoint counsel. Consider appointing counsel with specialized MI or ID legal training.

ordered services. Release the defendant on bail while charges against the defendant remain pending 
Court
and  enter  an  order  transferring  the  defendant  to  the  appropriate  court  for  court-ordered  outpatient  mental 
health services under Chapter 574 of the Texas Health and Safety Code (if the offense charged does not involve 
an act, attempt, or threat of serious bodily injury to another person). Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(c)(5).

‐

Note that the only instance in which a criminal court has jurisdiction to order civil commitment is following an 
incompetency determination under Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Chapter 46B, Subchapter E (see Intercept 
3, section 7 of this Bench Book). Otherwise, only a court with probate jurisdiction may order commitment (see 
Intercept 0, section 3 of this Bench Book). See also Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.008(a); Tex. Code Crim. Proc. 
arts. 46B.101

103.

‐

Keep a record of the written report. Ensure that a copy of the written report is kept in a sealed court file for 
potential future use and for purposes of OCA reporting (see article 16.22(f) for confidentiality of written reports 
submitted to a magistrate).

Information Sharing Is Mandatory

9. 

9.1 

 
Considerable confusion has surrounded the issue of sharing personal health information in 
proceedings involving persons who may have MI or ID. This subsection identifies some of the 
key state-law provisions governing that issue.

Information Regarding Special Needs Offenders

9.2 
State  law requires  that agencies share  information  for purposes of continuity of care and services  for  “special 
needs offenders,” which includes individuals:

• 

for whom criminal charges are pending; or

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 614.017(a), (c)(2).

•  who, after conviction or adjudication, are in custody or under any form of criminal justice supervision.

16.22 Report Goes in The Pen Packet to TDCJ

Texas Code of Criminal Procedure article 42.09 requires a written report provided to a court under Article 16.22(a)
(1)(B) to accompany a defendant transferred by a county to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) in 
the  pen  packet.  In  addition,  a  copy  of  any  mental  health  records,  mental  health  screening  reports,  or  similar 
information must be delivered to TDCJ as well.

9.3  What an Agency Is Required to Do
Specifically, an agency must:

•  accept information relating to a special needs offender or a juvenile with a mental impairment that is sent 
to the agency to serve the purposes of continuity of care and services regardless of whether other 
state law makes that information confidential; and 

•  disclose information relating to a special needs offender or a juvenile with a mental impairment, including 
information about the offender’s or juvenile’s identity; needs; treatment; social, criminal, and vocational 
history;  supervision  status  and  compliance  with  conditions  of  supervision;  and  medical  and  mental 
health history, if the disclosure serves the purposes of continuity of care and services.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 614.017(a).

107

Agencies Must Safeguard Confidentiality

9.4 
An agency must manage confidential information accepted or disclosed under this section prudently to maintain, 
to the extent possible, the confidentiality of that information. A person commits an offense if the person releases 
or discloses confidential information obtained under section 614.017 for purposes other than continuity of care 
and services, except as authorized by other law or by the consent of the person to whom the information relates. 
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 614.017(d), (e).

Not for Use as Evidence

9.5 
Information obtained under this section  may  not  be used as evidence  in any  juvenile or criminal proceeding, 
unless obtained and introduced by other lawful evidentiary means. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 614.017(b).

Agencies Required to Comply

9.6 
An “agency” includes any of the following, a person with an agency relationship with one of the following, and a 
person who contracts with one or more of the following:

providing real-time, contemporaneous identification of individuals in the Department of State Health 
Services client data base; and

• 

the Department of Family and Protective Services.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 614.017(c)(1).

Exempt from the Texas Medical Records Privacy Act (TMRPA)

9.7 
TMRPA, the state law governing privacy of medical records, expressly excludes an agency described by section 
614.017  (set  forth  above)  with  respect  to  the  disclosure,  receipt,  transfer,  or  exchange  of  medical  and  health 
information  and  records  relating  to  individuals  in  the  custody  of  an  agency  or  in  community  supervision.70   
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 181.057.

Communicating with Individuals with an  
Intellectual and/or Developmental Disability (IDD)71

“If you’ve met one person with a disability, you’ve met one person with a disability.”

Communicating with an individual with an intellectual and/or developmental disability (IDD) is just 
like communicating with anyone else.  Know that everyone communicates differently and comprehends 
in their own way. 

•  Address the individual directly.  Treat persons who are adults as adults.  Show individuals with IDD the 
same respect you would any other client.  Do not patronize or condescend when communicating with the 
person.  Address the individual before speaking to their companion or supporter.  

•  Consider how the individual communicates AND receives communication.  Understanding how a 
person with IDD communicates and how they receive communication is top priority.  Do they use spoken 
language?  Do they use a communication device?  Do they use sign-language?  Do they use a combination 
of these?  Consider body language and movement.  Behavior is also communication.  

 

 
When communicating in writing, ensure that a screen reader can be used.  (Note: a scanned document 
cannot be read by a screen reader.)  If an individual cannot read, ensure that you or someone they trust, 
such as a supporter in a Supported Decision-Making Agreement, is able to explain the document to the 
individual.  

•  Be patient.  It may take the person extra time to understand the conversation, comprehend questions, 
and respond.  Do not predict responses, speak for the person, or complete the person’s sentences, because 
often people with IDD “people please” in an effort to gain approval.

•  Use simple  language or  language that  is universally understood  by people of all ages.    Use concrete 
language instead of abstract language.  For example, instead of “How do you feel?,” use specific adjectives 
and ask if the person is happy, sad, upset, angry, etc.  Remember to ask one question at a time and allow 
extra time for processing.  If the topic is complicated, break it into smaller, understandable sections.  

•  Adjust your method of communication as necessary and be prepared to repeat yourself more than once 
in various ways.  You can use visual cues such as gestures, diagrams, or demonstrations.  Consider reframing 
sentences or topics in a variety of ways so an individual has multiple opportunities to comprehend.  

•  Ask  for clarification.    Some  individuals’ communication styles  may  be  hard  to understand.    Do  not 
pretend  to  understand  if you do  not.    Ask  the  person  to  repeat  themselves.    Be  patient,  flexible, and 
supportive.  If they have a friend or supporter with them, ask the individual if their friend or supporter 
can assist. Do not wholly rely on the friend or support.

•  Clear explanations or questions. Be sure to phrase questions without suggesting desired or preferred 

responses, as some individuals may tell you what they think you want to hear.

Things to remember:

• 

It is not uncommon for a person with IDD to pretend to know or understand more than they do to gain 
approval or acceptance. 

•  Some individuals with IDD cannot read, count money, or tell time.

•  Some individuals with IDD may be more likely to “people please” and may agree with anything that is said 

to or asked of them.

Individuals may have difficulty with:

• 

social interactions; 

•  verbal or nonverbal communications;

• 

sensory processing;

•  cognitive processing, including rules, regulations, expectations;

social behaviors (i.e. interactions & cues); and 

• 

• 

following directions (Note: this is not defiance, they just may not be able to easily follow directions).

Part II: Bail 

In  1993,  the  Texas  Legislature  added  articles  16.22  and  17.032  to  the  Texas  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  to 
encourage diversion of defendants from jail and into mental health treatment when appropriate.72  Analysis of 
the  original  bill  noted  that,  at  that  time,  “Texas  Law  ha[d]  no  codified  procedure  allowing  the  transfer  of 
suspected mentally ill . . . defendants who are in jail. These individuals await[ed] trial without the benefit of any 
treatment.” The bill analysis also stated that this creates “a grave injustice.”73 

Article 17.032 provides courts an opportunity to pursue Policy Statement #11 from The Criminal Justice/Mental 
Health Consensus Project of the Council of State Governments: Maximize the use of pretrial release options in 
appropriate cases of defendants with mental illness so that no person is detained pretrial solely for the lack of 
information or option to address the person’s mental illness.74 

In 2021, the Texas Legislature enacted additional limitations on the release of certain defendants on personal bond 
who  are  facing  certain  violent  charges,  effective  December  2,  2021  (S.B.  6;  87th  Leg.,  2d  C.S.  (2021)).  These 
limitations will be addressed below.

list of offenses is different than the list of offenses in article 42A.054 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure (formerly known as the “3g 
offenses”). Note that this list is also different from article 17.03, amended by S.B. 6, 87th Leg., 2d C.S. (2021). See Legislative update and

Bond Terminology 

“Personal Recognizance Bond.” The Texas Code of Criminal Procedure defines a “personal bond” as a 
bail bond with no sureties. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 17.04. Texas courts have recognized that although 
“personal recognizance bond” is a  commonly  used  term,  the relevant statutes use the  term “personal 
bond.” Ex parte Castellano, 321 S.W.3d 760, 765 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2010, no pet.) (citing Tex. Code 
Crim. Proc. arts. 17.03, .031, .032, .04); see also Lee v. State, 641 S.W.2d 533, 534 n.1 (Tex. Crim. App. 1982) 
(“There is no form of bail known as a ‘personal recognizance bond’ in Texas criminal practice.”). 

“Mental  Health Bond.”  Note that personal bonds under article 17.032 of the  Texas Code of Criminal 
Procedure are commonly referred to as “mental health bonds.” 

Reflection Point 

Practitioners  should  examine  the  socioeconomic  factors  that  influence  release,  bond 
amount,  diversions, and  alternatives to detention.  For example, people with  substantial 
financial resources may be able to pay for electronic leg monitoring (ELM) devices or have 
access to a car.  It is important not to mistake poverty for noncompliance. 

 

 

 

 

77 A magistrate may not release on personal bond a defendant who, at the time of the commission of the charged offense, is civilly 
committed as a sexually violent predator under Chapter 841 of the Texas Health and Safety Code. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 17.03(b-1). 

78 See Intercept 2, Part I, section 2 of this Bench Book for an explanation of “qualified professional.” 

79 Although article 17.032(b)(3)(A) refers to a person who is “nonetheless competent to stand trial,” that language, when read together 
with article 16.22, does not require a finding of competency after a full evaluation under Chapter 46B. Rather, that phrase likely refers to 
the requirement in article 16.22(b‐1)(2) that the qualified professional determine “whether there is clinical evidence to support a belief 
that the defendant may be incompetent to stand trial and should undergo a complete competency examination under Subchapter B, 
Chapter 46B.” Presumably, the “competent to stand trial” requirement in article 17.032 simply means that the qualified professional 
found no such evidence to support a belief of incompetency.  

 

117 

Legislative Change 

S.B. 6 (87th Leg., 2d C.S. (2021)), effective December 2, 2021, amended article 17.03 by 
adding  in  subsections  (b-2)  and  (b-3).  These  changes  added  more  offenses  for  which 
personal bond is disallowed.   

While S.B. 6 did not repeal CCP 17.032, the list of “violent offenses” for which an individual is not 
eligible for personal bond now differs between 17.03 and 17.032. Per the Code Construction Act, we 
should do our best to harmonize the statutes. In this case, we need to harmonize new subsection 
17.03(b-2)(1) and the list of “violent offenses” in new subsection (b-3)(2), with the list of “violent 
offenses” in 17.032(a). A chart comparing the two statutes’ lists of violent offenses is shown below. 
Please note that the list is not necessarily in the order set out in the statute, for ease of comparison. 
Offenses present in 17.03 but not in 17.032 are highlighted.

Legislative Change 

S.B. 49 (87th Reg. Sess. (2021)), effective September 1, 2021, amended article 17.04, by 
adding section (b), which removes the requirement that certain individuals with MI or 
ID “swear under oath” that they will appear in court as part of their release on personal 
bond.  

This oath is waived as the qualifying individuals, which include a defendant 1) who a magistrate has 
determined, using 16.22, has mental illness or is a person with ID, 2) released under 17.032, or 3) has 
been found incompetent to stand trial under 46B. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 17.04(b). 

The inclusion of the oath and promise to appear is inherently problematic for individuals released on 
bond with treatment conditions or competency restoration requirements; due to their mental illness 
or  intellectual  disability  they  might  not  comprehend  the  significance  of  their  oath  yet  previously 
could have faced a contempt charge for failing to appear. 

1.2  What the Magistrate Must before Releasing on Personal Bond 

The magistrate must consider: 

•  all the circumstances; 
•  a pretrial risk assessment, if applicable; and 
•  any other credible information provided by defense counsel or the prosecutor.  

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 17.032(b)(5). 

1.3  When All of the Above Requirements Are Not Met, Ordinary Bail Provisions Apply 

Ask yourself, as a judge: 

Reflection Point 

➢  Has equity been considered in prior intercept points?   

➢  Has release or evaluation by a mental health provider been overlooked by the 

arresting officer or jail staff?   

➢  What assumptions have I made about the cultural identity, genders, profession, 

and background of this person and their family?   

➢  Have I made assumptions about who is present in the courtroom, overlooking 
transportation or other concerns in favor of shortcuts and assumptions about 
whether the person will return to court if released?   

➢  How  might  my  assumptions  (or  the  assumptions  of  those  involved  at  prior 

intercept points) influence my decision-making? 

2.  Setting and Enforcing Bond Conditions 

2.1  When the Magistrate Must Order Treatment as a Condition of Bond 

Unless good cause is shown, if the above criteria are met for setting a personal bond under article 17.032 of the 
Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the magistrate must require inpatient80 or outpatient treatment or services81 

 

80 Note that requiring inpatient treatment or services as a condition of bond may not be practicable unless the person is committed. 
State hospitals might not take voluntary patients because of the shortage of beds. 

81 When outpatient mental health treatment is ordered as a condition of bond, it is not a commitment. In Tarrant County, the LMHA will 
make referrals to programs or set up an appointment at one of the MHMR clinics for the defendant. Once there is a plan and the 
magistrate knows the defendant will be accepted into the program or clinic they have been referred to, the magistrate will give the 

119 

 

 

as a condition of bond as recommended by the qualified professional if:  

the person’s MI or ID is chronic; or  

the person’s ability to function independently will continue to deteriorate if the person does not receive 
the recommended treatment or services. 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 17.032(c). 

2.2 

Other Conditions That May Be Imposed 

The magistrate may impose other conditions to ensure: 

the person’s appearance; and  

the safety of the victim and the community.  

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 17.032(d). 

 

 

 

Some examples of strategies for enforcing bond conditions include: 

Enforcing Bond Conditions 

•  Requesting the appropriate personnel to contact the person to discuss noncompliance, such 

─  LMHA, LIDDA, or other mental health or IDD provider; 

as the: 

─  case manager; or  

─  peace officer; 

•  ordering the person to appear in court to discuss noncompliance; 

• 

• 

revoking bond and ordering treatment to be provided in a place other than jail; 

revoking bond and ordering treatment to be provided in jail; or  

•  ordering an emergency detention under Chapter 573 of the Texas Health and Safety Code. 

Legislative Change 

H.B.  766  (87th  Reg.  Sess.  (2021)),  effective  January  1,  2022,  requires  that  as  soon  as 
practicable, but not later than the next day after the date a magistrate issues an order 
imposing  a  condition  of  bond  on  a  defendant  on  bond  for  a  violent  offense,  the 
magistrate shall notify the sheriff of the condition and provide to the sheriff a list of pertinent 
information  (including  the  identifying  information  of  any  protected  party,  the  date  and  the 
court order the conditions).  

Then, the sheriff has one day after receiving notice to update this information on TCIC (the 
Texas Crime Information Center) and make a good faith effort to notify the protected person 
and/or the victim of the alleged offense that the defendant has been released on bond.  

If a judge revokes a bond, modifies or removes a condition of bond, or disposes of the underlying 
criminal charges, the court must notify the sheriff and the sheriff must enter those changes into 
TCIC.  The  clerk  of  the  court  must  also  send  a  copy  of  the  order  to  the  person  whom  the 
condition of bond was intended to protect. 

defendant a PR bond and enter the specific programs, appointment date/time/location, etc. as conditions of bond. This is explained to 
the defendant by his or her attorney and by the magistrate. If the defendant violates the conditions, a warrant can be issued for their 
arrest.

LMHA/LBHA Required Services for Incarcerated Persons

It is a common misunderstanding that LMHAs/LBHAs are required to provide mental health services to individuals 
in jail facilities. Owners/operators of facilities are responsible for providing medical, mental, and dental services 
to inmates. Some counties have contracted with their LMHA/LBHA to provide additional services, but if there is 
no such agreement, LMHAs/LBHAs are only required to provide the following: 

Crisis Services

• 

The  LMHA/LBHA  must  have  a  crisis  screening  and  response  system  in  operation  24/7  that  is  available 
to  individuals  throughout  its  contracted  service  delivery  area.  The  telephone  system  to  access  the  crisis 
screening and response system must include a toll
free crisis hotline number. Calls to the crisis hotline are 
answered by a hotline staff member who is trained in mental health community services.

‐
•  When the crisis hotline is called, the crisis hotline staff member provides a crisis screening, and determines 
if the crisis requires deployment of the LMHA/LBHA Mobile Crisis Outreach Team (MCOT). If the crisis is 
determined to be emergent or urgent, at least one trained MCOT member shall respond to the site of the 
crisis situation and conduct a crisis assessment. After the crisis assessment is conducted, the LMHA/LBHA 
will make a recommendation about the treatment necessary to resolve the crisis.

16.22 Interviews and Collection of Other Information

• 

The  LMHA/LBHA  shall  interview  the  defendant  and  collect  other  information  regarding  whether  the 
defendant  has  a  MI  or  ID  and  provide  to  the  magistrate  a  written  report  of  the  interview  and  other 
information collected under article 16.22 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.

17.032 Recommendations

• 

The LMHA/LBHA will consult with the magistrate to help determine if there are appropriate and available 
services for the defendant.

3.  Risk Assessments

3.1  What is a Risk Assessment
Risk assessments use an actuarial evaluation to guide decision making at various points across the criminal justice 
continuum by approximating a person’s likelihood of reoffending and determining what individual criminogenic 
needs must be addressed to reduce that likelihood.82 

“A Risk assessment is used across various stages of the legal process to assess an individual’s risk of reoffending (or 
noncompliance with justice requirements) and identify areas for intervention.”83

Risk  assessments  take  various  forms  and  require  differing  sets  of  information  and  systematically  quantify  an 
individual’s  risk  of  reoffending.  These  quantified  “risk  scores”  help  practitioners  make  operational  decisions 
regarding the classification, management, and treatment of justice-involved populations.84

3.1.1  What Does a Risk Assessment Measure?
General criminogenic risk assessment tools consist of questions that are designed to ascertain someone’s history 
of criminal behavior, attitudes and personality, and life circumstances.85

It is important to emphasize that while risk assessment tools assess for risk of reoffence, they cannot predict with 
certainty that someone will or will not reoffend. Labeling someone as “high-risk” to reoffend does not mean that 
individual will definitely reoffend; rather, it means that a large number of people sharing these characteristics 
have reoffended in the past.86

Risk  assessments  that  assess  for  risk  of  reoffending  should  be  differentiated  from  specialized  clinical  risk 
assessments that measure for risk of specific outcomes, such as violence, sexual offending, and intimate partner 
violence. These risk assessments are conducted by trained and licensed clinicians.

3.1.1a  Criminogenic Factors: Risks and Needs 
Criminogenic factors are risks and needs that research has demonstrated increase an individual’s likelihood of 
re-offense. There are eight major risk and need factors, and each factor is associated with both a static risk and a 
changeable need that should be addressed through treatment, services, and targeted programming. 

Eight Criminogenic Risk Factors

There are eight central  risk  factors  (i.e.,  the  Central  Eight)  that  increase one’s  risk  for criminal  behavior  (see 
Andrews & Bonta, 2016). These risk factors include: (1) history of antisocial behavior, (2) antisocial personality, 
(3) antisocial attitudes, (4) antisocial peers, (5) family/marital problems, (6) school/employment difficulties, (7) 
absence of positive leisure/recreational activities, and (8) substance abuse. Additionally, the first four of these risk 
factors (i.e., the Big Four) are the most impactful risk factors for criminal involvement.”87

3.1.1b  Static versus Dynamic Factors
Static factors are past activities or events that cannot be changed. Examples of static factors include age at the 
time of first arrest, criminal history, residing in a single-parent home, and so forth. 

Dynamic factors are present conditions that can be changed or addressed by treatment, services, and targeted 
programming.  Examples  of  dynamic  factors  can  include  anti-social  behavior  or  attitudes,  lack  of  literacy  or 
job skills,  lack of  leisure or recreational activities, or other expressed  behaviors, values, and attitudes that are 
correlated with criminal activity. 

3.1.1.c  Risk-Need-Responsivity Model
The  risk-need-responsivity  (RNR)  model  is a  theoretical  framework developed  in  the  late  1980s and  formally 
introduced in 1990 that underlies offender programming in prisons and in community correctional settings. The 
RNR  model can assist clinicians, case  managers, and  corrections  professionals  in  identifying  and  prioritizing 
individuals  for  the  appropriate  treatments  to  reduce  their  likelihood  of  re-offense.  The  three  principles  that 
underlie the RNR model—risk, needs, and responsivity—guide the assessment and treatment of individuals with 
criminal justice involvement. The risk principle matches the intensity of individuals’ treatment to their level of 
risk  for  re-offending;  the  need  principle  targets criminogenic  needs; and  the  responsivity  principle addresses 
individuals’ barriers to learning (learning styles, reading abilities, cognitive impairments, and motivation) in the 
design of treatment interventions. Responsivity is addressed through two routes: general and specific. General 
responsivity involves addressing pro-criminal attitudes and use of cognitive behavioral intervention strategies, 
while specific responsivity involves “use of styles and modes of treatment that are matched with the client need 
and  learning  styles.”  Both  approaches  to  responsivity  have  been  found  effective.  Community  providers  and 
criminal justice professionals may address the same Central Eight risk and need factors in their interventions, 
treatment, and supervision plans, which is why the RNR model is effective across both systems. For example, 
both community providers and criminal justice professionals may address antisocial cognition through cognitive 
behavioral interventions.88

3.1.2  Factors That Do Not Heighten the Risk of Recidivism 
Equally important is being aware of the factors not included in the list of criminogenic factors—which means, 
according to the research literature, these factors do not generally predict a high risk of returning to crime:

Low self-esteem

• Mental-health issues

Low education status

•

•

•

Lack of employment options

3.1.2a  Does having a Mental Illness Automatically Increase Risk?
No,  not according to  June  2020 publication out of Texas Tech  University:  A  Comparison  of  Criminogenic  Risk 
Factors  and  Psychiatric  Symptomatology  Between  Psychiatric  Inpatients  with  and  without  Criminal  Justice 
Involvement.89 As their abstract explains:

“People have often assumed persons with mental illness become criminal justice-
involved  because  of  symptoms  associated  with  their  illness  or  lack  of  mental 
health  treatment;  however,  criminal  risk  factors  (the  Big  Four  and  Central 
Eight),  not  severity  of  psychiatric  symptomatology,  most  accurately  classified 
psychiatric inpatients with and without a history of criminal justice involvement. 
Thus,  psychotherapeutic  interventions  should  target  criminal  risk  factors,  such 
as  antisocial  personality,  attitudes  toward  criminal  associates,  and  job-seeking 
behavior.  In other words,  to  be  most successful, when  treating criminal  justice-
involved persons with mental illness, practitioners should assess and treat not only 
symptoms associated with their mental illness, but their criminal risk as well.”90

In other words, the Big Four and Central Eight factors, not mental illness or the severity there of, are more closely 
aligned with risk of recidivism. For individuals with mental illness, research indicates that treatment alone does 
not reduce recidivism, and conversely, interventions that address only criminogenic risk and need factors do not 
improve behavioral health outcomes.91

3.2 

Using Risk Assessments

Importance of Using Risk Assessments 

3.2.1 
Risk assessments are data-driven decision-making support tools that systematically synthesize information about 
justice populations and support more efficient distribution of limited justice resources. Criminal justice systems 
lack the resources to provide intense supervision and treatment to everyone who comes into contact with the 
justice system and must instead decide on whom to target available resources. Risk assessments allow practitioners 
to strategically target programming for individuals based on their risks and needs. It is important to note that 
research has shown that individuals at low risk of reoffending can be successfully managed with minimum or no 
supervision and may even be harmed by more intensive monitoring and treatment. Programming should focus on

those with the greatest risks and needs. Ultimately, the importance of using actuarial risk assessment tools across 
criminal justice settings and stages is defined by improved consistency, efficiency, and effectiveness.92

3.2.1a  Consistency
Risk  assessments  improve  the  consistency  of  data  informing  criminal  justice  decisions  and  the  processes  by 
which  such  decisions  are  made.  In  this  way,  decisions  guided  by  risk  assessments  can  be  viewed  as  more 
defensible and credible than more subjective and less transparent decision-making processes.

3.2.1b  Efficiency
Data-driven  risk  assessments  can  help  practitioners  make  more  efficient  use  of  limited  justice  resources. 
Actuarial risk assessments consistently emerge as superior to professional judgment in predicting reoffending 
risk, yielding more efficient decision-making heuristics.

3.2.1c  Effectiveness

Detailed risk assessments using empirically valid tools can help practitioners more effectively improve criminal 
justice outcomes (e.g.,  reduce reoffending,  improve compliance).  Risk assessment scores also provide a  richer 
picture of individual variation in program effectiveness, helping practitioners determine what works for whom 
and why.93

3.2.2  Uses of a Risk Assessment Instrument in the Sequential Intercept Model
Risk assessments can be administered at any time during a person’s contact with the criminal justice system—
during  the  pretrial  period,  while  on  probation,  after  admission  to  a  correctional  facility,  prior  to  release,  and 
during post-release supervision. 

Risk assessments have been shown to be more reliable than a professional’s individual judgment. They should 
be  used  at  multiple  decision  points  to  direct  the  supervision  intensity,  case  planning  and  management, 
programming requirements,  and  treatment  referrals.94  While  risk  assessment  should  not  be  the  sole  factor  in 
making  these  decisions,  it  is  currently  the  best  available  method  for  ensuring  that  research-based  data 
helps  inform  the  decision-making process.95

Once risk and needs are properly and timely identified, criminal justice agencies can then be more effective in 
ensuring public safety through the appropriate management and rehabilitative programming of justice-involved 
individuals.” 96

Texas Risk Assessment System (TRAS)

The  Texas  Department  of  Criminal  Justice,  in  collaboration  with  local  CSCDs  and  other  criminal  justice 
stakeholders,  developed  and  validated  the  Texas  Risk  Assessment  System  (TRAS),  a  dynamic  risk  assessment 
consistent  with  current  evidence-based  research  on  the  predictors  of  criminality  and  recidivism.  The  TRAS 
contains both screening and assessment components that can be applied to offenders on any form of community 
supervision, along with versions specific to the prison, parole, and reentry populations in Texas. The validated 
TRAS instrument replaced the community supervision version of the Wisconsin Risk/Needs Assessment and the 
Strategies for Case Supervision case management instrument previously used in Texas.97

When selecting a risk assessment, be sure that the assessment measures the data specific to that point in the 
case.  Which assessment  to  use will  likely depend on  the  intercept  in which your county  is administering  the 
assessment.  

The cornerstone of usable risk assessment instruments is reliability and validity. Validated and reliable 
risk assessment instruments have been verified to ensure practitioners get the same risk score on the same 
client (reliability), and that it is truly reflect risk when outcome is examined (predictive validity).98 The U.S. 
Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Assistance has created a website to assist agencies in selecting a 
validated and reliable risk assessment instrument that can be accessed at: Tool Selector | Bureau of Justice 
Assistance (ojp.gov). 

3.2.2a  Intercept 2 – Initial Detention / Court Hearings
A pretrial risk assessment instrument can be used to help inform decisions about release pending adjudication or 
jail detention, as well as help guide decisions on pretrial release conditions.99 A pretrial risk assessment instrument 
should measure two risks for the time before trial: (i)  risk of failing to appear in court, and (ii) and risk of being 
arrested for a new crime.100

3.2.3b  Intercepts 3, 4, and 5 – Sentencing, Re-Entry, and Community Corrections
Risk assessment instruments can be used at sentencing to inform decisions on whether a person can be diverted 
safely to a specialized program, specialty court, community supervision, or options other than incarceration. The 
risk assessment instrument should measure for risk to reoffend in the community and possible risk and need 
factors that can be addressed with services and/or targeted programming. 101

Risk  assessments  are  also  used  by  correctional  departments  to  determine  the  appropriate  programming  for 
incarcerated  individuals,”102  and  they  can  also  be  used  at  re-entry.  A  risk  assessment  instrument  focused  on 
transitions from prison can be used to reduce the risk of reoffense for those returning to the community. The 
tool  is also guided  by the risk and  needs principle and  highlights specific  intervention pathways that address 
criminogenic needs dependent on the level of risk a person has. The tool should be able to assist in the creation 
of case plans and transition plans that inform treatment matching to level of criminogenic need. 103

Risk  assessment  instruments  can  also  support  transitions  from  jail  with  the  same  goal  to  reduce  the  risk  to 
reoffence for those returning to the community. Risk assessments instruments for jail populations establish level 
of risk to reoffend and then further assess people in target populations to guide reentry interventions. The tool 
can also be used to inform treatment matching to level of criminogenic need.104 

Probation and parole departments should use risk assessments to set the level of supervision, including home 
confinement and electronic monitoring. Further, risk assessments can be used by case managers and treatment 
providers  to  identify  needs,  deliver  evidence-based  treatment  and  interventions,  and  link  individuals  to 
appropriate services as part of re-entry and supervision plans.105

detrimental and life-changing. As a result, judicial support of community-based mental health responses and 
court-based interventions such as specialty courts and dockets are critical.

Options after the Trial Court Receives the Article 16.22 Report from the Magistrate

1.1 
After the trial court receives from the magistrate the applicable expert’s written report under article 16.22(b-1),106 
regardless of whether the written report indicates MI or ID, the trial court may, as applicable:

•  continue criminal proceedings against the defendant;

• 

• 

resume or  initiate competency proceedings  if required  by  Chapter  46B of the Texas  Code of  Criminal 
Procedure (see Intercept 3, section 7 of this Bench Book);

refer the person to an appropriate specialty court (see Intercept 3, section 2 of this Bench Book;

•  consider the written report during the punishment phase;

•  consider the written report as part of the presentence investigation report; 

•  consider the written report in setting conditions of community supervision, including deferred adjudication 
community  supervision  (see  article  42A.506  of  the  Texas  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  authorizing 
outpatient or inpatient mental health or ID treatment as a condition of community supervision under 
certain circumstances); or 

• 

if the offense charged does not involve an act, attempt, or threat of serious bodily injury to another person, 
release the defendant on bail while charges against the defendant remain pending and enter an order 
transferring the defendant to the appropriate court for court-ordered outpatient mental health services 
under Chapter 574 of the Texas Health and Safety Code.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(c).

Diversion from the Criminal Justice System to Court-ordered Mental Health Services
1.2 
If  the  court  enters  an  order  transferring  the  defendant  to  the  appropriate  court  for  court-ordered  outpatient 
mental health services under Chapter 574 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, an attorney representing the state 
must file the application for court-ordered outpatient mental health services. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(c-1).

On the motion of an attorney representing the state, if the court determines the defendant has complied with 
appropriate court-ordered outpatient treatment, the court may dismiss the charges pending against the defendant 
and discharge the defendant. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(c-2).

However, on the motion of an attorney representing the state, if the court determines the defendant has failed to 
comply with appropriate court-ordered outpatient treatment, the court must proceed with the trial of the offense 
or as otherwise applicable under Chapter 16 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 
16.22(c-3).

If the offense charged does not involve an act, attempt, or threat of serious bodily injury to another person, the 
trial court can release the defendant on bail and enter an order transferring the defendant to the appropriate 
court for court-ordered outpatient mental health services without dismissing the underlying criminal charge. 
If the defendant complies with the court-ordered treatment, the court may dismiss the charge (on the motion 
of the prosecutor), thus diverting the individual from the criminal justice system. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 
16.22(c-5). In counties that do not have a statutory probate court, it is possible for some courts, for example a 
court at law, to have both a criminal docket and a probate docket. Accordingly, that court can consider an Article 
16.22(c-5) diversion without involving a second court.

Article 16.22 Does Not Prevent Release or a Competency Examination

1.3 
Article 16.22 does not prevent the applicable court before, during, or after the collection of information regarding 
the defendant from:

releasing a defendant who has a mental illness or is a person with IDD from custody on personal or surety 
bond, including imposing as a condition of release that the defendant submit to an examination or other 
assessment; or

ordering an examination regarding the defendant’s competency to stand trial.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 16.22(d).

Reflection Point

Ask yourself, as a judge:

➢ Has any party sought a pretrial diversion in favor of outpatient treatment in the community?

➢ Has  trauma  created  a  lack  of  ability  to  access  services  by  the  person  in  any  system  including

education or probation?

➢ Has any party filed a motion for competency examination?

➢ Have I helped to destigmatize mental health and intellectual and developmental disability?

➢ Have I made assumptions about who is present in the courtroom, overlooking transportation or
other concerns in favor of shortcuts and assumptions about whether this person has a family
that cares about their well-being?

➢ What assumptions am I making without asking this person who are the important people in their 

life and who could help them?

➢ Have I made assumptions based on the social media accounts, pictures, or posts of this person?

How might my assumptions influence my decision-making?

➢ How have I challenged any assumptions I might have made based on cultural identity, profession,

or background?

Collaboration Is Key

ordered 
Because, with limited exceptions, only a court with probate jurisdiction may hear proceedings for court
mental health services, collaboration between those courts and courts with criminal
matter jurisdiction is critical 
to ensuring that civil commitment may effectively serve as a diversionary tool. It is also essential for the local 
courts to collaborate with the LMHA/LBHA and LIDDA to assure that services are available.

Specialty Courts

2.
Specialty courts focus on treating the underlying issues that may be causing criminal behavior. Mental health 
courts are a type of specialty court. They combine accountability through judicial supervision with treatment and 
other support services to prevent recidivism and improve the lives of their participants.

Reflection Point

Consider  whether  financial  resources  impact  which  individuals  are  provided  with  opportunities  to 
participate in diversion programs or services.

2.1 

Statutory Requirements

A “mental health court program” has the following essential characteristics:

integrates and provides access to MI and ID treatment services in processing cases in the court system;

uses a nonadversarial approach involving prosecutors and defense attorneys to (1) promote public safety
and (2) protect the due process rights of program participants;

promotes early identification and prompt placement of eligible participants in the program;

requires ongoing judicial interaction with program participants;

diverts people with MI or ID to needed services in lieu of prosecution;

• monitors and evaluates program goals and effectiveness;

facilitates continuing  interdisciplinary education on effective program planning, implementation, and
operations; and

develops partnerships with public agencies and community organizations, including LMHAs/LBHAs.

Tex. Gov’t Code § 125.001.

Counties with a population of more than 200,000 must establish a mental health court program under section 
125.002 of the Texas Government Code. The commissioners court must direct the judge, magistrate, or coordinator 
to provide to OCA: (1) written notice of the program; (2) any resolution or other official declaration under which 
the program was established; and (3) a copy of the applicable strategic plan that incorporates duties related to 
supervision that will be required under the program. Tex. Gov’t Code § 125.005(a).

A county required to establish a mental health court program must apply for federal and state funds available to 
pay the costs of the program. The criminal justice division of the Governor’s Office may assist a county in applying 
for  federal  funds as  required.  However,  if  the county does  not  receive  federal or  state  funding  specifically  for 
that purpose in an amount sufficient to pay the fund costs of the mental health court program; or if the judge, 
magistrate, or coordinator does not receive the verification described by section 121.002(c)(2) of the Government 
Code, the county is not required to establish a mental health court program. Tex. Gov’t Code § 125.005(b), (c).

A county that is required to establish a mental health court program and fails to establish or to maintain that 
program is ineligible to receive grant funding from this state or any state agency. Tex. Gov’t Code § 125.005(d).

The commissioners courts of two or more counties may elect to establish a regional mental health court program 
under this chapter for the participating counties. Tex. Gov’t Code § 125.0025.

Pretrial Intervention Programs 

Pretrial Intervention Program

3.1 
A community supervision and corrections department established under Chapter 76 of the Texas Government 
Code (“department”) may operate programs for:

the supervision and rehabilitation of persons in pretrial intervention programs;

• 

• 

the supervision of persons released on bail under:

 ◦ Chapter 11 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure;
 ◦ Chapter 17 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure;
 ◦ article 44.04 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure; or
 ◦ any other law;

• 

the supervision of a person subject to, or the verification of compliance with, a court order issued under:

 ◦ article 17.441 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, requiring a person to install a deep- lung breath 

analysis mechanism on each vehicle owned or operated by the person;

 ◦ Chapter 123 of the Texas Government Code or former law, issuing an occupational driver’s license;
 ◦

section  49.09(h) of the Texas  Penal  Code, requiring a person to  install a deep-lung  breath analysis 
mechanism on each vehicle owned or operated by the person; or

 ◦

section  521.2462  of  the  Texas  Transportation  Code,  requiring  supervision  of  a  person  granted  an 
occupational driver’s license; and

• 

the supervision of a person not otherwise described by section 76.011(a)(1), (2), or (3), if a court orders the 
person to submit to the supervision of, or to receive services from, the department.

Tex. Gov’t Code § 76.011(a).

Except as otherwise provided by subsection 76.011(b), programs operated by the department under subsection 
76.011(a) may include reasonable conditions related to the purpose of the program, including testing for controlled 
substances.  If  this  subsection  conflicts  with  a  more  specific  provision  of  another  law,  the  other  law  prevails.  
Tex. Gov’t Code § 76.011(b).

A  person  in  a  pretrial  intervention  program  operated  by  the  department  under  subsection  76.011(a)  may  be 
supervised for a period not to exceed two years. Tex. Gov’t Code § 76.011(c).

The department may use money deposited in the special fund of the county treasury for the department under 
article 103.004(d) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, only for the same purposes for which state aid may be 
used under Chapter 76. Tex. Gov’t Code § 76.011(d).

4.  Deferred Adjudication and Deferred Disposition 

4.1 

 
Requiring Treatment as a Condition of Community Supervision, Class B Misdemeanors  
and Higher

The judge may order a person placed on community supervision to submit to outpatient or inpatient MI or ID 
treatment if the following criteria are met:

137

•

the person is determined to have a MI or ID in

◦ a report under article 16.22 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure

◦

incompetency proceedings under Chapter 46B of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure,108 or

◦ a  psychological evaluation as  part of a  PSI  report  under article  42A.253(a)(6) of  the  Texas  Code of

Criminal Procedure;

•

the person’s

◦ mental impairment is chronic or

◦ ability to function independently will deteriorate if the person does not receive MI or ID services; and

•

the judge consults with a local mental health or intellectual disability services provider and determines
that services are available through:

◦ HHSC under section 534.053 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, or

◦ another mental health or intellectual disability services provider, such as the LMHA or LIDDA.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 42A.506.

Legislative Change

H.B. 385 (87th Reg. Sess. (2021)) allows a judge to modify the conditions of community supervision 
for  the  added  purpose  of  “prioritizing  the  conditions  ordered  by  the  court  according  to  the 
defendant’s  progress  under  supervision.”  This  addition  allows  the  judge  to  effectively  tailor  the 
supervision  conditions  to  the  probationer.  The  probationer’s  ability  to  pay  must  be  taken  into 
consideration,  and  the  changes  to  art.  42A.655  give  the  judge  added  flexibility  for  handling 

situations where the defendant lacks sufficient resources or income. 

This bill also removed from CCP 42A.052 the possible supervision condition that would require a defendant to 
“avoid persons or places of disreputable or harmful character, including any person, other than a family member 
of the defendant, who is an active member of a criminal street gang.” Part of the legislative intent behind this 
modification  was  to  allow  probationers  to  attend  AA  or  similar  programs  where  other  persons  on  probation 
might gather for a beneficial purpose.

Additionally, this bill modified art. 42A.303(e) to allow the community supervision and corrections department 
supervising the defendant to develop a continuum of care treatment plan when an individual is released from 
SAFPF. 

Deferred Disposition of Class C Misdemeanors

4.2 
Article  45.051(b) of  the Texas  Code of  Criminal  Procedure allows a  justice of  the peace or  municipal  judge  to 
require the defendant to:

submit to professional counseling;

submit to a psychosocial assessment;

•

•

•

•

comply with any other reasonable condition.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 45.051(b).

present to the court satisfactory evidence that he or she has complied with each requirement imposed by
the court; and

108  Because placement of a defendant on community supervision involves a conviction or entering a plea, a defendant determined to have MI 
or ID under Chapter 46B of the Code of Criminal Procedure could not be placed on community supervision if found incompetent. This statute 
highlights that a defendant with MI is not necessarily incompetent. See section 7.1.1 of this Bench Book.

138

At  the  time  the  defendant  is  placed  on  deferred  disposition,  the  court  can  impose  requirements  to  continue 
treatment, participate  in any assessments reasonably related to providing  mental  health/IDD services, and to 
comply with all prescribed medications and recommendations under the sections outlined above.

Reflection Point

Ask yourself, as a judge:

➢ Has equity been considered in prior intercept points?

➢ Have I helped to destigmatize MI and IDD?

➢ Have I asked myself about the person before me having race-based trauma, such as witnessing
the videos of people being murdered in the news and other traumas in the traditional sense,
resulting in acting out behavior and other mental health challenges?

➢ What assumptions have I made about people based on their cultural identity, profession, or

background?

➢ How might my assumptions influence my decision-making?

➢ How  have  I  challenged  any  assumptions  I  might  have  made  based  on  cultural  identity,

profession, or background?

5.

Determination of Undue Hardship for Discharge of a Fine

5.1  Waiver of Payment of Fines and Costs for Certain Defendants
Judges are permitted, but not required, to waive payment of all or part of a fine imposed on a defendant if the 
court determines that the defendant 

•

•

is a child, is indigent, or does not have sufficient resources or income to pay all or part of the fine; and

each alternative method of discharging the fine (community service, payment at a later date, or installment
payments) would impose an undue hardship on the defendant.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. arts. 43.091(c); 45.0491(d).

5.2 

Significant Mental Impairment or Disability Considered

In making the determination of undue hardship, the court may consider, among other things, the defendant’s 
significant physical or mental impairment or disability.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 43.091(b);45.0491(c).

Challenges for Justice and Municipal Courts

Diversion from the criminal justice system of individuals with MI is especially challenging for justice and municipal 
courts. Despite lacking a robust statutory scheme for diverting individuals with MI with cases involving Class C 
misdemeanors, most individuals with MI enter the criminal justice system through those courts. This is due to 
the volume of cases filed and the nature of certain Class C offenses like disorderly conduct, public intoxication, 
and  city  ordinances  criminalizing  camping  or  sleeping  outdoors,  which  may  be  manifestations  of  MI.  While 
plea agreements, conditions of deferred disposition, and community service are viable options for connecting 
individuals with mental health services, without a clear statutory scheme, those courts are left with only creativity

139

TCOOMMI Programs and Services

6. 
The Texas Correctional Office on Offenders with Medical or Mental Impairments (TCOOMMI) funds programs 
through the 39 LMHAs to provide pre-release screening and referral to aftercare treatment services for special 
needs offenders  referred  from  pre-trial supervision,  local  jails, correctional  institutional divisions, substance-
abuse felony punishment facilities, and other referral sources.  

Levels  of  outpatient  services  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  Intensive  Case  Management,  Transitional  Case 
Management, and  Continuity of  Care.    Components of case  management  include case  management services, 
rehabilitation/psychological services, substance abuse treatment, psychiatric services, medication monitoring, 
and linkage to hospice and medical services.

All services offer collaborative partnerships between a mental health caseworker and criminal justice supervision 
partner to enhance access to care while promoting medication and supervision compliance at no cost to the client.

Target  populations  include  those  on  pre-trial  supervision,  probation,  and  parole  who  have  moderate  to  high 
criminogenic risk and high clinical needs. See infra Intercept 4, section 2 of this Bench Book for a more detailed 
look at TCOOMMI.

Incompetency to Stand Trial

7. 
Competence to stand trial is the legally determined capacity of a criminal defendant to proceed with criminal 
adjudication. A criminal defendant may not be subjected to trial if he or she lacks the capacity to understand the 
proceedings against him or her, to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing a defense.109 This prohibition is 
fundamental to an adversary system of justice.110 Failure to use procedures that protect the defendant’s right not 
to be tried or convicted while incompetent to stand trial is a violation of due process and the right to a fair trial.111  

This chapter covers Texas procedures related to competency, which are generally found in Chapter 46B of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure. Chapter 46B applies to a defendant charged with a felony or with a misdemeanor 
punishable by confinement.112 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.002.

Justice and Municipal Courts

Despite the inapplicability of the procedures in Chapter 46B to defendants charged with Class C misdemeanors 
in municipal and justice courts, the prohibition against trying and convicting defendants who lack competency 
applies to all defendants. For individuals charged with any level of misdemeanor, diversion to treatment and 
services is the best practice. One suggested legislative solution is to move section 8.08 of the Penal Code (Child 
with Mental Illness, Disability, or Lack of Capacity) to Chapter 45 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Justice and 
Municipal Courts) and make that provision applicable to adults as well. This would expressly permit municipal 
judges and justices of the peace to dismiss the complaint when a defendant lacks capacity. However, connecting 
defendants  to  appropriate  services  and  education  is  an  important  prerequisite  to  dismissal.  Problem-solving 
courts  such  as  the  Downtown  Austin  Community  Court  and  Dallas  Community  Courts  are  good  models  for 
addressing issues related to MI and homelessness involving defendants charged with Class C misdemeanors.

109  Drope v. Missouri, 420 U.S. 162, 171 (1975).

110  Id. at 172.

111  Id. (citing Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375 (1966)).

112  Note that when a person is held in jail on probable cause pending an indictment by a grand jury, and the issue of competency arises, order-
ing a competency evaluation prior to a formal charge can be problematic. It can result in a facility holding a person beyond the maximum period 
of restoration allowed by law (see section 7.2.5 below) and may prevent civil commitment that would have otherwise been permitted under 
article 46B.151. Floyd L. Jennings, Procedural Choke Points in 46B Competency Issues, Voice for the Defense Online (March 12, 2016),

Legislative Change

H.B. 3774 (87th Reg. Sess. (2021)) added article 45.0241 to the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure and 
codified the requirement that a justice or judge (including a justice of the peace or a municipal judge) 
may not accept a plea of guilty or plea of nolo contendre from a defendant in open court unless it 
appears to the justice or judge that the defendant is mentally competent, and the plea is free and 
voluntary. 

Before  placing a defendant  in  that system,  judges should  understand  the gravity  inherent  in a determination 
of incompetency. The proceedings involved are costly and lengthen an individual’s involvement in the criminal 
justice  system.113  Nationally,  courts  order  an  estimated  60,000  competency  evaluations  each  year.114  Of  those 
evaluations, only about 20 percent lead to a finding of incompetency.115  

Judges  should  first  consider  whether  competency  is  the  real  issue  and  the  effect  the  competency  system  will 
have on an individual’s ultimate outcome. For example, dismissal may be more appropriate. Article 46B.004(e) 
permits the court, upon the motion of the prosecutor, to dismiss all charges pending against the defendant at 
any time during 46B proceedings after the issue of the defendant’s incompetency to stand trial is first raised. The 
court may then proceed with civil commitment under Subchapter F, if there is evidence to support a finding of 
incompetency, or discharge the defendant.  

After all, the goal of the competency system is different than the goals of treatment and services. The competency 
system is not the ideal pathway into behavioral health treatment, though it is one. The procedures that follow are 
appropriate in some cases involving individuals with MI and intellectual disabilities; however, generally, the best 
practice in such cases is early diversion to treatment and services, avoiding competency restoration altogether.116

113  Because the defendant gets credit for time served in competency restoration (Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.009), an incompetency finding 
provides some delay to proceedings, but has little additional effect, other than costs to the county mental health authority for the state hospital 
bed. Floyd L. Jennings, Procedural Choke Points in 46B Competency Issues, Voice for the Defense Online (March 12, 2016),

116  Effective September 1, 2019, article 16.22 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides a mechanism for diversion to court-ordered 
outpatient mental health services while a criminal charge remains pending. If the offense charged does not involve an act, attempt, or threat 
of serious bodily injury to another person, the trial court may, after receiving the applicable expert’s written report, release the defendant on 
bail while charges remain pending and enter an order transferring the defendant to the appropriate court for court-ordered outpatient mental 
health services under Chapter 574 of the Texas Health and Safety Code. If the defendant complies, the court may, on the motion of the prosecu-
tor, dismiss the charges. S.B. 362, 86th Leg., Reg. Sess. (2019).

Determining Incompetency to Stand Trial

7.1 
All states, including Texas, have a statutory standard for determining whether a person is incompetent to stand 
trial. This standard comes  from  Dusky  v.  U.S., a  1960  U.S.  Supreme  Court  Case, which  held  that  the  test of a 
defendant’s competency to stand trial is whether he or she has “sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer 
with a reasonable degree of rational understanding—and whether he [or she] has a rational as well as factual 
understanding of the proceedings against him [or her].”117 

7.1.1  Standard
A  person  is  presumed  competent  to  stand  trial  unless  he  or  she  proves  otherwise.118  The  court  shall  find  the 
defendant competent unless proved incompetent by a preponderance of the evidence. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 
46B.003(b). The defendant has the burden of proof regarding incompetency.  119 The relevant point in time for 
determining a person’s competency is at the time of the proceedings, not the time of the alleged offense.120 

A person is incompetent to stand trial if the person does not have:

• 

sufficient  present  ability  to  consult  with  the  person’s  lawyer  with  a  reasonable  degree  of  rational 
understanding; or

•  a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against the person.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.003(a). 

Note: A person who is incompetent to stand trial is also incompetent to plead guilty. See Ex parte Lewis, 587 
S.W.2d 697, 700 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel Op.] 1979). A defendant with MI who is competent to proceed may not 
be sufficiently competent to proceed without counsel. See Indiana v. Edwards, 128 S. Ct. 2379 (2008). After all, 

117  Dusky v. U.S., 362 U.S. 402 (1960).

118  Schaffer v. State, 583 S.W.2d 627, 630 (Tex. Crim. App. 1979). However, if the defendant has an unvacated adjudication of incompetency (i.e., 
was found incompetent and sent for restoration or found unlikely to be restored to competency in the foreseeable future and now faces a 
subsequent charge), the defendant is presumed incompetent. Manning v. State, 730 S.W.2d 744 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987). The State then bears the 
burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is competent. Id.

119  Owens v. State, 473 S.W.3d 812 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015).

120  Article 46B.003 provides that a person is incompetent if lacking a sufficient present ability to consult with a lawyer. See also  
Morris v. State, 214 S.W.3d 159, 168-169); (Tex. App.—Beaumont 2007), aff’d, 301 S.W.3d 281 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009), Lasiter v. State, 283 S.W.3d 
909, 925 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 2009, pet. ref’d).

142

the Drope competency standards assume representation by counsel.121 The requirement that a justice or judge 
(including a justice of the peace or a municipal judge) may not accept a plea of guilty or plea of nolo contendre from 
a defendant in open court unless it appears to the justice or judge that the defendant is mentally competent, and 
the plea is free and voluntary was codified in article 45.0241 to the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure by H.B. 3774 
(87th Reg. Sess. (2021)).

Making the Distinction: Competency, Insanity, and Mental Illness

Competency  to  Stand  Trial:  Relates  to  a  defendant’s  mental  state  and  present  capacity  to  stand  trial  at  the 
time of trial (should not be confused with a general finding of incapacity by a civil court related to guardianship); 
incompetency is not a defense to the crime charged.

Insanity: Relates to a defendant’s mental state at the time the alleged crime was committed and is an affirmative 
defense to prosecution.

Mental  Illness:  Relates  to  impairment  of  thought,  perception  of  reality,  emotional  process,  judgment,  or 
behavior; a person may have a mental illness, but still be competent to stand trial (though maybe not without 
counsel).

7.1.2  Raising the Issue

7.1.2a  Timing
The issue of the defendant’s incompetency to stand trial may be raised at any time before the 

sentence is pronounced. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.005(d).122 Though making this determination before trial 
best serves the interests of justice, issues with the defendant’s competency may not manifest until after trial has 
begun.

If the issue of the defendant’s incompetency is raised after the trial begins, the court may determine the issue at 
any time before the sentence is pronounced. If the determination is delayed until the return of a verdict, the court 
shall make the determination as soon as reasonably possible after the return. Upon a verdict of not guilty, the 
court may not determine the issue. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.005(d).

7.1.2b  Who May Raise the Issue
Either party may suggest by motion, or the trial court may suggest on its own motion, that the defendant may be 
incompetent to stand trial. This motion may be supported by affidavits. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.004(a).

7.1.2c  Suggestion
A suggestion of incompetency is the threshold requirement for an informal inquiry and may consist solely of a 
representation from any credible source that the defendant may be incompetent. This includes the defendant, 
defense counsel, a family member, law enforcement, jail staff, a prosecutor, a mental health care worker, or other 
interested person. 

This is a very low threshold. A further evidentiary showing is not required to initiate the inquiry, and the court is 
not required to have a bona fide doubt about the competency of the defendant. 123 Evidence suggesting the need 

121  Drope v. Missouri, 420 U.S. 162 (1975). 

122  When determining whether a trial court should have held a competency hearing, an appellate court will not typically consider evidence brought 
to the attention of the trial court for the first time after sentencing, but only the evidence actually known up until the point of sentencing. Rodriguez 
v. State, 329 S.W.3d 74, 78 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.). However, at least one court of appeals has found that new evidence on 
competency may be considered in a motion for new trial. Lasiter v. State, 283 S.W.3d 909, 926 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 2009, pet. ref’d).

123  Caselaw interpreting former article 46.02 (the predecessor to Chapter 46B) required a judge to have a “bona fide doubt” before conducting 
an informal inquiry. See Montoya v. State, 291 S.W.3d 420, 425 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009). The Legislature responded to Montoya by adding subsection 
(c-1) to article 46B.004 in 2011. The revised statute was intended to lower that threshold, making it easier to raise the issue of incompetency 
before trial. briaN d. SHaNNoN & daNiel H. beNSoN, texaS CriMiNal ProCedure aNd tHe offeNder witH MeNtal illNeSS 49-50 (6th ed. 2019).

143

for an informal inquiry may be based on any indication that the defendant is incompetent, including observations 
made in relation to one or more of the factors an expert is required to consider under article 46B.024, discussed 
below. See section 7.1.5f below. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.004(c-1). 

If information suggesting the defendant may be incompetent to stand trial comes to the attention of the court, 
the court on its own motion shall suggest that the defendant may be incompetent to stand trial. Tex. Code Crim. 
Proc. art. 46B.004(b). 

7.1.2d  Informal Inquiry  
On  suggestion  that  the  defendant  may  be  incompetent  to  stand  trial,  the  court  shall  determine  by  informal 
inquiry  whether  there  is  some  evidence124  from  any  source  that  would  support  a  finding  of  incompetency.  
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.004(c).

Informal Inquiry

An informal inquiry will look different depending on the volume of cases the court handles, the source of the 
information provided, and when it occurs in the process. In practice, it ranges from a conversation to a hearing. 
Note that it is intended to be informal and that the standard is so low, that any suggestion will suffice to trigger 
it. The suggestion may come from defense counsel, family members of the defendant, mental health records, jail 
staff, or the LMHA. Some judges (or magistrates if the issue is raised early in the process) have a conversation 
with the defendant; for some judges, it is a determination based on the information brought to the judge. In 
determining whether there is some evidence from any source that would support a finding of incompetency, 
“better safe than sorry” may be a wise approach.

7.1.2e  Experts
If  after  the  informal  inquiry  the  court  determines  that  there  is  some  evidence  that  the  defendant  may  be 
incompetent to stand trial, the court may appoint one or more disinterested experts to:

•  examine the defendant and report to the court on the competency or incompetency of the defendant; and

• 

testify as to the issue of competency or incompetency at any trial or hearing involved in that issue.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 45B.021(a).

7.1.3 

If There Is Some Evidence of Incompetency

First Consider a Diversion Option for Non-Violent Cases

When the issue of competency is broached in nonviolent (and particularly misdemeanor) cases an attorney or the 
court  may  want  to  instead  consider  using  Art.  16.22(c)(5)  diversion,  as  opposed  to  moving  directly  to  competency 
proceedings.

Tex.  Code  Crim.  Proc.  art.  16.22(c)(5)  allows  the  court  to  release  the  defendant  on  bail  while  charges  against  the 
defendant remain pending and enter an order transferring the defendant to the appropriate court for court-ordered 
outpatient  mental  health  services  under  Chapter  574  of  the  Texas  Health  and  Safety  Code.  This  subsection  is 
specifically for offenses that do not involve an act, attempt, or threat of serious bodily injury to another person. 

124  Under prior law, the court was required to conduct further competency proceedings upon the introduction of some probative evidence, 
more than a scintilla, regarding the defendant’s incompetency. Id. In enacting Chapter 46B, there was no intent by the Legislature to change the 
requisite evidentiary threshold for establishing “some evidence.” Id., citing Turner v. State, 422 S.W.3d 676 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013) (In making the 
determination, a trial court must consider only that evidence tending to show incompetency, putting aside all competing indications of competency, 
to find whether there is some evidence, a quantity more than none or a scintilla, that rationally may lead to a conclusion of incompetency.).

144

7.1.3a  Determination of Incompetency after Informal Inquiry
If the court determines there is evidence to support a finding of incompetency, the court shall: 

• 

stay all other proceedings in the case, unless (1) the issue was raised after the trial on the merits began,125 
or  (2)  the  state  has  dismissed  all  pending  charges  against  the  defendant  (Tex.  Code  Crim.  Proc.  art. 
46B.004(d));

•  order  an  examination  under  Subchapter  B  (Examination)  of  Chapter  46B  to  determine  whether  the 
defendant is incompetent to stand trial in a criminal case (Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.005(a)) (see 
section 7.1.5 below);

•  appoint  one  or  more  experts  to  examine  the  defendant  and  report  to  the  court  on  the  defendant’s 
competency  or  incompetency  and  testify  as  to  that  issue  at  any  trial  or  hearing  involving  that  issue  
(Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.021(b)); and

•  hold a trial under Subchapter C (Incompetency Trial) of Chapter 46B (see section 7.1.6 below) unless:

 ◦ neither party’s counsel requests a trial on the issue of incompetency;
 ◦ neither party’s counsel opposes a finding of incompetency; and
 ◦

the court does not, on its own motion, determine that a trial is necessary to determine incompetency.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.005(b). 

Absent  this  narrow statutory exception, when  the  trial court determines  that  there  is some evidence  that  the 
defendant may be incompetent to stand trial, the court must conduct a competency trial.126 See further discussion 
of this concept in section 7.1.6 Incompetency Trial. 

 Standards of Evidence in the Competency Process127 

What is required to raise the issue of incompetence and 
trigger an informal inquiry by the court?

 A suggestion from any credible source.

 What is required to be obtained in an informal inquiry 
that would be enough to warrant an order for a 
competency evaluation?

 Some evidence; more than none.

What is required to defeat the presumption of 
competency and order competency restoration services?

 A preponderance of the evidence.

If charges are pending, what is required for a criminal 
court to order a mental health civil commitment (article 
46B.102) for a person either found unlikely to be 
restored to competency in the foreseeable future or 
ordered to competency restoration, but unrestored?

Clear and convincing evidence.

7.1.3b  No Interlocutory Appeal
Neither the state nor the defendant is entitled to make an interlocutory appeal relating to a determination of 
incompetency under article 46B.005. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. 46B.011.

125  If the issue of the defendant’s incompetency is raised after the trial begins, the court may determine the issue at any time before the sen-
tence is pronounced. If the determination is delayed until the return of a verdict, the court shall make the determination as soon as reasonably 
possible after the return. Upon a verdict of not guilty, the court may not determine the issue. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.005(d).

126  Turner v. State, 570 S.W.3rd 250, 262 (Tex. Crim. App. 2018); Bluntson v. State, No. AP-77,067, 2021 WL_____, at *14 (Tex. Crim. App. 2021). 

127  Adapted from Floyd L. Jennings, Procedural Choke Points in 46B Competency Issues, Voice for the Defense Online (March 12, 2016).

145

7.1.4  Appointment of Counsel
A defendant is entitled to representation by counsel before any court-ordered competency evaluation and during 
any proceeding at which it is suggested that the defendant may be incompetent to stand trial. If the defendant is 
indigent and the court has not appointed counsel to represent the defendant, the court shall appoint counsel as 
necessary to comply with such entitlement. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.006.

7.1.5  Competency Examination

7.1.5a  Defendant Maintained Under Same Custody or Status Before Examination
During a competency examination, except as otherwise ordered by the court, the defendant shall be maintained 
under  the  same  custody  status  as  the  defendant  was  maintained  under  immediately  before  the  examination 
began. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.023. This does not mean the examination is required to be conducted at 
the jail. The court can also order that the defendant be transported to a facility designated by the LMHA for the 
competency examination. See articles 46B.021, 46B.005, 46B.022 and 46B.027(b). Absent a separate court order, 
the mere fact that the court has ordered a competency examination does not affect the status of the defendant, 
whether in custody or not.

7.1.5b  Which Experts May and May Not Be Appointed
Appointed experts may include qualified psychiatrists or psychologists employed by the LMHA or LIDDA. The 
LMHA or LIDDA is entitled to compensation and reimbursement. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.021(e). 

An expert involved in the treatment of the defendant may not be appointed to examine the defendant. Tex. Code 
Crim. Proc. art. 46B.021(c).

7.1.5c  Expert of Defendant’s Own Choice
If a defendant wishes to also be examined by an expert of the defendant’s own choice, the court on timely request 
shall  provide  the  expert  with  reasonable  opportunity  to  examine  the  defendant.  Tex.  Code  Crim.  Proc.  art. 
46B.021(f). 

7.1.5d  Qualifications of Experts
Judges should critically vet the experts they appoint. This minimally entails verifying that an expert meets the 
statutory qualifications prior to appointment. A psychiatrist or psychologist appointed to examine a defendant 
and/or testify regarding competency must generally:

•  be a psychiatrist who is a physician licensed in Texas or a psychologist licensed in Texas who has a doctoral 

degree in psychology;

•  have the following certification or training:

if a psychiatrist, certification by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology with added or special 
qualifications in forensic psychiatry; or

if a psychologist, certification by the American Board of Professional Psychology in forensic psychology; 
or

 ◦

 ◦

 ◦

training consisting of:

•  at least 24 hours of specialized forensic training relating to incompetency or insanity evaluations; and

•  at least eight hours of continuing education relating to forensic evaluations, completed in the 12 months 

preceding the appointment; and

•  have completed six hours of required continuing education in courses in forensic psychiatry or psychology, 

respectively, in either of the reporting periods in the 24 months preceding the appointment.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.022(a)-(b).

146

Appointment of an expert psychiatrist or psychologist who does not meet the above requirements may only occur 
if exigent circumstances require the court to base the appointment on professional training or experience of the 
expert that directly provides the expert with a specialized expertise that would not ordinarily be possessed by a 
psychiatrist or psychologist who meets the above requirements. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.022(c). This is a 
narrow exception. One example is a case in which the defendant not only appeared to lack competency because 
of either MI or IDD, but was also deaf.128 Therefore, the court needed an expert who was knowledgeable about 
the defendant’s hearing disability, but that expert might not have met the statutory requirements for an expert.129 

7.1.5e  Information Provided to Appointed Expert(s)
The movant or other party as directed by the court shall provide to the appointed experts relevant information, 
including copies of the indictment or information, any supporting documents used to establish probable cause 
in the case, and previous mental health evaluation and treatment records. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.021(d).

Competency Exam when a Defendant has, or may have, IDD

One thing to keep in mind for a competency examination, is that if it is believed that the defendant has, or may have, 
IDD, then the type of competency exam given to the defendant must be validated on a subject population that also 
has IDD. Make sure the expert is aware that the defendant has or may have IDD, and when reading the report or 
examining the expert witness, make sure that the property scaled test was used during the examination. Using an 
improperly scaled or validated test may produce an inaccurate result. 

7.1.5f  Factors Considered in Examination
In addition to other  issues determined to  be relevant  by the expert, the following factors  must  be considered 
during a competency examination and in any report based on that examination:

• 

the capacity of the defendant during criminal proceedings to:

 ◦

rationally understand the charges against the defendant and the potential consequences of the pending 
criminal proceedings;

 ◦ disclose to counsel pertinent facts, events, and states of mind;
 ◦ engage in a reasoned choice of legal strategies and options;
 ◦ understand the adversarial nature of criminal proceedings;
 ◦ exhibit appropriate courtroom behavior; and 
 ◦

testify;

•  whether  the  defendant  is  a  person  with  a  MI  or  an  ID,  as  supported  by  current  indications  and  the 

defendant’s personal history;

the degree of impairment resulting from the MI or ID, if existent, and the specific impact on the defendant’s 
capacity to engage with counsel in a reasonable and rational manner; and

if the defendant is taking psychoactive or other medication:

 ◦ whether the medication is necessary to maintain the defendant’s competency; and 
 ◦

the effect, if any, of the medication on the defendant’s appearance, demeanor, or ability to participate 
in the proceedings.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.024.

Beyond 46B: “Miranda Competency”

• 

• 

The standard for competency to stand trial may look different from the competency needed to “knowingly, 
intelligently, and voluntarily, and waive Miranda rights.”130 

This use of the word “intelligently” suggests a cognitive appreciation for what it means to talk to police 
officers and to talk without a lawyer, etc.131 

•  Professor Brian Shannon suggests the level of competency required to competently waive Miranda rights 
is  different  from  the  typical  competency  to  stand  trial  standard.  This  could  potentially  be  brought  up 
in a motion to suppress a client’s statement for not intelligently waiving Miranda, and counsel should 
consider seeking to have the defendant examined not only for competence to stand trial, but also for 
competence to waive Miranda.132

7.1.5g  Expert’s Report
The court shall direct an expert to provide the expert’s report to the court and the appropriate parties in the form 
approved by TCOOMMI under section 614.0032(b) of the Health and Safety Code (see page 149 of this Bench 
Book).133

sis added). See Paul R. S. Burton & John R. Chamberlain, Competence to Waive Miranda Rights, 38 J. aM. aCad. of PSYCH. & l. 280, 282 (2010), http://

waived) from intelligently (understanding the significance of the rights being waived)”.

Additional Required Information in the Expert’s Report

In addition to the factors in article 46B.024 that must be considered during an examination and in any report 
based  on  that  examination,  article  46B.025  requires  specific,  detailed  information  in  the  expert’s  report.  An 
expert’s report must:

state an opinion on a defendant’s competency or incompetency to stand trial (or explain why the expert 
is unable to do so);

identify and address specific issues referred to the expert for evaluation;

•  document that the expert explained to the defendant 

the purpose of the evaluation,

the persons to whom a report on the evaluation is provided, and

the limits on rules of confidentiality applying to the relationship between the expert and the defendant;

specifically describe procedures, techniques, and tests used in the examination, the purpose of each of 
those, and the conclusions reached; 

state the expert’s clinical observations, findings, and opinions on each specific issue referred to the expert 
by the court;

state the specific criteria supporting the expert’s diagnosis; and

state specifically any issues on which the expert could not provide an opinion.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.025(a).

In addition, if it is the opinion of the expert that the defendant is incompetent to proceed, the expert shall state 
in the report:

the symptoms, exact nature, severity, and expected duration of the deficits resulting from the defendant’s 
MI or ID, if any;

the impact of the identified condition on the factors listed in article 46B.024;

•  an  estimate  of  the  period  needed  to  restore  the  defendant’s  competency,  including  whether  the 

defendant is likely to be restored to competency in the foreseeable future; and

•  prospective treatment options, if any, appropriate for the defendant.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.025(b).

Note: Judges should know what to look for in an expert’s report. The court does not have to accept a report that 
does not meet the statutory requirements and/or is of poor quality, but instead can enforce those requirements 
(i.e., by ordering amendment of the report). It is also important to note that the determination of competency or 
incompetency is the role of the judge, a role that should not be abdicated to the expert.134  

134  For an example of a poor examination and report, see Turner v. State, 422 S.W.3d 676 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013).

Beyond Statutory Requirements: Marks of a Quality Expert’s Report135

•  Conveys all relevant information concisely, unambiguously, and clearly, including the facts and reasoning 

the expert used in formulating the opinion.

•  Goes beyond describing signs and symptoms of mental illness and discusses how those signs and symptoms 

affect functional abilities relevant to the legal construct of competence. See section 7.1.1 above. 

•  Describes  the  defendant’s  abilities  and  deficits  concerning  the  tasks  that  the  defendant  must  perform 

during a criminal defense.

Is a stand-alone document in that it provides or reproduces the data needed to support the opinions the 
expert expresses.

States clearly any limitations or qualifications of which the expert is aware.

• 

• 

•  Contains  clinical  data  regarding  the  nature  of  the  defendant’s  mental  and  emotional  condition  that  are 

specifically relevant to the competency analysis.

•  Comments on any contradictions or inconsistencies.

•  Provides specific examples that illustrate the defendant’s strengths or weaknesses with respect to reasoning 

and understanding, based on a competence-assessment instrument as well as other types of data. 

•  Opines concerning restorability and the appropriate setting for restoration.

• 

Is free of gratuitous comments about the defendant’s behavior, need for incapacitation, dangerousness, 
lack of remorse, or other legal matters. 

Expert’s Opinion on Sanity

If it is the opinion of the expert that the defendant is incompetent to proceed to trial, the expert’s report may 
not state  the expert’s opinion on  the defendant’s sanity at  the  time of  the offense. Tex.  Code  Crim.  Proc. art. 
46B.025(c). Though the court may have appointed the expert to examine the defendant for both competency and 
sanity (if the defendant is pursuing the insanity defense), upon a determination of incompetency, the expert must 
stop the examination and not determine sanity. This requirement is rooted in a lack of probative value and ethical 
requirements of psychiatrists and psychologists.136 

The expert’s opinion on the defendant’s competency or incompetency may not be based solely on the defendant’s 
refusal to communicate during the examination. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.025(a-1).

Basis of Expert’s Opinion

Timeline for Expert’s Report

Unless  good  cause  is  shown,  the  expert  is  required  to  provide  the  report  on  the  defendant’s  competency  or 
incompetency to the court, the prosecutor, and the defendant’s attorney not later than the 30th day after the date 
on which the expert was ordered to examine the defendant and prepare the report.137 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 
46B.026(a)-(b).

7.1.5h  Compensation and Reimbursement by the County
The county in which the indictment was returned or information was filed shall pay for the services of an appointed 
expert described by article 46B.021(a)(1) and (2). If the expert is an employee of the LMHA or LIDDA, the county 
shall pay the authority for the services. The county shall also reimburse a facility that accepts a defendant for 
examination for expenses incurred that are reasonably necessary and incidental to the proper examination of the 
defendant. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.027.

Incompetency Trial

7.1.6 
Under article 46B.005(c), the court does not have to hold a trial at all if:

1.  neither party’s counsel requests a trial, 

2.  neither party’s counsel opposes a finding of incompetency, or 

3. 

the court does not decide on its own motion that a trial is necessary. 

The parties and court can agree, based on an expert’s report, that the defendant lacks competency to stand trial. 
In that event, the court shall proceed in the same manner as if a jury had been impaneled and had found the 
defendant incompetent to stand trial. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.054.

2021 Bluntson Decision and Exceptions

Absent the above narrow statutory exceptions, when the trial court determines that there is some evidence that 
the defendant may be incompetent to stand trial, the court must conduct a competency trial even if the court-
appointed expert has concluded that the defendant is competent.139 

Note the 2021 Texas Court of Criminal Appeals opinion on this very issue, where the defendant requested a jury 
trial on the issue of competency and the motion was granted by the trial court: 

“The  use  of  the  word  ‘whether’  [in  art.  46B.005(b)]  indicates  that  the  trial  court  must 
have a competency trial before determining that the defendant is incompetent to stand 
trial or before determining that the defendant is competent to stand trial. Under Article 
46B.051, the trial may be before the court or a jury. But irrespective of who the factfinder 
is, the trial court must have a competency trial. . . . The statute’s plain language indicates 
that the three-part exception in Article 46B.005(c) applies only when the parties and the 
trial court agree that the defendant is incompetent. In other words, after the trial court 
has made the threshold evidentiary determination of “some evidence” of incompetence, 
the  statutory  language  allows  the  trial  court  to  forgo  a  competency  trial  when  both 
parties and the court agree that the defendant is incompetent but not when they agree 
that he is competent.”140

138  This requirement is effective for reports involving defendants charged with an offense committed on or after September 1, 2017. For offens-
es in which any element of the offense was committed before then, the court shall, as soon as practicable after receiving a report, forward the 
report to TCOOMMI.

7.1.6a  Evidence
Notwithstanding Rule 101 of the Texas Rules of Evidence, the Texas Rules of Evidence apply to an incompetency 
trial or other proceeding under Chapter 46B. This is true whether the proceeding is before a jury or the court.

A  defendant  may  be  committed  to  a  jail-based  competency  restoration  program,  mental  health  facility,  or 
residential care facility only on competent medical or psychiatric testimony provided by an expert qualified under 
article 46B.022. The court may allow an expert to substitute the expert’s report under article 46B.025 for such 
required competent testimony. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.074.

7.1.6b  Admissibility of Statements Made During Examination
A statement made by a defendant during an incompetency trial and evidence obtained as a result of that statement 
may not be admitted in evidence against the defendant in any criminal proceeding other than at an incompetency 
trial or if the defendant first introduces the statement into evidence. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.007. 

7.1.6c  Trial Before Judge or Jury
If  a  court  holds  a  trial  to  determine  whether  the  defendant  is  incompetent  to  stand  trial,  a  jury  trial  is  only 
required upon the request of either party or on the motion of the court. If no request or motion is made, the court 
shall make the determination of incompetency. If a jury determination is required, the jury that will determine 
the issue of incompetency must be a different jury from the one selected to determine guilt or innocence. Tex. 
Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.051.

7.1.6d  Jury Verdict
The court shall require the jury determining the issue of incompetency to state in its verdict whether the defendant 
is incompetent to stand trial. The verdict must be concurred in by each juror. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.052.

7.1.6e  Procedure After Finding of Competency
If the court or jury determines that the defendant is competent to stand trial, the court shall continue the trial on 
the merits. If a jury determines that the defendant is competent and the trial on the merits is to be held before a 
jury, the court shall continue the trial on the merits with a different jury selected for that purpose. Tex. Code Crim. 
Proc. art. 46B.053.

7.1.6f Procedure After Finding of Incompetency
If the defendant is found incompetent to stand trial (or if the issue is uncontested, see article 46B.054), the court 
shall proceed under Subchapter D (Procedures After Determination of Incompetency). Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 
46B.055.

7.2.1  Options on Determination of Incompetency

7.2.1a  Defendant is Unlikely to be Restored to Competency in the Foreseeable Future
On a determination that the defendant is unlikely to be restored to competency in the foreseeable future, the 
court shall either:

•  proceed under Subchapter E (Civil Commitment: Charges Pending) or Subchapter F (Civil Commitment: 

Charges Dismissed) of Chapter 46B or

• 

release the defendant on bail as permitted under Chapter 17 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.071(b).

7.2.1b  Determination of Incompetency: Charged with Class B Misdemeanor
Absent a determination in 2.1.1., if the defendant is charged with an offense punishable as a Class B misdemeanor, 
the court shall:

• 

release the defendant on bail under article 46B.0711 (see below) or

141  The court may grant one 60-day extension in connection with the specific offense with which the defendant is charged. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. 
art. 46B.080. See section 7.2.6d below. This extension is subject to the maximum restoration period under article 46B.0095 (see section 7.2.5 below).

155

•  commit the defendant (see below) to

 ◦ a jail-based competency restoration program under article 46B.073(e) or
 ◦ a mental health facility or residential care facility under article 46B.073(f).

Release on Bail for Class B Misdemeanor

Subject  to  conditions  reasonably  related  to  ensuring  public  safety143  and  the  effectiveness  of  the  defendant’s 
treatment, if the court determines: 

• 

that a defendant charged with a Class B misdemeanor and found incompetent to stand trial

is not a danger to others and

 ◦
 ◦ may  be safely treated on an outpatient  basis with the specific objective of attaining competency to 

stand trial, and 

•  an appropriate outpatient program is available for the defendant,144

the court shall:

• 

release the defendant on bail or continue the defendant’s release on bail; and 

•  order the defendant to participate in an outpatient competency restoration program for a period not to 

exceed 60 days.

143  Note that mental illness does not equate with risk of causing harm to the community. Just because a person has a mental illness does not

Despite the requirement for the court to order participation in an outpatient competency restoration program, it 
may only do so if:

• 

the court receives and approves a comprehensive plan that:

 ◦ provides for the treatment of the defendant for purposes of competency restoration; and 
 ◦

identifies the person who will be responsible for providing that treatment; and

• 

the court finds that the treatment proposed by the plan will be available to and will be provided to the 
defendant.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.0711(c).

The court  may also require  the defendant  to participate  in  (1) an outpatient competency restoration program 
administered by a community center or any other entity that provides competency restoration services and an 
appropriate prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric, or psychological care or treatment.145  Tex. Code Crim. 
Proc. art. 46B.0711(d).

Note: Article 46B.0711 only applies to defendants who are subject to an initial restoration period based on article 
46B.071.

Housing and Transportation

Defendants released to the community for purposes of outpatient restoration treatment need stable housing. 
The  court  should  consider  verifying  that  the  defendant  has  stable  housing  prior  to  ordering  commitment. 
Consideration needs to be made for defendants who are homeless or are unable to live independently as to 
what kind of setting would provide stability. If a defendant lacks the willingness and/or ability to manage his or 
her  medications,  he  or  she  needs  to  reside  where  a  responsible  person  can  manage  medications.  (Note  that 
for persons ordered to outpatient restoration, the law is inconsistent related to whether a court is authorized 
to  order  forced  medication  (i.e.,  article  46B.086(a)(2)(D)  of  the  Texas  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  and  section 
574.106(a) of the Texas Health and Safety Code.))146 To ensure timely arrival at treatment, defendants also need 
transportation to the facility. This could be provided by a family member or facility staff.

Floyd L. Jennings, Statutory Changes Regarding Mentally Ill Defendants, Voice for the Defense Online (October 31, 
2017).

145  See section 7.2.8 below.

146  Under Texas law, there are two provisions authorizing a court to compel a defendant to take medication: article 46B.086 of the Texas Code  
of Criminal Procedure and section 574.106 of the Texas Health and Safety Code. See section 7.2.8b below and Intercept 0, section 3.4 of this 
Bench Book respectively. Beware that section 574.106 does not authorize such orders for defendants receiving treatment or services on an 
outpatient basis (including outpatient competency restoration). Article 46B.086(a)(2)(D), however, makes such orders applicable to defendants 
charged with a Class A misdemeanor or felony and committed to an outpatient competency restoration program (note that article 46B.086(a)(3) 
also mentions an outpatient restoration program). Practically, enforcement of that order would likely require modification of the order to an  
inpatient or jail-based setting and trigger concerns related to clinical impropriety and constitutional safeguards. Note that Sell v. U.S., 539 U.S. 
166 (2003) requires a hearing that addresses certain factors prior to ordering forcible administration of medication to a criminal defendant 
found incompetent to stand trial (see also article 46B.086(e) and section 574.106(b)). For a detailed discussion of these provisions and the history 
of the forced medication statutes, see Brian D. Shannon, Prescribing a Balance: The Texas Legislative Responses to Sell v. United States,  
41 ST. MarY’S l.J. 309 (2009).

157

Commitment for Restoration to Competency: Charged with Class B Misdemeanor

For defendants not released on bail, the court shall commit a defendant charged with a Class B misdemeanor 
to a jail-based competency restoration program for a period of not more than 60 days. Such commitment is for 
purposes of further examination and competency restoration services with the specific objective of the defendant 
attaining competency to stand trial. It is also dependent on the determination of the program provider that the 
defendant will begin to receive competency restoration services within 72 hours of arriving at the program.147 If a 
jail-based competency restoration program is not available or a licensed or qualified mental health professional 
determines  that  a  jail-based  competency  restoration  program  is  not  appropriate,  then  the  defendant  may  be 
committed to a mental health facility or residential care facility determined to be appropriate by the LMHA or 
LIDDA. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.073.

Note: Article 46B.073 only applies to defendants who are subject to an initial restoration period based on article 
46B.071.

Jail-Based Competency Restoration Programs

Articles  46B.090  and  46B.091  respectively  authorize  the  HHSC  as  well  as  counties  to  operate  a  jail-based 
competency restoration (JBCR) program. Chapter 416, Subchapter C, Title 25 of the Texas Administrative Code 
provides the rules for such programs. Article 46B.091 requires counties seeking to operate a jail-based program 
to do so in a designated space that is separate from the space used for the general population of the jail and to 
provide services similar to other competency restoration programs (among other requirements).148

7.2.1c  Determination of Incompetency: Charged with Felony or Class A Misdemeanor  

Absent a determination in 2.1.1., if the defendant is charged with an offense punishable as a Class A misdemeanor 
or any higher category of offense, the court shall:

• 

release the defendant on bail under article 46B.072 (see below) or

•  commit the defendant to a facility or a jail-based competency restoration program under article 46B.073(c) 

or (d) (see below).

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.071(a).

147  Inherent in this requirement is the desire to quickly begin competency restoration services in lieu of waiting for a bed in a state hospital. 
Delaying such services after the court orders commitment to a JBCR is inconsistent with the statute and the intent of the program itself.

Legislative Change

S.B.  49  (87th  Reg.  Sess.  (2021)),  effective  September  1,  2021,  added  Tex.  Crim  Proc.  art.  46B.075 
to clarify when competency restoration orders technically begin. 

The initial restoration period for a defendant under Article 46B.0711, 46B.072, or 46B.073 begins on the later of: 

1.

the date the defendant is:

A. ordered to participate in an outpatient competency restoration program; or

B.

committed to a mental health facility, residential care facility, or jail-based competency restoration
program; or

2.

the date competency restoration services actually begin.

S.B. 49 (87th Reg. Sess. (2021)), also amended Tex. Crim Proc. art. 46B.080 to clarify when an extension of competency 
restoration orders technically begins.

(d) An extension under this article begins on the later of:

the date the court enters the order under Subsection (a); or

1)

2)

the date competency restoration services actually begin pursuant to the order entered under
Subsection (a).

These additions promote consistency and assist in determining the period of competency restoration. 

152  For the commitment of a defendant under Chapter 46B, article 46B.0021 provides that HHSC may only designate a facility operated by HHSC 
or under a contract with HHSC for that purpose.

160

Practical Issues Ordering Competency Restoration

Some  judges  have  asked  what  the  order  should  say  to  give  HHSC  authority  to  designate  which  facility  to  send 
a defendant to. Consider tracking the language of the statute (i.e., “to a facility designated by HHSC”). Doing so 
comports  with  the  legislative  intent  of  the  statute  and  also  allows  greater  flexibility  for  HHSC  with  defendants 
initially required to go to a MSU. Another suggestion is including language that HHSC will designate a facility within 
three days after receiving the information required by article 46B.076 (see section 7.2.4 below). The order could 
also designate a specific person to email HHSC with that information at forensicadmissions@hhsc.state.

Though some judges have indicated a desire to wait for the designation prior to ordering commitment, it is important 
to remember that a person is not placed on HHSC’s waiting list until they receive an order, so waiting would create 
a delay in the defendant’s transfer to an inpatient facility and in the case itself. However, it is incumbent on the 
state hospital system to keep the courts and other parties informed as to where the defendant is to be taken for 
initial admission as well as keeping them informed of any internal transfer within the state hospital system.

The waiting list for MSU beds creates another issue. Before the 2019 legislative changes, some judges would order 
a defendant committed to a MSU as required by article 46B.073 and subsequently ordered that defendant to a 
JBCR program while he or she waited in jail for a bed at the MSU. Article 46B.073 neither authorizes nor prohibits 
this  practice.  The  amended  language  in  46B.073  is  likewise  silent  as  to  whether  a  judge  may,  after  ordering  a 
defendant to a facility designated by HHSC, order a defendant to a JBCR while he or she waits for transfer to the 
designated facility.

7.2.2  Transportation to Facility or Program

An order issued under article 46B.0711, 46B.072, or 46B.073 must place the defendant in the custody of the sheriff 
or sheriff’s deputy for transportation to the facility or program, as applicable, in which the defendant is to receive 
competency restoration services. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.075.

Immediate Restoration  

7.2.3 
At any time after the defendant’s incompetency trial, but before the defendant is transported to the facility or 
program, if the court receives credible evidence indicating that the defendant has been restored to competency, 
the  court  may  appoint  disinterested  experts  to  reexamine  the  defendant  (see  section  7.1.5  above).  The  court 
is not required to appoint the same expert who performed the initial examination. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 
46B.0755(a). 

Note: HHSC State Hospital’s Forensic Services has two clinicians on staff that can be appointed as the expert on 
the re-examination of a defendant.

If after reexamination, the expert’s report states an opinion that the defendant remains incompetent, the court’s 
order (to release the defendant on bail and order outpatient services or commit the defendant) remains in effect 
and the defendant shall  be transported to the  facility or program.  If after reexamination, the report states an 
opinion that the defendant has been restored to competency, the court shall withdraw its order and shall either:

•  find the defendant competent to stand trial and proceed as if the defendant had been found restored to 

competency at a hearing if:

 ◦ both parties agree that the defendant is competent to stand trial; and
 ◦

the court concurs; and

•  hold a hearing to determine whether the defendant has been restored to competency if any party fails to 

agree or if the court fails to concur.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.0755(b).

If  the court  holds a  hearing,  incompetency  is  presumed, and  the defendant’s competency  must  be  proved  by 
a  preponderance  of  the  evidence.  If  requested  by  either  party,  or  upon  the  court’s  motion,  a  jury  shall  make 
the competency determination. If after the hearing, the defendant is again found to be incompetent, the court 
shall issue a new order under article 46B.0711, 46B.072, or 46B.073 (to release the defendant on bail and order 
outpatient services or commit the defendant). Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.0755(c), (d).

7.2.4  Copy of Order and Transcript of Medical Testimony to Applicable Facility or Program
Not later than the date of the order of commitment or of release on bail, the court shall send a copy of the order 
to the applicable facility or program as well as the following documents made available to the court during the 
incompetency trial:

reports of each expert;

psychiatric, psychological, or social work reports that relate to the mental condition of the defendant;

documents provided by the prosecutor or the defense attorney that relate to the defendant’s current or
past mental condition;

copies of the indictment or information and any supporting documents used to establish probable cause
in the case;

the defendant’s criminal history record; and

the addresses of the prosecutor and defense attorney.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.076(a).

7.2.5 

Maximum Period of Commitment or Program Participation Determined by Maximum Term 
 
for Offense 

7.2.5a  Maximum Restoration Period Under Chapter 46B
The  total  time a defendant can  spend  in  incompetency  proceedings and  related  pre-trial  transfers  is  limited. 
Under Chapter 46B, a defendant generally may not be 

committed to a mental hospital or other inpatient or residential facility or to a jail-based competency
restoration program,

ordered to participate in an outpatient competency restoration or treatment program, or

subjected to any combination of inpatient treatment, outpatient competency restoration or treatment
program  participation,  or  jail-based  competency  restoration  for  a  cumulative  period  that  exceeds  the
maximum term153 provided by law for the offense for which the defendant was to be tried.

If  the  defendant  is  charged  with  a  misdemeanor  and  has  been  ordered  only  to  participate  in  an  outpatient 
competency  restoration  or  treatment  program  under  Subchapter  D  (Procedures  After  Determination  of 
Incompetency) or E (Civil Commitment: Charges Pending) of Chapter 46B, the maximum period of restoration 
is two years (but see also section 7.2.5d below regarding mandatory dismissal of misdemeanor charges).

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.0095.

153  The court must credit to the cumulative period any time that a defendant, following arrest for the offense for which the defendant was to 

be tried, is confined in a correctional facility, as defined by section 1.07 of the Texas Penal Code, before the initial order of commitment or 

initial order for outpatient competency restoration or treatment program participation is entered under Chapter 46B. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 

46B.0095(d). In addition to this time credit, the court has discretion to credit to the cumulative period any good conduct time the defendant may 

have been granted under article 42.032 in relation to the defendant’s confinement as described by article 46B.0095(d). Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 
46B.0095(e). Maximum term is determined by punishment range of the offense charged not including enhancements due to prior 

convictions. Ex Parte Reinke, 370 S.W.3d 387 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012).

162

7.2.5b  Expiration of the Maximum Restoration Period154
On  expiration  of  the  maximum  restoration  period  (see  section  7.2.5a  above),  the  mental  hospital,  facility,  or 
program  provider  identified  in  the  most  recent  order  of  commitment  or  order  of  outpatient  competency 
restoration under Chapter 46B shall assess the defendant to determine if civil proceedings under Subtitle C (Texas 
Mental Health Code) or D (Persons with Intellectual Disability Act), Title 7 of the Texas Health and Safety Code 
are appropriate. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.0095(b).

If  the  defendant  is  still  in  need  of  commitment  for  mental  health  treatment  after  the  maximum  restoration 
period expires, that can only happen through civil commitment proceedings. The criminal court can no longer be 
involved. Specifically, the defendant may be confined for an additional period in a mental hospital or other facility 
or may be ordered to participate for an additional period in an outpatient treatment program, as appropriate, only 
pursuant to proceedings conducted under Subtitle C (Texas Mental Health Code) or D (Persons with Intellectual 
Disability Act), Title 7 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, by a court with probate jurisdiction. Tex. Code Crim. 
Proc. art. 46B.0095(b).

In Texas, probate jurisdiction varies from county to county. The following are general guidelines:

Probate Jurisdiction in Texas

• 

• 

• 

If the county has a statutory probate court, that court generally has original and exclusive jurisdiction over 
any  probate  proceeding  (exceptions  exist  not  relating  to  mental  health  civil  commitments).  Tex.  Estates 
Code §§ 32.002(c), 32.005.

If the county has no statutory probate court but has a county court at law exercising probate jurisdiction, 
that court and the county court have concurrent original jurisdiction, unless otherwise provided by law. Tex. 
Estates Code § 32.002(b).

If the county neither has a statutory probate court nor a county court at law exercising probate jurisdiction, 
the county court has original probate jurisdiction. Tex. Estates Code § 32.002(a). However, that court can (or 
may be required to) transfer contested cases to a district court or request assignment of a probate judge. 
Tex. Estates Code § 32.003.

See Title 2, Subtitle A, Chapter 25, Subchapter C of the Texas Government Code to see if your county has any 
county courts at law or a statutory probate court. Confer with the judge presiding over the court to determine  
if  that  court  is  the  appropriate  one  for  civil  commitment  proceedings.  See  also  Intercept  0,  section  3.1  of  this 
Bench Book.

7.2.5c  Cumulative Period155 

The cumulative period that cannot exceed the maximum restoration period (see section 7.2.5a above):

•  begins on the date the initial order of commitment or initial order for outpatient competency restoration 

or treatment program participation is entered under Chapter 46B and

• 

includes 

 ◦ any inpatient or outpatient competency restoration periods or program participation periods ordered 
under Chapter 46B and additional periods pursuant to civil proceedings conducted under Subtitle C 
(Texas Mental Health Code) or D (Persons with Intellectual Disability Act), Title 7 of the Texas Health 
and Safety Code, and

154  Id.

155  Id.

163

 ◦ any time that, following the entry of an order of commitment or program participation under Chapter 
46B, the defendant is confined in a correctional facility,156 or is otherwise in the custody of the sheriff 
during or while awaiting: 

• 

the defendant’s transfer to:

 ◦ a mental hospital or other inpatient or residential facility; or
 ◦ a jail-based competency restoration program;

• 

the  defendant’s  release  on  bail  to  participate  in  an  outpatient  competency  restoration  or  treatment 
program; or

•  a criminal trial following any temporary restoration of the defendant’s competency to stand trial.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.0095(c).

The court  shall credit  to  the cumulative  period any  time  that a defendant  following arrest  for  the offense  for 
which the defendant was to be tried, is confined in a correctional facility157 before the initial order of commitment 
or initial order for outpatient competency restoration or treatment program participation under Chapter 46B.  
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.0095(d).

The court may credit to the cumulative period any good conduct time the defendant may have been granted under 
article 42.032 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure in relation to the defendant’s confinement in a correctional 
facility158 before the initial order of commitment or initial order for outpatient competency restoration or treatment 
program participation under Chapter 46B. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.0095(e).

7.2.5d  Mandatory Dismissal of Misdemeanor Charges  
If both of the following occur, and the prosecutor files a motion to dismiss the charge, the court shall dismiss the 
charge:

•  a  court,  under  Chapter  46B,  orders  that  a  defendant  charged  with  a  misdemeanor  punishable  by 

confinement be

restoration program, 

 ◦ committed to a mental hospital or other inpatient or residential facility or to a jail-based competency 

 ◦ ordered to participate in an outpatient competency restoration or treatment program, or
 ◦

subjected to any combination of inpatient treatment, outpatient competency restoration or treatment 
program participation, or jail-based competency restoration, and

• 

the defendant is not tried before the expiration of the maximum restoration period (see section 7.2.5b 
above).

Alternatively, if the prosecutor does not file a motion to dismiss and the defendant’s attorney files a motion for a 
hearing, the court shall, after sending notice to the prosecutor, hold a hearing not later than the 10th day after the 
date of filing of the motion, and may dismiss the charge on a finding that the defendant was not tried before the 
maximum restoration period expired. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.010.

7.2.6  Post-Release-on-Bail and Post-Commitment Procedures

7.2.6a  Charges Subsequently Dismissed
If the charges pending against a defendant are dismissed, the court that issued the order under article 46B.0711, 
46B.072, or 46B.073 (to release the defendant on bail and order outpatient services or commit the defendant) shall 
send a copy of the order of dismissal to the sheriff of the county in which the court is located and to the head of 
the facility, provider of the jail-based competency restoration program, or provider of the outpatient competency 
restoration program.  Once received, the facility or program shall discharge the defendant  into the care of the 
sheriff or sheriff’s deputy for transportation back to the court in the same manner as article 46B.082.159 Tex. Code 
Crim. Proc. art. 46B.078 (see section 7.2.6f of below).

7.2.6b  Individual Treatment Program and Reporting by Facility or Program
The facility or jail-based competency restoration program to which the defendant is committed or the outpatient 
competency restoration program to which the defendant is released on bail shall:

•  develop an individual program of treatment;

•  assess and evaluate whether the defendant is likely to be restored to competency in the foreseeable future; 

and

• 

report to the court and the LMHA or LIDDA on the defendant’s progress toward achieving competency.

The  above  reporting  requirements  (under  article  46B.077)  are  different  depending  on  the  type  of  facility  the 
defendant is in. If the defendant is in an inpatient mental health facility, residential care facility, or jail-based 
competency  restoration  program,  the  facility  or  program  shall  report  to  the  court  at  least  once  during  the 
commitment period.  If the defendant  is  in an outpatient competency restoration program, the program shall 
report to the court:

•  not later than the 14th day after the date services begin; and

•  at least once during each 30-day period following the date of that first report, until the defendant is no 

longer released to the program.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.077.

For jail-based competency restoration programs, this reporting requirement is distinct from and in addition to 
the requirement in article 46B.090(i) that the psychiatrist for the provider (1) conduct at least two full psychiatric 
evaluations of the defendant during the period the defendant receives competency restoration services  in the 
jail (one not later than the 21st day and one not later than the 55th day after the date the defendant begins to 
participate in the program) and (2) submit to the court a report concerning each evaluation.

Note:  If  issues  with  treatment  arise,  consider  utilizing  defense  counsel  and  the  provider  to  encourage  the 
defendant to comply with the treatment plan.

159  This provision may be problematic in practice. Upon dismissal of charges, the court will no longer have jurisdiction. A sheriff may be hesitant 
to transport a defendant, possibly from a different county, with no charges pending. The use of restraints would also be an issue. Additionally, if 
the person was returned and the court was not open, there would be no basis for booking such person into the jail. If the person is still incom-
petent, article 46B.151 permits the court to retain jurisdiction after dismissal to transfer the matter to a court with mental health jurisdiction and 
hold the defendant in jail briefly pending initiation of civil commitment proceedings. This would not apply to a person who has not been ordered 
to civil commitment proceedings (for example, a person restored to competency after the maximum period for restoration has expired). For a 
person not so ordered, consider transporting the defendant to the county of origin before charges are dismissed. Floyd L. Jennings, Statutory 
Changes Regarding Mentally Ill Defendants (October 31, 2017), http://www.voiceforthedefenseonline.com/story/statutory-changes-regarding-men-

7.2.6c  Notice to Court Before Expiration of Initial Restoration Period
Not later than the 15th day before the date the initial restoration period expires according to the terms of the order, 
the maximum restoration period (see section 7.2.5 above), or other applicable provisions of Chapter 46B, the head 
of the facility or program provider shall notify the applicable court that the period is about to expire.160 

If  the  defendant  is  in  an  inpatient  mental  health  facility,  residential  care  facility,  or  jail-based  competency 
restoration program, the head of the facility or program provider shall promptly notify the court upon belief that:

the defendant is clinically ready and can be safely transferred to a competency restoration program for
education services but has not yet attained competency to stand trial;

the defendant has attained competency to stand trial; or

the defendant is not likely to attain competency in the foreseeable future.

If the defendant is in an outpatient competency restoration program, the provider shall promptly notify the court 
when the program provider believes that:

the defendant has attained competency to stand trial; or

the defendant is not likely to attain competency in the foreseeable future.

Along with any of the above notices, the head of the facility or program provider also shall file a final report with 
the court stating the reason for the proposed discharge or transfer under Chapter 46B and including a list of the 
types and dosages of medications prescribed for the defendant while the defendant was receiving competency 
restoration services in the facility or through the program.  

The court shall provide  to  the prosecutor and defense attorney copies of  the  final report, unless  the report  is 
based on notice that the defendant is clinically ready and can be safely transferred to a competency restoration 
program for education services but has not yet attained competency to stand trial. This enables any objection to 
the findings of the report to be made in a timely manner as required under article 46B.084(a-1).

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.079.

7.2.6d  Extension of Order
If the head of the facility or program provider notifies the court that the initial restoration period is about to 
expire, the notice may contain a request for an extension of the period for an additional period of 60 days and an 
explanation for the basis of the request, which must include a description of any evidence indicating a reduction 
in the severity of the defendant’s symptoms or impairment. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.079(d).

On such a request, the court may enter an order extending the initial restoration period for an additional period 
of 60 days, but only if the court determines that:

the defendant has not attained competency; and

an  extension  of  the  initial  restoration  period  will  likely  enable  the  facility  or  program  to  restore  the
defendant to competency within the period of the extension.

The court may grant only one 60-day extension in connection with the specific offense with which the defendant 
is charged. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.080.

Note:  This  extension  is  subject  to  the  maximum  restoration  period  under  article  46B.0095  (see  section  7.2.5 
above).

7.2.6e  Competency Restoration Education Services
If the court receives notice that the defendant is clinically ready and can be safely transferred to a competency 
restoration program for education services but has not yet attained competency to stand trial (see section 7.2.6c 

160  There has been confusion regarding when the term of a restoration begins, i.e., the date of the order or the date of transfer. This issue was 
recently clarified with S.B. 49 (87th Reg. Sess. (2021)). See the explanation of this legislative change in the Legislative Change box on page 160. 

166

above), the court shall order the defendant to receive competency restoration education services in a jail-based 
competency restoration program or an outpatient competency restoration program, as appropriate and if available.

If the defendant was not committed to a jail-based competency restoration program, the court shall send a copy 
of the order for education services to:

the sheriff of the county in which the court is located;

• 

• 

• 

the LMHA or LIDDA.

the head of the facility to which the defendant was committed for competency restoration; and

Once the head of facility receives the copy of the order, as soon as practicable, but not later than the 10th day after 
such receipt, the facility shall discharge the defendant into the care of the sheriff of the county in which the court 
is located or into the care of the sheriff’s deputy.  The sheriff or sheriff’s deputy shall transport the defendant to 
the jail-based competency restoration program or outpatient competency restoration program, as appropriate.

A  jail-based  competency  restoration  program  or  outpatient  competency  restoration  program  that  receives  a 
defendant for competency restoration education services shall give to the court:

•  notice regarding the defendant’s entry into the program for purposes of receiving competency restoration 

education services; and

• 

subsequent notice as otherwise required under article 46B.079.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.0805.

7.2.6f  Transportation of Defendant to Court
If the sheriff receives notice that the charges have been dismissed (see section 7.2.6b above), the sheriff of the 
county in which the court is located or the sheriff’s deputy shall transport the defendant to the court.

If the court receives notification under article 46B.079(a), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b-1) (see section 7.2.6c above), and 
before  the  15th  day  after  receiving  such  notice,  a  defendant  committed  to  a  facility  or  jail-based  competency 
restoration program or ordered to participate  in an outpatient competency restoration program  has  not  been 
transported back to the court, the head of the facility or program provider shall cause the defendant to be promptly 
transported to the court and placed in the custody of the sheriff of the county in which the court is located.161   

The county in which the court is located shall reimburse HHSC or the program provider, as appropriate, for the 
mileage and per diem expenses of the personnel required to transport the defendant, calculated in accordance 
with rates provided in the General Appropriations Act for state employees.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.082.

7.2.6g  Supporting Commitment Information Provided by Facility or Program
If the head of the facility, the jail-based competency restoration program provider, or the outpatient competency 
restoration program provider believes that the defendant is a person with MI and meets the criteria for court-
ordered mental health services under Subtitle C, Title 7 of the Texas Health and Safety Code (Texas Mental Health 
Code), the head of the facility or the program provider shall submit to the court a CME for mental illness.

If the head of the facility, the jail-based competency restoration program provider, or the outpatient competency 
restoration program provider believes that the defendant is a person with an ID, the head of the facility or the 
program provider shall have submitted to the court an affidavit stating the conclusions reached as a result of the 
examination.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.083.

161  In practice, this provision is problematic. State hospitals might not have personnel to transport a defendant to the committing county. Addi-
tionally, a sheriff might not accept the defendant into custody without a warrant.

7.2.6h  Proceedings After the Defendant Returns to Court

Timelines for Notice and Competency Determination After the Defendant Returns to Court

After the defendant returns to court, the court is required to send notice to the prosecutor and defense attorney 
and again make a determination regarding the defendant’s competency to stand trial. The timeline for each of 
those requirements depends on the population of the county.

The court must send notice:

•  no  later  than  the  next  business  day  following  the  date  of  the  defendant’s  return  if  the  county  has  a 

population of one million or more and less than four million.

•  as soon as practicable following the date of the defendant’s return if the county has a population of less 

than one million or four million or more.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.084(a).

The court must make the competency determination:

•  not later than the 20th day after the date on which the court received the applicable notice under article 
46B.079, or not later than the fifth day after the date of the defendant’s return to court, whichever occurs 
first if the county has a population of one million or more and less than four million.

•  not later than the 20th day after the date on which the court received notification under article 46B.079 if 

the county has a population of less than one million or four million or more.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.084(a-1).

Case Management

In addition to creating a mental health or competency docket, one important action a judge can take in managing 
cases involving competency is to advance the date for hearings at every stage of the process. As soon as the 
competency examination is complete and the report is filed, it is a best practice for the court to hear the matter. 
Likewise, once a defendant is restored to competency, it is best for the court to set the hearing. Court staff can 
flag such cases to facilitate this. Promptly address the matter if the defendant begins to decompensate or stops 
taking his or her medications.

Judge William F. Dressel (Ret.) and Daphne A. Burns, The National Judicial College and the Mental Competency 
Best Practices Model, The Judges’ Journal, Vol. 51 No. 2 (Spring 2012).

Defense Attorney Confers with Defendant

Upon receiving notice from the court, the defense attorney must meet and confer with the defendant to evaluate 
whether there is any suggestion that the defendant has not yet regained competency. This must be done:

•  within three business days of the date he or she receives the notice, or a later date specified by the court on 
a showing of good cause, if the county has a population of one million or more and less than four million.

•  as soon as practicable after the date of receipt of that notice, if the county has a population of less than 

one million or four million or more.

Legislative Change
2021 Updates to the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct 
Effective July 1, 2021

Rule 1.16 Clients with Diminished Capacity

Before  the  2021  changes,  the  rule  titled  Client  Under  a  Disability,  did  not  recognize  a  legitimate 
attorney client relationship between an attorney and an individual with a disability.162 

The updated rule requires that the lawyer shall, as far as reasonably possible, maintain a normal 

client-lawyer relationship with the client, even if that client has diminished capacity. 

“The fact that a client suffers from diminished capacity does not diminish the lawyer’s obligation to treat the 
client with attention and respect” and maintain communication with the client. Additionally, although the client 
may wish to have other individuals participate in conversations with the lawyer, this rule “(a) requires the lawyer 
to keep the client’s interests foremost and, except when taking protective action authorized by paragraph (b), to 
look to the client, not the family members or other persons, to make decisions on the client’s behalf.”

Note that even if the lawyer believes the client is not competent and is receiving competency restoration services, 
the lawyer must continue to endeavor to communicate with the client regarding the case.

The new rule is somewhat comparable to a lawyer’s statutory duties in civil commitment matters as set forth in 
Section 574.004, Tex. Health & Safety Code. See supra Subsection 3.3.6b.

Texas Disciplinary Rule of Professional Conduct 1.16. 

Basis of Competency Determination After Defendant Returns to Court

When the court makes its competency determination, it may only be based on: 

• 

the most recent report from the facility or provider (see article 46B.079(c)); 

•  notice  under  article  46B.079  (except  notice  that  the  defendant  is  clinically  ready  and  can  be  safely 
transferred  to  a  competency  restoration  program  for  education  services  but  has  not  yet  attained 
competency to stand trial); and

•  other medical information or personal history information relating to the defendant.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.084(a-1)(1).

Objection to Report and Hearing

A party may object in writing or in open court to the findings of the most recent report not later than the 15th 
day after the date on which the court received the applicable notice under article 46B.079. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. 
art. 46B.084(a-1)(1). If a party objects, the court shall hold a hearing on the issue, which shall be before the court 
unless the defendant, defense counsel, or prosecutor makes a motion for a jury trial. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 
46B.084(b).

If the hearing is before the court, the hearing may be conducted by means of an electronic broadcast system as 
provided by article 46B.013.  Notwithstanding any other provision of Chapter 46B, the defendant is not required 
to be returned to the court for the hearing. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.084(b-1).

An  objection  and  hearing  do  not  affect  the  timelines  for  the  court’s  determination  of  competency  after  the 
defendant returns to court. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.084(a-1).

162  Previous Rule stated: “Client Under a Disability 12. Paragraph (a) assumes that the lawyer is legally authorized to represent the client. The 
usual attorney-client relationship is established and maintained by consenting adults who possess the legal capacity to agree to the relationship. 
Sometimes the relationship can be established only by a legally effective appointment of the lawyer to represent a person. Unless the lawyer is 
legally authorized to act for a person under a disability, an attorney-client relationship does not exist for the purpose of this rule.”

169

Note:  Though  Chapter  46B  does  not  authorize  a  new  evaluation  under  these  circumstances,  it  is  something 
the court  may want  to consider;  however, doing so  may  prevent  the court  from  making  the determination of 
competency within the time constraints in article 46B.084(a-1). 

Defendant Determined Competent to Stand Trial

If the defendant is found competent to stand trial, on the court’s own motion criminal proceedings in the case 
against the defendant shall be resumed:

•  not later than the 14th day after the date of the court’s determination that the defendant’s competency has 

been restored, if the county has a population of one million or more and less than four million.

•  as soon as practicable after the date of the court’s determination that the defendant’s competency has 

been restored, if the county has a population of less than one million or four million or more.

The criminal case itself does not have to be finally resolved within any specified period.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.084(d), (d-1).

Trial Preference

The trial of a criminal action against a defendant who has been determined to be restored to competency under 
article 46B.084 shall be given preference over other matters before the court, whether civil or criminal (except 
the trial of a criminal action in which the alleged victim is younger than 14 years of age). Tex. Code Crim. Proc. 
art. 32A.01.

Defendant Determined Incompetent to Stand Trial

If the defendant  is  found  incompetent to stand trial and  if all charges pending against the defendant are  not 
dismissed, the court shall proceed under Subchapter E (Civil Commitment: Charges Pending). Tex. Code Crim. 
Proc. art. 46B.084(e).

If the defendant is found incompetent to stand trial and if all charges pending against the defendant are dismissed, 
the court shall proceed under Subchapter F (Civil Commitment: Charges Dismissed). Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 
46B.084(f).

7.2.7  Subsequent Restoration Periods and Extensions Prohibited
The court may order only one initial period of restoration and one extension under Subchapter D in connection 
with the same offense. After an  initial restoration period and an extension are ordered, any subsequent court 
orders  for  treatment  must  be  issued  under  Subchapter  E  (Civil  Commitment:  Charges  Pending)  or  F  (Civil 
Commitment: Charges Dismissed). Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.085.

Restored Defendants Who Decompensate

Defendants restored to competency often decompensate after returning to jail due to refusal to take medications, 
denial of medications, or provision of less effective substitute medications (see section 7.2.8a below regarding 
the requirement to provide the types and dosages of medication prescribed for the defendant). In light of the 
prohibition of subsequent restoration periods or extensions, courts and counsel may consider instituting forced 
medication proceedings (see section 7.2.8b below; however this would not address the problem of providing less 
effective substitute medications and assumes a court has not already issued an order compelling medication 
under section 574.106 of the Health and Safety Code, which would continue to be in effect at the jail as provided 
by section 574.110, or under article 46B.086 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, which has no statutory 
expiration date). If that fails, civil commitment under article 46B.102 is the only option. Therefore, it is important 
to adhere to the timelines in article 46B.084 (see section 7.2.6h of above).

7.2.8  Medication

Legislative Change

S.B. 49 (87th Reg. Sess. (2021)) amended Tex. Gov’t Code § 511.009(d) to require a prisoner with a 
mental illness be provided with each prescription medication that a qualified medical professional 
or mental health professional determines is necessary for the care, treatment, or stabilization of 
the prisoner. 

7.2.8a  Administration of Medication While in Custody of the Sheriff
A  sheriff  or  sheriff’s deputy  having custody  of a  defendant  for  transportation  as  required  by article  46B.0805 
or  46B.082  or  during  proceedings  described  by  article  46B.084  (see  section  7.2.6h  above)  shall,  according  to 
information available at the time and unless directed otherwise by a physician treating the defendant, ensure that 
the defendant is provided with the types and dosages of medication prescribed for the defendant.

This requirement is dependent on whether funds are appropriated for that purpose. If funds are appropriated, 
the sheriff is required to provide the medication as described and is entitled to reimbursement from the state 
for  providing  it.  If  funds  are  not  appropriated  to  reimburse  the  sheriff,  the  sheriff  is  not  required  to  provide 
medication.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.0825.

7.2.8b  Court-ordered Medications
If a defendant, after being restored to competency at a treatment facility, refuses to take the medication prescribed 
as part of the defendant’s individualized plan after returning to the jail to await further criminal proceedings, the 
defendant may again become incompetent. Article 46B.086 provides procedure for a court to compel a defendant 
to take medication to maintain competency for trial.163 In addition, since 2009 the statute has permitted judicial 
consideration of court-ordered  medications  for a defendant who  has remained  in  jail  for  more than  72  hours 
following a finding of incompetency to stand trial, but before a transfer to a facility or program for competency 
restoration services.164  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.086(a)(2)(A).

Court-ordered medications for 46B defendants are a bifurcated, two-step process. Before a criminal court can 
conduct a  medication  hearing under article  46B.086, there  must first  be a threshold  medication  hearing  by a 
court with probate jurisdiction under Chapter 574, Subchapter G (MI) or Chapter 592, Subchapter F (IDD) of the 
Texas Health and Safety Code, as appropriate. If the probate court determines that the defendant does not meet 
the criteria for court-ordered medication (in sections 574.106 or 592.156 of the Texas Health and Safety Code), the 
prosecutor may then seek an order for the administration of medication under article 46B.086.

Required Criteria of Defendant for Applicability of Article 46B.086

Article 46B.086 (Court-ordered Medications) applies to a defendant:

•  who is determined under Chapter 46B to be incompetent to stand trial;

•  who is one of the following:

 ◦

remains confined in a correctional facility, as defined by section 1.07 of the Texas Penal Code, for a 
period exceeding 72 hours while awaiting transfer to an inpatient mental health facility, a residential 
care facility, or an outpatient competency restoration program;165 

163  For a detailed discussion of the history of the forced medication statutes, see Brian D. Shannon, Prescribing a Balance: The Texas Legislative 
Responses to Sell v. United States, 41 St. MarY’S l.J. 309 (2009).

165  For a defendant meeting this criterion, an order issued under article 46B.086: (1) authorizes the initiation of any appropriate mental health 
treatment for the defendant awaiting transfer; and (2) does not constitute authorization to retain the defendant in a correctional facility for 
competency restoration treatment. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.086(g).

171

◦

◦

◦

is committed to an inpatient mental health facility, a residential care facility, or a jail-based competency 
restoration program for the purpose of competency restoration;

is confined in a correctional facility while awaiting further criminal proceedings following competency
restoration; or

is subject to article 46B.072, if the court has made the determinations required by subsection (a-1) of
that article;

•

for whom a correctional facility or jail-based competency restoration program that employs or contracts
with a licensed psychiatrist, an inpatient mental health facility, a residential care facility, or an outpatient 
competency  restoration  program  provider  has  prepared  a  continuity  of  care  plan  that  requires  the
defendant to take psychoactive medications; and

• who, after a hearing held under section 574.106 or 592.156 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, if applicable,
has been found to not meet the criteria prescribed by sections 574.106(a) and (a-1) or 592.156(a) and (b)
of the Texas Health and Safety Code, for court-ordered administration of psychoactive medications.166

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art.46B.086(a).

Note: The following procedures assume that article 46B.086 applies and thus, a hearing was held by the 
probate court under section 574.106 or 592.156 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, and the defendant 
has been found to not meet the criteria prescribed by subsections 574.106(a) and (a-1) or 592.156(a) and 
(b) for court-ordered administration of psychoactive medications.

Refusal and Notice to the Court, Prosecutor, and Defense Counsel

If a defendant that meets the criteria in article 46B.086(a) refuses to take psychoactive medications as required 
by the continuity of care plan, the director of the facility or the program provider, as applicable, shall notify the 
court in which the criminal proceedings are pending of that fact not later than the end of the next business day 
following  the  refusal.  The  court  shall  promptly  notify  the  prosecutor  and  defense  counsel  of  the  defendant’s 
refusal. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art.46B.086(b).

Motion to Compel Medication

The  prosecutor  may  file  a  written  motion  to  compel  medication.  The  motion  to  compel  medication  must  be 
filed not later than the 15th day after the date a probate judge issues an order stating that the defendant does not 
meet the criteria for court-ordered administration of psychoactive medications under section 574.106 or 592.156, 
Texas Health and Safety Code, except that, for a defendant in an outpatient competency restoration program, the 
motion may be filed at any time. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art.46B.086(b).

Notice and a Hearing Provided to Defendant

The court, after notice and after a hearing held not later than the 10th day after the motion to compel medication 
is filed, may authorize the director of the facility or the program provider, as applicable, to have the medication 
administered to the defendant, by reasonable force if necessary. The hearing may be conducted using an electronic 
broadcast system as provided by article 46B.013. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art.46B.086(c).

Testimony of Two Physicians

The court may issue an order for forced medication only if the order is supported by the testimony of two physicians, 
one of whom is the physician at or with the applicable facility or program who is prescribing the medication as 
a component of the continuity of care plan and another who is not otherwise involved in proceedings against 
the  defendant.  The  court  may  require  either  or  both  physicians  to  examine  the  defendant  and  report  on  the 
examination to the court. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art.46B.086(d).

166  This hearing is conducted by the probate court and is separate from the 46B.086 hearing conducted by the criminal court.

172

A  statement  made  by  a  defendant  to  a  physician  during  such  examination  may  not  be  admitted  against  the 
defendant in any criminal proceeding, other than at:

•  a hearing on the defendant’s incompetency; or

•  any proceeding at which the defendant first introduces into evidence the contents of the statement.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art.46B.086(f).

Clear and Convincing Evidence

The court may issue an order authorizing forced medication if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:

• 

• 

the prescribed medication is medically appropriate, is in the best medical interest of the defendant, and 
does not present side effects that cause harm to the defendant that is greater than the medical benefit to 
the defendant;

the state has a clear and compelling interest in the defendant obtaining and maintaining competency to 
stand trial;

•  no other less invasive means of obtaining and maintaining the defendant’s competency exists; and

• 

the prescribed medication will not unduly prejudice the defendant’s rights or use of defensive theories  
at trial.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art.46B.086(e).

Civil Commitment by the Criminal Court: Extended Commitment

7.3 
The criminal court’s role in civil commitment following criminal commitment depends on whether the underlying 
charges are pending or have been dismissed. Both scenarios are addressed below.

7.3.1  Charges Pending

7.3.1a  Applicability of Subchapter E of Chapter 46B
If the charges against the defendant are still pending and the court is either required to proceed according to article 
46B.084(e) (competency has not been attained or restored after the initial restoration period and one possible 
extension period) or  has determined  it  is appropriate  to proceed under article  46B.071  (based on  the expert’s 
report  that  the  defendant  is  both  incompetent  and  unlikely  to  be  restored  to  competency  in  the  foreseeable 
future), then Subchapter E (Civil Commitment: Charges Pending) applies. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.101.

7.3.1b  Civil Commitment Hearing: Mental Illness
If it appears to the criminal court that the defendant may be a person with MI, the court shall hold a hearing to 
determine whether the defendant should be court-ordered to mental health services under Subtitle C, Title 7 
of the Texas Health and Safety Code. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.102(a). The judge of the criminal court will 
preside over and  make the determinations that a county  judge or other court with probate  jurisdiction would 
normally make in the civil commitment process (the criminal court may be the county court for certain offenses).

Proceedings Governed by the Texas Mental Health Code

Proceedings for commitment of the defendant to court-ordered mental health services are governed by Subtitle 
C,  Title  7 of  the  Texas  Health and  Safety  Code  (to  the extent  that  subtitle applies and does  not conflict with 
Chapter 46B), except that the criminal court is the court conducting the proceedings. This is true whether or not 
the criminal court is also the county court. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.102(a).

Besides the criminal court conducting the proceedings, some other key differences exist between court-ordered 
mental  health  services  under  Subchapter  E  of  Chapter  46B  and  court-ordered  mental  health  services  under 
Subtitle C, Title 7 of the Texas Health and Safety Code.167 An application for court-ordered temporary or extended 
mental health services is not required. The provisions of Subtitle C, Title 7 of the Texas Health and Safety Code 
relating to notice of hearing do not apply. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.102(d).

Note: The provisions in Chapter 574 of the Health and Safety Code use the terms “proposed patient” and “patient.” 
References below to “the defendant” are used to reflect that charges remain pending; however, the defendant is 
the proposed patient or the patient for purposes of the provisions in Chapter 574.

175

General Hearing Procedures

1.  Before a Subchapter E hearing may be held, there must be on file with the court at least two CMEs for 
mental illness completed by different physicians, each of whom has examined the defendant in the past 
30 days. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.009. 

1)  The CME for mental illness must be sworn to, dated, signed by the examining physician and contain 

certain information. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.011.

2)  The  hearing  should  be  held  in  a  physical  setting  that  is  not  likely  to  have  a  harmful  effect  on  the 

defendant. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(a).

3)  The  defendant  is  entitled  to  be  present  at  the  hearing,  unless  the  defendant  or  the  defendant’s 

attorney waive that right. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(c).

4)  The hearing must be open to the public unless otherwise requested by the defendant and good cause 

is shown for closing the hearing. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(d).

5)  The Texas Rules of Evidence apply unless inconsistent with Subtitle C, Title 7 of the Texas Health and 

Safety Code. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(e).

6)  The  court  may  consider  the  testimony  of  a  nonphysician  mental  health  professional  in  addition  to 

medical or psychiatric testimony. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(f).

7)  The hearing is on the record, and the state must prove each element of the applicable criteria by clear 

and convincing evidence. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(g).

8)  Whether the hearing is before the court or the jury depends on the type of mental health services 
(temporary or extended) and whether the right to a jury, if applicable, has been waived. Tex. Health 
& Safety Code § 574.032.

9)  The criteria for mental health services are found in sections 574.034 (temporary inpatient), 574.0345 
(temporary  outpatient),  574.035  (extended  inpatient),  and  574.0355  (extended  outpatient)  of  the 
Texas Health and Safety Code.

10)  If the court orders outpatient mental health services, the judge must designate a person responsible 
for those services. That person must submit a general program of treatment to the court. Tex. Health 
& Safety Code § 574.037.

11)  The court must direct the court clerk to issue to the person authorized to transport the defendant 
two writs of commitment requiring the person to take custody of and transport the defendant to the 
designated mental health facility. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.046.

12)  A certified transcript must be prepared and sent to the designated facility. Tex. Health & Safety Code 

§ 574.047.

13)  An acknowledgement of delivery of the defendant must be provided by the facility administrator and 

a copy filed with the clerk of the committing court.

176

Court-Ordered Mental Health Services 

Proceedings for Court-Ordered Mental Health Services are divided into four parts, one for each procedure:

•  Order for Temporary Inpatient Mental Health Services. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.034.
•  Order for Temporary Outpatient Mental Health Services. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.0345.
•  Order for Extended Inpatient Mental Health Services. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.035.

•  Order for Extended Outpatient Mental Health Services. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.0355.

An order for temporary mental health services is generally authorized for not longer than 45 days; however, if 
a judge finds a longer period is necessary, the order may specify a period not to exceed 90 days. Tex. Health & 
Safety Code §§ 574.034(g); 574.0345(c). An order for extended mental health services must provide for a period of 
treatment not to exceed 12 months. Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 574.035(h), 574.0355(d).

Each type of mental health services has its own criteria that must be met before a judge may order a defendant to 
receive that service (see sections 574.034, 574.0345, 574.035, and 574.0355 of the Texas Health and Safety Code). In 
addition to the commitment criteria, which type of services the court orders depend on the circumstances, i.e., 
the stability of the defendant, the intent of the prosecutor regarding the charge, and the recommendation of the 
treatment provider. 

Assuming the criminal court granted the full restoration period (initial restoration period plus one extension), a 
defendant receiving a Subchapter E hearing will likely have been committed for either 120 or 180 days depending 
on the underlying offense. Therefore, if the defendant otherwise meets the criteria for extended mental health 
services in sections 574.035 (extended inpatient) or 574.0355 (extended outpatient) of the Texas Health and Safety 
Code, the criminal court may apply those provisions rather than the provisions in section 574.034 or 574.0345 
related to temporary inpatient mental health services for up to 45 days or 90 days.168 See Intercept 0, section 3 of 
this Bench Book for detailed procedures.

Alternatively, the court can consider extended outpatient mental health services if certain criteria are met.169 See 
section 574.0355. See also Intercept 0, section 3 of this Bench Book for detailed procedures.

If the court is proceeding under Subchapter E because of a finding that the defendant is both incompetent and not 
likely to be restored in the foreseeable future, then the defendant will not have been committed under Subchapter 
D of Chapter 46B. Instead, the court must turn directly either to Subchapter E (if charges remain pending) or 
Subchapter F (if the charges are dropped). Therefore, there typically will not have been the requisite inpatient 
hospitalization under Chapter 46B for 60 consecutive days in the preceding 12 months to be able to pursue an

commitment hearing, the Texas Health and Safety Code requires live expert testimony and a jury (unless the defendant or the defendant’s attor-
ney waive the right to a jury). Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 574.031, 574.032. See Intercept 0, section 3of this Bench Book for detailed procedures.

Such  a  defendant  also  likely  will  not  meet  the  requirements  for  consideration  of  an  extended  outpatient 
commitment under section 574.0355 (receiving court-ordered inpatient mental health services for at least 60 days 
during the preceding 12 months or court-ordered outpatient services during the preceding 60 days). Therefore, 
the criminal court will need to proceed with the temporary inpatient commitment provisions in section 574.034 
of the Texas Health and Safety Code (not to exceed 45 days, but the period can be up to 90 days if the judge finds 
the longer period to be necessary).171 See Intercept 0, section 3 of this Bench Book for detailed procedures. 

Alternatively, in appropriate cases, the court may consider ordering temporary outpatient services for the same 
time periods under section 574.0345 provided that the charges pending against the defendant do not involve an 
act, attempt, or threat of serious bodily injury to another person. See Intercept 0, section 3 of this Bench Book for 
detailed procedures.

The  commitment  criteria  for  temporary  inpatient,  temporary  outpatient,  extended  inpatient,  and  extended 
outpatient mental health services are discussed in Intercept 0, section 3 of this Bench Book.

Commitment Criteria

Appeals

• 

Appeals from the criminal court proceedings are to the court of appeals as in the proceedings for court-ordered 
inpatient mental health services under Subtitle C, Title 7 of the Texas Health and Safety Code. Tex. Code Crim. 
Proc. art. 46B.102(d).

Commitment to a Mental Health Facility172

If the court enters an order committing the defendant to a mental health facility, the defendant shall be:

treated in conformity with Subtitle C, Title 7 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, except as otherwise 
provided by Chapter 46B; and

released in conformity with article 46B.107.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.102(c).

171  Id. Note: In the event the defendant was returned to court after criminal commitment, but spent so many months in jail that section 574.035 
does not apply (specifically, the defendant has not received court-ordered inpatient mental health services under Chapter 46B for at least 60 
consecutive days during the previous 12 months because the defendant has been in jail for longer than 12 months since returning to court after 
those services), the criminal court must then conduct the temporary commitment proceedings under section 574.034 (inpatient) or 574.0345 
(outpatient). Id. Professor Shannon also notes that, though rare, it is possible for the mental health treatment provider to return the defendant 
back to the court as not likely to attain competency within the foreseeable future before the defendant has been hospitalized for 60 days.  
Then, the Texas Health and Safety Code would also require the court to follow the 45-day (or 90-day) “temporary” commitment provisions.

172 See sections 574.034, 574.0345, 574.035, and 574.0355 of the Texas Health and Safety Code for the criteria that must be met before a judge 
may order a defendant to receive temporary inpatient, temporary outpatient, extended inpatient, and extended outpatient services respectively.

178

General Post-Commitment Procedures

•  Not later than the 30th day after the defendant is committed to the facility, the facility administrator must assess 
the  appropriateness  of  transferring  the  defendant  to  outpatient  mental  health  services.  The  administrator 
may recommend that the court modify the order to require such services. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.061.

• 

• 

If the court ordered outpatient services, the judge may set a hearing on its own motion or on a motion for 
modification to determine whether the order should be modified in a way that substantially deviates from the 
original program of treatment in the order. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.062.

The  court  may  modify  an  order  (or  refuse  to  modify  an  order)  for  outpatient  services  at  the  modification 
hearing  if  the  court  determines  that  the  patient  meets  the  applicable  criteria  for  court-ordered  inpatient 
mental health services. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.065.

•  A  county  or  district  attorney  or  other  adult  may  file  an  application  to  renew  an  order  for  extended  mental 
health services. Certain information is required in the application (for example, two CMEs for mental illness) 
and a hearing may be requested or held on the court’s own motion. The court must apply certain criteria and 
make certain findings. A renewed order authorizes treatment for not more than 12 months. A renewed order 
may be modified to provide for outpatient mental health services. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.066.

• 

The court on its own motion may set a status conference with the defendant, the defendant’s attorney, and 
the  person  designated  to  be  responsible  for  the  court-ordered  outpatient  services  under  section  574.037.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.0665.

7.3.1c  Civil Commitment Hearing: Intellectual Disability
The  following  procedures  govern  a  civil  commitment  hearing  for  a  person  with  an  ID  when  charges  remain 
pending and the person remains incompetent to proceed to trial or was determined unlikely to be restored to 
competency in the foreseeable future. See Intercept 0, section 3.5 of this Bench Book for detailed procedures, 
including the commitment criteria in section 593.052 of the Texas Health and Safety Code.

Hearing

If it appears to the court that the defendant may be a person with an ID, the court shall hold a hearing to determine 
whether the defendant is a person with an ID. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.103(a). The judge of the criminal 
court will preside over and make the determinations that a county judge or other court with probate jurisdiction 
would normally make in the civil commitment process (the criminal court may be the county court for certain 
offenses).

Proceedings Governed by Persons with Intellectual Disability Act

Proceedings for commitment of the defendant to a residential care facility are governed by Subtitle D, Title 7 of 
the Texas Health and Safety Code (to the extent that Subtitle D applies and does not conflict with Chapter 46B), 
except that the criminal court shall conduct the proceedings whether or not the criminal court is also a county 
court. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.103(b).

Besides the criminal court conducting the proceedings, some other key differences exist between civil commitment 
under Subchapter E of Chapter 46B and civil commitment under Subtitle D, Title 7 of the Texas Health and Safety 
Code.  An  application  to  have  the  defendant  declared  a  person  with  an  ID  is  not  required.  The  provisions  of 
Subtitle D, Title 7 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, relating to notice of hearing do not apply. Tex. Code Crim. 
Proc. art. 46B.103(d).

Note:  Unlike  the  burden of  proof  for civil commitments  for  MI  (clear and convincing evidence),  the  burden 
of  proof  in  commitment  proceedings  for  persons  with  intellectual  disabilities  is  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  
Tex. Health and Safety Code § 593.050.

179

Appeals

Appeals from the criminal court proceedings are to the court of appeals as in the proceedings for commitment to 
a residential care facility under Subtitle D, Title 7 of the Texas Health and Safety Code. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 
46B.103(d).

Commitment to Residential Care Facility

If the court enters an order committing the defendant to a residential care facility, the defendant shall be:

treated and released in accordance with Subtitle D, Title 7 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, except as 
otherwise provided by Chapter 46B; and

released in conformity with article 46B.107.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.103(c).

7.3.1d  Civil Commitment Placement
If either the jury or court finds that the defendant meets the commitment criteria in the Texas Health and Safety 
Code, where the defendant will be placed depends on the underlying offense.

If the underlying charges are for non-violent offenses (i.e., there is no finding of violence under article 46B.104, 
see above), article 46B.106 requires the commitment to be to:

No Finding of Violence

•  a facility designated by HHSC;173 or 

•  an outpatient treatment program. 

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.106(a).

The facility or program cannot refuse the placement on grounds that criminal charges remain pending. Tex. Code 
Crim. Proc. art. 46B.106(b).

Finding of Violence

A defendant shall be committed to a facility designated by HHSC174 if:

the defendant is charged with an offense listed in article 17.032(a); or

the indictment charging the offense alleges an affirmative finding under article 42A.054(c) or (d).

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.104. 

A defendant required to  be committed to a  maximum security unit  (MSU)  by  HHSC  may  be assessed, at any 
time before the defendant is restored to competency, by the review board established under section 46B.105 to 
determine whether the defendant is manifestly dangerous. If the review board determines the defendant is not 
manifestly dangerous, HHSC must transfer the defendant to a non-maximum security facility designated by the 
HHSC. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.0831.

• 

• 

• 

• 

173  For the commitment of a defendant under Chapter 46B, article 46B.0021 provides that HHSC may only designate a facility operated by HHSC 
or under a contract with HHSC for that purpose.

174  Id.

180

Transfer Following Civil Commitment Placement – Step-Down from MSU

If HHSC requires that the defendant is placed in an MSU, no later than the 60th day after the date the defendant 
arrives at the MSU, the defendant shall be assessed by a review boards to see if they can safely be treated in a 
non-MSU setting and transferred to:

•  a unit of an inpatient mental health facility other than a MSU;

•  a residential care facility; or

•  a program designated by a LMHA or LIDDA.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.105(a).

However, the defendant will not be transferred if the defendant is determined by a review board appointed by 
the executive commissioner of HHSC to be manifestly dangerous, and as a result of the danger the defendant 
presents, requires continued placement in a MSU. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.105(b). 

This  determination  is  not  a  medical  determination  that  the  defendant  no  longer  meets  commitment  criteria 
under either Subtitle C or D of Title 7 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, but merely permits the transfer to 
a less restrictive setting for further treatment. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.105(d). Nor may the review board 
make  a  determination  as  to  the  defendant’s  need  for  treatment.  Tex.  Code  Crim.  Proc.  art.  46B.105(c).  If  the 
superintendent  of  the  facility  at  which  the  MSU  is  located  disagrees  with  the  review  board’s  determination, 
he or she shall  refer  the  matter  to  the executive commissioner, who will  make  the determination of  manifest 
dangerousness. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.105(e).

Transfer Following Civil Commitment Placement – Step-Down from Inpatient

For an individual who has been transferred from a MSU to any facility other than MSU, the defendant, the head 
of the facility where the defendant is committed, or the attorney representing the state may request the court 
to  modify  the  order  of  inpatient/residential  treatment  and  instead  order  the  defendant  to  participate  in  an 
outpatient treatment program. 

If the head of the facility makes the request, the court is required to hold a hearing within 14 days of the request 
to determine whether the court should modify placement. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.1055(c).

If the defendant or attorney representing the state makes the request, within 14 days after the request the court 
must:  grant  the  request,  deny  the  request,  or  hold  a  hearing  on  the  request  to  determine  whether  the  court 
should modify the other. The court is not required to hold a hearing on a request made by the defendant or the 
state unless the request and supporting materials provide a basis for believing modification of the order may be 
appropriate. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.1055(d).

The  LMHA  or  LBHA  is  required  to  submit  a  statement  regarding  whether  treatment  and  supervision  for  the 
defendant can be safely and effectively provided on an outpatient basis, and where services are available to the 
defendant. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.1055(e).

If the head of the facility where the defendant is committed believes the defendant meets the criteria for court-
ordered outpatient services, the head of the facility shall submit a CME stating so. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 
46B.1055(f).

If  the  defendant  requests  to  be  transferred  to  outpatient  within  90  days  after  the  date  the  court  made  the 
determination on the previous request, the court is not required to act until the earlier of:

1) 

the expiration of the current order for inpatient treatment or residential care; or

2)  the 91st day after the date of the court’s previous determination. 

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.1055(g).

181

The court shall rule on the request as soon as practicable after a hearing on the request, but not later than the 
14th day after the date of the request. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.1055(i).

An outpatient treatment program may not refuse to accept a placement ordered under this article on the grounds 
that criminal charges against the defendant are pending. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.1055(j).

Proceedings for commitment of the defendant to a court-ordered outpatient treatment program are governed by 
Subtitle C, Title 7, Health and Safety Code, to the extent that Subtitle C applies and does not conflict with this 
chapter, except that the criminal court shall conduct the proceedings regardless of whether the criminal court is 
also the county court. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.1055(h).

Legislative Change

The law currently allows a possible modification from an inpatient-hospitalization order, for certain 
individuals,  to  court-ordered  outpatient  or  community-based  care.  Additionally,  the  law  already 
provides the ability to transfer a civilly committed defendant from a maximum-security facility to a 
facility other than a maximum-security unit.

S.B. 49 (87th Reg. Sess. (2021), adds Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.1055 to permit a court to consider a possible 
further step down in the placement of a defendant under an order of civil commitment with a finding of violence. 
Thus, making the procedures for a possible step-down for civil commitment comparable to those for an insanity-
based commitment. This addition would allow a court to hold a hearing and determine if a step down to outpatient 
mental  health  services  is  appropriate  in  modifying  the  defendant’s  civil  commitment  order.  The  proposal  also 
includes language to require consultation with the local mental health authority or local behavioral health authority 
before any court hearing. 

7.3.1e  Redetermination of Competency

Release After Commitment

Once a defendant becomes a patient in a mental health facility, an outpatient treatment program, or a residential 
facility pursuant to Subchapter E, if the head of the facility or provider determines that the patient should be 
released, the head of the facility or outpatient treatment provider shall notify the court and the sheriff of the 
county from which the defendant was committed in writing of the release not later than the 14th day before the 
date on which the facility or outpatient treatment provider intends to release the defendant. The notice must 
be accompanied by a written statement that states an opinion as to whether the defendant to be released has 
attained competency to stand trial. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.107(b), (c).

However, such release is subject to disapproval by the committing court if the court or the attorney representing 
the  state  has  notified  the  head  of  the  facility  or  outpatient  treatment  provider,  as  applicable,  to  which  the 
defendant has been committed that a criminal charge remains pending against the defendant. Tex. Code Crim. 
Proc. art. 46B.107(a).

Upon receiving notice of release from the facility or provider, the court shall hold a hearing (at the facility or 
by means of an electronic broadcast system) to determine whether release is appropriate under the applicable 
criteria in Subtitle C or D, Title 7 of the Texas Health and Safety Code. Even if the court does not receive notice 
of intent to release the defendant, the court may, on motion of the attorney representing the state or on its own 
motion, hold a hearing to determine whether release is appropriate under the applicable criteria in Subtitle C or 
D, Title 7 of the Texas Health and Safety Code. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.107(d).

If the court determines that release is not appropriate, the court shall enter an order directing the head of the 
facility  or  the  outpatient  treatment  provider  to  not  release  the  defendant.  If  the  court  enters  such  an  order, 
any subsequent proceeding to release the defendant must follow this same process. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 
46B.107(e).

182

Inquiry into Restoration of Competency

Upon receipt of the above notice from the facility or provider that the defendant is ready for release, or at any time, 
the trial court may determine whether the defendant has been restored to competency. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 
46B.108.

In  addition,  the  head  of  the  facility  or  provider,  the  defendant,  defense  counsel,  or  prosecutor  may  make  an 
inquiry into competency restoration at any time. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. arts. 46B.109; 46B.110.

A request to the court made by the head of the facility or provider must be accompanied by a written statement 
that in their opinion the defendant is competent to stand trial. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.109. A motion by 
the defendant, defense attorney, or prosecutor made to the court may be accompanied by affidavits supporting 
the moving party’s assertion that the defendant is competent. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.110.

Expert Determination of Competency

Upon a request or motion to determine that the defendant has been restored to competency or on the court’s 
decision on its own motion to inquire into restoration of competency, the court may appoint disinterested experts 
to examine the defendant in accordance with Subchapter B. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.111.

Determination of Restoration with Agreement

Upon a request or motion to determine that the defendant has been restored to competency or on the court’s own 
motion to inquire into restoration of competency, the court shall find the defendant competent to stand trial and 
proceed in the same manner as if the defendant had been found restored to competency at a hearing if:

both parties agree that the defendant is competent to stand trial; and

•

•

the court concurs.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.112.

Determination of Restoration Without Agreement

Upon a request by the head of facility or provider, the court shall hold a hearing to determine whether the defendant 
has been restored to competency. Upon a motion by a party to determine whether the defendant has been restored 
to competency or on the court’s own motion to inquire into restoration of competency, the court may hold a hearing. 
However, if a motion and any supporting materials establish good reason to believe the defendant may have been 
restored to competency, the court shall hold a hearing. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.113(a), (b).

If the court holds such a hearing, a jury shall make the determination on the request of the counsel for either party 
or the motion of the court. If no request is made, the court shall make the competency determination, and may 
conduct the hearing at the facility or by electronic broadcast. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.113(c). If the hearing 
is not conducted at the facility or by electronic broadcast, the order setting the hearing shall also direct that as 
soon as practicable,  but  not earlier  than  72  hours  before  the date  the  hearing  is scheduled,  the defendant  be 
placed in the custody of the sheriff of the county in which the committing court is located or the sheriff’s designee 
for transportation to the court. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.114.

183

At  the  hearing,  if  the  head  of  the  facility  or  provider  supplied  an  opinion  that  the  defendant  has  regained 
competency, competency is presumed and continuing incompetency must be proved by a preponderance of the 
evidence. However, if the head of the facility or provider did not provide an opinion, incompetency is presumed 
and competency must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.175 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.113(d), (e).

Disposition on Determination of Competency

If the defendant is found competent to stand trial, the proceedings on the criminal charge may proceed. Tex. Code 
Crim. Proc. art. 46B.116.

Disposition on Determination of Incompetency

If the defendant is found incompetent to stand trial, the court shall remand the defendant pursuant to the order of 
commitment, and, if applicable, order the defendant placed in the custody of the sheriff or the sheriff’s designee 
for transportation back to the facility or outpatient treatment program. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.117.

Subsequent Redeterminations of Competency 

If  the  court  has  determined  that  a  defendant  has  not  been  restored  to  competency  under  Subchapter  E,  a 
subsequent request or motion for a redetermination of competency filed before the 91st day after the date of that 
determination must:

explain  why  the  person  making  the  request  or  motion  believes  another  inquiry  into  restoration  is
appropriate; and

•

•

provide support for the belief.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.115(a).

Upon such a request, the court may hold a hearing, but only if the court first finds reason to believe the defendant’s 
condition has materially changed since the prior determination that the defendant was not restored to competency. 
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.115(b). If the competency determination will be made by the court, the court may 
conduct the hearing at the facility to which the defendant has been committed or may conduct the hearing by 
means of an electronic broadcast. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.115(c).

175  Historically, in Texas, when a person is found to be incompetent, is sent for competency restoration, and is not restored, then there has 
been an “unvacated adjudication of incompetency” and the burden of proof shifts to the State to “prove the accused’s competency to stand trial 
beyond a reasonable doubt.” Manning v. State, 730 S.W. 744, 748 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987). However, under article 46B.113, for Subchapter E com-
mitments, when the facility head or outpatient treatment provider has opined that the defendant’s competency has been restored, competency 
is presumed, and continuing incompetency must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. If the facility head or outpatient treatment pro-
vider has not provided an opinion that the defendant has regained competency, incompetency is presumed, and competency must be proved 
by a preponderance of the evidence. For more discussion of this issue, see Moralez v. State, 450 S.W.3d 553, 559-60 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th 
Dist.] 2014, pet. ref’d). Note that the statute does not directly address a situation in which the facility head or outpatient treatment provider 
instead provides an opinion that the defendant’s competency has not been restored. Presumably, then, per Manning, the State would have to 
prove competency beyond a reasonable doubt in such a case, although there are no reported cases on point. briaN d. SHaNNoN & daNiel H. beNSoN, 
texaS CriMiNal ProCedure aNd tHe offeNder witH MeNtal illNeSS 120-121 (6th ed. 2019).

184

Involvement by the Criminal Court Expires

Remember that the total time a defendant can spend in incompetency proceedings is limited. See section 7.2.5 
above. Under Chapter 46B, a defendant generally may not be criminally committed (regardless of the facility or 
program) for a cumulative period that exceeds the maximum term provided by law for the offense for which the 
defendant was to be tried. This maximum term includes all time the defendant was held in jail before they were 
determined incompetent to stand trial. If the defendant is still in need of commitment for mental health treatment 
after the maximum restoration period expires, that can only happen through civil commitment proceedings. The 
criminal  court  can  no  longer  be  involved.  The  defendant  may  be  confined  for  an  additional  period  in  a  mental 
hospital  or  other  facility  or  may  be  ordered  to  participate  for  an  additional  period  in  an  outpatient  treatment 
program, as appropriate, only pursuant to proceedings conducted under Subtitle C (Texas Mental Health Code) 
or D (Persons with Intellectual Disability Act), Title 7 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, by a court with probate 
jurisdiction. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.0095.

7.3.2  Charges Dismissed

7.3.2a  Determination of Mental Illness or Intellectual Disability
If a court is required by article 46B.084(f) or by its appropriate determination under article 46B.071 to proceed 
under Subchapter F of Chapter 46B, or if the court is permitted by article 46B.004(e) to proceed under Subchapter 
F, the court shall determine whether there is evidence to support a finding that the defendant is either a person 
with MI or a person with an ID. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.151(a).

7.3.2b  Order Transferring Defendant to Appropriate Court for Civil Commitment Proceedings
If it appears to the court that there is evidence to support a finding of MI or an ID, the court shall enter an order 
transferring the defendant to the appropriate court for civil commitment proceedings and stating that all charges 
pending against the defendant in that court have been dismissed.  The criminal court may order the defendant:

•

•

detained  in  jail  or  any  other  suitable  place  pending  the  prompt  initiation  and  prosecution  by  the
prosecutor or other person designated by the court of appropriate civil proceedings to determine whether 
the defendant will be committed to a mental health facility or residential care facility; or

placed in the care of a responsible person on satisfactory security being given for the defendant’s proper
care and protection.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.151(b).

However, a defendant placed in a state hospital or state supported living center pending a civil hearing may be 
detained in that facility only with the consent of the head of the facility and pursuant to an order of protective 
custody issued under Subtitle C, Title 7 of the Texas Health and Safety Code. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.151(c).

If the court does not detain the defendant or place the defendant in the care of a responsible person, the 
court shall release the defendant. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.151(d).

***Note that Maximum Term Provided by Law does not include enhancements***
Maximum term provided by law is determined by punishment range of the offense charged not including  
enhancements due to prior convictions. Ex Parte Reinke, 370 S.W.3d 387 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012).

7.3.3  Transcripts and Other Records
The court shall order that:

a transcript of all medical testimony received in both the criminal proceedings and the civil commitment 
proceedings under Subchapter E or F be prepared as soon as possible by the court reporters; and

copies  of  documents  listed  in  article  46B.076  accompany  the  defendant  to  the  mental  health  facility,
outpatient treatment program, or residential care facility.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.171(a).

On the request of the defendant or defense attorney, a mental health facility, an outpatient treatment program, 
or a residential care facility shall provide to the defendant or the attorney copies of the facility’s records regarding 
the defendant. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.171(b).

Incompetency and Subsequent Charges

A defendant who (1) was found incompetent, (2) was either committed for restoration or was found not likely 
to be restored in the foreseeable future, and (3) is charged with a subsequent offense will not repeat the same 
competency process. At the outset, he or she is presumed to be incompetent. Manning v. State, 730 S.W.2d 744 
(Tex.  Crim.  App.  1987).  The  State  has  the  burden  to  prove  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  the  defendant  is 
competent. The court may not again commit such a defendant for restoration unless there is a finding that the 
defendant is likely to be restored in the foreseeable future. If such a defendant is re-examined, the court should 
consider including this contrasting presumption and burden of proof in the order.176

7.4  Miscellaneous Provisions

7.4.1  Compliance with Chapter
The failure of a person to comply with Chapter 46B does not provide a defendant with a right to dismissal of 
charges. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.012.

7.4.2  Time Credits
A court sentencing a person convicted of a criminal offense shall credit to the term of the person’s sentence each 
of the following periods for which the person may be confined in a mental health facility, residential care facility, 
or jail:

any period of confinement that occurs pending a determination under Subchapter C as to the defendant’s
competency to stand trial; and

any period of confinement that occurs between the date of any initial determination of the defendant’s
incompetency  under  that  subchapter  and  the  date  the  person  is  transported  to  jail  following  a  final
judicial determination that the person has been restored to competency.

7.4.3  Electronic Broadcast System
A hearing may be conducted using an electronic broadcast system as permitted by Chapter 46B and in accordance 
with the other provisions of that code if:

•  written consent to the use of an electronic broadcast system is filed with the court by the defendant or 

defense attorney and the prosecutor;

• 

the electronic broadcast system provides for a simultaneous, compressed full motion video, and interactive 
communication of image and sound between the judge, the prosecutor, the defense attorney, and the 
defendant; and

•  on request of the defendant or the defense attorney, the defendant and the defense attorney are able to 

communicate privately without being recorded or heard by the judge or the prosecutor.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. 46B.013(a).

On the motion of the defendant, the defense attorney, or the prosecutor or on the court’s own motion, the court 
may terminate an appearance made through an electronic broadcast system at any time during the appearance 
and require an appearance by the defendant in open court. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. 46B.013(b).

A  recording  of  the  communication  shall  be  made  and  preserved  until  any  appellate  proceedings  have  been 
concluded.  The defendant may obtain a copy of the recording on payment of a reasonable amount to cover the 
costs of reproduction or, if the defendant is indigent, the court shall provide a copy to the defendant without 
charging a cost for the copy. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. 46B.013(c).

Challenges exist beyond the scope of criminal and civil commitment for individuals who are:

This section covers the issues and procedures related to the Texas insanity defense, which are generally found in 
Chapter 46C of the Code of Criminal Procedure and section 8.01 of the Texas Penal Code. 

8. 

Insanity

8.1 

Determining Insanity

Making the Distinction:  
Competency, Insanity, Mental Illness, and Intellectual Disability

Competency  to  Stand  Trial:  Relates  to  a  defendant’s  mental  state  and  present  capacity  to  stand  trial 
at  the time  of trial  (should not be confused with a  general finding of incapacity by a  civil court related  to 
guardianship); incompetency is not a defense to the crime charged.

Insanity:  Relates  to  a  defendant’s  mental  state  at  the  time  the  alleged  crime  was  committed  and  is  an 
affirmative defense to prosecution.

Mental  Illness:  Relates  to  impairment  of  thought,  perception  of  reality,  emotional  process,  judgment,  or 
behavior. Sometimes archaically referred to as a “mental disease” in statutory text. Note that a person may 
have a mental illness but still be competent to stand trial (though maybe not without counsel). Similarly, a person 
may have a mental illness but not meet the legal standard for the insanity defense.

Intellectual  Disability:  Relates  to  subaverage  general  intellectual  functioning  with  deficits  in  adaptive 
behavior. Sometimes archaically referred to as a “defect” in statutory text. Note that a person may have an 
intellectual disability but still be competent to stand trial (though maybe not without counsel). Similarly, a person 
may have an intellectual disability but not meet the legal standard for the insanity defense.

8.1.1  Standards

The procedures for determining if someone is not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI) are outlined in Code of 
Criminal Procedure, Chapter 46C, which provides that a Defendant is acquitted of the crime they are charged 
with and determined to be NGRI if:

a)  The prosecution has established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant committed the charged 

b)  The defense establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant was insane at the time 

offense; and

of the offense.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.153(a)

8.1.2  Texas Penal Code Statutory Language

Insanity

(a) It is an affirmative defense to prosecution that, at the time of the conduct charged, the actor, as a result of 
severe mental disease or defect, did not know that his conduct was wrong. 

(b) The  term  “mental disease or defect” does  not  include an abnormality  manifested  by  repeated criminal or 
otherwise antisocial conduct.

Tex. Penal Code § 8.01.

8.1.3   Statutory Language Broken Down

8.1.3a	 Affirmative	Defense

An affirmative defense provides an excuse or justification for why certain conduct or action (the charged criminal 
offense) occurred. An affirmative defense is one that the defendant must allege and prove by a preponderance of 
the evidence. 

When a defendant uses an affirmative defense, the defendant acquiesces to the alleged conduct but then asserts 
the affirmative defense as to why the conduct occurred. 

The jury charge will only include the issue of an affirmative defense if the Defendant admits supporting evidence. 
“Hence,  a  defendant  desiring  to  use  the  insanity  defense  must  both  raise  that  issue  and  present  evidence  in 
support  of  it.  The  jury  is  instructed  that  the  terminology  ‘preponderance  of  the  evidence’  means  the  greater 
weight of the credible evidence.”188

Tex. Penal Code § 2.04

8.1.3b	 Severe

The term “severe” is not defined in Texas or federal statutes. In Texas Criminal Procedure and the Offender with 
Mental Illness, Professor Brian Shannon discusses that the legislative purpose for inclusion of the word severe “was 
to ensure that minor disorders or personality defects will not provide a basis for a successful insanity defense.”189

The  Texas  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  has  commented  that  “[i]ntroducing  [the  term]  ‘severe’  seems  quite 
superfluous.”190 The Court reasoned, “[I]f as a result of mental disease or defect an accused does not know his 
conduct is wrong when he engages in it, then surely his mental disease or defect is severe.”191

The federal test for insanity also includes the phrase, “severe mental disease or defect.”192 As one federal district 
court explained: “The legislative history states that the term ‘severe’ was added to the term ‘mental disease or 
defect’ specifically to exclude antisocial personality ‘tendencies’ from the purview of the insanity defense.”193 The 
court added: “The concept of severity was added to emphasize that non-psychotic behavior disorders or neuroses 
such as an ‘inadequate personality,’ ‘immature personality,’ or a pattern of ‘antisocial tendencies’ do not constitute 
the defense.”194

“Serious mental illness” is defined in the Insurance code and may be the closest that the legislature has ever gotten 
to defining “severe mental disease.” That definition states: 

“Serious  mental  illness”  means  the  following  psychiatric  illnesses  as  defined  by  the  American  Psychiatric 
Association in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM):

(A) bipolar disorders (hypomanic, manic, depressive, and mixed);

(B)  depression in childhood and adolescence;

(C) major depressive disorders (single episode or recurrent);

(D) obsessive-compulsive disorders;

(E)  paranoid and other psychotic disorders;

(F)  schizo-affective disorders (bipolar or depressive); and schizophrenia.

8.1.3c	 Mental	Disease	or	Defect

Although there is no statutory definition for either “mental disease” or “defect,” the terms generally are understood 
to include mental illness and intellectual and developmental disabilities. Compare, for example, the language in 
the  insanity defense for  juveniles found  in  Section  55.51(a), Tex.  Family  Code, which  has  been  modernized to 
include the terms “mental illness or an intellectual disability.” 

. . . “Mental illness” means an illness, disease, or condition, other than epilepsy, dementia, 
substance abuse, or intellectual disability, that:

(A)   substantially impairs a person’s thought, perception of reality, emotional process, 

or judgment; or

(B)  grossly impairs behavior as demonstrated by recent disturbed behavior.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 591.003(14); Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.001(3).

Likewise,  there  is  no current statutory definition of  “mental defect,” which  is primarily an obsolete  term  that 
is  associated  with  what  we  now  refer  to  as  Intellectual  or  Developmental  Disability  (IDD).  Further,  the  term 
mental retardation, although still cited within Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, Chapter 46C, is defined in Art. 
46C.001(4) as having meaning assigned by Section 591.003, Health and Safety Code; that section circularly defines 
mental retardation as meaning intellectual disability. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 591.003(13).

“Intellectual disability”  means significantly subaverage general  intellectual  functioning195  that  is concurrent 
with deficits in adaptive behavior196 and originates during the developmental period. Tex. Health & Safety Code 
§ 591.003(7-a).

8.1.3d	 Repeated	Criminal	Conduct	of	Otherwise	Antisocial	Conduct

“Manifested by repeated criminal . . . conduct” means that a defendant cannot claim insanity when the mental 
disease is demonstrated by the crime itself. For example: Pyromania is manifested though committing arson, but 
Texas  Penal  Code section  8.01(b) works to preclude a successful  justification of  insanity to the crime of arson 
simply because the defendant is diagnosed with pyromania (and only, pyromania).

“Otherwise antisocial conduct” also means that an individual cannot claim insanity based on a mental disease 
or defect that resulted from drug use. 

The purpose of subsection  (b) was  to  “exclude psychopaths  from  the  insanity defense  for  fear  that recidivists 
would qualify if they could be characterized as psychopaths.”197 Of course, as Searcy and Patterson pointed out 
in their 1974 legal practice commentary, “no psychopath manifests his psychopathy solely by repeated criminal 
conduct and … [such persons] invariably show some other symptom.”198 

195  “Subaverage general intellectual functioning” refers to measured intelligence on standardized psychometric instruments of two or more 
standard deviations below the age-group mean for the tests used. Tex. healTh & SafeTy CoDe § 591.003(20).

196  “Adaptive Behavior” means how effectively individuals cope with common life demands and how well they meet the standards  
of personal independence expected of someone in their particular age group, sociocultural background, and community setting.  
Tex. healTh & SafeTy CoDe § 591.003(1).

8.1.3e	 Cognition	of	the	Legal	Wrong

The jury must be convinced by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant did not know that their 
conduct was legally wrong. This is opposed to not knowing the conduct was morally wrong.199

Knowing

Legal Wrong

Cognition  is  a  narrow  exclusive  test,  regardless  of  whether  a  defendant’s  mental  illness  impairs  the  ability  to 
control one’s conduct and no matter how serious the defendant’s mental illness may be.200 

A defendant that knows his act is prohibited by law will be viewed as having understood that others believed his 
or her conduct was wrong, and therefore such a defendant knows that his or her conduct is “wrong” within the 
meaning of Section 8.01(a) of the Texas Penal Code.201

“Thus, the question for deciding insanity is this: Does the defendant factually know that society considers 
this conduct against the law, even though the defendant, due to his mental disease or defect, may think 
that the conduct is morally justified? if a defendant knows that his or her conduct is prohibited by law, then 
he or she is legally ‘sane’ under Texas criminal law.”202

8.1.3f	 “As	a	Result”	of	the	Mental	Disease	or	Defect

Note that the language of the statute states there must be direct link between the defendant’s mental disease or 
defect and the lack of understanding that the crime was legally wrong. Tex. Penal Code § 8.01(a).

What	if	the	Defendant	was	Unconscious	or	Semi-Conscious?

“The insanity defense is not available to a defendant who was unconscious or semi-conscious at the time of 
the alleged offense, so that it might be said of him that he did not know his conduct was wrong only because 
he did not consciously know of his conduct at all.”203

In  rendering  this  opinion,  the  CCA  “carefully  reviewed  the  legislative  history  of  [the  insanity  defense]  and 
nothing in it suggests that any legislators intended for the insanity defense to apply to persons who were 
unconscious or semi-conscious at the time of the alleged offense” Also, persons who were unconscious or 
semi-conscious at the time of the alleged offense may argue other defenses, either that they lacked the mens 
rea necessary for criminal liability, or that they did not engage in a voluntary act under Texas Penal Code  
§§ 6.02 and 6.01.204

Code of Criminal Procedure – Chapter 46C 
  
NGRI / Insanity Defense* 
 

A Defendant (“D”) must give notice of intent to raise 
insanity defense at least 20 days before trial, or at the 
pretrial hearing if more than 20 days from trial  [46C.051] 

Once the intent to raise the insanity defense has been 
raised, the court may appoint disinterested experts to: 
• examine D with regard to the defense; and 
• testify at trial regarding that issue   [46C.101] 

Flow Chart Key 

Informational 

Exits from 46C 

Commitment Types 

Expert on insanity may be same person who opined on D’s competency under 
Art. 46B.  The report is due to court in 30 days from date of appointment and 
must address: 
•  observations and findings pertaining to insanity; 
•  whether D currently meets MH Code for commitment; or 
•  whether D has Intellectual/Developmental Disabilities (“IDD”) [46C.105] 

Determination of sanity may be made by judge or jury, however, 
jury may not be informed of the consequences of an acquittal 
by reason of insanity. [46C.151-156] 

A Defendant (“D”) is Not Guilty 
by Reason of Insanity (NGRI) if: 
•  The prosecution has 
established, beyond a 
reasonable doubt, that D 
committed the offense; and 
•  The defense establishes, by a 

preponderance of the evidence, 
that D was insane at the time of 
the offense. [46C.153(a)] 
 

 

 

 

Penal Code, Sec. 8.01. Insanity  

It is an affirmative defense to 
prosecution that, at the time of 
the conduct charged, the actor, 
as a result of severe mental 
disease or defect, did not know 
that his conduct was wrong. 

  *

   

If there is evidence of continued 
MH or IDD issues the criminal 
court shall transfer the matter to 
court with probate jurisdiction 
[46C.201-202] 

If found Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity (“NGRI”) the court must determine 
if the offense for which D was acquitted involved conduct that: 
•  caused serious bodily injury (“SBI”) to another;  
•  placed another in imminent danger of SBI; or 
•  consisted of a threat of SBI through use of a deadly weapon [46C.157] 

Conduct did NOT involve SBI or 
use of deadly weapon [46C.159] 

Conduct involving SBI or deadly 
weapon [46C.158] 

* Court personnel please contact the  
Forensic Admissions Team’s email at

of AP to an HHSC designated facility  

 

The court shall order Acquitted Person (“AP”) to a facility designated by Health 
and Human Services Commission (HHSC) for an initial 30 Day Commitment* for 
Evaluation/Treatment of AP’s present mental condition and Report [46C.251] 

The Report describes procedure, techniques and test used to evaluate acquittee including: 
•  whether AP has mental illness or intellectual/developmental disabilities and if so 

whether it is severe;  

•  whether, as a result of severe MH/IDD, AP is likely to cause serious harm to others;  
•  whether AP meets commitment criteria under Mental Health (“MH”) Code or Person 

with Intellectual Disabilities Act (“PIDA”); and  

•  whether treatment can be safely/effectively provided on outpatient basis [46C.252]

NGRI procedures continued from first page 

Court hearing on disposition of NGRI acquitted person (“AP”) following Report after Evaluation is conducted in the same 
manner as a hearing for involuntary commitment under MH Code or PIDA and addresses: 
•  whether AP has severe mental illness or IDD;  
•  whether, as a result of mental illness or IDD, AP is likely to cause serious harm to another; and  
•  whether appropriate treatment and supervision can be provided AP as outpatient/community-based treatment [46C.253(a)/(b)] 

Hea      

 

The court shall order AP to HHSC designated facility for 
inpatient / residential treatment for an initial 180-day 
commitment if, by clear and convincing evidence, the state 
proves that AP:  
• has severe mental illness or IDD;  
• as a result of mental illness or IDD AP is likely to cause 

serious harm to others; and  

• inpatient/residential treatment is necessary to protect the 

safety of others [46C.256] 

The court shall order outpatient/community-based 
treatment* for a period of 12 months if, by clear and 
convincing evidence, the state proves AP:  
• has severe mental illness or IDD;  
• as a result of mental illness or IDD AP is likely to 

cause serious harm to others; however  

• the state fails to prove that inpatient/ residential 

treatment is necessary to protect the safety of others 
[46C.257] 

 

 If AP is designated by HHSC to a 
Maximum Security Unit (MSU) they 
must be presented to Review Board, 
w/in 60 days to determine if AP is 
Manifestly Dangerous (MD).  If AP is 
not MD they must be transferred to 
non-MSU state hospital or state 
supported living center [46C.260(c)] 

The court shall order AP transferred to 
court with probate jurisdiction if state 
fails to establish standards for inpatient 
46C.256 or outpatient 46C.257 
commitment but evidence provides 
reasonable basis for commitment 
under MH Code or PIDA [46C.253(c)] 

*Court may only order AP into 
outpatient/community-based if: 
•  court approves comprehensive 
treatment/supervision plan; and 

•   plan will be available and 

provided to AP [46C.263(b)] 

The treating facility or outpatient program has a 
continuing responsibility to determine if AP: 
•  continues to have a severe mental illness or IDD and is 

likely to cause serious harm to others; and 

•  if so, whether treatment and supervision cannot be safely 
and effectively provided as an outpatient [46C.258(a)]   

The head of an inpatient/residential treatment facility 
must notify the committing court: 
• at least 60 days before commitment expires and 
provide report on AP’s psychological evaluation, 
certificate of medical examination (if required) and 
a recommendation for further treatment; 
[46C.258(c)] or  

• seek commitment modification♦ if AP no longer:  

°  has severe MH/IDD; 
°  likely to cause serious harm to others; or 
°  supervision and treatment can be safely 

provided on outpatient basis [46C.258(b)] 

♦ Courts have the ability to modify commitment 
from inpatient to outpatient and vice versa when 
deemed appropriate [46C.262 and 46C.266] 

The head of an outpatient/community-based treatment 
facility must notify the committing court: 
• at least 30 days before commitment expires and 

request that the order be renewed, provide in detail 
the reason for the renewal and certificate of medical 
examination (if required); [46C.261(b)]  

The court may renew commitment♦ for 12 months for 
inpatient/ residential treatment or outpatient/community-
based treatment if it is shown, by clear and convincing 
evidence, that continued mandatory supervision and 
treatment is appropriate [46C.261(h)]

Raising	the	issue	of	insanity

8.2.1	 Who	can	raise	it

Unlike the issue of competency, the defense must raise the issue of insanity and prove it by a preponderance of the 
evidence. Defense counsel is the “sole hope” that the issue will be brought before the court.206 Furthermore, failure 
to investigate the possibility of raising an insanity defense as a trial strategy can rise to the level of ineffective 
assistance of counsel where there is reason to believe an investigation is warranted.207 The insanity defense can be 
investigated ex parte (by one side without involving the other side) until a decision is made to formally pursue the 
insanity defense and offer notice.

8.2.2	 Notice	requirements

A  defendant  who  wants  to  offer  evidence  of  an  insanity  defense  must  file  notice  with  the  court  of  their 
intention  to  offer  that  evidence  and  include  a  certification  that  the  notice  was  served  to  the  prosecuting 
attorney.  The  notice  must  be  filed  at  least  20  days  prior  to  the  trial  date.  Note,  however,  that  if  a  pretrial 
hearing  is  set  prior  to  20-days  out  from  trial,  the  defendant  must  give  notice  at  that  earlier  hearing.  
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.051.

If the Notice of Insanity Defense is not filed at least 20 days prior to the trial date, or filed at a Pre-Trial Hearing, 
evidence of an insanity defense is not admissible, unless the court finds that there is a good reason for the failure 
to give notice. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.052.

8.3 

Experts

8.3.1	 Appointment	of	Experts

If notice of intention to raise the insanity defense is filed under Texas Code of Criminal Procedure 46C.051, the 
court may, on its own motion or motion by the defendant, the defendant’s counsel, or the attorney representing 
the state, appoint one or more disinterested experts to:

a)  Examine the defendant with regard to the insanity defense; and

b)  Testify as to the issue of insanity at any trial or hearing involving that issue.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.101.

8.3.2	 Qualifications

The court may appoint qualified psychiatrists or psychologists as experts. To qualify for appointment as an expert 
a psychiatrist or psychologist must:

•  Be a  licensed physician or  licensed psychologist, who  has doctoral degree  in psychology and  have the 

following certification or training;

forensic psychiatry; or

•  Certification by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology with added or special qualifications in 

•  Certification by the American Board of Professional Psychology in forensic psychology; or

•  Training  consisting  of  at  least  24  hours  of  specialized  forensic  training  relating  to  incompetency  or 

•  At least eight hours of continuing education relating to forensic evaluations, completed in the 12 months 

insanity evaluations; and

preceding the appointment.

Legislative	Change

S.B. 49 (87th Reg. Sess. (2021)), in part, amended Article 46C.102(a) to align qualifications for 
experts who conduct insanity evaluations with the qualifications set forth in Chapter 46B for 
experts  who  conduct  competency  evaluations.  This  alignment  was  done  by  removing  the 
“experience exception” for psychiatrists or psychologists who had five years of experience in 
performing forensic evaluations prior to the enactment of the statute subsection (2)(B)(ii).

History surrounding this change: The qualifications for insanity experts were enacted in 2005 and provided 
that experts in insanity cases must be qualified by board certification or by certain training or experience. 
This  statute  also  included  a  “legacy  exception”  for  psychiatrists  or  psychologists  who  had  five  years  of 
experience in performing forensic evaluations prior to the enactment of the statute. This language mirrored 
a comparable “five-year experience” exception that originally was a part of the qualifications for experts for 
competency evaluations; however, the exception for experts for competency evaluations was eliminated in 
2011. Given that almost 16 years have passed since the enactment of the insanity laws, any expert appointed 
to provide these services should now be otherwise qualified. The legislative change in S.B. 49 eliminates this 
confusing five-year experience exception and aligns the qualifications for experts in 46B and 46C.

8.3.3	 Who	chooses	the	expert(s)?

8.3.3a  The Court

If a notice of intention to raise an insanity defense is filed, the court may appoint one or more impartial experts to 
examine the defendant with regard to the insanity defense. The expert may also testify during the trial or hearing 
to the issue of insanity. The expert is appointed either through the court’s own motion or by a motion made by the 
defendant or the prosecution. The expert will be advised by the court of the facts and circumstances of the offense 
that the defendant is accused of committing as well as the elements of an insanity defense. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. 
art. 46C.101.

8.3.3b	 The	Defendant

If a defendant wishes to be examined by an expert of the defendant’s own choice, the court on timely request 
shall provide the examiner with reasonable opportunity to examine the defendant.208 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 
46C.107.

8.3.3c  The State
By  raising  the  NGRI  issue,  the  State  is  given  the  right  to  have  their  own  expert  examine  the  defendant.209 

208  See Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68 (1986) (holding that due process requires the state to pay for an expert on insanity if the defendant is indi-
gent). This requirement, however, has been limited by the Court of Criminal Appeals after one expert has already been appointed. See Gonzalez 
v. State, 616 S.W.3d 585, 594 (Tex. Crim. App. 2020), reh’g denied (Mar. 3, 2021) (“If the trial judge appoints an expert, and the defendant requests 
another or a different expert, the trial judge may deny further expert assistance unless the defendant proves that the original appointed expert 
could not adequately assist the defendant.”) (quoting Ex parte Jimenez, 364 S.W.3d 866, 877 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012)).

Qualifications	of	an	Appointed	vs.	Hired	Expert

Note that at least one Texas appellate court has held that the expert qualifications required under 46C.102 
only apply to court-appointed experts.210 Therefore, an expert hired by the state or defense (i.e. an expert 
of  the  Defendant’s/State’s  own  choice)  need  not  meet  the  statutory  qualifications.211  The  trial  court  may, 
however, give much less weight to any expert who does not meet the minimum statutory requirements and 
could potentially exclude that expert’s testimony under Texas Rule of Evidence 702.

8.3.4	

Information	provided	to	experts

The Court shall advise an expert appointed under this article of the facts and circumstances of the offense with 
which the defendant is charged and the elements of the insanity defense. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.101(b).

The State and/or Defense will typically provide the expert with police reports, witness accounts of the alleged 
offense,  or  information  that  would  give  insight  into  the  defendant’s  mental  state  at  the  time  of  the  alleged 
offense.212 Also typically provided are the defendant’s MH/IDD records from any past admission or treatment for 
their condition. Records that predate the alleged event are especially pertinent, as they may show the person had 
a mental health condition that may have impaired their thinking as to know their conduct was wrong at the time 
of the event.

If the State or Defense has hired an “expert of their choice,” that expert is also provided with information from the 
hiring counsel.  Unlike a court-appointed expert, the right to have a mental health professional employed under 
the Ake procedure is part of the defendant’s right to counsel. Unless the expert testifies at trial, the State is not 
entitled to the expert’s report or even access to the expert. Remember that all information given to this expert is 
subject to cross-examination if the expert testifies, therefore the information should be carefully examined before 
being provided to the expert. This becomes especially important for defense counsel, as the State may not have 
known or had access to this information otherwise. 

Ideally, the expert would have the following items available for review:

•  Police reports;

•  Police videos;

•  Any other video of the incident or time around the alleged offense;

•  Statements from the defendant or video of the defendant;

•  Witness statements;

•  The defendant’s mental health history;

•  Situational history of the defendant in the time leading up to the offense;

•  Video of the defendant around the time of the event (possibly made by defense counsel if defendant is in 

psychosis when first meeting counsel);

•  Contact  information  of  friends  or  family  members  who  can  provide  accurate  historical  data  on  the 

defendant; and

•  The opportunity to meet the defendant as close to the time of the incident as possible if there is a very 

evident psychotic event occurring.

Benefits	of	Providing	Information	Upfront

The  more  information  provided  up  front  to  the  expert  can  expedite  the  insanity  evaluation  and  report 
timeline. It can take months to request and receive all the necessary information that the expert requires 
to complete the insanity report. If the State or Defense already have records, providing them to the expert, 
instead of making the expert request the records for themselves, will save time and money. Alternatively, 
some experts use a release of information signed by the defendant and get a list of mental health providers 
or prior hospitalizations to expedite records requests. 

8.3.5	

If	the	Defendant	will	not	Comply

The court may order a defendant to submit to an examination to determine the issue of insanity. 

Penalties  may  be applied  for a defendant’s  failure  to cooperate with a state expert,  including exclusion of  the 
defense expert’s testimony from trial.213 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.104.

8.3.5a	 Defendant’s	Right	to	Elect	NOT	to	use	an	Insanity	Defense

The previous subsection (8.3.5) pertains to the situation when the defendant wants to use the insanity defense 
for his benefit but doesn’t want to cooperate with the state’s expert. The current subsection examines when the 
defendant does not want to use the insanity defense in the case at all; when the defendant would rather plead not 
guilty and pursue innocence, or plead guilty and face traditional punishments. 

The question of whether a lawyer can insist on an insanity defense against a client’s wishes has been addressed by 
case law in a variety of ways:

• 

In Godinez v. Moran,214 the U.S. Supreme Court held that if a defendant was competent to stand trial, they 
were automatically competent to plead guilty, and thereby waive the panoply of trial rights, including 
the right to counsel. 

The question then becomes, do we infer from this that if a client is competent, they can competently waive the 
use of the insanity defense? 

• 

In 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court held, in McCoy v. Louisiana, that defense counsel may not admit the 
defendant’s guilt over the defendant’s express objection to the contrary.215 

•  A recent Dallas Court of Appeals case held that when a client expressly asserts that the objective of “his 
defen[s]e is to maintain innocence of the charged criminal acts, his lawyer must abide by the objective 
and may not override it by conceding guilt.”216 Note, however, that a petition for discretionary review was 
granted by the CCA in July 2021. 

And because insanity is an affirmative defense, it requires admitting the charged conduct occurred.

213  Soria v. State, 933 S.W.2d 46 at 35 (citing Karstetter v. Cardwell, 526 F.2d 1144, 1145 (9th Cir. 1975))(holding that in the context of an insanity 
exam, “once a defendant indicates his intention to invoke the insanity defense and present expert testimony on the issue, he may be ordered to 
submit to a psychiatric examination by psychiatrists available to testify for the government, and his refusal to talk to the State’s psychiatrists may 
be sanctioned by the court at the least by exclusion of defendant’s own experts’ testimony on the insanity issue”); see Estelle v. Smith, 451 U.S. 
454, 468 L. Ed. 2d 359, 101 S. Ct. 1866 (1981); Buchanan v. Kentucky, 483 U.S. 402, at 422-23, 97 L. Ed. 2d 336, 107 S. Ct. 2906 (1987); Lagrone v. State,

See also federal case law on the topic:

In 2019, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled it was a violation of the Sixth Amendment 
for counsel to present an insanity defense against the will of the defendant, even if the defendant shows clear signs 
of insanity. United States v. Read, 918 F.3d 712 (9th Cir. 2019).

•  Frendak  v.  United  States,  408  A.2d  364  (D.C.  1979).  If  the  defendant  appears  to  be  intelligently  and 
voluntarily waiving the insanity defense, the trial court should not deny this. However, the trial court 
should look into whether the defendant has been properly informed of the effects of their decision as 
well as the alternatives available to them. Thus, the nature of such an evaluation would be similar to a 
competency to stand trial evaluation.

8.3.6	 Examination	When	Out	on	Bail

A defendant, who is free on bail, may also be compelled to submit to an examination. If the defendant fails to 
attend the examination or refuses to submit to the examination, the court may order that the defendant be held 
in custody. Custody may include a facility operated by HHSC, however, it is significantly more likely that the 
defendant would be taken into custody at the local jail to await examination. 

Legal	vs.	Practical

In  the  circumstance  where  the  court  compels  a  defendant  to  submit  to  an  examination  by  ordering  the 
defendant  into  custody,  legally,  the  defendant  may  be  held  for  examination  at  a  State  Hospital,  State 
Supported Living Center, or any other facility operated by the Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC). 
By statute, however, the court may not order a defendant to a facility operated by HHSC for examination 
without the consent of the head of that facility. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.104.

Practically speaking, HHSC has NOT consented to this type of admission in over 20 years. With State Hospital 
wait lists already full, due to 46B or 46C commitment orders, there is no reason to order (or the State Hospital 
to consent to admitting) a person into a State Hospital for an evaluation that can adequately take place in a 
host of other available settings, including local county jails.

8.3.7	 One	Expert	May	Evaluate	for	Insanity	and	Competency

An expert appointed to examine the defendant regarding sanity may also examine the defendant for competency 
to  stand  trial,  but  the  appointing  court  and  parties  should  be  aware  of  the  limitation  described  in  the  next 
subsection. If an expert is evaluating for both, and the expert determines that the defendant is competent, then 
the expert may proceed with an insanity evaluation. In such a case, the expert must file with the court separate 
reports concerning the defendant’s insanity defense and competency to stand trial. 

8.3.7a		Defendant	Must	be	Competent	to	Be	Examined	for	Insanity

If the expert determines that the defendant is not competent to stand trial, the expert must halt their examination 
and  may  not examine  the defendant  for  the  purposes of determining  the defendant’s sanity.  In  this case,  the 
expert may not file a report regarding the defendant’s sanity.217 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.103.

For  this  reason,  it  is good  practice  to  have  the  expert conduct  a  competency evaluation  before evaluating  for 
insanity.

Insanity Exam

8.4.1	 What	Tests	Do	the	Experts	Conduct

Limitations	on	Performance	Validity	Measures

Validation of Malingering & Effort Tests for an IDD population

A variety of standardized tests exist to examine whether an individual is malingering or failing to put forth 
full  effort  when  being  tested  for  mental  illness  or  insanity.  These  types  of  tests  are  sometimes  called 
Neurocognitive performance validity measures. If the results of the test indicate that a defendant is malingering 
or failing to put forth effort on the psychological tests, the State will likely use this information to refute a 
claim of insanity in a criminal case.

According to DSM-5, “the essential feature of malingering is the intentional production of false or grossly 
exaggerated  physical  or  psychological  symptoms,  motivated  by  external  incentives  such  as  .  .  .  evading 
criminal  prosecution.”  Malingering  is  not  a  psychiatric  disorder;  DSM-5  includes  it  in  the  section  «Other 
Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention.»218

One thing to keep in mind for these tests, is that if it is believed that the defendant has, or may have, IDD, 
then the type of test that the person is given to determine malingering/effort, must be validated on a subject 
population  that  also  has  IDD.  Neurocognitive  performance  validity  measures  may  produce  a  result  that 
falsely  indicates  the  person  is  malingering  or  not  putting  forth  full  effort  for  an  individual  who  has  a  low 
intelligence level if the test was scaled using typical intelligence individuals. 

8.4.2	 Factors	Considered	During	the	Insanity	Examination

Three basic questions the sanity evaluator must answer, and which should be clearly discussed in the expert’s 
report:219

1) 

“Did the defendant suffer from a mental disorder at the time of the alleged crime? (retrospective mental 
state evaluation)?

2)  “Was there a relationship between the mental disorder and the criminal behavior? 

3)  “If so, were the criteria met for the jurisdiction’s legal test for being found not criminally responsible?”

A sanity evaluator engages in a thorough face-to-face examination, to include a psychiatric history and possibly 
psychological testing. This time spent face-to-face with the defendant will allow the expert to build a rapport, or 
a sense of trust, with the defendant so the defendant feels comfortable telling the expert the truth; and gather 
information and form their official opinion. 

Psychiatric  and/or  psychological  records,  medical  records,  and  school/occupational  records,  along  with  the 
criminal charges and any available discovery, confession and/or interrogation statements, are routinely reviewed. 

Collateral  information  from  family and  friends, especially those with access to the defendant during the time 
surrounding the offense, and witnesses may allow for a more accurate evaluation of their mental state and could 
be used to compare/contrast information gleaned from the examination.

their state of mind (including orientation, and the presence of any psychotic symptoms – delusions or 
hallucinations – affecting their behavior),220

The clinical interview generally includes inquiries into:

the defendant’s account of the crime,

• 

• 

•  motive for the act,

•  planning and preparation, and

•  any attempts to conceal the crime after the fact.

Psychological testing and structured assessments may assist the sanity evaluator in their case formulation and 
could include:

• 

IQ testing [Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV); Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-IV)]

•  Personality testing [Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2); Millon Clinical Multiaxial 

Inventory (MCMI-IV)]

•  Rogers Criminal Responsibility Assessment Scales (R–CRAS)

•  Malingering testing [Malingering Probability Scale (MPS); Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms 

(SIRS-2); Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM); Validity Indicator Profile (VIP)]

•  Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R)

8.4.2a	 Hypotheses	that	Should	be	Assessed	in	a	Valid	Insanity	Evaluation

Following  the  scientific  method,  the  expert  will  need  to  consider  and  find  evidence  to  prove  or  disprove  the 
following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 1: The person has a mental disease or defect, but such impairment did not result in an inability 
to understand their  behavior was wrong at the time of the offense, and therefore does  not  meet  legal 
criteria for insanity.

Hypothesis 2: The person has a mental disease or defect, and the mental impairment was severe enough to 
prevent him/her from understanding their conduct was wrong and thus meets legal criteria for insanity.

Hypothesis 3: The person does not have a mental disease or defect and is attempting to feign impairment 
and therefore does not meet criteria for legal insanity.

Hypothesis 4: The person was under the influence of mind-altering substances and any mental impairment 
that was present at the time of the offense is a direct result of intoxication and therefore does not meet 
legal criteria for insanity.

Hypothesis 5: The person’s motivation for the offense has a rational motive that is separate from mental 
illness, such as  the conduct can  be attributed  to an antisocial  motivation,  monetary gain, revenge, or 
personality factors related to sadism.

8.4.3  Right to Counsel During Examination  

The Defendant does not have a constitutional right to have counsel present during the psychiatric examination.221 

The Texas  Court of  Criminal Appeal reasoned  that  “[b]ecause of  the  intimate, personal and  highly subjective 
nature of a psychiatric examination, the presence of a third party in a legal or non-medical capacity would severely 
limit the efficacy of the examination.”222

8.4.4  Compensation or Reimbursement by the County

The county in which the indictment was returned, or information was filed is responsible for paying the appointed 
experts and that county is also responsible for reimbursing the examining facility for any reasonable expenses that 
were incurred during the examination. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.106.

8.5 

Report on Insanity

The report must include a description of the procedures used in the examination, and the examiner’s observations 
and findings pertaining to the insanity defense. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.105(b).

Beyond	Statutory	Requirements:	Marks	of	a	Quality	Expert’s	Report

•  Conveys all relevant information concisely, unambiguously, and clearly, including the facts and reasoning the 

expert used in formulating the opinion.

• 

• 

It is a stand-alone document in that it provides or reproduces the data needed to support the opinions the 
expert expresses?

States clearly any limitations (e.g., limited access to the defendant or to requested records, defendant’s lack of 
cooperation) of which the expert is aware.

•  Contains  clinical  data  regarding  the  nature  of  the  defendant’s  mental  and  emotional  condition  that  are 
specifically relevant to the insanity analysis, individually addressing criminal responsibility for each charge (if 
more than one offense was committed).

•  Comments on any contradictions or inconsistencies, including reporting on alternative scenarios and opinions.

• 

Is free of gratuitous comments about the defendant’s behavior, need for incapacitation, dangerousness, lack 
of remorse, or other legal matters. 

8.5.1	 Second	Report	from	Expert

The examiner must also submit a separate report stating their observations and findings concerning whether the 
defendant is a person with a mental illness and requires court-ordered mental health services, pursuant to the 
Health and Safety Code. The report can also include observations and findings concerning whether the defendant 
is a person with an intellectual and developmental disability (IDD).223 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.105(c).

8.5.2  Timeline

The expert’s written report is due 30 days after the examination is ordered. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.105(a). 
In reality, reports are rarely returned in this 30-day period. This delay is typically due to delays in receiving mental health 
records, as well as the issues listed in the box below. 

Practical	Issues	in	Credible	Insanity	Evaluations224

• 

The  complexity  of  the  case  determines  how  long  it  will  take  to  complete  the  evaluation.  For  example, 
misdemeanor  cases  usually  have  limited  discovery  to  review.  However,  a  murder  case/aggravated  assault 
case may have thousands of pages of discovery, videotaped police interviews, bodycam videos, etc. Watching 
the police interview is imperative as it gives the most accurate assessment of a defendant’s mental state at the 
time of the offense (if the interview occurred soon after offense). This holds true for bodycam videos as well. 
Police interviews can be lengthy and generally require watching them more than once to catch all that is being 
said and to observe the defendant.

•  While a full competency evaluation may not have been requested, a defendant’s mental state and competence 
at  the  time  of  the  sanity  evaluation  must  be  considered  as  they  may  influence  the  defendant’s  ability  to 
adequately  engage  in  the  examination  and  may  negatively  impact  their  case.  Concerns  of  incompetence 
should be communicated to the requesting party(ies). 

•  Reviewing witness interviews (if there are any witnesses) can provide additional information about whether 
the  defendant was  observed  to  be  exhibiting psychotic  symptoms  around  the  offense.  The  time  it  takes  to 
review witness interviews depends on the case. Some cases have none, some have one or two, and some have 
several. 

• 

Interviewing  family/friends  who  had  interactions  with  the  defendant  around  the  time  of  the  offense  also 
provides information concerning whether the defendant was showing signs of a mental illness. These interviews 
also provide historical information about diagnoses and outpatient/inpatient mental health treatment of the 
defendant.

•  Past mental health records (especially if the defendant was found incompetent prior to the insanity evaluation) 
are informative as records may provide information on whether the defendant has a history of malingering, 
medication compliance, and diagnoses. If the defendant was found incompetent on the instant offense, state 
hospital records are often helpful as they contain statements the person made about their mental state at the 
time of the offense, as well as diagnoses and if there were observations of malingering. 

•  While  psychological  testing  and  structured  assessments  may  assist  the  sanity  evaluator  in  their  case 
formulation, the appointed expert may not be trained in the use of a specific test, thus needing to rely on a 
third party for the test administration and interpretation. 

•  Obtaining mental health records can take up to 3 to 4 months once they are requested.

• 

The time with direct contact with the defendant is highly variable. A delusional and guarded person may take 
several hours and multiple evaluation sessions before a full accounting of their mental state and motivations 
for behavior is obtained. 

•  Malingering/credibility assessment must be conducted to ensure the accused if not exaggerating or outright 
feigning symptoms to avoid prosecution. Otherwise, the integrity and validity of the evaluation is questionable. 
It also takes significant time to score and analyze malingering assessments.

• 

The time it takes to write an insanity evaluation is dependent upon the case. A simple insanity evaluation is 
usually around 8 pages. A complicated insanity case can be up to 40 pages in length. It is generally estimated 
that it takes 30 minutes to write one page (without editing). Thus, writing the report can take 4 to 20 hours.

8.6	

Procedure	Following	the	Examination

8.6.1	 Exchange	of	the	Evaluations

The court will give copies of the expert report to the prosecuting attorney and the defendant’s attorney. Tex. Code 
Crim. Proc. art. 46C.105(a).

Typically, the defense does not have to turn over the forensic examination completed by the “expert of the defense’s 
own choice” expert until or unless it is determined that the defense expert will testify.

Ex	Parte	Investigation	of	Insanity

The Defense has no obligation to provide notice or a copy of the report to the State during the period of time when 
they are merely investigating the possibility of insanity. Subject, of course, to the statutory notice requirements. 
This remains true even if the defense received funding ex parte from the court under Ake to hire an expert for an 
indigent defendant to investigate insanity. 

If insanity is investigated ex parte and it is determined the insanity defense will be pursued, then the defense will 
provide the notice and report to the state. 

8.6.2	 Agreed	Result:	Defendant	Sane	at	Time	of	the	Commission	of	the	Offense

The case then proceeds as a typical criminal case, as if the issue if insanity was not raised. 

8.6.3	 Agreed	Result:	Defendant	Insane	at	the	Time	of	the	Commission	of	the	Offense

8.6.3a	 Agreed	Dismissal	of	Charging	Document	or	Stipulation	to	NGRI

Even though an agreed dismissal with an entry of a judgment of dismissal due to the defendant’s insanity has 
the same effect as a judgment stating that the defendant has been found not guilty by reason of insanity, some 
prosecutors may request the finding of NGRI instead of a dismissal, and the parties each stipulate to the facts and 
have the judge enter a formal judgment under 46C.152(c). Tex. Code Crim. Proc. arts. 46C.152(b)-(c), 46C.153(c).

A stipulation should strictly state the facts that are stipulated by the party. Suggested language includes:

•  The Defendant is waiving the right to trial by jury and admitting that the State can meet each element of 

its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

•  The State is waiving its right to a jury trial and admitting that the defense can meet its burden of proving 

insanity by a preponderance of the evidence.225 

Court’s	Jurisdiction	Continues 
with	Agreed	Dismissal	or	Stipulation	to	NGRI

In the situation where there is an agreed dismissal due to insanity or an agreed stipulation to NGRI, depending 
on the type of case, the Court can still have continued jurisdiction over the case, just as if the jury returned a 
verdict of NGRI. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.158. See infra Section 8.9: Continued Jurisdiction of the Court Based 
on Dangerousness.

8.6.4  Disputed Result: Insanity Trial

8.6.4a	 Evidence	

A Defendant is acquitted of the crime they are charged with and determined to be NGRI if:

•  The prosecution has established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant committed the charged 

offense; and

The defense establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant was insane at the time of the 
offense. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.153(a).

 ◦

Note that if the defendant had previously been adjudicated NGRI, this defense burden may shift to the state 
to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant was sane at the time of the offense. See 
infra Section 8.10: Burden Shift. 

The court,  the attorney  representing  the  state, or  the attorney  for  the defendant  may  not  inform a  juror or a 
prospective juror of the consequences to the defendant if a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity is returned. 
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.154.

8.6.4b	 Admissibility	of	Statements	Made	During	Examination

The insanity defense is an affirmative one, initiated by the Defendant. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has 
likened initiating psychiatric examination, and then presenting psychiatric testimony in court, to the defendant 
taking the stand: “a defendant waives his Fifth Amendment rights to a limited extent by presenting psychiatric 
testimony on his behalf.”226

Statements made by a defendant during an insanity evaluation/examination are admissible and do not enjoy Fifth 
Amendment protections against self-incrimination.227 

Also, Sixth Amendment protections only require defendant’s counsel to be notified of any psychiatric evaluation 
or examination and do not require counsel’s presence.228

8.6.4c	 Determination	of	Sanity	Issue	by	Jury

The  issue  of  the  defendant’s  insanity  is  submitted  to  the  jury  and  considered  by  the  jury  only  if  the  issue  is 
supported by competent evidence. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.151(a).

If the issue is submitted to the jury, then the jury shall determine and specify in their verdict whether the defendant 
is guilty, not guilty, or not guilty by reason of insanity. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.151(b).

An entry of judgment entered in this manner has the same effect as a judgment stating that the defendant has 
been found not guilty by reason of insanity. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.153.

8.6.4d	 Determination	of	Sanity	Issue	by	Judge

If a jury trial is waived, and if the issue is supported by competent evidence, then the judge will determine the 
issue of the defendant’s sanity. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.152(a).

The parties may also, with consent of the judge, agree to have the judge determine the issue of the defendant’s 
sanity on the basis of introduced or stipulated competent evidence, or both. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.152(b).

If the judge determines the issue of the defendant’s sanity, the judge shall enter a finding of guilty, not guilty, or 
not guilty by reason of insanity. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.152(c).

Threshold	Requirement	of	Competent	Evidence

To  obtain  a  jury  instruction  concerning  the  insanity  defense,  the  defendant  must  produce  some  credible 
evidence (also called “competent evidence”) of his insanity at the time of the offense.

In Kelly v. State,229 the court held that none of the testimony given in the case established a “definite opinion” 
regarding the defendant›s insanity at the time of the offense. There was testimony by the victim, members of 
the defendant›s family, as well as that of first responders and a physician alluding to the fact that defendant 
wasn›t  “himself,”  his  behavior  that  day  was  “significantly  abnormal,”  and  that,  afterwards,  he  seemed  to 
suffer  from  some  “mental  disease  or  defect.”  Despite  this  testimony  regarding  the  defendant›s  behavior, 
none of the witnesses expressed a “definite opinion” or “conclusion” regarding the defendant›s insanity and 
the court of appeals upheld the trial court›s decision that the defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction 
on the insanity defense.230

8.7	

Finding	of	NGRI		

8.7.1	 NGRI	is	Considered	an	Acquittal

A person who is found not guilty by reason of insanity stands acquitted of the charged offense and may not be 
considered a person charged with an offense. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.155(a). For this reason, this judgment 
cannot be used against the defendant for future enhancement purposes. 

Additionally, double jeopardy protections prevent another attempt by the prosecution to convict the defendant 
of the same offense.

That being said, a defendant found not guilty by reason of insanity is not considered acquitted for the purposes 
of expunction. 

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.155.

8.7.2	 Written	Judgment

A formal written judgment “adjudicates” the defendant as acquitted (NGRI), thus making them the acquitted 
person. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.156.

8.7.3	 Necessary	Findings	in	Judgment

In each case in which the insanity defense is raised, the judgment must reflect whether the defendant was found 
guilty, not guilty, or not guilty by reason of insanity.

If the defendant was found not guilty by reason of insanity, the judgment must:

• 

specify the offense of which the defendant was found not guilty,

•  State  and  the  determination  made  by  the  Judge  regarding  whether  the  offense  involved  Dangerous 

Conduct (as statutorily defined).  

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.156, 46C.157.

The finding of whether the conduct involved dangerous conduct determines whether the court retains jurisdiction 
(and the defendant stays under the trial court’s supervision) or loses jurisdiction (and the defendant is placed in 
civil court proceedings). Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.158; 46C.201.

8.8	

Procedures	and	Proceedings	Following	a	finding	of	NGRI

8.8.1	 Use	of	a	Jury	in	Chapter	46C	Proceedings

The following proceedings under 46C must be before the court, and the underlying matter determined by the 
court, unless the acquitted person or the state requests a jury trial or the court on its own motion sets the matter 
for jury trial:

4)  a hearing on disposition under Article 46C.253;

5)  a proceeding for renewal of an order under Article 46C.261;

6)  a proceeding on a request for modification or revocation of an order under Article 46C.266; and

7)  a proceeding seeking discharge of an acquitted person under Article 46C.268.

The following proceedings may not be held before a jury:

1)  a  proceeding  to  determine  outpatient  or  community-based  treatment  and  supervision  under  Article 

2)  a proceeding to determine modification or revocation of outpatient or community-based treatment and 

46C.262; or

supervision under Article 46C.267.

If a hearing is held before a jury and the jury determines that the person has a mental illness or mental retardation 
and is likely to cause serious harm to another, the court shall determine whether inpatient treatment or residential 
care is necessary to protect the safety of others.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.255.

8.8.2	 Detention	Pending	Further	Proceedings

Upon determination of NGRI, the court may order the acquitted person detained in jail or any other suitable place 
for a period not to exceed 14 days pending further proceedings under Chapter 46C. 

The Court may order a defendant held in an HHSC Facility only if the head of that facility consents. 

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.160.

8.8.3	 Determination	Regarding	Dangerous	Conduct	of	Acquitted	Person

After  a  defendant  is  acquitted  as  NGRI  the  court  must  determine  if  the  offense  for  which  the  defendant  was 
acquitted  involved  Dangerous  Conduct.  Dangerous  Conduct  means  that  the  offense  which  the  person  was 
acquitted involved conduct that:

caused serious bodily injury (SBI) to another person;

placed another person in imminent danger of SBI; or

consisted of a threat of SBI through use of a deadly weapon.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.157.

8.9	

Continued	Jurisdiction	of	the	Court	Based	on	Dangerousness

Chapter 46C treats differently individuals who committed acts that involved dangerous conduct from those who 
did not. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.158; 46C.201.

8.9.1	 Offense	Involved	Dangerous	Conduct

If the acquitted offense involved Dangerous Conduct, the criminal court retains jurisdiction over the acquitted 
person until either: 

the court discharges the person and terminates its jurisdiction under Art. 46C.268; (see infra 8.10.2j
Discharge section of this chapter)
or

the cumulative total period of institutionalization and outpatient or community-based treatment and
supervision  under  the  court’s  jurisdiction  equals  the  maximum  term  provided  by  law  for  the  offense
of  which  the  person  was  acquitted  by  reason  of  insanity  and  the  court’s  jurisdiction  is  automatically
terminated under Art. 46C.269.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.158.

Note that enhancements cannot be used to determine the length of the court’s jurisdiction over the acquitted 
person.231

8.9.2	 Offense	Did	Not	Involve	Dangerous	Conduct

If  the  acquitted  offense did  not involve  dangerous conduct, the criminal  court must  then  determine if  there 
is  evidence  to  support  a  finding of mental  illness  or  ID.  If  the  court  makes  this  finding,  then  the  criminal 
court  SHALL  enter  an  order  transferring  the  person  to  the  appropriate  court  for  civil  comment  proceedings. 
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.201(a).

The Civil Commitment proceedings are to determine whether the person should receive court-ordered mental 
health services under Subtitle C, Title 7, Health and Safety Code, or be committed to a residential care facility 
to  receive  IDD  services  under  Subtitle  D,  Title  7,  Health  and  Safety  Code.  Tex.  Code  Crim.  Proc.  art. 
46C.201(b).

The civil court may also order the person either detained in jail or any other suitable place pending the prompt 
initiation and  prosecution  of  appropriate  civil  proceedings  or  placed  in  the  care  of  a  reasonable  person  on 
satisfactory  security being given for the acquitted person’s proper care and protection. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. 
art. 46C.201(b).

The acquitted person may be placed in a commission facility pending a civil hearing only with the consent of 
the head  of  the  facility  and  an  order  of  protective  custody  issued  under  Subtitle  C  or  D,  Title  7,  Health  and 
Safety Code. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.202.

If  the  court  does  not  detain  or  place  the  person  as  specified  in  art.  46C.201(b),  explained  above,  then  the 
court  shall release the person. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.202(b).

A	Previous	Adjudication	of	NGRI	or	Incompetency

Burden	Shift	for	Future	NGRI	Cases

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has held that if a defendant has a prior adjudication for incompetency 
or a prior adjudication of insanity, the burden of proof shifts to the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt 
that a defendant was competent to stand trial or sane at the time of the commission of the offense.232

“Where there has been a prior adjudication of insanity that has not been vacated, the burden falls upon the 
State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the subject was sane at the time of the commission of the 
offense.”233  

What	Triggers	this	Burden	Shift?

A prior, unvacated adjudication of incompetency or insanity.

8.10.1a	 If	the	court	determines	that	there	is	evidence	of	mental	illness	or	IDD

If the court determines that there is evidence that the NGRI acquitted individual may have mental illness or IDD, 
the court shall enter an order transferring the person to the appropriate court for civil commitment proceedings. 

Those proceedings will determine whether the person should receive court-ordered mental health services under 
Subtitle C, Title 7, Health and Safety Code, or be committed to a residential care facility to receive IDD services, 
under Subtitle D, Title 7, Health and Safety Code. 

A person placed in a commission facility pending the above civil hearing may be detained only with the consent 
of the head of the facility and under an Order of Protective Custody.238 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.202.

The court may also order the person to be detained in jail pending civil proceedings or placed in the care of a 
responsible  person on  satisfactory  security  being given  for  the acquitted  person’s  proper care and  protection.  
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.201.

If the court does not detain the person or place the person in services through HHSC, then the court shall release 
the person. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.202.

8.10.2	 Finding	of	Dangerous	Conduct

8.10.2a  Commitment	for	Evaluation	&	Report

The court will order the acquitted person to be committed for evaluation of the person’s current mental condition 
and for treatment. The commitment will occur in a facility designated by the HHSC and cannot exceed a period 
of 30 days. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.251.

HHSC has full discretion to determine the state hospital in which the acquitted person will receive the initial 
evaluation and the location of any inpatient care.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.0011. 

The court will order that a report be completed regarding the evaluation of the person’s current mental condition 
and treatment. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.251(c).

8.10.2b	Records	Sent	with	Acquitted	individual	to	the	Treatment	Facility

The court will also order that a transcript of all medical testimony received in the criminal proceeding be prepared 
and forwarded to the facility. The court will also order the following information about the person be forwarded 
to the facility:

•  The complete name, race, and gender of the person;

•  Any known identifying number of the person, including social security number, driver’s license number, 

or state identification number;

•  The person’s date of birth; and

•  The offense of which the person was found not guilty by reason of insanity and a statement of the facts 

and circumstances surrounding the alleged offense. 

The court will also order  that a  report  under  Article  46C.252  be  filed with  the court  30 days after  the date of 
acquittal  the  court  will  hold  a  hearing  in  order  to  determine  the  proper  disposition  of  the  acquitted  person.

8.10.2c	Report	After	Evaluation

The report ordered under art. 46C.251, must be filed with the court as soon as practicable before the hearing to 
determine the disposition of the acquitted person, but not later than the fourth day before the hearing. 

This report shall address the following issues:  

1)  whether the acquitted person has a mental illness or IDD and, if so, whether the mental illness or IDD is 

severe;

to another;

2)  whether as a result of any severe mental illness or IDD the acquitted person is likely to cause serious harm 

3)  whether as a result of any impairment the acquitted person is subject to commitment under Subtitle C or 

D, Title 7, Health and Safety Code;

4)  prospective treatment and supervision options, if any, appropriate for the acquitted person; and

5)  whether any required treatment and supervision can be safely and effectively provided as outpatient or 

community-based treatment and supervision. 

The report must also state what procedure, techniques, and test were used in the examination of the person. 

The court will receive a packet from the state hospital that should be disbursed to the parties. This packet should 
contain the state hospital report as well as two CMEs – there is a standard CME form used by all the state hospitals. 
Health and Safety Code, Section 574.011. The report must be filed at least 4 days before the hearing. 

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.252.

Legal	vs.	Practical

Statutorily, the State Hospital “must” issue a report within 30 days. Practically speaking, there are many times 
in which an Art. 46C.252 report cannot be made to the court within 26 days of a person’s acquittal. Given 
bed  shortages  and  COVID  complications  the  court  may  have  to  hold  a  hearing  to  be  in  compliance  with 
Art. 46C.251 but not issue a final disposition on the matter until the required evidence can be reasonably 
provided. This may also result in the state hospital requesting a “hold order” so that the person may remain 
in the treatment/evaluation facility pending a substantive hearing and disposition under either Art. 46C.256 
or 46C.257. 

The other alternative for meeting the 30-day requirement is for the Court to order the completion of the 
evaluation locally, instead of by the State Hospital.

8.10.2d		Hearing	on	Disposition	

Within 30 days of acquittal, the court must hold a hearing to determine the proper disposition of the acquitted 
person. At the hearing, the court will address the following:

1)  Whether the person acquitted by reason of insanity has a severe mental illness or intellectual developmental 

disability (IDD).

2)  Whether as a result of any mental illness or IDD the person is likely to cause serious harm to another.

3)  Whether  appropriate  treatment  and  supervision  for  any  mental  illness  or  IDD  rendering  the  person 
dangerous to another can be safely and effectively provided as outpatient or community-based treatment 
and supervision.

The hearing on disposition is to be conducted in the same manner as a hearing on an application for involuntary 
commitment, Tex.  Health  &  Safety  Code Title  7,  Subtitles  C or  D,  §  574.035, except that the use of the  jury  is 
governed by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.255.

8.10.2e	Order	of	the	Court

Depending on the evidence at the hearing, the court can order one of the following. That the acquitted person: 

•  be committed for inpatient or residential treatment and supervision, under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.256.

• 

• 

receive outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision, under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.257.

 ◦ Note that this is ordered if the state fails to establish the grounds required for an order under Article 
46C.256 or 46C.257 but the evidence provides a reasonable basis for believing the acquitted person is 
a proper subject for those proceedings.

8.10.2f  Period	of	Confinement	&	Additional	Hearings

The order of disposition of the court under 46C.253 will then determine what happens next with the acquitted 
person. 

Initial Order

If  the  person  is  initially  ordered  to  inpatient  or  residential  care  commitment,  under  art.  46C.256,  then  that 
initial commitment is for 180 days. The order expires on the 181st day, however, it is subject to renewal under art. 
46C.261 for a period of not more than a year. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.256.

If the person is initially ordered to outpatient or community-based services under art. 46C.257, the initial period 
of commitment is for one year. This too is subject to renewal under art. 46C.261 for a period of not more than a 
year. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.257.

Renewals or Recommitments

Recommitments are then governed under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.261. For recommitment, an application 
for renewal may be made by the institution to which a person is committed, the person responsible for providing 
outpatient or community-based treatment or supervision, or the attorney representing the state. 

The request must explain in detail the reasons why the person requests renewal under this article. A request 
to renew an order committing the person to inpatient treatment must also explain in detail why outpatient  
or community-based treatment and supervision is not appropriate. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.261(b).

The  renewal  must  be  accompanied  by  one  CME  executed  by  a  physician  who  examined  the  person  within  
30 days of the application being filed. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.261(c).

The  request  must  be  filed  at  least  30  days  before  the  commitment  will  expire,  and  the  court  must  act  on  
the request for renewal before the order expires. The court must set the matter for a hearing and appoint an 
attorney to represent the person. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.261(b), (d), (e).

The person is entitled to a hearing before judge or jury, but that hearing can be waived, and the judge can 
make a determination from the certificate and the detailed request for renewal alone. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. 
art. 46C.261(g), 46C.255(a)(2), 46C.261(d)(1). 

If a hearing is held, the person may be transferred from the facility to which the acquitted person was committed 
to  a  jail  for  purposes  of  participating  in  the  hearing  only  if  necessary  but  not  earlier  than  72  hours  before  
the  hearing  begins.  If  the  order  is  renewed,  the  person  shall  be  transferred  back  to  the  facility  immediately  
on renewal of the order. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.261(f).

A court shall renew the order only if the court finds that the party who requested the renewal has established  
by  clear  and  convincing  evidence  that  continued  mandatory  supervision  and  treatment  are  appropriate.  A 
renewed order authorizes continued inpatient commitment or outpatient or community-based treatment and 
supervision for not more than one year. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.261(h).

The  court,  on  application  for  renewal  of  an  order  for  inpatient  or  residential  care  services,  may  modify  the 
 order to provide for outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision if the court finds the acquitted 
person  has  established  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  treatment  and  supervision  can  be  safely  
and effectively provided as outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. 
art. 46C.261(i).

In 2019, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.251 was amended to give HHSC clinical discretion to decide which units 
will be utilized once the patients reach the state hospital. 

This  amendment  took  out  the  requirement  under  CCP  46C.260  that  a  person  found  not  guilty  by  reason  of 
insanity must be sent to a maximum security unit. Under the amended CCP 46C.260, a person found not guilty 
by  reason  of  insanity  will  no  longer  be  automatically  sent  to  maximum  security  unit.  If  a  person  is  sent  to  a 
maximum security unit, they must be evaluated for manifest dangerousness within 60 days or be transferred to a 
non-maximum-security unit.

Transfer of Committed Person to Non-Maximum-Security Facility

A person committed to a facility for the purposes of examination, treatment and supervision will be sent to a 
facility designated by the HHSC.  If a person is initially required by HHSC to be committed to a maximum-security 
unit, their case will be reviewed by a review board pursuant to 25 TAC, Chapter 415, Subchapter G to determine if 
they continue to require treatment in that setting. If the review board indicates they are not manifestly dangerous 
the person will be transferred to a non-maximum-security unit within 60 days. 

The HHSC executive commissioner appoints a review board that consists of five members, including one licensed 
psychiatrist and two people who work directly with persons with mental illnesses or with IDD. The review board 
determines whether the person is manifestly dangerous and requires continued placement in a maximum-security 
unit. If the head of the facility disagrees with the review board’s determination, then the executive commissioner 
will make the decision.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.260. 

8.10.2h	Outpatient	Treatment

The decision to authorize outpatient treatment is up to the court, not the treating physician or treatment team. 
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.253; 46C.257.

The court shall modify the commitment order to direct outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision 
if  at  the  hearing  the  acquitted  person  establishes  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  treatment  and 
supervision can be safely and effectively provided as outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision. 
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.262(f).

In  determining  whether  an  acquitted  person  should  be  ordered  to  receive  outpatient  or  community-based 
treatment and supervision rather than inpatient care or residential treatment, the court shall have as its primary 
concern the protection of society. Protection of Society. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.263(g).

The  order  for  outpatient  treatment  must  identify  the  person  responsible  for  administering  an  ordered  regimen  of 
outpatient treatment and supervision. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.263(f).

The court may order a variety of conditions for the acquitted person while on outpatient treatment. These requirements 
may include that the acquitted person: 

•  participate in a prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric, or psychological care or treatment, and the 

regimen may include treatment with psychoactive medication.

•  be  provided  by  the  appropriate  community  supervision  and  corrections  department  or  the  facility 

administrator of a community center that provides mental health or IDD services.

•  participate in a supervision program funded by the Texas Correctional Office on Offenders with Medical 

or Mental Impairments.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.263(c) – (e).

8.10.2i	 Modification	or	Revocation

Modification or Revocation of Order for Outpatient or Community-Based Treatment and Supervision

The court, on its own motion or the motion of any interested person and after notice to the acquitted person and 
a hearing, may modify or revoke court-ordered outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision. At the 
hearing, the court shall determine whether the state has established clear and convincing evidence that:

The acquitted person failed to comply with the regimen in a manner or under circumstances that cause the court 
to conclude that the person will likely cause serious harm to another if they were allowed to continue outpatient 
or community-based treatment and supervision. 

•  The acquitted person has become likely to cause serious harm to another if provided continued outpatient 

or community-based treatment supervision.

•  After the hearing, the court may take the following action: 

•  Revoke court-ordered outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision and order the person 

committed for inpatient or residential care. 

• 

Impose additional or more stringent terms on continued outpatient or community-based treatment.

An acquitted person is entitled to representation by counsel at the hearing. The court will set a date for a hearing 
no later than 7 days after the motion is filed, but the court may grant one or more continuances of the hearing, 
upon a showing of good cause for delay. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.266.

Frequently this hearing is postponed at the request of a party so that a doctor may do an evaluation of the acquitted 
person to determine further treatment options in the community and whether the acquitted person can still be 
safely monitored in the community. 

Who can request discharge from inpatient commitment or outpatient treatment and supervision:

the head of the facility to which the acquitted person is committed, 

the person responsible for providing the outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision, or

the state.

Mandatory Hearing & Order Deadlines

If the head of the facility where the person is committed makes the request, the court must hold a hearing no later 
than the 14th day after the request. 

If a request is made by an acquitted person, the court must act on the request not later than the 14th day after 
the date of the request.  A hearing under this subsection is at the discretion of the court, except that the court 
shall hold a hearing if the request and any accompanying material indicate that modification of the order may be 
appropriate. If the request is made within 90 days of a previous request for discharge from the acquitted person, 
the court is not required to act on the request except on the expiration of the order or on the expiration of the 90-
day period following the date of the hearing on the previous request.

The court shall rule on the request during or shortly after any hearing that is held and, in any case, not later than 
the 14th day after the date of the request.

The court shall discharge the acquitted person from all court-ordered commitment and treatment and supervision 
and terminate the court’s jurisdiction over the person if the court finds that the acquitted person has established

1. 

the acquitted person does not have a severe mental illness or mental retardation; or

2. 

the acquitted person is not likely to cause serious harm to another because of any severe mental illness 
 
or IDD.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.268.

Termination of Jurisdiction

The jurisdiction of the court over a person covered by this subchapter automatically terminates on the date when 
the cumulative total period of institutionalization and outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision 
imposed under this subchapter equals the maximum term of imprisonment provided by law for the offense of 
which the person was acquitted by reason of insanity.

On the termination of the court’s jurisdiction under this article, the person must be discharged from any inpatient 
treatment or residential care or outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision ordered under this 
subchapter.

An inpatient or residential care facility to which a person has been committed under this subchapter or a person 
responsible for administering a regimen of outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision under this 
subchapter must notify the court not later than the 30th day before the court’s jurisdiction over the person ends 
under this article.

This subchapter does not affect whether a person may be ordered to receive care or treatment under Subtitle C or 
D, Title 7, Health and Safety Code.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.269.

8.10.2k Appeal
(a)   An acquitted person may appeal a judgment reflecting an acquittal by reason of insanity on the basis of the 

following:

1)  a finding that the acquitted person committed the offense; or

2)  a finding that the offense on which the prosecution was based involved conduct that:

(A) caused serious bodily injury to another person;

(B)  placed another person in imminent danger of serious bodily injury; or

(C) consisted of a threat of serious bodily injury to another person through the use of a deadly weapon.

(b)   Either the acquitted person or the state may appeal from:

1)  an Order of Commitment to Inpatient Treatment or Residential Care entered under Article 46C.256;

2)  an Order to Receive Outpatient or Community-Based Treatment and Supervision entered under Article 

46C.257 or 46C.262;

3)  an order renewing or refusing to renew an Order for Inpatient Commitment or Outpatient or Community-

Based Treatment and Supervision entered under Article 46C.261;

4)  an order modifying or revoking an Order for Outpatient or Community-Based Treatment and Supervision 

entered under Article 46C.266 or refusing a request to modify or revoke that order; or

5)  an order discharging an acquitted person under Article 46C.268 or denying a request for discharge of an

8.10.2l  Medications

•  The court can order an acquitted person stay on prescribed psychoactive medication and be supervised 

by probation officer as well as LMHA. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.263(c).

•  A physician at an inpatient facility may request psychoactive medication orders from the court.

As discussed in Section 3.4 of this bench book, Psychoactive Medication Orders, Texas has statutory procedures 
for allowing  the administration of  psychoactive  medications  to a  patient  under court orders.  The  Health and 
Safety Code sets out how a physician can make an application for an order to authorized psychoactive medication. 
Within that statute, the law refers to “. . . 0r other law” where this would be applicable.  An NGRI commitment 
under CCP, Chapter 46C is the “. . . or other law” that is referenced in Health and Safety Code, Section 574.102 
and 574.104(a)(3). Sec. 574.104(a) set out below with emphasis added. For more information on court ordered 
medication, see supra section 3.4.

(a)   A physician who is treating a patient may, on behalf of the state, file an application in a probate court or a 
court with probate  jurisdiction  for an order to authorize the administration of a psychoactive  medication 
regardless of the patient’s refusal if:

1) 

the physician believes that the patient lacks the capacity to make a decision regarding the administration 
of the psychoactive medication;

2)  the physician determines that the medication is the proper course of treatment for the patient;

3)  the patient is under an order for inpatient mental health services under Chapter 574 or other law or an 
application for court-ordered mental health services under section 574.034 or 574.035 of the Texas Health 
and Safety Code has been filed for the patient; and

4)  the patient, verbally or by other indication, refuses to take the medication voluntarily. 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.104(a).

8.11	 Procedure	for	Pre-2005	Insanity	Cases

8.11.1	 Person	adjudicated	NGRI	before	2005,	but	court	still	has	jurisdiction

Most of the pre-2005 statute was incorporated into current 46B, however there are a few exceptions. 

The first exception is the “old law recommitment hearings – unlike the current Article 46C.261 hearings, which 
only require a certificate of medical examination and allow waiver of testimony—were conducted “pursuant to the 
provision of the Mental Health Code, meaning standards of Health and Safety Code §574.035 applied.”240 Another 
difference is that under Chapter 46C, danger to others is the significant factor for recommitment. Under the old 
law, a person could be recommitted if he met the other two Mental Health Code criteria. 1) he is likely to cause 
serious harm to [himself]; or 2) if the committed person meets the “deterioration standard.” This deterioration 
standard is the same standard used as part of in Health and Safety Code 574.035. If the acquitted person is 1) 
suffering  severe  and  abnormal  mental,  emotional,  or  physical  distress;  2)  experiencing  substantial  mental  or 
physical  deterioration  of  the  proposed  patient’s  ability  to  function  independently,  which  is  exhibited  by  the 
proposed patient’s inability, except for reasons of indigence, to provide for the proposed patient’s basic needs, 
including food, clothing, health, or safety; and 3) unable to make a rational and informed decision as to whether 
or not to submit to treatment.

Pre-2005 cases also had a more relaxed standard for revocation or modification. Under the old law, it was enough 
that the person failed to comply with the regimen or if the person’s condition was so deteriorated that out-patient 
care  is  no  longer appropriate.  If a court  found probable cause that the person  had deteriorated under  former 
Article 46.03, he should have been taken into custody and the court should have held a hearing to determine 
whether the person required inpatient treatment or a modification of his outpatient conditions.”241

8.11.1a  Pre-2005	insanity	cases	being	prosecuted	now	use	pre-2005	law.

Occasionally, cases from August 31, 2005 or before that went unsolved, never adjudicated, or are sent back down 
from  the  high courts  for  retrial arise  in our courts.  In  the  rarity  that an older case  becomes an  insanity case, 
knowing which law is applicable is important. 

The act that repealed Former Article 46.03 contained a savings clause, which provided as follows: 

The change in law made by this Act applies only to an offense committed on or 
after the effective date of   this Act [Sept.1, 2005]. An offense committed before 
the  effective  date  of  this  Act  is  covered  by  the  law  in  effect  when  the  offense 
was committed, and the former law is continued in effect for that purpose. For 
purposes of this section, an offense was committed before the effective date of 
this Act if any element of the offense was committed before that date. 

Act effective Sept. 1, 2005, 79th Leg., R.S., ch. 831, § 5, 2005 Tex. Gen. Laws 2841, 2853-54. 

Under the terms of this savings clause, Former Article 46.03 remains in effect for the defendant if the offense 
occurred before September 1, 2005, because it was the operative law at the time of the offense.242

Expunctions	&	Non-Disclosures

9.1 

Expunctions 

An expunction allows for the destruction of all files and records pertaining to an arrest. Individuals who have been 
arrested for misdemeanor and felony offenses are entitled to expunction only if they meet certain requirements. 
These requirements are complex but generally can be defined as follows:

1.  Acquittal after trial.

2.  Pardon

3.  Expiration of statutory time to bring an indictment or information 

4.  Dismissal  after  completion  of  veteran’s  court  program,  completion  of  mental  health  court 

program, completion of any other pre-trial intervention program.

5. 

Indictment or information was brought through error, false information, or absence of probable cause.

6.  Reaching the statute of limitations for the charged offense. 

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 55.01

Justice  Courts and  Municipal  Courts can only  issue expunctions  for offenses  that are punishable  by  fine only.  
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 55.01(B0(2)(b-1).

9.1.1	 Expunctions	and	How	they	Relate	to	Specialty	Courts

9.1.1a	 Mental	Health	Courts

An individual whose case is dismissed after the successful completion of a mental health court program is eligible 
for an Order of Expunction from the original trial court. The trial court may enter an order of expunction no later 
than 30 days after the date of dismissal. No fees may be charged, or costs assessed, for the expunction. Tex. Code 
Crim. Proc. art. 55.01(2)(A)(iii)(b) and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 55.02(1)(a-2).

An individual whose case is dismissed after the successful completion of a veteran’s court program is eligible for 
an order of expunction from the original trial court. The trial court may enter an order of expunction no later than 
30 days after the date of dismissal. No fees may be charged, or costs assessed, for the expunction. Tex. Code Crim.

9.2	

Order	of	Non-Disclosure

An order of nondisclosure of criminal history information is another method that is used to seal an individual’s 
case information from the public. 

Non-violent  defendants  who  complete  their  sentence,  community  supervision,  or  deferred  adjudication 
community supervision are eligible to petition the court for an order of nondisclosure. An order of non-disclosure 
effectively seals the records pertaining to the individual’s arrest and case disposition. Tex. Gov’t Code § 411.074.

9.2.1	 Non-Disclosures	and	How	they	Relate	to	Specialty	Courts

9.2.1a	 Mental	Health	Courts

9.2.1b	 Veterans	Courts

Individuals who successfully complete a veterans treatment court program under Tex. Code of Crim. Proc. art. 124 
are eligible to petition the court for an order of nondisclosure of criminal history information provided that they 
meet the following conditions:

•  They satisfy all of the requirements Tex. Gov’t Code § 411.074 and § 411.0727.

•  They have never been previously convicted of an offense listed in Tex. Code of Crim. Procedure Article 

42A.054(a) or an offense listed in Tex. Code of Crim. Procedure Article 62.001. 

•  Their conviction did not arise as a result of a conviction involving the operation of a motor vehicle while 

intoxicated

treatment court program.

•  They are not convicted of a felony offense within two years of the successful completion of the veteran’s 

A petition for an order of nondisclosure can be made if the individual was convicted, placed on deferred adjudication 
community  supervision,  or  the  case  was  dismissed  under  Section  124.001(b).  The  order  of  nondisclosure  of 
criminal history information only pertains to the disclosure of records pertaining to the offense for which the 
individual entered the veteran’s treatment court program. 

A petition for nondisclosure is filed with the court that placed the individual in the veteran’s treatment court 
program and can only be filed two years after the successful completion of the veteran’s treatment court program. 
Tex. Gov’t Code § 411.0727.

1.2.1	 State	Jails	and	TDCJ	Prisons	

The TDCJ Correctional Institutions Division (CID) is responsible for the confinement of adult felony and state 
jail felony inmates who are sentenced to incarceration in a secure facility. The CID oversees state prisons, pre-
release facilities, psychiatric facilities, Developmentally Disabled Offender Program, medical facilities, transfer 
facilities, state jails, a geriatric facility, and substance abuse felony punishment facilities (SAFPF).

The TDCJ Private Facility Contract Monitoring Oversight Division (PFCMOD) monitors contracts for privately 
operated secure prison facilities to include private correctional centers, private state jail facilities, and SAFPFs.

1.2.2	 Correctional	Managed	Health	Care245

The  correctional  health  care  system  represents  a  collaboration  between  the  state’s  prison  system  and  two 
leading health science centers.  This health care partnership between the TDCJ, Texas Tech University Health 
Sciences Center and the University of Texas Medical Branch is operated under the guidance and direction of the 
Texas Correctional Managed Health Care Committee.  Mental Health Services are provided under applicable 
provisions of its Correctional Managed Health Care Policy Manual246. “The Manual covers the broad array of 
mental health services provided to inmates by the university partners, including topics such as initial mental 
health appraisals and evaluations and access to care. 

The Manual also deals with: 

the referral of inmates to specialized treatment of various kinds, including psychiatric inpatient or crisis 
management, and covers consent for admission to inpatient psychiatric care; 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

informed consent to mental health treatment; 

the right to refuse treatment or services; 

release of information regarding mental health services; and 

forensic information pertaining to mental health services.

The treatment provisions of the Manual cover a wide variety of topics, including:

treatment planning, 

the prescribing of psychoactive drugs, 

•  psychiatric crisis management, 

•  use of restraints with mental health patients, 

•  psychiatric inpatient seclusion,

•  compelled psychoactive medication for mental illness, and 

• 

suicide prevention. 

Other parts of the Manual cover topics such as outpatient sheltered housing, inpatient mental health discharge 
processes,  and  various  matters  related  to  documentation  of  mental  health  services  provided  by  the  prison 
system.247

TCOOMMI		

2.1 

Purpose

The Texas Correctional Office on Offenders with Medical or Mental Impairments (TCOOMMI), once known as 
the Texas Council on Offenders with Mental Impairments, is a part of TDCJ’s Reentry and Integration Division

Established in 1987, the purpose of TCOOMMI is to “provide a formal structure of criminal justice, health and 
human  service  and  other  affected  organizations  to  communicate  and  coordinate  on  policy,  legislative,  and 
programmatic issues affecting offenders with special needs. Special needs include clients with serious, chronic 
and pervasive mental illnesses, intellectual disability, terminal or serious medical conditions, physical disabilities 
and those who are elderly.”

2.2 

Legal Authority

The  powers  and  duties  of  TCOOMMI  are  set  forth  in  Section  614.007,  Health  &  Safety  Code,  and  include 
responsibility  for  determining  the  status  of  offenders  with  mental  impairments  in  the  state  criminal  justice 
system, identifying needed services for offenders with mental impairments, overseeing related tasks associated 
with monitoring, assisting with the evaluation and implementation of various aspects of programs, disseminating 
information about these programs, and developing pilot projects. 

As set forth in the applicable part of these statutes, Section 614.013, Health & Safety Code, gives TCOOMMI the 
authority and responsibility to coordinate and monitor the development and implementation of memoranda of 
understanding establishing the respective responsibilities of the TDCJ, HHSC, DPS, representatives of LMHA/
LIDDAs, and the directors of community supervision and corrections departments. These agencies are responsible 
for instituting and maintaining a continuity of care and service program for offenders with mental impairments 
in the criminal justice system.248

TCOOMMI  funds  programs  in  many  aspects  of  the  criminal  justice  continuum.  The  qualifying  diagnoses  for 
TCOOMMI services are:

Contracts	with	LMHAs	

TCOOMMI contracts with 39 LMHAs across the state of Texas. A Program Specialist Vendor (PSV) is assigned  
to each TCOOMMI program  for  the purpose of compliance  monitoring and  to act as a  liaison  between TDCJ  
and the LMHA. 

•  Referral to aftercare treatment for those released from custodial institutions or other referral sources; 

Contracted services include:

•  Screening and assessments; 

•  Psychiatric services; 

•  Medication management; 

•  Benefit assistance; and

•  Referrals  to  community  resources.  Individuals  receive  services  based  on  their  level  of  care  needs,  to 

include:

 ◦

 ◦

 ◦

 ◦

case management services, 

continuity of care coordination, 

court resource diversion programs, and 

placement into dual diagnosis residential programs.

TCOOMMI  also  provides  pre-release  screening  and  referral  to  aftercare  treatment  services  for  special  needs 
offenders referred from CID, SAFPF, local jails, or other referral sources.

The services to be performed are based on the contracts and may vary by location. At a minimum, offenders will 
receive screening and assessment, an appointment with a physician, and medication management.

Judges	Can	NOT	Order	an	Offender	into	a	Certain	TDCJ	Program

When a defendant is sentenced to TDCJ or State Jail, the trial court does not have the authority to dictate to 
TCOOMMI which dorm or prison programs that an offender must partake in once a defendant is sentenced 
to time and sent to prison. 

2.5		

Service	Level	Designation

To  determine  the  service  level  designation,  special  needs  offenders  are  assessed  with  the  Adult  Needs  and 
Strengths Assessment (ANSA) and assigned to one of the following:

• 

Intensive Case Management (ICM) caseload; 

•  Transitional Case Management (TCM) caseload; or

•  Continuity of Care (COC) services.249

2.5.1	 TCOOMMI	Intensive	Case	Management

Intensive Case Management (ICM) focuses on high risk/high clinical needs of clients. This level of service utilizes 
the Texas  Resiliency and  Recovery  (TRR)  measure as well as the parole or probation risk  measures. This  level 
of service includes 3.5 hours of comprehensive team-oriented services and monthly contact with a supervising 
officer. The caseload ratio is typically 25 to 1. The ANSA authorized level of care indicates intensive services are 
appropriate and the client’s risk score is moderate, moderate high or high. 

2.5.2	 TCOOMMI	Transitional	Care	Management

Transitional Case Management (TCM) is for offenders who have a severe and persistent mental illness. In order 
to be eligible for this program, offenders must be lower risk and have a level of functioning that does not require 
intensive care in order for them to reintegrate into the community.250 TCM focuses on moderate risk/moderate 
clinical need clients and utilizes the TRR measure as well as the parole or probation risk measures. This level 
of service includes 1.5 hours of transition/stepdown oriented services and monthly contact with a supervising 
officer. The caseload ration is typically 75 to 1. The ANSA authorized level of care indicates moderate services are 
appropriate and the client’s risk score is low-moderate, moderate, or moderate high.

2.5.3	 TCOOMMI	Continuity	of	Care	Services

Continuity of Care Programs (COC) are community-based programs designed to provide a responsive system for 
local referrals from parole, probation, jail, family, and other related agencies.  Services may include:

•  Pre-release identification and provision of community referral; 

•  Post-release referrals from parole, probation, jails, and other agencies; 

•  COC appointments set pre-release;

•  Pre-release veterans coordination; 

•  Psychiatric and medication services; 

•  Coordination and ongoing collaboration with supervision officers.

The program is offered up to 90 days to engage and successfully transition persons back into the community. The 
goal of 90 days of services is to act as a bridge to ensure a stable and successful transition between criminal justice 
systems and the community, while assisting the individual on their path to independent living and self-sufficiency 
through cost-effective community alternatives to  incarceration. TCOOMMI served over  42,000 offenders with 
their continuity of care efforts in FY 2018.251

As one of the agency’s early reports to the legislature stated, “[b]y identifying offenders who are in need of aftercare 
treatment prior to their release, the offenders’ chances for a more successful re-entry into the community are 
improved.  This  is  particularly  true  for  offenders  who  have  a  history  of  non-compliance  due  to  mental  health 
issues.”252 

To ensure that continuity of care is delivered as intended, the TCOOMMI collaborates with state agencies and 
other TDCJ divisions to coordinate access to services. Additionally, the TCOOMMI has entered into agreements 
with LMHAs across the state.253

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 614.013 sets forth the COC program for Offenders with Mental Impairments.

TCOOMMI	Program	Specifications

Most TCOOMMI programs require a memorandum of understanding between all the participating parties, 
(typically including: TDCJ, HHSC, DPS, and representatives of LMHAs and LIDDAs). These memorandums of 
understanding set for the authority, purpose, agreements, and responsibilities of the parties regarding each 
program, and can be found in the Texas Administrative Code, 37 TAC § 159. 

2.5.4  Early Release Due to Mental Illness

Texas  Government  Code  Section  508.146,  Medically  Recommended  Intensive  Supervision,  authorizes  the 
possibility of an early release from incarceration for many crimes for certain inmates with mental illness (or other 
medical conditions delineated in the act), but subject to intensive medical supervision. 

Before an inmate is released with the appropriate medical supervision, the parole panel must determine that the 
inmate with mental illness does not pose a threat to public safety. Also, the medical supervision plan must be 
coordinated with TCOOMMI. That Office has traditionally focused its resources on those with the most serious 
medical problems.254

2.5.4a	 	Statute: Texas	Government	Code,	Section	508.146-Medically	Recommended	 

Intensive	Supervision 

a)  Determined and designated by parole board.  

b)  An inmate may be released on medically recommended intensive supervision only if the inmate is medially 
recommended intensive supervision plan under Subsection 508.146(a)(3) is approved by TCOOMMI. 

c)  The  parole  panel  shall  require  that  the  releasee  remain  under  the  care  of  a  physician  in  a  medically 
suitable placement. At least once each calendar quarter TCOOMMI shall report to the parole panel on 
the releasee’s medical and placement status. From that report the parole panel may modify conditions of 
release and impose a condition that a releasee must reside in a halfway house or community residential 
facility.   

d)  TCOOMMI and Texas Dept. of Health and Human Services shall jointly request proposals from public 
and  private  vendors  to  provide  services  for  inmates  released  on  medically  intensive  supervision.  The 
request for proposals may require services be provided in a medical facility in an urban area.  

•  Offenses not eligible for Medically Recommended Intensive Supervision: 

 ◦

Capital murder that carries the death penalty or life without parole, 

 ◦ Offenses described in Article 45A.054, Code Criminal Procedure,

 ◦ A reportable conviction or adjudication under Chapter 62, Code of Criminal Procedure. 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 508.146.

3.	 Re-Entry	National	Best	Practices

3.1	

Benefits	Enrollment:	

Health and  behavioral  health  benefit enrollment  sustain an  individual’s access  to  medications and  treatment 
that are critical to successful re-entry in the community. Enrollment can be facilitated by enrollment officers and 
case managers. Medicaid eligibility can be key to obtaining behavioral health services, and a number of states are 
receiving waivers related to providing increased eligibility to justice-involved individuals.255 

3.2	

Supported	Housing:	

Supported  housing  provides  a  key  layer  of  stability  for  mental  health  involved  individuals.  Individuals  may 
seek different housing types; from group housing (supervised and unsupervised) to rental housing and home 
ownership. Supportive housing is a middle ground option that features independent living with the potential for 
support and intervention as needed.256 

3.3 

Transitional Plan: 

Transitional plans offer guidance for community re-entry. A comprehensive plan identifies expectations, resources, 
and services to guide individuals towards independence.  Individuals should play an active role in creating their 
transition plan.257  

3.4 

Prescription Continuity: 

Prescription continuity ensures an individual can continue their medication and avoid adverse outcomes during 
transitional time periods. Continuity is also important as medications are necessary to maintain stability and/or 
competency and limit side effects or interruptions in dosages. Prescription continuity also eases re-entry hurdles 
and disruption.258 

3.5	

Community-Based	Treatment:	

Community-based treatment involves the broad spectrum of services and treatment an individual with mental 
and behavioral health needs may access. The goal is to connect individuals with the least restrictive setting in 
which  to  receive  treatment  services.  Treatment  offerings  may vary  by  providers  and  co-location  can  facilitate 
retention of treatment participation. In areas with few to no treatment providers, remote services and treatment 
may become an option.259  

3.6 

Educational/Employment Support: 

Educational and employment support further stabilizes individuals as they re-enter communities. Employment 
support might include resume guidance and interview guidance, coordination of skill classes, or coordinating 
transportation services to job sites. Educational support can vary greatly, from GED classes to ensuring appropriate 
accommodations. For this population, stakeholders should consider identification of volunteer opportunities as 
well as the more traditional employment paths.260

Co-Location	of	Services

Service co-location eases the burden of seeking and providing mental health treatment for detained individuals. 
Even for individuals released on their own recognizance, service co-location provides an answer to transportation 
and resource barriers that mental health-involved individuals often experience. Service co-location also increases 
the likelihood of participation and service retention rates, while reducing rates of failure to appear.261

Peers provide individualized support to those re-entering a community. Sharing unique experiences and challenges 
is helpful in navigating attendant challenges. Moreover, peer support groups provide insight to identify potential 
triggers and relapses.262 

3.8 

Peer Support 

3.9	

Re-entry	plans

Sometimes called Transition Plans, re-entry plans offer guidance for community reentry. A comprehensive plan 
identifies expectations, resources, and services to guide individuals towards independence.  Individuals should 
play an active role in creating their transition plan.263  

Legislative Change

H.B. 385, (87th Reg. Sess. (2021)), modified art. 42A.303(e) to allow the community supervision 
and  corrections  department  supervising  the  defendant  to  develop  a  continuum  of  care 
treatment plan when an individual is released from SAFPF (substance abuse felony punishment 
facilities) (see infra section 3.2.3 on SAFPF).

Probation

“Community supervision” means the placement of a defendant by a court under a continuum of programs and 
sanctions, with conditions imposed by the court for a specified period during which: (A) criminal proceedings 
are deferred without an adjudication of guilt; or (B) a sentence of imprisonment or confinement, imprisonment 
and fine, or confinement and fine, is probated and the imposition of sentence is suspended in whole or in part.264

1.1 

Legal Authority

Texas law allows courts to impose conditions of supervision specifically related to mental health on individuals 
sentenced  to  straight  probation  or  deferred  adjudication  probation.  Tex.  Code  Crim.  Proc.  art.  42A.001(1), 
42A.554(a), 42A.101(a), 42A.104(a).

The Code of Criminal Procedure specifically grants authority to judges to require certain offenders with mental 
illness to submit to outpatient or inpatient mental health treatment as a condition of community supervision 
stemming from probated or suspended sentences.265 

Legislative	Change

H.B. 757, (87th Reg. Sess. (2021)), creates an additional collateral consequence for individuals 
who received deferred adjudication community supervision for certain offenses and who also 
hold some sort of professional license. 

H.B. 757 amends Article 42A.111 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to allow licensing agencies 
to consider the fact that an individual received deferred adjudication community supervision in determining 
the  issuance,  renewal,  denial,  or  revocation  of  professional  license.  This  new  prescription  only  applies  to 
individuals  who  received  deferred  adjudication  for  an  offense  listed  in  Art.  42A.054(a)  (formerly  called  3G 
offenses) or Art. 62.001(5) or (6) or Chapter 21 or 43 of the Penal Code (offenses that are sexual in nature). 

H.B. 757 also gives licensing agencies the power to consider the fact that an individual has received deferred 
adjudication community supervision is the individual seeks a professional license that involves direct contact 
with children in the normal course of duties for which the license or certificate is required. This authority is 
not dependent on the adjudicated offense. 

These collateral consequences are important to note, as they may affect, individuals who have been granted 
deferred adjudication through completion of a mental health court program or veterans court program.

1.1.2	

Imposing	Specific	Conditions	of	Probation

Before a court may impose a mental health treatment condition as part of placing a defendant on community 
supervision, in general an appropriate mental health expert must have assessed the offender under Article 16.22 
or conducted a competency evaluation under Chapter 46B. 

The defendant must be competent before the court may exercise its discretion to grant community supervision 
and imposed mental health treatment conditions.

Moreover, the court must find either that the defendant’s mental illness is chronic in nature or that his or her 
ability to function independently will continue to deteriorate without proper treatment. 

Finally,  the statute  requires  the  judge  to  take steps  to ensure  that appropriate outpatient or  inpatient  mental 
health services are available either through a state facility or through another provider. 

In turn, § 534.053(c), Texas Health & Safety Code, requires the Health and Human Services Commission, to the 
extent that resources are available to “ensure that services listed in this section are available for defendants required 
to submit to mental health treatment under Article 17.032, 42A.104, or 42A.506, Code of Criminal Procedure.”266 
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 534.053(c).

The primary purpose behind CCP 42A.506 “is to divert many offenders with mental illness out of the criminal 
justice system and to place them in more appropriate treatment settings – particularly for nonviolent crimes. The 
legislative intent will be thwarted if courts decline to exercise the authority granted to them.”267

Article 42A.506 also grants the court flexibility to require either inpatient or outpatient treatment for the offender’s 
mental illness. Moreover, given that other sections of Chapter 42A authorize the court to modify the conditions 

placed on an offender’s community supervision, the court retains the flexibility to amend the provisions of the 
mental health treatment conditions.268

Legislative	Change

H.B.  385  (87th  Reg.  Sess.  (2021))  allows  a  judge  to  modify  the  conditions  of  community 
supervision for the added purpose of “prioritizing the conditions ordered by the court according 
to  the  defendant’s  progress  under  supervision.”  This  addition  allows  the  judge  to  effectively 
tailor the supervision conditions to the probationer. The probationer’s ability to pay must be 
taken into consideration, and the changes to art. 42A.655 give the judge added flexibility for 

handling situations where the defendant lacks sufficient resources or income. 

This bill also removed from CCP 42A.052 the possible supervision condition that would require a defendant 
to “avoid persons or places of disreputable or harmful character, including any person, other than a family 
member of the defendant, who is an active member of a criminal street gang.” Part of the legislative intent 
behind this modification was to allow probationers to attend AA or similar programs where other persons 
on probation might gather for a beneficial purpose.

Reflection	Point

As  a  judge,  identify  different  services  to  address  trauma  and  consider  using  them  as  an 
alternative to anger management classes.

The Relationship Between Anger and Trauma

“Anger is often a large part of a survivor’s response to trauma. It is a core piece of the survival response in human 
beings. Anger helps us cope with life’s stresses by giving us energy to keep going in the face of trouble or blocks. 
Yet anger can create major problems in the personal lives of those who have experienced trauma.”269

Parole

2.2 

Legal Authority

Section 508.221, Texas Government Code grants authority to parole panels to impose mental health treatment 
conditions in appropriate cases for offenders with mental illness who are being released on parole. It provides that 
“[a] parole panel may impose as a condition of parole or mandatory supervision any condition that a court may 
impose on a defendant placed on community supervision under Chapter 42A, Code of Criminal Procedure….” Tex. 
Gov’t Code § 508.221. Thus, giving the Board of Pardons and Parole the same authority as courts to impose mental 
health treatment conditions as part of parole as the courts do for community supervision.270 

3. 

Community Corrections

3.1	

Non-residential	Sentencing	Options

“A majority of offenders do not require the most restrictive sentencing options. In fact, the recidivism rate of low 
criminogenic risk and needs offenders can increase with unnecessary levels of programming and close supervision. 
A  number of  non-residential programs and supervision strategies can  be applied  in  the community, allowing 
an offender to maintain effective support mechanisms (such as family and employment) while addressing the 
offender’s risk to reoffend and criminogenic needs.”271

3.1.1	 Mental	Health	Criminal	Justice	Initiative	

“In  2001,  the Texas  Legislature enacted  the  Mental  Health/Criminal  Justice  Initiative  to provide courts with a 
sentencing alternative for offenders with mental health disorders. Offenders with mental health disorders are 
disproportionally represented in the criminal justice population and are twice as likely to have their community 
supervision revoked1. This initiative appropriated funding for both specialized probation officers and targeted 
treatment  for  mentally-impaired  offenders.  TDCJ-CJAD  and  the  Texas  Correctional  Office  on  Offenders  with 
Medical or Mental Impairments (TCOOMMI) developed a program model, based on best practices, that requires 
a specialized  CSO and a  mental  health provider  to work  together as a  team  to address  the  needs of  mentally 
impaired  offenders.  A  2005  study2  found  that  offenders  participating  in  this  initiative  had  lower  arrest  rates 
and  significantly  lower  incarceration  rates,  with  high-risk  offenders  having  the  most  significant  reduction  in 
recidivism.”272

3.1.2	 Post-adjudication	MH	Specialty	Court

Specialty courts focus on treating the underlying issues that may be causing criminal behavior. Mental health 
courts are a type of specialty court. They combine accountability through judicial supervision with treatment and 
other support services to prevent recidivism and improve the lives of their participants.

Mental Health Courts were discussed previously in Intercept 3, however they are mentioned here again to point 
out that some specialty courts occur post-adjudication as part of the condition of a defendant’s sentence. 

3.1.3	 Other	Non-residential	Programs

Beyond the programs discussed above, other non-residential programs offered through probation and parole, but 
not specifically mental health related, include:273

Residential	Sentencing	Options

“The decision to select a residential sentencing option should be based on the assessed risk and needs of the 
offender. A variety of local and state residential facilities can be used to address an offender’s criminogenic risk 
and needs. These facilities can also be used as an alternative intermediate sanction to county jail, state jail, or

“The  term  Community  Corrections  Facility  (CCF)  describes  a  residential  facility  operated  by  the  local  CSCD, 
either  directly  or  through  contracts  with  private  vendors.  CCFs  provide  a  secure  environment  and  treatment 
targeting specific types of offenders. These locally operated facilities allow the probationer to retain some ties 
to the community and remain under the supervision of the CSCD. Offenders may be placed in CCFs outside the 
original jurisdiction as long as space is available. The availability of treatment services discussed in this chapter 
varies by jurisdiction. Each local CSCD can provide detailed information on the programs available in their area.”275

“If a judge requires as a condition of community supervision or participation in a pretrial intervention program, 
or a [specialty] court program, that a defendant serve a term of confinement in a community corrections facility 
(CCF), the term may not exceed 24 months and the judge may not impose a subsequent term within the same 
supervision  period  that  would  make  the  total  time  exceed  36  months.  Tex.  Code  Crim.  Proc.  §  42A.602.  A 
defendant does not earn good conduct credit for time spent in a CCF or apply time spent in the facility toward 
completion of a prison sentence if the supervision is revoked. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. § 42A.603.”276

3.2.1a	 Court	Residential	Treatment	Centers	(CRTCs)	

CRTCs provide offenders with substance abuse  treatment and educational, vocational, and  life skills  training. 
Many CRTCs include employment during the final phase of the program. Some facilities also provide treatment 
and services for offenders with mental deficiencies or emotional/family problems. 

3.2.1b	 Substance	Abuse	Treatment	Facilities	(SATFs)

SATFs are designed specifically to provide cognitive-based substance abuse treatment. SATFs may also include 
educational,  life  skills,  and  supportive  12-Step  orientation  or  modified  therapeutic  community  treatment 
programs.

3.2.1c	 Intermediate	Sanction	Facilities	(ISFs)

CSCD-operated ISFs are used as intermediate sanctions for supervision violators in an effort to give the courts 
an incapacitation custody option other than revocation or incarceration. Programming provided in ISFs usually 
includes a substance abuse component, education, and cognitive and life skills programs; some CSCD-operated 
ISFs have an employment component. These programs should not be confused with the state-contracted ISFs 
mentioned below.

3.2.1d	 Dually	Diagnosed	Residential	Facilities	(DDRFs)

DDRFs provide the courts with a sentencing alternative for offenders with demonstrated/documented mental 
health  issues.  Most  of  these  programs  address  offenders  with  co-occurring  disorders  of  mental  health  and 
substance abuse. Programming in the DDRF includes a broad range of mental health, substance abuse, and life 
skills services for offenders with mental impairments in a residential setting.

3.2.2	 State-Contracted	ISFs

“State-contracted  ISFs  (SC-ISFs)  are  secure  lockdown  facilities  that  completely  remove  the  offender  from  the 
community  and  provide  either  substance  abuse  treatment  or  cognitive  treatment  to  medium-  or  high-risk 
felony  offenders.  The  Texas  Department  of  Criminal  Justice  (TDCJ)  operates  these  facilities  as  an  alternative 
to  incarceration  for  medium- and  high-risk  felony  probationers  in violation of  the conditions of supervision, 
sanctioned at sentencing based on the nature of the offense or criminal history. These SC-ISF beds are available 
statewide to all CSCDs. The contractors operating the SC-ISF provide transportation service to and from the SC-
ISF.”277

The Intermediate Sanction Facility (ISF) program is presented in a 45-day format for those needing Cognitive 
Behavioral Treatment and a 90-day format for those needing a brief substance use treatment program. Clients 
enter the program referred by a Parole Officer as an alternative to being violated.278

3.2.3	 Substance	Abuse	Felony	Punishment	Facility	-	SAFPF

“SAFPFs  provide  intensive  substance  abuse  treatment  in  a  secure  setting  for  felony  offenders  (other  than  sex 
offenders) assessed as having severe substance dependence. The ideal offender for this program is one who has 
several arrests or a history of incarceration and whose circumstances are compounded by an unhealthy family 
environment and unemployment. Often, this option is applied as a direct sentence, condition, or modification 
of probation. SAFPFs are operated by TDCJ and are available to CSCDs when other, less intensive programs have 
been unsuccessful for offenders with substance abuse related issues. A number of options are available for SAFPF 
graduates who relapse. Contact the TDCJ-CJAD SAFPF Unit for more information.

It is the mission of the Substance Use Treatment Program to provide evidence-based substance use treatment 
services appropriate to the needs of individual offenders to facilitate positive change; and to provide accountability 
for  programming  utilizing  assessment  tools  developed  specifically  for  this  population,  all  of  which  leads  to 
reducing recidivism and improving public safety.279

3.2.3a	 Program	Overview:

The Substance Abuse Felony Punishment Facility (SAFPF) / In-Prison Therapeutic Community (IPTC) provide 
services  to  qualified  offenders  identified  as  needing  substance  use  treatment.  Both  are  six-month  in-prison 
treatment programs followed by up to three months of residential aftercare in a transitional treatment center* 
(TTC), six to nine months of outpatient aftercare and up to 12 months of support groups and follow-up supervision. 
A nine-month in-facility program is provided for special needs offenders who have a mental health and/or medical 
needs, as qualified. Offenders are sentenced to a SAFPF by a judge as a condition of community supervision in lieu 
of prison/state jail, or voted in by the Board of Pardons and Parole (BPP) BPP as a modification of parole.

The Pre-Release Substance Abuse Program (PRSAP) is a six-month program addressing substance use disorders 
and  behavior  based  on  the  principals  of  a  therapeutic  community.  The  program  is  intended  for  incarcerated 
offenders with substance use disorders and criminal ideology issues. Offenders are placed in the program based 
on vote by the BPP.

The Pre-Release Therapeutic Community (PRTC) is a program consisting of two tracks: The first, is a three (3) 
month track focusing on cognitive behavioral model to address issues of criminality. This track seeks to reach a 
population of offenders in need of a more concentrated track to address behavioral change through structured 
activities, complimented by support services upon release. Peer Recovery Support Specialists assist the clients 
with preparing their re-entry plans. The second, is a six-month program addressing all substance use disorders. 
This track follows the evidence-based practice modality of Solution-Focused Treatment. There is added emphasis 
given  to  address  particular  drugs  of  choice  of  the  clients.  Peer  Recovery  Support  Specialists  assist  the  clients 
with additional help and contacts with agencies that may be needed by the client for successful re-integration. 
Offenders are placed in the PRTC program based on vote by the BPP and their substance use assessment score.280
