      <pre>CASH REPORT 
and ACFR

The Comptroller’s office is the chief steward of the state’s finances and has five primary roles — chief tax collector, 
accountant, revenue estimator, treasurer and purchasing manager for all of state government. As chief accountant for the 
state, duties include keeping the state’s books and producing the state’s financial reports. 

Comptroller’s office

This brief

This fiscal brief focuses on two annual financial reports the Comptroller’s office produces 
for the state:

KEY FACTS

• State of Texas Annual Cash Report
• State of Texas Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR)

State of Texas Annual Cash Report

Issued the first Monday in November, the State of Texas Annual Cash Report (Cash Report) 
presents cash-basis information on revenues, expenditures and balances through 
the end of a given fiscal year for funds held inside the state’s treasury, as required by 
Texas Government Code, Section 403.013. Funds held outside the state’s treasury are not 
presented in the report.

The Cash Report:
 ❖ Presents cash-basis 
information on 
revenues, expenditures 
and balances through 
the end of a given fiscal 
year for funds held in 
the state’s treasury.
 ❖ Is published annually 
on the first Monday 
in November.

The ACFR:
 ❖ Presents a 

comprehensive picture 
of the state’s financial 
condition by combining 
the annual financial 
reports of all Texas 
state agencies and 
universities.

 ❖ Is published annually 
on the last day of 
February.

What’s in the Cash Report?
The Cash Report contains revenue and expenditure 
details for all funds maintained in the state’s treasury:

• Revenues are reported in the period when 

cash is collected.

• Expenditures are reported in the period 

when cash disbursements are made.

Details for each fund appearing in the Cash Report 
include:

• Date of origin.
• Administering agency.
• Authorizing statute.
• Revenues at the detailed object code level.
• Expenditures at the summary category level.

Financial information in the Cash Report’s tables comes from the Uniform Statewide Accounting System (USAS), 
one of the statewide financial systems maintained by the Comptroller’s Fiscal Management Division.

Get a good read on the Cash Report
Before getting into the table-based financial information that makes up a good part of the Cash Report, report readers 
can get some excellent insight on the current state of the Texas economy with these sections:

  Review of the Texas Economy  Topics ranging from consumer spending to economic performance by industry.

 The State’s Financial Condition  Details on fund balances, revenue by source, federal revenue, expenditure 
summaries and other informative data.

Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts — March 2023State of Texas Annual Comprehensive Financial Report

As required by state statute, the Comptroller’s office must:

• Provide instructions that include uniform accounting and reporting procedures to all state agencies and institutions 
of higher education to enable them to complete the annual financial report or AFR (Texas Government Code, 
Section 2101.011-012).

• Issue to the governor on the last day of February each year, a statewide financial report prepared in accordance 

with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP (Texas Government Code, Section 403.013).

This statewide financial report is known as the State of Texas Annual Comprehensive Financial Report or 
ACFR and presents a comprehensive picture of the state’s financial condition by combining the annual financial 
reports of all Texas state agencies and universities.

The ACFR is designed to:

• Provide the state’s citizens, taxpayers, customers, investors and creditors with a general overview of the state’s finances.

• Demonstrate the state’s accountability for the money it receives.

Unlike a budget that provides a plan for a future fiscal period, a ACFR contains the actual results of the prior 
fiscal year’s financial activities (revenue, expenditures, changes in fund balances, liabilities, etc.).

What’s in the ACFR?
The state’s ACFR is divided into three main sections:
  Introductory  Orients and guides readers through the report.

 

 

auditor’s report.

inancial  Presents the basic financial statements as well as notes to the statements and the independent 
F

Statistical  Provides additional financial and statistical data, including data on financial trends that may better 

inform the reader about the government’s activities.

Our ACFR reports on all activities considered part of the primary government of the state of Texas and what 
Texans generally equate with government services.

These activities are mostly funded by taxes, fees and federal grants and provide a 
range of services in several key areas:

•  Education
•  Health and human services
•  Public safety and corrections
•  Transportation
•  Natural resources and recreation
•  Regulation
•  General government
•  Employee benefits
•  Teacher retirement state contributions

Get a Good Read on the ACFR
Though the ACFR is full of statistical and financial tables, it also includes several narrative sections that provide 
easy-to-read information on the state’s finances and economy.

The Introductory section: 
 – Describes the report.
 – Provides highlights on issues affecting the Texas economy including those addressed by the Legislature.
 – Features a chart on the state government structure of Texas.

Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts Cash Report and ACFR— Page 2The Financial section’s Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A): 

 – Describes the previous year’s financial results and key factors influencing them.

 – Shows the state’s current financial condition.

 – Provides an overview of likely future economic prospects.

Notes to the Financial Statements:

 – Gives a clear picture of the state’s overall financial position when used with the basic financial 

statements.

The ACFR, GASB and GAAP

That Texas is among a group of states required by law to issue an annual comprehensive financial report is a 
good thing for Texans because it represents a best practice in government finance. 

For example, the ACFR includes additional financial and statistical information that conforms to standards 
set by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB).

The GASB is a private, non-governmental organization and the source of Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles (GAAP) used by state and local governments in the United States. The GASB has issued Statements, 
Interpretations, Technical Bulletins and Concept Statements defining GAAP for state and local governments 
since 1984.

The GASB’s mission as reflected in the preparation and presentation of the ACFR is to: 

• Establish and improve standards of state and local governmental accounting and financial reporting 

that result in useful information for users of financial reports.

• Guide and educate the public including issuers, auditors and users of financial reports.

Because all ACFRS are compiled in accordance with GAAP, that makes them comparable. So you can compare 
California’s ACFR to Texas’ ACFR to Florida’s ACFR to see how the states are the same or different and do so on 
an apples-to-apples basis.

The ACFR and the GFOA

When preparing the ACFR, the state also:

• Voluntarily follows the recommendations of the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) of 

the United States and Canada for the contents of government financial reports.

• Participates in the GFOA’s review program for the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial 

Reporting.

ACFR independent audit and GFOA Certificate of Achievement

To be eligible for the GFOA’s certification, the ACFR undergoes another financial reporting best practice 
— an independent audit report on the ACFR’s basic financial statements carried out by the Texas State 
Auditor’s Office (SAO).

Texas is doing it right. The state’s ACFR has received GFOA’s Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in 
Financial Reporting every year since 1990 — the year the state of Texas began publishing the ACFR on an 
audited GAAP basis.

Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts Cash Report and ACFR— Page 3Cash Report vs ACFR

These reports work side-by-side to provide a powerhouse of Texas state financial information. Each offers a unique 
perspective on the state’s finances which, taken together, cover a lot of ground.

The major differences between Texas’ Cash Report and ACFR are:

1.  The Cash Report only includes revenues, expenditures and balances for funds held in 
the state’s treasury. Balances for funds held outside the treasury are not included with 
the exception of petty cash, investments and Fund 0938 — Unemployment Trust Fund 
Account (in the federal treasury).
The ACFR presents information on all state funds, including those held 
outside the state’s treasury such as local funds.

2. The Cash Report reports on a cash basis, presenting information for cash 

receipts and disbursements during the reporting period.
The ACFR presents information on an accrual basis, recognizing amounts 
owed by the state but not paid at the end of the fiscal year, as well as 
amounts due to the state but not received by the end of the fiscal year.

3. The Cash Report is a unique report to the state of Texas and generally 

not comparable to any other state publication.
Our ACFR’s basic financial statements are comparable to those of other 
states because state ACFRs are compiled in accordance with GAAP.

4. The Cash Report does not show information on real property and other capital assets, long-term obligations 

or investments held outside the state’s treasury.
The ACFR includes these and other items relating to the net worth of the state.

5. The Cash Report includes a review of the Texas economy.

The ACFR has more robust statistical and economic data than the Cash Report, including jobs, population and 
income data.
