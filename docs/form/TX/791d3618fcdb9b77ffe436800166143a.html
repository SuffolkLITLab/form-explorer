PROCESS AFTER YOU COMPLETE THE PETITION 

If you are eligible for an order of nondisclosure under Section 411.0725, the process for 
obtaining an order under the section is as follows: 

irst, be sure to wait the requisite time, if any, before filing the petition, and check with 
the court clerk to obtain the total amount that you will have to pay when you file the 
petition, unless you are submitting a Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court 
Costs. Next, be sure to complete the correct petition according to the instructions, and 
after  you  have  done  so,  print  both  the  petition  and  the  proposed  Order  of 
Nondisclosure.  In  most  courts,  you  will  have  to  submit  a  proposed  order  with  your 
petition when you file it. The judge will complete the order if the judge grants your 
request. 
 

You must file the petition in the court that placed you on deferred adjudication. 
 
After you file the petition, the clerk will send it to the court, and the court will notify 
the prosecutor.  

 hearing is required only if the prosecutor requests one. 

f a hearing is scheduled, the court will notify you. If there is a hearing, the court may 
ask questions regarding your eligibility to receive the order. After the hearing, if the 
court finds that you have satisfied the requirements of the statutes (Government Code 
Sections  411.0725  and  411.074)  and  issuance  of  the  order  is  in  the  best  interest  of 
justice, the court will grant your request for the order. 

f the court does not hold a hearing, the court will review your petition to determine

whether an order of nondisclosure shall issue. The court must find that you satisfy the 
requirements of Sections 411.0725 and 411.074 and issuance of the order is in the best 
interest of justice before the court may grant your request. 

he court will have access to your criminal history record information and will use it to 
determine your eligibility for the order. 

f the court grants the order, the clerk will send a copy of the order to DPS no later than 
15  business  days  after  the  order  issues.  Upon  receiving  the  order,  DPS  will  have  10 
business days to seal, not delete, the criminal history record information that is subject 
to the order and forward a copy of the order to the state and federal agencies listed in 
Government  Code  Section  411.075(b).  It  is  important  for  you  to  know  that  some 
agencies, including law enforcement agencies, will still have access to the information, 
although the information is sealed. You will find a list of such agencies at Government 
Code Section 411.0765.
