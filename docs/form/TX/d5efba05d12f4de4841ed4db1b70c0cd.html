APPEAL NO.:

The Honorable K. Michael Mayes  
Judge, 410th Judicial District 

August 23, 2011 

PECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge  Stephen  B.  Ables,  Chairman;  Judge  John  Ovard,  Judge 
David Peeples, Judge Kelly G. Moore, Judge Jeff Walker 

Petitioner requested the following records from Respondent: 

1.  “Copy of cellular phone records or billing detail listing incoming and 

outgoing calls by date and time for the days May 10, 2010 through May 14, 
2010 inclusive, for the cellular phone assigned to Honorable Judge K. 
Michael Mayes.” 

2.  “Copy  of any and all calendars and or schedules used by the court or other 
record, calendar and or schedules used by court personnel in written or 
electronic form used or maintained by the 410th District Court and or its 
personnel and or presiding judge for the month of May 2010.” 

.  “Any and all records of the court or of court personnel of any kind that 

reveal the whereabouts of Honorable Judge K. Michael Mayes for the days 
of May 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2010.” 

.  “Copy of any and all email communications between Honorable Judge K. 
Michael Mayes and any person that discusses vacation plans of any person 
in the 410th District Court for the month of May 2010.”

espondent informed Petitioner that his request did not comply with Rule 12 because it 
was emailed to the court’s coordinator rather than the judge who is the custodian of the court’s 
records.  Respondent also informed Petitioner that if the request were considered appropriate, it 
was overly broad and vague, failed to reasonably identify the requested records and constituted a 
clearly unwarranted invasion of confidential matters and personal privacy and invaded the 
personal and private interests of the entire court’s staff, their families and friends.  Respondent 
also claimed that the request included matters that are not judicial records and that the request 
was for records that are exempt under Rule 12.5(a) (work product and drafts), 12.5(c) (personnel 
information), 12.5(d) (home address), 12.5(f) (internal deliberations), 12.5(h) (calendar

information), 12.5(i) (confidential under other law), 12.5(i)(1) (information related to a 
complaint filed against a judicial officer) and 12.5(i)(3) (trade secret or commercial or financial 
information).  Petitioner then filed this appeal. 

At the outset, we address whether Petitioner’s request fails to comply with the Rule 12 

requirement that a “request must be sent to the records custodian and not to a court clerk or other 
agent for the records custodian.”  See Rule 12.6(a).  Petitioner’s letter is addressed to Judge 
Mayes, the judge of the 410th Judicial District Court, but was emailed to the judge’s court 
coordinator.  It is evident from the letter’s heading that Petitioner intended to direct his request to 
the judge; it appears that the coordinator’s email address was merely used as a vehicle to deliver 
the letter to the judge’s office.  In this case, the court’s coordinator, who is a member of the 
court’s staff, forwarded the request to the judge of the court.  Because Rule 12 is to be liberally 
construed to achieve its purpose and this request was delivered to the office of the records 
custodian and the custodian actually received the request, we conclude that the request should be 
treated as a valid Rule 12 request. 

   

ext, we address the contentions raised by Respondent.  The first item of the request is 
for billing information that lists incoming and outgoing calls by date and time for a specific time 
period  for  a  cellular  phone  assigned  to  Judge  K.  Michael  Mayes.    Respondent  alleges  that  the 
entire request is overly broad and vague, fails to reasonably identify the requested records and is 
an invasion of privacy and that the bill is an administrative record that is not subject to Rule 12.  
Petitioner specifically lists the telephone bill he is requesting, the information he requires and the 
time period for the record. We do not find this request to be vague or ambiguous or that it fails to 
reasonably identify the requested records. Bills for cellular phone service used by court staff and 
paid for, in whole or in part, with public funds are records that are maintained for the court in its 
regular course of business.  Because they do not pertain to the court’s adjudicative function they 
are judicial records  that  are subject  to  Rule 12.   See  Rule 12.2(d).   If Judge Mayes uses  a cell 
phone that is paid for, in whole or in part, with public funds, the bills for that phone are judicial 
records that are  available to the public subject to Rule 12.5 exemptions.  Accordingly, we will 
address the Rule 12.5 exemptions to disclosure of the phone records raised by Respondent. 

elephone bills do not relate to a judicial officer’s adjudicative decision-making process, 
they are not personnel information, they do not constitute internal deliberations of a court, nor do 
they contain calendar information.  Thus, they are not exempt under Rules 12.5(a), (c), (f) and 
(h).  Respondent alleges that these records are also exempt under Rule 12.5(i) (confidential under 
other  law),  12.5(i)(1)  (information  related  to  a  complaint  filed  against  a  judicial  officer)  and 
12.5(i)(3)  (trade  secret  or  commercial  or  financial  information).    We  are  not  aware  of  and 
Respondent  has  not  provided  any  authority  that  makes  phone  bills,  telephone  numbers,  or  the 
names of individuals confidential.  Also, we are unable to determine how a list of telephone calls 
relates to a complaint alleging misconduct against a judicial officer or how it is a trade secret or 
commercial  or  financial  information.    Thus,  they  are  not  exempt  under  Rule  12.5(i),  (i)(1)  or 
(i)(3).  Some of the phone numbers and names on the phone bill may reflect a person’s home or 
personal  telephone number or family members’  names.  This  information is  confidential  under 
Rule  12.5(d)  and  may  be  withheld.    However,  a  record  is  not  exempt  in  its  entirety  because 
portions of it are exempt from disclosure.  The proper response is to redact exempt entries from 
the record before providing a copy to the requestor.  See Rule 12.6(d).

etitioner  also  requested  copies  of  calendars  or  schedules  used  by  the  court  or  other 
record, calendar or schedules used by court personnel in written or electronic form for the month 
of May.  Respondent raised the same exemptions and arguments for this item as he did for the 
phone bills.  We have previously held that calendars  that are made for the purpose of assisting 
the court in scheduling court hearings and other office duties are judicial records under Rule 12 
and are available to the public subject to Rule 12.5 exemptions.  See Rule 12 Decision 10-011.  
The  judicial  calendar  exemption,  Rule  12.5(h),  is  not  a  blanket  exemption;  it  only  exempts 
records that “reflect a judicial officer’s appointments or engagements that are in the future or that 
constitute  an  invasion  of  personal  privacy.”    Respondent  did  not  provide  calendar  samples  for 
our review; therefore, we are unable to determine whether any of the entries are exempt under 
this provision.  Also, the request is not for appointments or engagements that are in the future.  
The other exemptions raised by Respondent do not appear to apply either.  A calendar used for 
the  general  purpose  of  maintaining  a  schedule  is  not  part  of  a  judicial  officer’s  adjudicative 
decision-making  process,  it  is  not  personnel  information  and  it  does  not  constitute  the  internal 
deliberations of a court.  Thus, Rule 12.5(a), (c) and (f) do not apply.  We are not aware of any 
authority  that  makes  calendars  confidential  by  law;  therefore,  Rule  12.5(i)  does  not  apply.  
Respondent did not explain how the requested calendar might be related to a complaint alleging 
misconduct against a judicial officer, or how it might be considered a trade secret or financial or 
commercial information.  Therefore, Rules 12.5(i)(1) and (i)(3) do not apply either.  It is possible 
that there may be entries in a calendar that may  be exempt under Rule 12.5(d) (Home Address 
and Family Information), but as stated above, this does not make the entire record exempt.  The 
proper  response  is  to  redact  exempt  entries  from  the  record  before  providing  a  copy  to  the 
requestor.  See Rule 12.6(d). 

he  third  request  is  for  any  records  of  the  court  or  court  personnel  of  any  kind  that 
“reveal the whereabouts” of the Honorable Judge K. Michael Mayes for the days of May 10, 11, 
12,  13  and  14,  2010.    Respondent  raised  the  same  exemptions  for  this  item  as  for  the  other 
requested items and claimed that it is overly broad and vague and fails to reasonably identify the 
records requested.  We interpret the request to be for a record that indicates where Judge Mayes 
was  if  he  was  not  in  the  office.    A  record  with  information  related  to  a  judge’s  personal 
appointments or schedule when he is not in the office or on the bench is not a record that is made 
or maintained in the regular course of a court’s business and is not subject to Rule 12.  Thus, we 
are without authority to  grant this portion of the appeal or sustain the denial of access to these 
records.   

he  last  request  is  for  a  copy  of  email  communications  between  Judge  Mayes  and  any 
person that discusses vacation plans of any person in  the 410th District Court for the month of 
May 2010.  Respondent raised the same objections and exemptions to this request as he did for 
the other items.  We construe Petitioner’s request for “vacation plans” to be a request for records 
that indicate “vacation taken.”  A record that documents vacation leave or a request for approval 
to  take leave pertains  to a court’s or judicial  agency’s administrative  function and is  a judicial 
record  that  is  subject  to  Rule  12.      However,  like  information  related  to  a  judge’s  personal 
appointments discussed in the paragraph above, a record that discusses personal vacation plans is 
not  a  record  that  is  made  or  maintained  for  a  court  or  judicial  agency  in  its  regular  course  of 
business and is not subject to Rule 12.  

  P

  T

ccordingly we grant the petition in part.  We are confident that the court will review its 
records  and  revise  its  response  so  that  it  is  consistent  with  the  analysis  we  have  provided. 
Records that discuss a judge’s personal appointments or where a judge or his staff vacation are 
not  judicial  records  that  are  subject  to  Rule  12;  accordingly  we  are  without  authority  to  grant 
Petitioner’s appeal regarding these records or sustain the denial of access to them.
