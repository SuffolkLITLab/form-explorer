First, be sure to wait the requisite time before filing the petition (It could be two years 
following completion of your sentence), and check with the court clerk to obtain the total 
amount due upon filing the petition, unless you are submitting a Statement of Inability 
to  Afford  Payment  of  Court  Costs.  Next,  be  sure  to  complete  the  correct  petition 
according to the instructions above, and after you have done so, print both the petition 
and the proposed Order of Nondisclosure. In most courts, you must submit a proposed 
order when you file your petition. The court will complete the order, if the court grants 
your request.   

ou must file the petition in the court that sentenced you. 

fter you file the petition, the clerk will send it to the court, and the court will notify the 

prosecutor.   

 hearing is required if the prosecutor requests one.  

f a hearing is scheduled, the court will notify you. If there is a hearing, the court may ask 
questions regarding your eligibility to receive the order. After the hearing, if the court 
finds  that  you  have  satisfied  the  requirements  of  the  statutes  (Government  Code 
Sections  411.0735  and  411.074)  and  issuance  of  the  order  is  in  the  best  interest  of 
justice, the court will grant your request for the order.  

f the court does not hold a hearing, the judge will review your petition to determine 
whether an order of nondisclosure shall issue. The court must find that you have satisfied 
the requirements of Sections 411.0735 and 411.074 and issuance of the order is in the 
best interest of justice before the court can grant your request.    

he court will have access to your criminal history record and will use it to determine 
your eligibility for the order.    

f the court grants the order, the clerk will send a copy of the order to DPS no later than 
15  business  days  after  the  order  issues.  Upon  receiving  the  order,  DPS  will  have  10 
business days to seal, not delete, the criminal history record information that is subject 
to the order and forward a copy of the order to the state and federal agencies listed in 
Government  Code  Section  411.075(b).  It  is  important  to  note  that  some  agencies, 
including law enforcement agencies, will still have access to the information, although the 
information is sealed. You will find a list of such agencies at Government Code Section 
411.0765.
