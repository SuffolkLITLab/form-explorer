Senate Bill 6 - The Damon Allen Act

In  September  2021,  during 
the  Second  Called 
Special  Session  of  the  87th  Legislature,  Senate  Bill 
6, also known as the Damon Allen Act, was enacted. 
The  Damon  Allen  Act  established  procedures  for 
setting  bail  and  the  reporting  of  bail  information,  set 
certification and reporting requirements for charitable 
bail  organizations,  amended  procedures  regarding 
cash  bail  bonds,  and  specified  additional  training 
requirements for all magistrates.

The bill also required the Office of Court Administration 
(OCA)  to  implement  a  standardized  public  safety 
report system for statewide use no later than April 1, 
2022, and to provide access to the system, at no cost, 
to  the  appropriate  officials  in  each  county  and  each 
municipality  that  perform  magistrations.  Magistrates 
who  set  bail  are  required  to  consider  the  public 
safety  report  for  defendants  charged  with  Class  B 
misdemeanor or higher categories of offenses.

The  project  consisted  of  developing  the  statewide 
Public  Safety  Report  System  (PSRS)  which  met  the 
requirements of Senate Bill 6, implementing the PSRS 
in  all  local  magistrate  offices  throughout  the  State, 
and  providing  training  for  all  statewide  users  in  the 
use  of  the  PSRS.  OCA  contracted  with  a  software 
company  based  out  of  Scottsdale,  Arizona  called 
AutoMon  (now  called  Catalis)  to  develop  the  PSRS. 
AutoMon’s  primary  software  products  were  focused 
on community corrections, pretrial and specialty court 
company,  so  they  came  into  the  project  with  a  fair 
amount  of  industry  knowledge  and  experience.  After 
executing  a  contract  on  November  11,  2021,  two 
Project Managers and multiple Subject Matter Experts 
began to collaborate with OCA staff for months in the 
development of the project. Additional staff were hired 
to further implement and support the project.

The Public Safety Report System began operation April 
1,  2022,  as  required  by  law.  As  of  August  31,    2022, 
there were 5,718 active users and 228 counties have 
completed  magistrations  in  the  system.  A  total  of 
215,836 bail forms have been completed from April 1 
through August 31, 2022.

2 - Bail Proceedings and Public Safety Report System

PSRS Data from April to August 2022

Government Code Section 71.0351(a)(1)(A-C) requires the clerk of each court setting bail in criminal cases 
to report in their Judicial Council Monthly Court Activity Reports the number of defendants for each category 
of offense, the number of personal bonds, and the number of surety or cash bonds. This information was 
instead  captured  from  the  Bail  Form  information  submitted  through  OCA’s  Public  Safety  Report  System 
established by Article 17.021, Code of Criminal Procedure.

Bail  forms  are  completed  by  individuals  and  could  have  more  than  one  offense  per  form.  One  individual 
could have multiple bail forms for multiple arrests or modifications made from the original bail form that was 
completed after initial arrest.

BAIL TYPES

Currently,  the  bond  amounts  reported  are  static  and  do  not  reflect  changes  in  the  amount  (increases  or 
reductions). The system is currently capturing all bonds assigned, therefore, if the bond amount was modified 
after the initial arrest, a modified bail form would reflect the new amount. For fiscal year 2022 we are not 
able to differentiate between the original and the modified bond amounts or bail types. OCA is currently 
working with Automon to differentiate the bond types, bond amounts, and the changes for future analyses.

Court Activity Reporting and Directory System
Data from April – August 2022

Section  71.0351(a)(2-3)  requires  the  reporting  of  the  number  of  defendants  released  on  bail  who  have 
subsequently  failed  to  appear,  violated  a  condition  of  release,  and  who  committed  an  offense  while 
released  on  bail  or  community  supervision.  This  information  is  being  captured  in  the  District  and  County 
Criminal  section  of  the  Judicial  Council  Monthly  Court  Activity  Reports.  Data  is  captured  by  case  counts, 
not defendants, given that court case management systems and the Judicial Council Monthly Court Activity 
Reports are designed to track cases.

Judicial Education

Judicial  officers  who  set  bail  for  defendants  charged  with  Class  B  misdemeanors  or  higher  offenses  are 
required  to  complete  eight  hours  of  judicial  education  on  the  duties  of  magistrates  and  setting  bail.  The 
judicial  education  is  being  provided  through  the  Texas  Center  for  the  Judiciary,  Texas  Municipal  Court 
Education Center, Texas Justice Court Training Center, and Texas Association of Counties.

Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) Required Training

Users of the PSRS who have access to criminal histories are required to complete training based on their 
type  of  access.  Any  PSRS  users  with  access  to  Criminal  Justice  Information  (CJI)  (including  Texas  Crime 
Information Center [TCIC] and National Crime Information Center [NCIC]) through Texas Law Enforcement 
Telecommunications  System  (TLETS)  must  take  the  CJIS  Security  Awareness  Training.  Training  shall  be 
taken within six months and biennially thereafter. Individuals who only access hard or electronic copies of 
TCIC and NCIC responses, and do not query for criminal history information themselves, must obtain and 
maintain  a  Criminal  Justice  Practitioner  (CJP)  certification.  Individuals  who  can  query  TCIC  and  NCIC  for 
criminal history information must complete at least the 8-hour TLETS Mobile Access Certification Course.

Charitable Bail Organizations

Per Senate Bill 6, charitable bail organizations must submit a report to the sheriff of a county in which the 
organization paid a bail bond for a defendant. This report must be submitted by the 10th of each month. The 
sheriff then should provide a copy of the report to the OCA.

Bexar, Harris, Hays, and Travis counties have provided charitable bail reports to OCA this year. One non-profit 
organization, The Bail Project, is responsible for all the bails reported in Harris, Hays, and Travis counties. 
Texas Organizing Project is responsible for the bails reported in Bexar County. The total defendants reported 
bailed out for the four counties is represented in the chart below:

Required Forms

Senate  Bill  6  required  OCA  to  develop  statewide 
procedures  and  forms  to  be  used  by  courts  to 
facilitate the refund of funds paid toward monetary 
bonds and/ or application of the cash funds towards 
the  defendant’s  outstanding  court  costs  and  other 
fees. These forms are available on the OCA website 
for courts and clerks to access.

Upcoming Enhancements to the PSRS

OCA and AutoMon continue to plan and implement 
enhancements  to  the  PSRS.  AutoMon  is  currently 
in  the  testing  and  implementation  phase  of  an 
Application  Programming 
Interface  (API)  which 
allows courts to electronically send information from 
their case management systems to the PSRS which 
will dramatically reduce their workload of having to 
input  the  same  information  in  both  systems,  thus 
freeing-up personnel resources. Other enhancements 
include a method of bail modification, the ability to 
enter separate bail amounts for multiple offenses on 
the same arrest, and various reports as requested by 
the users. Upcoming plans include an upgrade to the 
OCA website where publicly accessible information 
on the PSRS is posted, including a data dashboard 
of the bail form reporting.

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
