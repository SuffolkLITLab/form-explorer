BACKGROUND AND LEGAL STANDARDS – PUBLIC RIGHT TO ACCESS TO 
REMOTE HEARINGS DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC1 

On  March  13,  2020,  the  Supreme  Court  of  Texas  and  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  issued  the  First 
Emergency Order Regarding the COVID-19 State of Disaster and authorized all courts in Texas in any 
case – civil or criminal – without a participant’s consent to: 1) conduct any hearing or court proceeding 
remotely through teleconferencing, videoconferencing, or other means; and 2) conduct proceedings 
away from the court’s usual location with reasonable notice and access to the participants and the 
public.2 This emergency order’s recognition of the public’s right to reasonable notice and access to 
court proceedings, both civil and criminal, is consistent with traditional practice in Texas state courts 
and with federal and state precedent as discussed below. 

The 6th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States affords defendants the right to a public 
trial, including all phases of criminal cases. Texas extends that right through the 14th Amendment to 
juvenile justice cases brought under Chapter 54 of the Texas Family Code.3 

The Supreme Court has also held that the press and public have a similar, independent right under the 
1st  Amendment  to  attend  all  criminal  proceedings  in  both  federal  and  state  courts.4  Although  the 
Supreme Court has never specifically held that the public has a First Amendment right of access to 
civil proceedings,5 federal and state courts that have considered the issue have overwhelmingly held 

 

1 The Office of Court Administration wishes to thank District Judge Roy Ferguson (394th) for primary authorship on 
this document. 
2 The Third Emergency Order Regarding  the COVID-19  State of Disaster amended the First Emergency Order to 
remove the requirement that the court conduct the proceedings in the count of venue. 
3 Texas courts have recognized the juvenile’s right to public proceedings in quasi-criminal juvenile justice cases under 
the 14th Amendment and Section 54.08 of the Texas Family Code. Article 1, Section 13 of the Texas Constitution 
states that “All courts shall be open, and every person for an injury done him in his lands, goods, person or reputation 
shall have remedy by due course of law.” Courts construing this provision interpret it to prohibit the erection of barriers 
to the redress of grievances in the court system. So, the phrase “open courts” in Section 13 does not appear to mean 
“public trial.” 
4 Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555 (1980) (establishing that the 1st Amendment to the United 
States Constitution guarantees the public a right of access to judicial proceedings). 
5 Although the holding is specific to the criminal case, the constitutional analysis in Richmond Newspapers applies 
similarly to civil cases. As Chief Justice Burger in the majority opinion opined, “What this means in the context of 
trials is that the First Amendment guarantees of speech and press, standing alone, prohibit government from summarily 
closing courtroom doors which had long been open to the public at the time that Amendment was adopted.” Id. at 576. 
In his concurrence, Justice Stevens wrote, “[T[he First Amendment protects the public and the press from abridgment 
of their rights of access to information about the operation of their government, including the judicial branch[.]” Justice 
Brennan added, “Even more significantly for our present purpose, […] open trials are bulwarks of our free and 
democratic government: public access to court proceedings is one of the numerous ‘checks and balances’ of our 
system, because ‘contemporaneous review in the forum of public opinion is an effective restraint on possible 
abuse of judicial power[.]’” Id. And Justice Stewart specifically addressed the issue of civil cases, saying, “the 
First and Fourteenth Amendments clearly give the press and the public a right of access to trials themselves, 
civil as well as criminal.” Id. at 599. 
 
 
 

 

 

right 

there 

to  access 

is  a  public 

in  civil  cases  under 

 
the  1st  Amendment.6  
that 
Courts  must  ensure  and  accommodate  public  attendance  at  court  hearings.7  However,  although 
constitutional in nature and origin, the right to public and open hearings is not absolute, and may be 
outweighed by other competing rights or interests, such as interests in security, preventing disclosure 
of non-public information, ensuring a fair trial, or protecting a child from emotional harm.8 Such cases 
are rare, however, as the presumption of openness adopted by the Supreme Court must be overcome 
in order to close hearings to the public.9 In some instances, improper or unjustified closure of court 
proceedings constitutes structural error, requiring “automatic reversal and the grant of a new trial.”10 

2 

The Texas Family Code expressly authorizes the limiting of public access by agreement in contested 
hearings  involving  SAPCR  claims  and  rights.11  If  supported  by  appropriate  findings  made  on  the 
record, the court may limit attendance at the hearing to only those persons who have a direct interest 
in the suit or in the work of the court.12 But because the constitutional right at issue belongs to the 
public rather than the parties, all closures or restrictions of public access to such hearings must satisfy 
the same heightened standards handed down by the Supreme Court in Waller regarding criminal cases 
– even when agreed to by the parties. Thus, while the court may consider the parties’ agreement while 
evaluating  a  request  for  closure,  that  agreement  alone  is  not  sufficient  to  warrant  closure.  The  1st 
Amendment right belongs to the public – not to the parties; the parties cannot waive it by agreement. 

It is the court’s affirmative burden to ensure meaningful and unfettered access to court proceedings. In 
fulfilling this burden, the court must take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure public access.13 
Lack of access to a single hearing (suppression), or even a portion of a single hearing (voir dire), is 
enough to mandate reversal and a new trial. At this time, the movement of the general public is limited 
by the executive branch through the governor and various county judges. Shelter-in-place orders and 
prohibitions on non-essential travel prevent members of the general public from viewing hearings in 
the courthouse. While hearings in courthouses are no longer mandatory under the First Emergency 
Order Regarding the COVID-19 State of Disaster, the emergency order requires “reasonable notice 
and access  to  the  participants and the  public.” Even  if  a  judge  is  physically in  a  courtroom  for  the 
virtual hearing, it is the court’s burden to ensure public access to each hearing and take reasonable 
measures to remove barriers thereto. There is no reasonable access to the public for a hearing, whether 
remote or physically located in a courthouse, when emergency measures are in place that would require 
the public to commit a jailable criminal offense to attend the hearing in person in a courtroom.14 For 
the duration of this crisis and while these emergency orders are in effect, courts must find a practical 
and  effective  way  to  enable  public  access  to  virtual  court  proceedings.  Choosing  not  to  provide 
reasonable  and  meaningful  public  access  to  remote  court  proceedings  at  this  time  may  equate  to 
constitutional error and mandate reversal.

Under the standards established by the United States Supreme Court, the protective measures employed 
must be limited to those necessary to protect an overriding interest and no broader. The trial court must 
consider all reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding and make findings in open court on the 
record  adequate  to  support  the closure.15  The court must  weigh the  totality  of  the  circumstances in 
making these  fact specific findings. For this reason, no standing order or global rule for closure of 
specific categories of  hearings may be preemptively issued by a court without running afoul of the 
requirement to provide the public with access to court proceedings.  

The court should not close the entirety of a hearing from public view in order to protect a single witness 
or topic of testimony. Because the court must apply only the least restrictive measures to protect the 
overriding interest, only specific portions of a hearing or trial that meet this exacting burden may be 
conducted  outside  of  the  public  view,  and  that  only  in  rare  cases.  Appellate  courts  have  reversed 
judgments when a single less-restrictive solution existed but was not considered on the record.16  

Courts should strongly consider employing protective measures short of interrupting or terminating the 
live stream. Federal courts, including the Fifth Circuit, have held that a partial closure of a proceeding 
– limiting access rather than excluding the public – does not raise the same constitutional concerns as 
a  complete  closure  from  public  access.17  To  employ  a  less-restrictive  measure  (for  example, 
temporarily obscuring video but not audio, or not displaying exhibits through screen share,18 providing 
a  phone  number  for  the  public  to access  the  audio of  the  proceeding  only,  or  providing  a link  that 
permits certain members of the public only to view the hearing either through a YouTube private link 
or a link to the Zoom meeting), the court need only find a “substantial reason” for the limitation and 
employ a restriction that does not exceed justifiable limits.19 Terminating or interrupting the livestream 
without an alternative means for the public to view the hearing – even temporarily – would constitute 
a complete closure, and the higher burden would apply. 

It  bears  mentioning  that  this  is  not  a  new  issue  created  by  video  hearings  or  public  livestreaming. 
Sensitive and embarrassing testimony is entered in every contested family law hearing yet rarely merits 
closure or clearing of courtrooms. Child protection cases categorically involve evidence that is or may 
be damaging or embarrassing to the child. Commercial disputes commonly involve protected internal 
corporate  operations.  Rarely  – if  ever  –  have  such  trials  been  closed to  the public.  Such  testimony 
should not now be evaluated differently simply because more people may exercise their constitutional 
right  to  view  court  proceedings  than  ever  before.  Public  exercise  of  a  constitutional  right  does  not 
change the court’s evaluation of whether that right should be protected. Nor should courts erect barriers 
or hurdles to public attendance at hearings to discourage public exercise of that right. On the contrary, 
courts are required to take whatever steps are reasonably calculated to accommodate public attendance. 
Closure of courtrooms is constitutionally suspect and risky and should be a last resort.
