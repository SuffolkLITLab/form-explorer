Texas Legislature appropriated funds to the Office of Court Administration to contract with 
a third party to establish a uniform case management system for use by counties, focusing 
primarily on counties with a population of 20,000 or less; 

WHEREAS, OCA seeks to procure a uniform case management system that will 

assist district and county clerks with timely and uniform data collection (“UCMS”);  

WHEREAS,  the  UCMS  will  provide  accurate  and  uniform  data  to  governmental 

agencies furthering the goals of the Governor’s School Safety Action Plan;

Work; and  

WHEREAS,  OCA  seeks  to  procure  from  Contractor,  and  Contractor  agrees  to 
provide to OCA, on the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Services described 
herein. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of  the  mutual  promises  and  covenants

Reimbursements. To the extent a Service Level Reimbursement or other 
reimbursements or fees may be due to OCA pursuant to this Agreement, 
OCA shall invoice Contractor with the appropriate amounts then due and 
owing.  

Time  Limitation.  Unless  otherwise  requested  by  Contractor  in  advance 
and agreed by OCA in its sole discretion, if Contractor fails to provide an 
invoice to OCA for any amount within four (4) invoice cycles of the month in 
which  the  Services  in  question  are  rendered  or  the  expense  incurred, 
Contractor  shall  waive  any  right  it  may  otherwise  have  to  invoice  for  and

Disputed  Amounts.  OCA  may  withhold  any  amount  of  any  invoice  in

Government  Code.  OCA  shall  comply  with  Chapter  2251,  Texas 
Government Code, with respect to timely notice of such disputed amounts.  

Interest. For invoice amounts that have been paid by OCA that become the

amounts that Contractor may subsequently reimburse to OCA arising from 
resolution of such dispute, Contractor shall include interest on the amounts 
to  be  reimbursed,  accrued  monthly  at  the  rate  specified  by  the  Texas 
Comptroller  of  Public  Accounts  in  accordance  with  Section  2251.025(b), 
Texas Government Code, calculated from the ninetieth (90th) day following 
the date of OCA’s dispute. 

No Waiver. Neither the failure to dispute any Charges or amounts prior to 
payment nor the failure to withhold any amount shall constitute, operate or 
be construed as a waiver of any right OCA may otherwise have to dispute 
any Charge or amount or recover any amount previously paid. 

Prompt  Resolution.  In  the  event  OCA  initiates  a  dispute  related  to  an 
invoice, Contractor shall promptly (but not more than two (2) Business Days 
from  the  time  OCA  initiated  such  dispute)  respond  to  the  issue  raised  in 
such  dispute,  which  response  shall  include  a  written  explanation  of  the 
charges  that  are  the  subject  of  such  dispute,  as  well  as  any  supporting 
documentation necessary to support Contractor’s position. If, within ten (10)

reason  that  Contractor  or  such  Affiliate  or  Subcontractor  failed  to  perform  or 
otherwise breached an obligation of such contract. Contractor hereby certifies that 
it  has  provided  disclosure  of  all  pending,  resolved,  or  completed  litigation, 
mediation,  arbitration  or  other  alternate  dispute  resolution  procedure  involving 
Contractor, its Affiliates or its Subcontractors that could reasonably be expected to 
materially adversely affect Contractor’s ability to perform and fulfill its obligations 
under this Agreement. 

14.14  Completeness of Due Diligence Activities.

information  and  personnel  and  has  had  sufficient  time  in  which  to  conduct  and 
perform a thorough due diligence of OCA’s operations and business requirements 
and  assets  currently  used  by  OCA  in  providing  the  Services.  Accordingly, 
Contractor shall not seek any adjustment in the Charges based on any incorrect 
assumptions made by Contractor in arriving at the Charges. 

14.15  Interoperability. 

Contractor represents, warrants and covenants that the Software and Systems that 
are  owned,  developed,  implemented  or  used  by  Contractor  in  connection  with 
providing the Services shall be interoperable with the Software and Systems used 
by OCA to the extent necessary for OCA to receive the full benefit of the Services. 

14.16  Prohibition on Contracts with Companies Boycotting Israel. 

As  required  by  Texas  Government  Code  Section  2270.002,  by  executing  this 
Agreement, Contractor represents and warrants that it does not, and will not during 
the  Term,  boycott  Israel.  Contractor  further  represents  and  warrants  that  no 
Subcontractor  of  the  Contractor  boycotts  Israel  or  will  boycott  Israel  during  the 
Term. Contractor agrees to take all necessary steps to ensure this representation 
and warranty remains true during the Term.

During the Term, Contractor shall promptly provide, but no later than one hundred 
twenty (120) days after the end of the Contractor’s fiscal year, its year-end financial

(without a “going concern” or like qualification or exception as to the scope of such 
audit) to the effect that the financial statements present fairly the financial condition 
and results of operation of the Contractor.

OCA Contract No. 212210180 

THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE INDEMNITIES ABOVE SHALL CONTINUE IN 
EFFECT  EVEN  IN  THE  CASE  WHERE  A  PORTION  OF  THE  DAMAGE  IS 
CAUSED BY THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OF OCA. 
HOWEVER,  THE  PARTIES  FURTHER  AGREE  THAT  CONTRACTOR  IN  NO 
WAY WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OTHERWISE AVAILABLE TO IT IN ANY SUCH 
EVENT, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO ASSERT COMPARATIVE FAULT OF OCA. 

16.5 

Infringement and Mitigation. 

In the event that (i) Contractor receives or otherwise learns of any threat, warning, 
or notice alleging that all, or any component or feature of the Services violates an 
Intellectual Property Right, or (ii) OCA’s continued use of Work Product, Contractor 
Owned Material, or Services is enjoined; then, in each case, Contractor shall, in 
addition  to  defending,  indemnifying  and  holding  harmless  OCA  as  provided  in 
Section  16.2  and  to  the  other  rights  OCA  may  have  under  this  Agreement, 
promptly  and  at  its  own  option,  cost  and  expense  and  in  such  a  manner  as  to 
minimize  the  disturbance  to  OCA’s  operations  and  activities,  do  one  of  the 
following: 

(a)  Obtain Rights. Obtain for OCA the right to continue using and receiving the 

benefits of such Work Product, Contractor Owned Material, or Services. 

(b)  Modification. Modify the item(s) in question so that it is no longer infringing 
or  enjoined  (provided  that  such  modification  does  not  degrade  the 
performance or quality of the Services or adversely affect OCA’s intended 
use as contemplated by this Agreement). 

(c) 

(d) 

Replacement. Replace such item(s) with a non-infringing or non-enjoined, 
as applicable, functional and qualitative equivalent acceptable to OCA. 

Discontinued Use. If, despite Contractor’s commercially reasonable efforts 
to effect the alternatives set forth in Sections 16.5(a), (b), and (c) above, 
the Parties determine that none of such alternatives are feasible, Contractor 
may discontinue its use of such infringing, potentially infringing or enjoined 
Work Product, Contractor Owned Material, or Services; provided, however, 
that neither such right nor such discontinuation shall limit or expand OCA’s 
rights or Contractor’s obligations under this Agreement; nor shall such right 
or such discontinuation excuse any breach by Contractor of its obligation to 
provide the Services in a non-infringing and non-enjoined manner.  

16.6 

Indemnification Procedures.  

With respect to claims which are subject to indemnification under this Agreement, 
the following procedures shall apply: 

(a) 

Notice.  Promptly  after  receipt  by  any  person  or  entity  entitled  to 
indemnification  under  this  Agreement  of  notice  of  the  commencement  or

MSA 
OCA Contract No. 212210180 

threatened  commencement  of  any  civil,  criminal,  administrative  or 
investigative action or proceeding involving a claim in respect of which the 
OCA Indemnitee may seek indemnification hereunder, the OCA Indemnitee 
shall  notify  Contractor  of  such  claim.  No  delay  or  failure  to  so  notify 
Contractor shall relieve Contractor of its obligations under this Agreement 
except to the extent that Contractor has suffered actual prejudice by such 
delay or failure. Within fifteen (15) Business Days following receipt of notice 
from the indemnitee relating to any claim, but no later than five (5) Business 
Days before the date on which any response to a complaint or summons is 
due, Contractor may notify the indemnitee that Contractor elects to assume 
control  of  the  defense  and  investigation  of  that  claim  (a  “Notice  of 
Election”). 

(b) 

(c) 

Procedure Following Notice of Election. If Contractor delivers a Notice 
of Election within the required notice period, Contractor shall immediately 
take control of the defense and investigation of such claim and shall employ 
counsel reasonably acceptable to OCA to handle and defend the same, at 
Contractor’s sole cost and expense.  

Procedure Where No Notice of Election Is Delivered. If Contractor does 
not  deliver  a  Notice  of  Election  relating  to  any  claim  within  the  required 
notice period, the OCA Indemnitee shall have the right to defend the claim 
in  such  manner  as  it  may  deem  appropriate.  Contractor  shall  promptly 
reimburse the OCA Indemnitee for all such reasonable costs and expenses 
incurred by the OCA Indemnitee, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. 

16.7  Subrogation. 

In the event that Contractor shall be obligated to indemnify an indemnitee pursuant 
to  any  provision  of  this  Agreement,  Contractor  shall,  upon  payment  of  such 
indemnity in full, be subrogated to all rights of the indemnitee with respect to the 
claims to which such indemnification relates.  

17. 

LIABILITY 

17.1  General Intent. 

Subject to the specific provisions and limitations of this Article 17, and to the extent 
allowed by applicable Laws, it is the intent of the Parties that each Party shall be 
liable  to  the  other  Party  for  any  actual  damages  incurred  as  a  result  of  the 
breaching Party’s failure to perform its obligations in the manner required by this 
Agreement.  

17.2  Force Majeure. 

(a)  General. Subject to Section 17.2(c), no Party shall be liable for any default 
or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement if and to

the extent such default or delay is caused, directly or indirectly, by fire, flood, 
earthquake, elements of nature or acts of God, wars, riots, civil disorders, 
rebellions  or  revolutions,  acts  of  terrorism,  epidemics,  pandemics,  and 
provided that such default or delay cannot reasonably be circumvented by 
the  non-performing  Party  through  the  use  of  prudent  planning,  alternate 
sources,  incident  response  plans,  workaround  plans  or  other  means 
(“Force  Majeure  Event”).  A  strike,  lockout  or  labor  dispute  involving 
Contractor  Personnel  shall  not  excuse  Contractor  from  its  obligations 
hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 17.2, 
Contractor  shall  remain  obligated  to  perform  its  obligations  contained  in 
Section 7.1(a). 

Substitute  Services;  Termination.  If  any  Force  Majeure  Event  has 
substantially prevented, hindered or delayed or is reasonably expected to 
substantially  prevent,  hinder  or  delay  the  performance  by  Contractor  of 
Services necessary for the performance of critical OCA functions for longer 
than the recovery period specified in the applicable Disaster Recovery Plan 
or,  if  there  is  no  such  specified  recovery  period,  twenty-four  (24)  hours, 
Contractor  shall,  unless  and  until  otherwise  directed  by  OCA,  use 
commercially reasonable efforts to procure such Services from an alternate 
source at Contractor’s expense for so long as the delay in performance shall 
continue, up to the Charges actually paid to Contractor for the Services with 
respect to the period of non-performance. In addition, if any Force Majeure 
Event  substantially  prevents,  hinders  or  delays  the  performance  by 
Contractor  of  Services  necessary  for  the  performance  of  critical  OCA 
functions for more than five (5) Business Days, then OCA may, upon notice 
to Contractor, terminate this Agreement in its entirety or any portion of the 
Services  so  affected  (including  portions  that  are  no  longer  required  if  the 
impacted portion is terminated) as of the termination date specified in the 
notice.  

Disaster  Recovery.  Upon  the  occurrence  of  a  Force  Majeure  Event  that 
prohibits the ability of OCA to provide critical business functions for some 
predetermined  period  of  time,  or  any  other  event  that  is  designated  as  a 
“Disaster”  under  the  applicable  Disaster  Recovery  Plan,  Contractor  shall 
promptly implement, as appropriate, the applicable business continuity and 
Disaster  Recovery  Plan  and  provide  business  continuity  and  Disaster 
Recovery Services, as described in the Disaster Recovery Plan. 

Payment Obligation. If Contractor fails to provide Services in accordance 
with  this  Agreement  due  to  the  occurrence  of  a  Force  Majeure  Event,  all 
amounts  payable  to  Contractor  hereunder  shall  be  equitably  adjusted 
downward so that OCA is not required to pay any amounts for Services that 
OCA is not receiving, whether from Contractor or from an alternate source 
at Contractor’s expense pursuant to Section 17.2(b). Contractor shall not 
have  the  right  to  additional  payments  or  increased  usage  charges  as  a

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

Exclusions  from  Limitations.   EXCEPT  AS  PROVIDED  IN  THIS 
SECTION  17.3,  NEITHER  PARTY  SHALL  BE  LIABLE  TO  THE  OTHER 
PARTY  FOR  INDIRECT,  CONSEQUENTIAL,  SPECIAL,  INCIDENTAL, 
COLLATERAL,  EXEMPLARY  OR  PUNITIVE  DAMAGES,  INCLUDING 
LOST  PROFITS,  REGARDLESS  OF  THE  FORM  OF  THE  ACTION  OR 
THE  THEORY  OF  RECOVERY,  EVEN  IF  SUCH  PARTY  HAS  BEEN 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

Liability  Cap.  Except  as  limited  by  applicable  Laws  (including  those 
provisions applying to governmental agencies under the constitution of the 
State), the total aggregate liability of either Party, for all claims asserted by

the form of the action or the theory of recovery, shall not exceed the greater 
of (i) Charges paid and payable by OCA to Contractor during the twenty-
four (24) months preceding the date upon which the cause of action accrues 
hereunder or (ii) $5,000,000.  

Acknowledged Direct Damages. For the avoidance of doubt, the following 
shall be considered direct damages and neither Party shall assert that the 
following  are  indirect,  incidental,  collateral,  consequential  or  special 
damages or lost profits to the extent they result directly from the breaching 
Party’s failure to perform in accordance with this Agreement: 

(i) 

(ii) 

Costs and expenses of restoring, reloading, or notifying of any lost, 
stolen or damaged Customer Data. 

Costs and expenses of implementing a work around in respect of a 
failure to provide the Services or any part thereof.

in excess of the Charges that would have been paid Contractor for 
such Services. 

(iv) 

Fines,  penalties,  sanctions,  interest  or  other  monetary  remedies 
incurred as a result of a failure to comply with applicable Laws. 

(v) 

Service Level Reimbursements assessed against Contractor. 

(vi) 

Lost  discounts,  late  fees  and/or  interest  charges  incurred  by  OCA

The absence of direct damages listed in this Section 17.3(c) shall not be 
construed or interpreted as an agreement to exclude it as a direct damage 
under this Agreement.  

(d)  Waiver  of  Liability  Cap.   If,  at  any  time,  the  total  aggregate  liability  of 
Contractor  for  claims  asserted  by  OCA  under  or  in  connection  with  this 
Agreement  exceeds  sixty  percent  (60%)  of  the  applicable  liability  cap 
specified  in  Section  17.3(b)  and,  upon  receipt  of  the  request  of  OCA, 
Contractor refuses to waive such cap and/or increase the available cap to 
an amount at least equal to the original liability cap, then OCA may, upon 
notice,  terminate  this  Agreement  in  its  entirety  as  of  the  termination  date 
specified in the notice. 

18.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION 

18.1 

Informal Dispute Resolution. 

Subject to compliance with Chapter 2260, Texas Government Code, prior to the 
initiation of formal dispute resolution procedures with respect to any dispute, other 
than as provided in Section 18.1(b), the Parties shall first attempt to resolve such 
dispute informally, and in accordance with the Statement of Work.  

(a) 

(b) 

Prerequisite to Formal Proceedings. In the event that a Party determines 
that amicable resolution through continued negotiations of a dispute does 
not  appear  likely,  such  Party  shall  be  entitled  to  discontinue  negotiations 
and resolve the dispute through the dispute resolution process provided for 
in Chapter 2260, Texas Government Code. 

Equitable Remedies. Notwithstanding the provisions and escalation time 
periods  specified  in  this  Agreement  (including  the  Statement  of  Work), 
either  Party  may  at  any  time  discontinue  negotiations  and  resolve  the 
dispute through the dispute resolution process provided for in Chapter 2260, 
Texas  Government  Code  in  order  to  (i)  avoid  the  expiration  of  any 
applicable limitations period, (ii) preserve a superior position with respect to 
other creditors, (iii) address a claim arising out of the breach of a Party’s 
obligations under Article 12, or (iv) pursue claims for injunctive relief with 
respect to a Party’s obligations to the extent resulting in irreparable injury.  

18.2  Jurisdiction. 

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article 18 or unless the specific 
venue  is  otherwise  identified  in  a  statute  which  directly  names  or  otherwise 
identifies  its  applicability  to  OCA,  each  Party  irrevocably  agrees  that  any  legal 
action,  suit  or  proceeding  brought  by  such  Party  in  any  way  arising  out  of  this 
Agreement  must  be  brought  solely  and  exclusively  in  the  United  States  District 
Court for the Western District of Texas, Austin Division, or in the state courts of the 
State of Texas located in Austin, Travis County, Texas, and irrevocably accepts

and submits to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of each of the aforesaid courts, 
in  personam,  generally  and  unconditionally  with  respect  to  any  action,  suit  or 
proceeding brought by it or against it by the other Party; provided, however, that 
this Section 18.2 shall not prevent a Party against whom any legal action, suit or 
proceeding is brought by the other Party in the state courts of the State of Texas 
from  seeking  to  remove  such  legal  action,  suit  or  proceeding,  pursuant  to 
applicable federal Law, to the United States District Court for the Western District 
of  Texas,  Austin  Division,  and  in  the  event  an  action  is  so  removed  each  Party 
irrevocably accepts and submits to the jurisdiction of the aforesaid district court. 

18.3  Continued Performance. 

(a)  General. Each Party agrees that it shall, unless otherwise directed by the 
other Party, continue performing its obligations under this Agreement while 
any dispute is being resolved; provided that this provision shall not operate 
or be construed as extending the Term of this Agreement or prohibiting or 
delaying  a  Party’s  exercise  of  any  right  it  may  have  to  terminate  this 
Agreement  as  expressly  provided  herein.  For  purposes  of  clarification, 
Customer Data may not be withheld by Contractor pending the resolution 
of any dispute. 

(b) 

Non-Interruption of Services. Contractor acknowledges and agrees that 
any interruption to the Services may cause irreparable harm to OCA and 
Customer and may adversely impact the ability of the State to carry out vital 
public safety and other governmental functions, in which case an adequate 
remedy  at  Law  would  not  be  available.  Except  to  the  extent  expressly 
permitted  under  Chapter  2251,  Texas  Government  Code,  Contractor 
expressly  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  at  all  times,  including  pending 
resolution of any dispute or controversy, it shall continue to perform under 
this Agreement and not directly or indirectly engage in any act or omission 
that  may  have  a  detrimental  effect  on  provision  of  the  Services  to  OCA 
under this Agreement. 

18.4  Governing Law. 

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws 
of the State of Texas, without regard to the conflicts of law provisions.

shall  in  no  manner  limit  (A)  OCA’s  right  of  termination  pursuant  to 
any other provision of Section 19.1(a), or (B) Contractor’s obligation 
to cure individual nonmaterial breaches of this Agreement;

following  an  additional  thirty  (30)  days,  terminate  this  Agreement  in  its 
entirety as of the termination date specified in the further notice (provided 
that OCA has not cured the default prior to the effective date of termination). 
Contractor acknowledges and agrees that this Section 19.1(b) describes 
Contractor’s sole right to terminate this Agreement and Contractor hereby 
waives any other rights it may have to terminate this Agreement.  

19.2  Termination for Convenience.  

OCA  may  (without  incurring  any  liabilities)  terminate  this  Agreement,  the 
Statement of Work, or a Customer Contract for any reason or no reason, in whole 
or in part, (a) if it is in the best interest of the State of Texas to do so, or (b) upon 
at least ninety (90) days’ prior notice to Contractor, effective as of the termination 
date specified in such notice.  

19.3  Termination Upon Contractor Change of Control.  

In the event there is a change in control of Contractor (or that portion of Contractor 
providing all or any portion of the Services under this Agreement), or Contractor 
(or that portion of Contractor providing all or any portion of the Services under this 
Agreement) is merged with or into another entity, then Contractor shall immediately

Agreement, in whole or in part, upon at least ten (10) Business Days’ prior notice

the board of directors, or (c) a direct or indirect change in beneficial ownership of 
25% or more of the equity interest in Contractor. 

19.4  OCA Rights Upon Contractor’s Bankruptcy.  

(a)  General Rights. In the event of Contractor’s bankruptcy or of the filing of 
any petition under bankruptcy Laws affecting the rights of Contractor which 
is not stayed or dismissed within thirty (30) days of filing, in addition to the 
other rights and remedies set forth herein, to the maximum extent permitted 
by Law, OCA shall have the immediate right to retain and take possession 
for  safekeeping  all  Customer  Data,  OCA  Confidential  Information,  OCA 
licensed  Third  Party  Materials,  OCA  owned  Materials,  and  all  other 
Materials or Systems to which OCA is or would be entitled during the Term 
or upon the expiration or any termination of this Agreement. Contractor shall 
cooperate  fully  with  OCA  and  assist  OCA  in  identifying  and  taking 
possession of the items listed in the preceding sentence. OCA shall have 
the right to hold such Customer Data, Confidential Information, Materials, 
and Systems until such time as the trustee or receiver in bankruptcy or other 
appropriate insolvency office holder can provide adequate assurances and 
evidence to OCA that they shall be protected from sale, release, inspection,

publication,  or  inclusion  in  any  publicly  accessible  record,  document, 
material  or  filing.  Contractor  and  OCA  agree  that  without  this  material 
provision, OCA would not have entered into this Agreement or provided any 
right  to  the  possession  or  use  of  Customer  Data,  OCA  Confidential 
Information or OCA Materials and Systems covered by this Agreement. 

(b)  OCA  Rights  in  Event  of  Bankruptcy  Rejection.  Notwithstanding  any 
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to the maximum extent 
permitted  by  applicable  Laws,  in  the  event  that  Contractor  becomes  a 
debtor under the United States Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. §101 et. seq. 
or  any  similar  Law  in  any  other  country  (the  “Bankruptcy  Code”))  and 
rejects this Agreement pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code (a 
“Bankruptcy  Rejection”),  then  (i)  any  and  all  of  the  licensee  and 
sublicensee  rights  of  OCA  arising  under  or  otherwise  set  forth  in  this 
Agreement  shall  be  deemed  fully  retained  by  and  vested  in  OCA  as 
protected  Intellectual  Property  Rights  under  Section  365(n)(1)(B)  of  the 
Bankruptcy Code and further shall be deemed to exist immediately before 
the  commencement  of  the  bankruptcy  case  in  which  Contractor  is  the 
debtor, (ii) OCA shall have all of the rights afforded to non-debtor licensees 
and sublicensees under Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code, and (iii) to 
the  extent  any  rights  of  OCA  which  arise  after  the  expiration  or  any 
termination of this Agreement are determined by a bankruptcy court not to 
be  “intellectual  property  rights”  for  purposes  of  Section  365(n)  of  the 
Bankruptcy Code, all of such rights shall remain vested in and fully retained 
by  OCA  after  any  Bankruptcy  Rejection  as  though  this  Agreement  were 
terminated  or  expired.  OCA  shall  under  no  circumstances  be  required  to 
terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part, after a Bankruptcy Rejection 
in order to enjoy or acquire any of its rights under this Agreement, unless 
and to the extent required by applicable Laws. 

19.5  Termination for Adverse Change in Contractor’s Financial Condition. 

If  (i)  Contractor  receives  a  “going  concern”  explanation  or  qualification  from  its 
external auditor, (ii) Moody’s Investors Service lowers Contractor’s long term credit 
rating  to  Ba2  or  lower,  or  (iii)  Standard  &  Poor’s  lowers  Contractor’s  long  term 
credit rating to BB or lower and, in each case, in the reasonable opinion of OCA 
such  change  in  the  financial  condition  of  Contractor  may  impair  or  otherwise 
compromise  the  ability  of  Contractor  to  perform  its  obligations  under  this 
Agreement,  then  OCA  may,  in  its  sole  discretion,  terminate  this  Agreement  by 
giving Contractor at least thirty (30) days’ prior notice. With respect to the events 
described in (ii) or (iii) above, prior to exercising its right to terminate, OCA shall 
meet  with  Contractor  within  ten  (10)  Business  Days  following  notification  (or 
awareness)  of  such  event  and  permit  Contractor  to  submit  to  OCA  a  plan  that 
comprehensively  addresses  OCA’s  concerns  related  to  Contractor’s  ability  to 
perform  its  obligations  under  this  Agreement.  If  OCA,  in  its  sole  discretion, 

Page 44 of 70 
 

DocuSign Envelope ID: 0EF09423-C95A-44E7-BFFC-C626A7B33C8A 

determines  that  the  plan  does  not  adequately  address  its  concerns,  OCA  shall 
have the right to terminate this Agreement as described above.  

MSA 
OCA Contract No. 212210180 

19.6  Absolute Right. 

If  Contractor  becomes  (i)  listed  on  the  prohibited  vendors  list  authorized  by 
Executive Order Number 13224, “Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions 
with Persons Who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism”, published 
by the United States Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, 
or  (ii)  suspended  or  debarred  from  doing  business  with  the  State  or  federal 
government as listed in the State of Texas Debarred Vendor List or the Excluded 
Parties List System maintained by the General Services Administration, then OCA 
may, upon notice to Contractor, terminate this Agreement, in whole or, to the extent 
possible under applicable Law, in part, as of the termination date specified in the 
notice. 

19.7  Lack of Sufficient Funds or Statutory Authority.  

If funding for OCA’s obligations under this Agreement is reduced by Law or funds 
sufficient  to  pay  Contractor  for  the  Services  provided  hereunder  are  not 
appropriated by applicable governing bodies or otherwise made available by Law, 
then OCA may, upon at least thirty (30) days’ prior notice to Contractor, decrease 
the amount and types of the Services in such manner and for such periods of time 
as OCA may elect. In such event, (i) the Charges shall be adjusted downward in 
proportion to the portion of the Services that Contractor shall not be providing, and 
(ii) the Parties shall negotiate equitable adjustments to the Service Levels if and to 
the  extent  that  any  resulting  reductions  in  scope  or  volume  of  Services  directly 
affects Contractor’s ability  to meet the Service Levels, provided, that Contractor 
notifies OCA the extent to which it shall not be able to meet such Service Levels 
the  Service  Levels 
and  uses  commercially  reasonable  efforts 
notwithstanding  such  reductions.  OCA  shall  promptly  notify  Contractor  if  OCA 
believes  that  the  necessary  funding  or  authorizations  shall  not  be  obtained.  If 
partial funding sufficient only for a portion of the Services shall be made available, 
the  Parties  may  agree  to  perform  their  respective  obligations  relative  to  such 
Services,  and  this  Agreement  shall  be  amended  accordingly.  OCA  is  a  State 
agency whose authority is subject to the actions of the State legislature. If funds 
sufficient to pay OCA’s obligations under this Agreement are not appropriated by 
applicable governmental authorities or if OCA’s statutory authority to enter into this 
Agreement is repealed by the State legislature or ruled unconstitutional by a court 
of competent jurisdiction, then OCA may, upon notice to Contractor, terminate this 
Agreement, in whole or in part, as of the termination date specified in the notice 
without  penalty  or  charges  to  OCA.  If  OCA  and/or  the  subject  matter  of  this 
Agreement become subject to a legislative or regulatory change or the revocation 
of statutory or regulatory authority that would (a) render the continued provision of 
the Services impossible or unnecessary, (b) render this Agreement invalid, illegal 
or  otherwise  unenforceable,  (c)  substantially  decrease  the  amount  and  types  of 
the Services or (d) terminate the appropriations for this Agreement, then OCA may, 

to  meet

upon notice to Contractor, terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part, as of the 
termination date specified in the notice, without penalty to OCA.

OCA Contract No. 212210180 

19.8  Termination of a Customer Contract. 

If OCA elects to terminate a Customer Contract then, upon the effective date of 
termination  for  such  Customer  Contract,  those  Charges  attributable  to  the 
terminated Customer Contract shall cease. 

20.  GENERAL 

20.1  No Waiver of Sovereign Immunity. 

The Parties expressly agree that no provision of this Agreement shall be construed 
as or constitute a waiver by OCA, Customers, or the State of any immunities from 
suit  or  from  liability  that  OCA  or  the  State  have  by  operation  of  law  (whether 
constitutional or statutory, whether State or federal). 

20.2  RFO Errors and/or Omissions. 

Neither Party shall take advantage of or exploit any errors and/or omissions in the 
RFO or the resulting Agreement. Each Party must promptly (but not more than two 
(2) days from the time in which it first becomes aware of any such situation) notify 
the  other  Party  of  any  such  errors  and/or  omissions  that  are  discovered  and 
reasonably agree to modifications consistent with the intent of the Parties as of the 
Effective Date of this Agreement. 

20.3  Abandonment or Default. 

If  Contractor  abandons  this  Agreement,  OCA  reserves  the  right  to  cancel  this 
Agreement without notice and either re-solicit and re-award this Agreement or take 
such further action or no action in the best interest of the State or the Customer, 
and  Contractor  shall  not  be  considered  in  the  re-solicitation  and  may  not  be 
considered  in  future  solicitations  for  the  same  type  of  Services,  unless  the 
Specifications or scope of work significantly changes. 

20.4  Place of Performance. 

Unless  otherwise  agreed  to  in  writing,  all  Services  performed  by  Contractor,  its 
Subcontractors  and  agents  must  be  performed  in  the  United  States  and  any 
Customer  Data  shall  reside  exclusively  within  the  territorial  boundaries  of  the 
United States. For avoidance of doubt, no Customer Data shall be stored in a data 
center or any other facility outside the territorial boundaries of the United States. 

20.5  Buy Texas.

20.6  Binding Nature and Assignment. 

(a) 

(b) 

Binding Nature. This Agreement shall be binding on the Parties and their 
respective  successors,  permitted  assigns,  transferees,  and  delegates.

portion of this Agreement pursuant to Section 20.6(b), the assigning Party 
shall  remain  liable  for  the  performance  of  any  assigned  or  transferred 
obligations hereunder. 

Assignment. Contractor may not assign all or any portion of its rights under 
or interests in this Agreement (including by operation of law) or delegate, in 
whole or in part, any of its duties without the prior written consent of OCA, 
which consent will not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed; 
provided,  however,  in  the  event  of  a  merger,  acquisition,  or  purchase  of 
substantially  all  of  Contractor’s  assets,  Contractor  may  assign  this 
Agreement  to  (i)  an  Affiliate  or  (ii)  a  business  entity  that  is  capable  of 
complying  with  and  performing  all  obligations  under  this  Agreement 
(including,  if  applicable,  the  parent  company  of  such  business  entity); 
provided that notice to OCA of such assignment shall occur within two (2) 
Business  Days  of  such  assignment.    OCA  may,  without  the  approval  of 
Contractor, assign or transfer its rights or obligations under this Agreement, 
in  whole  or  in  part,  to  any  other  State  agency  as  directed  by  the  State 
legislature or as otherwise required under Law. The consent of a Party to 
any assignment of this Agreement shall not constitute such Party’s consent 
to  further  assignment.  Each  party  to  whom  an  assignment  or  transfer  is 
made must assume all or any part of Contractor’s or OCA’s interests in this 
Agreement, the Services, and any documents executed with respect to this 
Agreement, including its obligation for all or any portion of the payments due 
hereunder. 

(c) 

Impermissible  Assignment.  Any  attempted  assignment  that  does  not 
comply  with  the  terms  of  this  Section  shall  be  null  and  void  ab  initio; 
in 
provided,  however, 
contravention of this Section by operation of Law, such assignment shall be 
voidable at the option of OCA.

20.11  Relationship of Parties. 

MSA 
OCA Contract No. 212210180 

Contractor,  in  furnishing  Services  hereunder,  is  acting  as  an  independent 
contractor, and Contractor has the sole obligation to supervise, manage, contract, 
direct,  procure,  perform  or  cause  to  be  performed,  all  work  to  be  performed  by 
Contractor  under  this  Agreement.  The  relationship  of  the  Parties  under  this 
Agreement  shall  not  constitute  a  partnership  or  joint  venture  for  any  purpose. 
Contractor is not an agent of OCA and has no right, power or authority, expressly 
or impliedly, to represent or bind OCA as to any matters. 

20.12  Severability. 

If any provision of this Agreement (or any portion thereof) or the application of any 
such provision (or portion thereof) to any person, entity, or circumstance is held to 
be invalid, illegal or otherwise unenforceable in any respect by a final judgment by 
a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be deemed to be void and 
unenforceable. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the remaining provisions 
of this Agreement, if capable of substantial performance, shall remain in full force 
and  effect.  By  entering  into  this  Agreement,  OCA  makes  no  representations  or 
warranties regarding the enforceability of the terms of this Agreement and OCA 
does not waive any applicable Law that conflicts with the terms of this Agreement. 

20.13  Consents and Approval. 

Except where expressly provided as being in the sole discretion of a Party, where 
any  agreement,  approval,  acceptance,  consent,  confirmation,  determination, 
notice,  or  similar  action  by  either  Party  is  required  under  this  Agreement,  such 
action shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld. An approval or consent given 
by a Party under this Agreement shall not relieve the other Party from responsibility 
for complying with the requirements of this Agreement, nor shall it be construed as 
a waiver of any rights under this Agreement, except as and to the extent otherwise 
expressly provided in such approval or consent. 

20.14  Waiver of Default; Cumulative Remedies. 

(a)  Waiver of Default. A delay or omission by either Party hereto to exercise 
any  right  or  power  under  this  Agreement  shall  not  be  construed  to  be  a 
waiver  thereof.  A  waiver  by  either  of  the  Parties  hereto  of  any  of  the 
covenants to be performed by the other or any breach thereof shall not be 
construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach thereof or of any other 
covenant herein contained. All waivers must be in writing and signed by the 
Party waiving its rights. 

(b) 

Cumulative Remedies. Except as expressly set forth herein, all remedies 
provided for in this Agreement shall be cumulative and in addition to and 
not in lieu of any other remedies available to either Party at Law, in equity 
or  otherwise.  The  election  by  a  Party  of  any  remedy  provided  for  in  this 

Page 50 of 70 
 

DocuSign Envelope ID: 0EF09423-C95A-44E7-BFFC-C626A7B33C8A 

Agreement  or  otherwise  available  to  such  Party  shall  not  preclude  such 
Party from pursuing any other remedies available to such Party at Law, in 
equity, by contract or otherwise.

20.15  Survival. 

Any provision of this Agreement which contemplates performance or observance 
subsequent to any termination or expiration of this Agreement shall survive any 
termination or expiration of this Agreement and continue in full force and effect. 
Additionally,  all  provisions  of  this  Agreement  shall  survive  the  expiration  or 
termination of this Agreement to the fullest extent necessary to give the Parties the 
full benefit of the bargain expressed herein. Notwithstanding the expiration or any 
termination  of  this  Agreement,  (i)  the  limitations  on  use  and  disclosure  by 
Contractor with respect to Confidential Information shall survive the expiration or 
any termination of this Agreement and shall be perpetual and (ii) other than the 
foregoing  with  respect  to  the  survival  of  Confidential  Information,  each  Party’s 
confidentiality  obligations  under  this  Agreement  shall  continue  for  any  period 
required by applicable Law or, in the absence of a required period, perpetually until 
such time as the Confidential Information is publicly known and made generally 
available  through  no  action  or  inaction  of  the  Receiving  Party  or  any  agent, 
employee or Affiliate thereof.  

20.16  Publicity. 

Contractor shall not publish any media release relating to this Agreement, including 
Parties  to  this  Agreement,  without  the  prior  written  consent  of  OCA.  Contractor 
shall provide OCA with a copy of any such pre-approved media release not less 
than five (5) Business Days prior to its intended public release. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, Contractor may use OCA’s name in any client lists.  

Contractor agrees that it shall not, without OCA’s prior written consent, use any of 
the  names,  service  marks  or  trademarks  of  OCA  or  any  Customer  in  any  of  its 
advertising or marketing materials.

20.18  Export. 

The Parties acknowledge that certain Materials and technical data to be provided 
hereunder and certain transactions hereunder may be subject to export controls 
under the Laws of the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and 
other jurisdictions. Without limiting the Parties’ obligations under Section 14.10, 
no Party shall export or re-export any such items or any direct product thereof or 
undertake  any  transaction  or  service  in  violation  of  any  such  Laws  and,  to  the 
extent  within  Contractor’s  control,  Contractor  shall  be  responsible  for,  and  shall 
coordinate  and  oversee,  compliance  with  such  export  Laws  in  respect  of  such

Statement of Work 

Below are the high-level expectations of the project implementation:  

  Standard  case  management  functionality  with  no  customizations  per  county  (local 

configuration is allowable and expected) 

  Case management system including all case types handled by district / county courts  

  Web service capabilities or inclusion of web service calls with identified integrators (e.g., 

TxDPS and OCA)  

  Ability to export all data using the National Open Data Standards (NODS) model 

 

Implementation  primarily  by  Clerks  in  rural  counties  with  an  approximate  population  of 
20,000 who elect to implement UCMS 

  Provide APIs to enable system interfaces with relevant systems (e.g., eFileTexas including 

document access) 

Contractor  shall  perform  the  services  as  described  below.  It  is  expected  that  implementation 
services  for  the  early  adopter  implementation  will  be  of  higher  level  of  effort  than  subsequent 
rollouts as the baseline configuration will be established during the early adopter implementation. 
Specific  details  are  discussed  further  in  this  Statement  of  Work  section  and  captured  in 
Attachment 2-1 Requirements, but a summary is provided below.

1)  Project Management Plan – Describes the overall project 

planning and preparation 
– Conduct planning 
meetings with OCA and 
other stakeholders as 
required to confirm the 
schedule, plans, 
documentation, and other 
logistics for the project 
related to project 
management 
responsibilities. 

  Develop project kickoff 
materials – Conduct a 
project kickoff meeting with 
key stakeholders within 

management approach and schedule throughout the lifecycle of 
the project. The Project Management Plan will define the following 
(at a minimum): 

a)  Risk and Issue Management Plans & Logs – Risk and Issue 
Management Plan, Escalation Plan, and Risk and Issue 
Register (which must comply with the requirements of the 
Texas Project Delivery Framework).

content in all SOW attachments, such as the 
Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM). If a potential 
change is identified by a member of the project team, 
including the Contractor or OCA (or other internal/external 
stakeholder), then the change management process 
outlined below shall be used to initiate a formal Change 
Request. Similarly, whenever significant deviations are 
anticipated or reported against implementation processes, 
schedule or cost, a Change Request is required to re-
baseline the project. 

ii)  Change Requests can be initiated at any stakeholder level 
and may or may not require a formal contract change 
depending upon its scope. Either OCA or Contractor may 
initiate a Change Request for a desired process change, 
additional funding, and/or a longer timeline as conditions 
may change on the project over time.  

iii)  During the project, all potential Change Requests must be 
brought to the Steering Committee (SC) that is composed 
of key stakeholders from the Texas Judiciary and OCA 
executive staff and facilitated by the OCA Project 
Manager. The SC serves as the “Change Control Board” 
for this project. The Change Request must contain, at a 
minimum, the description of the change, the schedule to 
implement the change, and a fixed price based on the 
number of hours required. 

iv)  The SC is responsible for making decisions on 

approval/rejection and subsequent prioritization and timing 
of all Change Requests.  

v)  When the SC reviews Change Requests, the SC may 

approve the Change Request, consider alternatives, direct 
the project team to do more research, reject the Change 
Request and continue the project, or reject the Change 
Request and request a different change. The SC 
considers whether the Change Request undermines or 
supports the project benefits or the project alignment with 
OCA’s major goals, strategy, budget, and/or direction. 

vi)  Any changes to the Statement of Work or the Service 
Level Agreement are subject to OCA’s prior written 
approval. In the absence of any modifications, the 
performance targets, Service Level Requirements, and 
measurement intervals in the Service Level Agreement 
shall apply during the Term of the Agreement.

The Contractor will develop the Project Deliverable Expectations 
Documents, which describe the proposed high-level outline and format 
of each deliverable. The document will be developed by tailoring an 
existing template in collaboration with OCA. OCA and the Contractor 
will agree on the Project Deliverable Expectations Documents at the 
beginning of the project and confirm the Project Deliverable 
Expectations Documents before each subsequent deliverable phase. 

No work will be performed on any deliverable associated with a 
payment milestone until all Deliverable Expectations Documents have 
been approved in writing by the OCA Project Manager. As each 
project deliverable is submitted, the Contractor must include a copy of 
the associated Deliverable Expectations Document as the cover sheet.  

All contract deliverables are given a unique number and tied to the 
project schedule. The dates for deliverable submissions, review 
comments, and resubmissions will be tracked. OCA’s project 
SharePoint site will be utilized as the repository of record for 
deliverables. 

Deliverables prepared by the Contractor shall be subject to the review 
and approval of the OCA Project Manager or designee. The 
Contractor must be prepared to provide walkthroughs of deliverables 
in order to facilitate the OCA deliverable reviews. OCA will review, 
approve, or require modification to the Contractor’s deliverables. 
Approval shall be granted if the deliverable conforms to the 
requirements of the Deliverable Expectations Document. OCA shall 
notify the Contractor within ten (10) business days of its receipt of a

approval or rejection, with the reason(s) for rejection and what the 
Contractor must do so that the deliverable will be acceptable. The 
Contractor shall have five (5) business days, or as otherwise agreed to 
by OCA, to correct the deliverable and resubmit the deliverable for 
OCA review. 

The Contractor should consider the review process when developing 
schedules, project plans, and timelines. Specific deliverables and 
acceptance criteria will be finalized based on an offer response to the 
RFO solicitation and any subsequent negotiations.  

The Contractor must provide any formal meeting presentation 
materials no less than five (5) business days ahead of the actual 
meeting for OCA review. In some cases, agencies like to prescribe the 
date the milestone must be completed (e.g., week 3) or other 
constraints.  

The Contractor and OCA will agree on the format and acceptance 
criteria for each project deliverable. The format of the Deliverables 
Expectations Documents will be defined within six (6) weeks from the

Exhibit 3 
OCA Contract No. 212210180 

1. 

Overview 

This  Service  Level  Agreement  (the  “SLA”)  describes  the  provision  of  Services  in  a 
production  environment  by  the  Contractor.  The  Service  Level  Requirements  (“SLRs”), 
attached hereto as Attachment 3-1, identify key performance measures that will be used 
to evaluate the Contractor’s delivery of the Services in a production environment. 

Service Level Reimbursements, to be issued in the form of a credit, have been defined to 
encourage the consistent and timely delivery of Services and value to OCA and are intended 
to reimburse OCA for the value of diminished Services delivered and provide an incentive 
for  the  Contractor  to  achieve  the  stated  SLR  objectives.  They  are  not  intended  to  be 
penalties nor compensate OCA for damages. 

This document describes the following: 

  SLR performance measures and reporting expectations; 

  Process to change or establish new SLR performance measures and/or SLRs; 

and 

  Circumstances under which the Contractor will be required to issue credits for 

failure to achieve SLR performance targets. 

2.

2.4  Changed Service Level Requirements 

The  parties  may  agree  to  add  or  otherwise  make  changes  to  the  SLR.  Any  such 
changes shall be made by mutual written agreement. 

At OCA’s request, the Contractor will provide to OCA the performance data recorded 
by the Contractor in connection with the Services for the purpose of informing OCA 
regarding the implementation of any such changes. 

3. 

Service Level Monitoring and Measurement 

The Contractor will continuously monitor the Uniform Case Management solution and the 
Services  in  order  to  identify,  report,  and  correct  SLR  Failures  and  to  ensure  that  the 
Contractor is meeting or exceeding the SLRs as required herein. 

3.1  Measurement Reporting 

The Contractor will provide reports to OCA regarding their compliance with the SLRs. 

The Contractor will measure all data reasonably required by OCA to determine the 
Contractor’s  performance  of  the  measured  Services  against  the  applicable  SLRs. 
Without limiting the foregoing, the Contractor will keep complete and accurate logs 
of  all  such  data  for  no  less  than  six  months  from  the  availability  of  the  applicable 
report. 

The Contractor will provide OCA with a Web-based dashboard that will display the 
operational status of the Uniform Case Management solution. 

On or before the 15th calendar day of each calendar month or as otherwise requested 
by  OCA,  Contractor  will  deliver  a  performance  measurement  Report  to  OCA 
containing: 

  For each measured SLR and with respect to the immediately preceding calendar 

month, all data relating to the provision of the Service during the applicable 
month; 

  For each measured SLR during the immediately preceding calendar month, 

details of the Contractor’s performance as measured against the SLRs for such 
Service during the applicable month; 

  Details of any Scheduled Downtime which the Contractor believes has impacted 

the measured Services during the applicable month; and 

  Any other information reasonably requested by OCA from time to time. 

For any SLRs with a measurement period of longer than a month, the provision of 
the second item listed above shall apply for the calendar month on which the final 
date of the measurement period for such SLR falls. 

 

Page 5 of 7 

DocuSign Envelope ID: 0EF09423-C95A-44E7-BFFC-C626A7B33C8AExhibit 3 
OCA Contract No. 212210180 

Upon OCA’s request, the Contractor will provide OCA data and details for measured 
SLRs in an OCA approved form and format containing: 

  All data relating to the provision of the measured SLR during the applicable day; 

  Details of the Contractor’s performance as measured against the SLRs during 

the applicable day; 

  Details of any measured SLRs that were supposed to be performed during the 

applicable day that were not fully performed as required; and 

  Details of any measured SLRs that were supposed to have been performed 

during a previous day but were not fully performed as required on that day, and 
the status of such measured Services. 

In generating data for reports provided by the Contractor, the Contractor will use, for 
each  SLR,  the  measurement  tools  and  methodologies  needed  to  adequately 
measure each Service Level, or such other means as reasonably required by OCA 
to confirm the Contractor’s compliance with the SLRs. 

Contractor  will  provide  OCA  with  access  to  an  online  portal  to  view  all  support 
incidents for Authorized Users. 

4. 

Service Problem Analysis 

4.1  Notification of Problems 

Except to the extent that this provision conflicts with Attachment 3-1 (Service Level 
Requirements),  if  Contractor  becomes  aware  of  any  Problem,  Contractor  will:  (i) 
provide OCA with prompt notice of such Problem (no later than two (2) days after 
discovery); (ii) provide OCA with a complete description of the Problem, including its 
expected impact; and (iii) meet with OCA (no later than four (4) days after discovery) 
to formulate and implement an action plan to minimize or eliminate the impact of such 
Problem. 

4.2  Corrective Action Plan 

If either Party reasonably determines that a Problem has or is likely to occur, such 
Party shall promptly (no later than two (2) days) notify the other Party of such Problem 
(a  “CAP  Notice”).  Concurrent  with  delivery  or  receipt  of  such  CAP  Notice,  as 
applicable,  Contractor  shall:  (A)(i)  immediately  take  steps  to  mitigate  any  harmful 
effects of such failure within its control, (ii) upon OCA’s approval, correct the Problem 
as soon as practicable, (iii) continuously, and when requested by OCA, advise OCA 
of the progress and status of remedial efforts being undertaken with respect to such 
Problem, and (iv) demonstrate to OCA that all reasonable action has been taken to 
prevent  a  recurrence  of  the  immediate  failure;  (B)  promptly  upon  resolution  of  the 
Problem  (and  in  any  event,  within  five  (5)  days  after  resolution  of  the  Problem) 
perform a Root Cause Analysis; (C) report to OCA on the nature and scope of the 

 

Page 6 of 7 

DocuSign Envelope ID: 0EF09423-C95A-44E7-BFFC-C626A7B33C8AExhibit 3 
OCA Contract No. 212210180 

Problems identified; and (D) prepare a Corrective Action Plan to correct the source 
of  the  Problems  and  take  all  actions  necessary  to  prevent  recurrence.  Contractor 
shall  commit  all  additional  resources  necessary  to  resolve  and  prevent  Problems 
under the Corrective Action Plan. Following delivery of a Corrective Action Plan and 
Acceptance  of  such  Corrective  Action  Plan  by  OCA,  Contractor  shall,  within  the 
timeline  set  forth  in  the  Corrective  Action  Plan,  promptly  correct  the  source  of  the 
Problems in accordance with the Corrective Action Plan, advise OCA of the progress 
of correction efforts at stages determined by OCA, and demonstrate to OCA that all 
reasonable action has been taken to prevent a recurrence of the failure. 

5. 

Performance Reimbursement 

Critical SLRs and Monitored SLRs set forth in this SLA identify key performance measures 
that will be used to evaluate the Contractor’s delivery of the Services. 

Contractor shall reimburse OCA for failure to achieve any Critical SLR as set forth under 
this Section 5. Monitored SLRs are not subject to Service Level Reimbursements but are 
monitored against key performance indicators (KPIs) for continuous improvement purposes. 

OCA  has  designated  Critical  SLRs  as  set  forth  in  Attachment  3-1.  If  Contractor  fails  to 
achieve  the  performance  target  of  any  Monitored  SLRs  in  any  two  out  of  four  rolling 
Measurement  Periods,  then  upon  OCA’s  notice  to  Contractor,  such  Monitored  SLR  shall 
become a Critical SLR and shall remain a Critical SLR until the Contractor has achieved the 
Performance Targets for such SLR for two consecutive measurement periods, then such 
Critical SLR shall automatically revert to a Monitored SLR. Regardless of SLR identification 
(Critical SLR or Monitored SLR), the Contractor shall perform a Root Cause Analysis for 
any  failure  to  attain  an  SLR.  The  Root  Cause  Analysis  will  include  actions  and  target 
completion dates to prevent recurrence of the failure. 

OCA  expects  continuous  improvement  in  the  Contractor’s  provision  of  the  Services.  By 
mutual written agreement, new SLRs may be added to replace or augment existing SLRs 
with  the  objective  of  reflecting  changing  or  new  requirements  and  improvements.  Where 
appropriate,  OCA  expects  to  review  SLRs  at  least  each  Contract  Year  and  OCA  and 
Contractor  may  adjust  the  SLRs  as  needed.  OCA  and  the  Contractor  acknowledge  that 
Critical SLRs have been set to meet OCA’s minimum business requirements, and subject 
to Service Level Reimbursements when a Critical SLR is missed as follows:

Each Service Level Requirement (SLR) set forth in this document identifies key performance measures that will be used to evaluate 
the Contractor’s delivery of the Services. The overriding goal in developing SLRs is to support OCA’s desire to manage the Contractor’s 
Services by monitoring and measuring performance against OCA’s defined SLRs. In no event, unless mutually agreed, will the SLRs 
or the Service Level Reimbursements set forth in Exhibit 3: Service Level Agreement be reduced below the levels at which they are 
set on the Effective Date of the Agreement. 

The SLR component definitions are included in the table below. 

Exhibit 3, Attachment 3-1 
OCA Contract No. 212210180 

Definition 
Identification if the SLR is either Critical or Monitored. 
Description of the mathematical formula used to measure the delivery of a Service against the 
service-level metric. 
Time during which an SLR is to be measured to determine whether the Contractor has exceeded, 
met, or not met the target SLR. For each SLR, the Measurement Period shall commence upon the 
first day of the first month after the go-live of the Early Adopter Clerk's Office, as such event is 
described in the Statement of Work. 
Service-level performance metric for the work that the Agreement requires the Contractor to perform. 
Measurement of the work that the Agreement requires the Contractor to perform, generally 
expressed as a percentage. 
Period of reporting that the Contractor measures the target SLR. 
The specific type of service that is measured (e.g., schedule adherence, time to resolve, time to 
report, availability of system). 
The specific service level requirement that is measured. 
The specific service tower that is measured (e.g., cross-functional, service desk, SaaS). 
The specific service type that is measured (e.g., reporting, incident resolution time, Root Cause 
Analysis, response time, availability, recovery time objective, recovery point objective, disaster 
recovery, downtime, documentation).

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
