exclusion imply disapproval. 

Foreword 

hose suffering with mental health issues, intellectual disabilities, and substance use 

disorders are among the most underserved members of our society. These problems cross all 
racial, religious, and economic lines and necessarily demand our steadfast commitment to 
promoting better care for this population. Everyone has or will come into close contact with a 
person who suffers a mental health issue. 

In January of 2018, the Texas Supreme Court and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals 

joined hands in launching the Judicial Commission on Mental Health to assist these members of 
our society through collaboration, education, and implementation of services for appropriate 
care. 

But in a state with 254 counties, resources are stretched thin and, in rural counties, are 

often non-existent. Also, solutions have long been pondered as to the direction we take in 
dealing with persons in the criminal justice system who might be better served through 
alternatives to incarceration. Civil commitment processes beg for uniformity and additional 
funding.  

The issues are many, the population diverse and immense. It is commendable that 

programs and cooperative efforts to address mental health and substance use disorders needs 
are on the rise, but there remain so many questions to answer and problems to resolve.  

While this book is by no means a complete compilation of all the resources available in 

Texas, we have begun to gather as many resources as we can with a mind that this will be a 
living document to be continuously updated. We have included all types of programs and 
facilities from governmental agencies and organizations to private practitioners and all those in 
between in a combined effort to assist those in need. 

I invite anyone and everyone to continue to send us any information or resources to add 

to our book for the future benefit of those with mental health issues. Not only will the person 
suffering from these issues benefit from the sharing of these resources, but all those affected 
will benefit as well. It is my hope that, as resources are expanded across the state, we will all 
share in reshaping our approach to mental health.

Co-Chair, Judicial Commission on Mental Health

Explanation of Mental Health Services 

Crisis Services and Facilities 

Crisis Hotline: Provides information, support, referrals, screening, and intervention services 
24/7.  

obile Crisis Outreach Teams (MCOT): Provides immediate response to the location where a 
psychiatric crisis is occurring. MCOT is available 24/7 and mental health professionals respond 
to calls from the home, school, street, or clinic.  

risis Intervention, Relapse Prevention, and Follow-Up: Provides services to individuals who 
are not in imminent danger of harm to self or others, but require additional assistance to avoid 
reoccurrence of the crisis event. Mental health professionals respond to crises to reduce 
symptoms and prevent admission of an individual to a more restrictive environment.  

risis Respite: Provides short-term, community-based crisis care for individuals who have low-
risk of harm to themselves or others, but may have some functional impairment. This is the least 
intensive, facility-based crisis option. Services occur outside of a person’s home and may be 
provided for a few hours or a few days. Many people served in these programs have 
experienced an event causing significant distress, are having housing challenges, or have loved 
ones/caretakers who are seeking temporary support or supervision for the individual. Facility-
based crisis respite services have trained staff on-site 24/7.  

risis Residential: Provides up to 14 days of short-term, community-based residential, crisis 

treatment for individuals who may pose some risk of harm to themselves or others, have a 
severe impairment in their ability to function, and demonstrate a psychiatric crisis that cannot be 
stabilized in a less intensive setting. This is a more intensive, facility-based crisis option with 
trained staff on-site 24/7.  

sychiatric Emergency Service Center (PESC): Provides a combination of facility-based crisis 
care services, such as those listed above. PESCs must be 7 available for walk-ins and provide 
immediate access to assessment, triage and a continuum of stabilizing treatment for individuals 
experiencing a behavioral health crisis. PESCs are staffed by medical personnel and mental 
health professionals and provide care 24/7.  

xtended Observation Unit (EOU): Provides emergency services for up to 48 hours to 
individuals in psychiatric crisis. Services are provided in a secure and protected, clinically 
staffed, psychiatrically supervised environment with immediate access to urgent or emergent 
medical and psychiatric evaluation and treatment. Individuals seeking treatment in an EOU may 
pose a moderate to high-risk of harm to themselves or others. A determination of whether the 
individual has stabilized or requires a psychiatric hospitalization is made prior to the end of the 
48-hour period.  

risis Stabilization Unit (CSU): Provides short-term, residential treatment to reduce acute 

symptoms of mental illness. Although it is slightly less intensive than a full psychiatric 
hospitalization, this is one of the most intensive facility-based crisis options.

Rapid Crisis Stabilization Bed: Provides very brief stays in licensed psychiatric hospitals to 
relieve acute symptoms and restore an individual’s ability to function in a less restrictive setting.  

esidential Treatment Center (RTC): Provides 24-hour care for children younger than 18 years 

of age and may offer programmatic services such as transitional living or emergency care, or 
may offer treatment services for emotional disorders or primary medical needs. An RTC is a 
type of General Residential Operation that serves only children needing treatment services for 
emotional disorders. Specialized RTC initiative implemented through a partnership between 
HHSC and DFPS provides an intensive service alternative for children/youth at risk for parental 
relinquishment of custody due to a lack of mental health resources. Youth reside in these 
facilities an average of six to nine months. Children between 5 and 17 years of age needing this 
service must be referred by DFPS Child Protective Services (CPS) following a CPS 
investigation resulting in “no finding” of abuse or neglect by the parent/guardian. LMHAs/LBHAs 
provide families help to complete the RTC “Common Application” and assessment for eligibility 
to an RTC.  

aco Center for Youth Residential Treatment Center: A state-operated, psychiatric residential 

treatment facility that serves adolescents 13 to 17 years of age with significant or severe 
emotional difficulties and/or behavioral problems. This is a unique facility that serves 
approximately 70 youth from across the state and is located in Waco. Applications for the Waco 
Center for Youth are facilitated by the respective LMHA/LBHA. Contact: Admissions Coordinator 
254-745-5399, or Admissions/Aftercare Assistant 254-745-5302.

and LBHAs that is specifically designed for adults who have difficulty avoiding repeated 
admissions or long stays in inpatient psychiatric facilities. ACT provides a full array of intensive, 
in-home services and utilizes person-centered recovery planning to help these individuals 
achieve stability and facilitate community living.

three or more years (cumulative or consecutive) during the five years prior to enrollment 
(including days of forensic inpatient commitments); (b) was arrested four or more times and 
experienced a severe psychiatric crisis during the three years prior to enrollment; or had fifteen 
or more emergency department visits and experienced a severe psychiatric crisis during the 
three years prior to enrollment. Additionally, an individual must be eligible for Medicaid and meet 
specific functional criteria to receive HCBS-AMH services. The HCBS-AMH program has funds 
available to serve a small number of 9 indigent individuals, who are not eligible for Medicaid and 
have resided in an inpatient psychiatric hospital for three or more years. The HCBS-AMH 
program provides an array of services, appropriate to each individual’s needs, to enable 
individuals to live and experience recovery in his or her community. Individuals can be referred 
to the program through their LMHA or LBHA. For more information on the services available 
through HCBS-AMH and where the program is available, visit 
https://hhs.texas.gov/services/mental-health-substance-use.  

edication and Medication Training: Physicians (and people who assist physicians, such as 

nurse practitioners and physician assistants) assess whether medications would help adults and 
children address symptoms, achieve stability, and ultimately recover. Physicians also work with 
treatment teams to provide education and guidance about these medications and their possible 
side effects.  

eer Services and Supports: Peer providers share their experience related to recovery; act as a 
model of hope and resilience to others; provide education, training, and interventions within the 
recovery process; and promote integration with community resources. Peer providers have 
experienced mental illness, which makes them uniquely able to promote wellness, recovery, 
and an independent life in the community. Peer support is available at the LMHA and LBHA as 
part of the HCBS-AMH program.

LBHAs and builds upon case management and rehabilitation services to help people choose, 
obtain, and maintain regular, long-term integrated housing. This service is available to all who 
demonstrate housing needs.

as part of the overall treatment planning process to facilitate recovery.  

ubstance Use Disorder Services: LMHAs and LBHAs work closely with OSARs to help people 
with issues related to substance use. Regardless of their ability to pay, Texas residents seeking 
substance use disorder services and information may qualify for services based on need. For a

outreach to these individuals, and connect them with mainstream services. There are currently 
16 PATH providers in the State of Texas, covering 15 geographic locations. PATH also serves 
individuals involved in the criminal justice system who meet eligibility criteria.  

outh Empowerment Services (YES): The YES program serves youth 3 through 18 years of 

age by providing services in a child’s home and local community to children who would

eligible for Medicaid and meet specific requirements to receive services. Parental income is not 
included in financial eligibility determinations for Medicaid when the youth is determined eligible

Yes Waiver – Wraparound Services  
The YES Waiver is a 1915(c) Medicaid program that provides comprehensive home and 
community-based mental health services to children and youth between the ages of 3 and 18, 
up to their 19th birthday, who have a Serious Emotional Disturbance (SED). The YES Waiver 
provides flexible supports and specialized services to children and youth who are at risk of 
institutionalization and/or out-of-home placement due to their SED. 
The YES Waiver utilizes a Wraparound model for the planning process. A team comprised of 
formal and non-formal supports is created by the child and family to help to identify their 
strengths, needs and vision, and the team determines what YES Waiver services are needed to 
help address the child or youth’s SED. YES Waiver services include:  
• Respite  
• Community Living Supports  
• Specialized Therapies  
• Family Supports  
• Employee Assistance and Supported Employment  
• Adaptive Aids and Supports  
• Minor Home Modifications 
 • Non-Medical Transportation  
• Paraprofessional Services  
• Supportive Family-Based Alternatives 
 • Transition Services 
If a child is interested in the YES Waiver, their Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) must 
call their Local Mental Health Authority’s (LMHA) YES Waiver Inquiry Line to schedule an 
assessment. To find more information about Children’s Mental Health Services, please visit:

Texas Juvenile Justice Department 

The Texas Juvenile Justice Department is the state agency that funds 161 probation 
departments that encompass all 254 counties in Texas, and five Texas Juvenile Justice 
Department sites for youth who are sent to juvenile justice residential facilities.  
The Probation and Community Services Division works with probation departments across the 
state to enhance the many services offered to the local youth. By facilitating quality interaction 

23 

     

between juvenile boards and juvenile probation departments and the various divisions within 
TJJD we can work together in all areas of juvenile justice.  
This partnership encourages participation from all departments. TJJD understands the wide 
diversity in the many departments across Texas; the Probation and Community Services 
Division recognizes this also and serves as a resource for innovative approaches when problem 
solving. As a liaison between the Department and the field, the Probation and Community 
Services Division will to be a resource for the continued success of the departments and TJJD. 
Other Departments within the Probation and Community Services Division:  
• Interstate Compact for Juveniles (ICJ) – Texas students who are on supervision in other 
states;  
• Juvenile Justice Alternative Education Program – 32 programs that serve students who have 
been expelled from their school districts;  
• Placement Services & Title IV-E Program – oversees the Title IV-E Program for youth 
supervised by county juvenile probation departments and those committed to the Texas 
Juvenile Justice Department (TJJD). Title IV-E is a federal foster care reimbursement program 
which allows probation departments and TJJD to claim reimbursement for a percentage of the 
cost of placement for eligible youth placed in approved IV-E facilities as well as administrative 
costs related to operating the program.  
• Prevention and Intervention Services - TJJD is committed to helping youth become productive, 
responsible, and lawful citizens by funding programs and services for students and their 
families, intended to prevent or intervene in at-risk behaviors that lead to delinquency, truancy, 
dropping out of school, or referral to the juvenile justice system.  
• Special Needs Diversionary Program - The Special Needs Diversionary Program (SNDP) was 
created in 2001 to provide mental health treatment and specialized supervision in order to 
rehabilitate juvenile offenders and prevent them from penetrating further into the criminal justice 
system. The program is administered in a collaborative model by the Texas Juvenile Justice 
Department (TJJD) and the Texas Correctional Office on Offenders with Medical and Mental 
Impairments (TCOOMMI).

Disability Rights Texas  
Protection and advocacy agencies (P&As) were created in the early 1970s, following a media 
investigation of Willowbrook, a New York State institution for children with mental disabilities. 
The press exposed deplorable conditions and inhumane treatment of residents at the 
government-run institution. In response, Congress passed legislation in 1975 designating an 
organization within each state to protect and advocate for the rights of people with disabilities. 
Disability Rights Texas opened its doors in 1977 with the mission of helping people with 
disabilities understand and exercise their rights under the law, ensuring their full and equal 
participation in society. For more information regarding services they provide,

The approach fosters belonging over exclusion, social engagement over control, and 
meaningful accountability over punishment. It is a trauma-informed practice. Integrating Positive 
and Restorative Practices to Supporting Student Behavior is a training available at the 20 ESCs 
that has been designed to help schools develop RD practices within a Positive Behavior 
Interventions and Supports (PBIS) framework.

Texas Behavior Support Network (TBS)  
The goal of the Texas Behavior Support (TBS) Network is to create a system of PBIS for 
students with disabilities and all students attending Texas public schools. Although the original 
focus of TBS was to support the behavior needs of students with disabilities, it quickly became 
evident in examining the newly expanding Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support (PBIS) 
model that in order to address the needs of children in special education, prevention 
interventions had to be implemented for all students. Therefore, the TBS Network adopted PBIS 
as its philosophical foundation and supports all three tiers of the model, including school-wide 
and classroom.

TRAUMA-Informed Practices for Schools  
Below are links to a selection of state and national resources that provide information on the 
impact of trauma on learning. Research has found that adverse childhood experiences 
negatively impact child development tasks, self-regulation, coping and other important skills 
which subsequently impact learning. Some of the resources document the positive prevention 
benefits on factors such as improved school discipline when implementing whole-school 
supports that build resilience and provide protective factors in the school environment. Other 
resources describe interventions that are specifically designed and effective for supporting 
traumatized children. Data reveals that through a mix of trauma-informed practices and

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
