FOREW0RD

I worked for a time as the Deputy Director for the American Bar Association’s 

Center for Innovation. As a former public defender, what I saw was shocking: 

artificial intelligence, chatbots, design thinking, data analytics, blockchain—a 

glimpse at what the legal profession might be.

At my public defender office, we hadn’t had enough phones for every attorney, 

we punched out briefs using outdated versions of WordPerfect, and drudged up 

criminal histories using MS-DOS, a technology now 30 years past its prime.

For some, the word innovation strikes fear. It smacks of risky invention or, 

worse, costly fads. I am neither a technophile nor a technophobe. Rather, as my 

father is fond of saying, I want the right tool for the right job. Each of these—AI, 

telephones, blockchain, word processors—is just a tool. But, as anyone who’s 

felled a tree with both a handsaw and a chainsaw can tell you, tools matter. The 

right tool can make us more effective, more efficient.

Public defenders’ tools are outdated. We practice much the same as we did 

when Gideon was decided. Indeed, it’s worse than that. Some basic tools have 

rusted. Many attorneys no longer investigate, research, visit clients in jail, or 

draft motions.

an embarrassment.

With so much at stake—no less than life and liberty—our collective failure is  

Since my stint at the ABA Center for Innovation, I’ve returned to public defense. 

Along with my Texas Indigent Defense Commission colleagues and coauthors, 

Scott Ehlers, Claire Buetow, and Morgan Shell, I’ve tried to catalog some of the 

innovations in public defense.  Our aim is simple: expose defenders to new tools 

in hopes that we might do a better job. We hope you enjoy researching these 

tools as much as we did.

SEAMLESS   
CLIENT 
COMMUNICATION 

Ongoing, confidential client communication is critical to 

effective representation. But time and distance sometimes 

make it difficult for attorneys and clients to connect. New 

technologies—including videoconferencing, automated 

calling, and texting—are now making it easier for lawyers 

to communicate with their clients.

VIDE OCONFERENCING

There is no substitute for in-person client communication. 

But, especially in rural areas, frequent in-person 

communication can be challenging. TIDC has worked with 

several counties, including Taylor County most recently, 

to implement videoconferencing so that attorneys and 

incarcerated clients can talk regularly. This supplement to 

in-person communication saves time and money, while 

ensuring that client communication remains a core part of 

defense representation.

Since 2003, TIDC has 
awarded discretionary 
grants to over 20 counties 
for videoconferencing 
technology that remotely 
connects attorneys, 
clients, and courts. 
Counties can apply for 
videoconferencing grants 
through a simplified 
“menu option.” 

TIDC also provides

C O NTRA  COSTA  PUB LIC  DEF ENDE RS 

Proceedings in Contra Costa County, California were routinely delayed 

by defendants missing court dates: nearly 57% of defendants cited and 

released failed to appear (FTA) at their initial court dates. To help combat 

this problem, Contra Costa Public Defenders partnered with Uptrust, 

which provides two-way texting services to connect attorneys and clients. 

Anecdotally, offices that have switched to text reminders have seen FTA 

rates drop to 2.5%. A full study of the program is underway.

In another study, the University of Chicago Crime Lab found that simple text 

reminders in New York City reduced FTAs by 26%. Counties in Washington, 

Arizona, Colorado, and Oregon have also used court reminders to lower FTA 

rates. Texas counties are now piloting similar programs.

 

Since 2003 TIDC 
has been awarding 
discretionary grants for 
videoconferencing 
technology that remotely 
connects attorneys, 
clients, and courts.

Digital communication 

instantly connects remote 
attorneys to clients which

Renowned surgeon Dr. Atul Gawande studied why people 

often die from surgery. He found that basic tasks, like washing 

with soap, were the cause of death in more than half of the 

cases. As procedures become more complex, people forget 

small but important details. He argues that there is a low-cost, 

low-tech solution to this modern problem: checklists. In his 
book, The Checklist Manifesto, Dr. Gawande illustrates how 

major industries have used concise, step-by-step instructions 

to save lives and money.

STAY ING  ORG ANIZED

In law, checklists have helped attorneys interview clients, 

research issues, and draft arguments. In fast-paced, high-

stakes environments, like emergency rooms or courtrooms, 

checklists prevent critical mistakes. They’re also useful 

to supervisors, who can review checklists to see gaps in 

performance at a glance.

S AN  F RANCISCO  PUBLIC DE FE NDE R

Public defenders often represent many clients and manage dozens of 

complex cases at a time. Some have developed checklists to ensure 

that each person accused of a crime receives a thorough defense.

The San Francisco Public Defender pioneered defender checklists. It has 

created over 100 of them, including checklists for conducting the initial 

client meeting, drafting a motion to suppress, and preparing the client 

for testimony. 

In 2013, they received funding from the U.S. Department of Justice to partner with the Center for 

Court Innovation on a pilot study of checklist implementation. They developed a toolkit to assist 

other defender organizations to create checklists for their own jurisdictions.

INCREASIN G 
ACCESS THRO UGH 
TECHNO LOGY 

Court processes are often technical and obscure. That’s why legal 

counsel is so important. Yet some legal work remains consistent 

from case to case. By automating certain tasks, defendants can 

more easily get the guidance they need, and attorneys can do 

more with less.

Attorneys of all kinds now use document automation to generate 

routine legal filings instead of redrafting documents for every case. 

Pro se litigants also use online tools to fill out basic legal documents 

and administrative forms. Automated advice connects people to 

courts, saving time and money for attorneys, clerks, and the public.

The ExpungementGenerator is a web app created by Michael Hollander, an attorney at 

Community Legal Services of Philadelphia and a software engineer. The program reads court 

records to determine which cases can be expunged, and then generates a petition. Using the 

app, attorneys and law clerks save over an hour per expungement petition. The year after the 

app launched, expungement petition filings doubled, and 92% of the petitions generated by 

the app were granted.

FAMILY &   
FRIEND S   
CAN HELP 

Participatory defense invites family and friends of those accused 

of a crime to help with their defense. Family members are often 

the best historians and are dedicated to recounting personal 

history to help mitigate a loved one’s sentence.

Raj Jayadev, creator of the 

participatory defense model, trains 

local and national organizations to run 

participatory defense and community 

outreach programs. These programs 

offer a support system for families 

and friends and train them to aid 

defense attorneys. Workshops 

include lessons on delivering 

testimony and soliciting letters of

support from key witnesses, as well 

as creating social biography videos.

Participatory defense can help supplement an overwhelmed 

criminal justice system. As the Chief Public Defender of 

Montgomery County, Pennsylvania noted, “Public defenders 

are overworked already. We have to show them that it helps the 

client, but it also helps the lawyer.” Nationally, the program has 

cut over 3,350 years from prison sentences.

U S ING SO CIAL  BI OGRAP HY  VI DEOS TO HUMANIZE CLIENTS

“I just wish they knew him like we know him.” A defendant’s personal history is sometimes 

sidelined from the decision-making process. Social biography videos allow judges and juries 

to walk in defendants’ shoes—seeing their home and work, learning how they grew up, and 

meeting who will be waiting for them when they get out.

Jayadev’s Albert Cobarrubias Justice Project (ACJP) trains public defenders on storytelling 

and teaches them how to produce and integrate social biographies into mitigation. The videos 

have proved useful in reducing charges and lowering sentences. As one Alabama federal 

defender noted, “I am absolutely amazed at how effective and powerful the video can be in 

such a short amount of time. I’m also convinced that this is the future of sentencing.” ACJP 

has conducted training with the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association and anticipates 

training the Harris County Public Defender’s Office.

SAVING MONEY, 
PROTECTING 
RIGHTS

Lack of early representation puts defendants at a disadvantage 

that is often difficult and costly to correct later. Providing immediate 

representation to arrestees benefits not only individuals, but counties 

and communities as well.

MO DE L  PROGRAM:   

BE X AR COUNTY REPRESENTATION AT 

MAG ISTRATION 

The Bexar County Public Defender Office’s (BCPDO) representation 

of arrestees with mental illness at magistration is one of the first of 

its kind in Texas. Representing this vulnerable population early in 

the process is critical to facilitating treatment and release. Prompt 

diversion reduces jail costs and recidivism, improving outcomes for 

persons will mental illness. 

Within its first year, BCPDO saw a 150% increase in defendants 

released on personal bonds. BCPDO clients were released on 

mental health personal bonds 20% more often than unrepresented 

defendants. As County Judge Nelson Wolff noted, “This is one more 

positive step toward properly caring for the mentally ill population 

who all too often end up in the criminal justice system.”

First Defense Legal Aid (FDLA) provides arrestees in the Chicago Police Department with a “free 

lawyer, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.” Through a 24-hour 

hotline, arrestees can reach an FDLA volunteer attorney or law 

student who will meet them at the police station. Attorneys 

can help protect against self-incrimination and prevent 

unnecessary detention of those unable to post bail. Since its 

inception, arrestees’ requests for stationhouse representation 

have increased 15%. FDLA’s success led to Cook County 

incorporating early representation into its public defender 

office. Cook County Chief Judge Timothy Evans helped 

institutionalize stationhouse representation to “ensure that 

constitutional rights are protected from the earliest point of 

contact with the criminal justice system.”

ACCOUNTABI LITY 
THROU GH D IALOGUE 

Restorative justice focuses on repairing injuries caused by 

criminal offenses and addressing the underlying reasons for 

defendants’ actions. By creating a platform for defendants and 

victims of crime to speak to each other and determine tangible 

ways to repair harm done, restorative-justice-based programs 

increase victim satisfaction, encourage accountability, and 

reduce recidivism, creating safer communities.

MO DE L  PROGRAM: 

COLORADO RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PILOT PROGRAM

In 2013, Colorado State Representative Pete Lee spearheaded 

a successful bipartisan restorative justice bill establishing four 

prefiling diversionary pilot programs for juveniles charged with 

certain low-level offenses. During the program, kids speak face-

to-face with their victims, working out a plan of action to repair 

the harm done to the victim and the community. 

Participants in the pilot program were overwhelmingly satisfied. 

A 2017 report indicated a statistically significant increase 

in youth accountability after completing the program, and 

preliminary data showed low rates of recidivism for juveniles 

more than one year out of the program.

BETTER   
DEFENSE, 
STRO NGER 
COMMUNITIES 

Comprehensive defense looks beyond a criminal case to the 

root causes of criminal behavior. Too often, mental illness, 

substance abuse, or poverty drive recidivism. A comprehensive 

defense team, led by an attorney, brings together specialists like 

caseworkers and civil legal aid attorneys to identify and address 

these underlying issues. With the support of team members’ 

investigation and case planning, defense attorneys can focus on 

their area of expertise: legal advocacy.

IDE NTIFYING ALTERNATIVES

Communities increasingly provide alternatives to incarceration 

through support services like counseling and treatment. 

Comprehensive defense directs people to these resources and 

serves as a critical link between these programs and the populations 

they are designed to serve. 

In a comprehensive model, the client is an active participant in the 

defense team. The unique relationship between defenders and their 

clients—voluntary, confidential, and trust-based—is what makes 

defense teams especially effective in motivating defendants and 

helping them succeed in rehabilitative programs in their communities.

RELATIONSHIPS 

Traditional law school training fails to equip attorneys with the skills 

needed to provide effective representation. Most new lawyers start 

their own practice, learning through trial and error. This approach 

doesn’t guarantee attorneys learn how to provide competent 

representation. Mentoring programs can help.

The relationship is symbiotic—mentees gain knowledge and

back to the profession. Mentoring programs increase the number 

of attorneys eligible for appointment without sacrificing quality 

in the process. The National Legal Aid & Defender Association 

has studied TIDC-funded mentoring programs and found 

that they “offer an accelerated path to becoming an indigent 

defense attorney for those who wish to take criminal defense 

appointments but struggle to gain the requisite trial experience.”

TAKING THE 
GUESSWORK OUT 
OF CASELOADS

Excessive caseloads prevent even the most highly qualified 

lawyers from delivering effective legal representation. 

Attorneys saddled with too many cases must jettison core legal 

tasks—client communication, investigation, legal research—in 

violation of constitutional and ethical duties.

In its evaluation of the Harris County Public Defender, the Council 

of State Governments found that “the key to sustaining quality 

defense work is to ensure that caseloads remain manageable.” 

Workload standards do just that. 

WORKLOAD STUDIES AS A SOLUTION

Workload studies have risen as a forceful tool in fighting 

excessive workloads. As Dean Norman Lefstein writes in his 
seminal book, Securing Reasonable Caseloads, “The goal of 

a weighted caseload study is to determine the amount of time, 

on average, that defense lawyers need to provide effective and 

competent representation to their clients.” Workload studies in 

Missouri, Louisiana, Rhode Island, and Texas have been used 

to improve indigent defense through education, legislation, and 

case refusal.

The State of Texas has completed workload studies in three 

areas: appeals, juvenile, and felonies and misdemeanors. Using

BETTER 
MANAGEMENT, 
BETTER 
COORDINATION 

Errors and delays in criminal justice information sharing can 

cause cases to drag on and costs to spiral. When agencies go 

paperless, they can improve the accuracy of their information 

and the speed with which they collect and transmit it. When 

multiple agencies share this information electronically using 

integrated systems, these benefits multiply.

Indigent Defense Program

The Texas Conference of Urban Counties developed its nonprofit 

TechShare program to streamline criminal justice processes. 

Through TechShare, counties pool the cost of switching to 

modern justice data systems. TechShare’s indigent defense 

application, developed in partnership with TIDC, automates and 

standardizes attorney appointment and payment processes, and 

seamlessly connects county offices. It not only improves local 

oversight, but greatly simplifies state reporting duties.

TechShare is just one example of online case management. Public and private defender offices 

around the country, including in Lubbock, Harris, and Collin Counties, use defenderData™ for 

case tracking, billing, and document storage. Some indigent defense programs, like that in 

Travis County, have created custom systems tailored to their local standards and needs, but 

adaptable to other jurisdictions. No matter the model, data systems often increase accountability 

and efficiency.

In 2015, Wisconsin State Public Defender (SPD) partnered with the University

created an automatic data feed from courts to public defenders.

SPD assigns private attorneys to around 40% of indigent defense cases in 

Wisconsin. Now that it has access to court data, SPD can monitor private 

and public attorneys’ caseloads, assess their performance, and quickly 

make assignments and payments.
