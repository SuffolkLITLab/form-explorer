      <pre>Instructions for Applying to the Court for a Waiver 
of Parental Notification and Consent (Form 1A) 

our situation and the law 

n  abortion  in  Texas  is  available  only  if  a  doctor,  in  the  exercise  of  reasonable 
medical  judgment,  determines  that  you  have  a  life-threatening  physical  condition 
aggravated by, caused by, or arising from your pregnancy that places you at risk of 
death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of one of your major bodily 
functions unless the abortion is performed or induced. 

f  you  are  younger  than  18  and  have  not  been  legally  “emancipated,”  you  are 
“unemancipated,” which means that you are legally under the custody or control of your 
parents  (or  one  of  your  parents),  a  managing  conservator,  or  a  guardian.  (A  “managing 
conservator”  is  an  adult  or  agency  appointed  by  a  court  to  have  custody  or  control  of 
you.) 

f you are pregnant, unemancipated, and younger than 18, you cannot get an abortion in 
Texas unless: 

   your doctor informs one of your parents or your managing conservator or guardian at 
least 48 hours before the abortion and obtains the consent of your  parent, managing 
conservator, or guardian; or 

   a judge issues an order that “waives” or removes the requirement that you must let a 
parent or your managing conservator or guardian know about your  planned abortion 
and obtain his or her consent to it. 

ow to get a waiver of parental notification and consent 

ill out the application 

o  get  a  court  order  waiving  the  requirements  that  you  tell  a  parent  or  your  managing 
conservator or guardian about your planned  abortion and obtain his or her consent,  you 
must  complete  Forms  2A  and  2B,  Confidential  Application  for  Waiver  of  Parental 
Notification.  Form  2A  is  the  “Cover  Page”  for  the  Application;  it  requests  basic 
information  about  why  you  are  seeking  the  order.  Form  2B  is  the  “Verification  Page,” 
which requests information about you. 

n the Verification Page, you will be asked to tell the court how you may be contacted 
quickly and confidentially. It is very important that you provide this information because 
the  court  may  later  need  to  contact  you  about  your  application.  If  you  cannot  be 
contacted, your application will be denied. You may list a phone number, email address, 
or  any  other  way  that  you  can  be  contacted.    You  can  but  need  not  give  your  own 
number—instead, you can ask the court to contact you through someone who is helping

you or acting on your behalf. You may also list a second person who may be contacted on 
your behalf. 

ou or someone acting on your behalf must deliver the forms to the clerk in the district 
court, county court at law, county court, or probate court to be filed. The court clerk can 
help  you  complete  and  file  the  application,  and  can  help  you  get  a  hearing  on  your 
request. However, the clerk cannot give you legal advice or counsel you about abortion. 

ll of the information you put on the application is confidential. You do not have to pay a 

fee to file this application. 

our hearing 

he  court  will  tell  you  when  to  come  to  the  courthouse  for  your  “hearing.”  In  your 
hearing,  you  will  meet  with  a  judge  to  discuss  your  request.  The  court  will  hold  your 
hearing  within  five  days  (not  counting  weekends  and  holidays)  after  you  file  your 
application. 

fter you file your application, the court will appoint a person to meet with you before 
the hearing and help the judge decide your application. The person is called a “guardian 
ad litem.” In your application you may ask the court to appoint someone you want to be 
your  guardian  ad  litem  (who  can  be  a  relative,  clergy,  counselor,  psychiatrist  or 
psychologist, or other adult), but the court is not required to appoint this person. 

ou must also have a lawyer with you at your hearing. You may hire your own lawyer, 

or you may ask the court to appoint one to represent you for free.  

eeping it confidential 

our hearing will be confidential and private. The only persons allowed to be there are 
you, your guardian ad litem, your lawyer, court staff, and any person whom you request 
to be there. 

ou already know that your application stays confidential. So will everything from your 
hearing:  all  testimony,  documents  and  other  evidence  presented  to  the  court,  and  any 
order given by the judge. The court will keep everything sealed. No one else can inspect 
the evidence. 

he court’s decision 

he court must “rule”—issue a decision on your application—before 5 p.m. on the fifth 

day after the day you filed your application, not counting weekends and holidays. 

f the court fails to rule within that time, then your request is automatically denied. You 
can get a certificate from the court clerk that says that your request is “deemed denied.” If

Page 2 of 4 

you  choose  to  appeal,  the  certificate  will  be  sent  to  the  appellate  court  to  explain  what 
happened in your case. 

f the court does rule within the required time, the court issues an order that does one of 
the following three things: 

approves  your  request  because  the  court  finds  that  you  are  mature  enough  and 
know enough to choose on your own to have an abortion; 

approves your request because it is in your best interests not to notify or to attempt 
to  obtain  the  consent  of  your  parent  or  your  managing  conservator  or  guardian 
before getting the abortion; or 

3) 

denies your request because the court does not find (1) or (2). 

f  you  say,  or  if  there  is  evidence,  that  you  have  been  or  may  be  sexually  abused,  the 
court must treat your claim as a very serious matter and may be required to refer it to the 
police or other authorities for investigation. 

ppealing the court’s decision 

f  the  court  denies  your  request,  you  may  ask  another  court  to  hear  your  case.  This 
request is called an “appeal,” and the new court will be the court of appeals. 

o appeal the first court’s decision, have your lawyer fill out Form 3A, Notice of Appeal 
in Parental Notification Proceeding. The lawyer must file it with the clerk of the court 
that denied your request for a waiver of parental notification. 

ou will not have to go to the court of appeals in person. Instead, the court of appeals 
will review the written record and will issue a written ruling on your appeal no later than 
5 p.m. on the fifth day after the day you file the Notice of Appeal, not counting weekends 
and holidays. 

he court of appeals will provide its ruling to you, your lawyer, your guardian ad litem, 

or any other person designated by you to receive the ruling. 

he same guardian ad litem and lawyer who helped you with your first hearing can help 

with your appeal.

ad litem. This person  could be a relative, a  member of the clergy, a counselor, a 
psychiatrist or psychologist, or another adult. You do not have to ask the court to 
appoint someone you know. Keep in mind that the court may appoint the person 
you request, but it does not have to. 

_  I  am  requesting  that  the  court  appoint  someone  I  know  as  my  guardian  ad 

litem. (You will identify this person on your verification page.)

Parental Notification and Consent other than this one with respect to your current
