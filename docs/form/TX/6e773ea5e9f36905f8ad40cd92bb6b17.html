The renewal application and all applicable fees are due on or before the expiration of the 
certification, registration, or license. An application is timely if it is submitted on or before 
its expiration. Failure to submit a renewal application on or before expiration will result 
in  a  lapse  of  the  legal  authority  to  practice  in  accordance  with  the  certification, 
registration, or license. 

In order to renew a certification, registration, or license after its expiration, a regulated 
person must pay late renewal fees as follows: 

If the renewal application is submitted 90 days or less after expiration, the renewal 
fee is one and one-half times the normally required renewal fee; and 

If the renewal application is submitted more than 90 days but less than 1 year after 
expiration, the renewal fee is twice the normally required renewal fee. 

Upon the 1-year anniversary of the expiration of a certification, registration, or license, 
it terminates, becomes permanently invalid, and cannot be renewed. A person; program; 
corporation; partnership; firm; other business entity; local, county, or regional agency; 
or nonprofit entity whose certification, registration, or license is invalid may obtain a 
new  certification,  registration,  or  license  by  fulfilling  all  requirements,  including 
examination,  for  obtaining  an  initial  certification,  registration,  or  license.  A  court 
reporting firm must pay any unpaid renewal fee under (e)(2) for an invalid registration 
in order to obtain a new registration. 

g)  Notwithstanding (f), a person  may renew a certification, registration, or license  1  year 

after expiration or later, if: 

(1) 

the person moved to another state or jurisdiction before applying for renewal; 

the person is certified, registered, or licensed in good standing to engage in the 
practice of the same profession in the other state or jurisdiction; 

the person has been engaged in that practice for a period of at least 1 year preceding 
the date the person applies for renewal; and 

(4) 

the person pays a renewal fee which is twice the normally required renewal fee. 

h)  Any continuing education that is required to be fulfilled as part of the renewal application 
must be completed  prior to the certification, registration, or  license expiration  date to 
avoid payment of a late renewal fee. 

i) 

Notwithstanding  (b)  through  (h),  a  regulated  person  who  fails  to  renew  his  or  her 
certification, registration, or license in a timely manner because the person was on active 
duty  in  the  United  States  armed  forces  serving  outside  this  State  is  exempt  from  any 
increased renewal fee that the person would otherwise be required to pay for failing to 
renew in a timely manner.

(1)  A  regulated  person  who  is  a  member  of  the  state  military  forces  or  a  reserve 
component of the armed forces of the United States, and who is ordered to active 
duty by the proper authority, is entitled to an extension of his or her certification, 
registration, or license period equal to the deployment period and an additional 
amount of time to complete any continuing education requirements and any other 
requirements related to the renewal of the person's certification, registration, or 
license. 

The individual must submit to the Director a written request, accompanied by a 
copy of the orders placing the person on active duty. 

The Director must make the extension based on information in the copy of the 
orders provided. The additional amount of time must be equal to the total number 
of months that the person serves on active duty. 

An individual making a request under this rule must notify the Director of any 
change in the length of deployment. 

A regulated person is exempt from any increased fee or other penalty for failing 
to renew the person's certification, registration, or license in a timely manner if 
the individual furnishes to the Commission satisfactory documentation that the 
individual failed to renew in a timely manner because the individual was on active 
duty in the United States armed forces serving outside this State.

The Commission must refuse to accept a regulated person's application for renewal if 
the Commission receives notice of child support arrearages pursuant to Section 232.0135 
of  the Family Code. Upon  receipt of further  notice that the person  has complied  with 
Section 232.0135(b), the Commission must accept an application for renewal subject to 
all requirements of these rules. 

.3 

Endorsement; Reciprocity 

The Commission may waive any prerequisite to obtaining a certification, registration, or 
license for an applicant after reviewing the applicant's credentials and determining that 
the applicant holds a certification, registration, or license issued by another jurisdiction 
that  has certification, registration, or licensing requirements substantially equivalent to 
those of this State. 

The Commission may waive any prerequisite to obtaining a certification, registration, or 
license for an applicant who holds a certification, registration, or license issued by another 
jurisdiction with which this State has a reciprocity agreement. Subject to the approval of 
the Supreme Court, the Commission may make an agreement with another state to allow 
for certification, registration, or licensing by reciprocity.

military service education, training, and experience earned by a military service member 
or  a  military  veteran  who  applies  for  certification,  registration,  or  licensure.  The 
Commission may withhold credit from a military service member or veteran who holds 
a restricted certification, registration, or license issued by another jurisdiction or has an 
unacceptable criminal history. 

The Commission must expedite applications for certification, registration, and licensure 
which are filed by military service members, military veterans, and military spouses. 

The Commission may issue a certification, registration, or license to an applicant who is 
a military service member, the spouse of a military service member, or a military veteran 
and:

demonstrate  competency  by  alternative  methods  or  credentials  in  order  to  meet  the 
requirements for obtaining a particular certification, registration, or license issued by the 
Commission.  For  purposes  of  this  Section,  the  standard  methods  of  demonstrating 
competency  are  the  specific  exam,  education,  and  experience  required  to  obtain  a 
particular certification, registration, or license. 

In  lieu  of  the  standard  methods  of  demonstrating  competency  for  a  particular 
certification,  registration,  or  license  and  based  on  the  applicant's  circumstances, the 
alternative methods for demonstrating competency may include any combination of the 
following as determined by the Commission:

verification that the military spouse is certified, registered, or licensed in good 
standing in another jurisdiction that has certification, registration, or licensing 
requirements

rights  and  privileges  and  subject  to  all  the  obligations  and  responsibilities  of  a 
regulated  person,  and  may  be  sanctioned  or  disciplined  in  the  same  manner  as  a 
regulated person. 

3)   Written  authorization  to  engage  temporarily  in  a  regulated  practice  without

Eligibility for Persons with Criminal History 

An initial or renewal application may be denied, and a regulated person may be disciplined, 
if the person's criminal history or other information indicates that the person lacks the 
honesty,  trustworthiness, or  integrity  to hold  the certification, registration,  or  license. 
After consultation with the appropriate advisory boards, the Commission will develop 
and publish on its website guidelines for each regulatory program listing the categories 
of crimes that are considered to indicate that a person lacks the honesty, trustworthiness, 
or integrity to hold the particular certification, registration, or license. The Director will 
determine whether an initial or renewal application will be denied under this rule using 
the guidelines developed by the Commission and the factors listed in (b). If the Director 
denies  an  application,  the  applicant  may  request  that  the  Commission  reconsider  the 
decision under Rule 3.6.

b) 

In making a determination under (a), the Commission or Director may consider:  

the nature and seriousness of the crime; 

 

the  extent  to  which  certification,  registration,  or  licensing  might  offer  an 
opportunity to engage in further criminal activity of the same type as that in which 
the person previously had been involved; 

the relationship of the crime to the ability, capacity, or fitness required to perform 
the duties and discharge the responsibilities of the occupation; 

the extent and nature of the person's past criminal activity; 

the age of the person when the crime was committed; 

the amount of time that has elapsed since the person's last criminal activity; 

the conduct and work activity of the person before and after the criminal activity; 

evidence of the person's rehabilitation or rehabilitative effort while incarcerated 
or after release;

supported his or her dependents; 

C)  maintained a record of good conduct; and 

D) 

paid  all  outstanding  court  costs,  supervision  fees,  fines,  and  restitution 
ordered in any criminal case in which the applicant has been convicted; and 

(10) 

any other evidence of the person's fitness, including, but not limited to, letters of 
recommendation. 

c) 

A person may request that the Commission, through the Director, issue a criminal history 
evaluation letter regarding the person's eligibility for certification or licensure under this 
rule. 

(1) 

The person may request a criminal history evaluation letter if the person: 

is enrolled or is planning to enroll in an educational program that prepares 
a  person  for  an  initial  certification  or  license  or  is  planning  to  take  an 
examination  required  by  the  Commission  for  an  initial  certification  or 
license; and 

has  reason  to  believe  that  the  person  is  ineligible  for  certification  or 
licensing  due  to  a  conviction  or  deferred  adjudication  for  a  felony  or 
misdemeanor offense or other criminal history. 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

(5) 

The request must be in writing and must state the basis for the person's potential 
ineligibility. The requestor must provide the Commission with his or her criminal 
records pursuant to the fingerprinting requirements for the particular certification 
or licensing program. The Commission may request additional information from 
the requestor. 

If the Director determines that a ground for ineligibility does not exist, the Director 
must notify the requestor in writing of the Director's determination on each ground 
of potential ineligibility. 

If the Director determines that the requestor is ineligible, the Director must issue 
a  letter  setting  out  each  basis  for  potential  ineligibility  and  the  Director's 
determination as to eligibility. 

The Director must provide notice under (c)(3) or issue a letter under (c)(4) not later 
than the 90th day after the date the Commission receives the request or, if applicable, 
the Commission receives additional information regarding the request under (c)(2) 
of this rule.

evaluation; or 

(B) 

there is a change in the person's circumstances after the evaluation notice 
or letter is issued. 

Denial of Application; Reconsideration 

Application Review. The Director must review each application and determine whether 
the  applicant  meets  the  Commission's  qualifications  for  the  particular  certification, 
registration, or license. The Director must also determine whether the applicant meets 
the Commission's criminal history eligibility requirements. If a person who has applied 
to be a certified guardian does not clearly meet the experience or education requirements 
in these rules, the Director must consult with members of the Guardianship Certification 
Advisory Board before approving or denying the application. 

b)  Denial of Application. The Director may deny an application only if the applicant fails 
to meet the qualifications set forth in these rules or the Commission's criminal history 
eligibility requirements. The Director must furnish to the applicant a written statement 
that succinctly states the reason for denying the application. 

Request for Reconsideration. Within 20 days of the date of the notice that the Director 
has denied an application, the applicant may request that the Commission reconsider the 
denial.  The  request  must  be  in  writing,  identify each  point  or  matter  about  which 
reconsideration  is  requested,  and  set  forth  the  grounds  for  the  request  for 
reconsideration. 

Reconsideration  Procedure.  The  Commission  must  reconsider  the  request  at  its  next 
meeting and may allow  the applicant  or  other witnesses  to appear at the meeting and 
present  sworn  testimony.  The  Commission  may  limit  the  number  of  witnesses 
appearing and the time allotted for a witness's testimony. 

e) 

Commission  Action  on  Request.  After  reconsidering  a  decision  of  the  Director,  the 
Commission may: 

(1) 

affirm the Director's decision; or 

(2) 

reverse the Director's decision. 

 

 

Final Decision. The Commission must notify the applicant in writing of its decision on 
reconsideration. The Commission's decision is final and may not be appealed. 

Examination Security 

Except as provided in Rule 3.10, when an applicant must take an examination in order 
to obtain a certification or license, the applicant may only use methods of assistance that 
are available to, and authorized for, other persons taking the examination. A person who 
uses or provides unauthorized assistance in connection with an examination violates

the guardian under Section 1203.052(b) of the Estates Code.

Page 21  

(a) 

The Commission may impose an administrative penalty on a person regulated under the 
Act who violates the Act or a rule or standard adopted or order issued under the Act. 

b)  A proceeding imposing an administrative penalty may be combined with a proceeding 

to impose an administrative sanction otherwise imposed under the Act. 

.7 

Amount of Penalty 

a) 

The amount of an administrative penalty  may not exceed $500 for each violation. Each 
day that a violation continues or occurs is a separate violation for purposes of imposing 
a penalty. 

b) 

The amount of the penalty may be based on: 

(l) 

the seriousness of the violation, including the nature, circumstances,  extent, and 
gravity of the violation; 

(2) 

the threat to health or safety caused by the violation; 

(3) 

any previous violations; 

(4) 

the amount necessary to deter a future violation; 

(5)  whether  the  violator  demonstrated  good  faith,  including,  when  applicable, 
whether the violator made good faith efforts to correct the violation; and 

(6) 

any other matter that justice may require. 

.8 

Complaint Filing and Review; Report and Notice of Violation, Penalty, and Sanction 

a) 

A complaint alleging a violation of the Act or Commission rule may be filed by a person 
with personal  knowledge of the alleged  violation, by the staff of the Commission, or a 
court of this State. 

b)  A complainant, other than Commission staff or a court, must use the complaint form 
provided on the Commission's website. The complaint must include the name and contact 
information of the complainant and the respondent, describe the factual basis for  any 
allegations, and include any necessary documentation or other supporting materials or 
information.  The  complaint  must  be  signed  by  the  complainant  and  submitted  to  the 
Commission according to the instructions on the Commission's website. 

Upon receipt of a properly executed complaint, Commission  staff must send a copy of 
the complaint and any attachments to the respondent and direct the respondent to submit 
a written answer to the complaint under penalty of perjury, within 20 days after receipt 
of  the  notice.  The  notice  will  be  sent  to  the  respondent's  last  known  address  in  the 
Commission's  records,  if  applicable.  If  the  respondent  is  a  provisionally  certified 
guardian, Commission staff must also send a copy of the complaint and attachments to the

guardian's  supervisor.  The  respondent  may  request  an  extension  of  time  to  file  an 
answer, but the request must be made before the expiration of the 20-day period. 

The Commission's staff must refer a properly executed complaint and the results of any 
investigation conducted by the staff to a review committee established by the Commission 
and comprised of members of the appropriate advisory board. 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

The review committee must hold at least one meeting to review the complaint and 
answer, make the determination on whether a violation occurred, and impose a 
penalty, a sanction, or both. 

The review committee may hold additional meetings to consider a complaint or 
seek  additional  information,  but  it  has  no  obligation  to  do  so.  The  review 
committee  is  not  an  investigatory  body  and  will  generally  render  its 
determination to the Commission based on the submissions of the complainant 
and the respondent and the information gathered by an Office investigation. 

The  complainant  and  the  respondent  may  attend  the  review  committee's 
meetings. The chair of the review committee may limit the length of comments 
made to the Committee. 

The review committee must state its determination and the imposed penalty or 
sanction, if any, in writing as proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, 
separately stated. 

The review committee must give the respondent written notice by certified mail of its 
determination on whether a violation occurred and of each imposed penalty or sanction, 
if any. The notice will be sent to the respondent's last known address in the Commission's 
records, if applicable. 

f) 

The notice required under (e) must: 

(1) 

include a brief summary of the alleged violation; 

(2) 

state the amount of any penalty; 

(3) 

state any sanction; and 

(4) 

inform the respondent of the respondent's right to a hearing on the occurrence of 
the violation, the amount of the penalty, or the imposition of the sanction. 

g) 

The Director may dismiss complaints that clearly do not allege misconduct, are not within 
the Commission's jurisdiction, or allege misconduct which took place more than five years 
before  the  complaint  was  filed.  The  Director  must  inform  the  Commission  and  the 
complainant of all dismissals made under this rule. No later than 30 days after the date 
of the notice of dismissal, the complainant may request in writing that the Commission 
reconsider the complaint.

.9 

Penalty Paid, Sanction Accepted, or Hearing Requested 

Not later than the 20th day after the date the respondent receives the notice sent under Rule 
5.8(e), the respondent in writing may: 

(1) 

accept the review committee's determination and the penalty or sanction; or 

(2) 

request a hearing on the occurrence of the violation, the imposition or amount of 
the penalty, or the imposition of the sanction. 

If  the  respondent  accepts  the  determination  and  recommended  penalty  or  sanction 
Commission staff will present the review committee's findings of fact, conclusions of law, 
and imposed administrative penalty or sanction to the Commission as an agreed order in 
accordance with Rule 5.14. 

The Commission may accept the agreed order as a final order, revise the order, or remand 
the matter to the review committee for further deliberation. 

The Commission shall give the respondent written notice of its decision under subsection 
(c). If the Commission revised or remanded the agreed order, the respondent may, not later 
than  the  20th  day  after  receipt  of  the  notice,  request  a  hearing  on  the  Commission's 
determination. 

If the respondent does not timely respond to the notice, given pursuant to Rule 5.8(e), of 
the  review  committee's  determination  and  imposed  penalty,  sanction,  or  both,  the 
Commission may issue a default order to approve the review committee's determination 
and accept or revise the review committee's administrative penalty, sanction, or both. 

.10  Notice; Hearing 

If the respondent timely requests a hearing, the Commission must give the parties written 
notice of the hearing that includes the time, place, legal authority, and jurisdiction under 
which the hearing is held and the laws and rules related to the violation. A party may not 
make ex parte communications with any member of the Commission regarding any matter 
relating to the hearing. Any written material or other evidence that is provided to the 
Commission regarding a hearing must be provided to the other party. 

The presiding officer of the Commission may hold prehearing conferences and may issue 
scheduling orders, discovery control plans, orders on motions in limine, and other orders 
to ensure a just and efficient hearing. 

The respondent may appear, testify, present evidence, and respond to questions from the 
Commission at the hearing. The complainant may appear and may testify at the discretion 
of the prosecutor and the presiding officer. 

d)  A party may appear by telephone or videoconference or present the testimony of a witness

by telephone or videoconference according to the procedures below. 

(1)  A party may request to appear by telephone or to present the testimony of a witness 
by telephone, upon timely motion stating the reason for the request, containing the 
pertinent telephone  number, and affirmatively stating that the proposed witness 
will be the same person who appears telephonically at the hearing. A party may 
request to appear by videoconference or to present the testimony of a witness by 
videoconference, upon timely motion stating the reason for the request and the city 
in which the party or witness will be located at the time of the proceeding. A timely 
motion for telephone or videoconference appearance will not be deemed granted 
unless granted by written order of the presiding officer. 

(2) 

The motion is timely if it is filed no later than 10 days before the hearing. The 
presiding officer may grant an exception to this requirement if it clearly appears 
from specific facts shown in writing that compliance with the deadline was not 
reasonably possible and that failure to meet the deadline was not the result of the 
negligence of the party. 

(3)  All  substantive  and  procedural  rights  apply  to  telephone  and  videoconference 
proceedings, subject only to the limitations of the physical arrangement. 

(4)  Documentary evidence to be offered at a telephone or videoconference proceeding 
must be served on all parties and filed with the Commission at least 7 days before 
the proceeding unless the presiding officer, by written order, amends the filing 
deadline. If a party intends to utilize documentary evidence with a witness at a 
telephone or videoconference proceeding, it is the offering party's responsibility 
to ensure that the witness has the document. 

(5) 

For a telephone or videoconference proceeding, the following may be considered 
a failure to appear and grounds for default: 

(A) 

failure to answer the telephone or videoconference line; 

(B) 

failure to free the line for the proceeding; and 

(C) 

failure to be ready to proceed as scheduled. 

At the request of the Commission, at least one member of the applicable advisory board 
complaint review committee may attend the hearing to respond to Commission inquiries 
on the reasons for the advisory board complaint review committee's determination and 
imposed disciplinary action under Rule 5.8(d). 

At the hearing, the Commission must apply the general rules of evidence applicable in 
a district court, except that the Commission may admit and consider any information that 
the Commission determines is relevant, trustworthy, and necessary  for a full and fair 
adjudication and determination of fact or law. The Commission  may establish rules for 
the conduct of the hearing.

The  Commission  will  deliberate  and  announce  its  decision  at  the conclusion  of  the 
hearing. The Commission must make findings of fact and conclusions of law, which may 
be based upon the review committee's written determination, and must promptly issue 
an order on the occurrence of the violation, the amount of any penalty imposed, and the 
imposition  of  any  sanction.  The  Commission  must  serve  the  respondent  and  the 
complainant with a copy of the order by certified mail with return receipt requested or 
by certified mail with electronic return receipt. 

The notice of the Commission's order under (g) must include a statement of the right of 
the respondent to appeal the order under Section 153.058 of the Government Code. 

The complainant and respondent are each responsible for their own costs of preparing 
for and attending the hearing. 

j) 

If the respondent fails to appear at the hearing: 

(1) 

upon proof that notice of the hearing was given to the respondent, the Commission 
may proceed in the respondent's absence; and 

(2) 

the factual allegations in the complaint may be deemed admitted. 

k) 

Proof  that  a  document  was  sent  to  a  party's  last  known  address,  as  shown  by  the 
Commission's records, creates a rebuttable presumption that the document was received. 
The addressee's failure to claim a document that was properly addressed and served is 
insufficient to rebut the presumption. 

.11  Options Following Decision: Pay, Accept, or Appeal 

ot  later  than  the  30th  day  after  the  date  that  the  Commission  issues  an  order  imposing  an 

administrative penalty or sanction, the respondent must: 

(1) 

(2) 

accept the obligation to pay the penalty in accordance with the order or accept the 
sanction; or 

file  an  appeal  of  the  Commission's  order  contesting  the  occurrence  of  the 
violation,  the  imposition  or  amount  of  the  penalty,  or  the  imposition  of  the 
sanction. 

.12  Collection of Penalty 

a) 

If the respondent does not pay the penalty and the enforcement of the penalty is not stayed, 
the Attorney General may sue to collect the penalty and may recover reasonable expenses, 
including attorney's fees, incurred in recovering the penalty. 

b)  A penalty collected under these rules will be deposited in the state treasury in the general 

revenue fund.

.13  Appeal 

A person seeking to appeal an order that imposes a penalty or sanction must submit a 
written appeal of the order to the General Counsel of the Office within 30 days after the 
Commission's order is issued. The General Counsel must promptly forward the appeal 
to a special committee consisting of three Administrative Regional Presiding Judges. 

The committee  will  be chosen  by  the  Presiding  Judges,  but  the  committee  must  not 
include the Presiding Judge for the administrative region in which the appellant resided 
at the time  of  the  decision.  If  the  alleged  violation  involves  a  certified  guardian,  the 
committee must consist of two Regional Presiding Judges and the Presiding Judge of the 
statutory probate courts. 

c) 

The General Counsel must notify the Commission of the filing of an appeal and, upon 
request,  must  make  the  appeal  materials  available  to  the  Commission  or  its  legal 
representative. 

d) 

The appeal must contain: 

(1) 

(2) 

a  copy  of  the  notice  of  the  Commission's  order  with  which  the  appellant  is 
dissatisfied; and 

a  statement  succinctly  explaining  why  the  appellant  is  dissatisfied  with  the 
Commission's decision. 

The Office must adopt rules or policies to ensure that any Office employee who provides 
clerical, administrative, or other direct support to the Commission does not communicate 
regarding the substance of any appeal under this rule with any other Office employee who 
facilitates the appeal process under this rule. The rules or policies must also provide that 
Office employees may communicate  regarding nonsubstantive aspects of appeals, such 
as  to ensure the completeness and accuracy of appeal  materials to be forwarded to the 
special committee. 

Upon receiving notice of an appeal of a disciplinary action imposing a penalty or sanction, 
the Commission must provide to the General Counsel, and the General Counsel must 
submit to the special committee, electronic or paper copies of the complaint and any 
original attachments, any written answer timely submitted by the appellant, notice of the 
Commission's  decision  imposing  a  penalty  or  sanction,  and  any  other documents  or 
written  evidence admitted into the record by the Commission  pertaining to the decision 
complained of on appeal. The Commission staff must provide a copy of these items to 
an appellant upon request, and may charge costs for such copies as set forth in Rule 12.7 
of the Rules of Judicial Administration. 

g)  Absent  approval  by  the  special  committee,  submission  of  materials  other  than  those 
described in (f) is prohibited. The special committee may, in its sole discretion, allow an 
appellant to submit additional  written  materials relating to the appeal. Otherwise, only

  (

  (

the written materials described in (f) will be considered. A request to submit additional 
materials must clearly identify the additional materials for which inclusion is requested. 

The special committee must consider the appeal under an abuse of discretion standard 
of review for all issues except issues involving questions of law. The standard of review 
for issues involving questions of law is de novo. Under either standard, the burden is on 
the appellant to establish that the Commission's decision was erroneous. 

The special committee may consider the appeal without a hearing and may conduct its 
deliberations by any appropriate means. The special committee may, in its sole discretion, 
conduct  a  hearing  and  allow  testimony  from  the  appellant  or  any  other  person  with 
knowledge of the underlying facts relating to the disciplinary action complained of. 

The special committee may confer in writing with a certification, registration, or license 
holder who is in the same profession as the appellant if the special committee provides 
to the appellant: 

(1) 

notice of the special committee's request for information; and 

(2) 

a copy of the certification, registration, or license holder's response. 

k) 

If  the  special  committee  sustains  the  finding  that  a  violation  occurred,  the  special 
committee may: 

(1) 

uphold or reduce the amount of any penalty and order the appellant to pay the full 
or reduced amount of the penalty; and 

(2) 

uphold or reduce any sanction and order the imposition of the sanction. 

If the special committee does not sustain the finding that a violation occurred, the special 
committee must order that a penalty is not owed and that a sanction may not be imposed. 

If the appellant paid the penalty and if the amount of the penalty is reduced or the penalty 
is  not  upheld  by  the  special  committee,  the  special  committee  must  order  that  the 
appropriate amount plus accrued interest be remitted to the appellant not later than the 30th 
day  after  the date  the judgment  of  the special  committee  becomes  final. The  interest 
accrues at the rate charged on loans to depository institutions by the New York Federal 
Reserve Bank. The interest must be paid for the period beginning on the date the penalty 
is paid and ending on the date the penalty is remitted. 

n) 

The  special  committee  must  notify  the  Commission  and  appellant  in  writing  of  its 
decision. No rehearing or further appeal is allowed. 

.14  Disposition by Agreement 

a) 

Any disciplinary matter may be disposed of by agreement, unless precluded by law. The 
agreement  must  be  in  writing  and  may  be  in  the  form  of  a  stipulation,  a  settlement

agreement, or a consent order. 

b) 

The Commission may designate its presiding officer or the Director to adopt or reject an 
agreement. 

c) 

The agreement must: 

(1) 

include proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law; and 

(2) 

be signed by all parties to the agreement and their representatives. 

d)  Upon receipt of the agreement, the Commission or the Director may: 

(1) 

adopt the agreement and issue a final order; 

(2) 

reject the agreement and remand the disciplinary matter for a hearing before the 
Commission; 

(3) 

reject the agreement and order further investigation; or 

(4) 

take such other action as the Commission or the Director find just. 

.15  Alternative Dispute Resolution 

In addition to the procedures under Rule 5.14, the Commission encourages the resolution 
and early settlement of all contested disciplinary matters through voluntary settlement 
procedures. 

b)  At any time after the filing of a complaint against a respondent and before referral to a 
review committee under Rule 5.8(d), the Director may initiate a settlement conference 
on the Director's own motion or at the request of any party. Settlement conferences are 
voluntary. 

c) 

The  Director,  on  behalf  of  Commission  staff,  and  the  respondent  are  the  parties  in  a 
settlement conference. The complainant may also participate as a party in a settlement 
conference at the sole option of the presiding officer. 

d)  A settlement conference may be used to reach agreement about all or a portion of the 
ultimate issues in a disciplinary matter or to reach agreement about how to handle disputed 
matters.  The  parties  may  use  a  mediator  for  a  settlement  conference  or  conduct  the 
settlement conference without a mediator. 

The parties to a settlement conference cannot bind the Commission to any resolution of 
a disciplinary matter pending before the Commission. The presiding officer may appoint 
one  or  more  Commission  members  or  staff  to  attend  the  settlement  conference.  The 
Commission representative must participate in the proceedings in an effort to resolve the 
dispute within the parameters of any instructions received from the Commission and must

  (

recuse themselves from any subsequent hearings or deliberations regarding the case. 

In  the  event  a  settlement  of  some  or  all  of  the  disputed  issues  is  reached  during  the 
settlement conference, the Commission must review the terms of the settlement at the next 
regularly scheduled Commission meeting. The Commission may accept the settlement 
terms, reject the settlement terms and restore all proceedings on the disciplinary matter 
to the status quo as it existed immediately prior to the settlement conference, or refer the 
matter for further negotiation. 

g) 

The parties may agree to retain a mediator to assist with the settlement conference. 

(1) 

The parties must notify the presiding officer in writing of their agreement to retain 
a mediator. That notice must include the name, address, and telephone number 
of  the  mediator  selected;  a  statement  that  the  parties  have  entered  into  an 
agreement with the mediator as to rate and method of his or her compensation; 
and an affirmation that the mediator is qualified to serve. 

(2)  Upon receipt of a properly filed notice under (1), the presiding officer will enter an 

order referring the case to the mediator. 

If the parties do not agree to a mediator, the presiding officer may appoint an individual 
to serve as mediator in the settlement conference. 

An  individual  appointed  to  serve  as  a  mediator  under  (g)  or  (h)  must  meet  the 
qualifications set forth in the Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section 154.052. 

The Commission will not pay any fees or costs associated with a settlement conference 
unless good cause is shown and the Commission and Office agree to do so prior to the 
settlement conference. 

k)  All  communications  in  the  settlement  conference  between  or  among  the  parties,  and 
between each party and mediator, if any, are confidential under the same terms as provided 
in Section 154.053 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Information shared with 
the mediator in separate meetings will not be given to any other party unless the party 
sharing  the  information  explicitly  gives  the  mediator  permission  to  do  so.  Material 
provided to the mediator is not required to be provided to the other parties and will not be 
filed  or  become  a  record  in  the  disciplinary  proceedings.  Notes  taken  during  the 
settlement conference by the parties and the mediator must be destroyed at the end of the 
process. 

Any agreement reached by the parties will be reduced to writing and signed by the parties 
before the end of the settlement conference. These writings may be informal in nature. The 
parties may agree that the written agreement remain confidential if there is no requirement 
of law to the contrary. Any part of the agreement that may affect the disposition of the 
disciplinary proceeding (such as agreements concerning relevant facts) must be filed in 
the record of the disciplinary proceeding.

(m) 

If the parties use a mediator for the settlement conference, the mediator must maintain 
confidentiality  in  accordance  with  Section  2009.054  of  the  Government  Code.  The 
mediator may not communicate to the Commission matters discussed with the parties in 
the settlement conference. The mediator will report to the Commission in writing whether 
the  settlement  conference  resulted  in  a  settlement  of  the  matter  in  dispute,  or  other 
stipulations or matters that the parties agreed be reported. 

Required  Filings.  The  following  documents  must  be  filed  with  the  Commission:  any 
request for the appointment of a mediator, any objection to the referral of the matter to 
a  settlement  conference,  any  objection  to the  appointment  of  a  mediator,  any  notice 
required to be given, any settlement agreement, any report prepared by the mediator, and 
any similar  documents  as  may  become  necessary  or  appropriate  in  the  course  of  the 
settlement conference.

letters, sign, card, or device tending to indicate that the person is a court reporter 
or shorthand reporter, unless the person is certified as a shorthand reporter or a 
provisional court reporter by the Supreme Court of Texas. Nothing in this rule 
must  be  construed  to  either  sanction  or  prohibit  the  use  of  electronic  court 
recording  equipment  operated  by  a  noncertified  court  reporter  pursuant  and 
according to rules adopted or approved by the Supreme Court of Texas. 

b)  A court reporting firm and its affiliate offices must register with the Commission. Unless

(2) 

offer services as a court reporting firm or shorthand reporting firm. 

c) 

These rules do not apply to: 

(1) 

(2) 

a party to the litigation involved, the party's attorney, or a full-time employee of 
either; or 

court reporting services performed outside of this State by a shorthand  reporter 
who is not certified in this State for use in a court proceeding in this State, provided 
that the work resulting from those services is produced and billed wholly outside 
of this State. 

d) 

Subject  to  the  requirements  of  Rule  6.4(d)  and  (e),  nothing  in  these  rules  should  be 
construed to prohibit the employment of a noncertified shorthand reporter until a certified 
shorthand  reporter  is  available  in  the  judicial  district  where services  of  a  shorthand 
reporter are desired. 

e) 

To qualify for certification, a person must:

(A) 

Part A will be composed of five minutes of two-voice dictation of questions 
and answers given at 225 words per minute, five minutes of dictation of a 
jury charge given at 200 words per minute, and five minutes of dictation of

(C) 

The minimum passing grade on each section of Part A is 95% accuracy. An 
error will be charged for: 

(i) 

each wrong word; 

(ii) 

each omitted word; 

(iii) 

each added word not dictated; 

(iv)

(x) 

each wrong number. 

(D)  Applicants may use a dictionary during Part A. 

(E) 

Applicants will be allowed three hours to complete the transcription of Part

may use only the original takedown from which the transcript was prepared 
to review the  transcript. 

(2) 

Part B component. 

(A) 

Part B of the test must consist of objective questions touching on elementary 
aspects  of  court  reporting,  spelling,  and  grammar  and  Texas  rules  and 
procedure.

examination but fails the other part will not be required to be reexamined on the 
part that the applicant passed. 

h)  An applicant who fails an examination may request that the examination be regraded by 
sending a written request to the Commission office within 20 days of the date of notice that

the applicant has failed the examination. If the examination is regraded, the Commission 
will inform the applicant of the results of the regrading. Upon receipt of the regrading 
results, the applicant  may request a personal review of the examination  with a member 
of the advisory board. The request for a personal review must be in writing and filed 
within 20 days of the notice of regrading results. 

The Commission must certify to the Supreme Court of Texas the names of applicants who 
have completed all application requirements and are determined on examination to be 
qualified in professional shorthand reporting. In its certification, the Commission must 
specify the method or methods of reporting used by each successful applicant in taking 
the examination. 

A person certified under Chapter 52 of the Government Code prior to September 1, 1983, 
may retain a general certification authorizing the person to use any method of shorthand 
reporting authorized in Rule 6.2(a)(1), provided that the person keeps the certification 
in continuous effect. 

To register, a court reporting firm or affiliate office must pay all required fees and register 
on a form provided by the Commission. The registration form must state whether any 
officers, directors, or managerial employees of the firm or affiliate office have been finally 
convicted of a felony or misdemeanor other than a minor traffic offense or juvenile offense. 

l) 

The Commission may: 

refuse to certify to the Supreme Court the application of a person who was finally 
convicted of an offense that directly relates to the duties and responsibilities of a 
certified court reporter as determined using the factors listed in Rule 3.5; or 

refuse to register a court reporting firm or affiliate office if an officer, director, 
or  managerial  employee of the firm or affiliate office was finally convicted of a 
felony or misdemeanor that directly relates to providing court reporting services 
as determined using the factors listed in Rule 3.5. 

.3 

Certification by Endorsement 

a) 

Pursuant to Rule 3.3, the Commission will waive Part A of the examination for an applicant 
for certification by endorsement as a shorthand reporter who: 

(1) 

is certified or licensed in good standing in another jurisdiction that: 

(A) 

has certification or licensing requirements that are substantially equivalent to, 
or more stringent than, the Commission’s standards for initial certification; 

(B) 

has entered into a reciprocity agreement with the Supreme Court of Texas; or 

(C) 

is  included  on  the  list  of  states  that  have  certification  or  licensing 
requirements that are substantially equivalent to the requirements for initial

Government Code; and 

(2) 

provides proof to the Commission acceptable to the Commission that the applicant 
has  been  actively  performing  court  reporting  in  the  other  jurisdiction  where  the 
applicant is a licensed or certified shorthand reporter during three years of the five-
year period immediately preceding the application for certification by endorsement. 

An  applicant  for  certification  by  endorsement  must  successfully  complete  Part  B  of  the 
examination and pass a criminal history background check as prerequisites for endorsement. 

Nothing in this Rule prohibits an applicant for certification by endorsement from obtaining 
a  provisional  certification  under  Rule  6.5  while  the  application  for  certification  by 
endorsement is pending. 

.4 

Apprentice Court Reporter 

a) 

The Commission must grant an apprenticeship to an applicant who: 

(1) 

passes any subpart of Part A of the examination required by Section 154.103(b) of 
the Government Code during the two-year period immediately preceding the date of 
application in accordance with Rule 3.11(d); 

(2) 

passes Part B of the examination required by Section 154.103(c) of the Government 
Code; 

(3) 

passes a criminal history background check; and 

(4) 

submits one of the following to the Commission: 

 

 

 

(A) 

a letter from a court reporting school verifying that the applicant is a student 
at  that  school  enrolled  in  an  upper  speed  class  and  can  report  at  least  200 
words per minute; 

(B) 

a certificate of completion from a court reporting school; or 

(C) 

references,  work  product,  or  other  evidence  of  performing  shorthand 
reporting services in a jurisdiction that does not license or certify shorthand 
reporters  in  a  satisfactory  manner  for  three  years  of  the  five-year  period 
immediately  preceding  the  date  of  the  application  for  an  apprenticeship 
certification. 

An apprentice shorthand reporter must not report a hearing before a court but may provide 
reporting  and  transcription  services  for  other  proceedings  and  depositions,  other  than 
depositions  of  an  expert  witness,  provided  that  the  apprentice  provides  the  reporting  and 
transcription services under the direct supervision of a certified shorthand reporter who has 
been certified in good standing for at least ten years (“supervising shorthand reporter”). An

apprentice  shorthand  reporter  who  becomes  a  fully  certified  shorthand  reporter  may 
transcribe a record he or she reported as an apprentice. A supervising shorthand reporter must 
prepare  the  transcript  of  a  record taken  by  an  apprentice  under  the  supervising reporter’s 
supervision after the conclusion of the apprenticeship if the apprentice is not certified as a 
shorthand reporter when the transcript is requested. 

An apprentice shorthand reporter is subject, as applicable, to the laws, rules, code of ethics, 
uniform format manual, orders, and other requirements of the Commission and is subject to 
discipline by the Commission. 

An  applicant  for  an  apprenticeship  must  include  the  proposed  supervising  shorthand 
reporter’s name and certification number on the application and, upon applying, must file a 
statement  of  the  supervising  shorthand  reporter  attesting  to  the  supervising  shorthand 
reporter’s agreement to supervise the apprentice and assume responsibility for the work of 
the apprentice. 

An apprentice shorthand reporter must create an audio backup of each deposition or other 
proceeding authorized by subsection (b) that the apprentice reports. The certification page of 
each transcript reported by an apprentice must include the supervising shorthand reporter’s 
name, certification number, and signature. The apprentice must file steno notes, text files, 
and audio backup with the supervising reporter no later than five days after the date of the 
conclusion of the deposition or other authorized proceeding reported by the apprentice. The 
supervising shorthand reporter must maintain for the duration of the apprenticeship a log of 
every transcript prepared by an apprentice and signed by the supervising shorthand reporter.  

A supervising shorthand reporter must not be related within the second degree by affinity 
(marriage) or within the third degree by consanguinity (blood or adoption) to an apprentice 
the supervising shorthand reporter is supervising. A supervising shorthand reporter must not 
supervise his or her employer as an apprentice. A supervising shorthand reporter must not 
supervise any other person who has supervisory authority over the shorthand reporter in any 
employment or professional capacity.  

A supervising shorthand reporter must not supervise more than two apprentices at a time. 

A supervising shorthand reporter whose certification expires, is revoked, or is suspended, or 
who voluntarily surrenders his or her certification, must not continue as  a supervisor and 
must notify all apprentices under his or her supervision that he or she cannot continue as a 
supervisor. 

An apprentice shorthand reporter must take Part A of the examination at least two times per 
year during the apprenticeship. An apprentice shorthand reporter must submit written proof 
of taking the examination to the supervising shorthand reporter. The supervising shorthand 
reporter must inform the Commission if the apprentice does not comply with the examination 
requirement. The Commission may terminate the apprenticeship of an apprentice who fails 
to take Part A of the examination at least two times per year.

be further restricted, the apprenticeship should be terminated, or if the supervisor ceases to 
supervise the apprentice. A supervising shorthand report is responsible for the quality and 
timeliness  of  transcriptions  performed  under  the  supervising  shorthand  reporter’s 
supervision. A supervisor shorthand reporter may be subject to disciplinary action for the 
conduct and work performance of an apprentice under the supervising shorthand reporter’s 
supervision. 

k)   An apprentice shorthand reporter must provide written notice of the apprenticeship to the 
attorney  who  is  taking  the  deposition  or  retaining  court  reporting  services  at  another 
proceeding at least five days before the deposition or other proceeding or, if the apprentice 
receives the assignment within five days of the depositions or other proceeding, as soon as 
practicable before the deposition or other proceeding. 

l) 

An  apprentice  shorthand  reporter  must  use  a  full  professional  version  of  computer-aided 
transcription (CAT) software without page limitations in order to report a deposition or other 
authorized proceeding. 

m)  An  apprenticeship  must  not  last  longer  than  two  years,  except  an  apprenticeship  may  be 
extended  until  the  apprentice  receives  the  results  of  Part  A  of  the  examination  if  the 
examination  results  are  outstanding  at  the  end  of  the  two-year  apprenticeship  period.  A 
period of disciplinary suspension does not prolong the two-year period of the apprenticeship.  

.5 

Provisional Certification 

The Commission must grant a provisional certification to an applicant who passes Part B of 
the  examination  outlined  in  Section  154.103(c)  of  the  Government  Code  and  a  criminal 
history background check, if: 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

the applicant previously was certified as a shorthand reporter in Texas and, within 
the  three-year  period  immediately  preceding  the  application  for  provisional 
certification,  retired  or  otherwise  ceased  certification  while  certified  in  good 
standing; 

the applicant was licensed or certified in good standing in another jurisdiction and 
actively engaged in the practice of shorthand reporting in that jurisdiction for three 
years  out  of  the  five-year  period  immediately  preceding  the  application  for 
provisional certification; 

the  applicant  was  actively  engaged  in  the  practice  of  shorthand  reporting  in  the 
federal  courts  for  three  years  of  the  five-year  period  immediately  preceding  the 
application for provisional certification; or 

the applicant, after testing, holds certification in good standing as an RPR issued by 
the National Court Reporters Association or another comparable or more stringent 
certification issued by that Association or another comparable organization and has 
been actively engaged in the practice of shorthand reporting for three years of the 
five-year period immediately preceding the application for provisional certification.

  (

A  person  who  holds  a  provisional  certification  may  engage  in  the  practice  of  shorthand 
reporting only by use of a method for which he or she was provisionally certified. A person 
who takes a record while provisionally certified may produce a transcript of the record after 
expiration of the provisional certification.  

A person who holds a provisional certification is subject, as applicable, to the laws, rules, 
code of ethics, uniform format manual, orders and other requirements of the Commission 
and is subject to discipline by the Commission.  

A provisional certification expires upon the holder’s certification as a shorthand reporter or 
the  third  anniversary  of  the  date  of  issuance,  whichever  occurs  earlier.  A  provisional 
certification may be extended until the person who holds it receives the results of Part A of 
the  examination  if  the  examination  results  are  outstanding  at  the  end  of  the  three-year 
provisional  certification  period.  A  period  of  disciplinary  suspension  does  not  prolong  the 
three-year period of provisional certification.  

Renewal of Certification or Registration 

Notwithstanding Rule (b), not later than the 30th day before the date a court reporter's or 
court reporting firm's certification or registration is scheduled to expire, the Commission 
will notify the reporter or firm of the impending expiration at the reporter's or firm's last 
known address according to the Commission's records. Failure to receive the notice does 
not exempt a court reporter or a court reporting firm from any requirements of these rules. 

To qualify for renewal of certification or registration, a certified court reporter, court 
reporting firm, or affiliate office must pay all required fees, submit all required forms, 
and comply with renewal procedures. In addition, certified court reporters and at least 
one person who has management authority over each certified shorthand reporting firm 
must comply with the Commission's continuing education requirements in Rules 4.1-4.3 
and 6.6. An application for renewal must state: 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

if the applicant is a court reporter, whether the applicant has been finally convicted 
of a criminal offense other than a minor traffic offense since the reporter's last 
certification; 

if the applicant is a court reporting firm or affiliate office,  whether an officer, 
director, or managerial employee has been finally convicted of a criminal offense 
other  than  a  minor  traffic  offense  since  the  firm's  or  affiliate  office's  last 
registration; and 

if the applicant is a court reporter, whether the applicant has ever been the subject 
of a disciplinary action by a licensing authority in another jurisdiction requiring 
certification,  registration,  or  licensure  to  provide  court  reporting  services,  and

Responsibilities of Certified Court Reporters 

A certified court reporter is entitled to use the title "Certified Shorthand Reporter" or the 
abbreviation "CSR." A certified shorthand reporter may administer oaths to witnesses in 
accordance with Section 154.105 of the Government Code. 

The  transcription  of  any  proceeding  and  any  other  document  certified  by  a  certified 
shorthand reporter for use in litigation in the courts of this State must contain a signed 
certificate in the form required by the Uniform Format Manual. 

A certification of a transcript of a court proceeding by an official court reporter must 
contain a signed certificate in the form required by the Uniform Format Manual. 

d)  A noncertified shorthand reporter may report an oral deposition only if: 

(l) 

the  noncertified  reporter  delivers  an  affidavit  to  the  parties  or  to  their  counsel 
present at the deposition stating that a certified shorthand reporter is not available; 
or 

(2) 

the parties or their counsel stipulate on the record at the beginning of the deposition 
that a certified shorthand reporter is not available. 

A noncertified shorthand reporter who is employed when a certified shorthand reporter 
is not available must include with the certification of a transcription of a court proceeding 
an affidavit that no certified shorthand reporter was available to perform the duties of the 
court reporter. 

Official  court  reporters,  deputy  court  reporters,  and  substitute  court  reporters  must 
comply with the Act, Chapter 52 of the Government Code, and all applicable provisions 
of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure in conducting of the business of their offices.

In addition to the annual report required by Section 155.105 of the Government Code, each 
guardianship program must update the information filed with the Commission under (b) 
no later than January 31 of each year. 

.9 

Successor Guardians; Continuity of Guardianship Services 

A guardianship program must immediately cease applying for or accepting appointment 
as  a  guardian  upon  the  expiration,  suspension,  or  revocation  of  the  guardianship 
program's  registration  certificate  or  upon  the  Commission's  refusal  to  renew  the 
program's registration certificate. Upon the expiration, suspension, revocation or non-
renewal of its registration certificate, a guardianship program must, within seven days, 
provide written notice of the need to appoint a successor or temporary guardian to each 
court for which the guardianship program serves as guardian of a ward of the court. The 
guardianship program must send a copy of the written notice to the Commission. 

b)  Upon the suspension or revocation of a guardianship program's registration certificate 
or upon the suspension or revocation of a certification of a guardian for a guardianship 
program,  the  Commission  must  provide  written  notice  to  each  court  with  probate 
jurisdiction.

written notice to the courts and the Commission regarding any interruption of the legal 
authority of the guardianship program to provide guardianship services. Each certified 
guardian who exercise managerial authority over a guardianship program is subject to 
disciplinary  action  for  failing  to  provide  timely  written  notice  to  the  courts  and  the 
Commission  regarding  any  interruption  of  the  legal  authority  of  the  guardianship 
program to provide guardianship services.

To be approved, the training must consist of at least 24 hours of content covering mediation 
methods, goals, and techniques. The course content must also address the following: 

(1) 

a survey of the law of guardianship; 

the purpose and nature of guardianship, including the typical interests at stake in a 
contested guardianship; 

practical  and  ethical  considerations  arising  in  typical  guardianship  mediation 
scenarios based upon case studies; 

alternatives to guardianship, including less restrictive support and services available 
for the prospective ward; 

matters relating to capacity of the prospective ward, including mediation of conflicts 
regarding an incapacity determination; 

issues  of  mediation  confidentiality  and  the  privacy  interests  of  the  parties  to 
mediation; 

the ward’s bill of rights; 

the  importance  of  involving  the  prospective  ward  and  focusing  mediation  on  the 
prospective ward; 

practical  matters  regarding  a  guardian’s  responsibilities  to  conduct  inventories, 
accountings, and reports on the ward’s estate, as well as other fiduciary duties; and 

10) 

the role of the Mediator as an impartial facilitator in resolving contested matters. 

 
The Commission may approve a course provided by an alternative dispute resolution system 
or  other  dispute  resolution  organization  as  an  approved  guardianship  mediation  training 
course. 

Once a guardianship mediation training course is approved, the Commission will post the 
name of the course and its provider on the Commission’s website. 

A Mediator is encouraged to attend a guardianship mediation training course approved by 
the  Commission,  but  attendance  is  not  a  required  prerequisite  to  conduct  a  guardianship 
mediation.  A court has discretion to refer a contested guardianship dispute to any Mediator, 
regardless of whether the Mediator has attended a guardianship mediation training course 
approved by the Commission.
