PREFACE 

By  Supreme  Court  Order  dated  May  25,  2010,  in  Misc.  Docket  No.  10-9077,  with 
amendment dated June 28, 2010, in Misc. Docket No. 10-9113, the following Uniform Format 
Manual  for  Texas  Reporters’  Records  governs  the  form  of  Official  Reporters’  Records  and, 
unless  otherwise  stated,  Freelance  Reporters’  Records,  in  paper  and  electronic  format. This 
manual supersedes the manual in the Supreme Court Order dated July 8, 2003, in Misc. Docket 
No. 03-9070, which superseded the Supreme Court  Order Directing the  Form  of the Appellate 
Record  in  Civil  Cases  and  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  Order  Directing  the  Form  of  the 
Appellate Record in Criminal Cases.  The requirements of this edition of the manual apply to any 
Official Reporter’s Record or Freelance Reporter’s Record within the scope of the manual that is 
transcribed or prepared on or after July 1, 2010. 

A court reporter and court recorder must prepare and file the Official Reporter’s Record 
in accordance with this manual; Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure 13, 34.6, and 35; and any 
other applicable rules and law.  Even if more than one notice of appeal or request for preparation 
of  the  record  is  filed,  the  court  reporter  or  court  recorder  should  prepare  only  one  Official 
Reporter’s  Record  in  a  case.    In  the  event  of  a  flagrant  violation  of  the  requirements  in  the 
manual,  on  motion  of  a  party  or  on  the  court’s  own  initiative,  the  appellate  court  or  presiding 
judge  may  require  the  court  reporter  or  court  recorder  to  amend  or  prepare  a  new  record  in 
proper form — and provide it to any party who has been provided a copy of the defective record 
— at the preparer’s expense.  Additionally, failure to comply with mandatory provisions of this 
manual by either official or freelance court reporters may be grounds for discipline through the 
Court Reporters Certification Board. 

This  manual  was  originally  prepared  primarily  through  a  joint  effort  of  the  Court 
Reporters Certification Board, through its Ad Hoc Uniform Format Manual Committee, and the 
Uniform Format Manual Task Force.  In 2010, this manual was revised primarily through a joint 
effort  of  the  Court  Reporters  Certification  Board,  through  its  Certification/Uniform  Format 
Manual Committee, the Office of Court Administration, and the Texas Appeals Management and 
E-Filing System (TAMES) Task Force.  Questions or comments regarding the manual should be 
directed to the Court Reporters Certification Board.  

The 2010 revision of the manual is intended to provide the new instructions needed for 
court  reporters  and  court  recorders  to  file  the  Official  Reporter’s  Record  electronically,  while 
still providing the necessary guidance for paper filing.  Because the prior version of the manual 
provides  limited  guidance  for  court  recorders  who  prepare  the  Official  Reporter’s  Record,  the 
revised manual also contains new and enhanced provisions relating to these court recorders.  The 
provisions are modeled after applicable rules, such as Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure 13.2 
and 34.6(a)(2) and local rules governing the electronic recording of court proceedings.  Also as 
part of the revision process, the content of the manual has been reorganized extensively to clearly 
delineate  requirements  for  paper  versus  electronic  filing  and,  to  the  extent  possible,  to  group 
related requirements in the same section of the manual.

he editors  of this  manual  have  placed certain  text  in  boxes with  a smaller font.   Such 
commentary  does  not  prescribe  the  format  or  content  of  the  record,  but  instead  provides 
explanation and reference to applicable statutes and court rules.   

Unless otherwise indicated herein, all requirements in this manual apply to both Official Reporters’ 
Records and Freelance Reporters’ Records.

Section 2 - Page Formatting 

Unless  otherwise  specifically  provided  in  this  manual,  rules,  or  law,  the  following 
requirements  apply  equally  to  Official  Reporters’  Records  and  Freelance  Reporters’ 
Records. 

2.1 Page Size.  Each page must be formatted as 8½ x 11 inches. 

2.2 Text/Page  Color.   Solid  black  text  on  an  opaque,  white  background  page  must  be 
used, except with Realtime unedited rough drafts.  See also Section 4.3, infra.  

2.3 Character Spacing. The pitch (characters per inch) must be 9 or 10. 

2.4 Legibility and Font.  The font must be mixed uppercase and lowercase and clearly 
legible.   Interlineations  are  not  permitted.   The  use  of  any  product  limiting  the 
reproduction of a record is prohibited. 

2.5 Margins.  The distance between the left and right marginal lines must be no less than 
six  and  one-half  (6  ½”)  inches  or  between  fifty-six  (56)  and  sixty-three  (63)  spaces  or 
characters per line.  The left margin text must be set one character from the left marginal 
line,  and  the  right  margin  text,  except  for  automatic  word-wrapping,  must  be  set  one 
character from the right marginal line (not justified). 

2.6 Format Box.  A format box consisting of solid top, bottom, left, and right marginal 
lines is required to mark the margins of a transcription. 

2.7 Questions and Answers (Q. & A.).  “Q.” and “A.” must be used to signify questions 
and answers.  The period following the “Q” and “A” designation is optional. 

2.8  Quotations.    Quoted  material  must  follow  the  general  format  guidelines  in  this 
manual with respect to marginal and tab settings.  The use of quotation marks is optional.  
See Figure 18. 

2.9  Dashes.    Interruptions  of  speech  must  be  denoted  by  the  use  of  dashes  (  --  )  at  the 
point of interruption, and again at the point the speaker resumes speaking.  See Figure 19. 

2.10 Position  of  Tab  Settings.   Three  tab  settings  are  required  for  use  on  all 
transcriptions.  The first tab setting must be on the fifth space from the left text margin.  
The second tab setting must be on the tenth space from the left text margin.  The third tab 
setting must be the fifteenth space from the left text margin.  These tabulations should be 
sufficient for all indentations that need to be made in any transcription.  

2.11 Use of Tab Settings. The first tab setting must be used for “Q.” or “A.”  The second 
tab setting must be used for the beginning of text after the “Q.” or “A.”  All subsequent 
lines must return to the left margin.  See Figure 17.

The third tab setting must be used for speaker identification, followed directly by a colon 
and  two  spaces.    The  third  tab  setting  must  also  be  used  for  a  new  paragraph  or 
parenthetical.  All subsequent lines must return to the left margin.   See Figure 18.  But 
when more than one line is necessary for a parenthetical, each subsequent line must also 
begin at the third tab setting.   

2.12 Line Numbers.  The line numbers 1-25 must be placed to the left of the format box. 

2.13 Lines of Text.  Each page of transcription must contain 25 lines of text, numbered 1 
through  25,  double  spaced,  except  where  appropriate  on  administrative  pages.    Page 
numbers or headers and footers are not considered part of the 25 lines of text.  The last 
page may contain fewer lines if it is less than a full page of transcription. 

2.14 Blank Lines.  No blank lines will be permitted except when a witness setup carries 
over to the next page, for administrative pages, or when counsel requests blank lines. 

2.15 Placement of Time Stamping.  The use of time stamping is optional.  When time 
stamping is utilized, it must be placed to the left of the line numbers or to the right of the 
right marginal line.  It may be in a smaller pitch than the specified 9 or 10 pitch required 
for the text.  

The requirement that deposition officers keep time in oral depositions, imposed by the 1999 
civil discovery rules revisions, is discussed below in the comment following Section 3.3.  

2.16 Placement  of  Page  Number.   The  page  number  must  be  placed  at  the  top  right 
corner  of  the  page  —  flush  with  the  right  margin  —  inside  or  outside  the  format  box.  
The page number does not count as a line. 

2.17 Page Numbering.  The pages of the Official Reporter’s Record must be numbered 
consecutively  beginning  with  page  “1”  for  each  volume.   Except  when  specifically 
provided otherwise in this manual, each volume of the record must begin with page “1”.  
Index pages may not be numbered with Roman numerals. 

2.18 Page  Headings.   The  use  of  page  headings  (also  known  as  headers)  as  brief 
descriptions to aid in locating the testimony of witnesses or events is optional. 

2.19 Placement  of  Page  Heading.   If  used,  a  page  heading  must  appear  above  line  1, 
outside the format box.  A page heading does not count as a line.

Reporter’s  Record  being  certified,  then  each  court  reporter  involved  must  certify  each 
volume that he or she produced.  The party responsible for the costs must be identified in 
the certification page contained in the final volume.  (Note: The contents of the title page 
should  not  be  repeated  as  part  of  the  certification  page.)   See  Figures  5  and  6  for 
examples  of  the  Official  Reporter’s  Record  Certification  Page  for  Texas  CSRs  and  for

(b) Court Recorder.  The court recorder must authenticate each copy of an audio-storage 
device on which proceedings are recorded with a certification page that identifies clearly 
the subject audio-storage device.  The court recorder must also authenticate each copy of 
a log with a certification page on the last page of the log.  If more than one court recorder 
is involved in the production of the Official Reporter’s Record being certified, then each 
court recorder must certify each audio-storage device or log that he or she produced.  The 
party responsible for the costs must be identified in the final certification page contained 
in the Official Reporter’s Record.   

See Section 8 for certification requirements for electronically-filed records.

Comment Concerning Certification of Depositions, Timekeeping,  
and Other Duties of Deposition Officers 

 Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 203 sets forth the requirements governing presentment, signature, 
certification,  and  delivery  of  oral  and  written  depositions.   These  requirements  apply  to  any  “deposition 
officer,”  who,  for  purposes  of  the  discovery  rules,  is  defined  as  any  person  responsible  for  recording  a 
deposition.  There may be more than one “deposition officer” in an oral deposition.  For example, if a party 
notices an oral deposition to be recorded non-stenographically, another party may notice the deposition to 
be recorded stenographically by a CSR.  See Tex. R. Civ. P. 199.1(c), 199.2(b)(3).  In such a case, both the 
person  responsible  for  recording  the  deposition  non-stenographically  and  the  person  responsible  for 
recording  the  deposition  stenographically  would  be  a  “deposition  officer”  required  to  comply  with  Rule 
203 with respect to the form of recording for which that person was responsible.   

A  deposition  officer  responsible  for  a  stenographic  recording  of  an  oral  deposition  must  present 
the transcript for signature in accordance with Rule 203.1, although this requirement does not apply to non-
stenographic recordings or depositions on written questions.  See Tex. R. Civ. P. 203.1(c).  Each deposition 
officer must also certify a deposition in accordance with Rule 203.2(a)-(g), although subparts (b), (c), and 
(e) obviously do not apply to depositions on written questions and subparts (b), (c), and (f) do not apply to 
non-stenographic recordings of oral depositions.  

An  important  certification  requirement  applicable  to  oral  depositions,  however  recorded,  is  that 
deposition officers must certify the amount of time used by each party at the deposition.  See Tex. R. Civ. 
P. 203.2(e).  This requirement is intended to aid enforcement of time limits on the examination and cross-
examination  of  witnesses.   See  Tex.  R.  Civ.  P.  190.2(c),  190.3(b)(2),  199.5(c).   Although  time-stamping 
may facilitate the completion of this task, it is not required; rather, the deposition officer may simply use a 
stopwatch or other time-keeping device.  The time credited to a party obviously should not include recesses 
or  off-the  record  discussion,  and  it  should  not  include  protracted  lapses,  such  as  when  a  witness  is 
reviewing  a  stack  of  documents.   But  the  time  would  include  ordinary  pauses  by  the  interrogator  or  the 
witness.  

Nothing in the timekeeping requirement provisions requires or even permits a deposition officer to 
referee attorney disagreements at depositions.  If a dispute develops among counsel about how time is to be 
kept, the officer should not attempt to resolve it but should simply make a record of the disagreement so 
that it can be taken to the court if necessary.  If an officer makes a mistake in keeping or certifying time, the 
court  will  treat  it  as  any  other  mistake  made  by  the  officer  and  order  any  adjustments  in  discovery 
considered appropriate.  Nothing in the rules requires an officer to keep track of the time remaining to an 
attorney during a deposition, nor should an officer cease recording the deposition if the officer or a party 
determines  that  the  time  limits  have  been  exceeded.   An  officer’s  responsibility  is  to  make  an  accurate 
record, not to police counsel or witnesses.  Deposition officers should not allow themselves to be injected 
into  counsel’s  disputes.   If  lawyers  cannot  agree  on  the  peculiar  details  of  counting  time  in  a  particular 
situation, they should make a record of their respective positions and let a judge sort it out. 

3.5 Certified Questions.  A certified question is a question that the witness has refused 
to answer or has been instructed by his or her counsel not to answer during the course of 
the  deposition.   The  attorney  may  want  to  argue  that  particular  question  in  front  of  the 
judge.  The attorney will generally say, “Certify that question,” on the record.  The court 
reporter must type the testimony and any colloquy in the record in the usual manner.  If 
the attorney has requested a separate booklet, then the court reporter must excerpt a copy 
of the pertinent testimony from the final transcript into a separate booklet.  All certified 
questions must be listed in the index.

3.6 CSR’s  Certification  of Another’s Notes.   When a court reporter prepares  a record 
from  the  notes  of  another,  the  court  reporter  must  include  a  certification  page  to  that 
effect  —  in  the  form  in  Figure  12  —  and  a  statement  of  the  amount  and  payor  of  the 
transcription fee. 

3.7 CSR’s Certification of Non-stenographic Record.  When a court reporter prepares 
a  transcription  from  a  non-stenographic  record,  the  court  reporter  must  include  a 
certification  page  to  that  effect  and  a  statement  of  the  amount  and  payor  of  the 
transcription fee.  See Figure 13 for an example of the form, which may also be used by 
court-approved transcribers who are not court reporters.   A freelance court reporter must 
include,  to  the  extent  known,  a  cover  page  for  a  transcription  of  a  non-stenographic 
record giving the names of the parties, the court of record, the date of the testimony, the 
method  of  recording,  and  the  names  of  the  witnesses  for  each  party.    See  Figures  30 
through  30F  for  examples  of  cover  pages  for  transcriptions  of  non-stenographic 
recordings.  

Comment Concerning Non-Stenographic Depositions 

Whether and when an oral deposition may be recorded non-stenographically is governed primarily 
by statute.  Section 52.021(f) of the Government Code generally requires that all depositions taken in this 
state  must  be  recorded  stenographically  by  a  CSR.   Exceptions  to  this  requirement,  however,  include 
depositions on written questions (which are governed by Section 20.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies 
Code) and depositions recorded by a party to the action, their lawyer, or a full-time employee of either.  See 
Tex. Gov’t Code §§ 52.021(f), 52.033; Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 20.001.  Thus, for example, a litigant 
or  lawyer  in  a  case  may  notice  an  oral  deposition  to  be  recorded  non-stenographically  and  have  their 
secretary record the proceeding by audiotape or videotape.  See Burr v. Shannon, 593 S.W.2d 677, 677-78 
(Tex.  1980)  (orig.  proceeding)  (predecessor  statute).   But  so  long  as  some  party  has  an  oral  deposition 
recorded  stenographically  by  a  CSR,  another  party  may  have  any  person  record  the  deposition  non-
stenographically.  See Op. Tex. Att’y Gen. No. DM-339 (1995), at 2. 

If a party arranges to have an oral deposition recorded non-stenographically by someone other than 
a  CSR,  the  party  must  arrange  to  have  the  witness  sworn  by  a  notary  or  other  person  competent  to 
administer oaths.  See Tex. R. Civ. P. 199.5(b); see also Tex. Gov’t Code § 52.025(b) (CSR is competent to 
administer oaths). 

A non-stenographic recording of an oral deposition may be used in  a hearing or trial to the same 
extent  as  a  traditional  stenographic  recording.    See  Tex.  R.  Civ.  P.  203.6(a).   Unlike  the  case  under  the 
former  discovery  rules,  a  party  need  not  obtain  a  written  transcription  of  a  non-stenographic  recording  in 
order to use the deposition unless ordered by the court.  Id.; compare Former Rule 202.1.e. 

3.8 Language and Verbal Expressions.  Except as noted below, a transcription must 
contain all English words and other verbal expressions uttered during the course of the 
proceedings.  

3.9 Verbal and Nonverbal Expressions.  Expressions such as “Uh-huh” and “Huh-uh” 
should  be  transcribed  accordingly.    “Uh-huh”  is  used  when  the  speaker  is  answering 
affirmatively.   “Huh-uh”  is  used  when  the  speaker  is  answering  negatively.   In  the 
instance  where  there  is  no  verbal  response  to  a  query  (i.e.,  person  nodding  or  shaking 
head),  the  court  reporter  may  indicate  in  the  transcription  that  the  person  is  indicating 
either affirmatively or negatively.

3.10 Witness and Examination Setup Examples. 

(a) Official  Reporter’s  Record.    At  the  beginning  of  a  witness’s  testimony,  the 
transcription  must,  consistent  with  Figure  14,  include  the  name  of  the  witness  and  the 
person  conducting  the  examination  and  indicate  that  the  witness  was  sworn  in  and  the 
type of examination conducted. 

(b) Freelance  Reporter’s  Record.    At  the  beginning  of  a  witness’s  testimony,  the 
transcription  must,  consistent  with  Figure  15,  include  the  name  of  the  witness  and  the 
person  conducting  the  examination  and  indicate  that  the  witness  was  sworn  in  and  the 
type of examination conducted. 

3.11 Witness  Sworn  Through  Interpreter.   When  a  witness  testifies  through  an 
interpreter,  at  the  beginning  of  a  witness’s  testimony,  the  transcription  must,  consistent 
with Figure 16, include the witness’s name and indicate that the witness was sworn in. 

Suggested Oath to the Interpreter: 

OURT REPORTER: “Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the interpretation you will 
give  in  this  deposition  will  be  from  English  to  Spanish/Vietnamese/etc.  and  from 
Spanish/Vietnamese/etc. to English to the best of your ability?” 

uggested Oath to Sign Interpreter: 

OURT REPORTER: “do you solemnly swear or affirm that the interpretation you will 
give in this deposition will be from English to American Sign Language/Signed English 
and American Sign Language/Signed English to English to the best of your ability?” 

.12 Testimony  Through  Interpreter.   In  interpreted  testimony,  court  reporters  must 
use  Q&A  sequencing  to  reflect  the  question  asked  in  English  by  the  attorney  and  the 
answer  of  the  witness  given  in  English  through  the  interpretation  process.   When 
interpreters  are  used,  it  will  be  assumed,  unless  otherwise  stated,  that  answers  are  in  a 
foreign language and interpreted. 

Sometimes  a  witness  testifying  through  an  interpreter  will  answer  some  questions  in 
English.  If part of the translation is given by the interpreter and the rest is in English by 
the  witness,  the  parenthetical  “(In  English)”  may  precede  the  portion  of  the  witness’s 
remarks in English.  

Sometimes attorney(s) are fluent in the native tongue of the witness and may speak to the 
witness directly without the interpreter.  A parenthetical should be used in this situation.  
See Figure 22. 

3.13  Punctuation  and  Spelling.    Punctuation  and  spelling  must  be  consistent  with 
generally accepted standards.  See, for example, the standards in The Elements of Style by

or later; and The Merriam-Webster Dictionary, 11th Edition or later.  

3.14  Striking  from  the  Record.    No  portion  of  any  proceeding  may  be  omitted  by  a 
request or an order to strike.  The material ordered stricken, as well as the order to strike, 
must all appear in any transcription.  

3.15 Editing of Speech.   Any transcription  should provide  an  accurate record of words 
spoken  in  the  course  of  proceedings.   All  grammatical  errors,  changes  of  thought, 
contractions,  misstatements,  and  poorly-constructed  sentences  must  be  transcribed  as 
spoken.  

3.16 Parentheticals.   Parenthetical  notations  in  any  transcription  are  a  court  reporter’s 
own  words,  enclosed  in  parentheses,  recording  some  action  or  event.   Parenthetical 
notations  should  be  as  short  as  possible  and  consistent  with  clarity  and  standard  word 
usage.  Blank lines before or after parenthetical notations are prohibited.   

It is the responsibility of the attorneys, as well as the judge in some instances, to note for 
the record any significant nonverbal behavior (e.g., physical gestures and lengthy pauses 
on the part of a witness).  If counsel or the court fails to refer to the witness’s affirmative 
or negative gesture or other things occurring during the proceedings that may assist the 
reader, parenthetical notations may be used. 

(a)  Recommended  Parentheticals.   The  following  are  recommended  parenthetical 
notations to be used where appropriate: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

(Call to order of the court)

(Proceedings concluded / recessed at ^) 
(Requested portion was read) 

(b) Parentheticals  for Criminal  Trials.   In  criminal  trials,  the  defendant’s  presence  or 
absence must be noted on the record.   If a jury is involved, it is essential to indicate by 
the proper parenthetical notation whether the proceedings occurred in the presence of the 
jury, out of the presence of the jury, prior to the jury entering the courtroom, or after the 
jury left the courtroom. 

(Open court, defendant and jury panel present)

3.18 Readback - Official Reporter’s Record.  For clarity of the record, readback during 
proceedings  must,  consistent  with  Figure  20,  be  quoted  in  the  transcription  at  the  point 
read. 

If  readback  of  testimony  is  requested  during  jury  deliberations,  the  Official  Reporter’s 
Record  must  reflect  the  judicially  approved  excerpted  testimony  in  at  least  one  of  the 
following ways:  

1.  a parenthetical note reflecting the volume, page(s), and line number(s) read to the 

jury;  

2.  a transcription of the excerpted testimony requested by the jury will be attached to 
the  jury’s  note  and  the  court’s  response  and  will  become  part  of  the  Clerk’s 
Record; or 

3.  a  transcription  of  the  excerpted  testimony  requested  by  the  jury  will  be  inserted 

into the Official Reporter’s Record.   

3.19 Readback of Freelance Reporter’s Record.  Readback of a Freelance Reporter’s 
Record  may  be  addressed  as  set  out  in  Section  3.18  for  clarity  purposes  or  in  the 
following manner: (Requested portion was read).  

3.20  Audio  and  Audio-Visual  Recordings.    Generally,  audio  and  audio-visual 
recordings played in court are entered as an exhibit in the proceedings.  When the audio 
or audio-visual recordings are played in court, a contemporaneous verbatim record of the 
proceedings will not be made unless the court so orders.  

3.21  Private  or  Off-the-Record  Communications.  Private  or  off-the-record 
communications  must  be  noted  as  follows:  (Discussion  off  the  record)  or  (Sotto  voce 
discussion off the record).  

3.22 Identification of Speakers.  All  speakers must  be properly identified throughout  a 
transcription  in  capital  letters.   Speakers  must  be  identified  using  their  last  name  only 
unless there are attorneys of the same gender and last name involved in the proceedings.

In  that  event  only  will  it  be  necessary  to  use  both  first  and  last  name.   After  colloquy 
interruptions and “Q.” and “A.” designations are resumed, the “Q.” may be followed by 
speaker  identification  on  the  same  line  to  remind  the  reader  who  is  conducting  the 
examination.   This  designation  may  also  be  used  after  a  parenthetical  notation  and 
colloquy.  If a by-line is used, it must be as shown in Figure 21.

.23 Index  for  Official  Reporter’s  Record.   Each  volume  of  a  transcription  must 
contain  a  chronological  index,  an  alphabetical  index,  and  an  exhibit  index,  which  must 
appear immediately following the administrative pages.  See Figure 10.  

(a) Chronological Index.  The chronological index must include a listing of all witnesses 
in the order of their appearance at trial.  Follow the form in Figure 28 when preparing an 
index  listing  multiple  attorneys  conducting  the  examination.   The  chronological  index 
must also include a listing of all events that occur.   

(b) Alphabetical Index.  Consistent with Figure 23, the alphabetical index must include 
an alphabetical listing of the witnesses.  

(c) Exhibit Index.  The exhibit index must include a complete description of the exhibits 
and  the  page  at  which  each  exhibit  was  offered  and  received  into  evidence.    Note  that 
local rules also govern the format of the exhibit index for a non-stenographic recording.  

(d) Master  Index.   When  the  Official  Reporter’s  Record  consists  of  more  than  one 
volume, in addition to the individual indexes, there must be a master index in a separate 
volume labeled “Volume 1,” consisting of a compilation of all of the individual indexes 
(listing  all  chronological  occurrences,  witnesses  in  the  order  of  their  appearance  and 

 

  3

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

alphabetically, and the exhibits).  A column for the volume number must be included for 
each  entry  in  the  master  index.    Follow  Figures  24  and  26  when  preparing  the  Master 
Index. 

A  listing  of  the  volume  numbers  and  type  of  proceeding  for  each  volume  is  NOT 
sufficient for the master index. 

EXAMPLE OF MASTER INDEX THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR FILING: 

Volume Two--------------------------------------Jury Selection 
Volume Three------------------------------------Case-in-Chief on Guilt/Innocence 
Volume Four-------------------------------------Punishment Phase 
Volume Five--------------------------------------Exhibits 

e) Index  Format.   A  columnar  format  is  required  for  listing  the  exhibits  and 
alphabetical listing of witnesses or venirepersons.  (See Section 3.26 for further details on 
capital  murder  transcriptions  and  indexes.)    The  index  must  be  single-spaced  for  the 
direct,  cross-examination,  etc.  of  the  witnesses;  however,  it  must  be  double-spaced 
between  topic  changes  (i.e.,  arraignment,  opening  statements,  plaintiff  rests,  defendant

Section 4 – Unedited Rough Draft 

Unless  otherwise  specifically  provided  in  this  manual,  rules,  or  law,  the  following 
requirements  apply  equally  to  Official  Reporters’  Records  and  Freelance  Reporters’ 
Records.  

4.1 Unedited Rough Draft Not Certified.  When preparing a rough draft transcription or 
unedited electronic transcript, the transcript of the proceedings must not be certified and 
must not be used, cited, or transcribed as a certified transcription of the proceedings.  The 
rough draft transcription may not be cited or used in any way or at any time to rebut or 
contradict the certified transcription of proceedings. 

4.2 Page  Labeling  of  Rough  Draft.   The  unedited  rough  draft  must  be  labeled  or 
watermarked with the words, “UNEDITED ROUGH DRAFT ONLY”, or with a header 
or footer on each page as follows: “UNEDITED, UNPROOFREAD, UNCORRECTED, 
UNCERTIFIED ROUGH DRAFT”. 

4.3 Printed on Color Paper. A CSR may provide an unedited rough draft if it is printed 
on colored paper. 

4.4  Content  of  Unedited  Rough  Draft.     Realtime  unedited  rough  drafts  must  not

4.5 Suggested  Disclaimer  for  Unedited  Rough  Draft.    The  following  suggested 
disclaimer may appear at the beginning of the unedited transcription. 

WARNING! 

This  unedited  rough  draft  of  the  proceedings  was produced  in  Realtime  and  is  not  certified.    The  rough 
draft transcription may not be cited or used in any way or at any  time to rebut or contradict the certified 
transcription  of  proceedings.   There  will  be  discrepancies  in  this  form  and  the  final  form,  because  this 
Realtime transcription has not been edited, proofread, corrected, finalized, indexed, or certified.  There will 
also  be  a  discrepancy  in  page  numbers  appearing  on  the  unedited  rough  draft  and  the  edited,  proofread, 
corrected, and certified final. 

4.6 Acknowledgment to Parties of Unedited Transcript.  It is recommended that each 
court  reporter  request  that  parties  acknowledge  that  receipt  of  a  Realtime  unedited 
transcript  is  not  an  official  record  of  the  court  proceedings.    See  Figure  25.

Section 5 – Exhibits in Official Reporter’s Record 

5.1 Exhibit  Items  Not  Included  in  the  Official  Reporter’s  Record.   Unless  ordered 
otherwise, neither physical evidence nor original exhibits may be included in the Official 
Reporter’s Record.   Instead, to  the extent possible, the Official Reporter’s Record must 
include a clear 8 ½ x 11” rendering of each photograph or document exhibit.   

5.2 Original Exhibit Included Only Under Order of Court.  When a legible copy of a 
photograph or any other exhibit cannot be made, the original exhibit may be included in 
the Official Reporter’s Record under order of the court. See Tex. R. App. 34.6(g).  

5.3 Description  of  Physical  Evidence.   Each  item  of  physical  evidence  must  be 
described  on  a  separate  page  in  such  a  manner  that  it  may  be  identified,  including  the 
exhibit number, unless a photocopy is included. 

 

EXAMPLE: 

STATE’S EXHIBIT NO. 1 

9mm Glock semi-automatic pistol, Model P280, Serial No. 665543 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 

5.4 Sequence of Exhibit Items.  Copies of the exhibits and the descriptions of physical 
evidence received in each separate proceeding must be placed in numerical order at the 
end of the Official Reporter’s Record.   

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

 

Section  6  –  Volumes  and  Volume  Numbering  in  Official  Reporters’ 
Records 

6.1 Arabic Numerals.  Arabic numerals must be used.  Do not use Roman numerals for 
volume numbering. 

6.2 Official Reporter’s Record - Transcription. 

(a) Multiple volumes for same day’s record.  If there is more than one volume for the 
same day, the volumes should be divided in a logical place, such as at the beginning of a 
new witness, at the end of one type of examination and the beginning of another, a recess, 
or at the beginning or end of motions, arguments, or court instructions.  

(b) Multiple volumes for record of different days.  For each day of the trial, there must 
be a new volume, starting with page 1, unless there are multiple pretrial hearings that can 
be incorporated into one volume that complies with the size requirements in Section 6.3.  
A hearing after the commencement of jury selection or the trial on the merits relating to a 
pretrial motion must appear in sequence.  

(c) Master  Index  Volume  Numbering.   Volume  “1”  will  always  be  the  master  index 
when the record consists of more than one volume. 

6.3 Size of Volumes. A volume — in a regular or compressed record — must be no more 
than 300 8 ½ x 11 pages.     

6.4 Exhibits.  The exhibits must be in a separate volume or volumes.

Section  7  –  Official  Reporter’s  Record  in  Paper  Format  for  Appellate 
Court 

7.1 Paper Volumes - Transcriptions.   Compressed records may be bound together as 
long as they comply with the size limitations in Section 6.3.  In the event they are bound 
together,  the  volumes  shall  be  separated  by  tabs  labeling  the  volume  numbers  and  the 
record must also be provided electronically, as prescribed in Section 8 of this manual. 

Otherwise, each volume must be bound separately. 

7.2 Paper.  Paper must be 8 ½ x 11 inches, with a weight of at least 13 pounds. 

7.3 Tabs.   Except as described in Section 7.1, there must be no tabs. 

7.4  Cover.    The  court  reporter  must  cover  the  original  and  each  copy  of  the  Official 
Reporter’s  Record  with  front  and  back  covers  of  good  quality,  consisting  of  white  or 
colored 140-pound, No. 1 sulfite paper, heavyweight transparent plastic, or other similar 
material approved by the court.   

7.5 Binding.   The Official Reporter’s Record  must  be bound  using flexible  prongs  that 
can be opened and that are passed through holes punched in the left side of the paper.  No 
glued, spiral, or locking bindings are allowed.

Section  8 –  Official  Reporter’s  Record  in  Electronic  Format  for 
Appellate Court  

8.1  Electronic  Format.    An  Official  Reporter’s  Record  filed  in  electronic  format  must 
duplicate,  page  by  page,  the  record  as  it  would  have  been  filed  in  paper  format.    In 
addition,  the  portion  of  the  Official  Reporter’s  Record  filed  in  electronic  format  that 
consists  of  a  non-stenographic  record  must  duplicate  the  content  of  each  audio-storage 
device on which the proceedings were recorded and the content of each audio- or video-
file exhibit.  

8.2 Computer  File Size.   A computer file must contain only one volume as defined in 
Section  6  or,  for  a  non-stenographic  record,  the  content  of  one  audio-storage  device.  
Each computer file must not exceed 100 MB or, if a video file, 5 GB.   

8.3 Computer File Type for Text Document.  Each computer file of a text document, 
such  as  a  transcription,  must  be  prepared  in  text-searchable  Portable  Document  Format 
(PDF), compatible with the latest version of Adobe Reader.  The computer file must not 
be password-protected, encrypted, or protected by rights management.  Because scanning 
creates  larger  file  sizes  with  images  of  lesser  quality,  scanning  must  be  avoided  when 
possible.    To  the  extent possible,  each  text  document  must  be  converted  directly  into  a 
PDF file using Adobe Acrobat, the word processing program’s PDF conversion utility, or 
another  software  program.    Exhibits,  however,  may  be  scanned  if  necessary.    Any 
scanned materials must be made searchable using optical-character-recognition software, 
such as Adobe Acrobat.    

8.4 Computer File Name.  The computer file name must include the following elements: 

1)  county name without spaces between words; 
2)  a hyphen; 
3)  the  trial-court  cause  number  in  the  format  the  trial  court  uses  for  cause 

numbers; 
4)  a hyphen; 
5)  one of the following: 

a.  for a text document, “RR-Vol”; or 
b.  for an audio-storage device or other audio or video file, “RR-Part”; 

6)  the  volume  number  of  the  text  document  or  the  part  number  of  an  audio-
storage-device or other audio or video file as three digits with leading zeroes 
for numbers below 100;  

7)  a period; and  
8)  the computer-file extension, as follows: 

a.  “pdf” for a text document in PDF; 
b.  “mp3” for an audio file; or 
c.  “mp4” for a video file. 

EXAMPLES: 
Part010.mp3; JimHogg-DC-09-29-RR-Part011.mp4. 

JimHogg-DC-09-29-RR-Vol003.pdf; 

JimHogg-DC-09-29-RR-

 

 

 

 

 

 

26 

 

If there are multiple volumes in the Official Reporter’s Record, the computer file name 
must identify the sequential order of the volumes or parts (e.g., JimHogg-DC-09-29-RR-
Vol001.pdf, JimHogg-DC-09-29-RR-Vol002.pdf, etc.). 

If  filing  a  supplement  to  the  Official  Reporter’s  Record,  the  computer  file  name  must 
contain a hyphen,  the  number of the supplement, the  term  “Supp”,  and another hyphen 
after the term “RR” (e.g., JimHogg- DC-09-29-RR-1Supp-Part003.mp3; JimHogg- DC-
09-29-RR-2Supp-Part003.mp3).   

If  filing  an  amendment  to  the  Official  Reporter’s  Record,  the  computer  file  name  must 
contain  a  hyphen,  the  term  “Amend”,  and  another  hyphen  after  the  phrase  “RR”  (e.g., 
JimHogg- DC-09-29-RR-Amend-Vol003.pdf). 

8.5 Scanned Documents.  Images of documents, such as exhibits or signed certification 
pages, must be included within the computer file as  images scanned in black and white 
with a resolution of 300 dots per inch (dpi).   

8.6  Photographs.    Photographic  images  other  than  documents  (e.g.,  photos  of  physical 
exhibits) must be included within the computer file as images with a resolution of not less 
than  2,048  x  1,536  pixels  (approximately  3  megapixels).    Higher  resolutions  are  not 
encouraged.  If a full color rendition is necessary, color depth should be between 12-bit 
and 18-bit.  Otherwise, grayscale images are encouraged.  Photographs may be captured 
directly with a digital camera or scanned from a photographic print. 

8.7  Sealed  Records.    Any  sealed  documents  that  are  filed  electronically  must  be  in  a 
separate computer file.  If the sealed portion of a transcription is part of a larger volume, 
an indicator page must be placed where the sealed file logically belongs.  The computer 
file  name  for  a  sealed  document  must  contain  the  applicable  elements  listed  in  Section 
8.4  and  a  hyphen,  the  number  of  the  sealed  document,  and  the  term  “Sealed”  after  the 
JimHogg-DC-09-29-RR-
phrase  “RR” 
2Sealed.pdf). 

JimHogg-DC-09-29-RR-lSealed.pdf, 

(e.g., 

8.8 Separator Pages.  If an exhibit number is not on the exhibit image, there must be a 
page preceding the image to show the exhibit number.   

8.9  Audio  Files.    If  a  court  reporter  or  court  recorder  electronically  files  an  audio 
recording that is part of the record, the audio file must be included as an MPEG-1 Audio-
Layer 3 file (usually referred to as .mp3).  The preferred sampling rate for the file is 44.1 
kHz and the preferred bit  rate for the  audio  file is  64 kbits/second, though  a court may 
request bit rates as high as 128kbits/second.  The Mp3 audio files must use a constant bit 
rate.   The  files  must  not  be  password-protected,  encrypted,  or  protected  by  rights 
management.  Each audio file must not exceed 100 MB.  If the recording is too long to fit 
in  one  file,  it  may  be  broken  into  multiple  files.    For  an  exhibit,  each  file  name  must 
include the applicable elements listed in Section 8.4 and, before the .mp3 designation, a 
hyphen, the word “Exhibit”, the exhibit number, and, if there are multiple audio files, a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27 

hyphen  and  the  file  sequence  number    (e.g.,  JimHogg-DC-09-29-RR-Part003-Exhibit1-
1.mp3, JimHogg-DC-09-29-RR-Part003-Exhibit1-2.mp3). 

Otherwise, physical media (e.g., cassettes or other audio-storage devices) may be sent to 
the appellate court if ordered by the court. 

8.10 Video Files. If a court reporter or court recorder electronically files a video that is 
part  of  the  record,  the  video  file  must  be  included  as  an  MPEG-4  Part  14  file  (usually 
referred to as .mp4).  Data compression is encouraged, though the submitter must assure 
that  the  video  and  audio  content  have  sufficient  quality.   The  files  should  not  be 
password-protected, encrypted, or protected by rights management.  Each video file must 
not  exceed  5  GB.    If  the  recording  is  too  long  to  fit  in  one  file,  it  may  be  broken  into 
multiple files.  For an exhibit, each file name must include the applicable elements listed 
in Section 8.4 and, before the .mp4 designation, a hyphen, the word “Exhibit”, the exhibit 
number, and, if there are multiple videos, the file sequence number.  See the examples in 
Section 8.9. 

Otherwise, physical  media (e.g., VHS, DVD, etc.) may be sent  to  the appellate court if 
ordered by the court. 

8.11  Certification.  When electronically filing an Official Reporter’s Record in a court 
that  has  implemented  the  Texas  Appeals  Management  and  E-filing  System  Records 
Submission  Portal  (TAMES  RSP),  the  court  reporter’s  or  court  recorder’s  login  and 
password will serve as the court reporter’s or court recorder’s signature on a certification 
page.  The court reporter or court recorder must also include one  of the following three 
things:  (1)  a  scanned  image  of  the  court  reporter’s  or  court  recorder’s  signature;  (2)  a 
public key-based digital signature; or (3) “/s/” and the court reporter’s or court recorder’s 
name typed in the space where the signature would otherwise appear. 

When  electronically  filing  an  Official  Reporter’s  Record  in  a  court  that  has  not 
implemented  the  TAMES  RSP,  the  court  reporter  or  court  recorder  must  sign  a 
certification  page  with  a:  (1)  scanned  image  of  the  court  reporter’s  or  court  recorder’s 
signature; or (2) public key-based digital signature. 

The  implementation  date  of  the  TAMES  RSP  will  vary  from  court  to  court.    To  determine 
whether a court has implemented the TAMES RSP, check the court’s official website.

Section 9 – Official Reporter’s Record and Freelance Reporter’s Record 
Provided to Parties   

9.1 Electronic Format for Party.  The court reporter or court recorder may provide the 
ordering  party  an  electronic  copy  of  the  Official  Reporter’s  Record  or  the  Freelance 
Reporter’s  Record  in  any  agreed-upon  electronic  format.    If  the  court  reporter  or  court 
recorder  and the  ordering party  cannot  reach agreement, the means for  provision  to  the 
appellate court must be used. 

9.2  Paper  Format  for  Party.    The  court  reporter  or  court  recorder  may  provide  the 
ordering party a paper copy of the Official Reporter’s Record or the Freelance Reporter’s 
Record  in  any  agreed-upon  format.    If  the  court  reporter  or  court  recorder  and  the 
ordering  party  cannot  reach  agreement,  the  means  for  provision  to  the  appellate  court 
must be used.   

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

 

Section 10 – Miscellaneous  

10.1 Preparation and Compilation of Appellate Record.   The court reporter  or court 
recorder must compile, format, and file each appellate record in his or her assigned court, 
unless the appeal at issue is generated from an ancillary court (e.g., drug courts, impact 
courts).  A court reporter or court recorder assigned to an ancillary court must coordinate 
the compilation, formatting, and filing of each appellate record following this manual and 
in a timely manner as provided in rules and law. 

10.2 Case Document For Deputy Officials.  Pursuant to Rule 13.5 of the Texas Rules 
of Appellate Procedure, deputy official reporters (substitute reporters) must file a separate 
case document for each case reported with the clerk of the trial court.  See Figure 31.
