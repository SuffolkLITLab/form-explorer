      <pre>The Supreme Court of Texas 
Personnel Policies 
Adopted as revised May 14, 2012 

Vacation and Sick Leave 

Vacation and sick leave allowances and policies are subject to change to conform with the 
laws  and  policies  of  the  State  of  Texas.    More  detailed  information  is  available  at 
http://www.hr.sao.state.tx.us/. 

Leave will be charged in thirty (30) minute increments. Absences of less than thirty minutes 

will be made up by mutual agreement between an employee and his or her supervisor. 

All  employees  must  timely  submit  leave  forms  for  vacation,  compensatory,  holiday 
compensatory, sick, extended sick, emergency and/or any other leave taken as described below. 
Failure to submit these forms could result in disciplinary action. 

. Leave Increments 

. Leave Forms 

. Vacation Leave 

Vacation leave is accumulated at a certain number of hours per month, depending on the 
length of total state employment. The schedule of accrual also contains the maximum number of 
hours of vacation leave that may be carried from the end of one fiscal  year (August 31) to the 
beginning of the next (September 1). 
 

Vacation with pay may not be taken until the employee has been continuously employed 
with the state for six months. Continuous employment means that no leave without pay has been 
taken.  Employees will normally be permitted to take vacation leave when they request it, provided 
that  it  does  not  disrupt  Court  activities.  Vacation  leave  requests  should  be  submitted  to  an 
employee’s supervisor in advance of the date the leave is scheduled to begin. 
 

All hours of unused accumulated vacation leave over an employee’s maximum vacation 
(based on longevity) that are lapsed at the end of the fiscal year will be credited to the employee’s 
sick leave balance as of the first day of the next fiscal year. An employee who retires is entitled to 
service credit in the Employees Retirement System for the member’s vacation and sick leave that 
has accumulated and is unused on the last day of employment. 

. Compensatory/Holiday Compensatory Time 

Most  of  the  employees  of  the  Supreme  Court  are  either  excluded  from  the  Fair  Labor 
Standards  Act  of  1938  (FLSA)  or  are  Exempt  Employees  under  its  provisions.  The  following 
outline  of  compensatory  and  holiday  compensatory  time  provisions  applies  to  excluded  and 
exempt employees.

The  work week begins  at 12:01 a.m. on Sunday  and ends at  midnight  on  the following 
Saturday. Employees may earn compensatory time for any hours recorded in excess of 40 during 
one work week, and which excess hours were authorized in advance by the employee’s supervisor. 
Work  hours  may  be  a  combination  of  paid  leave,  holidays,  and  actual  hours  worked.  The 
compensatory time must be taken within the 12-month period following the end of the work week 
in which the excess hours accrued. 
 

Employees who work on a national or state holiday may earn holiday compensatory time. 
The holiday compensatory time must be taken within the 12-month period following the date of 
the holiday worked. 
 

Compensatory time and holiday compensatory time are accrued at a rate of one hour for 
each  hour  worked.  Employees  will  not  be  paid  for  any  unused  compensatory  or  holiday 
compensatory time earned under this section. 
 

Employees  must  give  reasonable  advance  notice  to  their  supervisor  when  taking 

compensatory and holiday compensatory time off. 

. Sick Leave 

Employees accrue sick leave at the rate of eight hours per month or fraction of a month. 
Sick leave with pay may be taken when an employee is prevented from performing duties because 
of sickness, injury, or pregnancy and confinement. Sick leave may also be taken if an employee 
needs to care for a member of his or her immediate family who is ill. Sick leave may be taken for 
a health care appointment for the employee or for members of the immediate family where those 
persons  cannot  reasonably  be  expected  to  take  themselves.  (This  includes  the  time  required  to 
reach and return from a health care appointment as well as the time spent at the appointment itself.)  

n employee may use up to eight hours of sick leave each calendar year to attend parent-
teacher conference sessions for the employee’s children who are in pre-kindergarten through 12th 
grade.  
 

An employee who adopts a child under three years of age may use the amount of sick leave 
that would be necessary to recover from pregnancy and childbirth, which the Court presumes is 6 
weeks in the absence of documentation otherwise. 
 

When  an  employee  is  unable  to  report  to  work  as  a  result  of  illness  or  a  health  care 
appointment,  the  employee  is  to,  at  the  earliest  practicable  time,  notify  (or  have  someone  else 
notify) his or her supervisor that the employee is unable to report for duty. Upon returning to work, 
the employee should, without delay, complete a sick leave form and present it to the employee’s 
supervisor for approval. 
 

If an employee is ill and will miss work for a continuous period of more than three working 
days, the employee must send his or her supervisor a doctor’s certification or an acceptable written 

  A

statement of facts showing the nature of the illness. If an illness results in the absence of three 
working days or less, the supervisor has the discretion to require documentation of the illness. 
 

Sick leave is not a substitute for vacation, compensatory, or holiday compensatory leave. 
Abuse of sick leave could result in disciplinary action. This may be evident when an employee 
uses sick leave as it is accrued, runs out of leave (unless due to a bona fide, serious health condition 
as  specified  under  the  Family  and  Medical  Leave  Act),  or  consistently  uses  sick  leave  in 
conjunction with holidays or weekends. 
 

An employee who retires is entitled to service credit in the Employees Retirement System 
for the member’s sick leave and accrued leave that has accumulated and is unused on the last day 
of employment. ERS rules will apply to determine the amount of credit. 

. Extended Sick Leave 

An employee who considers it necessary to request sick leave in excess of the amount he 
or she has accrued must submit a written request for such exception to the General Counsel. The 
General Counsel will review the request and may ask for additional information prior to submitting 
the request to the Chief Justice. The Chief Justice may authorize such an exception to sick leave 
on an individual basis after review of the merits and circumstances of each request. Any request 
for extended leave will be judged by the following criteria: 
 

•  The employee must not have abused sick leave in the past. 
•  An  employee  may  be  required  to  expend  all  or  a  portion  of  sick  leave  and/or 

vacation leave before extended sick leave is granted. 

•  Extended  sick  leave  may  be  granted  in  amount  up  to  or  matching,  but  not 
exceeding,  sick  leave  and/or  vacation  leave  expended  by  employee,  up  to  a 
maximum of six calendar weeks. 
 

This policy is in addition to rights conferred by the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act 
(29 U.S.C. 2601-2619, 2651-2654). 

This  policy  incorporates  the  major  provisions  of  the  Family  and  Medical  Leave  Act  of 

. Family and Medical Leave 

1993. 

ligibility 

Employees with 12 months of full-time employment and who have provided at least 1,250 
hours of service during the 12 months before the leave are eligible to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid 
leave per year for the following reasons: 

•  The birth or placement for adoption or foster care of a child; 
•  The  serious  health condition of a spouse, child, or  parent  (such  health  condition 

must meet the conditions of a serious health condition under the FMLA); 

•  An employee's own serious health condition.

These  provisions  apply  equally  to  male  and  female  employees.  A  father,  as  well  as  a 
mother, may take family leave because of the birth or serious health condition of a child. A son, 
as well as a daughter, is eligible for leave to care for a parent. 

ertification and Notice 

Employees must provide certification explaining the serious health condition on which the 
leave request is based. The certification should detail the date on which the condition began; the 
probable  duration  of  the  condition;  appropriate  medical  facts  regarding  the  condition;  if 
appropriate,  a  statement  that  the  employee  is  needed  to  care  for  a  spouse,  parent,  or  child;  a 
statement that the employee's own health condition makes it impossible for him or her to work.  
The Court may require a second medical opinion, at the Court's expense, before granting leave. 
 

To the extent reasonably possible, employees must give 30 days’ advance written notice to 

their supervisor and the General Counsel or designee, of the need for leave. 

ommunications During Family or Medical Leave 

Employees on family leave must report periodically during the leave period on their status 
and intention to return to work. This communication will be made to the employee’s supervisor 
and to the General Counsel. 

arried Employees 

If an employee is married to another employee of the Court, the two employees are limited 
to a combined total of 12 weeks of leave for the birth or adoption of a child or for the care of a sick 
parent. 

ertification for Return to Work 

Employees returning from medical leave caused by their own illness may be required to 
obtain written medical certification from their health care provider that they are able to resume 
work. 
 

This certification should be given to the General Counsel or the employee’s supervisor on 

or before the first working day of the returning employee. 

 

8. Sick Leave Pool 
 

The Supreme Court has established a Sick Leave Pool to allow employees to voluntarily 
transfer earned sick leave to a sick leave pool. An employee is eligible to use the time contributed 
to the Sick Leave Pool if, because of a catastrophic injury or illness, the employee has exhausted 
all the leave time to which that employee is otherwise entitled. 
 

The Employees Retirement System of Texas has defined “catastrophic” in the following 

  C

way:

“A severe condition or combination of conditions affecting the mental or physical 
health  of  the  employee  or  the  employee’s  immediate  family  that  requires  the 
services of a licensed practitioner for a prolonged period of time and that forces the 
employee  to  exhaust  all  leave  time  earned  by  that  employee  and  to  lose 
compensation  from  the  State  for  the  employee.  Licensed  practitioner  means 
practitioner, as defined in the Texas Insurance Code, who is practicing within the 
scope of his or her license. 

mmediate  family  is  defined  as  those  individuals  related  by  kinship,  adoption, 
marriage, or foster children who are so certified by the Texas Department of Human 
Services who are living in the same household or if not in the same household are 
totally dependent upon the employee for personal care or services on a continuing 
basis.” 

se of Sick Leave Pool leave must be authorized by the Chief Justice. Applications for use 
of the Sick Leave Pool leave are to be submitted by written request to the Chief Justice’s designee. 
The Chief Justice’s designee will review the request and may ask for additional information prior 
to submitting the request to the Chief Justice. 
 

Contributions of sick leave to the Sick Leave Pool must be in increments of one or more 
days with the exception of a retiring state employee, who may designate the number of hours to 
be contributed. To contribute time to the Sick Leave Pool, the employee must submit an application 
to the Chief Accountant. 
 

For a copy of the full Sick Leave Pool policy and further information, contact the Chief 

Accountant. 

. Emergency Leave 

n employee may be granted emergency leave for the death of a relative. For purposes of 
this  subsection,  “relative”  is  defined  as  the  employee’s  spouse  or  a  parent,  brother,  sister, 
grandparent, grandchild, or child of the employee or of the employee’s spouse. No more than 5 
days of leave will normally be granted per emergency. In addition, the Chief Justice may grant 
emergency leave for good cause.
