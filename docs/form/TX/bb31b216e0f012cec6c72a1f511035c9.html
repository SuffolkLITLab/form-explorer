adies and Gentlemen:  

t is our privilege to submit this report regarding the state of indigent 
defense and accomplishments of the Texas Indigent Defense 
Commission (TIDC) in fiscal year 2021. TIDC and Texas counties 
continue to develop new ways to uphold Texans’ constitutional right 
to counsel in criminal cases amidst COVID-19. Twenty years on from 
the Fair Defense Act, we are continuing to improve processes and 
expand programs that deliver effective and efficient legal 
representation to people who cannot afford it.  

The ongoing support of the Governor and Legislature are critical to 
our success. We appreciate all you do to support TIDC.  

Sincerely, 

haron Keller

Message from the Director 

n 2021, TIDC continued to respond to the pandemic, providing grants 
and training to Texas counties. We sustained and improved public 
defense in Texas by awarding $21.8 million in Formula Grants and 
$11.3 million in Improvement Grants. TIDC monitored 13 counties and 
collected data from all 254. We also collected data and local rules for 
child protective services representation for the first time in Texas 
history. Additionally, TIDC worked with state and local officials to 
provide representation to individuals arrested in connection with 
Operation Lone Star.  

As in-person trials resume and courts begin to chip away at case 
backlogs, our work is far from over. We look forward to a brighter 
2022.  

Sincerely, 

 

Geoff Burkhart 
Executive Director, Texas Indigent Defense Commission

peration Lone Star 

  O

Governor Abbott launched Operation Lone Star in March 2021 
to respond to a rise in illegal immigration. In May, Governor 
Abbott issued a disaster declaration that now covers 53 
counties, mostly counties along or near the border. The 
declaration directed the Department of Public Safety to “use 
available resources to enforce all applicable federal and state 
laws to prevent the criminal activity along the border, including 
criminal trespassing, smuggling, and human trafficking, and to 
assist Texas counties in their efforts to address those criminal 
activities.” The following month, the Governor opened Texas 
Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) facilities for detaining 
arrested persons under Operation Lone Star.   

During the second special legislative session (87(2)), the 
Legislature appropriated funds for Operation Lone Star, 
including funding for indigent defense. Since Operation Lone 
Star’s inception, TIDC’s Board has met several times to award 
grant funding to indigent defense organizations functioning 
under Operation Lone Star. These grants have included funding 
for the Lubbock Private Defender Office (LPDO) to serve as the 
Indigent Defense Hub for Operation Lone Star, as well as 
funding for myPadilla to provide advisals pursuant to the United 
States Supreme Court’s decision in Padilla v. Kentucky.   

Under Administrative Order 21-9104, the Texas Supreme Court 
directed TIDC to develop procedures for Operation Lone Star 
indigent defense representation. This Order was renewed under 
Texas Supreme Court Order 21-9157. TIDC will continue to 
protect the right to counsel and improve public defense in 
Operation Lone Star.

The 87th Texas Legislature appropriated TIDC $95 million for the 
FY22-23 biennium. This restored the 5% cut required of the previous 
FY21-22 biennium in which the TIDC budget was reduced from $94.4 
million to $89.9 million.  

TIDC plans to invest the new funds in improvements to Texas indigent 
defense system, including new public defender offices, managed 
assigned counsel systems, indigent defense coordinators, and 
technological innovations. Out of the amount budgeted, $5 million is 
earmarked for mental health representation through public defender 
offices. 

Key Legislation Passed 
During its legislative workgroup, TIDC developed ten legislative 
proposals to improve public defense. Of those proposals, HB 295 was 
signed into law during the 87th Legislative Session. The law amended 
the Government Code to allow TIDC to directly fund indigent defense 
and support services at nonprofit organizations. This has allowed TIDC 
to fund organizations like the Texas RioGrande Legal Aid’s public 
defender offices, as well as the Lubbock Public Defender Office to 
provide representation in OLS cases.

o promote compliance with the Fair Defense Act and build more 

efficient and effective systems, TIDC tracks indigent defense 
expenditures, provides funding to counties through formula and 
improvement grants, and contracts with innocence projects.  

Indigent Defense Expenditures 

In FY21, Texas counties reported spending $274.9 million on indigent 
defense, a slight increase from the previous year. However, indigent 
defense spending is still lower than pre-pandemic levels. 

TIDC disbursed $35,596,510 in indigent defense grants to counties, 
offsetting approximately 13% of county costs statewide. Pending 
grant award obligations total $11,859,207. 

In addition to TIDC grants, counties reported receiving the following 
reimbursements for indigent defense costs: 

•  From defendants: 9,536,138.19 
•  From the Texas Comptroller for writs of habeas corpus in death 

penalty cases: $2,000.00 

•  From non-TIDC government funds: $69,030.00

ormula Grants 

Formula grants provide statewide support for indigent defense and 
are awarded annually to all qualifying counties. Amounts are based on 
a county’s percentage of state population and indigent defense 
expenses. In FY21, TIDC awarded $22 million in formula grants to 254 
counties, representing 43% of total grants disbursed.  

Formula grant disbursements for FY21 are listed in Appendix A.

Improvement Grants 

Improvement grants develop and sustain programs, encourage 
innovation, remedy noncompliance with the Fair Defense Act, or help 
counties facing extraordinary indigent defense costs. In FY21, TIDC 
awarded 43 new or continuing program grants, totaling $28.7 
million. It has disbursed $13.6 million so far, with an additional $11.9 
million in pending award obligations.   

Improvement grant awards and disbursements for FY21 are listed in 
Appendix B.

Improvement Grant Highlights  

•  Regional Public Defender Offices 

TIDC provides sustainability funding covering 2/3 of counties’ costs for 
participating in rural regional public defender programs, ensuring 
reliable access to quality counsel in these areas. In FY20, TIDC awarded 
$14.8 million to non-capital regional defender offices and $3.2 
million to the Regional Public Defender Office (RPDO) for Capital 
Cases, which served 183 small- and mid-sized counties.   

•  Mental Health Public Defense 

During the 86th Session, the Legislature directed TIDC to award $5 
million per biennium to mental health defender offices. In FY21, TIDC 
awarded these grants to public defenders and managed assigned 
counsel programs in Bexar, Cameron, Dallas, Galveston, McLennan, 
Webb, El Paso, and Harris Counties. These specialized programs 
identify clients’ unmet mental health needs and advocate for 
outcomes that link them with services, treatment, and support that 
help them succeed in the community. 

Innocence Project Contracts 

TIDC funds innocence projects at six public law schools in Texas, 
providing up to $100,000 annually to each school. Law students work 
under attorney supervision to review actual innocence claims from 
Texas inmates. Reports are available on TIDC’s website.

New Grant-Funded Programs 

62 counties have public defender offices (PDO) or managed assigned counsel (MAC) programs or both.  
7 counties have new programs funded by TIDC grants during FY21. 

A full list of PDOs and MACs is at tidc.texas.gov/systems. 

   

tidc.texas.gov/Oversight 

TIDC oversees indigent defense processes across Texas by reviewing 
data from all 254 counties and conducting on-site reviews in targeted 
counties. Complaints can trigger further review.

Fiscal Monitoring 

Indigent Defense Expenditure Reports 

County auditors and treasurers are required by the Fair Defense Act to 
submit indigent defense expenditure reports (IDERs) to TIDC each 
year. TIDC reviews each county’s report.  

IDERs provide Texans with some of the best indigent defense data in 
the nation, driving indigent defense policy and funding decisions. Key 
trends from the IDER are on pages 17. Full reports are available at 
tidc.tamu.edu/public.net. 

Fiscal Monitoring Reviews 

To accurately inform policy- and grant-making decisions, TIDC 
monitors whether counties’ indigent defense expenses are 
documented in compliance with Texas statutes and rules. Counties are 
selected for a monitoring review based on objective risk assessment 
scores and geographic distribution.

In FY21, TIDC opened 8 fiscal monitoring reviews. Reports are 
available at tidc.texas.gov/oversight/. Common findings included: 

•  Reports not prepared in manner required 
•  Court and civil expenses were claimed as indigent defense 

expenses 

•  Attorney payments did not follow the fee schedule

Policy Monitoring 

Indigent Defense Plans 

Criminal court judges and juvenile boards are required by the Fair 
Defense Act to submit countywide indigent defense plans to TIDC 
each odd-numbered year. In FY21, TIDC continued its review of each 
county’s plans, ensuring that they follow state statutes and rules for 
appointing counsel. Plans are available at tidc.tamu.edu/public.net. 

Policy Monitoring Reviews 

TIDC monitors whether counties follow their plans and the Fair 
Defense Act. Counties are selected for a monitoring review based on 
objective risk assessment scores and geographic distribution, or at the 
request of a local official or complaint.  

In FY21, TIDC continued reviews online, collecting records and 
observing court remotely, and began reviews in-person again. It 
conducted policy monitoring reviews in 9 different counties and 
issued 2 reports, available at tidc.texas.gov/oversight/.

FY21 Indigent Defense Caseloads 

Under professional rules, attorneys must spend enough time on each case to perform their basic duties 
to clients. TIDC has weighted caseload guidelines at tidc.texas.gov/caseloads. In FY21: 

•  A total of 4,917 attorneys were reported to have been paid for one or more indigent defense 

cases. Of these, 517 attorneys (11% of attorneys) had appointed caseloads above the 
guidelines. Attorneys with caseloads above the guidelines: 

o  Handled appointed cases in 205 counties (81% of counties). 

o  Handled 39% of appointed cases (135,678 cases). 

•  Two attorneys had caseloads greater than 5 times the guidelines. Twenty-six attorneys had 

caseloads greater than 3 times the guidelines. 

•  The median indigent defense caseload was 25% of the guidelines.  

The above counts do not include juvenile and capital defense cases, retained work, or civil 
appointments (like child protection). Attorneys are required by statute to report each year their 
estimated practice time dedicated to indigent defense. In FY21: 

•  73% of attorneys who were paid for indigent defense cases submitted the report. 

•  Adjusted for practice time estimates, 1,265 attorneys had total caseloads (including retained 

and civil work) above the guidelines. 
 

FY21 Indigent Defense Investigation 

Under professional guidelines, attorneys should investigate the facts of their client’s case.  
Recommendations for investigation time are in the guidelines at tidc.texas.gov/caseloads. In FY21: 

•  133 counties (52% of counties) statewide spent $0 on investigators.  

o  Most were small counties, under 50,000 population. 68% of small counties (127 

counties), spent $0 on investigation. 

o  Counties that spent $0 on investigation had 7% of all indigent defense cases and 7% of 

the state’s population.

tidc.texas.gov/Improvement 

TIDC works to improve public defense in Texas through publications, 
training, mentorship, and technical assistance. 

Training 
TIDC training and presentations were attended by over 1,500 people 
in FY21; the full list is in Appendix F. Highlights include: 

•  Chief Public Defender Meetings, for the chief public 

defenders and MAC chiefs across Texas 

•  Virtual Workshop: Magistration in the Time of Covid, for 

•

In FY20, TIDC received a federal Byrne Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) 
through the Governor’s Office, making it the first JAG project in Texas 
dedicated to indigent defense. In FY21, TIDC partnered with the Texas 
Criminal Defense Lawyers Association (TCDLA) and National Juvenile 
Defender Center to train and certify 16 attorneys in the Juvenile 
Training Immersion Program (JTIP). Those attorneys will begin 
training others across the state during the next fiscal year.  

With it’s interactivity and curriculum, there has been positive feedback 
from trainers and participants alike. TIDC will continue to support this 
first-of-its-kind training.

"I enjoyed all the new tactics I learned. Everyone was very 
transparent and the small group sessions were awesome.” 

“I loved the small breakouts. I really enjoyed the punctual 
feedback.” 

“I appreciated learning the law[s,] but then being able to 
apply the[m].” 

Mentorship 

   

 

 

 

 In FY21, TIDC offered continuing support 
and training to its first two classes of 
attorneys in the Future Indigent Defense 
Leaders (FIDL) program. Through FIDL, 
promising new criminal defense attorneys 
receive mentorship and training. Attorneys 
are paired with a local mentor and receive 
nationally recognized training from Gideon’s 

Promise and TCDLA. TIDC holds monthly roundtables with the 
mentoring pairs and funds the Harris County Public Defender’s Office 
to provide ongoing support. 

Technical Assistance 

TIDC advises counties on how to comply with 
the Fair Defense Act and build more effective 
indigent defense systems, by answering 
questions about data reporting, conducting 
site visits to assess local processes, and 
writing planning studies for new programs. 

In FY21, TIDC prepared three planning 
studies for public defender offices or 
managed assigned counsel programs in 6 
counties, with one resulting in the new Bexar 
County MAC. The new Galveston Misdemeanor Mental Health Public 
Defender Office and 5-county Hill Country Regional Public Defender 
Office were awarded FY21 grants, and TIDC provided technical 
assistance to set up those offices.

In FY21, TIDC was funded primarily from the GR-Dedicated Fair Defense Account (Fund 5073). Funds 
accrue to the Fair Defense Account from the following sources: 

•  Consolidated Court Costs: Defendants pay Consolidated Court Costs upon conviction for a 

range of offenses from fine-only misdemeanors to felonies. 

• 

Juror Pay Court Costs: Part of defendants’ consolidated court costs reimburse counties for 
juror pay. The remainder of this fund in excess of $10 million is transferred to the Fair Defense 
Account at year’s end. TIDC has not received these funds. 

•  State Bar Fees: The State Bar of Texas assesses a $65 fee as part of each attorney’s annual bar 

dues. Half of the proceeds are allocated to the Fair Defense Account. 

•  Surety Bond Fees: Defendants pay a $15 fee when posting a surety bond. One-third of the fee 

goes to the Fair Defense Account.  

Fair Defense Account Sources 

Appendix D: Method of Finance 

   

Pre-pandemic, court cost collections declined steadily at about 2% per year. Covid accelerated this 
trend, with approximate revenue losses of $7 million in court cost collections each year to the Fair 
Defense Account. In the second year of the pandemic, TIDC also saw over $5 million in revenue losses 
 
from juror pay costs.
