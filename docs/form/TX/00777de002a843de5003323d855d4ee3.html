Here are some quick tips on best practices for handling cases involving self-represented litigants (SRLs) 
on a remote basis. 

Important Information:

Best Practices for Courts in Zoom Hearings 
Involving Self Represented Litigants 
 

a.  Lack of Internet or  Reliable Internet: Many people  do  not have access  to the internet, or 
reliable internet, in the home. Public access to the internet via libraries, coffee shops, and 
other local options is problematic due to privacy issues and may not currently be an option 
due to stay in place orders. 

b.  Limited Phone Data/Call Minutes: Some people may only have phones with a limited number 
of call minutes or data plan minutes, so they may not be able to use their phones to participate 
in a video hearing or even to participate by phone. You may need to work with the litigant to 
determine  how  they  can  have  meaningful  participation  in  the  hearing.  We  do  not  have  a 
solution for this problem, and welcome your ideas 

c.  Email: Some SRLs may not have email. Those who have an email address may not be able to 
check their email due to a lack of internet access. Those who have access to their email may 
not understand the importance of checking their email regularly for information about their 
case. Please explain the need to check email daily or arrange an alternative way to contact 
SRLs for notice of upcoming hearings. 

d.  Consequences of Failing to Act: Many people do not understand the consequences of failing 
to respond to a case or act timely in a case. Please explain these consequences to litigants. 
e.  Plain Language. When communicating orally or in writing with a SRL, please use language at 
a 3rd grade reading level when possible. Short, clear sentences are best. Avoid legalese (for 
example, most people do not know what “default” means), terms of art, and acronyms. The 
National Association for Court Management developed a Plain Language Guide in 2019 on 
how to incorporate plain language into court forms, websites and other materials that may 
be useful to you. 

f.  Caretaker Responsibilities and Privacy Concerns: Many schools, preschools, day care centers, 
in-home  nursing  care  and  the  like  have  closed.  Due  to  social  distancing  and  stay  at  home 
orders, people may not have access to a friend or family member who can take over these 
responsibilities during a hearing. Be sensitive to a litigant’s ability to participate in a hearing 
without interruption. Privacy concerns are especially important in cases involving domestic 
violence or children in the household. Make reasonable accommodations to address privacy 
concerns and a litigant’s need to give medication to a family member, feed a baby, etc.  

  

2.  Notice of Hearing and Materials to Provide with Notice to SRLs 

a.  Send written notice in plain language by mail to the address on file when possible.   

i.  Comment: Email notice is challenging for the above-mentioned reasons.  

b.  Contents of Notice of Hearing. 

i.  Make sure your form notices state that the hearing will occur by video conferencing 
software, Zoom, and that the party should not to appear in person at the courthouse. 
ii.  Make sure to include basic information on what technology and equipment will be 
needed to participate in the hearing – such as reliable access to the internet, a phone, 

 
Best Practices for Court in Zoom Hearings Involving SRLs, Page 1 

laptop,  tablet,  desktop,  etc.  –  and  what  to  do  if  they  do  not  have  access  to  those 
things. 

iii.  Include a short notice in Spanish, and any other languages that are common in your 
court,  instructing  SRLs  with  limited  English  proficiency  to  contact  the  court  to  get 
language assistance such as translation of the notice and the materials provided with 
the notice. 

c. 

d. 

Instructions on How to Use Zoom + Contact Person: Provide step-by-step instructions in plain 
language on how to access and use Zoom, including contact information for a person who can 
assist them if needed. Email alone is not helpful for those without internet. 
Information on Court Procedure + Contact Person:  Provide step-by-step information in plain 
language on court procedure for hearings, including how to submit exhibits for the hearing 
and contact information for a person who can assist them if needed. 

i.  Note: TAJC has included basic information on court processes and procedure in its 
Tips  for  Self-Represented  Litigants  in  Zoom  Hearings  that  can  be  modified  to 
accommodate your local rules and processes and distributed to litigants. 

e.  Provide a way for SRLs to inform the court of the following: 

i.  Their phone number and email address, if any; 
ii.  Lack of internet or reliable internet; 
iii.  Lack of ability or limited ability to access the hearing by phone; 
iv.  Lack of ability to submit evidence electronically; 
v.  Lack of childcare or coverage for other caregiver responsibilities;  
vi.  Whether they are ready to have the hearing or need a continuance; 
vii.  How long they think the hearing or trial will take to present their side of the story, 

viii.  Whether  they  need  any  ADA  accommodations  (Coming  Soon  –  an  addendum  on 

including witnesses and evidence; 

accommodations); 

ix.  Whether they, or a witness, needs an interpreter, and if so, what language(s); and 
x.  How many witnesses they want to testify on their behalf. 

f.  Develop a Plan B 

i.  Develop a way to handle hearings involving SRLs or parties without reliable access to 

the internet, phone, tablet, laptop or desktop computer. 

ii.  Develop a plan for handling virtual hearings when technological difficulties make it 

impractical to continue the hearing. 

g.  Provide a list of legal resources serving your area: 

i.  2019-2020 State Bar Referral Directory. The Legal Access Division of the State Bar of 
Texas publishes a list of local and statewide legal aid and pro bono providers as well 
as lawyer referral services in their Referral Directory. 

ii.  Texas Law Help. The Texas Legal Services Center, a legal aid organization, hosts Texas 
Law  Help,  a  website  that  provides  free  information  and  resources,  including  a 
LiveChat feature for low-income people.  

 

3.  Hearings: 

a.  At the beginning of the hearing: 

i.  Address potential technical difficulties.  

1.  Ask litigants about the reliability of their computer, internet, or phone.  
2.  Tell  litigants  what  to  do  if  they  experience  problems  with  their  internet, 
computer, or phone, such as instructing the litigant to click on the Zoom link 
again  if  their  connection  drops,  or  to  call  back  in  to  the  Zoom  number 
provided. 

 
Best Practices for Court in Zoom Hearings Involving SRLs, Page 2 

3.  Provide litigant with a call back number not associated with the Zoom hearing 

in case they cannot reconnect. 

4.  Obtain the litigant’s phone number or other emergency contact in case it is 

needed. 

ii.  Assess need for ADA accommodations or an interpreter.  

1.  Ask litigant if they need ADA accommodations or an interpreter. 
2.  Address as needed. 

iii.  Caretaker responsibilities and privacy issues.   

1.  Ask litigant if there any caregiver responsibilities or privacy issues.  
Invite them to let you know if these issues arise during the hearing. 
2. 

iv.  Overview of hearing.  

1.  Review what will happen during the hearing in plain language. 
2.  Provide information about the proceeding and any procedural requirements 
involved, including how to upload evidence. If the litigant is participating by 
phone only, tell the litigant how to provide their evidence to the court. 

i.  Oath. If a party is unable to participate by video, have them recite the oath while on 
the phone rather than require a notary. It is impossible to have a notary present when 
stay  in  place  orders  exist.  Additionally,  if  the  litigant  does  not  have  access  to  the 
internet at home or a computer, they likely do not have the funds to pay a notary. 
ii.  Reasonable  Accommodations.  A  judge  may  make  reasonable  accommodations  to 
ensure  all  litigants  the  right  to  be  heard  without  violating  the  duty  to  remain 
impartial. A judge may consider the totality of the circumstances, including the type 
of case, the nature and stage of the proceeding, and the training, skill, knowledge, 
and experience of the persons involved when making reasonable accommodations.  
For example, a judge may:  

1.  Construe pleadings and briefs liberally, 
2.  Ask neutral questions to elicit or clarify information, 
3.  Modify  the  mode  and  order  of  evidence  as  permitted  by  the  rules  of 

procedure and evidence, including allowing narrative testimony, 

b.  During the hearing: 

4.  Explain the basis for a ruling, and/or 
5. 

Inform litigants what will be happening next in the case and what is expected 
of them. 
c.  At the end of the hearing 

i.  Litigant’s email address.  

1. 

2. 

If  litigant  has  access  to  reliable  internet  at  home  (not  through  a  library  or 
public place), ask litigant if they have an email address.  
If so, tell them that notices of future court hearings will be emailed to the 
email address they gave you.  

3.  Admonish  them  to  check  it  daily  and  warn  them  of  the  consequences  of 

missing a hearing. 

4.  Tell  them  how  to  contact  the  court  if  their  access  to  internet  or  phone 
number changes while their case is pending. Many people will lose access to 
their  phones  and  internet  if  they  lose  income  due  to  COVID-19.  If  that 
happens, they will need to receive notices by mail. 

ii.  Review next steps. Tell the litigants what will happen next, what is expected of them, 

and inform them of the next hearing date, if known.

Appendix A 
Accommodations for Persons with Disabilities 
By Brian East, Senior Attorney, Disability Rights Texas 

     

Introduction 

1. 
 

The ADA and other laws apply to state and local courts,1 as well as to attorneys.2 These laws prohibit 
disability discrimination, and generally require that courts and lawyers provide equal access and an 
equal experience. Specific obligations include: 

•  Providing auxiliary aids and services (e.g., interpreters, captioning) to ensure effective 

communication 

•  Providing accessible electronic and web content 
•  Providing reasonable modifications to policies and practices 
•  Avoiding criteria or methods of administration that have a discriminatory impact (whether 

done directly or via contracts, etc.) 

.  Give instructions for requesting modifications or auxiliary aids and services 

Invite people to ask for any modifications or auxiliary aids and services 

• 
•  Describe in detail how parties should make the request 
•  Do not require a specific form or rigid adherence to the court’s preferred process for 

requesting accommodations 

•  Avoid inflexible deadlines if possible 
•  Make sure the information is available in accessible formats 

.  When attorney, party, or witness is blind or has low vision  

•  Ensure that web pages are accessible to and usable by screen-reader technology3  
•  Use a video platform that is usable by screen-reader technology (Zoom is considered 

generally accessible to blind individuals who use screen readers) 

•  Make sure that any documents being used, including exhibits, are in accessible formats 
o  Word and PowerPoint documents have built in accessibility checkers 
o  PDF documents are only accessible if the Select Text function works (i.e., OCR)   

•  Ensure, to the extent possible, that any documents are circulated in advance 

o  Understand that Share Screen functions may not work for individuals who are blind 
o  Understand that functions done during the hearing such as zooming in and 

highlighting may not translate  

•  Design any kiosks with accessible features (e.g., “talking,” etc.)4 

                                                          
1 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1). 
2 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7)(F). 
3 An accessible website generally means it complies with WCAG 2.0 Level AA. See 1 T.A.C. § 206.70(a). See also 
Accessibility Policy of the Texas Judicial System is online at https://www.txcourts.gov/site-policies/accessibility-
policy/.  
4 For an example of an accessible kiosk, see the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design, Sec. 707 (“Automatic 
Teller Machines and Fare Machines”), available online at 
https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/2010ADAStandards/2010ADAstandards.htm#pgfId-1006537.

.  When attorney, party, or witness is deaf or hard of hearing 

•  Determine the primary or preferred method of communicating (e.g., American Sign 

Language; Signed Exact English, real-time captioning [CART], etc.) 
•  Have ongoing contracts with interpreting and captioning services 
•  When the primary method of communication is sign language:5 

o  Remember state law requirements for interpreters6 
o  Arrange for interpreter team to join video hearing as official interpreters 
o  Ensure that interpreters are court-certified and fluent in the relevant sign language 
o  Do not use the telephone “relay” service for interpreting 
o  Do not use back and forth writing with deaf individuals unless they request it 
o  Do not rely on lip-reading 
o  Avoid using TTD or TTY machines 

• 

If the deaf individual has an attorney or advocate: 

o  Ask attorney/advocate if she will be using a “table” interpreter (i.e., a separate 

interpreter for private discussions) 

o  Be prepared to place advocate, client, and table interpreters into a private “room” 

for confidential discussions 

•  For real-time captioning:7 

o  Use a professional CART provider rather than assuming a court reporter can do it 
o  Avoid automated captioning services or programs 

• 

Lip-reading: 

o  Do not rely on lip-reading for deaf individuals who primarily communicate by sign 
o  Occasionally, individuals who are hard of hearing (and particularly those who do not 
sign) do use lip-reading as part of their communication process, and if that is the 
case, make sure that speakers are close enough to the camera and well lit.  

.  Other Common Modifications/Accommodations  

•  Recognize that some individuals will use a telephone to connect, and may have no webcam. 
•  Ensure that materials and information use plain language. 
•  Even after courts re-open, consider remote attendance if needed as a reasonable 

accommodation because some people have the needed equipment at home and prefer to 
use it due to familiarity, etc. 
If remote attendance is impossible, consider continuing the hearing to a time that minimizes 
risk of exposure to COVID-19. 
If remote attendance is impossible, consider relocating to a place that allows more 
distancing.

Appendix B 
Language Access and Remote Interpretation 
 

itigants and other court patrons who have limited English proficiency need language assistance services 
such as interpretation and translation to access the courts and resolve their legal problems. The same 
laws and rules about language access in Texas courts still apply when courts are partially closed and 
many proceedings are virtual. Below is a recap of the relevant law and some quick tips on best practices 
for how to provide meaningful access to justice for LEP persons in remote hearings. Many of these 
recommendations are also best practices under normal circumstances.

1. 

Important Terms 

• 

• 

• 

Limited English Proficient – Individuals who do not speak English as their primary language 
and who have limited ability to read, speak, write, or understand English can be limited 
English proficient, or "LEP." It is important to note that someone can be English proficient in 
certain contexts but not in others. For example, they may know enough English to 
accomplish basic tasks like small talk and grocery shopping, but not enough to understand 
what the teacher is saying at a parent conference or participate in a court proceeding. The 
English proficiency needed in legal settings is much higher than what most people need in 
typical daily encounters, which is why legal information and court proceedings can be 
difficult even for many native English speakers to understand, and why people who know 
some English often need language assistance services in court. See below for some sample 
questions to help you assess whether a person would benefit from an interpreter in court. 
Language access – An umbrella term encompassing the idea that people with limited English 
proficiency (LEP) are entitled to meaningful access to programs and services. It implies the 
existence of laws and policies and the availability of services and supports to ensure that 
access is not significantly restricted, delayed, or inferior as compared to English proficient 
individuals. 
Interpretation – When a competent interpreter listens to something in one language 
(source language) and orally translates it into another language (target language).  

•  Translation – When a competent translator renders written text from one language (source 

language) into an equivalent written text in another language (target language). 
•  Sight translation - The reading of text written in one language (source language) by a 

competent interpreter who orally translates it into another language (target language).  
•  Vital document - A document that contains information critical for obtaining access to 

justice. Some examples of vital documents that courts may need to translate to ensure that 
LEP individuals are provided meaningful access can include information about and 
applications for programs, benefits, or services; intake forms; court forms; consent or 
complaint forms; notices of rights; letters or notices that require a response or responsive 
action; or orders that prohibit or compel conduct; and information about language 
assistance services.  

•  Simultaneous interpretation - When a competent interpreter listens to something in one 
language (source language) and orally translates it into another language (target language) 
in real-time without pauses. 

•  Consecutive interpretation – When a competent interpreter listens to something in one 

language (source language) and orally translates it into another language (target language) 
while the speaker pauses to allow for the interpretation before continuing.

2.  State and Federal Law  

itle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 
Title VI and its implementing regulations prohibit national origin discrimination in court programs 
and services, whether criminal, civil, or administrative.8 The regulations prohibit discriminatory 
conduct such as providing a service or benefit that is different, or provided in a different manner, 
from what is provided to others under the program or that restricts in any way the enjoyment of any 
advantage or privilege enjoyed by others under the program on the basis of national origin.9  The 
regulations also prohibit administering programs in a manner that has the effect of discriminating in 
those ways or “substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program” based on 
national origin.10  In 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court held that Title VI’s prohibition against 
discrimination on the basis of national origin includes discrimination against LEP individuals based 
on language.11  

his means that courts must “ensure that LEP parties and witnesses receive competent language 
services … At a minimum, every effort should be taken to ensure competent interpretation for LEP 
individuals during all hearings, trials, and motions during which the LEP individual must and/or may 
be present.” In situations where courts typically rely on written communication, translating 
documents that are vital to providing meaningful access is also required.12 Language assistance must 
be provided free of charge.13   

Texas Government Code Chapter 57 
Section 57.002 defines when a judge must appoint a licensed court interpreter14 and when a judge 
may appoint an unlicensed court interpreter. It also describes the minimum criteria an unlicensed 
interpreter must meet to be appointed in a court proceeding. It applies to all courts and both civil 
and criminal proceedings. Because the language of the statute has become somewhat convoluted 
over the years, we have summarized its requirements in the charts below for simplicity’s sake.  

he first chart illustrates when a judge is required to appoint an interpreter and when the judge has 
discretion to appoint an interpreter. The second chart is for after a judge decides to appoint an 
interpreter either because a motion was filed, a request was made, or the judge decided sua sponte 
that an interpreter is needed to provide meaningful access to the proceeding for an LEP person. It 
illustrates when a judge must appoint a licensed court interpreter and when a court has discretion 
to appoint an unlicensed court interpreter. It also shows what minimum criteria an unlicensed court 
interpreter must meet to interpret in a Texas court proceeding.

14 There are two types of licenses for Texas court interpreters: a basic license that authorizes you to interpret in 
municipal and justice courts, and a master license that authorizes you to interpret in any Texas court. When you 
hire a licensed interpreter, be sure they hold the appropriate license for your court.

15 Tex. Gov. Code. Sec. 57.002(a). 
16 Tex. Gov. Code Sec. 57.001(7) states a “court proceeding” “includes an arraignment, deposition, mediation, 
court-ordered arbitration, or other form of alternative dispute resolution.” 
17 Tex. Gov. Code Sec. 57.002(b). Note the statute does not specify that the person must be a party or a witness. 
An example of a situation where a court may elect to appoint an interpreter for an LEP person who is not a party or 
witness is when the parent of a minor who is a party or witness has limited English proficiency and needs an 
interpreter to comprehend the proceeding affecting his or her child. In some cases involving minors, state law 
includes parents and guardians in the definition of “party” or “plaintiff,” but the court may appoint an interpreter 
for the parent even in cases where they are not explicitly a “party.”

Code of Criminal Procedure 38.30  
Requires a court to appoint an interpreter upon a party’s motion or upon the court’s motion if the 
accused or a witness does not have English proficiency.20 Before Section 57.002 became law, “any 
person” could be appointed as an interpreter in criminal proceedings regardless of their 
qualifications. However, as of 2001, when a court appoints an interpreter in a criminal proceeding, 
the interpreter must fulfill the requirements of 57.002.21 The statute also requires the county to pay 
for the interpreter in criminal proceedings. 

exas Rule of Civil Procedure 183 
A court may appoint an interpreter and may tax the interpreter fee as costs unless the law provides 
otherwise or the litigant has filed an uncontested Statement of Inability to Afford Costs pursuant to 
Tex. R. Civ. Proc. 145.  

exas Rule of Civil Procedure 145 
A party who files a Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs cannot be required to

to pay costs issued after an oral evidentiary hearing. “Costs” as defined by Rule 145 include the fees

Payment of Court Costs must not be charged for the language assistance services they need to have 
meaningful access to the court. 

oom 
Interpretation can be provided remotely in virtual proceedings on Zoom both simultaneously and 
consecutively.22 Zoom allows for simultaneous interpretation by providing a separate audio channel 
that only the LEP person will hear. You can also use “breakout” rooms when an interpreter is 
needed for an attorney and client to have a private conversation during a proceeding. See Appendix 
C, How to Use Simultaneous Interpretation in Zoom Proceedings for detailed instructions about 
remote interpretation in Zoom for more information about scheduling the proceeding with an 
interpreter and using the interpreter controls during the proceeding.  

 

What to do Before the Proceeding 

•  Notice – As mentioned in the Best Practices for Court in Zoom Hearings Involving SRLs, 

include with your notice Spanish (and any other languages common in your jurisdiction) 
instructions about how to contact the court for language assistance. Using an interpreter 
icon can also help LEP persons who speak languages other than Spanish or who have low 
literacy. Language assistance may include translation or sight translation of the notice and 
interpretation for the proceeding(s).  

•  The LEP Person – When you learn an LEP person will need an interpreter for a remote 

proceeding, confirm their preferred language to ensure you select an interpreter that will be 
able to communicate with them. Be sure to find out if they need any specific dialect. Some 
languages vary greatly between dialects. Also determine if the person has the technology 
they need to participate remotely. The simultaneous interpretation feature in Zoom will 
only work if the LEP person is able to join via the internet through a computer or other 
device. It will not work if they call in over the phone. They will need stable access to the 
internet and the latest version of Zoom to participate.23 If they don’t, you can still use a 
remote interpreter via Zoom, but the interpretation will need to be consecutive instead of 
simultaneous and you will need to plan for a longer proceeding.  

•  The Interpreter  

o  Selecting an Interpreter: After confirming the preferred language of the LEP person, 
you will need to select an interpreter. If you already have an interpreter for your 
court in the language you need, this will be easy. If not, you may be able to find an 
interpreter through an existing contract your court or county already has, or you 
may need to hire an interpreter independently. If the language is Spanish and the 
proceeding is going to be short, you can use OCA’s Texas Court Remote Interpreter 
Service (TCRIS) to schedule a free interpreter. For remote proceedings you also have 
the option of hiring licensed interpreters from anywhere in the state.24 Similarly,

22 Most Texas courts are using Zoom for remote proceeding so we are focusing on Zoom here. If your court is using 
a different platform such as WebEx and you need help developing protocols for remote interpretation, you may 
contact the Texas Access to Justice Commission by emailing atjmail@texasatj.org.  
23 Some of the earlier versions of Zoom do not include the interpreter function. 
24 Other options for finding competent interpreters are the Texas Association of Judiciary Interpreters and 
Translators, Metroplex Interpreters and Translators Association, Houston Interpreters and Translators Association, 

 
Best Practices for Court in Zoom Hearings Involving SRLs, Page 10 

where the law allows you to hire an unlicensed interpreter and a licensed one is not 
available, you can hire an interpreter from anywhere without incurring travel costs. 
Just remember that even unlicensed interpreters must meet the minimum 
requirements in Section 57.002.  

o  Sample Questions to Help Assess Interpresters: These questions can be used to 
assess an interpreter you are considering hiring for a proceeding or to assess an 
interpreter prior to appointing them and swearing them in during the proceeding.25 

  Are you a Texas licensed court interpreter? 
  What is your license level and number? 
  How long have you been an interpreter? 
  How many times have you interpreted in court? 
  What credentials or specialized training do you hold? 
  Describe the Texas Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility for 

Licensed Court Interpreters.  

o  Best Practice Tip: Please note that if the proceeding is expected to be long or 
complex, the best practice is to hire two interpreters to interpret as a team by 
switching off approximately every 30 minutes. This is because the cognitive load of 
interpreting for long stretches is very taxing and the longer an interpreter 
interprets, the more likely they are to make mistakes. In fact, the accuracy of most 
interpreters begins to show a measurable decline after 30 minutes of interpreting. 
The cognitive load of remote interpretation is even higher than on-site 
interpretation, so team interpretation may be even more useful for longer remote 
proceedings. Taking regular breaks is another option if you are unable to use an 
interpreter team for a long or complex proceeding. 

o  Technology Needs for Interpreter: In addition to ensuring that the interpreter you 
select meets the requirements of Section 57.002, for remote proceedings you will 
also want to ensure that they have what they need to minimize the chances of any 
problems with the technology that could cause a delay. For example, they will need 
a computer or other device, webcam, headset and the latest version of Zoom on 
their device, as well as stable internet access and a place to work with minimal 
background noise and distractions. If they have never used Zoom for remote 
interpretation before, you may wish to arrange a practice run with them prior to the 
proceeding to ensure everything is going to work properly.26  

o  Provide Pleadings or Documents: Provide the interpreter with the pleadings or other 
documents that are relevant to the proceeding to familiarize themselves with 
names, parties, and unique vocabulary. 
Inform Litigant: Once you have arranged for the interpreter, let the litigant know in 
their preferred language that you have done so. Knowing there will be an 
interpreter can help reduce the anxiety for the litigant and give them an opportunity 
to focus on other aspects of preparing for their proceeding.

During the Proceeding 

•  See Appendix C, How to Use Simultaneous Interpretation in Zoom Proceedings for detailed 
information about using the interpretation features and conducting a remote hearing in 
Zoom.  

•  Explain the role of the interpreter to the LEP person including the following: 

o  The interpreter will interpret everything said in the proceeding with no additions, 

omissions, explanations, or personal input. 

o  The interpreter cannot give advice, make suggestions, or engage in private 

conversation with the LEP person.  

o  The LEP person should raise a hand if s/he has a question or does not understand 
something during the proceeding rather than asking the interpreter to explain it. 
•  Perform a sound check including allowing the interpreter and LEP party to assess whether 

they can hear and understand each other.  
Instruct participants on these best practices before you begin: 

• 

o  Speak slowly, clearly, and one at a time. Whenever possible use plain language and 

avoid “legalese” and unnecessary terms of art.  

o  Speak directly to the participants as you normally would in court, not to the 

interpreter. 

o  Do not ask the interpreter to explain or restate what the LEP person said. 
o  During consecutive interpretation such as witness testimony, use short, complete 
sentences and pause after each complete thought to allow for interpretation.  
o  Open any statement to the interpreter with “Mr./Ms./Mx. [Interpreter Name]” or 
“Mr./Ms./Mx. Interpreter” to alert the interpreter that they are being addressed. 

o  Encourage the interpreter to request repetitions or clarifications as needed 

throughout the proceeding. 

o 

o  Attorneys representing LEP litigants may use a Zoom breakout room to consult with 
their client if necessary. If they need an interpreter, the interpreter will be able to 
join them in the breakout room. 
Immediately alert the court if they are unable to hear or understand the participant 
who is speaking, or if the equipment they are using is not working properly. 
Instruct all participants about what to do if they get disconnected due to a problem 
with the internet or other technology including providing contact information for a 
staff person who will be responsive if needed. 

o 

o  Give basic instructions about what the participants can expect and need to do to use 

the interpreter mode in Zoom. 

•  Ask the interpreter to say and spell their name for the record and what type of license they 

hold, if any, and to state their license number for the record. 

•  Administer the interpreter’s oath.27 
•  Red Flags: During simultaneous interpretation only the LEP person will hear the 

interpretation, but during consecutive interpretation be aware of these red flags that may 
indicate poor quality interpretation: 

o  The interpretation is much longer or much shorter than what was said in the source 

language. 

                                                           
27 Tex. R. Evidence 604 requires that interpreters are qualified and take an oath. Sample interpreter’s oath: “Do 
you solemnly swear or affirm that you will interpret accurately, completely and impartially, using your best skill 
and judgment in accordance with the standards prescribed by law and the Code of Ethics and Professional 
Responsibility; follow all official guidelines established by this court for legal interpreting; and discharge all of the 
duties and obligations of legal interpretation?” 

 
Best Practices for Court in Zoom Hearings Involving SRLs, Page 12 

o  The LEP person repeatedly asks for repetition or clarification. 
o  The LEP person appears to be correcting or disagreeing with the interpreter. 
o  The LEP person attempts to speak in English without using the interpreter. 
o  The interpreter doesn’t seem to have a strong command of English. 
o  There are non-verbal cues on the part of the interpreter or LEP person that indicate 

there is some sort of problem. 

o  The interpreter doesn’t appear to take notes, especially for names, numbers, and 

long segments of speech. 

o  The interpreter seems to be engaging in side conversations.  
o  The interpreter has an inappropriate facial expression or tone. This could indicate 

the interpreter is not neutral or is biased in some way that could affect the accuracy 
of the interpretation. 

o  The interpreter answers for the LEP person or attempts to explain or elaborate on 

the LEP person’s answer. 

o  The interpreter attempts to modify or discredit the LEP person’s answer. 
o  The LEP person appears unusually uncomfortable or confused or has an 

inappropriate facial expression or tone. 

•  When Party or Witness Has Difficulty Communicating: If you are in a proceeding without an 
interpreter and a litigant or witness is having difficulty communicating, these are some 
questions you can ask to assess whether an interpreter may be needed. Avoid questions 
that can be answered with a yes or no and try using questions that are slightly more 
complex to approximate the type of language that is common in court. If the person has 
difficulty answering these questions in a meaningful way, an interpreter is recommended. 

o  Please tell the court your name. 
o  How did you arrive at court today? 
o 
o  Tell me about your education. 
o  How comfortable are you proceeding with the matter as we are communicating 

In what language do you feel most comfortable speaking and communicating? 

o  What is the purpose of your court hearing today? 
o  To help me evaluate your English language proficiency, would you be willing to 
describe for me a scenario in which you may have found it challenging to 
communicate effectively in spite of familiarity with the content? 

now?  

 

After the Proceeding 
If there is a written decision or order, especially one that prohibits or compels action of any kind, 
enumerates rights or responsibilities, or requires a response or action to be taken, it is probably a 
vital document that needs to be translated for the LEP person.28

Appendix C 
How to Use Simultaneous Interpretation  
in Zoom Proceedings 

Zoom offers a language interpretation feature that allows interpreters to interpret in the simultaneous 
mode30 while the LEP individual listens to the interpretation on a separate audio channel. When this 
feature is enabled, the other participants do not hear the interpretation.31 
 

2.  Language Interpretation Setup 

To allow Hosts/Schedulers of meetings on your Zoom account to use the interpretation features, enable 
these features in your account settings. 

•  Sign in to the Zoom web portal and click Settings. 
•  Enable Language Interpretation under the In Meeting (Advanced) heading.  

 

1.  Simultaneous Interpretation Function29 

   

3.  Scheduling a Proceeding with an Interpreter 

•  Navigate to Meetings and click Schedule a New Meeting. 
•  Click Generate Automatically next to Meeting ID. This setting is required for language 

interpretation.  

•  Check the box to Enable Language Interpretation for the meeting. 
• 

If you do not know whom the assigned interpreter will be, just click “Schedule” for now.

30 Simultaneous interpretation is a competent interpreter listening to something in one language (source language) 
and orally translating it into another language (target language) in real-time without pauses. Consecutive 
interpretation is a competent interpreter listening to something in one language (source language) and orally 
translating it into another language (target language) while the speaker pauses to allow for the interpretation 
before continuing. 
31 This video demonstrates most of what is covered in these instructions: Using Zoom's Interpretation Features.

• 

If you know whom the interpreter will be, click “+ Add Interpreter” to display the screen below. 
Enter the interpreter’s email address and the language in the second dropdown box keeping the 
first dropdown box as English. The interpreter will need to log on with the same email address 
you enter here, so you may want to confirm that this is the correct email address for their Zoom 
account.32 Click “Schedule” when done. 

 

You can also click the “X” to close out these fields and then click “Schedule.” You MUST 
remember to send the interpreter a Zoom meeting invitation along with the rest of the 
invitees. 

NOTE: Zoom has several pre-set language choices including Chinese, Japanese, German, 
French, Russian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Korean. If you need a language other than one of 
these choices, you will need to designate one of these languages as a “catch-all” language. In 
other words, you can use the interpretation feature even if your language isn’t listed, but you 
will need to be sure everyone involved knows that the controls in Zoom will list a different 
language than what the interpreter will actually be interpreting to ensure that everyone 
selects the correct options in the following steps. 

 

4.  Joining the Zoom Proceeding 

Joining a Zoom proceeding that will involve interpretation works just like joining any other Zoom 
proceeding. The best practice is to download and log into the latest version of Zoom prior to the 

                                                           
32 Interpreters may use the interpreter features with a Basic (free) account as long as the Host has the prerequisite 
Zoom service. See fn 1. 

 
Best Practices for Court in Zoom Hearings Involving SRLs, Page 15 

proceeding, but it is possible to download and run Zoom when the meeting is launching. 

 
Best Practices for Court in Zoom Hearings Involving SRLs, Page 16 

f any of the following situations occur, Zoom’s simultaneous interpretation function WILL NOT work 
and you will need to conduct the hearing with the interpreter using the consecutive mode: 

•  Participant joins by telephone only (no video). 
•  Participant joins by Zoom for video but is using a telephone for audio. 
•  Participant joins through the meeting link via their web browser. 
•  Participant joins using a Chromebook.33 

5.  Getting Started 

Once the hearing begins but before the Host enables the simultaneous interpretation function, the Host 
should provide instructions to all participants explaining what they will need to do. Following is an 
example: 

 

•  Go on the record and call the case. 
•  The Interpreter 

  Ask the interpreter to say and spell their name for the record.  
  Ask the interpreter what type of license they hold, if any, and to state their license 

 

number for the record. 
If they are unlicensed, ask them a short set of questions to establish they meet the 
requirements of Section 57.002.34  
  Administer the interpreter’s oath.35 
  Give participants instructions. The interpreter will interpret these in consecutive mode. 

                                                           
33 This functionality may be added for Chromebook, but is not available at publication. 
34 Under Tex. Gov. Code § 57.002, even when you are allowed to appoint an unlicensed interpreter to interpret a 
court proceeding, that interpreter must still be qualified by the court as an expert under the Texas Rules of 
Evidence; at least 18 years of age; and not a party to the proceeding. Here is an example of how it is done in 
federal court that could easily be adapted for Texas courts and the requirements of § 57.002. 
35 Tex. R. Evidence 604 requires that interpreters are qualified and take an oath. Sample interpreter’s 
oath: “Do you solemnly swear or affirm that you will interpret accurately, completely and impartially, 
using your best skill and judgment in accordance with the standards prescribed by law and the Code of 
Ethics and Professional Responsibility; follow all official guidelines established by this court for legal 
interpreting; and discharge all of the duties and obligations of legal interpretation?”

o Immediately raise your hand if you are unable to hear or understand the person 

speaking, or if the equipment you are using is not working properly. 

o [Instruct all participants about what to do if they get disconnected due to a

information for a staff person who will be responsive if needed.] 

 
6.  Enabling the Simultaneous Interpretation Function 

o Begin the proceeding as you normally would.  

The simultaneous interpretation option appears at the bottom of the Host’s screen as an icon that looks 
like a globe. Only the Host can enable this function, not a Co-Host. 

ost’s Screen 

  H

When the Host clicks on the “Interpretation” icon, a “Language Interpretation” screen will 
pop-up. The Host should start typing the name of the interpreter, which should populate the 
interpreter field or display a dropdown list of choices. 

Once the interpreter’s name appears in the interpreter field, the Host must select the 
appropriate non-English language and then click “Start.” The Host can assign multiple 
interpreters as needed.  

 

nterpreter’s Screen 

After the Host clicks “Start,” the interpreter will see a Welcome screen that is visible only to the 
interpreter. When the interpreter clicks “OK,” Zoom automatically chooses the non-English 
language for them.

After the interpreter clicks “OK,” the interpreter sees a screen that allows them to 
toggle back and forth between English and the non-English language audio channels. 

 

articipant’s Computer Screen 

Once the simultaneous interpretation feature has been activated by the Host, the other 
Participants will see a pop-up notice on their screens indicating, “interpretation is available” or 
“language interpretation.” The Host should remind participants of the instructions to click on the 
Interpretation icon (not the message bubble) to select their preferred language. 

  P

 

Participant’s Smart Phone Screen 

 

 

The court, staff, and attorneys should choose “English” while the LEP individual chooses the 
[Non-English] language. Once all of the participants have chosen their preferred language 
channel, simultaneous interpreting can begin. 

Confirm all the participants can hear by saying, “Can everyone hear the language that they 
selected? Please raise your hand if you can hear.” Instruct participants to alert the Court if anybody 
has difficulties hearing by raising their hand at any point during the proceeding. 

During the Hearing 
When the simultaneous interpreting function is on, the interpretation will not be audible to anyone 
except the LEP individual and anyone else who has selected the non-English audio channel. The LEP 
individual should hear the English speakers at about 20% volume while the interpretation will be heard 
at about 80% volume. It may be helpful for the court to inform the LEP individual that if they want to 
hear only the interpretation, they can click “Mute Original Audio.” 
 

Ending the Simultaneous Interpreting Option 
To stop the Simultaneous Interpretation function at any time, the Host can click the “Interpretation” 
icon and choose “Manage Language Interpretation.” 

 
Best Practices for Court in Zoom Hearings Involving SRLs, Page 21 

nce the language interpretation screen is displayed, the Host should click “End” to stop the 
interpretation. The Host can stop and restart the interpretation function as often as necessary. 
Interpretation should be in consecutive mode when the simultaneous function is turned off. 

 

  O

 

 

Livestreaming on YouTube 
If the court is planning on livestreaming the proceeding on YouTube and the simultaneous interpretation 
function is enabled, viewers will NOT be able to hear the interpretation audio channel, only the original 
audio channel. Cloud recordings will also only record the original audio, not the interpreter audio 
channel. Proceedings recorded on a local computer will record any audio channels that the person 
recording it can hear. 

 
Breakout Rooms 
If the court needs to send an attorney and their LEP client into a breakout room with the interpreter, the 
simultaneous interpretation function will not work in the breakout room. Before sending participants 
into a breakout room, the Host should turn off the interpretation function as described above. 
Interpretation in a breakout room will be conducted in the consecutive mode, which is the method that 
mimics an in-person encounter. If the simultaneous interpretation feature is needed after participants 
return from the breakout room, the Host can turn the feature back on and instruct participants to 
choose their audio channel again.

Two Interpreters Working as a Team 
Two interpreters working as a team can share one audio channel and switch off while interpreting in 
the simultaneous mode. Both the active and resting interpreter will listen to the English speakers and 
switch off as needed with only one interpreter interpreting at a time. When interpreters are working as 
a team, they are not able to hear the other interpreter’s interpretation. It may be helpful for them to 
have an opportunity to communicate prior to the proceeding to agree on how they will communicate 
and switch off. They may need to pause the proceedings for a moment while they switch off.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
