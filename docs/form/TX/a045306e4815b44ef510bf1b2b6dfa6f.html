FOREWORD

offices produce better results:

•  Higher quality

•  Greater accountability

•  Lower costs

Why do Texas public defender offices work? Our criminal justice counterparts—

police, prosecutors, judges, and jailers—can tell you. They’ve long embraced 

systems that include supervision, management, training, and support. These 

systems produce higher quality, accountability, transparency, and budget 

predictability, all to the joy of taxpayers.

Public defender offices work for similar reasons: attorneys are supervised, cases 

managed, trainings attended, and support provided. As a result, as study after 

study (many discussed below) shows, public defender offices produce higher 

quality, accountability, transparency, and budget predictability.

This publication looks at why public defender offices work, profiles Texas public 

defender offices, and shows how to build a public defender office.

In our work, the stakes—liberty, taxpayer dollars, community safety—are high. 

The choice of defense system is important. TIDC has helped plan and fund public 

defender offices for dozens of counties. Let us know how we can help yours.

Sincerely,

 

Geoff Burkhart 

Executive Director, Texas Indigent Defense Commission

THE PUBLIC  
DEFENDER MODEL

Public defender office structure ensures quality representation.

TEXAS FAIR  
DEFENSE LAWS

The United States Constitution and 

Texas Constitution and statutes 

guarantee a lawyer for anyone 

accused of a crime that could result 

in incarceration. 

In 2001, Texas passed the Fair 

Defense Act, which provided state 

funding and set minimum standards 

for the appointment, performance, 

and payment of lawyers. It required 

counties to use a default “wheel” 

system to randomly assign counsel, 

which most counties use today. The 

Fair Defense Act also created what 

is now known as Texas Indigent 

Defense Commission (TIDC) and 

charged it with funding, overseeing, 

and improving indigent defense 

throughout Texas.

INDIGENT DEFENSE SYSTEMS 

There are four main ways to provide indigent 

defense. Texas Counties may have more than one 

system or may share systems across a region.

Public Defender:  
Full-time, salaried attorneys 

are appointed, supervised, and 

paid by an office that includes 

investigators and support staff.

Managed Assigned Counsel: 
Private attorneys are appointed, 

supported, and paid by a defense 

management organization on a 

rotating, case-by-case basis.

Contract:  
Private attorneys contract with a 

county for a volume of cases.

Assigned Counsel:  
Private attorneys are appointed 

and paid by the court on a 

rotating, case-by-case basis.

TEXAS PUBLIC DEFENDERS

In 2019, 36 of 254 counties had public defender offices. 

Those counties vary considerably by size and needs, but most 

report that public defender offices ensure better performance, 

accountability, budget predictability, and compliance with 

criminal laws and standards.

THE ADVANTAGE OF PUBLIC DEFENDERS

Many Texas indigent defense systems pay private attorneys on 

a case-by-case basis and offer little or no supervision. Defender 

offices create structures that can help attorneys meet ethical 

requirements and follow best practices:

• 

Independence. Defenders make decisions about 
representation independent of courts.

•  Oversight. Staff are supervised for quality representation.

•  Workload. Attorneys are not paid by the case, and so are 

not incentivized to take more than they can handle.

•  Teams. Attorneys and support staff work together on 

cases.

•  Training. Staff are trained and mentored in-house. 

• 

Institutionalization. Defender offices are a single hub for 
the defense, like a prosecutor’s office.

•  Administration. Defender offices manage case 

assignment and are consistently available to courts.

Research shows that, because of this structure, public defenders 

get better outcomes and reduce justice system costs.

RESEARCH ON 
PUBLIC DEFENDERS 

Studies repeatedly find that public defenders improve outcomes.

OUTCOME STUDIES

Dozens of studies have compared types of defense 

counsel. Recent, sophisticated statistical analysis has 
shown that public defenders get better outcomes 
than private assigned counsel:

•  Reduced case time from fewer continuances in 

Kentucky, Rhode Island, and Minnesota counties 

(Ostrom and Bowman, 2019)

•  Reduced likelihood of conviction 

by 3% across state cases (Roach, 2014)

•  Reduced likelihood of prison 

by 22% in San Francisco (Shem-Tov, 2017)

•  Reduced sentence lengths 

by 16% in federal cases (Iyengar, 2007) 

and by 26% across state cases (Cohen, 2011)

•  Reduced potential prison costs by $200 million  

in Philadelphia (Anderson and Heaton, 2012)

What accounts for these differences? Research points 

to structure and pay. Assigned counsel are:

•  Less prepared, less communicative, and more 

isolated when paid low, flat fees (Anderson and 

Heaton, 2012)

•  Less experienced and worse performing when paid 

below market rates (Roach, 2014)

•  Less likely to go to trial when paid more for pleas 

(Agan et al., 2019)

See References for more on these studies.

Structure and pay lead 

to better outcomes.

PUBLIC DEFENDERS HELP 
RECRUIT NEW LAWYERS 

Attracting lawyers to rural Texas.

PUBLIC DEFENDER JOB 
BENEFITS FOR NEW 
LAWYERS:

•  Trial experience, 

supervised by 

dedicated defense 

lawyers

•  Training, mentoring, 

and peer learning

•  Salary and benefits

•  Loan repayment 

assistance and 

forgiveness

•  Administrative 

support

Many rural Texas counties 

face an attorney shortage. 

Public defender offices 

can help recruit new 

attorneys. TIDC spoke 

with two young lawyers 

who explained how public 

defender offices help new 

graduates practice in  

rural Texas.

Class of 2020 Student Attorneys and Supervisors at 
Caprock Public Defender

J. BAILEY MCSHANE IV, 
Attorney at Far West Texas 
Public Defender

Bailey McShane is a Texan who 

almost became an Alaskan. 

Born in Midland, he had lived in 

Austin, graduated from Texas 

A&M, served in the Marine Corps, 

and studied law and business at 

Texas Tech. At Tech, Bailey was a 

student attorney at the Caprock Public Defender, a legal clinic 

that provides indigent defense representation in rural counties 

in the Panhandle. 

“Criminal defense gives you trial experience,” Bailey says, 

which is hard to come by for new lawyers. “I’m passionate 

about making sure the system works right.”

Despite passion and experience, when Bailey graduated 

in 2018, he found his job options were limited: his Tech 

classmates went to Colorado and New Mexico to work for 

their state public defenders. Bailey applied to become a public 

defender in Alaska and pondered life north of the Arctic Circle. 

Instead, Bailey went into private practice, 

But, she says, “I didn’t know where to

nonprofit public defender office can qualify 

for public service loan forgiveness from the 

federal government. TRLA has its own loan 

repayment assistance program that has been 

key to attracting and retaining new lawyers.

In just five years, Jessica became the chief 

of her own TRLA office, in Lavaca County. 

Through its regional network of offices, 

she can continue to rely on TRLA’s public 

defenders to help her grow as a lawyer and a 

leader in her rural legal community. 

JESSICA CANTER, 
Chief Defender at

Like Bailey, Jessica 

Canter is a Texan 

who knew she 

had a passion for 

criminal defense by the time she graduated from 

law school in 2014.

on Bexar County

“The first line of defense”

The public defender office in 
Bexar County, home to San 
Antonio, specializes in some of 
the county’s toughest cases. To 
get results, it has to act quickly. 

By 2005, Bexar County had 
met many of the requirements 
of the Fair Defense Act: local 
attorneys had to meet new 
qualifications to be paid 
under a new fee schedule. 
For appeals, however, too few 
attorneys qualified to take 
cases, so those who did qualify 
had high caseloads. Attorneys 
struggled to make deadlines, 
cases lagged, and defendants 
waited in jail. Some defendants 
missed their chance to appeal.

To better manage attorneys’ 
workload and appointment 
process, TIDC awarded 
$1,174,009 in grants to Bexar 
County to start a public 
defender office. If a defendant 
was wrongfully convicted, he 
or she had a number to call 
to make things right. Judges, 
too, could rely on one office to 
answer the phone.

In 2015, the County again 
turned to the public defender 
for help with its jails. It had 
built a new central magistration 
facility, where specialists on-
site could identify people with 

mental illness and divert them 
to treatment shortly after arrest. 
The problem was that only 
about 2% who might have been 
eligible were diverted. Most did 
not want to discuss their mental 
illness with jail staff.

Only a few other counties in 
Texas—including Cameron, 
Fort Bend, and Harris—
currently provide counsel at 
magistration. Defendants in 
most counties stand alone the 
first time they see a judge.

With help from $513,151 in 
grants from TIDC, the public 
defender office started meeting 
with people within hours of 
their arrest and representing 
those with serious mental 
illness. At magistration, they 
advocated for release on 
mental health bonds.

They found that people who 
were represented by the public 
defender were 20% more likely 
to be released than those who 
had been recommended for 
a bond by pretrial services. 
Within a few years, the office 
more than doubled the number 
of people who were diverted 
from jail to treatment.

Recognizing this success, 
Bexar County judges and 
commissioners expanded 
counsel at magistration, 
so that the public defender 
now represents everyone 
who is arrested. 

Bexar County Chief Public 
Defender Michael Young says 
that early representation can 
change your whole experience 
of the criminal justice system: 
“You’re scared, you’re trying 
to contact friends and family, 
you don’t know what’s going 
on—sometimes for days and 
months. With an attorney, 
you have a voice from the 
beginning. I think that has a 
profound effect on how you 
navigate your whole case.”

First Assistant Public Defender 
Stephanie Brown agrees: 
“During magistration, the public 
defender’s office is the first line 
of defense.  Although we are 
only representing the clients 
for magistration purposes on 
that day, we can provide hope 
and guidance as to what they 
should expect going forward.  
Even though people may have 
been through the system many 
times before, they now admit 

to feeling better going forward, 
after being represented by the 
public defender.”

The public defender continues 
to represent some clients 
with mental illness after 
magistration, both in specialty 
courts and traditional courts. 

They have seen that early 
representation leads to 
better results throughout a 
case. Clients have a reliable 
advocate they can call, are 
connected to help for issues 
like mental health, substance, 
abuse, and homelessness, and 
have better outcomes: higher 
rates of compliance with court 
orders and treatment plans, 
and higher dismissal rates 
when they get to trial. 

To Michael, this is just good 
lawyering. “When I was in 
private practice, the first thing 
I’d do is get my client in drug 
treatment or behavioral therapy. 
Before you ever get to court, 
you take remedial action.”

At the same time, Stephanie 
says that being a public 
defender “takes a special kind 
of person. We’re here because 
we love what we do.” She 
joined the office in 2015, and 
now leads the Magistration 
unit, in addition to being the 
First Assistant Public Defender. 
She was a prosecutor for the 
first 7 years of her career.  
She has also practiced family 
and insurance law. Public 
defense has been different. 

“I can ensure justice just as 
well from this side as from the 
prosecutor’s,” she says. “And 
I have more leeway to help 
people.”

Next for the office is starting 
a domestic violence unit 
that will specialize in finding 
alternatives to jail, so that 
clients can get treatment  
and continue supporting  
their families. 

Those clients are often denied 
mental health bonds because 
of concerns about recidivism. 
By taking the tough cases 
head-on, as soon as they reach 
the criminal justice system, the 
public defender office hopes it 
can help break the cycle.

on Far West Texas

“These folks are our neighbors.”

The 394th Judicial District, 
east of El Paso, covers 20,000 
square miles. Its five counties 
occupy 8% of Texas’s land 
area, yet are home to only 
25,000 people. 

In 2017, there were only a 
few attorneys in the area, and 
almost none were qualified to 
handle criminal cases or willing 
to take what the counties could 
pay. At the same time, a Border 
Patrol checkpoint meant these 
sparsely populated counties 
had high case volumes. 

TIDC worked with District 
Judge Roy Ferguson to craft a 
solution: The Far West Texas 
Regional Public Defender 
Office. With the help of TIDC 
grants covering two-thirds of 
expenses, or about $265,000 
a year, it has quickly become 
a model for providing effective 
representation in rural counties.

“Culberson County is thrilled 
to sponsor the grant,” 
said Culberson County 
Judge Carlos Urias, in a 
press release. As the grant 
sponsor, Culberson receives 
reimbursement from TIDC and 
coordinates with the other 
counties through interlocal 
agreements. “This program will 
provide a huge leap forward 
in the administration of justice 
across the entire region.” 

Chief Defender James 
McDermott says distance 
is his biggest challenge; it 
takes over six hours to drive 
across his service area. 
Each of the office’s three 
attorneys works across all 
five counties, handling most 
misdemeanors and felonies. 
An investigator provides a full 
range of services, from intake 
to mitigation to innocence 
investigation. A social worker 
assists with clients with 
mental illness. And an office 
administrator coordinates 
everyone’s coverage of 
the courts. “It’s a small but 
dedicated and intense staff,” 
says James.

Their team approach has won 
the trust of clients. One had 
5 previous DWI convictions. 
Roland Valles, the Far West 
Texas investigator, was the first 
to ask about his history and 
develop a case for mitigation. 
After a hard-fought jury trial, he 
was ultimately convicted but 
sentenced to rehab instead of 
the long prison term requested 
by the prosecutor. James 
recalls, “He kept thanking us, 
and I asked him why. We had 
lost! He responded that no 
one had ever listened to him 
and now he could see a future 
for himself.”

Though there are significant 
challenges, “practicing in small 
communities can be a real joy,” 
James says. “We know all the 
courthouse and jail staff. These 
folks are often our neighbors 
and friends.” When their family 
members have been arrested, 
they have asked the public 
defender for help.

“It’s not that we win every 
case, but that no matter the 
outcome, the community can 
see what it means to fight for 
someone and hold the system 
accountable. And they will then 
want more to participate in this 
great democracy. Who can 
lose if that is the result?”

James would like to see other 
counties start rural programs 
like his. “The people of your 
counties deserve a well-run 
public defender. Your juries and 
your court staff will appreciate 
the professionalism and 
the work product. But more 
importantly, the community 
will build a greater trust and 
respect for the courts and the 
justice system when they see 
what it means when rights are 
protected, and justice is done.”

on Texas Rio Grande Legal Aid

“You’re part of a law firm.”

For clients of the Starr County 
Public Defender’s Office, their 
defense begins before they 
even have an attorney. 

That is because an 
investigator from the office 
screens people who request 
an attorney and may be the 
first person they speak to in 
jail. They might show signs 
of serious mental illness or 
share that their children are in 
trouble. If they qualify for the 
public defender, an attorney 
follows up right away.

This is characteristic of the 
Texas Rio Grande Legal 
Aid (TRLA) Public Defender 
program’s team approach. 
TRLA is primarily a civil legal 
services provider that has 
four public defender offices in 
South Texas. 

Each office serves rural 
counties, taking most of their 
appointed cases. The Starr 
County office, for example, 
also serves Duval and Jim 
Hogg Counties, each of which 
have populations of less than 
15,000 people. Because TRLA 
is a rural, regional program, 
TIDC reimburses two-thirds of 
its counties’ expenses, over 
$400,000 per year.

Within each office, there are 
attorneys, investigators, and 
assistants. Some have social 
workers or peer specialists. 
That means that clients 
always have someone they 
can talk to, which is especially 
important for those who have 
difficulty communicating 
due to a mental illness or 
developmental disability. 

It also means that clients have 
a full legal team working on 
their case. Linda Gonzalez, 
Chief Defender for Starr 
County, says, “We often meet 
as a team to come up with 
appropriate trial strategies, 
prepare for hearings, and 
review each other’s motions. 
At TRLA, you always feel like 
you’re part of a law firm, a 
bigger team. In our group, it 
happens organically.”

She contrasts that feeling 
with her time as a private 
criminal defense attorney. As 
a solo practitioner, she says, 
“even if you have the desire 
to help clients, you don’t 
have the resources of a law 
firm. Two brains are better 
than one. And being part of 
an organization gives you the 
courage to ask for what your 
client needs.”

Linda can reach out to other 
TRLA chiefs in Bee, Lavaca, 
and Willacy Counties, or the 
Director of the TRLA Public 
Defender program, Abner 
Burnett. “Abner is always 
available,” Linda says. “He 
knows more of our clients  
by name than any director out 
there. He knows our  
legal issues.” 

“Having someone with so 
much experience like Abner, 
and things like motions 
templates, means you’re not 
reinventing the wheel. Those 
are stark differences from solo 
practice and all of them have 
helped me become a better 
lawyer,” she says. 

Another benefit of belonging 
to a larger organization is 
that TRLA’s public defense 
clients may qualify for its 
civil legal services. The 
same, low-income people 
often have many legal issues 
arising from the same events. 
TRLA public defenders can 
refer clients to their housing, 
public benefits, immigration, 
or school suspension legal 
divisions. Resolving those 
collateral issues can change 
the outcome of their  
criminal cases.

Identifying all the issues is 
part of developing a defense 
strategy. An advantage of rural 
practice, Linda says, is that 
“we get to know our clients, 
where they come from, and 
their circumstances. It allows 
us to be very thorough in our 
preparation of a defense.”

Being prepared is important 
to judges, says Abner. “When 
we first open, judges and 
prosecutors fear that we’ll clog 
dockets. But, over time, they 
see we’re prepared at trial. 

We’re always in the courtroom. 
At every office, the staff is 
enthusiastic about helping the 
courts, clerks, and jails and 
making their work easier. Most 
private attorneys don’t have 
the time.”

Linda adds, “Commissioners 
and county judges are often 
wary that public defenders will 
cost more. It quickly becomes 
clear that public defenders 
empty out the jail [so] there 
are beds available for federal 
inmates and inmates from 
other counties.”

Abner observes that some 
of the greatest successes 
of public defenders are the 
stories that are never told. 
“The stories you hear about 
the criminal justice system are 
of people who were poorly 
represented, wrongfully 
convicted, then exonerated. 
Linda and people in our other 
offices establish innocence at 
trial. They handle it before it 
hits the news.”

HOW TO BUILD A PUBLIC 
DEFENDER OFFICE

 TIDC provides support at each stage of building an office.

OVERVIEW

The best way to build an office is through 

a careful process of planning, funding, 

launching, and improving a program to 

achieve desired outcomes. TIDC has worked 

with dozens of counties, large and small, to 

create and expand offices, and can help at 

every stage.

PLANNING

Not sure where to start? Contact 

TIDC’s Improvement Team to begin the 

conversation. TIDC may ask about:

•  Challenges with the current system

•  Case volume and spending

• 

Interest from local and regional officials 

and stakeholders

The first stage in building an office is 

assessing local needs. TIDC provides data 

about indigent defense cases and spending 

on its website. Local court and auditor data 

can provide additional information, especially 

about attorney performance.

The Improvement Team can help analyze 

the data and assess your county’s 
indigent defense needs.

3. Should the public defender have an  

oversight board?

An office must have a qualified chief defender (Art. 

26.044(f)). It may also have an oversight board that 

assists in selecting and removing the chief, setting 

policy, and developing budgets (Art. 26.045). If the 

office is grant-funded, TIDC requires a board to 

ensure independence and accountability. For good 

office based on the following key decision 

governance, counties should consider the board’s:

points and requirements of the Texas Code 

of Criminal Procedure (CCP): 

1. Should the office serve one or  

more counties? 

An office can provide representation in 

one or more counties (CCP Art. 26.044(b)). 

Counties with small caseloads may find 

joining a regional program more cost-

effective. Counties are eligible to apply for 

TIDC grants that fund half of single-county 

offices’ start-up expenses over four years. 

Rural regional public defender offices 

serving multiple counties under 100,000 

population may be eligible for sustainability 

grants covering two-thirds of ongoing 

expenses. 

2. Should the public defender office 

be a county department or nonprofit 

nonprofit contracting with the government 

(Art. 26.044(a)(1), (4)). To contract with a 

nonprofit, the commissioners court must 

solicit proposals that include certain 

elements specified in statute and that 

reasonably demonstrate the ability to 

provide quality representation, not just 

low cost (Art. 26.044(c)-(e)). A government 

agency may have a stronger institutional 

presence (balancing the prosecutor), while 

a nonprofit may have more independence 

(allowing for innovation). 

•  Size. Boards should have an odd number of 

members, usually totaling 7-13 members (small 
enough to be nimble and large enough to reach 
quorum).

•  Diversity. Board members should have diverse 
backgrounds and appointment sources so that 
no single group controls it.

•  Longevity. Boards should be built to last for 
decades. Membership should be selected by 
role, not for individuals.

Board members should include stakeholders with 

expertise in criminal justice, such as:

•  Defenders from other jurisdictions

•  Academics specializing in public defense or 

criminal justice

•  Community members

•  Justice advocates

•  Civil lawyers, especially with extensive criminal 

justice pro bono experience

•  Retired judges or civil judges with knowledge of 

criminal law.

•  Active criminal court judges

•  Active or recent prosecutors (such as those who 

have served as a prosecutor in the last 3 years) 

•  Defense attorneys taking court appointments in

Legal Requirements

Articles 26.04(f) and 26.044-5 of the 
Texas Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP) 
set requirements for public defender 
offices. In brief, an office must:

•  Have priority in receiving 

appointments.

•  Have duties, cases, and courts in 
which it may appear, specified by 
commissioners court.

•  Have a written proposal or plan of 

operation, including:

 ·

 ·

 ·

 ·

 ·

Budget and overhead

Position descriptions

 · Maximum caseloads

Training plan

Policy for using experts and 
investigators

Policy for avoiding conflicts of 
interest

 ·

Quality controls (for nonprofits)

•  Be directed by an experienced chief 

public defender.

•  NOT allow attorneys to engage in 

private practice of law.

•  NOT allow attorneys to accept outside 

payment for representation. 

•  NOT accept an appointment if doing 

so would be unethical.

•  NOT give its oversight board 

privileged information.

caseload be?

An office must have maximum caseload limits 

for attorneys (Art. 26.044(c-1)) and refuse cases 

that would violate these limits (Art. 26.044(j) 

(4)). TIDC recommends setting caseload 

limits that are consistent with its published 
guidelines, which recommend no more than 239 
misdemeanors, 138 felonies, or 31 appeals 
per year, per public defender. TIDC’s guidelines 
are based on a study it commissioned from 

the Public Policy Research Institute at Texas 

A&M University that found that attorneys may 

not meet ethical duties to clients if they exceed 

these limits. TIDC’s funding models in planning 

studies are based on these guidelines. 

5. What proportion and types of cases 

should the office handle? 

The commissioners court must specify what 

types of cases an office may take (Art. 26.044(b) 

(2)). An office can handle nearly all cases in 

a county, specialize in certain case types (for 

example, felonies or mental health cases), 

or handle some percentage of the overall 

caseload. Assigned counsel will almost always 

be needed to handle at least some cases, 

especially those that would create conflicts of 

interest for the public defender (Art. 26.044(c-1)

(7), (j)(1)).

6. What should staff be paid? 

A public defender’s proposal or plan of 
operations must include job descriptions  

and salaries (Art. 26.044(c-1)(1), (2)). TIDC 

will work with counties to estimate defender 

salaries based on pay at county and district 

attorneys’ offices. 

7. What should the staffing levels be? 

Resource parity should extend to support staff 

(like legal assistants) and other specialists who 

are essential to the public defender team model. 

A public defender proposal or 

plan must have policies for using 

licensed investigators and expert 

witnesses (Art. 26.044(c-1)(6)) 

and ideally should include other 

specialists like mental health 

caseworkers and immigration 

attorneys (for advisals required 

of criminal defense attorneys by 

the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court 

case Padilla v. Kentucky). TIDC 

planning studies recommend 

staffing levels based on national 

standards and needs of local 

jurisdictions.

8. What should the budget for 

operating expenses be? 

A public defender’s proposal or 

plan of operations must describe 

anticipated overheard (Art. 

26.044(c-1)(5)). An advantage 

of the public defender model 

over private assigned counsel 

is that attorneys pool overhead 

costs. TIDC’s planning studies 

estimate what items like office 

space, technology, and supplies 

will cost. A planning study for a 

rural regional program may also 

estimate travel costs. 

TIDC recommends forming a 
workgroup of local and regional 
stakeholders to discuss these 

decision points and plan the 

office. The workgroup can 

include members of a potential 

oversight board (see page 25) or 

officials who must approve the 

grant (see page 28).

FUNDING

TIDC’s Improvement and Grants Teams can help turn a public 

defender office plan into a grant proposal for state funding. 

TIDC awards competitive, multi-year Improvement Grants to 

help fund public defender offices. TIDC typically funds half of 

start-up costs over four years. Rural regional offices—those 

serving multiple counties under 100,000 population—may be 

eligible for 80% of first-year start-up costs and two-thirds of 

ongoing costs.

Funds are awarded annually and disbursed quarterly, as 

reimbursement for eligible expenses. The award timeline is:

•  January: Request for Applications (RFA) published 

online.

•  March: Deadline for optional Intent to Submit 

Application (ISA), submitted online. 

•  May: Priority deadline for required full grant application, 
submitted online. TIDC’s Grant Review committee meets.

•  June and August: Grants considered at the board 

meetings.

•  October: Grant programs can begin. 

All Improvement Grants are competitive, and subject to TIDC 

Board approval and availability of funding. Grant applications 

may be submitted and considered after May, but applications 
submitted in May receive priority consideration.

Grant Requirements

To receive a TIDC grant, a county must 
have submitted these required reports:

• 

• 

Indigent Defense Expenditure 
Reports (IDER), annually to TIDC

Indigent Defense Plans, biennially 
to TIDC

•  Responses to monitoring reports, 

as requested by TIDC

•  Court reports, monthly to OCA

A multi-year Improvement Grant must:

•  Request at least $50,000 in state 

funding over four years

•  Provide for a county match

•  Fund a new program or position

•  Fund direct client services

A public defender grant must also:

•  Focus on serving people

•  Demonstrate broad judicial support

•  Have quality controls for the office:

 · Appointment process
 · Support services for attorneys
 · Caseload standards
 · System for managing caseloads
 · System for performance and cost 

 · Emphasis on training, supervision,  

reporting

and evaluation

Finally, TIDC prefers programs that:

•  Model practices for other counties

• 

Involve multi-county coordination

•  Make long-term commitments

•  Match funds with other sources

•  Have minimal indirect costs

•  Serve small counties

In addition, to apply for and receive a 
grant, it is necessary to have sign-off from:

•  The Program Director, who is 

designated to oversee day-to-day 
grant operations

•  The County Judge, or other 

designated authorized official for 
accepting and modifying the grant

•  The County Auditor or Treasurer, 

the financial official for receiving grant 
payments

•  Commissioners Court, which adopts 
a resolution to authorize the grant 
application to approve the grant 
application and award

•  Local Administrative County and 
District Judges and Chair of the 
Juvenile Board, who approve Indigent 
Defense Plans and sign a Cooperation 
Agreement 

•  County and District Court Judges, 
who hear criminal matters and sign a 
Cooperation Agreement

TIDC staff can assist with planning the program and budget, writing the grant, providing 

information to local officials, and presenting the application to its Board.

GRANT FAQS

Does TIDC guarantee four or 
more years of grant funding?

No, but it is likely. TIDC awards 
grants by fiscal year. A county must 
submit a short renewal application 
each year. TIDC may award funds 
subject to its budget and the 
program’s success. 

Can a county apply for another 
grant to expand an office after 
the first four years?

Yes. The grant must be for a  
new program. 

Can a county apply after May?

Yes. TIDC accepts applications after 
the priority deadline, but funds may 
be limited.

Can a county submit more than 
one grant application? 

Yes. Each year, a county can submit 
one multi-year application and one 
single-year application (for smaller-
scale projects).

Does every judge need to sign off 
on the public defender office to 
receive a grant?

No. But TIDC is unlikely to fund an 
office where local opposition would 
prevent the office from receiving 
appointments or functioning as 
intended.

Can an improvement grant affect 
my formula grant?

It depends. Speak to TIDC if you 
have questions.
