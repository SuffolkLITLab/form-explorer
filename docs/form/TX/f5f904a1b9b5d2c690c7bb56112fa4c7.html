ARTICLE I. 
GENERAL PROVISIONS 

ule 101. 

Title, Scope, and Applicability of the Rules; Definitions 

Title. These rules may be cited as the Texas Rules of Evidence. 

Scope. These  rules  apply to proceedings in Texas courts except as otherwise  provided in 
subdivisions (d)-(f). 

Rules on Privilege. The rules on privilege apply to all stages of a case or proceeding. 

Exception for Constitutional or Statutory Provisions or Other Rules. Despite these rules, 
a court must admit or exclude evidence if required to do so by the United States or Texas 
Constitution, a federal or Texas statute, or a rule prescribed by the United States or Texas 
Supreme Court or the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. If possible, a court should resolve 
by  reasonable  construction  any  inconsistency  between  these  rules  and  applicable 
constitutional or statutory provisions or other rules. 

e) 

Exceptions.  These rules—except for those on privilege—do not apply to: 

the  court’s  determination,  under  Rule  104(a),  on  a  preliminary  question  of  fact 
governing admissibility; 

    R

a) 

b) 

c)

grand jury proceedings; and 

the following miscellaneous proceedings: 

(1) 

2) 

3) 

  (

  (

 

an  application  for  habeas  corpus  in  extradition,  rendition,  or  interstate 
detainer proceedings; 

an inquiry by the court under Code of Criminal Procedure article 46B.004 to 
determine  whether  evidence  exists  that  would  support  a  finding  that  the 
defendant may be incompetent to stand trial; 

bail proceedings other than hearings to deny, revoke, or increase bail; 

hearings on justification for pretrial detention not involving bail; 

proceedings to issue a search or arrest warrant; and 

direct contempt determination proceedings. 

(A) 

B) 

C) 

D) 

E) 

F) 

  (

  (

  (

  (

  (

 

(f) 

Exception for Justice Court Cases. These rules do not apply to justice court cases except 
as authorized by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 500.3. 

 

4 

Exception for Military Justice Hearings. The Texas Code of Military Justice, Tex. Gov’t 
Code §§ 432.001-432.195, governs the admissibility of evidence in hearings held under that 
Code. 

h) 

Definitions. In these rules:  

(1) 

“civil case” means a civil action or proceeding;  

“criminal  case”  means  a  criminal  action  or  proceeding,  including  an  examining 
trial; 

“public office” includes a public agency;  

“record” includes a memorandum, report, or data compilation;  

a “rule prescribed by the United States or Texas Supreme Court or the Texas Court 
of Criminal Appeals” means a rule adopted by any of those courts under statutory 
authority;  

“unsworn  declaration”  means  an  unsworn  declaration  made  in  accordance  with 
Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 132.001; and 

a  reference  to  any  kind  of  written  material  or  any  other  medium  includes 
electronically stored information.

7) 

omment to 1998: “Criminal proceedings” rather than “criminal cases” is used since that was the 
terminology used in the prior Rules of Criminal Evidence. In subpart (b), the reference to “trials 
before magistrates” comes from prior Criminal Rule 1101(a). In the prior Criminal Rules, both 
Rule 101 and Rule 1101 dealt with the same thing – the applicability of the rules. Thus, Rules 
101(c) and (d) have been written to incorporate the provisions of former Criminal Rule 1101 and 
that rule is omitted.  

omment to 2015 Restyling:  The reference to “hierarchical governance” in former Rule 101(c) 
has been deleted as unnecessary. The textual limitation of former Rule 101(c) to criminal cases 
has been eliminated. Courts in civil cases must also admit or exclude evidence when required to 
do so by constitutional or statutory provisions or other rules that take precedence over these rules. 
Likewise, the title to former Rule 101(d) has been changed to more accurately indicate the purpose 
and scope of the subdivision.

These rules should be construed so as to administer every proceeding fairly, eliminate unjustifiable 
expense and delay, and promote the development of evidence law, to the end of ascertaining the 
truth and securing a just determination. 

ule 103. 

Rulings on Evidence  

Preserving a Claim of Error. A party may claim error in a ruling to admit or exclude 
evidence only if the error affects a substantial right of the party and:  

if the ruling admits evidence, a party, on the record:  

(1) 
 

(A) 

timely objects or moves to strike; and  

(B) 

states the specific ground, unless it was apparent from the context; or  

(2) 

if the ruling excludes evidence, a party informs the court of its substance by an offer 
of proof, unless the substance was apparent from the context.  

Not Needing to Renew an Objection. When the court hears a party’s objections outside 
the presence of the jury and rules that evidence is admissible, a party need not renew an 
objection to preserve a claim of error for appeal. 

Court’s Statement About the Ruling; Directing an Offer of Proof. The court may make 
any  statement  about  the  character  or  form  of  the evidence,  the  objection  made,  and  the 
ruling. The court must allow a party to make an offer of proof as soon as practicable. In a 
jury trial, the court must allow a party to make the offer outside the jury’s presence and 
before the court reads its charge to the jury. At a party’s request, the court must direct that 
an offer of proof be made in question-and-answer form. Or the court may do so on its own.  

Preventing the Jury from Hearing Inadmissible Evidence. To the extent practicable, 
the court must conduct a jury trial so that inadmissible evidence is not suggested to the jury 
by any means.  

Taking Notice of Fundamental Error in Criminal Cases. In criminal cases, a court may 
take notice of a fundamental error affecting a substantial right, even if the claim of error 
was not properly preserved.  

Notes and Comments 

omment to 1998 change: The exception to the requirement of an offer of proof for matters that 
were apparent from the context within which questions were asked, found in paragraph (a)(2), is 
now applicable to civil as well as criminal cases.

e) 

In General. The court must decide any preliminary question about whether a witness is 
qualified, a privilege exists, or evidence is admissible. In so deciding, the court is not bound 
by evidence rules, except those on privilege.  

Relevance That Depends on a Fact. When the relevance of evidence depends on whether 
a  fact  exists,  proof  must  be  introduced  sufficient to  support  a finding that  the fact  does 
exist.  The  court  may  admit  the  proposed  evidence  on  the  condition  that  the  proof  be 
introduced later.  

c) 

Conducting a Hearing So That the Jury Cannot Hear It. The court must conduct any 
hearing on a preliminary question so that the jury cannot hear it if:  

the hearing involves the admissibility of a confession in a criminal case;  

a defendant in a criminal case is a witness and so requests; or  

justice so requires.  

 
Cross-Examining  a  Defendant  in  a  Criminal  Case.  By  testifying  outside  the  jury’s 
hearing on a preliminary question, a defendant in a criminal case does not become subject 
to cross-examination on other issues in the case.  

Evidence Relevant to Weight and Credibility. This rule does not limit a party’s right to 
introduce  before  the  jury  evidence  that  is  relevant  to  the  weight  or  credibility  of  other 
evidence. 

ule 105.  

Evidence That Is Not Admissible Against Other Parties or for Other Purposes 

Limiting  Admitted  Evidence.  If  the  court  admits  evidence  that  is  admissible  against  a 
party or for a purpose—but not against another party or for another purpose—the court, on 
request, must restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly.  

b) 

Preserving a Claim of Error. 

Court  Admits  the  Evidence  Without  Restriction.  A  party  may  claim  error  in  a 
ruling to admit evidence that is admissible against a party or for a purpose—but not 
against another party or for another purpose—only if the party requests the court to 
restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly. 

Court  Excludes  the  Evidence.  A  party  may  claim  error  in  a  ruling  to  exclude 
evidence that is admissible against a party or for a purpose—but not against another 
party or for another purpose—only if the party limits its offer to the party against 
whom or the purpose for which the evidence is admissible.

Rule 106. 

Remainder of or Related Writings or Recorded Statements  

f a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse party may introduce, 
at that time, any other part—or any other writing or recorded statement—that in fairness ought to 
be considered at the same time. “Writing or recorded statement” includes depositions. 

ule 107. 

Rule of Optional Completeness 

f  a  party introduces  part  of an  act,  declaration,  conversation,  writing, or recorded  statement,  an 
adverse  party  may  inquire  into  any  other  part  on  the  same  subject.  An  adverse  party  may  also 
introduce any other act, declaration, conversation, writing, or recorded statement that is necessary to 
explain or allow the trier of fact to fully understand the part offered by the opponent. “Writing or 
recorded statement” includes a deposition. 
 

Notes and Comments 

omment to 1998 change: This rule is the former Criminal Rule 107 except that the example 
regarding “when a letter is read” has been relocated in the rule so as to more accurately indicate 
the  provision  it  explains.  While  this  rule  appeared  only  in  the  prior  criminal  rules,  it  is  made 
applicable  to  civil  cases  because  it  accurately  reflects  the  common  law  rule  of  optional 
completeness in civil cases.  

ARTICLE II. 
JUDICIAL NOTICE 

ule 201.  

Judicial Notice of Adjudicative Facts  

a) 

Scope. This rule governs judicial notice of an adjudicative fact only, not a legislative fact.  

b)  Kinds of Facts That May Be Judicially Noticed. The court may judicially notice a fact 

that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it:  

is generally known within the trial court’s territorial jurisdiction; or  

can  be  accurately  and  readily  determined  from  sources  whose  accuracy  cannot 
reasonably be questioned.  

 
Taking Notice. The court:  

may take judicial notice on its own; or  

must  take  judicial  notice  if  a  party  requests  it  and  the  court  is  supplied  with  the 
necessary information.

Timing. The court may take judicial notice at any stage of the proceeding.  

Opportunity  to  Be  Heard.  On  timely  request,  a  party  is  entitled  to  be  heard  on  the 
propriety of taking judicial notice and the nature of the fact to be noticed. If the court takes 
judicial notice before notifying a party, the party, on request, is still entitled to be heard.  

Instructing the Jury. In a civil case, the court must instruct the jury to accept the noticed 
fact as conclusive. In a criminal case, the court must instruct the jury that it may or may 
not accept the noticed fact as conclusive.  

ule 202.   

Judicial Notice of Other States’ Law 

Scope.  This  rule  governs  judicial  notice  of  another  state’s,  territory’s,  or  federal 
jurisdiction’s: 

may take judicial notice on its own; or  

must  take  judicial  notice  if  a  party  requests  it  and  the  court  is  supplied  with  the 
necessary information.  

 
Notice and Opportunity to Be Heard.   

Notice. The court may require a party requesting judicial notice to notify all other 
parties of the request so they may respond to it.  

Opportunity to Be Heard. On timely request, a party is entitled to be heard on the 
propriety of taking judicial notice and the nature of the matter to be noticed. If the 
court takes judicial notice before a party has been notified, the party, on request, is 
still entitled to be heard.

Determination and Review. The court—not the jury—must determine the law of another 
state, territory, or federal jurisdiction. The court’s determination must be treated as a ruling 
on a question of law.   

Raising a Foreign Law Issue. A party who intends to raise an issue about a foreign country’s 
law must:   

give reasonable notice by a pleading or other writing; and  

at  least  30  days  before  trial,  supply  all  parties  a  copy  of  any  written  materials  or 
sources the party intends to use to prove the foreign law.  

Translations. If the materials  or  sources were originally written  in  a language  other than 
English, the party intending to rely on them must, at least 30 days before trial, supply all 
parties both a copy of the foreign language text and an English translation.  

c)  Materials the  Court  May  Consider; Notice. In determining foreign law,  the  court may 
consider any material or source, whether or not admissible. If the court considers any material 
or source not submitted by a party, it must give all parties notice and a reasonable opportunity 
to comment and submit additional materials. 

Determination  and  Review.  The  court—not  the  jury—must  determine  foreign  law.  The 
court’s determination must be treated as a ruling on a question of law. 

Suits Brought Under the Family Code Involving a Marriage Relationship or Parent-
Child Relationship. Subsections (a) and (b) of this rule do not apply to an action to which

Rule 403.  

Excluding Relevant Evidence for Prejudice, Confusion, or Other Reasons  

he court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a 
danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, 
undue delay, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.  

ule 404. 

Character Evidence; Crimes or Other Acts 

Character Evidence. 

Prohibited  Uses.  Evidence  of  a  person’s  character  or  character  trait  is  not 
admissible  to  prove  that  on  a  particular  occasion  the  person  acted  in  accordance 
with the character or trait. 

2) 

Exceptions for an Accused. 

In  a  criminal  case,  a  defendant  may  offer  evidence  of  the  defendant’s 
pertinent  trait,  and  if  the  evidence  is  admitted,  the  prosecutor  may  offer 
evidence to rebut it. 

In a civil case, a party accused of conduct involving moral turpitude may 
offer evidence of the party’s pertinent trait, and if the evidence is admitted, 
the accusing party may offer evidence to rebut it. 

 

(3) 

Exceptions for a Victim. 

In a criminal case, subject to the limitations in Rule 412, a defendant may 
offer evidence of a victim’s pertinent trait, and if the evidence is admitted, 
the prosecutor may offer evidence to rebut it. 

In a homicide case, the prosecutor may offer evidence of the victim’s trait 
of peacefulness to rebut evidence that the victim was the first aggressor.  

In a civil case, a party accused of assaultive conduct may offer evidence of 
the victim’s trait of violence to prove self-defense, and if the evidence is 
admitted,  the  accusing  party  may  offer  evidence  of  the  victim’s  trait  of 
peacefulness. 

 
Exceptions for a Witness. Evidence of a witness’s character may be admitted under 
Rules 607, 608, and 609.

Prohibited Uses. Evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove 
a person’s character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted 
in accordance with the character.   

Permitted  Uses;  Notice  in  Criminal  Case.  This  evidence  may  be  admissible for 
another  purpose,  such  as  proving  motive,  opportunity,  intent,  preparation,  plan, 
knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident. On timely request by 
a defendant in a criminal case, the prosecutor must provide reasonable notice before 
trial that the prosecution intends to introduce such evidence—other than that arising 
in the same transaction—in its case-in-chief.  

ule 405.  Methods of Proving Character 

a) 

By Reputation or Opinion. 

In General. When evidence of a person’s character or character trait is admissible, 
it may be proved by testimony about the person’s reputation or by testimony in the 
form of an opinion. On cross-examination of the character witness, inquiry may be 
made into relevant specific instances of the person’s conduct. 

Accused’s Character in a Criminal Case. In the guilt stage of a criminal case, a 
witness may testify to the defendant’s character or character trait only if, before the 
day of the offense, the witness was familiar with the defendant’s reputation or the 
facts or information that form the basis of the witness’s opinion.   

 

(b) 

By  Specific  Instances  of  Conduct.  When  a  person’s  character  or  character  trait  is  an 
essential element of a charge, claim, or defense, the character or trait may also be proved 
by relevant specific instances of the person’s conduct.  

ule 406.   Habit; Routine Practice  

vidence of a person’s habit or an organization’s routine practice may be admitted to prove that 
on a particular occasion the person or organization acted in accordance with the habit or routine 
practice. The court may admit this evidence regardless of whether it is corroborated or whether 
there was an eyewitness.  

ule 407.  

Subsequent Remedial Measures; Notification of Defect 

a) 

Subsequent  Remedial  Measures.  When  measures  are  taken  that  would  have  made  an 
earlier  injury  or  harm  less  likely  to  occur,  evidence  of  the  subsequent  measures  is  not 
admissible to prove: 

•  negligence;

But the court may admit this evidence for another purpose, such as impeachment or—if 
disputed—proving ownership, control, or the feasibility of precautionary measures. 

b) 

Notification of Defect.  A manufacturer’s written notification to a purchaser of a defect in 
one of its products is admissible against the manufacturer to prove the defect. 

omment to 2015 Restyling: Rule 407 previously provided that evidence was not excluded if 
offered for a purpose not explicitly prohibited by the Rule. To improve the language of the Rule, 
it now provides that the court may admit evidence if offered for a permissible purpose. There is no 
intent to change the process for admitting evidence covered by the Rule. It remains the case that if 
offered for an impermissible purpose, it must be excluded, and if offered for a purpose not barred 
by the Rule, its admissibility remains governed by the general principles of Rules 402, 403, 801, 
etc. 

Prohibited Uses. Evidence of the following is not admissible either to prove or disprove 
the validity or amount of a disputed claim: 

furnishing, promising, or offering—or accepting, promising to accept, or offering 
to accept—a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise 
the claim; and 

conduct or statements made during compromise negotiations about the claim. 

(1) 

2) 

  (

Permissible Uses. The court may admit this evidence for another purpose, such as proving 
a party’s or witness’s bias, prejudice, or interest, negating a contention of undue delay, or 
proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution.  

omment to 2015 Restyling: Rule 408 previously provided that evidence was not excluded if 
offered for a purpose not explicitly prohibited by the Rule. To improve the language of the Rule, 
it now provides that the court may admit evidence if offered for a permissible purpose. There is no 
intent to change the process for admitting evidence covered by the Rule. It remains the case that if 
offered for an impermissible purpose, it must be excluded, and if offered for a purpose not barred 
by the Rule, its admissibility remains governed by the general principles of Rules 402, 403, 801, 
etc. 

he reference to “liability” has been deleted on the ground that the deletion makes the Rule flow 
better and easier to read, and because “liability” is covered by the broader term “validity.”  Courts 
have not made substantive decisions on the basis of any distinction between validity and liability. 
No change in current practice or in the coverage of the Rule is intended.

•  culpable conduct; 
•  a defect in a product or its design; or 
•  a need for a warning or instruction. 

inally, the sentence of the Rule referring to evidence “otherwise discoverable” has been deleted 
as  superfluous.  The  intent  of  the  sentence  was  to  prevent  a  party  from  trying  to  immunize 
admissible  information,  such  as  a  pre-existing  document,  through  the  pretense  of  disclosing  it 
during compromise negotiations. But even without the sentence, the Rule cannot be read to protect 
pre-existing  information  simply  because  it  was  presented  to  the  adversary  in  compromise 
negotiations. 

ule 409.   Offers to Pay Medical and Similar Expenses  

vidence of furnishing, promising to pay, or offering to pay medical, hospital, or similar expenses 

resulting from an injury is not admissible to prove liability for the injury.  

ule 410.  

Pleas, Plea Discussions, and Related Statements 

a) 

Prohibited Uses in Civil Cases. In a civil case, evidence of the following is not admissible 
against the defendant who made the plea or was a participant in the plea discussions: 

a statement made during a proceeding on either of those pleas under Federal Rule 
of Criminal Procedure 11 or a comparable state procedure; or 

a  statement  made  during  plea  discussions  with  an  attorney  for  the  prosecuting 
authority if the discussions did not result in a guilty plea or they resulted in a later-
withdrawn guilty plea. 

 

(b) 

Prohibited Uses in Criminal Cases.  In a criminal case, evidence of the following is not 
admissible  against  the  defendant  who  made  the  plea  or  was  a  participant  in  the  plea 
discussions: 

(1) 

a guilty plea that was later withdrawn; 

a nolo contendere plea that was later withdrawn;  

a statement made during a proceeding on either of those pleas under Federal Rule 
of Criminal Procedure 11 or a comparable state procedure; or 

a  statement  made  during  plea  discussions  with  an  attorney  for  the  prosecuting

or (4),  when  another  statement  made  during  the  same  plea  or  plea  discussions  has  been 
introduced and in fairness the statements ought to be considered together. 

ule 411.  

Liability Insurance  

vidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is not admissible to prove whether 
the person acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully. But the court may admit this evidence for 
another  purpose,  such  as  proving  a  witness’s  bias  or  prejudice  or, if  disputed,  proving  agency, 
ownership, or control.  

ule 412. 

Evidence of Previous Sexual Conduct in Criminal Cases 

a) 

In General. The following evidence is not admissible in a prosecution for sexual assault, 
aggravated sexual assault, or attempt to commit sexual assault or aggravated sexual assault:  

reputation or opinion evidence of a victim’s past sexual behavior; or  

specific instances of a victim’s past sexual behavior.  

b) 

Exceptions for Specific Instances. Evidence of specific instances of a victim’s past sexual 
behavior is admissible if: 

(1) 

the court admits the evidence in accordance with subdivisions (c) and (d); 

2) 

the evidence: 

is necessary to rebut or explain scientific or medical evidence offered by the 
prosecutor; 

concerns  past  sexual  behavior  with  the  defendant  and  is  offered  by  the 
defendant to prove consent;

c) 

Procedure  for  Offering  Evidence.  Before  offering  any  evidence  of  the  victim’s  past 
sexual behavior, the defendant must inform the court outside the jury’s presence. The court

whether the proposed evidence is admissible. The defendant may not refer to any evidence 
ruled  inadmissible  without  first  requesting  and  gaining  the  court’s  approval  outside  the 
jury’s presence.

voluntarily for the state nor gives a spouse a privilege to refuse to be called to testify 
for the accused.

testify to relevant matters, an accused’s failure to call the spouse to testify is a proper 
subject of comment by counsel.

about matters that occurred before the marriage. 

Notes and Comments 
 
Comment to 1998 change: The rule eliminates the spousal testimonial privilege for prosecutions in 
which the testifying spouse is the alleged victim of a crime by the accused. This is intended to be 
consistent with Code of Criminal Procedure article 38.10, effective September 1, 1995.  

omment to 2015 Restyling: Previously, Rule 504(b)(1) provided that, “A spouse who testifies on 
behalf of an accused is subject to cross-examination as provided in Rule 611(b).” That sentence was 
included  in  the  original  version  of  Rule  504  when  the  Texas  Rules  of  Criminal  Evidence  were 
promulgated in 1986 and changed the rule to a testimonial privilege held by the witness spouse. Until 
then, a spouse was deemed incompetent to testify against his or her defendant spouse, and when a 
spouse testified on behalf of a defendant spouse, the state was limited to cross-examining the spouse 
about  matters  relating  to  the  spouse’s  direct  testimony.  The  quoted  sentence  from  the  original 
Criminal Rule 504(b) was designed to overturn this limitation and allow the state to cross-examine 
a testifying spouse in the same manner as any other witness. More than twenty-five years later, it is 
clear that a spouse who testifies either for or against a defendant spouse may be cross-examined in 
the same manner as any other witness. Therefore, the continued inclusion in the rule of a provision 
that refers only to the cross-examination of a spouse who testifies on behalf of the accused is more 
confusing than helpful. Its deletion is designed to clarify the rule and does not change existing law.

 person has a privilege to refuse to disclose the person’s vote at a political election conducted by 

secret ballot unless the vote was cast illegally. 

ule 507.  

Trade Secrets Privilege 

General Rule. A person has a privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent other persons 
from disclosing a trade secret owned by the person, unless the court finds that nondisclosure 
will tend to conceal fraud or otherwise work injustice.  

b)  Who May Claim. The privilege may be claimed by the person who owns the trade secret or 

the person’s agent or employee.   

Protective Measure. If a court orders a person to disclose a trade secret, it must take any 
protective measure required  by the interests  of the privilege holder and the  parties  and to 
further justice.   

ule 508. 

Informer’s Identity Privilege 

a) 

General Rule. The United States, a state, or a subdivision of either has a privilege to refuse 
to disclose a person’s identity if: 

the person has furnished information to a law enforcement officer or a member of a 
legislative committee or its staff conducting an investigation of a possible violation 
of law; and  

the information relates to or assists in the investigation.

Criminal Case. In a criminal case, this privilege does not apply if the court 
finds  a  reasonable  probability  exists  that  the  informer  can  give  testimony 
necessary to a fair determination of guilt or innocence. If the court so finds 
and the public entity elects not to disclose the informer’s identity:  

on  the  defendant’s  motion,  the  court  must  dismiss  the  charges  to 
which the testimony would relate; or 

on its own motion, the court may dismiss the charges to which the 
testimony would relate. 

Certain Civil Cases. In a civil case in which the public entity is a party, this 
privilege does not apply if the court finds a reasonable probability exists that 
the informer can give testimony necessary to a fair determination of a material 
issue on the merits. If the court so finds and the public entity elects not to 
disclose the informer’s  identity, the court  may  make  any  order that justice 
requires. 

C) 

Procedures.   

If  it  appears  that  an  informer  may  be  able  to  give  the  testimony 
required  to  invoke  this  exception  and  the  public  entity  claims  the 
privilege, the court must give the public entity an opportunity to show 
in camera facts relevant to determining whether this exception is met. 
The showing should ordinarily be made by affidavits, but the court 
may  take  testimony  if  it  finds  the  matter  cannot  be  satisfactorily 
resolved by affidavits.

public entity to which the informer furnished the information. The court in a criminal case 
must reject the privilege claim if the state objects. 

c) 

Exceptions. 

Voluntary Disclosure; Informer a Witness. This privilege does not apply if: 

the  informer’s  identity  or  the  informer’s  interest  in  the  communication’s 
subject matter has been  disclosed—by  a privilege holder  or the informer’s 
own action—to a person who would have cause to resent the communication;

If the informer’s identity is disclosed in camera, the court must seal 
and preserve for appeal the record of the in camera proceeding. The 
record of the in camera proceeding must not otherwise be revealed 
without the public entity’s consent.  

No counsel or party may attend the in camera showing. 

The court must seal and preserve for appeal evidence submitted under 
this  subparagraph  (2)(C).  The  evidence  must  not  otherwise  be 
revealed without the public entity’s consent. 

3) 

Legality of Obtaining Evidence.   

(A) 

Court  May  Order  Disclosure.  The  court  may  order  the  public  entity  to 
disclose an informer’s identity if: 

information from an informer is relied on to establish the legality of 
the means by which evidence was obtained; and  

the court is not  satisfied that the information was received from an 
informer reasonably believed to be reliable or credible.

omment to 1998 change: This comment is intended to inform the construction and application of 
this rule. Prior Criminal Rules of Evidence 509 and 510 are now in subparagraph (b) of this Rule. 
This rule governs disclosures of patient-physician communications only in judicial or administrative 
proceedings. Whether a physician may or must disclose such communications in other circumstances 
is governed by TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. ANN. art. 4495b,  § 5.08. Former subparagraph (d)(6) of 
the Civil Evidence Rules, regarding disclosures in a suit affecting the parent-child relationship, is 
omitted, not because there should be no exception to the privilege in suits affecting the parent-child 
relationship,  but  because  the  exception  in  such  suits  is  properly  considered  under  subparagraph 
(d)(4),  as  construed  in  R.K.  v.  Ramirez,  887  S.W.2d  836  (Tex.  1994).  In  determining  the  proper 
application of an exception in such suits, the trial court must ensure that the precise need for the 
information  is  not  outweighed  by  legitimate  privacy  interests  protected  by  the  privilege. 
Subparagraph (d) does not except from the privilege information relating to a nonparty patient who 
is or may be a consulting or testifying expert in the suit.  

 

Comment to 2015 Restyling: The physician–patient privilege in a civil case was first enacted in 
Texas  in 1981  as  part  of  the  Medical Practice  Act,  formerly  codified in Tex.  Rev.  Civ.  Stat.  art. 
4495b. That statute provided that the privilege applied even if a patient had received a physician’s 
services before the statute’s enactment. Because more than thirty years have now passed, it is no 
longer necessary to burden the text of the rule with a statement regarding the privilege’s retroactive 
application. But deleting this statement from the rule’s text is not intended as a substantive change 
in the law.   
 

28 

 

  C

 

The former rule’s reference to “confidentiality or” and “administrative proceedings” in subdivision 
(e) [Exceptions in a Civil Case] has been deleted. First, this rule is a privilege rule only. Tex. Occ. 
Code § 159.004 sets forth exceptions to a physician’s duty to maintain confidentiality of patient 
information outside court and administrative proceedings. Second, by their own terms the rules of 
evidence govern only proceedings in Texas courts. See Rule 101(b). To the extent the rules apply 
in  administrative  proceedings,  it  is  because  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act  mandates  their 
applicability. Tex. Gov’t Code § 2001.083 provides that “[i]n a contested case, a state agency shall 
give  effect  to  the  rules  of  privilege  recognized  by  law.”  Section  2001.091  excludes  privileged 
material from discovery in contested administrative cases.   

tatutory references in the former rule that are no longer up-to-date have been revised. Finally, 
reconciling the provisions of Rule 509 with the parts of Tex. Occ. Code ch. 159 that address a 
physician-patient  privilege  applicable  to  court  proceedings  is  beyond  the  scope  of  the  restyling 
project.   
 

ule 510.  Mental Health Information Privilege in Civil Cases 

a) 

Definitions. In this rule: 

A “professional” is a person: 

(A) 

authorized to practice medicine in any state or nation; 

B) 

licensed  or  certified  by  the  State  of  Texas  in  the  diagnosis,  evaluation,  or 
treatment of any mental or emotional disorder; 

C) 

involved in the treatment or examination of drug abusers; or 

D)  who the patient reasonably believes to be a professional under this rule. 

 
A “patient” is a person who: 

consults  or  is  interviewed  by  a  professional  for  diagnosis,  evaluation,  or 
treatment  of  any  mental  or  emotional  condition  or  disorder,  including 
alcoholism and drug addiction; or 

is  being  treated  voluntarily  or  being  examined  for  admission  to  voluntary 
treatment for drug abuse.

the guardian of a patient who has been adjudicated incompetent to manage

A communication is “confidential” if not intended to be disclosed to third persons 
other than those: 

present  to  further  the  patient’s  interest  in  the  diagnosis,  examination, 
evaluation, or treatment;  

reasonably necessary to transmit the communication; or  

participating in the diagnosis, examination, evaluation, or treatment under the 
professional’s direction, including members of the patient’s family. 

In a civil case, a patient has a privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent any other 
person from disclosing: 

a confidential communication between the patient and a professional; and 

a record of the patient’s identity, diagnosis, evaluation, or treatment that is 
created or maintained by a professional. 

In  a  civil  case,  any  person—other  than  a  patient’s  representative  acting  on  the 
patient’s behalf—who receives information privileged under this rule may disclose 
the  information  only  to  the  extent  consistent  with  the  purposes  for  which  it  was 
obtained.

services rendered to the patient. 

Communication  Made  in  Court-Ordered  Examination.  To  a  communication  the 
patient  made  to  a  professional  during  a  court-ordered  examination  relating  to  the 
patient’s mental or emotional condition or disorder if: 

the patient made the communication after being informed that it would not be 
privileged; 

the communication is offered to prove an issue involving the patient’s mental 
or emotional health; and

the court imposes appropriate safeguards against unauthorized disclosure. 

 
Party Relies  on Patient’s  Condition. If any  party relies  on the  patient’s  physical, 
mental,  or  emotional  condition  as  a  part  of  the  party’s  claim  or  defense  and  the 
communication or record is relevant to that condition.  

Abuse or Neglect of “Institution” Resident. In a proceeding regarding the abuse or 
neglect,  or  the  cause  of  any  abuse  or  neglect,  of  a  resident  of  an  “institution”  as 
defined in Tex. Health & Safety Code § 242.002.

omment to 1998 change: This comment is intended to inform the construction and application 
of this rule. This rule governs disclosures of patient-professional communications only in judicial 
or administrative proceedings. Whether a professional may or must disclose such communications 
in other circumstances is governed by TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §§ 611.001-611.008. 
Former subparagraph (d)(6) of the Civil Evidence Rules, regarding disclosures in a suit affecting 
the parent-child relationship, is omitted, not because there should be no exception to the privilege 
in suits affecting the parent-child relationship, but because the exception in such suits is properly 
considered under subparagraph (d)(5), as construed in R.K. v. Ramirez, 887 S.W.2d 836 (Tex. 
1994). In determining the proper application of an exception in such suits, the trial court must 
ensure that the precise need for the information is not outweighed by legitimate privacy interests 
protected by the privilege. Subparagraph (d) does not except from the privilege information 
relating to a nonparty patient who is or may be a consulting or testifying expert in the suit.  

omment to 2015 Restyling: The mental-health-information privilege in civil cases was enacted in 
Texas in 1979. Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 5561h (later codified at Tex. Health & Safety Code § 611.001 

31

  C

 

et seq.) provided that the privilege applied even if the patient had received the professional’s services 
before  the  statute’s  enactment.  Because  more  than  thirty  years  have  now  passed,  it  is  no  longer 
necessary  to  burden  the  text  of  the  rule  with  a  statement  regarding  the  privilege’s  retroactive 
application. But deleting this statement from the rule’s text is not intended as a substantive change 
in the law. 

ex. Health & Safety Code ch. 611 addresses confidentiality rules for communications between a 
patient and a mental-health professional and for the professional’s treatment records. Many of these 
provisions apply in contexts other than court proceedings. Reconciling the provisions of Rule 510 
with the parts of chapter 611 that address a mental-health-information privilege applicable to court 
proceedings is beyond the scope of the restyling project.   

ule 511.    Waiver by Voluntary Disclosure 

a) 

General Rule. 

A person upon whom these rules confer a privilege against disclosure waives the privilege 
if: 

the person or a predecessor of the person while holder of the privilege voluntarily 
discloses or consents to disclosure of any significant part of the privileged matter 
unless such disclosure itself is privileged; or 

the  person  or  a  representative  of  the  person  calls  a  person  to  whom  privileged 
communications have been made to testify as to the person’s character or character 
trait insofar as such communications are relevant to such character or character trait. 

 
Lawyer-Client Privilege and Work Product; Limitations on Waiver. 

Notwithstanding  paragraph 
the 
circumstances set out, to disclosure of a communication or information covered by 
the lawyer-client privilege or work-product protection. 

the  following  provisions  apply, 

(a), 

in 

Disclosure Made in a Federal or State Proceeding or to a Federal or State 
Office  or  Agency;  Scope  of  a  Waiver.  When  the  disclosure  is  made  in  a 
federal proceeding or state proceeding of any state or to a federal office or 
agency or state office or agency of any state and waives the lawyer-client 
privilege or work-product protection, the waiver extends to an undisclosed 
communication or information only if: 

(A) 

the waiver is intentional; 

(B) 

the  disclosed  and  undisclosed  communications  or 
information concern the same subject matter; and

(b) 
 

Inadvertent Disclosure in State Civil Proceedings. When made in a Texas 
state proceeding, an inadvertent disclosure does not operate as a waiver if 
the holder followed the procedures of Rule of Civil Procedure 193.3(d).  

Controlling  Effect  of  a  Court  Order.  A  disclosure  made  in  litigation 
pending before a federal court or a state court of any state that has entered 
an  order  that  the  privilege  or  protection  is  not  waived  by  disclosure 
connected with the litigation pending before that court is also not a waiver 
in a Texas state proceeding. 

Controlling Effect of a Party Agreement. An agreement on the effect of 
disclosure in a state proceeding of any state is binding only on the parties to 
the agreement, unless it is incorporated into a court order.

Comment to 2015 Restyling: The amendments to Rule 511 are designed to align Texas law with 
federal law on waiver of privilege by voluntary disclosure. Subsection (a) sets forth the general 
rule. Subsection (b) incorporates the provisions of Federal Rule of Evidence 502. Like the federal 
rule, subsection (b) only addresses disclosure of communications or information covered by the 
lawyer-client  privilege  or  work-product  protection.  These  amendments  do  not  affect  the  law 
governing waiver of other privileges or protections. 

ule 512. 

Privileged Matter Disclosed Under Compulsion or Without Opportunity to 
Claim Privilege 

 privilege claim is not defeated by a disclosure that was: 

a)  

compelled erroneously; or  

b)   made without opportunity to claim the privilege. 

Rule 513. 

Comment On or Inference From a Privilege Claim; Instruction 

Comment or Inference Not Permitted. Except as permitted in Rule 504(b)(2), neither the 
court  nor  counsel  may  comment  on  a  privilege  claim—whether  made  in  the  present 
proceeding or previously—and the factfinder may not draw an inference from the claim. 

Claiming Privilege Without the Jury’s Knowledge. To the extent practicable, the court 
must conduct a jury trial so that the making of a privilege claim is not suggested to the jury 
by any means.

instruct the jury accordingly.

Notes and Comments 

omment to 2015 Restyling: The text of the “Dead Man’s Rule” has been streamlined to clarify 
its meaning without making any substantive changes. The text of former Rule 601(b) (as well as 
its statutory predecessor, Vernon’s Ann. Civ. St. art. 3716) prohibits only a “party” from testifying 
about the dead man’s statements. Despite this, the last sentence of former Rule 601(b) requires the 
court to instruct the jury when the rule “prohibits an interested party or witness” from testifying. 
Because the rule prohibits only a “party” from testifying, restyled Rule 601(b)(4) references only 
“a party,” and not “an interested party or witness.” To be sure, courts have indicated that the rule 
(or  its  statutory  predecessor)  may  be  applicable  to  a  witness  who  is  not  nominally  a  party  and 
inapplicable to a witness who is only nominally a party. See, e.g., Chandler v. Welborn, 156 Tex. 
312,  294  S.W.2d  801,  809  (1956);  Ragsdale  v. Ragsdale,  142  Tex.  476,  179  S.W.2d  291,  295 
(1944).  But these decisions are based on an interpretation of the meaning of “party.” Therefore, 
limiting the court’s instruction under restyled Rule 601(b)(4) to “a party” does not change Texas 
practice. In addition, restyled Rule 601(b) deletes the sentence in former Rule 601(b) that states 
“[e]xcept for the foregoing, a witness is not precluded from giving evidence . . . because the witness 
is a party to the action . . .” This sentence is surplusage. Rule 601(b) is a rule of exclusion. If the 
testimony  falls  outside  the  rule  of  exclusion,  its  admissibility  will  be  determined  by  other 
applicable rules of evidence. 

 

ule 602.  

Need for Personal Knowledge  

 witness may testify to a matter only if evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that 
the  witness  has  personal  knowledge  of  the  matter. Evidence  to  prove  personal  knowledge  may 
consist of the witness’s own testimony. This rule does not apply to a witness’s expert testimony 
under Rule 703.  

ule 603.   Oath or Affirmation to Testify Truthfully  

efore testifying, a witness must give an oath or affirmation to testify truthfully. It must be in a 

form designed to impress that duty on the witness’s conscience.

Specific Instances of Conduct. Except for a criminal conviction under Rule 609, a party

conduct in order to attack or support the witness’s character for truthfulness. 

ule 609.  

Impeachment by Evidence of a Criminal Conviction  

In General. Evidence of a criminal conviction offered to attack a witness’s character for 
truthfulness must be admitted if: 

the crime was a felony or involved moral turpitude, regardless of punishment; 

the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to a party; and 

it is elicited from the witness or established by public record. 

Limit on Using the Evidence After 10 Years. This subdivision (b) applies if more than 
10  years  have  passed  since  the  witness’s  conviction  or  release  from  confinement for  it, 
whichever  is  later.  Evidence  of  the  conviction  is  admissible  only  if  its  probative  value, 
supported  by  specific  facts  and  circumstances,  substantially  outweighs  its  prejudicial 
effect. 

Effect  of  a  Pardon,  Annulment,  or  Certificate  of  Rehabilitation.  Evidence  of  a 
conviction is not admissible if:  

the  conviction  has  been  the  subject  of  a  pardon,  annulment,  certificate  of 
rehabilitation, or other equivalent procedure based on a finding that the person has 
been rehabilitated, and the person has not been convicted of a later crime that was 
classified as a felony or involved moral turpitude, regardless of punishment;  

probation has been satisfactorily completed for the conviction, and the person has 
not been convicted of a later crime that was classified as a felony or involved moral 
turpitude, regardless of punishment; or  
the  conviction  has  been  the  subject  of  a  pardon,  annulment,  or  other  equivalent 
procedure based on a finding of innocence. 

d) 

Juvenile Adjudications. Evidence of a juvenile adjudication is admissible under this rule 
only if:  

the witness is a party in a proceeding conducted under title 3 of the Texas Family 
Code; or  

the United States or Texas Constitution requires that it be admitted.

Notice.  Evidence  of  a  witness’s  conviction  is  not  admissible  under  this  rule  if,  after 
receiving  from  the  adverse  party  a  timely  written  request  specifying  the  witness,  the 
proponent of the conviction fails to provide sufficient written notice of intent to use the 
conviction. Notice is sufficient if it provides a fair opportunity to contest the use of such 
evidence.

a) 

Control by the Court; Purposes. The court should exercise reasonable control over the 
mode and order of examining witnesses and presenting evidence so as to:  

make those procedures effective for determining the truth;  

avoid wasting time; and  

protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.  

Scope of Cross-Examination. A witness may be cross-examined on any relevant matter, 
including credibility. 

Leading Questions. Leading questions should not be used on direct examination except 
as necessary to develop the witness’s testimony. Ordinarily, the court should allow leading 
questions:  

(1) 

on cross-examination; and  

when a party calls a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with 
an adverse party.

Scope. This rule gives an adverse party certain options when a witness uses a writing to 
refresh memory:  

(1) 

while testifying;  

2) 

before testifying, in civil cases, if the court decides that justice requires the party to 
have those options; or  

3) 

before testifying, in criminal cases. 

Adverse  Party’s  Options;  Deleting  Unrelated Matter.  An  adverse  party  is  entitled  to 
have the writing produced at the hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the witness about 
it, and to introduce in evidence any portion that relates to the witness’s testimony. If the 
producing party claims that the writing includes unrelated matter, the court must examine 
the writing in camera, delete any unrelated portion, and order that the rest be delivered to 
the adverse party. Any portion deleted over objection must be preserved for the record.  

Failure to Produce or Deliver the Writing. If a writing is not produced or is not delivered 
as  ordered,  the  court  may  issue  any  appropriate  order.  But  if  the  prosecution  does  not 
comply in a criminal case, the court must strike the witness’s testimony or—if justice so 
requires—declare a mistrial. 

ule 613.  Witness’s Prior Statement and Bias or Interest 

a)  Witness’s Prior Inconsistent Statement.  

(1) 

Foundation  Requirement.  When  examining  a  witness  about  the  witness’s  prior 
inconsistent statement—whether oral or written—a party must first tell the witness: 

(2)   Need Not Show Written Statement. If the witness’s prior inconsistent statement is 
written, a party need not show it to the witness before inquiring about it, but must, 
upon request, show it to opposing counsel. 

3)   Opportunity to Explain or Deny. A witness must be given the opportunity to explain 

or deny the prior inconsistent statement. 

Extrinsic Evidence. Extrinsic evidence of a witness’s prior inconsistent statement is 
not admissible unless the witness is first examined about the statement and fails to 
unequivocally admit making the statement.

to show the witness’s bias or interest. If examining a witness about a statement—
whether oral or written—to prove the witness’s bias or interest, a party must tell the 
witness:

2)   Need Not Show Written Statement. If a party uses a written statement to prove the 
witness’s bias or interest, a party need not show the statement to the witness before 
inquiring about it, but must, upon request, show it to opposing counsel. 

3)   Opportunity to Explain or Deny. A witness must be given the opportunity to explain 
or  deny  the  circumstances  or  statements  that  tend  to  show  the  witness’s  bias  or 
interest. And the witness’s proponent may present evidence to rebut the charge of 
bias or interest. 

4) 

Extrinsic  Evidence.  Extrinsic  evidence  of  a  witness’s  bias  or  interest  is  not 
admissible unless the witness is first examined about the bias or interest and fails to 
unequivocally admit it.  

(c)  Witness’s  Prior  Consistent  Statement.  Unless  Rule  801(e)(1)(B)  provides  otherwise,  a 
witness’s  prior  consistent  statement  is  not  admissible  if  offered  solely  to  enhance  the 
witness’s credibility. 
 

 

Notes and Comments 

omment to 2015 Restyling: The amended rule retains the requirement that a witness be given 
an opportunity to explain or deny (a) a prior inconsistent statement or (b) the circumstances or a 
statement  showing  the  witness’s  bias  or  interest,  but  this  requirement  is  not  imposed  on  the 
examining  attorney.  A  witness  may  have  to  wait  until  redirect  examination  to  explain  a  prior 
inconsistent statement or the circumstances or a statement that shows bias. But the impeaching 
attorney still is not permitted to introduce extrinsic evidence of the witness’s prior inconsistent 
statement or bias unless the witness has first been examined about the statement or bias and has 
failed to unequivocally admit it. All other changes to the rule are intended to be stylistic only.

Rule 614.  

Excluding Witnesses  

t  a  party’s  request,  the  court  must  order  witnesses  excluded  so  that  they  cannot  hear  other 
witnesses’ testimony. Or the court may do so on its own. But this rule does not authorize excluding:  

a) 

a party who is a natural person and, in civil cases, that person’s spouse;  

b)  

after being designated as the party’s representative by its attorney: 

in a civil case, an officer or employee of a party that is not a natural person; or 

in a criminal case, a defendant that is not a natural person;  

 
a person whose presence a party shows to be essential to presenting the party’s claim or 
defense; or  

the victim in a criminal case, unless the court determines that the victim’s testimony would 
be materially affected by hearing other testimony at the trial.  

ule 615.  

Producing a Witness’s Statement in Criminal Cases 

a)  Motion  to  Produce.  After  a  witness  other  than  the  defendant  testifies  on  direct 
examination, the court, on motion of a party who did not call the witness, must order an 
attorney  for  the  state  or  the  defendant  and  the  defendant’s  attorney  to  produce,  for  the 
examination and use of the moving party, any statement of the witness that:  

is in their possession; 

relates to the subject matter of the witness’s testimony; and  

has not previously been produced. 

Producing the Entire Statement. If the entire statement relates to the subject matter of 
the witness’s testimony, the court must order that the statement be delivered to the moving 
party. 

Producing  a  Redacted  Statement.  If  the  party  who  called  the  witness  claims  that  the 
statement contains information that does not relate to the subject matter of the witness’s 
testimony,  the  court  must  inspect  the  statement  in  camera.  After  excising  any  unrelated 
portions, the court must order delivery of the redacted statement to the moving party. If a 
party objects to an excision, the court must preserve the entire statement with the excised 
portion indicated, under seal, as part of the record.

Recess to Examine a Statement. If the court orders production of a witness’s statement, 
the  court,  on  request,  must  recess  the  proceedings  to  allow  the  moving  party  time  to 
examine the statement and prepare for its use. 

Sanction  for  Failure  to  Produce  or  Deliver  a  Statement.  If  the  party  who  called  the 
witness  disobeys  an  order  to  produce  or  deliver  a  statement,  the  court  must  strike  the 
witness’s  testimony  from  the  record.  If  an  attorney  for  the  state  disobeys  the  order,  the 
court must declare a mistrial if justice so requires. 

f) 

“Statement” Defined. As used in this rule, a witness’s “statement’’ means: 

a  written  statement  that  the  witness  makes  and  signs,  or  otherwise  adopts  or 
approves; 

a substantially verbatim, contemporaneously recorded recital of the witness’s oral 
statement that is contained in any recording or any transcription of a recording; or 

the  witness’s  statement  to  a  grand  jury,  however  taken  or  recorded,  or  a 
transcription of such a statement.

Notes and Comments 

omment to 1998 change: This is prior Rule of Criminal Evidence 614. 

omment to 2015 Amendment:  The Michael Morton Act, codified at Texas Code of Criminal 
Procedure art. 39.14, affords defendants substantial pre-trial discovery, requiring the state, upon 
request from the defendant, to produce and permit the defendant to inspect and copy various items, 
including witness statements.  In many instances, therefore, art. 39.14 eliminates the need, after 
the  witness  testifies  on  direct  examination,  for  a  defendant  to  request,  and  the  court  to  order, 
production of a witness’s statement. 

ut art. 39.14 does not entirely eliminate the need for in-trial discovery of witness statements. Art. 
39.14 does not extend equivalent discovery rights to the prosecution, and so prosecutors will still 
need  to  use  Rule  615  to  obtain  witness  statements  of  defense  witnesses.    Moreover,  some 
defendants may fail to exercise their discovery rights under art. 39.14 and so may wish to obtain a 
witness  statement  under  Rule  615.    In  addition,  the  Michael  Morton  Act  applies  only  to  the 
prosecution  of  offenses  committed  after  December  31,  2013.    Defendants  on  trial  for  offenses 
committed before then have no right to pre-trial discovery of the witness statements of prosecution 
witnesses. 

onsequently,  Rule  615(a)  has  been  amended  to  account  for  the  changed  pre-trial  discovery 
regime  introduced  by  the  Michael  Morton  Act.    If  a  party’s  adversary  has  already  produced  a 
witness’s statement – whether through formal discovery under art. 39.14 or through more informal 
means – Rule 615(a) no longer gives a party the right to obtain, after the witness testifies on direct 
examination, a court order for production of the witness’s statement.  But if a party’s adversary 
has not already produced a witness’s statement, the party may still use Rule 615(a) to request and

OPINIONS AND EXPERT TESTIMONY 
 

ule 701.   Opinion Testimony by Lay Witnesses  

f a witness is not testifying as an expert, testimony in the form of an opinion is limited to one that 
is:  

rationally based on the witness’s perception; and 

helpful to clearly understanding the witness’s testimony or to determining a fact in issue. 

Notes and Comments 

omment  to  2015  Restyling:  All  references  to  an  “inference”  have  been  deleted  because  this 
makes  the  Rule  flow  better  and  easier  to  read,  and  because  any  “inference”  is  covered  by  the 
broader term “opinion.” Courts have not made substantive decisions on the basis of any distinction 
between an opinion and an inference. No change in current practice is intended. 

ule 702.  

Testimony by Expert Witnesses  

 witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may 
testify  in  the  form  of  an  opinion  or  otherwise  if  the  expert’s  scientific,  technical,  or  other 
specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact 
in issue. 

ule 703.  

Bases of an Expert’s Opinion Testimony  

n expert may base an opinion on facts or data in the case that the expert has been made aware of, 
reviewed, or personally observed. If experts in the particular field would reasonably rely on those 
kinds of facts or data in forming an opinion on the subject, they need not be admissible for the 
opinion to be admitted.

n opinion is not objectionable just because it embraces an ultimate issue.  

ule 705. 

Disclosing the Underlying Facts or Data and Examining an Expert About 
Them 

Stating an Opinion Without Disclosing the Underlying Facts or Data. Unless the court 
orders  otherwise,  an  expert  may  state  an  opinion—and  give  the  reasons  for  it—without 
first testifying to the underlying facts or data. But the expert may be required to disclose 
those facts or data on cross-examination. 

Voir Dire  Examination  of an Expert  About the Underlying Facts or Data.  Before  an 
expert states an opinion or discloses the underlying facts or data, an adverse party in a civil 
case  may—or  in  a  criminal  case  must—be  permitted  to  examine  the  expert  about  the 
underlying facts or data. This examination must take place outside the jury’s hearing. 

c) 

Admissibility of Opinion. An expert’s opinion is inadmissible if the underlying facts or data 
do not provide a sufficient basis for the opinion. 

d)  When  Otherwise  Inadmissible  Underlying  Facts  or  Data  May  Be  Disclosed; 
Instructing the Jury. If the underlying facts or data would otherwise be inadmissible, the 
proponent  of  the  opinion  may  not  disclose  them  to  the  jury  if  their  probative  value  in 
helping the jury evaluate the opinion is outweighed by their prejudicial effect. If the court 
allows  the  proponent  to  disclose  those  facts  or  data  the  court  must,  upon  timely  request, 
restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly. 

 

 

 

Notes and Comments

801(e)(2)  are  no  longer  referred  to  as  “admissions”  in  the  title  to  the  subdivision.  The  term 
“admissions” is confusing because not all statements covered by the exclusion are admissions in 
the colloquial sense—a statement can be within the exclusion even if it “admitted” nothing and 
was not against the party’s interest when made. The term “admissions” also raises confusion in 
comparison  with  the  Rule  803(24)  exception  for  declarations  against  interest.  No  change  in 
application of the exclusion is intended. 

he deletion of former Rule 801(e)(1)(D), which cross-references Code of Criminal Procedure art. 
38.071, is not intended as a substantive change. Including this cross-reference made sense when 
the Texas Rules of Criminal Evidence were first promulgated, but with subsequent changes to the 
statutory provision, its inclusion is no longer appropriate. The version of article 38.071 that was 
initially cross-referenced in the Rules of Criminal Evidence required the declarant-victim to be 
available to testify at the trial. That requirement has since been deleted from the statute, and the 
statute no longer requires either the availability or testimony of the declarant-victim. Thus, cross-
referencing the statute in Rule 801(e)(1), which applies only when the declarant testifies at trial 
about the prior statement, no longer makes sense. Moreover, article 38.071 is but one of a number

  T

of statutes that mandate the admission of certain hearsay statements in particular circumstances. 
See,  e.g.,  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  art.  38.072;  Family  Code  §§  54.031,  104.002,  104.006. 
These  statutory  provisions  take  precedence  over  the  general  rule  excluding  hearsay,  see  Rules 
101(c) and 802, and there is no apparent justification for cross-referencing article 38.071 and not 
all other such provisions.  

nadmissible hearsay admitted without objection may not be denied probative value merely because 
it is hearsay. 

Present  Sense  Impression.  A  statement  describing  or  explaining  an  event  or 
condition, made while or immediately after the declarant perceived it.  

Excited  Utterance.  A  statement  relating  to  a  startling  event  or  condition,  made 
while the declarant was under the stress of excitement that it caused.  

Then-Existing  Mental,  Emotional,  or  Physical  Condition.  A  statement  of  the 
declarant’s  then-existing  state  of  mind  (such  as  motive,  intent,  or  plan)  or 
emotional, sensory, or physical condition (such as mental feeling, pain, or bodily 
health),  but  not  including  a  statement  of  memory  or  belief  to  prove  the  fact 
remembered or believed unless it relates to the validity or terms of the declarant’s 
will.

and Remedies Code, which allows evidence of only those medical expenses that have been paid 
or will be paid, after any required credits or adjustments. See Haygood v. Escabedo, 356 S.W.3d 
390 (Tex. 2011). The records attached to the affidavit must also meet the admissibility standard of 
Haygood, 356 S.W.3d at 399-400 (“[O]nly evidence of recoverable medical expenses is admissible 
at trial.”). 

omment to 2014 Change: At the direction of the Legislature, the requirement that records be 
filed with the court before trial has been removed. See Act of May 17, 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 
560, § 3, 2013 Tex. Gen. Laws 1509, 1510 (SB 679). The word “affidavit” in this rule includes an 
unsworn declaration made under penalty of perjury. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 132.001. The 
reference to “any other requirements of law” incorporates the requirements of Sections 18.001 and 
18.002 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code for affidavits offered as prima facie proof of the 
cost or necessity of services or medical expenses. The form medical expenses affidavit that was 
added  to  this  rule  in  2013  has  been  removed  as  unnecessary.  It  can  now  be  found  in  Section 
18.002(b-1) of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code.

A  “recording”  consists  of  letters,  words,  numbers,  or  their  equivalent  recorded  in  any 
manner.  

A “photograph” means a photographic image or its equivalent stored in any form.  

An  “original”  of  a  writing  or  recording  means  the  writing  or  recording  itself  or  any 
counterpart intended to have the same effect by the person who executed or issued it. For 
electronically stored information, “original” means any printout—or other output readable 
by sight—if it accurately reflects the information. An “original” of a photograph includes 
the negative or a print from it.  

A  “duplicate”  means  a  counterpart  produced  by  a  mechanical,  photographic,  chemical, 
electronic, or other equivalent process or technique that accurately reproduces the original.  

ule 1002.   Requirement of the Original  

n original writing, recording, or photograph is required in order to prove its content unless these 

rules or other law provides otherwise.  

ule 1003.   Admissibility of Duplicates  

 duplicate is admissible to the same extent as the original unless a question is raised about the 

original’s authenticity or the circumstances make it unfair to admit the duplicate.  

ule 1004.   Admissibility of Other Evidence of Content  

n original is not required and other evidence of the content of a writing, recording, or photograph 

is admissible if:  

all the originals are lost or destroyed, unless the proponent lost or destroyed them in bad 
faith; 

an original cannot be obtained by any available judicial process;  

an original is not located in Texas; 

the party against whom the original would be offered had control of the original; was at 
that time put on notice, by pleadings or otherwise, that the original would be a subject of 
proof at the trial or hearing; and fails to produce it at the trial or hearing; or  

e) 

the writing, recording, or photograph is not closely related to a controlling issue.

Rule 1005.   Copies of Public Records to Prove Content  

he proponent may use a copy to prove the content of an official record—or of a document that 
was  recorded  or  filed  in  a  public  office  as  authorized  by  law—if  these  conditions  are  met:  the 
record or document is otherwise admissible; and the copy is certified as correct in accordance with 
Rule 902(4) or is testified to be correct by a witness who has compared it with the original. If no 
such copy can be obtained by reasonable diligence, then the proponent may use other evidence to 
prove the content.  

ule 1006.   Summaries to Prove Content  

he  proponent  may  use  a  summary,  chart,  or  calculation  to  prove  the  content  of  voluminous 
writings, recordings, or photographs that cannot be conveniently examined in court. The proponent 
must  make  the  originals  or  duplicates  available  for  examination  or  copying,  or  both,  by  other 
parties at a reasonable time and place. And the court may order the proponent to produce them in 
court.  

ule 1007.   Testimony or Statement of a Party to Prove Content  

he  proponent may  prove  the  content  of  a  writing,  recording,  or  photograph  by  the  testimony, 
deposition, or written statement of the party against whom the evidence is offered. The proponent 
need not account for the original.  

ule 1008.   Functions of the Court and Jury  

rdinarily, the court determines whether the proponent has fulfilled the factual conditions for 
admitting other evidence of the content of a writing, recording, or photograph under Rule 1004 
or 1005. But in a jury trial, the jury determines—in accordance with Rule 104(b)—any issue 
about whether:  

an asserted writing, recording, or photograph ever existed;  

another one produced at the trial or hearing is the original; or  

other evidence of content accurately reflects the content.  

Submitting a Translation. A translation of a foreign language document is admissible if, at 
least 45 days before trial, the proponent serves on all parties: 

the translation and the underlying foreign language document; and

a qualified translator’s affidavit or unsworn declaration that sets forth the translator’s 
qualifications and certifies that the translation is accurate.   

b)  Objection. When objecting to a translation’s accuracy, a party should specifically indicate 
its  inaccuracies and offer  an  accurate  translation. A  party must  serve the objection  on  all 
parties at least 15 days before trial.  

c) 

Effect of Failing to Object or Submit a Conflicting Translation. If the underlying foreign 
language document is otherwise admissible, the court must admit—and may not allow a party 
to attack the accuracy of—a translation submitted under subdivision (a) unless the party has: 

submitted a conflicting translation under subdivision (a); or 

objected to the translation under subdivision (b). 

Effect of Objecting or Submitting a Conflicting Translation.  If conflicting translations 
are submitted under subdivision (a) or an objection is made under subdivision (b), the court 
must determine whether there is a genuine issue about the accuracy of a material part of the 
translation. If so, the trier of fact must resolve the issue. 

Qualified Translator May Testify. Except for subdivision (c), this rule does not preclude a 
party from  offering  the testimony of  a  qualified translator  to translate  a  foreign  language 
document.  

Time Limits. On a party’s motion and for good cause, the court may alter this rule’s time 
limits.  

Court-Appointed Translator. If necessary, the court may appoint a qualified translator. 
The reasonable value of the translator’s services must be taxed as court costs.
