      <pre>Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 
Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 

   

APPEAL NO.: 

16-018 

ESPONDENT: 

Judge David Crain, 331st Criminal District Court 

ATE: 

 

March 8, 2017 

 

 

 

PECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge Steve Ables, Chairman; Judge David Peeples; Judge Missy 
Medary; Judge Dean Rucker; Judge David L. Evans  

Petitioner requested from Respondent “any and all documents which reflect the time that 
Judge David Crain left the Blackwell-Thurman Criminal Justice Center on September 2, 2014 or 
which reflect that he was in the building until 5:00 p.m., including but not limited to calendar entries, 
computer usage records, computer log-in and log-out records, e-mails opened or sent, phone calls 
received or made, security pass data for the judge’s garage door and security pass data for the judge’s 
elevator door.”  Respondent informed Petitioner that no calendar entries existed and denied the 
request for the other information. Petitioner then filed this appeal.  Respondent replied to the petition 
but did not provide any records for this committee’s review. 

espondent asserts the information is exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5(b) and Rule 
12.5(i).  Rule 12.5(b) exempts “any record, including a security plan or code, the release of which 
would jeopardize the security of an individual against physical injury or jeopardize information or 
property against theft, tampering, improper use, illegal disclosure, trespass, unauthorized access, or 
physical injury.”  Rule 12.5(i), exempts information that is confidential under a “state or federal 
constitutional  provision,  statute,  or  common-law.”  Respondent  asserts  that  the  responsive 
information is made confidential by Government Code Sec. 418.182(a), a provision of the Texas 
Homeland  Security  Act.  This  section  reads:  “Except  as  provided  by  Subsections  (b)  and  (c), 
information, including access codes and passwords, in the possession of a governmental entity that 
relates to the specifications, operating procedures, or location of a security system used to protect 
public or private property from an act of terrorism or related criminal activity is confidential.”

arage door and elevator security pass data1 

We first address whether security pass data for Respondent’s garage door and elevator is 
exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5(b) and (i).  Respondent argues that the release of this data 
would jeopardize Respondent’s security against physical injury and should be withheld based on 

                                                 
1 We note that garage door and elevator security pass data is usually created and maintained by the Sheriff’s Office 
or other entity responsible for courthouse security, not by the judiciary.  However, because Respondent indicates that 
this data is in Respondent’s possession and therefore, arguably, it is being maintained by the judiciary, we will 
address the exemptions Respondent has raised.

security concerns.    Petitioner cited several Office of the Attorney General (OAG) letter rulings 
interpreting a comparable Public Information Act provision in support of his argument. Though we 
agree that the collection of security pass access data over a time-period may be used to determine a 
pattern of a person’s comings and goings and consequently pose a security risk, we are not convinced 
that the release of this information for a one-day period indicating whether a person is in the building 
at a specific time would enable this type of observation or jeopardize Respondent’s security against 
physical injury.  The OAG letter rulings cited by Respondent do not persuade us otherwise.  All of 
the  cited  letter  rulings  appear  to  involve  requests  for  records  spanning  more  than  a  day  where 
patterns could be detected.  Because the requested record is limited to one day, if such a record exists 
and is in the possession of Respondent, we conclude that it is not exempt from disclosure under Rule 
12.5(b).  We note, however, that this conclusion should not be interpreted to mean that garage and 
elevator security pass records are never exempt under Rule 12.5(b).  Our conclusion is limited to the 
facts of this appeal. 
 

Respondent also maintains that these records are confidential under Sec. 418.182(a) of 
the Government Code and are therefore exempt under Rule 12.5(i). Respondent asserts that the 
responsive information “was collected, assembled and maintained for the purpose of providing 
security for the courthouse and judges, and to prevent any criminal acts.” Though we agree that 
this may be the case, we do not believe that these records relate “to the specifications, operating 
procedures, or location of a security system used to protect public or private property from an act 
of terrorism or related criminal activity.”  Accordingly, we conclude that these records are not 
exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5(i). 

e next address Petitioner’s request for computer usage records and computer log-in and 
log-out records. A special committee considered the release of these records in Rule 12 Decision No. 
16-010.  In that appeal, Petitioner had requested a judge’s computer log-on and log-off times for a 
two-year time period. The panel noted that the requested information is not the type that judicial 
officers ordinarily make or maintain in the regular course of business and questioned whether the 
information existed or would need to be created. The panel concluded that if the report did not exist 
it did not have to be created.  

 
 
Following the analysis of Rule 12 Decision No. 16-010, if the requested information does not 
exist, Respondent does not have to create it.  If the information exists, we are unable to conclude 
how the release of one record indicating whether Respondent was in the building on a specific date 
would jeopardize Respondent’s security against physical injury or jeopardize information or property 
against theft. Additionally, we do not believe this information “relates to the specifications, operating 
procedures, or location of a security system used to protect public or private property from an act of 
terrorism or related criminal activity” so that it is covered by Sec. 418.182(a) of the Government 
Code.  

Computer usage and log-in/log-out records 

 

  W

 

E-mail and phone call records 

 
 
Respondent also raises Rule 12.5(b) and (i) as the basis for withholding “e-mails opened or 
sent” and “phone calls received or made” that reflect the time Respondent left the criminal justice 
center on a specific date or which reflect that he was in the building until a specific time. As a result 

 

 

 

 

of  modern  technology  that  enables  individuals  to  work  outside  of  the  office,  the  time  stamp 
indicating when an email was sent does not necessarily confirm that a person was in fact in the office 
when the email was sent.  Therefore, the release of emails with this information would not jeopardize 
Respondent’s security against physical injury.  Respondent did not indicate if records of “phone calls 
received or made” exist.  If they do not exist, they do not have to be created.  If they do exist, we do 
not believe that the release of this information would jeopardizes Respondent’s security against 
physical injury.  Accordingly, these records are not exempt under Rule 12.5(b) or 12.5(i). 

onclusion 

  C

 

In summary, we conclude that the responsive records, if they exist, are not exempt from 
disclosure under Rule 12.5(b) or (i).  However, we are mindful of the potential security concerns and 
risks that judicial officers sometimes face.  Therefore, because we have reached this decision without 
the benefit of reviewing the responsive records, we give Respondent leave to submit any responsive 
records for our in camera review to ensure that they are not exempt from disclosure.  If Respondent 
chooses not to submit the responsive records for our review, they should be released to Petitioner.
