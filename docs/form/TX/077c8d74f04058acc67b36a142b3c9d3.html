requirements  include  the  definitions,  substantial  involvement,  reference,  and  other  certification 
and recertification requirements for the specialty area.  You will also need to refer to the Standards 
for  Attorney  Certification,  Part  I  –  General  Requirements  for  requirements  that  apply  to  all 
specialty areas. 
 

SECTION XX 
CHILD WELFARE LAW 

DEFINITIONS.   
1. 

“Child welfare law” involves litigating suits under Title 5, Subtitle E of the Texas 
Family  Code  and  issues  that  arise  in  suits  by  a  governmental  entity  for  the 
protection  of  an  abused  or  neglected  child,  including  but  not  limited  to  the 
possession and conservatorship of a child, the termination of parental rights, the 
placement of a child in foster care, or the adoption of a child.   Practitioners of child 
welfare law must have: 

  knowledge  of  applicable  federal  law,  including  the  Indian  Child  Welfare 
Act,  the  Adoption  and  Safe  Families  Act,  the  Fostering  Connections  to 
Success  and  Adoption  Act,  the  Safe  and  Stable  Families  Act,  the 
Strengthening Families Act, the Every Student Succeeds Act, constitutional 
law, education law, immigration law, and disability law; 

  knowledge of applicable state law, including the Texas Education Code, the 

Texas Penal Code, guardianship law, and juvenile law; and 

  experience in the trial or appeal of judicial or administrative  proceedings 
involving a governmental entity for the protection of an abused or neglected 
child.  

“Lead  counsel”  is  the  lawyer  who  takes  primary  responsibility  for  the 
representation of the client in the case.  To be considered lead counsel in a case at 
the trial level, the applicant must make an opening statement or closing argument, 
and conduct significant direct and cross-examination of live witnesses at trial.  To 
be  considered  lead  counsel  in  an  appeal,  applicant  must  be  a  signatory  to  and 
perform substantial work in drafting the briefs for that party. 
“Post-trial  proceedings”  include  prosecuting  or  defending  against  an  appeal  or 
original proceeding in an intermediate appellate court or in the Supreme Court of 
Texas and proceedings to correct an action of the trial court incident to an appeal.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
