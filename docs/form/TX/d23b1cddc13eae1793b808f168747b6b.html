Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: This is former Rule 4.  Subdivision 9.4, prescribing the form 
of  documents  filed  in  the  appellate  courts,  is  changed  and  the  form  to  be  used  is  stated  in 
significantly  more  detail.  Former  subdivisions  (f)  and  (g),  regarding  service  of  documents,  are 
merged into subdivision 9.5.  Former Rule 6 is included as subdivision 9.6, but no substantive 
change is made.  Other changes are made throughout the rule. Electronic filing is authorized by 
§§ 51.801-.807 of the Government Code. 

Comment to 2002 change:  The change [to Rule 9.5(a)] clarifies that the filing party must 
serve a copy of the document filed on all other parties, not only in an appeal or review, but in 
original  proceedings  as  well.    The  rule  applies  only  to  filing  parties.    Thus,  when  the  clerk  or 
court reporter is responsible for filing the record, as in cases on appeal, a copy need not be served 
on the parties.  The rule for original civil proceedings, in which a party is responsible for filing 
the record, is stated in subdivision 52.7.

reference all or part of another party’s filing. 

Comment to 2008 change: Subdivision 9.3 is amended to reduce the number of copies of 
a motion for extension of time or response filed in the Supreme Court.  Subdivision 9.8 is new.  
To  protect  the  privacy  of  minors  in  suits  affecting  the  parent-child  relationship  (SAPCR), 
including  suits  to  terminate  parental  rights,  Section  109.002(d)  of  the  Family  Code  authorizes 
appellate  courts,  in  their  opinions,  to  identify  parties  only  by  fictitious  names  or  by  initials.  
Similarly, Section  56.01(j) of the Family Code  prohibits identification  of  a  minor  or  a  minor’s 
family  in  an  appellate  opinion  related  to  juvenile  court  proceedings.    But  as  appellate  briefing 
becomes  more  widely  available  through  electronic  media  sources,  appellate  courts’  efforts  to 
protect minors’ privacy by disguising their identities in appellate opinions may be defeated if the 
same  children  are fully identified in briefs  and  other  court papers  available  to  the public.  The 
rule provides protection from such disclosures.  Any fictitious name should not be pejorative or 
suggest  the  person’s  true  identity.    The  rule  does  not  limit  an  appellate  court’s  authority  to 
disguise parties’ identities in appropriate circumstances in other cases.  Although appellate courts 
are authorized  to enforce the  rule’s provisions requiring  redaction,  parties  and amici  curiae are 
responsible for ensuring that briefs and other papers submitted to the court fully comply with the 
rule. 

Comment to 2012 Change: Rule 9 is revised to consolidate all length limits and establish 
word  limits  for  documents  produced  on  a  computer.  All  documents  produced  on  a  computer 
must comply with the word limits. Page limits are retained for documents that are typewritten or 
otherwise not produced on a computer. 

Comment to 2013 Change: Rule 9 is revised to incorporate rules for electronic filing, in 
accordance  with  the  Supreme  Court’s  order  –  Misc.  Docket  No.  12-9206,  amended  by  Misc. 
Docket Nos. 13-9092 and 13-9164 – mandating electronic filing in civil cases in appellate courts, 
effective  January  1,  2014.    In  addition,  Rule  9.9  is  added  to  provide  privacy  protection  for  all 
documents, both paper and electronic, filed in civil cases in appellate courts.

Redacted  Filings.   Unless a court orders otherwise, an  electronic or paper filing 

(b) 
with the court, including the contents of any appendices, must not contain sensitive data. 

(c) 
Redaction procedures.   Sensitive data must be redacted by using the letter “X” in 
place  of  each  omitted  digit  or  character  or  by  removing  the  sensitive  data  in  a  manner 
indicating that the data has been redacted.  The filer must retain an unredacted version of 
the filed document during the pendency of the appeal and any related proceedings filed 
within three years of the date the judgment is signed. If a district court clerk or appellate 
court  clerk  discovers  unredacted  sensitive  data  in  the  record,  the  clerk  shall  notify  the 
parties and seek a ruling from the court. 

Certification.   The filing of a document constitutes a certification by the filer that 

(d) 
the document complies with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this rule. 

(e) 
Reference List.   If a filer believes any information described in paragraph (a) of 
this rule is essential to a document or that the document would be confusing without the 
information, the filer may submit the information to the court in a reference list that is in 
paper form and under seal. The reference list must specify an appropriate identifier that 
corresponds  uniquely  to  each  item  listed.  Any  reference  in  the  document  to  a  listed 
identifier will be construed to refer to the corresponding item of information. If the filer 
provides a reference list pursuant to this rule, the front page of the document containing 
the  redacted  information  must  indicate  that  the  reference  list  has  been,  or  will  be, 
provided. On its own initiative, the court may order a sealed reference list in any case.  

(f) 
Sealed materials.   Materials that are required by statute to be sealed, redacted, or 
kept confidential, such as the items set out in Articles 35.29 (Personal Information About 
Jurors), 38.45 (Evidence Depicting or Describing Abuse of or Sexual Conduct by Child 
or Minor), and 42.12, § 9(j), must be treated in accordance with the pertinent statutes and 
shall not be publicly available on the Internet. A court may also order that a document be 
filed under seal in paper form or electronic form, without redaction. The court may later 
unseal the document or order the filer to provide a redacted version of the document for 
the public record. If a court orders material sealed, whether it be sensitive data or other 
materials, the court’s sealing order must be affixed to the outside of the sealed container 
if the sealed material is filed in paper form, or be the first document that appears if filed 
in electronic form.  Sealed portions of the clerk's and reporter's records should be clearly 
marked and separated from unsealed portions and tendered as separate records, whether

On receiving the clerk’s record from the trial court clerk or the reporter’s record from the 
 
reporter,  the  appellate  clerk  must  determine  whether  each  complies  with  the  Supreme  Court’s 
and Court of Criminal Appeals’ order on preparation of the record. If so, the clerk must endorse 
on each the date of receipt, file it, and notify the parties of the filing and the date. If not, the clerk 
must endorse on the clerk’s record or reporter’s record — whichever is defective — the date of 
receipt and return it to the official responsible for filing it. The appellate court clerk must specify 
the defects and  instruct the  official  to correct the defects and return the record  to the  appellate 
court by a specified date.  In a criminal case, the record must not be posted on the Internet.

copy  of  the  official  form.  The  clerk  of  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  may,  without  filing  an 
application that does not comply with this rule, return it to the clerk of the convicting court, with 
a notation of the defect, and  the clerk of  the  convicting  court  will  return  the application to the 
person who filed it, with a copy of the official form dismiss an application that does not comply 
with these rules.

RELIEF TO WHICH HE MAY BE ENTITLED IN THIS PROCEEDING. 

VERIFICATION 

This  application  must  be  verified  or  it  will  be  dismissed  for  non-compliance.    For 
verification purposes, an applicant is a person filing the application on his or her own behalf.  A 
petitioner is a person filing the application on behalf of an applicant, for example, an applicant’s 
attorney.  An inmate is a person who is in custody. 

The inmate applicant must sign either the “Oath Before a Notary Public” before a notary 
public or the “Inmate’s Declaration” without a notary public.  If the inmate is represented by a 
licensed attorney, the attorney may sign the “Oath Before a Notary Public” as petitioner and then 
complete  “Petitioner’s  Information.”    A  non-inmate  applicant  must  sign  the  “Oath  Before  a 
Notary Public” before a notary public unless he is represented by a licensed attorney, in which 
case the attorney may sign the verification as petitioner.   

A non-inmate non-attorney petitioner must sign the “Oath Before a Notary Public” before 
a notary  public and  must also  complete  “Petitioner’s  Information.”  An inmate  petitioner must

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
