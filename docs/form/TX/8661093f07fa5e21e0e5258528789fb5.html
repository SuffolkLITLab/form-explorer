Court of Appeals 
Eighth District of Texas 
500 E. San Antonio, Suite 1203 
El Paso, Texas 79901 
(915) 546-2240 
 

In 2004,  the Appellate Section of the State Bar of Texas and the Courts of Appeals worked together to identify key information 
needed  by  appellate  attorneys  and  pro  se  litigants  to  practice  effectively  before  the  court.   To  assist  the  court  in  this  effort,  the 
Appellate Section collected and formatted the relevant information and published it in the Appellate Advocate in February 2005.  This 
information was updated in August 31, 2015, and the court intends to keep the information current for the use of persons with matters 
before the court.

e-filing, with two 
exceptions: (1) when 
the court requests that 
a sealed record be 
paper filed and (2) 
when the court grants 
an exceptional request 
by a clerk or reporter 
to file all or part of the 
appellate record via 
paper or other physical 
media. 

n parental termination 
and child protection 
cases, extensions may 
not exceed 30 days 
total and may not be 
granted in all appeals. 
TRAP 28.4(b)(2). 
 
Motions are considered 
on a daily basis.  The 
court sometimes 
provides notice that a 
motion will be decided 
on a certain date.  
Agreed motions may 
be ruled upon 
immediately. 
The court has a local 
rule requiring that the 
trial judge be identified 
in the list of parties and 
counsel.  

  I

Motions 

Should be electronically 
filed.  But if not 
electronically filed, only 
the original should be 
filed.   

Motions are decided as follows:  for 
pre-submission motions, a single judge 
referred to as the motions judge rules 
on the motion; after submission, a 
motion may be decided by the author 
or the panel.  The motions judge 
rotation lasts one month. 

All motions are reviewed for compliance with 
TRAP 9 and 10.  In civil cases, any applicable 
fee must be paid or the motion will not be 
acted on by the clerk, motions judge, or the 
court.   

Briefs 

Should be electronically 
filed.  But if not 
electronically filed, only 
the unbound original 
should be filed.  See 
TRAP 9.3(a). 

The court has a local rule addressing 
briefs in cross-appeals.  The court 
follows TRAP 38.7 with respect to 
amended and supplemental briefs.  
The court generally permits the parties 
to file letters of authority without 
leave of court. 

There are no unique requirements for briefs in 
original proceedings in this court.

HOW HANDLED 

COURT’S PARTICULAR PRACTICES 

SPECIAL NOTES 

Upon proper notice to 
the parties, the court 
may hear oral 
argument through the 
use of 
Teleconferencing 
technology. See 
TEX.GOV’T CODE 
§§22.302, 73.003(e). 
 

Cases are randomly assigned by draw when 
the cases are being scheduled for submission.   

 

The court reviews all briefs to determine 
whether a request for oral argument should be 
granted.  A party or attorney requesting oral 
argument should provide in the brief a 
statement explaining why oral argument 
should be granted.  See TRAP 38.1(e).  If a 
party files a motion to vacate oral argument, 
the court may deny the motion and submit the 
case without oral argument.  If only one party 
requests oral argument, the court will permit 
both appellant and appellee to argue.   
There is no set time when voting occurs.  The 
panel discusses a case set with oral argument 
both before and after argument.  After 
argument, the authoring judge circulates the 
opinion to the other judges for decision. 

The court generally releases its opinions on 
Thursdays, but an opinion may be issued on 
any business day.   
 

 

 

 

The court reviews the 
petition, response, and 
any reply to determine 
whether a request for 
oral argument should 
be granted.

where the party files a motion 
requesting additional time at least one 
week prior to the scheduled argument 
date.
