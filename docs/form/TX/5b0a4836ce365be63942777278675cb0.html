ntroduction 

s part of the 87th Regular Legislative Session, SB 907 passed relating to the application for and 

issuance of a marriage license through the use of remote technology. The bill provides an 
amendment to Subchapter A, Chapter 2 of the Family code by adding Section 2.009- Application 
For And Issuance Of License Through Remote Technology and Subchapter C, Chapter 71 of the 
Government code by adding Section 71.039-Procedures for Issuance of Marriage License 
Through Remote Technology. SB 907

Bill Analysis 

uthor’s/Sponsor’s Statement of Intent 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many county clerk offices closed their doors or imposed restrictions 
that limited the number of people that could appear in person at one time. While this created a 
number of challenges, it was particularly problematic for couples that wanted to apply for a marriage 
license. Current law requires that each person applying for a marriage license must appear before the 
county clerk. For many people this meant they could not apply for and be issued a marriage license. 
In essence, if couples could not physically appear before the county clerk, then they could not obtain 
a marriage license. 
  
SB 907 will allow county clerks to voluntarily become certified to issue marriage licenses to applicants 
through the use of remote technology. If a county clerk becomes certified, couples will be able to 
apply for a marriage license using remote technology and they will be considered to have appeared 
before the county clerk as required by statute. This bill will also allow the certified county clerk to 
issue marriage licenses to couples through the use of remote technology after they have applied. 

ulemaking authority is expressly granted to the Texas Judicial Council in SECTION 2 (Section 

ULEMAKING AUTHORITY 

71.039, Government Code) of this bill.

rocedure for Certification 

or certification requested by a County Clerk, the Office of Court Administration (OCA) will: 

1.  Provide an application and checklist, outlining the requirements of the procedures for obtaining 

a certificate. The checklist will include the criteria outlined in the rule.  

2.  If a clerk will be utilizing a vendor to perform remote receipt of an application for a marriage 

license and for issuance of a marriage license, a demonstration of the product will be provided 
to OCA to ensure all requirements are met.  

3.  If a clerk will be developing their own county system for a remote process, the same criteria of 

a vendor will be applied.  

4.  Upon determining the system complies with requirements (real-time visual and audio 

communication, ability to send and receive written documentation, etc.), OCA will issue a 
certificate to the clerk of the court, approving the system.  

5.  As vendors are approved to provide the services to the clerk, a list will be maintained by OCA 

to alleviate the requirement for future demonstration.  Once the vendor is on the OCA 
Approved Vendor list, the clerk will be issued a certificate upon proof of contract/services with 
the selected vendor. 

6.  OCA will maintain information and required forms on the website www.txcourts.gov. Forms 

include an application and checklist. 

7.  The request for issuance of a certificate should be submitted to: CourtServices@txcourts.gov. 
Upon approval the Remote Marriage Licenses Certificate will be provided to the requesting 
clerk electronically, to the email address provided on the application.  

Conclusion 
The ability for remote acceptance of marriage license applications and remote issuance of marriage 
license provides the ability for couples to appear remotely, eliminating the need to personally appear 
before the county clerk.  Because this service is not a required option for a clerk to offer, only those 
clerks who make a request for certification will be issued a certificate.
