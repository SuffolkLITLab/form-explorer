hat is an Order of Nondisclosure? 

An  order  of nondisclosure  is  a  court  order  prohibiting  public  entities, including 
courts, clerks of the court, law enforcement agencies, and prosecutorial offices, 
from disclosing certain criminal records.  If you have a criminal record, you may 
benefit from obtaining an order of nondisclosure. 

An order of  nondisclosure legally frees  you from  h a v i n g   t o   disclose certain 
information  about  your  criminal  history  in  response  to  questions  on  job 
applications. You are not required to disclose information related to an offense 
that is the subject of an order of nondisclosure. 

Please  note  that  an  order  of  nondisclosure  applies  to  a  particular  criminal 
offense.  The  order  does  not  apply  to  all  offenses  that  may  be  on  your 
criminal  history  record,  but  you  may  obtain  multiple  orders  for  multiple 
offenses. 

As  mentioned  above,  an  order  of  nondisclosure  prohibits  entities  holding 
information  about  a  certain  offense  on  your  criminal  history  record  from 
disclosing that information. This  is  a  general  rule. There  are  exceptions. Law 
enforcement  and  certain  state  agencies  will  be  able  to  obtain  the  information, 
even if the court grants an order. For a list of such agencies, see Government 
Code Section 411.0765. 

hat are the Different Types of Order of Nondisclosure? 

The  following  laws  address  the  types  of  nondisclosure  petitions  and  orders

Supervision; Certain Nonviolent Misdemeanors); 

•  Section  411.0725,  Gov’t  Code  (Deferred  Adjudication  Community

While Intoxicated Convictions)  
 

Each of the sections listed above has specific requirements and procedures that 
you must satisfy in order to obtain an order of nondisclosure. The requirements

2)  a signed order or document showing that the judge granted you an early 
termination or reduced your period of community supervision or confinement; 
3)  a  signed  order  or  document  showing  that  you  completed  community 
supervision,  including  any  term  of  confinement  and  payment  of  all  fines, 
costs, and restitution imposed; 

4)  a discharge order (an order or document showing that you were discharged 

from community supervision);

FIRST  satisfy  several  basic  requirements  before  the  court  can  issue  an  order, 
unless you are requesting an order under Government Code Section 411.0729 or 
411.0728.  The  basic  requirements  for  an  order  are  listed  in  Government  Code 
Section 411.074.

previously  convicted  of  or  placed  on  deferred  adjudication  community

finding that your offense involved family violence. 

.  You are ineligible for an order of nondisclosure: (1) if you were convicted of 
or placed on deferred adjudication community supervision for another offense, 
excluding traffic offenses punishable by fine only, after the court convicted or 
placed you on deferred adjudication community supervision for the offense for 
which  the  order  is  sought;  or  (2)  if  you  were  convicted  of  or  placed  on 
deferred  adjudication  community  supervision  for  another  offense,  excluding 
traffic offenses punishable by fine only, during the time you were required to 
wait  before  filing  your  petition  for  an  order  of  nondisclosure  (see the 
explanation provided in the note below).

Note:  There are waiting periods for some orders of nondisclosure, 
and  if  you  are  convicted  of  or  placed  on  deferred  adjudication 
community supervision for another offense during the waiting period, 
excluding traffic offenses punishable by fine only, you are ineligible 
for an order of nondisclosure.  

 
Determining Your Eligibility for an Order of Nondisclosure 

In order to make it easier for you to identify which type of order of nondisclosure, 
if any, is correct for you, this overview will lead you through a series of questions.

order of nondisclosure and should proceed no further, or are eligible for an order 
of nondisclosure and should proceed to a particular section below under Types 
of Nondisclosure for additional information and instructions. Each type of order 
has additional requirements that you must satisfy to remain eligible for an order 
under the section. These requirements are in addition to the basic requirements 
under Section 411.074, if any of those requirements apply to you.   

he  following  five  questions  will  assist  you  in  determining  which  nondisclosure 

section, if any, applies to your offense.
