including  attorney  fees, if  any.  Debt  claim  cases  in  justice  court  are  governed  by  Rules

landlord’s duty to repair or remedy a condition materially affecting the physical health or 
safety of an ordinary tenant. The relief sought can be for no more than $10,000$20,000,

remedy  cases  are  governed  by  Rules  500-507  and  509  of  Part  V  of  the  Rules  of  Civil

’

’

(b)    Form and Content.  

’

  R

(a)

’

s rent plus $500;  

(D)    award the tenant

s actual damages; and  

’

’

’

’

remedy the condition and the date when the repair or remedy must be completed.  

(4)

Misc. Docket No. 20-9070 

Page 6 

(C)   

the condition justifying the reduction of rent;  

(D)

(E)   

that  the  order  reducing  rent  will  terminate  on  the  date  the  condition  is

give the tenant written notice, served in accordance with Rule 501.4, that 
the  condition  justifying  the  reduction  of  rent  has  been  repaired  or 
remedied and the rent will revert to the rent amount specified in the lease.  

(c)   

(d)  

 

Issuance and Service. The judge must issue the judgment. The judgment may be served 
on the landlord in open court or by any means provided in Rule 501.4 at an address listed 
in  the  citation,  the  address  listed  on  any  answer,  or  such  other  address  the  landlord 
furnishes to the court in writing. Unless the judge serves the landlord in open court or by 
other  means  provided  in  Rule  501.4,  the  sheriff,  constable,  or  other  authorized  person 
who serves the landlord must promptly file a return of service in the justice court.  

Failure  to  Comply.  If  the  landlord  fails  to  comply  with  an  order  to  repair  or  remedy  a 
condition  or  reduce  the  tenant
s  rent,  the  failure  is  grounds  for  citing  the  landlord  for 
contempt of court under Section 21.002 of the Texas Government Code.
