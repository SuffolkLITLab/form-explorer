clerk to obtain the total amount due upon filing the petition, unless you are submitting 
a Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs. Next, be sure to complete 
the correct petition according to the instructions, and after you have done so, print both 
the petition and the proposed Order of Nondisclosure. In most courts, you will have to 
submit a proposed order with your petition. The judge will complete the order, if the 
judge grants your request.  

ou must file the petition in the court that convicted you or placed you on deferred 
adjudication, unless you are filing in a district court to consolidate multiple petitions.   

fter you file the petition, the clerk will send it to the court, and the court will notify the 

prosecutor.   

 hearing is required if the prosecutor requests one.    

f a hearing is scheduled, the court will notify you. If there is a hearing, the court may ask 
questions regarding your eligibility to receive the order. After the hearing, if the court 
finds  that  you  have  satisfied  the  requirements  of  the  statutes  (Government  Code 
Sections 411.0728 and 411.074(b)) and issuance of the order is in the best interest of 
justice, the court will grant your request for the order. 

f the court does not hold a hearing, the court will review your petition to determine 
whether an order of nondisclosure shall issue. The court must find that you satisfy the 
requirements of Sections 411.0728 and 411.074(b), and that issuance of the order is in 
the best interest of justice before the court may grant your request.   

he court will have access to your criminal history record information and will use it to 
determine your eligibility for the order.    

f the court grants the order, the clerk will send a copy of the order to DPS no later than 
15  business  days  after  the  order  issues.  Upon  receiving  the  order,  DPS  will  have  10 
business days to seal, not delete, the criminal history record information that is subject 
to the order and forward a copy of the order to the state and federal agencies listed in 
Government  Code  Section  411.075(b).  It  is  important  to  note  that  some  agencies, 
including law enforcement agencies, will still have access to the information, although 
the  information  is  sealed.  You  will  find  a  list  of  such  agencies  at  Government  Code 
Section 411.0765.
