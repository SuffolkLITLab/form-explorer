A person must not perform work requiring certification, registration, or a 
license under the Act with an expired certification, registration, or license.  

The Commission will notify a regulated person by email before the date that 
the person’s certification, registration, or license is scheduled to expire. A 
regulated person’s failure to receive a renewal notice from the Commission 
does not exempt the person from any requirement of these rules or of any 
other rules governing the person’s profession.  

All  certification,  registration,  and  license  renewal  applications  must  be 
submitted on forms published on the Commission’s website. A regulated 
person must comply with submission  requirements  stated on the renewal 
form. Incomplete applications will not be processed.  

The renewal application and all applicable fees are due 45 days prior to the 
expiration  of  the  certification,  registration,  or  license.  An  application  is 
timely if it is postmarked on or before the due date. Failure to complete a 
renewal application at least 45 days prior to expiration may result in a lapse 
of certification, registration, or license.   

Any  continuing  education  that  is  required  to  be  fulfilled  as  part  of  the 
renewal  application  must  be  completed  prior  to  the  certification, 
registration, or license expiration date to avoid payment of a late renewal 
fee. 

Notwithstanding (b) through (e), a regulated person who fails to renew his 
or her certification, registration, or license in a timely manner because the 
person was on active duty in the United States armed forces serving outside 
this State is exempt from any increased renewal fee that the person would 
otherwise be required to pay for failing to renew in a timely manner. 

Notwithstanding (b) through (e): 

A regulated person who is a member of the state military forces or a 
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States, and who 
is  ordered to  active duty by  the proper authority, is  entitled to  an 
extension of his or her certification, registration, or license period 
equal to the deployment period and an additional amount of time to 
complete  any  continuing  education  requirements  and  any  other 
requirements  related  to  the  renewal  of  the  person’s  certification, 
registration, or license.

Renewal Applications  

 

 

 

 

The  individual  must  submit  to  the  Director  a  written  request, 
accompanied by a copy of the orders placing the person on active 
duty. 

The Director must make the extension based on information in the 
copy of the orders provided. The additional amount of time must be 
equal to the total number of months that the person serves on active 
duty.   

An  individual  making  a  request  under  this  rule  must  notify  the 
Director of any change in the length of deployment. 

A regulated person is exempt from any increased fee or other penalty 
for failing to renew the person’s certification, registration, or license 
in  a  timely  manner  if  the  individual  furnishes  to  the  Commission 
satisfactory documentation that the individual failed to renew in a 
timely  manner  because  the  individual  was  on  active  duty  in  the 
United States armed forces serving outside this State.

The Commission must refuse to accept a regulated person’s application for 
renewal  if  the  Commission  receives  notice  of  child  support  arrearages 
pursuant to Section 232.0135 of the Family Code. Upon receipt of further 
notice  that  the  person  has  complied  with  Section  232.0135(b),  the 
Commission  must  accept  an  application  for  renewal  subject  to  all 
requirements of these rules.  

The Commission may waive any prerequisite to obtaining a certification, 
registration,  or  license  for  an  applicant  after  reviewing  the  applicant’s 
credentials  and  determining  that  the  applicant  holds  a  certification, 
registration, or license issued by another jurisdiction that has certification, 
registration, or licensing requirements substantially equivalent to those of 
this State. 

The Commission may waive any prerequisite to obtaining a certification, 
registration,  or  license  for  an  applicant  who  holds  a  certification, 
registration, or license issued by another jurisdiction with which this State 
has a reciprocity agreement. Subject to the approval of the Supreme Court, 
the  Commission  may  make  an  agreement  with  another  state  to  allow  for 
certification, registration, or licensing by reciprocity.

The  Commission  may  issue  a  certification,  registration,  or  license  to  an 
applicant described under (a) who: 

holds  a  current  certification,  registration,  or  license  issued  by 
another state that has requirements that are substantially equivalent 
to the requirements for the certification, registration, or license; or 

within  the  five  years  preceding  the  application  date,  held  a 
certification, registration, or license in this State that expired while 
the applicant lived in another state for at least six months. 

The Commission may allow an applicant who meets the requirements of (b) 
to demonstrate competency by alternative methods or credentials in order 
to meet the requirements for obtaining a particular certification, registration, 
or  license  issued  by  the  Commission.  For  purposes  of  this  Section,  the 
standard  methods  of  demonstrating  competency  are  the  specific  exam, 
education,  and  experience  required  to  obtain  a  particular  certification, 
registration, or license. 

In  lieu  of  the  standard  methods  of  demonstrating  competency  for  a 
particular certification, registration, or license and based on the applicant’s 
circumstances, the alternative methods for demonstrating competency may 
include  any  combination  of  the  following  as  determined  by  the 
Commission: 

b) 

  (

(c) 

d) 

  (

education; 

continuing education; 

examinations (written or skills); 

letters of good standing; 

letters of recommendation; 

work experience; or 

other methods or credentials required by the Commission. 

(e) 

The applicant must: 

submit an application and proof of the requirements under this rule 
and for that particular certification, registration, or license on a form 
and in a manner prescribed by the Commission; and

be subject to the same criminal history background check required 
of the persons applying for that particular certification, registration, 
or license. 

A person who applies for a certification, registration, or license under this 
rule is exempt from paying an application fee. 

The  Director  may  issue  a  license  by  endorsement  under  this  rule  to  an 
applicant who meets the requirements of (b) in the same manner set forth in 
Section 51.404 of the Occupations Code. 

3.5 

Eligibility for Persons with Criminal History 

(f) 

g) 

  (

(a) 

An initial or renewal application may be denied, and a regulated person may 
be disciplined, if the person’s criminal history or other information indicates 
that the person lacks the honesty, trustworthiness, or integrity to hold the 
certification, registration, or license. After consultation with the appropriate 
advisory boards, the Commission will develop and publish on its website 
guidelines for each regulatory program listing the categories of crimes that 
are considered to indicate that a person lacks the honesty, trustworthiness, 
or integrity to hold the particular certification, registration, or license. The 
Director  will  determine  whether  an  initial  or  renewal  application  will  be 
denied under this rule using the guidelines developed by the Commission 
and  the  factors  listed  in  (b).  If  the  Director  denies  an  application,  the 
applicant may request that the Commission reconsider the decision under 
Rule 3.6.   

the  extent  to  which  certification,  registration,  or  licensing  might 
offer  an  opportunity  to  engage  in  further  criminal  activity  of  the 
same type as that in which the person previously had been involved;  

the  relationship  of  the  crime  to  the  ability,  capacity,  or  fitness 
required to perform the duties and discharge the responsibilities of 
the occupation;  

the extent and nature of the person’s past criminal activity;  

the age of the person when the crime was committed;  

the amount of time that has elapsed since the person’s last criminal 
activity;

any other evidence of the person’s fitness, including, but not limited 
to, letters of recommendation. 

A person may request that the Commission, through the Director, issue a 
criminal  history  evaluation  letter  regarding  the  person’s  eligibility  for 
certification or licensure under this rule. 

(1) 

The  person  may  request  a  criminal  history  evaluation  letter  if  the 
person: 

(c) 

 

is enrolled or is planning to enroll in an educational program 
that prepares a person for an initial certification or license or 
is  planning  to  take  an  examination  required  by  the 
Commission for an initial certification or license; and 

has  reason  to  believe  that  the  person  is  ineligible  for 
certification  or  licensing  due  to  a  conviction  or  deferred 
adjudication  for  a  felony  or  misdemeanor  offense  or  other 
criminal history. 

(A) 

B) 

  (

(2) 

The  request  must  be  in  writing  and  must  state  the  basis  for  the 
person’s  potential  ineligibility.  The  requestor  must  provide  the 
Commission  with  his  or  her  criminal  records  pursuant  to  the 
fingerprinting  requirements  for  the  particular  certification  or 
licensing  program.  The  Commission  may  request  additional 
information from the requestor.

If  the  Director  determines  that  a  ground  for  ineligibility  does  not 
exist,  the  Director  must  notify  the  requestor  in  writing  of  the 
Director’s determination on each ground of potential ineligibility. 

If  the  Director  determines  that  the  requestor  is  ineligible,  the 
Director  must  issue  a  letter  setting  out  each  basis  for  potential 
ineligibility and the Director’s determination as to eligibility. 

The Director must provide notice under (c)(3) or issue a letter under 
(c)(4) not later than the 90th day after the date that the Commission 
receives the request.

Application  Review.  The  Director  must  review  each  application  and 
determine whether the applicant meets the Commission’s qualifications for 
the particular certification, registration, or license. The Director must also 
determine whether the applicant meets the Commission’s criminal history 
eligibility  requirements.  If  a  person  who  has  applied  to  be  a  certified 
guardian does not clearly meet the experience or education requirements in 
these rules, the Director must consult  with members of the Guardianship 
Certification Advisory Board before approving or denying the application. 

Denial of Application.  The Director may deny an application only if the 
applicant  fails  to  meet  the  qualifications  set  forth  in  these  rules  or  the 
Commission’s criminal history eligibility requirements. The Director must 
furnish to the applicant a written statement that succinctly states the reason 
for denying the application. 

Request for Reconsideration. Within 20 days of the date of the notice that 
the Director has denied an application, the applicant may request that the 
Commission reconsider the denial. The request must be in writing, identify 
each point or matter about which reconsideration is requested, and set forth 
the grounds for the request for reconsideration. 

Reconsideration Procedure. The Commission must reconsider the request 
at its next meeting and may allow the applicant or other witnesses to appear 
at the meeting and present sworn testimony. The Commission may limit the

Except  as  provided  in  Rule  3.10,  when  an  applicant  must  take  an 
examination in order to obtain a certification or license, the applicant may 
only  use  methods  of  assistance  that  are  available  to,  and  authorized  for, 
other  persons  taking  the  examination.  A  person  who  uses  or  provides 
unauthorized  assistance  in  connection  with  an  examination  violates  this 
rule.  Conduct  that  violates  this  rule  includes  but  is  not  limited  to  the 
following:

The  contents  of  any  examination  that  is  required  for  the  issuance  of  a 
Commission certification or license are confidential. 

An applicant who cheats on an examination will be disqualified and may 
not take the examination again until two years have elapsed from the date 
of the examination at which the applicant was disqualified. 

A  person  may  reschedule  an  examination  to  another  regularly  scheduled 
examination  date  at  no  charge  if  the  person  notifies  the  Commission  or 
vendor  at  least  two  days  prior  to  the  examination  and  complies  with  the 
instructions of the Commission or vendor. 

A person who  reschedules an examination under this rule may  apply the 
examination  fee  paid  for  the  cancelled  examination  to  the  rescheduled 
examination. 

if  the  examination  is  administered  by  a  vendor,  comply  with  the 
vendor’s notice and documentation requirements; or

Reasonable  accommodation  for  examinations  will  be  made  available  as 
required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Public Law 101-
336. Reasonable accommodation means an adjustment or modification of 
the standard testing conditions that ameliorates the impact of the applicant’s 
disability without doing any of the following: 

(1) 

fundamentally altering the nature of the examination; 

fundamentally  altering  the  Commission’s  ability  to  determine 
through  the  examination  whether  the  applicant  possesses  the 
essential eligibility requirements; 

compromising the validity of the examination; 

compromising the security of the examination; or 

imposing  an  undue  burden  on  the  Commission  or  on  the 
examination vendor. 

If an examination is scheduled on a date that is a religious holy day, a person 
whose religious beliefs prevent that person from taking an examination on 
such date will be permitted to take the examination on an alternate date. The 
alternate  date  must  be  a  regularly  scheduled  examination  date  unless  the 
person’s religious beliefs prevent the person from taking the examination 
on such date. 

A  person  who  needs  a  reasonable  accommodation  for  an  examination  or 
who requests to take the examination on an alternate date must notify the 
Director or examination vendor, as applicable, of the request at least 10 days 
prior to the scheduled examination.

3.12  Responsibilities of Regulated Persons 

A regulated person must comply with the rules for the program under which 
the person is regulated. 

A  regulated  person  must  respond  to  requests  for  information  from  the 
Commission  or  the  Director  pertaining  to  renewal  of  certification, 
registration, or licensure; complaints alleging misconduct by the regulated

regulated person must respond to a request for information within the time 
prescribed in the request. 

A regulated person must provide the Commission with the person’s name, 
business  name,  business  address,  home  address,  business  and  home 
telephone  numbers,  email  address,  and  fax  number,  and  must  notify  the 
Commission  of  any  change  in  contact  information  within  30  days  of  the 
change. Failure to comply with this rule may result in disciplinary action. 

A  regulated  person  who,  after  being  certified,  registered,  or  licensed,  is 
convicted of any felony or misdemeanor offense must immediately notify 
the Commission of the conviction. 

3.13  Voluntary Surrender of Certification, Registration, or License

website. 

The  person  must  provide  written  notice  of  the  voluntary  surrender  as 
required by the Director. 

The circumstances under which the certification, registration, or license is 
surrendered will be noted in the person’s records with the Commission and

3) 

The Director may approve or deny a request for approval of a continuing 
education course. Upon approval, the Director will determine the number 
of hours of continuing education for the course. 

The  Commission  will  publish  on  its  website  a  list  of  courses  that  are 
approved as continuing education. 

A  continuing  education  provider  whose  course  has  been  approved  must 
retain participant course completion records for a period of three years after 
completion  of  the  course.  Upon  request,  a  provider  must  provide 
information,  including  attendance  records,  to  the  Commission  within  10 
days of the request. 

A  regulated  person  must  obtain  a  certificate  of  attendance  or  other 
documentation  from  a  continuing  education  course  provider  to  prove  the 
person’s attendance or completion of all continuing education activity from 
the  provider  and  submit  the  documentation  to  the  Commission  with  the 
person’s  renewal  application.  The  person  must  retain  a  copy  of  the 
documentation for a period of three years after completion of the course.

The Commission, through the Director, may request additional information 
from a regulated person to verify the person’s compliance with continuing 
education requirements. 

If  a  regulated  person’s  certification  or  license  expires  and  the  person  is 
permitted under these rules to renew late, the person must comply with the 
continuing  education  requirements  for  the  person’s  profession.  The 
continuing  education  credit  must  be  earned  during  the  certification  or 
license period preceding expiration, or within the appropriate late renewal 
period. Continuing education credit earned during the late renewal period 
may  not  be  used  to  satisfy  the  continuing  education  for  the  person’s 
subsequent renewal period.  

The following do not qualify as continuing education activities under these 
rules:  

attendance  at,  or  participation  in,  professional  or  association 
business meetings, general sessions, or policy making sessions;  

service on a committee or council or as an officer in a professional

respondent is a provisionally certified guardian, the Commission must also 
send a copy of the complaint and attachments to the guardian’s supervisor. 
The respondent may request an extension of time to file an answer, but the 
request must be made before the expiration of the 20-day period.  

The Commission must refer a properly executed complaint and the results 
of any investigation conducted by the Commission to a review committee 
established  by  the  Commission  and  comprised  of  members  of  the 
appropriate advisory board.

(d) 

The review committee must hold at least one meeting to review the 
complaint and answer, make the initial determination on whether a 
violation occurred, and recommend the imposition of a penalty, a 
sanction, or both. 

The review committee may hold additional meetings to consider a 
complaint or seek additional information, but it has no obligation to 
do so. The review committee is not an investigatory body and will 
generally render its recommendation to the Commission based on 
the  submissions  of  the  complainant  and  the  respondent  and  the 
information gathered by an Office investigation.

Commission’s determination on whether a violation occurred and of each 
recommended  penalty  or  sanction,  if  any.  The  notice  will  be  sent  to  the 
respondent’s last known address in the Commission’s records. 

(f)   

The notice required under (e) must: 

include a brief summary of the alleged violation; 

state the amount of any recommended penalty;

inform the respondent of the respondent’s right to a hearing on the 
occurrence  of  the  violation,  the  amount  of  the  penalty,  or  the 
imposition of the sanction.

The Director may dismiss complaints that clearly do not allege misconduct 
or  that  are  not  within  the  Commission’s  jurisdiction.  The  Director  must 
inform  the  Commission  of  all  dismissals  made  under  this  rule.  A  person 
who files a complaint that is dismissed under this rule may request in writing 
that the Commission reconsider the complaint.

If the respondent requests a hearing, the Commission must give the parties 
written notice of the hearing that includes the time, place, legal authority, 
and  jurisdiction  under  which  the  hearing  is  held  and  the  laws  and  rules 
related to the violation.   

The presiding officer of the Commission may hold prehearing conferences. 

The  respondent  may  appear,  testify,  present  evidence,  and  respond  to 
questions from the Commission at the hearing. The complainant may appear 
and may testify at the discretion of the prosecutor and the presiding officer. 

A  party  may  appear  by  telephone  or  videoconference  or  present  the 
testimony of a  witness by  telephone or videoconference  according to  the 
procedures below. 

A  party  may  request  to  appear  by  telephone  or  to  present  the 
testimony of a witness by telephone, upon timely motion stating the 
reason for the request, containing the pertinent telephone number, 
and affirmatively stating that the proposed witness will be the same 
person  who  appears  telephonically  at  the  hearing.  A  party  may 
request to appear by videoconference or to present the testimony of 
a witness by videoconference, upon timely motion stating the reason 
for  the  request  and  the  city  in  which  the  party  or  witness  will  be 
located at the time of the proceeding. A timely motion for telephone 
or videoconference appearance will not be deemed granted unless 
granted by written order of the presiding officer.   

The motion is timely if it is filed no later than 10 days before the 
hearing.  The  presiding  officer  may  grant  an  exception  to  this 
requirement if it clearly appears from specific facts shown in writing 
that compliance with the deadline was not reasonably possible and 
that failure to meet the deadline was not the result of the negligence 
of the party.  

All  substantive  and  procedural  rights  apply  to  telephone  and 
videoconference proceedings, subject only to the limitations of the 
physical arrangement.

At the request of the Commission, at least one member of the applicable 
advisory board review committee may attend the hearing to consult with the 
Commission  on  the  reasons  for  the  advisory  board  review  committee’s 
recommendations under Rule 5.8(d).  

At the hearing, the Commission must apply the general rules of evidence 
applicable in a district court, except that the Commission may admit and 
consider  any  information  that  the  Commission  determines  is  relevant, 
trustworthy, and necessary for a full and fair adjudication and determination 
of fact or law. The Commission may establish rules for the conduct of the 
hearing. 

The Commission will deliberate and announce its decision at the conclusion 
of the hearing. The Commission must make findings of fact and conclusions 
of law and must promptly issue an order on the occurrence of the violation, 
the amount of any penalty imposed, and the imposition of any sanction. The 
Commission must serve the respondent and the complainant with a copy of 
the order by certified mail with return receipt requested or by certified mail 
with electronic return receipt. 

The notice of the Commission’s order under (g) must include a statement of 
the right of the respondent to appeal the order under Section 153.058 of the 
Government Code. 

The complainant and respondent are each responsible for their own costs of 
preparing for and attending the hearing.

file an appeal of the Commission’s order contesting the occurrence of the 
violation, the imposition or amount of the penalty, or the imposition of the 
sanction. 

upon proof that notice of the hearing was given to the respondent, 
the Commission may proceed in the respondent’s absence; and 

the factual allegations in the complaint may be deemed admitted.

(k) 

Proof that a document was sent to a party’s last known address, as shown 
by  the  Commission’s  records,  creates  a  rebuttable  presumption  that  the 
document was received. The addressee’s  failure to claim a document that 
was properly addressed and served is insufficient to rebut the presumption. 

5.11  Options Following Decision: Pay, Accept, or Appeal 
 

Not  later  than  the  30th  day  after  the  date  that  the  Commission  issues  an  order 
imposing an administrative penalty or sanction, the respondent must: 

5.12  Collection of Penalty 

If  the  respondent  does  not  pay  the  penalty  and  the  enforcement  of  the 
penalty is not stayed, the Attorney General may sue to collect the penalty 
and may recover reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred in 
recovering the penalty. 

b)   A penalty collected under these rules will be deposited in the state treasury 

in the general revenue fund. 

5.13  Appeal 

(a)   A person seeking to appeal an order that imposes a penalty or sanction must 
submit a written appeal of the order to the General Counsel of the Office 
within 30 days after the Commission’s order is issued. The General Counsel 
must promptly forward the appeal to a special committee consisting of three 
Administrative Regional Presiding Judges. 

The committee will be chosen by the Presiding Judges, but the committee 
must not include the Presiding Judge for the administrative region in which 
the  appellant  resided  at  the  time  of  the  decision.  If  the  alleged  violation 
involves a certified guardian, the committee must consist of two Regional 
Presiding Judges and the Presiding Judge of the statutory probate courts.

The General Counsel must notify the Commission of the filing of an appeal 
and,  upon  request,  must  make  the  appeal  materials  available  to  the 
Commission or its legal representative. 

The appeal must contain: 

a  copy  of  the  notice  of  the  Commission’s  order  with  which  the 
appellant is dissatisfied; and 

a statement succinctly explaining why the appellant is dissatisfied 
with the Commission’s decision. 

(1) 

2) 

  (

The Office must adopt rules or policies to ensure that any Office employee 
who  provides  clerical,  administrative,  or  other  direct  support  to  the 
Commission does not communicate regarding the substance of any appeal 
under this rule with any other Office employee who facilitates the appeal 
process under this rule. The rules or policies must also provide that Office 
employees may communicate regarding nonsubstantive aspects of appeals, 
such as to ensure the completeness and accuracy of appeal materials to be 
forwarded to the special committee. 

Upon  receiving  notice  of  an  appeal  of  a  disciplinary  action  imposing  a 
penalty or sanction, the Commission must provide to the General Counsel, 
and the General Counsel must submit to the special committee, electronic 
or paper copies of the complaint and any original attachments, any written 
answer  timely  submitted  by  the  appellant,  notice  of  the  Commission’s 
decision imposing a penalty or sanction, and any other documents or written 
evidence  considered  by  the  Commission  pertaining  to  the  decision 
complained of on appeal. The Commission must provide a copy of  these 
items to an appellant upon request, and may charge costs for such copies as 
set forth in Rule 12.7 of the Rules of Judicial Administration. 

Absent  approval  by the  special committee, submission  of materials  other 
than those described in (f) is prohibited. The special committee may, in its 
sole  discretion,  allow  an  appellant  to  submit  additional  written  materials 
relating to the appeal. Otherwise, only the written materials described in (f) 
will be considered. A request  to  submit additional  materials  must clearly 
identify the additional materials for which inclusion is requested. 

The  special  committee  must  consider  the  appeal  under  an  abuse  of 
discretion standard of review for all issues except issues involving questions 
of law. The standard of review for issues involving questions of law is de 
novo. Under either standard, the burden is on the appellant to establish that 
the Commission’s decision was erroneous.

The special committee may consider the appeal without a hearing and may 
conduct its deliberations by any appropriate means. The special committee 
may, in its sole discretion, conduct a hearing and allow testimony from the 
appellant  or  any  other  person  with  knowledge  of  the  underlying  facts 
relating to the disciplinary action complained of. 

The  special  committee  may  confer  in  writing  with  a  certification, 
registration, or license holder who is in the same profession as the appellant 
if the special committee provides to the appellant: 

notice of the special committee’s request for information; and 

a copy of the certification, registration, or license holder’s response. 

(k) 

If the special committee sustains the finding that a violation occurred, the 
special committee may: 

uphold or reduce the amount of any penalty and order the appellant 
to pay the full or reduced amount of the penalty; and 

uphold  or  reduce  any  sanction  and  order  the  imposition  of  the 
sanction. 

If  the  special  committee  does  not  sustain  the  finding  that  a  violation 
occurred, the special committee must order that a penalty is not owed and 
that a sanction may not be imposed. 

If the appellant paid the penalty and if the amount of the penalty is reduced 
or the penalty is not upheld by the special committee, the special committee 
must order that the appropriate amount plus accrued interest be remitted to 
the appellant not later than the 30th day after the date the judgment of the 
special committee becomes final. The interest accrues at the rate charged on 
loans to depository institutions by the New York Federal Reserve Bank. The 
interest must be paid for the period beginning on the date the penalty is paid 
and ending on the date the penalty is remitted. 

The special committee must notify the Commission and appellant in writing 
of its decision. No rehearing or further appeal is allowed.

5.14  Disposition by Agreement  

Any disciplinary matter may be disposed of by agreement, unless precluded 
by  law.  The  agreement  must  be  in  writing  and  may  be  in  the  form  of  a 
stipulation, a settlement agreement, or a consent order.

The agreement must: 

include proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law; and 

be signed by all parties to the agreement and their representatives.

Upon receipt of the agreement, the Commission or the Director may: 

(1) 

adopt the agreement and issue a final order; 

reject  the  agreement  and  remand  the  disciplinary  matter  for  a 
hearing before the Commission;

5.15  Alternative Dispute Resolution 

In addition to the procedures under Rule 5.14, the Commission encourages 
the  resolution  and  early  settlement  of  all  contested  disciplinary  matters 
through voluntary settlement procedures.   

At any time after the filing of a complaint against a regulated person, the 
Director may initiate a settlement conference on the Director’s own motion 
or at the request of any party. Settlement conferences are voluntary. 

The  complainant  and  the  respondent  are  the  parties  in  a  settlement 
conference. The Commission (through one or more Commission members, 
Office  staff,  or  counsel)  may  also  participate  as  a  party  in  a  settlement 
conference at the sole option of the presiding officer. 

A  settlement  conference  may  be  used  to  reach  agreement  about  all  or  a 
portion of the ultimate issues in a disciplinary matter or to reach agreement 
about how to handle disputed matters. The parties may use a mediator for a 
settlement  conference  or  conduct  the  settlement  conference  without  a 
mediator. 

The complainant and the respondent may not bind the Commission to any 
resolution  of  a  disciplinary  matter  pending  before  the  Commission.  The 
presiding officer may appoint one or more Commission members or staff to 
attend  the  settlement  conference.  The  Commission  representative  must

  (

e) 

  (

 

 

 

 

 

 

participate in the proceedings in an effort to resolve the dispute within the 
parameters of any instructions received from the Commission. 

In the event  a settlement of some or all of the disputed issues is  reached 
during the settlement conference, the Commission must review the terms of 
the  settlement  at  the  next  regularly  scheduled  Commission  meeting.  The 
Commission may accept the settlement terms, reject the settlement terms 
and restore all proceedings on the disciplinary matter to the status quo as it 
existed immediately prior to the settlement conference, or refer the matter 
for further negotiation. 

The  parties  may  agree  to  retain  a  mediator  to  assist  with  the  settlement 
conference.   

The  parties  must  notify  the  presiding  officer  in  writing  of  their 
agreement to retain a mediator. That notice must include the name, 
address, and telephone number of the mediator selected; a statement 
that the parties have entered into an agreement with the mediator as 
to rate and method of his or her compensation; and an affirmation 
that the mediator is qualified to serve. 

Upon  receipt  of  a  properly  filed  notice  under  (1),  the  presiding 
officer will enter an order referring the case to the mediator. 

(1) 

2) 

  (

If the parties do not agree to a mediator, the presiding officer may appoint 
an individual to serve as mediator in the settlement conference.   

An individual appointed to serve as a mediator under (g) or (h) must meet 
the qualifications set forth in the Civil Practice and Remedies Code Section 
154.052. Pursuant to Section 154.052(c) of the Code, an individual who has 
served as a judge in Texas may be appointed to serve as a mediator. 

The Commission will not pay any fees or costs associated with a settlement 
conference  unless  good  cause  is  shown  and  the  Commission  and  Office 
agree to do so prior to the settlement conference. 

All  communications  in  the  settlement  conference  between  or  among  the 
parties, and between each party and mediator, if any, are confidential under 
the  same  terms  as  provided  in  Section  154.053  of  the  Civil  Practice  and 
Remedies Code. Information shared with the mediator in separate meetings 
will not be given to any other party unless the party sharing the information 
explicitly gives the mediator permission to do so. Material provided to the 
mediator is not required to be provided to the other parties and will not be 
filed or become a record in the disciplinary proceedings. Notes taken during 
the settlement conference by the parties and the mediator must be destroyed 
at the end of the process.

Any agreement reached by the parties will be reduced to writing and signed 
by the parties before the end of the settlement conference. These writings 
may be informal in nature. The parties may agree that the written agreement 
remain confidential if there is no requirement of law to the contrary. Any 
part  of  the  agreement  that  may  affect  the  disposition  of  the  disciplinary 
proceeding (such as agreements concerning relevant facts) must be filed in 
the record of the disciplinary proceeding.   

If the parties use a mediator for the settlement conference, the mediator must 
maintain  confidentiality  in  accordance  with  Section  2009.054  of  the 
Government Code. The mediator may not communicate to the Commission 
matters  discussed  with  the  parties  in  the  settlement  conference.  The 
mediator will report to the Commission in writing whether the settlement 
conference  resulted  in  a  settlement  of  the  matter  in  dispute,  or  other 
stipulations or matters that the parties agreed be reported.  

Required  Filings.  The  following  documents  must  be  filed  with  the 
Commission: any request for the appointment of a mediator, any objection 
to the referral of the matter to a settlement conference, any objection to the 
appointment of a mediator, any notice required to be given, any settlement 
agreement, any report prepared by the mediator, and any similar documents 
as  may  become  necessary  or  appropriate  in  the  course  of  the  settlement 
conference.

proficiency and must be taken by the method of shorthand 
reporting  for  which 
the  applicant  has  applied  for 
examination. The two tests must have been taken and passed 
no more than one year apart.  

The  applicant  may  not  be  deemed  eligible  to  take  an 
examination until the Commission receives the statement of 
proficiency. 

If  the  Commission  has  on  file  a  valid  statement  of 
proficiency for an applicant, the applicant is not required to 
file  a  new  statement  of  proficiency.  A  statement  of 
proficiency  is  valid  for  one  year  from  the  date  of  the  last 
proficiency  test  described  in  (C)  and  must  be  valid  on  the 
date of the examination for which the applicant has applied. 

In lieu of the statement of proficiency, an applicant who is

Notwithstanding  Rule  3.11(d),  an  applicant  who  passes  Part  A  or 
Part B of the examination but fails the other part will not be required 
to be reexamined on the part that the applicant passed. 

An applicant who fails an examination may request that the examination be 
regraded by sending a written request to the Commission office within 20 
days of the date of notice that the applicant has failed the examination. If 
the examination is regraded, the Commission will inform the applicant of 
the  results  of  the  regrading.  Upon  receipt  of  the  regrading  results,  the 
applicant may request a personal review of the examination with a member 
of the advisory board. The request for a personal review must be in writing 
and filed within twenty days of the notice of regrading results. 

The Commission must certify to the Supreme Court of Texas the names of 
applicants  who  have  completed  all  application  requirements  and  are 
determined  on  examination  to  be  qualified  in  professional  shorthand 
reporting. In its certification, the Commission must specify the method or 
methods  of  reporting  used  by  each  successful  applicant  in  taking  the 
examination.  

A  person  certified  under  Chapter  52  of  the  Government  Code  prior  to 
September 1, 1983, may retain a general certification authorizing the person 
to  use  any  method  of  shorthand  reporting  authorized  in  Rule  6.2(a)(1), 
provided that the person keeps the certification in continuous effect. 

To register, a court reporting firm or affiliate office must pay all required 
fees and register on a form provided by the Commission. The registration 
form must state whether any officers, directors, or managerial employees of 
the  firm  or  affiliate  office  have  been  finally  convicted  of  a  felony  or 
misdemeanor other than a minor traffic offense or juvenile offense.

Renewal of Certification or Registration 

(a) 

     
(b) 

Notwithstanding Rule 3.2(b), not later than the 30th day before the date a 
court  reporter’s  or  court  reporting  firm’s  certification  or  registration  is 
scheduled to expire, the Commission will notify the reporter or firm of the 
impending  expiration  at  the  reporter’s  or  firm’s  last  known  address 
according to the Commission’s records. Failure to receive the notice does 
not exempt a court reporter or a court reporting firm from any requirements 
of these rules. 

Nonrenewal due to student loan default. 

(1) 

The  Commission  must  not  renew  the  certification  of  a  certified 
shorthand  reporter  who  is  designated  to  be  in  default  on  loans 
guaranteed  by  the  Texas  Guaranteed  Student  Loan  Corporation 
(TGSLC) under Section 57.491(c) of the Education Code unless the 
reporter  presents  to  the  Board  a  certificate  issued  by  TGSLC 
certifying that: 

(A) 

the  reporter  has  entered  a  repayment  agreement  on  the 
defaulted loan; or  

B) 

the reporter is not in default on a loan guaranteed by TGSLC. 

The  Commission  must  not  renew  the  certification  of  a  certified 
shorthand reporter who is designated to be in default on a repayment 
agreement with TGSLC under Section 57.491(g) of the Education 
Code  unless  the  reporter  presents  to  the  Commission  a  certificate 
issued by TGSLC certifying that: 

the reporter has entered another repayment agreement on the 
defaulted loan; or 

the reporter is not in default on a loan guaranteed by TGSLC 
or on a repayment agreement.

opportunity for a hearing under the procedures set out in Rule 5.10 
prior  to  taking  action  concerning  nonrenewal  of  certification  for 
default on a student loan. 

(c) 

To  qualify  for  renewal  of  certification  or  registration,  a  certified  court 
reporter, court reporting firm, or affiliate office must pay all required fees, 
submit all required forms, and comply with renewal procedures. In addition, 
certified  court  reporters  must  comply  with  the  Commission’s  continuing 
education requirements in Rules 4.1-4.3 and 6.6. An application for renewal 
must state: 

if the applicant is a court reporter, whether the applicant has been 
finally  convicted  of  a  criminal  offense  other  than  a  minor  traffic 
offense since the reporter’s last certification;  

if the applicant is a court reporting firm or affiliate office, whether 
an  officer,  director,  or  managerial  employee  has  been  finally 
convicted  of  a  criminal  offense  other  than  a  minor  traffic  offense 
since the firm’s or affiliate office’s last registration; and 

if the applicant is  a court reporter, whether the  applicant has ever 
been the subject of a disciplinary action by a licensing authority in 
another jurisdiction requiring certification, registration, or licensure 
to provide court reporting services, and whether the applicant is the 
subject  of  a  pending  disciplinary  action  before  the  Commission, 
including actions in which the Commission imposed a sanction that 
has not been completed. 

A  person  who  is  otherwise  eligible  to  renew  a  certification  or 
registration may renew an unexpired certification or registration by 
paying the required renewal fee and submitting the required forms 
to  the  Commission  before  the  expiration  of  the  certification  or 
registration.  

A  person  whose  certification  or  registration  has  expired  may  not 
engage in activities that require a certification or registration until 
the certification or registration has been renewed. 

A person whose certification or registration has been expired for less 
than one year may renew the certification or registration by paying 
to the Commission the appropriate renewal fee.

Director. The request must include the reasons for seeking 
the waiver, the time period of the extension, and verification 
of 
continuing 
education  during  the  provisional  certification  period.  The 
provisionally certified guardian may include information in 
support of his or her request for a waiver, such as a letter of 
support  from  the  designated  guardian  supervisor.  If  the 
provisionally  certified  guardian  has  not  yet  passed  the 
required exam or completed required continuing education, 
the provisionally certified guardian must include in a request 
for a waiver the details of his or her plan for completion of 
these requirements and the amount of time necessary to do 
so.  

Page 56 

 

 

 

 

(B) 

The  Commission  will  consider  the  request  at  a  regularly 
scheduled  Commission  meeting.  The  request  must  be 
received by the Director not less than 30 days prior to the 
next scheduled meeting of the Commission. If a request for 
waiver  is  not  received  in  time  to  be  heard  at  a  regularly 
scheduled  meeting  before  the  provisional  certification 
expires, the request will not be considered.  

(2) 

Upon expiration of a provisionally certified guardian’s certification, 
the  guardian  must  immediately  provide  written  notice  of  the 
expiration to each court in which the guardian has been appointed 
pursuant  to  Section  1101.151  or  Section  1101.152  of  the  Estates 
Code and, if the guardian provides guardianship services on behalf 
of  the  Department  of  Aging  and  Disability  Services  or  a 
guardianship  program,  to  each  of  those  organizations  on  whose 
behalf the guardian provides guardianship services.  

If a provisionally certified guardian applies to be a certified guardian within 
one  year  of  obtaining  provisional  certification,  the  applicant  need  not 
submit a new criminal history record. 

A renewal application and all applicable fees are due 45 days prior to the 
expiration of the certification. An application is timely if it is postmarked 
on or before the due date. Failure to complete a renewal application at least 
45 days prior to expiration may result in a lapse of certification. 

To be eligible for renewal, the certified guardian must:

A certified guardian must complete at least 12 hours of approved continuing 
education  during  each  certification  period.  The  12  hours  must  include  a 
minimum of two hours of ethics and one hour of legislative update. In this 
rule,  the  term  “certified  guardian”  includes  a  provisionally  certified 
guardian.   

The required hours must be earned prior to the expiration of the certified 
guardian’s certification period. 

A  certified  guardian  may  carry  forward  for  the  following  certification 
period not more than four regular continuing education hours, not including 
ethics or legislative update hours, which were earned in excess of the 12 
hours  used  to  satisfy  the  continuing  education  requirements  of  the 
immediately  previous  certification  period.  Ethics  hours  and  legislative 
update hours may not be carried forward from one certification period  to 
another certification period even if the hours were earned in excess of the 
minimum requirements for ethics and legislative update hours. 

d)    A  continuing  education  activity  for  a  certified  guardian  must  be  an 
organized program of learning dealing with matters that are directly related 
to the guardianship profession, the services guardians provide, and the legal 
process  involved  in  guardianship  proceedings.  A  continuing  education 
activity  should  increase  participants’  understanding  of  the  Texas  judicial 
system,  the  responsibilities  of  a  certified  guardian,  and  the  certified 
guardian’s impact on the judicial process and the public.  

Continuing education activities for certified guardians must include one or 
more of the following subjects:

guardianship  certification,  and  the  Minimum  Standards  for  the 
Provision  of  Guardianship  Services  adopted  by  the  Commission; 
and  

management issues, including financial planning and accounting.  

 
A certified guardian may request up to six hours of continuing education 
credit  during  each  two-year  certification  period  for  teaching  courses, 
speaking at seminars, or authoring books or articles related to the subject 
matter specified in (e). The certified guardian must submit an application 
for  teaching  credit  on  a  form  provided  by  the  Commission.  Credit  for 
preparation and presentation may be provided on the basis of hour-for-hour 
credit  for  each  hour  spent  preparing  the  article  or  book  or  making  the 
presentation.

Certified process server means a person who is certified by the Commission to 
serve process statewide. 

8.2 

Initial certification requirement 

A person seeking statewide certification to serve process must file with the 
Commission an application, sworn or under penalty of perjury, in the form 
prescribed by the Commission. 

An  application  must  comply  with  the  requirements  of  Rule  3.1  and  also 
contain  a  statement  indicating  whether  the  applicant  has  ever  been 
convicted of a felony or of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude. The 
Commission or Director may deny certification to an applicant convicted of 
a felony or of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude. If an applicant’s

criminal history reflects that the applicant was charged with a felony or a 
misdemeanor  involving  moral  turpitude  and  the  charges  resulted  in  an 
outcome  other  than  acquittal  or  conviction  (such  as  pretrial  diversion, 
probation, deferred adjudication, community supervision, or similar result), 
the Commission or Director may consider the applicant’s criminal history 
using the factors listed in Rule 3.5 in determining whether the application 
should be granted. 

The application must include a certificate from the director of a civil process 
service course, approved by the Commission for certification in every state 
court, stating that the applicant has completed the approved course within 
the  prior  year  for  initial  certification.  The  applicant  bears  the  burden  of 
establishing  that  he  or  she  has  completed  within  the  prior  year  a  course 
approved by the Commission for certification in every state court. 
 
Applications  will  be  reviewed  and  either  approved  or  rejected  for  good 
cause stated. In appropriate circumstances, the Commission or Director may 
approve applications on a conditional or probationary basis.   

 

Certification is effective for three years from the last day of the month that 
the certification issues, unless it is revoked or suspended under these rules. 

To  renew  a  certification,  a  process  server  must  timely  submit  to  the 
Commission  a  renewal  application,  including  a  current  criminal  history 
statement  and  all  applicable  fees,  and  complete  the  continuing  education 
requirements in Rules 4.1-4.3 and 8.5. 

The renewal application and all applicable fees are due 45 days prior to the 
expiration of the certification. An application is timely if it is postmarked 
on or before the due date. Failure to complete a renewal application at least 
45 days prior to expiration may result in a lapse of certification.   

A certified process server whose certification expires between September 
1,  2014  and  August  31,  2017  must,  before  renewing  the  certification, 
provide the Commission with his or her Texas and national criminal history 
records by having his or her fingerprints submitted according to directions 
published on the Commission’s website. The Texas and national criminal 
history searches must be conducted no earlier than 90 days preceding the 
date the renewal application is submitted.

b) 

other good cause as determined by the Commission. 

8.5 

Continuing Education  

To  renew  certification,  a  certified  process  server  must  establish  that  all 
required  continuing  education  has  been  completed.  Rules  4.1-4.3 
supplement this rule and establish additional requirements  for continuing 
education. 

A  certified  process  server  must  complete  at  least  12  hours  of  approved 
continuing  education  during  the  process  server’s  three-year  certification 
period. For process servers who are already certified on the effective date 
of these rules, the three-year requirement begins with the process server’s 
next three-year certification period. 

A continuing  education  activity  for  a  certified process  server must be an 
organized program of learning dealing with matters that are directly related 
to  service  of  process.  A  continuing  education  activity  should  increase 
participants’ understanding of the Texas judicial system, the responsibilities 
of a certified process server, and the certified process server’s impact on the 
judicial process and the public.

record, other than a proceeding before the court in which the judge is acting 
as a magistrate. 

Dishonorable means lacking in integrity, indicating an intent to deceive or 
take  unfair  advantage  of  another  person,  or  bringing  disrepute  to  the 
profession of court interpretation. 

Licensed  court  interpreter  means  a  person  who  is  licensed  by  the 
Commission to interpret court proceedings for an individual who can hear 
but who does not comprehend English or communicate in English.

A Master Designation permits the interpreter to interpret court proceedings 
in all courts in this State, including justice courts and municipal courts. 

Unethical  means  conduct  that  does  not  conform  to  generally  accepted 
standards of conduct for professional court interpreters. 

9.2 

Licensing requirement 

(a) 

The Commission must issue a court interpreter license to a person who: 

(1) 

satisfies the requirements of Section 3.0 of these rules; 

prior  to  filing  an  application  with  the  Commission,  satisfactorily 
completes a Commission-approved orientation course of at least six 
hours; 

satisfies the examination requirements of Rule 9.3; and 

completes  all  requirements,  including  satisfying  the  examination 
requirements within one year of the date of the application. 

A  license  issued  under  this  rule  is  valid  for  one  year  from  the  date  of 
issuance and must have a language endorsement for each language that the 
applicant will interpret. 

Each  applicant  must  pass  all  parts  of  a  Commission  approved  language 
examination for each language that the applicant will interpret. 

An applicant must pass the written examination with a score of at least 80%. 

An applicant must pass all three parts of the oral examination according to 
the following: 

An  applicant  scoring  at  least  60%  on  each  part  of  the  oral 
examination is eligible for a Basic Designation license. 

An  applicant  scoring  at  least  70%  on  each  part  of  the  oral

An applicant who fails an examination may apply for reexamination at a 
scheduled examination held at least six months after the date the individual 
failed the original examination. 

9.4 

Renewal 

To  renew  a  license,  a  court  interpreter  must  timely  submit  to  the 
Commission a renewal application and all applicable fees and complete the 
continuing education requirements in Rules 4.1-4.3 and 9.7.   

The renewal application and all applicable fees are due 45 days prior to the 
expiration of the license. An application is timely if it is postmarked on or 
before  the  due  date.  A  licensed  court  interpreter’s  failure  to  receive  a 
renewal notice from the Commission does not exempt the interpreter from 
any requirements of these rules or of other rules governing the profession. 

A person whose license has been expired for one year or less may renew the 
license by paying to the Commission the appropriate renewal fee for late 
renewals.  

A  licensed  court  interpreter  whose  license  expires  between  September  1, 
2014 and August 31, 2015 must, before renewing the license, provide the 
Commission with his or her Texas and national criminal history records by 
having his or her fingerprints submitted according to directions published 
on  the  Commission’s  website.  The  Texas  and  national  criminal  history 
searches must be conducted no earlier than 90 days preceding the date the 
renewal application is submitted. 

9.5 

Responsibilities of Licensed Court Interpreters 

A  licensed  court  interpreter  must  include  his  or  her  name  and  license 
number on all official correspondence and on all contracts and invoices for 
court interpreter services. 

A licensed court interpreter must present his or her court interpreter license 
upon the request of a court or an officer of the court. 

9.6 

Enforcement 

After  notice  and  an  opportunity  for  a  hearing  under  Rule  5.10,  the 
Commission  may  deny,  revoke,  suspend,  or  refuse  to  renew  a  license  or 
reprimand a licensed court interpreter on finding that the person: 

made a material misstatement in an application for a license;

rule adopted under Chapter 157;  

engaged  in  dishonorable  or  unethical  conduct  likely  to  deceive, 
defraud,  or  harm  the  public  or  a  person  for  whom  the  interpreter 
interprets; or 

was finally convicted of a crime that indicates the person lacks the 
honesty,  trustworthiness,  or  integrity  to  hold  the  license,  as 
determined using Rule 3.5. 

(2) 

3) 

  (

  (

4) 

The Commission may reissue a license to an individual whose license has 
been  revoked  if  the  individual  applies  in  writing  to  the  Commission  and 
shows good cause to justify reissuance of the license. 

The Commission may assess an administrative penalty under Chapter 153 
of the Government Code against a person who violates Chapter 157 of the 
Code or a rule adopted under that chapter.  

To renew a license, a licensed court interpreter must complete eight hours 
of approved continuing education in courses approved by the Commission, 
including two hours of instruction in ethics. 

Except as provided by (c), the continuing education hours must have been 
completed  within  the  term  of  the  current  license,  in  the  case  of  a  timely 
renewal. For a late renewal, the continuing education hours must have been 
completed  within  the  one  year  period  immediately  prior  to  the  date  of 
renewal. 

A  licensed  court  interpreter  may  carry  forward  to  the  next  certification 
period up to four continuing education hours, but ethics credit may  not be 
carried forward. 

A licensed court interpreter may not receive continuing education credit for 
attending the same course more than once within the same license period. 

Notwithstanding Rule 4.3(g), a licensed court interpreter must retain a copy 
of the certificate of completion for a course for one year after the date of 
completion. In conducting any inspection or investigation of the licensed 
court  interpreter,  the  Commission  may  examine  the  licensed  court 
interpreter’s records to determine compliance with this requirement. 

To  be  approved,  a  continuing  education  course  must  be  dedicated  to 
instruction in one or more of the following topics:
