      <pre>Ninth Court of Appeals 

Leave Policy 

This policy outlines leave  requirements for  Ninth Court  of Appeals’  employees.  Each  state 
agency/court is required to keep a record of its employees’ accruals of vacation leave, sick 
leave; and comp leave; and account for whether leave taken is for vacation leave, sick leave, 
comp leave, other paid leave, or leave without pay. 

An employee is expected to report to work at the appointed time and work all of his or her 
scheduled hours.  The standard workweek for full-time employees is 40 hours and part-time 
is 20 hours. The workweek is Monday through Friday. 

Each employee receives a system generated Employee Monthly Time and Leave Report that 
shows  the  employee's  current  leave  balances  reported  to  the  State.    Leave  balances  are 
calculated from the Monthly Comp & Leave Report w/ Request for Leave Time form submitted 
and approved for each employee. 

ll time and leave is maintained in the State’s time and leave system in CAPPS.  All employees 
are  required  to  complete  a  Monthly  Comp  &  Leave  Report  so  their  leave  time  taken  and 
compensatory  time  earned  can  be  entered  in  CAPPS.  CAPPS  is  an  exception-based  leave 
system.  For  timekeeping  purposes,  all leave  is  to  be  rounded  to  quarter-hour  (15  minute) 
increments. 

ll  employees  must  receive  prior  approval  from  their  supervisors  for  all leave.  Supervisors 

must designate approval in writing on the Request for Leave Time form.

General Policy Information 

Purpose 

iscretion of Supervisors 

Before requesting leave, employees should ensure that they have adequate leave balances 
and  that  their  absence  will  not  interfere  with  the  performance  of  their  job  duties.  Leave 
approval is not automatic. While every attempt is made to accommodate employees’ timely 
leave requests, supervisors have the authority and responsibility to use their discretion to 
ensure that adequate staff remains on duty to perform the work of the Court. 

When advance approval is not possible, the employee must notify the supervisor as soon as 
possible of the dates and reasons for the absence. Unless extenuating circumstances exist, 
employees are expected to notify their supervisors of absences no later than one hour after 
their scheduled starting time.

Excessive Absenteeism or Tardiness 

Absenteeism or tardiness is excessive when an employee is unable to adequately perform 
his/her job, or when the normal day-to-day work activities of the office are disrupted due to 
excessive  and/or  unscheduled  absences  or  tardiness  by  the  employee.  Excessive 
absenteeism  or  tardiness  may  be  grounds  for  disciplinary  actions,  up  to  and  including 
termination. 

Unauthorized Absence 

An employee who fails to report to or remain at work, or who fails to return to work upon 
expiration of approved leave, may be considered to have abandoned his or her position with 
the agency. Such an employee will be expected to produce a satisfactory explanation for the 
unauthorized absence. An employee who is absent from work for three or more consecutive 
days without contacting his or her supervisor will be deemed to have abandoned his or her 
job at the close  of the  third day. Unauthorized absence(s) may be grounds  for disciplinary 
actions, up to and including termination. 

omp time provides an employee with one hour of paid time off for each comp hour worked. 
An employee’s personal residence shall not be deemed to be the employee’s regular place of 
business or duty point for the purpose of earning compensatory time.  Comp time is credited 
as one hour earned for each hour worked up to 8 hours per Work Holiday. 
 

  C

Compensatory Time 
(See Texas Government Code 659.015, 659.016, 659.022, 659.023) 

Approval to Earn Comp Time 

All employees must have prior  written approval from their supervisor before  earning comp 
time. Prior written approval is not required before earning work holiday comp time. 

An employee’s work schedule may be adjusted to ensure that the employee does not exceed 
40 hours. For example, an employee who must work 2 extra hours on Tuesday can be required 
to leave 2 hours early on Friday so as not to exceed 40 hours that week. 

se of Accrued Comp Time Before Lapsing  

Comp time must be used within twelve (12) months of when it is earned or it will be forfeited. 
Comp time is not transferable to another state agency and will not be paid when an employee 
separates from the agency. 

Holidays 
(See Texas Government Code 662.003) 
 

Types  of  Holidays  –  There  are  three  types  of  holidays  to  which  an  employee  is  entitled: 
national, state, and optional. Eligible employees are entitled to a paid day off from work on 
national and state holidays as specified by the Legislature. 
 

2 

  U

 

Eligibility – Employees are entitled to paid day off from work on a specified holiday if:  

the Jefferson County Courthouse is closed, 

the holiday does not fall on a Saturday or Sunday, and 

the employee is not on Leave Without Pay 

 

 

 

 

Skeleton Crew Days – The Court will have a sufficient number of employees on duty during a 
Work Holiday (legal holidays the office is open) to conduct the public business except for those 
state  holidays  which  fall  on  a  Saturday  or  Sunday,  the  Friday  after  Thanksgiving  Day,  and 
December  24th  and  26th.  Supervisors  may  use  their  discretion  in  determining  staffing 
requirements on skeleton crew days. Employees who must work on a national or state holiday 
will accrue holiday compensatory time and will be allowed time off during the 12-month period 
following the date of the holiday worked. Employees who work on skeleton crew days must 
enter the number of hours worked  on their Monthly Comp & Leave Report to receive credit 
for this time.  

Optional  Holidays  –  An employee  is  entitled  to  paid  leave  to  observe  an  optional holiday 
(Cesar  Chavez  Day,  Rosh  Hashanah,  Yom  Kippur,  or  Good  Friday)  if  he/she  agrees  to 
relinquish a state holiday (skeleton crew day) during that same fiscal year. If the employee 
fails  to  work  a  skeleton  crew  day  in  the  same  fiscal  year,  a  day  of  vacation  leave  will  be 
charged instead. If no vacation leave is available, he or she will lose one day of pay. 

nnual Vacation Leave 
(See Texas Government Code 661.152) 

Eligibility – An employee is eligible to take annual vacation leave with pay after meeting the 
specified requirements: 

  an  employee  with  no  previous  State  employment  may  take  annual  leave  after 

completing six (6) full months of continuous employment with the Court; or 

  an employee with previous state employment who has completed six (6) full months 
or  more  of  continuous  state  employment  and  whose  vacation  balance  has  been 
transferred from the other  state agency is eligible to take the accrued annual leave 
upon employment; or 

  an employee with previous State employment who has a break in service of at least 
30  days  and  has  completed  six  (6)  full  months  or  more  of  continuous  State 
employment may take annual leave as it is earned upon re-employment.

  A

 

Rate  of  Accrual  and  Allowable  Carry  Forward  –  The  schedule  below  shows  rates  of  annual 
leave accrual for various lengths of State employment and the maximum number of hours an 
employee  may  carry  forward  each  fiscal  year  beginning  on  September  1st.  The  schedule  is 
based on full-time employment. 

 

 

Employees accrue vacation from their first day of employment. They end this accrual on their 
last day of duty. Duty day means an employee’s last physical date on the job. An employee 
may not accrue vacation time while exhausting vacation time for termination purposes. 

An  employee  in  a  leave-without-pay  (LWOP)  status  for  a  full  calendar  month  does  not 
accrue  vacation leave for that month. An employee on paid or unpaid leave which extends 
into a subsequent month does not earn accrued leave until he/she returns to work. 

Excess Balances – Excess annual leave balances above the amount that can be carried forward 
will be credited to the employee’s sick leave balances on the first day of the new fiscal year. 

Higher Accrual Effective Date – Credit for the higher rate of accrual as shown on the above 
schedule will be given on the first calendar day of the month, if the employee’s anniversary 
date falls on the first calendar day of the month. If the employee’s anniversary date falls after 
the first calendar day of the month, the increase will occur on the first calendar day of the 
following month. 

Part-time  Employees  –  The  number  of  hours  accrued  and  the  amount  of  maximum  carry 
forward allowed for part-time employees will be on a proportionate basis. 

Sick Leave 
(See Texas Government Code 661.202) 

Sick  Leave  Accrual  –  Each  employee  accrues  paid  sick  leave  beginning  on  the  first  day  of 
employment  and  ending  on  the  last  duty  day  of  state  employment.  Duty  day  means  an 
employee’s last physical day on the job.  An employee will be credited with his/her full accrual 
for each full or fraction of a month worked. 

4 

Full-time  employees  accrue  sick  leave  at  the  rate  of  eight  (8)  hours  per  month.  Part-time 
employees accrue sick leave at a rate in proportion to that of a full-time employee. Sick leave 
accumulates with the unused amount carried forward each month, and there is no limitation 
on the amount which may be accrued. An employee in a leave status on the first day of the 
month  may  not  use  sick  leave  accrued  for  that  month  until  after  the  employee  returns  to 
work. 

Use of Sick Leave – An employee is eligible to use sick leave immediately upon employment 
with  the  agency.  Sick  leave  may  be  taken  when  sickness,  injury,  or  pregnancy  and 
confinement prevent the employee’s performance of duty or when the employee is needed to 
care and assist a member of his/her immediate family who is sick. An employee’s use of sick 
leave for family members not residing in that employee’s household is strictly limited to the 
time necessary to provide care and assistance to the spouse, child or parent of the employee 
that needs such care and assistance as a direct result of a documented medical condition. 

Timely Notification – An employee who must be absent from work because of sickness, injury, 
or pregnancy and confinement must notify his/her supervisor at the earliest possible time. If 
the absence is going to be for more than one day, the employee must notify the supervisor 
of his/her status each morning, unless other arrangements are made. 

Absence for More Than Three Days – When an employee is off work due to sickness, injury, 
pregnancy, confinement, etc.  for more than three (3) consecutive work days, he/she must 
submit with the leave form a doctor’s statement showing the cause or nature of the illness, 
or  some  other  written  statement  of  the  facts  concerning  the  illness,  acceptable  to  the 
employee’s supervisor. 

Excessive Use of Sick Leave – Excessive use of sick leave may be evident when an employee 
uses sick leave as it is accrued and/or totally runs out  of leave (unless due to a bona  fide 
serious  health  condition  as  specified  under  the  Family  and  Medical  Leave  Act),  resulting in 
leave without pay status. 

Family and Medical Leave Act 
(See Texas Government Code 661.912) 

Purpose – The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) requires the agency to provide eligible 
employees up to twelve (12) weeks per year off work for the birth, adoption, or foster care 
of a child, or because the employee or a spouse, parent, or child of the employee has a serious 
illness.  State  law  requires  employees  to  utilize  all  sick  and  annual  paid  leave  while  taking 
leave pursuant to this provision, unless they are receiving temporary  disability or workers’ 
compensation benefits.  

Eligibility – For purposes of the FMLA, an eligible employee is one who has been employed by 
the  State  for  at  least  12  months,  and  who  has  worked  at  least  1,250  hours  during  the 
preceding  12  months.  When  calculating  the  required  12  months  of  State  employment  for 
FMLA  eligibility,  all  State  employment  will  be  counted  and  it  need  not  be  continuous.  The 
1,250 hours refers to hours actually worked and does not include any paid time off.  

Conditions – An eligible employee is entitled to a total of  12  work weeks of leave during a 
rolling 12-month period which begins on the date an employee uses any FMLA leave.  FMLA 
leave may be used for: 

 

the birth of a son or daughter, and to care for the newborn child; 

 

5 

the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care; 

the care of the employee’s spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition; or 

  a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions 

 

 

of his/her job. 

Serious  Health  Condition  –  A  serious  health  condition  is  defined  as  an  illness,  injury, 
impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves either inpatient care in a hospital, 
hospice, or residential medical care facility or continuing treatment by a licensed health care 
provider.  

12-Week Maximum – Under FMLA, the maximum combination of paid and unpaid leave will 
be  limited  to  12  weeks.  Any  extension  beyond  this  time  period  must  be  requested  and 
approved under provisions of the agency Leave Without Pay policy. Failure of the employee 
to report back to work at the end of the prescribed period, without prior written approval from 
the Chief Justice, will be considered leave without pay. Unauthorized absence is grounds for 
disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 

Paid Leave/Unpaid Leave – The FMLA does not entitle an employee to paid leave in addition 
to other types of paid leave already accrued by the employee. Eligible employees must use 
all  appropriate  paid  leave,  annual  and  sick,  while  taking  Family  Medical  Leave.  State 
compensatory time, holiday time, and administrative leave that are benefits of the State may 
be counted toward the entitlement. Federal law does not permit FLSA compensatory time to 
be  used  concurrently  with  Family  Medical  Leave.    If  an  employee  elects  to  use  FLSA 
Compensatory time while out on Family Medical Leave, that time is not counted toward the 
12-week entitlement. After all paid leave is exhausted, employee will be on unpaid leave for 
the remainder of their Family Medical Leave. 

Planned  Medical  Treatment  –  When  the  need  for  leave  is  foreseeable,  based  on  planned 
medical treatment for the employee or family member, the employee must make a reasonable 
effort to schedule the treatment so as not to unduly interrupt the operations of the employer, 
subject to the approval of the health care provider providing the planned care. The employee 
should provide 30 days notice, or if not possible, as much notice as is practicable.  

Intermittent Leaves and Reduced Schedules – Leave for the illness of the employee or family 
member  may  be  taken  intermittently  or  on  a  reduced  schedule  when  medically  necessary.  
Leave for childbirth or placement for adoption or foster care may be taken intermittently or 
on a reduced work schedule only with the agreement of the human resources director.  

Reinstatement – An eligible employee who takes FMLA leave is entitled to be restored to his 
or her former position, or to an equivalent position with equivalent pay, and other terms and 
conditions of employment.  

Benefit Rights – The taking of leave under FMLA may not result in the loss of any employment 
benefit accrued prior to the date on which the leave commenced.  Nothing in the Act, however, 
entitles an employee to any right, benefit, or position other than one to which the employee 
would have been entitled had the leave not been taken.  

Insurance – The agency will maintain any group health coverage for the employee on leave 
on the same terms as if the employee were at work for the duration of the leave. An employee 
on unpaid leave for an entire calendar month is responsible for paying his/her portion of the 
insurance premium and the State will pay its portion.  

 

6 

An employee who is granted an approved leave of absence under this policy may continue his 
or her group insurance coverage by arranging with Human Resources to pay his or her portion 
of the premium contributions during the period of unpaid absence. Employees will be required 
to continue to pay their share of group health benefit costs during the period of leave under 
the law.  

If an employee elects not to return to work upon completion of an approved unpaid leave of 
absence, the agency may recover from the employee the cost of any premiums paid by the 
State  to  maintain  the  employee’s  coverage,  unless  the  failure  to  return  to  work  was  for 
reasons beyond the employee’s control or due to the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a 
serious health condition.  

Certification of Serious Health Condition – An employee requesting leave under FMLA because 
of  his/her  or  a  family  member’s  serious  health  condition  will  be  required  to  provide 
certification  from  the  health  care  provider  treating  the  condition.  The  health  care  provider 
should  provide  detailed  information  regarding  the  condition  of  the  employee  or  family 
member, and also give an estimate of the amount of time needed for the employee’s recovery 
or the amount of time the employee is needed to care for the family member. If intermittent 
leave or a reduced leave schedule is requested, the health care provider should also state the 
dates and duration of planned medical treatment.  

Return to Work – An employee who has been absent due to a serious health condition must 
provide certification from the health care provider that he/she is able to resume work.  

Notice of Birth or Placement of a Child – In the case of FMLA leave for the birth or placement 
of  a  child  for  adoption  or  foster  care,  an  employee  should  provide  30  days  advance  notice 
before  the  date  on  which  the  leave  would  begin,  if  possible.  If  the  employee  is  unable  to 
provide such notice, he or she must provide as much notice as is practicable.  

Court Designation – When the Court has been notified of absences indicating that a serious 
medical  condition  may  exist,  the  Clerk  of  the  Court  will  ask  for  sufficient  information  to 
determine  whether  the  employee  is  entitled  to  FMLA  leave.  If  so,  the  Court  will  make  a 
preliminary  designation  of  qualification  and  will  notify  the  employee.  The  employee  will  be 
asked  to  provide  medical  certification  of  the  nature  of  the  illness  or  injury  and  whether  it 
qualifies as a serious medical condition.  

Returning to Work Following an Injury or Illness – The Court will make every reasonable effort 
to provide suitable return-to-work opportunities for an employee who is unable to perform his 
or her regular duties following a work-related injury or illness. This may include modifying the 
employee’s regular job or, if available, providing temporary alternate work depending on the 
employee’s physical abilities. An employee must obtain a valid return-to-work release from a 
qualified physician and interact with his or her supervisor and Human Resources to determine 
the capacity in which he or she may return to work. 

Parental Leave 
(See Texas Government Code 661.913) 

12 Week Maximum – Employees with fewer than 12 months of state service or less than 1,250 
hours in the 12 months immediately preceding  the start of leave are entitled to a parental 
leave of absence, not to exceed 12 weeks, for the birth of a natural child or the adoption or 
placement in foster care of a child under three years of age.  This period begins with the date 
of  birth,  or  the  first  day  the  adoptive  or  foster  child  is  formally  placed  in  the  home.  The 

 

7 

employee must use all available accrued leave before going on leave without pay while taking 
the parental leave. 

Notification – An employee anticipating using parental  leave should notify his/her supervisor 
and Human Resources at the earliest possible opportunity in order to allow ample time to plan 
for covering duties for the duration of the absence.  

FMLA Provisions – Parental leave is only available for employees who are not eligible for FMLA 
leave.  

Policy – Any State employee who is a foster parent to a  child under the conservatorship of 
the Department of Family and Protective Services is entitled to a leave of absence with full 
pay for the purpose of attending staff meetings held by the DFPS regarding the child under 
the  foster  care  of  the  employee,  or  to  attend  the  Admission,  Review  and  Dismissal  (ARD) 
meeting held by a school district regarding the child. 

The  Chief Justice  may  grant  emergency  leave  for  a  reason other than a reason described 
under  section  661.902(a)  of  the  Government  Code,  which  provides  emergency  leave 
because of a death in the employee’s family. 

The Chief Justice shall grant emergency leave if 

)  the employee requests the leave; and 

)  the Chief Justice determines the employee has shown good cause for taking emergency 

leave; and 

)  the Chief Justice believes in good faith that the employee being granted the leave 
intends to return to the employee’s position upon expiration of the leave granted. 

By October 1 of each year, the Clerk of the Court shall report to the Comptroller  the  name 
and  position  of  each  Court employee  granted  more  than  32  hours  of emergency  leave 
during the previous state fiscal year, the reason for the granting of such leave, and the total 
number of hours of emergency leave granted to the employee in the state fiscal year. 

mergency Leave due to  Death in the Family  –  Employees  are  eligible  for  Emergency 
Leave  due  to  a  death  in  the  employee’s  family.  The  employee’s  family  is  defined  as  the 
employee’s  spouse,  and  the  employee’s  or  spouse’s  parents,  children,  brothers,  sisters, 
grandparents, and grandchildren. For the purpose of this policy, the term sibling includes an 
employee’s stepbrother or stepsister.  The employee,  however,  is  not  eligible  for  this  leave 
if  the  employee  is  in  an  unpaid  absence  status  at  the  time  emergency  leave  is  to 
commence.  [Tex. Gov’t Code § 661.902(a)]

Foster Parent Leave 
(See Texas Government Code 661.906) 

Emergency Leave due to Inclement Weather or Observance of a Holiday  -  The Chief Justice 
may  grant  emergency  leave  because  the  Court  is  closed  due  to  weather  conditions  or  in 
observance of a holiday.  [Tex. Gov’t Code § 661.902(c)] 

Emergency Leave During Court Investigation – The Chief Justice may grant emergency 
leave  to  a Court  employee  who  is  the  subject  of  an  investigation  being  conducted  by the 
Court. The Court employee who is subject to an agency investigation is ineligible to receive 
leave  for  that  reason  under  any  other  provision  of  Subchapter  Z,  Chapter  661  of  the 
Government Code. Not later than the last day of each quarter, the Court shall report to the 
State Auditor and the Legislative Budget Board each Court employee who has been granted 
168 hours or more of leave under this provision during the fiscal quarter. The report must 
include a brief statement as to the reason each such employee remains on leave. [Tex. Gov’t

Approved Leave Without Pay 
(See Texas Government Code 661.909) 

Leave Without Pay (LWOP) is an approved temporary absence from duty of an employee who 
intends to return to work. During the length of the absence, which cannot exceed 12 months, 
pay is suspended. All available accumulated paid leave entitlements must be exhausted before 
granting Leave Without Pay. 

Employees  requesting  Leave  Without  Pay  must  submit  their  request  in  writing  to  their 
supervisor. If approved by the supervisor, all requests for Leave Without Pay will be reviewed 
by  the  Chief  Justice  for  final  determination.  Approval  of  the  request  is  not  automatic.  The 
requested leave time may be approved, disapproved or adjusted to meet the business needs 
of the Court. If the request is disapproved or adjusted, and the employee is unable or declines 
to remain on the job, the agency may take appropriate action to terminate employment.  

Leave Accruals and Insurance Premium – If an absence  covers an entire calendar month, 
the employee does not accrue any vacation or sick leave. The employee is also responsible 
for payment of his/her insurance premiums.  A full or partial calendar month during which 
an employee is on leave without pay does not constitute a break in continuity of employment. 
Except  for  an  employee  returning  from  military  leave  without  pay,  a  full  calendar  month 
during which an employee is on leave without pay is not counted in computing total state 
service credit.   

Failure to Return to Work – Failure to return to work from Leave Without Pay on the approved 
return date will be considered abandonment of position, and the agency may take appropriate 
action to terminate employment.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
