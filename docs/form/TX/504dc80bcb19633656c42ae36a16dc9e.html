88TH LEGISLATIVE SESSION ADMINISTRATOR'S STATEMENT 

Administrator·s Statement 
for Fiscal Years 2024 and 2025 
88th Legislature 

Texas· intermediate appellate courts have weathered serious challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 ransomware attack. but these challenges will 
continue into the foreseeable future.  The courts have not been fully funded since 2015 yet have dutifully risen to the task as can be seen by the dramatic decline in the 
number of cases pending in the courts of appeals. Respectfully.  additional  funding is now necessary to ensure the etlicient administration of justice going forward . 

The core function of Texas intermediate appellate courts is to process. review. and decide by written opinion appeals from  trial courts in civil and criminal cases. 
Population growth across the State and the magnitude of annual case filings. in concert with an ever-increasing number of case types requiring expedited review. make 
clear that the courts of appeals need sufficient resources to manage their busy dockets and provide the high quality of justice to which the citizens of Texas arc entitled. 
Although case filings decreased in 2020 and 2021  due to the pandemic, filings have. unsurprisingly. returned to pre-pandemic levels as of June 2022 and are expected to 
continue to increase as trial courts resume full operations. The Annual Statistical Report for 2021  reported that family  violence cases increased at the highest rate over the 
past live years. We anticipate a rise in other types of litigation as well that will result in a surge of appeals over the next biennium. 

The courts of appeals. collectively. began  in  the 79th and 80th Legislative Sessions to work toward a zero-based budget model referred to as Similar Funding for 
Same-Sized Courts. This budget model quantified the funding required to meet the personnel and operational needs of the courts. thus enabling the courts to accomplish 
their core function and meet their performance measures. The Similar Funding for Same-Sized Courts initiative was fully funded  in  2015. and the courts have been 
operating under this zero-based budget model since that lime. 

Since the development of the budget model in approximately 2005. the demands of the core function of the courts have required higher-skilled and higher-salary positions, 
The prior model used salary classification levels for attorneys and staff that are now outdated. Additionally. operating costs for necessary resources such as 
Westlaw/LexisNexis and other administrative needs have increased dramatically. Further. considering recent attacks on judges and an increase in mass shootings. more 
funds arc needed to provide adequate security at the courts. 

Prior to the 87th Legislative Session. in early 2020. the Council of Chiefs revised the data in  the budget model to reflect the increased funding needed to optimally operate 
the fourteen  courts.  However. in preparing for the impending session. the Council  was keenly aware that the need for state funds to address the pandemic was the highest 
priority. Because there were many uncertainties regarding the state of the economy and it was anticipated state revenues would be limited. agencies were asked to reduce 
budgets by 5%. The Council appreciated and respected the position of the state and. therefore. did not seek additional funding at that time. While the Council greatly 
appreciates that budgets of the courts of appeals in the last biennium were not cut. funding of the updated budget model is. nonetheless. now necessar)'. Accordingly. 
the budget model data has been further updated to reflect current operating needs. 

Since  1983. the work of the intermediate courts of appeals has been accomplished by 80 justices statewide. In that time.  the population ofTexas has nearly doubled. A key 
component to handling the ever-increasing workload without additional justices has been the employment of a highly skilled and trained professional workforce. 
including appellate lawyers and clerical staff. who assist the justices in processing complex cases. researching and drafting orders and opinions. disposing of voluminous 
motions. and managing accelerated and emergency matters. Appellate work requires specialized knowledge and significant experience. and the courts constantly  face

competition from  higher-paying private practice and government legal jobs for skilled attorneys and staff. Specialized technological skills arc also necessary to 
understand and operate the complex case management system current!)  used by the courts. Transitioning to a new case management system  in the next biennium  will 
also require special skills.  Hiring and retaining qualified support staff is critical to the courts· ability to manage their dockets and efficiently  resolve the cases before them . 

Funding for al I fourteen courts of appeals comprises merely 0.03 5% of the State budget as a whole.  Yet.  on average. 96.5% of each appellate court ·s budget is dedicated to 
salaries and  benefits. Without additional funding.  appellate courts will be unable to attract and retain the highly trained and skilled support staff with the specialized 
knowledge and relevant experience critical to the courts· function.  Without sufficient qualified staff. courts cannot comply with Legislative mandates to give accelerated 
and preferential treatment to certain appeals. such as parental-termination and juvenile-certification appeals under the Family Code. mental-health appeals under the 
Health and Safety Code. and interlocutory appeals under the Civil  Practice and Remedies Code. 

All  fourteen courts of appeals continue to expend resources to recover from the 2020  ransom ware attack on the courts· computer systems. The loss of data overall was 
substantial and continues to  require resources to reconstitute work that could not be recovered.  And while all State agencies experienced the negative effects of 
COVID-19. the combined effects of the ransomware attack plus COY ID-19 created a unique hardship for the appellate courts. 

EXCEPTIONAL ITEM# 1:  increase the general revenue limit to meet the updated budget model 

The updated budget model reflects increased funding  to pennit the courts to attract and retain experienced la,\ yers and support staff with the requisite knowledge and 
skills to assist the courts in  meeting their performance measures and fulfilling the core function  of timely processing and disposing of appeals.  Without an increase in 
funding. appellate courts will lose talented personnel to higher-paying private jobs.  This loss ofl:.ey personnel will detrimentally affect performance standards. including 
( 1) a reduction in overall dispositions of appeals.  preventing the courts from  clearing older cases and reaching the disposition target of 100% of new appeals filed  in the 
biennium. and (2) an increase in the time from filing until disposition for those appeals which remain pending. Any  unnecessary delay will be particularly devastating to 
the State by creating significant adverse consequences for the businesses. families.  and children in Texas that are awaiting justice through the resolution of their disputes. 
Note. the updated budget model does not include an  adjustment for the impact of inflation. 

EXCEPTIONAL ITEM #2: JUDICIARY-WIDE INFLATION RELIEF 

Attorneys and staff of the courts of appeals have been  impacted in many ways by increasing costs due to inllation . The impact has been devastating for many because 
the State has not given them a meaningful raise in a significant period of time. Their buying power for goods and services has diminished and. at some courts. has 
resulted in attrition by those seeking higher-paying jobs. If salaries are not increased. the courts risk losing more personnel that will be costly to replace.  Training takes 
time and will impact the ability of the courts to meet the current and expected demands as we navigate the post-pandemic surge. 

On May 4, 2022. the Council of Chiefs submitted written testimony to the Senate Committee on Finance comprised of testimonials from court personnel describing 
personal experiences with rising costs. The Council asks for consideration of this testimony. 

The courts of appeals join in  the judiciary-wide inflation relief for non-judicial employees sought by Article IV courts and agencies. Respectfully. a ten percent ( 10%) 
increase on the budget model salaries is sought to help absorb the impact of inflation.  To maintain the Similar Funding for Same-Sized Courts model that has worked 
exceptionally well for years. the requested percentage must be  based on the budget model salaries. This exceptional item is not duplicative of exceptional item  I.  which 
docs not include an adjustment for the inflation that is expected to persist for some time to come.

225 Fifth Court of Appeals District, Dallas 

8/5/2022  3:30:IJPM 

RIDER REQUESTS: 
The courts of appeals also request the following with regard to the across-the-board riders found  in Article IV (p. IV-38): 
I.  Retain Article IV rider. Sec. 3. Appellate Court Exemptions 
2.  Retain Article IV rider. Sec. 5. lnteragency Contracts for Assigned Judges for Appellate Courts 
3.  Retain Article IV rider. Sec. 6. Appellate Court Transfer Authority 

Historically. the Legislature has granted the courts exemption from certain limitations in the General Appropriations Act. They have also granted the courts the authority 
to carry over unexpended budget balances between years within the biennium.  The flexibility afforded by these measures enhances the courts' management ability. and 
we seek continuation of these budget features. 

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS OF SUPPORT: 

In order for the courts of appeals to function efficiently. it is vital that the Office of Court Administration (OCA) be adequate!)· funded.  The courts of appeals rely on 
many of the services provided by OCA and. therefore. the courts of appeals fully support the exceptional  items the OCA requests as part of its funding . More specifically. 
the courts of appeals strongly support the request for  funding related to the acquisition of a new appellate case management system to replace the current system known 
as TAMES as well as a case-level data system. 

If the Legislature appropriates a cost-of-living increase to state employees. the courts of appeals request that all court employees be included in any such cost-of-living 
increase. 

Finally. the courts of appeals wish to express appreciation to and support for the Judicial Compensation Commission and the Legislature ·s efforts to strengthen the 
justice system by increasing judicial salaries to attract and retain a strong judiciary.  The courts of appeals request the Legislature implement the Judicial Compensation 
Commission's recommendations for an increase in judicial compensation. 

Note: on Appropriated Receipts  At the direction of the LBB & Governor's Office. this Court has included appropriated receipts in the amount of $32.0000 reflecting 
reimbursement for copies of opinions and other court documents.  These amounts are merely an  offset for additional expenses incurred by the Court and do not constitute 
additional funds available for general expenditures for the Court.  The amount can vary significantly from year to year

The Fifth Court of Appeals was created in  1893 pursuant to authority granted by Article V Section 6. Texas Constitution. This Court has intermediate appellate jurisdiction of 
civil and criminal cases appealed from  lower couns: in  civil cases where judgments rendered exceed $100. exclusive of costs. and other civil proceedings as provided by law: 
in criminal cases of varying types but excluding post-conviction writs of habeas corpus and cases in which the death penalty has been imposed.  The Fifth Court of Appeals 
has jurisdiction in six counties: Collin. Dallas.  Hunt. Grayson. Kaufman. and Rockwall. 

EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS  IMPACTING STRATEGY: 

Courts of appeals. by nature. are small agencies with highly specialized staff.  The main factor driving this strategy is the need to attract and retain experienced legal staff. 
and highly-trained. knowledgeable support staff in order to process and dispose of an increasing caseload in a timely and efficient manner.

STRATEGY DESCRIPTION ANDJtrSTIFICATION: 

HB 2382 of the 86th Legislature established current judicial salaries and created separate appropriations for appellate justice salaries. As a  result of this legislation. Strategy 
A.1.2. Appellate Justice Salaries was created and holds the estimated. non-transferable judicial salary funds for the Court.  Appropriated funds in Strategy A.1.2. cannot be 
spent for any other purpose outside of judicial salaries and benefits. 

EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS  IMPACTING STRATEGY: 

Judicial salaries are controlled by statutory authority and cannot be reduced without amendments to statute.  Funding needs for Strategy A.1.2. are difficult to forecast due 
to the nature of judicial service. Retirements. resignations. election results. and deaths all  impact the funding needed to meet judicial salary requirements at any given time. 
Therefore. the funding needed for Strategy A.1.2. is anticipated to fluctuate over the course of the biennium.

DESCRIPTION/ JUSTIFICATION: 
Attorneys and staff of the courts of appeals have been impacted in many ways by increasing costs due to inflation. The impact has been devastating for many because the 
State has not given them a meaningful raise in a significant period of time. Their buying power for goods and services has diminished and. at some courts. has resulted in 
attrition by those seeking higher-paying jobs.  If salaries are not increased. the courts risk losing more personnel that will be costly to replace.  Training takes time and will 
impact the ability of the courts to meet the current and expected demands as we navigate the post-pandemic surge. 
On May 4. 2022. the Council of Chiefs submitted written testimony to the Senate Committee on  Finance comprised of testimonials from court personnel describing personal 
experiences with rising costs. The Council asks for consideration of this testimony. 
The courts of appeals join in the judiciary-wide inflation relief for non-judicial employees sought by Article IV courts and agencies. Respectfully. a ten percent ( 10%) increase 
on the budget model salaries is sought to help absorb the impact of inflation.  To maintain the Similar Funding for Same-Sized Courts model that has worked exceptionally well 
for years. the  requested percentage must be based on the budget model salaries. This exceptional item is not duplicative of exceptional item  1.  which does not include an 
adjustment for the inflation that is expected to persist for some time to come. 

EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS: 

Inflation is diminishing the buying power of attorneys and staff. Many are struggling to pay mortgages. rent and other items necessary for their livelihood.  A ten percent 
( I 0%) increase on the budget model salaries is sought to offset the current impact of inflation. diminish the effect of future inflation. and to permit the courts of appeals to pay 
attorneys and staff competitive salaries that will help them in the event of a recession .

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
