In 2004, the Appellate Section of the State Bar of Texas and the Courts of Appeals worked together to identify key information needed by appellate 
attorneys and pro se litigants to practice effectively before the court.  To assist the court in this effort, the Appellate Section collected and formatted 
the relevant information and published it in the Appellate Advocate in February 2005.  The court intends to keep the information current for the use 
of persons with matters before the court.

Filing Instructions 
 

1.  All attorneys are required to file all documents (except a document submitted under seal or subject to a motion to seal) with the Court through the 

efiletexas.gov electronic filing system. Persons not represented by an attorney are encouraged to e-file documents; however, e-filing is not 
required.  Documents e-filed by a party electronically with the Third Court of Appeals must conform to Rule 9 of the Texas Rules of Appellate 
Procedure.  In the Third Court of Appeals, an e-filer is not required to file any paper copies of an e-filed document unless specifically requested 
by the Court.   

2.  If a party not represented by counsel opts not to e-file a document and to file the document in paper form instead, the original document filed with 
the Court must be in the form provided by Rule 9.4 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure. However, the document must be unbound and 
one-sided and contain no hard covers, tabs, or any other item that would impede the scanning of the document. In lieu of tabs, separator pages 
with the title of the item immediately following should be used. A filer need only file the original document unless specifically requested by the 
Court.   

3.  All documents submitted to the Court must be redacted in compliance with Rule 9.8, 9.9, and 9.10 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure. E-

HOW HANDLED 
All documents submitted to the Court must be redacted 
in compliance with TRAPs 9.8, 9.9, and 9.10.  E-filed 
briefs must follow the Redaction Guidelines found on 
the Supreme Court's website.   

COURT'S PARTICULAR PRACTICES 
Parties seeking a copy of any electronic record may send 
an email to recordrequest@txcourts.gov.  Attorneys may 
receive the record by Microsoft OneDrive or, if small 
enough, the clerk’s office may email the file. 

SPECIAL NOTES 
An e-filed document must 
include the e-filer's email 
address, in addition to any 
other information required 
by the Texas Rules of 
Appellate Procedure.

through the efiletexas.gov 
electronic filing system. 
Persons not represented

Agreed motions will be acted on as soon as practicable, so 
a conspicuous indication that a motion is agreed to or 
unopposed by the other side helps expedite the motion. 
Motions for extension of time to file a brief are routinely 
granted provided that the time requested does not exceed 
sixty (60) days total. Such motions are handled by the 
clerk's office. 
Appellees’ briefs are to be filed within thirty days of 
appellant’s briefs; or within twenty days in an accelerated 
appeal. Appellants’ reply briefs are due twenty days after 
the filing of appellees’ briefs. If a brief cannot be filed 
within the dates prescribed by the appellate rules, a motion 
for extension of time must be filed, even for appellee’s 
briefs. All post-submission briefs, including letter briefs, 
with the exception of those requested by the Court in oral 
argument, must be accompanied by a separate motion for 
leave to file except for an appellant’s reply brief tendered 
within the time set by the rules. 

he Court currently has no preferred practice regarding 

cross-appeals. Motions asking the Court to consider a 
combined appellee’s/cross-appellant’s brief are consider on 
a case-by-case basis. Practitioners should address the new 
word-count limits in such motions. 
The Court sits in two panels. For oral argument, the Chief 
Justice always sits on the morning panel; the senior Justice 
always sits on the afternoon panel. The other four Justices 
rotate between the two panels. Panels change every six 
months, in January and July. 
The Court does not automatically honor requests for oral 
argument.  The Court follows TRAP 39.1 in determining 
whether to allow oral argument.  As a general rule, parties 
are allocated twenty minutes per side.  

  T

  T

SPECIAL NOTES 
Under TRAP 35.3(c), each 
extension granted may not 
exceed 30 days in regular 
appeals and 10 days in 
accelerated appeals. 

n parental termination and 
child protection cases, 
extensions may not exceed 
30 days total and may not 
be granted in all appeals. 
TRAP 28.4(b)(2). 
 
 

COURT'S PARTICULAR PRACTICES 
Most records are received in electronic form. The clerk’s 
office converts any paper records received into searchable 
PDFs and generally makes them available to the parties. 

he handling of sealed records will depend on the case and 
the language of the sealing order. Some sealed documents 
are received in electronic form and some in paper form. 
Counsel should contact the clerk’s office to determine 
what will be required to obtain access. 

HOW HANDLED 
The clerk’s office handles initial extension requests up 
to 60 days. Additional extensions or extensions for 
longer than a total of 60 days are submitted to 
chambers for an order. 

ll motions to extend in parental termination and child 

protection cases are submitted to chambers for an 
order. 

  A

WHAT AND HOW TO FILE 
Due dates are posted on the 
Court’s website. 
  
Motions to extend are filed 
by clerks and reporters 
directly with the court.  

PROCEDURE 
Records 
 

Motions 

See E-filing. 

Briefs 

See E-filing. 

Motions filed before the appeal is submitted are 
assigned to the justice to whom the case was randomly 
assigned on filing. Motions filed after the case is 
submitted to a panel are assigned to that panel. There is 
no set schedule for acting on motions. 

Case 
Assignment 

Cases are assigned 
randomly to a judge upon 
filing. 

Oral Argument 

 

The Court prefers that oral argument be requested in 
the manner prescribed by the appellate rules.

HOW HANDLED 
 

Opinions 

 

Motions for 
Rehearing 

See E-filing. 

Original 
Proceedings 

See E-filing. 

Clerks and staff attorneys participate in conferences. 
Occasionally, a Justice will request a pre-submission 
memorandum. The notice of submission includes the 
date the case will be submitted and the names of the 
Justices on the panel. The Court sends this notice 
approximately not less than 21 days before submission. 
 
Notices for rehearing and motions for rehearing en 
banc go to the entire Court. In both cases the author 
makes a report and recommendation.  

Requests for emergency relief are given immediate 
attention; it assists the Court if the request for 
emergency relief is conspicuous. Original proceedings 
are given prompt, but not necessarily immediate 
attention.  

COURT'S PARTICULAR PRACTICES 
The Justices confer immediately after oral argument. The 
Justices reach a tentative consensus regarding each case at 
the post-argument conference. A final decision is not made 
until the draft opinion circulates.  The Justices generally do 
not confer regarding unargued cases until the draft opinion 
circulates. 
Draft opinions are circulated to all judges and all attorneys. 
The Court releases opinions daily. 

SPECIAL NOTES 
 

 

 

 

Motions for rehearing are distributed for review to the 
panel that decided the case; motions for rehearing en banc 
are distributed to the entire court. In both cases, the judge 
who authored the opinion makes a report and 
recommendation for the disposition of the motion.  
Original proceedings are assigned to individual justices on 
a rotating basis. There is no set original proceeding panel. 
The justice to whom the proceeding is assigned assembles 
a panel of three judges for that proceeding; the panel may 
or may not coincide with that judge’s regularly assigned 
panel. The Court will set an original proceeding for oral 
argument according to the same general criteria applied to 
other cases. 

The Court uses Lexis and Westlaw.  
With respect to the United States Supreme Court cites, use U.S. and/or L.Ed.  
All attorneys are required to file all documents (except a document submitted under seal or subject to a motion to seal) with the Court through the efiletexas.gov electronic filing system.  
Persons not represented by an attorney are encouraged to e-file documents; however, e-filing is not required.  
The Court does not accept email or fax filing.   
The Court makes its orders available electronically.  
The Court records oral arguments. Recordings are posted on the Court’s website. 

The Court no longer has a mediation referral program.  

Appeal: $205  
Petition for permissive appeal: $205 (no additional fee if petition is granted)  
Original Proceeding: $155  
Motions for Rehearing: $15; all other motions are $10  
Exhibits tendered for oral argument: $25

Filing outside office hours should be arranged in advance with the Clerk.  
A summary of the Court's operating procedures is available at the Court’s website: “Practice Before the Court of Appeals for the Third District of Texas.”  
The Court estimates that approximately 80% of its decisions are memorandum opinions.  
The Court is participating with the State Bar of Texas Appellate Section Pro Bono Committee in a Pro Bono Program to place a limited number of civil appeals with pro bono appellate 
counsel.  
The best way to bring emergency matters to the Court’s attention is to use the correct document classification when efiling and contact the clerk’s office prior to filing.
