to  the  responsibility imposed on the trial court in Rule 35.3(c),

file the reporter’s record arises under Rule 35.3(b), the trial court 
must  direct  the  official  or  deputy  reporter  to  immediately 
commence the preparation of the reporter’s record. The trial court 
must arrange for a substitute reporter, if necessary.  

Extension of Time.  The appellate court may grant an extension

flight from the courtroom.  

b) 

A  party  may  request  an  opportunity  to  be  heard  on  the  necessity  of
