NCSC TX District and County Court Judge Instructions 12.23.22 

OVERVIEW 

The purpose of the Texas District and County Court Workload Study is to quantify the amount of time 
it takes Texas Judges to process cases, from initial filing to disposition.  The study is designed to 
measure the total amount of judge time currently spent in the daily operations of the District and 
County Court, including case-related and non-case related (general administration) work regardless of 
whether the activity occurs in the courtroom, chambers, or even off court premises. 

ll judges listed below are considered primary participants and are asked to participate in the time 
study.  It is critical that all participants record their time comprehensively, accurately and consistently 
according to the directions outlined in these instructions. 

rimary participants are project participants who are expected to record all work conducted throughout 

the time study period.  No other persons are expected to participate in this study. 
 

Primary Participants 

District Court Judges 

County Courts of Law Judges 

Associate Judges 

Senior Judges (w/ standing dockets only) 

Magistrates 

 

Data Collection Period: January 23 – February 26, 2023.  All judges will enter their work-related 
activity data by case type into a database set up by the National Center for State Courts (NCSC), with 
whom the Texas Office of Court Administration (OCA) contracted to assist in the judicial weighted 
workload study.   

uring the study period, when judges are involved in case-related activities, they will classify their 
work time by case type and the relative case-related activity or judges will record their time by a non-
case-related work activity such as general legal research or time spent in meetings.  

ase Types.  It is particularly important that case processing activities conducted during the survey 
period be identified correctly by the case type.  The workload values (i.e., the average time spent by 
judges on each case type) developed through this study will be less accurate if cases are misclassified 
during the time study.  Appendix A displays a list of case types identified for inclusion in this study.  
The Texas Courts Judicial Workload Assessment Advisory Committee confirmed the case types during 
a meeting held December 13, 2022.   

ase-Related Activity Types.  Appendix B displays a list of the case-related activities to be used in 

this study.   

 

Non-Case-Related Activity Types.  Judges will record their time per the list of non-case-related 
activities in Appendix C, when involved in activities that are not directly related to a particular 
case.  Examples of court-related administraton include non-case-related administration, general legal 
research judicial education and training, travel, committees, meetings & related work, education, and 
other activities that are pertinent but not related to case processing

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 

1.  First go https://txdistrictjudges2023.ncscworkload.org/ and click “Login” in the top right corner. 

 

2.  Once on the login screen, enter your email address and the password provided. 

  
You will receive an email from ncscworkload.org inviting you to join the project.  You also 
will be provided a password which will allow you access to the data collection tool.  If you 
desire, you can create a preferred password.  Click on the Help Request link and an electronic 
form will be sent to you per your request. 

3.  Record ALL work-related activity, identifying non-case-related activity OR the case type and case-

specific-activity. 

.  Participants should use the Daily Time Log (located in Appendix D), to manually record all work 
time throughout the workday, including any leave or sick time. This information can then be easily 
entered onto the internet-based data collection tool.  We recommend printing several copies at a 
time, so you are always prepared to record your time.   

At the end of each workday, participants should enter their data from the daily time log into the 
electronic data collection form. The electronic data collection tool is located on the Internet at: 
https://txdistrictjudges2023.ncscworkload.org/. Note:  If you determine that you have forgotten 
to enter work from the previous day, simply go into the website, select the correct date (which 
can be historical) and add the correct data. 
 

5.  Participants should reserve approximately 10 minutes each day to enter and submit their daily 

information into the secure database.  Note that there is a place to record time spent tracking and 
entering your data. 

6.  If you find that an error has been made in any entry that appears in your Entries for the day or your 
History, please click on the icon under the Action box to either delete or edit the line of data that is 
incorrect.  

You will be responsible for reviewing, editing, deleting and/correcting your data! 

OTE: It is important that participants record and report all court-related work activity during the 
study period, even if the work occurs during the early morning, evenings or on weekends.  Questions 
regarding an activity that may be going unrecorded, or that may be difficult to record, should be 
directed to the time study Help Request link in the on-line data entry website.

GENERAL REPORTING PRACTICES 

.  Waiting Time.  If you are on the bench waiting for attorneys or parties, and you are engaged in no 

other activity, include the waiting time in the relevant court activity. If, while waiting, you engage in 
other activities (such as doing legal research or working on an opinion), then record the time for those 
activities in which you engaged, and NOT as waiting time. 

.  Multiple Activities on a Single Case Type.  When multiple activities occur on a single case type, and 

you cannot discern the discreet amount of time on each activity, divide the time using your best 
estimate and create a separate entry for each activity. 

.  Multiple Cases Heard Simultaneously or in a Block.  Time on multiple cases with different case 
types should be disaggregated as much as possible. For example, you may be in the courtroom on a 
pretrial calendar with a combination of criminal case types (e.g., class 1 felony, other criminal). If 
practicable, sort cases by case type prior to starting the calendar and record the time for each group of 
case types. If this is not possible, estimate the breakdown of cases (e.g., eighty percent class I felony 
and twenty percent other criminal) and apportion the time accordingly. 

.  Multi-Day Trials.  A multi-day trial should have an entry for each day. For instance, if a trial lasted 

three days, then, there would be three separate entries into the data collection instrument. The total time 
for a day may vary. 

.  Double Counting of Time.  It is not permissible to "double count" your time in this study.  The 

Committee recognizes that you are frequently required to rapidly toggle between tasks; however, for the 
purposes of this study double counting is not permissible. 

.  Interruptions.  Interruptions such as telephone calls, questions, refilling a coffee cup, etc., should not 

be reported separately if the duration is less than 5 minutes. 

.  Holidays.  A holiday is recorded as eight hours. If you perform court-related work during a holiday, 
hours worked should be recorded as outlined in these instructions. If additional days are taken during 
the time study period for sick, vacation or other leave, record that as non-case specific time (vacation/ 
sick or other leave). 
 

8.  Daily Time Log. The Daily Time Log is a tool you can use to manually record your time as you 

progress through your workday.  All case types and activities both case-related and non-case-related are 
listed and coded.  Record the case type code and activity code in the section below with the time spent 
on each activity.  The ‘tick mark’ section is there to use to expedite the time keeping process.  Pre-fill in 
the case types and activities, if known, and simply make a tick mark to represent a measure of time that 
you determine.  When completed simply add up the tick marks and record your time into the electronic 
data collection instrument.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
