Service Level Exceptions 

In addition to Planned Downtime, Client Error Incidents, and Force Majeure 
Events (as defined under the Agreement), the Contractor shall not be responsible 
for a failure to meet any SLR to the extent that such failure is directly caused by 
any of the following: 

  Service outages and missed SLRs due to system components owned or 

controlled by OCA. OCA will conduct a Root Cause Analysis to determine 
reasons for outages. 

  Service outages and missed SLRs due to system components owned or

writing that the implementation of such Change Request would result in 
such failure to meet the SLR. 

2.4 

Changed Service Level Requirements 

The Parties may agree to add or otherwise make changes to the SLR in 
accordance with the Agreement, including but not limited to Section 5.1 
(Performance and Service Levels), Section 19.8 (Lack of Sufficient Funds or 
Statutory Authority) and, if applicable, Section 4.4 (Change Request). In respect 
of a New Service to be added the Parties will discuss and agree upon the 
following modifications: 

  Status of the New Service as an SLR; 

  Measurement tools and the methods of calculation to be used for 

monitoring and reporting on such New Service; and 

  SLRs applicable to such New Service.

The Contractor will provide reports to OCA regarding their compliance with the 
SLRs. 

The Contractor will measure all data reasonably required by OCA to determine 

SLRs set out in Attachment 3-1: Service Level Requirements. Without limiting the 
foregoing, the Contractor will keep complete and accurate logs of all such data 
for no less than one year from the availability of the applicable report.  

The Contractor will provide OCA with performance monitoring reports in a Web-
based dashboard format that depict the current conditions across the eFileTexas 
2.0 solution and access to historical data and trends. Performance monitoring 
reports shall provide both top-level views and contextual drilldowns, as well as 
raw data access for a broad spectrum of users and transactions.  

A.  On or before the 10th calendar day of each calendar month or as otherwise 
requested by OCA, Contractor will deliver a performance measurement 
Report to OCA containing: 

i. 

For each measured SLR and with respect to the immediately preceding 
calendar month, all data relating to the provision of the Service during the 
applicable month; 

ii. 

For each measured SLR during the immediately preceding calendar 

SLRs for such Service during the applicable month; 

iii.  Details of any Planned Downtime which the Contractor believes has 

impacted the measured Services during the applicable month; and 

iv. 

Any other information reasonably requested by OCA from time to time. 

For any SLRs with a measurement period of longer than a month, the provision 
of (ii) above shall apply for the calendar month on which the final date of the 
measurement period for such SLR falls.

Service Level Monitoring and Measurement 

The Contractor will continuously monitor the eFileTexas 2.0 solution and the 
Services in order to identify, report, and correct SLR Failures and to ensure that the 
Contractor is meeting or exceeding the SLRs as required herein.  

3.1 

Measurement Reporting  

   

Exhibit 3 to OCA MSA No. 212-20-0385 

iii.  Details of any measured SLRs that were supposed to be performed 

during the applicable day that were not fully performed as required; and 

iv.  Details of any measured SLRs that were supposed to have been 

performed during a previous day but were not fully performed as required 
on that day, and the status of such measured Services.  

As required, the Contractor will provide OCA with an electronic feed of all data   
in a form and format that will enable OCA to use, copy, sort, manipulate, modify, 
analyze, extract, translate, and load the data without a requirement that OCA 
undertake modifications to the data or the form or format in which it was 
delivered in order to do so, or in any other form and format mutually agreed to by 
the Parties. 

In generating data for dashboard reports provided by the Contractor, the 
Contractor will use, for each SLR, the measurement tools and methodologies 
needed to adequately measure each Service Level, or such other means as 
h the 

SLRs. 

Contractor will also provide an online portal providing OCA with access to all the 
SLR data as described in this section.  

3.2 

Defect Priority Levels  

For both Implementation and Production Services, Contractor will classify 
Defects into the Priority Levels set forth in the table below.  The reported incident 
will be considered a Defect at the time it is confirmed by Contractor; provided, 
however, Contractor shall not unreasonably delay confirmation of a Defect, 
including its classification.  

   

Priority 
Level 

1 
Critical 

2 
High 

3  
Medium 

4  
Low 

 

 

 

Characteristics of Defects 

Defect that causes (a) complete application failure or application unavailability; (b) application 

multiple essential system functions. 

Defect that causes (a) repeated, consistent failure of essential functionality affecting more than one 
user or (b) loss or corruption of data. 

Priority Level 1 Defect with an existing circumvention procedure, or a Priority Level 2 Defect that 
affects only one user or for which there is an existing circumvention procedure. 

Defect that causes failure of non-essential functionality or a cosmetic or other issue that does not 
qualify as any other Priority Level. 

 

  5

Critical SLRs and Monitored SLRs set forth in this SLA identify key performance 
 

Contractor shall reimburse OCA for failure to achieve any Critical SLR. Monitored 
SLRs are not subject to Service Level Reimbursements but are monitored against 
key performance indicators (KPIs) for continuous improvement purposes.  

OCA has designated nine (9) Critical SLRs as set forth in Attachment 3-1. If 
Contractor fails to achieve the performance target of any Monitored SLRs in any two 

such Monitored SLR shall become a Critical SLR and shall remain a Critical SLR 
until the Contractor has achieved the Performance Targets for such SLR for two 
consecutive measurement periods, then such Critical SLR shall automatically revert 
to a Monitored SLR.  

Regardless of SLR identification (Critical SLR or Monitored SLR), the Contractor 
shall perform a Root Cause Analysis in accordance with Section 5.3 (Service 
Problem Analysis) of the Agreement for any failure to attain an SLR. The Root 
Cause Analysis will include actions and target completion dates to prevent 
recurrence of the failure. 

By mutual written agreement of Contractor and OCA, new SLRs may be added to 
replace or augment existing SLRs with the objective of reflecting changing or new 
requirements and improvements. Where appropriate, OCA expects to review SLRs 
at least each Contract Year and OCA and Contractor may adjust the SLRs as 
needed. OCA and the Contractor acknowledge that Critical SLRs have been set to 

Reimbursements when a Critical SLR is missed as follows: 

Except as specified in a Critical SLR included in Attachment 3-1, for each Critical 
SLR Failure during the same Measurement Period, 2.5% of the quarterly Charges 
will be reimbursed to OCA as Service Level Reimbursements on the next invoice.  

The maximum amount of Service Level Reimbursement in any Contract Year shall 
not exceed 18% of the Charges applicable to such Contract Year.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
