      <pre>Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 
 
Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 
 

APPEAL NO.: 

15-015 

ESPONDENT: 

City of Joshua Municipal Court 

ATE: 

 

November 30, 2015 

 

 

 

PECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge Stephen B. Ables, Chairman; Judge Mary Murphy; Judge 
Olen Underwood; Judge Billy Ray Stubblefield; Judge Kelly G. 
Moore  

Petitioner submitted three requests for records to the City of Joshua (the “City”) on a form 
created by the City for records requests.  Two of the requests were for copies of any visual or audio 
recordings taken via equipment affixed to the walls of the city hall building or worn by any person, 
including law enforcement, on specific days during specific hours.  The City of Joshua Municipal 
Court, not the City, denied Petitioner’s request for records claiming they are exempt from disclosure 
under Rule 12.5(b), Security Plans, 12.5(c), Personnel Information, 12.5(f), Internal Deliberations 
on Court or Judicial Matters, and 12.5(j)(1), Litigation or Settlement Negotiations.  Respondent also 
claimed that releasing the records would impede the routine operations of the court by disclosing 
non-public areas of the court and impede the bailiffs from discharging their duties.  Petitioner then 
filed this appeal.1 

etitioner alleges that the City denied her request “by attempting to classify them as court 
records.”  Court records are subject to Rule 12 if they are “judicial records.”  Rule 12.2(d) defines 
judicial records, in pertinent part, as “records made or maintained by or for a court or judicial agency 
in its regular course of business but not pertaining to its adjudicative function.”  Though video 
recordings made on a body camera worn by a law enforcement officer assigned to a court as its 
bailiff are not ordinarily records “made for or by a court” and the process of recording via a body 
camera may not ordinarily be considered part of the court’s “regular course of business,” there may 
be instances2 in which these recordings may be considered records maintained by or for court in its 
regular course of business.  Accordingly, we will consider this appeal.3  

In its response to this appeal, Respondent argues that the video recordings requested by 

 
Petitioner are exempt under Rule 12.5(b) which reads: 

  P

 

(b) Security Plans. Any record, including a security plan or code, the release 
of  which  would  jeopardize  the  security  of  an  individual  against  physical 
injury  or  jeopardize  information  or  property  against  theft,  tampering, 

                                                 
1 The information requested by Petitioner in her third request has been provided to her; therefore, this decision 
addresses only the denial of the audio/visual recording requested by Petitioner. 
2 One example would be in instances where a bailiff is a court employee employed by the court rather than a law 
enforcement officer assigned by the officer’s employing law enforcement agency to assist the court as a bailiff or if 
the court regularly maintains copies of the recordings or has an agreement with the law enforcement agency that 
records created by the bailiff while assigned to the court are the court’s records.   
3 If these records were not “judicial records” we would be without authority to consider this appeal.

improper use, illegal disclosure, trespass, unauthorized access, or physical 
injury. 
 

 
Respondent indicates that the requested video recordings “include footage of ‘non-public, 
secure areas of the Court.’”  We agree that the release of video recordings of the non-public areas of 
the court’s offices could jeopardize the security of an individual against physical injury or jeopardize 
information or property against trespass or unauthorized access and agree that those portions of the 
video recording may be withheld.  However, a record is not exempt in its entirety because portions 
of it are exempt from disclosure.  The proper response is to redact exempt information from the 
record before providing a copy to the requestor.  See Rule 12.6(d) and Rule 12 Decision No. 11-009. 
A video recording of public areas outside the court’s offices or courtroom do not necessarily pose a 
risk to the security of the court or its personnel and may be subject to disclosure.  Accordingly, we 
decide that Respondent should redact the portions of the video recording that contain footage of the 
non-public areas of the building and release the remainder of the recording.  If Respondent believes 
that the portions of the video of the non-public areas also pose a threat to security and should also be 
exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5(b), we give Respondent leave to submit the video recording 
for our in camera review along with the reasons for maintaining that the portions of the video of the 
public areas of city hall are also exempt under Rule 12.5(b).   

Because Petitioner during the appeal process limited her request to the portions of the video 
recording of the public areas of the building, the Rule 12.5(c), Personnel Information and Rule 
12.5(f), Internal Deliberations on Court or Judicial Matters exemptions do not apply to the record at 
issue in this appeal.  Respondent also raised Rule 12.5(j)(1), Litigation or Settlement Negotiations, 
as a reason to withhold the requested record. However, we are not aware of any pending litigation 
and  Respondent  did  not  provide  this  committee  with  any  information  that  would  indicate  that 
litigation  involving  the  court  regarding  this  matter  is  pending  or  anticipated.  Therefore,  this 
exemption does not apply to the records at issue in this appeal either. 

In  summary,  Respondent  should  redact  the  portions  of  the  video  recording  that  contain 
footage  of  the  non-public  areas  of  the  building  and  release  the  remainder  of  the  recording.    If 
Respondent believes that the portions of the video of the non-public areas also pose a threat to 
security and should be exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5(b), Respondent may submit  the 
video recording for our in camera review as discussed above.
