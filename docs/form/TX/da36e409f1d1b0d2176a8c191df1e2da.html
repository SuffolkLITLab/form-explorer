Here are some examples of what this section means: 
 

• 

• 

• 

• 

If all your children are living and they do not have any children, then each of your 
children gets an equal amount of your property and money that you do not give as 
a specific gift. 
If all your children are living and they have their own children, then each of your 
children gets an equal amount of your property and money that you do not give as 
a specific gift. Your grandchildren do not get your property and money unless you 
give them a specific gift. 
If you have one living child and one deceased child who has a living child, then your 
living child gets a half of your property and money that you did not give as a specific 
gift. The other half will go to the living child of your deceased child. 
If you have one living child and one deceased child who has two living children, 
then your living child gets a half of your property and money that you did not give 
as a specific gift. The living children of your deceased child each get a quarter of the 
property and money that you did not give as a specific gift. 

f you need more information or need help visit http://www.txcourts.gov/programs-
services/legal-aid or call one of the numbers on page 2 of this Will Form.

Section 4. Independent Executor 

In Section 4, you choose the person you want to be in charge of handing out your property 
and money after you die. That person is called the “Independent Executor,” and they make 
sure your wishes in your Will are followed to the best of their ability. 

our Independent Executor must be 18 years old or older and cannot be a convicted felon. 
Your Independent Executor can be one of your adult children or grandchildren, or someone 
else receiving a gift in your Will. Often, others name their adult child or grandchild, parent, 
sibling, or other trusted person as their Independent Executor. 

our choice of Independent Executor must be approved by the court before they can act in 
that role. After appointment, the court generally does not supervise the Independent 
Executor. 

f you use this Will Form, you can only have one Independent Executor in charge at a time. 
But it is best to name a second and third choice in case someone you name cannot serve as 
Independent Executor. 

ome of the Subsections below (4.2, 4.3, 4.4) have no blanks to fill in. These Subsections 
are needed for legal reasons. Do not add, change, or delete anything from these 
Subsections.

Now that you are done completing and signing your Will, you should: 

 

•  Staple your Will and do not unstaple it.  
•  Make as many copies of your Will as you want after stapling the original. Do not 

take out the staples to copy. 

•  Keep your original signed Will in a safe place.  
•  Tell the person you have chosen to be your Independent Executor that you have a 

Will and where the original Will is located.  

hether you tell any of your children, grandchildren, or others receiving gifts in your Will is 

up to you.

hen you die, your original Will must be probated to have any effect. “Probate” means to 

establish that your Will is valid in court. There is a 4-year deadline from the date of your 
death to probate the Will. 
 
If your situation changes (for example, you get married or your child dies), you may need to 
make a new Will. If you make any changes to your Will after you sign it, those changes are 
not valid. If you want to change anything, rip your Will up and start over with a new one. 

Go check your retirement accounts, bank accounts, and insurance plans to see if you have 
named someone (called a “beneficiary”) to receive the benefits of those accounts or 
insurance plans when you die. If you have filled out something called a “Transfer on Death 
Deed” or a “Vehicle Transfer on Death,” check them too. Your new Will does not change 
the beneficiary of those accounts, insurance plans, or deeds. Anyone you’ve named as a 
beneficiary of those accounts, insurance plans, or deeds will receive their benefits, even if 
your Will names someone different.

All to surviving 
spouse, except 
for any specific 
gifts.

2.   One share will be created for each child of mine who has not survived me 

but who has children who survive me. 
 

Each surviving child will take one share and the share of each deceased child will

Choice #2 
Nothing to 
surviving 
spouse, except 
for any specific 
gifts. 
 

Even if my spouse survives me, I give everything I own, except for any specific 
gifts to my spouse or another person, to my children.

will be divided among that deceased child’s children.

give your interest in all the items inside your home to your spouse or to one or more 
specific child, grandchild, or other person (like your parent or sibling).

Subsection 3.2 and Subsection 3.3 if you want to give someone a particular item 
(Subsection 3.3) but still give the bulk of your personal and household items to another 
person (Subsection 3.2). Section 2 will apply to any personal or household items you do 
not give under Subsection 3.2 or Subsection 3.3.

tools, garden equipment, china, silver, works of art, jewelry, clothes, and any other similar 
items. 

 

xcept for any specific gifts I make in Subsection 3.3 “Giving Specific Items or Property,” I give all of 
my interest in my personal and household items in equal shares to the following person or people 
who  survive  me.  If  none  of  these  people  survives  me,  my  interest  in  these  items  will  pass  under 
Section 2 “Everything I Own, Except for Specific Gifts.” My interest in these items shall be divided 
among them as they agree. If they cannot agree, the Executor will decide.

Now that you are done completing and signing your Will, you should: 

 

•  Staple your Will and do not unstaple it.  
•  Make as many copies of your Will as you want after stapling the original. Do not 

take out the staples to copy. 

•  Keep your original signed Will in a safe place.  
•  Tell the person you have chosen to be your Independent Executor that you have a 

Will and where the original Will is located.  

hether you tell any of your spouse, children, grandchildren, or others receiving gifts in 

your Will is up to you. 

hen you die, your original Will must be probated to have any effect. “Probate” means to 

establish that your Will is valid in court. There is a 4-year deadline from the date of your 
death to probate the Will.

Go check your retirement accounts, bank accounts, and insurance plans to see if you have 
named someone (called a “beneficiary”) to receive the benefits of those accounts or 
insurance plans when you die. If you have filled out something called a “Transfer on Death 
Deed” or a “Vehicle Transfer on Death,” check them too. Your new Will does not change 
the beneficiary of those accounts, insurance plans, or deeds. Anyone you’ve named as a 
beneficiary of those accounts, insurance plans, or deeds will receive their benefits, even if 
your Will names someone different. 
 
If your situation changes (for example you get divorced, your spouse dies, or your child 
dies), you may need to make a new Will. If you make any changes to your Will after you 
sign it, those changes are not valid. If you want to change anything, rip your Will up and 
start over with a new one.

Section 4. Independent Executor 

In Section 4, you choose the person you want to be in charge of handing out your property 
and money after you die. That person is called the “Independent Executor,” and they make 
sure your wishes in your Will are followed to the best of their ability. 

our Independent Executor must be 18 years old or older and cannot be a convicted felon. 
Your Independent Executor can be one of your parents, siblings, or someone else receiving 
a gift in your Will. Often, others name their parent, sibling, or other trusted person as their 
Independent Executor. 

our choice of Independent Executor must be approved by the court before they can act in 
that role. After appointment, the court generally does not supervise the Independent 
Executor. 

f you use this Will Form, you can only have one Independent Executor in charge at a time. 
But it is best to name a second and third choice in case someone you name cannot serve as 
Independent Executor. 

ome of the Subsections below (4.2, 4.3, 4.4) have no blanks to fill in. These Subsections 
are needed for legal reasons. Do not add, change, or delete anything from these 
Subsections.

•  Make as many copies of your Will as you want after stapling the original. Do not 

take out the staples to copy. 

•  Keep your original signed Will in a safe place.  
•  Tell the person you have chosen to be your Independent Executor that you have a 

Will and where the original Will is located.  

hether you tell anyone receiving gifts in your Will is up to you.

death to probate the Will.

Go check your retirement accounts, bank accounts, and insurance plans to see if you have 
named someone (called a “beneficiary”) to receive the benefits of those accounts or 
insurance plans when you die. If you have filled out something called a “Transfer on Death 
Deed” or a “Vehicle Transfer on Death,” check them too. Your new Will does not change 
the beneficiary of those accounts, insurance plans, or deeds. Anyone you’ve named as a 
beneficiary of those accounts, insurance plans, or deeds will receive their benefits, even if 
your Will names someone different. 
 
If your situation changes (for example, you get married or have a child), you may need to 
make a new Will. If you make any changes to your Will after you sign it, those changes are 
not valid. If you want to change anything, rip your Will up and start over with a new one.

Section 3. Specific Gifts 

A “specific gift” is a specific piece of property that you specifically give to a specific person 
like your spouse, a parent, a sibling, or other person. 

ection 3 is optional. You do not have to give a specific gift. You can choose to fill in all, 
some, or none of the below Subsections (3.1, 3.2, and 3.3). Section 2 “Everything I Own, 
Except Specific Gifts” applies to any property that you do not list in Section 3. In other 
words, any property that you do not list in Section 3 goes to your spouse or, if your spouse 
does not survive you, the other person or people you named in Section 2. 

f you want to skip Section 3, cross out all the boxes in Subsections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3. 

You do not have to fill in Subsection 3.1. Complete Subsection 3.1 only if you want to 
specifically give your interest in your home to your spouse or to one or more parent, 
sibling, or other person. If you do not fill in Subsection 3.1, your interest in your home 
goes to your spouse or, if your spouse does not survive you, those you named in Section 
2. 

ubsection 3.1 does not cover your items inside your home. Those are addressed in 
Subsection 3.2 “Giving My Personal and Household Items.” 

f you do not fill in a box, cross it out. 

If you have filled out something called a “Transfer on Death Deed” form, check it. Your new 
Will does not change the beneficiary of this deed, and you may want to change it. 

I give my interest in my home, subject to mortgages and liens, in equal shares to the following person 
or people who survive me. If none of these people survives me, my interest in my home will pass under 
Section 2 “Everything I Own, Except for Specific Gifts.”

•  Staple your Will and do not unstaple it.  
•  Make as many copies of your Will as you want after stapling the original. Do not 

take out the staples to copy. 

•  Keep your original signed Will in a safe place.  
•  Tell the person you have chosen to be your Independent Executor that you have a 

Will and where the original Will is located.  

hether you tell your spouse or other people receiving gifts in your Will is up to you. 

hen you die, your original Will must be probated to have any effect. “Probate” means to 

establish that your Will is valid in court. There is a 4-year deadline from the date of your 
death to probate the Will.

Go check your retirement accounts, bank accounts, and insurance plans to see if you have 
named someone (called a “beneficiary”) to receive the benefits of those accounts or 
insurance plans when you die. If you have filled out something called a “Transfer on Death 
Deed” or a “Vehicle Transfer on Death,” check them too. Your new Will does not change 
the beneficiary of those accounts, insurance plans, or deeds. Anyone you’ve named as a 
beneficiary of those accounts, insurance plans, or deeds will receive their benefits, even if 
your Will names someone different. 
 
If your situation changes (for example, you get divorced, your spouse dies, or you have a 
child), you may need to make a new Will. If you make any changes to your Will after you 
sign it, those changes are not valid. If you want to change anything, rip your Will up and 
start over with a new one.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
