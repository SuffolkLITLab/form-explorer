Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 
 
Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 
 

APPEAL NO.: 

08-006 

ESPONDENT: 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 

 
 
 
 

 

ATE: 

February 2, 2009 

Suzanne Brooks, Judge, Williamson County Court at Law No. 1 
Tim Wright, Judge, Williamson County Court at Law No. 2  
Don Higginbotham, Judge, Williamson County Court at Law No. 3 
John McMaster, Judge, Williamson County Court at Law No. 4 

PECIAL COMMITTEE:  Judge  Dean  Rucker,  Chairman;  Judge  John  Ovard;  Judge  Olen 

Underwood; Judge David Peeples; Judge Jeff Walker 

etitioner requested “any and all letters, memorandums, correspondence, emails, letters and notes to 
and from the Williamson County Attorney and the Williamson County Courts at Law responding to, 
concerning, related to, and/or discussing the May 1, 2008 letter regarding Stephen Ackley addressed 
to Hon. Dan A Gattis, County Judge, and signed by County Court at Law Judges Don Higginbottam 
(sic), Tim Wright, Suzanne Brooks, and John McMaster.”  Judge Higginbotham states that he does 
not have any documents responsive to the request.  Judges Wright, Brooks, and McMaster have 
identified three documents that are responsive to the request but have withheld them claiming that 
they are privileged attorney-client communications under Texas Rule of Evidence 503 and are also 
exempt from disclosure under the provisions of Rules 12.3(a)(4), 12.5(i), 12.5(j), and 12.5(k) of the 
Rules of Judicial Administration.  The documents were provided to us in camera and are judicial 
records as defined by Rule 12.2(d). 

e first address the question of whether the submitted documents are privileged attorney-client 
communications  under  Texas  Rule  of  Evidence  503.    The  attorney-client  privilege  protects 
confidential communications between or among clients, client representatives, lawyers, and lawyer 
representatives that are made to further the rendition of professional legal services.  Tex. R. Evid. 
503(b)(1).  Although the documents submitted are communications from the county attorney to the 
judges, only two of the documents appear to be related to litigation or made for the purpose of 
facilitating  the  rendition  of  professional  legal  services.    We  find  that  these  two  documents  are 
attorney-client communications and are privileged under Texas Rule of Evidence 503(b)(1).  Rule 
12.3(a)(1)(c) provides that Rule 12 does not apply to records that are subject to a rule of evidence.  
Therefore, we can neither grant the appeal from the denial of these two records nor sustain the denial 
of access to them and we need not address whether the other exceptions raised by Respondents 
apply. 

he third document provided by Respondents is a letter from the county attorney to Judges Wright, 
Brooks and McMaster regarding the letter that was submitted by the judges to County Judge Dan

Gattis on May 1, 2008.  It does not discuss or reference ongoing litigation or attempt to render 
professional legal services. Therefore, we find that it is not privileged under Texas Rule of Evidence 
503.  We must next consider whether the other Rule 12 exemptions raised by Respondents apply. 

espondents contend that they may withhold the document under Rules 12.3(a)(4) and 12.3(b).   
These are not exceptions to disclosure; rather they are provisions that make Rule 12 inapplicable to 
certain records and place them outside the jurisdiction of this panel.  We first address Rule 12.3(a)(4) 
which makes Rule 12 inapplicable to records to which access is controlled by Chapter 552 of the 
Government Code, also known as the Public Information Act (PIA), or another statute or provision 
of law.  Respondents contend that the responsive records are exempt from production under Section 
552.103 of the Government Code, the litigation exception of the PIA, and are therefore controlled by 
Chapter 552 of the Government Code and that if Chapter 552 of the Government Code controls them 
they  do  not  have  to  be  released  pursuant  to  Rule  12.3(a)(4).    However,  Chapter  552  of  the 
Government Code specifically excepts the judiciary from the PIA, and therefore makes Section 
552.103 inapplicable to these records. See Sec. 552.103(1)(B), Texas Government Code.  Therefore, 
Rule 12.3(a)(4) does not apply to these records either.  

ection 12.3(b) makes Rule 12 inapplicable to records or information to which Chapter 552 of the 
Government Code is made inapplicable by statute, rule, or other provision of law, other than Section 
552.003(1)(B).  The records at  issue are maintained by the courts and are judicial records.  As 
records of the judiciary they are excepted from Chapter 552 by Section 552.003(1)(B) and, therefore, 
Rule 12.3(b) does not apply to these records. 

espondents also contend that the records may be withheld under Rule 12.5(i) because their release 
would constitute an invasion of the privacy of the judges, court personnel and former employees.  
Rule 12.5(i) exempts from disclosure any record that is confidential or exempt from disclosure under 
a state or federal constitutional provision, statute or common law.  We have reviewed the record to 
determine if its release would constitute an unwarranted governmental interference or intrusion into 
those areas deemed to be within the zones of privacy or constitute the tort of invasion of privacy and 
have found that it would not.  

espondents next contend that the document is exempt under Rule 12.5(j), the litigation exception.  
As  discussed  above,  this  document  does  not  discuss  nor  is  it  related  to  pending  or  anticipated 
litigation.  Therefore, this exception does not apply. 

astly, Respondents contend that the document relates to an investigation of any person’s character 
or conduct and is exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5(k).  Though the document is not solely 
related to an investigation of a person’s character or conduct, some of the information contained in 
the letter refers to a complaint about and the probable investigation of a person’s conduct.  Therefore, 
we find that this information is exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5(k) and should be redacted 
prior to release. 

n summary, we can neither deny nor grant the petition for access to the two documents that have 
been identified as attorney-client privileged by this panel because they are not subject to Rule 12 and 
we grant the petition for access to the third document except for the information determined to be 
related to the investigation of a person’s conduct.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
