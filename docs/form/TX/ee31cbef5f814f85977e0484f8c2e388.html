Second Court of Appeals 
Leave Policy

H:\STANDARD COURT FORMS\HR Forms\Leave Policy.pdf 

 

 
LEAVE POLICY 

   

This  policy  governs  leave  benefits  and  reporting  requirements  for  employees  of  the 
Second Court of Appeals.  The purpose of this policy is to provide clear and objective 
guidelines to establish the circumstances under which a Court employee may be entitled 
to or granted each type of leave provided by chapter 661 of the government code.  Tex. 
Gov’t Code Ann. §§ 661.001–.924 (West 2012 & Supp. 2017).   

ork Hours1 

  W

The  Court’s  office  hours  are  8:00  a.m.  to  5:00  p.m.,  Monday  through  Friday.  
These are also the regular working hours of a full-time employee, unless an alternate 
work schedule is approved by the employee’s supervisor and the Chief Justice in writing 
on the Court’s Employee Modified Work Schedule form, attached as Exhibit A.   

  full-time  employee  must  work  a  40-hour  work  week.    An  employee  must, 
during normal working hours, conduct Court business only at the Court’s offices unless 
he  or  she  is  traveling  on  Court  business  approved  by  his  or  her  supervisor  or  has 
received prior written authorization from the Chief Justice to perform work elsewhere.  
An employee who is exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards 
Act (FLSA) may work from home in accordance with the Court’s Work-From-Home 
Policy and Procedures, attached as Exhibit B. 
 

A  full-time  employee’s  schedule  includes  a  one-hour  lunch  break,  unless  an 
alternate work schedule is approved by the employee’s supervisor and the Chief Justice 
in writing on the Court’s Employee Modified Work Schedule form.  Employees are also 
allowed two paid work breaks each day of up to 15 minutes each.  The Court supports 
the practice of expressing breast milk and makes reasonable accommodations, including 
break time and private space, for the needs of employees who express breast milk.2   

Excessive Absenteeism or Tardiness 

Absenteeism or tardiness is excessive when an employee is unable to perform 
his or her job adequately, or when the normal day-to-day work activities of the office 
are  disrupted  due  to  excessive  and/or  unscheduled  absences  or  tardiness  by  the

employee.  Excessive absenteeism or tardiness may be grounds for disciplinary actions, 
up to and including termination. 
 

An employee who fails to report to or remain at work, or who fails to return to 
work upon expiration of approved leave, may be considered to have abandoned his or 
her  position  with  the  Court.    Such  an  employee  will  be  expected  to  produce  a 
satisfactory  explanation  for  the  unauthorized  absence.    An  employee  who  is  absent 
from work for three or more consecutive business days without contacting his or her 
supervisor will be deemed to have abandoned his or her job at the close of the third 
business day.  Unauthorized absence(s) may be grounds for disciplinary actions, up to 
and including termination.   

Overtime3 

In  accordance  with  state  and  federal  law,  Court  policy  generally  prohibits 
overtime (i.e., more than 40 hours per week) by employees who are not exempt from 
the  overtime provisions of the FLSA:  legal assistants,  deputy clerks, and custodians.  
Nonexempt  employees  seeking  to  work  overtime  must  obtain  the  prior  written 
approval of their immediate supervisor and the Chief Justice on the Court’s Employee 
Overtime Form, attached as Exhibit C.  Nonexempt employees who work overtime 
without obtaining prior written approval may face disciplinary action.   

nder the FLSA, nonexempt employees who work over 40 hours per week are 
entitled to compensation for the excess hours by subsequent time off at 1.5 times the 
hours  worked  or  by  pay  at  1.5  times  salary.    The  State’s  policy  is  to  provide 
compensatory time only, except in exceptional circumstances. Thus, although the Court 
has  and  may  occasionally  allow  overtime  to  be  compensated  monetarily,  its  general 
policy is to provide compensatory time only. 

xempt employees (i.e., Clerk of the Court, accountant, network specialist, and 
all attorneys) are generally ineligible to earn compensatory time for hours worked over 
40 hours per week.  The Chief Justice, in his or her discretion, may authorize exceptions 
to this general policy.  Exceptions must be approved in writing by the Chief Justice in 
advance of the hours worked.

VACATION LEAVE 
 

See Texas Government Code §§ 661.151–.154. 
 

Employees are entitled to paid vacation leave each fiscal year.  Vacation leave 
hours  are  earned  in  accordance  with  the  employee’s  cumulative  years  of  State 
employment.  An employee who does not have credit for prior State employment may 
not take earned vacation leave until he or she has six months of continuous employment 
with the State, although the employee accrues vacation leave during that period.  

Vacation leave should be approved by the employee’s supervisor.  An employee 
should  complete  an  Employee  Absence  Request  form,  attached  as  Exhibit  D,  for 
vacation leave scheduled and approved in advance.  An employee on vacation leave on 
the first day of the month may not take the vacation leave earned for that month until 
the employee has returned to work at least one day.   

Carrying Forward Vacation Leave 

State  employees  are  entitled  to  carry  over  a  limited  amount  of  vacation  leave 
from each fiscal year to the next; unused vacation leave exceeding the limit is converted 
to sick leave.  The amount of hours of vacation leave that each employee may carry 
over is set by statute, depending on the employee’s years of State employment.  Each 
employee of the Court is encouraged to limit his or her carry-over hours to no more 
than 80 hours per fiscal year and to use all accrued vacation leave before his or her last 
day of employment.  If an employee fails to use his or her accrued vacation leave until 
the last days of employment, the Court will be unable to hire a replacement for that 
employee until the amount budgeted for that employee’s position is no longer being 
allocated to that employee’s paid leave.

HOLIDAY COMP LEAVE 
 

See Texas Government Code §§ 662.001–.013. 
 

An employee who is required to work on a national or state holiday (as defined 
in  Gov’t  Code  §  662.003)  that  does  not  fall  on  a  Saturday  or  Sunday  (and  that  the 
applicable General Appropriations Act does not prohibit the Court from observing) is 
entitled to a paid day off during the next 12-month period if the employee is employed 

H:\STANDARD COURT FORMS\HR Forms\Leave Policy.pdf 

3 

 

 

 

 

   

on the day before or after the holiday, or both days.  Employees will rarely, if ever, be 
required to work on holidays other than “skeleton crew” days, i.e., those days on which 
the Court must have at least enough employees present to conduct business as required 
by statute.  An employee may also choose to take paid leave on one of the statutorily 
defined optional holidays in lieu of one of the skeleton crew days falling within the same 
fiscal year as the optional holiday.  The State Auditor’s Office posts holiday schedules 
for the next biennium after the close of each legislative session. 

 
SICK LEAVE 
 

See Texas Government Code § 661.201–.207. 
 

Full-time employees earn eight hours of sick leave per month, beginning with 
the first day of State employment.  Sick leave with pay may be taken when sickness, 
injury, or pregnancy and confinement prevent the employee’s performance of duty or 
when  the  employee  is  needed  to  care  for  and  assist  a  member  of  the  employee’s 
immediate family who is sick.  An employee out on sick leave on the first day of the 
month  may  not  take  the  sick  leave  earned  for  that  month  until  the  employee  has 
returned to work at least one day.   

Immediate family” means a relative of the employee (by kinship, adoption, or 
marriage) who resides in the same household; a foster child who resides in the same 
household; and a minor child of the employee, regardless of whether the child lives in 
the same household.  An employee’s use of sick leave for family members not residing 
in that employee’s household is strictly limited to the time necessary to provide care 
and assistance to the spouse, child, or parent of the employee that needs such care and 
assistance as a direct result of a documented medical condition.  

n  employee  who  must  be  absent  from  work  because  of  sickness,  injury,  or 
pregnancy and confinement must notify his or her supervisor at the earliest possible 
time.  Scheduled sick leave, such as for doctor’s appointments, should be requested in 
advance, if possible, via the Court’s Employee Absence Request form, to be approved 
by the employee’s supervisor.   

 
Return to Duty 

 

An employee absent due to sickness, injury, or pregnancy and confinement for a 
continuous  period  of  more  than  three  working  days  must,  upon  returning  to  duty, 
complete “without delay” the Sick Leave Absence Greater Than Three Days form for 

H:\STANDARD COURT FORMS\HR Forms\Leave Policy.pdf 

4 

 

 

 

   

  “

  A

the Chief Justice’s approval, attached as Exhibit E.  The form must attach a doctor’s 
certificate showing the cause or nature of the condition, or another written statement 
of the facts concerning the condition that is acceptable to the Chief Justice.  The Chief 
Justice may require a doctor’s certificate or other written statement of the facts for sick 
leave taken during a continuous period of three or fewer working days.  An employee 
taking  sick  leave  for  a  continuous  period  of  more  than  three  working  days  may  be 
eligible to have the paid leave also classified as FMLA leave. 

Donation of Sick Leave 
A  Court  employee  may  donate  any  amount  of  his  or  her  accrued  sick  leave 
 
balance  to  another  Court  employee  when  that  employee  or  an  immediate  family 
member of  that employee  has a severe  illness that exhausts  all his or her sick  leave, 
including  that  available  from  the  sick  leave  pool.    Donation  of  sick  leave  is  entirely 
voluntary,  and  the  donor  can  donate  hours  in  any  increment,  with  no  minimum  or 
maximum. 
 

Eligibility: To  be eligible to  receive  donated sick leave, the receiving employee 
must (1) be employed by the same court as the donor employee and (2) have exhausted 
all sick leave, including any time that he or she may be eligible to withdraw from the 
sick leave pool.   

rohibitions: The receiving employee may not (1) provide or receive remuneration 
or a gift in exchange for a sick leave donation; (2) use the donated sick leave for any 
purpose other than allowed by sections 661.202(d) and (e) of the Texas Government 
Code  (i.e.,  to  care  for  the  employee  or  for  members  of  the  employee’s  immediate 
family);  or  (3)  receive  service  credit  in  ERS  for any donated  sick  leave  that  remains 
unused on the last day of that employee’s employment. 

ossible  Tax  Implications:  Sick  leave  donations  are  treated  as  an  assignment  of 
income  that  is  taxable  to  the  donor  unless  the  situation  qualifies  as  a  “medical 
emergency” according to IRS guidelines.  A “medical emergency” is one that requires 
an employee’s prolonged absence from work, resulting in a substantial loss of income 
because  the  employee  has  exhausted  all  otherwise  available  paid  leave.    Sick  leave 
donations for medical emergencies are includible in the gross income of the recipient 
as  wages  and,  therefore,  are  taxable  to  the  recipient  when  the  sick  leave  is  used.  
Employees making or receiving a sick leave donation are encouraged to consult a tax 
advisor.

FMLA Leave4 

To the extent required by federal law, a State employee who has a total of at least 
12 months of State service and who has worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-
month  period  preceding  the  beginning  of  leave  is  entitled  to  FMLA  leave.    The 
employee must first use all available and applicable vacation and sick leave, except that 
an employee who is receiving temporary disability benefits or workers’ compensation 
benefits is not required to first use applicable paid vacation or sick leave while receiving 
those benefits.   
 
Parental Leave5 

A state employee who has fewer than 12 months of state employment and who 
has worked less than 1,250 hours during the 12-month period preceding the beginning 
of leave is eligible to take a parental leave of absence not to exceed 12 weeks.  The 
employee must first use all available and applicable vacation and sick leave.  This type 
of leave is limited to, and begins on the date of, (1) the birth of a natural child of the 
employee, (2) the adoption by the employee of a child younger than three, or (3) the 
date of foster care placement with that employee of a child younger than three.   

Children’s Educational Activities 

An employee who is a parent of a student attending a grade from prekindergarten 
through the twelfth grade may take up to eight hours of sick leave each fiscal year to 
attend educational activities for that employee’s children.  “Educational activity” means 
a school-sponsored activity, including a parent-teacher conference, tutoring, a volunteer 
program, a field trip, a classroom program, a school committee meeting, an academic 
competition,  and  an  athletic,  music,  or  theater  program.    The  employee  must  give 
reasonable  advance  notice  of  the  employee’s  request  to  use  sick  leave  to  attend  an 
educational activity via the Court’s Employee Absence Request form, to be approved 
by the employee’s supervisor.

The Court has established a sick leave pool to provide for the alleviation of the 
hardship caused to an employee and the employee’s family due to a catastrophic injury 
or illness.   
 
Definitions 

A  “catastrophic  injury  or  illness”  is  a  severe  condition  or  combination  of 
conditions affecting the mental or physical health of the employee or a member of the 
employee’s immediate family that requires the services of a licensed practitioner for a 
prolonged period of time, that forces the employee to exhaust all leave time earned by 
that employee, and that would cause the employee to lose compensation from the State 
if additional leave were not granted.  

Immediate family,” for purposes of the sick leave pool, are individuals related 
to  the  employee  by  kinship,  adoption,  or  marriage,  or  foster  children  who  are  so 
certified by the Department of Family and Protective Services, who are living in the 
same  household,  or  if  not  in  the  same  household  are  totally  dependent  upon  the 
employee for personal care or services on a continuing basis.  

Eligibility 

All employees of the Court, with the exception of the justices of the Court, are 
eligible to  participate  in the sick  leave  pool. An employee  is eligible  to  use  the time 
contributed  to  the  sick  leave  pool  if,  because  of  a  catastrophic  injury  or  illness  or 
because  of  a  previous  donation  of  sick  leave  time  to  the  pool,  the  employee  has 
exhausted all paid leave time to which that employee is otherwise entitled, including 
sick, annual, and compensatory leave.   

The Clerk of the Court is appointed by the Court as the Pool Administrator to 

Pool Administrator 

administer the Court’s sick leave pool.   

 
Contributions 

Contributions to the pool are strictly voluntary on the part of each employee.   
Employees  may  contribute  time  by  submitting  a  Sick  Leave  Pool  Application  form, 
attached  as  Exhibit  F,  to  the  Pool  Administrator.    On  approval  by  the  Pool

Administrator, an employee may transfer to the pool not less than one day or more 
than  three days  of  that  employee’s  earned sick  leave  time  per  fiscal  year.    The Pool 
Administrator shall credit the sick leave pool with the amount of time contributed by 
an  employee and shall  deduct a corresponding amount  of  time from the amount  of 
earned sick leave time to which that employee is entitled, the same as if the employee 
had used the contributed sick leave time for personal sick leave purposes. 

mployees who make contributions to the pool may not stipulate or direct who 
is to receive their contributions.  All sick leave time accumulated in the pool may be 
transferred or allotted only as approved by the Pool Administrator in accordance with 
the provisions of this policy.  Furthermore, an employee who contributes leave to the 
pool cannot thereafter withdraw such contributed sick leave time from the pool and 
will lose such contributions, unless the employee is assigned sick leave from the pool 
under the provisions of this policy.  An employee who contributes sick leave time to 
the pool is not guaranteed that sick leave time will be transferred to them in the event 
the employee suffers a catastrophic illness or injury. When all of the accrued sick leave 
pool time has been transferred to an employee or employees, no other sick leave pool 
time can be transferred from the pool until additional time is contributed to and accrued 
in the pool. 

mployees separating from the Court are encouraged to contribute to the pool 
at  the  time  of  their  separation  from  State  employment,  with  no  restriction  on  the 
number of hours that the separating employee may contribute. 

 
Withdrawals 

An employee  may not draw time from the sick  leave  pool  in an amount that 
exceeds the lesser of (a) one-third of the total amount of time in the pool at the time 
the employee’s application to draw time from the pool is approved, or (b) 90 days. 

n employee may apply to the Pool Administrator for permission to draw time 
from the sick leave pool by submitting a Sick Leave Pool Application form, attached as 
Exhibit F, to the Pool Administrator. If the Pool Administrator determines that the 
employee  is  entitled  to  sick  leave  time  from  the  pool,  the  Pool  Administrator  shall 
approve the transfer of time from the pool to that employee.  Applications to draw time 
from the sick leave pool that are submitted by the Clerk of the Court shall be approved 
by the Chief Justice.  The Pool Administrator shall credit the time so transferred to the 
employee,  who  may  use  the  time  in  the  same  manner  as  sick  leave  earned  by  the 
employee  in the  course of employment with  the  Court. Any unused portion of sick 
leave pool time transferred to an employee will be returned to the pool.

H:\STANDARD COURT FORMS\HR Forms\Leave Policy.pdf

Applications to draw time from the sick leave pool will be considered by the Pool 
Administrator on a first-come, first-served basis, provided that the transfer of time from 
the pool to or among employees who have applications for withdrawal pending at the 
same time shall be made in the discretion of the Pool Administrator.  The determination 
so made by the Pool Administrator, when approved by the Chief Justice, shall be final.   

he  Pool  Administrator  will  keep  records  reflecting  the amount  of  sick  leave 
time contributed to the pool by each employee and the total amount of contributed sick 
leave time accumulated in the pool.  When an employee applies to draw time from the 
pool, the Pool Administrator shall determine the exact amount of time that employee 
may draw from the pool at that time.  An employee filing an application to draw time 
from the pool will furnish to the Pool Administrator, in support of such application, 
such records and documentations as the Pool Administrator requires. 

Equal Treatment 

An  employee absent  from  work  on  assigned  sick  leave  from  the  pool  will  be 

treated for all purposes as if the employee were absent on earned sick leave. 

No Entitlement to Estate 

The estate of a deceased employee is not entitled to payment for unused sick 

leave acquired by that employee from the sick leave pool of the Court. 

 
MISCELLANEOUS LEAVE 
 

Emergency Leave6 

Bereavement: An employee is entitled to 3 days’ paid leave in the event of the death 
of  a  person  in  the  employee’s  immediate  family.    An  employee’s  immediate  family 
includes the employee’s spouse and the employee’s (and employee’s spouse’s) parents, 
children, siblings, grandparents, and grandchildren.  

ther  Emergency  Leave:  The  Chief  Justice  may  in  his  or  her  discretion  grant 
emergency leave for reasons other than  bereavement  if the Chief Justice  determines 
that the employee has shown good cause and the Chief Justice believes in good faith 
that the employee being granted the emergency leave intends to return to work when 
the emergency leave ends.

Voting7 

Employees  are  allowed  sufficient  time  off,  without  a  deduction  in  salary  or 
accrued leave, to vote in each national, state, or local election.  If an employee does not 
think he or she has sufficient time to vote before or after work hours, the employee 
should request reasonable time off from his or her supervisor for the specific purpose 
of voting, and such time shall be identified as such on the employee’s time sheet in 
CAPPS.

WORK-FROM-HOME POLICY AND PROCEDURES  

 

Policy and Purpose 
 

The court’s policy is to permit eligible court employees the opportunity to work 

from home in accordance with the following terms when doing so is in the court’s 
best interests, is consistent with the employee’s job duties, and will not diminish the 
employee’s productivity. 
 

This policy applies to court employees in exempt job classifications who have 
been employed by the court for at least one year or more.  This policy does not apply 
to court employees who work on a temporary or part-time basis or justices. 
 

Scope 

Definitions 

 

Adopted 04/26/2018 

.  Work-from-home:  a work arrangement authorized in accordance with 

this policy by which an employee works at a remote location. 
 

Employment Relationship 

he ability to work from home is a privilege that the court may in its discretion 

grant to eligible employees who meet this policy’s requirements, subject to the 
discretionary approval of the justice who supervises the employee.  A work-from-
home arrangement is voluntary and does not alter an employee’s at-will work 
relationship with the court.  An employee participating in a work-from-home 
arrangement must observe all applicable court rules, policies, and procedures.  All 
existing terms and conditions of employment, including without limitation the

Duration 
 

Procedure 

The ability to work from home is not a right; therefore, the court may at any 
time terminate any employee’s work-from-home privilege or this work-from-home 
policy, for any reason.   
 

 

 

 
 

A. 

To obtain general approval to work from home and before beginning 
work at a remote location, an employee must sign a Work-From-Home Agreement 
(see attached Exhibit A) and the Office of Court Administration’s approved VPN 
agreement.  The employee must verify that the remote location meets the work space 
requirements set forth in this policy.   

To obtain approval to work from home on a specific date or at a specific 

time, an employee must obtain written approval—including by text or email—by his 
or her supervising justice before beginning work at the remote location.  An 
employee’s supervising justice, in his or her discretion, may require an employee to 
submit a completed Work-From-Home Request Form (Exhibit B) prior to beginning 
work at a remote location and to articulate the tangible goals the employee expects to 
achieve while working from home (e.g., complete a staff review of a 65-page opinion, 
complete a discussion of the second and third issues in an opinion draft, or read and 
brief relevant cases on a specific legal issue).      

A supervising justice may also, in his or her discretion, require an 

employee to submit a completed Work-From-Home Verification Form (Exhibit C) 
each time the employee returns to the regularly assigned location after working from 
home. 
 

Remote Location Requirements 

The employee must maintain a healthy and safe environment in the 

A. 
remote location.  

 

 

Adopted 04/26/2018 

 

. 

  B

. 

  C

employee’s salary, benefits, leave, and job classification, remain the same as if the 
employee worked only at his or her regularly assigned location.  An employee’s 
supervisor may consider the employee’s performance while working from home 
during the employee’s annual performance review. 

B. 

The employee must protect and secure all sensitive and confidential 

court information when working from the remote location, abide by the court’s 
Ethics Standards, Confidentiality Requirements, and Security Policies, and 
immediately and securely shred any document produced at the remote work location 
that contains confidential court information and that the employee does not intend to 
bring to the regularly assigned location on his or her next scheduled nonwork-from-
home day.   

The employee must have a continuous, secure, password-protected 

internet connection and access at the remote location sufficient to connect with and 
utilize the court’s VPN, subject to the approval of the Office of Court Administration 
and the court’s Network Manager.  The employee’s internet connection and computer 
hardware must enable the employee to maintain continuous VPN access during the 
entire time the employee is scheduled to work from home.  The employee may not 
disclose to any noncourt personnel that the employee has the ability to access the 
court’s network through a VPN connection.  The employee must also maintain 
telephone and email access at all times while working from home.  If the employee 
has technical difficulty maintaining the required internet connection, the employee 
must immediately contact the court’s Network Manager or OCA.  If the employee 
experiences a disruption in internet connectivity for greater than thirty minutes, the 
employee must either take leave, or immediately report to the regularly assigned 
location, for the remainder of the day. 

The employee must maintain continuous VPN access and activity during 

the employee’s approved work-from-home hours.  The employee must ensure that 
non-work related events and activities do not disrupt or interfere with work at the 
remote location.  Work-from-home may not be used as a substitute for child care or 
any other activity that would prevent the employee from maintaining continuous 
VPN access and activity.  If the employee must stay at home for such a reason, or is 
so ill that he or she is unable to perform at the same standard as in the regularly 
assigned location under normal conditions, the employee must take appropriate leave. 

. 

  C

. 

  D

. 

  E

The employee must ensure that all protective software and firewall 

technology is installed and used on all equipment at the remote location.  The 
sufficiency of such software and technology on any noncourt computer is subject to 
the approval of the Office of Court Administration and this court’s Network 
Manager.  

 

Adopted 04/26/2018 

 

   

 
 

Work Schedule 

 

Adopted 04/26/2018 

A. 

An employee may schedule work from home for an entire 8-hour 

workday or increments of the work day, but to be compensated for the work 
performed, an employee may only work from home between the hours of 7:00 a.m. 
and 6:00 p.m.  If an employee does not work from home for an entire 8-hour 
workday, the employee must either work at the regularly assigned location, or take 
appropriate leave, for the hours not worked from home that day. 

. 

To be compensated for the work performed, an employee may work 
from home on no more than 4 regularly scheduled work days per month, only 2 of 
which may occur on sequential days.  An employee must report to the regularly 
assigned location on all other work days except those scheduled for work-from-home 
in accordance with the procedure in this policy.  An employee may not receive 
compensation for work from home performed on a Saturday, Sunday, skeleton crew 
day, or holiday for which the court is closed for business.   

.  Only one attorney in each justice’s chambers may be scheduled to work 
from home on the same day, and an attorney in a chambers may not be scheduled to 
work from home on a day that the other attorney has scheduled leave. 

The employee must be able to report to the regularly assigned location 

on a scheduled work-from-home day if requested. 

. 

An employee scheduled to work from home on a day the court opens 
late or closes early will be expected to work his or her scheduled work hours minus 
the hours of delay (e.g., if the court opens at 10:00 a.m. instead of 8:00 a.m., the 
employee may work from home from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., with a regularly-
scheduled hour lunch break, and receive credit for an 8-hour work day).  If the 
employee is incapable of working at the remote location due to the cause of the 
delayed opening, the employee may request appropriate leave from his or her 
supervising justice.

Equipment and Supplies 

A. 

The court will not reimburse an employee for any costs associated with 

maintaining the remote location in the required condition or for any materials and 
supplies the employee uses for court work at the remote location, including without 
limitation internet connection costs, personal equipment, cellular or land line phone 
costs, utilities, and office supplies. 

 

 

 
 

 

Adopted 04/26/2018 

.  With advance written approval of the Chief Justice and the Network 

Manager, an employee’s personal computer may be used to connect to the VPN and 
to perform court work through the VPN at the remote location.  Otherwise, an 
employee shall use the laptop maintained by the court at the regularly assigned 
location for work at the remote location, subject to all policies and restrictions 
applicable to state-owned property.  The employee may not use, commingle, or allow 
others to use any court equipment.  The employee will be financially responsible for 
any damage or loss to any court equipment resulting from the employee’s negligence, 
misuse, or abuse.  The employee must follow all applicable data retention and backup 
policies applicable to court equipment and work product. 

Damage or Loss to Employee or Property 

he court will not be liable for costs, damages, or loss to an employee, or to 
property at the remote location, associated with this Work-From-Home Policy and 
Procedures. 
 

Modification 

The Chief Justice may, on an ad hoc basis, approve a modification of the 

procedures or requirements in this policy for an individual employee.

court laptop or on any approved personal equipment used at the remote location.   
I agree that I will observe my regularly scheduled work hours while working from 
home.

and that it is a privilege that the court may revoke at any time for any reason. 
I understand that I may be called in to work at my regularly assigned location on 
any day that I am scheduled to work from home, and I agree to maintain adequate 
transportation for that purpose.   
I agree not to use work-from-home as a substitute for appropriate leave.

1The  office  hours  are  8–5,  Monday  through  Friday.    Tex.  Gov’t  Code  §  658.005.    Full-time  salaried 
employees must work a 40-hour work week.    Id. §§ 658.001, .002.    Employees are to conduct their work at the place 
of  employment  and  not  at  the  employee’s  personal  residence  “without  prior  written  authorization  from  the 
administrative  head  of  the  [court].”    Id.  §  658.010.    In  accordance  with  state  law  and  federal  law,  court  policy 
prohibits overtime (i.e., more than forty hours per week) by deputy clerks and secretaries without prior approval of 
their immediate supervisor and the Chief Justice.   Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), nonexempt employees 
who work over 40 hours per week are entitled to compensation for the excess hours by subsequent time off at 1.5 times 
the hours worked or by pay at 1.5 times salary.   The State of Texas’s policy is to provide comp time only, except in 
exceptional circumstances.   Thus, although the court has and may occasionally allow overtime to be compensated 
monetarily, its general policy is to provide comp time only.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
