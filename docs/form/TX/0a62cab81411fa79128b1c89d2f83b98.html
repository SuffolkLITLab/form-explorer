TEXAS DISCIPLINARY RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT 

reamble:  A Lawyer's Responsibilities 

. A lawyer is a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system and a public citizen 
having special responsibility for the quality of justice. Lawyers, as guardians of the law, play 
a  vital  role  in  the  preservation  of  society.  The  fulfillment  of  this  role  requires  an 
understanding  by  lawyers  of  their  relationship  with  and  function  in  our  legal  system.  A 
consequent obligation of lawyers is to maintain the highest standards of ethical conduct. 

. As a representative of clients, a lawyer performs various functions. As advisor, a lawyer 
provides a client with an informed understanding of the client’s legal rights and obligations 
and explains their practical implications. As advocate, a lawyer zealously asserts the clients 
position  under  the  rules  of  the  adversary  system.  As  negotiator,  a  lawyer  seeks  a  result 
advantageous to the client but consistent with requirements of honest dealing with others. As 
intermediary  between  clients,  a  lawyer  seeks  to  reconcile  their  divergent  interests  as  an 
advisor and, to a limited extent, as a spokesperson for each client. A lawyer acts as evaluator 
by examining a client's affairs and reporting about them to the client or to others. 

. In all professional functions, a lawyer should zealously pursue client’s interests within the 
bounds of the law. In doing so, a lawyer should be competent, prompt and diligent. A lawyer 
should maintain communication with a client concerning the representation. A lawyer should 
keep in confidence information relating to representation of a client except so far as disclosure 
is required or permitted by the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct or other law. 

. A lawyer’s conduct should conform to the requirements of the law, both in professional 
service to clients and in the lawyer’s business and personal affairs. A lawyer should use the 
law’s procedures only for legitimate purposes and not to harass or intimidate others. A lawyer 
should demonstrate respect for the legal system and for those who serve it, including judges, 
other lawyers and public officials. While it is a lawyer’s duty, when necessary, to challenge 
the rectitude of official action, it is also a lawyer’s duty to uphold legal process. 

. As a public citizen, a lawyer should seek improvement of the law, the administration of 
justice and the quality of service rendered by the legal profession. As a member of a learned 
profession, a lawyer should cultivate knowledge of the law beyond its use for clients, employ 
that knowledge in reform of the law and work to strengthen legal education. A lawyer should 
be mindful of deficiencies in the administration of justice and of the fact that the poor, and 
sometimes persons who are not poor, cannot afford adequate legal assistance, and should 
therefore devote professional time and civic influence in their behalf. A lawyer should aid the 
legal profession in pursuing these objectives and should help the bar regulate itself in the 
public interest.

6. A lawyer should render public interest legal service. The basic responsibility for providing 
legal services for those unable to pay ultimately rests upon the individual lawyer, and personal 
involvement  in  the  problems  of  the  disadvantages  can  be  one  of  the  most  rewarding 
experiences in the life of a lawyer. Every lawyer, regardless of professional prominence or 
professional workload, should find time to participate in or otherwise support the provision of 
legal services to the disadvantaged. The provision of free legal services to those unable to pay 
reasonable fees is a moral obligation of each lawyer as well as the profession generally. A 
lawyer may discharge this basic responsibility by providing public interest legal services 
without fee, or at a substantially reduced fee, in one or more of the following areas: poverty 
law,  civil  rights  law,  public  rights  law,  charitable  organization  representation,  the 
administration of justice, and by financial support for organizations that provide legal services 
to persons of limited means. 

. In the nature of law practice, conflicting responsibilities are encountered. Virtually all 
difficult ethical problems arise from apparent conflict between a lawyer’s responsibilities to 
clients, to the legal system and to the lawyer’s own interests. The Texas Disciplinary Rules of 
Professional  Conduct  prescribe  terms  for  resolving  such  tensions.  They  do  so  by  stating 
minimum standards  of conduct below  which no lawyer can  fall  without being subject to 
disciplinary action. Within the framework of these Rules many difficult issues of professional 
discretion can arise. The Rules and their Comments constitute a body of principles upon 
which  the  lawyer  can  rely  for  guidance  in  resolving  such  issues  through  the  exercise  of 
sensitive  professional  and  moral  judgment.  In  applying  these  rules,  lawyers  may  find 
interpretive guidance in the principles developed in the Comments. 

. The legal profession has a responsibility to assure that its regulation is undertaken in the 
public interest rather than in furtherance of parochial or self-interested concerns of the bar, 
and to insist that every lawyer both comply with its minimum disciplinary standards and aid 
in securing their observance by other lawyers. Neglect of these responsibilities compromises 
the independence of the profession and the public interest which it serves. 

. Each lawyer’s own conscience is the touchstone against which to test the extent to   which 
his actions may rise above the disciplinary standards prescribed by these rules. The desire for 
the respect and confidence of the members of the profession and of the society which it serves 
provides the lawyer the incentive to attain the highest possible degree of ethical conduct. The 
possible  loss  of  that  respect  and  confidence  is  the  ultimate  sanction.  So  long  as  its 
practitioners are guided by these principles, the law will continue to be a noble profession. 
This is its greatness and its strength, which permit of no compromise.

0. The Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct are rules of reason. The Texas 
Disciplinary  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  define  proper  conduct  for  purposes  of 
professional  discipline.  They  are  imperatives,  cast  in  the  terms  shall  or  shall  not.  The 
comments are cast often in the terms of may or should and are permissive, defining areas in 
which  the  lawyer  has  professional  discretion.  When  a  lawyer  exercises  such  discretion, 
whether by acting or not acting, no disciplinary action may be taken. The Comments also 
frequently illustrate or explain applications of the rules, in order to provide guidance for 
interpreting  the  rules  and  for  practicing  in  compliance  with  the  spirit  of  the  rules.  The 
 

4 

 

Comments do not, however, add obligations to the rules and no disciplinary action may be 
taken for failure to conform to the Comments. 

1.  The  rules  presuppose  a  larger  legal  context  shaping  the  lawyer’s  role.  That  context    
includes  court  rules  and  statutes  relating  to  matters  of  licensure,  laws  defining  specific 
obligations of lawyers and substantive and procedural law in general. Compliance with the 
rules, as with all law in an open society, depends primarily upon understanding and voluntary 
compliance, secondarily upon reinforcement by peer and public opinion and finally, when 
necessary, upon enforcement through disciplinary proceedings. The rules and Comments do 
not, however, exhaust the moral and ethical considerations that should guide a lawyer, for no 
worthwhile human activity can be completely defined by legal rules. 

2. Most of the duties flowing from the client-lawyer relationship attach only after the client 
has requested the lawyer to render legal services and the lawyer has agreed to do so. For 
purposes of determining the lawyer’s authority and responsibility, individual circumstances 
and principles of substantive law external to these rules determine whether a client-lawyer 
relationship  may  be  found  to  exist.  But  there  are  some  duties,  such  as  of  that  of 
confidentiality, that may attach before a client-lawyer relationship has been established. 
  
13. The responsibilities of government lawyers, under various legal provisions, including 
constitutional, statutory and common law, may include authority concerning legal matters that 
ordinarily reposes in the client in private client-lawyer relationships. For example, a lawyer 
for a government agency may have authority on behalf of the government to decide upon 
settlement or whether to appeal from an adverse judgment. Such authority in various respects 
is generally vested in the attorney general and the state’s attorney in state government, and 
their federal counterparts, and the same may be true of other government law officers. Also, 
lawyers  under  the  supervision  of  these  officers  may  be  authorized  to  represent  several 
government  agencies  in  intragovernmental  legal  controversies  in  circumstances  where  a 
private lawyer could not represent multiple private clients. They also may have authority to 
represent the public interest in circumstances where a private lawyer would not be authorized 
to do so. These rules do not abrogate any such authority. 

4. These rules make no attempt to prescribe either disciplinary procedures or penalties for 
violation of a rule. 

5.  These  rules  do  not  undertake  to  define  standards  of  civil  liability  of  lawyers  for 
professional conduct. Violation of a rule does not give rise to a private cause of action nor 
does it create any presumption that a legal duty to a client has been breached.  Likewise, these 
rules are not designed to be standards for procedural decisions. Furthermore, the purpose of 
these rules can be abused when they are invoked by opposing parties as procedural weapons. 
The fact that a rule is a just basis for a lawyer’s self-assessment, or for sanctioning a lawyer 
under the administration of a disciplinary authority, does not imply that an antagonist in a 
collateral proceeding or transaction has standing to seek enforcement of the rule. Accordingly, 
nothing in the rules should be deemed to augment any substantive legal duty of lawyers or the 
extra-disciplinary consequences of violating such a duty.

6. Moreover, these rules are not intended to govern or affect judicial application of either the 
attorney-client or work product privilege. The fact that in exceptional situations the lawyer 
 

5 

 

under the Rules has a limited discretion to disclose a client confidence does not vitiate the 
proposition that, as a general matter, the client has a reasonable expectation that information 
relating to the client will not be voluntarily disclosed and that disclosure of such information 
may be judicially compelled only in accordance with recognized exceptions to the attorney-
client and work product privileges.

1. A lawyer generally should not accept or continue employment in any area of the law in 
which  the  lawyer  is  not  and  will  not  be  prepared  to  render  competent  legal  services. 
Competence  is  defined  in  Terminology  as  possession  of  the  legal  knowledge,  skill,  and 
training reasonably necessary for the representation. Competent representation contemplates 
appropriate application by the lawyer of that legal knowledge, skill and training, reasonable 
thoroughness in the study and analysis of the law and facts, and reasonable attentiveness to 
the responsibilities owed to the client. 

. In determining whether a matter is beyond a lawyer’s competence, relevant factors include 
the relative complexity and specialized nature of the matter, the lawyer’s general experience 
in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer will be able to give the matter, 
and whether it is feasible either to refer the matter to or associate a lawyer of established 
competence in the field in question. The required attention and preparation are determined in 
part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more 
elaborate treatment than matters of lesser consequences. 

. A lawyer may not need to have special training or prior experience to accept employment 
to handle legal problems of a type with which the lawyer is unfamiliar. Although expertise in 
a particular field of law may be useful in some circumstances, the appropriate proficiency in 
many instances is that of a general practitioner. A newly admitted lawyer can be as competent 
in some matters as a practitioner with long experience. Some important legal skills, such as 
the analysis of precedent, the evaluation of evidence and legal drafting, are required in all 
legal problems. Perhaps the most fundamental legal skill consists of determining what kind of 
legal problems  a situation  may  involve,  a skill that necessarily transcends any  particular 
specialized knowledge.  

.  A  lawyer  possessing  the  normal  skill  and  training  reasonably  necessary  for  the 
representation  of  a  client  in  an  area  of  law  is  not  subject  to  discipline  for  accepting  
employment in a matter in which, in order to represent the client properly, the lawyer must 
become  more  competent  in  regard  to  relevant  legal  knowledge  by  additional  study  and 
investigation. If the additional study and preparation will result in unusual delay or expense to 
the client, the lawyer should not accept employment except with the informed consent of the 
client. 

. A lawyer offered employment or employed in a matter beyond the lawyer’s competence 
generally must decline or withdraw from the employment or, with the prior informed consent 
of the client, associate a lawyer who is competent in the matter. Paragraph (a)(2) permits a 
lawyer, however, to give advice or assistance in an emergency in a matter even though the 
lawyer does not have the skill ordinarily required if referral to or consultation with another 
lawyer  would  be  impractical  and  if  the  assistance  is  limited  to  that  which  is  reasonably 
necessary in the circumstances.

. Having accepted employment, a lawyer should act with competence, commitment and 
dedication to the interest of the client and with zeal in advocacy upon the client’s behalf. A 
lawyer should feel a moral or professional obligation to pursue a matter on behalf of a client 
with  reasonable  diligence  and  promptness  despite  opposition,  obstruction  or  personal 
 

8 

 

inconvenience to the lawyer. A lawyer’s workload should be controlled so that each matter 
can be handled with diligence and competence. As provided in paragraph (a), an incompetent 
lawyer is subject to discipline. 

.  Perhaps  no  professional  shortcoming  is  more  widely  resented  than  procrastination.  A 
client’s interests often can be adversely affected by the passage of time or the change of 
conditions; in extreme instances, as when a lawyer overlooks a statute of limitations, the 
client’s  legal  position  may  be  destroyed.  Under  paragraph  (b),  a  lawyer  is  subject  to 
professional discipline for neglecting a particular legal matter as well as for frequent failures 
to carry out fully the obligations owed to one or more clients. A lawyer who acts in good faith 
is not subject to discipline, under those provisions for an isolated inadvertent or unskilled act 
or omission, tactical error, or error of judgment. Because delay can cause a client needless 
anxiety  and  undermine  confidence  in  the  lawyer’s  trustworthiness,  there  is  a  duty  to 
communicate reasonably with clients; see Rule 1.03. 

aintaining Competence 

. Because of the vital  role of  lawyers in the legal  process, each  lawyer  should  strive  to 
become and remain proficient and competent in the practice of law, including the benefits and 
risks associated with relevant technology. To maintain the requisite knowledge and skill of a 
competent practitioner, a lawyer should engage in continuing study and education. If a system 
of  peer  review  has  been  established,  the  lawyer  should  consider  making  use  of  it  in 
appropriate  circumstances.  Isolated  instances  of  faulty  conduct  or  decision  should  be 
identified for purposes of additional study or instruction. 

ule 1.02 Scope and Objectives of Representation 

a) Subject to paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f), a lawyer shall abide by a clients decisions: 

(1) concerning the objectives and general methods of representation; 

(2) whether to accept an offer of settlement of a matter, except as otherwise authorized 
by law; 

(3) In a criminal case, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered, 
whether to waive jury trial, and whether the client will testify. 

b) A lawyer may limit the scope, objectives and general methods of the representation if the 
client consents after consultation. 

c) A lawyer shall not assist or counsel a client to engage in conduct that the lawyer knows is 
criminal or fraudulent. A lawyer may discuss the legal consequences of any proposed course 
of conduct with a client and may counsel and represent a client in connection with the making 
of a good faith effort to determine the validity, scope, meaning or application of the law.

(d) When a lawyer has confidential information clearly establishing that a client is likely to 
commit a criminal or fraudulent act that is likely to result in substantial injury to the financial 
interests or property of another, the lawyer shall promptly make reasonable efforts under the 
circumstances to dissuade the client from committing the crime or fraud. 

e) When a lawyer has confidential information clearly establishing that the lawyer’s client 
has   committed a criminal or fraudulent act in the commission of which the lawyer’s services 
have been used, the lawyer shall make reasonable efforts under the circumstances to persuade 
the client to take corrective action. 

f) When a lawyer knows that a client expects representation not permitted by the rules of 
professional  conduct  or  other  law,  the  lawyer  shall  consult  with  the  client  regarding  the 
relevant limitations on the lawyer’s conduct.

cope of Representation 

. Both lawyer and client have authority and responsibility in the objectives and means of 
representation. The client has ultimate authority to determine the objectives to be served by 
legal representation, within the limits imposed by law, the lawyer’s professional obligations, 
and the agreed scope of representation. Within those limits, a client also has a right to consult 
with the lawyer about the general methods to be used in pursuing those objectives. The lawyer 
should assume responsibility for the means by which the client’s objectives are best achieved. 
Thus, a lawyer has very broad discretion to determine technical and legal tactics, subject to 
the client’s wishes regarding such matters as the expense to be incurred and concern for third 
persons who might be adversely affected. 

. Except where prior communications have made it clear that a particular proposal would be 
unacceptable to the client, a lawyer is obligated to communicate any settlement offer to the 
client in a civil case; and a lawyer has a comparable responsibility with respect to a proposed 
plea bargain in a criminal case.  

. A lawyer should consult with the client concerning any such proposal, and generally it is 
for  the  client  to  decide  whether  or  not  to  accept  it.  This  principle  is  subject  to  several 
exceptions or qualifications. First, in class actions a lawyer may recommend a settlement of 
the  matter  to  the  court  over  the  objections  of  named  plaintiffs  in  the  case.  Second,  in 
insurance  defense  cases  a  lawyer’s  ability  to  implement  an  insured  client’s  wishes  with 
respect to settlement may be qualified by the contractual rights of the insurer under its policy. 
Finally,  a  lawyer’s  normal  deference  to  a  client’s  wishes  concerning  settlement  may  be 
abrogated  if  the  client  has  validly  relinquished  to  a  third  party  any  rights  to  pass  upon 
settlement offers. Whether any such waiver is enforceable is a question largely beyond the 
scope of these rules. But see comment 5 below. A lawyer reasonably relying on any of these 
exceptions  in  not implementing  a  client’s desires concerning settlement  is, however, not 
subject to discipline under this Rule.

4. The scope of representation provided by a lawyer may be limited by agreement with the 
client or by the terms under which the lawyer’s services are made available to the client. For 
example, a  retainer may be for  a specifically defined objective. Likewise,  representation 
provided through a legal aid agency may be subject to limitations on the types of cases the 
agency handles. Similarly when a lawyer has been retained by an insurer to represent an 
insured, the representation may be limited to matters related to the insurance coverage. The 
scope within which the representation is undertaken also may exclude specific objectives or 
means, such as those that the lawyer or client regards as repugnant or imprudent. 

.  An  agreement  concerning  the  scope  of  representation  must  accord  with  the  Texas 
Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct and other law. Thus, the client may not be asked 
to agree to representation so limited in scope as to violate Rule 1.01, or to surrender the right 
to terminate the lawyer’s services or the right to settle or continue litigation that the lawyer 
might wish to handle differently. 

. Unless the representation is terminated as provided in Rule 1.15, a lawyer should carry 
through  to  conclusion  all  matters  undertaken  for  a  client.  If  a  lawyer’s  representation  is 
limited to a specific matter or matters, the relationship terminates when the matter has been 
resolved. If a lawyer has represented a client over a substantial period in a variety of matters, 
the client may sometimes assume that the lawyer will continue to serve on a continuing basis 
unless  the  lawyer  gives  notice  to  the  contrary.  Doubt  about  whether  a  client-lawyer 
relationship still exists should be clarified by the lawyer, preferably in writing, so that the 
client will not mistakenly suppose the lawyer is looking after the client’s affairs when the 
lawyer has ceased to do so. For example, if a lawyer has handled a judicial or administrative 
proceeding that produced a result adverse to the client but has not been specifically instructed 
concerning pursuit of an appeal,  the lawyer should advise  the  client of  the possibility of 
appeal before relinquishing responsibility for the matter.

. A lawyer is required to give an honest opinion about the actual consequences that appear 
likely to result from a client’s conduct. The fact that a client uses advice in a course of action 
that is criminal or fraudulent does not, of itself, make a lawyer a party to the course of action. 
However, a lawyer may not knowingly assist a client in criminal or fraudulent conduct. There 
is a critical distinction between presenting an analysis of legal aspects of questionable conduct 
and recommending the means by which a crime or fraud might be committed with impunity. 
  
8.  When  a  client’s  course  of  action  has  already  begun  and  is  continuing,  the  lawyer’s 
responsibility  is  especially  delicate.  The  lawyer  may  not  reveal  the  client’s  wrongdoing, 
except as permitted or required by Rule 1.05. However, the lawyer also must avoid furthering 
the  client’s  unlawful  purpose,  for  example,  by  suggesting  how  it  might  be  concealed.  A 
lawyer may not continue assisting a client in conduct that the lawyer originally supposes is 
legally  proper  but  then  discovers  is  criminal  or  fraudulent.  Withdrawal  from  the 
representation, therefore, may be required. See Rule 1.15(a)(1) 

. Paragraph (c) is violated when a lawyer accepts a general retainer for legal services to an 
enterprise known to be unlawful. Paragraph (c) does not, however, preclude undertaking a 
criminal defense incident to a general retainer for legal services to a lawful enterprise. 
 

11 

  9

 

0. The last clause of paragraph (c) recognizes that determining the validity or interpretation 
of a statute or regulation may require a course of action involving disobedience of the statute 
or regulation or of the interpretation placed upon it by governmental authorities. 

1. Paragraph (d) requires a lawyer in certain instances to use reasonable efforts to dissuade a 
client from committing a crime or fraud. If the services of the lawyer were used by the client 
in committing a crime or fraud paragraph (e) requires the lawyer to use reasonable efforts to 
persuade the client to take corrective action. 

ule 1.03 Communication 

a) A lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly 
comply with reasonable requests for information. 

b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to 
make informed decisions regarding the representation. 

omment: 

.  The  client  should  have  sufficient  information  to  participate  intelligently  in  decisions 
concerning  the  objectives  of  the  representation  and  the  means  by  which  they  are  to  be 
pursued, to the extent the client is willing and able to do so. For example, a lawyer negotiating 
on behalf of a client should provide the client with facts relevant to the matter, inform the 
client of communications from another party and take other reasonable steps to permit the 
client to make a decision regarding a serious offer from another party. A lawyer who receives 
from opposing counsel either an offer of settlement in a civil controversy or a proffered plea 
bargain in a criminal case should promptly inform the client of its substance unless prior 
discussions  with  the  client  have  left  it  clear  that  the  proposal  will  be  unacceptable.  See 
Comment 2 to Rule 1.02. 

. Adequacy of communication depends in part on the kind of advice or assistance involved. 
For example, in negotiations where there is time to explain a proposal the lawyer should 
review  all  important  provisions  with  the  client  before  proceeding  to  an  agreement.  In 
litigation a lawyer should explain the general strategy and prospects of success and ordinarily 
should consult the client on tactics that might injure or coerce others. On the other hand, a 
lawyer  ordinarily  cannot  be  expected  to  describe  trial  or  negotiation  strategy  in  detail. 
Moreover, in certain situations practical exigency may require a lawyer to act for a client 
without prior consultation. The guiding principle is that the lawyer should reasonably fulfill 
client expectations for information consistent with the duty to act in the client’s best interests, 
and the clients overall requirements as to the character of representation.

. Ordinarily, a lawyer should provide to the client information that would be appropriate for 
a comprehending and responsible adult. However, communicating such information may be 
impractical if the client is a child or suffers from diminished capacity; see paragraph 5 and 
Rule 1.16. When the client is an organization or group, it is often impossible or inappropriate 
to  inform  every  one  of  its  members  about  its  legal  affairs;  ordinarily,  the  lawyer  should 
address communications to the appropriate officials of the organization. See Rule 1.12. Where 
 

12 

 

many  routine  matters  are  involved,  a  system  of  limited  or  occasional  reporting  may  be 
arranged with the client. 

ithholding Information 

. In some circumstances, a lawyer may be justified in delaying transmission of information 
when the lawyer reasonably believes the client would be likely to react imprudently to an 
immediate communication. Thus, a lawyer might withhold a psychiatric diagnosis of a client 
when the examining psychiatrist indicates that disclosure would harm the client. Similarly, 
rules or court orders governing litigation may provide that information supplied to a lawyer 
may  not  be  disclosed  to  the  client.  Rule  3.04(d)  sets  forth  the  lawyer’s  obligations  with 
respect to such rules or orders. A lawyer may not, however, withhold information to serve the 
lawyer’s own interest or convenience. 

lient with Diminished Capacity 

. If a client appears to suffer from diminished capacity, a lawyer should communicate with 
any  legal  representative  and  seek  to  maintain  reasonable  communication  with  the  client, 
insofar as possible. Even if the client suffers from diminished capacity, it may be possible to 
maintain  some  aspects  of  a  normal  attorney-client  relationship.  The  client  may  have  the 
ability to understand, deliberate upon, and reach conclusions about some matters affecting the 
client’s own well-being. Children’s opinions regarding their own custody are given some 
weight.  Regardless  of  whether  a  client  suffers  from  diminished  capacity,  a  client  should 
always be treated with attention and respect. See also Rule 1.16 and Rule 1.05, Comment 17. 

.04 Fees (Effective March 1, 2005) 

a)  A  lawyer  shall  not  enter  into  an  arrangement  for,  charge,  or  collect  an  illegal  fee  or 
unconscionable  fee.  A  fee  is  unconscionable  if  a  competent  lawyer  could  not  form  a 
reasonable belief that the fee is reasonable. 

b) Factors that may be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee include, but not 
to the exclusion of other relevant factors, the following: 
 

(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, 
and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; 

(2)  the  likelihood,  if  apparent  to  the  client,  that  the  acceptance  of  the  particular 
employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer; 

(3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services; 

(4) the amount involved and the results obtained; 

(5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances; 

(6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;

(7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the 
services; and 

(8)  whether  the  fee  is  fixed  or  contingent  on  results  obtained  or  uncertainty  of 
collection before the legal services have been rendered. 

c) When the lawyer has not regularly represented the client, the basis or rate of the fee shall 
be communicated to the client, preferably in writing, before or within a reasonable time after 
commencing the representation. 

d) A fee may be contingent on the outcome of the matter for which the service is rendered, 
except in a matter in which a contingent fee is prohibited by paragraph (e) or other law. A 
contingent fee agreement shall be in writing and shall state the method by which the fee is to 
be determined. If there is to be a differentiation in the percentage or percentages that shall 
accrue to the lawyer in the event of settlement, trial or appeal, the percentage for each shall be 
stated. The agreement shall state the litigation and other expenses to be deducted from the 
recovery, and whether such expenses are to be deducted before or after the contingent fee is 
calculated. Upon conclusion of a contingent fee matter, the lawyer shall provide the client 
with a written statement describing the outcome of the matter and, if there is a recovery, 
showing the remittance to the client and the method of its determination. 

e) A lawyer shall not enter into an arrangement for, charge, or collect a contingent fee for 
representing a defendant in a criminal case. 

f) A division or arrangement for division of a fee between lawyers who are not in the same 
firm may be made only if: 

(1) the division is: 

 

(i) in proportion to the professional services performed by each lawyer; or 

(ii)  made  between  lawyers  who  assume  joint  responsibility  for  the 
representation; and 

(2) the client consents in writing to the terms of the arrangement prior to the time of 
the association or referral proposed, including 

(i) the identity of all lawyers or law firms who will participate in the fee-
sharing arrangement, and 

(ii) whether fees will be divided based on the proportion of services performed 
or by lawyers agreeing to assume joint responsibility for the representation, 
and 

(iii) the share of the fee that each lawyer or law firm will receive or, if the 
division is based on the proportion of services performed, the basis on which 
the division will be made; and

(3) the aggregate fee does not violate paragraph (a). 

g)  Every  agreement  that  allows  a  lawyer  or  law  firm  to  associate  other  counsel  in  the 
representation of a person, or to refer the person to other counsel for such representation, and 
that results in such an association with or referral to a different law firm or a lawyer in such a 
different firm, shall be confirmed by an arrangement conforming to paragraph (f). Consent by 
a  client  or  a  prospective  client  without  knowledge  of  the  information  specified  in 
subparagraph (f)(2) does not constitute a confirmation within the meaning of this rule. No 
attorney  shall  collect  or  seek  to  collect  fees  or  expenses  in  connection  with  any  such 
agreement that is not confirmed in that way, except for: 
 
 

 
(1) the reasonable value of legal services provided to that person; and 

(2) the reasonable and necessary expenses actually incurred on behalf of that person. 

h) Paragraph (f) of this rule does  not apply  to  payment to  a  former partner or associate 
pursuant to a separation or retirement agreement, or to a lawyer referral program certified by 
the State Bar of Texas in accordance with the Texas Lawyer Referral Service Quality Act, 
Tex. Occ. Code 952.001 et seq., or any amendments or recodifications thereof. 

omment: 

. A lawyer in good conscience should not charge or collect more than a reasonable fee, 
although he may charge less or no fee at all. The determination of the reasonableness of a fee, 
or of the range of reasonableness, can be a difficult question, and a standard of reasonableness 
is too vague and uncertain to be an appropriate standard in a disciplinary action. For this 
reason, paragraph (a) adopts, for disciplinary purposes only, a clearer standard: the lawyer is 
subject to discipline for an illegal fee or an unconscionable fee. Paragraph (a) defines an 
unconscionable fee in terms of the reasonableness of the fee but in a way to eliminate factual 
disputes as to the fees reasonableness. The Rules unconscionable standard, however, does not 
preclude use of the reasonableness standard of paragraph (b) in other settings. 

asis or Rate of Fee 

. When the lawyer has regularly represented a client, they ordinarily will have evolved an 
understanding concerning the basis or rate of the fee. If, however, the basis or rate of fee 
being  charged  to  a  regularly  represented  client  differs  from  the  understanding  that  has 
evolved,  the  lawyer  should  so  advise  the  client.  In  a  new  client-lawyer  relationship,  an 
understanding as to the fee should be promptly established. It is not necessary to recite all the 
factors  that  underlie  the  basis  of  the  fee,  but  only  those  that  are  directly  involved  in  its 
computation. It is sufficient, for example, to state that the basic rate is an hourly charge or a 
fixed amount or an estimated amount, in order to identify the factors that may be taken into 
account in finally fixing the fee. When developments occur during the representation that 
render an earlier estimate substantially inaccurate, a revised estimate should be provided to 
the client. A written statement concerning the fee reduces the possibility of misunderstanding, 
and when the lawyer has not regularly represented the client it is preferable for the basis or 
rate of the fee to be communicated to the client in writing. Furnishing the client with a simple 

 

 

15

  (

  C

  1

  B

  2

memorandum or a copy of the lawyer’s customary fee schedule is sufficient if the basis or rate 
of the fee is set forth. In the case of a contingent fee, a written agreement is mandatory. 

ypes of Fees 

.  Historically  lawyers  have  determined  what  fees  to  charge  by  a  variety  of  methods. 
Commonly employed are percentage fees and contingent fees (which may vary in accordance 
with  the  amount  at  stake  or  recovered),  hourly  rates,  and  flat  fee  arrangements,  or 
combinations thereof. 

. The determination of a proper fee requires consideration of the interests of both client and 
lawyer.  The  determination  of  reasonableness  requires  consideration  of  all  relevant 
circumstances, including those stated in paragraph (b). Obviously, in a particular situation not 
all  of  the  factors  listed  in  paragraph  (b)  may  be  relevant  and  factors  not  listed  could  be 
relevant.  The  fees  of  a  lawyer  will  vary  according  to  many  factors,  including  the  time 
required, the lawyer’s experience, ability and reputation, the nature of the employment, the 
responsibility involved, and the results obtained. 

. When there is a doubt whether a particular fee arrangement is consistent with the client’s 
best interest, the lawyer should discuss with the client alternative bases for the fee and explain 
their implications. 

. Once a fee arrangement is agreed to, a lawyer should not handle the matter so as to further 
the lawyer’s financial interests to the detriment of the client. For example, a lawyer should not 
abuse a fee arrangement based primarily on hourly charges by using wasteful procedures. 

nconscionable Fees 

. Two principal circumstances combine to make it difficult to determine whether a particular 
fee is unconscionable within the disciplinary test provided by paragraph (a) of this Rule. The 
first is the subjectivity of a number of the factors relied on to determine the reasonableness of 
fees under paragraph (b). Because those factors do not permit more than an approximation of 
a range of fees that might be found reasonable in any given case, there is a corresponding 
degree of uncertainty in determining whether a given fee is unconscionable. Secondly, fee 
arrangements  normally  are  made  at  the  outset  of  representation,  a  time  when  many 
uncertainties and contingencies exist, while claims of unconscionability are made in hindsight 
when  the  contingencies  have  been  resolved.  The  unconscionability  standard  adopts  that 
difference  in  perspective  and  requires  that  a  lawyer  be  given  the  benefit  of  any  such 
uncertainties for disciplinary purposes only. Except in very unusual situations, therefore, the 
circumstances at the time a fee arrangement is made should control in determining a question 
of unconscionability. 

. Two factors in otherwise borderline cases might indicate a fee may be unconscionable. The 
first is overreaching by a lawyer, particularly of a client who was unusually susceptible to 
such overreaching. The second is a failure of the lawyer to give at the outset a clear and 
accurate explanation  of  how a fee was to be calculated. For example,  a  fee arrangement 
negotiated  at arms length  with an  experienced business client  would rarely  be  subject  to 
question.  On  the  other  hand,  a  fee  arrangement  with  an  uneducated  or  unsophisticated 
 

16 

 

  T

  3

  4

  5

  6

  U

  7

  8

individual having no prior experience in such matters should be more carefully scrutinized for 
overreaching. While the fact that a client was at a marked disadvantage in bargaining with a 
lawyer over fees will not make a fee unconscionable, application of the disciplinary test may 
require some consideration of the personal circumstances of the individuals involved. 

ees in Family Law Matters 

. Contingent and percentage fees in family law matters may tend to promote divorce and 
may  be  inconsistent  with  a  lawyer’s  obligation  to  encourage  reconciliation.  Such  fee 
arrangements  also  may  tend  to  create  a  conflict  of  interest  between  lawyer  and  client 
regarding the appraisal of assets obtained for client. See also Rule 1.08(h). In certain family 
law matters, such as child custody and adoption, no res is created to fund a fee. Because of the 
human relationships involved and the unique character of the proceedings, contingent fee 
arrangements in domestic relations cases are rarely justified. 

ivision of Fees 

0. A division of fees is a single billing to a client covering the fee of two or more lawyers 
who are not in the same firm. A division of fees facilitates association of more than one 
lawyer in a matter in which neither alone could serve the client as well, and most often is used 
when  the  fee  is  contingent  and  the  division  is  between  a  referring  or  associating  lawyer 
initially retained by the client and a trial specialist, but it applies in all cases in which two or 
more  lawyers  are  representing  a  single  client  in  the  same  matter,  and  without  regard  to 
whether litigation is involved. Paragraph (f) permits the lawyers to divide a fee either on the 
basis of the proportion of services they render or if each lawyer assumes joint responsibility 
for the representation. 

1. Contingent fee agreements must be in a writing signed by the client and must otherwise 

comply with paragraph (d) of this Rule. 

2. A division of a fee based on the proportion of services rendered by two or more lawyers 
contemplates that each lawyer is performing substantial legal services on behalf of the client 
with respect to the matter. In particular, it requires that each lawyer who participates in the fee 
have performed services  beyond those involved  in  initially seeking  to acquire and  being 
engaged by the client. There must be a reasonable correlation between the amount or value of 
services  rendered  and  responsibility  assumed,  and  the  share  of  the  fee  to  be  received. 
However, if each participating lawyer performs substantial legal services on behalf of the 
client, the agreed division should control even though the division is not directly proportional 
to actual work performed. If a division of fee is to be based on the proportion of services 
rendered, the arrangement may provide that the allocation not be made until the end of the 
representation. When the allocation is deferred until the end of the representation, the terms of 
the arrangement must include the basis by which the division will be made.

3.  Joint  responsibility  for  the  representation  entails  ethical  and  perhaps  financial 
responsibility  for  the  representation.  The  ethical  responsibility  assumed  requires  that  a 
referring or associating lawyer make reasonable efforts to assure adequacy of representation 
and to provide adequate client communication. Adequacy of representation requires that the 
referring or associating lawyer conduct a reasonable investigation of the client’s legal matter 
 

17 

 

and refer the matter to a lawyer whom the referring or associating lawyer reasonably believes 
is competent to handle it. See Rule 1.01. Adequate attorney-client communication requires 
that a referring or associating lawyer monitor the matter throughout the representation and 
ensure that the client is informed of those matters that come to that lawyer’s attention and that 
a reasonable lawyer would believe the client should be aware. See Rule 1.03. Attending all 
depositions and hearings, or requiring that copies of all pleadings and correspondence be 
provided a referring or associating lawyer, is not necessary in order to meet the monitoring 
requirement proposed by this rule.  These types of activities may increase the transactional 
costs, which ultimately the client will bear, and unless some benefit will be derived by the 
client, they should be avoided.  The monitoring requirement is only that the referring lawyer 
be reasonably informed of the matter, respond to client questions, and assist the handling 
lawyer when necessary.  Any referral or association of other counsel should be made based 
solely on the client’s best interest. 

4.  In  the  aggregate,  the  minimum  activities  that  must  be  undertaken  by  referring  or 
associating lawyers pursuant to an arrangement for a division of fees are substantially greater 
than those assumed by a  lawyer  who  forwarded  a matter  to  other  counsel,  undertook no 
ongoing obligations with respect to it, and yet received a portion of the handling lawyer’s fee 
once the matter was concluded, as was permitted under the prior version of this rule.  Whether 
such activities, or any additional activities that a lawyer might agree to undertake, suffice to 
make  one  lawyer  participating  in  such  an  arrangement  responsible  for  the  professional 
misconduct of another lawyer who is participating in it and, if so, to what extent, are intended 
to be resolved by Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, ch. 33, or other applicable law. 

5. A client must consent in writing to the terms of the arrangement prior to the time of the 
association or referral proposed.  For this consent to be effective, the client must have been 
advised of at least the key features of that arrangement.  Those essential terms, which are 
specified in subparagraph (f)(2), are  
 

(1) The identity of all lawyers or law firms who will participate in the fee-sharing 
agreement, 

(2) Whether fees will be divided based on the proportion of services performed or by 
lawyers agreeing to assume joint responsibility for the representation, and 

(3) The share of the fee that each lawyer or law firm will receive or the basis on which 
the division will be made if the division is based on proportion of service performed.  
Consent by a  client or  prospective  client  to  the  referral to  or association  of other 
counsel, made prior to any actual such referral or association but without knowledge 
of  the  information  specified  in  subparagraph  (f)(2),  does  not  constitute  sufficient 
client  confirmation  within  the  meaning  of  this  rule.    The  referring  or  associating 
lawyer or any other lawyer who employs another lawyer to assist in the representation 
has the primary duty to ensure full disclosure and compliance with this rule.

6. Paragraph (g) facilitates the enforcement of the requirements of paragraph (f).  It does so 
by providing that agreements that authorize an attorney either to refer a person’s case to 
another  lawyer,  or  to  associate  other  counsel  in  the  handling  of  a  client’s  case,  and  that 
actually result in such a referral or association with counsel in a different law firm from the 
 

18 

 

one entering into the agreement, must be confirmed by an arrangement between the person 
and the lawyers involved that conforms to paragraph (f).  As noted there, that arrangement 
must be presented to and agreed to by the person before the referral or association between 
the lawyers involved occurs. See subparagraph (f)(2).  Because paragraph (g) refers to the 
party whose matter is involved as a “person” rather than as a “client,” it is not possible to 
evade its requirements by having a referring lawyer not formally enter into an attorney-client 
relationship with the person involved before referring that person’s matter to other counsel.  
Paragraph (g) does provide, however, for recovery in quantum meruit in instances where its 
requirements are not met.  See subparagraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2). 

7. What should be done with any otherwise agreed-to fee that is forfeited in whole or in part 

due to a lawyer’s failure to comply with paragraph (g) is not resolved by these rules.   

8. Subparagraph (f)(3) requires that the aggregate fee charged to clients in connection with a 
given matter by all of the lawyers involved meet the standards of paragraph (a)—that is, not 
be unconscionable.  

ee Disputes and Determinations 

9. If a procedure has been established for resolution of fee disputes, such as an arbitration or 
mediation  procedure  established  by  a  bar  association,  the  lawyer  should  conscientiously 
consider submitting to it.  Law may prescribe a procedure for determining a lawyer’s fee, for 
example, in representation of an executor or administrator, or when a class or a person is 
entitled  to  recover  a  reasonable  attorney’s  fee  as  part  of  the  measure  of  damages.    All 
involved lawyers should comply with any prescribed procedures. 

ule 1.05 Confidentiality of Information 

a) Confidential information includes both privileged information and unprivileged client 
information. Privileged information refers to the information of  a  client protected by the 
lawyer-client privilege of Rule 5.03 of the Texas Rules of Evidence or of Rule 5.03 of the 
Texas Rules of Criminal Evidence or by the principles of attorney-client privilege governed 
by Rule 5.01 of the Federal Rules of Evidence for United States Courts and Magistrates. 
Unprivileged client information means all information relating to a client or furnished by the 
client, other than privileged information, acquired by the lawyer during the course of or by 
reason of the representation of the client. 

b) Except as permitted by paragraphs (c) and (d), or as required by paragraphs (e), and (f), a 
lawyer shall not knowingly: 

(1) Reveal confidential information of a client or a former client to: 
 
 

 
(i) a person that the client has instructed is not to receive the information; or 

(ii)  anyone  else,  other  than  the  client,  the  client’s  representatives,  or  the 
members, associates, or employees of the lawyer’s law firm.

(2) Use confidential information of a client to the disadvantage of the client unless the 
client consents after consultations. 

(3) Use confidential information of a former client to the disadvantage of the former 
client after the representation is concluded unless the former client consents after 
consultation or the confidential information has become generally known.  

(4) Use privileged information of a client for the advantage of the lawyer or of a third 
person, unless the client consents after consultation. 

c) A lawyer may reveal confidential information: 

(1) When the lawyer has been expressly authorized to do so in order to carry out the 
representation. 

(2) When the client consents after consultation. 

(3)  To  the  client,  the  client’s  representatives,  or  the  members,  associates,  and 
employees of the lawyers firm, except when otherwise instructed by the client. 

(4) When the lawyer has reason to believe it is necessary to do so in order to comply 
with a court order, a Texas Disciplinary Rule of Professional Conduct, or other law. 

(5) To the extent reasonably necessary to enforce a claim or establish a defense on 
behalf of the lawyer in a controversy between the lawyer and the client. 

(6) To establish a defense to a criminal charge, civil claim or disciplinary complaint 
against  the lawyer or the lawyer’s associates based upon conduct involving the client 
or the representation of the client. 

(7) When the lawyer has reason to believe it is necessary to do so in order to prevent 
the client from committing a criminal or fraudulent act. 

(8) To the extent revelation reasonably appears necessary to rectify the consequences 
of  a  client’s  criminal  or  fraudulent  act  in  the  commission  of  which  the  lawyer’s 
services had been used. 

9) To secure legal advice about the lawyer’s compliance with these Rules. 

10) When the lawyer has reason to believe it is necessary to do so in order to prevent 
the client from dying by suicide. 

  (

  (

d) A lawyer also may reveal unprivileged client information. 

(1) When impliedly authorized to do so in order to carry out the representation. 

(2) When the lawyer has reason to believe it is necessary to do so in order to:

(i) carry out the representation effectively; 

(ii) defend the lawyer or the lawyer’s employees or associates against a claim 
of wrongful conduct; 

(iii)  respond  to  allegations  in  any  proceeding  concerning  the  lawyers 
representation of the client; or 

(iv) prove the services rendered to a client, or the reasonable value thereof, or 
both, in an action against another person or organization responsible for the 
payment of the fee for services rendered to the client. 

e) When a lawyer has confidential information clearly establishing that a client is likely to 
commit a criminal or fraudulent act that is likely to result in death or substantial bodily harm  
to  a  person,  the  lawyer  shall  reveal  confidential  information  to  the  extent  revelation 
reasonably appears necessary to prevent the client from committing the criminal or fraudulent 
act. 

f) A lawyer shall reveal confidential information when required to do so by Rule 3.03(a)(2), 
3.03(b), or by Rule 4.01(b). 

omment: 

onfidentiality Generally 

.  Both  the  fiduciary  relationship  existing  between  lawyer  and  client  and  the  proper 
functioning  of  the  legal  system  require  the  preservation  by  the  lawyer  of  confidential 
information of one who has employed or sought to employ the lawyer. Free discussion should 
prevail between lawyer and client in order for the lawyer to be fully informed and for the 
client to obtain the full benefit of the legal system. The ethical obligation of the lawyer to 
protect the confidential information of the client not only facilitates the proper representation 
of the client but also encourages potential clients to seek early legal assistance. 

. Subject to the mandatory disclosure requirements of paragraphs (e) and (f) the lawyer 
generally should be required to maintain confidentiality of information acquired by the lawyer 
during the course of or by reason of the representation of the client. This principle involves an 
ethical obligation not to use the information to the detriment of the client or for the benefit of 
the lawyer or a third person. In regard to an evaluation of a matter affecting a client for use by 
a third person, see Rule 2.02. 

. The principle of confidentiality is given effect not only in the Texas Disciplinary Rules of 
Professional Conduct but also in the law of evidence regarding the attorney-client privilege 
and in the law of agency. The attorney-client privilege, developed through many decades, 
provides the client a right to prevent certain confidential communications from being revealed 
by compulsion of law. Several sound exceptions to confidentiality have been developed in the 
evidence law of privilege. Exceptions exist in evidence law where the services of the lawyer 
were sought or used by a client in planning or committing a crime or fraud as well as where 
issues have arisen as to breach of duty by the lawyer or by the client to the other.

. Rule 1.05 reinforces the principles of evidence law relating to the attorney-client privilege. 
Rule 1.05 also furnishes considerable protection to other information falling outside the scope 
of the privilege Rule 1.05 extends ethical protection generally to unprivileged information 
relating  to  the  client  or  furnished  by  the  client  during  the  course  of  or  by  reason  of  the 
representation of the client. In this respect Rule 1.05 accords with general fiduciary principles 
of agency. 

. The requirement of confidentiality applies to government lawyers who may disagree with 
the policy goals that their representation is designed to advance.  

isclosure for Benefit of Client 

. A lawyer may be expressly authorized to make disclosures to carry out the representation 
and generally is recognized as having implied-in-fact authority to make disclosures about a 
client  when  appropriate  in  carrying  out  the  representation  to  the  extent  that  the  client’s 
instructions  do not limit that  authority.  In litigation, for  example, a lawyer  may  disclose 
information by admitting a fact that cannot properly be disputed, or in negotiation by making 
a disclosure that facilitates a satisfactory conclusion. The effect of Rule 1.05 is to require the 
lawyer to invoke,  for the client, the attorney-client privilege when applicable; but if the court 
improperly denies the privilege, under paragraph (c)(4) the lawyer may testify as ordered by 
the court or may test the ruling as permitted by Rule 3.04(d). 

. In the course of a firms practice, lawyers may disclose to each other and to appropriate 
employee’s information relating to a client, unless the client has instructed that particular 
information be confined to specified lawyers. Sub-paragraphs (b)(l) and (c)(3) continue these 
practices concerning disclosure of confidential information within the firm. 
  
Use of Information 

. Following sound principles of agency law, sub-paragraphs (b)(2) and (4) subject a lawyer 
to discipline for using information relating to the representation in a manner disadvantageous 
to the client or beneficial to the lawyer or a third person, absent the informed consent of the 
client. The duty not to misuse client information continues after the client-lawyer relationship 
has terminated. Therefore, the lawyer is forbidden by sub-paragraph (b)(3) to use, in absence 
of the client’s informed consent, confidential information of the former client to the client’s 
disadvantage, unless the information is generally known. 

iscretionary Disclosure Adverse to Client 

.  In  becoming  privy  to  information  about  a  client,  a  lawyer  may  foresee  that  the  client 
intends  serious  and  perhaps  irreparable  harm.  To  the  extent  a  lawyer  is  prohibited  from 
making disclosure, the interests of the potential victim are sacrificed in favor of preserving the 
client’s information-usually unprivileged information-even though the client’s purpose is 
wrongful. On the other hand, a client who knows or believes that a lawyer is required or 
permitted to disclose  a client’s wrongful  purposes may be inhibited from revealing facts 
which would enable the lawyer to counsel effectively against wrongful action. Rule 1.05 thus 

  4

  5

  D

  6

  7

  8

  D

22 

involves balancing the interests of one group of potential victims against those of another. 
The criteria provided by the Rule are discussed below. 

0. Rule 5.03 (d)(l) Texas Rules of Civil Evidence (Tex. R. Civ. Evid.), and Rule 5.03(d)(1), 
Texas Rules of Criminal Evidence (Tex R. Crim. Evid.), indicate the underlying public policy 
of furnishing no protection to client information where the client seeks or uses the services of 
the lawyer to aid  in  the  commission of  a crime  or fraud. That  public  policy governs the 
dictates of Rule 1.05. Where the  client is planning or engaging in criminal or fraudulent 
conduct or where the culpability of the lawyers conduct is involved, full protection of client 
information is not justified. 

1. Several other situations must be distinguished. First, the lawyer may not counsel or assist 
a client in conduct that is criminal or fraudulent. See Rule 1.02(c). As noted in the Comment 
to that Rule there can be situations where the lawyer may have to reveal information relating 
to the representation in order to avoid assisting a client’s criminal or fraudulent conduct, and 
sub-paragraph (c)(4) permits doing so. A lawyer’s duty under Rule 3.03(a) not to use false or 
fabricated  evidence  is  a  special  instance  of  the  duty  prescribed  in  Rule  1.02(c)  to  avoid 
assisting a client in criminal or fraudulent conduct, and sub-paragraph (c)(4) permits revealing 
information necessary to comply with Rule 3.03(a) or (b). The same is true of compliance 
with Rule 4.01. See also paragraph (f).  

2. Second, the lawyer may have been innocently involved in past conduct by the client that 
was criminal or fraudulent.  In such  a situation the lawyer  has not violated Rule 1.02(c), 
because to counsel or assist criminal or fraudulent conduct requires knowing that the conduct 
is of that character. Since the lawyer’s services were made an instrument of the client’s crime 
or fraud, the lawyer has a legitimate interest both in rectifying the consequences of such 
conduct and in avoiding charges that the lawyer’s participation was culpable. Sub-paragraph 
(c)(6)  and  (8)  give  the  lawyer  professional  discretion  to  reveal  both  unprivileged  and 
privileged information in order to serve those interests. See paragraph (g). In view of Tex. R. 
Civ. Evid. Rule 5.03(d)(1), and Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 5.03(d)(1), however, rarely will such 
information be privileged. 

3. Third, the lawyer may learn that a client intends prospective conduct that is criminal or 
fraudulent. The lawyer’s knowledge of the client’s purpose may enable the lawyer to prevent 
commission  of  the  prospective  crime  or  fraud.  When  the  threatened  injury  is  grave,  the 
lawyer’s  interest  in  preventing  the  harm  may  be  more  compelling  than  the  interest  in 
preserving confidentiality of information. As stated in sub-paragraph (c)(7), the lawyer has 
professional  discretion,  based  on  reasonable  appearances,  to  reveal  both  privileged  and 
unprivileged  information  in  order  to  prevent  the  client’s  commission  of  any  criminal  or 
fraudulent act. In some situations of this sort, disclosure is mandatory. See paragraph (e) and 
Comments 18-20. 

  1

4. The lawyers exercise of discretion under paragraphs (c) and (d) involves consideration of 
such factors as the magnitude, proximity, and likelihood of the contemplated wrong, the 
nature of the lawyer’s relationship with the client and with those who might be injured by the 
client, the lawyer’s own involvement in the transaction, and factors that may extenuate the 
client’s conduct in question. In any case a disclosure adverse to the client’s interest should be 
no greater than the lawyer believes necessary to the purpose. Although preventive action is 
 

23 

 

permitted by paragraphs (c) and (d), failure to take preventive action does not violate those 
paragraphs. But see paragraphs (e) and (f). Because these rules do not define standards of civil 
liability of lawyers for professional conduct, paragraphs (c) and (d) do not create a duty on the 
lawyer to make any disclosure and no civil liability is intended to arise from the failure to 
make such disclosure. 

5. A lawyer entitled to a fee necessarily must be permitted to prove the services rendered in 
an action to collect it, and this necessity is recognized by sub-paragraphs (c)(5) and (d)(2)(iv). 
This aspect of the rule, in regard to privileged information, expresses the principle that the 
beneficiary of a fiduciary relationship may not exploit the relationship to the detriment of the 
fiduciary. Any disclosure by the lawyer, however, should be as protective of the client’s 
interests as possible. 

6.  If  the  client  is  an  organization,  a  lawyer  also  should  refer  to  Rule  1.12  in  order  to 
determine the appropriate conduct in connection with this Rule. 

lient with Diminished Capacity 

7. When representing a client who may have diminished capacity, a lawyer should review 
Rule 1.16, which,  under limited circumstances, permits a  lawyer to disclose confidential 
information to protect the client’s interests. 

andatory Disclosure Adverse to Client 

8. Rule l.05(e) and (f) place upon a lawyer professional obligations in certain situations to 
make  disclosure  in  order  to  prevent  certain  serious  crimes  by  a  client  or  to  prevent 
involvement by the lawyer in a client’s crimes or frauds. Except when death or serious bodily 
harm is likely to result, a lawyer’s obligation is to dissuade the client from committing the 
crime or fraud or to persuade the client to take corrective action; see Rule 1.02 (d) and (e). 

9. Because it is very difficult for a lawyer to know when a client’s criminal or fraudulent 
purpose actually will be carried out, the lawyer is required by paragraph (e) to act only if the 
lawyer has information clearly establishing the likelihood of such acts and consequences. If 
the information shows clearly that the client’s contemplated crime or fraud is likely to result 
in death or serious injury, the lawyer must seek to avoid those lamentable results by revealing 
information necessary to prevent the criminal or fraudulent act. When the threatened crime or 
fraud is likely to have the less serious result of substantial injury to the financial interests or 
property of another, the lawyer is not required to reveal preventive information but may do so 
in conformity to paragraph (c) (7). See also paragraph (f); Rule 1.02 (d) and (e); and Rule 
3.03 (b) and (c). 

0. Although a violation of paragraph (e) will subject a lawyer to disciplinary action, the 
lawyer’s decisions whether or how to act should not constitute grounds for discipline unless 
the  lawyer’s  conduct  in  the  light  of  those  decisions  was  unreasonable  under  all  existing 
circumstances  as  they  reasonably  appeared  to  the  lawyer.  This  construction  necessarily 
follows from the fact that paragraph (e) bases the lawyer’s affirmative duty to act on how the 
situation reasonably appears to the lawyer, while that imposed by paragraph (f) arises only 

  1

  1

  C

  1

  M

  1

  1

  2

 

 

24 

when a lawyer “knows” that the lawyers services have been misused by the client. See also 
Rule 3.03(b). 

1. If the lawyer’s services will be used by the client in materially furthering a course of 
criminal or fraudulent conduct, the lawyer must withdraw, as stated in Rule l.l5(a)(l). After 
withdrawal, a lawyer’s conduct continues to be governed by Rule 1.05. However, the lawyer’s 
duties of disclosure under paragraph (e) of the Rule, insofar as such duties are mandatory, do 
not survive the end of the relationship even though disclosure remains permissible under 
paragraphs (6), (7), and (8) if the further requirements of such paragraph are met. Neither this 
Rule nor Rule 1.15 prevents the lawyer from giving notice of the fact of withdrawal, and no 
rule forbids the lawyer to withdraw or disaffirm any opinion, document, affirmation, or the 
like. 

2.  Various  other  Texas  Disciplinary  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  permit  or  require  a 
lawyer to disclose information relating to the representation. See Rules 1.07, 1.12, 2.02, 3.03 
and 4.01. In addition to these provisions, a lawyer may be obligated by other provisions of 
statutes or other law to give information about a client. Whether another provision of law 
supersedes Rule 1.05 is a matter of interpretation beyond the scope of these Rules, but sub-
paragraph (c)(4) protects the lawyer from discipline who acts on reasonable belief as to the 
effect of such laws. 

ermitted Disclosure or Use When the Lawyer Seeks Legal Advice 

3. A lawyer’s confidentiality obligations do not preclude a lawyer from securing confidential 
legal advice about the lawyer’s responsibility to comply with these Rules. In most situations, 
disclosing  or  using  confidential  information  to  secure  such  advice  will  be  impliedly 
authorized for the lawyer to carry out the representation. Even when the disclosure or use is 
not impliedly authorized, subparagraph (c)(9) allows such disclosure or use because of the 
importance of a lawyer’s compliance with these Rules. A lawyer who receives confidential 
information for the purpose of rendering legal advice to another lawyer or law firm under this 
Rule  is  subject  to  the  same  rules  of  conduct  regarding  disclosure  or  use  of  confidential 
information received in a confidential relationship.  

ule 1.06 Conflict of Interest: General Rule 

a) A lawyer shall not represent opposing parties to the same litigation. 

b) In other situations and except to the extent permitted by paragraph (c), a lawyer shall not 
represent a person if the representation of that person: 
 

(1)  involves  a  substantially  related  matter  in  which  that  person’s  interests  are 
materially and directly adverse to the interests of another client of the lawyer or the 
lawyers firm; or

(2) reasonably appears to be or become adversely limited by the lawyers or law firm's 
responsibilities to another client or to a third person or by the lawyers or law firm’s 
own interests. 

c) A lawyer may represent a client in the circumstances described in (b) if: 

(1)  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  the  representation  of  each  client  will  not  be 
materially affected; and 

(2) each affected or potentially affected client consents to such representation after 
full  disclosure  of  the  existence,  nature,  implications,  and  possible  adverse 
consequences of the common representation and the advantages involved, if any.  

d) A lawyer who has represented multiple parties in a matter shall not thereafter represent 
any of such parties in a  dispute among  the  parties arising out of the matter, unless prior 
consent is obtained from all such parties to the dispute. 

e)  If  a  lawyer  has  accepted  representation  in  violation  of  this  Rule,  or  if  multiple 
representation  properly  accepted  becomes  improper  under  this  Rule,  the  lawyer  shall 
promptly  withdraw  from  one  or  more  representations  to  the  extent  necessary  for  any 
remaining representation not to be in violation of these Rules. 

f) If a lawyer would be prohibited by this Rule from engaging in particular conduct, no other 
lawyer while a member or associated with that lawyer's firm may engage in that conduct. 

omment: 

oyalty to a Client 

. Loyalty is an essential element in the lawyer’s relationship to a client. An impermissible 
conflict  of  interest  may  exist  before  representation  is  undertaken,  in  which  event  the 
representation  should  be  declined.  If  such  a  conflict  arises  after  representation  has  been 
undertaken,  the  lawyer  must  take  effective  action  to  eliminate  the  conflict,  including 
withdrawal if necessary to rectify the situation. See also Rule 1.16. When more than one 
client is involved and the lawyer withdraws because a conflict arises after representation, 
whether the lawyer may continue to represent any of the clients is determined by this Rule 
and Rules 1.05 and 1.09. See also Rule 1.07(c). Under this Rule, any conflict that prevents a 
particular lawyer from undertaking or continuing a representation of a client also prevents any 
other lawyer who is or becomes a member of or an associate with that lawyer’s firm from 
doing so. See paragraph (f). 

. A fundamental principle recognized by paragraph (a) is that a lawyer may not represent 
opposing parties in litigation. The term opposing parties as used in this Rule contemplates a 
situation where a judgment favorable to one of the parties will directly impact unfavorably 
upon  the  other  party.  Moreover,  as  a  general  proposition  loyalty  to  a  client  prohibits 
undertaking  representation  directly  adverse  to  the  representation  of  that  client  in  a 
substantially related matter unless that client’s fully informed consent is obtained and unless 

 

 

26 

  (

 

 

  (

  (

  (

  C

  L

  1

  2

the lawyer reasonably believes that the lawyer’s representation will be reasonably protective 
of that client’s interests. Paragraphs (b) and (c) express that general concept. 

onflicts in Litigation 

.  Paragraph  (a)  prohibits  representation  of  opposing  parties  in  litigation.  Simultaneous 
representation of parties whose interests in litigation are not actually directly adverse but 
where the potential for conflict exists, such as co-plaintiffs or co-defendants, is governed by 
paragraph  (b).  An  impermissible  conflict  may  exist  or  develop  by  reason  of  substantial 
discrepancy in the party’s testimony, incompatibility in positions in relation to an opposing 
party or the fact that there are substantially different possibilities of settlement of the claims or 
liabilities in question. Such conflicts can arise in criminal cases as well as civil. The potential 
for conflict of interest in representing multiple defendants in a criminal case is so grave that 
ordinarily a lawyer should decline to represent more than one co-defendant. On the other 
hand,  common  representation  of  persons  having  similar  interests  is  proper  if  the  risk  of 
adverse effect is minimal and the requirements of paragraph (b) are met. Compare Rule 1.07 
involving intermediation between clients. 

onflict with Lawyers Own Interests 

.  Loyalty  to  a  client  is  impaired  not  only  by  the  representation  of  opposing  parties  in 
situations within paragraphs (a) and (b)(l) but also in any situation when a lawyer may not be 
able  to  consider,  recommend  or  carry  out  an  appropriate  course  of  action  for  one  client 
because  of  the  lawyer’s  own  interests  or  responsibilities  to  others.  The  conflict  in  effect 
forecloses  alternatives  that  would  otherwise  be  available  to  the  client.  Paragraph  (b)(2) 
addresses such situations. A potential possible conflict does not itself necessarily preclude the 
representation. The critical questions are the likelihood that a conflict exists or will eventuate 
and,  if  it  does,  whether  it  will  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  lawyer’s  independent 
professional  judgment  in  considering  alternatives  or  foreclose  courses  of  action  that 
reasonably should be pursued on behalf of the client. It is for the client to decide whether the 
client wishes to accommodate the other interest involved. However, the client’s consent to the 
representation by the lawyer of another whose interests are directly adverse is insufficient 
unless  the  lawyer  also  believes  that  there  will  be  no  materially  adverse  effect  upon  the 
interests of either client. See paragraph (c). 

. The lawyer’s own interests should not be permitted to have adverse effect on representation 
of a client, even where paragraph (b)(2) is not violated. For example, a lawyer’s need for 
income should not lead the lawyer to undertake matters that cannot be handled competently 
and at a reasonable fee. See Rules 1.01 and 1.04. If the probity of a lawyer’s own conduct in a 
transaction is in question, it may be difficult for the lawyer to give a client detached advice. A 
lawyer should not allow related business interests to affect representation, for example, by 
referring clients to an enterprise in which the lawyer has an undisclosed interest.

. Within the meaning of Rule 1.06(b), the representation of one client is directly adverse to 
the representation of another client if the lawyer’s independent judgment on behalf of a client 
or the lawyer’s ability or willingness to consider, recommend or carry out a course of action 
 

27 

 

will be or is reasonably likely to be adversely affected by the lawyer’s representation of, or 
responsibilities to, the other client. The dual representation also is directly adverse if the 
lawyer reasonably appears to be called upon to espouse adverse positions in the same matter 
or a related matter. On the other hand,  simultaneous representation in unrelated matters of 
clients whose interests are only generally adverse, such as competing economic enterprises, 
does  not  constitute  the    representation  of  directly  adverse  interests.  Even  when  neither 
paragraph (a) nor (b) is applicable, a lawyer should realize that a business rivalry or personal 
differences between two clients or potential clients may be so important to one or both that 
one or the other would consider it contrary to its interests to have the same lawyer as its rival 
even  in  unrelated  matters;  and  in  those  situations  a  wise  lawyer  would  forego  the  dual 
representation. 

ull Disclosure and Informed Consent 

.  A  client  under  some  circumstances  may  consent  to  representation  notwithstanding  a 
conflict or potential conflict. However, as indicated in paragraph (c)(l), when a disinterested 
lawyer  would  conclude  that  the  client  should  not  agree  to  the  representation  under  the 
circumstances,  the  lawyer  involved  should  not  ask  for  such  agreement  or  provide 
representation on the basis of the client’s consent. When more than one client is involved, the 
question of conflict must be resolved as to each client. Moreover, there may be circumstances 
where it is impossible to make the full disclosure necessary to obtain informed consent. For 
example, when the lawyer represents different clients in related matters and one of the clients 
refuses to consent to the disclosure necessary to permit the other client to make an informed 
decision, the lawyer cannot properly ask the latter to consent. 

8. Disclosure and consent are not formalities. Disclosure sufficient for sophisticated clients 
may not be sufficient to permit less sophisticated clients to provide fully informed consent. 
While it is not required that the disclosure and consent be in writing, it would be prudent for 
the  lawyer  to  provide  potential  dual  clients  with  at  least  a  written  summary  of  the 
considerations disclosed. 

9.  In  certain  situations,  such  as  in  the  preparation  of  loan  papers  or  the  preparation  of  a  
partnership agreement, a lawyer might have properly undertaken multiple representation and 
be  confronted  subsequently  by  a  dispute  among  those  clients  in  regard  to  that  matter. 
Paragraph (d) forbids the representation of any of those parties in regard to that dispute unless 
informed consent is obtained from all of the parties to the dispute who had been represented 
by the lawyer in that matter.  

10. A lawyer may represent parties having antagonistic positions on a legal question that has 
arisen in different cases, unless representation of either client would be adversely affected. 
Thus, it is ordinarily not improper to assert such positions in cases pending in different trial 
courts, but it may be improper to do so in cases pending at the same time in an appellate court.

11. Ordinarily, it is not advisable for a lawyer to act as advocate against a client the lawyer 
represents in some other matter, even if the other matter is wholly unrelated and even if 
paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) are not applicable. However, there are circumstances in which a 
lawyer may act as advocate against a client, for a lawyer is free to do so unless this Rule or 
another rule of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct would be violated. For 
 

28 

 

29 

example, a lawyer representing an enterprise with diverse operations may accept employment 
as an advocate against the enterprise in a matter unrelated to any matter being handled for the 
enterprise if the representation of one client is not directly adverse to the representation of the 
other  client.  The  propriety  of  concurrent  representation  can  depend  on  the  nature  of  the 
litigation. For example, a suit charging fraud entails conflict to a degree not involved in a suit 
for declaratory judgment concerning statutory interpretation. 

Interest of Person Paying for a Lawyers Service 

12. A lawyer may be paid from a source other than the client, if the client is informed of that 
fact and consents and the arrangement does not compromise the lawyer’s duty of loyalty to 
the client. See Rule 1.08(e). For example, when an insurer and its insured have conflicting 
interests in a matter arising from a liability insurance agreement, and the insurer is required to 
provide special counsel for the insured, the arrangement should assure the special counsel’s 
professional independence. So also, when a corporation and its directors or employees are 
involved  in  a  controversy  in  which  they  have  conflicting  interests,  the  corporation  may 
provide funds for separate legal representation of the directors or employees, if the clients 
consent  after  consultation  and  the  arrangement  ensures  the  lawyer’s  professional 
independence. 

on-litigation Conflict Situations 

3. Conflicts of interest in contexts other than litigation sometimes may be difficult to assess. 
Relevant  factors  in  determining  whether  there  is  potential  for  adverse  effect  include  the 
duration and intimacy of the lawyer’s relationship with the client or clients involved, the 
functions being performed by the lawyer, the likelihood that actual conflict will arise and the 
likely prejudice to the client from the conflict if it does arise. The question is often one of 
proximity and degree. 

4. For example, a lawyer may not represent multiple parties to a negotiation whose interests 
are fundamentally antagonistic to each other, but common representation may be permissible 
where the clients are generally aligned in interest even though there is some difference of 
interest among them. 

5. Conflict questions may also arise in estate planning and estate administration. A lawyer 
may be called upon to prepare wills for several family members, such as husband and wife, 
and,  depending  upon  the  circumstances,  a  conflict  of  interest  may  arise.  In  estate 
administration it may be unclear whether the client is the fiduciary or is the estate or trust 
including  its  beneficiaries.  The  lawyer  should  make  clear  the  relationship  to  the  parties 
involved. 

6. A lawyer for a corporation or other organization who is also a member of its board of 
directors should determine whether the responsibilities of the two roles may conflict. The 
lawyer  may  be  called  on  to  advise  the  corporation  in  matters  involving  actions  of  the 
directors. Consideration should be given to the frequency with which such situations may 
arise, the potential intensity of the conflict, the effect of the lawyer’s resignation from the  
board and the possibility of the corporations obtaining legal advice from another lawyer in 

 

 

  N

such  situations.  If  there  is  material  risk  that  the  dual  role  will  compromise  the  lawyer’s 
independence of professional judgment, the lawyer should not serve as a director. 

onflict Charged by an Opposing Party 

7.  Raising  questions  of  conflict  of  interest  is  primarily  the  responsibility  of  the  lawyer 
undertaking the representation. In litigation, a court may raise the question when there is 
reason to infer that the lawyer has neglected the responsibility. In a criminal case, inquiry by 
the court is generally required when  a  lawyer  represents  multiple  defendants. Where  the 
conflict is such as clearly to call in question the fair or efficient administration of justice, 
opposing counsel may properly raise the question. Such an objection should be viewed with 
great caution, however, for it can be misused as a technique of harassment. See Preamble: 
Scope. 

8. Except when the absolute prohibition of this rule applies or in litigation when a court 
passes upon issues of conflicting interests in determining a question of disqualification of 
counsel, resolving questions of conflict of interests may require decisions by all affected 
clients as well as by the lawyer. 

mputed  Conflicts,  Nonlawyer  Employees,  and  Lawyers  Formerly  Employed  in  a 
Nonlawyer Role 

9. A law firm is not prohibited from representing a client under paragraph (f) merely because 
a nonlawyer employee of the firm, such as a paralegal or legal secretary, has a conflict of 
interest arising from prior employment or some other source. Nor is a firm prohibited from 
representing a client merely because a lawyer of the firm has a conflict of interest arising from 
events that occurred before the person became a lawyer, such as work that the person did as a 
law clerk or intern. But the firm must ordinarily screen the person with the conflict from any 
personal participation in the matter to prevent the person’s communicating to others in the 
firm confidential information that the person and the firm have a legal duty to protect. See 
Rule 5.03; see also MODEL RULES PROF’L CONDUCT r. 1.10 cmt. 4 (AM. BAR ASS’N 1983); 
RESTATEMENT (THIRD)  OF  THE LAW GOVERNING LAWYERS § 123 cmt. f (AM. LAW INST. 
2000). 

ule 1.07 Conflict of Interest: Intermediary 

a) A lawyer shall not act as intermediary between clients unless: 

(1) the lawyer consults with each client concerning the implications of the common 
representation, including the advantages  and risks involved, and the effect on the 
attorney-client privileges, and obtains each client’s written consent to the common 
representation; 

(2)  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  that  the  matter  can  be  resolved  without  the 
necessity of contested litigation on terms compatible with the client’s best interests, 
that each client will be able to make adequately informed decisions in the matter and 
that there is little risk of material prejudice to the interests of any of the clients if the 
contemplated resolution is unsuccessful; and 

 

30 

  C

  1

  1

  I

  1

  R

  (

 

 

 

(3) the lawyer reasonably believes that the common representation can be undertaken 
impartially and without improper effect on other responsibilities the lawyer has to any 
of the clients. 

b) While acting as intermediary, the lawyer shall consult with each client concerning the 
decision to be made and the considerations relevant in making them, so that each client can 
make adequately informed decisions. 

c) A lawyer shall withdraw as intermediary if any of the clients so requests, or if any of the 
conditions stated in paragraph (a) is no longer satisfied. Upon withdrawal, the lawyer shall not 
continue to represent any of the clients in the matter that was the subject of the intermediation. 

d) Within the meaning of this Rule, a lawyer acts as intermediary if the lawyer represents two 
or more parties with potentially conflicting interests. 

e) If a lawyer would be prohibited by this Rule from engaging in particular conduct, no other 
lawyer while a member of or associated with that lawyer’s firm may engage in that conduct. 

omment: 

. A lawyer acting as intermediary may seek to establish or adjust a relationship between 
clients on an amicable and mutually advantageous basis. For example, the lawyer may assist 
in organizing a business in which two or more clients are entrepreneurs, in working out the 
financial reorganization of an enterprise in which two or more clients have an interest, in 
arranging a property distribution in settlement of an estate or in mediating a dispute between 
clients. The lawyer seeks to resolve potentially conflicting interests by developing the parties’ 
mutual  interests.  The  alternative  can  be  that  each  party  may  have  to  obtain  separate 
representation,  with  the  possibility  in  some  situations  of  incurring  additional  cost, 
complication or even litigation. Given these and other relevant factors, all the clients may 
prefer that the lawyer act as intermediary. 

. Because confusion can arise as to the lawyer’s role where each party is not separately 
represented, it is important that the lawyer make clear the relationship; hence, the requirement 
of written consent. Moreover, a lawyer should not permit his personal interests to influence 
his advice relative to a suggestion by his client that additional counsel be employed. See also 
Rule 1.06 (b). 

. The Rule does not apply to a lawyer acting as arbitrator or mediator between or among 
parties who are not clients of the lawyer, even where the lawyer has been appointed with the 
concurrence of the parties. In performing such a role the lawyer may be subject to applicable 
codes of ethics, such as the Code of Ethics for Arbitration in Commercial Disputes prepared 
by  a  joint  Committee  of  the  American  Bar  Association  and  the  American  Arbitration 
Association.

. In considering whether to act as intermediary between clients, a lawyer should be mindful 
that  if  the  intermediation  fails  the  result  can  be  additional  cost,  embarrassment  and 
recrimination. In some situations, the risk of failure is so great that intermediation is plainly 
 

31 

 

impossible. Moreover, a lawyer cannot undertake common representation of clients between 
whom  contested  litigation  is  reasonably  expected  or  who  contemplate  contentious 
negotiations. More generally, if the relationship between the parties has already assumed 
definite  antagonism,  the  possibility  that  the  client’s  interests  can  be  adjusted  by 
intermediation ordinarily is not very good. 

. The appropriateness of intermediation can depend on its form. Forms of intermediation 
range from informal arbitration, where each client’s case is presented by the respective client 
and  the  lawyer  decides  the  outcome,  to  mediation,  to  common  representation  where  the 
client’s  interests  are  substantially  though  not  entirely  compatible.  One  form  may  be 
appropriate in circumstances where another would not. Other relevant factors are whether the 
lawyer  subsequently  will  represent  both  parties  on  a  continuing  basis  and  whether  the 
situation involves creating a relationship between the parties or terminating one. 

onfidentiality and Privilege 

. A particularly important factor in determining the appropriateness of intermediation is the 
effect  on  client-lawyer  confidentiality  and  the  attorney-client  privilege.  In  a  common 
representation, the lawyer is still required both to keep each client adequately informed and to 
maintain confidentiality of information relating to the representation, except as to such clients. 
See Rules 1.03 and 1.05. Complying with both requirements while acting as intermediary 
requires a delicate balance. If the balance cannot be maintained, the common representation is 
improper. With regard to the attorney-client privilege, the general rule is that as between 
commonly represented clients the privilege does not attach. Hence, it must be assumed that if 
litigation  eventuates  between  the  clients,  the  privilege  will  not  protect  any  such 
communications, and the clients should be so advised. 

.  Since  the  lawyer  is  required  to  be  impartial  between  commonly  represented  clients, 
intermediation  is  improper  when  that  impartiality  cannot  be  maintained.  For  example,  a 
lawyer who has represented one of the clients for a long period and in a variety of matters 
might have difficulty being impartial between that client and one to whom the lawyer has only 
recently been introduced. 

onsultation 

. In acting as intermediary between clients, the lawyer should consult with the clients on the 
implications  of  doing  so,  and  proceed  only  upon  informed  consent  based  on  such  a 
consultation.  The  consultation  should  make  clear  that  the  lawyer’s  role  is  not  that  of 
partisanship normally expected in other circumstances. 

. Paragraph (b) is an application of the principle expressed in Rule 1.03. Where the lawyer is 
intermediary, the clients ordinarily must assume greater responsibility for decisions than when 
each client is independently represented. 

0. Under this Rule, any condition or circumstance that prevents a particular lawyer either 
from acting as intermediary between clients, or from representing those clients individually in 
connection with a matter after an unsuccessful intermediation, also prevents any other lawyer

who is or becomes a member of or associates with that lawyer’s firm from doing so. See 
paragraphs (c) and (e). 

ithdrawal 

1. In the event of withdrawal by one or more parties from the enterprise, the lawyer may 
continue to act for the remaining parties and the enterprise. See also Rule 1.06 (c) (2) which 
authorizes continuation of the representation with consent.  

ule 1.08 Conflict of Interest: Prohibited Transactions 

a) A lawyer shall not enter into a business transaction with a client unless: 

(1) the transaction and terms on which the lawyer acquires the interest are fair and 
reasonable  to the client and are fully disclosed in a manner which can be reasonably 
understood by the client; 

(2) the client is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent 
counsel in the transaction; and 

(3) the client consents in writing thereto. 

b) A lawyer shall not prepare an instrument giving the lawyer or a person related to the 
lawyer as a parent, child, sibling, or spouse any substantial gift from a client, including a 
testamentary gift, except where the client is related to the donee. 

c) Prior to the conclusion of all aspects of the matter giving rise to the lawyers employment, 
a lawyer shall not make or negotiate an agreement with a client, prospective client, or former 
client giving the lawyer literary or media rights to a portrayal or account based in substantial 
part on information relating to the representation. 

d) A lawyer shall not provide financial assistance to a client in connection with pending or 
contemplated litigation or administrative proceedings, except that:  
 

(1)  a  lawyer  may  advance  or  guarantee  court  costs,  expenses  of  litigation  or 
administrative proceedings, and reasonably necessary medical and living expenses, 
the repayment of which may be contingent on the outcome of the matter; and 

(2)  a lawyer representing an indigent client  may  pay court  costs  and  expenses  of 
litigation on behalf of the client. 

e) A lawyer shall not accept compensation for representing a client from one other than the 
client unless: 

(1) the client consents;

(2) there is no interference with the lawyers independence of professional judgment or 
with the client-lawyer relationship; and 

 

33 

(3) information relating to representation of a client is protected as required by Rule 
1.05. 

f) A lawyer who represents two or more clients shall not participate in making an aggregate 
settlement  of  the  claims  of  or  against  the  clients,  or  in  a  criminal  case  an  aggregated 
agreement  to  guilty  or  nolo  contendere  pleas,  unless  each  client  has  consented  after 
consultation,  including  disclosure  of  the  existence  and  nature  of  all  the  claims  or  pleas 
involved and of the nature and extent of the participation of each person in the settlement. 

g) A lawyer shall not make an agreement prospectively limiting the lawyer’s liability to a 
client for malpractice unless permitted by law and the client is independently represented in 
making the agreement, or settle a claim for such liability with an unrepresented client or 
former client without first advising that person in writing that independent representation is 
appropriate in connection therewith. 

h) A lawyer shall not acquire a proprietary interest in the cause of action or subject matter of 
litigation the lawyer is conducting for a client, except that the lawyer may: 

(1) acquire a lien granted by law to secure the lawyer’s fee or expenses; and 

(2) contract in a civil case with a client for a contingent fee that is permissible under 
Rule 1.04. 

i) If a lawyer would be prohibited by this Rule from engaging in particular conduct, no other 
lawyer while a member of or associated with that lawyer’s firm may engage in that conduct. 

j)  As  used  in  this  Rule,  “business  transactions”  does  not  include  standard  commercial

markets to others.

.  As  a  general  principle,  all  transactions  between  client  and  lawyer  should  be  fair  and 
reasonable to the client. In such transactions a review by independent counsel on behalf of the 
client is often advisable. Paragraph (a) does not,  however,  apply to standard commercial 
transactions between the lawyer and the client for products or services that the client generally 
markets  to  others,  such  as  banking  or  brokerage  services,  medical  services,  products 
manufactured or  distributed  by  the client, and utilities services.  In such  transactions,  the 
lawyer has no advantage in dealing, with the client, and the restrictions in paragraph (a) are 
unnecessary and impracticable.

3. A lawyer may accept a gift from a client, if the transaction meets general standards of 
fairness. For example, a simple gift such as a present given at a holiday or as a token of 
appreciation  is  permitted.  If  effectuation  of  a  substantial  gift  requires  preparing  a  legal 
instrument such as a will or conveyance, however, the client should have the detached advice 
that another lawyer can provide. Paragraph (b) recognizes an exception where the client is a 
relative of the donee or the gift is not substantial. 

iterary Rights 

. An agreement by which a lawyer acquires literary or media rights concerning the conduct 
of  representation  creates  a  conflict  between  the  interests  of  the  client  and  the  personal 
interests of the lawyer. Measures suitable in the representation of the client may detract from 
the publication value of an account of the representation. Paragraph (c) does not prohibit a 
lawyer representing a client in a transaction concerning literary property from agreeing that 
the lawyer’s fee shall consist of a share in ownership in the property, if the arrangement 
conforms to Rule 1.04 and to paragraph (h) of this Rule. 

erson Paying for Lawyers Services 

. Paragraph (e) requires disclosure to the client of the fact that the lawyers services are being 
paid for by a third party. Such an arrangement must also conform to the requirements of Rule 
1.05 concerning confidentiality and Rule 1.06 concerning conflict of interest. Where the client 
is a class, consent may be obtained on behalf of the class by court-supervised procedure. 
Where an insurance company pays the lawyer’s fee for representing an insured, normally the 
insured has consented to the arrangement by the terms of the insurance contract. 

rospectively Limiting Liability 

. Paragraph (g) is not intended to apply to customary qualification and limitations in legal 
opinions and memoranda. 

cquisition of Interest in Litigation 

.  This  Rule  embodies  the  traditional  general  precept  that  lawyers  are  prohibited  from 
acquiring a proprietary interest in the subject matter of litigation. This general precept, which 
has its basis in common law champerty and maintenance, is subject to specific exceptions 
developed in decisional law and continued in these Rules, such as the exception for contingent 
fees set forth in Rule 1.04 and the exception for certain advances of the costs of litigation set 
forth in paragraph (d). A special instance arises when a lawyer proposes to incur litigation or 
other expenses with an entity in which the lawyer has a pecuniary interest. A lawyer should 
not incur such expenses unless the client has entered into a written agreement complying with 
paragraph (a) that contains a full disclosure of the nature and amount of the possible expenses 
and the relationship between the lawyer and the other entity involved.

ule 1.09 Conflict of Interest: Former Client 

a) Without prior consent, a lawyer who personally has formerly represented a client in a 
matter shall not thereafter represent another person in a matter adverse to the former client: 
 

(1) in which such other person questions the validity of the lawyer's services or work 
product for the former client; 

(2) if the representation in reasonable probability will involve a violation of Rule 1.05; 
or 

(3) if it is the same or a substantially related matter. 

b) Except to the extent authorized by Rule 1.10, when lawyers are or have become members 
of or associated with a firm, none of them shall knowingly represent a client if any one of 
them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by paragraph (a). 

c) When the association of a lawyer with a firm has terminated, the lawyers who were then 
associated  with  that  lawyer  shall  not  knowingly  represent  a  client  if  the  lawyer  whose 
association with that firm has terminated would be prohibited from doing so by paragraph 
(a)(l) or if the representation in reasonable probability will involve a violation of Rule 1.05. 

omment: 

. Rule 1.09 addresses the circumstances in which a lawyer in private practice, and other 
lawyers who were, are or become members of or associated with a firm in which that lawyer 
practiced or practices, may represent a client against a former client of that lawyer or the 
lawyer’s former firm. Whether a lawyer, or that lawyer’s present or former firm, is prohibited 
from representing a client in a matter by reason of the lawyer’s successive government and 
private employment is governed by Rule 1.10 rather than by this Rule. 

. Paragraph (a) concerns the situation where a lawyer once personally represented a client 
and  now  wishes  to  represent  a  second  client  against  that  former  client.  Whether  such  a 
personal attorney-client relationship existed involves questions of both fact and law that are 
beyond the scope of these Rules. See Preamble: Scope. Among the relevant factors, however, 
would be how the former representation actually was conducted within the firm; the nature 
and scope of the former client’s contacts with the firm (including any restrictions the client 
may have placed on the dissemination of confidential information within the firm); and the 
size of the firm. 

. Although paragraph (a) does not absolutely prohibit a lawyer from representing a client 
against a former client, it does provide that the latter representation is improper if any of three 
circumstances exists, except with prior consent. The first circumstance is that the lawyer may 
not represent a client who questions the validity of the lawyer’s services or work product for 
the former client. Thus, for example, a lawyer who drew a will leaving a substantial portion of 
the testator’s property to a designated beneficiary would violate paragraph (a) by representing 
the testator’s heirs at law in an action seeking to overturn the will.

. Paragraph (a)’s second limitation on undertaking a representation against a former client is 
that it may not be done if there is a reasonable probability that the representation would cause 
the  lawyer  to  violate  the  obligations  owed  the  former  client  under  Rule  1.05.  Thus,  for 
example, if there were a reasonable probability that the subsequent representation would 
involve either an unauthorized disclosure of confidential information under Rule 1.05 (b) (l) 
or an improper use of such information to the disadvantage of the former client under Rule 
1.05 (b) (3), that representation would be improper under paragraph (a).  Whether such a 
reasonable probability exists in any given case will be a question of fact. 

A. The third situation where representation adverse to a former client is prohibited is where 
the representation involves the same or a substantially related matter. The "same" matter 
aspect of this prohibition prevents a lawyer from switching sides and representing a party 
whose interests are adverse to a person who sought in good faith to retain the lawyer. It can 
apply  even  if  the  lawyer  declined  the  representation  before  the  client  had  disclosed  any 
confidential information. This aspect of the prohibition includes, but is somewhat broader 
than, that contained in paragraph (a) (1) of this Rule. The "substantially related" aspect, on the 
other hand, has a different focus. Although that term is not defined in the Rule, it primarily 
involves situations where a lawyer could have acquired confidential information concerning a 
prior client that could be used either to that prior client's disadvantage or for the advantage of 
the  lawyer's  current  client  or  some  other  person.  It  thus  largely  overlaps  the  prohibition 
contained in paragraph (a)(2) of this Rule. 

. Paragraph (b) extends paragraph (a)’s limitations on an individual lawyer’s freedom to 
undertake a representation against that lawyer’s former client to all other lawyers who are or 
become members of or associated with the firm in which that lawyer is practicing. Thus, for 
example, if a client severs the attorney-client relationship with a lawyer who remains in a 
firm,  the  entitlement  of  that  individual  lawyer  to  undertake  a  representation  against  that 
former client is governed by paragraph (a); and all other lawyers who are or become members 
of or associated with that lawyers firm are treated in the same manner by paragraph (b). 
Similarly, if a lawyer severs his or her association with a firm and that firm retains as a client 
a person whom the lawyer personally represented while with the firm, that lawyer’s ability 
thereafter to undertake a representation against that client is governed by paragraph (a); and 
all other lawyers who are or become members of or associates with that lawyer’s new firm are 
treated in the same manner by paragraph (b). See also paragraph 19 of the comment to Rule 
1.06. 

. Paragraph (c) addresses the situation of former partners or associates of a lawyer who once 
had represented a client when the relationship between the former partners or associates and 
the  lawyer  has  been  terminated.  In  that  situation,  the  former  partners  or  associates  are 
prohibited from questioning the validity of such lawyers work product and from undertaking 
representation which in reasonable probability will involve a violation of Rule 1.05. Such a 
violation could occur, for example, when the former partners or associates retained materials 
in  their  files  from  the  earlier  representation  of  the  client  that,  if  disclosed  or  used  in 
connection with the subsequent representation, would violate Rule l.05(b)(l) or (b)(3). 

  4

. Thus, the effect of paragraph (b) is to (a) extend any inability of a particular lawyer under 
paragraph (a) to undertake a representation against a former client to all other lawyers who are 
 

37 

 

or become members of or associated with any firm in which that lawyer is practicing. If, on 
the other hand, a lawyer disqualified by paragraph (a) should leave a firm, paragraph (c) 
prohibits lawyers remaining in that firm from undertaking a representation that would be 
forbidden to the departed lawyer only if that representation would violate sub-paragraphs (a) 
(1) or (a) (2). Finally, should those other lawyers cease to be members of the same firm as the 
lawyer  affected  by  paragraph  (a)  without  personally  coming  within  its  restrictions,  they 
thereafter  may  undertake  the  representation  against  the  lawyer’s  former  client  unless 
prevented from doing so by some other of these Rules. 

. Although not required to do so by Rule 1.05 or this Rule, some courts, as a procedural 
decision, disqualify a lawyer for representing a present client against a former client when the 
subject matter of the present representation is so closely related to the subject matter of the 
prior representation that confidences obtained from the former client might be useful in the 
representation of the present client. See Comment 17 to Rule l.06. This so-called substantial 
relationship test is defended by asserting that to require a showing that confidences of the first 
client were in fact used for the benefit of the subsequent client as a condition to procedural 
disqualification would cause disclosure of the confidences that the court seeks to protect. A 
lawyer  is  not  subject  to  discipline  under  Rule  l.05(b)(l),  (3),  or  (4),  however,  unless  the 
protected information is actually used. Likewise, a lawyer is not subject to discipline under 
this Rule unless the new representation by the lawyer in reasonable probability would result in 
a violation of those provisions. 

. Whether the substantial relationship test will continue to be employed as a standard for 
procedural disqualification is a matter beyond the scope of these Rules. See Preamble: Scope. 
The possibility that such a disqualification might be sought by the former client or granted by 
a court, however, is a matter that could be of substantial importance to the present client in 
deciding whether or not to retain or continue to employ a particular lawyer or law firm as its 
counsel. Consequently, a lawyer should disclose those possibilities, as well as their potential 
consequences for the representation, to the present client as soon as the lawyer becomes aware 
of them; and the client then should be allowed to decide whether or not to obtain new counsel. 
See Rules 1.03(b) and 1.06(b). 

0. This Rule is primarily for the protection of clients and its protections can be waived by 
them.  A  waiver  is  effective  only  if  there  is  consent  after  disclosure  of  the  relevant 
circumstances,  including  the  lawyer’s  past  or  intended  role  on  behalf  of  each  client,  as 
appropriate. See Comments 7 and 8 to Rule 1.06. 

ule 1.10 Successive Government and Private Employment 

a) Except as law may otherwise expressly permit, a lawyer shall not represent a private 
client  in  connection  with  a  matter  in  which  the  lawyer  participated  personally  and 
substantially  as  a  public  officer  or  employee,  unless  the  appropriate  government  agency 
consents after consultation. 

b)  No  lawyer  in  a  firm  with  which  a  lawyer  subject  to  paragraph  (a)  is  associated  may 
knowingly undertake or continue representation in such a matter unless:

(2) written notice is given with reasonable promptness to the appropriate government 
agency. 

c)  Except  as  law  may  otherwise  expressly  permit,  a  lawyer  having  information  that  the 
lawyer knows or should know is confidential government information about a person or other 
legal entity acquired when the lawyer was a public officer or employee may not represent a 
private client whose interests are adverse to that person or legal entity.  

d)  After  learning  that  a  lawyer  in  the  firm  is  subject  to  paragraph  (c)  with  respect  to  a 
particular matter, a firm may undertake or continue representation in that matter only if that 
disqualified lawyer is screened from any participation in the matter and is apportioned no part 
of the fee therefrom. 

e) Except as law may otherwise expressly permit, a lawyer serving as a public officer or 
employee shall not: 
 

(1) Participate in a matter involving a private client when the lawyer had represented 
that  client  in  the  same  matter  while  in  private  practice  or  nongovernmental 
employment, unless under applicable law no one is, or by lawful delegation may be, 
authorized to act in the lawyer’s stead in the matter; or 

(2) Negotiate for private employment with any person who is involved as a party or as 
attorney for a party in a matter in which the lawyer is participating personally and 
substantially. 

f) As used in this rule, the term matter does not include regulation-making or rule-making 
proceedings or assignments, but includes: 
 

(1)  Any  adjudicatory  proceeding,  application,  request  for  a  ruling  or  other 
determination, contract, claim, controversy, investigation, charge accusation, arrest or 
other similar, particular transaction involving a specific party or parties; and  

(2) any other  action or transaction covered by  the  conflict of interest rules of the 
appropriate government agency. 

g) As used in this rule, the term confidential government information means information 
which has been obtained under governmental authority and which, at the time this rule is 
applied, the government is prohibited by law from disclosing to the public or has a legal 
privilege not to disclose, and which is not otherwise available to the public. 

h)  As  used  in  this  Rule,  Private  Client  includes  not  only  a  private  party  but  also  a 
governmental agency if the lawyer is not a public officer or employee of that agency.

politic were a private client. 

omment: 

. This Rule prevents a lawyer from exploiting public office for the advantage of a private 
client. 

. A lawyer licensed or specially admitted in Texas and representing a government agency is 
subject to the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct, including the prohibition 
against representing adverse interests stated in Rule 1.06 and the protection afforded former 
clients in Rule 1.09. In addition, such a lawyer is subject to this Rule and to statutes and 
government  regulations  regarding  conflict  of  interest.  Such  statutes  and  regulations  may 
circumscribe the extent to which the government agency may give consent under paragraph 
(a) of this Rule. 

. Where a public agency and a private client are represented in succession by a lawyer, the 
risk exists that power or discretion vested in public authority might be used for the special 
benefit of the private client. A lawyer should not be in a position where benefit to a private 
client might affect performance of the lawyer’s professional function on behalf of public 
authority. Also, unfair advantage could accrue to the private client by reason of access to 
confidential government information about the client’s adversary obtainable only through the 
lawyer’s government service. However, the rules governing lawyers presently or formerly 
employed  by  a  government  agency  should  not  be  so  restrictive  as  to  inhibit  transfer  of 
employment to and from the government. The government has a legitimate need to attract 
qualified lawyers as well as to maintain high ethical standards. The provisions for screening 
and waiver are necessary to avoid imposing too severe a deterrent against entering public 
service. Although screening is not defined, the screening provisions contemplate that the 
screened lawyer has not furnished and will not furnish other lawyers with information relating 
to the matter, will not have access to the files pertaining to the matter, and will not participate 
in any way as a lawyer or adviser in the matter. 

. When the client of a lawyer in private practice is an agency of one government, that agency 
is  a  private  client  for  purposes  of  this  Rule.  See  paragraph  (h).  If  the  lawyer  thereafter 
becomes an officer  or employee of an  agency of  another government,  as when a  lawyer 
represents a city and subsequently is employed by a federal agency, the lawyer is subject to 
paragraph (e). A lawyer who has been a public officer or employee of one body politic and 
who becomes a public officer or employee of another body politic is subject to paragraphs (a), 
(c) and (e). See paragraph (i). Thus, paragraph (i) protects a governmental agency without 
regard to whether the lawyer was or becomes a private practitioner or a public officer or 
employee. 

. Paragraphs (b)(l) and (d)(l) do not prohibit a lawyer from receiving a salary or partnership 
share  established  by  prior  independent  agreement.  They  prohibit  directly  relating  the 
attorney’s compensation to the fee in the matter in which the lawyer is disqualified. 

  C

. Paragraph (b)(2) does not require that a lawyer give notice to the governmental agency at a 
time  when  premature  disclosure  would  injure  the  client;  a  requirement  for  premature 
 

40 

 

disclosure might preclude engagement of the lawyer. Such notice is, however, required to be 
given as soon as practicable in order that the government agency or affected person will have 
a reasonable opportunity to ascertain  compliance with  Rule  1.10 and  to  take  appropriate 
action if necessary. 

. Paragraph (c) operates only when the lawyer in question has actual as opposed to imputed 

knowledge of the confidential government information. 

. Paragraphs (a) and (e) do not prohibit a lawyer from jointly representing a private party and 
a government agency when doing so is permitted by Rule 1.06 and is not otherwise prohibited 
by law. 

. Paragraph (e)(l) does not disqualify other lawyers in the agency with which the lawyer in 
question has become associated. Although the rule does not require that the lawyer in question 
be screened from participation in the matter, the sound practice would be to screen the lawyer 
to the extent feasible. In any event, the lawyer in question must comply with Rule 1.05. 

0. As used in paragraph (i), one body politic refers to one unit or level of government such as 
the federal government, a state government, a county, a city or a precinct. The term does not 
refer to different agencies within the same body politic or unit of government. 

ule 1.11 Adjudicatory Official or Law Clerk 

a) A lawyer shall not represent anyone in connection with a matter in which the lawyer has 
passed  upon  the  merits  or  otherwise  participated  personally  and  substantially  as  an 
adjudicatory  official  or  law  clerk  to  an  adjudicatory  official,  unless  all  parties  to  the 
proceeding consent after disclosure. 

b) A lawyer who is an adjudicatory official shall not negotiate for employment with any 
person who is involved as a party or as attorney for a party in a pending matter in which that 
official is participating personally and substantially. A lawyer serving as a law clerk to an 
adjudicatory official may negotiate for employment with a party or attorney involved in a 
matter in which the clerk is participating personally and substantially, but only after the clerk 
has notified the adjudicatory official. 

c) If paragraph (a) is applicable to a lawyer, no other lawyer in a firm with which that lawyer 
is associated may knowingly undertake or continue representation in the matter unless: 
 

(1) the lawyer who is subject to paragraph (a) is screened from participation in the 
matter and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and 

(2) written notice is promptly given to the other parties to the proceeding.

. This Rule generally parallels Rule 1.10. The term personally and substantially signifies that 
a judge who was a member of a multi-member court and thereafter left judicial office to 
practice law is not prohibited from representing a client in a matter pending in the court but in 
 

41 

 

which the former judge did not participate. So also the fact that a former judge exercised 
administrative responsibility in a court does not prevent the former judge from acting as a 
lawyer  in  matters  where  the  judge  had  previously  exercised  remote  or  incidental 
administrative responsibility that did not affect the merits. Compare the Comments to Rule 
1.10. 

. The term Adjudicatory Official includes not only judges but also comparable officials 
serving on tribunals, such as judges pro tempore, referees, special masters, hearing officers 
and other parajudicial officers, as well as lawyers who serve as part-time judges. Compliance 
provisions B(2) and C of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct provide that a part-time judge or 
judge pro tempore may not act as a lawyer in a proceeding in which he has served as a judge 
or in any other proceeding related thereto. Although phrased differently from this rule, those 
provisions correspond in meaning. 

. Some law clerks have not been licensed as lawyers at the time they commence service as 
law clerks. Obviously, paragraph (b) cannot apply to a law clerk until the clerk has been 
licensed as a lawyer. Paragraph (a) applies, however, to a lawyer without regard to whether 
the lawyer had been licensed at the time of the service as a law clerk, and once that law clerk 
is licensed as a lawyer and joins a firm, paragraph (c) applies to the firm. 

.  Paragraph  (c)  does  not  prohibit  a  lawyer  from  receiving  a  salary  or  partnership  share 
established  by  prior  independent  agreement.  It  prohibits  directly  relating  the  lawyer’s 
compensation to the fee in the matter in which the lawyer is disqualified. 

ule 1.12 Organization as a Client 

a) A lawyer employed or retained by an organization represents the entity. While the lawyer 
in the ordinary course of working relationships may report to, and accept direction from, an 
entity’s duly authorized constituents, in the situations described in paragraph (b) the lawyer 
shall  proceed  as  reasonably  necessary  in  the  best  interest  of  the  organization  without 
involving  unreasonable  risks  of  disrupting  the  organization  and  of  revealing  information 
relating to the representation to persons outside the organization. 

b) A lawyer representing an organization must take reasonable remedial actions whenever 
the lawyer learns or knows that: 
 

(1)  an  officer,  employee,  or  other  person  associated  with  the  organization  has 
committed or intends to commit a violation of a legal obligation to the organization or 
a violation of law which reasonably might be imputed to the organization; 

(2) the violation is likely to result in substantial injury to the organization; and 

(3) the violation is related to a matter within the scope of the lawyer’s representation 
of the organization.

  (

c) Except where prior disclosure to persons outside the organization is required by law or 
other Rules, a lawyer shall first attempt to resolve a violation by taking measures within the 
organization. In determining the internal procedures, actions or measures that are reasonably 
 

42 

 

necessary  in  order  to  comply  with  paragraphs  (a)  and  (b),  a  lawyer  shall  give  due 
consideration to the seriousness of the violation and its consequences, the scope and nature of 
the lawyers representation, the responsibility in the organization and the apparent motivation 
of the person involved, the policies of the organization concerning such matters, and any other 
relevant considerations. Such procedures, actions and measures  may  include, but are  not 
limited to, the following: 

(1) asking reconsideration of the matter; 

(2) advising that a separate legal opinion on the matter be sought for presentation to 
appropriate authority in the organization; and 

(3) referring the matter to higher authority in the organization, including, if warranted 
by the seriousness of the matter, referral to the highest authority that can act in behalf 
of the organization as determined by applicable law. 

d) Upon a lawyer’s resignation or termination of the relationship in compliance with Rule 
1.15, a lawyer is excused from further proceeding as required by paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), 
and any further obligations of the lawyer are determined by Rule 1.05. (e) In dealing with an 
organizations directors, officers, employees, members, shareholders or other constituents, a 
lawyer  shall  explain  the  identity  of  the  client  when  it  is  apparent  that  the  organization's 
interests are adverse to those of the constituents with whom the lawyer is dealing or when 
explanation appears reasonably necessary to avoid misunderstanding on their part. 

omment: 

he Entity as the Client 

. A lawyer employed or retained to represent an organization represents the organization as 
distinct from its directors, officers, employees, members, shareholders or other constituents. 
Unlike individual clients who can speak and decide finally and authoritatively for themselves, 
an  organization  can  speak  and  decide  only  through  its  agents  or  constituents  such  as  its 
officers or employees. In effect, the lawyer-client relationship must be maintained through a 
constituent who acts as an intermediary between the organizational client and the lawyer. This 
fact requires the lawyer under certain conditions to be concerned whether the intermediary 
legitimately represents the organizational client. 

. As used in this Rule, the constituents of an organizational client, whether incorporated or 
an  unincorporated  association,  include  its  directors,  officer,  employees,  shareholders, 
members, and others serving in capacities similar to those positions or capacities. This Rule 
applies not only to lawyers representing corporations but to those representing an organization 
such as an unincorporated association, union, or other, entity.  

.  When  one  of  the  constituents  of  an  organizational  client  communicates  with  the 
organizations lawyer in that person’s organizational capacity, the communication is protected 
by Rule 1.05. Thus, by way of example, if an officer of an organizational client requests its 
lawyers  to  investigate  allegations  of  wrongdoing,  interviews  made  in  the  course  of  that 
investigation between the lawyer and the client’s employees or other constituents are covered 
 

43 

 

   

 

 

  (

  C

  T

by Rule 1.05. The lawyer may not disclose to such constituents information relating to the 
representation except for disclosures permitted by Rule 1.05. 

larifying the Lawyers Role 

. There are times when the organizations interest may be or become adverse to those of one 
or more of its constituents. In such circumstances the lawyers should advise any constituent, 
whose interest the lawyer finds adverse to that of the organization of the conflict or potential 
conflict of interest, that the lawyer cannot represent such constituent, and that such person 
may  wish  to  obtain  independent  representation.  Care  should  be  taken  to  assure  that  the 
individual  understands  that,  when  there  is  such  adversity  of  interest,  the  lawyer  for  the 
organization  cannot  provide  legal  representation  for  that  constituent  individual,  and  that 
discussions between the lawyer for the organization and the individual may not be privileged 
insofar as that individual is concerned. Whether such a warning should be given by the lawyer 
for the organization to any constituent individual may turn on the facts of each case. 

. A lawyer representing an organization may, of course, also represent any of its directors, 
officers, employees, members, shareholders, or other constituents, subject to the provisions of 
Rule 1.06. If the organizations consent to the dual representation is required by Rule 1.06, the 
consent of the organization should be given by the appropriate official or officials of the 
organization other than the individual who is to be represented, or by the shareholders. 

ecisions by Constituents 

. When constituents of the organization make decisions for it, the decisions ordinarily must 
be accepted by the lawyer even if their utility or prudence is doubtful. Decisions concerning 
policy and operations, including ones entailing serious risk, are not as such in the lawyer’s 
province. However, different considerations arise when the lawyer knows, in regard to a 
matter within the scope of the lawyer’s responsibility, that the organization is likely to be 
substantially injured by the action of a constituent that is in violation of law or in violation of 
a legal obligation to the organization. In such circumstances, the lawyer must take reasonable 
remedial measure. See paragraph (b). It may be reasonably necessary, for example, for the 
lawyer  to  ask  the  constituent  to  reconsider  the  matter.  If  that  fails,  or  if  the  matter  is  of 
sufficient seriousness and importance to the organization, it may be reasonably necessary for 
the lawyer to take steps to have the matter reviewed by a higher authority in the organization. 
The stated policy of the organization may define circumstances and prescribe channels for 
such review, and a lawyer should encourage the formulation of such a policy. Even in the 
absence of organization policy, however, the lawyer may have an obligation to refer a matter 
to higher authority, depending on the seriousness of the matter and whether the constituent in 
question has apparent motives to act at variance with the organizations interest. At some point 
it may be useful or essential to obtain an independent legal opinion.

  5

. In some cases, it may be reasonably necessary for the lawyer to refer the matter to the 
organization’s  highest  responsible  authority.  See  paragraph  (c)(3).  Ordinarily,  that  is  the 
board of directors or similar governing body. However, applicable law may prescribe that 
under  certain  conditions highest  authority  reposes  elsewhere,  such  as  in  the  independent 
directors of a corporation. Even that step may be unsuccessful. The ultimate and difficult 
ethical question is whether the lawyer should circumvent the organization’s highest authority 
 

44 

 

when it persists in a course of action that is clearly violative of law or of a legal obligation to 
the  organization  and  is  likely  to  result  in  substantial  injury  to  the  organization.  These 
situations are governed by Rule 1.05; see paragraph (d) of this Rule. If the lawyer does not 
violate a provision of Rule 1.02 or Rule 1.05  by  doing  so,  the lawyer’s further  remedial 
action, after exhausting remedies within the organization, may include revealing information 
relating  to  the  representation  to  persons  outside  the  organization.  If  the  conduct  of  the 
constituent of the organization is likely to result in death or serious bodily injury to another, 
the lawyer may have a  duty  of revelation under  Rule l.05(e).  The lawyer may  resign,  of 
course, in accordance with Rule 1.15, in which event the lawyer is excused from further 
proceeding  as  required  by  paragraphs  (a),  (b),  and  (c),  and  any  further  obligations  are 
determined by Rule 1.05. 

elation to Other Rules 

. The authority and responsibility provided in this Rule are concurrent with the authority and 
responsibility provided in other Rules. In particular, this Rule is consistent with the lawyer’s 
responsibility under Rules 1.05, 1.08, 1.15, 3.03, and 4.01. If the lawyer’s services are being 
used by an organization to further a crime or fraud by the organization, Rule 1.02(c) can be 
applicable. 

overnment Agency 

. The duty defined in this Rule applies to governmental organizations. However, when the 
client  is  a  governmental  organization,  a  different  balance  may  be  appropriate  between 
maintaining  confidentiality  and  assuring  that  the  wrongful  official  act  is  prevented  or 
rectified, for public business is involved. In addition, duties of lawyers  employed by the 
government  or  lawyers  in  military  service  may  be  defined  by  statutes  and  regulations. 
Therefore, defining precisely the identity of the client and prescribing the resulting obligations 
of  such  lawyers  may  be  more  difficult  in  the  government  context.  Although  in  some 
circumstances the client may be a specific agency, it is generally the government as a whole. 
For example, if the action or failure to act involves the head of a bureau, either the department 
of which the bureau is a part or the government as a whole may be the client for purpose of 
this Rule. Moreover, in a matter involving the conduct of government officials, a government 
lawyer may have authority to question such conduct more extensively than that of a lawyer 
for a private organization in similar circumstances. This Rule does not limit that authority. 
See Preamble: Scope. 

erivative Actions 

0. Under generally prevailing law, the shareholders or members of a corporation may bring 
suit  to  compel  the  directors  to  perform  their  legal  obligations  in  the  supervision  of  the 
organization. Members of unincorporated associations have essentially the same right. Such 
an  action  may  be  brought  nominally  by  the  organization,  but  usually  is,  in  fact,  a  legal 
controversy over management of the organization. 

1. The question can arise whether counsel for the organization may defend such an action. 
The proposition that the organization is the lawyer’s client does not alone resolve the issue. 
Most derivative actions are a normal incident of an organization’s affairs, to be defended by 
 

45 

 

  R

  8

  G

  9

  D

  1

  1

the organization’s lawyer like any other suit. However, if the claim involves serious charges 
of  wrongdoing  by  those  in  control  of  the  organization,  a  conflict  may  arise  between  the 
lawyer’s  duty  to  the  organization  and  the  lawyer’s  relationship  with  those  managing  or 
controlling its affairs. 

ule 1.13. Conflicts: Public Interests Activities 

 lawyer serving as a director, officer or member of a legal services, civic, charitable or law 
reform  organization,  apart  from  the  law  firm  in  which  the  lawyer  practices,  shall  not 
knowingly participate in a decision or action of the organization: 

a) if participating in the decision would violate the lawyer’s obligations to a client under Rule 
1.06; or 

b) where the decision could have a material adverse effect on the representation of any client 
of the organization whose interests are adverse to a client of the lawyer.  

omment: 

. Lawyers are encouraged to serve as directors, officers or members of legal services, civic, 
charitable  or  law  reform  organizations,  and,  with  two  exceptions,  they  may  do  so 
notwithstanding  that  the  organization  either  itself  has  interests  adverse  to  a  client  of  the 
lawyer or else serves persons having such adverse interests.  

. When the lawyer is a director, officer or member of a legal services organization, further 
problems can arise when a client served by the organization has interests adverse to those of a 
client  served  by  the  lawyer.  A  lawyer-client  relationship  with  persons  served  by  the 
organization does not result solely from the lawyer’s service in those capacities. Nonetheless, 
if the lawyer were to participate in an action or decision of the organization concerning that 
representation, a real danger of having this quality of the organizational client’s representation 
being dictated by its adversary would be presented. To avoid that possibility, paragraph (b) 
prohibits a lawyer’s participation in actions or decisions of the organization that could have a 
material adverse effect on the representation of any client of the organization, if that clients 
interests are adverse to those of a client of the lawyer. 

. Law reform organizations (like civic and charitable organizations) generally do not have 
clients, in which event paragraph (b) does not apply. For reasons of public policy, it is not 
generally considered a conflict of interest for a lawyer to engage in law reform activities even 
though such activities are adverse to the interests of the lawyer’s private clients. A lawyer’s 
representation  of  a  client  does  not  constitute  an  endorsement  of  the  client’s  political, 
economic, social or moral views, nor does he forego his own. When the lawyer knows that the 
interests of a client may be materially benefited by a law reform decision in which the lawyer 
participates, the lawyer should disclose that fact but need not identify the client.

a) A lawyer shall hold funds and other property belonging in whole or in part to clients or 
third persons that are in a lawyer’s possession in connection with a representation separate 
 

46 

 

from the lawyer’s own property. Such funds shall be kept in a separate account, designated as 
a trust or escrow account, maintained in the state where the lawyers office is situated, or 
elsewhere  with  the  consent  of  the  client  or  third  person.  Other  client  property  shall  be 
identified as such and appropriately safeguarded. Complete records of such account funds and 
other property shall be kept by the lawyer and shall be preserved for a period of five years 
after termination of the representation.  

b) Upon receiving funds or other property in which a client or third person has an interest, a 
lawyer  shall  promptly  notify  the  client  or  third  person.  Except  as  stated  in  this  Rule  or 
otherwise permitted by law or by agreement with the client, a lawyer shall promptly deliver to 
the client or third person any funds or other property that the client or third person is entitled 
to  receive  and,  upon  request  by  the  client  or  third  person,  shall  promptly  render  a  full 
accounting regarding such property.  

c) When in the course of representation a lawyer is in possession of funds or other property 
in  which  both  the  lawyer  and  another  person  claim  interests,  the  property  shall  be  kept 
separate by the lawyer until there is an accounting and severance of their interest. All funds in 
a trust or escrow account shall be disbursed only to those persons entitled to receive them by 
virtue of the representation or by law. If a dispute arises concerning their respective interests, 
the portion in dispute shall be kept separate by the lawyer until the dispute is resolved, and the 
undisputed portion shall be distributed appropriately. 

omment: 

. A lawyer should hold property of others with the care required of a professional fiduciary. 
Securities should be kept in a safe deposit box, except when some other form of safekeeping 
is warranted by special circumstances. All property which is the property of clients or third 
persons should be kept separate from the lawyer’s business and personal property and, if 
monies,  in  one  or  more  trust  accounts.  Separate  trust  accounts  may  be  warranted  when 
administering estate monies or acting in similar fiduciary capacities. Paragraph (a) requires 
that complete records of the funds and other property be maintained. 

. Lawyers often receive funds from third parties from which the lawyer’s fee will be paid. 
These funds should be deposited into a lawyer’s trust account. If there is risk that the client 
may divert the funds without paying the fee, the lawyer is not required to remit the portion 
from which the fee is to be paid. However, a lawyer may not hold funds to coerce a client into 
accepting the lawyer’s contention. The disputed portion of the funds should be kept in trust 
and the lawyer should suggest means for prompt resolution of the dispute, such as arbitration. 
The undisputed portion of the funds should be promptly distributed to those entitled to receive 
them  by  virtue  of  the  representation.  A  lawyer  should  not  use  even  that  portion  of  trust 
account funds due to the lawyer to make direct payment to general creditors of the lawyer of 
the lawyer’s firm, because such a course of dealing increases the risk that all the assets of that 
account  will  be  viewed  as  the  lawyer’s  property  rather  than  that  of  clients,  and  thus  as 
available to satisfy the claims of such creditors. When a lawyer receives from a client monies 
that constitute a prepayment of a fee  and  that  belongs  to the client until  the services  are 
rendered, the lawyer should handle the fund in accordance with paragraph (c). After advising 
the client that the  service  has been  rendered  and the fee earned,  and  in the absence of a 

 

 

47 

  (

  (

  C

  1

  2

dispute, the lawyer may withdraw the fund from the separate account. Paragraph (c) does not 
prohibit participation in an IOLTA or similar program.  

.  Third  parties,  such  as  client’s  creditors,  may  have  just  claims  against  funds  or  other 
property in a lawyer’s custody. A lawyer may have a duty under applicable law to protect 
such third-party  claims against wrongful  interference  by the  client, and  accordingly  may 
refuse  to  surrender  the  property  to  the  client.  However,  a  lawyer  should  not  unilaterally 
assume to arbitrate a dispute between the client and the third party. 

. The obligations of a lawyer under this Rule are independent of those arising from activity 
other than rendering legal service. For example, a lawyer who serves as an escrow agent is 
governed by the applicable law relating to fiduciaries even though the lawyer does not render 
legal services in the transaction.  

. The client security fund in Texas provides a means through the collective efforts of the bar 
to reimburse persons who have lost money or property as a result of dishonest conduct of a 
lawyer.  

ule 1.15 Declining or Terminating Representation 

a) A lawyer shall decline to represent a client or, where representation has commenced, shall 
withdraw, except as stated in paragraph (c), from the representation of a client, if: 
 

(1) the representation will result in violation of Rule 3.08, other applicable rules of 
professional  conduct or other law; 

(2) the lawyer’s physical, mental or psychological condition materially impairs the 
lawyers fitness to represent the client; or 

(3) the lawyer is discharged, with or without good cause. 

b) Except as required by paragraph (a), a lawyer shall not withdraw from representing a 
client unless: 
 

(1) withdrawal can be accomplished without material adverse effect on the interests of 
the client; 

(2) the client persists in a course of action involving the lawyer’s services that the 
lawyer reasonably believes may be criminal or fraudulent; 

(3) the client has used the lawyer’s services to perpetrate a crime or fraud; 

(4) a client insists upon pursuing an objective that the lawyer considers repugnant or 
imprudent or with which the lawyer has fundamental disagreement; 

(5) the client fails substantially to fulfill an obligation to the lawyer regarding the 
lawyer’s services, including an obligation to pay the lawyer’s fee as agreed, and has 

  3

been given reasonable warning that the lawyer will withdraw unless the obligation is 
fulfilled; 

(6) the representation will result in an unreasonable financial burden on the lawyer or 
has been rendered unreasonably difficult by the client; or 

(7) other good cause for withdrawal exists. 

c) When ordered to do so by a tribunal, a lawyer shall continue representation 
notwithstanding good cause for terminating the representation. 

d) Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably 
practicable  to  protect  a  clients  interests,  such  as  giving  reasonable  notice  to  the  client, 
allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which 
the client is entitled and refunding any advance payments of fee that has not been earned. The 
lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent permitted by other law only if 
such retention will not prejudice the client in the subject matter of the representation. 

omment: 

.  A  lawyer  should  not  accept  representation  in  a  matter  unless  it  can  be  performed 
competently, promptly, and without improper conflict of interest. See generally Rules 1.01, 
1.06, 1.07, 1.08, and 1.09. Having accepted the representation, a lawyer normally should 
endeavor to handle the matter to completion. Nevertheless, in certain situations the lawyer 
must terminate the representation and in certain other situations the lawyer is permitted to 
withdraw. 

andatory Withdrawal 

. A lawyer ordinarily must decline employment if the employment will cause the lawyer to 
engage in conduct that the lawyer knows is illegal or that violates the Texas Disciplinary 
Rules of Professional Conduct. Rule 1.15(a)(1); cf. Rules 1. 02(c), 3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 3.04, 
3.08, 4.01, and 8.04. Similarly, paragraph (a)(l) of this Rule requires a lawyer to withdraw 
from employment when the lawyer knows that the employment will result in a violation of a 
rule of professional conduct or other law. The lawyer is not obliged to decline or withdraw 
simply because the client suggests such a course of conduct; a client may have made such a 
suggestion in the ill-founded hope that a lawyer will not be constrained by a professional 
obligation. Cf. Rule 1.02(c) and (d). 

. When a lawyer has been appointed to represent a client and in certain other instances in 
litigation, withdrawal ordinarily requires approval of the appointing authority or presiding 
judge.  See  also  Rule  6.01.  Difficulty  may  be  encountered  if  withdrawal  is  based  on  the 
client’s demand that the lawyer engage in unprofessional conduct. The tribunal may wish an 
explanation for the withdrawal, while the lawyer may be bound to keep confidential the facts 
that  would  constitute  such  an  explanation.  The  lawyer’s  statement  that  professional 
considerations  require  termination  of  the  representation  ordinarily  should  be  accepted  as 
sufficient. See also Rule 1.06(e).

Discharge 

. A client has the power to discharge a lawyer at any time, with or without cause, subject to 
liability for payment for the lawyer’s services, and paragraph (a) of this Rule requires that the 
discharged lawyer withdraw. Where future dispute about the withdrawal may be anticipated, 
it may be advisable to prepare a written statement reciting the circumstances. 

. Whether a client can discharge an appointed counsel depends on the applicable law. A 
client  seeking  to  do  so  should  be  given  full  explanation  of  the  consequences.  In  some 
instances the consequences may include a decision by the appointing authority or presiding 
judge  that  appointment  of  successor  counsel  is  unjustified,  thus  requiring  the  client  to 
represent himself. 

lient with Diminished Capacity 

.  If  a  client  lacks  the  legal  capacity  to  discharge  the  lawyer,  the  lawyer  may  in  some 
situations initiate proceedings for a conservatorship or similar protection of the client. See 
Rule 1.16. 

ptional Withdrawal 

.  Paragraph  (b)  supplements  paragraph  (a)  by  permitting  a  lawyer  to  withdraw  from 
representation  in  some  certain  additional  circumstances.  The  lawyer  has  the  option  to 
withdraw if it can be accomplished without material adverse effect on the client’s interests. 
Withdrawal  is  also  justified  if  the  client  persists  in  a  course  of  action  that  the  lawyer 
reasonably believes is criminal or fraudulent, for a lawyer is not required to be associated with 
such conduct even if the lawyer does not further it. A lawyer is not required to discontinue the 
representation until the lawyer knows the conduct will be illegal or in violation of these rules, 
at which point the lawyer’s withdrawal is mandated by paragraph (a)(l). Withdrawal is also 
permitted if the lawyer’s services were misused in the past. The lawyer also may withdraw 
where the client insists on pursuing a repugnant or imprudent objective or one with which the 
lawyer has fundamental disagreement. A lawyer may withdraw if the client refuses, after 
being duly warned, to abide by the terms of an agreement relating to the representation, such 
as an agreement concerning fees or court costs or an agreement limiting the objectives of the 
representation. 

. Withdrawal permitted by paragraph (b)(2) through (7) is optional with the lawyer even 
though the withdrawal may have a material adverse effect upon the interests of the client. 

ssisting the Client Upon Withdrawal 

. In every instance of withdrawal and even if the lawyer has been unfairly discharged by the 
client, a lawyer must take all reasonable steps to mitigate the consequences to the client. See 
paragraph (d). The lawyer may retain papers as security for a fee only to the extent permitted 
by law. 

0. Other rules, in addition to Rule 1.15, require or suggest withdrawal in certain situations. 

See Rules 1.01, 1.05 Comment 22, 1.06(e) and 1.07(c), 1.11(c), 1.12(d), and 3.08(a).

ule 1.16. Clients with Diminished Capacity  

a) When a client’s capacity to make adequately considered decisions in connection with a 
representation is diminished, whether because of minority, mental impairment, or for another 
reason,  the  lawyer  shall,  as  far  as  reasonably  possible,  maintain  a  normal  client-lawyer 
relationship with the client.  

b) When the lawyer reasonably believes that the client has diminished capacity, is at risk of 
substantial physical, financial, or other harm unless action is taken, and cannot adequately act 
in the client’s own interest, the lawyer may take reasonably necessary protective action. Such 
action may include, but is not limited to, consulting with individuals or entities that have the 
ability to take action to protect the client and, in appropriate cases, seeking the appointment of 
a guardian  ad  litem, attorney ad litem,  amicus attorney, or conservator, or submitting an 
information letter to a court with jurisdiction to initiate guardianship proceedings for the 
client.  

c)  When  taking  protective  action  pursuant  to  (b),  the  lawyer  may  disclose  the  client’s 
confidential information to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes is necessary to protect 
the client’s interests.  

omment: 

. The normal client-lawyer relationship is based on the assumption that the client, when 
properly  advised  and  assisted,  is  capable  of  making  decisions  about  important  matters. 
However, maintaining the ordinary client-lawyer relationship may not be possible when the 
client suffers from a mental impairment, is a minor, or for some other reason has a diminished 
capacity to make adequately considered decisions regarding representation. In particular, a 
severely  incapacitated  person  may  have  no  power  to  make  legally  binding  decisions. 
Nevertheless, a client with diminished capacity often can understand, deliberate on, and reach 
conclusions about matters affecting the client’s own well-being. For example, some people of 
advanced  age  are  capable  of  handling  routine  financial  matters  but  need  special  legal 
protection  concerning  major  transactions.  Also,  some  children  are  regarded  as  having 
opinions entitled to weight in legal proceedings concerning their custody. 

2. In determining the extent of the client’s diminished capacity, the lawyer should consider 
and balance such factors as the client’s ability to articulate reasoning leading to a decision, 
variability  of  state  of  mind,  and  ability  to  appreciate  consequences  of  a  decision;  the 
substantive  fairness  of  a  decision;  and  the  consistency  of  a  decision  with  the  lawyer’s 
knowledge of the client’s long-term commitments and values. 

 

 

3. The fact that a client suffers from diminished capacity does not diminish the lawyer’s 
obligation to treat the client with attention and respect. Even if the client has a guardian or 
other legal representative, the lawyer should, as far as possible, accord the client the normal 
status of a client, particularly in maintaining communication. If a guardian or other legal 
representative has been appointed for the client, however, the law may require the client’s 
lawyer  to  look  to  the  representative  for  decisions  on  the  client’s  behalf.  If  the  lawyer 
represents the guardian as distinct from the ward and is aware that the guardian is acting 
 

51 

 

  R

  (

  (

  (

  C

  1

adversely to the ward’s interest, the lawyer may have an obligation to prevent or rectify the 
guardian’s misconduct. 

4. The client may wish to have family members or other persons, including a previously 
designated trusted person, participate in discussions with the lawyer; however, paragraph (a) 
requires the lawyer to keep the client’s interests foremost and, except when taking protective 
action authorized by paragraph (b), to look to the client, not the family members or other 
persons, to make decisions on the client’s behalf. As part of the client in-take process, lawyers 
may  wish  to  give  new  clients  the  opportunity  to  designate  trusted  persons  who  may  be 
contacted by a lawyer if special needs arise. Any such procedure should provide sufficient 
information for the client to understand and confer with the lawyer about the designation of a 
trusted  person. Standardized  forms  may  be  available  from  bar  associations  and  practice 
groups. Information about trusted person designations should be appropriately safeguarded 
and periodically updated, as necessary. In matters involving a minor, whether the lawyer 
should look to the parents as natural guardians may depend on the type of proceeding or 
matter in which the lawyer is representing the minor. 

Taking Protective Action 

.  Paragraph  (b)  contains  a  non-exhaustive  list  of  actions  a  lawyer  may  take  in  certain 
circumstances  to  protect  an  existing  client  who  does  not  have  a  guardian  or  other  legal 
representative.  Such  actions  could  include  consulting  with  family  members,  using  a 
reconsideration  period  to  permit  clarification  or  improvement  of  circumstances,  using 
voluntary surrogate decision-making tools such as existing durable powers of attorney, or 
consulting  with support  groups, professional services, adult-protective  agencies, or other 
individuals or entities that have the ability to protect the client. In taking any protective action, 
the lawyer should be guided by such factors as the client’s wishes and values to the extent 
known, the client’s best interests, and the goals of intruding into the client’s decision-making 
autonomy to the least extent feasible, maximizing client capacities, and respecting the client’s 
family  and  social  connections.  If  it  appears  to  be  necessary  to  disclose  confidential 
information to a third person to protect the client’s best interests, a lawyer should consider 
whether  it  would  be  prudent  to  ask  for  the  client’s  consent  to  the  disclosure.  Only  in 
compelling cases should the lawyer disclose confidential client information if the client has 
expressly  refused  to  consent.  The  authority  of  a  lawyer  to  disclose  confidential  client 
information to protect the interests of the client is limited and extends no further than is 
reasonably necessary to facilitate protective action. 

uties Under Other Law 

6. Nothing in this Rule modifies or reduces a lawyer’s obligations under other law. 

. A client with diminished capacity also may cause or threaten physical, financial, or other 
harm to third parties. In such situations, the client’s lawyer should consult applicable law to 
determine the appropriate response. 

8. When a legal representative has not been appointed, the lawyer should consider whether an 
appointment is reasonably necessary to protect the client’s interests. Thus, for example, if a 
client with diminished capacity has substantial property that should be sold for the client’s 
 

52 

 

  5

  D

  7

 

 

 

 

benefit,  effective  completion  of  the  transaction  may  require  appointment  of  a  legal 
representative.  In  addition,  applicable  law  provides  for  the  appointment  of  legal 
representatives in certain circumstances. For example, the Texas Family Code prescribes 
when a guardian ad litem, attorney ad litem, or amicus attorney should be appointed in a suit 
affecting the parent-child relationship, and the Texas Estates Code prescribes when a guardian 
should  be  appointed  for  an  incapacitated  person.  In  many  circumstances,  however, 
appointment of a legal representative may be more expensive or traumatic for the client than 
circumstances in fact require. Evaluation of such circumstances is a matter entrusted to the 
lawyer’s professional judgment. In considering alternatives, the lawyer should be aware of 
any law that requires the lawyer to advocate on the client’s behalf for the action that imposes 
the least restriction. 

. Disclosure of the client’s diminished capacity could adversely affect the client’s interests. 
For example, raising the question of diminished capacity could, in some circumstances, lead 
to  proceedings  for  involuntary  commitment.  As  with  any  client-lawyer  relationship, 
information relating to the representation of a client is confidential under Rule 1.05. However, 
when the lawyer is taking protective action, paragraph (b) of this Rule permits the lawyer to 
make necessary disclosures. Given the risks to the client of disclosure, paragraph (c) limits 
what the lawyer may disclose in consulting with other individuals or entities or in seeking the 
appointment of a legal representative. At the very least, the lawyer should determine whether 
it is likely that the person or entity consulted will act adversely to the client’s interests before 
discussing  matters  related  to  the  client.  A  disclosure  of  confidential  information  may  be 
inadvisable if the third person’s involvement in the matter is likely to turn confrontational.

Emergency Legal Assistance 

10. In an emergency where the health, safety or a financial interest of a person with seriously 
diminished capacity is threatened with imminent and irreparable harm, a lawyer may take 
legal action on behalf of such a person even though the person is unable to establish a client-
lawyer relationship or to make or express considered judgments about the matter, when the 
person or another acting in good faith on that person’s behalf has consulted with the lawyer. 
Even in such an emergency, however, the lawyer should not act unless the lawyer reasonably 
believes that the person has no other lawyer, agent or other representative available. The 
lawyer  should  take  legal  action  on  behalf  of  the  person  only  to  the  extent  reasonably 
necessary to maintain the status quo or otherwise avoid imminent and irreparable harm. A 
lawyer who undertakes to represent a person in such an exigent situation has the same duties 
under these Rules as the lawyer would with respect to a client. 

11.  A  lawyer  who  acts  on  behalf  of  a  person  with  seriously  diminished  capacity  in  an 
emergency should keep the confidences of the person as if dealing with a client, disclosing 
them only to the extent necessary to accomplish the intended protective action. The lawyer 
should disclose to any tribunal involved and to any other counsel involved the nature of his or 
her relationship with the person. The lawyer should take steps to regularize the relationship or 
implement other protective solutions as soon as possible. Normally, a lawyer would not seek 
compensation for such emergency actions taken.

II. COUNSELOR 

n  advising  or  otherwise  representing  a  client,  a  lawyer  shall  exercise  independent 
professional judgment and render candid advice. 

ule 2.01 Advisor 

omment: 

cope of Advice 

. A client is entitled to straightforward advice expressing the lawyer’s honest assessment. 
Legal advice often involves unpleasant facts and alternatives that a client may be disinclined 
to confront. In presenting advice, a lawyer endeavors to sustain the client’s morale and may 
put advice in as acceptable a form  as honesty permits. However,  a lawyer should not be 
deterred from giving candid advice by the prospect that the advice will be unpalatable to the 
client. 

. Advice couched in narrow legal terms may be of little value to a client, especially where 
practical considerations, such as costs or effects on other people, are predominant. Purely 
technical legal advice, therefore, can sometimes be inadequate. It is proper for a lawyer to 
refer to relevant moral and ethical considerations in giving advice. Although a lawyer is not a 
moral advisor as such, moral and ethical considerations impinge upon most legal questions 
and may decisively influence how the law will be applied. 

. A client may expressly or impliedly ask the lawyer for purely technical advice. When such 
a request is made by a client experienced in legal matters, the lawyer may accept it at face 
value. When such a request is made by a client inexperienced in legal matters, however, the 
lawyer’s responsibility as advisor may include indicating that more may be involved than 
strictly legal considerations.  

.  Matters  that  go  beyond  strictly  legal  questions  may  also  be  in  the  domain  of  another 
profession.  Family  matters  can  involve  problems  within  the  professional  competence  of 
psychiatry, clinical psychology or social work; business matters can involve problems within 
the competence of the accounting profession or of financial specialists. Where consultation 
with a professional in another field is itself something a competent lawyer would recommend, 
the lawyer should make such a recommendation. At the same time, a lawyer’s advice at its 
best  often  consists  of  recommending  a  course  of  action  in  the  face  of  conflicting 
recommendations of experts. 

ffering Advice 

. In general, a lawyer is not expected to give advice until asked by the client. However, when 
a lawyer knows that a client proposes a course of action that is likely to result in substantial 
adverse legal consequences to the client, duty to the client may require that the lawyer act if 
the client’s course of action is related to the representation. A lawyer ordinarily has no duty to 
initiate investigation of a client’s affairs or to give advice that the client has indicated is

client's interest.

. In regard to a lawyer serving as intermediary for clients with conflicting interests, see Rule 

ule 2.02 Evaluation for Use by Third Persons 

  lawyer  shall  not  undertake  an  evaluation  of  a  matter  affecting  a  client  for  the  use  of 

someone other than the client unless: 

a) the lawyer reasonably believes that making the evaluation is compatible with other aspects 
of the lawyer's relationship with the client; and 

b) the client consents after consultation. 

omment: 

efinition 

. An evaluation may be performed at the client’s direction but for the primary purpose of 
establishing information for the benefit of third parties; for example, an opinion concerning 
the title of property rendered at the behest of a vendor for the information of a prospective 
purchaser, or at the behest of a borrower for the information of a prospective lender. In some 
situations, the evaluation may be required by a government agency; for example, an opinion 
concerning the legality of the securities registered for sale under the securities laws. In other 
instances, the evaluation may be required by a third person, such as a purchaser of a business. 

. Lawyers for the government may be called upon to serve as advisors or as evaluators. A 
lawyer for the government serves as advisor when the lawyer is an advocate for a government 
agency or is a counselor for a government agency. When serving as an advisor the rule of 
confidentiality of information applies. See Rule 1.05 and 2.01. 

. A lawyer for the government serves as evaluator when the lawyer’s official responsibility is 
to render opinions establishing the limits on authorized government activity. In that situation 
this Rule applies. 

. In addition to serving as advisors or as evaluators, lawyers may be called upon to serve as 
investigators. When serving as investigator, the identity of the client is critical, because only 
the client has a confidential relationship with the lawyer. See Rule 1.05. Thus, a lawyer who 
makes an investigative contact with a non-client in circumstances which might cause the non-
client to believe that the lawyer is representing him in the matter should make that non-client 
aware that rules concerning client loyalty and confidentiality are not applicable. See Rule 
1.05. See also Rule 1.12 (e).

Third Persons 

. When the evaluation is intended for the information or use of a third person, the evaluation 
involves a departure from the normal client-lawyer relationship. The lawyer must be satisfied 
as a matter of professional judgment that making the evaluation is compatible with other 
functions undertaken in behalf of the client. For example, if the lawyer is acting as advocate 
in defending the client against charges of fraud, it would normally be incompatible with that 
responsibility for the lawyer to perform an evaluation for others concerning the same or a 
related transaction. Assuming no such impediment is apparent, however, the lawyer should 
advise the client of the implications of the evaluation, particularly the lawyer's responsibilities 
to third persons and the duty to disseminate the findings. 

ccess to and Disclosure of Information 

. The quality of an evaluation depends on the freedom and extent of the investigation upon 
which it is based. Ordinarily a lawyer should have whatever latitude of investigation seems 
necessary as a matter of professional judgment. Under some circumstances, however, the 
terms of the evaluation may be limited. See Rule 1.02. For example, certain issues or sources 
may be categorically excluded, or the scope of search may be limited by time constraints or 
the non-cooperation of persons having relevant information. Any such limitations which are 
material to the evaluation should be described in the report. If after a lawyer has commenced 
an evaluation, the client refused to comply with the terms upon which it was understood the 
evaluation was to have been made, the lawyer’s obligations are determined by law, having 
reference to the terms of the client’s agreement and the surrounding circumstances. 
  
Financial Auditors Requests for Information 

. When a question concerning the legal situation of a client arises at the instance of the 
client’s financial auditor and the question is referred to the lawyer, any response by the lawyer 
should be made in accordance with procedures recognized in the legal profession. 
 

III. ADVOCATE

. The advocate has a duty to use legal procedure for the fullest benefit of the client’s cause, 
but also a duty not to abuse legal procedure. The law, both procedural and substantive, affects 
the limits within which an advocate may proceed. Likewise, these Rules impose limitations 
on the types of actions that a lawyer may take on behalf of his client. See Rules 3.02-3.06, 
4.01-4.04, and 8.04. However, the law is not always clear and never is static. Accordingly, in 
determining the proper scope of advocacy, account must be taken of the law's ambiguities and 
potential for change. 
 
 

56 

 

2. All judicial systems prohibit, at a minimum, the filing of frivolous or knowingly false 
pleadings,  motions  or  other  papers  with  the  court  or  the  assertion  in  an  adjudicatory 
proceeding of a knowingly false claim or defense. A filing or assertion is frivolous if it is 
made  primarily  for  the  purpose  of  harassing  or  maliciously  injuring  a  person.  It  also  is 
frivolous if the lawyer is unable either to make a good faith argument that the action taken is 
consistent with existing law or that it may be supported by a good faith argument for an 
extension, modification or reversal of existing law. 

. A filing or contention is frivolous if it contains knowingly false statements of fact. It is not 
frivolous, however, merely because the facts have not been first substantiated fully or because 
the lawyer expects to develop vital evidence only by discovery. Neither is it frivolous even 
though the lawyer believes that the client’s position ultimately may not prevail. In addition, 
this  Rule  does  not  prohibit  the  use  of  a  general  denial  or  other  pleading  to  the  extent 
authorized by applicable rules of practice or procedure. Likewise, a lawyer for a defendant in 
any criminal proceeding or for the respondent in a proceeding that could result in commitment 
may so defend the proceeding as to require that every element of the case be established. 

. A lawyer should conform not only to this Rules prohibition of frivolous filings or assertions 
but also to any more stringent applicable rule of practice or procedure. For example, the duties 
imposed on a lawyer by Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure exceed those set out 
in this Rule. A  lawyer must prepare all  filings  subject to  Rule  11 in  accordance  with its 
requirements. See Rule 3. 04(c)(1).  

ule 3.02 Minimizing the Burdens and Delays of Litigation 

n the course of litigation, a lawyer shall not take a position that unreasonably increases the 
costs or other burdens of the case or that unreasonably delays resolution of the matter. 

omment: 

. This Rule addresses those situations where a lawyer or the lawyer’s client perceive the 
client’s interests as served by conduct that delays resolution of the matter or that increases the 
costs or other burdens of a case. Because such tactics are frequently an appropriate way of 
achieving the legitimate interests of the client that are at stake in the litigation, only those 
instances  that  are  unreasonable  are  prohibited.  As  to  situations  where  such  tactics  are 
inconsistent with the client’s interests, see Rule 1.01. As to those where the lawyer’s conduct 
is motivated primarily by his desire to receive a larger fee, see Rule 1.04 and Comment, 
paragraph 6 thereto. 

. A lawyer’s obligations under this Rule are substantially fulfilled by complying with Rules 
3.01,  3.03,  and  3.04  as  supplemented  by  applicable  rules  of  practice  or  procedure.  See 
paragraph 4 to the Comment to Rule 3.01.  

nreasonable Delay 

.  Dilatory  practices  indulged  in  merely  for  the  convenience  of  lawyers  bring  the 
administration of justice into disrepute and normally will be unreasonable within the meaning 
of this Rule. See also Rule l.0l(b) and (c) and paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Comment thereto.

This Rule, however, does not require a lawyer to eliminate all conflicts between the demands 
placed on the lawyer’s time  by different clients  and  proceedings. Consequently, it is not 
professional misconduct  either to  seek (or as a matter  of professional courtesy,  to grant) 
reasonable delays in some matters in order to permit the competent discharge of a lawyer’s 
multiple obligations. 

. Frequently, a lawyer seeks a delay in some aspect of a proceeding in order to serve the 
legitimate interests of the client rather than merely the lawyer’s own interests. Seeking such 
delays is justifiable. For example, in order to represent the legitimate interests of the client 
effectively, a diligent lawyer representing a party named as a defendant in a complex civil or 
criminal action may need more time to prepare a proper response than allowed by applicable 
rules of practice or procedure. Similar considerations may pertain in preparing responses to 
extensive discovery requests. Seeking reasonable delays in such circumstances is both the 
right and the duty of a lawyer. 

. On the other hand, a client may seek to have a lawyer delay a proceeding primarily for the 
purpose of harassing or maliciously injuring another. Under this Rule, a lawyer is obliged not 
to take such an action. See also Rule 3.01. It is not a justification that similar conduct is often 
tolerated by the bench and the bar. The question is whether a competent lawyer acting in good 
faith would regard the course of action as having some substantial purpose other than delay 
undertaken for the purpose of harassing or malicious injuring. The fact that a client realizes a 
financial or other benefit from such otherwise unreasonable delay does not make that delay 
reasonable. 

nreasonable Costs and Other Burdens of Litigation 

. Like delay, increases in the costs or other burdens of litigation may be viewed as serving a 
wide range of interests of the client. Many of these interests are entirely legitimate and merit 
the most stringent protection. Litigation by its very nature often is costly and burdensome. 
This  Rule  does  not  subject  a  lawyer  to  discipline  for  taking  any  actions  not  otherwise 
prohibited by these Rules in order to fully and effectively protect the legitimate interests of a 
client that are at stake in litigation. 

. Not all conduct that increases the costs or other burdens of litigation, however, can be 
justified  in  this  manner.  One  example  of  such  impermissible  conduct  is  a  lawyer  who 
counsels  or  assists  a  client  in  seeking  a  multiplication  of  the  costs  or  other  burdens  of 
litigation as the primary purpose, because the client perceives himself as more readily able to 
bear those burdens than is the opponent, and so hopes to gain an advantage in resolving the 
matter unrelated to the merits of the clients position. 

ule 3.03 Candor Toward the Tribunal 

a) A lawyer shall not knowingly: 

(1) make a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal; 

(2) fail to disclose a fact to a tribunal when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a 
criminal or fraudulent act;

(3) in an ex parte proceeding, fail to disclose to the tribunal an unprivileged fact which 
the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  should  be  known  by  that  entity  for  it  to  make  an 
informed decision; 

(4) fail to disclose to the tribunal authority in the controlling jurisdiction known to the 
lawyer  to  be  directly  adverse  to  the  position  of  the  client  and  not  disclosed  by 
opposing counsel; or 

(5) offer or use evidence that the lawyer knows to be false. 

b) If a lawyer has offered material evidence and comes to know of its falsity, the lawyer shall 
make a good faith effort to persuade the client to authorize the lawyer to correct or withdraw 
the false evidence. If such efforts are unsuccessful, the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial 
measures, including disclosure of the true facts. 

c) The duties stated in paragraphs (a) and (b) continue until remedial legal measures are no 
longer reasonably possible. 

omment: 

. The advocate’s task is to present the client’s case with persuasive force. Performance of 
that duty while maintaining confidences of the client is qualified by the advocate’s duty of 
candor to the tribunal. 

actual Representations by Lawyer 

. An advocate is responsible for pleadings and other documents prepared for litigation, but is 
usually not required to have personal knowledge of matters asserted therein, for litigation 
documents ordinarily present assertions by the client, or by someone on the client’s behalf, 
and not assertions by the lawyer. Compare Rule 3.01. However, an assertion purporting to be 
on the lawyer’s own knowledge, as in an affidavit by the lawyer or a representation of fact in 
open  court,  may  properly  be  made  only  when  the  lawyer  knows  the  assertion  is  true  or 
believes it to be true on the basis of a reasonably diligent inquiry. There are circumstances 
where failure to make a disclosure is the equivalent of an affirmative misrepresentation. The 
obligation prescribed in Rule 1.02(c) not to counsel a client to commit or assist the client in 
committing a fraud applies in litigation. See the Comments to Rules 1.02(c) and 8.04(a).

. Legal argument based on a knowingly false representation of law constitutes dishonesty 
toward the tribunal. A lawyer is not required to make a disinterested exposition of the law, but 
should  recognize  the  existence  of  pertinent  legal  authorities.  Furthermore,  as  stated  in 
paragraph  (a)(4),  an  advocate  has  a  duty  to  disclose  directly  adverse  authority  in  the 
controlling jurisdiction which has not been disclosed by the opposing party. The underlying 
concept is that legal argument is a discussion seeking to determine the legal premises properly 
applicable to the case. 
 
 

59 

 

Ex Parte Proceedings 

. Ordinarily, an advocate has the limited responsibility of presenting one side of the matters 
that a tribunal should consider in reaching a decision; the conflicting position is expected to 
be  presented  by  the  opposing  party.  However,  in  an  ex  parte  proceeding,  such  as  an 
application for a temporary restraining order, there is no balance of presentation by opposing 
advocates. The object of an ex parte proceeding is nevertheless to yield a substantially just 
result.  The  judge  has  an  affirmative  responsibility  to  accord  the  absent  party  just 
consideration.  The  lawyer  for  the  represented  party  has  the  correlative  duty  to  make 
disclosures  of  unprivileged  material  facts  known  to  the  lawyer  if  the  lawyer  reasonably 
believes the tribunal will not reach a just decision unless informed of those facts. 

nticipated False Evidence 

. On occasion a lawyer may be asked to place into evidence testimony or other material that 
the lawyer knows to be false. Initially in such situations, a lawyer should urge the client or 
other  person  involved  to  not  offer  false  or  fabricated  evidence.  However,  whether  such 
evidence is provided by the client or by another person, the lawyer must refuse to offer it, 
regardless of the client’s wishes. As to a lawyer’s right to refuse to offer testimony or other 
evidence that the lawyer believes is false, see paragraph 15 of this Comment. 

.  If  the  request  to  place  false  testimony  or  other  material  into  evidence  came  from  the 
lawyer’s client, the lawyer also would be justified in seeking to withdraw from the case. See 
Rules l.l5(a)(l) and (b)(2), (4). If withdrawal is allowed by the tribunal, the lawyer may be 
authorized under Rule l.05(c)(7) to reveal the reasons for that withdrawal to any other lawyer 
subsequently retained by the client in the matter; but normally that Rule would not allow the 
lawyer to reveal that information to another person or to the tribunal. If the lawyer either 
chooses not to withdraw or is not allowed to do so by the tribunal, the lawyer should again 
urge the client not to offer false testimony or other evidence and advise the client of the steps 
the lawyer will take if such false evidence is offered. Even though the lawyer does not receive 
satisfactory assurances that the client or other witness will testify truthfully as to a particular 
matter,  the  lawyer  may  use  that  person  as  a  witness  as  to  other  matters  that  the  lawyer 
believes will not result in perjured testimony. 

ast False Evidence 

. It is possible, however, that a lawyer will place testimony or other material into evidence 
and only later learn of its falsity. When such testimony or other evidence is offered by the 
client, problems arise between the lawyer’s duty to keep the client’s revelations confidential 
and  the  lawyer’s  duty  of  candor  to  the  tribunal.  Under  this  Rule,  upon  ascertaining  that 
material testimony or other evidence is false, the lawyer must first seek to persuade the client 
to  correct  the  false  testimony  or  to  withdraw  the  false  evidence.  If  the  persuasion  is 
ineffective, the lawyer must take additional remedial measures. 

. When a lawyer learns that the lawyer’s services have been improperly utilized in a civil 
case to place false testimony or other material into evidence, the rule generally recognized is 
that the lawyer must disclose the existence of the deception to the court or to the other party, 
if necessary rectify the deception. See paragraph (b) and Rule 1.05(h). See also Rule l.05(g).

Such a disclosure can result in grave consequences to the client, including not only a sense of 
betrayal by the lawyer but also loss of the case and perhaps a prosecution for perjury. But the 
alternative is that the lawyer would be aiding in the deception of the tribunal or jury, thereby 
subverting the truth-finding process which the adversary system is designed to implement. 
See Rule 1.02(c). 

urthermore, unless it is clearly understood that the lawyer will act upon the duty to disclose 
the existence of false evidence, the client can simply reject the lawyer’s advice to reveal the 
false evidence and insist that the lawyer keep silent. Thus the client could in effect coerce the 
lawyer into being a party to fraud on the court. 

erjury by a Criminal Defendant 

. Whether an advocate for a criminally accused has the same duty of disclosure has been 
intensely debated. While it is agreed that in such cases, as in others, the lawyer should seek to 
persuade the client to refrain from suborning or offering perjurious testimony or other false 
evidence, there has been dispute concerning the lawyer’s duty when that persuasion fails. If 
the confrontation  with  the client occurs  before  trial,  the  lawyer  ordinarily can  withdraw. 
Withdrawal before trial may not be possible, however, either because trial is imminent, or 
because the confrontation with the client does not take place until the trial itself, or because no 
other counsel is available. 

0. The proper resolution of the lawyer’s dilemma in criminal cases is complicated by two 
considerations. The first is the substantial penalties that a criminal accused will face upon 
conviction, and the lawyer’s resulting reluctance to impair any defenses the accused wishes to 
offer  on  his  own  behalf  having  any  possible  basis  in  fact.  The  second  is  the  right  of  a 
defendant  to  take  the  stand  should  he  so  desire,  even  over  the  objections  of  the  lawyer. 
Consequently, in any criminal case where the accused either insists on testifying when the 
lawyer knows that the testimony is perjurious or else surprises the lawyer with such testimony 
at trial, the lawyer’s effort to rectify the situation can increase the likelihood of the client’s 
being convicted as well as opening the possibility of a prosecution for perjury. On the other 
hand, if the lawyer does not exercise control over the proof, the lawyer participates, although 
in a merely passive way, in deception of the court. 

1. Three resolutions of this dilemma have been proposed. One is to permit the accused to 
testify by a narrative without guidance through the lawyer's questioning. This compromises 
both contending principles; it exempts the lawyer from the duty to disclose false evidence but 
subjects  the  client  to  an  implicit  disclosure  of  information  imparted  to  counsel.  Another 
suggested resolution is that the advocate be entirely excused from the duty to reveal perjury if 
the  perjury  is  that  of  the  client.  This  solution,  however,  makes  the  advocate  a  knowing 
instrument of perjury. 

2. The other resolution of the dilemma, and the one this Rule adopts, is that the lawyer must 
take  a  reasonable  remedial  measure  which  may  include  revealing  the  client’s  perjury.  A 
criminal accused has a right to the assistance of an advocate, a right to testify and a right of 
confidential communication with counsel. However, an accused should not have a right to 
assistance of counsel in committing perjury. Furthermore, an advocate has an obligation, not 

  F

61 

only in professional ethics but under the law as well, to avoid implication in the commission 
of perjury or other falsification of evidence. 

alse Evidence Not Introduced by the Lawyer 

3. A lawyer may have introduced the testimony of a client or other witness who testified 
truthfully under direct examination, but who offered false testimony or other evidence during 
examination by another party. Although the lawyer should urge that the false evidence be 
corrected or withdrawn, the full range of obligation imposed by paragraphs (a)(5) and (b) of 
this Rule do not apply to such situations. A subsequent use of that false testimony or other 
evidence by the lawyer in support of the client’s case, however, would violate paragraph 
(a)(5). 

uration of Obligation 

4. The time limit on the obligation to rectify the presentation of false testimony or other 
evidence varies from case to case but continues as long as there is a reasonable possibility of 
taking corrective legal actions before a tribunal.  

efusing to Offer Proof Believed to be False 

5.  A  lawyer  may  refuse  to  offer  evidence  that  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  is 
untrustworthy, even if the lawyer does not know that the evidence is false. That discretion 
should be exercised cautiously, however, in order not to impair the legitimate interests of the 
client. Where a client wishes to have such suspect evidence introduced, generally the lawyer 
should do so and allow the finder of fact to assess its probative value. A lawyer’s obligations 
under paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(5) and (b) of this Rule are not triggered by the introduction of 
testimony or other evidence that is believed by the lawyer to be false, but not known to be so. 

ule 3.04 Fairness in Adjudicatory Proceedings 

 lawyer shall not: 

a)  unlawfully  obstruct  another  party’s  access  to  evidence;  in  anticipation  of  a  dispute 
unlawfully alter, destroy or conceal a document or other material that a competent lawyer 
would believe has potential or actual evidentiary value; or counsel or assist another person to 
do any such act. 

b) falsify evidence, counsel or assist a witness to testify falsely, or pay, offer to pay, or 
acquiesce in the offer or payment of compensation to a witness or other entity contingent 
upon the content of the testimony of the witness or the outcome of the case. But a lawyer may 
advance, guarantee, or acquiesce in the payment of: 

(1) expenses reasonably incurred by a witness in attending or testifying; 

(2) reasonable compensation to a witness for his loss of time in attending or testifying; 

(3) a reasonable fee for the professional services of an expert witness.

(1) habitually violate an established rule of procedure or of evidence; 

(2) state or allude to any matter that the lawyer does not reasonably believe is relevant 
to such proceeding or that will not be supported by admissible evidence, or assert 
personal knowledge of facts in issue except when testifying as a witness;  

(3) state a personal opinion as to the justness of a cause, the credibility of a witness, 
the culpability of a civil litigant or the guilt or innocence of an accused, except that a 
lawyer may argue on his analysis of the evidence and other permissible considerations 
for any position or conclusion with respect to the matters stated herein; 

(4) ask any question intended to degrade a witness or other person except where the 
lawyer  reasonably  believes  that  the  question  will  lead  to  relevant  and  admissible 
evidence; or 

(5) engage in conduct intended to disrupt the proceedings. 

d) knowingly disobey, or advise the client to disobey, an obligation under the standing rules 
of or a ruling by a tribunal except for an open refusal based either on an assertion that no valid 
obligation exists or on the client’s willingness to accept any  sanctions arising  from such 
disobedience. 

e) request a person other than a client to refrain from voluntarily giving relevant information 
to another party unless: 

(1) the person is a relative or an employee or other agent of a client; and 

(2) the lawyer reasonably believes that the person’s interests will not be adversely 
affected by refraining from giving such information. 

omment: 

. The procedure of the adversary system contemplates that the evidence in a case is to be 
marshalled competitively by the contending parties. Fair competition in the adversary system 
is  secured  by  prohibitions  against  destruction  or  concealment  of  evidence,  improperly 
influencing witnesses, obstructive tactics in discovery procedures, and the like. 

. Documents and other evidence are often essential to establish a claim or defense. The right 
of a party, including the government, to obtain evidence through discovery or subpoena is an 
important procedural right. The exercise of that right can be frustrated if relevant material is 
altered, concealed or destroyed. Applicable law in many jurisdictions, including Texas, makes 
it an offense to destroy material for the purpose of impairing its availability in a pending 
proceeding  or  one  whose  commencement  can  be  foreseen.  See  Texas  Penal  Code, 
§§37.09(a)(1),  37.10(a)(3).  See  also  18  U.S.C.  §§1501-1515.  Falsifying  evidence  is  also

generally a criminal offense. Id. §§37.09(a)(2), 37.10 (a)(l), (2). Paragraph (a) of this Rule 
applies to evidentiary material generally, including computerized information. 

. Paragraph (c)(l) subjects a lawyer to discipline only for habitual abuses of procedural or 
evidentiary rules, including those relating to the discovery process. That position was adopted 
in order to employ the superior ability of the presiding tribunal to assess the merits of such 
disputes and to avoid inappropriate resort to disciplinary proceedings as a means of furthering 
tactical litigation objectives. A lawyer in good conscience should not engage in even a single 
intentional violation of those rules, however, and a lawyer may be subject to judicial sanctions 
for doing so. 

. Paragraph (c) restates the traditional Texas position regarding the proper role of argument 
and comment in litigation. The obligations imposed by that paragraph to avoid seeking to 
influence the outcome of a matter by introducing irrelevant or improper considerations into 
the deliberative process are important aspects of a lawyer’s duty to maintain the fairness and 
impartiality of adjudicatory proceedings. 

. By the same token, the advocates function is to present evidence and argument so that the 
cause may be decided according to law. Refraining from abusive or disruptive conduct is a 
corollary of the advocates right to speak on behalf of litigants. A lawyer may stand firm 
against abuse by a tribunal but should avoid reciprocation.  

. Paragraph (d) prohibits the practice of a lawyer not disclosing a client’s actual or intended 
noncompliance with a standing rule or particular ruling of an adjudicatory body or official to 
other  concerned  entities.  It  provides  instead  that  a  lawyer  must  openly  acknowledge  the 
client’s noncompliance. 

. Paragraph (d) also prohibits a lawyer from disobeying, or advising a client to disobey, any 
such obligations unless either of two circumstances exists. The first is the lawyer’s open 
refusal based on an assertion that no valid obligation exists. In order to assure due regard for 
formal rulings and standing rules of practice or procedure, the lawyers assertion in this regard 
should  be  based  on  a  reasonable  belief.  The  second  circumstance  is  that  a  lawyer  may 
acquiesce in a client’s position that the sanctions arising from noncompliance are preferable to 
the costs of compliance. This situation can arise in criminal cases, for example, where the 
court orders disclosure of the identity of an informant to the defendant and the government 
decides  that  it  would  prefer  to  allow  the  case  to  be  dismissed  rather  than  to  make  that 
disclosure. A lawyer should consult with a client about the likely consequences of any such 
act of disobedience should the client appear to be inclined to pursue that course; but the final 
decision in that regard rests with the client.

will be so selected. 

omment: 

ndue Influence 

. Many forms of improper influence upon tribunals are proscribed by criminal law or by 
applicable rules of practice or procedure. Others are specified in the Texas Code of Judicial 
Conduct. A lawyer is required to be familiar with, and to avoid contributing to a violation of, 
all such provisions. See also Rule 3.06. 

. In recent years, however, there has been an increase in alternative methods of dispute 
resolution, such as arbitration, for which the standards governing a lawyer’s conduct are not 
as well developed. In such situations, as in more traditional settings, a lawyer should avoid 
any  conduct  that  is  or  could  reasonably  be  construed  as  being  intended  to  corrupt  or  to 
unfairly influence the decision-maker. 

x Parte Contacts 

. Historically, ex parte contacts between a lawyer and a tribunal have been subjected to 
stringent control because of the potential for abuse such contacts present. For example, Canon 
3A(4) of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct prohibits many ex parte contacts with judicial 
officials. A lawyer in turn violates Rule 8.04(a)(6) by communicating with such an official in 
a manner that causes that official to violate Canon 3A(4). This rule maintains that traditional 
posture towards ex parte communications and extends it to the new settings discussed in 
paragraph 2 of this Comment.  

.  There  are  certain  types  of  adjudicatory  proceedings,  however,  which  have  permitted 
pending issues to be discussed ex parte with a tribunal. Certain classes of zoning questions, 
for example, are frequently handled in that way. As long as such contacts are not prohibited

by law or applicable rules of practice or procedure, and as long as paragraph (a) of this Rule is 
adhered to, such ex parte contacts will not serve as a basis for discipline. 

. For limitations on the circumstances and the manner in which lawyers may communicate or 
cause another to communicate with veniremen or jurors, see Rule 3.06.  

l) conduct or cause another, by financial support or otherwise, to conduct a vexatious 
or harassing investigation of a venireman or juror; or 

(2) seek to influence a venireman or juror concerning the merits of a pending matter 
by means prohibited by law or applicable rules of practice or procedure. 

b) Prior to discharge of the jury from further consideration of a matter, a lawyer connected 
therewith shall not communicate with or cause another to communicate with anyone he knows 
to be a member of the venire from which the jury will be selected or any juror or alternate 
juror, except in the course of official proceedings. 

c) During the trial of a case, a lawyer not connected therewith shall not communicate with or 
cause another to communicate with a juror or alternate juror concerning the matter. 

d) After discharge of the jury from further consideration of a matter with which the lawyer 
was connected, the lawyer shall not ask questions of or make comments to a member of that 
jury that are calculated merely to harass or embarrass the juror or to influence his actions in 
future jury service. 

e) All restrictions imposed by this Rule upon a lawyer also apply to communications with or 
investigations of members of a family of a venireman or a juror. 

f) A lawyer shall reveal promptly to the court improper conduct by a venireman or a juror, or 
by another toward a venireman or a juror or a member of his family, of which the lawyer has 
knowledge.

. To safeguard the impartiality that is essential to the judicial process, veniremen and jurors 
should  be  protected  against  extraneous  influences.  When  impartiality  is  present,  public 
confidence  in  the  judicial  system  is  enhanced.  There  should  be  no  extrajudicial 
communication with veniremen prior to trial or with jurors during trial or on behalf of a 
lawyer connected with the case. Furthermore, a lawyer who is not connected with the case 
should not communicate with or cause another to communicate with a venireman or a juror 
about the case. After the trial, communication by a lawyer with jurors is not prohibited by this 
 

66 

 

Rule so long as he refrains from asking questions or making comments that tend to harass or 
embarrass  the  juror  or  to  influence  actions  of  the  juror  in  future  cases.  Contacts  with 
discharged jurors, however, are governed by procedural rules the violation of which could 
subject a lawyer to discipline under Rule 3.04. When an extrajudicial communication by a 
lawyer with a juror is permitted by law, it should be made considerately and with deference to 
the personal feelings of the juror. 
  
2. Vexatious or harassing investigations of jurors seriously impair the effectiveness of our 
jury system. For this reason, a lawyer or anyone on his behalf who conducts an investigation 
of veniremen or jurors should act with circumspection and restraint. 

. Communications with or investigations of members of families of veniremen or jurors by a 
lawyer or by any one on his behalf are subject to the restrictions imposed upon the lawyer 
with respect to his communications with or investigations of veniremen and jurors. 

. Because of the extremely serious nature of any actions that threaten the integrity of the jury 
system, a lawyer who learns of improper conduct by or towards a venireman, a juror, or a 
member of the family of either should make a prompt report to the court regarding such 
conduct. If such improper actions were taken by or on behalf of a lawyer, either the reporting 
lawyer or the court normally should initiate appropriate disciplinary proceedings. See Rules 
1.05, 8.03, 8.04.  

ule 3.07 Trial Publicity 

a) In the course of representing a client, a lawyer shall not make an extrajudicial statement 
that a reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by means of public communication 
if the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that it will have a substantial likelihood of 
materially  prejudicing  an  adjudicatory  proceeding.  A  lawyer  shall  not  counsel  or  assist 
another person to make such a statement.  

b) A lawyer ordinarily will violate paragraph (a), and the likelihood of a violation increases if 
the adjudication is ongoing or imminent, by making an extrajudicial statement of the type 
referred to in that paragraph when the statement refers to:  
 

(1) the character, credibility, reputation or criminal record of a party, suspect in a 
criminal investigation or witness; or the expected testimony of a party or witness; 

(2) in a criminal case or proceeding that could result in incarceration, the possibility of 
a plea of guilty to the offense; the existence or contents of any confession, admission, 
or statement given by a defendant or suspect; or that person’s refusal or failure to 
make a statement; 

(3) the performance, refusal to perform, or results of any examination or test; the 
refusal or failure of a person to allow or submit to an examination or test; or the 
identity or nature of physical evidence expected to be presented;

(5)  information  the  lawyer  knows  or  reasonably  should  know  is  likely  to  be 
inadmissible as evidence in a trial and would if disclosed create a substantial risk of 
prejudicing an impartial trial. 

c) A lawyer ordinarily will not violate paragraph (a) by making an extrajudicial statement of 
the type referred to in that paragraph when the lawyer merely states: 

(1) the general nature of the claim or defense; 

(2) the information contained in a public record; 

(3) that an investigation of the matter is in progress, including the general scope of the 
investigation, the offense, claim or defense involved; 

(4) except when prohibited by law, the identity of the persons involved in the matter; 

(5) the scheduling or result of any step in litigation; 

(6) a request for assistance in obtaining evidence, and information necessary thereto; 

(7) a warning of danger concerning the behavior of a person involved, when there is a 
reason to believe that there exists the likelihood of substantial harm to an individual or 
to the public interest; and 

(8) if a criminal case: 

(i) the identity, residence, occupation and family status of the accused; 

(ii) if the accused has not been apprehended, information necessary to aid in 
apprehension of that person; 

(iii) the fact, time and place of arrest; and 

(iv) the identity of investigating and arresting officers or agencies and the 
length of the investigation.

. Paragraph (a) is premised on the idea that preserving the right to a fair trial necessarily 
entails some curtailment of the information that may be disseminated about a party prior to 
trial. This is particularly so where trial by jury or lay judge is involved. If there were no such 
limits, the results would be the practical nullification of the protective effect of the rules of 
forensic decorum and the exclusionary rules of evidence. Thus, paragraph (a) provides that in 
the  course  of  representing  a  client,  a  lawyer’s  right  to  free  speech  is  subordinate  to  the 
constitutional requirements of a fair trial. On the other hand, there are vital social interests 
served by the free dissemination of information about events having legal consequences and 
about legal proceedings themselves. The public has a right to know about threats to its safety 
 

68 

 

and measures aimed at assuring its security. It also has a legitimate interest in the conduct of 
judicial  proceedings,  particularly  in  matters  of  general  public  concern.  Furthermore,  the 
subject matter of legal proceedings is often of direct significance in debate and deliberation 
over questions of public policy. 

. Because no body of rules can simultaneously satisfy all interests of fair trial and all those of 
free expression, some balancing of those interests is required.  It is difficult to strike that 
balance. The formula embodied in this Rule, prohibiting those extrajudicial statements that 
the lawyer knows or  reasonably should know  have a  reasonable  likelihood of materially 
prejudicing an adjudicatory proceeding, is intended to incorporate the degree of concern for 
the first amendment rights of lawyers, listeners, and the media necessary to pass constitutional 
muster. The obligations imposed upon a lawyer by this Rule are subordinate to those rights. If 
a particular statement would be inappropriate for a lawyer to make, however, the lawyer is as 
readily subject to discipline for counseling or assisting another person to make it as he or she 
would be for doing so directly. See paragraph (a). 

. The existence of material prejudice normally depends on the circumstances in which a 
particular  statement  is made.  For  example,  an otherwise objectionable statement may be 
excusable if reasonably calculated to counter the unfair prejudicial effect of another public 
statement. Applicable constitutional principles require that the disciplinary standard in this 
area retain the flexibility needed to take such unique considerations into account. 

. Although they are not standards of discipline, paragraphs (b) and (c) seek to give some 
guidance concerning what types of statements are or are not apt to violate paragraph (a). 
Paragraph  (b)  sets  forth  conditions  under  which  statements  of  the  types  listed  in 
subparagraphs  (b)(1)  through  (5)  would  likely  violate  paragraph  (a)  in  the  absence  of 
exceptional extenuating circumstances. Paragraph (c) on the other hand, describes statements 
that  are  unlikely  to  violate  paragraph  (a)  in  the  absence  of  exceptional  aggravating 
circumstances. Neither paragraph (b) nor paragraph (c) is an exhaustive listing. 

.  Special  rules  of  confidentiality  may  validly  govern  proceedings  in  juvenile,  domestic 
relations  and  mental  disability  proceedings,  and  perhaps  other  types  of  litigation.  Rule 
3.04(c)(1) and (d) govern a lawyer’s duty with respect to such Rules. Frequently, a lawyer’s 
obligations  to  the  client  under  Rule  1.05  also  will  prevent  the  disclosure  of  confidential 
information. 

ule 3.08 Lawyer as Witness 

a) A lawyer shall not accept or continue employment as an advocate before a tribunal in a 
contemplated or pending adjudicatory proceeding if the lawyer knows or believes that the 
lawyer is or may be a witness necessary to establish an essential fact on behalf of the lawyer’s 
client, unless: 

(1) the testimony relates to an uncontested issue; 

(2) the testimony will relate solely to a matter of formality and there is no reason to 
believe that substantial evidence will be offered in opposition to the testimony; 

  2

69 

(3) the testimony relates to the nature and value of legal services rendered in the case; 

(4) the lawyer is a party to the action and is appearing pro se; or 

(5) the  lawyer has  promptly  notified opposing counsel  that the lawyer expects  to 
testify  in  the  matter  and  disqualification  of  the  lawyer  would  work  substantial 
hardship on the client. 

b) A lawyer shall not continue as an advocate in a pending adjudicatory proceeding if the 
lawyer  believes  that  the  lawyer  will  be  compelled  to  furnish  testimony  that  will  be 
substantially adverse to the lawyer’s client, unless the client consents after full disclosure.  

c) Without the client’s informed consent, a lawyer may not act as advocate in an adjudicatory 
proceeding in which another lawyer in the lawyer’s firm is prohibited by paragraphs (a) or (b) 
from serving as advocate. If the lawyer to be called as a witness could not also serve as an 
advocate under this Rule, that lawyer shall not take an active role before the tribunal in the 
presentation of the matter.  

omment: 

. A lawyer who is considering accepting or continuing employment in a contemplated or 
pending adjudicatory proceeding in which that lawyer knows or believes that he or she may 
be a necessary witness is obligated by this Rule to consider the possible consequences of 
those dual roles for both the lawyer’s own client and for opposing parties. 

. One important variable in this context is the anticipated tenor of the lawyer’s testimony. If 
that testimony will be substantially adverse to the client, paragraphs (b) and (c) provide the 
governing standard. In other situations, paragraphs (a) and (c) control.  

. A lawyer who is considering both representing a client in an adjudicatory proceeding and 
serving  as  a  witness  in  that  proceeding  may  possess  information  pertinent  to  the 
representation that would be substantially adverse to the client were it to be disclosed. A 
lawyer who believes that he or she will be compelled to furnish testimony concerning such 
matters should not continue to act as an advocate for his or her client except with the client’s 
informed consent, because of the substantial likelihood that such adverse testimony would 
damage the lawyer’s ability to represent the client effectively. 

. In all other circumstances, the principal concern over allowing a lawyer to serve as both an 
advocate and witness for a client is the possible confusion that those dual roles could create 
for the finder of fact. Normally those dual roles are unlikely to create exceptional difficulties 
when the lawyer’s testimony is limited to the areas set out in sub-paragraphs (a)(1)-(4) of this 
Rule.  If,  however,  the  lawyer’s  testimony  concerns  a  controversial  or  contested  matter, 
combining the roles of advocate and witness can unfairly prejudice the opposing party. A 
witness  is  required  to  testify  on  the  basis  of  personal  knowledge,  while  an  advocate  is 
expected to explain and comment on evidence given by others. It may not be clear whether a 
statement by an advocate-witness should be taken as proof or as an analysis of the proof.

5. Paragraph (a)(1) recognizes that if the testimony will be uncontested, the ambiguities in the 
dual role are purely theoretical. Paragraph (a)(2) recognizes that similar considerations apply 
if a lawyer’s testimony relates solely to a matter of formality and there is no reason to believe 
that substantial opposing evidence will be offered. In each of those situations requiring the 
involvement of another lawyer would be a costly procedure that would serve no significant 
countervailing purpose. 

. Sub-paragraph (a)(3) recognizes that where the testimony concerns the extent and value of 
legal services rendered in the action in which the testimony is offered, permitting the lawyers 
to testify avoids the need for a second trial with new counsel to resolve that issue. Moreover, 
in such a situation the judge has firsthand knowledge of the matter in issue; hence, there is 
less  dependence  on  the  adversary  process  to  test  the  credibility  of  the  testimony.  Sub-
paragraph (a)(4) makes it clear that this Rule is not intended to affect a lawyers' right to self-
representation. 

. Apart from these four exceptions, sub-paragraph (a)(5) recognizes an additional exception 
based  upon  a  balancing  of  the  interests  of  the  client  and  those  of  the  opposing  party.  In 
implementing this exception, it is relevant that one or both parties could reasonably foresee 
that the lawyer would probably be a witness. For example, sub-paragraph (a)(5) requires that 
a  lawyer  relying  on  that  sub-paragraph  as  a  basis  for  serving  as  both  an  advocate  and  a 
witness for a party give timely notification of that fact to opposing counsel. That requirement 
serves  two  purposes.  First,  it  prevents  the  testifying  lawyer  from  creating  a  substantial 
hardship, where none once existed, by virtue of a lengthy representation of the client in the 
matter at hand. Second, it puts opposing parties on notice of the situation, thus enabling them 
to make any desired response at the earliest opportunity. 

. This rule does not prohibit the lawyer who may or will be a witness from participating in 
the preparation of a matter for presentation to a tribunal. To minimize the possibility of unfair 
prejudice to an opposing party, however, the Rule prohibits any testifying lawyer who could 
not serve as an advocate from taking an active role before the tribunal in the presentation of 
the  matter.  See  paragraph  (c).  Even  in  those  situations,  however,  another  lawyer  in  the 
testifying lawyer’s firm may act as an advocate, provided the client’s informed consent is 
obtained. 

. Rule 3.08 sets out a disciplinary standard and is not well suited to use as a standard for 
procedural disqualification. As a disciplinary rule it serves two principal purposes. The first is 
to insure that a client’s case is not compromised by being represented by a lawyer who could 
be a more effective witness for the client by not also serving as an advocate. See paragraph 
(a). The second is to insure that a client is not burdened by counsel who may have to offer 
testimony that is substantially adverse to the clients cause. See paragraph (b).

0. This Rule may furnish some guidance in those procedural disqualification disputes where 
the party seeking disqualification can demonstrate actual prejudice to itself resulting from the 
opposing lawyer’s service in the dual roles. However, it should not be used as a tactical 
weapon to deprive the opposing party of the right to be represented by the lawyer of his or her 
choice. For example, a lawyer should not seek to disqualify an opposing lawyer under this 
Rule merely because the opposing lawyer’s dual roles may involve an improper conflict of 
interest  with  respect  to  the  opposing  lawyer’s  client,  for  that  is  a  matter  to  be  resolved 
 

71 

 

between lawyer and client or in a subsequent disciplinary proceeding. Likewise, a lawyer 
should not seek to disqualify an opposing lawyer by unnecessarily calling that lawyer as a 
witness. Such unintended applications of this Rule, if allowed, would subvert its true purpose 
by converting it into a mere tactical weapon in litigation. 

ule 3.09 Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor 

he prosecutor in a criminal case shall: 

a) refrain from prosecuting or threatening to prosecute a charge that the prosecutor knows is 
not supported by probable cause; 

b) refrain from conducting or assisting in a custodial interrogation of an accused unless the 
prosecutor has made reasonable efforts to be assured that the accused has been advised of any 
right to, and the procedure for obtaining, counsel and has been given reasonable opportunity 
to obtain counsel; 

c) not initiate or encourage efforts to obtain from an unrepresented accused a waiver of 
important pre-trial, trial or post-trial rights; 

d)  make  timely  disclosure  to  the  defense  of  all  evidence  or  information  known  to  the 
prosecutor  that  tends  to  negate  the  guilt  of  the  accused  or  mitigates  the  offense,  and,  in 
connection  with  sentencing,  disclose  to  the  defense  and  to  the  tribunal  all  unprivileged 
mitigating information known to the prosecutor, except when the prosecutor is relieved of this 
responsibility by a protective order of the tribunal; and 

e) exercise reasonable care to prevent persons employed or controlled by the prosecutor in a 
criminal case from making an extrajudicial statement that the prosecutor would be prohibited 
from making under Rule 3.07.

. A prosecutor has the responsibility to see that justice is done, and not simply to be an 
advocate. This responsibility carries with it a number of specific obligations. Among these is 
to see that no person is threatened with or subjected to the rigors of a criminal prosecution 
without good cause. See paragraph (a). In addition a prosecutor should not initiate or exploit 
any violation of a suspect’s right to counsel, nor should he initiate or encourage efforts to 
obtain waivers of important pre-trial, trial, or post-trial rights from unrepresented persons. See 
paragraphs  (b)  and  (c).  In  addition,  a  prosecutor  is  obliged  to  see  that  the  defendant  is 
accorded procedural justice, that the defendant’s guilt is decided upon the basis of sufficient 
evidence, and that any sentence imposed is based on all unprivileged information known to 
the  prosecutor.  See  paragraph  (d).  Finally,  a  prosecutor  is  obliged  by  this  rule  to  take 
reasonable measures to see that persons employed or controlled by him refrain from making 
extrajudicial statements that are prejudicial to the accused. See paragraph (e) and Rule 3.07. 
See  also  Rule  3.03(a)(3),  governing  ex  parte  proceedings,  among  which  grand  jury 
proceedings are included. Applicable law may require other measures by the prosecutor and 
 

72 

 

knowing disregard of those obligations or a systematic abuse of prosecutorial discretion could 
constitute a violation of Rule 8.04. 

. Paragraph (a) does not apply to situations where the prosecutor is using a grand jury to 
determine whether any crime has been committed, nor does it prevent a prosecutor from 
presenting a matter to a grand jury even though he has some doubt as to what charge, if any, 
the grand jury may decide is appropriate, as long as he believes that the grand jury could 
reasonably  conclude  that  some  charge  is  proper.  A  prosecutor’s  obligations  under  that 
paragraph are satisfied  by  the return of  a true bill  by  a grand  jury, unless the  prosecutor 
believes that material inculpatory information presented to the grand jury was false. 

. Paragraph (b) does not forbid the lawful questioning of any person who has knowingly, 
intelligently and voluntarily waived the rights to counsel and to silence, nor does it forbid 
such questioning of any unrepresented person who has not stated that he wishes to retain a 
lawyer and who is not entitled to appointed counsel. See also Rule 4.03. 

.  Paragraph  (c)  does  not  apply  to  any  person  who  has  knowingly,  intelligently  and 
voluntarily waived the rights referred to therein in open court, nor does it apply to any person 
appearing pro se with the approval of the tribunal. Finally, that paragraph does not forbid a 
prosecutor from advising an unrepresented accused who has not stated he wishes to retain a 
lawyer and who is not entitled to appointed counsel and who has indicated in open court that 
he wishes to plead guilty to charges against him of his pre-trial, trial and post-trial rights, 
provided  that  the  advice  given  is  accurate;  that  it  is  undertaken  with  the knowledge  and 
approval of the court; and that such a practice is not otherwise prohibited by law or applicable 
rules of practice or procedure. 

.  The  exception  in  paragraph  (d)  recognizes  that  a  prosecutor  may  seek  an  appropriate 
protective order from the tribunal if disclosure of information to the defense could result in 
substantial harm to an individual or to the public interest. 

. Sub-paragraph (e) does not subject a prosecutor to discipline for failing to take measures to 
prevent investigators, law enforcement personnel or other persons assisting or associated with 
the  prosecutor,  but  not  in  his  employ  or  under  his  control,  from  making  extrajudicial 
statements that the prosecutor would be prohibited from making under Rule 3.07. To the 
extent feasible, however, the prosecutor should make reasonable efforts to discourage such 
persons from making statements of that kind. 

ule 3.10 Advocate in Non-adjudicative Proceedings 

  lawyer  representing  a  client  before  a  legislative  or  administrative  body  in  a  non-
adjudicative proceeding shall disclose that the appearance is in a representative capacity and 
shall conform to the provisions of Rules 3.04(a) through (d), 3.05(a), and 4.01.

. In appearing before bodies such as legislatures, municipal councils, and executive and 
administrative agencies acting in a rule-making or policy-making capacity, lawyers present 
facts,  formulate  issues  and  advance  argument  in  the  matters  under  consideration.  The 
 

73 

 

decision-making body, like a court, should be able to rely on the integrity of the submissions 
made to it. A lawyer appearing before such a body should deal with the tribunal honestly and 
in conformity with applicable rules of procedure. A lawyer is required to disclose whether a 
particular appearance is in a representative capacity. Although not required to do so by Rule 
3.10,  a  lawyer  should  reveal  the  identities  of  the  lawyer’s  clients,  unless  privileged  or 
otherwise protected, so that the decision-making body can weigh the lawyer’s presentation 
more accurately. See Rule 4.01, Comment 1. 

. Lawyers have no exclusive  right to  appear  before  non-adjudicative bodies, as they do 
before a court. The requirements of this Rule therefore may subject lawyers to regulations 
inapplicable to advocates who are not lawyers. 

. As to the representation of a client in a negotiation or other bilateral transaction with a 
governmental agency, see Rules 4.01 through 4.04. 
 

IV. NON-CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS 

ule 4.01 Truthfulness in Statements to Others 

n the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly: 

a) make a false statement of material fact or law to a third person; or 

b) fail to disclose a material fact to a third person when disclosure is necessary to avoid 
making the lawyer a party to a criminal act or knowingly assisting a fraudulent act perpetrated 
by a client. 

omment: 

alse Statements of Fact 

.  Paragraph  (a)  of  this  Rule  refers  to  statements  of  material  fact.  Whether  a  particular 
statement should be regarded as one of material fact can depend on the circumstances. For 
example, certain types of statements ordinarily are not taken as statements of material fact 
because they are viewed as matters of opinion or conjecture. Estimates of price or value 
placed on the subject of a transaction are in this category. Similarly, under generally accepted 
conventions in negotiation, a party’s supposed intentions as to an acceptable settlement of a 
claim may be viewed merely as negotiating positions rather than as accurate representations 
of material fact. Likewise, according to commercial conventions, the fact that a particular 
transaction is being undertaken on behalf of an undisclosed principal need not be disclosed 
except where non-disclosure of the principal would constitute fraud. 

. A lawyer violates paragraph (a) of this Rule either by making a false statement of law or 
material fact or by incorporating or affirming such a statement made by another person. Such 
statements will violate this Rule, however, only if the lawyer knows they are false and intends 
thereby  to  mislead.  As  to  a  lawyer’s  duty  to  decline  or  terminate  representation  in  such 
situations, see Rule 1.15.

Failure to Disclose A Material Fact 

. Paragraph (b) of this Rule also relates only to failures to disclose material facts. Generally, 
in the course of representing a client a lawyer has no duty to inform a third person of relevant 
or material facts, except as required by law or by applicable rules of practice or procedure, 
such as formal discovery. However, a lawyer must not allow fidelity to a client to become a 
vehicle for a criminal act or a fraud being perpetrated by that client. Consequently a lawyer 
must disclose a material fact to a third party if the lawyer knows that the client is perpetrating 
a crime or a fraud and the lawyer knows that disclosure is necessary to prevent the lawyer 
from becoming a party to that crime or fraud. Failure to disclose under such circumstances is 
misconduct only if the lawyer intends thereby to mislead. 

. When a lawyer discovers that a client has committed a criminal or fraudulent act in the 
course of which the lawyer's services have been used, or that the client is committing or 
intends to commit any criminal or fraudulent act, other of these Rules require the lawyer to 
urge  the  client  to  take  appropriate  action.  See  Rules  1.02(d),  (e),  (f);  3.03(b).  Since  the 
disclosures called for by paragraph (b) of this Rule will be necessary only if the lawyer’s 
attempts to counsel his client not to commit the crime or fraud are unsuccessful, a lawyer is 
not authorized to make them without having first undertaken those other remedial actions. See 
also Rule 1.05. 

raud by a Client 

. A lawyer should never knowingly assist a client in the commission of a criminal act or 
a fraudulent act. See Rule 1.02(c). 

. This rule governs a lawyer’s conduct during the course of representing a client. If the 
lawyer has terminated representation prior to learning of a client’s intention to commit a 
criminal  or  fraudulent  act,  paragraph  (b)  of  this  Rule  does  not  apply.  See  Fraud  under 
TERMINOLOGY. 

ule 4.02 Communication with One Represented by Counsel 

a) In representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate or cause or encourage another to 
communicate about the subject of the representation with a person, organization or entity of 
government the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer regarding that subject, 
unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized by law to do so. 

b) In representing a client a lawyer shall not communicate or cause another to communicate 
about  the  subject  of  representation  with  a  person  or  organization  a  lawyer  knows  to  be 
employed or retained for the purpose of conferring with or advising another lawyer about the 
subject of  the  representation, unless the lawyer has  the consent  of  the other  lawyer or is 
authorized by law to do so.

c) For the purpose of this rule, organization or entity of government includes: (1) those 
persons  presently  having  a  managerial  responsibility  with  an  organization  or  entity  of 
government that relates to the subject of the representation, or (2) those persons presently 
employed by such organization or entity and whose act or omission in connection with the 
 

75 

 

subject of  representation may make the organization or entity of government vicariously 
liable for such act or omission. 

d) When a person, organization, or entity of government that is represented by a lawyer in a 
matter  seeks advice regarding  that matter  from another lawyer, the second  lawyer  is  not 
prohibited by paragraph (a) from giving such advice without notifying or seeking consent of 
the first lawyer. 

omment: 

. Paragraph (a) of this Rule is directed at efforts to circumvent the lawyer-client relationship 
existing between other persons, organizations or entities of government and their respective 
counsel. It prohibits communications that in form are between a lawyer’s client and another 
person, organization or entity of government represented by counsel where, because of the 
lawyer’s  involvement  in  devising  and  controlling  their  content,  such  communications  in 
substance  are  between  the  lawyer  and  the  represented  person,  organization  or  entity  of 
government. 

. Paragraph (a) does not, however, prohibit communication between a lawyer’s client and 
persons,  organizations,  or  entities  of  government  represented  by  counsel,  as  long  as  the 
lawyer does not cause or encourage the communication without the consent of the lawyer for 
the other party. Consent may be implied as well as expressed, as, for example, where the 
communication occurs in the form of a private placement memorandum or similar document 
that obviously is intended for multiple recipients and that normally is furnished directly to 
persons,  even  if  known  to  be  represented  by  counsel.  Similarly, that  paragraph  does  not 
impose a duty on a lawyer to affirmatively discourage communication between the lawyer’s 
client and other represented persons, organizations or entities of government. Furthermore, it 
does  not  prohibit  client  communications  concerning  matters  outside  the  subject  of  the 
representation with any such person, organization, or entity of government. Finally, it does 
not prohibit a lawyer from furnishing a second opinion in a matter to one requesting such 
opinion, nor from discussing employment in the matter if requested to do so. But see Rules 
7.01 and 8.04(a)(3).  

. Paragraph (b) of this Rule provides that unless authorized by law, experts employed or 
retained by a lawyer for a particular matter should not be contacted by opposing counsel 
regarding that matter without the consent of the lawyer who retained them. However, certain 
governmental agents or employees such as police may be contacted due to their obligations to 
the public at large. 

  (

. In the case of an organization or entity of government, this Rule prohibits communications 
by a lawyer for one party concerning the subject of the representation with persons having a 
managerial  responsibility  on  behalf  of  the  organization  that  relates  to  the  subject  of  the 
representation and  with those persons presently  employed by such organization or  entity 
whose act or omission may make the organization or entity vicariously liable for the matter at 
issue, without the consent of the lawyer for the organization or entity of government involved. 
This Rule is based on the presumption that such persons are so closely identified with the 
interests of the organization or entity of government that its lawyers will represent them as 
well. If, however, such an agent or employee is represented in the matter by his or her own 
 

76 

 

counsel  that  presumption  is  inapplicable.  In  such  cases,  the  consent  by  that  counsel  to 
communicate will be sufficient for purposes of this Rule. Compare Rule 3.04(f). Moreover, 
this Rule does not prohibit a lawyer from contacting a former employee of a represented 
organization or entity of a government, nor from contacting a person presently employed by 
such an organization or entity whose conduct is not a matter at issue but who might possess 
knowledge concerning the matter at issue. 

ule 4.03 Dealing With Unrepresented Person 

n dealing on behalf of a client with a person who is not represented by counsel, a lawyer shall 
not state or imply that the lawyer is disinterested. When the lawyer knows or reasonably 
should know that the unrepresented person misunderstands the lawyer’s role in the matter, the 
lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to correct the misunderstanding. 

omment: 

n unrepresented person, particularly one not  experienced  in  dealing  with  legal matters, 
might assume that a lawyer is disinterested in loyalties or is a disinterested authority on the 
law even when the lawyer represents a client. During the course of a lawyer’s representation 
of a client, the lawyer should not give advice to an unrepresented person other than the advice 
to obtain counsel. With regard to the special responsibilities of a prosecutor, see Rule 3.09. 

ule 4.04 Respect for Rights of Third Persons 

a) In representing a client, a lawyer shall not use means that have no substantial purpose 
other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third person, or use methods of obtaining evidence 
that violate the legal rights of such a person. 

b) A lawyer shall not present, participate in presenting, or threaten to present: 

(1) criminal or disciplinary charges solely to gain an advantage in a civil matter; or 

(2)  civil,  criminal  or  disciplinary  charges  against  a  complainant,  a  witness,  or  a 
potential witness in a bar disciplinary proceeding solely to prevent participation by the 
complainant, witness or potential witness therein. 

omment: 

. Although in most cases a lawyer’s responsibility to the interest of his client is paramount to 
the interest of other persons, a lawyer should avoid the infliction of needless harm. 

. Using or threatening to use the criminal process solely to coerce a party in a private matter 
improperly suggests that the criminal process can be manipulated by private interests for 
personal gain. However, giving any notice required by law or applicable rules of practice or 
procedure as a prerequisite to instituting criminal charges does not violate this Rule, unless 
the underlying criminal charges were made without probable cause.

3.  Using  or  threatening  to  use  the  civil,  criminal,  or  disciplinary  processes  to  coerce  a 
complainant,  a  witness,  or  a  potential  witness  in  a  bar  disciplinary  proceeding  is  an 
implication that lawyers can manipulate the legal system to their personal advantage. Creating 
such false impressions is an abuse of the legal system that diminishes public confidence in the 
legal profession and in the fairness of the legal system as a whole. 
 

V. LAW FIRMS AND ASSOCIATIONS 

ule 5.01 Responsibilities of a Partner or Supervisory Lawyer 

 lawyer shall be subject to discipline because of another lawyer’s violation of these rules of 

professional conduct if: 

a)  The  lawyer  is  a  partner  or  supervising  lawyer  and  orders,  encourages,  or  knowingly 
permits the conduct involved; or 

b) The lawyer is a partner in the law firm in which the other lawyer practices, is the general 
counsel of a government agency’s legal department in which the other lawyer is employed, or 
has  direct  supervisory  authority  over  the  other  lawyer,  and  with  knowledge  of  the  other 
lawyer’s violation of these rules knowingly fails to take reasonable remedial action to avoid 
or mitigate the consequences of the other lawyer’s violation. 

omment: 

. Rule 5.01 conforms to the general principle that a lawyer is not vicariously subjected to 
discipline for the misconduct of  another person.  Under Rule 8.04,  a  lawyer is subject to 
discipline if the  lawyer  knowingly assists  or induces  another  to  violate  these  rules.  Rule 
5.01(a) additionally provides that a partner or supervising lawyer is subject to discipline for 
ordering or encouraging another lawyer’s violation of these rules. Moreover, a partner or 
supervising lawyer is in a position of authority over the work of other lawyers and the partner 
or supervising lawyer may be disciplined for permitting another lawyer to violate these rules. 

. Rule 5.01(b) likewise is concerned with the lawyer who is in a position of authority over 
another lawyer and who knows that the other lawyer has committed a violation of a rule of 
professional conduct. A partner in a law firm, the general counsel of a government agency’s 
legal department, or a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over specific legal work by 
another lawyer, occupies the position of authority contemplated by Rule 5.01(b). 

.  Whether  a  lawyer  has  direct  supervisory  authority  over  the  other  lawyer  in  particular 
circumstances is a question of fact. In some instances, a senior associate may be a supervising 
attorney. 

. The duty imposed upon the partner or other authoritative lawyer by Rule 5.01(b) is to take 
reasonable remedial action to avoid or mitigate the consequences of the other lawyer’s known 
violation. Appropriate remedial action by a partner or other supervisory lawyer would depend 
on many factors, such as the immediacy of the partner’s or supervisory lawyer’s knowledge 
and involvement, the nature of the action that can reasonably be expected to avoid or mitigate 
injurious  consequences,  and  the  seriousness  of  the  anticipated  consequences.  In  some

circumstances, it may be sufficient for a junior partner to refer the ethical problem directly to 
a designated senior partner or a management committee. A lawyer supervising a specific legal 
matter  may  be required to intervene more directly.  For  example, if a  supervising  lawyer 
knows that a supervised lawyer misrepresented a matter to an opposing party in negotiation, 
the supervisor as well as the other lawyer may be required by Rule 5.01(b) to correct the 
resulting misapprehension. 

. Thus, neither Rule 5.01(a) nor Rule 5.01(b) visits vicarious disciplinary liability upon the 
lawyer in a position of authority. Rather, the lawyer in such authoritative position is exposed 
to discipline only for his or her own knowing actions or failures to act. Whether a lawyer may 
be liable civilly or criminally for another lawyer's conduct is a question of law beyond the 
scope of these rules. 

.  Wholly  aside  from  the  dictates  of  these  rules  for  discipline,  a  lawyer  in  a  position  of 
authority  in  a  firm  or  government  agency  or  over  another  lawyer  should  feel  a  moral 
compunction to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the office, firm, or agency has in effect 
appropriate procedural measures giving reasonable assurance that all lawyers in the office 
conform to these rules. This moral obligation, although not required by these rules, should fall 
also upon lawyers who have intermediate managerial responsibilities in the law department of 
an organization or government agency. 

. The measures that should be undertaken to give such reasonable assurance may depend on 
the structure of the firm or organization and upon the nature of the legal work performed. In a 
small firm, informal supervision and an occasional admonition ordinarily will suffice. In a 
large firm, or in practice situations where intensely difficult ethical problems frequently arise, 
more elaborate procedures may be called for in order to give such assurance. Obviously, the 
ethical atmosphere of a firm influences the conduct of all of its lawyers. Lawyers may rely 
also  on  continuing  legal  education  in  professional  ethics  to  guard  against  unintentional 
misconduct by members of their firm or organization. 

ule 5.02 Responsibilities of a Supervised Lawyer 

 lawyer is bound by these rules notwithstanding that the lawyer acted under the supervision 
of another person, except that a supervised lawyer does not violate these rules if that lawyer 
acts in accordance with a supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question 
of professional conduct.

.  Rule  5.02  embodies  the  fundamental  concept  that  every  lawyer  is  a  trained,  mature, 
licensed professional who has sworn to uphold ethical standards and who is responsible for 
the lawyer’s own conduct. Accordingly, a lawyer is not relieved from compliance with these 
rules because the lawyer acted under the supervision of an employer or other person. In some 
situations, the fact that a lawyer acted at the direction or order of another person may be 
relevant in determining whether the lawyer had the knowledge required to render the conduct 
a violation of these rules. The fact of supervision may also, of course, be a circumstance to be 
considered by a grievance committee or court in mitigation of the penalty to be imposed for 
violation of a rule. 
 

79 

 

80 

. In many law firms and organizations, the relatively inexperienced lawyer works as an 
assistant to a more experienced lawyer or is directed, supervised or given guidance by an 
experienced lawyer in the firm. In the normal course of practice the senior lawyer has the 
responsibility for making the decisions involving professional judgment as to procedures to be 
taken, the status of the law, and the propriety of actions to be taken by the lawyers. Otherwise 
a  consistent  course  of  action  could  not  be  taken  on  behalf  of  clients.  The  junior  lawyer 
reasonably can be expected to acquiesce in the decisions made by the senior lawyer unless the 
decision is clearly wrong. 

. Rule 5.02 takes a realistic attitude toward those prevailing modes of practice by lawyers not 
engaged  in  solo  practice.  Accordingly,  Rule  5.02  provides  the  supervised  lawyer  with  a 
special  defense  in  a  disciplinary  proceeding  in  which  the  lawyer  is  charged  with  having 
violated a rule of professional conduct. The supervised lawyer is entitled to this defense only 
if it appears that an arguable question of professional conduct was resolved by a supervising 
lawyer and that a resolution made by the supervising lawyer was a reasonable resolution. The 
resolution is a reasonable one, even if it is ultimately found to be officially unacceptable, 
provided it would have appeared reasonable to a disinterested, competent lawyer based on the 
information reasonably available to the supervising lawyer at the time the resolution was 
made.  Supervisory  lawyer  as  used  in  Rule  5.02  should  be  construed  in  conformity  with 
prevailing modes of practice in firms and other groups and, therefore, should include a senior 
lawyer who undertakes to resolve the question of professional propriety as well as a lawyer 
who more directly supervises the supervised lawyer. 

.  By  providing  such  a  defense  to  the  supervised  lawyer,  Rule  5.02  recognizes  that  the 
inexperienced lawyer working under the direction or supervision of an employer or senior 
attorney is not in a favorable position to disagree with reasonable decisions made by the 
experienced lawyer. Often, the only choices available to the supervised lawyer would be to 
accept the decision made by the senior lawyer or to resign or otherwise lose the employment. 
This  provision  of  Rule  5.02  also  recognizes  that  it  is  not  necessarily  improper  for  the 
inexperienced lawyer to rely, reasonably and in good faith, upon decisions made in unclear 
matters by senior lawyers in the organization. 

. The defense provided by this Rule is available without regard to whether the conduct in 
question was originally proposed by the supervised lawyer or another person. Nevertheless, 
the supervised lawyer is not permitted to accept an unreasonable decision as to the propriety 
of professional conduct. The Rule obviously provides no defense to the supervised lawyer 
who participates in clearly wrongful conduct. Reliance can be placed only upon a reasonable 
resolution made by the supervisory lawyer. 

. The protection afforded by Rule 5.02 to a supervised lawyer relates only to professional 
disciplinary proceedings. Whether a similar defense may exist in actions in tort or for breach 
of contract is a question beyond the scope of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional 
Conduct.

ule 5.03 Responsibilities Regarding Nonlawyer Assistants 

ith respect to a non-lawyer employed or retained by or associated with a lawyer: 

  R

  W

 

 

a) a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over the nonlawyer shall make reasonable 
efforts to ensure that the persons conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of 
the lawyer; and 

b) a lawyer shall be subject to discipline for the conduct of such a person that would be a 
violation of these rules if engaged in by a lawyer if: 

(1) the lawyer orders, encourages, or permits the conduct involved; or 

(2) the lawyer: 

(i) is a partner in the law firm in which the person is employed, retained by, or 
associated  with;  or  is  the  general  counsel  of  a  government  agency’s  legal 
department in which the person is employed, retained by or associated with; or 
has direct supervisory authority over such person; and 

(ii) with knowledge of such misconduct by the nonlawyer knowingly fails to 
take reasonable remedial action to avoid or mitigate the consequences of that 
person’s misconduct. 

  
Comment: 

. Lawyers generally employ assistants in their practice, including secretaries, investigators, 
law student interns, and paraprofessionals. Such assistants act for the lawyer in rendition of 
the  lawyer’s  professional  services.  A  lawyer  should  give  such  assistants  appropriate 
instruction and supervision concerning the ethical aspects of their employment, particularly 
regarding the obligation not to disclose information relating to representation of the client, 
and should be responsible for their work product. The measures employed in supervising non-
lawyers should take account of the fact that they do not have legal training and are not subject 
to professional discipline. 

. Each lawyer in a position of authority in a law firm or in a government agency should make 
reasonable efforts to ensure that the organization has in effect measures giving reasonable 
assurance that the conduct of nonlawyers employed or retained by or associated with the firm 
or legal department is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer. This ethical 
obligation  includes  lawyers  having  supervisory  authority  or  intermediate  managerial 
responsibilities in the law department of any enterprise or government agency. 

ule 5.04 Professional Independence of a Lawyer 

a) A lawyer or law firm shall not share or promise to share legal fees with a non-lawyer, 
except that: 
 

(1) an agreement by a lawyer with the lawyer’s firm, partner, or associate, or a lawful 
court order, may provide for the payment of money, over a reasonable period of time, 
to  the  lawyer’s  estate  to  or  for  the  benefit  of  the  lawyer’s  heirs  or  personal

representatives,  beneficiaries,  or  former  spouse,  after  the  lawyer’s  death  or  as 
otherwise provided by law or court order. 

(2) a lawyer who undertakes to complete unfinished legal business of a deceased 
lawyer  may  pay  to  the  estate  of  the  deceased  lawyer  that  proportion  of  the  total 
compensation which fairly represents the services rendered by the deceased lawyer; 
and 

(3) a lawyer or law firm may include non-lawyer employees in a retirement plan, even 
though the plan is based in whole or in part on a profit-sharing arrangement.  

b) A lawyer shall not form a partnership with a non-lawyer if any of the activities of the 
partnership consist of the practice of law. 

c) A lawyer shall not permit a person who recommends, employs, or pays the lawyer to 
render legal services for another to direct or regulate the lawyer's professional judgment in 
rendering such legal services. 

d) A lawyer shall not practice with or in the form of a professional corporation or association 
authorized to practice law for a profit, if: 
 

(1) a nonlawyer owns any interest therein, except that a fiduciary representative of the 
estate of a lawyer may hold the stock or interest of the lawyer for a reasonable time 
during administration; 

(2) a nonlawyer is a corporate director or officer thereof; or 

(3)  a  nonlawyer  has  the  right  to  direct  or  control  the  professional  judgment  of  a 
lawyer.  

omment: 

. The provisions of Rule 5.04(a) express traditional limitations on sharing legal fees with 
nonlawyers.  The principal  reasons for  these  limitations are  to  prevent solicitation by lay 
persons of clients for lawyers and to avoid encouraging or assisting nonlawyers in the practice 
of law. See Rules 5.04(d), 5.05 and 7.03. The same reasons support Rule 5.04(b). 

. The exceptions stated in Rule 5.04(a) involve situations where the sharing of legal fees with 
a nonlawyer is not likely to encourage improper solicitation or unauthorized practice of law. 
For example, it is appropriate for a law firm agreement to provide for the payment of money 
after the death of a lawyer, or after the establishment of a guardianship for an incapacitated 
lawyer, to the estate of or to a trust created by the lawyer. A court order, such as a divorce 
decree,  may  provide,  when  appropriate,  for  the  division  of  legal  fees  with  a  nonlawyer. 
Likewise, the inclusion of a secretary or nonlawyer office administrator in a retirement plan to 
which the law firm contributes a portion of its profits or legal fees is proper because this 
division of legal fees is unlikely to encourage improper solicitation or unauthorized practice 
of law.

3.  Rule  5.04(a)  forbids  only  the  sharing  of  legal  fees  with  a  nonlawyer  and  does  not 
necessarily mandate that employees be paid only on the basis of a fixed salary. Thus, the 
payment of an annual or other bonus does not constitute the sharing of legal fees if the bonus 
is neither based on a percentage of the law firms profits or on a percentage of particular legal 
fees nor is given as a reward for conduct forbidden to lawyers. Similarly, the division between 
lawyer and client of the proceeds of a settlement judgment or other award in which both 
damages and attorney fees have been included does not constitute an improper sharing of 
legal fees with a nonlawyer. Reimbursement by a lawyer made to a bona fide or pro bono 
legal services entity for its reasonable expenses in connection with the matter referred to or 
being handled by the lawyer does not constitute a division of legal fees within the meaning of 
Rule 5.04. 

.  Because  the  lawyer-client  relationship  is  a  personal  relationship  in  which  the  client 
generally must trust the lawyer to exercise appropriate professional judgment on the client’s 
behalf, Rule 5.04(c) provides that a lawyer shall not permit improper interference with the 
exercise of the lawyers professional judgment solely on behalf of the client. The lawyer's 
professional  judgment  should  be  exercised  only  for  the  benefit  of  the  client  free  of 
compromising  influences  and  loyalties.  Therefore,  under  Rule  5.04(c)  a  person  who 
recommends, employs, or pays the lawyer  to render legal services for  another  cannot be 
permitted to interfere with the lawyer’s professional relationship with that client. Similarly, 
neither the lawyers personal interests, the interests of other clients, nor the desires of third 
persons should be permitted to dilute the lawyer’s loyalty to the client. 

. Because a lawyer must always be free to exercise professional judgment without regard to 
the interests or motives of a third person, the lawyer who is employed or paid by one to 
represent  another  should  guard  constantly  against  erosion  of  the  lawyers  professional 
judgment. The lawyer should recognize that a person or organization that pays or furnishes 
lawyers to represent others possesses a potential power to exert strong pressures against the 
independent judgment of the lawyer. The lawyer should be watchful that such persons or 
organizations are not seeking to further their own economic, political, or social goals without 
regard  to  the  lawyer’s  responsibility  to  the  client.  Moreover,  a  lawyer  employed  by  an 
organization  is  required  by  Rule  5.04(c)  to  decline  to  accept  direction  of  the  lawyer’s 
professional judgment from any nonlawyer in the organization. 

. Rule 5.04(d) forbids a lawyer to practice with or in the form of a professional corporation 
or  association  in  certain  specific  situations  where  erosion  of  the  lawyer’s  professional 
independence  may  be  threatened.  The  danger  of  erosion  of  the  lawyer's  professional 
independence  sometimes  may  exist  when  a  lawyer  practices  with  associations  or 
organizations not covered by Rule 5.04(d). For example, various types of legal aid offices are 
administered  by  boards  of  directors  composed  of  lawyers  and  nonlawyers,  and  a  lawyer 
should not accept or continue employment with such an organization unless the board sets 
only broad policies and does not interfere in the relationship  of the lawyer and the individual 
client  that  the  lawyer  serves.  See  Rule  1.13.  Whenever  a  lawyer  is  employed  by  an 
organization, a written agreement that defines the  relationship between the lawyer and the 
organization and that provides for the lawyers professional independence is desirable since it 
may serve to prevent misunderstanding as to their respective roles.

a) practice law in a jurisdiction where doing so violates the regulation of the legal profession 
in that jurisdiction; or 

b)  assist  a  person  who  is  not  a  member  of  the  bar  in  the  performance  of  activity  that 
constitutes the unauthorized practice of law. 

omment: 

. Courts generally have prohibited the unauthorized practice of law because of a perceived 
need to protect individuals and the public from the mistakes of the untrained and the schemes 
of the unscrupulous, who are not subject to the judicially imposed disciplinary standards of 
competence, responsibility and accountability. 

. Neither statutory nor judicial definitions offer clear guidelines as to what constitutes the 
practice of law or the unauthorized practice of law. All too frequently, the definitions are so 
broad as to be meaningless and amount to little more than the statement that the practice of 
law is merely whatever lawyers do or are traditionally understood to do. The definition of the 
practice of law is established by law and varies from one jurisdiction to another. Whatever the 
definition,  limiting the practice  of  law to members of the bar protects the public against 
rendition of legal services by unqualified persons. 

. Rule 5.05 does not attempt to define what constitutes the unauthorized practice of law but 
leaves the definition to judicial development. Judicial development of the concept of law 
practice should emphasize that the concept is broad enough but only broad enough to cover all 
situations where there is rendition of services for others that call for the professional judgment 
of  a  lawyer  and  where  the  one  receiving  the  services  generally  will  be  unable  to  judge 
whether adequate services are being rendered and is, therefore, in need of the protection 
afforded by the regulation of the legal profession. Competent professional judgment is the 
product  of  a  trained  familiarity  with  law  and  legal  processes,  a  disciplined,  analytical 
approach  to  legal  problems  and  a  firm  ethical  commitment;  and  the  essence  of  the 
professional judgment of the lawyer is the lawyer’s educated ability to relate the general body 
and philosophy of law to a specific legal problem of a client. 

. Paragraph (b) of Rule 5.05 does not prohibit a lawyer from employing the services of 
paraprofessionals and delegating functions to them. So long as the lawyer supervises the 
delegated work, and retains responsibility for the work, and maintains a direct relationship 
with the client, the paraprofessional cannot reasonably be said to have engaged in activity that 
constitutes the unauthorized practice of law. See Rule 5.03. Likewise, paragraph (b) does not 
prohibit lawyers from providing professional advice and instructions to nonlawyers whose 
employment  requires  knowledge  of  law.  For  example,  claims  adjusters,  employees  of 
financial institutions, social workers, abstractors, police officers, accountants, and persons 
employed in government agencies are engaged in occupations requiring knowledge of law; 
and  a  lawyer  who  assists  them  to  carry  out  their  proper  functions  is  not  assisting  the 
unauthorized practice of law. In addition, a lawyer may counsel nonlawyers who wish to

Rule 5.05 Unauthorized Practice of Law 

 lawyer shall not: 

proceed pro se, since a nonlawyer who represents himself or herself is not engaged in the 
unauthorized practice of law. 

. Authority to engage in the practice of law conferred in any jurisdiction is not necessarily a 
grant of the right to practice elsewhere, and it is improper for a lawyer to engage in practice 
where doing so violates the regulation of the practice of law in that jurisdiction. However, the 
demands of business and the mobility of our society pose distinct problems in the regulation 
of the practice of law by individual states. In furtherance of the public interest, lawyers should 
discourage regulations that unreasonably impose territorial limitations upon the right of a 
lawyer to handle the legal affairs of a client or upon the opportunity of a client to obtain the 
services of a lawyer of his or her choice. 

ule 5.06 Restrictions on Right to Practice 

 lawyer shall not participate in offering or making: 

a) a partnership or employment agreement that restricts the rights of a lawyer to practice after 
termination of the relationship, except an agreement concerning benefits upon retirement; or 

b) an agreement in which a restriction on the lawyers right to practice is part of the settlement 
of a suit or controversy, except that as part of the settlement of a disciplinary proceeding 
against a lawyer an agreement may be made placing restrictions on the right of that lawyer to 
practice. 

omment: 

. An agreement restricting the rights of partners or associates to practice after leaving a firm 
not only limits their professional autonomy but also limits the freedom of clients to choose a 
lawyer. Paragraph (a) prohibits such agreements except for restrictions incident to provisions 
concerning retirement benefits for service with the firm. 

. Paragraph (b) prohibits a lawyer from agreeing not to represent other persons in connection 
with settling a claim on behalf of a client.  

ule 5.07 [Blank] 

ule 5.08 Prohibited Discriminatory Activities 

a) A lawyer shall not willfully, in connection with an adjudicatory proceeding, except as 
provided in paragraph (b), manifest, by words or conduct, bias or prejudice based on race, 
color, national origin, religion, disability, age, sex, or sexual orientation towards any person 
involved in that proceeding in any capacity. 

b) Paragraph (a) does not apply to a lawyer’s decision whether to represent a particular 
person in connection with an adjudicatory proceeding, nor to the process of jury selection, nor 
to  communications  protected  as  confidential  information  under  these  Rules.  See  Rule 
1.05(a),(b). It also does not preclude advocacy in connection with an adjudicatory proceeding 
involving any of the factors set out in paragraph (a) if that advocacy:

(i) is necessary in order to address any substantive or procedural issues raised by the 
proceeding; and 

(ii) is conducted in conformity with applicable rulings and orders of a tribunal and 
applicable rules of practice and procedure. 
 

Comment: 

. Subject to certain exemptions, paragraph (a) of this Rule prohibits willful expressions of 
bias or prejudice in connection with adjudicatory proceedings that are directed towards any 
persons involved with those proceedings in any capacity.  Because the prohibited conduct 
only must occur “in connection with” an adjudicatory proceeding, it applies to misconduct 
transpiring  outside  of  as  well  as  in  the  presence  of  the  tribunal’s  presiding  adjudicatory 
official.  Moreover, the broad definition given to the term “adjudicatory proceeding” under 
these  Rules  means  that  paragraph  (a)’s  prohibition  applies  to  many  settings  besides 
conventional litigation in federal or state courts.  See Preamble: Terminology (definitions of 
“Adjudicatory Proceeding” and “Tribunal”). 

. The Rule, however, contains several important limitations and exemptions.  The first, found 
in paragraph (a), is that a lawyer’s allegedly improper words or conduct must be shown to 
have been “willful” before the lawyer may be subjected to discipline. 

. In addition, paragraph (b) sets out four exemptions from the prohibition of paragraph (a).  
The  first  is  a  lawyer’s  decision  whether  to  represent  a  client.    The  second  is  any 
communication made by the lawyer that is “confidential” under Rule 1.05(a) and (b).  The 
third is a lawyer’s communication that is necessary to represent a client properly and that 
complies with applicable rulings and orders of the tribunal as well as with applicable rules of 
practice or procedure. 

. The fourth exemption in paragraph (b) relates to the lawyer’s words or conduct in selecting 
a jury.  This exemption ensures that a lawyer will be free to thoroughly probe the venire in an 
effort to identify potential jurors having a bias or prejudice towards the lawyer’s client, or in 
favor  of  the  client’s  opponent,  based  on,  among  other  things,  the  factors  enumerated  in 
paragraph (a).  A lawyer should remember, however, that the use of peremptory challenges to 
remove persons from juries based solely on some of the factors listed in paragraph (a) raises 
separate constitutional issues. 

VI. PUBLIC SERVICE 

ule 6.01 Accepting Appointments by a Tribunal 

 lawyer shall not seek to avoid appointment by a tribunal to represent a person except  for 

good cause, such as: 

a)  representing  the  client  is  likely  to  result  in  violation  of  law  or  rules  of  professional 
conduct; 
 

86

b) representing the client is likely to result in an unreasonable financial burden on the lawyer; 
or 

c) the client or the cause is so repugnant to the lawyer as to be likely to impair the client-
lawyer relationship or the lawyer’s ability to represent the client. 

omment: 

ppointment 

. A lawyer may be subject to appointment by a court to serve unpopular clients or persons 
unable to afford legal services. For good cause a lawyer may seek to decline an appointment 
to represent a person who cannot afford to retain counsel or whose cause is unpopular. Good 
cause  exists  if  the  lawyer  could  not  handle  the  matter  competently,  see  Rule  1.01,  or  if 
undertaking the representation would result in an improper conflict of interest, for example, 
when the client or the cause is so repugnant to the lawyer as to be likely to impair the client-
lawyer relationship or the lawyer’s ability to represent the client. Compare Rules 1.06(b), 
1.15(a)(2), 1.15(b)(4). A lawyer may also seek to decline an appointment if acceptance would 
be unreasonably burdensome, for example, when it would impose a financial sacrifice so great 
as to be unjust. Compare Rule 1.15(b)(6). However, a lawyer should not seek to decline an 
appointment because of such factors as a distaste for the subject matter or the proceeding, the 
identity or position of a person involved in the case, the lawyer’s belief that a defendant in a 
criminal proceeding is guilty, or the lawyers belief regarding the merits of a civil case. 

. An appointed lawyer has the same obligations to the client as retained counsel, including 
the obligations of loyalty and confidentiality, and is subject to the same limitations on the 
client-lawyer  relationship,  such  as  the  obligation  to  refrain  from  assisting  the  client  in 
violation of the Rules. 

ublic Interest Service 

. The rights and responsibilities of individuals and organizations in Texas and throughout the 
United States are increasingly defined in legal terms. As a consequence, legal assistance in 
coping  with  the  web  of  statutes,  rules  and  regulations  is  imperative  for  all  persons. 
Consequently, each lawyer engaged in the practice of law should render public interest legal 
service. Personal involvement in the problems of the disadvantaged can be one of the most 
rewarding experiences in the life of a lawyer.  

npopular Cases 

. A lawyer ordinarily is not obliged to accept a client whose character or cause the lawyer 
regards as repugnant. Frequently, however, the needs of such a client for a Lawyer’s services 
are  particularly  pressing  and,  in  some  cases,  the  client  may  have  a  right  to  legal 
representation. At the same time, either financial considerations or the same qualities of the 
client or the clients cause that make a lawyer reluctant to accept employment may severely 
limit the client’s ability to obtain counsel. As a consequence, the lawyer’s freedom to reject 
clients is morally qualified. Legal representation should not be denied to people who are 
 

87 

 

  (

  (

  C

  A

  1

  2

  P

  3

  U

  4

unable to afford legal services, or whose cause is controversial or the subject of popular 
disapproval. By the same token, a lawyer’s representation of a client, including representation 
by appointment, does not constitute an endorsement of the client’s political, economic, social 
or moral views or activities. 

. An individual lawyer may fulfill the ethical responsibility to provide public interest legal 
service by accepting a fair share of unpopular matters or indigent or unpopular clients. History 
is  replete  with  instances  of  distinguished  and  sacrificial  services  by  lawyers  who  have 
represented unpopular clients and causes. Regardless of his personal feelings, a lawyer should 
not decline representation because a client or a cause is unpopular or community reaction is 
adverse. Likewise, a lawyer should not reject tendered employment because of the personal 
preference of a lawyer to avoid adversary alignment against judges, other lawyers, public 
officials, or influential members of the community. 

ule 6.05. Conflict of Interest Exceptions for Nonprofit and Limited Pro Bono Legal 

Services 

a) The conflicts of interest limitations on representation in Rules 1.06, 1.07, and 1.09 do not 
prohibit a lawyer from  providing, or offering to provide,  limited pro bono  legal services 
unless the lawyer knows, at the time the services are provided, that the lawyer would be 
prohibited by those limitations from providing the services. 

b) Lawyers in a firm with a lawyer providing, or offering to provide, limited pro bono legal 
services shall not be prohibited by the imputation provisions of Rules 1.06, 1.07, and 1.09 
from representing a client if that lawyer does not: 
 

(1) disclose confidential information of the pro bono client to the lawyers in the firm; 
or 

(2)  maintain  such  information  in  a  manner  that  would  render  it  accessible  to  the 
lawyers in the firm. 

c) The eligibility information that an applicant is required to provide when applying for free 
legal services or limited pro bono legal services from a program described in subparagraph 
(d)(1) by itself will not create a conflict of interest if: 
 

(1) the eligibility information is not material to the legal matter; or 

(2) the applicant’s provision of the eligibility information was conditioned on the 
applicant’s  informed  consent  that  providing  this  information  would  not  by  itself 
prohibit a representation of another client adverse to the applicant. 

d) As used in this Rule, “limited pro bono legal services” means legal services that are: 

(1) provided through a pro bono or assisted pro se program sponsored by a court, bar 
association, accredited law school, or nonprofit legal services program; 

  5

(2)  short-term  services  such  as  legal  advice  or  other  brief  assistance  with  pro  se 
documents or transactions, provided either in person or by phone, hotline, internet, or 
video conferencing; and 

(3)  provided  without  any  expectation  of  extended  representation  of  the  limited 
assistance client or of receiving any legal fees in that matter. 

e) As used in this Rule, a lawyer is not “in a firm” with other lawyers solely because the 
lawyer provides limited pro bono legal services with the other lawyers. 

omment: 

.  Nonprofit  legal  services  organizations,  courts,  law  schools,  and  bar  associations  have 
programs through which lawyers provide short-term limited legal services typically to help 
low-income  persons  address  their  legal  problems  without  further  representation  by  the 
lawyers. In these programs, such as legal-advice hotlines, advice-only clinics, disaster legal 
services,  or  programs  providing  guidance  to  self-represented  litigants,  a  client-lawyer 
relationship  is  established,  but  there  is  no  expectation  that  the  relationship  will  continue 
beyond the limited consultation and there is no expectation that the lawyer will receive any 
compensation from the client for the services. These programs are normally operated under 
circumstances in which it is not feasible for a lawyer to check for conflicts of interest as is 
normally required before undertaking a representation.   

. Application of the conflict of interest rules has deterred lawyers from participating in these 
programs, preventing persons of limited means from obtaining much needed legal services. 
To  facilitate  the  provision  of  free  legal  services  to  the  public,  this  Rule  creates  narrow 
exceptions  to  the  conflict  of  interest  rules  for  limited  pro  bono  legal  services.  These 
exceptions  are  justified  because  the  limited  and  short-term  nature  of  the  legal  services 
rendered in such programs reduces the risk that conflicts of interest will arise between clients 
represented through the program and other clients of the lawyer or the lawyer’s firm. Other 
than the limited exceptions set forth in this Rule, a lawyer remains subject to all applicable 
conflict of interest rules. 

cope of Representation 

. A lawyer who provides services pursuant to this Rule should secure the client’s consent to 
the limited scope of the representation after explaining to the client what that means in the 
particular circumstance.  See Rule 1.02(b). If a short-term limited representation would not be 
fully sufficient under the circumstances, the lawyer may offer advice to the client but should 
also advise the client of the need for further assistance of counsel. See Rule 1.03(b). 

onflicts and the Lawyer Providing Limited Pro Bono Legal Services 

. Paragraph (a) exempts compliance with Rules 1.06, 1.07, and 1.09 for a lawyer providing 
limited  pro  bono  legal  services  unless  the  lawyer  actually  knows  that  the  representation 
presents a conflict of interest for the lawyer or for another lawyer in the lawyer’s firm. A 
lawyer providing limited pro bono legal services is not obligated to perform a conflicts check 
before  undertaking  the  limited  representation.  If,  after  commencing  a  representation  in 
 

89

accordance with this Rule, a lawyer undertakes to represent the client in the matter on an 
ongoing basis or the lawyer charges a fee for the legal assistance, the exceptions provided by 
this Rule no longer apply. 

mputation of Conflicts 

. Paragraph (b) provides that a conflict of interest arising from a lawyer’s representation 
covered by this Rule will not be imputed to the lawyers in the pro bono lawyer’s firm if the 
pro bono lawyer complies with subparagraphs (b)(1) and (2).  

. To prevent a conflict of interest arising from limited pro bono legal services from being 
imputed to the  other lawyers in the firm, subparagraph  (b)(1)  requires  that the pro bono 
lawyer not disclose to any lawyer in the firm any confidential information related to the pro 
bono representation.  

.  Subparagraph  (b)(2)  covers  the  retention  of  documents  or  other  memorialization  of 
confidential information, such as the pro bono lawyer’s notes, whether in paper or electronic 
form.  To  prevent  imputation,  a  pro  bono  lawyer  who  retains  confidential  information  is 
required by subparagraph (b)(2) to segregate and store it in such a way that no other lawyer in 
the pro bono lawyer’s firm can access it, either physically or electronically.  

ligibility Information 

. Paragraph (c) recognizes the unusual  and  uniquely  sensitive personal  information  that 
applicants for free legal assistance may be required to provide. Organizations that receive 
funding to provide free legal assistance to low-income clients are generally required, as a 
condition of their funding, to screen the applicants for eligibility and to document eligibility 
for services paid for by those funding sources. Unlike other lawyers, law firms, and legal 
departments, these organizations ask for confidential information to determine an applicant’s 
eligibility for free legal assistance and are required to maintain records of such eligibility 
determinations for potential audit by their funding sources. Required eligibility information 
typically includes income, asset values, marital status, citizenship or immigration status, and 
other facts the applicant may consider sensitive.  

. The first situation where the paragraph (c) exception is available is where none of the 
eligibility  information  is  material  to  an  issue  in  the  legal  matter.  Alternatively,  under 
subparagraph (c)(2), if the applicant provided confidential information after giving informed 
consent that the eligibility information would not prohibit the persons or entities identified in 
the  consent  from  representing  any  other  present  or  future  client,  then  the  eligibility 
information  alone  will  not  prohibit  the  representation.  The  lawyer  should  document  the 
receipt of such informed consent, though a formal writing is not required. What constitutes 
informed consent is discussed in the comments to Rule 1.06.

0.  Rule  1.05  continues  to  apply  to  the  use  or  disclosure  of  all  confidential  information 
provided  during  an  intake  interview.  Similarly,  Rule  1.09  continues  to  apply  to  the 
representation  of  a  person  in  a  matter  adverse  to  the  applicant.  Notably,  Rule  1.05(c)(2) 
permits a lawyer to use or disclose information provided during an intake interview if the 
applicant consents after consultation to such use or disclosure, and Rule 1.09(a) excludes from 
 

90 

 

its  restrictions  the  representation  of  a  person  adverse  to  the  applicant  in  the  same  or  a 
substantially related matter if the applicant consents to such a representation. 

imited Pro Bono Legal Service Programs 

1.  This  Rule  applies  only  to  services  offered  through  a  program  that  meets  one  of  the 
descriptions in subparagraph (d)(1), regardless of the nature and amount of support provided. 
Some programs may be jointly sponsored by more than one of the listed sponsor types. 

2. The second element of “limited pro bono legal services,” set forth in subparagraph (d)(2), 
is designed to ensure that the services offered are so limited in time and scope that there is 
little risk that conflicts will arise between clients represented through the program and other 
clients of the lawyer or the lawyer’s firm. 

3. The third element of the definition, set forth in subparagraph (d)(3), is that the services are 
offered  and  provided  without  any  expectation  of  either  extended  representation  or  the 
collection of legal fees in the matter. Before agreeing to proceed in the representation beyond 
“limited pro bono legal services,” the lawyer should evaluate the potential conflicts of interest 
that  may  arise  from  the  representation  as  with  any  other  representation.  Likewise,  the 
exceptions in paragraphs (a) and (b) do not apply if the lawyer expects to collect any legal 
fees in the limited assistance matter. 

irm 

4.  Lawyers  are  not  deemed  to  be  part  of  the  same  firm  simply  because  they  volunteer 
through  the  same  pro  bono  program.  Nor  will  the  personal  prohibition  of  a  lawyer 
participating in a pro bono program be imputed to other lawyers participating in the program 
solely by reason of that volunteer connection. 

a)  A  lawyer  shall  not  make  or  sponsor  a  false  or  misleading  communication  about  the 
qualifications or services of a lawyer or law firm. Information about legal services must be 
truthful and nondeceptive. A communication is false or misleading if it contains a material 
misrepresentation of fact or law, or omits a fact necessary to make the statement considered as 
a  whole  not  materially  misleading.  A  statement  is  misleading  if  there  is  a  substantial 
likelihood that it will lead a reasonable person to formulate a specific conclusion about the 
lawyer or the lawyer’s services for which there is no reasonable factual foundation, or if the 
statement is substantially likely to create unjustified expectations about the results the lawyer 
can achieve. 

b) This Rule governs all communications about a lawyer’s services, including advertisements 
and solicitation communications. For purposes of Rules 7.01 to 7.06: 

1) An “advertisement” is a communication substantially motivated by pecuniary gain

that is made by or on behalf of a lawyer to members of the public in general, which 
offers or promotes legal services under circumstances where the lawyer neither knows 
nor  reasonably  should  know  that  the  recipients  need  legal  services  in  particular 
matters. 

2) A “solicitation communication” is a communication substantially motivated by 
pecuniary gain that is made by or on behalf of a lawyer to a specific person who has 
not sought the lawyer’s advice or services, which reasonably can be understood as 
offering to provide legal services that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know 
the person needs in a particular matter.   

  (

c) Lawyers may practice law under a trade name that is not false or misleading. A law firm 
name  may  include  the  names  of  current  members  of  the  firm  and  of  deceased  or  retired 
members of the firm, or of a predecessor firm, if there has been a succession in the firm 
identity. The name of a lawyer holding a public office shall not be used in the name of a law 
firm, or in communications on its behalf, during any substantial period in which the lawyer is 
not actively and regularly practicing with the firm. A law firm with an office in more than one 
jurisdiction may use the same name or other professional designation in each jurisdiction, but 
identification of the lawyers in an office of the firm shall indicate the jurisdictional limitations 
on those not licensed to practice in the jurisdiction where the office is located. 

d) A statement or disclaimer required by these Rules shall be sufficiently clear that it can 
reasonably  be  understood  by  an  ordinary  person  and  made  in  each  language  used  in  the 
communication.  A  statement  that  a  language  is spoken  or  understood  does  not  require  a 
statement or disclaimer in that language. 

e) A lawyer shall not state or imply that the lawyer can achieve results in the representation 
by unlawful use of violence or means that violate these Rules or other law. 

f) A lawyer may state or imply that the lawyer practices in a partnership or other business 
entity only when that is accurate. 

g) If a lawyer who advertises the amount of a verdict secured on behalf of a client knows that 
the verdict was later reduced or reversed, or that the case was settled for a lesser amount, the 
lawyer must state in each advertisement of the verdict, with equal or greater prominence, the 
amount of money that was ultimately received by the client.

1. This Rule governs all communications about a lawyer’s services, including firm names, 
letterhead,  and  professional  designations.  Whatever  means  are  used  to  make  known  a 
lawyer’s services, statements about them must be truthful and not misleading.  As subsequent 
provisions  make  clear,  some  rules  apply  only  to  “advertisements”  or  “solicitation 
communications.” A statement about a lawyer’s services falls within those categories only if 
it was “substantially motivated by pecuniary gain,” which means that pecuniary gain was a 
substantial factor in the making of the statement.

isleading Truthful Statements 

  M

 

 

.  Misleading  truthful  statements  are  prohibited  by  this  Rule.  For  example,  a  truthful 
statement  is  misleading  if  presented  in  a  way  that  creates  a  substantial  likelihood  that  a 
reasonable person would believe the lawyer’s communication requires that person to take 
further action when, in fact, no action is required.   

se of Actors 

.  The  use  of  an  actor  to  portray  a  lawyer  in  a  commercial  is  misleading  if  there  is  a 
substantial likelihood that a reasonable person will conclude that the actor is the lawyer who 
is offering  to  provide legal services. Whether a  disclaimer—such  as a statement that the 
depiction is a “dramatization” or shows an “actor portraying a lawyer”—is sufficient to make 
the use of an actor not misleading depends on a careful assessment of the relevant facts and 
circumstances, including whether the disclaimer is conspicuous and clear. Similar issues arise 
with respect to actors portraying clients in commercials. Such a communication is misleading 
if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable person will reach erroneous conclusions 
based on the dramatization. 

ntent to Refer Prospective Clients to Another Firm 

. A communication offering legal services is misleading if, at the time a lawyer makes the 
communication, the lawyer knows or reasonably should know, but fails to disclose, that a 
prospective client responding to the communication is likely to be referred to a lawyer in 
another firm.  

njustified Expectations 

.  A  communication  is  misleading  if  there  is  a  substantial  likelihood  that  it  will  create 
unjustified  expectations  on  the  part  of  prospective  clients  about  the  results  that  can  be 
achieved. A communication that truthfully reports results obtained by a lawyer on behalf of 
clients or former clients may be misleading if presented so as to lead a reasonable person to 
form an unjustified expectation that the same results could be obtained for other clients in 
similar  matters  without  reference  to  the  specific  factual  and  legal  circumstances  of  each 
client’s  case.  Depending  on  the  facts  and  circumstances,  the  inclusion  of  an  appropriate 
disclaimer or qualifying language may preclude a finding that a statement is likely to mislead 
the public.   

equired Statements and Disclaimers 

.  A  statement  or  disclaimer  required  by  these  Rules  must  be  presented  clearly  and 
conspicuously such that it is likely to be noticed and reasonably understood by an ordinary 
person. In radio, television, and Internet advertisements, verbal statements must be spoken in 
a manner that their content is easily intelligible, and written statements must appear in a size 
and  font,  and  for  a  sufficient  length  of  time,  that  a  viewer  can  easily  see  and  read  the 
statements.

unsubstantiated comparison of the lawyer’s or law firm’s services or fees with those of other 
lawyers  or  law  firms,  may  be  misleading  if  presented  with  such  specificity  as  to  lead  a 
reasonable person to conclude that the comparison or claim can be substantiated.  

ublic Education Activities 

. As used in these Rules, the terms “advertisement” and “solicitation communication” do not 
include statements made by a lawyer that are not substantially motivated by pecuniary gain. 
Thus, communications which merely inform members of the public about their legal rights 
and  about  legal  services  that  are  available  from  public  or  charitable  legal-service 
organizations, or similar non-profit entities, are permissible, provided they are not misleading. 
These types of statements may be made in a variety of ways, including community legal 
education sessions, know-your-rights brochures, public service announcements on television 
and radio, billboards, information posted on organizational social media sites, and outreach to 
low-income groups in the community, such as in migrant labor housing camps, domestic 
violence shelters, disaster resource centers, and dilapidated apartment complexes. 

. A lawyer or law firm may be designated by a distinctive website address, e-mail address, 
social media username or comparable professional designation that is not misleading and does 
not otherwise violate these Rules. 

eb Presence 

ast Success and Results 

0. A communication about legal services may be misleading because it omits an important 
fact or tells only part of the truth. A lawyer who knows that an advertised verdict was later 
reduced or reversed, or never collected, or that the case was settled for a lesser amount, must 
disclose the amount actually received by the client with equal or greater prominence to avoid 
creating unjustified expectations on the part of potential clients. A lawyer may claim credit for 
a prior judgement or settlement only if the lawyer played a substantial role in obtaining that 
result.  This  standard  is  satisfied  if  the  lawyer  served  as  lead  counsel  or  was  primarily 
responsible for the settlement. In other cases, whether the standard is met depends on the 
facts. A lawyer who did not play a substantial role in obtaining an advertised judgment or 
settlement is subject to discipline for misrepresenting the lawyer’s experience and, in some 
cases, for creating unjustified expectations about the results the lawyer can achieve. 

elated Rules 

1. It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, 
fraud, deceit or misrepresentation. See Rule 8.04(a)(3); see also Rule 8.04(a)(5) (prohibiting 
communications stating or implying an ability to improperly influence a government agency 
or official).

b) A lawyer who advertises may communicate that the lawyer does or does not practice in 
particular fields of law, but shall not include a statement that the lawyer has been certified or 
designated by an organization as possessing special competence or a statement that the lawyer 
is a member of an organization the name of which implies that its members possess special 
competence, except that: 

c) If an advertisement by a lawyer discloses a willingness to render services on a contingent 
fee basis, the advertisement must state whether the client will be obligated to pay for other 
expenses, such as the costs of litigation. 

d) A lawyer who advertises a specific fee or range of fees for an identified service shall 
conform to the advertised fee or range of fees for the period during which the advertisement is 
reasonably expected to be in circulation or otherwise expected to be effective in attracting 
clients, unless the advertisement specifies a shorter period. However, a lawyer is not bound to 
conform to the advertised fee or range of fees for a period of more than one year after the date 
of publication, unless the lawyer has expressly promised to do so. 

omment:  

. These Rules permit the dissemination of information that is not false or misleading about a 
lawyer’s or law firm’s name, address, e-mail address, website, and telephone number; the 
kinds  of  services  the  lawyer  will  undertake;  the  basis  on  which  the  lawyer’s  fees  are 
determined, including prices for specific services and payment and credit arrangements; a 
lawyer’s foreign language abilities; names of references and, with their consent, names of 
clients regularly represented; and other similar information that might invite the attention of 
those seeking legal assistance. 

ommunications about Fields of Practice 

. Lawyers often benefit from associating with other lawyers for the development of practice 
areas. Thus, practitioners have established associations, organizations, institutes, councils, and 
practice groups to promote, discuss, and develop areas of the law, and to advance continuing 
 

95

education  and  skills  development.  While  such  activities  are  generally  encouraged, 
participating lawyers must refrain from creating or using designations, titles, or certifications 
which are false or misleading. A lawyer shall not advertise that the lawyer is a member of an 
organization  whose  name  implies  that  members  possess  special  competence,  unless  the 
organization  meets  the  standards  of  Rule  7.02(b).  Merely  stating  a  designated  class  of 
membership, such as Associate, Master, Barrister, Diplomate, or Advocate, does not, in itself, 
imply special competence violative of these Rules. 

. Paragraph (b) of this Rule permits a lawyer to communicate that the lawyer practices, 
focuses, or concentrates in particular areas of law. Such communications are subject to the 
“false  and  misleading”  standard  applied  by  Rule  7.01  to  communications  concerning  a 
lawyer’s  services  and  must  be  objectively  based  on  the  lawyer’s  experience,  specialized 
training, or education in the area of practice. 

. The Patent and Trademark Office has a long-established policy of designating lawyers 
practicing before the Office. The designation of Admiralty practice also has a long historical 
tradition  associated  with  maritime  commerce  and  the  federal  courts.  A  lawyer’s 
communications about these practice areas are not prohibited by this Rule. 

. This Rule permits a lawyer to state that the lawyer is certified as a specialist in a field of 
law  if  such  certification  is  granted  by  the  Texas  Board  of  Legal  Specialization  or  by  an 
organization that applies standards of experience, knowledge and proficiency to ensure that a 
lawyer’s recognition as a specialist is meaningful and reliable, if the organization is accredited 
by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization. To ensure that consumers can obtain access to 
useful information about an organization granting certification, the name of the certifying 
organization must be included in any communication regarding the certification. 

1) “Regulated telephone, social media, or other electronic contact” means telephone, 
social media, or electronic communication initiated by a lawyer, or by a person acting 
on  behalf  of  a  lawyer,  that  involves  communication  in  a  live  or  electronically 
interactive manner. 

2) A lawyer “solicits” employment by making a “solicitation communication,” as that 
term is defined in Rule 7.01(b)(2).

(e) A lawyer shall not pay, give, or offer to pay or give anything of value to a person not

employment, except nominal gifts given as an expression of appreciation that are neither 
intended nor reasonably expected to be a form of compensation for recommending a lawyer’s 
services.  

1) This Rule does not prohibit a lawyer from paying reasonable fees for advertising 
and public relations services or the usual charges of a lawyer referral service that 
meets the requirements of Texas law. 

2) A lawyer may refer clients to another lawyer or a nonlawyer professional pursuant 
to an agreement not otherwise prohibited under these Rules that provides for the other 
person to refer clients or customers to the lawyer, if:

expenses  and  other  financial  assistance  permitted  by  Rule  1.08(d),  or  ordinary  social 
hospitality of nominal value. 
  
(g) This Rule does not prohibit communications authorized by law, such as notice to members 
of a class in class action litigation. 

omment: 

olicitation by Public and Charitable Legal Services Organizations 

. Rule 7.01 provides that a “‘solicitation communication’ is a communication substantially 
motivated by pecuniary gain.”  Therefore, the ban on solicitation imposed by paragraph (b) of 
this Rule does not apply to the activities of lawyers working for public or charitable legal 
services organizations.   

ommunications Directed to the Public or Requested 

. A lawyer’s communication is not a solicitation if it is directed to the general public, such as 
through a billboard, an Internet banner advertisement, a website or a television commercial, or 
if  it  is  made  in  response  to  a  request  for  information,  including  an  electronic  search  for 
information. The terms “advertisement” and “solicitation communication” are defined in Rule 
7.01(b). 

he Risk of Overreaching 

. A potential for overreaching exists when a lawyer, seeking pecuniary gain, solicits a person 
known to be in need of legal services via in-person or regulated telephone, social media, or 
other electronic contact. These forms of contact subject a person to the private importuning of 
the trained advocate in a direct interpersonal encounter. The person, who may already feel 
overwhelmed by the circumstances giving rise to the need for legal services, may find it 
difficult to fully evaluate all available alternatives with reasoned judgment and appropriate 
self‑interest in the face of the lawyer’s presence and insistence upon an immediate response. 
The  situation  is  fraught  with  the  possibility  of  undue  influence,  intimidation,  and 
overreaching. 

. The potential for overreaching that is inherent in in-person or regulated telephone, social 
media, or other electronic contact justifies their prohibition, since lawyers have alternative 
means of conveying necessary information. In particular, communications can be sent by 
regular mail or e-mail, or by other means that do not involve communication in a live or 
electronically interactive manner. These forms of communications make it possible for the 
public  to  be  informed  about  the  need  for  legal  services,  and  about  the  qualifications  of 
available lawyers and law firms, with minimal risk of overwhelming a person’s judgment.

. The contents of live person-to-person contact can be disputed and may not be subject to 
third‑party scrutiny. Consequently, they are much more likely to approach (and occasionally 
cross)  the  dividing  line  between  accurate  representations  and  those  that  are  false  and 
misleading. 
 

98 

 

argeted Mail Solicitation 

. Regular mail or e-mail targeted to a person that offers to provide legal services that the 
lawyer  knows  or  reasonably  should  know  the  person  needs  in  a  particular  matter  is  a 
solicitation communication within the meaning of Rule 7.01(b)(2), but is not prohibited by 
subsection (b) of this Rule.  Unlike in-person and electronically interactive communication by 
“regulated telephone, social media, or other electronic contact,” regular mail and e-mail can 
easily be ignored, set aside, or reconsidered. There is a diminished likelihood of overreaching 
because no lawyer is physically present and there is evidence in tangible or electronic form of 
what was communicated.  See Shapero v. Kentucky B. Ass’n, 486 U.S. 466 (1988). 

ersonal, Family, Business, and Professional Relationships 

. There is a substantially reduced likelihood that a lawyer would engage in overreaching 
against a former client, a person with whom the lawyer has a close personal, family, business 
or  professional  relationship,  or  in  situations  in  which  the  lawyer  is  motivated  by 
considerations other than pecuniary gain. Nor is there a serious potential for overreaching 
when the person contacted is a lawyer or is known to routinely use the type of legal services 
involved for business purposes. Examples include persons who routinely hire outside counsel 
to represent an entity; entrepreneurs who regularly engage business, employment law, or 
intellectual property lawyers; small business proprietors who routinely hire lawyers for lease 
or contract issues; and other people who routinely retain lawyers for business transactions or 
formations.  

onstitutionally Protected Activities 

. Paragraph (b) is not intended to prohibit a lawyer from participating in constitutionally 
protected activities of public or charitable legal-service organizations or bona fide political, 
social, civic, fraternal, employee, or trade organizations whose purposes include providing or 
recommending legal services to their members or beneficiaries. See In re Primus, 436 U.S. 
412 (1978). 

roup and Prepaid Legal Services Plans 

. This Rule does not prohibit a lawyer from contacting representatives of organizations or 
entities that may be interested in establishing a group or prepaid legal plan for their members, 
insureds, beneficiaries, or other third parties. Such communications may provide information 
about the availability and terms of a plan which the lawyer or lawyer’s firm is willing to offer. 
This form of communication is not directed to persons who are seeking legal services for 
themselves. Rather, it is usually addressed to a fiduciary seeking a supplier of legal services 
for others, who may, if they choose, become prospective clients of the lawyer. Under these 
circumstances,  the  information  transmitted  is  functionally  similar  to  the  types  of 
advertisements permitted by these Rules.

be “plainly marked or clearly designated an ‘ADVERTISEMENT’” if:  (a) in the case of a 
letter transmitted in an envelope, both the outside of the envelope and the first page of the 
letter state the word “ADVERTISEMENT” in bold face all-capital letters that are 3/8” high 
on a uncluttered background; (b) in the case of an e-mail message, the first word in the subject 
line is “ADVERTISEMENT” in all capital letters; and (c) in the case of a text message or 
message on social media, the first word in the message is “ADVERTISEMENT” in all capital 
letters. 

aying Others to Recommend a Lawyer  

1. This Rule allows a lawyer to pay for advertising and communications, including the usual 
costs of printed or online directory listings or advertisements, television and radio airtime, 
domain-name  registrations,  sponsorship  fees,  and  group  advertising.  A  lawyer  may 
compensate employees, agents, and vendors who are engaged to provide marketing or client 
development services, such as publicists, public-relations personnel, business-development 
staff, television and radio station employees or spokespersons, and website designers. 

2. This Rule permits lawyers to give nominal gifts as an expression of appreciation to a 
person for recommending the lawyer’s services or referring a prospective client. The gift may 
not  be  more  than  a  token  item  as  might  be  given  for  holidays,  or  other  ordinary  social 
hospitality. A gift is prohibited if offered or given in consideration of any promise, agreement, 
or understanding that such a gift would be forthcoming or that referrals would be made or 
encouraged in the future. 

3. A lawyer may pay others for generating client leads, such as Internet-based client leads, as 
long as the lead generator does not recommend the lawyer, any payment to the lead generator 
is  consistent  with  Rule  5.04(a)  (division  of  fees  with  nonlawyers)  and  Rule  5.04(c) 
(nonlawyer  interference  with  the  professional  independence  of  the  lawyer),  and  the  lead 
generator’s communications are consistent with Rule 7.01 (communications concerning a 
lawyer’s services). To comply with Rule 7.01, a lawyer must not pay a lead generator that 
states, implies, or creates a reasonable impression that it is recommending the lawyer, is 
making  the  referral  without  payment  from  the  lawyer,  or  has  analyzed  a  person’s  legal 
problems when determining which lawyer should receive the referral. See also Rule 5.03 
(duties of lawyers and law firms with respect to the conduct of nonlawyers); Rule 8.04(a)(1) 
(duty to avoid violating the Rules through the acts of another). 

harges of and Referrals by a Legal Services Plan or Lawyer Referral Service 

4. A lawyer may pay the usual charges of a legal services plan or a not-for-profit or qualified 
lawyer referral service. A legal service plan is a prepaid or group legal service plan or a 
similar delivery system that assists people who seek to secure legal representation. A lawyer 
referral service, on the other hand, is any organization that holds itself out to the public as a 
lawyer referral service. Qualified referral services are consumer-oriented organizations that 
provide unbiased referrals to lawyers with appropriate experience in the subject matter of the 
representation  and  afford  other  client  protections,  such  as  complaint  procedures  or 
malpractice insurance requirements.   

5. A lawyer who accepts assignments or referrals from a legal service plan or referrals from 

100

  P

  1

  C

  1

a lawyer referral service must act reasonably to assure that the activities of the plan or service 
are compatible with the lawyer’s professional obligations. Legal service plans and lawyer 
referral  services  may  communicate  with  the  public,  but  such  communication  must  be  in 
conformity with these Rules. Thus, advertising must not be false or misleading, as would be 
the case if the communications of a group advertising program or a group legal services plan 
would mislead the public to think that it was a lawyer referral service sponsored by a state 
agency or bar association. 

6. A lawyer does not violate paragraph (e) of this Rule by agreeing to refer clients to another 
lawyer  or  nonlawyer  professional,  so  long  as  the  reciprocal  referral  agreement  is  not 
exclusive,  the  client  is  informed  of  the  referral  agreement,  and  the  lawyer  exercises 
independent professional judgment in making the referral. Reciprocal referral agreements 
should not be of indefinite duration and should be reviewed periodically to determine whether 
they comply with these Rules. A lawyer should not enter into a reciprocal referral agreement 
with another lawyer that includes a division of fees without determining that the agreement 
complies with Rule 1.04(f). 

7.  This  Rule  does  not  prohibit  a  lawyer  from  paying  for  a  meal  or  entertainment  for  a 
prospective client that has a nominal value or amounts to ordinary social hospitality. 

ule 7.04. Filing Requirements for Advertisements and Solicitation Communications 

1) a copy of the advertisement or solicitation communication (including packaging if 
applicable) in the form in which it appeared or will appear upon dissemination; 

2) a completed lawyer advertising and solicitation communication application; and 

3) payment to the State Bar of Texas of a fee authorized by the Board of Directors.

c)  A  lawyer  who  desires  to  secure  pre-approval  of  an  advertisement  or  solicitation 
communication may submit to the Advertising Review Committee, not fewer than thirty (30) 
days prior to the date of first dissemination, the material specified in paragraph (a), except that 
in the case of an advertisement or solicitation communication that has not yet been produced, 
the documentation will consist of a proposed text, production script, or other description, 
including details about the illustrations, actions, events, scenes, and background sounds that 
 

101 

 

will be depicted. A finding of noncompliance by the Advertising Review Committee is not 
binding in a disciplinary proceeding or action, but a finding of compliance is binding in favor 
of the submitting lawyer as to all materials submitted for pre-approval if the lawyer fairly and 
accurately described the advertisement or solicitation communication that was later produced. 
A finding of compliance is admissible evidence if offered by a party. 

omment:  

. The Advertising Review Committee shall report to the appropriate disciplinary authority 
any lawyer whom, based on filings with the Committee, it reasonably believes disseminated a 
communication that violates Rules 7.01, 7.02, or 7.03, or otherwise engaged in conduct that 
raises a substantial question as to that lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer 
in other respects. See Rule 8.03(a). 

ultiple Solicitation Communications 

. Paragraph (a) does not require that a lawyer submit a copy of each written solicitation letter 
a lawyer sends. If the same form letter is sent to several persons, only a representative sample 
of each form letter, along with a representative sample of the envelopes used to mail the 
letters, need be filed. 

equests for Additional Information 

. Paragraph (b) does not empower the Advertising Review Committee to seek information 
from  a  lawyer  to  substantiate  statements  or  representations  made  or  implied  in 
communications about legal services that were not substantially motivated by pecuniary gain. 

ule 7.05. Communications Exempt from Filing Requirements 

he following communications are exempt from the filing requirements of Rule 7.04 unless 

they fail to comply with Rules 7.01, 7.02, and 7.03: 

a) any communication of a bona fide nonprofit legal aid organization that is used to educate 
members of the public about the law or to promote the availability of free or reduced-fee legal 
services;

13) any other information specified in orders promulgated by the Supreme Court of 
Texas. 

. This Rule exempts certain types of communications from the filing requirements of Rule 
7.04. Communications that were not substantially motivated by pecuniary gain do not need to 
be filed. 
 

Website-Related Filings 

2. While the entire website of a lawyer or law firm must be compliant with Rules 7.01 and 
7.02, the only material on the website that may need to be filed pursuant to this Rule is the 
contents  of  the  homepage.    However,  even  a  homepage  does  not  need  to  be  filed  if  the 
contents of the homepage are exempt from filing under the provisions of this Rule. Under 
Rule 7.04(c), a lawyer may voluntarily seek pre-approval of any material that is part of the 
lawyer’s website. 

ule 7.06. Prohibited Employment 

a) A lawyer shall not accept or continue employment in a matter when that employment was 
procured by conduct prohibited by Rules 7.01 through 7.03, 8.04(a)(2), or 8.04(a)(9), engaged

in by that lawyer personally or by another person whom the lawyer ordered, encouraged, or 
knowingly permitted to engage in such conduct. 

b) A lawyer shall not accept or continue employment in a matter when the lawyer knows or 
reasonably should know that employment was procured by conduct prohibited by Rules 7.01 
through  7.03,  8.04(a)(2),  or  8.04(a)(9),  engaged  in  by  another  person  or  entity  that  is  a 
shareholder, partner, or member of, an associate in, or of counsel to that lawyer’s firm; or by 
any other person whom the foregoing persons or entities ordered, encouraged, or knowingly 
permitted to engage in such conduct. 

c) A lawyer who has not violated paragraph (a) or (b) in accepting employment in a matter 
shall not continue employment in that matter once the lawyer knows or reasonably should 
know that the person procuring the lawyer’s employment in the matter engaged in, or ordered, 
encouraged, or knowingly permitted another to engage in, conduct prohibited by Rules 7.01 
through 7.03, 8.04(a)(2), or 8.04(a)(9) in connection with the matter unless nothing of value is 
given thereafter in return for that employment. 

.  This  Rule  deals  with  three  different  situations:  personal  disqualification,  imputed 
disqualification, and referral-related payments.   

omment: 

ersonal Disqualification 

 

2. Paragraph (a) addresses situations where the lawyer in question has violated the specified 
advertising rules or other provisions dealing with serious crimes and barratry. The Rule makes 
clear that the offending lawyer  cannot accept or  continue to provide representation. This 
prohibition also applies if the lawyer ordered, encouraged, or knowingly permitted another to 
violate the Rules in question. 

mputed Disqualification 
 

3. Second, paragraph (b) addresses whether other lawyers in a firm can provide representation 
if a person or entity in the firm has violated the specified advertising rules or other provisions 
dealing with serious crimes and barratry, or has ordered, encouraged, or knowingly permitted 
another to engage in such conduct. The Rule clearly indicates that the other lawyers cannot 
provide representation if they knew or reasonably should have known that the employment 
was procured by conduct prohibited by the stated Rules. This effectively means that, in such 
cases,  the  disqualification  that  arises  from  a  violation  of  the  advertising  rules  and  other 
specified provisions is imputed to other members of the firm.   

estriction on Referral-Related Payments 

 

4. Paragraph (c) deals with situations where a lawyer knows or reasonably should know that a 
case  referred  to  the  lawyer  or  the  lawyer’s  law  firm  was  procured  by  violation  of  the 
advertising rules or other specified provisions. The Rule makes clear that, even if the lawyer’s 
conduct did not violate paragraph (a) or (b), the lawyer can continue to provide representation 
only if the lawyer does not pay anything of value, such as a referral fee, to the person making

VIII. MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF THE PROFESSION 

ule 8.01 Bar Admission, Reinstatement, and Disciplinary Matters 

n applicant for admission to the bar, a petitioner for reinstatement to the bar, or a lawyer in 
connection with a bar admission application, a petition for reinstatement, or a disciplinary 
matter, shall not: 

a) knowingly make a false statement of material fact; or 

b) fail to correct a misapprehension known by the person to have arisen in the matter, or 
knowingly  fail  to  respond  to  a  lawful  demand  for  information  from  an  admission, 
reinstatement, or disciplinary authority, except that this rule does not require disclosure of 
information otherwise protected by Rule 1.05. 

omment: 

. The duty imposed by this Rule extends to persons seeking admission or reinstatement to the 
bar as well as to lawyers. Hence, if a person makes a material false statement in connection 
with an application  for  admission  or  a petition for reinstatement, it may be the basis for 
subsequent disciplinary action if the person is admitted or reinstated, and in any event may be 
relevant in any subsequent application for admission or petition for reinstatement. The duty 
imposed by this Rule applies to a lawyers own admission, reinstatement or discipline as well 
as that of others. Thus,  for example, it is  a separate  professional  offense  for a  lawyer to 
knowingly make a material misrepresentation or omission in connection with a disciplinary 
investigation of the lawyers own conduct. Likewise, it is a separate professional offense for a 
lawyer  to  fail  to  respond  to  a  lawful  demand  for  information  of  a  disciplinary  authority 
inquiring into that lawyers professional activities or conduct. Cf State Bar Rules, Art. X, sec. 
7(4). This Rule also requires affirmative clarification of any misunderstanding on the part of 
the admissions, reinstatement or disciplinary authority of which the person involved becomes 
aware. 

.  This  Rule  is  subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  of  the  United  States 
Constitution and corresponding provisions of Article 1, Section 10 of the Texas Constitution. 
A person  relying on such a provision in response to  a specific  question  or more  general 
demand for information, however, should do so openly and not use the right of nondisclosure 
as an unasserted justification for failure to comply with this Rule.  Cf State Bar Rules, Art. X, 
sec. 7(4). 

. A lawyer representing an applicant for admission or petitioner for reinstatement to the bar, 
or  representing  a  lawyer  who  is  the  subject  of  a  disciplinary  inquiry  or  proceeding,  is 
governed by the rules applicable to the client-lawyer relationship, including those concerning 
the confidentiality of attorney-client communications. If such communications are protected 
under Rule 1.05, the lawyer need not and should not disclose them under this Rule. See also 
Rule 8.03(c).

ule 8.02 Judicial and Legal Officials 

a) A lawyer shall not make a statement that the lawyer knows to be false or with reckless 
disregard  as  to  its  truth  or  falsity  concerning  the  qualifications  or  integrity  of  a  judge, 
adjudicatory official or public legal officer, or of a candidate for election or appointment to 
judicial or legal office. 

b) A lawyer who is a candidate for judicial office shall comply with the applicable provisions 
of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct. 

c) A lawyer who is a candidate for an elective public office shall comply with the applicable 
provisions of the Texas Election Code. 

omment: 

. Assessments by lawyers are relied on in evaluating the professional or personal fitness of 
persons being considered for election or appointment to judicial office and to public legal 
offices, such as attorney general, prosecuting attorney and public defender. Expressing honest 
and candid opinions on such matters contributes to improving the administration of justice. 
Conversely, false statements by a lawyer can unfairly undermine public confidence in the 
administration of justice. 

. When a lawyer seeks judicial or other elective public office, the lawyer should be bound by 
applicable limitations on political activity. 

. To maintain the fair and independent administration of justice, lawyers are encouraged to 
continue traditional efforts to defend judges and courts unjustly criticized. 

ule 8.03 Reporting Professional Misconduct 

a) Except as permitted in paragraphs (c) or (d), a lawyer having knowledge that another 
lawyer has committed a violation of applicable rules of professional conduct that raises a 
substantial question as to that lawyers honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other 
respects, shall inform the appropriate disciplinary authority. 

b) Except as permitted in paragraphs (c) or (d), a lawyer having knowledge that a judge has 
committed a violation of applicable rules of judicial conduct that raises a substantial question 
as to the judges fitness for office shall inform the appropriate authority. 

c) A lawyer having knowledge or suspecting that another lawyer or judge whose conduct the 
lawyer is required to report pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Rule is impaired by 
chemical dependency on alcohol or drugs or by mental illness may report that person to an 
approved peer assistance program rather than to an appropriate disciplinary authority. If a 
lawyer elects that option, the lawyers report to the approved peer assistance program shall 
disclose any disciplinary violations that the reporting lawyer would otherwise have to disclose 
to the authorities referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b).

(d) This rule does not require disclosure of knowledge or information otherwise protected as 
confidential information: 

(1) by Rule 1.05 or 

(2) by any statutory or regulatory provisions applicable to the counseling activities of 
the approved peer assistance program. 
 

(e) A lawyer who has been convicted or placed on probation, with or without an adjudication 
of  guilt,  by  any  court  for  barratry,  any  felony,  or  for  a  misdemeanor  involving  theft, 
embezzlement,  or  fraudulent  or  reckless  misappropriation  of  money  or  other  property  – 
including a conviction or sentence of probation for attempt, conspiracy, or solicitation – must 
notify the chief disciplinary counsel within 30 days of the date of the order or judgment. The 
notice must include a copy of the order or judgment.  

f)    A  lawyer  who  has  been  disciplined  by  the  attorney-regulatory  agency  or  another 
jurisdiction, or by a federal court or federal agency, must notify the chief disciplinary counsel 
within 30 days of the date of the order or judgment. The notice must include a copy of the 
order or judgment. For purposes of this paragraph, “discipline” by a federal court or federal 
agency means a public reprimand, suspension, or disbarment; the term does not include a 
letter of “warning” or “admonishment” or a similar advisory by a federal court of federal 
agency. 

omment: 

.  Self-regulation  of  the  legal  profession  requires  that  members  of  the  profession  take 
effective  measures  to  protect  the  public  when  they  have  knowledge  not  protected  as  a 
confidence that a violation of these rules has occurred. Lawyers have a similar obligation with 
respect to judicial misconduct. 

. There are two ways that a lawyer may discharge this obligation. The first is to initiate a 
disciplinary investigation. See paragraphs (a) and (b). The second, applicable only where the 
reporting lawyer knows or suspects that the other lawyer or judge is impaired by chemical 
dependency on alcohol or drugs or by mental illness, is to initiate an inquiry by an approved 
peer assistance program. (See V.T.C.A., Health & Safety Code, ch. 467.) Under this Rule, a 
lawyer having reason to believe that another lawyer or judge qualifies for the approved peer 
assistance program reporting alternative may report that person to such a program, to an 
appropriate disciplinary authority, or to both. Frequently, the existence of a violation cannot 
be established with certainty until a disciplinary investigation or peer assistance program 
inquiry has been undertaken. Similarly, an apparently isolated violation may indicate a pattern 
of misconduct that only such an investigation or inquiry can uncover. Consequently, a lawyer 
should not fail to report an apparent disciplinary violation merely because he or she cannot 
determine its existence or scope with absolute certainty. Reporting a violation is especially 
important where the victim is unlikely to discover the offense absent such a report.  

. It should be noted that this Rule describes only those disciplinary violations that must be 
revealed by the disclosing lawyer in order for that lawyer to avoid violating these rules. It is 
not intended to, nor does it, limit those actual or suspected violations that a lawyer may report 
 

108 

  3

 

   

 

  (

  C

  1

  2

to  an  appropriate  disciplinary  authority.  Similarly,  a  lawyer  knowing  or  suspecting  that 
another lawyer or judge is impaired by chemical dependency on alcohol or drugs or by mental 
illness may inform an approved peer assistance program of that concern even if unaware of 
any disciplinary violation committed by the supposedly impaired person. 

. If a lawyer were obliged to report every violation of these rules, the failure to report any 
violation  would  itself  be  a  professional  offense.  Such  a  requirement  existed  in  many 
jurisdictions but proved to be unenforceable. This Rule limits the reporting obligation to those 
offenses  that  a  self-regulating  profession  must  vigorously  endeavor  to  prevent.  Similar 
considerations  apply  to  the  reporting  of  judicial  misconduct.  A  measure  of  judgment  is, 
therefore, required in complying with the provisions of this Rule. The term substantial refers 
to the seriousness of the possible offense and not the quantum  of evidence  of which  the 
lawyer  is  aware.  The  term  fitness  has  the  meanings  ascribed  to  it  in  the  Terminology 
provisions of these Rules. 

. A report to a disciplinary authority of professional misconduct by a lawyer should be made 
and processed in accordance with the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure. Comparable 
reports to approved peer assistance programs should follow the procedures those programs 
have established. A lawyer need not report misconduct where the report would involve a 
violation of Rule 1.05 or involve disclosure of information protected as confidential by the 
statutes or regulations governing any approved peer assistance program. However, a lawyer 
should  consider  encouraging  a  client  to  consent  to  disclosure  where  prosecution  of  the 
violation would not substantially prejudice the client's interests. Likewise, the duty to report 
professional misconduct does not apply to a lawyer retained to represent a lawyer whose past 
professional conduct is in question. Such a situation is governed by the rules applicable to the 
client-lawyer relationship. 

ule 8.04 Misconduct 

a) A lawyer shall not: 

(1) violate these rules, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through 
the acts of another, whether or not such violation occurred in the course of a client-
lawyer relationship; 

(2) commit a serious crime or commit any other criminal act that reflects adversely on 
the lawyers honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; 

(3) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; 

(4) engage in conduct constituting obstruction of justice; 

(5) state or imply an ability to influence improperly a government agency or official; 

(6)  knowingly  assist  a  judge  or  judicial  officer  in  conduct  that  is  a  violation  of 
applicable rules of judicial conduct or other law; 

(7) violate any disciplinary or disability order or judgment;

(9) engage in conduct that constitutes barratry as defined by the law of this state; 

(10) fail to comply with section 13.01 of the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure 
relating to notification of an attorneys cessation of practice; 

(11) engage in the practice of law when the lawyer is on inactive status, except as 
permitted by section 81.053 of the Government Code and Article XIII of the State Bar 
Rules,  or  when  the  lawyers  right  to  practice  has  been  suspended  or  terminated, 
including but not limited to  situations where  a  lawyers right  to  practice has been 
administratively suspended for failure to timely pay required fees or assessments or 
for failure to comply with Article XII of the State Bar Rules relating to Mandatory 
Continuing Legal Education; or 

(12) violate any other laws of this state relating to the professional conduct of lawyers 
and to the practice of law. 

b)  As  used  in  subsection  (a)(2)  of  this  Rule,  serious  crime  means  barratry;  any  felony 
involving moral turpitude; any misdemeanor involving theft, embezzlement, or fraudulent or 
reckless  misappropriation  of  money  or  other  property;  or  any  attempt,  conspiracy,  or 
solicitation of another to commit any of the foregoing crimes. 

omment: 

. There are four principal sources of professional obligations for lawyers in Texas: these 
rules, the State Bar Act, the State Bar Rules, and the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure 
(TRDP). All lawyers are presumed to know the requirements of these sources. Rule 8.04(a)(1) 
provides a partial list of conduct that will subject a lawyer to discipline. 

. Many kinds of illegal conduct reflect adversely on fitness to practice law. However, some 
kinds of offenses carry no such implication. Traditionally in this state, the distinction has been 
drawn in terms of those crimes subjecting a lawyer to compulsory discipline, criminal acts 
relevant to a lawyer’s fitness for the practice of law, and other offenses. Crimes subject to 
compulsory discipline are governed by TRDP, Part VIII. In addition, although a lawyer is 
personally  answerable  to  the  entire  criminal  law,  a  lawyer  should  be  professionally 
answerable only for criminal acts that indicate a lack of those characteristics relevant to the 
lawyer’s fitness for the practice of law. A pattern of repeated criminal acts, even ones of 
minor significance when considered separately, can indicate indifference to legal obligations 
that legitimately could call a lawyer’s overall fitness to practice into question. See TRDP, Part 
VIII; Rule 8.04(a)(2). 

. A lawyer may refuse to comply with an obligation imposed by law upon a good faith 
belief,  openly  asserted,  that  no  valid  obligation  exists.  The  provisions  of Rule

1.02(c) concerning a good faith challenge to the validity, scope, meaning or application of the 
law apply to challenges to legal regulation of the practice of law. 

. Lawyers holding public office assume legal responsibilities going beyond those of other 
citizens. A lawyer’s abuse of public office can suggest an inability to fulfill the professional 
role of attorney. The same is true of abuse of positions of private trust. 

ule 8.05 Jurisdiction 

a) A lawyer is subject to the disciplinary authority of this state, if admitted to practice in this 
state or if specially admitted by a court of this state for a particular proceeding. In addition to 
being answerable for his or her conduct occurring in this state, any such lawyer also may be 
disciplined in this state for conduct occurring in another jurisdiction or resulting in lawyer 
discipline in another jurisdiction, if it is professional misconduct under Rule 8.04. 

b) A lawyer admitted to practice in this state is also subject to the disciplinary authority of 
this state for: 
 

(1) an advertisement in the public media that does not comply with these rules and 
that is broadcast or disseminated in another jurisdiction, even if the advertisement 
complies with the rules governing lawyer advertisements in that jurisdiction, if the 
broadcast  or  dissemination  of  the  advertisement  is  intended  to  be  received  by 
prospective clients in this state and is intended to secure employment to be performed 
in this state; and 

(2) a written solicitation communication that does not comply with these rules and 
that is mailed in another jurisdiction, even if the communication complies with the 
rules governing written solicitation communications by lawyers in that jurisdiction, if 
the communication is mailed to an addressee in this state or is intended to secure 
employment to be performed in this state. 

omment: 

. This Rule describes those lawyers who are subject to the disciplinary authority of this state. 
It includes all lawyers licensed to practice here as well as lawyers admitted specially for a 
particular proceeding. This Rule is not intended to have any effect on the powers of a court to 
punish lawyers for contempt or for other breaches of applicable rules of practice or procedure. 

. In modern practice lawyers licensed in Texas frequently act outside the territorial limits or 
judicial system of this state. In doing so, they remain subject to the governing authority of this 
state. If their activity in another jurisdiction is substantial and continuous, it may constitute 
the practice of law in that jurisdiction. See Rule 5.05. 

. If the rules of professional conduct of this state and that other jurisdiction differ, principles 
of  conflict  of  laws  may  apply.  Similar  problems  can  arise  when  a  lawyer  is  licensed  to 
practice in more than one jurisdiction and these jurisdictions impose conflicting obligations. 
A related problem arises with respect to practice before a federal tribunal, where the general 
authority of the state to regulate the practice of law must be reconciled with such authority as

federal tribunals may have to regulate practice before them. In such cases, this state will not 
impose  discipline  for  conduct  arising  in  connection  with  the  practice  of  law  in  another 
jurisdiction  or  resulting  in  lawyer  discipline  in  another  jurisdiction  unless  that  conduct 
constitutes professional misconduct under Rule 8.04. 

.  Normally,  discipline  will  not  be  imposed  in  this  state  for  conduct  occurring  solely  in 
another jurisdiction or judicial system and authorized by the rules of professional conduct 
applicable thereto even if that conduct would violate these Rules. If, however, the conduct is 
the solicitation of employment through the use of the public media or a written solicitation 
that is directed at a prospective client in Texas or is for employment to be performed in Texas, 
discipline will be imposed if the communication does not comply with Article Vll of these 
Rules. A lawyer admitted to practice in Texas cannot avoid the regulations of Article Vll by 
using the public media in another state or by mailing the written solicitation from another 
state. This is true without regard to whether the advertisement or solicitation complies with 
the laws or disciplinary rules of the other state from which it originates. 
 

IX. SEVERABILITY OF RULES 

f any provision of these rules or any application of these rules to any person or circumstances 
is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect any other provision or application of these rules 
that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application and, to this end, the 
provisions of these rules are severable. 

ule 9.01 Severability 

omment: 

he history of the regulation of American lawyers is replete with challenges to various rules 
on grounds of unconstitutionality. Because many of these Rules, particularly those in Article 
Vll, are interrelated to an extent, the voiding of a particular rule or of a single provision in a 
rule could raise questions as to whether other provisions should survive. Rule 9.01 makes it 
clear that these Rules should be construed so as to minimize the effect of a determination that 
a particular application or provision of them is unconstitutional. The process of amending the 
Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct is unusually difficult and time consuming 
and a decision invalidating one provision or application of a rule should not be expanded 
unnecessarily so as to invalidate other provisions or applications. These Disciplinary Rules 
have the specificity found in statues, and it is appropriate for Rule 9.01 to contain a provision, 
frequently  found  in  legislation,  that  reasonably  limits  the  effect  of  the  invalidity  of  one 
provision or one application of a rule.
