The  80th  regular  legislative  session  resulted  in  the  passage  of  a  number  of  bills  of  interest  to  the 

January 2008

judiciary, including:  
 

•  Funding  for  the  creation  of  ten  additional  district  courts  that  will  serve  Bastrop,  Burleson, 
Cameron, Collin, El Paso, Grayson, Grimes, Hidalgo, Lee, Montgomery, Waller counties and one 
new  criminal  district  court  in  El  Paso  County;  authority  for  the  creation  of  six  new  statutory 
county courts in El Paso, Hunt, Montgomery, Travis and Van Zandt counties; 

• 

Increased state funding for statutory county court judicial salaries and heightened salary levels for 
those statutory county court judges whose salaries were not increased in 2005; 

•  Higher jurisdictional limits and filing fees in justice courts and small claims courts; 

•  Positive changes in state judicial retirement system benefits; 

• 

Increased compensation for visiting judges; 

• 

Judicial longevity pay; 

•  Required judicial training in the area of child abuse and neglect; 

•  Clarification of juror reimbursement issues; 

•  Authority for judges to conduct emergency mental health detentions via video teleconferencing.   

This  report  briefly  summarizes  new  legislation  directly  impacting  the  Texas  judiciary.    It  does  not 
cover bills dealing with substantive areas of law, such as HB 8 – sex offenders.  It is anticipated that other 
entities  will  provide  legislative  updates  on  substantive  legal  topics.    This  report  focuses  on  legislation 
affecting the Texas court system, judges, clerks, and other judicial system actors.  We hope the report will 
be a useful resource for the judicial and legal community and all those interested in the administration of 
justice.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
