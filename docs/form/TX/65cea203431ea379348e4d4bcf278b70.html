First Court of Appeals Leave Policies 

mployee Leave Time 

  E

Overview of State of Texas Employee Leave System 

1. 
The employee leave system is considered an Aexception-based system of time-
keeping.@    That  is,  an  employee  automatically  accrues  certain  types  and 
amounts of leave time on a monthly basis, but is expected to report and account 
for any exception to the accrual.   

It is First Court policy that every employee must request approval from his or 
her supervisor before being absent from work and a corresponding Request for 
Leave  form  must  be  signed  by  the  supervisor.    Every  employee  has  the 
responsibility  to  submit  the  signed  Request  for  Leave  form  to  the  court's 
supervisory  personnel  designated  to  complete  the  necessary  leave  reports 
required by the State of Texas. 

When a non-exempt employee (all non-legal staff, with the exception of the 
Clerk of court and chief deputy clerk) does not work 40 hours in a work week, 
and the Court has not been officially closed on a work day, a signed Request 
for Leave form  must be submitted to establish the amount of time  excepted 
from that 40-hour work week. 

A  Request  for  Leave  form  submitted  by  the  chief  deputy  clerk,  the  staff 
services  officer,  a  deputy  clerk,  or  a  member  of  the  administrative  staff  is 
signed by the Clerk of the court, or designee.   

Exempt employees (all legal staff, the Clerk of the court and the chief deputy 
clerk)  must also submit Request for Leave forms for any leave or sick time 
used.  A law clerk's Request for Leave form is signed by the assigned judge or 
staff lawyer assigned to that judge.  A staff lawyer's Request for Leave form is 
signed by their assigned judge or, in the absence of the judge, the chief staff 
attorney.  

The Chief Justice  signs Request for Leave forms for the Clerk of court and 
chief staff attorney.  

2. 

Some Specific Types of State Leave 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Annual Leave 

a. 
Annual  leave,  or  paid  vacation  time,  is  accrued  on  a  monthly  basis 
determined by length of service.  Employees with less than two years 
of service accrue 8 hours of paid vacation time per month; employees 
with more than two years of service accrue nine (9) hours per month, 
up to 21 hours a month for a 35+ year employee.  An employee may 
carry into a new fiscal year certain amounts of annual leave time up to 
an established maximum that, if not used, automatically converts to sick 
leave.    The  monthly  Employee  Leave  Summary  states  when  an 
employee  is  reaching  an  automatic  conversion  point.    Additional 
information may be found on the website for the Employees Retirement 
System of Texas, www.ers.state.tx.us. 

Although  annual  leave  accrues  from  the  first  date  of  employment, 
vacation  with  pay  may  not  be  taken  until  an  employee  has  been 
continuously  employed  for  six  months.    An  employee  who  has  been 
continuously  employed  for  six  months  and  who  then  resigns,  is 
dismissed, or otherwise separates from state employment is entitled to 
be paid for accrued and unused vacation time. 

A Request for Leave form must be signed by the employee's supervisor 
in  advance  of  the  use  of  accrued  vacation  time  or  as  soon  as  is 
practicable.   

Sick Leave 

b. 
A State employee accrues sick leave at the rate of 8 hours per month 
from the first day of employment.  Unused accrued sick leave can be 
carried  forward  annually.    Sick  leave  is  available  for  an  employee's 
illness, injury, pregnancy and confinement, and for when an employee 
must care for a member of his or her immediate family who is actually 
ill.  

An employee who is absent from work due to an illness must notify his 
or  her  supervisor  at  the  earliest  practicable  time.    To  be  eligible  for 
accumulated sick leave, with pay, for a continuous period of more than 
three working days, an employee must provide a doctor's certification, 
or on the Request for Leave form, without violating the provisions of 
HIPPA, must provide an acceptable written statement of facts about the 
absence.  For less than three continuous days of sick leave without  a 
reduction in pay, the Chief Justice has the discretion to require a doctor's 
certificate  or  on  the  Request  for  Leave  form,  without  violating  the 
provisions of HIPPA, an acceptable written statement of facts about the 
absence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

With  reasonable  advance  notice  to  the  employee=s  supervisor,  an 
employee may use up to eight hours of sick leave each calendar year to 
attend  parent-teacher  conference  sessions  for  the  employee's  child  or 
children who are in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade. 

For medical/dental appointments, a non-exempt employee should first 
request approval to be absent from work, and then submit a Request for 
Leave form for the actual amount of time the employee was away from 
the office. 

c. 

Compensatory Time  
(1)  Working More Than 40 Hours a Week 
The Fair Labor Standards Act applies to Texas employees.  This 
means that a non-exempt employee is entitled to compensation 
for any hours worked in excess of 40 hours in one work week.  
Compensation may be in the form of either 1.5 hours per each 
hour  worked  in  excess  of  40  hours  or,  at  the  discretion  of  the 
employing state entity, pay at the rate of 1.5  times the regular 
pay in effect for the employee when the excess time was worked.  
The First Court's overtime policy only allows for the possibility 
of earning compensatory time off under specific circumstances; 
earning additional pay for overtime is not available.   

A non-exempt employee may only work 8 hours a day, unless 
the employee's supervisor has approved a prior written request 
for work time in excess of 8 hours.  Such written request must 
provide  a  detailed  explanation  of  the  reason(s)  the  employee 
finds it necessary to work longer than the usual work day, that 
is,  why  the  employee  has  been  unable  to  complete  the  work 
during  the  regular  hours  during  the  work  week.    When  the 
employee  claims  compensatory  time  earned  this  way,  the 
supervisor's  authorization  must  be  attached  to  the  Request  for 
Leave form.   

Paid leave or holidays taken during a work week are not counted 
as  hours  worked  in  determining  FLSA  overtime  hours.    Any 
compensatory time earned must be used within twelve months 
of  the  end  of  the  work  week  in  which  it  was  earned,  or  the 
employee  loses  the  time.    The  First  Court  also  requires  an 
employee  to  exhaust  any  FLSA  overtime  hours  before  using 
annual leave.  

Compensatory  time  off  for  exempt  employees  is  within  the 
discretion of the judge to whom the exempt employee reports.   

(2)  Working National or State Holidays 
For each fiscal year, the State of Texas publishes a list of three 
types of holidays:  national, state, and optional.  An employee is 
entitled  to a  paid day  off from  work for  each  national  or  state 
holiday  that  does  not  fall  on  a  Saturday  or  Sunday,  and  if  the 
employee is not on unpaid leave.  

The First Court is officially closed on all national holidays, the 
Friday  after  Thanksgiving  Day,  and  December  24th  and 
December  26th,  when  those  days  fall  on  a  weekday.    Days 
designated  as  state  holidays  are  considered  Skeleton  Crew 
Holidays when the Court is open and is required to have enough 
employees on duty to conduct its official business. 

An employee who works a Skeleton Crew Holiday is entitled to 
compensatory time off during the 12-month period following the 
date  worked.    Employees  are  required  to  give  reasonable 
advance  notice  when  taking  this  compensatory  time,  although 
the reason for the request is not required.  The Request for Leave 
form  must  state  the  date  of  the  Skeleton  Crew  Holiday  being 
claimed for comp time. 

Every year, the State designates some religious holidays such as 
Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and Good Friday that fall on week 
days  as  Optional  Holidays.    An  employee  may  substitute  an 
Optional Holiday for a Skeleton Crew Holiday during the same 
fiscal  year  as  the  Optional  Holiday  worked.    The  Request  for 
Leave form must state the Optional Holiday being substituted for 
the Skeleton Crew Holiday.   

n addition, the Chief Justice may allow an employee to observe 
Cesar  Chavez  Day  as  a  state  holiday,  instead  of  another  state 
holiday  that falls on a  weekday  when the agency  must remain 
open  for  business  at  minimum  staffing  levels  (ie.  a  Skeleton 
Crew Holiday).

The Court leave provisions are incorporated herein by reference and the following 
supplement is provided: 

mergency  Leave:  The  Chief Justice  may  grant  emergency  leave  for  a  reason 
other  than  a  reason  described  under  section  661.902(a)  of  the  Government  Code, 
which provides emergency leave because of a death in the employee’s family. 

he  Chief  Justice  shall  grant  emergency 

leave if 

1)  the employee requests the leave; and 
2)  the  Chief Justice determines  the  employee  has  shown  good  cause  for  taking 

emergency leave; and 

3)  the Chief Justice believes in good faith that the employee being granted the leave 
intends to return to the employee’s position upon expiration of the leave granted. 

uidelines  for  emergency leave are  provided  below  in  this  policy  section. 

ot later than October 1 of each year, the Chief Justice or the Chief Justice’s designee

reasonable time off with pay to a Court employee due to the death of the employee's 
spouse, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, or  grandchild or a  child, parent, sibling, 
grandparent, or grandchild of the employee’s spouse.  For the purpose of this policy, 
the  term  sibling  includes  an  employee’s  stepbrother  or  stepsister.  The  employee,

investigation is ineligible to receive leave for that reason under any other provision 
of Subchapter Z, Chapter 661 of the Government Code.  Not later than the last day 
of each quarter, the Court shall report to the State Auditor and the Legislative Budget

Donation of Blood 

g. 
An employee is allowed sufficient time off with pay to donate blood up 
to four times in a fiscal year.  The First Court defines Asufficient time 
off@ to mean not more than three (3) hours away from the employee=s 
desk.   

Before an employee takes time off to donate blood, a request for the time 
off  must  be  approved  in  writing  by  the  employee=s  supervisor.    On 
returning to work, an  employee  shall provide proof that the employee 
donated blood during the time off.  If an employee fails to provide proof 
of the blood donation, the First Court shall deduct the amount of time for 
which the employee was granted time off from the employee=s salary or 
accrued  leave,  whichever  the  employee  chooses.    TEX.    GOV=T  CODE 
661.917 (Vernon 2004).   

Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) 

The Department of Labor=s Fact Sheet 28 describes the rights and responsibilities of 
the  employer  and  employee  under  the  Family  and  Medical  Leave  Act  (FMLA).  
Additional  information  may  be  found  on  the  Department  of  Labor  posters  on  the 
bulletin  boards  in  the  9th  floor  break  room  and  the  10th  floor  coffee  bar.    General 
information is set out below, followed by Fact Sheet 28. 

Purpose of FMLA 

FMLA  requires  an  employer  to  provide  an  eligible  employee  with  up  to  12 
workweeks  of  unpaid,  job-protected  leave  during  a  12-month  period  of  time  for 
certain family and medical reasons.  An employee who takes FML must be returned 
to the same job, or a job with equivalent status, benefits, and pay. 

Availability of FMLA Unpaid Leave  

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

An eligible employee may take a total of 12 weeks unpaid FMLA leave for:  

(1) 
(2) 
(3) 
(4) 

the birth and subsequent care of a newborn child; 
the placement of a child for adoption or foster care; 
the need to care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition; 
a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to work. 

ASerious Health Condition@  

A serious health condition is defined as an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or 
mental condition that involves: 

inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential care facility; 
the  absence  of  more  than  three  calendar  days  from  work  that  also  involves 
continuing treatment by a health care provider; 
any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for prenatal care; 
a chronic serious health condition (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.); 
a period of incapacity that is permanent or long-term, due to a condition for 
which  treatment  may  not  be  effective  (e.g.,  Alzheimer=s,  stroke,  terminal 
diseases); 
any  absences  to  receive  multiple  treatments  that  would  likely  result  in 
incapacity  for  more  than  three  consecutive  days  if  left  untreated  (e.g., 
chemotherapy, physical therapy, dialysis, etc.).  

ntermittent Leave or a Reduced Work Schedule 

FMLA permits the use of intermittent leave or work on a reduced schedule when: 

(1)  medically necessary to care for a seriously ill family member, or because of 

the employee=s serious health condition or 

to care for a newborn or newly placed adopted or foster care child, if approved 
by the employer.   

STATE OF TEXAS AND THE FMLA   

se of Paid and Unpaid Leave 

 State of Texas employee is entitled to FMLA leave, if the employee has a total of 
at least 12 months of state service and has worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-
month period immediately preceding the commencement of leave.  A State employee 
is required to utilize all available paid vacation and sick leave while taking FMLA 
unpaid leave.  Paid and unpaid leave are exhausted concurrently, not consecutively.

However, when an employee on FMLA leave is also receiving temporary disability 
benefits payments or workers= compensation benefits, the employee is not required to 
utilize paid vacation or sick leave concurrently with the FMLA leave.  TEX. GOV=T 
CODE ANN. 661.912 Family and Medical Leave Act (effective September 1, 1999) 
(Vernon    2004);  General  Appropriations  Act,  75  Leg.  R.S.,  ch.  1452,  art.  IX,  ' 
9(14)(a), 1997 Tex. Gen. Laws 5535, 6363. 

Health Insurance During FMLA Leave 
When all paid leave has been exhausted, the State will continue to pay its portion of 
the employee=s premium for coverage under the group health plan.  During the unpaid 
FMLA  leave  period,  the  employee  must  pay  his  or  her  portion  of  the  insurance 
premium above the state-paid portion. 

If an employee fails to return to work after taking FML leave, the State may recover 
the health care premiums it paid on behalf of the employee.  

Effect of FMLA Leave   
Service credit, annual leave, or sick leave is not earned for any full calendar months 
of leave without pay while on FML.  This time is also not included in the calculation 
of the number of continuous months of employment for purposes of merit increases 
and leave. 
 

FIRST COURT of APPEALS AND THE FMLA 

Calendar Year Used to Calculate Eligibility 
The 12-week leave period is calculated forward starting on the first day designated as 
FMLA leave.  

Designation of Leave and Notice by Employer 
The First Court must designate leave, paid or unpaid, as FMLA-qualifying and will 
provide notice to the employee of the designation.  Once the First Court has acquired 
knowledge that the leave is for an FMLA reason, the employee will be notified that 
any applicable accrued paid leave will be designated as FMLA leave, will be reported 
in  the  State=s  timekeeping  system  as  FMLA  leave,  and  the  leave  will  be  counted 
against the 12-week FMLA leave entitlement.   

Notice of the designation should be  provided to the employee within two business 
days.  Leave cannot be retroactively designated as FMLA leave, unless the employee 
was absent for an FMLA reason and the First Court did not learn the reason until the 
employee=s return to work. 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

   

 

Notice by the Employee 
When the need for FMLA leave is foreseeable, the employee is required to provide a 
written 30-day advance notice before the leave is to begin.  The notice should include 
the anticipated timing and duration of the leave.  Notice must also be provided as soon 
as  practicable  if  the  dates  of  the  leave  change,  are  extended,  or  were  not  initially 
known.  When the need for FMLA leave is not foreseeable, notice must be provided 
Aas soon as practicable@ under the particular circumstances.  

Whether the need for FMLA leave is foreseeable or not, the employee should provide 
information sufficient to make the First Court aware that the employee needs FMLA-
qualifying leave, the anticipated timing and the duration.  Failure to provide notice, 
with no reasonable excuse for the delay, may delay the taking of FMLA leave until at 
least 30 days after the date the employee provides the required notice. 

The First Court may inquire further, if it is necessary to have more information about 
the need for the leave.  Any medical information the employee provides will be stored 
in the employee=s confidential medical file and kept separate from the personnel file. 

AAs Soon As Practicable@  
As  soon  as  practicable  means  under  the  particular  circumstances,  but,  at  the  least, 
verbal notice should be provided within two business days of when the need for leave 
becomes known to the employee.  
  
Standard Leave Forms Required 
In addition to providing notice, an employee is required to complete the First Court=s 
standard leave forms and follow its procedures for taking leave.   

Medical Certification Required for Serious Health Condition 
For  a  serious  health  condition,  the  First  Court  requires  a  medical  certification 
confirming that such a condition exists.  Once leave has been granted, the employee 
may  be  required  to  provide  updated  medical  information  on  a  periodic  basis.    To 
return  to  work  when  an  absence  was  caused  by  a  serious  health  condition,  the 
employee must provide a Afitness-for-duty@ certificate from the health care provider. 

Health Insurance  
Once the employee is on unpaid FMLA leave, to continue coverage under the State=s 
group  health  plan,  the  employee  must  make  arrangements  with  the  Court 
Administrator to pay his or her portion of the employee=s health insurance premium. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  Employee  Sick  Leave  Pool  (the  Pool)  consists  of  accrued  sick  leave  which  is 
voluntarily donated to the Pool by eligible employees of the First Court of Appeals.  
The Pool is intended to assist employees and their immediate families in dealing with 
a catastrophic illness or injury that forces them to exhaust all earned leave time or 
when the employee has exhausted all sick leave because of a previous donation of 
time to the Pool. 

Employee Sick Leave Pool Policy 

  T

1.00  STATUTORY AUTHORITY 

Pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  TEX.  GOV=T  CODE  ANN.  661.001B661.008  (Vernon 
2004),  the  Employee  Sick  Leave  Pool  Policy  is  established  for  the  First  Court  of 
Appeals. 

2.00 

DEFINITIONS 

 

2.01  Employee means an individual, other than a state officer, employed by a state 

agency. 

2.02  Catastrophic has been defined by the Employees Retirement System of Texas 
as  a  severe  condition  or  combination  of  conditions  affecting  the  mental  or 
physical  health  of  the  employee  or  the  employee=s  immediate  family  that 
requires the services of a licensed practitioner for a prolonged period of time 
and  that  forces  the  employee  to  exhaust  all  earned  leave  time  and  to  lose 
compensation from the State. 

The First Court of Appeals adopts this definition. 

2.03  Licensed practitioner means a practitioner, as defined in the Texas Insurance 

Code, who is practicing within the scope of his or her license. 

2.04  Immediate family means (1) an individual who resides in the same household 
as the employee and is related by kinship, adoption, or marriage; (2) a foster 
child of the employee who resides in the same household as the employee and 
who  is  under  the  conservatorship  of  the  Department  of  Protective  and 
Regulatory Services; (3) a minor child of the employee, regardless of whether 
the child lives in the same household. 

An employee may also apply for permission to withdraw time from the Pool 
for  a  spouse,  child,  or  parent  of  the  employee  who  is  not  included  in  the 
definition of immediate family, but who needs care and assistance as a direct 
result  of  a  documented  medical  condition.    Any  such  time  requested  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

withdrawn  is  strictly  limited  to  the  time  necessary  to  provide  care  and 
assistance for the documented medical condition. 

2.05  Earned leave time means all accrued sick, vacation, and compensatory time. 

2.06  Pool Administrator means the individual appointed by the governing body of 

a state agency to administer the agency=s sick leave pool. 

3.00  ADMINISTRATION OF THE POOL 

The  Court  Administrator  will  serve  as  the  Pool  Administrator  and  will  develop 
mechanisms to transfer accrued sick leave into and out of the Pool; develop rules and 
procedures for operation of the Pool; and develop forms for contributing leave to, and 
using leave from, the Pool. 

4.00  GENERAL PROVISIONS: 

4.01  An employee of the First Court of Appeals, other than a state official, is eligible 
to use time contributed to the Pool, if the employee has exhausted all of the 
employee=s earned leave time because of (1) a catastrophic illness or injury or 
(2) a previous donation of time to the Pool and, the employee will be forced to 
lose compensation from the State. 

4.02  An employee may not receive sick leave from the Pool in excess of one-third 

of the total time in the Pool or 90 days, whichever is less. 

4.03  An eligible employee may apply to the Pool Administrator for permission to 
withdraw leave time from the Pool for the employee=s own catastrophic illness 
or injury, or for a catastrophic illness or injury of a member of the employee=s 
immediate family. 

4.04 

If the employee is seeking to withdraw time because of a catastrophic illness 
or  injury,  the  employee  must  provide  the  Pool  Administrator  with  a  written 
statement from the licensed practitioner who is treating the employee or the 
employee=s immediate family member.   

The  statement  must  provide  sufficient  information  regarding  the  illness  or 
injury to enable the Pool Administrator to evaluate the employee=s eligibility.  
If  the  Pool Administrator  determines  that  the  employee  is  eligible,  the  Pool 
Administrator  shall  (1)  approve  the  transfer  of  time  from  the  Pool  to  the 
employee and (2) credit the time to the employee on the First Court=s leave 
records. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4.05  An employee with a catastrophic illness or injury is not required to contribute 

to the Pool before the employee may apply to use Pool leave. 

4.06  An employee who uses leave from the Pool is not required to pay that leave 

time back to the Pool. 

4.07 

If the employee is a contributing member of the Pool, the employee may apply 
to use the Pool for other than catastrophic illness or injury, when the employee 
has  exhausted  his  or  her  sick  leave  balance  in  the  same  fiscal  year.    Such 
employee  may  receive  credit  for  only  the  number  of  hours  they  have 
contributed to the Pool in the same fiscal year for absences other than those 
caused by catastrophic illness or injury. 

4.08  An  employee  must  exhaust  all  earned  leave  time  before  the  employee  is 
eligible to use leave from the Pool.  However, an employee who is off work 
due  to  an  on-the-job  injury  or  illness  is  not  required  to  exhaust  annual  or 
compensatory leave before becoming eligible to use leave from the Pool. 

4.09  An employee who has terminated from the First Court due to retirement may 
withdraw Pool contributions within 90 days of rehire to the First Court.  Such 
employee may receive credit for only the number of hours the employee has 
contributed to the Pool in the same fiscal year as retirement. 

4.10  An employee absent on time withdrawn from the Pool may use the time as sick 
leave earned by the employee, and the employee is treated for all purposes as 
if the employee were absent on earned sick leave. 

4.11  An employee=s request to withdraw time from the Pool more than once during 
a  fiscal  year  will  be  reviewed  by  the  Pool  Administrator  on  the  facts  and 
documentation  submitted  specific  to  the  necessity  for  the  multiple  requests.  
The facts and documentation supporting the request will be submitted to the 
Human Resources Committee and the Chief Justice before a final decision is 
made to grant or deny the additional withdrawal of time. 

4.12  The estate of a deceased employee is not entitled to payment for unused time 

withdrawn by the employee from the Pool. 

.00  CONTRIBUTING SICK LEAVE TO THE POOL 

  5

5.01  Contributions to the Pool are strictly voluntary on the part of each employee. 

5.02  Employees are encouraged to contribute to the Pool. 

5.03  An employee may contribute to the Pool one or more days of the employee=s 
accrued sick leave.   The  Pool Administrator  shall credit the Pool with the 
amount  of  time  contributed  by  the  employee  and  shall  deduct  a 
corresponding amount of time from the employee=s earned sick leave as if 
the employee had used the time for personal purposes. 

5.04  A contribution to the Pool by an active employee must be in increments of 
eight  hours,  but  a  retiring  employee  may  contribute  accrued  sick  leave  in 
increments of less than eight hours. 

5.05  A  retiring  employee  may  designate  the  number  of  the  retiring  employee=s 
accrued sick leave hours to be used for retirement credit and the number of 
the retiring employee=s accrued sick leave hours to be donated to the Pool. 

5.06  An employee who makes a contribution to the Pool may not stipulate who is 

to receive that contribution.
