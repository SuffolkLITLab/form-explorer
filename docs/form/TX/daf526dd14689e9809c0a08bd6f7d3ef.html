provide administrative support to the Regional Presiding Judges to implement these 
procedures.  References to the Office of Court Administration shall be to its Legal

.  The Regional Presiding Judges will maintain a list of those attorneys eligible for

Procedure. The list will provide the name, address, telephone number, and administrative

Code.

Article 11.071, Code of Criminal Procedure shall complete and submit an Application for 
Appointment as Counsel to the Regional Presiding Judges in care of the Office of Court 
Administration. The application can be obtained from the Office of Court Administration.

Criminal Procedure, have a continuing duty to report to the Office of Court 
Administration: 
(a)  a finding by any federal or state court of ineffective assistance of counsel during any 

criminal case; 

(b) a public disciplinary action by any federal or state licensing authority; 
(c)  a contempt finding by the Court of Criminal Appeals under Article 11.071, Section 

4A, Code of Criminal Procedure; or 

(d) a sanction imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeals under that Court’s 

Miscellaneous Rule 08-101.   

The attorney must notify the Office of Court Administration within 30 days of any such 
finding or action. 
 

8.  The Regional Presiding Judges may at any time, by majority vote, remove an attorney 

from the list of attorneys eligible for appointment under Article 11.071, Code of Criminal 
Procedure, if they determine that the attorney has:  
(a)  in any application for writ of habeas corpus filed in the trial court or forwarded to the 
Court of Criminal Appeals exhibited substandard proficiency in providing quality 
representation to defendants in death-penalty cases; 

(b) been found by any federal or state court to have rendered ineffective assistance of 

counsel in any criminal case; 

(c)  engaged in a practice of unprofessional or unethical behavior; or 
(d) failed to inform the Office of Court Administration of reportable actions under 

section 7 of these procedures. 

 

9.  (a) There is no appeal from the Regional Presiding Judges’ discretionary decision to 
remove an attorney from the list of attorneys eligible for appointment under Article 
11.071, Code of Criminal Procedure. However, an attorney may request reconsideration 
within 15 days of receipt of the Regional Presiding Judges’ removal notice.  
(b) If an attorney is removed solely for failure to complete the required MCLE, that 
attorney may be reinstated on the list after providing proof of completion of the required 
MCLE to the Office of Court Administration and obtaining approval to be reinstated by a 
majority of the Regional Presiding Judges. 
(c) If an attorney is removed from the list for any reason other than failure to complete 
the required MCLE, that attorney may reapply for inclusion in the list after 24 months. 
An attorney who reapplies under this subsection must demonstrate that the attorney’s 
current level of proficiency, effectiveness and professionalism as defense counsel meets 
the required standards in all respects (see 7(a), (b), (c), and (d) above), and the attorney 
must certify that, since the time of the attorney’s removal from the list, the attorney has 
handled at least three non-death-penalty writs of habeas corpus. The attorney shall submit 
copies of the materials he has filed in those cases with the Office of Court 
Administration. 
 

10. The convicting court may not appoint an attorney as counsel if the attorney represented 

the applicant at trial or on direct appeal unless:  
(a)  the applicant and the attorney request the appointment on the record, and 

(b) the convicting court finds good cause to make the appointment. 
 

11. The list of those attorneys eligible for appointment by the convicting court shall be 
available from Office of Court Administration, Legal Division, P. O. Box 12066, 
Capitol Station, Austin, Texas, 78711 and shall be posted on the Regional Presiding 
Judges’ website at http://www.txcourts.gov/organizations/policy-funding/administrative-
judicial-regions/ 

2. Those attorneys who on December 31, 2009 are on the list of attorneys eligible for 

appointment maintained previously by the Court of Criminal Appeals shall automatically 
remain on the list.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
