Executive Summary

A strong and independent judiciary is essential to meet the needs of the State of Texas and its citizens. 

Adequate  judicial  compensation  is  one  of  the  many  factors  that  contribute  to  the  support  of  a  well 

qualified judiciary.

In  2007,  the  Texas  Legislature  formed  the  Judicial  Compensation  Commission  (the  “Commission”) 
specifically  to  look  at  this  factor  and,  each  biennium,  recommend  the  proper  salaries  to  be  paid  by 
the state for all justices and judges of the Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeals, the courts of 
appeals, and the district courts.

DECEMBER 20224

Findings

Based on the information it has gathered and reviewed, the Commission makes the following findings:

• 

• 

In 2021, Texans passed a constitutional amendment to increase the qualifications to become a 
district and appellate judge. District judges must have 8 years as a practicing lawyer or judge, 
appellate judges must have 10.
In order to maintain a strong, qualified and independent judiciary, and in order to attract qualified 
candidates and retain experienced judges, appropriate judicial compensation is essential.

•  The last increase in the base pay for a district court judge was September 1, 2013.
•  The Legislature instituted a tiered judicial pay scale effective September 1, 2019, that is based on 
longevity providing for a 10 percent raise after 4 years of service, and another 10 percent raise 
after 8 years and longevity pay after 12 years of service.

•  79 percent of appellate and district judges have had 20 or more years of experience as an 

attorney, and 43 percent have had more than 30 years.

•  At the end of the 2017 -18 biennium, the state base salary of a district judge began to lag behind 
the rate of inflation and is currently lower than the salary paid in 1991 when factoring inflation. To 
keep up with inflation, the base salary of a district judge needs to be at least $162,294.

•  Among the 6 most populous states, Texas ranks last in salaries for judges on the state’s highest 

courts, appellate courts and district courts.1

1.  The six most populous states include California, Illinois, New York, Florida, Pennsylvania and Texas. 

JUDICIAL COMPENSATION COMMISSION5

•  When comparing Texas judicial salaries to the rest of the country, Texas judges continue to fall 

behind. At the district level, Texas judicial salaries rank 41st compared to other states, 23rd at the 
intermediate appellate level, and 29th at the highest appellate courts which include the Texas 
Supreme Court and Court of Criminal Appeals. The age of judges serving in the Texas judiciary is 
increasing, and it is anticipated that many may retire in the near future making it more important 
than ever to set compensation at a level adequate to recruit a future generation of judges to the 
bench.

•  Since the last increase in base compensation in 2013, most states have increased compensation 

for judges an average of 19-20 percent. 

The chart below shows the change in judicial salaries across the country during the past 10 years. Base 
salaries for judges increased in nearly every state, averaging an increase of 19 and 20 percent.

Recommendations

As a result of its findings, the Commission recommends a 22% increase to the base pay of a district 

judge split with an 11% increase in 2024 and another 11% increase in 2025. Raising the base salary of 

a district judge will also increase the salaries of appellate judges and other judicial positions that are 

tied to the base salary of a district judge. The base salaries for the 2024-25 biennium are shown in the 

tables below:

2.  If the Commission’s recommended salary increases are adopted, county supplements could increase to the amounts shown in the 
chart. (See Tex. Gov’t Code 659.012.) The current maximum county supplement for courts of appeals justices is $9,000 and for district 
court judges it is $18,000.

JUDICIAL COMPENSATION COMMISSION7

Other Recommendations

The  Legislature  instituted  a  tiered  pay  structure  for  judges  and  prosecutors  in  2019.  After  four  years 
of service they receive a 10 percent increase and another 10 percent increase after 8 years of service. 
Cross-Credit for service was not included in the legislation. For example, if a judge served for 8 years 
on the bench and then was elected district attorney, they would start back at the base salary as district 
attorney  instead  of  the  8  year  salary  they  would  have  received  if  they  remained  on  the  bench.  The 
Commission recommends the legislature amend current law to allow cross-credit between prosecutors 
and judges when calculating salaries based on the tiered system.3

Cost

The state fiscal impact of the judicial salary increases recommended by the Commission is estimated 
to be approximately $56.8 million for the 2024-25 biennium.4 Sixty-five percent of the total cost is for 
judicial salaries, thirty-five percent is for other salaries that are linked to the salary of a district judge. 
For  more  detailed  information  regarding  the  cost  of  implementing  the  Commission’s  recommended 
salaries, refer to Appendix A. 

 The Texas District and County Attorneys Association (TDCAA) has generated a list of elected district attorneys, county attorneys, 
3.
county court at law judges, and district judges who have served in more than one of these elected offices. TDCAA esti mates the cost of 
implementing cross-credit to be: $353,500 plus fringe benefits in FY 2024 and $353,500 plus fringe benefits in FY 2025.
4. This cost includes state-paid judicial salaries, longevity pay increases, increases in pay for state and county prosecutors, and 
increases in funding provided for statutory county court salaries.

DECEMBER 20228

History and Function of the Commission

The Judicial Compensation Commission was created by the 80th Legislature, effective September 1, 

2007.5 It is composed of nine members who are appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent 

of the Senate to serve six-year terms. No more than three members serving on the Commission may be 

licensed to practice law.

The Commission is responsible for making a report to the Texas Legislature each even-numbered year 
recommending  the  proper  salaries  to  be  paid  by  the  state  for  all  justices  and  judges  of  the  Supreme 
Court of Texas, the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas, the courts of appeals and the district courts. In 
recommending the proper salaries for the justices and judges, the Commission is required to consider 
the factors listed in Section 35.102(b) of the Texas Government Code. (See page 10).

The commission held its first meeting of the biennium on May 12, 2022, and reviewed data relating to 
the factors to be considered in setting judicial compensation. The commission met again and made the 
recommendations included in this report on August 4, 2022.

Current Structure of Judicial Salaries

 The 86th Texas Legislature passed HB 2384 and enacted a new salary structure for Texas judges that 
took  effect  September  1,  2019.6 The  new  salary  structure  rewards  continued  service  on  the  bench  by 
creating a tiered pay structure for Appellate, District and County Court at Law Judges. Under the new 
pay structure, judges receive a raise after 4 years of service and then again after 8 years of service. The 
new law also increased the amount of longevity pay for state judges and reduced the number of years 
of actual service needed to be entitled to longevity pay from 16 years to 12 years. The new pay structure 
did not raise the base pay of a district judge which is the benchmark that all state judicial salaries are 
based upon. The base salary for a district judge is $140,000, which has remained the same since 2013. 

In addition, Sections 31. 001 and 32. 001 of the Texas Government Code authorize counties to supplement 
the salaries of the courts of appeals justices and the district court judges that have jurisdiction in their 
counties.

On  the  state’s  highest  courts,  the  Chief  Justice  of  the  Supreme  Court  and  the  Presiding  Judge  of  the 
Court  of Criminal Appeals are entitled to an additional $2,500 from the state. None of the justices or 
judges sitting on the highest courts of Texas are entitled to receive any county supplements.

Presiding  judges  of  the  administrative  judicial  regions,8  and  district  judges  who  preside  over  silica  or 
asbestos multi-district litigation are entitled to additional compensation as well.9

6.  HB 2384
7.  If the Commission’s recommended salary increases are adopted, county supplements could increase to the amounts shown in the 
chart. (See Tex. Gov’t Code 659.012.) The current maximum county supplement for courts of appeals justices is $9,000 and for district 
court judges it is $18,000.

DECEMBER 202210

Factors Required to be Considered by the 
Commission

In determining what a “proper” salary would be, the Commission is required to consider the following 
eight factors:

FACTOR 1
the skill and experience required of the 
particular judgeship at issue;

FACTOR 2
the value of compensable service 
performed by justices and judges, as 
determined by reference to judicial 
compensation in other states and the 
federal government;

FACTOR 3
the value of comparable service 
performed in the private sector, 
including private judging, arbitration, 
and mediation;

FACTOR 4
the compensation of attorneys in the 
private sector;

FACTOR 5
the cost of living and changes in the 
cost of living;

10.  Government Code, Section 35.102(b).

FACTOR 6
the compensation from the state 
presently received by other public 
officials in the state, including:

a)  state constitutional officeholders;
b)  deans, presidents, and chancellors 
of the public university systems; 
and

c)  city attorneys in major 

metropolitan areas for which that 
information is readily available; 

FACTOR 7
other factors that are normally or 
traditionally taken into consideration 
in the determination of judicial 
compensation; and

FACTOR 8
most importantly, the level of overall 
compensation adequate to attract the 
most highly qualified individuals in 
the state, from a diversity of life and 
professional experiences, to serve in 
the judiciary without unreasonable 
economic hardship and with judicial 
independence unaffected by financial 
concerns.10

FACTOR  1:  SKILL  AND  EXPERIENCE  REQUIRED  OF  THE  PARTICULAR  JUDGESHIP  AT 
ISSUE

In 2021, Texans passed a constitutional amendment to increase the qualifications to become a district 
and appellate judge. District judges must be at least 25 years old and have been a practicing lawyer or 
judge,  or  both  combined  for  at  least  8  years.  Appellate  court  justices  and  judges  must  be  at  least  35 
years of age and have practiced law or been the judge of a court of record and practiced law for at least 
10 years. These changes in requirements will be applied to judges and justices elected or appointed to a 
term beginning after January 1, 2025. 

Data reviewed by the Commission show that the Texas state judiciary is very experienced. 79 percent of 
appellate and district judges have 20 or more years of experience as an attorney, and 43 percent have 
more than 30 years. In addition, current judges have been on the bench on average 5 to 9 years.

This information reveals that the Judiciary is able to 
attract individuals to the bench who have significant 
experience.  While  this  experience  may  be  viewed 
positively, it may also indicate that compensation is 
a barrier to younger but still experienced attorneys. 
Instead,  those  younger  attorneys  may  be  required 
to  pursue  private  practice,  where  compensation 
levels are often significantly higher, before entering 
public service.

With  the  reality  that  a  large  percentage  of  judges  and  justices  may  be  retiring  in  the  near  future,  it  is 
more important than ever to ensure that compensation is set at a level adequate to recruit the future 
generation of judges and justices to the bench. 

DECEMBER 202216

FACTOR 2: VALUE OF COMPENSABLE SERVICE PERFORMED BY JUSTICES AND JUDGES, 
AS  DETERMINED  BY  REFERENCE  TO  JUDICIAL  COMPENSATION  IN  OTHER  STATES  AND 
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

Other States - A wealth of data exists about the judicial salaries in other states. These data have been 
collected by the National Center for State Courts (“NCSC”) for each year since 1974. The NCSC provides 
data on the actual and “normalized” salaries of judges. The purpose of normalizing data is to allow for an 
apples-to-apples comparison of salaries between states by adjusting salaries in each state by a cost-of 
living factor to determine the purchasing power of that salary in a given state. The Center uses the most 
widely accepted United States source of cost-of-living indices, the indices produced by the Council for 
Community and Economic Research (C2ER, formerly known as the ACCRA organization).11

For its comparison of compensation in other states, the Commission first focused on salaries in the six 
most populous states, including Texas.

The Commission found that the state salaries of state judges in Texas continue to lag behind the salaries 
of judges at corresponding levels in all five states closest to Texas in population.

When comparing Texas judicial salaries to the rest of the country, Texas judges continue to fall behind. 
At the district level, Texas judicial salaries rank 41st compared to other states,  23rd at the intermediate 
appellate  level,  and  29th  at  the  highest  appellate  courts  which  include  the Texas  Supreme  Court  and 
Court of Criminal Appeals.

Federal Judges12  - The  Commission  did  review  Federal  Judicial  salaries,  but  noted  that  no  other  state 
ties its judicial salaries to federal salaries. The Commission did take notice that federal judge salaries far 
outpace Texas judges’ salaries.

FACTOR  3:  VALUE  OF  COMPARABLE  SERVICES  PERFORMED  IN  THE  PRIVATE  SECTOR, 
INCLUDING PRIVATE JUDGING, ARBITRATION AND MEDIATION

The Commission was unable to gather definitive information about the rates of compensation that can 
be obtained in the private sector by serving as a private judge, arbitrator or mediator. As a result, the 
Commission did not examine data for this factor.

12  Federal district court judges are currently paid $210,900; circuit court of appeals justices are paid $223,700, associate justices on the 
United States Supreme Court are paid $258,900 and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is paid $270,700.

FACTOR 4: COMPENSATION OF ATTORNEYS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR

The Commission reviewed data collected by the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) for its Texas Wages 
and Employment Projections. TWC defines experienced workers as the wage earned by the upper two-
thirds of all workers in the selected occupation. In 2020 the statewide average for an experienced lawyer’s 
salary was $177,645. According to TWC, the average salary statewide for all lawyers was $142,733.

The base pay of a district judge is less than the average salary for lawyers statewide and significantly 
less than the average salary for an experienced lawyer. Forty-three percent of Texas’ judges have been 
licensed attorneys for more than 30 years.

To become a judge, many attorneys may not only have to take a decrease in salary but may also have 
to relinquish many opportunities for income and investment due to the code of judicial conduct that is 
unique to the judicial branch of government.

FACTOR 5: COST OF LIVING AND CHANGES IN THE COST OF LIVING

Reported by the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Workers (CPI-U) 
is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket 
of consumer goods and services, such as transportation, food and medical care. 

The  following  chart  illustrates  the  relationship  between  judicial  salaries  and  the  CPI-U  from  1991  to 
present. From 1998 to 2005, judicial salaries stayed static while inflation (measured by the CPI-U) climbed 
by  20  percent.  This  trend  continued  again  between  2005  and  2013,  where  judicial  salaries  remained 
unchanged  while  inflation  increased  by  another  20  percent. The  salary  increase  effective  September 
1, 2013, brought the salaries to an amount that is slightly above the rate of inflation after having been 
outpaced by inflation from December 2005 (when the last salary increase prior to the September 2013 
increase was implemented) to September 2013, by 20.5 percent. Because the base salary of a district 
judge  has  not  been  raised  since  2013,  in  FY18,  the  base  state  salary  of  a  district  judge  fell  below  the 
compensation levels from 1991 when factoring in inflation. The base salary needed in 2022 to keep up 
with inflation is $162,294.

Fiscal Year

JUDICIAL COMPENSATION COMMISSION21

As noted in previous reports, the Commission also finds this chart to be a compelling display of:

• 
• 
• 

the inconsistent and unpredictable changes made to judicial salaries over the years;
the eroding power of inflation on judicial salaries; and
the substantial increases that had to be made to “catch up” salaries with the cost of living due to 
the inconsistent and infrequent adjustments made to judicial salaries. 

The Commission believes the tiered judicial pay structure that was instituted by the 86th Legislature was 
a tremendous step in the right direction for consistency for judicial salaries. However, it did not address 
the issue with recruitment as the base salary for state judges entering the bench has not been changed 
since 2013.  Regular, systematic increases in the base salary would make judicial compensation more 
predictable and would offset the effects of inflation.

FACTOR 6: COMPENSATION FROM THE STATE PRESENTLY RECEIVED BY OTHER PUBLIC 
OFFICIALS

The Commission is required by statute to consider the compensation from the state presently received 
by other public officials in the state, including state constitutional officeholders; deans, presidents, and 
chancellors of the public university systems; and city attorneys in major metropolitan areas for which that 
information is readily available. The Governor of Texas and Attorney General make $153,750. Chancellor 
salaries  vary  across Texas  based  on  university  size,  location,  experience  and  education  credentials  of 
the chancellor. The average salary of a chancellor in Texas is $286,794.13 This does not account for living 
expenses and other perks often provided that are not available to judges.

FACTOR 7: OTHER FACTORS TRADITIONALLY CONSIDERED

To provide the Legislature with information to facilitate legislation that ensures that the compensation 
of  state  judges  is  adequate  and  appropriate,  the  79th  Texas  Legislature  charged  the  Office  of  Court 
Administration  (OCA)  with  collecting  information  related  to  state  judicial  turnover.  Section  72.  030  of 
the Texas Government Code requires OCA to obtain data on the rate at which state judges resign from 
office or do not seek re-election, as well as the reason for these actions. The results for the latest report 
are available on OCA’s website.

The judicial turnover rate for the fiscal year 2020-2021 biennium was 16 percent, with 90 appellate and 
district  judges  leaving  the  state  judiciary.  Forty-eight  of  those  judges  left  voluntarily,  for  a  voluntary 
turnover rate of 8 percent.

The number of judges voluntarily leaving office by not seeking reelection has been generally increasing 
since 2004-2005.

JUDICIAL COMPENSATION COMMISSION23

FACTOR  8:  LEVEL  OF  OVERALL  COMPENSATION  THAT  IS  ADEQUATE  TO  ATTRACT  THE 
MOST HIGHLY QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS, FROM A DIVERSITY OF LIFE AND PROFESSIONAL 
EXPERIENCES,  TO  SERVE  IN  THE  JUDICIARY  WITHOUT  UNREASONABLE  ECONOMIC 
HARDSHIP AND WITH JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE UNAFFECTED BY FINANCIAL CONCERNS

The Commission viewed the analysis required by the first seven factors to be relevant to the analysis 
of the last factor. The Commission also recognizes that base compensation has not been increased for 
judges  since  2013  creating  potential  recruiting  problems.  Based  on  those  analyses,  the  Commission 
concludes that regular adjustments in compensation are necessary and appropriate in order to seek to 
attract the most highly qualified individuals, from a diversity of life and professional experiences, to serve 
in the judiciary without unreasonable economic hardship and with judicial independence unaffected by 
financial  concerns. Therefore,  the  Commission  recommends  that  the  base  salary  be  increased  by  11 
percent in 2024 and an additional 11 percent in 2025.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

Increases in the salaries of district judges result, by statute, in increases in pension benefits for other 
state  officials  and  employees.  The  reasons  why  a  judge’s  salary  should  or  should  not  be  increased, 
however,  are  different  from  the  reasons  why  benefits  of  other  public  officials  or  employees  should  or 
should not be increased. This is evident in the fact that the Commission, in making its recommendation 
about judicial pay, is asked to consider factors that are specific to judges. 

When a recommendation to increase judicial pay, however, leads to a significantly larger fiscal note than 
that required to increase judicial pay alone, the inevitable budget pressures make it, realistically, more 
difficult to achieve increase in judicial pay. Likewise, the linkage between an increase in a judge’s pay and 
an increase in a legislator’s pension benefits can lead to perceptions of a conflict of interest.

DECEMBER 202224

Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on its evaluation of the factors the Commission is required to consider, the Commission concluded 
that it is necessary and appropriate to adjust judicial salaries and recommends that salaries be established 
as shown below for the 2024 -25 biennium:
