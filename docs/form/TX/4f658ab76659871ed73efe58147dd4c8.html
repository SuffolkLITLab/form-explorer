      <pre>Fourth Court of Appeals 

State employees are entitled to a paid vacation each year.  The amount of time off each employee 
receives is determined by length of service.  Vacation accrual rates are the same for both hourly 
and salaried employees.  Part-time employees are also eligible for paid vacation, but their accrual 
rate and maximum carryover are proportional to the number of hours worked.  For example, half-
time  employees  earn  and  carry  over  annual  leave  at  one-half  the  rate  authorized  for  full-time 
employees.    The  amount  of  annual  leave  accrued  by  an  employee  is  based  on  his  or  her 
employment status on the first day of the month. 

In computing annual leave taken by an employee, absences due to holidays are not charged. 

SICK LEAVE 

State employees are entitled to sick leave subject to the following provisions: 

  An employee accrues sick leave beginning on the first day of state employment and ending 
on the last duty day of state employment.  Duty day means an employee’s last physical day 
on the job. 

  An employee who is on leave the first day of the month may not use that month’s accrual 

  An employee accrues sick leave at a rate of eight hours per month (prorated for part-time 

until he or she returns to duty. 

employees). 

  Sick leave may be used when an employee is prevented from performing his or her job due 
to  sickness,  injury,  pregnancy,  or  confinement.    It  may  also  be  taken  to  care  for  an 
immediate family member who is ill.  Immediate family is defined as individuals related 
by  kinship,  adoption,  or  marriage  who  live  in  the  same  household;  foster  children  who 
reside in the same household; and minor children regardless of whether or not the child 
lives in the same household.  Sick leave may be used to care for immediate family members 
who do not reside in the same household only because of a documented medical condition. 
  An employee who will be absent from work must notify his or her supervisor as soon as 

possible. 

  For the Clerk’s staff, an absence of greater than three days requires the employee to provide 
the Clerk of the Court a doctor’s certification or a written statement of the facts surrounding 
the  absence  and  the  nature  of  the  illness.    The  need  to  provide  such  documentation  for 
absences of three days or less is at the discretion of the Clerk. 

  Sick leave may be used by an employee while he or she is on vacation. 

Revised October 2017 

Human Resources Leave Policy 

 

NNUAL LEAVE 

  A

  Employees employed by multiple agencies cannot accrue sick leave at a rate that exceeds 

that of a full-time, 40-hour-per-week employee. 

  An employee who is a legal guardian of a child by court appointment may take sick leave 

to care for the child. 

  Sick leave may be taken for the adoption of a child under the age of three. 

EAVE WITHOUT PAY (LWOP) 

The Chief Justice may grant a leave of absence subject to the following provisions: 

  The leave is unpaid. 
  Except  in  instances  of  disciplinary  suspension,  workers’  compensation,  or  military 

situations: 

Annual leave must be exhausted. 

Sick leave, if appropriate, must be exhausted. 

  Subject to fiscal constraints, approval of LWOP constitutes a guarantee of employment for 

a specified period of time, not to exceed 12 months. 

  The Chief Justice may approve instances of LWOP on a case by case basis and may also 

allow for exceptions to these limitations. 

  Any full calendar month of LWOP does not constitute a break in employment but also does 
not count for purposes of state service credit with the exception of an employee returning 
from military leave without pay. 

n employee who is on LWOP will have his or her compensation reduced for the pay period at 

the hourly rate of pay times the number of hours on LWOP.   

FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE 

Eligibility for Family and Medical Leave (FML) is limited to employees who have worked for the 
State at least 12 months.  The 12 months need not be consecutive or continuous.  In addition, the 
employee  must  have  worked  a  minimum  of  1,250  hours  during  the  12  months  immediately 
preceding the start of leave.  For purposes of FML, the State is considered a single employer.  The 
Court will credit time worked for other state employers when considering FML eligibility.  Eligible 
employees  must  use  all  appropriate  paid  leave  while  taking  FML.    Sick  leave  may  be  used  in 
conjunction with FML when a child under the age of three is adopted, regardless of whether or not 
the child is ill at the time of adoption.   

Employees  on  worker’s  compensation  or  receiving  temporary  disability  benefits  cannot  be 
required to use, but may elect to use, paid leave prior to taking FML. 

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides all eligible employees a total of 12 weeks 
of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for the following: 

  The birth and subsequent care of a newborn child 
  The placement of a child for adoption or foster care 
  The need to care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition 
  A serious health condition that makes the employee unable to work

status and pay. 

  An employee who takes FML must be returned to the same job or a job with equivalent 

  The Court will continue the employee’s health benefits during the absence. 
  The Court can require the employee to provide a doctor’s certification. 
  FML may be used intermittently if required by a physician to care for a serious illness.  
Employees requesting intermittent leave to care for a newborn child, during adoption, or 
during foster care must obtain employer approval for the intermittent leave. 
If FML is used in one continuous block, the Court closure will count against the employee’s 
entitlement.  The exception to this is a closing of a week or more. 

 

  Holidays, ice days, and shutdowns do not count against employees who are on intermittent 

FML or a reduced work schedule. 

he Court will continue to pay its portion of the employee’s group health plan coverage during 

FML.  The employee is responsible for paying his or her portion of the premium. 

An employee does not earn state service credit, annual leave, or sick leave for any full calendar 
months of leave without pay while on FML.  This time is also not included in the calculation of 
the number of continuous months of employment for purposes of merit increases and leave. 

PARENTAL LEAVE 

Employees who do not qualify for FML are entitled to parental leave for the birth of a child or the 
adoption or foster care placement of a child under the age of three.  This entitlement provides up 
to 12 weeks (480 hours) of unpaid leave.  Accrued annual leave and applicable sick leave must be 
used while taking parental leave.  Because eligibility time requirements are different for parental 
leave (less than 12 months of state service) and family and medical leave [12 months (1,250 hours) 
or more of state service], an employee can meet requirements for only one of these entitlements. 

Employees with fewer than 12 months of state service or less than 1,250 hours in the 12 months 
immediately preceding the start of leave are entitled to a parental leave of absence, not to exceed 
12 weeks, for the birth of a natural child or the adoption or placement in foster care of a child under 
three years of age.  This period begins with the date of birth, or the first day the adoptive child is 
formally placed in  the home.  The employee must  use all available paid  annual  and sick leave 
before going on leave without pay while taking the parental leave. 

Employees anticipating using parental leave should notify the Clerk of the Court at the earliest 
possible opportunity in order to allow ample time to plan for covering duties for the duration of 
the absence.  Any additional time off must be requested in accordance with the leave without pay 
policy and must be approved by the Chief Justice. 

Parental leave is available for employees who are not eligible for FMLA leave. 

EMERGENCY LEAVE  

Death in Family - An employee is entitled to leave with pay for a death in the employee’s family.  
An employee’s family is defined as the employee’s spouse and the employee and spouse’s parents, 
children, brothers, sisters, grandparents, and grandchildren.   

  T

Revised October 2017 

Leave During Agency Investigation - The Chief Justice may grant leave without a deduction in 
salary to an employee who is: 

  The subject of an investigation being conducted by the court or another investigative entity; 

  A  victim  of,  or  witness  to,  an  act  or  event  that  is  the  subject  of  an  investigation  being 

conducted by the court or another investigative entity. 

or 

 

The court is required to report to the State Auditor’s Office and the Legislative Budget Board each 
quarter if an employee is granted 168 hours or more leave for being the subject of an investigation.  

Other Reasons - The Chief Justice may grant Emergency Leave to an employee for reasons other 
than bereavement if the employee shows good cause and the Chief Justice believes in good faith 
that the employee intends to return to work when the emergency leave ends. The granting of such 
leave is at the sole discretion of the Chief Justice, and is granted only if it is determined to be in 
the best interest of the court. 

Emergency  Leave  and  Workers’  Compensation  -  The  Chief  Justice  may  authorize  emergency 
leave pay for not more than 6 months to an employee receiving workers’ compensation benefits. 
Payment  will  not  exceed  the  difference  between  the  employee’s  basic  monthly  wage  and  the 
monthly amount of minimum benefits. 

Requests - Requests for Emergency Leave should be submitted to the employee’s supervisor, who 
in turn submits it to the Clerk of Court.   

Approval - Approval for emergency leave can only be granted or denied by the Chief Justice. 

Reporting - By October 1 of each year, the Clerk of Court is required to report to the Comptroller’s 
Office: 

  The name and position of each employee who is granted more than 32 hours of emergency 

leave during the previous fiscal year; 

  The reason for which the employee was granted the emergency leave; and 
  The total number of hours of emergency leave granted to the employee in that fiscal year. 

edical and Mental Health Care Leave for Certain Veterans 

  A veteran who is eligible for health benefits under a program administered by the Veterans 
Health Administration of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs is eligible to 
be granted up to 15 days of leave each fiscal year to obtain medical (including physical 
rehabilitation)  or  mental  health  care.   The  Chief  Justice  may  grant  additional  days  as 
deemed appropriate.
