      <pre>Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions

Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision

APPEAL NO.:

99-001

RESPONDENT:

Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee

DATE:

August 31, 1999

SPECIAL COMMITTEE:

Judge Pat McDowell, Judge B. B. Schraub, Judge David Peeples,
Judge Darrell Hester, Judge Ray D. Anderson

The applicant J. W. Payne is an attorney who represents two attorneys and a company who are the subject
of  an  investigation  by  the  Dallas  Subcommittee  of  the  Unauthorized  Practice  of  Law  Committee
(hereinafter,  both  the  subcommittee  and  the  committee  are  referred  to  as  “the  Committee”).    The
applicant’s clients each received a letter from an investigator for the Committee informing them that it  “has
received information that (they) have engaged in certain activities which may constitute the unauthorized
practice of law.”  Mr. Payne responded to the investigator’s letters by requesting, pursuant to Rule 12, an
inspection and copying of his clients’ UPL files.  He was provided with some information, such as copies
of Committee rules and a form letter which he had already received.  After another request, he was
provided some further information, such as copies of correspondence with potential investigators for the
Committee.
  
On June 25, 1999, the applicant filed this Rule 12 appeal stating that he had been denied access to the
judicial records of the Committee.  On July 9, counsel for the Committee sent the applicant copies of the
UPL files related to his clients and portions of Committee meeting minutes related to his clients.  Portions
of  the  documents  were  redacted,  and  the  investigator’s  notes  were  withheld  in  their  entirety.      The
documents  which  contained  redactions  were  (1)  an  April  15,  1999  report  from  the  Committee’s
investigator to its chairman; (2) a June 1, 1999 letter from the Committee’s investigator to its chairman; and
(3) portions of Committee meeting minutes from December 1998 to June 1999.  This appeal presents three
issues.

1.

Are the documents in question “judicial records?”

The threshold issue in a Rule 12 appeal is whether the records are “judicial records,” which are defined by
Rule 12.2(d) as follows:

“Judicial record means a record made or maintained by or for a court or judicial agency
in its regular course of business but not pertaining to its adjudicative function, regardless
of  whether  that  function  relates  to  a  specific  case.    A  record  of  any  nature  created,
produced, or filed in connection with any matter that is or has been before a court is not
a judicial record.”

These  records  are  judicial  records,  because  the  Committee  has  no  adjudicative  power.    In  re  Nolo
Press/Folk Law, Inc., 991 S.W.2d 768, 772, 783 (Tex. 1999).

2.

Are the documents in question exempt from disclosure?

Rule 12.5(k) exempts from disclosure the following:

“Investigations of character or conduct.  Any record relating to an investigation of any
person’s character or conduct, unless:

(1)

(2)

the record is requested by the person being investigated; and

release of the record, in the judgment of the records custodian, would not
impair the investigation.”

We have compared the redacted documents to the unredacted documents submitted to this committee for
in camera review.  The redacted information is related to Committee investigations of persons other than
this applicant’s clients, and is exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5(k).

Although the personal notes of the investigator were not provided to this committee, we conclude that they
are exempt from disclosure as privileged work product.  Rule 12.5(i) exempts from disclosure information
that is confidential or exempt from disclosure under other law.  As the Supreme Court noted, the UPL
Committee is empowered to seek adjudication of whether activities constitute the unauthorized practice
of law.  In re Nolo Press/Folk Law, Inc., 991 S.W.2d 768, 772 (Tex. 1999).  Thus, the investigator’s
notes are material prepared or mental impressions developed in anticipation of litigation within the meaning
of Rule 192.5 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, and are therefore exempt from disclosure under Rule
12.5(i).

Are  the  documents  in  this  Rule  12  appeal,  including  the  names  of  the  parties  being
investigated, confidential?

The applicant requested that all of the documents in this appeal, including the identity of the parties being
investigated, be kept confidential, to prevent harm to the reputation of these active members of the bar.
The confidentiality of these documents should be maintained by this committee and by the Office of Court
Administration, for the following reasons. 

lthough the documents are judicial records insofar as the UPL Committee is concerned, they are not
judicial  records  insofar  as  this  special  Rule  12  committee  is  concerned,  because  they    relate  to  its
adjudicative function.  Under Rule 12.9(k)(2), the Administrative director of OCA must maintain a copy
of  the  special  committee’s  decision  in  his  office  for  public  inspection.    Under  Rule  12.9(l),  the
Administrative Director of OCA must publish periodically to the judiciary and the general public the special
committee’s decisions.  Thus, Rule 12 specifically provides for publication of this committee’s decisions,
but does not provide that the documents in the appeal itself are open to the public. 

3.

  A

For the reasons stated, this review committee concludes that the applicant has been provided copies of all
of the documents to which he was entitled.  Access to the withheld and redacted information is denied.

Appeal No. 99-001
