STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2

ARGUMENT.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3

I.

The search of appellant’s vehicle was either reasonable at inception
because of the odor of marijuana or justified by the intervening
discovery of crack cocaine in his possession.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3

A.

B.

The statutory scheme at issue.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3

The findings of fact present either an interesting problem
or a swift solution. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5

1.

2.

3.

There is no authority for findings of fact on a
“carried” motion to suppress... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5
The trial court was entitled to believe Officer Rocky’s
claim that he smelled raw marijuana... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9
These findings effectively render appellant’s first
two issues moot.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11

C.

The possibility of an innocent explanation is largely
irrelevant to probable cause determinations.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11

Cause to search must be reasonably probable,
not certain.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11
This standard leaves a lot of room for reasonable
mistakes.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12
This is a feature, not a bug.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14

D.

A distinctive smell identical to that of contraband
constitutes probable cause... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16

1.

“Legal” hemp smells just like illegal marijuana.. . . . . . 16

i

2.

3.

“Legalizing” hemp did not change the Fourth
Amendment or reality.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16
The “marijuana is different” argument warps or ignores
the Fourth Amendment (and sometimes reality).. . . . . 17

a.

b.

“Medical marijuana” cases have spawned
two distinct schools of thought... . . . . . . . . . . . . 18
“Amount” states ignore or misconstrue the
Fourth Amendment because “marijuana is
different.”. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20
i.

Massachusetts ignores the Fourth
Amendment as a matter of policy... . . . . . 20
Vermont ignores common sense.. . . . . . . 23

ii.
iii. Maryland acknowledges the law but

applies it differently to marijuana.. . . . . . 25

4.

Officer Rocky had probable cause to search
appellant’s van.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27

E.

The discovery that appellant possessed crack cocaine on
his person attenuated any taint of illegality.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29

II.

Appellant’s claim of unlawful arrest was not preserved... . . . . . . . . 32

III. Appellant is guilty of tampering with evidence because he put it

where it could not be readily found by investigating officers... . . . . 34

A.

B.
C.
D.

“Conceal” includes placement outside another’s point of
view.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35
The Court of Criminal Appeals has not held differently... . . . 36
Appellant placed his crack where it could not easily be seen.. 37
Reformation to attempt is the proper alternative to
affirmation.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 39

PRAYER FOR RELIEF. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40

IN THE FIFTEENTH COURT OF APPEALS

OF THE STATE OF TEXAS

IVAN DRAGO, Appellant

THE STATE OF TEXAS, Appellee

STATE’S BRIEF ON THE MERITS

v.

*  *  *  *  *

*  *  *  *  *

TO THE HONORABLE FIFTEENTH COURT OF APPEALS:

The two issues properly before this Court can be resolved in two sentences. 

First, the odor of something that smells just like an illegal narcotic is still probable

cause  to  search  for  that  illegal  narcotic.    Second,  putting  crack  cocaine  where  it

cannot be easily seen is “concealing” it as that term is ordinarily used.

STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT

The  State  requests  oral  argument.    Whether  a  search  for  marijuana  can  be

justified on smell alone after the regulation of hemp is unanswered by any Texas

court  of  appeals.    The  issue  of  concealment  is  not  new  but  the  fact  pattern

distinguishes it from controlling authority.  Conversation will benefit this Court.

1

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

Appellant’s convictions for possession of a controlled substance and tampering

with evidence and should be affirmed.  

The crack cocaine in the vehicle he was driving was found as the result of a

lawful search based on the odor of marijuana.  That odor provided probable cause to

search notwithstanding the fact that hemp, which smells the same as marijuana, is

legal to possess in a vehicle under limited circumstances.  Innocent explanations do

not vitiate probable cause.  If this search was unreasonable at inception, the taint of

the illegal search was attenuated by the discovery of crack in appellant’s possession

after he was removed from his vehicle.  That discovery provided probable cause to

search the vehicle for more crack.

Appellant’s complaint of illegal arrest was not preserved.

Appellant was convicted of tampering with evidence because he successfully

if temporarily hid his crack from law enforcement’s view with the intent to make it

unavailable in their investigation.  This interpretation comports with the common

meaning of “conceal” and best serves the purpose of the statute.  

2

ARGUMENT

I.

The search of appellant’s vehicle was either reasonable at inception because
of  the odor of marijuana or justified by the intervening discovery of crack
cocaine in his possession.

Officers have probable cause to search a vehicle for marijuana when they detect

the smell of marijuana coming from it.  This has been and continues to be the law

notwithstanding the limited ability to lawfully transport plant material—hemp—that

smells identical to marijuana.  If the regulated possession of hemp makes such a

search unreasonable, the discovery of crack on appellant after his removal from the

vehicle was an intervening circumstance that attenuated the taint of the illegal search.

A.

The statutory scheme at issue.

Title  5, Subtitle F, of the Agriculture Code creates a scheme to create and

regulate a hemp industry.  A license is required to “cultivate or handle” hemp, as

those terms are defined.1  Relevant to this case, raw hemp can be possessed in a

vehicle without a license but only during the transport between the premises of a

license  holder  to  1)  another  license  holder’s  premises  or  2)  someone  licensed  to

1  TEX. AGRIC. CODE § 122.101(a).  See TEX. AGRIC. CODE § 122.001(1) (“‘Cultivate’ means to
plant, irrigate, cultivate, or harvest a hemp plant.”), (3) (“‘Handle’ means to possess or store a hemp
plant: (A) on premises owned, operated, or controlled by a license holder for any period of time; or
(B) in a vehicle for any period of time other than during the actual transport of the plant from a
premises owned, operated, or controlled by a license holder to: (i) a premises owned, operated, or
controlled by another license holder; or (ii) a person licensed under Chapter 443, Health and Safety
Code.”).  By implication, anyone can legally possess hemp without a license or paperwork so long
as they do not possess it on the property of a license holder or in a vehicle.

manufacture consumable hemp products.2  Transportation of “hemp plant material”

is prohibited unless the material is produced according to this regulatory scheme and

is accompanied by the requisite paperwork.3  The person transporting it must not

transport any other cargo with it, and must furnish the required documentation upon

request.4  Violation of these rules is subject to both civil penalty5 and a misdemeanor

conviction punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000.6  

This regulatory scheme specifies the “powers and duties of peace officers”:7

A  peace  officer  “may  inspect  and  collect”  material  found  in  a

if the officer has probable cause to believe marijuana or some

•

None of this “limit[s] or restrict[s] a peace officer from enforcing
to the fullest extent the laws of this state regulating marihuana
and controlled substances, as defined by Section 481.002, Health
and Safety Code.”11

Read together, these statutes provide for the lawful interference with property rights

to ensure this regulatory scheme is not used to further the marijuana trade.

B.

The findings of fact present either an interesting problem or a swift solution. 

The  trial  court  issued  findings  of  fact  at  appellant’s  request.    Although

appellant did not object in the trial court, he now claims that two findings—3 and

4—“have no evidentiary support.”12  The underlying assumption is that trial courts

have authority to issue findings of fact on a motion to suppress carried with a bench

trial.  That is not at all clear.  If they can, the complained-of findings are supported

by the record and render appellant’s suppression claims moot.

1.

There is no authority for findings of fact on a “carried” motion to suppress.

Findings of fact are largely a creature of pretrial practice.  Trial court’s have

the statutory discretion to hold pretrial hearings on motions to suppress.13  If the court

chooses to hold a pretrial hearing, some unique rules come into play.  First, the ruling

10  TEX. AGRIC. CODE § 122.358(c).

11  TEX. AGRIC. CODE § 122.358(d).

12  App. Br. at 26. 

13  TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 28.01 § 1(6).

5

is interlocutory; the State may appeal if it loses.14  Second, the trial court is the finder

of fact.15  Third, the losing party is entitled to findings of fact so the appellate court

can review the reasoning actually employed by the trial court.16

But none of these unique features change what a pretrial ruling is.  “In essence,

a pretrial motion to suppress evidence is nothing more than a specialized objection

to the admissibility of that evidence.”17  In other words, it is a trial objection that takes

place pretrial under the special rules outlined above.  When a trial objection is raised

pretrial but carried with trial, the ruling is a trial ruling.  It should be treated like one. 

That should preclude findings of fact.

  

At  trial,  the  court’s  gate-keeping  role  does  not involve credibility

determinations.  This is true generally with admissibility conditioned on fact18 and

specifically  with,  for  example,  the  reliability  of  expert  opinions,19  authenticity,20

simply examines all of the evidence in the case and decides whether the jury could reasonably find

U.S. 681, 690 (1988)) (cleaned up).

outcry witnesses under Art. 38.072,21 and extraneous offenses under Art. 38.37 § 2-

a.22  The only exception appears to be rulings on confessions pursuant to Art. 38.22;

Section 6 explicitly requires a finding of admissibility “as a matter of law and fact”

without apparent regard to whether the determination is made mid-trial.23  Outside of

that narrow context, a trial court cannot make credibility determinations and therefore

cannot make findings of fact.

Notably,  this  is  true  regardless  of  whether  trial is  to  the  jury  or  the  judge. 

Granted, the reasons for prohibiting findings in a jury trial are more clear.  Article

38.04 says that once trial begins “[t]he jury, in all cases, is the exclusive judge of the

facts  proved,  and  of  the  weight  to  be  given  to  the  testimony  [subject  to  limited

weighs the credibility of the conflicting testimony as to the reasonableness of the expert’s reliance
on the given facts or data.  This distinction is critical in maintaining the separate roles of the expert
witness, the trial judge, and the jury.”).

‘sufficient’ evidence ‘to support’ authentication.  It does not ordinarily require the trial court to make

authenticity.”).

exceptions].”24  This principle also undergirds Art. 38.23(a), which gives the jury the

power to decide any admissibility issue premised on dispositive fact-finding.25  But

even  in  bench  trials,  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  recognizes  that  “the  judge

assumes dual roles: He acts as a judge in ruling on the admissibility of the evidence,

and he acts as a juror in weighing the credibility of the evidence.”26  A trial court may

have more flexibility on the timing of its admissibility rulings in a bench trial,27 but

it should not have more flexibility over the standard for admissibility itself.

Beyond these specific concerns, there is nothing about a bench trial that grants

the trial court the authority to issue findings of fact on “carried” mid-trial evidentiary

rulings.  There is no statute or rule authorizing them,28 and no analogous source of

authority;  bench  trial  findings  are  not  authorized  for  sufficiency  purposes,29  and

findings  on  motions  for  new  trial  are  authorized  by  rule  but  not  required.30 

Notwithstanding this lack of authority, trial courts issue them in both jury and bench

trials,  and  courts  of  appeals  consider  them.31    However,  none  of  these  opinions

address the problems explained above.  And the exception authorized by the Court

of Criminal Appeals—mid-trial “reopening” of the pretrial motion to suppress and

findings  of  fact  thereon32—does  not  apply  when  there  was  no pretrial  hearing  to

“reopen.”  

In short, trial courts have a choice.  They can 1) consider motions to suppress

in an interlocutory setting in which they are the finder of fact and a party can appeal

the court’s application of law to its findings, or 2) consider admissibility during a

proceeding in which their gate-keeping role is more limited.  They cannot have it both

ways.  This trial court chose the latter.  Its findings should not be entertained.

2.

The trial court was entitled to believe Officer Rocky’s claim that he smelled
raw marijuana.

If the trial court can make findings on a motion carried with a bench trial, they

are entitled to the same deference as findings issued following a pretrial motion to

suppress.  “It is well-settled that the trial court is the sole judge of the credibility of

witnesses at a hearing on a motion to suppress evidence obtained in a search/seizure,

and that it may choose to believe or disbelieve any or all of witnesses’ testimony.”33 

This includes settling conflicts within a single witness’s testimony.34  Applying these

established rules shows Findings 3 and 4 are supported by the record and entitled to

deference.

The trial court found that Officer Rocky searched appellant’s van because he

smelled raw marijuana, which he recognized from training and experience.35  The

record supports this.  Officer Rocky distinguished marijuana from hemp.36  He said

he smelled raw marijuana.37  He based his belief on training and experience.38  It does

not matter that he contradicted himself under cross-examination.39  Reconciling a

witness’s contradictory responses is the fact-finder’s job, not this Court’s.  Because

Findings 3 and 4 have evidentiary support, they must be respected.

3.

These findings effectively render appellant’s first two issues moot.

  Appellant’s  first  two  issues  are  premised  on  the  idea  that  probable  cause

cannot be based on an odor that might have been hemp.  The findings, supported by

the record, say it wasn’t.  He should lose on that basis.

C.

The possibility of an innocent explanation is largely irrelevant to probable
cause determinations.

If the trial court’s findings of fact do not preclude relief, the application of

established Fourth Amendment law should.  No innocent explanation can erase the

probable cause that arises when the odor of marijuana is detected in Texas.

1.

Cause to search must be reasonably probable, not certain.

Over  70  years  ago,  the  Supreme  Court  in  Brinegar  v.  U.S.  reaffirmed  its

definition of probable cause: 

In dealing with probable cause, however, as the very name implies, we
deal with probabilities.  These are not technical; they are the factual and
practical  considerations  of  everyday  life  on  which  reasonable  and
prudent  men,  not  legal  technicians,  act.    The  standard  of  proof  is
accordingly correlative to what must be proved.
. . .
Since [Chief Justice] Marshall’s time, at any rate, it has come to mean
more than bare suspicion: Probable cause exists where  the  facts and
circumstances within their (the officers’) knowledge and of which they
had reasonably trustworthy information (are) sufficient in themselves to
warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has
been or is being committed.40

40  338 U.S. 160, 175-76 (1949) (citation and quotation omitted).

11

This  standard  has  not  changed.    The  two  main  components  are  still  1)  a  “fair

probability” of crime or evidence thereof, 2) on which a reasonable, prudent person

would act.41  “This is a flexible, nondemanding standard.”42  And it makes sense.  As

the text of the Fourth Amendment suggests and the Supreme Court has “repeatedly

affirmed, the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness.”43  Not

beyond a reasonable doubt, or even more likely than not—reasonableness.44

2.

This standard leaves room for reasonable mistakes.

One  of  the  consequences  of  a  reasonableness  standard  is  that  it  permits

mistakes.  “To be reasonable is not to be perfect[.]”45 “[A] mistake about the facts, if

reasonable, will not vitiate an officer’s actions in hindsight so long as his actions

were lawful under the facts as he reasonably, albeit mistakenly, perceived them to

41  See, e.g., Florida v. Harris, 568 U.S. 237, 244 (2013) (“All we have required is the kind of fair
probability  on  which  reasonable  and  prudent  people,  not  legal  technicians,  act.”) (cleaned up);
Parker v. State, 206 S.W.3d 593, 599 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006) (“[P]robable cause is the accumulation
of facts which, when viewed in their totality, would lead a reasonable police officer to conclude, with
a fair probability, that a crime has been committed or is being committed by someone.”).

App. 2000).

be.”46  This allowance for reasonable mistakes can save an officer’s determination of

probable cause,47 the search of the wrong place,48 or even the arrest of the wrong

person.49  

A corollary to this is the rejection of the idea that probable cause (or reasonable

suspicion) cannot survive an innocent explanation.  “[I]nnocent behavior frequently

will provide the basis for a showing of probable cause; to require otherwise would be

to sub silentio impose a drastically more rigorous definition of probable cause than

the security of our citizens demands.”50  “In making a determination of probable cause

the relevant inquiry is not whether particular conduct is ‘innocent’ or ‘guilty,’ but the

degree  of  suspicion  that  attaches  to  particular  types  of  non-criminal  acts.”51 

Countless reasonable suspicion cases hold the same.52  Regarding probable cause,

13

both  the  Supreme  Court  and  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  acknowledge  the

consensus that innocent explanations do not vitiate probable cause.53

The upshot is that a reasonable probability of criminal activity can exist despite

1) facts that are innocent in isolation, 2) a conceivable innocent explanation for their

totality, and 3) a suspect who swears that is the case.

3.

This is a feature, not a bug.

Requiring only a probability of criminal activity practically guarantees innocent

people will be detained and even searched and/or arrested.  That is undeniable.  But

this is not an oversight, nor something courts have dismissed out of hand.  On the

contrary, this reality was confronted in Brinegar itself:

These long-prevailing [by 1949] standards seek to safeguard citizens
from  rash  and  unreasonable  interferences  with  privacy  and  from
unfounded charges of crime.  They also seek to give fair leeway for
enforcing  the  law  in  the  community’s  protection.    Because  many
situations which confront officers in the course of executing their duties
are more or less ambiguous, room must be allowed for some mistakes on

might ultimately show a defense to conduct.”).

“that officers are free to disregard either all innocent explanations, or at least innocent explanations
that  are  inherently  or  circumstantially  implausible.    These  cases  suggest  that  innocent
explanations—even  uncontradicted  ones—do  not  have  any  automatic,  probable-cause-vitiating
effect.”); State v. Ford, 537 S.W.3d 19, 26 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017) (“Although a suspect’s innocent
explanation is relevant information to be considered in a probable cause determination, numerous
courts  have  held  that  a  police  officer  is  generally  not  required  to  credit  an  accused’s  innocent
explanation when probable cause to arrest is otherwise apparent.”).

their part.  But the mistakes must be those of reasonable men, acting on
facts leading sensibly to their conclusions of probability.  The rule of
probable cause is a practical, nontechnical conception affording the best
compromise  that  has  been  found  for  accommodating  these  often
opposing  interests.    Requiring  more  would  unduly  hamper  law
enforcement.  To allow less would be to leave law-abiding citizens at the
mercy of the officers’ whim or caprice.54

The  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  adopted  similar  language  regarding  reasonable

suspicion when it abandoned the “as consistent with innocent activity as with criminal

activity” construct: 

The possibility of an innocent explanation does not deprive the officer
of the capacity to entertain a reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct. 
Indeed, the principal function of his investigation is to resolve that very
ambiguity and establish whether the activity is in fact legal or illegal to
“enable the police to quickly determine whether they should allow the
suspect to go about his business or hold him to answer charges.”  The
citizen’s undoubted interest in freedom from abuse of this procedure is
protected so far as it is within the law’s power to do so by the correlative
rule that no stop or detention is permissible when the circumstances are
not reasonably “consistent with criminal activity” and the investigation
is therefore based on mere curiosity, rumor, or hunch.55

This precedent is well-established and consistent.  Even the truth of an obviously

plausible innocent explanation cannot defeat probable cause.  It is simply not enough

to say the officer might be or even likely is wrong.

A distinctive smell identical to that of contraband constitutes probable cause.

“Legal” hemp smells just like illegal marijuana.

Appellee’s primary argument is that “legal” hemp smells the same as illegal

marijuana.  He’s right.  The odor given off by the thing he claims Officer Rocky

detected is indistinguishable from the odor of something that is a crime to possess in

any quantity in Texas.56  Marijuana is contraband.  Any reasonable, prudent person

would think an odor indistinguishable from that of contraband raises a fair probability

that the contraband is present.  The possibility of mistake is irrelevant if that mistake

is reasonable.  Nothing could be more reasonable than mistaking the distinct smell of

one thing for the smell of something that smells the same.

2.

“Legalizing” hemp did not change the Fourth Amendment or reality.

The  reasonableness  of  mistaking  raw  hemp  for  raw  marijuana  persists

regardless of whether the Legislature made hemp “legal.”  First, as explained above,

it  is  not  legal  per  se.    At  best,  possession  of  raw  hemp  is  1)  legal  outside  the

commercial  context,  2)  decriminalized  but  heavily  regulated  for  a  small  class  of

licensed commercial actors, 3) potentially criminal for commercial transporters, and

4) always criminal for anyone else transporting it.

Class B misdemeanor).

16

Second, the “as consistent with innocent activity as with criminal activity”

construct does not gain new life because the Legislature makes something “legal” in

some circumstances.  That would elevate statutorily innocent activity over inherently

innocent  activity.    Although  a  legislature  could  raise  artificial  barriers  to  the

enforcement of marijuana laws, ours made it clear that officers should continue to

pursue marijuana to the fullest extent possible.  This includes inspection of anything

that might be marijuana.  In Texas, probable cause is still probable cause.

Third,  the  chance  that  someone  whose  vehicle  smells  like  marijuana  is  or

recently  has  been  transporting  legal  hemp  between  licensed  entities  is  remote. 

Currently, the Texas Department of Agriculture lists only 91 licensed handlers and

80 licensed processors across the state.57  The probabilities favor criminal activity.  

3.

The “marijuana is different” argument warps or ignores the Fourth Amendment
(and sometimes reality).

As appellant ably sets out, there are few courts that have squarely addressed

why  odor  alone  is  not  enough  for probable  cause,  reasonable  suspicion,  or  both. 

Notably, none of them are “hemp” states.58  Instead, they are states that have medical

58  One Florida court of appeals intimated in  dicta in a “burnt” marijuana case that “the recent
legalization of hemp, and under certain circumstances marijuana, does not serve as a sea change
undoing  existing  precedent,  and  we  hold  that  regardless  of  whether  the  smell  of  marijuana  is
indistinguishable from that of hemp, the smell of marijuana emanating from a vehicle continues to
provide probable cause for a warrantless search of the vehicle.”  Owens v. State, 317 So. 3d 1218,

marijuana  acts  (MMAs),  decriminalization  of  marijuana  under  a  certain  “user”

amount, or both.  In theory, it should be easy to hold that an odor that is associated

only  with  something  that  is  still  criminal  to  possess  under  many  if  not  most

circumstances would present a “fair probability” of criminal activity to a reasonable

person.  Instead, most of these courts either disregard this standard or manipulate it

because “marijuana is different.”

a.

“Medical marijuana” cases have spawned two distinct schools of thought.  

The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania joined the “odor plus” camp in a “burnt”

case.59  Although it held that “the smell of marijuana indisputably can still signal the

possibility of criminal activity,” it concluded that smell alone cannot support probable

cause.60  It based this on its recent holding that mere possession of a handgun cannot

support  reasonable  suspicion  in  light  of  state  carry  laws.61    That  is,  possessing

something that can be legally possessed under some circumstances is not suspicious

on its own at all.

The Arizona Supreme Court went the other way in a thorough analysis of the

smell of raw marijuana coming from a storage warehouse.  Beginning with reliance

on Illinois v. Gates’s discussion of probable cause and innocent activity, it held that,

“Notwithstanding AMMA, the odor of marijuana in most circumstances will warrant

a reasonable person believing there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence

of a crime is present.”62  Simply put, “AMMA did not decriminalize the possession

or use of marijuana generally. . . . Instead, AMMA makes marijuana legal in only

limited circumstances.”63  “Given Arizona’s general prohibition against marijuana

possession and use, it is reasonable for officers to conclude that criminal activity is

occurring when they see or smell marijuana, thereby satisfying probable cause.”64  

That court explicitly rejected an “odor (or sight) plus” standard because “[the]

AMMA does not broadly alter the legal status of marijuana in Arizona but instead

specifies particular rights, immunities, and obligations for qualifying patients and

others,  such  as  designated  caregivers.”65    “Nor  does  AMMA’s  broad  immunity

provision . . . or its subsection relating to probable cause . . . suggest that AMMA

patients have greater protections from searches or increased expectations of privacy

than those enjoyed by the general public.”66  Instead, “they are simply treated like the

broader public.”67 

One Florida court of appeals agreed generally with Arizona’s approach in a

“burnt” case and held, “the possibility that a driver might be a medical-marijuana user

would not automatically defeat probable cause. The probable cause standard, after all,

is a ‘practical and common-sensical standard.’”68

b.

“Amount”  states  ignore  or  misconstrue  the  Fourth  Amendment  because
“marijuana is different.”

Opinions  from  states  that  have  decriminalized  marijuana  below  certain

thresholds show how far those courts have strayed from the Fourth Amendment.

i.

Massachusetts ignores the Fourth Amendment as a matter of policy.

Massachusetts changed the basic rules for reasonable suspicion and probable

cause  related  to  marijuana  based  on  its  perception  of  the  intent  behind

decriminalization of possession of one ounce or less.69  In 2011, the Massachusetts

favor of people lawfully using the AMMA but clarifying in subsection H that possession of a registry

cause if probable cause exists on other grounds”).

Supreme  Judicial  Court  concluded  that  the  smell  of  burnt  marijuana  is  not  even

reasonable suspicion of crime because “[f]erreting out decriminalized conduct with

the same fervor associated with the pursuit of serious criminal conduct is neither

desired by the public nor in accord with the plain language of the statute.”70  Notably,

the court refused to apply the rationale used by Pennsylvania, i.e., possession of items

that can be lawfully possessed in some circumstances is no indication of crime.71 

Instead, it said, “decriminalization is not synonymous with legalization[; b]ecause

marijuana  remains  unlawful  to  possess,  any  amount  of  marijuana  is  considered

contraband.”72  This should have helped the State.  Instead, that court viewed the

decriminalization  statute  as  a  statement  of  legislative  will.    “By  mandating  that

possession of such a small quantity of marijuana become a civil violation, not a crime,

the voters intended to treat offenders who possess one ounce or less of marijuana

differently from perpetrators of drug crimes.”73  In other words, marijuana is different. 

Three years later, it extended this rationale to the smell of raw marijuana even

when  some  marijuana  had  already  been  found.    In  that  case,  officers  said  they

smelled raw marijuana, the driver acknowledged he had some, and he consented to

opening the glove box to reveal a “fat bag” of it.74  The record does not say whether

it reasonably appeared to contain more than an ounce of marijuana.75  At some point,

a backpack containing two large freezer bags of marijuana was found in the back

seat.76  The Supreme Judicial Court held the continued investigation could not be

justified.    Despite  acknowledging  decades  old  law  that  “the  discovery  of  some

controlled  substances  gives  probable  cause  to  search  for  additional  controlled

substances,” the court said “[its] decisions since 2008 have rejected that proposition

as  to  marijuana.”77    Turning  to  the  odor,  it  conceded  that  the  odor  of  unburnt

marijuana  “could  be  more  consistent  with  the  presence  of  larger  quantities”  but

concluded odor cannot “reliably predict[] the presence of a criminal amount of the

substance . . . as would be necessary to constitute probable cause.”78 

 

Neither  opinion  from  that  court  addressed  the  low  quantum  of evidence

required by reasonable suspicion and probable cause, the fact that they are based in

they are based on an officer’s inability to smell weight.  This is policy a determination

regarding enforcement, not Fourth Amendment analysis.

ii.

Vermont ignores common sense.

Vermont  also  modifies  its  search  and  seizure  law  for  marijuana.    After

eliminating the other circumstances justifying the search incident to a traffic stop

using the divide-and-conquer and “as consistent with innocent activity” constructs,

the Vermont Supreme Court addressed the odor of raw marijuana.79  The analysis of

this  factor  started  out  well.    “Simply  because  possession  of  small  amounts  of

marijuana is not a crime does not require law enforcement to disregard the odor of

marijuana in establishing probable cause that a crime has been committed.”80  It held

this even though Vermont, like Pennsylvania, also has a medical marijuana law.81 

However, the suspect handed over a small bag of marijuana—less than one ounce—

81  Id.  Participation in Vermont’s medical program is a defense to prosecution that need not be
disproved before an officer has probable cause.  State v. Senna, 79 A.3d 45, 50 (2013)  (“The small
possibility that someone in the residence might have been immune from prosecution, in the absence
of any evidence that anyone was, does not negate the State’s probable cause to search based in part
on the odor of fresh marijuana.”).

23

before the search.82  The court held that, because there was no evidence the officers

smelled marijuana after the suspect handed them a civil amount of marijuana, there

was no more probable cause:

We  are  left  with  the  proposition  that  the  presence  of  an  amount  of
marijuana that is not a crime to possess is sufficient to establish probable
cause that defendant possessed additional marijuana in criminal amounts
or  drugs  other  than  marijuana.  We  cannot  accept  the  logic  of  this
proposition.83

The court rejected the argument—supported by officer testimony—that dealers often

carry  a  user  amount  of  marijuana  they  can  surrender  in  hopes  of  ending  the

investigation.84  “Again,” that court held, “the logic of this proposition is suspect.  [A

d]efendant would be in a better position to avoid a search of his vehicle if he had no

drugs  on  his  person  than  if  he  had  a  small  amount  of  a  drug  he  was  willing  to

acknowledge he possessed.”  This defies common sense.  

As with Massachusetts’s analysis, there was no discussion of probabilities or

innocent mistake.

iii. Maryland acknowledges the law but applies it differently to marijuana anyway.

In 2020, the Maryland Court of Appeals held that “police officers must have

probable cause to believe a person possesses a criminal amount of marijuana,” ten

grams or more, “in order to arrest that person and conduct a search incident thereto.”85 

“The odor of marijuana alone is not indicative of the quantity (if any) of marijuana

in someone’s possession[.]”86 The court was concerned about government intrusions

based on a smell that results from second-hand smoke or use in a nearby jurisdiction

where marijuana is legal.87

Last year, in a case cited by appellant, the Court of Special Appeals applied this

rationale  to  reasonable  suspicion  and  held  that  police  must  reasonably  suspect

possession of more than 10 grams of marijuana to lawfully detain someone.88  “And

because  the  odor  of  marijuana  alone  does  not  indicate  the  quantity,  if  any,  of

marijuana in someone’s possession, it cannot, by itself, provide reasonable suspicion

86  Id. at 99.

87  Id. at 99-100.  It distinguished, and left undisturbed, its prior holding that the odor of marijuana
grants  probable  cause  to  search  a  vehicle  pursuant  to  the  automobile  exception  despite
acknowledging  that  all  exceptions  to  the  warrant  requirement  “requires  the  same  quantum  of
evidence” “in terms of degree of their probability.”  Id. at 98-99, 101 (citations omitted).  The court
drew this distinction based on the differing expectations of privacy in vehicles and persons.

that  the  person  is  in  possession  of  a  criminal  amount  of  marijuana  or  otherwise

involved in criminal activity.”89  

The Maryland Court of Appeals reversed that decision in June of this year.90 

This  time,  that  court  recognized  that  neither  the  probable  cause  nor  reasonable

suspicion standard requires an officer to rule out a suspect’s innocent explanation for

suspicious facts.91  It discounted D.D.’s “correct[] observ[ations] that there are many

wholly innocent reasons why someone might smell of marijuana.”92  It called odor of

marijuana “a ‘concrete observation’ that supports further investigation.”93  “When a

police officer smells marijuana on someone, it is certainly the case that the person

may possess less than 10 grams of marijuana or they may possess no marijuana at all. 

But it also is possible that the person is presently in possession of 10 or more grams

Unfortunately, instead of applying this recognition and the body of “innocent

explanation” law it cited earlier, that court split the baby by concluding,

partial decriminalization has reduced the level of certainty associated
with the odor of marijuana on a person from probable cause that the
person has committed a crime to reasonable suspicion that the person
has committed a crime or is in the process of committing a crime. 

It follows that a brief investigatory detention based solely on the odor
of marijuana is reasonable, whereas an arrest (and a search incident to
such arrest) is unreasonable if based solely on the odor of marijuana. 
The  different  outcomes  make  sense,  given  the  differing  levels  of
intrusiveness of the two Fourth Amendment events.95 

In Maryland, then, the smell of marijuana gives reasonable suspicion to detain and

investigate, probable cause to search a vehicle, but not probable cause to search a

person.    The  last  holding  is  based  in  part  on  a  misunderstanding  of  the  role

expectation of privacy plays in the analysis but, relevant here, also on a “marijuana

is  different”  mentality.    If,  as  that  court  says,  “[t]he  partial  decriminalization  of

marijuana changed the legal landscape significantly,”96 it is because that court wanted

it to—not because the Fourth Amendment required it. 

4.

Officer Rocky had probable cause to search appellant’s van. 

Depending on how this Court views the record, Officer Rocky smelled either

marijuana—a substance that is illegal to possess—or a substance that smells just like

it.    On  that  basis  alone,  a  reasonably  prudent  person  would  have  found  a  fair

probability that appellant was committing a crime.  Officer Rocky was not required

27

to accept appellant’s innocent explanation; criminals lie to hide their crimes.  That the

explanation involved a legislatively authorized scheme for handling something that

smells like marijuana may make the explanation more facially plausible but it does

not change the fact that appellant’s vehicle smelled of contraband.  Even Maryland,

with its arbitrary limitations on searches based on the odor of marijuana, still holds

that odor alone can justify the warrantless search of a vehicle.  

Nor does the scheme include or suggest a statement of legislative policy that

could change the outcome.  Unlike the statute considered by the Massachusetts high

court, Texas’s hemp scheme explicitly reaffirms the ability of law enforcement to go

after marijuana “to the fullest extent.”97  It allows them to take samples of alleged

hemp to make sure the scheme is not being abused, and conspicuously limits the

seizure of plant material and arrest of a transporter but not searches of the vehicle. 

It also perhaps recognized the possibility that persons who transport “legal” hemp

might use it to transport marijuana or other contraband when it prohibited transporters

from  carrying  anything  that  is  not  hemp  plant  material.    Texas  wants  potential

criminal activity investigated.

   

97  Even if it did not, the existence of any regulatory scheme diminishes legitimate expectations of
privacy, especially within vehicles.  Skinner v. Ry. Labor Executives’Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 627 (1989)

E.

The discovery that appellant possessed crack cocaine on his person attenuated
any taint of illegality.

Assuming  Officer  Rocky  illegally  commenced  his  search,  the  taint  of  that

illegality was attenuated by the intervening discovery that appellant had crack on him.

The  exclusionary  rule  was  created  to  deter  police  misconduct.98    Because

society pays a substantial cost for exclusion, this remedy of “last resort” should be

reserved  for  cases  in  which  the  evidence  was  obtained  by  exploitation  of  that

misconduct.99    This  is  not  a  “but  for”  analysis.100    Even  given  a  direct  causal

connection, the taint of that misconduct can be attenuated such that the purpose of

exclusion would not be served by suppression.101  The factors to be considered are the

temporal proximity of the misconduct and discovery of the evidence, the presence of

intervening circumstances, and the purpose and flagrancy of the misconduct.102  The

latter factor is most important when there is an intervening circumstance (other than

time) because it goes to the heart of the purpose of the exclusionary rule.103

Appellant cites Massey v. State, from the Second Court, for the proposition that

“petty  and  relatively  predictable”  crimes  committed  cannot  be  intervening

circumstances.104  That court relies primarily Professor LaFave’s view that admitting

evidence derived from “‘common and predictable’” acts like “‘attempts to dispose of

incriminating evidence’” “‘would encourage such Fourth Amendment violations in

future cases.’”105  But this assumes the very exploitation a Brown analysis is supposed

to verify.  That is backwards.  And both the Supreme Court and the Court of Criminal

Appeals have rejected it.106  In short, nothing in Massey explains why a suspect’s

decision to shed contraband “is better viewed as an extended derivation of the illegal

police action” than an intervening circumstance.107

Even if this approach to some intervening offenses made sense in the abstract,

it leads to disparate and therefore absurd results.  Attenuation does not have to be

based on a new offense; probable cause is probable cause.  Relevant here, a search

of a vehicle is justified by the discovery of narcotics on the driver following his

removal.108  That discovery could result from a lawful Terry frisk or search incident

to arrest on an unrelated charge.  The result should not change when the discovery

results instead from additional criminal conduct designed to hide evidence.  Even

authorities cited by Massey generally discourage “self-help.”109  Yet this approach

tells criminals in clear terms that committing new crimes might be a good option.

In this case, the taint of any misconduct was attenuated by the discovery that

appellant possessed crack.  Once that happened, Officer Rocky had probable cause

to search his vehicle for more crack.  It does not matter that the crack was discovered

during the commission (or attempt) of a new offense.110  Importantly, Officer Rocky

did not commence the search that uncovered crack in appellant’s vehicle until after

Officer Apollo found crack “on” appellant.111  More importantly, this intervening

circumstance was not invalidated by any ill purpose or flagrancy at inception.  There

is no evidence Officer Rocky pursued his initial investigation based on anything other

than the belief he had probable  cause to search for the marijuana he believed he

smelled.  Therefore, no interest protected by the exclusionary rule would be served

by exclusion.

II.

Appellant’s claim of unlawful arrest was not preserved.

In his second issue, appellant extends his “probable cause” argument to claim

he was unlawfully arrested when he was handcuffed and placed in Officer Rocky’s

vehicle.  This complaint was not preserved at trial.

The standards for preservation of a complaint for review are not onerous.  All

a party has to do is to let the trial judge know what he wants and why he thinks

110  Appellant does not challenge the element of intent; as discussed infra, he is at least guilty of
attempted tampering with evidence.

himself entitled to it at a time when the trial court can do something about it.112  The

Court of Criminal Appeals has “extended this concept even so far as to hold that a

party need not state his objection with specificity in order to preserve error so long

as the record otherwise makes it clear that both the trial court and the opposing party

understood the legal basis.”113  Nothing like that happened in this case.

Appellant filed a boilerplate motion to suppress that covered every abstract

claim that could be raised.114  Much of it was inapplicable to his case.  Arguments in

motions to suppress that are “global in nature and contain[] little more than citations

to constitutional and statutory provisions” are “not sufficiently specific to preserve”

substantive  arguments  for  review.115    Appellant  also  made  a  generic “fruit  of  the

poisonous tree” objection at the outset of the bench trial.116  The State made it clear

that it did not understand appellant’s complaint(s) when it asked that the basis for the

motion be specified.117  That clarification took place off the record and outside the

112  Lankston v. State, 827 S.W.2d 907, 909 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992).

113  Thomas v. State, 408 S.W.3d 877, 884 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013).

presence (or at least hearing) of the trial court.118  The trial court specifically told both

parties to make their arguments to it after the close of evidence.119  At that time,

appellant attacked the search but not his seizure.120  The State’s arguments did not

address it.  And neither the trial court’s unadorned denial of the motion121 nor its

findings show consideration of the issue.

There is no evidence this claim was presented to the trial court or ruled upon. 

It is not properly presented on appeal.

III. Appellant is guilty of tampering with evidence because he put it where it could

not be readily found by investigating officers.

In his third issue, appellant argues his conviction for tampering with physical

evidence by concealment should result in acquittal because his actions exposed rather

than  concealed  the  crack.   A  plain  understanding  of  the  term “conceal” includes

hiding it from an officer’s view.  That is what happened in this case.  Alternatively,

appellant is at least guilty of attempted tampering.

the prosecutor.”).

121  1 RR 39.

A.

“Conceal” includes placement outside another’s point of view.   

In cases like this, “legal sufficiency turns upon the meaning of the statute under

which the defendant is being prosecuted.”122  Statutory interpretation is a question of

law that reviewed de novo.123  When the term, as in this case, is undefined, juries (and

trial courts) are permitted to define them according to common usage.124  

Common usage allows for an object to be concealed without being enclosed or

covered but simply removed from a person’s line of sight.  As Presiding Judge Keller

said in her concurrence to Thornton v. State, “Whatever else ‘conceal’ might mean

in the context of the tampering with evidence statute, it at least means to remove from

sight.  And removal from a person’s sight occurs, at least, when a person’s line of

sight  to  the  object  in  question  is  blocked.”125    For  example,  ordinary  people

would—or at least could—agree that cookies can be hidden on top of a refrigerator,

a refrigerator can be hidden behind a van, and a van can be hidden behind a barn. 

These  items  aren’t  any  less  concealed  because  they  can  be  seen  once  you  place

yourself in a better position to find them.  And if the items were placed there to make

them unavailable as evidence in an investigation, that should be a crime.

B.

The Court of Criminal Appeals has not held differently.

In  fairness,  there  are  cases  supporting  appellant’s  view  of  “conceal.”    In

Thornton v. State, the Seventh Court held a crack pipe was not concealed in part

because it never left the sight of the officer who watched the suspect discard it.126 

More on point, that court held in Meals v. State that a suspect detained in the backseat

of a police vehicle who removed crack from his sock to hide it under the front seat

was not guilty of concealing.127  It held, as appellant argues, that Meals “actually

exposed  it  to  the  view  of  the  deputies[;  b]oth  deputies  testified  that  some  of  the

cocaine was readily visible and all of the cocaine was visible—if they just looked.”128

But the Court of Criminal Appeals has not gone that far.  In Stahmann v. State,

that  court  was  confronted  with  what  the  State  argues  in  this  case.129    It  neither

accepted nor rejected it because of the unique facts of that case.  Upon arrival at the

scene of a car accident, bystanders immediately directed officers to a pill bottle they

watched Stahmann throw over the a nearby fence  where it landed “plain as day.”130 

126    377  S.W.3d  814,  818  (Tex.  App.—Amarillo  2012),  reformed  to  attempted  tampering,  425
S.W.3d 289 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014).

127  601 S.W.3d 390 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2020, pet. ref’d).

128  Id. at 397.

130  Id. at 575-76.

129  602 S.W.3d 573, 580 (Tex. Crim. App. 2020) (“The State argues that ‘conceal’ means to remove
from sight or notice, even if only temporarily[.]”)

36

Like the officer in Thornton, the bystanders never lost sight of it.131  As a result, law

enforcement was never not aware of it.  These circumstances were important to the

The outcome of this case might be different had [the bystanders] not
been  there,  had  they  lost  sight  of  what  Stahmann  threw  or  where  it
landed, had they not spoken to [the officer] and directed him to the pill
bottle when he arrived, or had [the officer] had a difficult time locating
it.  But those are not the facts of this case.132

In context, that court’s agreement with the court of appeals “that actual concealment

requires a showing that the allegedly concealed item was hidden, removed from sight

or notice, or kept from discovery or observation” lacks the weight appellant says it

holding: 

does.133 

C.

Appellant placed his crack where it could not easily be seen.

Applying this common understanding of the term “conceal” shows appellant

concealed his crack from both officers.

When Officer Rocky ceased his initial search to see what appellant was doing,

he was able to see that appellant’s right shoe and sock were off but could not see any

131  Id. at 576.  

132  Id. at 580.

133  App. Br. at 47.

37

crack.134  Had Officer Apollo not pointed it out, it is unclear when he might have seen

it.  It was, in acceptable common use, concealed from him.

A better example is Officer Apollo.  Although he discovered the crack, it was

only after he “kept kind of looking around to figure out what [appellant] might have

been doing.”135  Officer  Apollo’s inability to see it immediately was not because

appellant was covering it with his foot or shoe.136  It was because appellant had placed

it under the front seat where Officer Apollo could not be seen without changing his

vantage point.137

Vantage point is everything.  As State’s Exhibit 4 shows, it is easy to say the

crack was plainly exposed if one gets down low enough and close enough to where

it can be seen under the front seat.  The crack can also be readily seen in State’s

Exhibit 3 (if one is looking for it) because the photo was taken so that it could be

seen.  But holding that anything that is visible from some vantage point cannot be

concealed for the purposes of the tampering statute would ignore that word’s common

meaning.

134  1 RR 15, 17-18.

135  1 RR 29.

136  1 RR 30.

137  1 RR 30, 33.

38

It would also result in absurdity.  If concealment regardless of viewpoint is the

standard, that would mean that parking a stolen bus in front of your house with a tarp

over it would be a crime but parking it uncovered in the middle of your 100-acre field

would not be.  The tampering statute cannot be that easily defeated by a theoretical-

visibility rule.  

If invisibility from any angle is not required, this Court has two choices.  It can

create  an  amorphous  test  based  perhaps  on  how  much  time  and/or  effort  was

expended finding the item.  Or it can accept that hiding something from anyone’s

view  for some  amount  of  time  is concealment.    The  latter  option  best  serves  the

ordinary meaning of the term and the purpose of the statute.

D.

Reformation to attempt is the proper alternative to affirmation.

Finally, if this Court finds the evidence of concealment insufficient, it should

reform  the  conviction  to  one  of  attempted  tampering.    Reformation  to  a  lesser-

included offense is appropriate when the fact-finder necessarily found the elements

of that lesser and there is sufficient evidence to support it.138  That was the outcome

in Thornton and Meals, and it applies here.  

A person is guilty of attempt “if, with specific intent to commit an offense, he

does an act amounting to more than mere preparation that tends but fails to effect the

138  Thornton, 425 S.W.3d at 300.

39

commission of the offense intended.”139  Attempt is always a lesser-included offense

of the offense of conviction.140  Tampering, as charged, required proof appellant knew

an  investigation  was  in  progress  and  concealed  a  thing  with  intent  to  impair  its

availability as evidence in the investigation.141  A rational fact-finder could conclude

that appellant knew there was an investigation and dispossessed himself of his crack

with the specific intent to hide it under the front seat.  Reformation is warranted.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE,  the  State  of  Texas  prays  that  this  Court  affirm  appellant’s

convictions for tampering with evidence and possession of a controlled substance.
