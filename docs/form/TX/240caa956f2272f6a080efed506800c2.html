Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 
 
Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 
 

APPEAL NO.: 

08-004 

ESPONDENT: 

John McMaster, Judge, Williamson County Court at Law No. 4 

ATE: 

 

October 27, 2008 

 

 

 

PECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge David Peeples, Chairman; Judge John Ovard; Judge Olen 
Underwood; Judge Stephen B. Ables; Judge Dean Rucker 

etitioner requested personnel files of the official court reporter for a county court at law from the 
judge  of  the  court.    The  judge  responded  that  he  did  not  have  her  personnel  files,  but  that  the 
requester might be able to obtain them from the county’s human resources officer.  The judge said 
that he may have some communications that are responsive to the request, but because they are 
exempt under Rule 12 he cannot provide them.  He also provided the proper notice of her right to 
appeal under Rule 12.   

including 

reporter’s 

the  court 

etitioner then sent a second, more specific request to the judge, requesting specific categories of 
documents, 
job  applications,  performance  evaluations, 
communications with a certain party, records documenting any complaints about her, and records 
stating the reasons for her separation from employment.  The judge responded that he did not have 
any job applications, performance evaluations, or communications between the court reporter and the 
named party.  He noted that Petitioner might want to address the request for the communications 
between the two named individuals to those individuals or to the county information technology 
department.  He further stated that “there may be a memo or document regarding complaints about 
[the court reporter] or her separation from employment,” but that none of the documents could be 
redacted.    He  again  provided  the  information  about  appealing  under  Rule  12,  and  Petitioner 
appealed. 

espondent argues that the appeal is untimely, because petitioner should have appealed within 30 
days of his denial of the first request for the personnel file.  Because the second request was more 
specific than the first, we find that it was not a duplication of the first request, and that the appeal 
was timely. 

e first address the documents withheld by Respondent under a claimed exemption and provided to 
us in camera.   He argues that they are exempt under the provisions of Rule 12.5(c), 12.5(i), or 
12.5(k).  One is an “employee memo” to all of the employees of the county court at law, stating the 
workday policies of the court and signed by the judge and the three employees, including the court 
reporter.  Because we find the other document to be exempt, we will not describe it in this opinion.

Respondent  contends  the  documents  constitute  “any  personnel  record  that,  if  disclosed,  would 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”  Rule 12.5(c).  Although we are not 
bound  by  interpretations  of  the  Public  Information  Act  (“PIA”)  by  the  Office  of  the  Attorney 
General, we are guided by them, and the language of the personnel records exemptions of Rule 
12.5(c) and the PIA is similar.   Information about public employees’ job performance or the reasons 
for their dismissal, demotion, promotion, or resignation is not exempt from disclosure under the 
personnel file exception of the PIA.  OAG Open Records Decision Nos. 444 at 5-6 (1986), 405 at 2-3 
(1983).  We find that neither the employee memo documenting workday policies for a court nor the 
other  document  at  issue  in  this  matter  constitute  information  that  would  constitute  a  clearly 
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, so they are not exempt under Rule 12.5(c).   

espondent contends the documents constitute information that is confidential under other law, but 
he cites no state or federal constitutional provision, statute or common law principle that would 
render the documents confidential, and we are not aware of any.  We find that they are not exempt 
under Rule 12.5(i).   

espondent  contends  the  documents  constitute  “any  record  relating  to  an  investigation  of  any 
person’s character or conduct.”  There is no indication that the employee policy memo relates to an 
investigation, so we assume the exemption is claimed only for the other document.  We find that it 
relates to an investigation of a person’s character or conduct and that it is exempt under Rule 12.5(k). 
  
As no exemption was established for the employee policy memo, we grant the petition for access to 
it.  We deny the petition for access to the other document. 

e next address the issue of the judge’s responses to the requests for the court reporter’s personnel 
files and for communications (including emails) between the court reporter and other individuals.   
The judge stated that he was not the custodian of those records, and told the Petitioner to contact the 
human resources department and the information technology department, respectively.  The judge is 
the custodian of the judicial records of his court, and the court reporter in question was appointed by 
him as the official reporter of that court.  If the personnel files and the emails of the court reporter are 
records of the court to which she was appointed, then the judge is the custodian of those records, 
even if he has to ask for help from other county employees to access them.  If the judge is not the 
custodian, but other county employees are the custodians, then Rule 12.6(f) requires the judge to 
refer the requests to the other custodians and to notify the requester in writing that he has referred 
them to the proper custodians.  The rule does not permit the judge to merely identify the custodians 
and require the requester to contact those custodians.  In making the determination as to whether he 
is the custodian, the judge should consider whether he wants to determine which of the records are 
public and which are exempt, or whether he wants county employees not under his supervision and 
with little knowledge of his court’s operations to make those determinations.  Although the judge’s 
responses did not comply with Rule 12.6(f), we are confident that the judge will reconsider and 
revise his response in light of this opinion.
