the sheriff or constable is an officer. 
 
Exception:  Statement  of  Inability  to  Afford  Payment  of  Court  Costs  Filed.  If  a 
Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs has been filed in a case in

Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs has been filed. The sheriff or constable 
must execute the service without demanding payment.

ule 145. Payment of Costs Not Required 

a)  General Rule. A party who files a Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court 
Costs cannot be required to pay costs except by order of the court as provided by 
this rule. After the Statement is filed, the clerk must docket the case, issue citation, 
and provide any other service that is ordinarily provided to a party. The Statement 
must either be sworn to before a notary or made under penalty of perjury. In this 
rule, “declarant” means the party filing the Statement. 

Supreme Court Form; Clerk to Provide. The declarant must use the form Statement 
approved  by  the  Supreme  Court,  or  the  Statement  must  include  the  information 
required by the Court-approved form. The clerk must make the form available to all 
persons without charge or request. 

Costs Defined. “Costs” mean any fee charged by the court or an officer of the court 
that could be taxed in a bill of costs, including, but not limited to, filing fees, fees 
for issuance and service of process, fees for a court-appointed professional, and fees 
charged by the clerk or court reporter for preparation of the appellate record. 

d)  Defects. The clerk may refuse to file a Statement that is not sworn to before a notary 
or made under penalty of perjury.  No other defect is a ground for refusing to file a 
Statement or requiring the party to pay costs. If a defect or omission in a Statement 
is material, the court—on its own motion or on motion of the clerk or any party—
may direct the declarant to correct or clarify the Statement. 

Evidence  of  Inability  to  Afford  Costs  Required.  The  Statement  must  say  that  the 
declarant cannot afford to pay costs. The declarant must provide in the Statement, 
and,  if  available,  in  attachments  to  the  Statement,  evidence  of  the  declarant’s 
inability to afford costs, such as evidence that the declarant: 

(1) 

(2) 

receives  benefits  from  a  government  entitlement  program,  eligibility  for 
which is dependent on the recipient’s means; 

is being represented in the case by an attorney who is providing free legal 
services to the declarant, without contingency, through: 

(A) 

a provider funded by the Texas Access to Justice Foundation; 

(B) 

a provider funded by the Legal Services Corporation; or

(C) 

a  nonprofit  that  provides  civil  legal  services  to  persons  living  at  or 
below 200% of the federal poverty guidelines published annually by 
the United States Department of Health and Human Services; 

(3) 

has applied for free legal services for the case through a provider listed in 
(e)(2)  and  was  determined  to  be  financially  eligible  but  was  declined 
representation; or 

(4) 

does not have funds to afford payment of costs. 

f) 

Requirement  to  Pay  Costs  Notwithstanding  Statement.  The  court  may  order  the 
declarant to pay costs only as follows: 

(1)  On  Motion  by  the  Clerk  or  a  Party.  The  clerk  or  any  party  may  move  to 
require the declarant to pay costs only if the motion contains sworn evidence, 
not merely on information or belief: 

(A) 

that the Statement was materially false when it was made; or 

(B) 

that because of changed circumstances, the Statement is no longer true 
in material respects. 

(2)  On  Motion  by  the  Attorney  Ad  Litem  for  a  Parent  in  Certain  Cases.  An 
attorney  ad  litem  appointed  to  represent  a  parent  under  Section  107.013, 
Family Code, may move to require the parent to pay costs only if the motion 
complies with (f)(1).  

3)  On  Motion  by  the  Court  Reporter.  When  the  declarant  requests  the 
preparation of a reporter’s record but cannot make arrangements to pay for 
it, the court reporter may move to require the declarant to prove the inability 
to afford costs. 

  (

(4)  On the Court’s Own Motion. Whenever evidence comes before the court that 
the declarant may be able to afford costs, or when an officer or professional 
must be appointed in the case, the court may require the declarant to prove 
the inability to afford costs. 

(5) 

Notice and Hearing. The declarant may not be required to pay costs without 
an oral evidentiary hearing. The declarant must be given 10 days’ notice of 
the hearing. Notice must either be in writing and served in accordance with 
Rule 21a or given in open court. At the hearing, the burden is on the declarant 
to prove the inability to afford costs.

Findings  Required.  An  order  requiring  the  declarant  to  pay  costs  must  be 
supported by detailed findings that the declarant can afford to pay costs. 

Partial and Delayed Payment. The court may order that the declarant pay the 
part  of  the  costs  the  declarant  can  afford  or  that  payment  be  made  in 
installments.  But  the  court  must  not  delay  the  case  if  payment  is  made  in 
installments. 

g) 

Review of Trial Court Order.  

(1)  Only Declarant May Challenge; Motion. Only the declarant may challenge 
an order issued by the trial court under this rule. The declarant may challenge 
the  order  by  motion filed  in  the  court  of  appeals  with  jurisdiction over  an 
appeal from the judgment in the case. The declarant is not required to pay 
any filing fees related to the motion in the court of appeals.  
 
Time for Filing; Extension. The motion must be filed within 10 days after the 
trial court’s order is signed. The court of appeals may extend the deadline by 
15 days if the declarant demonstrates good cause for the extension in writing. 

(2) 

Record.  After  a  motion  is  filed,  the  court  of  appeals  must  promptly  send 
notice to the trial court clerk and the court reporter requesting preparation of 
the record of all trial court proceedings on the declarant’s claim of indigence. 
The  court  may  set  a  deadline  for  filing  the  record.  The  record  must  be 
provided without charge. 

4)  Court of Appeals to Rule Promptly. The court of appeals must rule on the 

motion at the earliest practicable time. 

Judgment. The judgment must not require the declarant to pay costs, and a provision 
in  the  judgment  purporting  to  do  so  is  void,  unless  the  court  has  issued  an  order 
under (f), or the declarant has obtained a monetary recovery, and the court orders 
the recovery to be applied toward payment of costs. 

omment to 2016 Change: The rule has been rewritten. Access to the civil justice system 
cannot be denied because a person cannot afford to pay court costs. Whether a particular 
fee  is  a  court  cost  is  governed  by  this  rule,  Civil  Practice  and  Remedies  Code  Section 
31.007, and case law.  

he issue is not merely whether a person can pay costs, but whether the person can afford 
to pay costs. A person may have sufficient cash on hand to pay filing fees, but the person

cannot  afford  the  fees  if  paying  them  would  preclude  the  person  from  paying  for  basic 
essentials,  like  housing  or  food.  Experience  indicates  that  almost  all  filers  described  in 
(e)(1)-(3), and most filers described in (e)(4), cannot in fact afford to pay costs.  

ecause costs to access the system—filing fees, fees for issuance of process and notices, 
and  fees  for  service  and  return—are  kept  relatively  small,  the  expense  involved  in 
challenging a claim of inability to afford costs often exceeds the costs themselves. Thus, 
the rule does not allow the clerk or a party to challenge a litigant’s claim of inability to 
afford costs without sworn evidence that the claim is false. The filing of a Statement of 
Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs—which may either be sworn to before a notary 
or  made  under  penalty  of  perjury,  as  permitted  by  Civil  Practice  and  Remedies  Code 
Section  132.001—is  all  that  is  needed  to  require  the  clerk  to  provide  ordinary  services 
without payment of fees and costs. But evidence may come to light that the claim was false 
when made. And the declarant’s circumstances may change, so that the claim is no longer 
true. Importantly, costs may increase with the appointment of officers or professionals in 
the case, or when a reporter’s record must be prepared. The reporter is always allowed to 
challenge a claim of inability to afford costs before incurring the substantial expense of 
record  preparation.  The  trial  court  always  retains  discretion  to  require  evidence  of  an 
inability to afford costs.

Service Fees. A plaintiff must pay all fees for service unless the plaintiff has filed a

ule 502.3.  Fees; Inability to Afford Fees 

Fees  and  Statement  of  Inability  to  Afford  Payment  of  Court  Costs.  On  filing  the 
petition, the plaintiff must pay  the appropriate filing fee and  service fees, if any, 
with  the  court.  A  plaintiff  who  is  unable  to  afford  to  pay  the  fees  must  file  a 
Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs. The Statement must either 
be  sworn  to  before  a  notary  or  made  under  penalty  of  perjury.  Upon  filing  the 
Statement, the clerk must docket the action, issue citation, and provide any other 
customary services.   

Supreme  Court  Form;  Contents  of  Statement.  The  plaintiff  must  use  the  form 
Statement  approved  by  the  Supreme  Court,  or  the  Statement  must  include  the 
information required by the Court-approved form. The clerk must make the form 
available to all persons without charge or request.  

Certificate of Legal-Aid Provider. If the party is represented by an attorney who is 
providing free legal services because of the party’s indigence, without contingency, 
and the attorney is providing services either directly or by referral from a legal-aid 
provider described in Rule 145(e)(2), the attorney may file a certificate confirming 
that  the  provider  screened  the  party  for  eligibility  under  the  income  and  asset 
guidelines  established  by  the  provider.  A  Statement  that  is  accompanied  by  the 
certificate of a legal-aid provider may not be contested under (d). 

Contest.  Unless a certificate is filed under (c), the defendant may file a contest of 
the Statement at any time within 7 days after the day the defendant’s answer is due.  
If the Statement attests to receipt of government entitlement based on indigence, the 
Statement may only be contested with regard to the veracity of the attestation. If 
contested, the judge must hold a hearing to determine the plaintiff=s ability to afford 
the fees. At the hearing, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the inability to afford 
fees. The judge may, regardless of whether the defendant contests the  Statement, 
examine the Statement and conduct a hearing to determine the plaintiff’s ability to 
afford fees. If the judge determines that the plaintiff is able to afford the fees, the 
judge must enter a written order listing the reasons for the determination, and the 
plaintiff  must  pay  the  fees  in  the  time  specified  in  the  order  or  the  case  will  be 
dismissed without prejudice.

ule 502.4.  Venue—Where a Lawsuit May Be Brought 

d)  Motion to Transfer Venue. If a plaintiff files suit in an improper venue, a defendant 
may challenge the venue selected by filing a motion to transfer venue. The motion 
must be filed before trial, no later than 21 days after the day the defendant=s answer 
is filed, and must contain a sworn statement that the venue chosen by the plaintiff is 
improper and a specific county  and precinct of proper venue to which transfer is 
sought. If the defendant fails to name a county and precinct, the court must instruct 
the  defendant  to  do  so  and  allow  the  defendant  7  days  to  cure  the  defect.  If  the 
defendant fails to correct the defect, the motion will be denied, and the case will 
proceed in the county and precinct where it was originally filed.    

 

Procedure. 

(1) 
 

(G)  Order.  An  order  granting  a  motion  to  transfer  venue  must  state  the 
reason for the transfer and the name of the court to which the transfer 
is made. When such an order of transfer is made, the judge who issued 
the order must immediately make out a true and correct transcript of 
all the entries made on the docket in the case, certify the transcript, 
and send the transcript, with a certified copy of the bill of costs and 
the original papers in the case, to the court in the precinct to which the 
case  has  been  transferred.  The  court  receiving  the  case  must  then 
notify the plaintiff that the case has been received and, if the case is 
transferred to a  different county, that the plaintiff has 14 days after 
receiving the  notice to  pay  the  filing fee  in  the  new  court, or  file  a 
sworn  sStatement  of  iInability  to  Afford  pPayment  of  Court  Costs. 
The  plaintiff  is  not  entitled  to  a  refund  of  any  fees  already  paid.  
Failure to pay the fee or file a sworn sStatement of inability to pay 
will result in dismissal of the case without prejudice.

ule 502.6.  Counterclaim; Cross-Claim; Third Party Claim 

a)   Counterclaim. A defendant may file a petition stating as a counterclaim any claim 
against a plaintiff that is within the jurisdiction of the justice court, whether or not 
related  to  the  claims  in  the  plaintiff=s  petition.  The  defendant  must  file  a 
counterclaim petition as provided in Rule 502.2, and must pay a filing fee or provide

b)   Cross-Claim.  A  plaintiff  seeking  relief  against  another  plaintiff,  or  a  defendant 
seeking  relief  against  another  defendant  may  file  a  cross-claim.  The  filing  party 
must file a cross-claim petition as provided in Rule 502.2, and must pay a filing fee

(A)  Notice. If a defendant appeals an eviction for nonpayment of rent by 
filing a sworn sStatement of Iinability to Afford pPayment of Court 
Costs, the justice court must provide to the defendant a written notice 
at  the  time  the  Sstatement  is  filed  that  contains  the  following 
information in bold or conspicuous type: 

 

 

 

(i) 

the  amount  of  the  initial  deposit  of  rent,  equal  to  one  rental 
period=s rent under the terms of the rental agreement, that the 
defendant must pay into the justice court registry; 

(ii)  whether  the  initial  deposit  must  be  paid  in  cash,  cashier=s 
check,  or  money  order,  and  to  whom  the  cashier=s  check  or 
money order, if applicable, must be made payable; 

(iii) 

(iv) 

the calendar date by which the initial deposit must be paid into 
the justice court registry, which must be within 5 days of the 
date the sworn sStatement of inability to pay is filed; and 

a  statement  that  failure  to  pay  the  required  amount  into  the 
justice  court  registry  by  the  required  date  may  result  in  the 
court issuing a writ of possession without hearing. 

(B)  Defendant May Remain in Possession. A defendant who appeals an 
eviction  for  nonpayment  of  rent  by  filing  a  sworn  sStatement  of 
Iinability  to  Afford  pPayment  of  Court  Costs  is  entitled  to  stay  in 
possession  of  the  premises  during  the  pendency  of  the  appeal  by 
complying with the following procedure: 

(i)  Within  5  days  of  the  date  that  the  defendant  files  a  sworn 
sStatement of Iinability to Afford pPayment of Court Costs, it 
must pay into the justice court registry the amount set forth in 
the  notice  provided  at  the  time  the  defendant  filed  the 
Sstatement.  If the defendant was provided with notice and fails 
to  pay  the  designated  amount  into  the  justice  court  registry 
within 5 days, and the transcript has not been transmitted to the 
county clerk, the plaintiff is entitled, upon request and payment 
of the applicable fee, to a writ of possession, which the justice 
court must issue immediately and without hearing. 

ii)  During the appeal process as rent becomes due under the rental 
agreement, the defendant must pay the designated amount into 

  (

Page 19 

 

(iii) 

 

the county court registry within 5 days of the rental due date 
under the terms of the rental agreement.   

If a government agency is responsible for all or a portion of the 
rent,  the  defendant  must  pay  only  that  portion  of  the  rent 
determined by the justice court to be paid during appeal.  Either 
party may contest the portion of the rent that the justice court 
determines must be paid into the county court registry by filing 
a contest within 5 days after the judgment is signed. If a contest 
is  filed,  the  justice  court  must  notify  the  parties  and  hold  a 
hearing on the contest within 5 days. If the defendant objects 
to  the  justice  court’s  ruling  at  the  hearing,  the  defendant  is 
required  to  pay  only  the  portion  claimed  to  be  owed  by  the 
defendant until the issue is tried in county court.  

If  the  defendant  fails  to  pay  the  designated  amount  into  the 
court registry within the time limits prescribed by these rules, 
the plaintiff may file a sworn motion that the defendant is in 
default in county court.  The plaintiff must notify the defendant 
of the motion and the hearing date. Upon a showing that the 
defendant  is  in  default,  the  court  must  issue  a  writ  of 
possession. 

The plaintiff may withdraw any or all rent in the county court 
registry  upon  sworn  motion  and  hearing,  prior  to  final 
determination of the case, showing just cause; dismissal of the 
appeal; or order of the court after final hearing.(vi) 
hearings  and  motions  under this subparagraph are entitled to 
precedence in the county court.

Fees charged for preparation of the appellate record are governed by Texas Rule of

(b)  When a Statement Was Filed in the Trial Court. 

1)  General Rule; Status in Trial Court Carries Forward. A party who filed a 
Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs in the trial court is 
not required to pay costs in the appellate court unless the trial court overruled 
the party’s claim of indigence in an order that complies with Texas Rule of 
Civil Procedure 145. A party is not required to pay costs in the appellate court 
if  the  trial  court  ordered  the  party  to  pay  partial  costs  or  to  pay  costs  in 
installments.

Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 20.1—Clean Version of Final Amended Rule 

 

Establishing the Right to Proceed Under the General Rule. To establish the 
right  to  proceed  without  payment  of  costs  under  (1),  a  party  must 
communicate to the appellate court clerk in writing that the party is presumed 
indigent under this rule. In an appeal under Section Two of these rules, the 
applicability of the presumption should be stated in the notice of appeal and 
in the docketing statement.  

Exception;  Material  Change  in  Circumstances.  An  appellate  court  may 
permit a party who is not entitled to proceed under (1) to proceed without 
payment  of  costs  if  the  party  establishes  that  the  party’s  financial 
circumstances  have  materially  changed  since  the  date  of  the  trial  court’s 
order under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 145. 

(A)  Requirements.  The  party  must  file  a  motion  in  the  appellate  court 
alleging  that  the  party’s  financial  circumstances  have  materially 
changed  since  the  date  of  the  trial  court’s  order  and  a  current 
Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs that complies 
with Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 145. The Statement that was filed 
in the trial court does not meet the requirements of this rule. 

B)  Action by Appellate Court. The appellate court may decide the motion 
based  on  the  record  or  refer  the  motion  to  the  trial  court  with 
instructions to hear evidence and issue findings of fact. If a motion is 
referred  to  the  trial  court,  the  appellate  court  must  review  the  trial 

  (

Page 21 

 

 

 

court’s  findings  and  the  record  of  the  hearing  before  ruling  on  the 
motion. 

(c)  When No Statement Was Filed in the Trial Court. An appellate court may permit a 
party who did not file a Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs in 
the trial court to proceed without payment of costs. The court may require the party 
to file a Statement in the appellate court. If the court denies the party’s request to 
proceed without payment of costs, it must do so in a written order. 

omment to 2016 Change:  

he rule has been rewritten so that it only governs filing fees and any other fee charged by 
the  appellate  court.  Texas  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  145  governs  a  party’s  claim  that  the 
party is unable to afford costs for preparation of the appellate record. 

Because  appellate  filing  fees  are  minimal,  a  party  that  filed  a  Statement  of  Inability  to 
Afford Payment of Court Costs in the trial court is not required to file a new Statement in 
the appellate court  unless the trial court  made affirmative findings under Texas Rule  of 
Civil Procedure 145 that the party is able to afford all court costs and to pay those costs as 
they  are  incurred.  Furthermore,  because  a  determination  of  indigence  by  the  trial  court 
carries forward to appeal in all cases, Family Code section 107.013 is satisfied. 

xperience has shown that, in most cases, a party’s financial circumstances do not change 
substantially  between  the  trial  court  proceedings  and  the  appellate  court  proceedings. 
Nonetheless, (b)(3) permits a party whom the trial court determined is able to afford all 
costs  to  demonstrate  to  the  appellate  court  that  the  party’s  circumstances  have  changed 
since the trial court’s ruling and that the party is unable to afford appellate filing fees.

he court of appeals’ judgment should award to the prevailing party costs incurred by that

was entitled to proceed without payment of costs under Rule 20.1, and a provision in the 
judgment purporting to do so is void.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
