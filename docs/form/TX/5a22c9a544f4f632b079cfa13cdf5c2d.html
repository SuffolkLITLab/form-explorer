3.  I  have  read  and  understand  the  purpose  of  the  application  to  which  my  declaration  is 

attached and adopt by reference the statements made in it.  I am the authorized agent or 

representative of Petitioner with respect to Obligor’s account, and in that capacity, I am 

authorized to make this declaration on Petitioner’s behalf. My testimony is based on my 

experience,  my  knowledge  of  the  usual  business  practices  of  __________  [declarant’s 

employer] and the servicing industry in general, my job responsibilities, and the servicing 

records for Obligor’s account. 

4.  Through my job responsibilities, I have access to and have reviewed the servicing records 

and data for Obligor’s account, including electronic and computer generated records and 

data  compilations.  The  records  attached  to  the  application  are  the  original  records  or 

exact duplicates of the original records kept in the servicing file for Obligor’s account. 

5.  Based  on  the  regular  practices  of  _______  [declarant’s  employer]  and  the  servicing 

industry in general, these records: 

a.  were made at or near the time of each act, event, or condition set forth in the records; 

b.   were made by, or from information transmitted by, a person engaged in the servicing 

of  Obligor’s  account  who  had  actual  knowledge  of  the  acts,  events,  or  conditions 

recorded; and 

agreements. 

c.   are  the  kind  of  records  that  are  kept  in  the  regular  course  of  servicing  loan 

6.   It  is  the  regular  practice  of  businesses  engaged  in  the  servicing  of  loan  agreements  or 

other contracts requiring the collection of money to keep accurate records on debits and 

credits  to  an  account,  an  account’s  balance,  the  collateral  securing  the  right  to  the 

lienholder’s right to repayment, and efforts to enforce the underlying debt if the Obligor 

has defaulted. These records are relied upon for accuracy by all persons engaged in the 

servicing and enforcement of a loan agreement. There is no indication that the servicing 

records for Obligor’s account are untrustworthy.
