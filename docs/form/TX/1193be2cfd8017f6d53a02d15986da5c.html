Rule XIX

isc. Docket No. 14-9185  

Page 26

The  motion  of  the  non‐resident  attorney  seeking  permission  to  participate  in  Texas 
proceedings  shall  must  be  accompanied  by  motion  of  the  resident  practicing  Texas 
attorney with whom the non‐resident attorney shall will be associated in the proceeding 
of a particular cause,. The which motion shall must contain a statement that the resident 
attorney  finds  the  Applicant  to  be  a  reputable  attorney  and  recommends  that  the 
Applicant  be  granted  permission  to  participate  in  the  particular  proceeding  before  the 
court. 

The motion of the non‐resident attorney shall must also be accompanied by the proof of 
payment or proof of indigency acknowledgment issued by the Board of Law Examiners. 

The  court  may  examine  the  non‐resident  attorney  to  determine  that  the  non‐resident 
attorney is aware of and will observe the ethical standards required of attorneys licensed 
in  Texas  and  to  determine  whether  the  non‐resident  attorney  is  appearing  in  courts  in 
Texas on a frequent basis. If the court determines that the non‐resident attorney is not a 
reputable  attorney  who  will  observe  the  ethical  standards  required  of  Texas  attorneys, 
that the non‐resident attorney has been appearing in courts in Texas on a frequent basis, 
that  the  non‐resident  attorney  has  been  engaging  in  the  unauthorized  practice  of  law  in 
the state of Texas, or that other good cause exists, the court or hearing officer may deny 
the motion. 

If, after being granted permission to participate in the proceedings of any particular cause 
in  Texas,  the  non‐resident  attorney  engages  in  professional  misconduct  as  that  term  is 
defined  by  the  State  Bar  Act,  the  State  Bar  Rules,  or  the  Texas  Disciplinary  Rules  of 
Professional Conduct, the court may revoke such the non‐resident attorney’s permission 
to  participate  in  the  Texas  proceedings  and  may  cite  the  non‐resident  attorney  as  for 
contempt. In addition, the court may refer the matter to the Grievance Committee of the 
Bar District wherein in which the court is located for such action by the Committee as it 
deems necessary and desirable. 

The filing of a motion under this Rule shall constitutes submission to the jurisdiction of 
the  Grievance  Committee  for  the  District  wherein  in  which  the  court  is  located.  The 
county in which the court is located shall be is considered the county of residence of said 
the  non‐resident  attorney  for  purposes  of  determining  venue  in  any  disciplinary  action 
involving said  the attorney.
