Rule 3 
Law Study Requirement 

(a) 

The  law  study  requirement  for  eligibility  of  an  Applicant  to  take  the  Texas  Bar 
Examination, unless otherwise provided in Rule 13 by these Rules, is met by: 

(1) 

graduation with a J.D. degree or its equivalent from an approved law school;  

(2) 

(3) 

satisfaction of all requirements for graduation from an approved law school with a 
J.D. degree or its equivalent; or 

study of law in an approved law school or schools by satisfying all requirements 
for graduation with a J.D. degree or its equivalent, except for not more than four 
semester hours or its equivalent in quarter hours; provided, however, that no person 
shall be licensed to practice law until graduation or satisfaction of all requirements

subsection has not graduated  with a J.D. degree  or satisfied  all  requirements for

Rule 4 
Present Good Moral Character and Fitness Requirement 

No one shall be eligible for admission to the Texas Bar or for certification as a Foreign 
Legal Consultant until the investigation of such person’s moral character and fitness has 
been completed, and it has been determined by the Board that such individual possesses 
present good moral character and fitness. 

Good moral character is a functional assessment of character and fitness of a prospective 
lawyer. The purpose of requiring an Applicant to possess present good moral character is 
to exclude from the practice of law those persons possessing character traits that are likely 
to result in injury to future clients, in the obstruction of the administration of justice, or in 
a violation of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct. These character traits 
usually involve either dishonesty or lack of trustworthiness in carrying out responsibilities. 

 (b) 

(c) 

(a) 

(b) 

Misc. Docket No. 19-9078 
 

7 

There  may  be  other  character  traits  that  are  relevant  in  the  admission  or  certification 
process, but such traits must have a rational connection with the Applicant’s present fitness 
or capacity to practice law and accordingly must relate to the legitimate interests of Texas 
in protecting prospective clients and in safeguarding the system of justice within Texas. 

(c) 

(d) 

Fitness, as used in these Rules, is the assessment of mental and emotional health as it affects 
the competence of a prospective lawyer. The purpose of requiring an Applicant to possess 
this fitness is to exclude from the practice of law any person having a mental or emotional 
illness or condition which would be likely to prevent the person from carrying out duties 
to clients, courts or the profession. A person may be of good moral character, but may be 
incapacitated  from  proper  discharge  of  his  or  her  duties  as  a  lawyer  by  such  illness  or 
condition. The fitness required is a present fitness, and prior mental or emotional illness or 
conditions are relevant only so far as they indicate the existence of a present lack of fitness. 

The following provisions shall govern the determination of present good moral character 
and fitness of a Declarant or an Applicant who has been convicted of a felony in Texas or 
placed on probation for a felony with or without an adjudication of guilt in Texas, or who 
has  been  convicted  or  placed  on  probation  with  or  without  an  adjudication  of  guilt  in 
another jurisdiction for a crime which would be a felony in Texas. A Declarant or Applicant 
may be found lacking in present good moral character and fitness under this Rule rule based 
on the underlying facts of a felony conviction or deferred adjudication, as well as based on 
the conviction or probation through deferred adjudication itself. 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

The record of conviction or order of deferred adjudication is conclusive evidence 
of guilt. 

An  individual  guilty  of  a  felony  under  subsection  (d)  this  rule  is  conclusively 
deemed  not  to  have  present  good  moral  character  and  fitness  and  shall  not  be 
permitted  to  file  a  Declaration  of  Intention  to  Study  Law  or  an  Application 
application for a period of five years after the completion of the sentence and/or 
period of probation. 

Upon a credible showing that a felony conviction or felony probation, either with 
or without an adjudication of guilt, has been reversed on review by an appellate 
court, or that an executive pardon has been granted, the Declarant or Applicant shall 
be permitted to file a Declaration of Intention to Study Law or an Application. 

(e) 

The following provisions shall govern the determination of present good moral character 
and  fitness  of  a  Declarant  or  Applicant  who  has  been  licensed  to  practice  law  in  any 
jurisdiction  and  has  been  disciplined,  or  allowed  to  resign  in  lieu  of  discipline,  in  that 
jurisdiction: 

(1) 

A certified copy of the order or judgment of discipline from the jurisdiction is prima 
facie  evidence  of  the  matters  contained  in  such  order  or  judgment,  and  a  final 
adjudication in the other jurisdiction that the individual in question has committed 

Misc. Docket No. 19-9078 
 

8 

professional  misconduct  is  conclusive  of  the  professional  misconduct  alleged  in 
such order or judgment. 

(2) 

An individual disciplined for professional misconduct in the course of practicing 
law in any jurisdiction or an individual who resigned in lieu of disciplinary action 
(“disciplined individual”) is deemed not to have present good moral character and 
fitness  and  is  therefore  ineligible  to  file  a  Declaration  or  an  Application  for 
Admission to the Texas Bar during the period of such discipline imposed by such 
jurisdiction,  and  in  the  case  of  disbarment  or  resignation  in  lieu  of  disciplinary 
action,  until  the  disciplined  individual  has  properly  filed  an  application  for  re-
licensure  in  the  disciplining  jurisdiction,  in  accordance  with  the  procedures 
established  for  re-licensure  in  that  jurisdiction,  and  has  obtained  a  final 
determination on that application. 

Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  provision  of  this  paragraph  subsection  (e)(2)  and 
except  as  provided  in  paragraph  (d)(2)  Rule  4(d)(2),  if  the  period  of  discipline 
imposed by another jurisdiction exceeds five years, the disciplined individual may 
file a Declaration or an Application after the expiration of five years from the date 
of  imposition  of  such  discipline,  provided  that  (s)he  has  obtained  a  final 
determination on his/her application for re-licensure in the disciplining jurisdiction. 

(3) 

The only defenses available to an Applicant or Declarant under subsection section 
(e) are outlined below and must be proved by clear and convincing evidence: 

(A) 

(B) 

(C) 

The  procedure followed in  the  disciplining  jurisdiction  was so  lacking in 
notice  or  opportunity  to  be  heard  as  to  constitute  a  deprivation  of  due 
process. 

There  was  such  an  infirmity  of  proof  establishing  the  misconduct  in  the 
other  jurisdiction  as  to  give  rise  to  the  clear  conviction  that  the  Board, 
consistent  with  its  duty,  should  not  accept  as  final  the  conclusion  on  the 
evidence reached in the disciplining jurisdiction. 

The  deeming  of  lack  of  present  good  moral  character  and  fitness  by  the 
Board during the period required under subsection the provisions of section 
(e) would result in grave injustice. 

(D) 

The misconduct for which the individual was disciplined does not constitute 
professional misconduct in Texas. 

(4) 

If  the  Board  determines  that  one  or  more  of  the  foregoing  defenses  has  been 
established, it shall render such orders as it deems necessary and appropriate. 

(f)  

An individual who applies for admission to practice law in Texas or who files a petition 
for redetermination of present moral character and fitness after the expiration of the five-
year period required under paragraph subsection (d)(2) above or after the completion of the 

Misc. Docket No. 19-9078 
 

9 

disciplinary  period  assessed  or  ineligibility  period  imposed  by  any  jurisdiction  under 
paragraph (e)(2) subsection (e) above shall be required to prove, by a preponderance of the 
evidence: 

(1) 

that the best interest of the public and the profession, as well as the ends of justice, 
would be served by his or her admission to practice law; 

(2) 

that (s)he is of present good moral character and fitness; and 

(g) 

(h) 

(3) 

that during the five years immediately preceding the present action, (s)he has been 
living a life of exemplary conduct. 

An individual who files a petition for redetermination of present moral character and fitness 
after an adverse a negative determination based on a felony conviction, felony probation 
with or without adjudication of guilt, or professional misconduct or resignation in lieu of 
disciplinary action and whose petition is denied after a hearing, is not eligible to file another 
petition for redetermination until after the expiration of three  years from the date of the 
Board’s order denying the preceding petition for redetermination. 

If an Applicant is alleged to have violated the Texas Bar Examination Security Policy, the 
Executive Director may withhold delivery of the Applicant’s Texas Bar Examination exam 
results until the allegation is resolved by the Board. If, after notice and a hearing, the Board 
determines that an Applicant  violated  the policy, the Board  may  deem the Applicant to 
have failed the Texas Bar Examination exam and prohibit the Applicant from taking the 
Texas Bar Examination exam in the future. 

 
Rule 5 
Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination and Texas Law Component 
Requirements Requirement  

(a)  Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination. An No Applicant for admission to the 
Texas Bar must earn a scaled score of at least 85 on shall be issued a license to practice 
law in Texas until such person has furnished to the Board evidence that (s)he has passed

(b)

successfully completed treatment and has been free from chemical dependency for 
the preceding two years; 

(2) 

recommend, upon a finding that a condition of the Probationary License has been 
violated: 

(A) 

extension of the Probationary License; or 

(B) 

termination or immediate revocation of the Probationary License. 

The Board shall initiate and maintain a working relationship with the Lawyers Assistance

(j) 

A  person  whose  Probationary  License  has  been 
terminated  or  revoked  upon 
recommendation by the Board must begin the licensure process anew in accordance with

omitted or represented by an initial if the Applicant so requests in writing. No license may 
be issued using an alias, assumed name, nickname, or abbreviation of a name. 

All law licenses are issued on the condition that the Applicant has faithfully complied with

(a) 

A reputable attorney, licensed in another State state or in a foreign jurisdiction but not in 
Texas, who resides outside of Texas may seek permission to participate in the proceedings 
of  any  particular  cause  in  a  Texas  court  by  complying  with  the  requirements  of  Texas 
Government Code Section 82.0361 concerning payment of a non-resident attorney fee to 
the Board of Law Examiners as a mandatory initial requirement. Upon completion of this 
requirement and receipt of an acknowledgment issued by the Board of Law Examiners, the 
non-resident  attorney shall  file with the applicable Texas court  a  written, sworn motion 
requesting permission to participate in a particular cause. The motion shall contain: 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

(5) 

(6) 

(7) 

the office address, telephone number, fax number, and email address of the non-
resident attorney movant; 

the name and State Bar card number of an attorney licensed in Texas, with whom 
the  non-resident  attorney  will  be  associated  in  the  Texas  proceedings,  and  that 
attorney’s office address, telephone number, fax number, and email address; 

a list of all cases and causes, including cause number and caption, in Texas courts 
in  which  the  non-resident  attorney  has  appeared  or  sought  leave  to  appear  or 
participate within the past two years; 

a  list  of  jurisdictions  in  which  the  non-resident  attorney  is  licensed,  including 
federal courts, and a statement that the non-resident attorney is or is not an active 
member in good standing in each of those jurisdictions; 

a  statement  that  the  non-resident  attorney  has  or  has  not  been  the  subject  of 
disciplinary action by the Bar or courts of any jurisdiction in which the attorney is 
licensed within the preceding five years, and a description of any such disciplinary 
actions; 

a statement that the non-resident attorney has or has not been denied admission to 
the courts of any State or to any federal court during the preceding five years; 

a statement that the  non-resident attorney is familiar  with  the State Bar  Act, the 
State  Bar  Rules,  and  the  Texas  Disciplinary  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct 
governing the conduct of members of the State Bar of Texas, and will at all times 
abide by and comply with the same so long as such Texas proceeding is pending 
and said Applicant has not withdrawn as counsel therein. 

(b) 

The  motion  of  the  non-resident  attorney  seeking  permission  to  participate  in  Texas 
proceedings must be accompanied by motion of the resident practicing Texas attorney with 
whom the non-resident attorney will be associated in the proceeding of a particular cause. 
The motion must contain a statement that the resident attorney finds the Applicant to be a 
reputable attorney and recommends that the Applicant be granted permission to participate 
in the particular proceeding before the court. 

Misc. Docket No. 19-9078

(c) 

(d) 

(e) 

(a) 

The motion of the non-resident attorney must also be accompanied by the proof of payment 
or proof of indigency acknowledgment issued by the Board of Law Examiners. 

The  court  may  examine  the  non-resident  attorney  to  determine  that  the  non-resident 
attorney is aware of and will observe the ethical standards required of attorneys licensed in 
Texas and to determine whether the non-resident attorney is appearing in courts in Texas 
on a frequent basis. If the court determines that the non-resident attorney is not a reputable 
attorney who will observe the ethical standards required of Texas attorneys, that the non-
resident attorney has been appearing in courts in Texas on a frequent basis, that the non-
resident  attorney  has  been  engaging  in  the  unauthorized  practice  of  law  in  the  State  of 
Texas, or that other good cause exists, the court or hearing officer may deny the motion. 

If, after being granted permission to participate in the proceedings of any particular cause 
in  Texas,  the  non-resident  attorney  engages  in  professional  misconduct  as  that  term  is 
defined  by  the  State  Bar  Act,  the  State  Bar  Rules,  or  the  Texas  Disciplinary  Rules  of 
Professional  Conduct,  the  court  may  revoke  the  non-resident  attorney’s  permission  to 
participate in the Texas proceedings and may cite the non-resident attorney for contempt. 
In addition, the court may refer the matter to the Grievance Committee of the Bar District 
in which the court is located. 

(f)  

The  filing  of  a  motion  under  this  Rule  constitutes  submission  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the 
Grievance Committee for the District in which the court is located. The county in which 
the court is located is considered the county of residence of the non-resident attorney for 
purposes of determining venue in any disciplinary action involving the attorney.

of the military attorney who is registered under this Rule rule and providing representation. Upon 
making an appearance in a civil proceeding, the military attorney shall file a document with the 
court  or  other  tribunal  in  which  the  civil  proceeding  is  pending,  designating  each  individual 
authorized to accept service of process on the military attorney’s behalf and providing the name 
and  complete  address  of  each  authorized  individual.  If  the  military  attorney  does  not  file  this 
document, the military attorney’s agent for service of process shall be the supervisory Staff Judge 
Advocate or supervisory military attorney  whose name appears on the military attorney’s most 
recent application filed pursuant to this Rule, or the successor to that office. 

§7  

Discipline  

A military attorney  granted  limited  permission to practice law in Texas under this Rule rule is 
subject to the Rules Governing Admission to the Bar of Texas, the Texas Disciplinary Rules of 
Professional Conduct, the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure, and any other rules and laws 
governing the discipline of attorneys admitted to the State Bar of Texas. The State Bar of Texas, 
Supreme  Court  of  Texas,  and  other  Texas  courts  have  jurisdiction  over  the  discipline  of  the 
military attorney, regardless of whether the military attorney  retains the right to practice in the 
state,  for  the  military  attorney’s  professional  conduct  while  practicing  in  this  state.  This 
jurisdiction includes, but is not limited to, the authority—concurrent with the Board’s authority 
under Section 5 section 5 of this rule—to terminate the military attorney’s privilege to practice 
law in Texas under this Rule rule.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
