PREFACE 

In 2001, the 77th Texas Legislature passed the Fair Defense Act (SB 7), creating the blueprint 
for  distribution  of  indigent  defense  funding  from  the  State  of  Texas  to  local  government 
through the creation of the Task Force on Indigent Defense, the first state body to administer 
statewide appropriations and policies. During the 82nd Legislative Session (2011), Governor 
Perry signed House Bill 1754 into law, establishing the Texas Indigent Defense Commission 
(Commission), the permanent organization that renamed and replaced the Task Force. 

The Commission provides financial and technical support to counties to develop and maintain 
quality, cost-effective indigent defense systems that meet the needs of local communities and 
the  requirements  of  the  Constitution  and  state  law.  In  addition  to  these  duties,  the 
Commission is pleased to update, provide commentary on, and publish the Fair Defense Laws 
after each legislative session.  

The  Commission  gratefully  acknowledges  the  assistance  of  Kenna  Titus  and  Zacharie 
Kump  in  preparing  this  publication,  as  well  as  Christopher  Lough,  Hayden  Kursh, 
Rachel Gartman, Susan Stradley, Rebecca Yung, Cory Dalton, and Jaret Kanarek 
for their work updating previous versions of the Fair Defense Laws.

counsel,  a  defendant  must  show  first  that 
counsel’s  performance  fell  below  an  objective 
standard of reasonableness. Id. at 687. Second, 
a  defendant  must  show  that  but  for  counsel’s 
deficient  performance,  there  is  a  reasonable 
probability that the outcome of the proceeding 
would have been different. Davis v. State, 278 
S.W.3d 346, 352 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009) (citing 
and interpreting Strickland, 446 U.S. at 692). 
In addition  to  the Strickland requirements,  a 
state prisoner must show that “the state court’s 
decision is so obviously wrong that its error lies 
beyond  any  possibility 
fair minded 
disagreement.” Shinn v. Kayer, 141 S. Ct. 517, 
523 (2020).  

for 

he  prejudice  prong  of  the  Strickland  test  is 
presumed to have been met when an attorney 
file  a  notice  of  appeal  despite 
fails  to 
defendant's  express  wishes.  This 
is  true 
regardless of whether the defendant signed an 
appeal waiver for certain, but not all, possible 
appellate  claims.  Garza  v.  Idaho,  139  S.  Ct. 
738,  738  (2019).  “[A]  lawyer  who  disregards 
specific instructions from the defendant to file 
a  notice  of  appeal  acts  in  a  manner  that  is 
professionally unreasonable.” Id. at 746.  

ore  recently,  the  Supreme  Court  held  that 
defendants  have  received  ineffective  counsel 
when they are not informed of the deportation 
consequence  of  a  guilty  plea.  Padilla  v. 
Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 374 (2010). Further, in 
death penalty cases, an attorney’s performance

make an investigation into mitigation, present 
evidence  that  bolsters  the  State’s  case, 
and fail to  investigate  the  State’s  aggravating 
evidence.  Andrus  v.  Texas,  140  S.  Ct.  1875, 
1881-1882  (2020).  The  Strickland  right  to 
effective  counsel  has  also  been  recognized 
where  postconviction  counsel  is  ineffective.

OMMENTARY:  The  Sixth  Amendment 
guarantees that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, 
the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the 
assistance  of  counsel  for  his  defense.”  This 
fundamental  right  applies  to  the  states 
through  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  See 
Gideon  v.  Wainwright,  372  U.S.  335,  352 
(1963).  Per  the  Supreme  Court’s  decision  in 
Gideon,  indigent  defendants  charged  with  a 
felony who cannot afford to retain an attorney 
have an absolute right to counsel appointed by 
the court. Id. at 342. On the same day that the 
Supreme  Court  decided  Gideon,  it  also  held 
that  denying  the  assistance  of  counsel  on 
appeal because a defendant could not afford to 
pay for an attorney constituted “discrimination 
against  the  indigent.”  Douglas  v.  California, 
372 U.S. 353, 355 (1963). 

he  Supreme  Court  extended  the  right  to 
counsel  to  include  counsel  in  juvenile  court 
proceedings in In re Gault. 387 U.S. 1 (1967). 
In  Argersinger  v.  Hamlin,  the  Court  also 
extended the right to counsel to include counsel 
for either felony or misdemeanor offenses if the 
defendant  is  facing  jail  time.  407  U.S.  25 
(1972).

later interpreted to guarantee that a defendant

CHAPTER 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Art. 1.05 Rights of Accused. 

In  all  criminal  prosecutions  the  accused  shall 
have a speedy public trial by an impartial jury. 
He shall have the right to demand the nature 
and cause of the accusation against him, and to 
have a copy thereof. He shall not be compelled 
to give evidence against himself. He shall have 
the right of being heard by himself, or counsel, 
or both; shall be confronted with the witnesses 
against  him,  and  shall  have  compulsory 
process for obtaining witnesses in his favor. No 

(a) A defendant in a criminal matter is entitled
to be represented by counsel in an adversarial
judicial proceeding. The right to be represented
by  counsel  includes  the  right  to  consult  in
private with counsel sufficiently in advance of
a proceeding to allow adequate preparation for
the proceeding.

(b) For  purposes  of  this  article  and  Articles
26.04 and 26.05 of this code, “indigent” means
a person who is not financially able to employ
counsel.

(c) An indigent defendant is entitled to have an
attorney  appointed  to  represent  him  in  any
adversary  judicial  proceeding  that  may  result
in punishment by confinement and in any other
criminal proceeding if the court concludes that
the interests of justice require representation.
Subject  to  Subsection  (c-1),  if  an  indigent
defendant is entitled to and requests appointed
counsel and if adversarial judicial proceedings
have  been  initiated  against  the  defendant,  a
court or the courts' designee authorized under
Article  26.04  to  appoint  counsel  for  indigent
defendants 
in  which  the
defendant is arrested shall appoint counsel as
soon as possible, but not later than:

in  the  county 

(1) the  end  of  the  third  working  day  after
the date on which the court or the courts'
designee  receives  the  defendant's  request
for appointment of counsel, if the defendant
is  arrested  in  a  county  with  a  population
less than 250,000; or

(2) the end of the first working day after the
date  on  which  the  court  or  the  courts'
designee  receives  the  defendant's  request
for appointment of counsel, if the defendant
is arrested in a county with a population of
250,000 or more.

(c-1) If an indigent defendant is arrested under 
a  warrant  issued  in  a  county  other  than  the 
county in which the arrest was made and the 
defendant is entitled to and requests appointed 

2 

counsel,  a  court  or  the  courts’  designee 
authorized  under  Article  26.04  to  appoint 
counsel  for  indigent  defendants  in  the  county 
that issued the warrant shall appoint counsel 
within the periods prescribed by Subsection (c), 
regardless of whether the defendant is present 
within the county issuing the warrant and even 
if adversarial judicial proceedings have not yet 
been  initiated  against  the  defendant  in  the 
county  issuing  the  warrant.  However,  if  the 
defendant has not been transferred or released 
into  the  custody  of  the  county  issuing  the 
warrant before the 11th day after the date of the 
arrest  and  if  counsel  has  not  otherwise  been 
appointed  for  the  defendant  in  the  arresting 
county under this article, a court or the courts’ 
designee  authorized  under  Article  26.04  to 
appoint counsel for indigent defendants in the 
arresting  county  immediately  shall  appoint 
counsel  to  represent  the  defendant  in  any 
matter  under  Chapter  11  or  17,  regardless  of 
whether adversarial judicial proceedings have 
been  initiated  against  the  defendant  in  the 
arresting county. If counsel is appointed for the 
defendant in the arresting county as required 
by  this  subsection,  the  arresting  county  may 
seek from the county  that issued the warrant 
reimbursement for the actual costs paid by the 
arresting county for the appointed counsel.  

(d) An eligible indigent defendant is entitled to
have  the  trial  court  appoint  an  attorney  to
represent  him  in  the  following  appellate  and
postconviction habeas corpus matters:

(1) an appeal to a court of appeals;

(2) an  appeal  to  the  Court  of  Criminal
Appeals if the appeal is made directly from
the  trial  court  or 
for
if  a  petition 
discretionary review has been granted;

(3) a habeas corpus proceeding if the court
concludes  that  the  interests  of  justice
require representation; and

(4) any  other  appellate  proceeding  if  the
court concludes that the interests of justice
require representation.

defendant  in  writing  or  on  the  record  in  open 
court.  If  a  nonindigent  defendant  appears 
without  counsel  at  a  proceeding  after  having 
been given a reasonable opportunity to retain 
counsel,  the  court,  on  10  days'  notice  to  the 
defendant of a dispositive setting, may proceed 
with  the  matter  without  securing  a  written 
waiver  or  appointing  counsel.  If  an  indigent 
defendant  who  has  refused  appointed  counsel 
in  order  to  retain  private  counsel  appears 
without  counsel  after  having  been  given  an 
opportunity  to  retain  counsel,  the  court,  after 
giving the defendant a reasonable opportunity 
to  request  appointment  of  counsel  or,  if  the 
defendant elects not to request appointment of 
counsel, after obtaining a waiver of the right to 
counsel  pursuant  to  Subsections  (f)  and  (g), 
may proceed with the matter on 10 days' notice 
to the defendant of a dispositive setting. 

(f) A  defendant  may  voluntarily  and
intelligently  waive  in  writing  the  right  to
counsel.  A  waiver  obtained  in  violation  of
Subsection (f-1) or (f-2) is presumed invalid.

(f-1) In any adversary judicial proceeding that 
may result in punishment by confinement, the 
attorney representing the state may not: 

(1) initiate  or  encourage  an  attempt  to
obtain  from  a  defendant  who  is  not
represented  by  counsel  a  waiver  of  the
right to counsel; or

(2) communicate with a defendant who has
requested  the  appointment  of  counsel,
unless  the  court  or  the  court's  designee
authorized  under  Article  26.04  to  appoint
counsel  for  indigent  defendants  in  the
county  has  denied  the  request  and,
subsequent to the denial, the defendant:

opportunity to retain and has failed to

county with a population of less than 250,000, 
if  an  indigent  defendant  is  entitled  to  and 
requests  appointed  counsel  and  if  adversarial 
judicial  proceedings  have  not  been  initiated 
against  the  defendant,  a  court  or  the  courts' 
designee  authorized  under  Article  26.04  to 
appoint counsel for indigent defendants in the 
county in which the defendant is arrested shall 
appoint  counsel  immediately  following  the 
expiration of three working days after the date 
on  which  the  court  or  the  courts'  designee 
receives 
for 
defendant's 
appointment of counsel. If adversarial judicial 
proceedings are initiated against the defendant 
before the expiration of the three working days, 
the court or the courts' designee shall appoint 
counsel as provided by Subsection (c). Subject 
to  Subsection  (c-1),  in  a  county  with  a 
population of 250,000 or more, the court or the 
courts'  designee  shall  appoint  counsel  as 
required  by  this  subsection 
immediately 
following  the  expiration  of  one  working  day 
after the date on which the court or the courts' 
designee  receives  the  defendant's  request  for 
appointment of counsel. If adversarial judicial 
proceedings are initiated against the defendant 
before  the  expiration  of  the  one  working  day, 
the court or the courts' designee shall appoint 
counsel as provided by Subsection (c). 

j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
section,  if  an  indigent  defendant  is  released 
from  custody  prior  to  the  appointment  of 
counsel  under  this  section,  appointment  of 
counsel  is  not  required  until  the  defendant's 
first  court  appearance  or  when  adversarial 
judicial  proceedings  are  initiated,  whichever 
comes first.

unnecessary  delay  appoint  new  counsel  to

he  right  to  counsel  guaranteed  by  the  Sixth 
Amendment  and  Art.  1.051  does  not  attach 
prior  to  the  initiation  of  adversarial  judicial 
proceedings. United States v. Gouveia, 467 U.S. 
180,  188  (1984);  accord  Forte  v.  State,  707 
S.W.2d 89,  91-92 (Tex. Crim. App.  1986). The 
Supreme Court has more recently clarified that 
a  “criminal  defendant’s  initial  appearance 
before  a  judicial  officer,  where  he  learns  the 
charge against him and his liberty is subject to 
restriction,  marks  the  start  of  adversary 
judicial  proceedings.”  Rothgery  v.  Gillespie 
Cty., 554 U.S. 191, 213 (2008) (holding that an 
Art. 15.17 hearing qualifies as an initiation of 
adversarial  judicial  proceedings  and  signals 
attachment of the right to counsel).  

ven after the initiation of adversarial judicial 
proceedings, the right to counsel attaches only 
at  the  “critical  stages”  of  adversary  judicial 
proceedings.  Gilley  v.  State,  418  S.W.3d  114, 
120 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014); Green v. State, 872 
S.W.2d  717,  720  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  1994). 
Critical  stages  are  “proceedings  between  an 
individual  and  agents  of  the  State—whether 
‘formal  or  informal,  in  court  or  out’—that 
amount  to  ‘trial-like  confrontations,’  at  which 
counsel would help the accused ‘in coping with 
legal problems or . . . meeting his adversary.’” 
Rothgery,  554  U.S.  at  212  n.16  (citations 
omitted).  

ost-arraignment  custodial  interrogation  is  a 
critical  stage.  Pecina  v.  State,  361  S.W.3d  68,

OMMENTARY:  The  Sixth  and  Fourteenth 
Amendments dictate that a defendant “must be 
afforded the right to the assistance of counsel 
before he can validly be convicted and punished 
by  imprisonment.”  Blankenship  v.  State,  673 
S.W.2d 578, 582 (Tex. Crim. App. 1984). 

  defendant’s  right  to  counsel  under  Art. 
1.051(c) and the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution  must  be  affirmatively  waived; 
waiver may not be implied from a defendant’s 
failure to request counsel. Oliver v. State, 872 
S.W.2d  713,  715  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  1994).  If  a 
defendant  appears  in  court  without  counsel, 
the  judge,  as  a  preliminary  matter  before 
adversary  judicial  proceedings  begin,  must 
determine if the defendant is aware that he has 
a right to hire counsel and if he intends to do 
so. Id. at 716. If the defendant is indigent and 
cannot  hire  an  attorney  himself,  the  judge

Marin v. State, 891 S.W.2d 267, 272 (Tex. Crim. 
App. 1994). When deciding if Art. 1.051(e) has 
been  violated,  courts  focus  on  the  actual 
preparation  time,  not  the  time  between  the 
formal  appointment  and  the  date  of  the 
proceeding.  Id.  at  270.  Failure  to  satisfy  Art. 
1.051(e)  may  be  raised  on  appeal  without  a 
previous objection. Id. at 268. If a defendant is 
re-indicted and the difference in indictments is 
negligible,  counsel 
is  not  entitled  to  10 
additional  days  to  prepare  for  the  newer 
indictment.  Id.  at  271.  If  more  than  one 
attorney represents the defendant and at least 
one of the attorneys is given 10 days to prepare, 
then Art 1.051(e) is satisfied. Id. Similarly, if a

An  examining  trial  in  Texas  is  “arguably  a 
critical stage” since it is adversarial in nature. 
Green, 872 S.W.2d at 721. On the specific facts 
of  Green,  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  held 
that  the  preliminary  initial  appearance  at 
issue  was  not  a  critical  stage  because  the 
defendant  was  neither  required  nor  asked  to 
plea,  the  probable  cause  determination  was 
non-adversarial,  an  examining  trial  was  not 
held during that time, and bail was not set. Id. 
at 721-22.  

 post-indictment lineup where the accused is 
is  a  critical  stage  of 
physically  present 
prosecution because the confrontation between 
the accused and victims and witnesses involves 
dangers and factors  that  “might  seriously . .  . 
derogate from a fair trial.”  Wade, 388 U.S. at 
228. However, a post-indictment photographic 
display  where  the  accused  is  not  physically 
present is not a critical stage since the accused 
is  not 
is  not  present  and  the  setting 
adversarial. Ash, 413 U.S. at 317, 321.  

he  Government’s  scientific  analysis  of  the 
accused’s fingerprints,  blood sample, clothing, 
hair, and other specimens is not a critical stage 
due  to  the  wide  availability  of  knowledge  of 
these  scientific  techniques  and  technology. 
Wade, 388 U.S. at 227. Because the knowledge 
is  sufficiently  available,  the  accused  has  the 
opportunity  to  meaningfully  confront  the 
Government’s case at trial. Id. at 228. 

n accused’s decision on whether to submit to 
a breath test is not a critical stage that requires 
the  assistance  of  counsel.  Forte  v.  State,  759 
S.W.2d 128, 139 (Tex. Crim. App. 1988).   

n Gilley, the pretrial child witness-competency 
examination at issue was not a critical stage of 
the  appellant’s 
trial  requiring  counsel’s 
participation,  even  though  the  result  of  the 
determination

the  effective  assistance  of  counsel  at  trial).  A 
pretrial procedure that would “impair defense

However,  the  Court  noted  “state  systems  of

effective  assistance  of  counsel  in  Texas  is 
“counsel  reasonably  likely  to  render  and

Butler v. State, 716 S.W.2d 48, 54 (Tex. Crim. 
App.  1986)  (citations  omitted).  If  an  indigent 
defendant seeks a change of appointed counsel, 
it  is  his  burden  to  show  that  he  is  entitled  to 
the change. Malcom v. State, 628 S.W.2d 790, 
791 (Tex. Crim. App. 1982). In order to prevail 
on  a  motion  to  change  appointed  counsel,  a 
defendant must demonstrate that “the totality 
of  the  representation”  does  not  meet  the 
standard for effectiveness. Butler, 716 S.W.2d 
at  54.  Mere  conflicts  of  personality  or 
disagreements  between  client  and  counsel 
concerning  matters  such  as  trial  strategy  are 
“typically not valid grounds” for withdrawal of 
appointed  counsel.  King,  29  S.W.3d  at  566; 
Solis v. State, 792 S.W.2d 95, 100 (Tex. Crim. 
App. 1990).     

he right to counsel may not be manipulated in 
a way that obstructs the fair administration of 
justice  or  the  orderly  procedure  of  the  court. 
Webb v. State, 533 S.W.2d 780, 784 (Tex. Crim. 
App. 1976). As such, “an accused may not wait 
until  the  day  of  trial  to  demand  different 
counsel or to request that counsel be dismissed 
so that he may retain other counsel.” Id. If the 
accused does request a change of counsel on the 
date of trial, the court (1) may appoint or allow 
the  accused  to  retain  new  counsel;  (2)  must 
allow  the  accused  to  represent  himself  if  the 
court  denies  the  accused’s  request  and  the 
accused asserts his right to self-representation 
even  after  a  proper  admonishment  from  the 
court; or (3) may compel the accused who does 
not  waive  the  right  to  counsel  and  does  not 
assert  his  right  to  self-representation  to 
proceed  with  his  current  attorney.  Burgess  v. 
State, 816 S.W.2d 424, 428-29 (Tex. Crim. App. 
1991). 

rial courts may not force defendants to accept 
appointed  counsel  if  they  knowingly  and 
intelligently  waive  the  right  to  counsel  and 
choose  to  defend  themselves.  Faretta  v. 
California, 422 U.S. 806, 814-16 (1975); see also 
Webb, 533  S.W.2d  at 783. However, the State 
may appoint “standby counsel” to be available

the 

  proceeding  for  revocation  of  probation  or 
deferred sentencing is a critical stage because 
an uncounseled defendant might not be aware 
of  options  available  to  him  and  substantial 
rights could thus be affected. Mempa v. Rhay, 
389  U.S.  128,  136  (1967).  Further,  a  first 
appeal of right is a critical stage. Cooks v. State, 
240  S.W.3d  906,  910  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  2007) 
(citing Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 357

appeal an indigent has as of right are decided 
without  benefit  of  counsel,  we  think  an 
unconstitutional line has been drawn between 
rich and poor.”)). The period for filing a motion 
for new trial is also a critical stage because the 
steps  involved  might  be  unreasonable  to 
require  a  defendant  to  complete  without 
assistance.  Id.  (citing  Massingill  v.  State,  8 
S.W.3d 733, 736-37 (Tex. App-Austin 1999, pet.

hen appointing counsel, the court is under no 
obligation  to  search  for  an  attorney  that  the 
defendant  finds  agreeable.  King  v.  State,  29 
S.W.3d  556,  566  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  2000).  The 
right  to  counsel  of  choice  does  not  extend  to 
indigent defendants. United States v. Gonzalez-
Lopez, 548 U.S. 140, 151 (2006).  

ven  though  an  indigent  defendant  is  not 
entitled to counsel of choice, appointed counsel 
cannot  be  removed  against  the  defendant’s 
wishes  once  the  attorney-client  relationship 
has  been  established  unless  the  record  shows 
some “principled reason” for the removal. In re 
Fletcher,  584  S.W.3d  584,  588  (Tex.  App.  – 
Houston [1st Dist.] 2019).  

owever,  indigent  defendants  do  have  the

If  a  defendant  asserted  his  right  to  self-
representation  and  was 
later  appointed 
counsel,  the  record  must  adequately  reflect 
that  a  defendant  waived  his  right  to  self-
representation  after  asserting  it.  Funderburg 
v. State, 717 S.W.2d 637, 642 (Tex. Crim. App. 
1986). Proof of such waiver is not subject to as 
stringent a standard as proof of waiver of the 
right to counsel. Id. It  is  enough if the record 
sufficiently  demonstrates  that  a  defendant 
abandoned  his  initial  request  to  represent 
himself. Id.; see Brown v. Wainwright, 665 F.2d 
607,  611–12  (5th  Cir.  1982).  However,  mere 
acquiescence  to  a  trial  court’s  unmistakable 
denial of his request to represent himself is not 
a  waiver  of  a  defendant’s  right  to  self-
representation.  Funderburg,  717  S.W.2d  at

 court is unlikely to invalidate the distinction

right 

o represent himself at trial, a defendant must 
“knowingly and intelligently” waive his right to 
counsel. Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835. This waiver 
does  not  have  to  be  in  writing,  as  construing 
Art. 1.051(g) to be mandatory would “operate to 
impose counsel on any defendant who refused 
to sign a written waiver” despite an otherwise 
valid invocation of Faretta rights. Burgess, 816 
S.W.2d  at  430.  When  a  defendant  asserts  his 
right  to  self-representation,  the  trial  court 
should determine that he fully understands the 
consequences  of  waiving  his 
to 
representation  of  counsel  by  warning  and 
making  the  defendant  aware  of  “the  dangers 
and  disadvantages  of  self-representation.” 
Faretta,  422 U.S. at 835;  Burton v. State, 634 
S.W.2d  692,  694  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  1982).  This 
determination requires that the trial court look 
not at whether the defendant can demonstrate 
“some  skill  or  expertise,”  but  rather,  at  the 
defendant’s  “background,  age,  experience, 
[and]  education.”  Id.  The  trial  court  may  also 
take  a  defendant’s  mental  capacity 
into 
account  by  “asking  whether  a  defendant  who 
seeks  to  conduct  his  own  defense  at  trial  is 
mentally  competent  to  do  so.”  Indiana  v. 
Edwards, 554 U.S.  164,  177-78 (2008); accord 
Chadwick  v.  State,  309  S.W.3d  558,  561-562 
(Tex. Crim. App. 2010). 

urthermore,  the  trial  judge  must  inform 
defendants  that  “there  are  technical  rules  of 
evidence  and  procedure”  and 
the 
defendants  “will  not  be  granted  any  special 
consideration  solely  because  [they]  asserted 
[their]  pro  se  rights.”  Williams  v.  State,  252 
S.W.3d  353,  356  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  2008) 
(quoting Johnson v. State, 760 S.W.2d 277, 279 
(Tex. Crim. App. 1988)).  

that 

t  is  important  to  note  that  the  statutory 
language in 1.051(g) addresses only the waiver 
of the right to appointed counsel, however if the 
defendant  will  be  self-represented, 
in  a 
contested  matter,  the  Court  should  give  the 
admonishments listed in Faretta v. California 
and make the required findings.

Sec.  2.  After  indictment  found  in  any  felony

ec. 3. (a) After final conviction in any felony 
case, the writ must be made returnable to the

other than a case in which the death penalty is 
imposed,  must  be  filed  with  the  clerk  of  the

021 Legislative Note: HB 3774 Section 8.01 
amends  Section  3(b),  article  11.07,  to  require 
that  the  attorney  representing  the  state 
answer  the  application  for  writ  of  habeas 
corpus application not later than the 30th day, 
rather than the 15th day, after the date the copy 
of the application is received.  

OMMENTARY:  The statutory language in Art. 
11.07  indicates  that  the  Legislature  intended 
to  permit  “each  applicant  one  full  and  fair 
opportunity” to pursue post-conviction claims, 
while also “prevent[ing] perpetual litigation of 
cases  on  habeas.”  Ex  parte  Speckman,  537 
S.W.3d 49, 52 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017) 

hen  a  defendant  has  received  ineffective 
assistance  of  counsel,  the  resulting  conviction 
may  be  reversed  following  a  writ  of  habeas 
corpus  filed  pursuant  to  Art.  11.07  if  the 
conviction  has  caused  adverse  collateral 
consequences. Ex parte Morse, 591 S.W.2d 904, 
905 (Tex. Crim. App. 1980). In Ex parte Morse, 
an  indigent  defendant  entered  a  guilty  plea 
before a lawyer was appointed to him. Id. This 
conviction  resulted 
in  adverse  collateral 
consequences for the defendant in the form of 
job 
parole 
classification.  Id.  The  court  granted  the 
defendant’s  writ  of  habeas  corpus  and  found 
that  “[m]ootness  cannot  prohibit  a  collateral 
attack  if  prior  convictions  that  have  been 
collateral 
discharged  may  have  serious 
consequences to a criminal defendant.” Id.

App.  2009).  An  applicant’s  waiver  of  habeas 
relief  cannot  be  knowing  and  intelligent  for 
claims  such  as  “actual  innocence  based  on 
newly  available  evidence,  the  suppression  of 
material,  exculpatory  evidence  by  the  State, 
and  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel.”  Id.  at 
498.  These  claims  cannot  usually  be  waived 
because  “an  applicant  cannot  be  expected  to 
have  known  about  the  existence  of  the  facts 
that  support  such  claims  at  the  time  of  his 
waiver.” Id.  

rt. 11.071.  PROCEDURE IN DEATH PENALTY 

CASE.  

ec. 1.  APPLICATION TO DEATH PENALTY 

CASE. 
Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this 
chapter, this article establishes the procedures 
for an application for a writ of habeas corpus in 
which  the  applicant  seeks  relief  from  a 
judgment imposing a penalty of death. 

ec. 2.  REPRESENTATION BY COUNSEL. 

(a)  An  applicant  shall  be  represented  by 
competent  counsel  unless  the  applicant  has 
elected  to  proceed  pro  se  and  the  convicting 
trial court finds, after a hearing on the record, 
that the applicant's election is  intelligent  and 
voluntary. 

 

(b)  If  a  defendant  is  sentenced  to  death  the 
convicting court, immediately after judgment is 
entered under Article 42.01, shall determine if 
the  defendant  is  indigent  and,  if  so,  whether 
the  defendant  desires  appointment  of  counsel 
for the purpose of a writ of habeas corpus. If the 
defendant  desires  appointment  of  counsel  for 
the  purpose  of  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus,  the 
court  shall  appoint  the  office  of  capital  and 
forensic  writs  to  represent  the  defendant  as 
provided by Subsection (c). 

c)  At  the  earliest  practical  time,  but  in  no 
event  later  than  30  days,  after  the  convicting 
court  makes  the  findings  required  under

Sec. 3.  INVESTIGATION OF GROUNDS FOR 
APPLICATION.  
(a)  On  appointment,  counsel  shall  investigate 
expeditiously,  before  and  after  the  appellate 
record is filed in the court of criminal appeals, 
the factual and legal grounds for the filing of an 
application for a writ of habeas corpus. 

(b) Not later than the 30th day before the date 
the  application  for  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus  is 
filed with the convicting court, counsel may file 
with the convicting court an ex parte, verified, 
and  confidential  request  for  prepayment  of 
expenses, including expert fees, to investigate 
and  present  potential  habeas  corpus  claims. 
The request for expenses must state: 

1)  the  claims  of  the  application  to  be 
investigated; 

2) specific facts that suggest that a claim 
of possible merit may exist; and 

3) an itemized list of anticipated expenses 
for each claim. 

c) The court shall grant a request for expenses 
in whole or in part if the request for expenses 
is timely and reasonable. If the court denies in 
whole or in part the request for expenses, the 
court  shall  briefly  state  the  reasons  for  the 
denial  in  a  written  order  provided  to  the 
applicant. 
 

(d)  Counsel  may  incur  expenses  for  habeas 
corpus  investigation,  including  expenses  for 
experts,  without  prior  approval  by 
the 
convicting  court  or  the  court  of  criminal 
appeals.  On  presentation  of  a  claim  for 
reimbursement,  which  may  be  presented  ex 
parte, 
the  convicting  court  shall  order 
reimbursement  of  counsel  for  expenses,  if  the 
reasonably  necessary  and 
expenses  are 
reasonably  incurred.  If  the  convicting  court 
denies  in  whole  or  in  part  the  request  for 
expenses,  the  court  shall  briefly  state  the 
reasons  for  the  denial  in  a  written  order 
provided  to  the  applicant.  The  applicant  may 
request  reconsideration  of  the  denial  for 
reimbursement by the convicting court.

Government Code. 

ec. 2A.  STATE REIMBURSEMENT; COUNTY 

OBLIGATION. 
(a)  The  state  shall  reimburse  a  county  for 
compensation of counsel under Section 2, other 
than for compensation of counsel employed by 
the office of capital and forensic writs, and for 
payment  of  expenses  under  Section  3, 
regardless  of  whether  counsel  is  employed  by 
the office of capital and forensic writs. The total 
amount of reimbursement to which a county is 
entitled  under  this  section  for  an  application 
under  this  article  may  not  exceed  $25,000. 
Compensation  and  expenses  in  excess  of  the 
$25,000  reimbursement  provided  by  the  state 
are the obligation of the county. 

b)  A  convicting  court  seeking  reimbursement 
for a county shall certify to the comptroller of 
public  accounts  the  amount  of  compensation 
that the county is entitled to receive under this 
section.  The  comptroller  of  public  accounts 
shall  issue  a  warrant  to  the  county  in  the 
amount certified by the convicting court, not to 
exceed $25,000. 

c)  The  limitation  imposed  by  this  section  on 
the reimbursement by the state to a county for 
compensation  of  counsel  and  payment  of 
reasonable expenses does not prohibit a county 
from  compensating  counsel  and  reimbursing 
expenses in an amount that is in excess of the 
amount  the  county  receives  from  the  state  as 
reimbursement,  and  a  county  is  specifically 
granted  discretion  by  this  subsection  to  make 
payments 
state

permitted  by  this  subsection  shall  certify  the 
amount the county is entitled to receive under

ec. 4.  FILING OF APPLICATION. 

(a) An application for a writ of habeas corpus, 
returnable  to  the  court  of  criminal  appeals, 
must be filed in the convicting court not later 
than  the  180th  day  after  the  date  the 
convicting  court  appoints  counsel  under 
Section 2 or not later than the 45th day after 
the  date  the  state's  original  brief  is  filed  on 
direct  appeal  with  the  court  of  criminal 
appeals, whichever date is later. 

(b) The convicting court, before the filing date 
that  is  applicable  to  the  applicant  under 
Subsection (a), may for good cause shown and 
after notice and an opportunity to be heard by 
the  attorney  representing  the  state  grant  one 
90-day extension that begins on the filing date 
applicable  to  the  defendant  under  Subsection 
(a).  Either  party  may  request  that  the  court 
hold a hearing on the request. If the convicting 
court finds that the applicant cannot establish 
good cause justifying the requested extension, 
the court shall make a finding stating that fact 
and deny the request for the extension. 

c) An application filed after the filing date that 
is applicable to the applicant under Subsection 
(a) or (b) is untimely. 

(d) If the convicting court receives an untimely 
application or determines that after the filing 
date  that  is  applicable  to  the  applicant  under 
Subsection  (a)  or  (b)  no  application  has  been 
filed, the convicting court immediately, but in 
any  event  within  10  days,  shall  send  to  the 
court  of  criminal  appeals  and  to  the  attorney 
representing the state: 

 

 

  (

1) a copy of the untimely application, with 
a statement of the convicting court that the

the  jury  in  the  applicant's  trial  under 
Article 37.071, 37.0711, or 37.072.

(a)  have  been  satisfied.  The 
convicting court may not take further action on 
the  application  before  the  court  of  criminal 
appeals  issues  an  order  finding  that  the 
requirements have been satisfied. If the court 
of  criminal  appeals  determines  that  the 
requirements have not been satisfied, the court 
shall issue an order dismissing the application 
as an abuse of the writ under this section.

and reimbursement of counsel appointed under 
Subsection  (b)(3)  in  the  same  manner  as  if 
counsel  had  been  appointed  by  the  convicting 
court,  unless  the  attorney  is  employed  by  the 
office  of  capital  and  forensic  writs,  in  which 
case  the  compensation  of  the  attorney  is 
governed  by  Subchapter  B,  Chapter  78, 
Government Code. 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
article,  the  court  of  criminal  appeals  shall 
appoint counsel and establish a new filing date 
for application, which may be no later than the 
270th  day  after  the  date  on  which  counsel  is 
appointed,  for  each  applicant  who  before 
filed  an  untimely 
September  1,  1999, 
application  or  failed  to  file  an  application 
before the date required by Section 4(a) or (b). 
Section  2A  applies  to  the  compensation  and 
payment  of  expenses  of  counsel  appointed  by 
the  court  of  criminal  appeals  under  this 
subsection, unless the attorney is employed by 
the office of capital and forensic writs, in which 
case  the  compensation  of  that  attorney  is 
governed  by  Subchapter  B,  Chapter  78, 
Government Code. 

ec. 5.  SUBSEQUENT APPLICATION. 

(a)  If  a  subsequent  application  for  a  writ  of 
habeas  corpus  is  filed  after  filing  an  initial 
application,  a  court  may  not  consider  the 
merits  of  or  grant  relief  based  on  the 
subsequent  application  unless  the  application 
contains  sufficient  specific  facts  establishing 
that:

1) the current claims and issues have not 
been  and  could  not  have  been  presented

court of appeals of the United States, or a court
of  appellate  jurisdiction  of  this  state  on  or
before that date.

(e) For purposes of Subsection (a)(1), a factual
basis  of  a  claim  is  unavailable  on  or  before  a
date  described  by  Subsection  (a)(1)  if  the
factual basis was not ascertainable through the
exercise  of  reasonable  diligence  on  or  before
that date.

(f) If an amended or supplemental application
is  not  filed  within  the  time  specified  under
Section  4(a)  or  (b),  the  court  shall  treat  the
application as a subsequent application under
this section.

Sec. 6.  ISSUANCE OF WRIT. 
(a) If a timely application for a writ of habeas

date  the  state  answers  the  application,  the 
convicting  court  shall  determine  whether 
controverted,  previously  unresolved  factual 
issues material to the legality of the applicant's 
confinement  exist  and  shall  issue  a  written 
order of the determination.

shall 
expeditiously review all applications for a writ 
of habeas corpus submitted under this article. 
The court may set the cause for oral argument 
and may request further briefing of the issues 
by  the  applicant  or  the  state.  After  reviewing 
the  record,  the  court  shall  enter  its  judgment 
remanding the applicant to custody or ordering

OMMENTARY:  There  is  no  federal  or  state 
constitutional  right  to  counsel  for  writs  of 
habeas corpus. Ex parte Graves, 70 S.W.3d 103, 
110 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002) (citing Coleman v. 
(1991)). 
Thompson,  501  U.S.  722,  752 
Accordingly, there is no constitutional right to 
have effective counsel for habeas proceedings; 
however,  Article  11.071  provides  a  statutory 
right to “competent” counsel for a defendant’s 
initial  habeas  proceedings.  Graves,  70  S.W.3d 
at 113.  

n Texas, the competency of counsel in habeas 
proceedings  is  determined  by  the  counsel’s 
qualifications,  experience,  and  abilities  at  the 
initial  appointment  of  counsel,  as  opposed  to 
the final product of representation. Id. at 114.  

State  and  federal  courts  share  concurrent 
habeas  corpus 
jurisdiction  to  review  the 
constitutional  legitimacy  of  a  conviction  or 
death  sentence  obtained  in  state  court.”  Ex 
parte Moreno, 245 S.W.3d 419, 428 (Tex. Crim. 
App.  2008).  Federal  courts  may  grant  an 
applicant’s claim previously adjudicated on the 
merits  “only  if  [the  Texas  Court  of  Criminal 
Appeals]  has  misapplied  clearly  established 
federal  law.”  Ex  parte  Hood,  304  S.W.3d  397,

nder 

the  second  exception 

(“innocence 
gateway”), the court evaluates the old and new 
evidence,  regardless  of  whether  it  would  be 
admitted under the rules of evidence at trial, to 
determine  whether  the  applicant  has  met  his 
threshold burden of prima facie innocence by a 
preponderance of evidence that no reasonable 
juror  would  have  found  the  defendant  guilty 
beyond a reasonable doubt. Ex parte Reed, 271 
S.W.3d.  at  733-34  (citing  House  v.  Bell,  547 
U.S.  518,  537-38  (2006)).  If  the  innocence 
threshold is satisfied, the court then considers 
the  otherwise  barred  constitutional  claim  on 
the  merits  to  conclude  how  reasonable, 
properly instructed jurors would have decided 
in light of the supplemented record. Id. at 734 
(citing  House,  547  U.S.  at  538).   The  Court  of 
Criminal  Appeals  has  adopted  the  Supreme 
Court’s formulation of the burden a petitioner 
bears to meet this exception, which is to “show 
that the constitutional error ‘probably’ resulted 
in  the  conviction  of  one  who  was  actually 
innocent.” Ex parte Elizondo, 947 S.W.2d 202, 
209 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996) (quoting Schlup v. 
Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 322 (1995) (superseded by 
statute as applied to federal courts)).  

  U

he  third  exception,  actual  innocence  of  the 
death  penalty,  requires  “clear  and  convincing 
evidence.”  Blue,  230  S.W.3d  at  162-63.  An 
intellectual  disability  claim  in  a  subsequent 
writ  that  does  not  meet  the  first  exception—
newly  available  facts  or  law—may  meet  this 
third exception. Id. To do so, it must satisfy the 
higher  Section  5(a)(3)  “clear  and  convincing 
evidence” standard of proof. Id. 

  state  prisoner  procedurally  defaults  on 
potential  federal  habeas  claims  if  he  or  she 
in  state  court 
defaults  on  such  claims 
“pursuant  to  an  independent  and  adequate 
state  procedural  rule.”  Aguilar  v.  Dretke,  428 
F.3d  526,  532-33  (5th  Cir.  2005)  (quoting 
Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750).  Federal courts have 
consistently  viewed  the  Section  5(a)  abuse  of 
writ provision as  “adequate and independent” 
procedural  grounds  for  procedural  default 
purposes in federal courts. Aguilar, 428 F.3d at 
533.  Federal  courts  will  not  apply  the 
procedural default “unless the last state court

against 

fter  filing  an  initial  writ  application,  an 
applicant may not have his or her subsequent 
writ  applications  considered  by  state  courts 
unless his or her application falls within one of 
the  three  statutory  exceptions  to  the  general 
subsequent  writs 
prohibition 
enumerated in Article 11.071, section 5(a). The 
first exception is a showing of new facts or law 
that were not available at the time of filing of 
any  previous  writ. See  Hood,  304  S.W.3d  at 
406. The second exception is a claim of actual 
innocence coupled with a showing that, but for 
a  Constitutional  violation,  no  rational  juror 
could have found the applicant guilty beyond a 
reasonable doubt (the “innocence gateway”). Ex 
parte  Reed,  271  S.W.3d  698,  733  (Tex.  Crim. 
App. 2008); Ex Parte Brooks, 219 S.W.3d 396, 
398-400  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  2007)  The  third 
is  a  showing  that,  but  for  a 
exception 
Constitutional  violation,  no  rational 
juror 
would have answered in the State’s favor one 
or more of the special issues submitted in the 
applicant’s  trial  (“innocence  of  the  death 
penalty”). Ex parte Blue, 230 S.W.3d 151, 159-
60 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). In non-capital cases, 
even jurisdictional claims cannot be brought in 
a  subsequent  writ  unless  one  of  the  statutory 
exceptions is met. Ex parte Sledge, 391 S.W.3d 
104,  106  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  2013).  While  the 
Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  has  not  explicitly 
applied this interpretation to capital cases, the 
language of the non-capital statute (Art. 11.07 
§ 4(a)) is extremely similar to the language of 
Art. 11.071 § 5(a). See id.  

o meet the first exception under a showing of 
new  law,  the  applicant  must  allege  facts 
minimally  sufficient  to  bring  him  within  the 
ambit of the new legal basis for relief. Ex parte 
Staley,  160  S.W.3d  56,  63  (Tex.  Crim.  App. 
2005).  A  medical  examiner’s  statements 
recanting  his  critical  trial  testimony  due  to 
advancements in medical research satisfied the 
requirements  of  Section  5(a)  to  bring  a

Supreme Court did not declare an alternative 
rule,  it  held  that  while  states  had  “some 
flexibility,”  they  did  not  have  “unfettered 
discretion,” and are further constrained by the 
standards  in  the  medical  community.  Id.  at 
1053; see also Moore v. Texas, 139 S. Ct. 666, 
203 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2019) (holding that the Texas 
Court of Criminal appeals erred in determining 
that the defendant did not have an intellectual 
disability).  Following  the  Supreme  Court’s 
holding  in  Moore,  the  Fifth  Circuit  has 
abandoned  the  Briseno  factors  and  instead 
applies  the  standard  set  forth  in  the  most 
current version of the American Association of 
Intellectual  and  Development  Disabilities 
manual.  Cathey  v.  Davis  (In  re  Cathey),  857 
F.3d 221, 238–39 (5th Cir. 2017).  

ntellectual disability is a sentencing issue and 
may not be litigated pretrial. Petetan v. State, 
No.  AP-77,038,  2017  Tex.  Crim.  App.  LEXIS 
286, at *127-29 (Tex. Crim. App. Mar. 8, 2017). 
In  habeas  proceedings  where  an  applicant 
raises  an  Atkins  claim  that  he  has  an 
intellectual disability and cannot be executed, 
the applicant bears the burden of proving by a 
preponderance of the evidence that he has an 
intellectual  disability.  Briseno,  135  S.W.3d  at 
12 (overruled on other grounds); Neal v. State, 
256  S.W.3d  264,  273  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  2008) 
(holding

pplicants  that  file  late,  after  relying  in  good 
faith on a mistaken calculation of a deadline by 
a  court,  may  still  have  their  petitions 
considered.  Ex  parte  Ramos,  977  S.W.2d  616, 
617 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998). An application for 
an extension of a habeas deadline must be filed 
and  ruled  on  before  the  original  deadline.  Ex 
parte Reynoso, 257 S.W.3d 715, 720 (Tex. Crim. 
App.  2008).  If  the  original  deadline  falls  on  a 
weekend or holiday, the applicant may file the 
habeas  writ  on  the  next  business  day.  Id.  at 
722.

to  consider  the  claim  ‘clearly  and  expressly’ 
relied  on  an  independent  and  adequate  state 
ground.” Emery v. Johnson, 139 F.3d 191, 195 
(5th  Cir.  1997)  (citing  Coleman,  501  U.S.  at 
735). If the procedural default applies, federal 
habeas review of the claim is barred unless the 
applicant  “can  demonstrate  cause  for  the 
default and actual prejudice as a result of the 
alleged violation of federal law, or demonstrate 
that failure to consider the claims will result in 
a fundamental miscarriage of justice.” Aguilar, 
428 F.3d at 532-33 (quoting Coleman, 501 U.S. 
at 750). Note in Trevino v. Thaler, 569 U.S. 413, 
417-418  (2013)  the  Supreme  Court  held  “the 
structure  and  design”  of  Texas’  appellate 
system  makes  it  “virtually  impossible”  for  an 
ineffective claim to be raised on direct appeal, 
and  failure  to  do  so  cannot  be  the  basis  of  a 
procedural default. 

xecuting 

intellectual 
individuals  with 
disabilities violates the 8th Amendment of the 
Constitution.  Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 
321 (2002). (The Supreme Court now uses the 
term  “intellectual  disability” 
in  place  of 
“mental  retardation,”  but  has  defined  them 
identically.  Hall v. Florida, 572 U.S. 701, 704 
(2014)).  There  is  no  national  standard  for 
enforcing this prohibition; states are left with 
“the  task  of  developing  appropriate  ways  to 
enforce  the  constitutional  restriction  upon  its 
execution  of  sentences.”  Atkins,  536  U.S.  at 
317.  Texas  has  no  legislation  guiding  the 
process of determining intellectual disability in 
a death-penalty context or defining intellectual 
disability  for  the  purposes  of  the  Atkins 
exemption. See Ex parte Briseno, 135 S.W.3d 1, 
6  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  2004)  (noting  the  lack  of 
relevant  legislation);  see  also  Ex  parte  Sosa, 
364  S.W.3d  889,  891  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  2012) 
(defaulting  to  applying  guidance  from  the 
American  Association  on  Intellectual  and 
Developmental  Disabilities  in  the  absence  of 
legislation).  Consequently, 
the  Court  of 
Criminal  Appeals  created  its  own  guidelines 
for the determination of intellectual disability 
in  Briseno,  135  S.W.3d  at  6.  However,  the 
Supreme  Court  struck  down  the  Briseno 
guidelines, holding them to be “lay perceptions” 
that “create an unacceptable risk that persons 
with  [mental  retardation]  will  be  executed.”

OMMENTARY:  The  Fourth  Amendment 
requires  a  prompt  “judicial  determination  of 
probable  cause  as  a  prerequisite  to  extended 
restraint  of  liberty  following  arrest  [without 
warrant].” Gerstein, 420 U.S. at 114. Applying 
Gerstein,  the  Supreme  Court  has  held  that 
generally, there is no unreasonable delay when 
a  jurisdiction  makes  such  a  determination 
within 48 hours of arrest. Cnty. of Riverside v. 
McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 55 (1991). However, 
a  determination  made  within  48  hours  may 
violate Gerstein if it was delayed unreasonably 
(e.g., a delay to gather more evidence to justify 
the  arrest  or  a  delay  motivated  by  malice 
towards the arrestee). Id.   

Absent  a  showing  of  a  causal  connection 
between the failure to take an accused before a 
magistrate  and  the  accused’s  confession,” 
neglecting  to  take  the  accused  before  a 
magistrate without unnecessary delay does not 
invalidate a voluntary confession if the accused

intellectual  disability,  the  magistrate  shall 
conduct  the  proceedings  described  by  Article 
16.22 or 17.032, as appropriate. 

b)  After  an  accused  charged  with  a 
misdemeanor punishable by fine only is taken 
before  a  magistrate  under  Subsection  (a)  and 
the magistrate has identified the accused with 
certainty,  the  magistrate  may  release  the 
accused without bond and order the accused to 
appear  at  a  later  date  for  arraignment  in  the 
applicable justice court or municipal court. The 
order must state in writing the time, date, and 
place  of  the  arraignment,  and  the  magistrate 
must sign the order. The accused shall receive 
a  copy  of  the  order  on  release.  If  an  accused 
fails  to  appear  as  required  by  the  order,  the 
judge  of  the  court  in  which  the  accused  is 
required to appear shall issue a warrant for the 
arrest of the accused. If the accused is arrested 
and  brought  before  the  judge,  the  judge  may 
admit the accused to bail, and in admitting the 
accused  to  bail,  the  judge  should  set  as  the 
amount  of  bail  an  amount  double  that 
generally  set  for  the  offense  for  which  the 
accused was arrested. This subsection does not 
apply  to  an  accused  who  has  previously  been 
convicted  of  a  felony  or  a  misdemeanor  other 
than a misdemeanor punishable by fine only. 

c)  When  a  deaf  accused  is  taken  before  a 
magistrate under this article or Article 14.06 of 
this  Code,  an  interpreter  appointed  by  the 
magistrate qualified and sworn as provided in 
Article  38.31  of  this  Code  shall  interpret  the 
warning  required  by  those  articles  in  a 
language  that  the  accused  can  understand, 
including but not limited to sign language. 

d)  If  a  magistrate  determines  that  a  person 
brought  before  the  magistrate  after  an  arrest 
authorized  by  Article  14.051  of  this  code  was 
arrested  unlawfully,  the  magistrate  shall 
release  the  person  from  custody.  If  the 
magistrate  determines  that  the  arrest  was 
lawful,  the  person  arrested  is  considered  a 
fugitive from justice for the purposes of Article 
51.13  of  this  code,  and  the  disposition  of  the 
person is controlled by that article.

reasonable  assistance 
the 
necessary forms for requesting appointment of 
counsel is provided to the person at the same 
time.  If  the  person  arrested  is  indigent  and 
requests  appointment  of  counsel  and  if  the

appoint counsel for indigent defendants in the 
county, the magistrate shall appoint counsel in

COMMENTARY:  Procedures  normally  required 
after arrest of accused persons and during the 
preliminary  proceedings  that  follow,  such  as 
the specific requirements of Art. 15.17, do not 
apply  to  persons  charged  with  a  community 
supervision  violation.  Yates  v.  State,  941 
S.W.2d  357,  362  (Tex.  App.—Waco  1997,  writ 
ref’d).   

the 

Under  Art.  15.17(a),  there  is  no  “unnecessary 
delay” when officers do not immediately bring 
an  arrestee  before 
first  available 
magistrate.  See  Jenkins  v.  State,  912  S.W.2d 
793,  807  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  1995).  In  Jenkins, 
there  was  no  unnecessary  delay  when  the 
officers first brought the arrested person before 
a magistrate approximately sixteen hours after 
his arrest even though a magistrate had been 
available  at  an  earlier  time.  Id.  Moreover, 
“failure  to  bring  an  arrested  person  before  a 
magistrate  in  a  timely  manner  will  not 
invalidate a confession unless there is proof of 
causal  connection  between  the  delay  and 
confession.”  Cantu  v.  State,  842  S.W.2d  667, 
680 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992). Failing to bring a 
a  magistrate  while 
defendant 
investigation  continues 
to  be  conducted 
following  the  arrest  also  does  not  constitute 
unnecessary  delay.  Gonzalez  v.  State,  616 
S.W.3d 585, 594 (Tex. Crim. App. 2020). 

before 

A  defendant’s  Sixth  Amendment  right  to 
counsel  “attaches,”  i.e.,  begins,  when  he  is 
brought  before  a  magistrate,  informed  of  the 
charges  against  him,  and  that  his  liberty  is 
subject  to  restriction.  Rothgery  v.  Gillespie 
Cnty., 554 U.S. 191, 213 (2008). The accused is 
entitled  to  the  presence  of  counsel  at  any 
critical stage that occurs thereafter. Id. at 212. 
Custodial  interrogation  is  one  such  critical 
stage. Pecina v. State, 361 S.W.3d 68, 78 n. 40 
(Tex. Crim. App. 2012).

The

Fifth 
Amendment  right  against  self-incrimination. 
Montejo  v.  Louisiana,  556  U.S.  778,  794–795 
to 
(2009).  The  Fifth  Amendment  right 

stemming 

from 

the

broader  than  the  Sixth  Amendment  right  to 
trial  counsel;  it  only  applies  to  custodial 
interrogations, but it applies to all suspects in 
custodial  interrogation,  even  those  against 
whom 
not 
commenced. Id. at 795. Otherwise, they are the 
same with respect  to custodial interrogations. 
Pecina,  361  S.W.3d  at  76–77  (“Once  formal 
adversary  proceedings  begin, 
the  Sixth 
Amendment right to counsel applies in exactly 
the  same  way  as  the  Fifth  Amendment  right 
applies to custodial interrogation”). 

proceedings 

have 

A  defendant  is  “in  custody”  when  there  is  a 
“formal  arrest  or  restraint  on  freedom  of 
movement to the degree associated with formal 
arrest.” New York v. Quarles, 467 U.S. 649, 655 
(1984).  For  example,  a  defendant  placed  in 
handcuffs and surrounded by four officers is in 
custody.  See  id.  Relatedly,  “interrogation” 
includes “express questioning or its functional 
equivalent.”  Rhode  Island  v.  Innis,  446  U.S. 
291,  300-301  (1980).  It  refers  “not  only  to 
express questioning but to any words or actions 
on  the  part  of  the  police  (other  than  those 
normally attendant to arrest and custody) that 
the police should know are reasonably likely to 
elicit  an  incriminating  response  from  the 
subject.” Id. at 301. 

the 

defendant 

At the onset of a custodial interrogation before 
questioning  begins,  police  must  advise  the 
suspect of his rights via the Miranda warnings. 
Pecina,  361  S.W.3d  at  75-76.  Reading  the 
suspect the warnings from Article 38.22 of the 
Texas Code of Criminal Procedure satisfies the 
Miranda  requirements.  Clark  v.  State,  627 
S.W.2d 693, 704 (Tex. Crim. App. 1982). Only 
voluntarily 
if 
and 
intelligently waives 
his Miranda rights, 
including the right to have an attorney present 
during  questioning,  may  his  statement  be 
introduced  into  evidence  against  him  at  trial. 
Pecina, 361 S.W.3d at 75. If a defendant asserts 
his  right  to  counsel,  the  interrogation  must 
stop.  Edwards  v.  Arizona,  451  U.S.  477,  485 
(1981).  Police  may  not  reinitiate  questioning 
without counsel present—even if the defendant 
consults with counsel  in the interim.  Minnick 
v. Mississippi,  498  U.S.  146,  153  (1990);
Hughen  v.  State,  297  S.W.3d  330,  335  (Tex.
Crim.  App.  2009).  “[W]hen  an  accused  has

24 

invoked  his  right  to  have  counsel  present 
during  custodial interrogation,  a  valid  waiver 
of that right cannot be established by showing 
only  that  he  responded  to  further  police-
initiated custodial interrogation even if he has 
been advised of his rights.” Edwards, 451 U.S. 
at 484. The Edwards rule is “meant to prevent 
police 
into 
from  badgering  defendants 
changing  their  minds  about  their  rights.” 
Montejo, 556 U.S. at 789. 

understand 

Invocations  of  the  right  to  counsel  during 
custodial interrogation must be unambiguous. 
Davis  v.  United  States,  512  U.S.  452,  459 
(1994).  The  defendant  must  articulate  his 
desire  to  have  counsel  present  sufficiently 
clearly  that  a  reasonable  police  officer  in  the 
the 
circumstances  would 
statement to be a request for an attorney. Id. If 
the statement requesting an attorney does not 
meet  the  requisite  level  of  clarity, the  officers 
are not required to stop questioning the subject 
under Edwards. Id.; see Moran v. Burbine, 475 
U.S.  412,  433,  n.4  (1986)  ("The  interrogation 
must cease until an attorney is present only if 
individual  states  that  he  wants  an 
the 
attorney.") (emphasis in original) (citations and 
internal quotation marks omitted). 

A defendant’s invocation of the right to counsel 
during magistration does  not invoke his right 
to  counsel  during  interrogation.  Pecina,  361 
S.W.3d  at  78  (interpreting  and  applying 
Montejo,  556  U.S.  at  796).  In  Pecina,  the 
defendant  failed  to  invoke  either  of  his 
constitutional  rights  to  counsel  for  custodial 
interrogation  when  he  asked  the  judge  for  a 
lawyer and simultaneously agreed to speak to 
the police during his magistration hearing. Id. 
at 79. At the beginning of the interrogation, the 
defendant  heard  and  waived  his  Miranda 
rights, and did not stop the interrogation, nor 
did he ask to speak with counsel. Id. at 80. By 
failing  to  tell  the  officers  that  he  wished  to 
speak  to  an  attorney  after  he  received  his 
Miranda  warning,  the  defendant  waived  both 
his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.  Id. at 
81.

conforming changes to 17.032(a). 

Art. 17.033.  RELEASE ON BOND OF CERTAIN 
PERSONS ARRESTED WITHOUT A WARRANT.  
(a) Except  as  provided  by  Subsection  (c),  a
person who is arrested without a warrant and
who  is  detained  in  jail  must  be  released  on
bond,  in  an  amount  not  to  exceed  $5,000,  not
later  than  the  24th  hour  after  the  person's
arrest  if  the  person  was  arrested  for  a
misdemeanor  and  a  magistrate  has  not
determined  whether  probable  cause  exists  to
believe that the person committed the offense.
If the person is unable to obtain a surety for the
bond or unable to deposit money in the amount
of  the  bond,  the  person  must  be  released  on
personal bond.

(b) Except  as  provided  by  Subsection  (c),  a
person who is arrested without a warrant and
who  is  detained  in  jail  must  be  released  on
bond, in an amount not to exceed $10,000, not
later  than  the  48th  hour  after  the  person's
arrest  if  the  person  was  arrested  for  a  felony
and a magistrate has not determined whether
probable cause exists to believe that the person
committed the offense. If the person is unable
to  obtain  a  surety  for  the  bond  or  unable  to
deposit money in the amount of the bond, the
person must be released on personal bond.

(c) On  the  filing  of  an  application  by  the
attorney  representing  the  state,  a  magistrate
may  postpone  the  release  of  a  person  under
Subsection (a), or (b) for not more than 72 hours
after  the  person's  arrest.  An  application  filed
under this subsection must state the reason a
magistrate  has  not  determined  whether
probable cause exists to believe that the person
committed the offense for which the person was
arrested.

(d) The time limits imposed by Subsections (a)
and  (b)  do  not  apply  to  a  person  arrested
without a warrant who is taken to a hospital,
clinic,  or  other  medical  facility  before  being

taken before a magistrate under Article 15.17. 
For a person described by this subsection, the 
time limits imposed by Subsections (a) and (b) 
begin to run at the time, as documented in the 
records of the hospital, clinic, or other medical 
facility,  that  a  physician  or  other  medical 
professional  releases  the  person  from  the 
hospital, clinic, or other medical facility.  

Art. 17.09.  DURATION; ORIGINAL AND 
SUBSEQUENT PROCEEDINGS; NEW BAIL. 

Sec. 1.  Where a defendant, in the course of a 
criminal action, gives bail before any court or 
person authorized by law to take same, for his 
personal  appearance  before  a  court  or 
magistrate,  to  answer  a  charge  against  him, 
the said bond shall be valid and binding upon 
the defendant and his sureties, if any, thereon, 
for the defendant’s personal appearance before 
the court or magistrate designated therein, as 
well  as  before  any  other  court  to  which  same 
may  be  transferred,  and  for  any  and  all 
subsequent  proceedings  had  relative  to  the 
charge,  and  each  such  bond  shall  be  so 
conditioned except as hereinafter provided. 

Sec. 2.  When a defendant has once given bail 
for  his  appearance  in  answer  to  a  criminal 
charge, he shall not be required to give another 
bond in the course of the same criminal action 
except as herein provided. 

Sec.  3.  Provided  that  whenever,  during  the 
course of the action, the judge or magistrate in 
whose  court  such  action  is  pending  finds  that 
the bond is defective, excessive or insufficient 
in amount, or that the sureties, if any, are not 
acceptable, or for any other good and sufficient 
cause, such judge or magistrate may, either in 
term-time or in vacation, order the accused to 
be rearrested, and require the accused to give 
another  bond  in  such  amount  as  the  judge  or 
magistrate may deem proper. When such bond 
is  so  given  and  approved,  the  defendant  shall 
be released from custody. 

Sec.  4.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision 
of this article, the judge or magistrate in whose 
court  a  criminal  action  is  pending  may  not 
order  the  accused  to  be  rearrested  or  require 
the  accused  to  give  another  bond  in  a  higher 
amount because the accused:

Sec.  1.  A  defendant  who  is  detained  in  jail 
pending  trial  of  an  accusation  against  him 
must be released either on personal bond or by 
reducing  the  amount  of  bail  required,  if  the 
state is not ready for trial of the criminal action 
for which he is being detained within: 

(1) 90  days  from  the  commencement  of  his
detention if he is accused of a felony;

(2) 30  days  from  the  commencement  of  his
detention  if  he  is  accused  of  a  misdemeanor
punishable  by  a  sentence  of  imprisonment  in
jail for more than 180 days;

(3) 15  days  from  the  commencement  of  his
detention  if  he  is  accused  of  a  misdemeanor
punishable by a sentence of imprisonment for
180 days or less;  or

(4) five  days  from  the  commencement  of  his
detention  if  he  is  accused  of  a  misdemeanor
punishable by a fine only.

Sec.  2.  The  provisions  of  this  article  do  not 
apply to a defendant who is: 

(1) serving  a  sentence  of  imprisonment  for
another offense while the defendant is serving
that sentence;

(2) being  detained  pending  trial  of  another
accusation  against  the  defendant  as  to  which
the applicable period has not yet elapsed;

(3) incompetent  to  stand  trial,  during  the
period of the defendant's incompetence;  or

(4) being  detained  for  a  violation  of  the
conditions of a previous release related to the
safety of a victim of the alleged offense or to the
safety of the community under this article.

(2) requests  the  assistance  of  counsel,
appointed or retained.

COMMENTARY:    The  primary  purpose  of  an 
appearance bond is securing the appearance of 
the defendant at his trial. Ex parte Vance, 608 
S.W.2d  681,  683  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  1980).  The 
accused’s  ability  to  make  bail  is  not  the  only 
factor  included  in  determining  the  amount  of 
bail;  the  nature  of  the  offenses  will  also  have 
weight in the determination. Id. Although bail 
should  be  high  enough  to  provide  reasonable 
assurance  that  the  undertaking  will  be 
complied  with,  it  should  not  be  used  as  an 
“instrument of oppression.” Id.

(f) In  a  county  with  a  public  defender’s  office,
the  court  or  the  courts'  designee  shall  give
priority  in  appointing  that  office  to  represent
the  defendant  in  the  criminal  proceeding,
including  a  proceeding  in  a  capital  murder
case.  However,  the  court  is  not  required  to
appoint the public defender’s office if:

(1) the court makes a finding of good cause
for appointing other counsel, provided that
in a capital murder case, the court makes a
finding  of  good  cause  on  the  record  for
appointing that counsel;

the appointment would be contrary to
(2)
the  office's  written  plan  under  Article
26.044;

(3) the  office  is  prohibited  from  accepting
the appointment under Article 26.044(j); or

(4) a  managed  assigned  counsel  program
also  exists  in  the  county  and  an  attorney
will be appointed under that program.

(f-1) In a county in which a managed assigned 
counsel program is operated in accordance with 
Article  26.047,  the  managed  assigned  counsel 
program may appoint counsel to represent the 
defendant  in  accordance  with  the  guidelines 
established for the program. 

(g) A  countywide  alternative  program  for
appointing  counsel  for  indigent  defendants  in
criminal cases is established by a formal action
in which two-thirds of the judges of the courts
designated  under  this  subsection  vote  to
establish 
the  alternative  program.  An
alternative  program  for  appointing  counsel  in
misdemeanor  and 
felony  cases  may  be
established  in  the  manner  provided  by  this
subsection by the judges  of the county courts,
statutory  county  courts,  and  district  courts
trying  criminal  cases  in  the  county.  An
alternative  program  for  appointing  counsel  in
misdemeanor cases may be established in the
manner  provided  by  this  subsection  by  the
judges  of  the  county  courts  and  statutory
county  courts  trying  criminal  cases  in  the
county. An alternative program for appointing
counsel  in  felony  cases  may  be  established  in
the manner provided by this subsection by the
judges  of  the  district  courts  trying  criminal
cases  in  the  county.  In  a  county  in  which  an
alternative program is established:

(1) the alternative program may:

(A) use a single method for appointing
counsel  or  a  combination  of  methods;
and

(B) use a multicounty appointment list
using a system of rotation; and

the  procedures 

(2)
Subsection (a) must ensure that:

the  judges  of  the  district  courts
trying felony cases in the county;

(C) appointments  for  defendants  in
capital  cases 
in  which  the  death
penalty  is  sought  comply  with  the
requirements of Article 26.052; and

(D) appointments  are  reasonably  and
impartially  allocated  among  qualified
attorneys.

(h) Subject  to  Subsection  (f),  in  a  county  in
which  an  alternative  program  for  appointing
is  established  as  provided  by
counsel 
Subsection (g) and is approved by the presiding
judge  of  the  administrative  judicial  region,  a
court  or  the  courts'  designee  may  appoint  an
attorney to represent an indigent defendant by
using the alternative program. In establishing
an  alternative  program  under  Subsection  (g),
the  judges  of  the  courts  establishing  the
program may not, without the approval of the
commissioners  court,  obligate  the  county  by
contract or by the creation of new positions that

35 

cause  an  increase  in  expenditure  of  county 
funds. 

(i) Subject  to  Subsection  (f),  a  court  or  the
courts' designee required under Subsection (c)
to appoint an attorney to represent a defendant
accused or convicted of a felony may appoint an
attorney from any county located in the court's
administrative judicial region.

(j) An  attorney  appointed  under  this  article
shall:

(1) make every reasonable effort to contact
the defendant not later than the end of the
first  working  day  after  the  date  on  which
the attorney is appointed and to interview
the defendant as soon as  practicable after
the attorney is appointed;

(2) represent  the  defendant  until  charges
are  dismissed,  the  defendant  is  acquitted,
appeals  are  exhausted,  or  the  attorney  is
permitted  or  ordered  by  the  court  to
withdraw  as  counsel  for  the  defendant
after a finding of good cause is entered on
the record; and

(3) with  respect 
to  a  defendant  not
represented  by  other  counsel,  before
withdrawing  as  counsel  for  the  defendant
after a trial or the entry of a plea of guilty:

(A) advise  the  defendant  of  the
defendant's  right  to  file  a  motion  for
new trial and a notice of appeal;

(B) if  the  defendant  wishes  to  pursue
either  or  both  remedies  described  by
Paragraph (A), assist the defendant in
requesting the prompt appointment of
replacement counsel; and

(C)
if  replacement  counsel  is  not
appointed promptly and the defendant
wishes  to  pursue  an  appeal,  file  a
timely notice of appeal; and

(4) not later  than October 15 of each year
and  on  a  form  prescribed  by  the  Texas
Indigent  Defense  Commission,  submit  to
the  county  information,  for  the  preceding
fiscal year, that describes the percentage of

the  attorney's  practice  time  that  was 
dedicated  to  work  based  on  appointments 
accepted  in  the  county  under  this  article 
and Title 3, Family Code. 

(k) A  court  may  replace  an  attorney  who
violates Subsection (j)(1) with other counsel. A
majority of the judges of the county courts and
statutory  county  courts  or  the  district  courts,
as  appropriate,  trying  criminal  cases  in  the
county  may  remove  from  consideration  for
appointment an attorney who intentionally or
repeatedly violates Subsection (j)(1).

for  determining  whether 

(l) Procedures  adopted  under  Subsection  (a)

standards 
a
defendant  is  indigent.  The  procedures  and
standards shall apply to each defendant in the
county  equally,  regardless  of  whether  the
defendant is in custody or has been released on
bail.

(m) In  determining  whether  a  defendant  is
indigent, the court or the courts' designee may
consider  the  defendant's  income,  source  of
income,  assets,  property  owned,  outstanding
obligations,  necessary  expenses,  the  number
and  ages  of  dependents,  and  spousal  income
that is available to the defendant. The court or
the courts' designee may not consider whether
the  defendant  has  posted  or  is  capable  of
posting bail, except to the extent that it reflects
the  defendant's  financial  circumstances  as
measured  by  the  considerations  listed  in  this
subsection.
(n) A defendant who requests a determination
of indigency and appointment of counsel shall:

(1) complete  under  oath  a  questionnaire
concerning his financial resources;

(2) respond  under oath  to  an  examination
regarding  his  financial  resources  by  the
judge  or  magistrate 
for
determining  whether  the  defendant  is
indigent; or

responsible 

(3) complete the questionnaire and respond
to examination by the judge or magistrate.

(o) Before making a determination of whether
a defendant is indigent, the court shall request

36 

the defendant to sign under oath a statement 
substantially in the following form:  

"On  this  ________  day  of  ____________,  20 
___, I have been advised by the (name of the 
court) Court of my right to representation 
by  counsel  in  connection  with  the  charge 
pending  against  me.  I  certify  that  I  am 
without  means  to  employ  counsel  of  my 
own  choosing  and  I  hereby  request  the 
court to appoint counsel for me. (signature 
of the defendant)" 

(p) A defendant who is determined by the court
to be indigent is presumed to remain indigent
for the remainder of the proceedings in the case
unless  a  material  change  in  the  defendant's
financial  circumstances  occurs.  If  there  is  a

this  article  or  evidence  derived  from  the

except to determine the defendant's indigency
or  to  impeach  the  direct  testimony  of  the
defendant.  This  subsection  does  not  prohibit

Penal Code.

(r) A  court  may  not  threaten  to  arrest  or

COMMENTARY:  The trial court does not have a 
duty under Art. 26.04 to appoint counsel until 
a  defendant  proves  his  indigence.  Gray  v. 
Robinson,  744  S.W.2d  604,  607  (Tex.  Crim. 
App. 1988). In order to make its determination 
of  indigence,  the  trial  court  is  authorized  to 
conduct an evidentiary hearing. Id. 

Whether  a  person  is  indigent  depends  on  the 
context. He is indigent in the appointment-of-
counsel  context  if  he  is  without  the  means  to 
employ  counsel  of  his  own  choosing,  and 
indigent  in  the  appellate-record  context  if  he 
cannot  pay  or  give  security  for  the  appellate 
record. Whitehead v. State, 130 S.W.3d 866, 878 

(Tex. Crim. App. 2004). While the same factors 
are  generally  considered  for  both  of  these 
inquiries,  it  is  possible  for  a  defendant  to  be 
indigent  in  one  context  but  not  the  other.  Id. 
For example, the defendant in Castillo v. State 
managed to retain counsel but could not afford 
a transcription of the court reporter’s notes for 
appeal. 595 S.W.2d 552, 554 (Tex. Crim. App. 
1980).  

The question of indigence for appeal purposes 
is  to  be  determined  at  the  time  of  the  appeal 
and  not  at  the  time  of  trial.  Cardona  v. 
Marshall,  635  S.W.2d  741,  742  (Tex.  Crim. 
App. 1982).  

There are no standards to guide trial judges in 
determining the indigence of a defendant; each 
case must be decided on its own facts. Id. 

 A  defendant  can  establish  a  prima  facie 
showing of indigence on nothing more than his 
own testimony. Tuck v. State, 215 S.W.3d 411, 
417 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). The trial court has 
less  discretion  to  disbelieve  the  defendant’s 
evidence of indigence than it has to disbelieve 
a  defendant’s  sworn  statements  in  other 
contexts.  Compare  Whitehead,  130  S.W.3d  at 
875 ("[T]he trial court does not have the nearly 
unfettered discretion seen in other contexts to 
simply  disbelieve  the  defendant's  evidence  of 
indigence . . . [A] trial court should accept the 
defendant's evidence absent some reason in the 
record for not doing so."), with Ross v. State, 32 
S.W.3d 
(Tex.  Crim.  App. 
2000) (upholding  the  grant  of  a  motion  to 
suppress on grounds that the trial court could 
have  simply  disbelieved  the  State  witness's 
indigence, 
testimony).  When  determining 
judges  should  accept  defendants’  financial 
allegations  made  under  oath  unless  there  is 
“reason 
they  are  untrue  or 
incomplete.” Whitehead, 130 S.W.3d at 876.  If 
such  a  reason  presents  itself,  judges  may 
require  defendants  to  verify  their  claim  with 
supporting documents or disbelieve their claim 
if  there  is  a  reasonable,  articulable  basis  for 
doing so. Id.  

to  believe 

853, 

857 

An  inquiry  into  the  reasonableness  of  the 
defendant’s expenses, in light of the totality of 
his financial situation, is appropriate in order 
to  determine  whether  a  defendant  can  pay  or 

37 

give security for an appellate record. Tuck, 215 
S.W.3d  at  416.  However,  the  fact  that  a 
defendant's  income  is  less  than  his  expenses 
does  not  necessarily  mean  that  his  expenses 
are unreasonable. Id. 

Similarly,  “an individual’s negative net worth 
does  not  necessarily  translate  into  indigence; 
the  real  question  is  whether  the  defendant  is 
capable of paying for legal counsel and for the 
appellate  record.”  Whitehead,  130  S.W.3d  at 
878.  

free  statement  of 

After  alleging  indigence,  a  person  may  not 
transfer his assets while awaiting trial in order 
to  receive  appointment  of  counsel,  a  free 
transcript,  and 
facts. 
Cardona  v.  Marshall,  635  S.W.2d  741,  743 
(Tex. Crim. App. 1982). A defendant, however, 
“should  not  be  denied  appointment  of  counsel 
solely  because  other  members  of  his  family 
have  assets  and  income.”  Id.  at  743  (quoting 
United  States  v.  Rubinson,  543  F.2d  951,  964 
(2nd Cir. 1976)). 

Submitting  an  income  and  expense  summary 
and a net worth statement, along with a signed 
affidavit  attesting  to  the  truth  of  these 
documents,  serves  the  same  purpose  as 
answering  the  questionnaire  required  by  Art. 
26.04(n)(1). Whitehead, 130 S.W.3d. at 877.  

A  trial  judge  is  under  no  duty  to  find  an 
attorney  agreeable  to  the  defendant.  King  v. 
State,  29  S.W.3d  556,  566  (Tex.  Crim.  App. 
2000).  The  right  to  counsel  of  choice  does  not 
extend to indigent defendants. United States v. 
Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. 140, 151 (2006). 

the 

established, 

Once 
attorney-client 
relationship  between  an  accused  and  his 
attorney  should  be  protected  by  the  courts 
regardless of whether the attorney is retained 
or  appointed.  Stearnes  v.  Clinton,  780  S.W.2d 
216, 221–22 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989). When an 
attorney-client relationship is established, the 
trial  judge  may  not  arbitrarily  remove  the 
attorney  over  the  objections  of  both  the 
defendant  and  his  counsel.  Id.  at  221.  There 
must be some principled reason, apparent from 
judge's sua 
the  record,  to 
sponte interference  with  the  attorney-client 
relationship.  Id.  The  same  goes  for  replacing

38 

appointed  trial  counsel  for  appeal.  Buntion  v. 
Harmon, 827 S.W.2d 945, 949 (Tex. Crim. App. 
1992). 

The defendant’s constitutional right to counsel 
terminates if counsel files an Anders brief with 
a motion to withdraw and the appellate court 
agrees that there are no non-frivolous issues to 
be  raised  in  an  appeal.  Meza  v.  State,  206 
S.W.3d  684,  688  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  2006).  The 
appellate  court  should  grant  the  motion  to 
withdraw. Id. If the appellate court finds there 
are plausible grounds for appeal, “the appellate 
court still grants the motion to withdraw, but 
remands  the  cause  to  the  trial  court  for 
appointment of new appellate counsel.” Kelly v. 
State,  436  S.W.3d  313,  318  n.  16  (Tex.  Crim. 
App. 2013) (emphasis in original).

COMMENTARY:  “[A]fter  the  commissioners 
court has established a public defender’s office 
[pursuant to Art. 26.044], it remains obligated 
to  pay  attorneys  appointed  by  trial  courts  to 
represent indigent defendants and must direct 
payment  of  the  full  amount  of  attorney  fees 
ordered by a court under Art. 26.05, unless  it 
can  show  that  the  trial  court’s  award  is  so 
unreasonable  as  to  amount  to  an  abuse  of 
discretion.” Tex. Att’y Gen. LO-97-063 (1997). 

Art. 26.045. PUBLIC DEFENDER OVERSIGHT 
BOARD.   
(a) The commissioners court of a county or the
commissioners  courts  of  two  or  more  counties
may  establish  an  oversight  board  for  a  public

APPOINTED TO DEFEND. 
(a) A  counsel,  other  than  an  attorney  with  a
public  defender’s  office  or  an  attorney

employed  by  the  office  of  capital  and  forensic 
writs, appointed to represent a defendant in a 
criminal proceeding, including a habeas corpus 
hearing, shall  be paid  a reasonable  attorney's 
fee for performing the following services, based 
on the time and labor required, the complexity 
of  the  case,  and  the  experience  and  ability  of 
the appointed counsel: 

time  spent 

(1)
in  court  making  an
appearance  on  behalf  of  the  defendant  as
evidenced by a docket entry, time spent in
trial,  and  time  spent  in  a  proceeding  in
which sworn oral testimony is elicited;

(2) reasonable  and  necessary  time  spent
out of court on the case, supported by any
documentation that the court requires;

of Criminal Appeals; and

(4) preparation of a motion for rehearing.

(b) All payments made under this article shall
be  paid  in  accordance  with  a  schedule  of  fees
adopted  by  formal  action  of  the  judges  of  the
county  courts,  statutory  county  courts,  and
district  courts  trying  criminal  cases  in  each
county.  On  adoption  of  a  schedule  of  fees  as

the  judge  or  director  shall  make  written 
findings  stating  the  amount  of  payment  that 
the judge or director approves and each reason 
for  approving  an  amount  different  from  the

for payment is disapproved or is not otherwise 
acted  on  by  the  60th  day  after  the  date  the 
request  for  payment  is  submitted  may  appeal 
the  disapproval  or  failure  to  act  by  filing  a 
motion  with  the  presiding

later  than  the  45th  day  after  the  date  an 
application  for  payment  of  a  fee  is  submitted 
under  this  article,  the  commissioners  court 
shall pay to the appointed counsel the amount 
that is approved by the presiding judge of the 
administrative  judicial  region  and  that  is  in

shall  order  the  defendant  to  pay  during  the
pendency  of  the  charges  or,  if  convicted,  as  a

finds  the  defendant  is  able  to  pay.  The
defendant  may  not  be  ordered  to  pay  an
amount that exceeds:

and costs, paid by the county for the legal
services provided by an appointed attorney;

COMMENTARY:  “The  state  of  Texas  has  a 
significant  interest  in  assuring  that  persons 
with  the  financial  resources  to  pay  for  their 
own  representation  do  not  take  a  free  ride  at 
the expense of its taxpayers.” Curry v. Wilson, 
853 S.W.2d 40, 46 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993). “It is 
not an inherent violation of due process for the 
State,  [pursuant  to  Art.  26.05(g)],  to  take 
reasonable  steps  to  collect  on  expenditures 
made on behalf of those who have the ability to 
off-set the State’s expenses.” Id.

2010).

Id. at 553 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010)(citing Mayer 
v. State,  274  S.W.3d  898,  901  (Tex.  App.—
Amarillo  2008).  The  courts  of  appeals
frequently modify criminal judgments to delete
attorney fee repayment orders entered without
a  finding,  or  without  evidence  sufficient  to
support a finding, that the defendant is able to
pay. See, e.g., Phelps v. State, 532 S.W.3d 437,
440 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2017, pet. dism’d);
Kirkland v. State, 488 S.W.3d 379 (Tex. App.—

(Tex. Crim. App. 2013). 

a 

A complaint about the sufficiency of evidence of 
an appellant’s financial resources and ability to 
pay are not waived by the appellant’s failure to 
raise the complaint at trial. Mayer, 309 S.W.3d. 
at  556.  Cases  with  claims  of  insufficient 
evidence usually do not get remanded to allow 
for supplements to be added to the record. Id. 
at  557.  The  claims  are  measured  by  “viewing 
all  of  the  record  evidence  in  the  light  most 
favorable to the verdict.” Id.  

Defendants who are ordered to repay attorney 
fees  as  an  obligation  of  a  judgment  imposing 
probation  without  an  ability-to-pay  finding 
must bring their claim in a direct appeal (and 
not  on  appeal  from  a  judgment  revoking 
probation) or risk forfeiture. Wiley v. State, 410 
S.W.3d  313,  318  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  2013).  The 
claim is forfeited if the defendant was aware of 
his obligation to pay the fees but did not bring 
the claim in a direct appeal. Riles v. State, 452 
S.W.3d  333,  337  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  2015). 
However,  when  attorney 
fees  are  only 
conditions  of  community  supervision—not 
independent  obligations  or  court  costs—
payment  of  the  fees  upon  revocation  of 

probation  has  been  overturned.  Summers  v. 
State, 555 S.W.3d 844, 854 (Tex. App..— Waco 
2018, no. pet.). 

The  assessment  of  fees  for  an  appointed 
attorney is not punitive; it does not “alter the 
punishment to which the defendant is subject.” 
Armstrong v. State, 340 S.W.3d 759, 767 (Tex. 
Crim.  App.  2011).  Court  costs  (including 
attorney fees), as reflected in a certified bill of 
costs,  need  neither  be  orally  pronounced  nor 
incorporated by reference in the judgment to be 
effective. Id. at 766. 

The trial court’s determination of a reasonable 
attorney’s  fee  for  appointed  counsel  is  limited 
by the fixed or minimum and maximum hourly 
rates  adopted  by  formal  action  of  the  judges 
within a county. In re State ex rel. Wice v. Fifth 
Judicial  Dist.  Court  of  Appeals,  581  S.W.3d 
189, 192 (Tex. Crim. App. 2018). 

The trial court has the discretion to determine 
the  proper  value  of  the  legal  fees  it  orders  a 
defendant to pay under Art. 26.05(g); however, 
the legal fees must be commensurate with the 
circumstances—like  the  time, 
labor,  and 
experience  of  counsel—in  the  case.  In  re 
Perkins,  512  S.W.3d  424,  432  (Tex.  App.—
Corpus Christi 2016, pet. denied).  

At  a  contempt  proceeding  for  failure  to  pay 
court-ordered attorney fees, “a defendant must 
be informed of his right to representation, and 
if  found  indigent,  his  right  to  appointment  of 
counsel.”  Ex  Parte  Gonzales,  945  S.W.2d  830, 
837  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  1997).  An  indigent 
person’s  court-appointed  attorney  for  a  civil 
contempt proceeding may not be paid from the 
general fund of a county under the authority of 
Art.  26.05.  Tex.  Att’y  Gen.  Op.  No.  JM-403 
(1985).

“[S]tate 
fees  cannot  be 
awarded for services rendered prior to the date 
that  counsel  is  appointed  to  represent  an 
indigent.”  Gray  v.  Robinson,  744  S.W.2d  604, 
607 (Tex. Crim. App. 1988). 

Indigent  defendants  are  “not  automatically 
to  assistance  of  court-appointed 
entitled 

45 

counsel  to  file  a  petition  for  discretionary 
review.” Peterson v. Jones, 894 S.W.2d 370, 373 
(Tex.  Crim.  App.  1995).  There  is  no  statutory 
duty  for  district  judges  to  authorize  payment 
in  filing 
for  attorney  services  performed 
petitions for discretionary review. Id. 

“A court may require a defendant, in an order 
of community supervision, to pay attorney fees 
according  to  the  county’s  schedule  of  fees 
established  under  article  26.05,  regardless  of 
the county commissioners court's contract with 
individual attorneys.” Tex. Att’y Gen. Op. No. 
GA-0884 (2011). 

The trial court retains the discretion to appoint 
an  expert  witness  under  Art.  26.05.  Quin  v. 
State,  608  S.W.2d  937,  938  (Tex.  Crim.  App. 
1980). “Absent a showing of harm, no abuse of 
that  discretion  in  the  refusal  to  appoint  an 
expert witness will be found.” Id.  

privileged 

Article  26.05(c)  requires  that  counsel  for 
indigent  defendants  provide  an  itemized  list 
of  services  performed  to  assess  a  “reasonable 
attorney’s  fee.”  However,  counsel  may  not 
disclose 
information  when 
submitting  itemized  bills.    Morrison  v.  State, 
575  S.W.3d  1,  26  (Tex.  App.  –  Texarkana

rendered  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel 
because  “there  was  no  strategic  reason 
why  .  .  .  defense  counsel  would  ever  disclose 
the  detailed  confidential  communications 
included in his billing records.”)

COMMENTARY:  The  due  process  guarantee  of 
fundamental  fairness  requires  the  state  to 
provide  an  indigent  defendant  with  expert 
assistance  if  such  assistance  is  “likely  to  be  a 
significant  factor  at  trial.”  Ex  parte  Jimenez, 
364  S.W.3d  866,  876  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  2012) 
(quoting Ake v. Okla., 470 U.S. 68, 74 (1985)). 
is  at  once 
“Because  psychiatric  evidence 
esoteric  and  uncertain,  the  indigent  accused 
needs  a  psychiatrist  .  .  .  to  provide  technical 
assistance to the accused, to help evaluate the 
strength of his defense, to offer his own expert 
diagnosis  at  trial  if  it  is  favorable  to  that 
defense, and to identify the weaknesses in the 
State's case, if any, by testifying himself and/or 
preparing  counsel  to  cross-examine  opposing 
experts.”  De  Freece  v.  State,  848  S.W.  2d  150, 
159  n.7  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  1993).  A  neutral 

49 

expert or “court’s expert” is insufficient to meet 
this  burden  because,  inter  alia,  a  neutral 
expert  is  not  subject  to  the  attorney-client 
privilege. See id. at 159, n. 8. 

toward  defending  a  child  committed  to  the 
school  from  another  county  who  is  being 
prosecuted for a felony or misdemeanor in the 
county where the training school is located. 

The right to expert assistance has its limits: an 
indigent defendant is not guaranteed the same 
quality  and  quantity  of  assistance  that  non-
indigent  defendants  may  purchase.  Jimenez, 
364 S.W.3d at 876-77. Neither is he entitled to 
select  an  expert  based  on  his  own  personal 
preference  or  one  who  will  agree  with  his 
defense theory. Id at 877. “But if the defendant 
makes  a  sufficient  threshold  showing  of  the 
need for expert assistance on a particular issue, 
the  defendant  is  entitled  to  access  to  at  least 
one expert” to assist the defendant’s counsel in 
presenting  his  defense  in  the  best  possible 
light. Id. 

In  order  to  receive  expert  assistance,  an 
indigent  defendant  must  provide  concrete 
reasons  for  requiring  the  appointment  of  a 
particular  expert  rather  than  simply  stating 
that  an  appointment  would  be  advantageous. 
Id.  at  877-78  (citing  Caldwell  v.  Mississippi, 
472 U.S. 320, 323 n.1 (1985)). A trial judge does 
not  err  in  denying  funds  for  an  appointed 
expert  when  defense  neglects  to  provide  the 
name  of  the  requested  expert  and  the 
particulars required by 26.052(f). Id. at 878. 

A 
failure  to  comply  with  Art.  26.052’s 
procedures  is  susceptible  to  a  harmless  error 
analysis pursuant to Tex. R. App. Pro 44.2(b). 
Hughes v. State, 24 S.W.3d 833, 837 (Tex. Crim. 
App.),  (upholding  capital  murder  conviction 
where district clerk’s office failed to post list of 
capital-murder-qualified  attorneys  but  the 
attorneys  appointed  were  qualified).  “Failure 
to  adhere  to  statutory  procedures  serving  to 
protect a constitutional provision is a violation 
of  the  statute,  not  a  violation  of  the 
constitutional provision itself.” Id. at n. 2. 

Art. 26.056.  CONTRIBUTION FROM STATE IN 
CERTAIN COUNTIES. 

Sec. 1. 
A  county  in  which  a  state  training  school  for 
delinquent children is located shall pay from its 
general fund the first $250 of fees awarded for 
court-appointed  counsel  under  Article  26.05 

50 

Sec. 2. 
If  the  fees  awarded  for  counsel  compensation 
are in excess of $250, the court shall certify the 
amount in excess of $250 to the Comptroller of 
Public  Accounts  of  the  State  of  Texas.  The 
Comptroller shall issue a warrant to the court-
appointed  counsel  in  the  amount  certified  to 
the comptroller by the court.  

Art. 26.057.  COST OF EMPLOYMENT OF 
COUNSEL FOR CERTAIN MINORS. 
If a juvenile has been transferred to a criminal 
court under Section 54.02, Family Code, and if 
a court appoints counsel for the juvenile under 
Article 26.04 of this code, the county that pays 
for the counsel has a cause of action against a 
parent  or  other  person  who  is  responsible  for 
the  support  of  the  juvenile  and  is  financially 
able  to  employ  counsel  for  the  juvenile  but 
refuses to do so. The county may recover its cost 
of payment to the appointed counsel and may 
recover  attorney's  fees  necessary  to  prosecute 
the cause of action against the parent or other 
person. 

Art. 26.06.  ELECTED OFFICIALS NOT TO BE 
APPOINTED. 
No  court  may  appoint  an  elected  county, 
district  or  state  official  to  represent  a  person 
accused of crime, unless the official has notified 
the court of his availability for appointment. If 
an  official  has  notified  the  court  of  his 
availability  and  is  appointed  as  counsel,  he 
may decline the appointment if he determines 
that it is in the best interest of his office to do 
so.  Nothing  in  this  Code  shall  modify  any 
statutory provision for legislative continuance.

27.16(a),  a  court  shall  inquire  on  the  record 
whether the defendant has sufficient resources 
or income to immediately pay all or part of the 
fine and costs.  If the court determines that the 
defendant does not have sufficient resources or 
income  to  immediately  pay  all  or  part  of  the 
fine  and  costs,  the  court  shall  determine 
whether the fine and costs should be: 

(1) subject to Subsection (c), required to
be paid at some later date or in a specified
portion at designated intervals;

(2) discharged by performing community

described by Subsection (b).

(e) The election under Subsection (d) must be
made in writing, signed by the defendant, and,
if  present,  signed  by  the  defendant's  parent,
guardian, or managing conservator.  The court
shall maintain the written election as a record
of  the  court  and  provide  a  copy  to  the

2021  LEGISLATIVE  NOTE:  SB  1373  amends 
42.15(a-1)  to  require  judges  to  inquire  on  the 
record about a defendant’s ability to pay.  The 
goal of this change is to close a loophole which 
allowed courts of appeal to assume an inquiry 
into a defendant’s ability to pay occurred when 
it may not have.

from  42A.301(b)  authorizing  conditions  of 
community  supervision  to  include  conditions 
requiring  the  defendant  to  avoid  persons  or 
places  of  disreputable  or  harmful  character, 
including  any  person,  other  than  a  family 
member  of  the  defendant,  who  is  an  active 
member  of  a  criminal  street  gang.  These

(a) If the defendant notifies the court that the 
defendant  has  difficulty  paying  the  fine  and

may notify the court by:

(1) voluntarily  appearing  and  informing 
the  court  or  the  clerk  of  the  court  in  the 
manner  established  by  the  court  for  that 
purpose;

(2) filing a motion with the court;

hearing that:

(A) the  applicable  portion  of  the
judgment  imposes  an  undue  hardship
on the defendant; and

(B) the  fine  and  costs  should  be
satisfied through one or more methods
listed under Article 42.15(a-1).

(e) The  court  retains 
jurisdiction  for  the
purpose of making a determination under this
article.

Art. 43.091. WAIVER OF PAYMENT OF FINES 
AND COSTS FOR CERTAIN DEFENDANTS AND 
FOR CHILDREN.  
(a) A court may waive payment of all or part of
a  fine  imposed  on  a  defendant  if  the  court
determines that:

(1)
the  defendant  is  indigent  or  does  not
have sufficient resources or income to pay
all or part of the fine or was, at the time the
offense  was  committed,  a  child  as  defined
by Article 45.058(h); and

(2) each alternative method of discharging
the fine under Article 43.09 or 42.15 would
impose  an  undue  hardship  on 
the
defendant.

(b) A  determination  of  undue  hardship  made
under  Subsection  (a)(2)  is  in  the  court's
discretion.  In making that determination, the
the
court  may  consider,  as  applicable, 
defendant's:

(1) significant 
impairment or disability;

physical 

or  mental

(2) pregnancy and childbirth;

(3) substantial  family  commitments  or
or
responsibilities,

including 

child 

(4) work responsibilities and hours;

(5) transportation limitations;

(6) homelessness  or  housing  insecurity;
and

(7) any  other  factor  the  court  determines
relevant.

(c) A court may waive payment of all or part of
the  costs  imposed  on  a  defendant  if  the  court
determines that the defendant:

(1) is  indigent  or  does  not  have  sufficient
resources or income to pay all or part of the
costs; or

(2) was,  at  the  time  the  offense  was
committed,  a  child  as  defined  by  Article
45.058(h).

(d) This subsection applies only to a defendant
placed  on  community  supervision,  including
deferred  adjudication  community  supervision,
whose fine or costs are wholly or partly waived
under  this  article.    At  any  time  during  the
defendant's  period  of  community  supervision,
the  court,  on  the  court's  own  motion  or  by
motion of the attorney representing the state,
may reconsider the waiver of the fine or costs.
After providing written notice to the defendant
and  an  opportunity  for  the  defendant  to
present information relevant to the defendant's
ability  to  pay,  the  court  may  order  the
defendant  to  pay  all  or  part  of  the  waived
amount  of  the  fine  or  costs  only  if  the  court

CHAPTER 64. MOTION FOR FORENSIC DNA 
TESTING 
 

Art. 64.01. Motion 
(a) In this section, “biological material”: 
 

(1) means an item that is in possession of 
the  state  and  that  contains  blood,  semen, 
hair, saliva, skin tissues or cells, fingernail 
scrapings,  bone,  bodily  fluids,  or  other 
identifiable biological evidence that may be 
suitable for forensic DNA testing; and  

2) includes the contents of a sexual assault 
evidence collection kit 

a-1)  A  convicted  person  may  submit  to  the 
convicting  court  a  motion  for  forensic  DNA 
testing  of  evidence  that  has  a  reasonable 
likelihood  of  containing  biological  material. 
The  motion  must  be  accompanied  by  an 
affidavit,  sworn  to  by  the  convicted  person, 
containing statements of  fat in  support of the 
motion. 

b)  The  motion  may  request  forensic  DNA 
testing  only  of  evidence  described 
iby 
Subsection (a-1) that was secured in relation ot 
the offense that is  the basis of the challenged 
conviction  and  was  in  the  possession  of  the 
state during the trial of the offense, but:  
 

(1)  was  not  previously  subjected  to  DNA 
testing; or  

  (

  (

2)  although  previously  subjected  to  DNA 
testing: 
 

(A) can be subjected to testing with new 
testing  techniques  that  provide  a 
reasonable  likelihood  of  results  that 
are  more  accurate  and  probative  than 
the results of the previous tests; or  

(i)  at  a  laboratory  that  ceased 
conducting  DNA  testing  after  an 
audit by the Texas Forensic Science 

B) was tested:

CR, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 10002, 2 (Tex. App. 
– Amarillo Nov. 16, 2006).  

The  alleged  invalidity  of  the  warrant  or  the 
failure to allow counsel to be present during the 
original  testing  are  not  grounds  for  seeking 
retesting of biological material under Chapter 
64.  Dukes  v.  State,  No.  04-12-00404-CR,  2013 
Tex.  Appl.  LEXIS  5002,  6  (Tex.  App.  –  San 
Antonio Apr. 24, 2013).  

ailure by counsel to seek DNA testing during 
trial does not guarantee that a request for DNA 
testing will be granted under Rule 64. Failure 
to  seek  DNA  testing  during  trial  can  be 
evidence  of  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel.  
This  is  because  trial  counsel  could  decline  to 
seek  testing  "as  a  matter  of  reasonable  trial 
strategy"  and  so  post-rial  testing  is  not 
“required by the interests of justice.” Skinner v. 
State,  293  S.W.3d  196,  202  (Tex.  Crim.  App. 
2009) 

  court’s  decision  to  deny  appointed  counsel 
under  Art.  64  is  not  an  “appealable  order” 
because  “a  motion  for  appointed  counsel  is  a 
preliminary matter that precedes the initiation 
of Chapter 64 proceedings.” Gutierrez v. State, 
307 S.W.3d 318, 323 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). To 
appeal a decision denying counsel, an applicant 
must “file a motion for DNA testing and, if and 
when the motion is denied, appeal any alleged 
error  made  by  the  trial  judge  in  refusing  to 
appoint counsel.” Id.  

rt.  64.011.  Guardians  and  Other 

Representatives 

a)  In  this  chapter,  “guardian  of  a  convicted 
person”  means  a  person  who  is  the  legal 
guardian of the convicted person, whether the 
legal  relationship  between  the  guardian  and 
convicted  person  exists  because  of  the  age  of 
the convicted person or because of the physical 
or  mental  incompetency  of  the  convicted 
person.  

b)  A  guardian  of  a  convicted  person  may 
submit motions for the convicted person under

was amended effective September 1, 2003, “an 
indigent  person  seeking  DNA  testing 
is 
entitled  to  appointed  counsel  only  if  the  trial 
court  finds  reasonable  grounds  for  a  testing 
motion  to  be  filed.”  In  re  Turner,  No.  03-11-
00177-CV, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 2658, 1 (Tex. 
App. – Austin Apr. 8, 2011).  

he amended statute requires “only a showing 
of “reasonable grounds” for a motion to be filed, 
not  the  establishment  of  a  “prima  facie”  case. 
Lewis v. State, 191 S.W.3d 225, 227 (Tex. App. 
– San Antonio Dec. 28, 2005). Under the facts 
in  Lewis,  the  applicant’s  request  for  counsel 
was denied because he failed to show that the 
evidence  in  question  “still  exists]”  and  that 
“identity was or is an issue in the case”. Id. at 
228. 

rt.  64  does  not  define  “reasonable  grounds.” 
However,  courts  have  found  that  reasonable 
grounds  for  testing  are  not  present  “if  no 
biological  evidence  exists  or  if  it  has  been 
destroyed,  or  if  identity  was  not  or  is  not  an 
issue.”  337  S.W.3d  at  891.  Additionally,  the 
DNA test must “affirmatively cast doubt upon 
the  validity  of  the  inmate’s  conviction.”  Id.  at 
892. So, if a favorable result for the applicant 
would  not  change  the  outcome  of  the  trial, 
“there are no reasonable grounds to appoint an 
attorney.”  Id.  Conversely,  reasonable  grounds 
are  present  “when  the  facts  stated  in  the 
request for counsel or otherwise known to the 
convicting  court  reasonably  suggest  that  a 
“valid” or “viable” argument for testing can be 
made. Id. at 891.    

[A]n  indigent  inmate  need  not  prove  his 
entitlement  to  testing  as  a  precondition  for 
obtaining  appointed  counsel  to  assist  him  in 
filing a testing motion . . . reasonable grounds 
for a testing motion are present when the facts 
stated  in  the  request  for  counsel  or  otherwise 
known  to  the  trial  court  reasonably  suggest 
that  a  plausible  argument  for  testing  can  be 
made.”  In  re  Franklin,  No.  03-07-00563-CR, 
2008  Tex.  App.  LEXIS  4545,  7  (Tex.  App.  –

ec. 51.101.  APPOINTMENT OF ATTORNEY 
AND CONTINUATION OF REPRESENTATION. 
(a)  If  an  attorney  is  appointed  under  Section 
54.01(b-1)  or  (d)  to  represent  a  child  at  the 
initial  detention  hearing  and  the  child  is 
detained,  the  attorney  shall  continue  to 
represent the child until the case is terminated, 
the  family  retains  an  attorney,  or  a  new 
attorney  is  appointed  by  the  juvenile  court. 
Release  of  the  child  from  detention  does  not 
terminate the attorney's representation.  

(b)  If  there  is  an  initial  detention  hearing 
without an attorney and the child is detained, 
the attorney appointed under Section 51.10(c) 
shall continue to represent the child until the 
case  is  terminated,  the  family  retains  an 
attorney, or a new attorney is appointed by the 
juvenile  court.  Release  of  the  child  from 
detention  does  not  terminate  the  attorney's 
representation.  

(c)  The  juvenile  court  shall  determine,  on  the 
filing of a petition, whether the child's family is 
indigent if: (1) the child is released by intake; 
(2) the child is released at the initial detention 
hearing;  or  (3)  the  case  was  referred  to  the 
court without the child in custody.  

(d)  A  juvenile  court  that  makes  a  finding  of 
indigence under Subsection (c) shall appoint an 
attorney to represent the child on or before the 
fifth working day after the date the petition for 
adjudication or discretionary transfer hearing 
was served on the child. An attorney appointed 
under  this  subsection  shall  continue  to 
represent the child until the case is terminated, 
the  family  retains  an  attorney,  or  a  new 
attorney is appointed by the juvenile court.

CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR: JUDICIAL
PROCEEDINGS 

Sec. 54.01.  DETENTION HEARING.  
(a) Except as provided by Subsection (p), if the
child  is  not  released  under  Section  53.02,  a
detention hearing without a jury shall be held
promptly,  but  not  later  than  the  second
working  day  after  the  child  is  taken  into
custody; provided, however, that when a child
is detained on a Friday or Saturday, then such
detention  hearing  shall  be  held  on  the  first
working  day  after  the  child  is  taken  into
custody.

(b) Reasonable notice of the detention hearing,
either  oral  or  written,  shall  be  given,  stating
the  time,  place,  and  purpose  of  the  hearing.
Notice  shall  be  given  to  the  child  and,  if  they
can  be  found,  to  his  parents,  guardian,  or
custodian.  Prior  to  the  commencement  of  the
hearing,  the  court  shall  inform  the  parties  of
the  child's  right  to  counsel  and  to  appointed
counsel  if  they  are  indigent  and  of  the  child's
right  to  remain  silent  with  respect  to  any
allegations  of  delinquent  conduct,  conduct
indicating  a  need  for  supervision,  or  conduct
that violates an order of probation imposed by
a juvenile court.

(c) At  the  detention  hearing,  the  court  may
from  probation
consider  written  reports 
officers, 
employees,
guardians  ad  litem  appointed  under  Section
51.11(d),  or  professional 
in
addition to the testimony of witnesses. Prior to
the detention hearing,  the court shall provide
the  attorney  for  the  child  with  access  to  all
written matter to be considered by the court in
making the detention decision. The court may
order counsel not to reveal items to the child or
the child’s his parent, guardian, or guardian ad
litem if such disclosure would materially harm
the treatment and rehabilitation of the child or
would substantially decrease  the likelihood of
receiving information from the same or similar
sources in the future.

(d) A  detention  hearing  may  be  held  without
the presence of the child's parents if the court
has been unable to locate them. If no parent or
guardian  is  present,  the  court  shall  appoint
counsel  or  a  guardian  ad  litem  for  the  child,
subject to the requirements of Subsection (b-1).

(e) At  the  conclusion  of  the  hearing,  the  court
shall  order  the  child  released  from  detention
unless it finds that:

(1) he  is  likely  to  abscond  or  be  removed
from the jurisdiction of the court;

(2) suitable supervision, care, or protection
for him is not being provided by a parent,
guardian, custodian, or other person;

(3) he has no parent, guardian, custodian,
or  other  person  able  to  return  him  to  the
court when required;

(4) he may be dangerous to himself or may
threaten the safety of the public if released;
or

detention hearing; 

B) an  allegation  by 
the  person 
detaining  the  child  that  the  child  has 
left  his  place  of  residence  in  another 
state  or  country  or  another  county  of 
this state, that he is in need of shelter, 
and  that  an  effort  is  being  made  to

residence; and

of this section; and

3) the  request  is  signed  by  the  juvenile 
court  judge  to  evidence  his  knowledge  of 
the  fact  that  the  child  is  being  held  in 
detention. 
 

(j) The  request  for  shelter  may  be  revoked  by 
the child at any time, and on such revocation, 
if  further  detention  is  necessary,  a  detention 
hearing  shall  be  held  not  later  than  the  next 
working day in accordance with Subsections (a) 
through (g) of this section. 

(k) Notwithstanding  anything  in  this  title  to 
the contrary, the child may sign a request for 
shelter  without  the  concurrence  of  an  adult 
specified in Section 51.09 of this code. 

l) The juvenile board may appoint a referee to 
conduct  the  detention  hearing.  The  referee 
shall be an attorney licensed to practice law in 
this  state.  Such  payment  or  additional 
payment  as  may  be  warranted  for  referee 
services  shall  be  provided  from  county  funds. 
Before commencing the detention hearing, the 
referee  shall  inform  the  parties  who  have 
appeared  that  they  are  entitled  to  have  the 
hearing  before  the  juvenile  court  judge  or  a 
substitute judge authorized by Section 51.04(f). 
If a party objects to the referee conducting the 
detention  hearing,  an  authorized  judge  shall

release must be in writing and a copy furnished 
to  the  child.  In  a  county  with  a  population 
greater than 125,000, if a child being released 
under  this  section  is  expelled  under  Section 
37.007,  Education  Code,  the  release  shall  be 
conditioned on the child's attending a juvenile 
justice alternative education program pending 
formal  court 
a  deferred  prosecution  or 
disposition of the child's case. 

(g) No  statement  made  by  the  child  at  the 
detention  hearing  shall  be  admissible  against 
the child at any other hearing. 

(h) A detention order extends to the conclusion 
of the disposition hearing, if there is one, but in 
no  event  for  more  than  10  working  days. 
Further  detention  orders  may  be  made 
following  subsequent  detention  hearings.  The 
initial detention hearing may not be waived but 
subsequent detention hearings may be waived 
in accordance with the requirements of Section 
51.09.  Each  subsequent  detention  order  shall 
extend  for  no  more  than  10  working  days, 
except  that  in  a  county  that  does  not  have  a 
facility,  as 
certified 
described  by  Section  51.12(a)(3), 
each 
subsequent detention order shall extend for no 
more than 15 working days.

substitute  judge  shall  adopt,  modify,  or  reject 
the  referee's  recommendations  not  later  than 
the  next  working  day  after  the  day  that  the 
judge receives the recommendations. Failure to 
act  within  that  time  results  in  release  of  the 
child  by  operation  of  law.  A  recommendation 
that the child be released operates to secure the 
child's immediate release, subject to the power 
of the juvenile court judge or substitute judge 
to  reject  or  modify  that  recommendation.  The 
effect  of  an  order  detaining  a  child  shall  be 
computed from the time of the hearing before 
the referee. 

(m) The  detention  hearing  required  in  this
section  may  be  held  in  the  county  of  the
designated place of detention where the child is
being held even though the designated place of
detention is outside the county of residence of
the  child  or  the  county  in  which  the  alleged
delinquent conduct, conduct indicating a need
for supervision, or probation violation occurred.

(n) An  attorney  appointed  by  the  court  under
Section  51.10(c)  because  a  determination  was
made under this section to detain a child who
was  not  represented  by  an  attorney  may
request on behalf of the child and is entitled to
a de novo detention hearing under this section.
The attorney must make the request not later
than  the  10th  working  day  after  the  date  the
attorney  is  appointed.  The  hearing  must  take
place  not  later  than  the  second  working  day
after  the  date  the  attorney  filed  a  formal
request with the court for a hearing.

(o) The  court  or  referee  shall  find  whether
there is probable cause to believe that a child
taken  into  custody  without  an  arrest  warrant
or  a  directive  to  apprehend  has  engaged  in
delinquent conduct, conduct indicating a need
for  supervision,  or  conduct  that  violates  an
order of probation imposed by a juvenile court.
The  court  or  referee  must  make  the  finding
within  48  hours,  including  weekends  and
holidays, of the  time the  child was taken into
custody.  The  court  or  referee  may  make  the
finding on any reasonably reliable information
that
without  regard 

to  admissibility  of 

the  Texas  Rules  of 
information  under 
Evidence.  A  finding  of  probable  cause  is 
required to detain  a child after the  48th hour 
after the time the child was taken into custody. 
If  a  court  or  referee  finds  probable  cause, 
additional  findings  of  probable  cause  are  not 
required in the same cause to authorize further 
detention. 

(p) If a child is detained in a county jail or other
facility as provided by Section 51.12(l) and the
child  is  not  released  under  Section  53.02(f),  a
detention hearing without a jury shall be held
promptly,  but  not  later  than  the  24th  hour,
excluding  weekends  and  holidays,  after  the
time the child is taken into custody.

(q) If  a  child  has  not  been  released  under
Section 53.02 or this section and a petition has
not  been  filed  under  Section  53.04  or  54.05
concerning the child, the court shall order the
child released from detention not later than:

(1) the 30th working day after the date the
initial detention hearing is held, if the child
is  alleged  to  have  engaged  in  conduct
constituting a capital felony, an aggravated
controlled  substance  felony,  or  a  felony  of
the first degree; or

(2) the 15th working day after the date the
initial detention hearing is held, if the child
is  alleged  to  have  engaged  in  conduct
constituting  an  offense  other  than  an
offense listed in Subdivision (1) or conduct
that violates an order of probation imposed
by a juvenile court.

(q-1) The juvenile board may impose an earlier 
deadline than the specified deadlines for filing 
petitions under Subsection (q) and may specify 
the consequences of not filing a petition by the 
has 
deadline 
established. The juvenile board may authorize 
but not require the juvenile court to release a 
respondent  from  detention  for  failure  of  the 
prosecutor  to  file  a  petition  by  the  juvenile 
board's deadline.

COMMENTARY: 

Rule  174.28(c)(4)(B)  was  amended  in  2020  to 
clarify how it is determined if a jurisdiction is 
meeting  the  prompt  appointment  of  counsel 
requirement. As amended, the requirement is 
met  when  at  least  90%  of  appointments  of 
counsel or denials of indigence determinations 
are  timely,  rather  than  the  determination 
being  based  solely  on  when 
indigence 
determinations are made.  

Rule 1728(c)(6) was amended in 2020 to change 
the section heading from "Payment Process" to 
"Data  Reporting"  to more  accurately  describe 
the processes under review.   

Rule  1728(d)(1)-(5) was  amended  in  2020  to 
clarify  that  the  Commission  will,  for  full  and 
limited  scope  reviews,  issue  a  report  and 
require  a  response  to  noncompliance  findings 
from local officials and, for drop-in visits, may 
write  a  letter  with  recommendations  and 
without requiring a response.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
