Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)8/3/2022  8:09:55AM234 Fourteenth Court of Appeals District, Houston88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's StatementCOURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTEENTH DISTRICT OF TEXASTexas’ intermediate appellate courts have weathered serious challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 ransomware attack, but these challenges will continue into the foreseeable future. The courts have not been fully funded since 2015 yet have dutifully risen to the task as can be seen by the dramatic decline in the number of cases pending in the courts of appeals. Respectfully, additional funding is now necessary to ensure the efficient administration of justice going forward.The core function of Texas intermediate appellate courts is to process, review, and decide by written opinion appeals from trial courts in civil and criminal cases. Population growth across the State and the magnitude of annual case filings, in concert with an ever-increasing number of case types requiring expedited review, make clear that the courts of appeals need sufficient resources to manage their busy dockets and provide the high quality of justice to which the citizens of Texas are entitled. Although case filings decreased in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic, filings have, unsurprisingly, returned to pre-pandemic levels as of June 2022 and are expected to continue to increase as trial courts resume full operations. The Annual Statistical Report for 2021 reported that family violence cases increased at the highest rate over the past five years. We anticipate a rise in other types of litigation as well that will result in a surge of appeals over the next biennium. The courts of appeals, collectively, began in the 79th and 80th Legislative Sessions to work toward a zero-based budget model referred to as Similar Funding for Same-Sized Courts. This budget model quantified the funding required to meet the personnel and operational needs of the courts, thus enabling the courts to accomplish their core function and meet their performance measures. The Similar Funding for Same-Sized Courts initiative was fully funded in 2015, and the courts have been operating under this zero-based budget model since that time. Since the development of the budget model in approximately 2005, the demands of the core function of the courts have required higher-skilled and higher-salary positions. The prior model used salary classification levels for attorneys and staff that are now outdated. Additionally, operating costs for necessary resources such as Westlaw/LexisNexis and other administrative needs have increased dramatically. Further, considering recent attacks on judges and an increase in mass shootings, more funds are needed to provide adequate security at the courts.Prior to the 87th Legislative Session, in early 2020, the Council of Chiefs revised the data in the budget model to reflect the increased funding needed to optimally operate the fourteen courts. However, in preparing for the impending session, the Council was keenly aware that the need for state funds to address the pandemic was the highest priority. Because there were many uncertainties regarding the state of the economy and it was anticipated state revenues would be limited, agencies were asked to reduce budgets by 5%. The Council appreciated and respected the position of the state and, therefore, did not seek additional funding at that time. While the Council greatly appreciates that budgets of the courts of appeals in the last biennium were not cut, funding of the updated budget model is, nonetheless, now necessary. Accordingly, the budget model data has been further updated to reflect current operating needs.Since 1983, the work of the intermediate courts of appeals has been accomplished by 80 justices statewide. In that time, the population of Texas has nearly doubled. A key component to handling the ever-increasing workload without additional justices has been the employment of a highly skilled and trained professional workforce, including appellate lawyers and clerical staff, who assist the justices in processing complex cases, researching and drafting orders and opinions, disposing of voluminous motions, and managing accelerated and emergency matters. Appellate work requires specialized knowledge and significant experience, and the courts constantly face competition from higher-paying private practice and government legal jobs for skilled attorneys and staff. Specialized technological skills are also necessary to understand and operate the complex case management system currently used by the courts. Transitioning to a new case management system in the next biennium will also require special skills. Hiring and retaining qualified support staff is critical to the courts’ ability to manage their dockets and efficiently resolve the cases before them. Page 1 of 3Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)8/3/2022  8:09:55AM234 Fourteenth Court of Appeals District, Houston88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's StatementFunding for all fourteen courts of appeals comprises merely 0.035% of the State budget as a whole. Yet, on average, 96.5% of each appellate court’s budget is dedicated to salaries and benefits. Without additional funding, appellate courts will be unable to attract and retain the highly trained and skilled support staff with the specialized knowledge and relevant experience critical to the courts’ function. Without sufficient qualified staff, courts cannot comply with Legislative mandates to give accelerated and preferential treatment to certain appeals, such as parental-termination and juvenile-certification appeals under the Family Code, mental-health appeals under the Health and Safety Code, and interlocutory appeals under the Civil Practice and Remedies Code.All fourteen courts of appeals continue to expend resources to recover from the 2020 ransomware attack on the courts’ computer systems. The loss of data overall was substantial and continues to require resources to reconstitute work that could not be recovered. And while all State agencies experienced the negative effects of COVID-19, the combined effects of the ransomware attack plus COVID-19 created a unique hardship for the appellate courts.EXCEPTIONAL ITEM #1: INCREASE THE GENERAL REVENUE LIMIT TO MEET THE UPDATED BUDGET MODELThe updated budget model reflects increased funding to permit the courts to attract and retain experienced lawyers and support staff with the requisite knowledge and skills to assist the courts in meeting their performance measures and fulfilling the core function of timely processing and disposing of appeals. Without an increase in funding, appellate courts will lose talented personnel to higher-paying private jobs. This loss of key personnel will detrimentally effect performance standards, including (1) a reduction in overall dispositions of appeals, preventing the courts from clearing older cases and reaching the disposition target of 100% of new appeals filed in the biennium, and (2) an increase in the time from filing until disposition for those appeals which remain pending. Any unnecessary delay will be particularly devastating to the State by creating significant adverse consequences for the businesses, families, and children in Texas that are awaiting justice through the resolution of their disputes. Note, the updated budget model does not include an adjustment for the impact of inflation.EXCEPTIONAL ITEM #2: JUDICIARY-WIDE INFLATION RELIEFAttorneys and staff of the courts of appeals have been impacted in many ways by increasing costs due to inflation. The impact has been devastating for many because the State has not given them a meaningful raise in a significant period of time. Their buying power for goods and services has diminished and, at some courts, has resulted in attrition by those seeking higher-paying jobs. If salaries are not increased, the courts risk losing more personnel that will be costly to replace. Training takes time and will impact the ability of the courts to meet the current and expected demands as we navigate the post-pandemic surge.On May 4, 2022, the Council of Chiefs submitted written testimony to the Senate Committee on Finance comprised of testimonials from court personnel describing personal experiences with rising costs. The Council asks for consideration of this testimony.The courts of appeals join in the judiciary-wide inflation relief for non-judicial employees sought by Article IV courts and agencies. Respectfully, a ten percent (10%) increase on the budget model salaries is sought to help absorb the impact of inflation. To maintain the Similar Funding for Same-Sized Courts model that has worked exceptionally well for years, the requested percentage must be based on the budget model salaries. This exceptional item is not duplicative of exceptional item 1, which does not include an adjustment for the inflation that is expected to persist for some time to come.EXCEPTIONAL ITEM #3: JUDICIAL PAY INCREASE DUE TO CHANGE IN TENUREFive number of Justices will merit an increase in judicial pay due to reaching the next tier as provided in Texas Government Code section 659.012. Page 2 of 3Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)8/3/2022  8:09:55AM234 Fourteenth Court of Appeals District, Houston88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's StatementRIDER REQUESTS:The courts of appeals also request the following with regard to the across-the-board riders found in Article IV (p. IV-38):1. Retain Article IV rider, Sec. 3, Appellate Court Exemptions2. Retain Article IV rider, Sec. 5, Interagency Contracts for Assigned Judges for Appellate Courts3. Retain Article IV rider, Sec. 6, Appellate Court Transfer AuthorityHistorically, the Legislature has granted the courts exemption from certain limitations in the General Appropriations Act. They have also granted the courts the authority to carry over unexpended budget balances between years within the biennium. The flexibility afforded by these measures enhances the courts’ management ability, and we seek continuation of these budget features.ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS OF SUPPORT:In order for the courts of appeals to function efficiently, it is vital that the Office of Court Administration (OCA) be adequately funded.  The courts of appeals rely on many of the services provided by OCA and, therefore, the courts of appeals fully support the exceptional items the OCA requests as part of its funding. More specifically, the courts of appeals strongly support the request for funding related to the acquisition of a new appellate case management system to replace the current system known as TAMES as well as a case-level data system.If the Legislature appropriates a cost-of-living increase to state employees, the courts of appeals request that all court employees be included in any such cost-of-living increase.   Finally, the courts of appeals wish to express appreciation to and support for the Judicial Compensation Commission and the Legislature’s efforts to strengthen the justice system by increasing judicial salaries to attract and retain a strong judiciary.  The courts of appeals request the Legislature implement the Judicial Compensation Commission’s recommendations for an increase in judicial compensation.Note: on Appropriated Receipts – At the direction of the LBB & Governor’s Office, this Court has included appropriated receipts in the amount of $15,607 reflecting reimbursement for copies of opinions and other court documents.  These amounts are merely an offset for additional expenses incurred by the Court and do not constitute additional funds available for general expenditures for the Court.  The amount can vary significantly from year to year Page 3 of 3Organizational Chart

This court has intermediate appellate jurisdiction in civil cases in which the judgment rendered exceeds $100, exclusive of costs, and, effective September 1, 1981, in criminal cases, except those in which the death penalty has been assessed.In FY2019 Strategy A.1.2. was requested and approved to be part of the GAA in FY2020 separating out Judicial Salaries, therefore the 0573 fund in now reflected in Strategy A.1.2.Courts of Appeals are by nature, small agencies with highly specialized staff . The main factor which drives this strategy is the need to attract and retain highly trained and knowledgeable professional staff to work on an increasing caseload.EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS  IMPACTING STRATEGY:STRATEGY BIENNIAL TOTAL - ALL FUNDSBase Spending (Est 2022 + Bud 2023)     Baseline Request (BL 2024 + BL 2025)BIENNIALCHANGE        EXPLANATION OF BIENNIAL CHANGE   $ Amount     Explanation(s) of Amount (must specify MOFs and FTEs)EXPLANATION OF BIENNIAL CHANGE (includes Rider amounts):$6,946,643 $6,870,444 $(76,199)$(76,199)change in salaries and wages along with personnel costs and operating expenseTotal of Explanation of Biennial Change $(76,199)3.A.

(judicial salaries).  As judicial salaries are set by statute, the courts are unable to make any reduction to that portion of their budgets.  Consequently, any budget reduction to this strategy must be applied only to the remaining two-thirds of the courts’ General Revenue: Strategy A.1.1. (appellate court operations) and would effectively result in a budget cut to the court that is significantly higher than the cuts directed to other State agencies.EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS  IMPACTING STRATEGY:STRATEGY BIENNIAL TOTAL - ALL FUNDSBase Spending (Est 2022 + Bud 2023)     Baseline Request (BL 2024 + BL 2025)BIENNIALCHANGE        EXPLANATION OF BIENNIAL CHANGE   $ Amount     Explanation(s) of Amount (must specify MOFs and FTEs)EXPLANATION OF BIENNIAL CHANGE (includes Rider amounts):$3,174,247 $3,174,248 $1 $1 Increase in Judicial salaries due to Judicial tenure-based compensationTotal of Explanation of Biennial Change $1 3.A.

Without an increase in funding, appellate courts will lose talented personnel to higher-paying private jobs. This loss of key personnel will detrimentally effect performance standards, including (1) a reduction in overall dispositions of appeals, preventing the courts from clearing older cases and reaching the disposition target of 100% of new appeals filed in the biennium, and (2) an increase in the time from filing until disposition for those appeals which remain pending. Any unnecessary delay will be particularly devastating to the State by creating significant adverse consequences for the businesses, families, and children in Texas that are awaiting justice through the resolution of their disputes. Note, also, that the budget model is updated as of 2020 and does not include an adjustment for the impact of inflation.EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS:Courts of Appeals are relatively small entities with specialized staffing requirements. The core function of the courts is to process and review appeals and original proceedings from civil and criminal trial courts. This requires a highly skilled and trained professional workforce of appellate court lawyers who assist the judges of the court in disposing of cases and researching and writing opinions. Prior to this LAR, the budget model had not been completely updated since 2005. Operating at this funding level has prevented the courts of appeals from increasing salaries to a level that will help the courts attract and retain the most qualified attorneys and staff. In FY 2021, the Judiciary had the third highest turnover rate in the state by General Appropriations Act Article at 14.5 percent.  Loss of key personnel will effect performance standards thus preventing the courts from reaching the disposition target of 100% of 4.A.

The impact has been devastating for many because the State has not given them a meaningful raise in a significant period of time. Their buying power for goods and services has diminished and, at some courts, has resulted in attrition by those seeking higher-paying jobs. If salaries are not increased, the courts risk losing more personnel that will be costly to replace. Training takes time and will impact the ability of the courts to meet the current and expected demands as we navigate the post-pandemic surge.On May 4, 2022, the Council of Chiefs submitted written testimony to the Senate Committee on Finance comprised of testimonials from court personnel describing personal experiences with rising costs. The Council asks for consideration of this testimony.The courts of appeals join in the judiciary-wide inflation relief for non-judicial employees sought by Article IV courts and agencies. Respectfully, a ten percent (10%) increase on the budget model salaries is sought to help absorb the impact of inflation. To maintain the Similar Funding for Same-Sized Courts model that has worked exceptionally well for years, the requested percentage must be based on the budget model salaries. This exceptional item is not duplicative of exceptional item 1, which does not include an adjustment for the inflation that is expected to persist for some time to come.EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS:Inflation is diminishing the buying power of attorneys and staff. Many are struggling to pay mortgages, rent and other items necessary for their livelihood. A ten percent (10%) increase on the budget model salaries is sought to offset the current impact of inflation, diminish the effect of future inflation, and to permit the courts of appeals to pay attorneys and staff competitive salaries that will help them in the event of a recession.  4.A.

This is based on the court's General Revenue funding that is dedicated to Strategy A.1.2. (judicial salaries).  The requested amount is calculated on the estimated and nontransferable funds allocated to Strategy A.1.2. The calculated amount on judicial salaries amounts to an estimated $134,801 per month for Fiscal Year 2024 and $135,328 per month for Fiscal Year 2025, the court would be at a deficit once all judicial salaries increase. If the increase in judicial salaries is not augmented, the court will have to reduce staffing. This is crucial because 96.5 % of the court's budget is dedicated to staffing, leaving very little discretionary funds to achieve any reductions.  Any reduction in staffing will result in failure to meet performance standards, including (1) a reduction in dispositions of appeals, preventing the courts from clearing older cases and reaching the disposition target of 100% of new appeals filed in the biennium, and (2) an increase in the time for which appeals remain pending.EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS:Courts of Appeals are relatively small entities with specialized staffing requirements. The core function of the courts is to process and review appeals and original proceedings from civil and criminal trial courts. This requires a highly skilled and trained professional workforce of appellate court lawyers who assist the judges of the court in disposing of cases and researching and writing opinions. Loss of experienced court lawyers creates difficulties in timely processing of and disposing of appeals and in maintaining professional business practices.

Constitutional or Statutory Creation and Use of Funds:

Pursuant to section 22.202 of the Government code, counties other than Harris County composing the First and Fourteenth Court of Appeals Districts shall annually reimburse 
Harris County for the cost incurred by Harris County during its previous fiscal year for supplemental salaries and fringe benefits for the justices of those courts. In addition, 
these counties are also to provide reimbursement for furnishings, equipment, supplies, and utility expense for those courts. 

Method of Calculation and Revenue Assumptions:

Each county is to pay a share based on the proportion of their population to the total population of all counties in these districts. To effectuate the billing and payment process, 
the Harris County Commissioners Court is required to furnish each county liable for expenses with a statement of that county’s share. Furthermore, the statement must be 
approved by the Chief Justices of the Courts of Appeals.
