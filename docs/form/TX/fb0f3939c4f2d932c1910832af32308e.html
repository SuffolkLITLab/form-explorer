      <pre>Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 
 
Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 

   

APPEAL NO.: 

21-001 

ESPONDENT: 

 Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee (UPLC) 

ATE: 

 

March 4, 2021 

PECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge  Stephen  B.  Ables,  Chairman;  Judge  Olen  Underwood, 
Judge Sid Harle, Judge Missy Medary, Judge Dean Rucker 

 

 

 

Petitioner requested the following records from Respondent:  
 

1.  “Names and contact information for all members of the Texas UPLC.” 

2.  “Names and contact information for all members of the Texas UPL 

District 6 Subcommittee as is stood in January 2020 and May 2020.” 

3.  “The records for all in attendance at and minutes of the January 2020 

UPL District 6 Subcommittee meeting.” 

4.  “The records for all in attendance at and minutes of the May 2020 UPL 

District 6 Subcommittee meeting.” 

etitioner later amended the request and asked for the following additional records (in 

5.  The original complaint filed with the UPLC regarding Petitioner and 
any communications regarding the suit instituted by the UPLC 
concerning Petitioner.  

6.  All records related to investigative actions, meetings, calls, reports, 

findings, meetings, notes, and legal research obtained by or relied upon 
the UPLC and the UPLC’s District 6 Subcommittee (Subcommittee) in 
investigating the complaint filed against Petitioner. 

7.  Disclosure of monetary compensation or value of any kind received or 
provided to members of the UPLC or the Subcommittee and the names 
of any members of the UPLC or the Subcommittee who may have met

summary):

with any individual at a restaurant, food service establishment, event or 
fundraiser where Petitioner was discussed, and the dates and locations 
of such meals and who paid for them. 

espondent did not provide Petitioner records responsive to items 1 and 2 of Petitioner’s 
request (names and contact information for UPLC and Subcommittee members) but did provide 
a link to a page on Respondent’s website that contained contact information for the UPLC and 
Subcommittee  chair  and  a  listing  of  the  Subcommittee  members.  In  response  to  item  5  of 
Petitioner’s  request  (the  complaint  and  communications  regarding  the  suit  instituted  by 
Respondent),  Respondent  provided  Petitioner  a  copy  of  the  complaint  with  the  name  of  the 
complaining party redacted. Respondent denied the remainder of Petitioner’s requests. Petitioner 
then  filed  this  appeal  requesting  expedited  review1  and  raising  issues  regarding  Respondent’s 
authority and procedures. This special  committee is without  authority to address issues outside 
the scope of Rule 12 of the Rules of Judicial Administration; therefore, this decision addresses 
only those matters related to the Respondent’s denial of Petitioner’s request for records.2  

e  first  address  Respondent’s  response  to  items  1  and  2  of  Petitioner’s  request.  
Respondent  denied  this  request  asserting  the  information  was  exempt  under  Rule  12.5(k) 
(Investigations of Character or Conduct) but also directed Petitioner to the Respondent’s website 
for contact information for the members of the UPLC and the chair of the Subcommittee. Rule 
12.5(k)  exempts  from  disclosure  “any  record  relating  to  an  investigation  of  any  person's 
character or conduct, unless: (1) the record is requested by the person being investigated; and (2) 
release  of  the  record,  in  the  judgment  of  the  records  custodian,  would  not  impair  the 
investigation.”  Respondent  has  instituted  suit  against  Petitioner  but  maintains  that  its 
investigation is not complete and that the release of this information would impair Respondent’s 
investigation.  Respondent  also  asserts  that  the  Petitioner  seeks  this  information  to  harass  and 
possibly name the  Subcommittee  members in a lawsuit. From the information  available to this 
special committee, we are unable to conclude that releasing the names and contact information of 
the members of the UPLC and the Subcommittee would impair the Respondent's investigation. 
Thus,  this  information  is  not  exempt  under  Rule  12.5(k).3  Additionally,  we  acknowledge  that 
directing records requestors to an agency’s website for the information they seek is an efficient 
manner  of  handling  requests.  However,  the  form  or  manner  in  which  a  request  is  fulfilled  is 
ultimately  within  the  discretion  of  the  requestor.  If  a  requestor  informs  the  agency  that  they 
prefer  to  be  provided  copies  or  allowed  to  inspect  the  records  after  an  agency  has  already 
informed  the  requestor  that  the  requested  information  can  be  accessed  from  its  website,  the 
agency should comply.  

e  next  address  Petitioner's  request  for  records  showing  those  in  attendance  at  the 
Subcommittee's  January  2020  and  May  2020  meetings  and  the  minutes  of  those  meetings. 

 

1  Petitioner’s request for expedited review was not granted. 
2  Petitioner also raised provisions of the Public Information Act (PIA) (Tex. Gov’t Code, Chap. 552) in this appeal. 
Respondent, as a judicial agency, is subject to Rule 12, not the PIA. See Rule 12 Decision No. 99-001. 
3  We  note  that  some  contact  information  may  be  exempt  under  Rule  12.5(d)  (Home  Address  and  Family 
Information) and this decision does not remove this protection.

Respondent  asserts  that  this  information  is  exempt  under  Rule  12.5(a)  (Judicial  Work  Product 
and  Drafts)  and  12.5(f)  (Internal  Deliberations  on  Court  or  Judicial  Administration  Matters).  
Rule 12.5(a) exempts records related to a judicial officer’s adjudicative decision-making process 
prepared by a judicial officer, staff, or persons acting on behalf of or at the direction a judicial 
officer. A prior Rule 12 special committee concluded that Respondent does not have adjudicative 
powers. See Rule 12 Decision No. 99-001. Thus, Rule 12.5(a) does not apply to these records. 
Though information maintained in a judicial agency’s meeting minutes may contain information 
relating to the internal deliberations of a judicial agency’s members, we do not believe a list of 
the  names  of  those  in  attendance  at  a  meeting  or  the  “roll  call”  constitute  or  are  related  to  the 
internal deliberations of a judicial agency. We have reviewed the responsive documents provided 
for  our  in  camera  review  and  conclude  that  the  entries  in  the  minutes  reflect  final  votes  and 
factual  statements  not  matters  related  to  the  internal  deliberations  of  the  Subcommittee’s 
members. Thus, we conclude that the minutes are not exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5(f).  

e next address items 5 and 6 of Petitioner's request.  Respondent asserts these items are 
exempt under Rule 12.5(k) and Rule 12.5(j) (Litigation or Settlement Negotiations). Rule 12.5(j) 
exempts  any  record  related  to  civil  or  criminal  litigation  or  settlement  negotiations.  It  is 
undisputed  that  Respondent  has  instituted  a  lawsuit  that  stems  from  its  investigation  of  the 
complaint filed against Petitioner.  Thus, the records responsive to both items 5 and 6 are related 
to the lawsuit and are exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5(j). 

astly,  we  address  item  7  of  Petitioner’s  request.    Respondent  states  that  there  are  no 
items responsive  to this  request, but notes that if there were any,  they would be  exempt  under 
Rule  12.5(k)(2).    There  being  no  responsive  records,  we  need  not  address  this  issue  and  no 
further action is required by Respondent regarding this item. 

n summary, Petitioner should be granted access to the information responsive to items 1, 
2, 3, and 4 of Petitioner’s request. The records responsive to items 5 and 6 of Petitioner’s request 
are  exempt  from  disclosure  under  Rule  12.5(j).  No  items  exist  in  response  to  item  7  of 
Petitioner’s request and no further action is required regarding this item.
