Introduction 

On  June  24,  2022,  the Supreme  Court  of  Texas  Permanent  Judicial  Commission  for Children , 
Youth and Families (Children’s Commission) and the Texas Judicial Commission on Mental Health 
(JCMH) held  the  first  joint  commission  Round  Table  Discussion  on  Children ’s  Mental  Health. 
Leadership  from  both  commissions  participated  in  the  discussion  including  Supreme  Court  of 
Texas  Justice  Debra  Lehrmann,  Chair  of  the  Children’s  Commission;  Texas  Court  of  Criminal 
Appeals  Judge  Barbara  Hervey,  Co-Chair of  the  Judicial  Commission  on  Mental  Health;  and 
Supreme Court of Texas Justice Rebeca Huddle, Deputy Chair of the Children’s Commission and 
Deputy Liaison to the Judicial Commission on Mental Health. Invited guests included young adults 
and parents with lived experience, judges hearing both juvenile and child welfare cases, leaders 
from state agencies (the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS), Health and 
Human  Services  Commission  (HHSC),  and  the  Texas  Juvenile  Justice  Department  (TJJD)), 
attorneys, service providers, and advocates.  

The Honorable John J. Specia, retired judge and Jurist in Residence of the Judicial Commission 
on  Mental  Health,  served  as  moderator  for  the  discussion.  Luanne  Southern,  Executive 
Director  of  the  Texas  Child  Mental  Health  Care  Consortium,  provided  participants  with  an 
overview of the children’s mental health landscape in Texas.

Background 

At the February 25, 2022 meeting, members of the Children’s Commission identified the urgent 
need  to  strengthen  the  systems  supporting  children  with  complex  mental  health  needs.1 
Specifically, the conversation centered on whether focusing efforts and resources to address the 
mental health needs of children who experience the Texas child welfare system would ultimately 
reduce the number of children without placement. Moreover, Children’s Commission members 
discussed the need to focus on preventative measures to assist families in ways that might avert 
the  possibility  of  relinquishment  of  parental  rights  through  a  Refusal  to  Assume  Parental 
Responsibility  (RAPR)  case.  There  was  also  discussion  regarding  the  importance  of  placing 
children  with  relatives  and  kin  whenever  possible  and  enhancing  supports  to  stabilize  these 
placements, including financial supports.  

Children’s Commission members then discussed the idea of convening various stakeholders to 
have a more in-depth discussion around children’s mental health to gather more information on 
the  challenges  faced  by  children  with  complex  mental  health  needs.  After  the  meeting, 
leadership  of  both  the  Children’s  Commission  and  the  Judicial  Commission  on  Mental  Health 
prioritized a joint initiative wherein the commissions would partner to address these topics and 
challenges as well as opportunities for systemic improvement.  

A Brief History of Children’s Mental Health in Texas 

At the Round Table meeting, Luanne Southern provided a brief overview of the history of state 
and national law and policy on children’s mental health which is summarized below.  

In  1961,  the  Congressional  Joint  Commission  on  Mental  Illness  and  Health  issued  a  report  
entitled “Action for Mental Health: Final Report of the Joint Commission on Mental Illness and 
Health  1961”  (1961  Report)  containing  the  commission’s  findings  and  recommendations  for 
improved  research,  training,  and  treatment  in  the  field  of  mental  health.2  The  1961  Report 
identified  three  main  problems  that  continue  to  influence  policy  and  practice  on  effectively 
addressing children’s mental health:  

  Workforce: recruit, effectively train, and retain an adequate workforce; cultivate skills to 
address  the  needs  of  people  with  mental  illness;  strengthen  connections  with 
pediatricians; and increase the amount of child psychiatrists. 

  Mental Health Facilities: create a network of community mental health clinics; involve 
parents  and  families  in  treatment;  and  invest  in  post-inpatient  services  such  as  foster 
family care. 

6 

 

Funding: increase funding for children’s services; fund state mental health agencies; and 
provide treatment without hospitalization. 

Issuance  of  the 1961  Report  was  a  pivotal  moment  for  mental health  services  that  led  to the 
creation of the community mental health system across the United States and locally in Texas 
through what  was  known  at  the time  as  the  Texas  Department  of Mental  Health  and Mental 
Retardation  (MHMR).3  The  report  also  paved  the  way  for  Congress  to  pass  the  Community 
Mental  Health  Act  of  1963.4  The  Community  Mental  Health  Act  focused  on  the  creation  of 
community-based services, prevention, and research.5 However, recommendations in the area 
of children’s services were limited in scope.  

In 1982, the Children’s Defense Fund released a study entitled “Unclaimed Children: The Failure 
of  Public  Responsibility  to  Children  and  Adolescents  in  Need  of  Mental  Health  Services”  that 
highlighted inadequacies of children’s mental health services across the country and emphasized 
that the public policy issue is not whether to spend money but how to spend money to address 
children’s  mental  health.6  The  study  called  for  the  creation  of  children’s  mental  health 
departments  with  leadership  positions  at  state  mental  health  agencies.  The  study  also 
emphasized the need to have a statewide children’s mental health plan in place based on the 
state’s mental health plan, with strategies for expanding intensive services as well as interagency 
service coordination efforts at the state and local levels. To facilitate the children’s mental health 
plan, the report recommended the identification of liaisons amongst and between state agencies 
that  provide  and  fund  children’s  mental  health  services  and  called  for  agencies  to  consider 
pooling resources. 

In 1984, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) began funding the Child and Adolescent 
Service System Project (CASSP) initiative to help states plan for and design systems of care to 
address  the  mental  health  needs  of  children  who  were  experiencing  a  serious  emotional 
disturbance.7 In 1987, the 70th Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill 257 which directed MHMR 
to  establish  the  Coordinator  of  Children  and  Youth  Services  position.  Thereafter,  MHMR 
established a separate children’s mental health division with designated staff and a director who 
reported to the MHMR Commissioner. The new division also created children’s mental health 
directors and divisions within the MHMR Centers across Texas, highlighting the importance of 
the work.8 The 70th Texas Legislature also enacted Senate Bill 298 requiring eight public agencies 
to work together to assist children and youth with complex needs whose needs could not be met 
by a single agency.9 The result was the development of the Community Resource Coordination 
Group  (CRCG)  model  which  established  interagency  service  planning  at  the  county  level.  The 
CRCGs were piloted in 1988 to create a multi-agency process for identification of specific families 
in need of coordinated care.10  

7 

Throughout the 1990s, Texas made many advances in expanding the children’s mental health 
service array and coordinating efforts across child serving agencies. In a significant development 
for  the  state,  in  1991  the  72nd  Texas  Legislature  appropriated  $22.1  million  for  the  1992-93 
biennium to MHMR in trust for nine participating agencies to implement the Texas Children’s 
Mental  Health  Plan  (TCMHP).11  The  TCMHP  resulted  in  the  creation  of  innovative  services 
designed to keep families together and prevent an over-reliance on out-of-home placements into 
residential treatment centers and psychiatric inpatient facilities. Agencies that funded children’s 
mental  health  services  created  a  structure  that  included  the  development  of  a  State 
Management Team and Community Management Teams at the local level. The State and Local 
Management Teams were designed to encourage multi-agency collaboration, coordinate public 
funding streams, and promote multi-agency planning and development to decrease duplication 
of  effort,  streamline  entries  into  care,  and  address  the  needs  of  children  who  required  the 
involvement of more than one publicly funded system. Individuals with lived experience were 
key members of the State and Local Management Teams. These teams were given the authority 
to direct and manage all the public resources allocated to purchase and provide children’s mental 
health services. The nine agency members at the time included the Texas Commission on Alcohol 
and  Drug  Abuse,  Texas  Department  of  Human  Services,  Texas  Education  Agency,  Texas 
Rehabilitation  Commission,  Interagency  Council  on  Early  Childhood  Intervention,  Texas 
Department  of  Health,  Texas  Department  of  Mental  Health  and  Retardation,  Texas  Juvenile 
Probation Commission, and the Texas Youth Commission.12 

Through  the  TCMHP,  many  programs  were  implemented  with  the  focus  of  keeping  families 
together  and  avoiding  relinquishment  of  parental  rights  and  reliance  on  costly  out-of-home 
placements. These programs included intensive home-based treatment services that had an 85% 
success  rate  of  keeping  families  together,  mobile  24/7  child  and  adolescent  psychiatric 
emergency teams staffed by children’s mental health professionals who provided emergency and 
30-  to  60-day  intensive  home-based  treatment  follow  up,  and  school-based  mental  health 
services. Initiatives also included a joint project focused on youth involved with juvenile justice 
and mental health services, as well as crisis respite care and therapeutic foster care.13

Texas’ first formal system of care efforts were funded in 1996 through a Robert Wood Johnson 
Foundation grant and expansion efforts were funded in 1998 through a Substance Abuse and 
Mental  Health  Services  Administration  (SAMHSA)  grant  awarded  to  HHSC  and  implemented 
locally  in  Travis  County,  Texas  as  the  Children’s  Partnership.14  In  1999,  Senate  Bill  1234 
established the Texas Integrated Funding Initiative (TIFI), which provided for the braiding of state 
funds  aimed  at  continuing  the  cross-agency  collaboration  to  develop  innovative  community-
based systems of care for children with severe emotional disturbances and their families.15 These 
efforts led to the development of a Home and Community-Based Medicaid 1915c waiver, named 
the  Youth  Empowerment  Services  (YES)  Medicaid  Waiver  program,  which  was  designed  to 
provide intensive community-based services to prevent parental custody relinquishment in order 
to  access  mental  health  services  for  children  and  youth  with  serious  mental,  emotional,  and 
behavioral difficulties.16 

Facing  a  budget  shortfall  in  2003,  the  78th  Texas  Legislature  significantly  reduced  the  mental 
health  and  Intellectual  and  Development  Disability  (IDD)  services  budget.17  House  Bill  2292 
completely reorganized the HHSC and narrowed the population of children that could be served 
by  Local  Mental  Health  Authorities  (LMHAs)  to  only  those  children  with  severe  emotional 
disturbances.18 Many elements of the children’s mental health plan infrastructure and innovative 
children’s  mental  health  services  were  eliminated  or  absorbed  under  adult  services,  thereby 
losing  their  priority  focus.  Although  Texas  continues  to  make  advances,  the  cross-agency 
collaboration focused on building a comprehensive statewide service array to specifically address 
children’s mental health has experienced setbacks. 

Today, the mental health needs of children and youth are as prevalent as ever.19 The Center for 
Disease Control estimates nearly 1 in 5 children have a mental, emotional, or behavior disorder, 
however only 20% of these children receive care from a specialized mental health care provider.20 
The Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute estimates that 350,000 children in Texas experience 
severe mental health needs in a year.21 Further, in 2020 it was estimated that 20,000 children 
and youth ages 6-17 in Texas either are currently in or are at very high risk for out-of-home or 
out-of-school placement because of their mental health needs.22  

Round Table Format 

Judge Specia led participants through an interactive discussion which included identifying gaps 
for  systems-involved  children,  sharing  current  initiatives  in  Texas  to  address  such  needs,  and 
developing recommendations for short- and long-term approaches to the issue. The Round Table 
focus  did  not  include  issues  related  to  substance  use  disorders.  This  report  reflects  ideas 
includes  next  steps  for  future  collaboration  and 
generated  at  the  Round  Table  and 
implementation.

Identifying Gaps for the Systems-Involved Children with 
Complex Mental Health Needs 

The Round Table discussion began with an identification of the current gaps in providing services 
to children with complex mental health needs. Due to the breadth of these challenges, the focus 
for discussion was narrowed to seeking collaborative solutions for children and youth with unmet 
complex mental health needs who  consequently are presenting challenging behaviors which can 
result in those children being without placement23 in the child welfare system, having contact 
with the juvenile justice system, or  being involved in both systems simultaneously (also referred 
to as dual status).24 While discussion focused on youth currently involved in child welfare and 
juvenile justice systems, discussion about gaps and solutions often emphasized the importance 
of prevention.  

As Round Table participants identified gaps in services, several themes became apparent: access 
to resources, placement capacity, service array, workforce, communication, and training gaps. 

 

10 

Access to Resources 

Participants acknowledged that in recent years the Texas Legislature has infused the state with 
additional funding for mental health resources. However, participants commented that due to 
population  growth  and  inflation,  Texas  is  still  unable  to  support  the  basic  level  of  children’s 
mental health services. Texas added more people than any other state in the U.S. over the last 
decade and saw the highest rate of under-18 population growth among the six most populous 
states.25 

Caregivers, including parents or any individual responsible for the care, custody, and control of a 
child,  face  difficult  challenges  in  accessing  resources  for  children  with  complex  needs.  A 
participant  with  first-hand  experience  as  a  parent  working  to  obtain  services  for  her  child 
emphasized that the HHSC waiver programs intended to support families and potentially prevent 
children experiencing the child welfare and juvenile systems maintain substantial wait lists which 
contain  thousands  of  individuals  and  take  several  years  for  applicants  to  receive  approval. 
Further, LMHAs only serve a small proportion of children who need behavioral health services. 
Private mental health services can be expensive and cost-prohibitive for caregivers. Due to Texas’ 
vast geography, participants reported that many areas lack the services needed to maintain a 
continuum of children’s mental health care, including rural locations. 

Placement Capacity 

A majority of children without placement have complex mental health needs and have a service 
level  identified  as  “Intense”  or  “Specialized.”26  One  factor  that  may  contribute  to  the  high 
numbers  of  children  without  placement  is  that  there  are  few  placements  available  to  serve 
children with complex mental health needs in the most family-like setting, such as Treatment 
Foster  Family  Care  (TFFC)27  and  outpatient  services.  Moreover,  kinship  placements  are 
recognized  as  a  vital  placement  type  to  keep  children  connected  to  their  family,  but  kinship 
reimbursement rates are lower, and some kinship caregivers need additional support.  

Similar  to  the  placement  challenges  faced  by  DFPS,  few  placements  exist  for  juvenile  justice-
involved  children,  especially  those  with  assaultive  or  sexual  behaviors.  Additionally,  the 
availability  of  residential  treatment  facilities  that  serve  children  with  more  than  one  mental 
health condition and/or Intellectual or Developmental Disability is limited, especially for children 
with an Autism Spectrum Disorder.  

Service Array  

Participants  emphasized  that  Texas  lacks  a  comprehensive  continuum  of  care  for  children 
involved in both the child welfare and juvenile justice systems. Community-based services for 

11 

children with complex mental health needs can be scarce and caregivers may instead look to the 
child welfare or juvenile justice system to provide the services.  

Increased  numbers  of  children  with  complex  mental  health  needs  in  the  child  welfare  and 
juvenile justice systems highlights the need to expand children’s mental health service array to 
comprehensively  address  children’s  needs.  As  noted  in  the  DFPS  Children  Without  Placement 
Report, the lack of psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTF) in Texas has underscored the 
need for additional placements serving youth who step down from psychiatric treatment.28 The 
Intensive  Psychiatric  Transition  Program  (IPTP)  was  designed  to  support  youth  during  these 
transitions but there are very few IPTP providers in Texas.29 As a result, DFPS must enter into 
child specific contracts, often with out-of-state providers.30  

Additionally, participants noted that critical, trauma-informed post-adoption services may not be 
widely available throughout the state which can contribute to instability in an adoptive home 
when an adopted child exhibits challenging behaviors.  

Maintaining or implementing mental health care is vitally important in the juvenile justice system 
as most youth committed to TJJD have some level of mental health need and approximately 65% 
have significant mental health issues.31 Participants also indicated that continuity of care for a 
youth can be interrupted while a youth is in juvenile detention.32  

With  every  placement  change  for  systems-involved  children,  services  can  be  interrupted,  and 
new providers introduced. A participant who experienced the child welfare system as a youth 
with complex mental health needs expressed how disruptive it was for their care when placed in 
a  congregate  care  facility  that  intermingled  youth  in  foster  care  with  justice-involved  youth. 
Additionally, they emphasized that there was a failure by mental health providers to listen to 
their voice which resulted in improper medication treatment with serious side effects rather than 
addressing their trauma and mental health needs through therapeutic interventions. 

Workforce  

Participants noted that an overriding challenge to providing appropriate services to children is a 
critical workforce shortage across child welfare, juvenile justice, and the mental health systems.33 
These  shortages  result  in  reduced  provider  capacity  for  children  to  be  served  in  their 
communities. Texas faces a shortage of psychologists, psychiatrists, and therapists qualified to 
address children’s mental health needs.34  

Participants  acknowledged  that  burnout  is  high  among  child  and  youth-serving  professionals, 
especially  caseworkers,  probation  and  TJJD  staff,  and  educators.  Addressing  burnout  and 
secondary trauma awareness among staff and providing tools to support prevention of these job-
related issues and possibly alleviate the high turnover rate in some measure. 

12 

Communication 

Participants identified gaps in communication within and across systems as a contributing factor 
to serving children with complex mental health needs. These challenges are exacerbated when 
youth are simultaneously involved in multiple systems. In additional to child welfare and juvenile 
justice, participants also discussed the vital role which the education system plays in the lives of 
children  and  youth  and  the  importance  of  collaborating  effectively  across  systems.  School 
counselors could be utilized to support students with mental health needs but often there are 
inadequate resources to support all students in need. 

Participants pointed out that the various child-serving systems must often compete for the same 
funding and staffing resources. For example, when one system increases incentives for hiring, it 
can make hiring in another child-serving system more challenging.   

Training 

Participants  discussed  the  broader  issue  of  not  designing  systems  to  address  root  causes  but 
rather  to  treat  symptoms.  Children  and  youth  without  placement  may  exhibit  challenging 
behaviors which can result in juvenile justice involvement. Training on trauma and brain science 
and  providing  child-serving  professionals  and  caregivers  with  practical  strategies  to  mitigate 
trauma responses and deescalate a youth may reduce behaviors that result in a juvenile offense 
referral. For example, there are instances when aggressive behavior can be addressed before an 
assault is committed. Juvenile detention centers and TJJD facilities may lack adequate trauma-
informed or developmentally appropriate space for every youth they serve. A participant who 
experienced the juvenile justice system as a youth described the impact on their self-worth and 
feeling of hopelessness after being treated negatively by juvenile justice staff.  

Participants also underscored that children of color are disproportionality represented in these 
systems. DFPS reports indicate that some populations of children experience the child welfare 
system at a disproportionate rate to their presence in the general population while other child 
populations  are  underrepresented.35  As  a  result,  training  to  help  staff  provide  culturally 
responsive services was recognized as a critical need.   

Participants acknowledged that navigating multiple systems is extremely difficult. Even among 
agency  staff,  understanding  the  correct  program  in  which  to  enroll  a  child  can  be  daunting. 
Training  on  these  key  issues  was  identified  as  a  major  gap  in  addressing  the  complex  mental 
health needs of children who experience these systems.   

13 

Current Initiatives in Texas to Address the Need 

A broad network of individuals, organizations, and agencies have been working for many years 
to address the gaps identified above. The non-exhaustive list of current initiatives is summarized 
below.  

Texas,  home  to  top-tier  research  universities  and  an  extensive  array  of  experts,  has  a  good 
foundation  of  knowledge-based  resources.  Public  awareness  of  children’s  mental  health  has 
never been higher, due in part to challenges experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic and in 
part to campaigns like Okay to Say36 and Children’s Mental Health Acceptance Day.37  

A number of mental health guides and mental health resource websites exist for those who know 
where  to  look  for  them.  In  addition  to  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals’  Texas  Mental  Health 
Resource Guide38 and the JCMH Innovations in Mental Health Map,39 Mentalhealthtx.org40 is a 
repository  of  behavioral  health  resources  searchable  by  zip  code.  Texas  Health  and  Human 
Services Commission, National Alliance on Mental Illness Texas, Texas Suicide Prevention Council, 
and other organizations offer education, support, and training to children with behavioral health 
needs and their families. Additionally, CRCGs41 work at the county level to identify and coordinate 
resources and services for youth, adults, and families.  

Trained  navigators  or  family  advocates  with  lived  experience  can  assist  families  in  navigating 
these systems, determining what assessments, accommodations, or benefits they should receive 
and how to make the appropriate requests. Representatives from HHSC reported that the agency 
is  working  toward  certifying  more  peer  support  family  partners,  who  use  their  personal 
experience to  offer  support to  caregivers  and  families of  youth diagnosed  with  mental health 
conditions.  Further,  Superior  HealthPlan—the  current  Managed  Care  Organization  (MCO) 
providing  Texas  Medicaid  programs  for  children  in  foster  care  and  eligible  youth  in  TJJD 
facilities42—has a hotline that advises families on available services and resources.

Texas  is  investing  in  innovative  strategies  to  address  access  to  resources  and  transportation 
challenges. The Texas Child Mental Health Care Consortium (TCMHCC)43 has several strategies to 
improve  Texans’  access  to  care  through  telemedicine.  TCMHCC’s  Texas  Child  Health  Access 
Through  Telemedicine  (TCHATT)  uses  telehealth  to  assist  schools  in  identifying  and  assessing 
students’ behavioral health needs and provides access to services. 44 Private providers like Charlie 
Health  offer  personalized  intensive  outpatient  mental  healthcare  for  youth  via  telehealth.45 
Another TCMHCC initiative, the Child Psychiatry Access Network (CPAN), allows pediatricians to 
use telehealth consultations with psychiatrists to assist in early identification of behavioral health 
conditions  during  routine  well-child  office  visits.46  TCMHCC  also  has  focused  initiatives  on 
expanding  Texas’  mental  health  workforce  through  the  Community  Psychiatry  Workforce 
Expansion (CPWE) and the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (CAP) Fellowship.47 

Participants  agreed  that  families  should  first  seek  outpatient  services  before  seeking  help 
through  the  LMHA  or  identifying  more  intensive  programs,  such  as  inpatient  treatment,  YES 
Waiver,  or  the  Residential  Treatment  Center  Project.48  The  expansion  of  youth  crisis  respite 
programs,  such  as  Bluebonnet  Trails’  recent  Children’s  Crisis  Respite  Program,  could  relieve 
caregiver stress while providing short-term respite services to the child in a family setting. Some 
private providers with programming across the state, like Pathways Youth & Family Services, have 
the  ability  to  ensure  continuity  of  care  if  the  child  moves  around  the  state  through  either 
telehealth  or  by  connecting  the  child  with  local  in-person  services  with  a  focus  on  a  smooth 
transition process.49 Finally, youth in the juvenile justice system who are at risk of commitment 
to  TJJD  may  be  eligible  for  Regional  Diversion  Alternatives  (RDA)  grants.50  TJJD  provides  RDA 
grants  to  counties  to  reimburse  local  juvenile  probation  departments  for  the  funds  spent  on 
community-based treatment, placement in a residential treatment center, and aftercare services 
in lieu of commitment to TJJD. 

Another initiative to increase quality of care for children and youth in foster care is the Foster 
Care  Rate  Modernization  (FCRM)  project  initiated  in  2020.  The  goal  of  FCRM  is  to  improve 
outcomes  for  children,  youth,  and  young  adults  through  the  establishment  of  a  well-defined 
service  continuum  that  meets  the  needs  of  the  foster  care  population  and  recognizes  and 
compensates the caregiver for delivering high-quality services.51 

15 

Priority Recommendations 

After identifying gaps and current initiatives, participants engaged in a brainstorming activity to 
develop recommendations. Participants gathered in smaller groups to discuss ideas and elevate 
one or two of those ideas to the larger group for consideration. The recommendations fell into 
the general themes of Expanding Awareness, Training & Tools, Systems Collaboration, and Access 
to Services. 

Expanding Awareness  

youth. 

1.  Increase public awareness of mental health services available for children and 

Texas should expand efforts to raise public awareness of current entry points for accessing care 
and to further efforts to destigmatize mental health. The Okay to Say campaign is a successful 
initiative  by  the  Meadows  Mental  Health  Policy  Institute  and  the  Hackett  Center  for  Mental 
Health.52 Participants recommend expanding on campaigns of this nature to provide families with 
information  and  resources  to  address  their  child’s  mental  health  needs  earlier  and  more 
effectively. Public awareness campaigns could use recognizable Texans to encourage families to 
seek out available services such as the www.MentalHealthTX.org site supported by HHSC.53  

In addition to statewide initiatives to increase awareness of resources, localized efforts should 
be  made  to  reach  families  through  community  resources  such  as  public  schools,  religious 
communities, community service groups, local government, and other community level meeting 
spaces.  A  recommendation  connected  with  increasing  awareness  was to develop or  expand  a 
hotline for families where they can speak to parent navigators through a triage system and be 
connected with the appropriate local services.  

 

16 

For  families  who  have  children  in  foster  care  or  who  are  otherwise  covered  by  Superior 
HealthPlan, there are member services hotlines for behavioral health available to help navigate 
STAR Health services, which serves children under DFPS conservatorship,54 and a crisis hotline.55 
This information needs to be widely distributed so that caregivers can benefit from this resource.  

2.  Develop  a  statewide 

including  judges, 
prosecutors,  defense  attorneys,  caregivers,  and  others  to  efficiently  navigate 
services for children and youth. 

liaison  system  for  specific  roles 

Participants recommended central points of contact to assist with locating appropriate services. 
For  example,  under  STAR  Health,  Superior  HealthPlan  recently  created  a  court  team  liaison 
position to help courts and other legal stakeholders navigate the Superior HealthPlan program 
and set up ongoing medical services to avoid gaps in care and delay of services. This program is 
a useful resource where is available. Expansion of this service and replication of it for the juvenile 
justice system is recommended. Funding may be required to expand this service to be available 
statewide. 

Likewise, participants recommend creating caregiver navigator positions focused on supporting 
family  members  as  they  are  working  to  find  mental  health  supports  for  their  child.  For  those 
already involved in the system, this navigator could also serve as a critical team member to help 
families access the services and supports needed to successfully return the child home.  

Training & Tools 

3.  Provide  opportunities  for  child  and  family  serving  professionals  to  learn  from 

young adults and caregivers with lived experiences.  

Any effort to improve the children’s mental health system must include the voices of those who 
have  first-hand  experience  navigating  the  system,  including  both  young  adults  and  caregivers 
with lived experience. Participants agreed that creating more opportunities for young adults and 
caregivers with lived experience navigating the child welfare and juvenile justice systems while 
dealing with a mental health challenge to educate system professionals would benefit direct care 
workers as well as those who draft and refine policies. A panel format in which panelists with 
lived  experience  can  speak  and  everyone  else  listens  was  suggested.  Judges  have  a  unique 
opportunity to convene stakeholders across systems and should leverage this ability to highlight 
the  voices of  individuals  with  lived  experience.  Individuals with  lived  experience  must  also  be 
adequately compensated for their time and expertise.  

 

17 

4.  Increase  opportunities  for  stakeholders  to  engage  in  cross-system  training  to 

break down system silos and enhance collaboration.  

Participants  agreed  that  cross-system  training  creates  opportunities  for  shared  learning  and 
encourages authentic collaboration. Increasing cross-system training opportunities at the local 
and statewide levels will benefit multiple child and family serving systems. One example of this 
work on a statewide level is JCMH’s annual Judicial Summit on Mental Health.56 The Summit is 
held  each  year  and  attendees  include  judges  from  all  levels  of  the  judiciary,  academia,  law 
enforcement, advocacy groups, prosecutors, defense attorneys, mental health and IDD service 
providers,  representatives  from  various  state  agencies,  policy  makers,  people  with  lived 
experience, and many others. 

Another  opportunity  for  cross-system  collaboration  and  training  at  a  local  level  is  for 
communities to create regular meeting opportunities for stakeholders. Participants pointed out 
that regularly scheduled convenings can improve overall coordination among stakeholders and 
improve  services  for  children  and  youth.  Additionally,  participants  recommended  that  more 
communities  engage  in  the  SAMHSA  Sequential  Intercept  Mapping  process  when  addressing 
mental health challenges in the juvenile justice system.57, 58  

5.  Provide group trainings to court teams and other participants in the legal case 
on key topics to address mental health, including the impact of trauma, specific 
mental health and IDD disorders, and local services available. 

Many courts will encounter cases that involve mental health challenges. Although not all courts 
need to be designated mental health specialty courts, Texas Government Code Chapter 125 sets 
out the statutorily required characteristics for the Mental Health Court Program and JCMH offers 
resources for courts looking to learn more about this model.59 Some courts may want to explore 
training opportunities to learn more about how to respond to the needs of children with complex 
mental health conditions.  

To  create  a  more  unified  approach,  communities  can  hold  trainings  for  all  the  various 
stakeholders in the life of a case on key topics to address mental health, including the impact of 
trauma, specific mental health and IDD disorders, and local services available. Attendees could 
include but are not limited to judges, court staff, prosecutors, defense attorneys, attorneys ad 
litem, caseworkers, probation officers, Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA), mentors, and 
 
service providers.  

18 

6.  Create  a  bench  card  and  other  resources  to  help  judges  and  court  teams 

navigate the mental health system.  

Participants  recommended  creation  of  a  judicial  bench  card  to  provide  judges  hearing  child 
welfare  and  juvenile  cases  with  easy  access  to  information  that  helps  courts  address  mental 
health needs. A bench card would contain general guidance on addressing mental health needs 
in  the  courtroom  and  resources  to  contact.  Participants  agreed  that  being  aware  of  and 
connecting with regional resources is a key need among the judiciary.  

Additionally, JCMH developed an Innovations Map that provides information on innovative court 
and  community  practices.60  This  map  could  be  expanded  or  duplicated  to  highlight  key 
innovations in juvenile and child welfare courts. The Children’s Commission, in partnership with 
the Texas Center for Child & Family Studies, currently supports six court sites as they implement 
a  trauma-informed  court  project  and  develop  trauma-informed  court  practices.  These 
innovations could help support court teams as they address complex mental health needs in the 
court setting. 

Systems Collaboration 

7.  Develop a shared definition of what it means to successfully serve children with 
complex mental health needs and then create a plan to accomplish the goals set 
out in the shared definition. 

Participants agreed that stakeholders need to develop a shared definition of what it means to 
successfully serve children with complex mental health needs and create a plan to achieve it. 
Such  a  definition  should  create  common  language  among  stakeholders  and  provide  positive, 
outcome-based performance incentives.  

Additionally,  children  who  experience  the  child  welfare  and/or  juvenile  justice  system  should 
have opportunities to provide input into decisions about their treatment and future. Participants 
suggested reviewing policies in other states to determine what improvements could be made in 
Texas to enhance youth engagement in treatment and future planning processes.  

8.  Child-serving agencies should collaborate during the Legislative Appropriations 
Request  (LAR)  process  to  best  utilize  resources  and  meet  the  needs  of  Texas 
children and youth. 

Participants endorsed the idea of all relevant state agencies engaging in a collaborative planning 
process once again and utilizing the historical Children’s Mental Health Plan as a road map for 
future efforts. This collaborative effort includes cross-agency review of LARs to ensure that all 
needed services are covered and work to fairly distribute resources across agencies. Further, this 

19 

cross-agency  collaboration  would  allow  each  agency  to  share  expertise  across  systems. 
Maintaining the  mantra “nothing  about us  without  us,”  those with  lived experiences  must  be 
included in the development of any statewide or local plans.  

Access to Services 

9.   Increase co-location of mental health services in schools.  

Although  the  Round  Table  discussion  was  focused  on  the  juvenile  justice  and  child  welfare 
systems, participants noted that schools are a primary referral point for children to both systems. 
Further, all children connect with the education system, and it is a natural front door for access 
to mental health services. Given this reality, participants strongly urged increasing the presence 
of mental health programs in Texas schools at all levels. Continuing to expand access to TCHATT 
across  school  districts  as  well  as  increasing  available  session  counts  for  children  was 
recommended.61  

Participants also recommended that services be expanded to teachers to help teachers navigate 
trauma  and  secondary  trauma  experiences,  as  well.  Another  program  emerging  in  Texas  that 
could  be  expanded  to  more  school  districts  is  the  Handle  with  Care  program.62  The  program 
creates partnerships between law enforcement and schools with the goal of providing teachers 

 

20 

with  notice  to  handle  the  child  with  care  and  connect  children  with  services  immediately 
following a traumatic event.63  

10. Develop a statewide Children’s Mental Health System of Care. 

Participants recommended  a  more  comprehensive  children’s  mental health  system  of  care  to 
address  children  with  complex  needs.  The  service  array  would  consist  of  evidenced-based  or 
promising practices and trauma-specific treatments and a fully trauma-informed system should 
be standard. Texas should have 24/7 mobile crisis response and stabilization services specifically 
designed to address the needs of children. Intensive care coordination should be implemented 
utilizing  the  wraparound  process  and  intensive  in-home  mental  health  treatment  should  be 
widely available to avert situations where families seek help through the juvenile justice or child 
welfare system. Parents and children would benefit from easy access to parent and youth peer 
support services and respite care is important to combat burnout. 

11. Leverage and expand existing programs to reach more children and youth. 

Participants identified multiple programs currently in existence that could be better utilized to 
meet the needs of Texas children and youth. This is a non-exhaustive list of opportunities for 
expansion of resources and services beyond those mentioned above. 

•  Strengthen the Behavioral Health Advisory Committee (BHAC)64 to break down silos 

between systems.65  

•  Expand the number of youth who can receive services through the HHSC Residential 

Treatment Center Project66 and the YES Waiver program.67 

•  Enhance use of CRCGs as entry points into mental health services and infuse resources 

into CRCGs to ensure they are effectively working in each community. 

•  Revise the statutory scheme to expand client populations for the LMHAs to include 

services to children in the child welfare system.  

•  Expand  partnerships  between  LMHAs  and  school  districts  to  better  support  school 

professionals and students.  

•  Leverage  existing  private  provider  networks  to  expand  available  services  beyond 
LMHAs  and  encourage  private/public  partnerships  among  all  entities  providing 
services to Texas children with mental health needs and their families. 

•  Expand Peer Support Services for caregivers and youth experiencing the systems. 

•  Engage  with  the  local  Federally  Qualified  Health  Centers  to  include  them  in  the 

collaborative process.68 

21 

•  Enhance  the  JCMH  Innovations  Map  by  expanding  community  input  and  providing 

more resources specific to youth.  

• 

Identify  opportunities  for  co-locating  services  in  places  where  people  already 
congregate, such as places of worship and high-traffic shopping centers.  

Next Steps  

At the conclusion of the Round Table meeting, it was clear that the discussion was an important 
first step but only the beginning of a substantial effort to collaborate and strengthen the State’s 
response to serving children with complex mental health needs. The Children’s Commission and 
the  Judicial  Commission  on  Mental  Health  are  committed  to  continuing  this  joint  effort  with 
Round Table participants as well as other key stakeholders necessary to continue the work. The 
Commissions  will  convene 
identify  and  address  priority 
recommendations.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
