      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre>Our legal system is based on the principle that an independent, fair and competent judiciary 
will interpret and apply the laws that govern us.  The role of the judiciary is central to American 
concepts  of  justice  and  the  rule  of  law.    Intrinsic  to  all  sections  of  this  Code  of Judicial 
Conduct are the precepts that judges, individually and collectively, must respect and honor the 
judicial office as a public trust and strive to enhance and maintain confidence in our legal system.  
The  judge  is  an  arbiter  of  facts  and  law  for  the  resolution  of  disputes  and  a highly visible 
symbol of government under the rule of law. 
 

The Code of Judicial Conduct is not intended as an exhaustive guide for the conduct of 
judges.  They should also be governed in their judicial and personal conduct by general ethical 
standards.    The  Code  is  intended,  however,  to  state  basic  standards  which  should  govern  the 
conduct of all judges and to provide guidance to assist judges in establishing and maintaining 
high standards of judicial and personal conduct. 

anon 1: Upholding the Integrity and Independence of the Judiciary 

An  independent  and  honorable  judiciary  is  indispensable  to  justice  in  our  society.   A 
judge should participate in establishing, maintaining and enforcing high standards of conduct, and 
should personally observe those standards so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary 
is preserved.  The provisions of this Code are to be construed and applied to further that objective. 

anon  2:  Avoiding  Impropriety  and  the  Appearance  of  Impropriety  in  All  of  the 

Judge’s Activities 

A  judge  shall  comply  with  the  law  and  should  act  at  all  times  in  a  manner  that 

promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. 

.         A judge shall not allow any relationship to influence judicial conduct or judgment.  A 
judge shall not lend the prestige of judicial office to advance the private interests of the judge or 
others; nor shall a judge convey or permit others to convey the impression that they are in a special 
position  to  influence  the  judge.   A  judge  shall  not testify  voluntarily  as  a  character witness. 

A  judge  shall  not  knowingly  hold  membership  in  any  organization  that  practices 

discrimination prohibited by law. 
 

COMMENT 

onsistent with section 253.1612 of the Texas Election Code, the Code of Judicial Conduct 

does not prohibit a joint campaign activity conducted by two or more judicial candidates.

TEXAS CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT 
 
(As amended by the Supreme Court of Texas through January 21, 2022) 

reamble 

    P

 

Canon 3: Performing the Duties of Judicial Office Impartially and Diligently 

.     Judicial Duties in General.   The judicial duties of a judge take precedence over all the 
judge's other activities.  Judicial duties include all the duties of the judge's office prescribed by law. 
In the performance of these duties, the following standards apply: 

.    Adjudicative Responsibilities. 

1)        A  judge  shall  hear  and  decide  matters  assigned  to  the  judge  except  those  in  which 
disqualification is required or recusal is appropriate. 

2)     A judge should be faithful to the law and shall maintain professional competence in it. A 
judge shall not be swayed by partisan interests, public clamor, or fear of criticism. 

3)     A judge shall require order and decorum in proceedings before the judge. 

4)     A judge shall be patient, dignified and courteous to litigants, jurors, witnesses, lawyers and 
others with whom the judge deals in an official capacity, and should require similar conduct of 
lawyers, and of staff, court officials and others subject to the judge's direction and control. 

5)     A judge shall perform judicial duties without bias or prejudice. 

6)     A  judge  shall  not,  in  the  performance  of  judicial  duties,  by  words  or  conduct  manifest 
bias or prejudice, including but not limited to bias or prejudice based upon race, sex, religion, 
national  origin,  disability,  age,  sexual  orientation  or  socioeconomic  status,  and  shall  not 
knowingly permit staff, court officials and others subject to the judge's direction and control to do 
so. 

7)     A   judge   shall   require   lawyers   in   proceedings   before   the   court   to   refrain   from 
manifesting, by words or conduct, bias or prejudice based on race, sex, religion, national origin, 
disability, age, sexual orientation or socioeconomic status against parties, witnesses, counsel or 
others.  This requirement does not preclude legitimate advocacy when any of these factors is an 
issue in the proceeding. 

8)     A  judge  shall  accord  to  every  person  who  has  a  legal  interest  in  a  proceeding,  or  that 
person's  lawyer,  the right  to be  heard  according  to law.   A  judge  shall not  initiate,  permit,  or 
consider  ex  parte  communications  or  other  communications  made  to  the  judge  outside  the 
presence of the parties between the judge and a party, an attorney, a guardian or attorney ad litem, 
an alternative dispute resolution neutral, or any other court appointee concerning the merits of a 
pending or impending judicial proceeding.  A judge shall require compliance with this subsection 
by court personnel subject to the judge's direction and control.  This subsection does not prohibit: 

a)    communications  concerning  uncontested  administrative  or  uncontested  procedural 
matters; 

b)  conferring separately with the parties and/or their lawyers in an effort to mediate or settle 
matters, provided, however, that the judge shall first give notice to all parties and not thereafter 
hear any contested matters between the parties except with the consent of all parties;

(c)  obtaining the advice of a disinterested expert on the law applicable to a proceeding before 
the judge if the judge gives notice to the parties of the person consulted and the substance of 
the advice, and affords the parties reasonable opportunity to respond; 

10)   A  judge  shall  abstain  from  public  comment  about  a  pending  or  impending  proceeding 
which may come before the judge's court in a manner which suggests to a reasonable person the 
judge's probable decision on any particular case.  This prohibition applies to any candidate for 
judicial office, with respect to judicial proceedings pending or impending in the court on which 
the candidate would serve if elected. A judge shall require similar abstention on the part of court 
personnel subject to the judge's direction and control.  This section does not prohibit judges from 
making  public  statements  in  the  course  of  their  official  duties  or  from  explaining  for  public 
information the procedures of the court.  This section does not apply to proceedings in which the 
judge or judicial candidate is a litigant in a personal capacity. 

11)   A judge shall not disclose or use, for any purpose unrelated to judicial duties, nonpublic 
information acquired in a judicial capacity.   The discussions, votes, positions taken, and writings 
of appellate judges and court personnel about causes are confidences of the court and shall  be 
revealed only through a court's judgment, a written opinion or in accordance with Supreme Court 
guidelines for a court approved history project. 

.     Administrative Responsibilities. 

  C

1)   A judge should diligently and promptly discharge the judge's administrative responsibilities 
without bias or prejudice and maintain professional competence in judicial administration,  and 
should cooperate with other judges and court officials in the administration of court business. 

A  judge  should  require  staff,  court  officials  and  others  subject  to  the  judge's  direction 
2) 
and control to observe the standards of fidelity and diligence that apply to the judge and to refrain 
from manifesting bias or prejudice in the performance of their official duties. 

3) 
A  judge with  supervisory  authority  for  the judicial performance  of other  judges  should 
take  reasonable  measures  to  assure  the  prompt  disposition  of  matters  before  them  and  the 
proper performance of their other judicial responsibilities. 

4)     A judge shall not make unnecessary appointments. A judge shall exercise the power of 
appointment impartially and on the basis of merit. A judge shall avoid nepotism and favoritism. 
A  judge  shall  not  approve  compensation  of  appointees  beyond  the  fair  value  of  services 
rendered. 

5)     A  judge  shall  not  fail  to  comply  with  Rule 12  of  the  Rules  of  Judicial  Administration, 
knowing that the failure to comply is in violation of the rule. 

3 

d)  consulting with other judges or with court personnel; 

e)   considering an ex parte communication expressly authorized by law. 

9)     A judge should dispose of all judicial matters promptly, efficiently and fairly.

.     Disciplinary Responsibilities. 

1)     A judge who receives information clearly establishing that another judge has committed a 
violation of this Code should take appropriate action.   A judge having knowledge that another 
judge has committed a violation of this Code that raises a substantial question as to the other judge's 
fitness for office shall inform the State Commission on Judicial Conduct or take other appropriate 
action. 

2)     A  judge  who  receives  information  clearly  establishing  that  a  lawyer  has  committed  a 
violation  of  the  Texas  Disciplinary  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  should  take  appropriate 
action.    A  judge  having  knowledge  that  a  lawyer  has  committed  a  violation  of  the  Texas 
Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct that raises a substantial question as to the lawyer's 
honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects shall inform the Office of the 
General Counsel of the State Bar of Texas or take other appropriate action. 
 

COMMENT 

t is not a violation of Canon 3B(8) for a judge presiding in a statutory specialty court, as 
defined in Texas Government Code section 121.001, to initiate, permit, or consider any ex 
parte communications in a matter pending in that court.  

anon 4: Conducting the Judge's Extra-Judicial Activities to Minimize the Risk of 

Conflict with Judicial Obligations 

.      Extra-Judicial  Activities  in  General.   A  judge  shall  conduct  all  of  the  judge's  extra- 

judicial activities so that they do not: 

1)     cast reasonable doubt on the judge's capacity to act impartially as a judge; or 

2)     interfere with the proper performance of judicial duties. 

.      Activities to Improve the Law.  A judge may: 

1)     speak, write, lecture, teach and participate in extra-judicial activities concerning the law, the 
legal system, the administration of justice and non-legal subjects, subject to the requirements of 
this Code; and, 

2)     serve  as  a  member,  officer,  or  director  of  an  organization  or  governmental  agency 
devoted to the improvement of the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice.  A judge 
may assist such an organization in raising funds and may participate in their management and 
investment, but should not personally participate in public fund raising activities.  He or she may 
make recommendations to public and private fund-granting agencies on  projects  and  programs 
concerning the law, the legal system and the administration of justice. 

.      Civic  or  Charitable  Activities. A  judge  may  participate  in  civic  and  charitable 
activities  that  do  not  reflect  adversely  upon  the  judge's  impartiality  or  interfere  with  the 
performance  of  judicial  duties.  A  judge may  serve as  an  officer,  director,  trustee  or  non-legal

advisor of an educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, or civic organization not conducted for 
the profit of its members, subject to the following limitations: 

1) 
A  judge  should  not  serve  if  it  is  likely  that  the  organization  will  be  engaged  in 
proceedings  that  would  ordinarily  come  before  the  judge  or  will  be  regularly  or  frequently 
engaged in adversary proceedings in any court. 

2)     A judge shall not solicit funds for any educational, religious, charitable, fraternal or civic 
organization, but may be listed as an officer, director, delegate, or trustee of such an organization, 
and may be a speaker or a guest of honor at an organization's fund raising events. 

3)     A judge should not give investment advice to such an organization, but may serve on its 
board  of  directors  or  trustees  even  though  it  has  the  responsibility  for  approving  investment 
decisions. 

.     Financial Activities. 

1) 
A judge shall refrain from financial and business dealings that tend to reflect adversely 
on the judge's impartiality, interfere with the proper performance of the judicial duties, exploit his 
or  her  judicial  position,  or  involve  the  judge  in  frequent  transactions  with  lawyers  or persons 
likely to come before the court on which the judge serves.  This limitation does not prohibit either 
a judge or candidate from soliciting funds for appropriate campaign or officeholder expenses as 
permitted by state law. 

2)     Subject   to   the   requirements   of   subsection   (1),   a   judge   may   hold   and   manage 
investments,  including  real  estate,  and  engage  in  other  remunerative  activity  including  the 
operation  of  a  business.   A  judge  shall  not  be  an  officer,  director  or  manager  of  a  publicly 
owned  business.    For  purposes  of  this  Canon,  a  "publicly  owned  business"  is  a  business 
having more than ten owners who are not related to the judge by consanguinity or affinity within 
the third degree of relationship. 

3)     A  judge  should  manage  any  investments  and  other  economic  interests  to  minimize  the 
number  of  cases in  which  the judge is  disqualified.    As  soon  as  the  judge can do  so  without 
serious financial detriment, the judge should divest himself or herself of investments and other 
economic  interests  that  might  require  frequent  disqualification.   A  judge  shall  be  informed 
about the judge's personal and fiduciary economic interests, and make a reasonable effort to be 
informed  about  the  personal  economic  interests  of any  family member  residing  in  the  judge's 
household. 

4)     Neither  a  judge  nor  a  family  member  residing  in  the  judge's  household  shall  accept  a 
gift, bequest, favor, or loan from anyone except as follows: 

a)     a judge may accept a gift incident to a public testimonial to the judge; books and other 
resource  materials  supplied  by  publishers  on  a  complimentary  basis  for  official  use;  or  an 
invitation  to  the  judge  and  spouse  to  attend  a  bar-related  function  or  activity  devoted  to  the 
improvement of the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice; 

b)     a judge or a family member residing in the judge's household may accept ordinary social

hospitality; a gift, bequest, favor, or loan from a relative; a gift from a friend for a special occasion 
such as a wedding, engagement, anniversary, or birthday, if the gift is fairly commensurate with 
the occasion and the relationship; a loan from a lending institution in its regular course of business 
on the same terms generally available to persons who are not judges; or a scholarship or fellowship 
awarded on the same terms applied to other applicants; 

c)     a judge or a family member residing in the judge's household may accept any other gift, 
bequest, favor, or loan only if the donor is not a party or person whose interests have come or are 
likely to come before the judge; 

d) 
a gift, award or benefit incident to the business, profession or other separate activity of a 
spouse  or  other  family  member  residing  in  the  judge's  household, including  gifts,  awards  and 
benefits for the use of both the spouse or other family member and the judge (as spouse or family 
member),  provided  the  gift,  award  or  benefit  could  not  reasonably  be  perceived  as intended 
to influence the judge in the performance of judicial duties. 

.      Fiduciary Activities. 

1)     A  judge  shall  not  serve  as  executor,  administrator  or  other  personal  representative, 
trustee, guardian,  attorney  in fact  or  other  fiduciary,  except  for  the  estate,  trust  or  person  of  a 
member of the judge's family, and then only if such service will not interfere with the proper 
performance of judicial duties. 

2)     A judge shall not serve as a fiduciary if it is likely that the judge as a fiduciary will be 
engaged  in  proceedings  that would  ordinarily  come  before  the  judge, or  if the  estate,  trust,  or 
ward becomes involved in adversary proceedings in the court on which the judge serves or one 
under its appellate jurisdiction. 

3)     The same restrictions on financial activities that apply to a judge personally also apply to the 
judge while acting in a fiduciary capacity. 

.     Service as Arbitrator or Mediator. An active full-time judge shall not act as an arbitrator 
or mediator for compensation outside the judicial system, but a judge may encourage settlement 
in the performance of official duties. 

.     Practice  of  Law.   A  judge  shall  not practice  law  except  as permitted  by  statute  or this 
Code. Notwithstanding this prohibition, a judge may act pro se and may, without compensation, 
give legal advice to and draft or review documents for a member of the judge's family. 

.        Extra-Judicial  Appointments.  Except  as  otherwise  provided  by  constitution  and 
statute, a judge should not accept appointment to a governmental committee, commission, or other 
position that is concerned with issues of fact or policy on matters other than the improvement of 
the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice. A judge, however, may represent his or 
her  country,  state,  or  locality  on  ceremonial  occasions  or  in  connection  with  historical, 
educational, and cultural activities.

This change is to clarify that a judge may serve on the Texas Board of Criminal Justice. 

.       Compensation, Reimbursement and Reporting. 

1)   Compensation and Reimbursement. A judge may receive compensation and reimbursement 
of expenses for the extra-judicial activities permitted by this Code, if the source of such payments 
does not give the appearance of influencing the judge's performance of judicial duties or otherwise 
give the appearance of impropriety. 

Compensation shall not exceed a reasonable amount nor shall it exceed what a person 

a) 
who is not a judge would receive for the same activity. 

b) 
Expense reimbursement shall be limited to the actual cost of travel, food, and lodging 
reasonably incurred by the judge and, where appropriate to the occasion, by the judge's family.  
Any payment in excess of such an amount is compensation. 

2)     Public Reports.  A judge shall file financial and other reports as required by law. 

anon 5: Refraining from Inappropriate Political Activity 

1)     A judge or judicial candidate shall not: 

(i)   make pledges or promises of conduct in office regarding pending or impending cases, 
specific classes of cases, specific classes of litigants, or specific propositions of law that would 
suggest to a reasonable person that the judge is predisposed to a probable decision in cases 
within the scope of the pledge; 

(ii)  knowingly  or  recklessly  misrepresent  the  identity,  qualifications,  present  position,  or 

other fact concerning the candidate or an opponent; or 

(iii)   make a statement that would violate Canon 3B(10). 

2) 
A  judge  or  judicial  candidate  shall  not  authorize  the  public  use  of  his  or  her  name 
endorsing another candidate for any public office, except that either may indicate support for a 
political party.  A judge or judicial candidate may attend political events and express his or her 
views on political matters in accord with this Canon and Canon 3B(10). 

3)    A judge shall resign from judicial office upon becoming a candidate in a contested election 
for a non-judicial office either in a primary or in a general or in a special election.  A judge may 
continue to hold judicial office while being a candidate for election to or serving as a delegate in 
a state constitutional convention or while being a candidate for election to any judicial office. 

4)     A judge or judicial  candidate subject to the Judicial Campaign Fairness Act, Tex. Elec. 
Code §253.151, et seq. (the “Act”), shall not knowingly commit an act for which he or she knows 
the  Act  imposes  a  penalty.    Contributions  returned  in  accordance  with  Sections 
253.155(e), 253.157(b) or 253.160(b) of the Act are not a violation of this paragraph.

A.     Construction. 
 

The Code of Judicial Conduct is intended to establish basic standards for ethical conduct of 
judges. It  consists  of  specific  rules  set  forth  in  Sections  under  broad  captions  called Canons. 
 

The  Sections  are rules  of reason,  which  should  be applied  consistent  with  constitutional 
requirements,  statutes,  other  court  rules  and  decisional  law  and  in  the  context  of  all  relevant 
circumstances. The Code is to be construed so as not to impinge on the essential independence of 
judges in making judicial decisions. 
 

The Code is designed to provide guidance to judges and candidates for judicial office and 
to provide a structure for regulating conduct through the State Commission on Judicial Conduct.  
It is not designed or intended as a basis for civil liability or criminal prosecution. Furthermore, 
the purpose of the Code would be subverted if the Code were invoked by lawyers for mere tactical 
advantage in a proceeding. 
 

It  is  not  intended,  however,  that  every  transgression  will  result  in  disciplinary  action. 
Whether disciplinary action is appropriate, and the degree of discipline to be imposed, should be 
determined through a reasonable and reasoned application of the text and should depend on such 
factors as the seriousness of the transgression, whether there is a pattern of improper activity and 
the effect of the improper activity on others or on the judicial system. 

"Shall"  or  "shall  not"  denotes  binding  obligations  the  violation  of  which  can  result  in 

"Should" or "should not" relates to aspirational goals and as a statement of what is or is 

2) 
not appropriate conduct but not as a binding rule under which a judge may be disciplined. 

"May" denotes permissible discretion or, depending on the context, refers to action that is 

3) 
not covered by specific proscriptions. 

"De minimis" denotes an insignificant interest that could not raise reasonable question as 

4) 
to a judge's impartiality. 

5)     "Economic  interest"  denotes  ownership  of  a  more  than  de  minimis  legal  or  equitable 
interest, or a relationship as officer, director, advisor or other active participant in the affairs of a 
party, except that: 

(i)  ownership of an interest in a mutual or common investment fund that holds securities 
is  not  an  economic  interest  in  such  securities  unless  the  judge  participates  in  the 
management  of the  fund  or  a  proceeding  pending  or  impending  before  the  judge  could 
substantially affect the value of the interest; 

(ii) service  by  a  judge  as  an  officer,  director,  advisor  or  other  active  participant,  in  an 
educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, or civic organization or service by a judge's 
spouse, parent or child as an officer, director, advisor or other active participant in any

organization does not create an economic interest in securities held by that organization; 

(iii)  a  deposit  in  a  financial  institution,  the  proprietary  interest  of  a  policy  holder  in  a 
mutual insurance company, of a depositor in a mutual savings association or of a member 
in  a  credit  union,  or  a  similar  proprietary  interest,  is  not  an  economic  interest  in  the 
organization  unless  a  proceeding  pending  or  impending  before  the  judge  could 
substantially affect the value of the interest; and 

(iv) ownership of government securities is not an economic interest in the issuer unless a 
proceeding pending or impending before the judge could substantially affect the value of 
the securities. 

6)     "Fiduciary" includes such relationships as executor, administrator, trustee, and guardian.  
(7)     "Knowingly," "knowledge," "known" or "knows" denotes actual knowledge of the fact 
in question.  A person's knowledge may be inferred from circumstances. 

8)     "Law" denotes court rules as well as statutes, constitutional provisions and decisional law. 

"Member of the judge's (or the candidate's) family" denotes a spouse, child, grandchild, 
9) 
parent, grandparent or other relative or person with whom the candidate maintains a close familial 
relationship. 

10)   "Family  member  residing  in  the  judge's  household"  means  any  relative  of  a  judge  by 
blood or marriage, or a person treated by a judge as a member of the judge's family, who resides 
at the judge's household. 

11)   "Require." The rules prescribing that a judge "require" certain conduct of others are, like all 
of the rules in this Code, rules of reason.   The use of the term "require" in that context means 
a judge is to exercise reasonable direction and control over the conduct of those persons subject to 
the judge's direction and control. 

12)   "Third  degree  of  relationship."  The  following  persons  are  relatives  within  the  third 
degree of relationship: great-grandparent, grandparent, parent, uncle, aunt, brother, sister, child, 
grandchild, great-grandchild, nephew or niece. 

13)  "Retired Judge" means a person who receives from the Texas Judicial Retirement System, 
Plan One or Plan Two, an annuity based on service that was credited to the system. (Secs. 831.001 
and 836.001,  V.T.C.A. Government Code [Ch. 179, Sec. 1, 71st Legislature (1989)] 

14)   "Senior  Judge"  means  a  retired  appellate  or  district  judge  who  has  consented  to  be 
subject to assignment pursuant to Section 75.001, Government Code. [Ch. 359, 69th Legislature, 
Reg. Session (1985)] 

15)  "Statutory County Court Judge" means the judge of a county court created by the legislature 
under Article V, Section 1, of the Texas Constitution, including county courts at law, statutory 
probate courts, county criminal courts, county criminal courts of appeals, and county civil courts 
at law. (Sec. 21.009, V.T.C.A. Government Code [Ch. 2, Sec. 16.01(18), 
71st Legislature (1989)])

16.01(18), 71st Legislature (1989)]) 

17)   "Part-time" means service on a continuing or periodic basis, but with permission by law to 
devote time to some other profession or occupation and for which the compensation for that reason 
is less than that for full-time service.
