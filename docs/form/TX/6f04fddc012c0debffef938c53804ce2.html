      <pre>WORK AND LEAVE TIME POLICIES FOR THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS*

*This section outlines work time requirements and leave benefits for Court of Criminal Appeals
(Court) employees.  Leave allowances and policies are subject to change to conform with the law
and policy of the State.  More detailed information about state law and policy is available at
http://www.hr.sao.texas.gov/. 

1.  Regular Work Hours

Location

The Court and all Court employees’ offices are located in the capitol complex in Austin. 
An employee’s work shall be conducted at the Court.  See TEX. GOV’T CODE § 658.010.  Travel
to and from the Court offices is not considered work time.  TEX. GOV’T CODE § 605.002.  With
prior written authorization from the Presiding Judge of the Court, an employee may work
elsewhere or from home.  See TEX. GOV’T CODE § 658.010.  With prior authorization of an
employee’s supervisor, attendance at an approved continuing legal education (MCLE) course or
other approved education course during regular work hours is considered hours worked.  See
State Bar Rules, Article XII (governing requirement of MCLE for attorneys).  

Supervisor

Work Hours

For the purpose of these policies, the term “supervisor” refers to the person who is

authorized to sign or approve an employee’s time sheet. 

The Court Clerk’s Office shall be open to the public and maintain work hours from 8:00
a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, unless the Court is closed for a holiday or emergency
situation.  See TEX. GOV’T CODE § 658.005.  Each judge may establish regular work hours for his
or her chambers.  Regular work hours for staff members not assigned to a particular chambers are
8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, unless the Court is closed.  With prior
authorization of an employee’s supervisor, an employee may work on flex-time and may receive
time credit for working through lunch.  Flex-time is a system allowing flexibility of working
hours at the beginning and end of the day.  Such variations in schedules are privileges, subject to
revision or modification for any reason and at any time, at the discretion of the employee’s
supervisor.

All employees paid a full-time salary shall work not less than forty (40) hours per week. 
TEX. GOV’T CODE § 658.002.  The work week begins at 12:00 a.m. on Sunday and ends at 11:59
p.m. on the following Saturday. 

Documentation

Employees will complete a monthly time sheet accounting for all leave taken and forward
it to their supervisor for approval.  Approved timesheets will be entered by the Court accountant

1

into the official system adopted by the comptroller for documenting and tracking employee leave
(currently the CAPPS system).  See TEX. GOV’T CODE § 2101.042. 

Lunch and Breaks

One hour is allowed for lunch.  Generally, a lunch break is taken from noon to 1:00 p.m. 

However, the employees of the Clerk’s Office are to coordinate their schedules so that at least
one person is on duty to accept calls, receive visitors, and transact business from noon to 1:00
p.m.  See TEX. GOV’T CODE § 658.005.  Without prior approval from an employee’s supervisor, 
an employee should not take the lunch hour at the start or the end of the day.  Also, employees
should not take a lunch hour that is less than one hour as a justification for an unauthorized
tardiness or an unauthorized early departure from the workplace.  

Employees may take a 15-minute break in the morning and a 15-minute break in the

afternoon.  Rest breaks cannot be accrued or accumulated to justify an unauthorized tardiness,
extend a lunch break, or shorten the work day.

2.  Overtime and Compensatory Time

Most of the employees of the Court are either excluded from the Fair Labor Standards

Act of 1938 (FLSA) or are Exempt Employees under its provisions.  See 29 U.S.C. § 201, et seq. 
If an employee has a question about his or her status under the FLSA, he or she should contact
the Court accountant.

Excluded and Exempt Employees

Employees will be allowed compensatory time off for any hours recorded in excess of 40

during a work week, which excess hours were authorized in advance by the employee’s
supervisor.  Work hours may be a combination of paid leave, holidays, and actual hours worked. 
The compensatory time earned must be taken within the 12-month period following the end of
the work week in which the excess hours were accrued or it expires.  TEX. GOV’T CODE §
659.016.  Compensatory time is accrued at a rate of one hour for each hour worked.  Id. 
Employees will not be paid for any unused, unexpired compensatory time.

Employees must give reasonable advance notice to their supervisor before taking

compensatory time off.

Non-Exempt Employees

Overtime eligibility for non-exempt employees is governed by the provisions of the

FLSA.  See TEX. GOV’T CODE §§ 659.015; see also 29 U.S.C. § 201, et seq.  Time worked in
addition to an employee’s regular 40-hour work schedule may be credited as overtime or
compensatory time depending on whether the employee:

1.
2.

is designated as non-exempt; and 
has actually worked 40 hours during the week or has taken any leave during the week.

2

Non-exempt employees must obtain approval from the Presiding Judge prior to working

over 40 hours in a week.  If such time is approved, then the compensatory time must be taken
within the 12-month period following the end of the work week in which the excess hours were
accrued or it expires.  TEX. GOV’T CODE § 659.015.  Working over 40 hours without prior
approval from the Presiding Judge may be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including
termination. 

3.  Holidays

The State recognizes three types of holidays:  national, state, and optional.  See TEX.

GOV’T CODE § 662.003.  Eligible employees are entitled to a paid day off from work on national
and state holidays as specified by the Legislature.  See TEX. GOV’T CODE § 662.005.  That is,
employees are entitled to a paid day off from work on a specified holiday if the holiday does not
fall on a Saturday or Sunday, and the employee is not on leave without pay.  

The Court will have a sufficient number of employees on duty during a state holiday

(skeleton crew day) to conduct the public business of the agency except for those state holidays
which fall on a Saturday or Sunday, the Friday after Thanksgiving Day, or December 24th and
26th.  TEX. GOV’T CODE § 662.004.  Employees who must work on a skeleton crew day will
accrue holiday compensatory time, which they may take during the 12-month period following
the date of the holiday worked.  TEX. GOV’T CODE § 662.007.  Holiday compensatory time not
taken within that 12-month period will expire.

An eligible employee is also entitled to a paid day off from work on an optional holiday if

the employee agrees to give up (i.e., to work on) a state holiday (skeleton crew day) during the
same fiscal year.  See TEX. GOV’T CODE § 662.006.  Before taking an optional holiday, an
employee must notify in writing his or her supervisor and the Court accountant of the optional
holiday he or she intends to take and the state holiday he or she intends to work.  This notice
should be given before either holiday occurs.  If the employee thereafter fails to work the
skeleton crew day, the employee will be charged a day of vacation leave.  If vacation leave is not
available, he or she will be charged a day of leave without pay.

4.  Bad Weather Policy 

Employees of the Court of Criminal Appeals are not expected to come to work when

weather and road conditions between their home and the Court present a direct threat to life and
personal property.

If the Austin Independent School District (AISD) closes its schools due to extreme

weather, all Court employees should work regular hours from home. If AISD starts later in the
day due to weather conditions, all Court employees should work regular Court hours from home
with the exception that a skeleton crew will be required in the Clerk’s office, starting at that
later time. That is, if AISD starts two hours late, then the Clerk’s office skeleton crew will be
expected to be at the office and physically open the Court two hours late.

3

If AISD schools remain open during extreme weather, then the Court will be considered

to be open and employees will be expected to report to work. Employees who are unable to
report to work because of extreme weather conditions in the area in which they live will be
expected to use leave time for the time they are out unless other arrangements are made with the
employee’s supervisor. The Presiding Judge may excuse the time an employee is out under
these conditions upon presentation of sufficient documentation of the conditions prompting the
absence.  See TEX. GOV’T CODE § 658.005(c).  

If AISD schools are not in session, then employees should listen to the weather broadcast

of the U.S. Weather Service or an Austin weather station. If the weather service issues an
“extreme travel advisory” for the Austin area and employees cannot reach work due to poor
road conditions, they will be expected to use leave time for the time they are out unless other
arrangements are made with the employee’s supervisor. The Presiding Judge may excuse the
time that an employee is out under these conditions upon presentation of sufficient
documentation of the conditions prompting the absence.  See id.  However, employees are
expected to report to work as soon as the travel advisory is canceled.

Only the Presiding Judge is authorized to close the Court of Criminal Appeals for all or

part of the day.  Employees are instructed to verify when the office will be open and to report to
work promptly.  

Employees should not submit leave forms and need not request emergency leave for

absences due to official closings (inclement weather, fire, flood, toxic fumes, etc.).  See TEX.
GOV’T CODE § 661.902(c).  If an employee cannot confirm an office closing, and reports to
work and remains on duty, the employee may be granted compensatory leave to use at a later
date, at his or her supervisor’s discretion.

5.  Absences from Work

Court employees should obtain prior approval from their supervisor for all leave
requested.  Leave approval is not automatic.  While every attempt is made to accommodate an
employee’s timely request, supervisors have the authority and responsibility to use their
discretion to ensure that adequate staff remains on duty to perform the Court’s work.  When an
employee is unable to report for work and prior approval for the absence has not been obtained,
the employee is to, at the earliest practicable time, notify (or have someone else notify) his or
her supervisor that the employee is unable to report for duty.  Absenteeism or tardiness is
excessive when an employee is unable to adequately perform his or her job or when the normal
work activities of the Court or a section of the Court are disrupted because of the excessive
and/or unscheduled absences or tardiness of the employee.  Absenteeism or tardiness may be
grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

6.  Leave Increments

Leave will be charged in fifteen minute increments. Absences of less than fifteen minutes

will be made up by mutual agreement between an employee and his or her supervisor. 

4

7.  Annual Vacation Leave

Vacation leave is accumulated monthly at a rate set by the Legislature.  The Legislature
also sets the maximum number of hours of vacation leave that may be carried from the end of
one fiscal year (August 31) to the beginning of the next (September 1).  The current schedule is
as follows:

Schedule of Vacation Leave Accruals for Full Time Employees

Length of Service

Hours Accrued
per Month
Less than 2 years                                        8                            12.0                             180
At least 2 but less than 5 years                  9                            13.5                             244

Days Accrued

At least 5 but less than 10 years               10                           15.0                             268

At least 10 but less than 15 years             11                           16.5                             292

At least 15 but less than 20 years             13                           19.5                             340

At least 20 but less than 25 years             15                           22.5                             388

At least 25 but less than 30 years             17                           25.5                             436

At least 30 but less than 35 years             19                           28.5                             484

At least 35 years or more                          21                           31.5                             532

See TEX. GOV’T CODE §§ 661.152.

Employees accrue vacation leave from their first day of employment.  However, vacation
with pay may not be taken until the employee has been continuously employed with the state for
six months.  Id.  If an employee takes a full calendar month of leave without pay, that month is
not counted toward:

3. continuous state service for purposes related to vacation leave or merit raises;
4. total state service credit for purposes of leave accrual; or
5. total state service for purposes of longevity pay.

Employees will normally be permitted to take vacation leave when they request it,
provided that it does not disrupt Court activities.  Vacation leave requests should be submitted
to an employee’s supervisor in advance of the date the leave is scheduled to begin.

At the end of the fiscal year, all hours of unused accumulated vacation leave over an

employee’s maximum allowable carryover (based on longevity) will be credited to the
employee’s sick leave balance as of the first day of the next fiscal year.  An employee who
retires is entitled to service credit in the Employees Retirement System for the employee’s
vacation leave that has accumulated and is unused on the last day of employment pursuant to
the rules of the Employee’s Retirement System of Texas (ERS).  

5

8.  Sick Leave

Employees accrue sick leave at the rate of eight hours per month or fraction of a month. 

TEX. GOV’T CODE § 661.202.  Sick leave with pay may be taken when an employee is
prevented from performing his or her duties because of sickness, injury, or pregnancy and
confinement.  Id.  Sick leave may also be taken if an employee needs to care for a member of
his or her immediate family who is ill.  Id.  “Immediate family” in this instance is defined as
individuals related by kinship, adoption, or marriage who live in the same household; foster
children who reside in the same household; and the employee’s minor children, regardless of
whether they live in the same household.  TEX. GOV’T CODE § 661.202(d).  

Sick leave may be used to care for immediate family members who do not reside in the

same household only for a documented medical condition.  “Immediate family” in this
circumstance is defined as a spouse, child, or parent.  See TEX. GOV’T CODE § 661.202(e).  Sick
leave is not a substitute for vacation, compensatory, or holiday compensatory leave.

When an employee is unable to report to work as a result of illness or a health care
appointment, the employee, at the earliest practicable time, is to notify (or have someone else
notify) his or her supervisor that the employee is unable to report for duty.  

If an employee is ill and will miss work for a continuous period of more than three
working days, the employee must provide to the Presiding Judge (with notice to his or her
supervisor) a doctor’s certificate or an acceptable written statement of facts showing the nature
of the illness. If an illness results in the absence of three working days or less, the Presiding
Judge has the discretion to require documentation of the illness.  See TEX. GOV’T CODE §
661.202(g).

An employee may use up to eight hours of sick leave each fiscal year to attend
educational activities for the employee’s children who are in pre-kindergarten through 12th
grade.  TEX. GOV’T CODE § 661.206.

An employee who retires is entitled to service credit in ERS for the employee’s sick leave

that has accumulated and is unused on the last day of employment.  ERS rules will apply to
determine the amount of credit.  The employee is not entitled to payment for the unused sick
leave.

9.  Extended Sick Leave

An employee who exhausts his or her other accrued leave, but is not experiencing a
condition or illness that rises to the level required to qualify for sick pool time (described
below) may request extended sick leave time.  To request extended sick leave time, an
employee must submit a written request for such exception to his or her supervisor.  The
request should be for no more than 60 days.  The supervisor will review the request and may
ask for additional information prior to submitting the request to the Presiding Judge.  The
Presiding Judge may authorize such an exception to sick leave on an individual basis after
reviewing the merits and circumstances of each request.  See TEX. GOV’T CODE § 661.202(i)
and (j).  

6

Any interaction this time might have with disability leave should be discussed with the

Court accountant.  This policy is in addition to rights conferred by the Federal Family and
Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) (29 U.S.C. §§ 2601-2619, 2651-2654).

10.  Sick Leave Pool

The Court has established a Sick Leave Pool to allow agency employees to voluntarily

transfer earned sick leave to the pool.  See TEX. GOV’T CODE § 661.002.  Contributions of sick
leave must be in increments of eight hours with the exception of a retiring state employee who
may contribute accrued sick leave in increments of less than eight hours.  TEX. GOV’T CODE §
661.003.  To contribute time to the sick leave pool, an employee must submit an application to
the Court accountant.  

The sick leave pool is intended to help employees and their families if a catastrophic

illness or injury forces an employee to exhaust all leave time earned by that employee. 
“Catastrophic” is defined as a severe condition or combination of conditions affecting the
mental or physical health of the employee or a member of the employee’s immediate family that
requires the services of a licensed practitioner for a prolonged period of time, forces the
employee to exhaust all leave time earned by that employee, and would force the employee to
lose compensation from the State if the leave was not granted.  A “licensed practitioner” means
a practitioner, as defined in the Texas Insurance Code, who is practicing within the scope of his
or her license.  

An employee is eligible to use the time contributed to the sick leave pool if the employee
has exhausted all the sick leave time to which that employee is otherwise entitled because of (1)
a catastrophic illness or injury, or (2) a previous donation of time to the pool.  TEX. GOV’T
CODE § 661.004.  Awards of sick-leave-pool time must be authorized by the Presiding Judge. 
Applications for sick-leave-pool time are to be submitted by written request to the employee’s
supervisor, which request must include a written statement from the licensed practitioner
treating the employee or the employee’s immediate family member.  See TEX. GOV’T CODE §
661.005.  The employee’s supervisor will review the request and may ask for additional
information prior to submitting the request to the Presiding Judge.  An employee may not
withdraw sick leave time from the pool in an amount that exceeds the lesser of one-third of the
total time in the pool or 90 days.  TEX. GOV’T CODE § 661.006.  An employee using sick-leave-
pool time will still accrue annual and sick leave at the beginning of each month, but the leave
will not be credited until the first day the employee returns to duty.

This policy does not apply to employees injured on the job.  Those employees should

utilize workers’ compensation benefits.  This policy also does not apply to pregnancy,
childbirth, and related conditions which occur under routine or normal conditions.  See FMLA
leave.  Any interaction this time might have with disability leave should be discussed with the
Court accountant. 

11.  Specific Donation of Sick Leave

State employees may voluntarily transfer any amount of their accrued sick leave to

7

another state employee within the same agency.  TEX. GOV’T CODE § 661.207.  To be eligible
to receive such a transfer, the receiving employee must have exhausted all of his or her
available sick leave, including any time the receiving employee is eligible to withdraw from the
sick leave pool.  Id.

An employee may not provide or receive remuneration or a gift in exchange for donated

sick leave.  Id.  An employee who receives donated sick leave must use that sick leave in the
same manner as accrued sick leave.  Id.  The recipient employee will not receive credit in ERS
for any donated sick leave that is unused on the last day of the recipient employee’s
employment.  Id.

12.  Family and Medical Leave

This policy incorporates the major provisions of the FMLA. 

Eligibility

Employees with at least 12 months of full-time employment and who have provided at
least 1,250 hours of service during the 12 months preceding the beginning of the leave period
described in this section are eligible to take up to 12 weeks of leave per year for the following
reasons:

•
•

the birth of a child or the placement for adoption or foster care of a child;
the serious health condition of a spouse, child, or parent (such health condition must meet
the conditions of a “serious health condition” under the FMLA, see 29 U.S.C. §
2611(11)); or

• an employee’s own serious health condition.

TEX. GOV’T CODE § 661.912; 29 U.S.C. § 2612. 

These provisions apply equally to male and female employees.  The employee must first use

all available paid vacation and sick leave while taking leave under this section unless the
employee is receiving temporary disability or workers’ compensation benefits.  TEX. GOV’T
CODE § 661.912.

Certification and Notice 

Employees must provide certification explaining the serious health condition on which

the leave request is based.  The certification should detail the date on which the condition
began; the probable duration of the condition; appropriate medical facts regarding the
condition; if appropriate, a statement that the employee is needed to care for a spouse, parent, or
child; or a statement that the employee’s own health condition makes it impossible for him or
her to work.  See 29 U.S.C. § 2613. 

The Court may require a second medical opinion, at the Court’s expense, before granting

leave.  To the extent reasonably possible, an employee must give 30 days’ advance written

8

notice to his or her supervisor and the Court accountant of the need for leave.  Id.

Communications During Family or Medical Leave

Employees on FMLA leave must report periodically during the leave period on their
status and intention to return to work.  This communication will be made to the employee’s
supervisor and to the Court accountant.

Married Employees

If an employee is married to another employee of the Court, the two employees are

limited to a combined total of 12 weeks of leave for the birth or adoption of a child or for the
care of a sick parent or child.  See 29 U.S.C. § 2612. 

Certification for Return to Work

Employees returning from medical leave caused by their own illness may be required to
obtain written medical certification from their health care provider that they are able to resume
work.  This certification should be given to the Court accountant and the employee’s supervisor
on or before the first working day of the employee’s return.  See 29 U.S.C. § 2614. 

13.  Parental Leave

Employees with fewer than 12 months of state service or less than 1,250 hours in the 12

months immediately preceding the start of leave set out in this section are entitled to take a
parental leave of absence, not to exceed 12 weeks per year for the following reasons:

•
•

the birth of a child; or 
the adoption by or foster care placement with the employee of a child younger than three
years of age.

TEX. GOV’T CODE § 661.913. 

These provisions apply equally to male and female employees.  The employee must first

use all available paid vacation and sick leave while taking leave under this section, and the
remainder of the leave is unpaid.  Id.  The leave period begins with the date of the birth, or the
first day the adoptive or foster child is formally placed in the home.  Id.  An employee
anticipating using parental leave should notify his or her supervisor and the Court accountant at

FMLA leave.

31.  Return to Work Policy and Procedures

It is the policy of the Court to provide a return to work program as the means to return
employees to meaningful, productive employment following injury or illness.  In order to
provide the highest level of quality service to the citizens of  Texas, it is necessary for every
employee of the Court to be available for work, ready, and capable of performing the duties and
responsibilities for which the employee was hired.

The return to work program provides opportunities for any employee of this agency who

sustains a compensable injury during the course and scope of employment, a disability as
defined by the ADA, and/or a serious health condition as defined by the FMLA to return to
work at full duty.  If the employee is not physically capable of returning to full duty, the return
to work program provides opportunities when available for the employee to perform a
temporary assignment in which the employee’s regular position is modified to accommodate the
employee’s physical capacities, or to perform an alternate duty position.

This return to work program shall not be construed as recognition by this agency, its
management, or its employees that any employee who participates in the program has a
disability as defined by the ADA.  If an employee sustains an injury or illness that results in a
disability under the ADA, it is the employee’s responsibility to inform his or her supervisor and
the Court accountant when a disability under the ADA exists and that a reasonable
accommodation is necessary to perform the essential functions of his or her job.

Specific procedures shall be provided to guide all employees regarding the return to work
program.  All employees, divisions, and facilities of the Court are expected to support and fully
comply with this policy and the procedures provided to implement this policy.
