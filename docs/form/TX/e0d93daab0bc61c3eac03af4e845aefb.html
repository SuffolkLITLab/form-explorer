Instructions

Important Notice to Property Owner
Carefully read all instructions for this form. It is best to talk to a lawyer before using this form.  For privacy and identity theft 
reasons, you should not put your social security number or driver’s license number on this form.

What Is a Transfer on Death Deed?
A transfer on death deed is a simple, inexpensive way to transfer real estate to someone else upon your death. It does not involve 
going through probate court, which can be a lengthy and costly process.  It works similarly to a life insurance policy or a payable 
on death account at a bank because the asset passes to your named beneficiary upon your death outside the probate system.  

When to Use a Transfer on Death Deed
You may want to use a transfer on death deed when you own real property, such as a house or land, and you want to give that 
property to someone else when you die.  

Things to Know About Using a Transfer on Death Deed 

A transfer on death deed does not affect any of your property rights during your lifetime.  It only takes effect after your
death.  You can sell the property, use it as collateral on a loan, get property tax exemptions, and enjoy all the other prop-
erty rights you currently have.

 ɐ

The named beneficiary has no legal right to the property until your death.  If you decide to sell the property, the
named beneficiary cannot stop you from doing so.  The sale simply “voids” the transfer on death deed and it is as if 
the transfer on death deed never existed.

You can only give someone the portion of the property that you own.  For example, if you and your spouse own the
property in equal shares and you file a transfer on death deed giving the property to someone, like a child or a friend, that
person only gets your share of the property.  Your spouse still has their share.

•

A transfer on death deed trumps a will.

 ɐ

 ɐ

If you have a will that gives the property to someone else, this transfer on death deed “trumps” the will.  The benefi-
ciary named in the transfer on death deed gets the property, not the person named in your will.  If you already have a 
will, it is best to talk to an attorney about the pros and cons of using a transfer on death deed.  

If you make a will at some point in the future that gives the property to a different person than the beneficiary listed 
in this transfer on death deed, that provision does not override the deed.  The beneficiary named in this transfer on 
death deed still gets the property.  If you change your mind about who you want to get the property, you need to 
complete the cancellation of transfer on death deed or file an updated transfer on death deed.

A transfer on death deed does not protect the property from creditor claims.  You may use a transfer on death deed even
if there is a debt or lien, such as a mortgage, against the property.  However, upon your death, your beneficiary takes the
property subject to all mortgages, liens and claims and will be responsible for paying those debts on the property.  Also, if
the property owner dies and has other unpaid debts, the property could be tied up in probate court until those debts are
resolved.

Texas Transfer Toolkit  |  Transfer on Death DeedDo not file this page•  The transfer on death deed beneficiary must survive you by at least 120 hours. If not, the property is treated as if the 

transfer on death deed did not exist.

•  A transfer on death deed cannot be created by a person acting under a property owner’s power of attorney, however, that 

person can cancel the transfer on death deed.  

Required

public.

•  Must Sign in Front of a Notary:  Do not sign or date the transfer on death deed until you are standing in front of a notary 

•  Must Record Transfer on Death Deed Before Your Death:  You must record (file) this deed before your death with the 

county clerk where the property is located or it will not be effective. 

1.  Property Owner (Transferor) Making this Deed:  Enter your first, middle (if any), and last name, along with your mailing 

address. Write your name exactly as it appears on the deed you received when you became an owner of the property.  If you 
now go by a different name, write your name as listed on the deed, followed by AKA (also known as) and your current name.  
If more than one person owns the property, each person must do this.

2.  Legal Description of the Property:  Enter the legal description of the property, which is different from the mailing or physical 
address of the property. This information is on the deed you received when you became an owner of the property and is also 
available at the county clerk’s office in the county where the property is located. Do NOT use the legal description listed on 
your property tax bill because it is usually incomplete. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS INFORMATION IS CORRECT.  
If you are not absolutely sure, talk to a lawyer.

3.  Address of the Property:  Enter the physical address of the property.

4.  Primary and Alternate Beneficiaries:  You must check the box for A, B, or C. Check ONLY ONE box and fill in the blanks in 

that section.

•  Fill out Selection A if you are married and you and your spouse own the property together.

•  Fill out Selection B if you are married and you own all or part of the property by yourself (your spouse doesn’t own any 

part of it) AND you want your spouse to get your share of the property.

•  Fill out Selection C if either you are not married OR if you are married and do not want your share of the property to go 

to your spouse.

Each selection (A, B, or C) has three parts:

1.  Primary Beneficiary: A “beneficiary” is the person who will own the property when you die. The primary beneficiary 
is the first person you want to own the property. You can, but are not required to, name more than one person as 
primary beneficiary.

2.  Alternate Beneficiary or Beneficiaries: The alternate beneficiary or beneficiaries are the people you want to own the 

property if the primary beneficiary or beneficiaries die before you do.

3.  Transfer on Death: This section tells how you want your property to pass if all your beneficiaries die before you.

 ɐ

For Selection A and B: 

• 

• 

Initial option (a) if you want the alternate beneficiary or beneficiaries’ living children, grandchildren, or 
great-grandchildren to get your share of the property if that beneficiary dies before you do.

Initial option (b) if you DO NOT want the alternate beneficiary or beneficiaries’ children, grandchildren, or 
great-grandchildren to get your share of the property if that beneficiary dies before you do.

 ɐ

For Selection C, section: 

A.  If at Least One Primary Beneficiary Survives Me: If you name more than one primary beneficiary, this 

section tells what you want to do with your share of the property if one or more primary beneficiaries die 
before you, but one or more are still living.

person’s living children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren.

Initial option (b) if you DO NOT want the deceased primary beneficiary or beneficiaries’ share to go to 
that person’s children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren. This share will be split among the living 
primary beneficiaries.

B.  If NO Primary Beneficiary Survives Me (dies after I do): If my primary beneficiary is my child (or other 

descendant) or my brother or sister (or other descendant of either of my parents) AND all primary benefi-
ciaries die before I do, I grant and convey (give) my share to (choose by writing your initials in ONE blank 
ONLY):

Initial option (a) if you want the deceased primary beneficiary or beneficiaries’ share to go to that 
person’s living children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren.

Initial option (b) if you DO NOT want the deceased primary beneficiary or beneficiaries’ share to go to 
that person’s children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren. The alternate beneficiary or beneficiaries 
will get the share.

C.  If an Alternative Beneficiary Does Not Survive Me: If all your primary beneficiaries and one or more alter-
nate beneficiaries die before you do, this section tells what you want to do with your share of the property.

Initial option (a) if you want the deceased alternate beneficiary or beneficiaries’ shares to go to that 
person’s children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren.

Initial option (b) if you DO NOT want the deceased alternate beneficiary or beneficiaries’ shares to go 
to that person’s children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren. This transfer on death deed will be 
canceled if no primary or alternate beneficiaries are alive when you die.

If you do not initial any section, it will be assumed you chose option (a).

5.  Signature of Property Owner:  This deed must be signed before a notary.  Do not sign your name or enter the date until you 

are in front of a notary. If two people own the property, both need to sign before a notary.  

6.  Acknowledgement: You do not need to fill out anything in this box. The notary will fill it out.

7.  “After Recording, Return to” Section:  Fill in the property owner’s name and address here.  Once the transfer on death deed 
has been recorded, it will be returned to the property owner with the specific information (the volume, page number, and/
or deed number) on where the deed has been recorded in the county clerk’s office so that it can be located later. Keep the 
transfer on death deed in a safe place. 

8.  File the Deed (NOT These Instructions) in the County Clerk’s Office:  

•  Bring Original and One Copy:  Bring the original and at least one copy of the complete and notarized transfer on death 

deed to the County Clerk’s office in the county where the property is located.  

•  Bring Personal Identification:  The county clerk may require you to show personal identification before you file this 

document.

•  Bring Money:  The County Clerk will charge a fee to file the transfer on death deed, which is typically a per page fee.  

Many County Clerks do not accept checks.  You may want to call the County Clerk’s office and find out how much the 
charge will be and whether they accept checks before you go.  Then file the original and ask them to return a copy of the 
original with the recording information on it to the owner.  

•  Do Not File the Instructions: If you file the instructions, it may cause confusion and will also cost you more money.

or other descendants.
___________  (b)  no  one  else.  I  do  not  want  the  deceased  alternate  beneficiary’s  surviving
children  or  other  descendants  to  have  a  share  of  the  property.  If  no  primary  or  alternate
beneficiary is alive when I die, this deed is canceled and has no force and effect, as if it had never
been executed.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
