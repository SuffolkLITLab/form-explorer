════════════════════ 
Misc. Docket No. 21-9061 
════════════════════ 
 
════════════════════════════════════════════════════ 
FINAL APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF AMENDMENTS TO  
THE TEXAS DISCIPLINARY RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT AND  
THE TEXAS RULES OF DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE 
════════════════════════════════════════════════════ 

RDERED that: 

On  September  29,  2020,  in  Misc.  Dkt.  No.  20-9114,  the  Court  submitted  proposed 
amendments  to  the  Texas  Disciplinary  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  and  the  Texas 
Rules of Disciplinary Procedure (“Proposed Rules”) to the State Bar of Texas members 
for  a  referendum.    The  referendum  occurred  between  February  2,  2021,  and  March  4, 
2021.  

On March 5, 2021, the State Bar of Texas Executive Director certified that the Proposed 
Rules were approved by a majority of the votes cast, and, on March 11, 2021, submitted a 
Petition  for  Order  of  Promulgation  (“Petition”)  requesting  the  Court’s  adoption  of  the 
Proposed Rules effective July 1, 2021.  

On  March  15,  2021,  in  Misc.  Dkt.  No.  21-9029,  the  Court  provided  notice  of  public 
deliberations on the Proposed Rules and invited public comment until April 15, 2021.  No 
comments were received. 

On  May  4,  2021,  pursuant  to  Texas  Government  Code  Section  81.08791,  the  Court 
deliberated  on  the  Proposed  Rules  by  Zoom  videoconferencing  and  broadcast  those 
deliberations to YouTube for public viewing. 

Having  considered  the  votes  of  the  State  Bar  of  Texas  members,  the  Petition,  and  the 
presentations and materials submitted at the Court’s public deliberations on May 4, 2021, 
and  pursuant  to  Texas  Government  Code  Sections  81.0879  and  81.08792,  the  Court 
approves and adopts the Proposed Rules, as well as interpretive comments, as set forth in 
this Order, effective July 1, 2021. 

New  Texas  Disciplinary  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  1.16  and  6.05,  amendments  to 
Part VII of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct, and new Texas Rule of 
Disciplinary  Procedure  13.04  are  set  forth  in  clean  form.  Amendments  to  Texas 
Disciplinary  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  1.02,  1.05,  and  8.03,  to  the  comments  to 
Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct 1.03, 1.15, and 4.02, and to Rule 1.06, 
Part III, and Rule 9.01 of the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure are demonstrated in 
redline.

a) Subject to paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e), and (f), and (g), a lawyer shall abide by a client’s 
decisions: 
 

(1) concerning the objectives and general methods of representation; 

b)  A  lawyer  may  limit  the  scope,  objectives  and  general  methods  of  the  representation  if  the 
client consents after consultation. 

c) A lawyer shall  not assist  or counsel  a client  to  engage  in conduct that the lawyer  knows is 
criminal or fraudulent. A lawyer may discuss the legal consequences of any proposed course of 
conduct with a client and may counsel and represent a client in connection with the making of a 
good faith effort to determine the validity, scope, meaning or application of the law. 

d)  When  a  lawyer  has  confidential  information  clearly  establishing  that  a  client  is  likely  to 
commit  a criminal  or fraudulent act  that  is  likely  to  result in  substantial  injury  to  the  financial 
interests  or  property  of  another,  the  lawyer  shall  promptly  make  reasonable  efforts  under  the 
circumstances to dissuade the client from committing the crime or fraud.

committed  a  criminal  or  fraudulent  act  in  the  commission of  which  the  lawyer’s  services  have 
been  used,  the  lawyer  shall  make  reasonable  efforts  under  the  circumstances  to  persuade  the 
client to take corrective action. 

f)  When  a  lawyer  knows  that  a  client  expects  representation  not  permitted  by  the  rules  of 
professional conduct or other law, the lawyer shall consult with the client regarding the relevant 
limitations on the lawyer’s conduct. 

g) A lawyer shall take reasonable action to secure the appointment of a guardian or other legal 
representative for, or seek other protective orders with respect to, a client whenever the lawyer 
reasonably believes that the client lacks legal competence and that such action should be taken to 
protect the client.

2. Paragraph (a) assumes that the lawyer is legally authorized to represent the client. The usual 
attorney-client relationship is established and maintained by consenting adults who possess the 
legal capacity to agree to the relationship. Sometimes the relationship can be established only by 
a legally effective appointment of the lawyer to represent a person. Unless the lawyer is legally 
authorized to act for a person under a disability, an attorney-client relationship does not exist for 
the purpose of this rule. 

3.  If  a  legal  representative  has  already  been  appointed  for  the  client,  the  lawyer  should 
ordinarily look to the representative for decisions on behalf of the client. If a legal representative 
has  not  been  appointed,  paragraph  (g)  requires  a  lawyer  in  some  situations  to  take  protective 
steps,  such  as  initiating  the  appointment  of  a  guardian.  The  lawyer  should  see  to  such 
appointment or take other protective steps when it reasonably appears advisable to do so in order 
to  serve  the  client’s  best  interests.  See  Rule  1.05(c)(4),  d(1)  and  (d)(2)(i)  in  regard  to  the 
lawyer’s right to reveal to the court the facts reasonably necessary to secure the guardianship or 
other protective order.

omment: 

. Ordinarily, the a lawyer should provide to the client information to be provided is that would 
be  appropriate  for  a  client  who  is  a  comprehending  and  responsible  adult.  However,  fully 
informing  the  client  according  to  this  standard  communicating  such  information  may  be 
impractical,  as  for  example,  where  if  the  client  is  a  child  or  suffers  from  mental  disability 
diminished capacity; see paragraph 5 and Rule 1.16. When the client is an organization or group, 
it is often impossible or inappropriate to inform every one of its members about its legal affairs; 
ordinarily,  the  lawyer  should  address  communications  to  the  appropriate  officials  of  the 
organization. See Rule 1.132. Where many routine matters are involved, a system of limited or 
occasional reporting may be arranged with the client. 

Client Under a Disability with Diminished Capacity 

. In addition to communicating If a client appears to suffer from diminished capacity, a lawyer 
should  communicate  with  any  legal  representative,  a  lawyer  should  and  seek  to  maintain 
reasonable  communication  with  a  the  client  under  a  disability,  insofar  as  possible.  When  a 
lawyer  reasonably  believes  a  Even  if  the  client  suffers  a  mental  disability  or  is  not  legally 
competent from diminished capacity, it may not be possible to maintain the usual some aspects 
of  a  normal  attorney-client  relationship.  Nevertheless,  tThe  client  may  have  the  ability  to 
understand, deliberate upon, and reach conclusions about some matters affecting the client’s own 
well-being.  Furthermore,  to  an  increasing  extent  the  law  recognizes  intermediate  degrees  of 
competence.  For  example,  cChildren’s  opinions  regarding  their  own  custody  are  given  some 
weight. The fact that a client suffers a disability does not diminish the desirability of treating the 
client Regardless of whether a client suffers from diminished capacity, a client should always be 
treated with attention and respect. See also Rule 1.02(e)16 and Rule 1.05, Comment 17.

ule 1.05. Confidentiality of Information 

a)  “Confidential  information”  includes  both  “privileged  information”  and  “unprivileged  client 
information.”  “Privileged  information”  refers  to  the  information  of  a  client  protected  by  the 
lawyer-client privilege of Rule 503 of the Texas Rules of Evidence or of Rule 503 of the Texas 
Rules  of  Criminal  Evidence  or  by  the  principles  of  attorney-client  privilege  governed  by  Rule 
501  of the Federal  Rules  of  Evidence  for  United  States  Courts and  Magistrates.  “Unprivileged 
client information” means all information relating to a client or furnished by the client, other than 
privileged  information,  acquired  by  the  lawyer  during  the  course  of  or  by  reason  of  the 
representation of the client. 

b)  Except  as  permitted  by  paragraphs  (c)  and  (d),  or  as  required  by  paragraphs  (e)  and  (f),  a 
lawyer shall not knowingly: 
 

(1) Reveal confidential information of a client or a former client to: 

ii) anyone else, other than the client, the client’s representatives, or the members, 
associates, or employees of the lawyer’s law firm. 

  (

(i) a person that the client has instructed is not to receive the information; or 

(2)  Use  confidential  information  of  a  client  to  the  disadvantage  of  the  client  unless  the 
client consents after consultation. 

3)  Use  confidential  information  of  a  former  client  to  the  disadvantage  of  the  former 
client  after  the  representation  is  concluded  unless  the  former  client  consents  after 
consultation or the confidential information has become generally known. 

4)  Use  privileged  information  of  a  client  for  the  advantage  of  the  lawyer  or  of  a  third 
person, unless the client consents after consultation.

Client Under a Disability with Diminished Capacity 

7. In some situations, Rule 1.02(g) requires a lawyer representing a client under a disability to 
seek  the  appointment  of  a  legal  representative  for  the  client  or  to  seek  other  orders  for  the 
protection of the client. The client may or may not, in a particular matter, effectively consent to 
the  lawyer’s  revealing  to  the  court  confidential  information  and  facts  reasonably  necessary  to 
secure  the  desired  appointment  or  order.  Nevertheless,  the  lawyer  is  authorized  by  paragraph 
(c)(4)  to  reveal  such  information  in  order  to  comply  with  Rule  1.02(g).  See  also  paragraph  5, 
Comment to Rule 1.03. When representing a client who may have diminished capacity, a lawyer 
should  review  Rule  1.16,  which,  under  limited  circumstances,  permits  a  lawyer  to  disclose 
confidential information to protect the client’s interests. 

2. Various other Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct permit or require a lawyer to 
disclose  information  relating  to  the  representation.  See  Rules  1.07,  1.12,  1.16,  2.02,  3.03  and 
4.01. In addition to these provisions, a lawyer may be obligated by other provisions of statutes or 
other law to give information about a client. Whether another provision of law supersedes Rule 
1.05  is  a  matter  of  interpretation  beyond  the  scope  of  these  Rules,  but  sub-paragraph  (c)(4) 
protects the lawyer from discipline who acts on reasonable belief as to the effect of such laws. 

ermitted Disclosure or Use When the Lawyer Seeks Legal Advice  

3.  A  lawyer’s  confidentiality  obligations  do  not  preclude  a  lawyer  from  securing  confidential 
legal  advice  about  the  lawyer’s  responsibility  to  comply  with  these  Rules.  In  most  situations, 
disclosing or using confidential information to secure such advice will be impliedly authorized 
for the lawyer to carry out the representation. Even when the disclosure or use is not impliedly 
authorized,  subparagraph  (c)(9)  allows  such  disclosure  or  use  because  of  the  importance  of  a 
lawyer’s compliance  with  these  Rules.  A  lawyer  who  receives  confidential  information  for  the 
purpose of rendering legal advice to another lawyer or law firm under this Rule is subject to the 
same  rules  of  conduct  regarding  disclosure  or  use  of  confidential  information  received  in  a 
confidential relationship.

protection of the client. See Rule 1.02(e)16.

ule 1.16. Clients with Diminished Capacity  

a)  When  a  client’s  capacity  to  make  adequately  considered  decisions  in  connection  with  a 
representation  is  diminished,  whether  because  of  minority,  mental  impairment,  or  for  another 
reason,  the  lawyer  shall,  as  far  as  reasonably  possible,  maintain  a  normal  client-lawyer 
relationship with the client.  

b)  When  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  that  the  client  has  diminished  capacity,  is  at  risk  of 
substantial physical, financial, or other harm unless action is taken, and cannot adequately act in 
the client’s own interest, the lawyer may take reasonably necessary protective action. Such action 
may include, but is not limited to, consulting with individuals or entities that have the ability to 
take action to protect the client and, in appropriate cases, seeking the appointment of a guardian 
ad litem, attorney ad litem, amicus attorney, or conservator, or submitting an information letter to 
a court with jurisdiction to initiate guardianship proceedings for the client.  

c)  When  taking  protective  action  pursuant  to  (b),  the  lawyer  may  disclose  the  client’s 
confidential information to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes is necessary to protect the 
client’s interests.  

omment: 

.  The  normal  client-lawyer  relationship  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  client,  when 
properly advised and assisted, is capable of making decisions about important matters. However, 
maintaining the ordinary client-lawyer relationship may not be possible when the client suffers 
from  a  mental  impairment,  is  a  minor,  or  for  some  other  reason  has  a  diminished  capacity  to 
make  adequately  considered  decisions  regarding  representation.  In  particular,  a  severely 
incapacitated  person  may  have  no  power  to  make  legally  binding  decisions.  Nevertheless,  a 
client with diminished capacity often can understand, deliberate on, and reach conclusions about 
matters  affecting  the  client’s  own  well-being.  For  example,  some  people  of  advanced  age  are 
capable of handling routine financial matters but need special legal protection concerning major 
transactions.  Also,  some  children  are  regarded  as  having  opinions  entitled  to  weight  in  legal 
proceedings concerning their custody. 

 

 

2. In determining the extent of the client’s diminished capacity, the lawyer should consider and 
balance such factors as the client’s ability to articulate reasoning leading to a decision, variability 
of state of mind, and ability to appreciate consequences of a decision; the substantive fairness of 
a decision; and the consistency of a decision with the lawyer’s knowledge of the client’s long-
term commitments and values. 

3.  The  fact  that  a  client  suffers  from  diminished  capacity  does  not  diminish  the  lawyer’s 
obligation to treat the client with attention and respect. Even if the client has a guardian or other 
legal representative, the lawyer should, as far as possible, accord the client the normal status of a 
client, particularly in maintaining communication. If a guardian or other legal representative has

been  appointed  for  the  client,  however,  the  law  may  require  the  client’s  lawyer  to  look  to  the 
representative  for  decisions  on  the  client’s  behalf.  If  the  lawyer  represents  the  guardian  as 
distinct from the ward and is aware that the guardian is acting adversely to the ward’s interest, 
the lawyer may have an obligation to prevent or rectify the guardian’s misconduct. 

4.  The  client  may  wish  to  have  family  members  or  other  persons,  including  a  previously 
designated  trusted  person,  participate  in  discussions  with  the  lawyer;  however,  paragraph  (a) 
requires  the  lawyer  to  keep  the  client’s  interests  foremost  and,  except  when  taking  protective 
action  authorized  by  paragraph  (b),  to  look  to  the  client,  not  the  family  members  or  other 
persons, to make decisions on the client’s behalf. As part of the client in-take process, lawyers 
may wish to give new clients the opportunity to designate trusted persons who may be contacted 
by a lawyer if special needs arise. Any such procedure should provide sufficient information for 
the  client  to  understand  and  confer  with  the  lawyer  about  the  designation  of  a  trusted 
person. Standardized 
from  bar  associations  and  practice 
groups. Information about  trusted  person  designations  should  be  appropriately  safeguarded  and 
periodically updated, as necessary. In matters involving a minor, whether the lawyer should look 
to the parents as natural guardians may depend on the type of proceeding or matter in which the 
lawyer is representing the minor. 

forms  may  be  available 

Taking Protective Action 

.  Paragraph  (b)  contains  a  non-exhaustive  list  of  actions  a  lawyer  may  take  in  certain 
circumstances  to  protect  an  existing  client  who  does  not  have  a  guardian  or  other  legal 
representative.  Such  actions  could  include  consulting  with  family  members,  using  a 
reconsideration period to permit clarification or improvement of circumstances, using voluntary 
surrogate decision-making tools such as existing durable powers of attorney, or consulting with 
support  groups,  professional  services,  adult-protective  agencies,  or  other  individuals  or  entities 
that have the ability to protect the client. In taking  any protective action,  the lawyer should be 
guided  by  such  factors  as  the  client’s  wishes  and  values  to  the  extent  known,  the  client’s  best 
interests,  and  the  goals  of  intruding  into  the  client’s  decision-making  autonomy  to  the  least 
extent  feasible,  maximizing  client  capacities,  and  respecting  the  client’s  family  and  social 
connections. If it appears to be necessary to disclose confidential information to a third person to 
protect the client’s best interests, a lawyer should consider whether it would be prudent to ask for 
the  client’s  consent  to  the  disclosure.  Only  in  compelling  cases  should  the  lawyer  disclose 
confidential client information if the client has expressly refused to consent. The authority of a 
lawyer to disclose confidential client information to protect the interests of the client is limited 
and extends no further than is reasonably necessary to facilitate protective action. 

uties Under Other Law 

6. Nothing in this Rule modifies or reduces a lawyer’s obligations under other law. 

. A client with diminished capacity also may cause or threaten physical, financial, or other harm 
to third parties. In such situations, the client’s lawyer should consult applicable law to determine 
the appropriate response.

8.  When  a  legal  representative  has  not  been  appointed,  the  lawyer  should  consider  whether  an 
appointment  is  reasonably  necessary  to  protect  the  client’s  interests.  Thus,  for  example,  if  a 
client  with  diminished  capacity  has  substantial  property  that  should  be  sold  for  the  client’s 
benefit,  effective  completion  of  the  transaction  may  require  appointment  of  a  legal 
representative. In addition, applicable law provides for the appointment of legal representatives 
in  certain  circumstances.  For  example,  the  Texas  Family  Code  prescribes  when  a  guardian  ad 
litem,  attorney  ad  litem,  or  amicus  attorney  should  be  appointed  in  a  suit  affecting  the  parent-
child relationship, and the Texas Probate Code prescribes when a guardian should be appointed 
for  an  incapacitated  person.  In  many  circumstances,  however,  appointment  of  a  legal 
representative  may  be  more  expensive  or  traumatic  for  the  client  than  circumstances  in  fact 
require.  Evaluation  of  such  circumstances  is  a  matter  entrusted  to  the  lawyer’s  professional 
judgment.  In  considering  alternatives,  the  lawyer  should  be  aware  of  any  law  that  requires  the 
lawyer to advocate on the client’s behalf for the action that imposes the least restriction. 

. Disclosure of the client’s diminished capacity could adversely affect the client’s interests. For 
example,  raising  the  question  of  diminished  capacity  could,  in  some  circumstances,  lead  to 
proceedings  for  involuntary  commitment.  As  with  any  client-lawyer  relationship,  information 
relating  to  the  representation  of  a  client  is  confidential  under  Rule  1.05.  However,  when  the 
lawyer  is  taking  protective  action,  paragraph  (b)  of  this  Rule  permits  the  lawyer  to  make 
necessary  disclosures.  Given  the  risks  to  the  client  of  disclosure,  paragraph  (c) limits  what  the 
lawyer may disclose in consulting with other individuals or entities or in seeking the appointment 
of a legal representative. At the very least, the lawyer should determine whether it is likely that 
the person or entity consulted will act adversely to the client’s interests before discussing matters 
related  to  the  client.  A  disclosure  of  confidential  information  may  be  inadvisable  if  the  third 
person’s involvement in the matter is likely to turn confrontational.

Emergency Legal Assistance 

10.  In  an  emergency  where  the  health,  safety  or  a  financial  interest  of  a  person  with  seriously 
diminished capacity is threatened with imminent and irreparable harm, a lawyer may take legal 
action on behalf of such a person even though the person is unable to establish a client-lawyer 
relationship  or  to  make  or  express  considered  judgments  about  the  matter,  when  the  person  or 
another acting in good faith on that person’s behalf has consulted with the lawyer. Even in such 
an emergency, however, the lawyer should not act unless the lawyer reasonably believes that the 
person has no other lawyer, agent or other representative available. The lawyer should take legal 
action on behalf of the person only to the extent reasonably necessary to maintain the status quo 
or  otherwise  avoid  imminent  and  irreparable  harm.  A  lawyer  who  undertakes  to  represent  a 
person in such an exigent situation has the same duties under these Rules as the lawyer would 
with respect to a client. 

11. A lawyer who acts on behalf of a person with seriously diminished capacity in an emergency 
should keep the confidences of the person as if dealing with a client, disclosing them only to the 
extent necessary to accomplish the intended protective action. The lawyer should disclose to any 
tribunal involved and to any other counsel involved the nature of his or her relationship with the 

Misc. Docket No. 21-9061 

Page 12 

person. The lawyer should take steps to regularize the relationship or implement other protective 
solutions  as  soon  as  possible.  Normally,  a  lawyer  would  not  seek  compensation  for  such 
emergency actions taken.

ule 4.02. Communication with One Represented by Counsel 

.  Paragraph  (a)  does  not,  however,  prohibit  communication  between  a  lawyer’s  client  and 
persons, organizations, or entities of government represented by counsel, as long as the lawyer 
does not cause or encourage the communication without the consent of the lawyer for the other 
party.  Consent  may  be  implied  as  well  as  express,  as,  for  example,  where  the  communication 
occurs  in  the  form  of  a  private  placement  memorandum  or  similar  document  that  obviously  is 
intended for multiple recipients and that normally is furnished directly to persons, even if known 
to  be  represented  by  counsel.  Similarly,  that  paragraph  does  not  impose  a  duty  on  a  lawyer  to 
affirmatively  discourage  communication  between  the  lawyer’s  client  and  other  represented 
persons,  organizations  or  entities  of  government.  Furthermore,  it  does  not  prohibit  client 
communications  concerning  matters  outside  the  subject  of  the  representation  with  any  such 
person,  organization,  or  entity  of  government.  Finally,  it  does  not  prohibit  a  lawyer  from 
furnishing  a  “second  opinion”  in a  matter  to  one  requesting  such  opinion,  nor  from discussing 
employment in the matter if requested to do so. But see Rules 7.021 and 8.04(a)(3).

Services 

  T

  R

a)  The  conflicts  of  interest  limitations  on  representation  in  Rules  1.06,  1.07,  and  1.09  do  not 
prohibit a lawyer from providing, or offering to provide, limited pro bono legal services unless 
the lawyer knows, at the time the services are provided, that the lawyer would be prohibited by 
those limitations from providing the services. 

b)  Lawyers  in  a  firm  with  a  lawyer  providing,  or  offering  to  provide,  limited  pro  bono  legal 
services shall not be prohibited by the imputation provisions of Rules 1.06, 1.07, and 1.09 from 
representing a client if that lawyer does not: 
 

(1) disclose confidential information of the pro bono client to the lawyers in the firm; or 

(2) maintain such information in a manner that would render it accessible to the lawyers 
in the firm. 

c)  The  eligibility  information  that  an  applicant  is  required  to  provide  when  applying  for  free 
legal services or limited pro bono legal services from a program described in subparagraph (d)(1) 
by itself will not create a conflict of interest if: 
 

(1) the eligibility information is not material to the legal matter; or 

(2)  the  applicant’s  provision  of  the  eligibility  information  was  conditioned  on  the 
applicant’s informed consent that providing this information would not by itself prohibit 
a representation of another client adverse to the applicant. 

d) As used in this Rule, “limited pro bono legal services” means legal services that are: 

(1)  provided  through  a  pro  bono  or  assisted  pro  se  program  sponsored  by  a  court,  bar 
association, accredited law school, or nonprofit legal services program; 

(2)  short-term  services  such  as  legal  advice  or  other  brief  assistance  with  pro  se 
documents  or  transactions,  provided  either  in  person  or  by  phone,  hotline,  internet,  or 
video conferencing; and 

(3) provided without any expectation of extended representation of the limited assistance 
client or of receiving any legal fees in that matter. 

e) As used in this Rule, a lawyer is not “in a firm” with other lawyers solely because the lawyer 
provides limited pro bono legal services with the other lawyers.

.  Nonprofit  legal  services  organizations,  courts,  law  schools,  and  bar  associations  have 
programs through which lawyers provide short-term limited legal services typically to help low-
income  persons  address  their  legal  problems  without  further  representation  by  the  lawyers.  In 
these  programs,  such  as  legal-advice  hotlines,  advice-only  clinics,  disaster  legal  services,  or 
programs  providing  guidance  to  self-represented  litigants,  a  client-lawyer  relationship  is 
established,  but  there  is  no  expectation  that  the  relationship  will  continue  beyond  the  limited 
consultation and there is no expectation that the lawyer will receive any compensation from the 
client for the services. These programs are normally operated under circumstances in which it is 
not  feasible  for  a  lawyer  to  check  for  conflicts  of  interest  as  is  normally  required  before 
undertaking a representation.   

.  Application  of  the  conflict  of  interest  rules  has  deterred  lawyers  from  participating  in  these 
programs, preventing persons of limited means from obtaining much needed legal services. To 
facilitate the provision of free legal services to the public, this Rule creates narrow exceptions to 
the  conflict  of  interest  rules  for  limited  pro  bono  legal  services.  These  exceptions  are  justified 
because the limited and short-term nature of the legal services rendered in such programs reduces 
the risk that conflicts of interest will arise between clients represented through the program and 
other clients of the lawyer or the lawyer’s firm. Other than the limited exceptions set forth in this 
Rule, a lawyer remains subject to all applicable conflict of interest rules. 

cope of Representation 

. A lawyer who provides services pursuant to this Rule should secure the client’s consent to the 
limited scope of the representation after explaining to the client what that means in the particular 
circumstance.    See  Rule  1.02(b).  If  a  short-term  limited  representation  would  not  be  fully 
sufficient  under  the  circumstances,  the  lawyer  may  offer  advice  to  the  client  but  should  also 
advise the client of the need for further assistance of counsel. See Rule 1.03(b). 

onflicts and the Lawyer Providing Limited Pro Bono Legal Services 

.  Paragraph  (a)  exempts  compliance  with  Rules  1.06,  1.07,  and  1.09  for  a  lawyer  providing 
limited pro bono legal services unless the lawyer actually knows that the representation presents 
a  conflict  of  interest  for  the  lawyer  or  for  another  lawyer  in  the  lawyer’s  firm.  A  lawyer 
providing  limited  pro  bono  legal  services  is  not  obligated  to  perform  a  conflicts  check  before 
undertaking the limited representation. If, after commencing a representation in accordance with 
this  Rule,  a  lawyer  undertakes  to  represent  the  client  in  the  matter  on  an  ongoing  basis  or  the 
lawyer  charges  a  fee  for  the  legal  assistance,  the  exceptions  provided  by  this  Rule  no  longer 
apply. 

mputation of Conflicts 

.  Paragraph  (b)  provides  that  a  conflict  of  interest  arising  from  a  lawyer’s  representation 
covered by this Rule will not be imputed to the lawyers in the pro bono lawyer’s firm if the pro 
bono lawyer complies with subparagraphs (b)(1) and (2).

6.  To  prevent  a  conflict  of  interest  arising  from  limited  pro  bono  legal  services  from  being 
imputed to the other lawyers in the firm, subparagraph (b)(1) requires that the pro bono lawyer 
not  disclose  to  any  lawyer  in  the  firm  any  confidential  information  related  to  the  pro  bono 
representation.  

.  Subparagraph  (b)(2)  covers  the  retention  of  documents  or  other  memorialization  of 
confidential  information,  such  as  the  pro  bono  lawyer’s  notes,  whether  in  paper  or  electronic 
form. To prevent imputation, a pro bono lawyer who retains confidential information is required 
by  subparagraph  (b)(2)  to  segregate  and  store  it  in  such  a  way  that  no  other  lawyer  in  the  pro 
bono lawyer’s firm can access it, either physically or electronically.  

ligibility Information 

.  Paragraph  (c)  recognizes  the  unusual  and  uniquely  sensitive  personal  information  that 
applicants  for  free  legal  assistance  may  be  required  to  provide.  Organizations  that  receive 
funding  to  provide  free  legal  assistance  to  low-income  clients  are  generally  required,  as  a 
condition of their funding, to screen the applicants for eligibility and to document eligibility for 
services  paid  for  by  those  funding  sources.  Unlike  other  lawyers,  law  firms,  and  legal 
departments,  these  organizations  ask  for  confidential  information  to  determine  an  applicant’s 
eligibility  for  free  legal  assistance  and  are  required  to  maintain  records  of  such  eligibility 
determinations  for  potential  audit  by  their  funding  sources.  Required  eligibility  information 
typically  includes  income,  asset  values,  marital  status,  citizenship  or  immigration  status,  and 
other facts the applicant may consider sensitive.  

.  The  first  situation  where  the  paragraph  (c)  exception  is  available  is  where  none  of  the 
eligibility  information  is  material  to  an  issue  in  the  legal  matter.  Alternatively,  under 
subparagraph  (c)(2),  if  the  applicant  provided  confidential  information  after  giving  informed 
consent that the eligibility information would not prohibit the persons or entities identified in the 
consent from representing any other present or future client, then the eligibility information alone 
will  not  prohibit  the  representation.  The  lawyer  should  document  the  receipt  of  such  informed 
consent, though a formal writing is not required. What constitutes informed consent is discussed 
in the comments to Rule 1.06. 

0. Rule 1.05 continues to apply to the use or disclosure of all confidential information provided 
during  an  intake  interview.  Similarly,  Rule  1.09  continues  to  apply  to  the  representation  of  a 
person in a matter adverse to the applicant. Notably, Rule 1.05(c)(2) permits a lawyer to use or 
disclose  information  provided  during  an  intake  interview  if  the  applicant  consents  after 
consultation  to  such  use  or  disclosure,  and  Rule  1.09(a)  excludes  from  its  restrictions  the 
representation of a person adverse to the applicant in the same or a substantially related matter if 
the applicant consents to such a representation. 

imited Pro Bono Legal Service Programs 

1.  This  Rule  applies  only  to  services  offered  through  a  program  that  meets  one  of  the 
descriptions  in  subparagraph  (d)(1),  regardless  of  the  nature  and  amount  of  support  provided. 
Some programs may be jointly sponsored by more than one of the listed sponsor types.

2. The second element of “limited pro bono legal services,” set forth in subparagraph (d)(2), is 
designed to ensure that the services offered are so limited in time and scope that there is little risk 
that conflicts will arise between clients represented through the program and other clients of the 
lawyer or the lawyer’s firm. 

3. The third element of the definition, set forth in subparagraph (d)(3), is that the services are 
offered and provided without any expectation of either extended representation or the collection 
of legal fees in the matter. Before agreeing to proceed in the representation beyond “limited pro 
bono legal services,” the lawyer should evaluate the potential conflicts of interest that may arise 
from the representation as with any other representation. Likewise, the exceptions in paragraphs 
(a) and (b) do not apply if the lawyer expects to collect any legal fees in the limited assistance 
matter. 

4. Lawyers are not deemed to be part of the same firm simply because they volunteer through 
the same pro bono program. Nor will the personal prohibition of a lawyer participating in a pro 
bono program be imputed to other lawyers participating in the program solely by reason of that 
volunteer connection.

a)  A  lawyer  shall  not  make  or  sponsor  a  false  or  misleading  communication  about  the 
qualifications  or  services  of  a  lawyer  or  law  firm.  Information  about  legal  services  must  be 
truthful  and  nondeceptive.  A  communication  is  false  or  misleading  if  it  contains  a  material 
misrepresentation of fact or law, or omits a fact necessary to make the statement considered as a 
whole  not  materially  misleading.  A  statement  is  misleading  if  there  is  a  substantial  likelihood 
that it will lead a reasonable  person  to formulate a specific conclusion about the lawyer  or the 
lawyer’s  services  for  which  there  is  no  reasonable  factual  foundation,  or  if  the  statement  is 
substantially likely to create unjustified expectations about the results the lawyer can achieve. 

1)  An  “advertisement”  is  a  communication  substantially  motivated  by  pecuniary  gain 
that is made by or on behalf of a lawyer to members of the public in general, which offers 
or  promotes  legal  services  under  circumstances  where  the  lawyer  neither  knows  nor 
reasonably should know that the recipients need legal services in particular matters. 

2)  A  “solicitation  communication”  is  a  communication  substantially  motivated  by 
pecuniary gain that is made by or on behalf of a lawyer to a specific person who has not 
sought the lawyer’s advice or services, which reasonably can be understood as offering to 
provide legal services that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know the person needs 
in a particular matter.

b)  This  Rule  governs  all  communications  about  a  lawyer’s  services,  including  advertisements 
and solicitation communications. For purposes of Rules 7.01 to 7.06: 

c)  Lawyers  may  practice  law  under  a  trade  name  that  is  not  false  or  misleading.  A  law  firm 
name may include the names of current members of the firm and of deceased or retired members 
of the firm, or of a predecessor firm, if there has been a succession in the firm identity. The name 
of  a  lawyer  holding  a  public  office  shall  not  be  used  in  the  name  of  a  law  firm,  or  in 
communications on its behalf, during any substantial period in which the lawyer is not actively 
and regularly practicing with the firm. A law firm with an office in more than one jurisdiction 
may use the same name or other professional designation in each jurisdiction, but identification 
of  the  lawyers  in  an  office  of  the  firm  shall  indicate  the  jurisdictional  limitations  on  those  not 
licensed to practice in the jurisdiction where the office is located. 

d)  A  statement  or  disclaimer  required  by  these  Rules  shall  be  sufficiently  clear  that  it  can 
reasonably  be  understood  by  an  ordinary  person  and  made  in  each  language  used  in  the 
communication.  A  statement  that  a  language  is  spoken  or  understood  does  not  require  a 
statement or disclaimer in that language.

(e) A lawyer shall not state or imply that the lawyer can achieve results in the representation by 
unlawful use of violence or means that violate these Rules or other law. 

f) A lawyer may state or imply that the lawyer practices in a partnership or other business entity 
only when that is accurate. 

g) If a lawyer who advertises the amount of a verdict secured on behalf of a client knows that 
the  verdict  was  later  reduced  or  reversed,  or  that  the  case  was  settled  for  a  lesser  amount,  the 
lawyer  must  state  in  each  advertisement  of  the  verdict,  with  equal  or  greater  prominence,  the 
amount of money that was ultimately received by the client. 

 
1.  This  Rule  governs  all  communications  about  a  lawyer’s  services,  including  firm  names, 
letterhead, and professional designations.  Whatever means are  used to make known a  lawyer’s 
services, statements about them must be truthful and not misleading.  As subsequent provisions 
make  clear,  some  rules  apply  only  to  “advertisements”  or  “solicitation  communications.”  A 
statement  about  a  lawyer’s  services  falls  within  those  categories  only  if  it  was  “substantially 
motivated by pecuniary gain,”  which  means that pecuniary gain was a substantial factor in the 
making of the statement. 

isleading Truthful Statements 

. Misleading truthful statements are prohibited by this Rule. For example, a truthful statement is 
misleading  if  presented  in  a  way  that  creates  a  substantial  likelihood  that  a  reasonable  person 
would believe the lawyer’s communication requires that person to take further action when, in 
fact, no action is required.   

omment: 

  C

se of Actors 

. The use of an actor to portray a lawyer in a commercial is misleading if there is a substantial 
likelihood that a reasonable person will conclude that the actor is the lawyer who is offering to 
provide  legal  services.  Whether  a  disclaimer—such  as  a  statement  that  the  depiction  is  a 
“dramatization”  or  shows  an  “actor  portraying  a  lawyer”—is  sufficient  to  make  the  use  of  an 
actor  not  misleading  depends  on  a  careful  assessment  of  the  relevant  facts  and  circumstances, 
including  whether  the  disclaimer  is  conspicuous  and  clear.  Similar  issues  arise  with  respect  to 
actors  portraying  clients  in  commercials.  Such  a  communication  is  misleading  if  there  is  a 
substantial  likelihood  that  a  reasonable  person  will  reach  erroneous  conclusions  based  on  the 
dramatization. 

ntent to Refer Prospective Clients to Another Firm 

.  A  communication  offering  legal  services  is  misleading  if,  at  the  time  a  lawyer  makes  the 
communication,  the  lawyer  knows  or  reasonably  should  know,  but  fails  to  disclose,  that  a 
prospective client responding to the communication is likely to be referred to a lawyer in another 
firm.

njustified Expectations 

. A communication is misleading if there is a substantial likelihood that it will create unjustified 
expectations  on  the  part  of  prospective  clients  about  the  results  that  can  be  achieved.  A 
communication that truthfully reports results obtained by a lawyer on behalf of clients or former 
clients may be misleading if presented so as to lead a reasonable person to form an unjustified 
expectation  that  the  same  results  could  be  obtained  for  other  clients  in  similar  matters  without 
reference to the specific factual and legal circumstances of each client’s case. Depending on the 
facts and circumstances, the inclusion of an appropriate disclaimer or qualifying language may 
preclude a finding that a statement is likely to mislead the public.   

equired Statements and Disclaimers 

.  A  statement  or  disclaimer  required  by  these  Rules  must  be  presented  clearly  and 
conspicuously  such  that  it  is  likely  to  be  noticed  and  reasonably  understood  by  an  ordinary 
person. In radio, television, and Internet advertisements, verbal statements must be spoken in a 
manner that their content is easily intelligible, and written statements must appear in a size and 
font, and for a sufficient length of time, that a viewer can easily see and read the statements.  

nsubstantiated Claims and Comparisons 

. An unsubstantiated claim about a lawyer’s or law firm’s services or fees, or an unsubstantiated 
comparison  of  the  lawyer’s  or  law  firm’s  services  or  fees  with  those  of  other  lawyers  or  law 
firms,  may  be  misleading  if  presented  with  such  specificity  as  to  lead  a  reasonable  person  to 
conclude that the comparison or claim can be substantiated.  

ublic Education Activities 

.  As  used  in  these  Rules,  the  terms  “advertisement”  and  “solicitation  communication”  do  not 
include  statements  made  by  a  lawyer  that  are  not  substantially  motivated  by  pecuniary  gain. 
Thus, communications which merely inform members of the public about their legal rights and 
about  legal  services  that  are  available  from  public  or  charitable  legal-service  organizations,  or 
similar  non-profit  entities,  are  permissible,  provided  they  are  not  misleading.  These  types  of 
statements  may  be  made  in  a  variety  of  ways,  including  community  legal  education  sessions, 
know-your-rights  brochures,  public  service  announcements  on  television  and  radio,  billboards, 
information posted  on organizational social media sites, and outreach to low-income  groups in 
the  community,  such  as  in  migrant  labor  housing  camps,  domestic  violence  shelters,  disaster 
resource centers, and dilapidated apartment complexes.

not otherwise violate these Rules.

Past Success and Results 

0. A communication about legal services may be misleading because it omits an important fact 
or tells only part of the truth. A lawyer who knows that an advertised verdict was later reduced or 
reversed, or that the case was settled for a lesser amount, must disclose those facts with equal or 
greater prominence to avoid creating unjustified expectations on the part of potential clients. A 
lawyer  may  claim  credit  for  a  prior  judgement  or  settlement  only  if  the  lawyer  played  a 
substantial  role  in  obtaining  that  result.  This  standard  is  satisfied  if  the  lawyer  served  as  lead 
counsel or was primarily responsible for the settlement. In other cases, whether the standard is 
met depends on the facts. A lawyer who did not play a substantial role in obtaining an advertised 
judgment or settlement is subject to discipline for misrepresenting the lawyer’s experience and, 
in some cases, for creating unjustified expectations about the results the lawyer can achieve. 

1. It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, 
deceit  or  misrepresentation.  See  Rule  8.04(a)(3);  see  also  Rule  8.04(a)(5)  (prohibiting 
communications stating or implying an ability to improperly influence a government agency or 
official). 

a) An advertisement of legal services shall publish the name of a lawyer who is responsible for 
the content of the advertisement and identify the lawyer’s primary practice location. 

b)  A  lawyer  who  advertises  may  communicate  that  the  lawyer  does  or  does  not  practice  in 
particular  fields  of  law,  but  shall  not  include  a  statement  that  the  lawyer  has  been  certified  or 
designated by an organization as possessing special competence or a statement that the lawyer is 
a  member  of  an  organization  the  name  of  which  implies  that  its  members  possess  special 
competence, except that: 

1)  a  lawyer  who  has  been  awarded  a  Certificate  of  Special  Competence  by  the  Texas 
Board  of  Legal  Specialization  in  the  area  so  advertised,  may  state  with  respect  to  each 
such  area,  “Board  Certified,  area  of  specialization  --  Texas  Board  of  Legal 
Specialization”; and 

2)  a  lawyer  who  is  a  member  of  an  organization  the  name  of  which  implies  that  its 
members  possess  special  competence,  or  who  has  been  certified  or  designated  by  an 
organization  as  possessing  special  competence  in  a  field  of  practice,  may  include  a 
factually  accurate,  non-misleading  statement  of  such  membership  or  certification,  but 
only if that organization has been accredited by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization 
as a bona fide organization that admits to membership or grants certification only on the 
basis of published criteria which the Texas Board of Legal Specialization has established 
as required for such certification.

(c) If an advertisement by a lawyer discloses a willingness to render services on a contingent fee 
basis, the advertisement must state whether the client will be obligated to pay for other expenses, 
such as the costs of litigation. 

d) A lawyer who advertises a specific fee or range of fees for an identified service shall conform 
to the advertised fee or range of fees for the period during which the advertisement is reasonably 
expected to be in circulation or otherwise expected to be effective in attracting clients, unless the 
advertisement  specifies  a  shorter  period.  However,  a  lawyer  is  not  bound  to  conform  to  the 
advertised fee or range of fees for a period of more than one year after the date of publication, 
unless the lawyer has expressly promised to do so. 

omment:  

.  These  Rules  permit  the  dissemination  of  information  that  is  not  false  or  misleading  about  a 
lawyer’s or law firm’s name, address, e-mail address, website, and telephone number; the kinds 
of  services  the  lawyer  will  undertake;  the  basis  on  which  the  lawyer’s  fees  are  determined, 
including  prices  for  specific  services  and  payment  and  credit  arrangements;  a  lawyer’s  foreign 
language  abilities;  names  of  references  and,  with  their  consent,  names  of  clients  regularly 
represented; and other similar information that might invite the attention of those seeking legal 
assistance. 

ommunications about Fields of Practice 

.  Lawyers  often  benefit  from  associating  with  other  lawyers  for  the  development  of  practice 
areas.  Thus,  practitioners  have  established  associations,  organizations,  institutes,  councils,  and 
practice  groups  to  promote,  discuss,  and  develop  areas  of  the  law,  and  to  advance  continuing 
education and skills development. While such activities are generally encouraged, participating 
lawyers must refrain from creating or using designations, titles, or certifications which are false 
or misleading. A lawyer shall not advertise that the lawyer is a member of an organization whose 
name  implies  that  members  possess  special  competence,  unless  the  organization  meets  the 
standards of Rule 7.02(b). Merely stating a designated class of membership, such as Associate, 
Master, Barrister, Diplomate, or Advocate, does not, in itself, imply special competence violative 
of these Rules. 

. Paragraph (b) of this Rule permits a lawyer to communicate that the lawyer practices, focuses, 
or  concentrates  in  particular  areas  of  law.  Such  communications  are  subject  to  the  “false  and 
misleading”  standard  applied  by  Rule  7.01  to  communications  concerning  a  lawyer’s  services 
and must be objectively based on the lawyer’s experience, specialized training, or education in 
the area of practice. 

.  The  Patent  and  Trademark  Office  has  a  long-established  policy  of  designating  lawyers 
practicing  before  the  Office.  The  designation  of  Admiralty  practice  also  has  a  long  historical 
tradition associated with maritime commerce and the federal courts. A lawyer’s communications 
about these practice areas are not prohibited by this Rule.

. This Rule permits a lawyer to state that the lawyer is certified as a specialist in a field of law if 
such  certification  is  granted  by  the Texas  Board  of  Legal  Specialization  or  by  an  organization 
that  applies  standards  of  experience,  knowledge  and  proficiency  to  ensure  that  a  lawyer’s 
recognition  as  a  specialist  is  meaningful  and  reliable,  if  the  organization  is  accredited  by  the 
Texas  Board  of  Legal  Specialization.  To  ensure  that  consumers  can  obtain  access  to  useful 
information about an organization granting certification, the name of the certifying organization 
must be included in any communication regarding the certification. 

1)  “Regulated  telephone,  social  media,  or  other  electronic  contact”  means  telephone, 
social media, or electronic communication initiated by a lawyer, or by a person acting on 
behalf  of  a  lawyer,  that  involves  communication  in  a  live  or  electronically  interactive 
manner. 

2)  A  lawyer  “solicits”  employment  by  making  a  “solicitation  communication,”  as  that 
term is defined in Rule 7.01(b)(2). 

b)  A  lawyer  shall  not  solicit  through  in-person  contact,  or  through  regulated  telephone,  social 
media, or other electronic contact, professional employment from a non-client, unless the target 
of the solicitation is: 
 

(1) another lawyer; 

(2)  a  person  who  has  a  family,  close  personal,  or  prior  business  or  professional 
relationship with the lawyer; or 

(3) a person who is known by the lawyer to be an experienced user of the type of legal 
services involved for business matters. 

c) A lawyer shall not send, deliver, or transmit, or knowingly permit or cause another person to 
send,  deliver,  or  transmit,  a  communication  that  involves  coercion,  duress,  overreaching, 
intimidation, or undue influence. 

d) A lawyer shall not send, deliver, or transmit, or knowingly permit or cause another person to 
send, deliver, or transmit, a solicitation communication to a prospective client, if: 
 

(1)  the  communication  is  misleadingly  designed  to  resemble  a  legal  pleading  or  other 
legal document; or

1) This Rule does not prohibit a lawyer from paying reasonable fees for advertising and 
public relations services or the usual charges of a lawyer referral service that meets the 
requirements of Texas law.

an  agreement  not  otherwise  prohibited  under  these  Rules  that  provides  for  the  other 
person to refer clients or customers to the lawyer, if:

pay,  give,  or  advance  anything  of  value  to  a  prospective  client,  other  than  actual  litigation 
expenses and other financial assistance permitted by Rule 1.08(d), or ordinary social hospitality 
of nominal value. 
  
(g) This Rule does not prohibit communications authorized by law, such as notice to members of 
a class in class action litigation. 

omment: 

olicitation by Public and Charitable Legal Services Organizations 

.  Rule  7.01  provides  that  a  “‘solicitation  communication’  is  a  communication  substantially 
motivated  by  pecuniary  gain.”    Therefore,  the  ban  on  solicitation  imposed  by  paragraph  (b)  of 
this  Rule  does  not  apply  to  the  activities  of  lawyers  working  for  public  or  charitable  legal 
services organizations.

2. A lawyer’s communication is not a solicitation if it is directed to the general public, such as 
through a billboard, an Internet banner advertisement, a website or a television commercial, or if 
it  is  made  in  response  to  a  request  for  information,  including  an  electronic  search  for 
information.  The  terms  “advertisement”  and  “solicitation  communication”  are  defined  in  Rule 
7.01(b). 

he Risk of Overreaching 

. A potential for  overreaching exists when  a lawyer,  seeking pecuniary gain, solicits a person 
known to be in need of legal services via in-person or regulated telephone, social media, or other 
electronic  contact.  These  forms  of  contact  subject  a  person  to  the  private  importuning  of  the 
trained  advocate  in  a  direct  interpersonal  encounter.  The  person,  who  may  already  feel 
overwhelmed by the circumstances giving rise to the need for legal services, may find it difficult 
to fully evaluate all available alternatives with reasoned judgment and appropriate self‑interest in 
the  face  of  the  lawyer’s  presence  and  insistence  upon  an  immediate  response.  The  situation  is 
fraught with the possibility of undue influence, intimidation, and overreaching. 

.  The  potential  for  overreaching  that  is  inherent  in  in-person  or  regulated  telephone,  social 
media, or other electronic contact justifies their prohibition, since lawyers have alternative means 
of conveying necessary information. In particular, communications can be sent by regular mail 
or  e-mail,  or  by  other  means  that  do  not  involve  communication  in  a  live  or  electronically 
interactive  manner.  These  forms  of  communications  make  it  possible  for  the  public  to  be 
informed about the need for legal services, and about the qualifications of available lawyers and 
law firms, with minimal risk of overwhelming a person’s judgment. 

.  The  contents  of  live  person-to-person  contact  can  be  disputed  and  may  not  be  subject  to 
third‑party  scrutiny.  Consequently,  they  are  much  more  likely  to  approach  (and  occasionally 
cross) the dividing line between accurate representations and those that are false and misleading. 

argeted Mail Solicitation 

. Regular mail or e-mail targeted to a person that offers to provide legal services that the lawyer 
knows  or  reasonably  should  know  the  person  needs  in  a  particular  matter  is  a  solicitation 
communication within the meaning of Rule 7.01(b)(2), but is not prohibited by subsection (b) of 
this  Rule.    Unlike  in-person  and  electronically  interactive  communication  by  “regulated 
telephone,  social  media,  or  other  electronic  contact,”  regular  mail  and  e-mail  can  easily  be 
ignored, set aside, or reconsidered. There is a diminished likelihood of overreaching because no 
lawyer  is  physically  present  and  there  is  evidence  in  tangible  or  electronic  form  of  what  was 
communicated.  See Shapero v. Kentucky B. Ass’n, 486 U.S. 466 (1988). 

ersonal, Family, Business, and Professional Relationships 

. There is a substantially reduced likelihood that a lawyer would engage in overreaching against 
a  former  client,  a  person  with  whom  the  lawyer  has  a  close  personal,  family,  business  or 
professional  relationship,  or  in  situations  in  which  the  lawyer  is  motivated  by  considerations 
other  than  pecuniary  gain.  Nor  is  there  a  serious  potential  for  overreaching  when  the  person

contacted is a lawyer or is known to routinely use the type of legal services involved for business 
purposes.  Examples  include  persons  who  routinely  hire  outside  counsel  to  represent  an  entity; 
entrepreneurs who regularly engage business, employment law, or intellectual property lawyers; 
small  business  proprietors  who  routinely  hire  lawyers  for  lease  or  contract  issues;  and  other 
people who routinely retain lawyers for business transactions or formations.  

onstitutionally Protected Activities 

.  Paragraph  (b)  is  not  intended  to  prohibit  a  lawyer  from  participating  in  constitutionally 
protected  activities  of  public  or  charitable  legal-service  organizations  or  bona  fide  political, 
social,  civic,  fraternal,  employee,  or  trade  organizations  whose  purposes  include  providing  or 
recommending legal services to their members or beneficiaries. See In re Primus, 436 U.S. 412 
(1978). 

roup and Prepaid Legal Services Plans 

.  This  Rule  does  not  prohibit  a  lawyer  from  contacting  representatives  of  organizations  or 
entities that may  be interested  in  establishing  a group  or  prepaid  legal plan  for  their  members, 
insureds,  beneficiaries,  or  other  third  parties.  Such  communications  may  provide  information 
about the availability and terms of a plan which the lawyer or lawyer’s firm is willing to offer. 
This  form  of  communication  is  not  directed  to  persons  who  are  seeking  legal  services  for 
themselves. Rather, it is usually addressed to a fiduciary seeking a supplier of legal services for 
others,  who  may,  if  they  choose,  become  prospective  clients  of  the  lawyer.  Under  these 
circumstances, the information transmitted is functionally similar to the types of advertisements 
permitted by these Rules. 

esignation as an Advertisement 

0. For purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this Rule, a communication is rebuttably presumed to be 
“plainly  marked  or  clearly  designated  an  ‘ADVERTISEMENT’”  if:    (a)  in  the  case  of  a  letter 
transmitted in an envelope, both the outside of the envelope and the first page of the letter state 
the word “ADVERTISEMENT” in bold face all-capital letters that are 3/8” high on a uncluttered 
background;  (b)  in  the  case  of  an  e-mail  message,  the  first  word  in  the  subject  line  is 
“ADVERTISEMENT” in all capital letters; and (c) in the case of a text message or message on 
social media, the first word in the message is “ADVERTISEMENT” in all capital letters. 

aying Others to Recommend a Lawyer  

1.  This  Rule  allows  a  lawyer  to  pay  for  advertising  and  communications,  including  the  usual 
costs  of  printed  or  online  directory  listings  or  advertisements,  television  and  radio  airtime, 
domain-name registrations, sponsorship fees, and group advertising. A lawyer may compensate 
employees,  agents,  and  vendors  who  are  engaged  to  provide  marketing  or  client  development 
services,  such  as  publicists,  public-relations  personnel,  business-development  staff,  television 
and radio station employees or spokespersons, and website designers.

12. This Rule permits lawyers to give nominal gifts as an expression of appreciation to a person 
for  recommending  the  lawyer’s  services  or  referring  a  prospective  client.  The  gift  may  not  be 
more than a token item as might be given for holidays, or other ordinary social hospitality. A gift 
is  prohibited  if  offered  or  given  in  consideration  of  any  promise,  agreement,  or  understanding 
that  such  a  gift  would  be  forthcoming  or  that  referrals  would  be  made  or  encouraged  in  the 
future. 

3. A lawyer may pay others for generating client leads, such as Internet-based client leads, as 
long as the lead generator does not recommend the lawyer, any payment to the lead generator is 
consistent  with  Rule  5.04(a)  (division  of  fees  with  nonlawyers)  and  Rule  5.04(c)  (nonlawyer 
interference  with  the  professional  independence  of  the  lawyer),  and  the  lead  generator’s 
communications are consistent with Rule 7.01 (communications concerning a lawyer’s services). 
To comply with Rule 7.01, a lawyer must not pay a lead generator that states, implies, or creates 
a  reasonable  impression  that  it  is  recommending  the  lawyer,  is  making  the  referral  without 
payment  from  the  lawyer,  or  has  analyzed  a  person’s  legal  problems  when  determining  which 
lawyer  should  receive  the  referral.  See  also  Rule  5.03  (duties  of  lawyers  and  law  firms  with 
respect to the conduct of nonlawyers); Rule 8.04(a)(1) (duty to avoid violating the Rules through 
the acts of another). 

harges of and Referrals by a Legal Services Plan or Lawyer Referral Service 

4. A lawyer may pay the usual charges of a legal services plan or a not-for-profit or qualified 
lawyer referral service. A legal service plan is a prepaid or group legal service plan or a similar 
delivery  system  that  assists  people  who  seek  to  secure  legal  representation.  A  lawyer  referral 
service,  on  the  other  hand,  is  any  organization  that  holds  itself  out  to  the  public  as  a  lawyer 
referral  service.  Qualified  referral  services  are  consumer-oriented  organizations  that  provide 
unbiased  referrals  to  lawyers  with  appropriate  experience  in  the  subject  matter  of  the 
representation  and  afford  other  client  protections,  such  as  complaint  procedures  or  malpractice 
insurance requirements.   

5. A lawyer who accepts assignments or referrals from a legal service plan or referrals from a 
lawyer referral service must act reasonably to assure that the activities of the plan or service are 
compatible  with  the  lawyer’s  professional  obligations.  Legal  service  plans  and  lawyer  referral 
services may communicate with the public, but such communication must be in conformity with 
these  Rules.  Thus,  advertising  must  not  be  false  or  misleading,  as  would  be  the  case  if  the 
communications of a group advertising program or a group legal services plan would mislead the 
public  to  think  that  it  was  a  lawyer  referral  service  sponsored  by  a  state  agency  or  bar 
association. 

eciprocal Referral Arrangements 

6. A lawyer does not violate paragraph (e) of this Rule by agreeing to refer clients to another 
lawyer or nonlawyer professional, so long as the reciprocal referral agreement is not exclusive, 
the  client  is  informed  of  the  referral  agreement,  and  the  lawyer  exercises  independent 
professional  judgment  in  making  the  referral.  Reciprocal  referral  agreements  should  not  be  of 
indefinite duration and should be reviewed periodically to determine whether they comply with 

  1

  R

  1

Misc. Docket No. 21-9061 

Page 28 

these Rules. A lawyer should not enter into a reciprocal referral agreement with another lawyer 
that  includes  a  division  of  fees  without  determining  that  the  agreement  complies  with  Rule 
1.04(f). 

7.  This  Rule  does  not  prohibit  a  lawyer  from  paying  for  a  meal  or  entertainment  for  a 
prospective client that has a nominal value or amounts to ordinary social hospitality. 

ule 7.04. Filing Requirements for Advertisements and Solicitation Communications 

a)  Except  as  exempt  under  Rule  7.05,  a  lawyer  shall  file  with  the  Advertising  Review 
Committee, State Bar of Texas, no later than ten (10) days after the date of dissemination of an 
advertisement of legal  services,  or  ten (10) days after  the date of a solicitation communication 
sent by any means: 

1)  a  copy  of  the  advertisement  or  solicitation  communication  (including  packaging  if 
applicable) in the form in which it appeared or will appear upon dissemination; 

2) a completed lawyer advertising and solicitation communication application; and 

3) payment to the State Bar of Texas of a fee authorized by the Board of Directors. 

  (

  (

  (

b)  If  requested  by  the  Advertising  Review  Committee,  a  lawyer  shall  promptly  submit 
information to substantiate statements or representations made or implied in an advertisement or 
solicitation communication. 

c)  A  lawyer  who  desires  to  secure  pre-approval  of  an  advertisement  or  solicitation 
communication  may  submit  to  the  Advertising  Review  Committee,  not  fewer  than  thirty  (30) 
days prior to the date of first dissemination, the material specified in paragraph (a), except that in 
the case of an advertisement or solicitation communication that has not yet been produced, the 
documentation will consist of a proposed text, production script, or other description, including 
details  about  the  illustrations,  actions,  events,  scenes,  and  background  sounds  that  will  be 
depicted. A finding of noncompliance by the Advertising Review Committee is not binding in a 
disciplinary  proceeding  or  action,  but  a  finding  of  compliance  is  binding  in  favor  of  the 
submitting  lawyer  as  to  all  materials  submitted  for  pre-approval  if  the  lawyer  fairly  and 
accurately described the advertisement or solicitation communication that was later produced. A 
finding of compliance is admissible evidence if offered by a party. 

eals or Entertainment for Prospective Clients 

omment:  

. The Advertising Review Committee shall report to the appropriate disciplinary authority any 
lawyer  whom,  based  on  filings  with  the  Committee,  it  reasonably  believes  disseminated  a 
communication  that  violates  Rules  7.01,  7.02,  or  7.03,  or  otherwise  engaged  in  conduct  that 
raises a substantial question as to that lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in 
other respects. See Rule 8.03(a).

a lawyer to substantiate statements or representations made or implied in communications about 
legal services that were not substantially motivated by pecuniary gain.

he following communications are exempt from the filing requirements of Rule 7.04 unless they 

fail to comply with Rules 7.01, 7.02, and 7.03:

Website-Related Filings 

2. While the entire website of a lawyer or law firm must be compliant with Rules 7.01 and 7.02, 
the only material on the website that may need to be filed pursuant to this Rule is the contents of 
the  homepage.    However,  even  a  homepage  does  not  need  to  be  filed  if  the  contents  of  the 
homepage are exempt from filing under the provisions of this Rule. Under Rule 7.04(c), a lawyer 
may voluntarily seek pre-approval of any material that is part of the lawyer’s website. 

ule 7.06. Prohibited Employment 

a)  A  lawyer  shall  not  accept  or  continue  employment  in  a  matter  when  that  employment  was 
procured by conduct prohibited by Rules 7.01 through 7.03, 8.04(a)(2), or 8.04(a)(9), engaged in 
by  that  lawyer  personally  or  by  another  person  whom  the  lawyer  ordered,  encouraged,  or 
knowingly permitted to engage in such conduct. 

b)  A  lawyer  shall  not  accept  or  continue  employment  in  a  matter  when  the  lawyer  knows  or 
reasonably  should  know  that  employment  was  procured  by  conduct  prohibited  by  Rules  7.01 
through  7.03,  8.04(a)(2),  or  8.04(a)(9),  engaged  in  by  another  person  or  entity  that  is  a 
shareholder, partner, or member of, an associate in, or of counsel to that lawyer’s firm; or by any 
other  person  whom  the  foregoing  persons  or  entities  ordered,  encouraged,  or  knowingly 
permitted to engage in such conduct.

(c) A lawyer who has not violated paragraph (a) or (b) in accepting employment in a matter shall 
not continue employment in that matter once the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that 
the person procuring the lawyer’s employment in the matter engaged in, or ordered, encouraged, 
or  knowingly  permitted  another  to  engage  in,  conduct  prohibited  by  Rules  7.01  through  7.03, 
8.04(a)(2), or 8.04(a)(9) in connection with the matter unless nothing of value is given thereafter 
in return for that employment. 

omment: 

ersonal Disqualification 

 

.  This  Rule  deals  with  three  different  situations:  personal  disqualification,  imputed 
disqualification, and referral-related payments.   

2.  Paragraph  (a)  addresses  situations  where  the  lawyer  in  question  has  violated  the  specified 
advertising rules or other provisions dealing with serious crimes and barratry. The Rule makes 
clear  that  the  offending  lawyer  cannot  accept  or  continue  to  provide  representation.  This 
prohibition  also  applies  if  the  lawyer  ordered,  encouraged,  or  knowingly  permitted  another  to 
violate the Rules in question. 

mputed Disqualification 
 

3. Second, paragraph (b) addresses whether other lawyers in a firm can provide representation if 
a  person  or  entity  in  the  firm  has  violated  the  specified  advertising  rules  or  other  provisions 
dealing  with  serious  crimes  and  barratry,  or  has  ordered,  encouraged,  or  knowingly  permitted 
another  to  engage  in  such  conduct.  The  Rule  clearly  indicates  that  the  other  lawyers  cannot 
provide representation if they knew or reasonably should have known that the employment was 
procured by conduct prohibited by the stated Rules. This effectively means that, in such cases, 
the  disqualification  that  arises  from  a  violation  of  the  advertising  rules  and  other  specified 
provisions is imputed to other members of the firm.   

estriction on Referral-Related Payments 

 

4. Paragraph (c) deals with situations where a lawyer knows or reasonably should know that a 
case referred to the lawyer or the lawyer’s law firm was procured by violation of the advertising 
rules or other specified provisions. The Rule makes clear that, even if the lawyer’s conduct did 
not  violate  paragraph  (a)  or  (b),  the  lawyer  can  continue  to  provide  representation  only  if  the 
lawyer does not pay anything of value, such as a referral fee, to the person making the referral.

region covering the county of appropriate venue of the Respondent’s election by transmitting a 
copy  of  the  Disciplinary  Petition  in  the  name  of  the  Commission  to  the  Clerk  of  the  Supreme 
Court of Texas Presiding Judge. The petition must contain:

upon one or more Complaints. 

EF.   A  listing  of  the  specific  rules  of  the  Texas  Disciplinary  Rules  of  Professional

.02.  Assignment of Judge:  

A. 

Assignment  Generally:  Upon  receipt  of  a  Disciplinary  Petition,  the  Clerk  of  the 
Supreme Court of Texas shall promptly bring the Petition to the attention of the 
Supreme  Court.  The  Supreme  Court  Presiding  Judge  shall  promptly  appoint 
assign an active district judge who does not reside in the Administrative Judicial

and the Clerk of the Supreme Court shall transmit a copy of the Supreme Court’s 
appointing Presiding Judge’s assignment order to the Chief Disciplinary Counsel. 
Should  the  judge  so  appointed  assigned  be  unable  to  fulfill  the  appointment 
assignment,  he  or  she  shall  immediately  notify  the  Clerk  of  the  Supreme  Court 
Presiding  Judge,  and  the  Supreme  Court  Presiding  Judge  shall  appoint  assign  a 
replacement  judge  whose  district  does  not  include  the  county  of  appropriate 
venue.  The  A  judge  appointed  assigned  under  this  Rule  shall  be  subject  to 
objection, recusal or disqualification as provided by law the Texas Rules of Civil 
Procedure  and  the  laws  of  this  state.  The  objection,  motion  seeking  recusal  or 
motion to disqualify must be filed by either party not later than sixty days from 
the date the Respondent is served with the Supreme Court’s order appointing the 
judge within the time provided by Rule 18a, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. In 
the  event  of  objection,  recusal  or  disqualification,  the  Supreme  Court  Presiding 
Judge shall appoint assign a  replacement judge within thirty days whose district 
does  not  include  the  county  of  appropriate  venue.  If  an  active  district  judge 
assigned  to  a  disciplinary  case  becomes  a  retired,  senior,  or  former  judge,  he  or 
she  may  be  assigned  by  the  Presiding  Judge  to  continue  to  preside  in  the  case, 
provided the judge has been placed on a visiting judge list. If the Presiding Judge 
decides not to assign the retired, senior, or former judge to continue to preside in 
the  case,  the  Presiding  Judge  shall  assign  an  active  district  judge  whose  district 
does  not  include  the  county  of  appropriate  venue.  A  visiting  judge  may only  be 
assigned if he or she was originally assigned to preside in the case while an active 
judge.  Any  judge  assigned  under  this  Rule  is  not  subject  to  objection  under 
Chapter 74, Government Code. 

B.  

Transfer  of  Case:  If  the  county  of  alleged  venue  is  successfully  challenged,  the 
case shall be transferred to the county of proper venue. If the case is transferred to 
a county in the assigned judge’s district, the judge must recuse himself or herself, 
unless  the  parties  waive  the  recusal  on  the  record.  In  the  event  of  recusal,  the 
Presiding  Judge  of  the  administrative  judicial  region  shall  assign  a  replacement 
judge whose district does not include the county of appropriate venue. If the case 
is  transferred  to  a  county  outside  the  administrative  judicial  region  of  the 
Presiding  Judge  who  made  the  assignment,  the  Presiding  Judge  of  the 
administrative  judicial  region  where  the  case  is  transferred  shall  oversee 
assignment  for  the  case  and  the  previously  assigned  judge  shall  continue  to 
preside  in  the  case  unless  he  or  she  makes  a  good  cause  objection  to  continued 
assignment,  in  which  case  the  Presiding  Judge  shall  assign  a  replacement  judge 
whose district does not include the county of appropriate venue. 

.03.  Filing, Service and Venue: After the trial judge has been appointed assigned, the Chief 
Disciplinary  Counsel  shall  promptly  file  the  Disciplinary  Petition  and  a  copy  of  the  Supreme 
Court’s appointing Order Presiding Judge’s assignment order with the district clerk of the county 
of alleged venue. The Respondent shall then be served as in civil cases generally with a copy of 
the Disciplinary Petition and a copy of the Supreme Court’s appointing Order Presiding Judge’s 
assignment  order.  In  a  Disciplinary  Action,  venue  shall  be  in  the  county  of  Respondent’s 
principal place of practice; or if the Respondent does not maintain a place of practice within the

State of Texas, in the county of Respondent’s residence; or if the Respondent maintains neither a 
residence nor a place of practice within the State of Texas, then in the county where the alleged 
Professional Misconduct occurred, in whole or in part. In all other instances, venue is in Travis 
County, Texas.

.01.  Orders  From  Other  Jurisdictions:  Upon  receipt  of  information  indicating  that  an 
attorney licensed to practice law in Texas has been disciplined in another jurisdiction, including 
by  any  federal  court  or  federal  agency,  the  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel  shall  diligently  seek  to 
obtain a certified copy of the order or judgment of discipline from the other jurisdiction, and file 
it  with  the  Board  of  Disciplinary  Appeals  along  with  a  petition  requesting  that the attorney  be 
disciplined  in  Texas.  A  certified  copy  of  the  order  or  judgment  is  prima  facie  evidence  of  the 
matters  contained  therein,  and  a  final  adjudication  in  another  jurisdiction  that  an  attorney 
licensed  to practice law  in Texas has committed Professional Misconduct  is conclusive for the 
purposes of a Disciplinary Action under this Part, subject to the defenses set forth in Rule 9.04 
below. For purposes of this Part, “discipline” by a federal court or federal agency means a public 
reprimand,  suspension,  or  disbarment;  the  term  does  not  include  a  letter  of  “warning”  or 
“admonishment” or a similar advisory by a federal court or federal agency.

exas Rule of Disciplinary Procedure 13.04—Clean 

3.04.  Voluntary Appointment of Custodian Attorney for Cessation of Practice: In lieu of 
the procedures set forth in Rules 13.02 and 13.03, an attorney ceasing practice or planning for 
the  cessation  of  practice  (“appointing  attorney”  for  purposes  of  this  Rule)  may  voluntarily 
designate  a  Texas  attorney  licensed  and  in  good  standing  to  act  as  custodian  (“custodian 
attorney” for purposes of this Rule) to assist in the final resolution and closure of the attorney’s 
practice. The terms of the appointing documents, which shall be signed and acknowledged by the 
appointing attorney and custodian attorney, may include any of the following duties assumed: 
 

Examine  the  client  matters,  including  files  and  records  of  the  appointing 
attorney’s  practice,  and  obtain  information  about  any  matters  that  may  require 
attention.  

Notify persons and entities that appear to be clients of the appointing attorney of 
the cessation of the law practice, and suggest that they obtain other legal counsel.  

Apply for extension of time before any court or any administrative body pending 
the client’s employment of other legal counsel.  

D.   With the prior consent of the client, file such motions and pleadings on behalf of 

the client as are required to prevent prejudice to the client’s rights.  

Give appropriate notice to persons or entities that may be affected other than the 
client.  

Arrange for surrender or delivery to the client of the client’s papers, files, or other 
property.  

he  custodian  attorney  shall  observe  the  attorney-client  relationship  and  privilege  as  if  the 
custodian were the attorney of the client and may make only such disclosures as are necessary to 
carry  out  the  purposes  of  this  Rule.  Except  for  intentional  misconduct  or  gross  negligence,  no 
person  acting  as  custodian  attorney  under  this  Rule  shall  incur  any  liability  by  reason  of  the 
actions taken pursuant to this Rule. 

he  privileges  and  limitations  of  liability  contained  herein  shall  not  apply  to  any  legal 

representation taken over by the custodian attorney. 

omment: Performing the duties of a custodian under this Rule does not create a client-lawyer 
relationship. If a lawyer serving as custodian assumes representation of a client, the lawyer’s role 
as custodian terminates, and the lawyer’s actions are subject to the Texas Disciplinary Rules of 
Professional Conduct regarding the client-lawyer relationship.
