filing the documents 
subject to a pending 
motion to seal and 
provide the Court a copy 
of the signed order when 
it is available. 

Record 

All trial court clerks and 
reporters are required to 
file all clerk’s records and 
reporter’s records in 
electronic form.   

See TRAP 28.4 for any special record 
requirements in particular cases. 

Sealed Records:  the attorney of record must 
come to the Court and show his/her 
identification.  Once the clerk verifies he is the 
attorney of record, the record will be checked 
out to the attorney. 

To obtain a copy of the electronic record, attorneys 
may come to the Court, send someone to the Court or 
request a copy of the electronic record by mail.  The 
Court will give a copy of the record to the attorney or 
the attorney’s representative free of charge as long as 
the record is not sealed.  The Court does not email 
records because of the size of the records and the 
limitations of email. 

Attorneys of record may also access civil and criminal 
documents through the attorney portal.  Documents (on 
active cases) are available on the portal for 24 months 
from the date of filing.  Sealed documents, .mp3, and, 
.mp4 exhibits are excluded from the attorney portal. 

Docketing 
Statements 

The docketing statement 
should be electronically 
filed.   

Pro se filers have the 
option to efile or file a 
paper copy. 

A docketing statement form, available on the 
Court’s website, can be filled out.  However, 
after completing the form, in order to create a 
PDF suitable for electronic filing you must use 
the Print to PDF feature that is explained on 
the Court’s website. 

Motions 

Attorneys in civil and 
criminal cases must file 
text-searchable 
documents electronically 
through 
www.eFileTexas.gov 
except a document under 
seal or subject to a motion 
to seal.   
The name of the 
electronic document must 
be under 60 characters. 

If the electronic motion 

The Chief Justice appoints motions panels for 
both civil and criminal motions. Generally, 
first motions for extension of time are granted 
by the clerk if filed before an extension of the 
expiration of the deadline and requests are not 
for more than 30 days. Except, in accelerated 
cases including parental termination and child 
protection cases as defined in TRAP 
28.4(a)(2). In parental termination and child 
protection cases, motions to extend may be 
granted upon a reasonable explanation of need 
but in shorter increments, in light of the 
Supreme Court’s 180-day guideline for 
disposition in such cases. Tex. R. Jud. Admin. 

The motions panel is reconstituted from time to time.  
The Court follows the TRAPs with respect to deciding 
motions. 

Motions are reviewed 
and decided on a daily 
basis according to the 
TRAPs.

contains more than one 
exhibit, the document 
must contain bookmarks 
to assist in locating each 
item, and be combined 
with the motion to create 
one computer file, unless 
that file would exceed the 
size limit prescribed by 
the electronic filing 
manager. 

Paper copies are not 
required. 

Unrepresented parties in 
civil and criminal cases 
may electronically file 
motions; however, 
electronic filing is not 
required.  

If filing by paper, one 
original is required. 
Attorneys in civil and 
criminal cases must file

document must be under

An electronically filed 
appendix that includes 
more than one item must 
contain bookmarks to 
assist in locating each 
item, and be combined 

Briefs 

The Court follows the TRAPs regarding 
briefs. See TRAPs 9, 38. 

The Court appreciates bookmarking the briefs.  The 
Court also appreciates any hyperlinking the parties 
want to provide. 

It is useful for the bookmarks in electronic briefs to list 
each section and heading in the brief (or a shortened 
version thereof) and each item in the appendix.   

In addition to the items required by TRAP38.1(k)(1), 
the appendix should include key authorities that are not 
available on Westlaw. 

If a brief contains sensitive data, file in accordance 
with the redaction rules in the TRAPs. 

Cross-Appeals:  See Local Rule 5. 

A motion for leave must 
accompany any late brief 
or any brief other than an 
appellant’s brief, an 
appellee's brief, or a 
reply brief 

Page 3 of 7 

Fewer than 5% of cases 
are heard en banc.  On 
occasion, the Court will 
decide to sit en banc 
without being requested 
to do so by the parties. 
If only one side requests 
argument in its brief and 
the Court grants it, the 
party that did not 
previously request 
argument should do so 
by filing a motion if it 
wants to argue.

Case 
Assignment 

The Court follows an internal rotation 
schedule for assigning cases.  Panels are 
reconstituted every 9 weeks. 

The panel has a formal conference and vote 
immediately following argument or submission.  
Panels rarely, but occasionally, meet informally before 
argument or submission but do not vote at that time. 

Oral 
Argument 

Follow the TRAPs in 
requesting oral argument.  

The Court typically allows 20 minutes per 
side, plus an additional 5 minutes for the 
appellant’s rebuttal. The Court allows more 
time only in extraordinary circumstances and 
only in response to a written motion.   

The Court does not automatically grant requests for 
argument.  The Court makes this decision on a case-
by-case basis.  Parties find out who is on their panel in 
a submission notice sent approximately 60 days before 
the submission date. 

ach panel votes whether to post the recording of oral 

argument to the Court’s website. 
Voting occurs at the formal conference following 
argument or submission. 
The Court does not release opinions on a particular 
day. 

 

Author is usually assigned at the formal 
conference after submission and is chosen by 
an internal rotation schedule.  The panel 
decides on a case-by-case basis whether to 
circulate opinions to the entire Court.   
Motions for rehearing are initially circulated 
to the author; the author makes 
recommendation; then it is circulated to other
