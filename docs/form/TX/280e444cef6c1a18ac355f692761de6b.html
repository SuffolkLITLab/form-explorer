Sec. 2(A) of the State Bar Rules. 

(b) 

If an Applicant has not satisfied all requirements for admission to the Texas  Bar 
within two years from the date that the Applicant is notified that the Applicant has 
passed all parts of the Texas Bar Examination, the Applicant’s examination scores 
shall be void; provided, however, that the Board may waive this provision for good 
cause shown. 

Rule 3 
Law Study Requirement 

(a) 

The  law  study  requirement  for  eligibility  of  an  Applicant  to  take  the  Texas  Bar

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

graduation with a J.D. degree or its equivalent from an approved law school; 

satisfaction of all requirements for graduation from an approved law school 
with a J.D. degree or its equivalent; or

requirements for graduation with a J.D. degree or its equivalent, except for 
not  more  than  four  semester  hours  or  its  equivalent  in  quarter  hours;

Rule 4 
Good Moral Character and Fitness Requirement 

(a)  No  one  shall  be  eligible  for  admission  to  the  Texas  Bar  or  for  certification  as  a 
Foreign Legal Consultant until the investigation of such person’s moral character 
and fitness has been completed, and it has been determined by the Board that such 
individual possesses good moral character and fitness. 

(b)  Good  moral  character  is  a  functional  assessment  of  character  and  fitness  of  a 
prospective lawyer.  The purpose of requiring an Applicant to possess present good 
moral  character  is  to  exclude  from  the  practice  of  law  those  persons  possessing 
character traits that are likely to result in injury to future clients, in the obstruction 
of the administration of justice, or in a violation of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of 
Professional  Conduct.  These  character  traits  usually  involve  either  dishonesty  or 
lack  of  trustworthiness  in  carrying  out  responsibilities.    There  may  be  other 
character traits that are relevant in the admission process, but such traits must have 
a rational connection with the Applicant’s present fitness or capacity to practice law 
and  accordingly  must  relate  to  the  legitimate  interests  of  Texas  in  protecting 
prospective clients and in safeguarding the system of justice within Texas. 

(c) 

Fitness, as used in these Rules, is the assessment of mental and emotional health as 
it  affects  the  competence  of  a  prospective  lawyer.  The  purpose  of  requiring  an 
Applicant to possess this fitness is to exclude from the practice of law any person 
having a mental or emotional illness or condition which would be likely to prevent 
the person from carrying out duties to clients, courts or the profession.  A person 
may be of good moral character, but may be incapacitated from proper discharge of 
his or her duties as a lawyer by such illness or condition.  The fitness required is a 
present fitness, and prior mental or emotional illness or conditions are relevant only 
so far as they indicate the existence of a present lack of fitness. 

(d)   The  following  provisions  shall  govern  the  determination  of  present  good  moral 
character and fitness of a Declarant or an Applicant who has been convicted of a 
felony in Texas or placed on probation for a felony with or without an adjudication 
of guilt in Texas, or who has been convicted or placed on probation with or without 
an adjudication of guilt in another jurisdiction for a crime which would be a felony 
in Texas.  A Declarant or Applicant may be found lacking in present good moral 
character  and  fitness  under  this  rule  based  on  the  underlying  facts  of  a  felony 
conviction or deferred adjudication, as well as based on the conviction or probation 
through deferred adjudication itself. 

(1) 

The  record  of  conviction  or  order  of  deferred  adjudication  is  conclusive 
evidence of guilt. 

(2)  An individual guilty of a felony under this rule is conclusively deemed not 
to have present good moral character and fitness and shall not be permitted 

Misc. Docket No. 17-9112 

 

Page 7 

 

 

to file a Declaration of Intention to Study Law or an Application for a period 
of five years after the completion of the sentence and/or period of probation. 

(3)  Upon a credible showing that a felony conviction or felony probation, either 
with or without an adjudication of guilt, has been reversed on review by an 
appellate court, or that an executive pardon has been granted, the Declarant 
or  Applicant  shall  be  permitted  to  file  a  Declaration  of  Intention  to  Study 
Law or an Application. 

(e) 

The  following  provisions  shall  govern  the  determination  of  present  good  moral 
character and fitness of a Declarant or Applicant who has been licensed to practice 
law  in  any  jurisdiction  and  has  been  disciplined,  or  allowed  to  resign  in  lieu  of 
discipline, in that jurisdiction. 

(1)  A certified copy of the order or judgment of discipline from the jurisdiction 
is prima facie evidence of the matters contained in such order or judgment, 
and  a  final  adjudication  in  the  other  jurisdiction  that  the  individual  in 
question  has  committed  professional  misconduct  is  conclusive  of  the 
professional misconduct alleged in such order or judgment. 

(2)  An  individual  disciplined  for  professional  misconduct  in  the  course  of 
practicing  law  in  any  jurisdiction  or  an  individual  who  resigned  in  lieu  of 
disciplinary action (“disciplined individual”) is deemed not to have present 
good  moral  character  and  fitness  and  is  therefore  ineligible  to  file  an 
Application  for  Admission  to  the  Texas  Bar  during  the  period  of  such 
discipline imposed by such jurisdiction,   and in the case of disbarment or 
resignation in lieu of disciplinary action,  until the disciplined individual has 
properly filed an application for re-licensure in the disciplining jurisdiction,  
in  accordance  with  the  procedures  established  for  re-licensure  in  that 
jurisdiction, and has obtained a final determination on that application. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing provision of this subsection (e)(2) and except 
as provided in Rule IV(d)(2), if the period of discipline imposed by another 
jurisdiction  exceeds  five  years,  the  disciplined  individual  may  file  an 
Application after the expiration of five years from the date of imposition of 
such  discipline,  provided  that  (s)he  has  obtained  a  final  determination  on 
his/her application for re-licensure in the disciplining jurisdiction. 

(3) 

The only defenses available to an Applicant or Declarant under section (e) 
are outlined below and must be proved by clear and convincing evidence: 

(A)    The procedure followed in the disciplining jurisdiction was so lacking 
in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of 
due process. 

(B)  There was such an infirmity of proof establishing the misconduct in 
the  other  jurisdiction  as  to  give  rise  to  the  clear  conviction  that  the 

Misc. Docket No. 17-9112 

 

Page 8 

 

 

Board,  consistent  with  its  duty,  should  not  accept  as  final  the 
conclusion on the evidence reached in the disciplining jurisdiction. 

(C)    The deeming of lack of present good moral character and fitness by the 
Board during the period required under the provisions of section (e) 
would result in grave injustice. 

(D)  The  misconduct  for  which  the  individual  was  disciplined  does  not 

constitute professional misconduct in Texas. 

(4) 

If the Board determines that one or more of the foregoing defenses has been 
established, it shall render such orders as it deems necessary and appropriate. 

(f) 

An  individual  who  applies  for  admission to  practice  law  in  Texas  or  who  files  a 
petition  for  redetermination  of  present  moral  character  and  fitness  after  the 
expiration of the five-year period required under subsection (d)(2) above or after the 
completion  of  the  disciplinary  period  assessed  or  ineligibility  period  imposed  by 
any  jurisdiction  under  subsection  (e)  above  shall  be  required  to  prove,  by  a 
preponderance of the evidence: 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

that the best interest of the public and the profession, as well as the ends of 
justice, would be served by his or her admission to practice law; 

that (s)he is of present good moral character and fitness; and 

that during the five years immediately preceding the present action, (s)he has 
been living a life of exemplary conduct. 

(g)  An individual who files a petition for redetermination of present  moral character 
and  fitness  after  a  negative  determination  based  on  a  felony  conviction,  felony 
probation  with  or  without  adjudication  of  guilt,  or  professional  misconduct  or 
resignation in lieu of disciplinary action and whose petition is denied after a hearing, 
is not eligible to file another petition for redetermination until after the expiration 
of three years from the date of the Board’s order denying the preceding petition for 
redetermination. 

If an Applicant is alleged to have violated the Bar Examination Security Policy, the 
Executive Director may withhold delivery of the Applicant’s exam results until the 
allegation  is  resolved  by  the  Board.  If,  after  notice  and  a  hearing,  the  Board 
determines that an Applicant violated the policy, the Board may deem the Applicant 
to  have  failed  the  exam  and  prohibit  the  Applicant  from  taking  the  exam  in  the 
future.

Rule 5 
Professional Responsibility Examination Requirement

Texas  until  such  person  has  furnished  to  the  Board  evidence  that  (s)he  has  passed  the 
Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE) with a scaled score of 85.

Rule 11 
Texas Bar Examination 

The Supreme Court, by separate order, has established a list of the subjects for the 
Texas Bar Examination which shall be open to public inspection at all reasonable 
times. 

The Texas Bar Examination shall be given at such places as the Board may direct. 

The Texas Bar Examination shall be given two times each year, beginning on the 
Tuesday before the last Wednesday of the months of February and July, unless the 
Board otherwise directs. 

The approved Applicants for an examination are required to be in attendance at the 
time and place designated by the Board. 

The Texas Bar Examination shall last two and one-half days and shall consist of the 
Multistate Performance Test (MPT), given on Tuesday morning; the Procedure and 
Evidence  Questions  (P&E),  given  on  Tuesday  morning;  the  Multistate  Bar 
Examination  (MBE),  given  on  Wednesday;  and  the  Texas  Essay  Questions 
(Essays), given on Thursday.  After grading the answers to the MPT, the P&E, and 
the Essays, the resulting raw scores on each of these portions will be scaled to the 
Multistate Bar Examination, using the standard deviation  method.   Scores on the 
various portions of the examination will be weighted as follows: MPT, 10%; P&E, 
10%; MBE, 40%; and Essays, 40%.  Applicants who earn a combined scaled score 
of 675 (out of a possible 1000 points) shall pass the examination.  A partial score 
on  any  portion  of  a  failed  examination  shall  not  be  applied  to  any  subsequent 
examination. 

(f) 

An  Applicant  may  take  no  more  than  five  (5)  examinations.  However,  for  good 
cause  shown,  the  Board  at  its  discretion  may  waive  this  limitation  upon  such 
conditions as the Board may prescribe. 

(g)  Any Applicant who has failed at least two Texas Bar Examinations may submit a 
written request, within two weeks of the release of the examination results, for a 
Formal  Review  of  the  Applicant’s  performance  on  the  immediately  preceding 
examination (excluding the MBE multistate portion).  Such Formal Review shall 
take place in Austin, Texas at a time selected by the Board and shall consist of an 
individual oral review of such examination papers by the examining members of the 
Board. Regardless of the number of examinations taken, an Applicant may receive 
only one Formal Review under the provisions of this paragraph. 

(h)  Any  Applicant  who  has  failed  the  examination  is  eligible  to  receive  a  written 
analysis  of  the  Applicant’s  performance  on  the  examination.  The  Board  may 
determine the form and content of the written analysis. .

(e) 

 

The Board shall keep, for one year from the date of every examination, all failing 
examinations.    The  Board  shall  not  be  required  to  keep  any  part  of  passing 
examinations. 

 

Rule 12  
Examinees With Disabilities 

The  Texas  Bar  Examination  shall  be  administered  to  all  eligible  Applicants  in  a 
reasonable manner, while maintaining the integrity of the examination.  In each city 
in which an examination is administered, the Board shall provide facilities that are 
reasonably  accessible  and  which  enable  persons  having  disabilities  to  take  the 
examination. 

(b)  Any Applicant who desires special testing accommodations based upon a disability 
shall submit a written request to the Board on forms designated by the Board, such 
request to be submitted at the same time as the Application is submitted. 

(c)  A request for special testing accommodations must be accompanied by written proof 
evidencing the existence of the disability. Statements from licensed physicians or a 
professional specialist that specifically set forth the physical, mental or emotional 
handicap or disability and the relationship between the disability and the inability 
to take the examination under standard conditions shall be required.   The Board 
may require additional information or evidence from the Applicant and may, at its 
option, seek professional evaluation of such data.  The Applicant will be responsible 
for  the  cost  of  obtaining  documented  medical  evidence  and  other  required 
information. 

(d)  After considering the written request of the Applicant and the evidence submitted, 
the Board shall determine what reasonable special testing accommodations will be 
granted. 

Board deliberations and determinations regarding the request of an Applicant for 
testing accommodations on the Texas Bar Examination shall be closed to the public 
and associated records are confidential. However, this does not limit the Board’s 
option  under  (c)  above  to  seek  professional  evaluation  of  any  confidential 
information supplied by applicants.

Rule 15  
Hearings 

The Board shall set a time and place for a hearing on the question of the requisite 
moral  character  and  fitness  of  an  Applicant  or  Declarant,  under  the  following 
circumstances: 

(1)  When  any  Applicant  or  Declarant  who  is  the  subject  of  a  preliminary 
negative character and fitness determination files a written request for such 
a hearing within thirty (30) days of his or her receipt of the Board’s letter 
containing the notice of such determination; or 

(2)  When the Board determines that, in the interest of fairness, such a hearing is 
necessary  regardless  of  whether  the  Applicant  or  Declarant  files  a  timely 
request for hearing. 

If there are pending proceedings involving the Applicant or Declarant, the resolution 
of which could impact the determination of his/her character and fitness, the Board 
may  exercise  its  discretion  to  defer  the  hearing  until  such  time  as  the  pending 
proceeding is resolved. 

Board  hearings,  deliberations,  and  determinations  relating  to  the  moral  character 
and fitness of an Applicant or Declarant shall be closed to the public and records 
relating to these subjects are confidential.  On written request of an Applicant or 
Declarant, however, the Applicant or Declarant is entitled to have the hearing open 
to persons designated by the Applicant or Declarant. 

Reasonable notice of the time and place for the hearing may be served electronically 
if the email address of the party or attorney to be served is on file with the Board. 
Any  notice  not  served  electronically  may  be  served  in  person,  by  mail,  by 
commercial delivery service, by fax, by email or by such other means as the Board 
may direct.  

(e)  An Applicant or Declarant, either before or after receiving notice of a hearing, may 
agree to waive the hearing, stipulate to the facts regarding good moral character and 
fitness, and allow the Board to proceed with making a final determination as to the 
Applicant’s  moral  character  and  fitness  under  these  Rules.    An  Applicant  may 
additionally agree to a Probationary License and to any conditions imposed by the 
Board to protect the public. 

(f) 

At the hearing: 

(1) 

The Board shall have the burden of proof and be required to present evidence 
that  the  Applicant  or  Declarant  does  not  have  the  requisite  good  moral 
character  or  fitness.    Upon  the  admission  of  such  evidence,  the  burden  of 
proof  shall  shift  to  the  Applicant  or  Declarant  to  show  that  the  Applicant 
possesses  good  moral  character  and  fitness  as  defined  in  these  Rules.  
However, in a redetermination hearing on a Probationary License, the burden 

Misc. Docket No. 17-9112 

 

Page 28 
 

 

of proof shall be on the Probationary Licensee to demonstrate that (s)he has 
complied with the conditions of the Probationary License. 

The Applicant or Declarant shall be given the opportunity to be present in 
person and by attorney, to present evidence, to confront and to cross-examine 
adverse witnesses, and to present argument to the Board on the issues of law 
and fact; provided,  however, that  evidence  otherwise inadmissible  may  be 
admitted if the evidence is of a type on which a reasonably prudent person 
commonly relies in the conduct of the person’s affairs. 

(g) 

In  connection  with  hearings  conducted  under  this Rule,  the  Board  shall  have  the 
authority to administer oaths, issue subpoenas, take depositions, and employ court 
reporters. 

(h)  After the hearing, in closed deliberations, the Board may: 

determine that an Applicant or Declarant has the requisite present good moral 
character  and  fitness  and,  in  the  case  of  an  Applicant,  should  be 
recommended for admission to the Texas Bar; 

determine that a Declarant should be granted conditional approval of his or 
her present good moral character and fitness and be required to meet such 
conditions as the Board deems appropriate; 

determine that an Applicant should be granted conditional approval of his or 
her  present  good  moral  character  and  fitness  and  be  recommended  for  a 
Probationary License subject to the terms of Rule 16, after meeting all other 
requirements of these Rules; 

determine  that  an  Applicant  or  Declarant  does  not  possess  the  requisite 
present good moral character and fitness required for admission to the Texas 
Bar; or 

defer a decision until such time as the Board has the opportunity to consider 
further information, evaluations, or documentation as deemed necessary by 
the Board; 

in the case of a probationary license, recommend to the Supreme Court that 
the license should be renewed in its present form, renewed with additional or 
amended conditions, or revoked and no regular license be issued. 

(2) 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

(5) 

(6) 

(i)  Within a reasonable period of time after the decision is made, the Board shall furnish 
to the Applicant or Declarant a written order setting forth the decision of the Board. 
If  the  decision  is  adverse,  such  order  shall  specify  the  bases  of  the  Board’s 
determination and shall include an objective list of actions, if any, the Applicant or 
Declarant may take to become qualified for a license to practice law in Texas.  Any 
such order containing a determination that the Applicant or Declarant suffers from 
chemical dependency shall include provisions setting out the rights under Section 
82.038, Texas Government Code.

(5) 

An  individual  who  has  been  the  subject  of  a  Board  order  containing  a  negative 
character  and  fitness  determination  may  petition  the  Board  in  writing  for  a 
redetermination hearing subject to the provisions of Rule XV herein on the issue of 
character and fitness, as follows: 

(1)  No petition for redetermination may be filed earlier than the date specified in 
the Board’s order (or if none, then no earlier than twelve months from the 
date of the hearing), nor more often than once every twelve months. 

Such individual shall have the burden of proof as to rehabilitation and the 
possession of present good moral character and fitness. 

Such  individual  shall  complete  and  file  with  the  Board  a  Supplemental 
Investigation Form and pay the requisite fees therefore within thirty (30) days 
of the filing of the redetermination petition. 

This subsection (j) shall not apply to character and fitness redeterminations 
in Probationary License cases, which are governed under the provisions of 
Rule 16. 

(k) 

The following provisions shall govern judicial review of the Board’s decisions: 

The affected Applicant or Declarant shall institute, in the district courts of 
Travis County, Texas proceedings for review of such decision within sixty 
(60) days after the date the written decision is mailed to the Applicant. 

The petition for review shall name the Board as defendant and shall be served 
on the Executive Director of the Board. 

(3)  After  service  of  such  petition,  and  within  the  time  permitted  for  filing  an 
answer,  the  Board  shall  file  with  the  district  court  a  certified  copy  of  the 
record of the Board’s proceedings. 

The review of the Board’s decision shall be tried by the court without a jury. 

The court shall determine from the certified record on file whether or not the 
Board’s  decision  is  reasonably  supported  by  substantial  evidence.      The 
reviewing court may affirm the action complained of or remand the matter to 
the Board for further proceedings. 

(6)  Appeals from any final judgment of the court may be taken by either party 
in the manner provided for in civil actions generally, but no appeal bond shall 
be required of the Board. 

(l) 

The  Board  shall  have  the  authority  to  adopt  such  other  rules  of  procedure  for 
character and fitness hearings, not inconsistent with these Rules, as the Board deems 
necessary or appropriate to implement these Rules. 

(m)  Decisions  of  the  Board  on  matters  other  than  character  and  fitness  following  a 
hearing under this Rule shall not be subject to judicial review unless another statute 
or rule specifically provides to the contrary.

The Board may assess costs against any Applicant or Declarant who has been sent 
reasonable notice of a hearing before the Board and who does not appear. 

Rule 16  
Probationary Licenses 

(a) 

The Board shall have the authority to grant conditional approval of the present good 
moral  character  and  fitness  of  an  Applicant  and  to  recommend  the  granting  of  a 
Probationary License, after the Applicant meets all other requirements under these 
Rules, in the following circumstances: 

(1)  when  the  Board  determines  that  the  Applicant  suffers  from  chemical 
dependency or has been convicted of, or is on probation for, a first offense 
of driving while intoxicated under Texas Penal Code §49.04; or 

(2) 

in other circumstances in which, on the record before it, the Board determines 
that  the  protection  of  the  public  requires  the  temporary  monitoring  of  the 
Applicant in question. 

(b) 

(c) 

The Board  shall not have the authority to refuse to recommend the  granting of a 
Probationary  License  to  an  Applicant  who  has  passed  the  applicable  bar 
examination solely because the Applicant suffers from chemical dependency or has 
been convicted for a first offense for driving while intoxicated under Texas Penal 
Code §49.04. 

In any order recommending the issuance of a Probationary License to practice law, 
the Board shall specify the conditions of the license, which may include, but are not

the  Probationary  License,  unless  for  good  cause  shown,  the  Board  waives 
such requirement; or 

requiring the individual to take specific actions designed to cure or end any 
deficiencies in his or her moral character and fitness, as determined by the 
Board.

(d) 

Probationary Licenses shall expire as follows: 

(1)  A Probationary License issued solely because of the Board’s determination 
that  the  individual  suffers  from  chemical  dependency  shall  expire  on  the 
second  anniversary  of  the  date  on  which  it  is  issued,  unless  temporarily 
extended hereunder. 

(2)  Any  other  Probationary  License  shall  expire  on  the  date  specified  by  the 
Board  in  the  Order  recommending  issuance  of  the  Probationary  License, 
unless temporarily extended hereunder. 

(3) 

The term of a Probationary License may be temporarily extended, upon the 
request of the Probationary Licensee, in the event that the normal expiration 
date falls before the Board has had the opportunity to make a redetermination 
as provided hereunder. 

(e)  A Probationary Licensee may apply for a renewal of the Probationary License or 
for a regular license to practice law, by filing a written request and a Supplemental 
Investigation  Form  and  the  requisite  fees,  at  least  sixty  (60)  days  prior  to  the

The Board shall require any Probationary Licensee issued a Probationary License 
because  of  a  determination  of  chemical  dependency,  prior  to  the  redetermination 
hearing, to submit to an evaluation, at the sole cost of the Probationary Licensee, by 
a licensed mental health professional designated by the Board. 

(g)  After  a  hearing  held  subject  to  the  provisions  of  Rule  15  herein  on  the 
redetermination of the character and fitness of a Probationary Licensee, the Board 
may: 

(1) 

recommend, upon a finding of the requisite good moral character and fitness, 
the issuance of a regular license to practice law in Texas;  provided,  however,  
that in any case in which a Probationary License was issued on the basis of 
chemical  dependency,  the  Board  shall  not  recommend  the  Probationary 
Licensee  for  regular  admission until  the  Board  finds  that  the  Probationary 
Licensee  has  successfully  completed  treatment  and  has  been  free  from 
chemical dependency for the preceding two years; 

(2) 

recommend, upon a finding that a condition of the Probationary License has 
been violated:

expense of the Probationary Licensee. 

The Board shall initiate and maintain a working relationship with the State Bar of 
Texas to coordinate disclosure of information concerning an individual’s status as a 
Probationary Licensee.  On request, the Board, in coordination with the State Bar of 
Texas,  shall  inform  a  member  of  the  public  whether  a  particular  individual  is  a 
Probationary Licensee.  This disclosure may  occur via the official website of the 
State Bar of Texas or other means reasonably available to members of the public.  
Any information that forms the basis for the issuance of the Probationary License is 
confidential, as required by statute. 

A  person  whose  Probationary  License  has  been  terminated  or  revoked  upon 
recommendation by the Board must begin the licensure process anew in accordance 
with the Board order recommending such termination or revocation if the person 
wishes to attempt re-licensure. 

Rule 17

(a)  Upon an Applicant’s becoming entitled to a license under these Rules, the Board 
must  certify  the  Applicant  to  the  Supreme  Court,  whose  Clerk  will  issue  the

Rule 19 
Requirements for Participation in Texas Proceedings by a Non-Resident Attorney 

(a)  A reputable attorney, licensed in another state or in a foreign jurisdiction but not in 
Texas,  who  resides  outside  of  Texas  may  seek  permission  to  participate  in  the 
proceedings  of  any  particular  cause  in  a  Texas  court  by  complying  with  the 
requirements of Texas Government Code Section 82.0361 concerning payment of a 
non-resident  attorney  fee  to  the  Board  of  Law  Examiners  as  a  mandatory  initial 
requirement.  Upon  completion  of 
receipt  of  an 
this 
acknowledgment issued by the Board of Law Examiners, the non-resident attorney 
shall  file  with  the  applicable  Texas  court  a  written,  sworn  motion  requesting 
permission to participate in a particular cause. The motion shall contain: 

requirement  and 

(1) 

(2) 

the office address, telephone number, fax number, and email address of the 
non-resident attorney movant; 

the name and State Bar card number of an attorney licensed in Texas, with 
whom the non-resident attorney will be associated in the Texas proceedings, 

                                                      
1 This fee shall be imposed when a document (Declaration, Application, Supplemental investigation, etc.,) is received, 
for the second and subsequent times, which is determined to be incomplete (e.g., unanswered questions, not signed, 
not notarized, incorrect fees, etc.).

and that attorney’s office address, telephone number, fax number, and email 
address; 

a list of all cases and causes, including cause number and caption, in Texas 
courts  in  which  the  non-resident  attorney  has  appeared  or  sought  leave  to 
appear or participate within the past two years; 

a list of jurisdictions in which the non-resident attorney is licensed, including 
federal courts, and a statement that the non-resident attorney is or is not an 
active member in good standing in each of those jurisdictions; 

a statement that the non-resident attorney has or has not been the subject of 
disciplinary  action  by  the  Bar  or  courts  of  any  jurisdiction  in  which  the 
attorney is licensed within the preceding five years, and a description of any 
such disciplinary actions; 

a  statement  that  the  non-resident  attorney  has  or  has  not  been  denied 
admission  to  the  courts  of  any  State  or  to  any  federal  court  during  the 
preceding five years; 

a statement that the non-resident attorney is familiar with the State Bar Act, 
the  State  Bar  Rules,  and  the  Texas  Disciplinary  Rules  of  Professional 
Conduct governing the conduct of members of the State Bar of Texas, and 
will at all times abide by and comply with the same so long as such Texas 
proceeding  is  pending  and  said  Applicant  has  not  withdrawn  as  counsel 
therein. 

The motion of the non-resident attorney seeking permission to participate in Texas 
proceedings  must  be  accompanied  by  motion  of  the  resident  practicing  Texas 
attorney with whom the non-resident attorney will be associated in the proceeding 
of a particular cause. The motion must contain a statement that the resident attorney 
finds the Applicant to be a reputable attorney and recommends that the Applicant 
be granted permission to participate in the particular proceeding before the court. 

The motion of the non-resident attorney must also be accompanied by the proof of 
payment  or  proof  of  indigency  acknowledgment  issued  by  the  Board  of  Law 
Examiners. 

The court may examine the non-resident attorney to determine that the non-resident 
attorney  is  aware  of  and  will  observe  the  ethical  standards  required  of  attorneys 
licensed in Texas and to determine whether the non-resident attorney is appearing 
in courts in Texas on a frequent basis.  If the court determines that the non-resident 
attorney is not a reputable attorney who will observe the ethical standards required 
of Texas attorneys, that the non-resident attorney has been appearing in courts in 
Texas on a frequent basis, that the non-resident attorney has been engaging in the 
unauthorized practice of law in the state of Texas, or that other good cause exists, 
the court or hearing officer may deny the motion.

If, after being granted permission to participate in the proceedings of any particular 
cause in Texas, the non-resident attorney engages in professional misconduct as that 
term is defined by the State Bar Act, the State Bar Rules, or the Texas Disciplinary 
Rules  of  Professional  Conduct,  the  court  may  revoke  the  non-resident  attorney’s 
permission to participate in the Texas proceedings and  may  cite the non-resident 
attorney for contempt.  In addition, the court may refer the matter to the Grievance 
Committee of the Bar District in which the court is located. 

The filing of a motion under this Rule constitutes submission to the jurisdiction of 
the Grievance Committee for the District in which the court is located.  The county 
in  which  the  court  is  located  is  considered  the  county  of  residence  of  the  non-
resident  attorney  for  purposes  of  determining  venue  in  any  disciplinary  action 
involving the attorney. 

Rule 20 
Organizational and Miscellaneous Powers of the Board

examinee or anyone inquiring on behalf of an examinee. 

(b)  Unless the Court designates the member of the Board who shall serve as Chair, the 
Board shall have authority to select a Chair. The Board shall select other officers 
from its own membership, assign their respective duties, may delegate power and 
authority to one or more of its members, and shall have authority to formulate the 
procedure of the Board. 

(c) 

The Board shall keep and maintain its files on Declarants and Applicants until such 
time as their destruction is authorized, as follows: 

(1) 

(2) 

Files in which a regular license has been issued shall be destroyed five (5) 
years from the date the license was issued. 

Files in which a Probationary License has been issued but no Regular License 
has been issued shall be destroyed ten (10) years from the date of the last 
formal activity on the file (i.e., petition for redetermination, hearing, order, 
expiration  of  last  term  of  probationary  license,  issuance  of  regular license 
following redetermination hearing, etc.). 

(3) 

Files in which a Declaration, but not an Application, has been filed shall be

data base pertinent and necessary data contained therein. 

Insofar as may be consistent with these Rules, the Board is authorized to make all 
reasonable regulations, including written interpretations of general application with 
respect to these Rules or provisions of general application for relevant subjects not 
covered by these Rules.  The Board may also prescribe forms and certificates to be 
executed by Applicants for admission to the Texas Bar, whether for a first license 
to practice law or as a practicing attorney of another jurisdiction, or certificates or 
other forms to be executed by or on behalf of the Board itself. 

The Board is given discretion in the interpretation and application of these Rules.   
For good cause shown to the satisfaction of the Board, upon written request, waivers 
of specific requirements described in these Rules may be granted, unless it appears 
there from that no exceptions are contemplated by the Supreme Court. 

The Board may, in conjunction with its investigation of moral character and fitness 
or the administration of the bar examination, require Declarants and Applicants to 
furnish a complete set of fingerprints. 

The Board may delegate its duties to a panel of the Board or to the staff, as necessary 
and  where  not  prohibited  by  law;  provided,  however,  that  the  Board  shall  not 
delegate  to  staff  its  authority  to  make  final  determinations  that  an  Applicant  or 
Declarant lacks the requisite good moral character and fitness. 

The Supreme Court hereby creates the Board of Law Examiners Fund which shall 
be comprised of all fees and monies received and interest earned by the Board and 
shall be used by the Board to administer the functions of the Supreme Court and the 
Board relating to the licensing of lawyers as directed by the Court.  The Fund shall 
be maintained in one or more financial institutions in Texas, as designated by the 
Board. 

The  Board  shall  have  full  power  to  contract  for  the  performance  of  all  of  its 
functions,  and  any  person  dealing  or  contracting  with  the  Board  shall  be 
conclusively entitled to rely upon the Board’s written determination that the expense 
thus incurred or contracted is for a proper function of the Board. 

The disbursement of funds shall be according to such rules, regulations and budgets 
as the Board may adopt.  The Board shall keep a full record of such receipts and 
disbursements.

of a particular cause in a Texas court.

Bar Rules. 

§4

themselves to be, members of the State Bar of Texas or licensed to practice law in the State

A  military  attorney  granted  limited  permission  to  practice  law  under  this  rule  may  not 
demand  or  receive  any  compensation,  beyond  the  military  attorney’s  regular  pay  and 
allowances, for the legal services provided under this rule. 

The practice of a military attorney under this rule shall be subject to the limitations and 
restrictions of 10 U.S.C. § 1044 and the regulations of that attorney’s military service and

proceeding is pending, provided that written permission of the court or tribunal is 
obtained in advance of the appearance. 

All pleadings filed in a civil proceeding by a military attorney under this rule shall state 
that limited permission to practice in Texas has been obtained under this rule; include the 
name, complete address, and telephone number of the military legal office of the military 
attorney  representing  the  client  and  of  the  military  attorney’s  supervisory  Staff  Judge 
Advocate or other supervisory military attorney; and include the name, grade, and armed 
service  of  the  military  attorney  who  is  registered  under  this  rule  and  providing 
representation.  Upon making an appearance in a civil proceeding, the military attorney

pending, designating each individual authorized to accept service of process on the military 
attorney’s  behalf  and  providing  the  name  and  complete  address  of  each  authorized 
individual.  If the military attorney does not file this document, the military attorney’s agent 
for service of process shall be the supervisory Staff Judge Advocate or supervisory military

Discipline 

A military attorney granted limited permission to practice law in Texas under this rule is 
subject  to  the  Rules  Governing  Admission  to  the  Bar  of  Texas,  the  Texas  Disciplinary 
Rules of Professional Conduct, the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure, and any other 
rules and laws governing the discipline of attorneys admitted to the State Bar of Texas.  
The State Bar of Texas, Supreme Court of Texas, and other Texas courts have jurisdiction 
over  the  discipline  of  the  military  attorney,  regardless  of  whether  the  military  attorney 
retains the  right  to  practice  in  the  state,  for  the  military  attorney’s  professional conduct 
while practicing in this state. This jurisdiction includes, but is not limited to, the authority 
-  concurrent  with  the  Board’s  authority  under  section  5  of  this  rule  -  to  terminate  the 
military attorney’s privilege to practice law in Texas under this rule.

Rule 3III 

Law Study Requirement 

(a) 

The  law  study  requirement  for  eligibility  of  an  Applicant  to  take  the  Texas  Bar 
Examination, unless otherwise provided by these Rules, is met by: 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

graduation with a J.D. degree or its equivalent from an approved law school; 

satisfaction of all requirements for graduation from an approved law school 
with a J.D. degree or its equivalent; or

requirements for graduation with a J.D. degree or its equivalent, except for 
not  more  than  four  semester  hours  or  its  equivalent  in  quarter  hours; 
provided,  however,  that  no  person  shall  be  licensed  to  practice  law  until

Rule 4IV 

Good Moral Character and Fitness Requirement 

(a)  No  one  shall  be  eligible  for  admission  to  the  Texas  Bar  or  for  certification  as  a 
Foreign Legal Consultant until the investigation of such person’s moral character 
and fitness has been completed, and it has been determined by the Board that such 
individual possesses good moral character and fitness. 

(b)  Good  moral  character  is  a  functional  assessment  of  character  and  fitness  of  a 
prospective lawyer.  The purpose of requiring an Applicant to possess present good 
moral  character  is  to  exclude  from  the  practice  of  law  those  persons  possessing 
character traits that are likely to result in injury to future clients, in the obstruction 
of the administration of justice, or in a violation of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of 
Professional  Conduct.  These  character  traits  usually  involve  either  dishonesty  or 
lack  of  trustworthiness  in  carrying  out  responsibilities.    There  may  be  other 
character traits that are relevant in the admission process, but such traits must have 
a rational connection with the Applicant’s present fitness or capacity to practice law 
and  accordingly  must  relate  to  the  legitimate  interests  of  Texas  in  protecting 
prospective clients and in safeguarding the system of justice within Texas. 

(c) 

Fitness, as used in these Rules, is the assessment of mental and emotional health as 
it  affects  the  competence  of  a  prospective  lawyer.  The  purpose  of  requiring  an 
Applicant to possess this fitness is to exclude from the practice of law any person 
having a mental or emotional illness or condition which would be likely to prevent 
the person from carrying out duties to clients, courts or the profession.  A person 
may be of good moral character, but may be incapacitated from proper discharge of 
his or her duties as a lawyer by such illness or condition.  The fitness required is a 
present fitness, and prior mental or emotional illness or conditions are relevant only 
so far as they indicate the existence of a present lack of fitness. 

(d)   The  following  provisions  shall  govern  the  determination  of  present  good  moral 
character and fitness of a Declarant or an Applicant who has been convicted of a 
felony in Texas or placed on probation for a felony with or without an adjudication 
of guilt in Texas, or who has been convicted or placed on probation with or without 
an adjudication of guilt in another jurisdiction for a crime which would be a felony 
in Texas.  A Declarant or Applicant may be found lacking in present good moral 
character  and  fitness  under  this  rule  based  on  the  underlying  facts  of  a  felony 
conviction or deferred adjudication, as well as based on the conviction or probation 
through deferred adjudication itself. 

(1) 

The  record  of  conviction  or  order  of  deferred  adjudication  is  conclusive 
evidence of guilt. 

Misc. Docket No. 17-9112 

 

Page 48 
 

 

(2)  An individual guilty of a felony under this rule is conclusively deemed not 
to have present good moral character and fitness and shall not be permitted 
to file a Declaration of Intention to Study Law or an Application for a period 
of five years after the completion of the sentence and/or period of probation. 

(3)  Upon a credible showing that a felony conviction or felony probation, either 
with or without an adjudication of guilt, has been reversed on review by an 
appellate court, or that an executive pardon has been granted, the Declarant 
or  Applicant  shall  be  permitted  to  file  a  Declaration  of  Intention  to  Study 
Law or an Application. 

(e) 

The  following  provisions  shall  govern  the  determination  of  present  good  moral 
character and fitness of a Declarant or Applicant who has been licensed to practice 
law  in  any  jurisdiction  and  has  been  disciplined,  or  allowed  to  resign  in  lieu  of 
discipline, in that jurisdiction. 

(1)  A certified copy of the order or judgment of discipline from the jurisdiction 
is prima facie evidence of the matters contained in such order or judgment, 
and  a  final  adjudication  in  the  other  jurisdiction  that  the  individual  in 
question  has  committed  professional  misconduct  is  conclusive  of  the 
professional misconduct alleged in such order or judgment. 

(2)  An  individual  disciplined  for  professional  misconduct  in  the  course  of 
practicing  law  in  any  jurisdiction  or  an  individual  who  resigned  in  lieu  of 
disciplinary action (“disciplined individual”) is deemed not to have present 
good  moral  character  and  fitness  and  is  therefore  ineligible  to  file  an 
Application  for  Admission  to  the  Texas  Bar  during  the  period  of  such 
discipline imposed by such jurisdiction,   and in the case of disbarment or 
resignation in lieu of disciplinary action,  until the disciplined individual has 
properly filed an application for re-licensure in the disciplining jurisdiction,  
in  accordance  with  the  procedures  established  for  re-licensure  in  that 
jurisdiction, and has obtained a final determination on that application. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing provision of this subsection (e)(2) and except 
as provided in Rule IV(d)(2), if the period of discipline imposed by another 
jurisdiction  exceeds  five  years,  the  disciplined  individual  may  file  an 
Application after the expiration of five years from the date of imposition of 
such  discipline,  provided  that  (s)he  has  obtained  a  final  determination  on 
his/her application for re-licensure in the disciplining jurisdiction. 

(3) 

The only defenses available to an Applicant or Declarant under section (e) 
are outlined below and must be proved by clear and convincing evidence: 

(A)    The procedure followed in the disciplining jurisdiction was so lacking 
in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of 
due process. 

Misc. Docket No. 17-9112 

 

Page 49 
 

 

(B)  There was such an infirmity of proof establishing the misconduct in 
the  other  jurisdiction  as  to  give  rise  to  the  clear  conviction  that  the 
Board,  consistent  with  its  duty,  should  not  accept  as  final  the 
conclusion on the evidence reached in the disciplining jurisdiction. 

(C)    The deeming of lack of present good moral character and fitness by the 
Board during the period required under the provisions of section (e) 
would result in grave injustice. 

(D)  The  misconduct  for  which  the  individual  was  disciplined  does  not 

constitute professional misconduct in Texas. 

(4) 

If the Board determines that one or more of the foregoing defenses has been 
established, it shall render such orders as it deems necessary and appropriate. 

(f) 

An  individual  who  applies  for  admission to  practice  law  in  Texas  or  who  files  a 
petition  for  redetermination  of  present  moral  character  and  fitness  after  the 
expiration of the five-year period required under subsection (d)(2) above or after the 
completion  of  the  disciplinary  period  assessed  or  ineligibility  period  imposed  by 
any  jurisdiction  under  subsection  (e)  above  shall  be  required  to  prove,  by  a 
preponderance of the evidence: 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

that the best interest of the public and the profession, as well as the ends of 
justice, would be served by his or her admission to practice law; 

that (s)he is of present good moral character and fitness; and 

that during the five years immediately preceding the present action, (s)he has 
been living a life of exemplary conduct. 

(g)  An individual who files a petition for redetermination of present  moral character 
and  fitness  after  a  negative  determination  based  on  a  felony  conviction,  felony 
probation  with  or  without  adjudication  of  guilt,  or  professional  misconduct  or 
resignation in lieu of disciplinary action and whose petition is denied after a hearing, 
is not eligible to file another petition for redetermination until after the expiration 
of three years from the date of the Board’s order denying the preceding petition for 
redetermination. 

If an Applicant is alleged to have violated the Bar Examination Security Policy, the 
Executive Director may withhold delivery of the Applicant’s exam results until the 
allegation  is  resolved  by  the  Board.  If,  after  notice  and  a  hearing,  the  Board 
determines that an Applicant violated the policy, the Board may deem the Applicant 
to  have  failed  the  exam  and  prohibit  the  Applicant  from  taking  the  exam  in  the 
future.

Rule 11XI 

Texas Bar Examination 

The Supreme Court, by separate order, has established a list of the subjects for the 
Texas Bar Examination which shall be open to public inspection at all reasonable 
times. 

The Texas Bar Examination shall be given at such places as the Board may direct. 

The Texas Bar Examination shall be given two times each year, beginning on the 
Tuesday before the last Wednesday of the months of February and July, unless the 
Board otherwise directs. 

The approved Applicants for an examination are required to be in attendance at the 
time and place designated by the Board. 

The Texas Bar Examination shall last two and one-half days and shall consist of the 
Multistate Performance Test (MPT), given on Tuesday morning; the Procedure and 
Evidence  Questions  (P&E),  given  on  Tuesday  morning;  the  Multistate  Bar 
Examination  (MBE),  given  on  Wednesday;  and  the  Texas  Essay  Questions 
(Essays), given on Thursday.  After grading the answers to the MPT, the P&E, and 
the Essays, the resulting raw scores on each of these portions will be scaled to the 
Multistate Bar Examination, using the standard deviation  method.   Scores on the 
various portions of the examination will be weighted as follows: MPT, 10%; P&E, 
10%; MBE, 40%; and Essays, 40%.  Applicants who earn a combined scaled score 
of 675 (out of a possible 1000 points) shall pass the examination.  A partial score 
on  any  portion  of  a  failed  examination  shall  not  be  applied  to  any  subsequent 
examination.

An  Applicant  may  take  no  more  than  five  (5)  examinations.  However,  for  good 
cause  shown,  the  Board  at  its  discretion  may  waive  this  limitation  upon  such 
conditions as the Board may prescribe. 

(g)  Any Applicant who has failed at least two Texas Bar Examinations may submit a 
written request, within two weeks of the release of the examination results, for a 
Formal  Review  of  the  Applicant’s  performance  on  the  immediately  preceding 
examination (excluding the MBE multistate portion).  Such Formal Review shall 
take place in Austin, Texas at a time selected by the Board and shall consist of an 
individual oral review of such examination papers by the examining members of the 
Board. Regardless of the number of examinations taken,  an Applicant may receive 
only one Formal Review under the provisions of this paragraph, provided, however, 
that no Applicant may obtain both a Formal Review and Informal Review of the 
same examination. 

(h)  Any  Applicant  who  has  failed  the  examination  is  eligible  to  receive  a  written 
analysis  may  submit  a  written  request,  within  two  weeks  of  the  release  of  the 
examination results, for an Informal Review of the Applicant’s performance on the 
examinationhis/her  failed  parts  of  the  immediately  preceding  examination 
(excluding the  MBE  multistate  portion).  The  Board  may  determine  the  form  and 
content of the written analysis. The form of such Informal Review shall be either 
oral  or  written,  at  the  discretion  of  the  examining  members  of  the  Board.    An 
Applicant may request an Informal Review each time (s)he fails an examination. 

The Board shall keep, for one year from the date of every examination, all failing 
examinations.    The  Board  shall  not  be  required  to  keep  any  part  of  passing 
examinations.

Rule 12XII  

Examinees With Disabilities 

The  Texas  Bar  Examination  shall  be  administered  to  all  eligible  Applicants  in  a 
reasonable manner, while maintaining the integrity of the examination.  In each city 
in which an examination is administered, the Board shall provide facilities that are 
reasonably  accessible  and  which  enable  persons  having  disabilities  to  take  the 
examination. 

(b)  Any Applicant who desires special testing accommodations based upon a disability 
shall submit a written request to the Board on forms designated by the Board, such 
request to be submitted at the same time as the Application is submitted. 

(c)  A request for special testing accommodations must be accompanied by written proof 
evidencing the existence of the disability. Statements from licensed physicians or a 
professional specialist that specifically set forth the physical, mental or emotional 
handicap or disability and the relationship between the disability and the inability 
to take the examination under standard conditions shall be required.   The Board 
may require additional information or evidence from the Applicant and may, at its 
option, seek professional evaluation of such data.  The Applicant will be responsible 
for  the  cost  of  obtaining  documented  medical  evidence  and  other  required 
information. 

(d)  After considering the written request of the Applicant and the evidence submitted, 
the Board shall determine what reasonable special testing accommodations will be 
granted. 

Board deliberations and determinations regarding the request of an Applicant for 
testing accommodations on the Texas Bar Examination shall be closed to the public 
and associated records are confidential. However, this does not limit the Board’s 
option  under  (c)  above  to  seek  professional  evaluation  of  any  confidential 
information supplied by applicants.

Rule 15XV Hearings 

Misc. Docket No. 17-9112

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

The Board shall set a time and place for a hearing on the question of the requisite 
moral  character  and  fitness  of  an  Applicant  or  Declarant,  under  the  following 
circumstances: 

(1)  When  any  Applicant  or  Declarant  who  is  the  subject  of  a  preliminary 
negative character and fitness determination files a written request for such 
a hearing within thirty (30) days of his or her receipt of the Board’s letter 
containing the notice of such determination; or 

(2)  When the Board determines that, in the interest of fairness, such a hearing is 
necessary  regardless  of  whether  the  Applicant  or  Declarant  files  a  timely 
request for hearing. 

If there are pending proceedings involving the Applicant or Declarant, the resolution 
of which could impact the determination of his/her character and fitness, the Board 
may  exercise  its  discretion  to  defer  the  hearing  until  such  time  as  the  pending 
proceeding is resolved. 

Board  hearings,  deliberations,  and  determinations  relating  to  the  moral  character 
and fitness of an Applicant or Declarant shall be closed to the public and records 
relating to these subjects are confidential.  On written request of an Applicant or 
Declarant, however, the Applicant or Declarant is entitled to have the hearing open 
to persons designated by the Applicant or Declarant. 

Reasonable notice of the time and place for the hearing may be served electronically 
if the email address of the party or attorney to be served is on file with the Board. 
Any  notice  not  served  electronically  may  be  served  in  person,  by  mail,  by 
commercial delivery service, by fax, by email or by such other means as the Board 
may  direct.  The  Applicant  or  Declarant  shall  be  given  reasonable  notice,  by 
registered or certified  mail, return receipt requested, of the time and place of the 
hearing. 

(e)  An Applicant or Declarant, either before or after receiving notice of a hearing, may 
agree to waive the hearing, stipulate to the facts regarding good moral character and 
fitness, and allow the Board to proceed with making a final determination as to the 
Applicant’s  moral  character  and  fitness  under  these  Rules.    An  Applicant  may 
additionally agree to a Probationary License and to any conditions imposed by the 
Board to protect the public. 

(f) 

At the hearing: 

(1) 

The Board or any opponent of approval of the moral character and fitness of 
the Applicant or Declarant, shall have the burden of proof and be required to 
present evidence that the Applicant or Declarant does not have the requisite 
good moral character or fitness.  Upon the admission of such evidence, the 
burden  of  proof  shall  shift  to  the  Applicant  or  Declarant  to  show  that  the 
Applicant  possesses  good  moral  character  and  fitness  as  defined  in  these 
Rules.  However, in a redetermination hearing on a Probationary License, the 

Misc. Docket No. 17-9112 

 

Page 56 
 

 

burden of proof shall be on the Probationary Licensee to demonstrate that 
(s)he has complied with the conditions of the Probationary License. 

(2) 

The Applicant or Declarant shall be given the opportunity to be present in 
person and by attorney, to present evidence, to confront and to cross-examine 
adverse witnesses, and to present argument to the Board on the issues of law 
and fact; provided,  however, that  evidence  otherwise inadmissible  may  be 
admitted if the evidence is of a type on which a reasonably prudent person 
commonly relies in the conduct of the person’s affairs. 

(3) 

Evidence  and  argument  for  or  against  the  Applicant  or  Declarant  may  be 
presented by the Board or any other interested party. 

(g) 

In  connection  with  hearings  conducted  under  this Rule,  the  Board  shall  have  the 
authority to administer oaths, issue subpoenas, take depositions, and employ court 
reporters. 

(h)  After the hearing, in closed deliberations, the Board may: 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

(5) 

(6) 

determine that an Applicant or Declarant has the requisite present good moral 
character  and  fitness  and,  in  the  case  of  an  Applicant,  should  be 
recommended for admission to the Texas Bar; 

determine that a Declarant should be granted conditional approval of his or 
her present good moral character and fitness and be required to meet such 
conditions as the Board deems appropriate; 

determine that an Applicant should be granted conditional approval of his or 
her  present  good  moral  character  and  fitness  and  be  recommended  for  a 
Probationary License subject to the terms of Rule 16XVI, after meeting all 
other requirements of these Rules; 

determine  that  an  Applicant  or  Declarant  does  not  possess  the  requisite 
present good moral character and fitness required for admission to the Texas 
Bar; or 

defer a decision until such time as the Board has the opportunity to consider 
further information, evaluations, or documentation as deemed necessary by 
the Board; 

in the case of either a temporary or probationary license, recommend to the 
Supreme  Court  that  the  license  should  be  renewed  in  its  present  form, 
renewed with additional or amended conditions, or revoked and no regular 
license be issued. 

(i)  Within a reasonable period of time after the decision is made, the Board shall furnish 
to the Applicant or Declarant a written order setting forth the decision of the Board. 
If  the  decision  is  adverse,  such  order  shall  specify  the  bases  of  the  Board’s 
determination and shall include an objective list of actions, if any, the Applicant or 

Misc. Docket No. 17-9112 

 

Page 57 
 

 

Declarant may take to become qualified for a license to practice law in Texas.  Any 
such order containing a determination that the Applicant or Declarant suffers from 
chemical dependency shall include provisions setting out the rights under Section 
82.038, Texas Government Code. 

(j) 

An  individual  who  has  been  the  subject  of  a  Board  order  containing  a  negative 
character  and  fitness  determination  may  petition  the  Board  in  writing  for  a 
redetermination hearing subject to the provisions of Rule XV herein on the issue of 
character and fitness, as follows: 

(1)  No petition for redetermination may be filed earlier than the date specified in 
the Board’s order (or if none, then no earlier than twelve months from the 
date of the hearing), nor more often than once every twelve months. 

Such individual shall have the burden of proof as to rehabilitation and the 
possession of present good moral character and fitness. 

Such  individual  shall  complete  and  file  with  the  Board  a  Supplemental 
Investigation Form and pay the requisite fees therefore within thirty (30) days 
of the filing of the redetermination petition. 

This subsection (j) shall not apply to character and fitness redeterminations 
in Probationary License cases, which are governed under the provisions of 
Rule 16XVI. 

(k) 

The following provisions shall govern judicial review of the Board’s decisions: 

The affected Applicant or Declarant shall institute, in the district courts of 
Travis County, Texas proceedings for review of such decision within sixty 
(60) days after the date the written decision is mailed to the Applicant. 

The petition for review shall name the Board as defendant and shall be served 
on the Executive Director of the Board. 

(3)  After  service  of  such  petition,  and  within  the  time  permitted  for  filing  an 
answer,  the  Board  shall  file  with  the  district  court  a  certified  copy  of  the 
record of the Board’s proceedings. 

The review of the Board’s decision shall be tried by the court without a jury. 

The court shall determine from the certified record on file whether or not the 
Board’s  decision  is  reasonably  supported  by  substantial  evidence.      The 
reviewing court may affirm the action complained of or remand the matter to 
the Board for further proceedings. 

(6)  Appeals from any final judgment of the court may be taken by either party 
in the manner provided for in civil actions generally, but no appeal bond shall 
be required of the Board.

(c) 

The  Board  shall  have  the  authority  to  adopt  such  other  rules  of  procedure  for 
character and fitness hearings, not inconsistent with these Rules, as the Board deems 
necessary or appropriate to implement these Rules. 

(m)  Decisions  of  the  Board  on  matters  other  than  character  and  fitness  following  a 
hearing under this Rule shall not be subject to judicial review unless another statute 
or rule specifically provides to the contrary. 

The Board may assess costs against any Applicant or Declarant who has been sent 
reasonable notice of a hearing before the Board and who does not appear. 

Rule 16XVI  

Probationary Licenses 

The Board shall have the authority to grant conditional approval of the present good 
moral  character  and  fitness  of  an  Applicant  and  to  recommend  the  granting  of  a 
Probationary License, after the Applicant meets all other requirements under these 
Rules, in the following circumstances: 

(1)  when  the  Board  determines  that  the  Applicant  suffers  from  chemical 
dependency or has been convicted of, or is on probation for, a first offense 
of driving while intoxicated under Texas Penal Code §49.04; or 

(2) 

in other circumstances in which, on the record before it, the Board determines 
that  the  protection  of  the  public  requires  the  temporary  monitoring  of  the 
Applicant in question. 

The Board  shall not have the authority to refuse to recommend the granting  of a 
Probationary  License  to  an  Applicant  who  has  passed  the  applicable  bar 
examination solely because the Applicant suffers from chemical dependency or has 
been convicted for a first offense for driving while intoxicated under Texas Penal 
Code §49.04. 

In any order recommending the issuance of a Probationary License to practice law,  
the Board shall specify the conditions of the license, which may include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

(5) 

prohibiting the use of alcohol or controlled substances; 

requiring treatment for chemical dependency; 

requiring the individual to practice law under the supervision of an attorney 
admitted to the Texas Bar; 

requiring submission to periodic, random drug testing; 

requiring the individual to report periodically to the Board; 

Misc. Docket No. 17-9112 

 

Page 59 
 

 

(6) 

(7) 

(8) 

requiring  suspension,  for  any  portion  of  the  probationary  period,  of  an 
activity for which a license to practice law is required; 

requiring the individual to reside continuously in Texas during the period of 
the  Probationary  License,  unless  for  good  cause  shown,  the  Board  waives 
such requirement; or 

requiring the individual to take specific actions designed to cure or end any 
deficiencies in his or her moral character and fitness, as determined by the 
Board. 

(d) 

Probationary Licenses shall expire as follows: 

(1)  A Probationary License issued solely because of the Board’s determination 
that  the  individual  suffers  from  chemical  dependency  shall  expire  on  the 
second  anniversary  of  the  date  on  which  it  is  issued,  unless  temporarily 
extended hereunder. 

(2)  Any  other  Probationary  License  shall  expire  on  the  date  specified  by  the 
Board  in  the  Order  recommending  issuance  of  the  Probationary  License, 
unless temporarily extended hereunder. 

(3) 

The term of a Probationary License may be temporarily extended, upon the 
request of the Probationary Licensee, in the event that the normal expiration 
date falls before the Board has had the opportunity to make a redetermination 
as provided hereunder. 

(e)  A Probationary Licensee may apply for a renewal of the Probationary License or 
for a regular license to practice law, by filing a written request and a Supplemental 
Investigation  Form  and  the  requisite  fees,  at  least  sixty  (60)  days  prior  to  the 
expiration date of the Probationary License. 

(f) 

The Board shall require any Probationary Licensee issued a Probationary License 
because  of  a  determination  of  chemical  dependency,  prior  to  the  redetermination 
hearing, to submit to an evaluation, at the sole cost of the Probationary Licensee, by 
a licensed mental health professional treatment facility designated approved by the 
Board. 

(g)  After  a  hearing  held  subject  to  the  provisions  of  Rule  15XV  herein  on  the 
redetermination of the character and fitness of a Probationary Licensee, the Board 
may: 

(1) 

recommend, upon a finding of the requisite good moral character and fitness, 
the issuance of a regular license to practice law in Texas;  provided,  however,  
that in any case in which a Probationary License was issued on the basis of 
chemical  dependency,  the  Board  shall  not  recommend  the  Probationary 
Licensee  for  regular  admission until  the  Board  finds  that  the  Probationary 
Licensee  has  successfully  completed  treatment  and  has  been  free  from 
chemical dependency for the preceding two years; 

Misc. Docket No. 17-9112

(i) 

(j) 

 

(2) 

recommend, upon a finding that a condition of the Probationary License has 
been violated: 

(A) 

(B) 

extension of the Probationary License; or 

termination or immediate revocation of the Probationary License. 

The  Board  shall  initiate  and  maintain  a  working  relationship  with  the  Lawyers 
Assistance Program or similar program of the State Bar of Texas in order to provide 
for the evaluation and referral to treatment for those persons issued a Probationary 
License hereunder.  The treatment and professional evaluation shall be at the sole 
expense of the Probationary Licensee. 

The Board shall initiate and maintain a working relationship with the State Bar of 
Texas to coordinate disclosure of information concerning an individual’s status as a 
Probationary Licensee.  On request, the Board, in coordination with the State Bar of 
Texas,  shall  inform  a  member  of  the  public  whether  a  particular  individual  is  a 
Probationary Licensee.  This disclosure may  occur via the official website of the 
State Bar of Texas or other means reasonably available to members of the public.  
Any information that forms the basis for the issuance of the Probationary License is 
confidential, as required by statute. 

A  person  whose  Probationary  License  has  been  terminated  or  revoked  upon 
recommendation by the Board must begin the licensure process anew in accordance 
with the Board order recommending such termination or revocation if the person 
wishes to attempt re-licensure. 

Rule 17XVII 

Issuance of License Certificates and Cancellation of License Unlawfully Obtained 

(a)  Upon an Applicant’s becoming entitled to a license under these Rules, the Board 
must  certify  the  Applicant  to  the  Supreme  Court,  whose  Clerk  will  issue  the 
corresponding license in the form of a written certificate.  The license may be issued 
only in the name shown on a valid, government-issued identification card, except 
that a given name may be omitted or represented by an initial if the Applicant so 
requests  in  writing.  No  license  may  be  issued  using  an  alias,  assumed  name, 
nickname, or abbreviation of a name. 

(b)   All  law  licenses  are  issued  on  the  condition  that  the  Applicant  has  faithfully 
complied with these Rules.  If at any time it appears that an Applicant has obtained 
a license fraudulently or by willful failure to comply with these Rules, after notice 
and hearing, the Board may recommend to the Supreme Court that the license be 
withdrawn and canceled, and the name of the license holder stricken from the roll 
of attorneys. 

Misc. Docket No. 17-9112 

 

Page 61 
 

(c)  No  license  issued  under  this  Rule  is  valid  unless  the  license  holder  has  paid  the 
required fees and has enrolled in the State Bar of Texas in compliance with the State 
Bar Rules. 

(d) 

The  license  certificate  belongs  to  the  Supreme  Court  of  Texas  and  must  be 
surrendered to the Court upon proper demand.

(7) 

the office address, telephone number, fax number, and email address of the 
non-resident attorney movant; 

the name and State Bar card number of an attorney licensed in Texas, with 
whom the non-resident attorney will be associated in the Texas proceedings, 
and that attorney’s office address, telephone number, fax number, and email 
address; 

a list of all cases and causes, including cause number and caption, in Texas 
courts  in  which  the  non-resident  attorney  has  appeared  or  sought  leave  to 
appear or participate within the past two years; 

a list of jurisdictions in which the non-resident attorney is licensed, including 
federal courts, and a statement that the non-resident attorney is or is not an 
active member in good standing in each of those jurisdictions; 

a statement that the non-resident attorney has or has not been the subject of 
disciplinary  action  by  the  Bar  or  courts  of  any  jurisdiction  in  which  the 
attorney is licensed within the preceding five years, and a description of any 
such disciplinary actions;

admission  to  the  courts  of  any  State  or  to  any  federal  court  during  the 
preceding five years;

The court may examine the non-resident attorney to determine that the non-resident 
attorney  is  aware  of  and  will  observe  the  ethical  standards  required  of  attorneys 
licensed in Texas and to determine whether the non-resident attorney is appearing 
in courts in Texas on a frequent basis.  If the court determines that the non-resident 
attorney is not a reputable attorney who will observe the ethical standards required 
of Texas attorneys, that the non-resident attorney has been appearing in courts in 
Texas on a frequent basis, that the non-resident attorney has been engaging in the 
unauthorized practice of law in the state of Texas, or that other good cause exists, 
the court or hearing officer may deny the motion. 

If, after being granted permission to participate in the proceedings of any particular 
cause in Texas, the non-resident attorney engages in professional misconduct as that 
term is defined by the State Bar Act, the State Bar Rules, or the Texas Disciplinary 
Rules  of  Professional  Conduct,  the  court  may  revoke  the  non-resident  attorney’s 
permission to participate in the Texas proceedings and  may  cite the non-resident 
attorney for contempt.  In addition, the court may refer the matter to the Grievance 
Committee of the Bar District in which the court is located. 

The filing of a motion under this Rule constitutes submission to the jurisdiction of 
the Grievance Committee for the District in which the court is located.  The county 
in  which  the  court  is  located  is  considered  the  county  of  residence  of  the  non-
resident  attorney  for  purposes  of  determining  venue  in  any  disciplinary  action 
involving the attorney. 

Rule 20XX 

Organizational and Miscellaneous Powers of the Board 

(a)  Upon completion of the tabulation of grades given on an examination and approval 
of such tabulation by the Chairman, the grades shall be mailed to the examinees at 
the addresses given on their Applications released to the examinees in the manner 
directed by the Board. The Deans of the Law Schools in the State of Texas shall be 
furnished a list of the candidates passing the Bar examination after release of results 
to  the  individual  candidates.  Prior  to  mailing  releasing  grades  to  examinees,  no 
grades shall be given by the Board by telephone to any person,  nor shall any Board 
member or employee of the Board give grades in person to an examinee or anyone 
inquiring on behalf of an examinee. 

(b)  Unless the Court designates the member of the Board who shall serve as Chairman, 
the Board shall have authority to select a Chairman. The Board shall select other 
officers  from  its  own  membership,  assign  their  respective  duties,  may  delegate 
power  and  authority  to  one  or  more  of  its  members,  and  shall  have  authority  to 
formulate the procedure of the Board. 

(c) 

The Board shall keep and maintain its files on Declarants and Applicants until such 
time as their destruction is authorized, as follows:

Files in which a regular license has been issued shall be destroyed five (5) 
years from the date the license was issued. 

Files in which a Probationary License has been issued but no Regular License 
has been issued shall be destroyed ten (10) years from the date of the last 
formal activity on the file (i.e., petition for redetermination, hearing, order, 
expiration  of  last  term  of  probationary  license,  issuance  of  regular license 
following redetermination hearing, etc.). 

Files in which a Declaration, but not an Application, has been filed shall be 
destroyed five (5) years from the date the Declaration was filed. 

Files in which an Application has been filed, but no Regular or Probationary 
License  issued,  shall  be  destroyed  five  (5)  years  from  the  date  of  the  last 
formal  activity  on  the  file  (i.e.,  Re-Application,  examination,  hearing, 
petition for redetermination, etc.), after inputting into the Board’s computer 
data base pertinent and necessary data contained therein. 

Insofar as may be consistent with these Rules, the Board is authorized to make all 
reasonable regulations, including written interpretations of general application with 
respect to these Rules or provisions of general application for relevant subjects not 
covered by these Rules.  The Board may also prescribe forms and certificates to be 
executed by Applicants for admission to the Texas Bar, whether for a first license 
to practice law or as a practicing attorney of another jurisdiction, or certificates or 
other forms to be executed by or on behalf of the Board itself. 

The Board is given discretion in the interpretation and application of these Rules.   
For good cause shown to the satisfaction of the Board, upon written request, waivers 
of specific requirements described in these Rules may be granted, unless it appears 
there from that no exceptions are contemplated by the Supreme Court. 

The Board may, in conjunction with its investigation of moral character and fitness 
or the administration of the bar examination, require Declarants and Applicants to 
furnish a complete set of fingerprints. 

The Board may delegate its duties to a panel of the Board or to the staff, as necessary 
and  where  not  prohibited  by  law;  provided,  however,  that  the  Board  shall  not 
delegate  to  staff  its  authority  to  make  final  determinations  that  an  Applicant  or 
Declarant lacks the requisite good moral character and fitness. 

The Supreme Court hereby creates the Board of Law Examiners Fund which shall 
be comprised of all fees and monies received and interest earned by the Board and 
shall be used by the Board to administer the functions of the Supreme Court and the 
Board relating to the licensing of lawyers as directed by the Court.  The Fund shall 
be maintained in one or more financial institutions in Texas, as designated by the 
Board.

conclusively entitled to rely upon the Board’s written determination that the expense 
thus incurred or contracted is for a proper function of the Board. 

The disbursement of funds shall be according to such rules, regulations and budgets 
as the Board may adopt.  The Board shall keep a full record of such receipts and 
disbursements.

of and within the scope of their official duties relating to the character and fitness 
qualification,  eligibility,  examination,  monitoring,  and  licensing  of  Declarants,

privileged, and civil suits for damages predicated thereon are barred. 

Rule 22XXII 

Registration Program for Military Attorneys  
on Military Assignment in Texas but not Licensed in Texas 

§1 

General Requirements for Registration and Limited Permission to Practice Law 

Upon the Board’s approval, a military attorney who is admitted to practice law in a state 
other than Texas or in a territory of the United States or the District of Columbia, and who 
is a full-time, active-duty military officer serving in the office of a Staff Judge Advocate 
of  the  United  States  Air  Force,  Army,  Navy,  Marines,  or  Coast  Guard,  a  Naval  Legal 
Service Office, or a Trial Service Office, located in Texas, may appear as an attorney and 
practice law before the courts and other tribunals of Texas in any civil proceeding, subject 
to the conditions and limitations in this rule and applicable law.   This rule does not preclude 
a  non-resident  military  attorney’s  request  under  Rule  19XIX  to  participate  in  the 
proceedings of a particular cause in a Texas court. 

§2 

Specific Requirements 

Misc. Docket No. 17-9112 

 

Page 68 
 

 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

The military attorney must be of good moral character and apply for registration annually 
by: 

filing  an  application  and  paying  fees  in  the  form  and  manner  that  the  Board 
prescribes; 

presenting satisfactory proof of admission to practice law and current good standing 
as a member of the bar in any state or territory of the United States or the District of 
Columbia; 

complying with the training requirements in this rule; and 

furnishing any additional information or proof that the Board requires in the course 
of processing the application. 

§3 

Training 

Permission to practice law under this rule requires that the military attorney complete at 
least 15 credit hours of Accredited Continuing Legal Education (CLE) Activity, including 
a minimum of three hours of legal ethics or professional responsibility, within the first year 
of registration.   The minimum of three hours of legal ethics or professional responsibility 
must also be completed within each subsequent year of registration.  As used in this rule, 
the term Accredited CLE Activity has the meaning ascribed to it in Article XII of the State 
Bar Rules. 

§4 

No State Bar of Texas Membership or Texas Law License Granted  

Military attorneys permitted to practice law under this rule are not, and shall not represent 
themselves to be, members of the State Bar of Texas or licensed to practice law in the State 
of Texas. 

§5 

Termination 

The military attorney’s privilege to practice law under this rule may be terminated by the 
Board at any time, with or without cause.  In addition, the military attorney’s privileges 
under this rule shall be terminated when the military attorney ends full-time, active-duty 
military service as described in section 1 of this rule.  The military attorney registered under 
this rule or the military attorney’s supervisory Staff Judge Advocate or other supervisory 
military attorney shall: 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

advise  the  Board  as  soon  as  practicable  of  any  change  in  the  military  attorney’s 
status that may affect the military attorney’s right to practice law under this rule; 

immediately notify each court or tribunal in which the military attorney is involved 
in a pending civil proceeding when the  military attorney is unable to continue to 
serve as counsel under this rule; and 

immediately obtain substitution of counsel when the military attorney involved in 
any pending civil proceeding is unable to continue to serve as counsel under this 
rule.

Subject Matter Jurisdiction, Authorized Clients, and Pleading Requirements 

A military attorney granted limited permission to practice law under this rule may, with 
approval of the military attorney’s supervisory Staff Judge Advocate or other supervisory 
military attorney, represent: 

enlisted military personnel in grades E-1 through E-4; and  

immediate  family  members  who  qualify  under  armed  services  regulations  as 
dependents of enlisted military personnel in grades E-1 through E-4 if the military 
attorney’s supervisory Staff Judge Advocate or other supervisory military attorney 
determines that retaining civilian legal counsel for the matter in controversy would 
present a substantial financial hardship for the family member involved. 

A military attorney granted limited permission to practice law under this rule may represent 
other  military  personnel, as well as their immediate family  members who qualify under 
armed services regulations as their dependents, only if the military attorney receives written 
approval from the Judge Advocate General of the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, or Air Force, 
or the Staff Judge Advocate to the Commandant of the Marine Corps, as appropriate.  The 
written authorization must include a determination that retaining civilian legal counsel for 
the  matter  in  controversy  would  present  a  substantial  financial  hardship  for  the  service 
member or family member involved. 

A  military  attorney  granted  limited  permission  to  practice  law  under  this  rule  may  not 
demand  or  receive  any  compensation,  beyond  the  military  attorney’s  regular  pay  and 
allowances, for the legal services provided under this rule. 

The practice of a military attorney under this rule shall be subject to the limitations and 
restrictions of 10 U.S.C. § 1044 and the regulations of that attorney’s military service and 
shall be further limited to: 

cases arising under all Titles, except Title 3, of the Family Code;  

guardianships; 

landlord-tenant disputes on behalf of tenants;  

consumer-law cases on behalf of consumers;  

garnishment defenses; 

estate planning and probate matters; 

enforcement of rights under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act;  

enforcement  of  rights  under 
Reemployment Rights Act; and 

the  Uniformed  Services  Employment  and 

other  cases  within  the  discretion  of  the  court  or  tribunal  before  which  the  civil 
proceeding is pending, provided that written permission of the court or tribunal is 
obtained in advance of the appearance. 

Misc. Docket No. 17-9112 

 

Page 70 
 

 

 

All pleadings filed in a civil proceeding by a military attorney under this rule shall state 
that limited permission to practice in Texas has been obtained under this rule; include the 
name, complete address, and telephone number of the military legal office of the military 
attorney  representing  the  client  and  of  the  military  attorney’s  supervisory  Staff  Judge 
Advocate or other supervisory military attorney; and include the name, grade, and armed 
service  of  the  military  attorney  who  is  registered  under  this  rule  and  providing 
representation.  Upon making an appearance in a civil proceeding,  the military attorney 
shall  file  a  document  with  the  court  or  other  tribunal  in  which  the  civil  proceeding  is 
pending, designating each individual authorized to accept service of process on the military 
attorney’s  behalf  and  providing  the  name  and  complete  address  of  each  authorized 
individual.  If the military attorney does not file this document, the military attorney’s agent 
for service of process shall be the supervisory Staff Judge Advocate or supervisory military 
attorney  whose  name  appears  on  the  military  attorney’s  most  recent  application  filed 
pursuant to this rule, or the successor to that office. 

§7 

Discipline 

A military attorney granted limited permission to practice law in Texas under this rule is 
subject  to  the  Rules  Governing  Admission  to  the  Bar  of  Texas,  the  Texas  Disciplinary 
Rules of Professional Conduct, the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure, and any other 
rules and laws governing the discipline of attorneys admitted to the State Bar of Texas.  
The State Bar of Texas, Supreme Court of Texas, and other Texas courts have jurisdiction 
over  the  discipline  of  the  military  attorney,  regardless  of  whether  the  military  attorney 
retains the  right  to  practice  in  the  state,  for  the  military  attorney’s  professional conduct 
while practicing in this state. This jurisdiction includes, but is not limited to, the authority 
-  concurrent  with  the  Board’s  authority  under  section  5  of  this  rule  -  to  terminate  the 
military attorney’s privilege to practice law in Texas under this rule.
