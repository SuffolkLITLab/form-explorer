and leave is entered, approved, and maintained in the State’s time and leave system in CAPPS.  To the extent that 
any terms herein conflict with state law, state law controls. 

efinition of Terms 

A.   FLSA  (Fair  Labor  Standards  Act)  -  is  the  federal  law  that  establishes  overtime  pay  and 
recordkeeping  standards  affecting  full-time  and  part-time  workers 
in  the  private  and 
governmental  sectors.  Court  employees  may  find  their  FLSA  status  on  their  monthly  earning 
statements.  

B.   FLSA Exempt Employee – an employee who is not subject to (i.e., is exempt from) the provisions 

of the FLSA.  

provisions of the FLSA.  

C.   FLSA  Non-Exempt  Employee  –  an  employee  who  is  subject  to  (i.e.  is  not  exempt  from)  the 

D.   Member of an employee’s family – the following persons are considered to be members of an 
employee’s  immediate  family:  1)  an  individual  who  resides  in  the  same  household  as  the 
employee and is related by kinship, adoption, or marriage; (2) a foster child who resides in the 
same household as the employee; and 3) a minor child of the employee, whether or not living in 
the same household.

Work Hours 

A.  Standard Workweek - The standard workweek for full-time employees is 40 hours. The workweek is 

12:00 a.m. Saturday through 11:59 p.m. Friday.  
 

B.   Office Hours - The Clerk’s Office shall remain open to the public from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday 
through Friday.  The Clerk of the Court is responsible for establishing work schedules for the Clerk’s 
Office.  Each judge may establish regular work hours for his or her chambers consistent with state 
and federal law.  

 Flex Time - Non-exempt employees may make up (Flex) not more than two hours of leave within a 
week, and must make up that time within the same week.  All other time must be deducted from 
accrued employee leave.  

C. 

 

Other Activities Considered Work Time 
In addition to time spent performing regular job duties, the following activities are considered work time:  
 

A.  Travel Time - Travel time is considered hours worked when the employee is in transit on official travel 
status out of town to attend or return from work-related training, conferences, or meetings, except 
for bona fide meal periods, when sleeping, or when free to pursue personal activities. (Travel time 
between the employee’s home and regular duty station is not considered work time.)  

B.   Training Time - Participation in required training programs is considered hours worked. Voluntary 

training is considered hours worked only when the Court chooses to recognize such hours.  

 
Employee Meal Periods 

A.   Lunch - Employees are entitled to one hour for lunch.  In order to provide public access to the Court, 
the  Clerk  of  the  Court  is  responsible  for  establishing  lunch  schedules  for  the  Clerk’s  Office.  Each 
employee should take a minimum of one-half hour for lunch except in extraordinary circumstances.  

Leave Granted at the Discretion of Supervisors 
Before requesting leave, employees should ensure that they have adequate leave balances and that their 
absence will not interfere with the performance of their job duties. Leave approval is not automatic. While 
every attempt is made to accommodate employees’ timely leave requests, supervisors have the authority 
and responsibility to use their discretion to ensure that adequate staff remains on duty to perform the work 
of the Court. 

Excessive Absenteeism or Tardiness 
Absenteeism or tardiness is excessive when an employee is unable to adequately perform his/her job, or 
when the normal day-to-day work activities of the office are disrupted due to excessive and/or unscheduled 
absences or tardiness by the employee. Excessive absenteeism or tardiness may be grounds for disciplinary 
actions, up to and including termination. 

   

 

 

 

 

Adopted May 16, 2018 
Revised October 2019 
 

Unauthorized Absence 
An employee who fails to report to or remain at work, or who fails to return to work upon expiration of 
approved leave, may be considered to have abandoned his or her position with the Court. Such an employee 
will be expected to produce a satisfactory explanation for the unauthorized absence. An employee who is 
absent from work for three or more consecutive days without contacting his or her supervisor will be deemed 
to have abandoned his or her job at the close of the third day. Unauthorized absence(s) may be grounds for 
disciplinary actions, up to and including termination. 

Time Reporting and CAPPS  

A.  Entering  Leave  in  CAPPS  -  All  Court  employees  are  responsible  for  entering  time  in  CAPPS  and 
certifying their time in CAPPS.  All Court employees must receive prior approval from their supervisors 
for all leave, unless it is for sick leave.  For timekeeping purposes, all leave is to be rounded to quarter-
hour (15 minute) increments.   

B. CAPPS Certification Due - Employees should have all time entered and certified in CAPPS no later than 

the 3rd working day of the month.   

3 | P a g e  

A. FLSA Exempt & Non-exempt Employees - Overtime eligibility is governed under the provisions of the 
FLSA. Eligibility is not based on an employee’s classification title or pay group, but on the employee’s 
functional  job.  FLSA  exempt  employees  are  ineligible  to  earn  overtime  compensation.  FLSA  non-
exempt employees are eligible to earn overtime. The Human Resources Department is responsible for 
determining the FLSA designation for each employee.  

. Prior Approval to Earn Compensatory Time or Overtime - Generally overtime is not authorized. A 
non-exempt  employee’s  work  schedule  should  be  adjusted  to  ensure  that  the  employee  does  not 
exceed 40 hours. This is also referred to as flexing your time. For example, an employee who must 
work 2 extra hours on Tuesday could leave 2 hours early on Friday so as not to exceed 40 hours that 
week.  However,  a  non-exempt  employee  must  be  compensated  for  overtime  even  if  it  was  not 
approved in advance. An employee who works unauthorized overtime will be counseled or disciplined 
just as with any other violation of Court policy.   

If  overtime  is  required,  before  earning  compensatory  time  or  overtime,  employees  must  obtain 
approval from their supervisor.  

C. Earning Overtime - Non-exempt employees earn overtime for time worked in excess of 40 hours in a 
week. To earn overtime, the 40 hours must be time actually worked. Paid time off, such as holidays, 
vacation and sick leave, etc., do not count as time worked for calculating overtime. For example, a 
non-exempt employee who actually works 44 hours during one work week earns 4 hours of overtime.  

. Earning Compensatory Time - Non-exempt employees earn straight compensatory time when paid 
hours exceed 40 in a work week but the employee has actually worked less than 40 hours. Once the 
total of actual hours worked reaches 40, the employee begins earning overtime.

. Overtime Compensation - The Court compensates non-exempt employees for overtime by granting 
them paid time off at the rate of 1.5 hours for each overtime hour they earn. Paid time off for overtime 
should be used as the employee’s next scheduled leave. Exempt employees do not earn overtime.

Holidays 

A.   Types of Holidays – There are three types of holidays to which an employee is entitled: national, 
state, and optional. Eligible employees are entitled to a paid day off from work on national and state 
holidays as specified by the Legislature.  

B.   Eligibility – Employees are entitled to paid day off from work on a specified holiday if:  

• the holiday does not fall on a Saturday or Sunday; and  
• the employee is not on Leave Without Pay. 

C.   Skeleton Crew Days – The Court will have a sufficient number of employees on duty during a state 
holiday (skeleton crew day) to conduct the public business of the Court except for those state holidays 
which fall on a Saturday or Sunday, the Friday after Thanksgiving Day, and December 24th and 26th. 
Supervisors  may  use  their  discretion  in  determining  staffing  requirements  on  skeleton  crew  days. 
Employees who must work on a national or state holiday will accrue holiday compensatory time and 
will  be  allowed  time  off  during  the  12-month  period  following  the  date  of  the  holiday  worked. 
Employees who work on skeleton crew days must report the number of hours worked on the Court’s 
Leave Request Form to receive credit for this time.  

D.  Optional  Holidays  –  An  employee  is  entitled  to  paid  leave  to  observe  an  optional  holiday  (Cesar 
Chavez Day, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, or Good Friday) if he/she agrees to relinquish a state holiday 
(skeleton crew day) during that same fiscal year. If the employee fails to work a skeleton crew day in 
the same fiscal year, a day of vacation leave will be charged instead. If no vacation leave is available, 
he or she will lose one day of pay.  

E.   Holiday Before Work Begins or After Work Ends – An individual must be a state employee on the 
workday before and after a designated holiday in order to be paid for that holiday, unless the holiday 
falls on the first or last workday of the month.  

F.   Part-time Employees – Part-time employees are entitled to the same holidays with pay (on a prorated 

   

 

 

 

 

 

basis) as granted to full-time employees.

Annual Leave 
Employees must receive prior approval from their supervisor for annual leave.   

mployees begin to accrue annual leave from their first day of employment.    However, annual leave  may not be 
taken until an employee has been continuously employed with a state agency for six  months. 
 
Annual leave accrual rates are the same for both hourly and salaried employees.  Part-time employees  are also 
eligible for annual leave, but their accrual rate and maximum annual leave carryover amounts  are proportionate 
to the number of hours they work. For example, half-time employees earn and carry over annual leave at one-half 
the rate authorized for full-time employees. 
 
An  employee  accrues  annual  leave  and  may  carry  annual  leave  forward  from  one  fiscal  year  to  the  next  in 
accordance with the schedule detailed below. 

ll annual leave hours in excess of the maximum allowable carryover remaining at the end of a fiscal year shall be 
credited to the employee’s sick leave balance.  In computing annual leave taken by an employee, absences due to 
holidays are not charged.

Annual Leave and Employee Separations 

Employees  who  transfer  directly  from  one  state  agency  to  another  will  have  their  annual  leave  balances 
transferred.  If an employee separates from employment and is re-employed within 30 calendar days by  a 
state agency to a position that accrues annual leave, his or her annual leave balance will transfer to the  new 
agency. 

State agency employees are entitled to be paid for the accrued balance of their annual leave as of the date of 
separation, if they are not re-employed by the State in a position that accrues annual leave during the 30-day 
period immediately following the date of separation from state employment. 

Reference: Texas Government Code, Section 661.152. 

ick Leave 
An employee who must be absent from duty because of illness shall notify their supervisor of that fact at the 
earliest practicable time.   Upon return to duty after a three-day or more sick leave, the employee shall submit 
a  doctor’s  statement  to  their  supervisor  showing  the  cause  or  nature  of  the  condition  or  another  written 
statement of the facts concerning the condition that is acceptable to the employee’s supervisor.    

Thirteenth Court of Appeals employees shall earn sick leave subject to the following provisions: 

•  An employee accrues sick leave at a rate of eight hours per month (or proportionately for part- time 

employees). 

•  An employee accrues sick leave beginning on the first day of state employment and ending on  the 
last duty day of state employment.  Duty day means an employee’s last physical day on the  job. 
•  An employee who is on leave the first day of the month may not use that month’s accrual until  he or 

she returns to duty. 

•  An employee may use sick leave while he or she is on annual leave. 

Sick leave may be used when an employee is prevented from performing his or her job due to sickness,  injury, 
pregnancy,  or  confinement.    It  also may  be  used to  care  for  an  immediate  family  member  who  is  ill.  An 
employee who is the legal guardian of a child by court appointment may use sick leave to care for  the child. 
Sick leave also may be used for the adoption of a child under the age of three. 

he  Chief  Justice  may  authorize  exceptions  to  the  amount  of  sick  leave  an  employee  may  take.    Such 
exceptions are authorized on an individual basis after a review of the merits of the particular circumstances.

Sick Leave Pool 
The Thirteenth  Court  of  Appeals  has  adopted  a  Sick  Leave  Pool  Policy  that allows  employees to voluntarily 
transfer sick  leave to a sick leave pool.  Any employee may contribute sick leave to the pool, and contributions 
are strictly voluntary.  Contributions must be in increments of eight hours, with the exception of employees who 
are retiring, who may contribute any unused balance.  The sick leave pool is intended to assist  employees and 
their immediate families in dealing with catastrophic illnesses or injuries that force them  to exhaust all accrued 
leave. 
 
Rules  and  procedures  for  transferring  accrued  sick  leave  into  and  out  of  the  pool  are  handled  by  the  Pool 
Administrator.  Requests for sick leave pool leave should be made on the Sick Leave Pool Application/Donation 
Form.   

n employee may draw from the sick leave pool only with the approval of the Chief Justice.  An employee may 

not receive sick leave in excess of one-third of the  total time in the pool or 90 days, whichever is less.
