      <pre>Affidavit of Death Form
Instructions

Important Notice to Property Owner
Carefully read all instructions for this form. It is best to talk to a lawyer before using this form. For privacy reasons, you do not 
need to put your social security number or driver’s license number on this form. Do not file these instructions.

When to Use This Form

legal ownership of the property.

• When the property owner who created the transfer on death deed dies, this form is used by a named beneficiary to get

• Title to the property does not pass to the beneficiary(ies) until the affidavit of death is filed. Without legal title, you

cannot sell the property, or get property tax exemptions, or use the property as collateral on a loan.

Important Information

• Primary Beneficiary Takes Before Alternate Beneficiary: If any primary beneficiary is alive for more than 120 hours after
the property owner who created the transfer on death deed dies (now called the “Decedent”), no alternate beneficiary
will get the property. An alternate beneficiary can only get the property if all primary beneficiaries have died before the
decedent’s death or within 120 hours after the decedent’s death.

• Proof of Death: After the Affidavit of Death is filed, you will need to provide acceptable proof that the Decedent has died,
such as a death certificate or an obituary, to the title company before the property can be sold, used as collateral for a
loan, or otherwise encumbered.

Required

• Must Sign In Front of A Notary: Do not sign or date the Affidavit of Death until you are in front of a notary.

• Must Record Affidavit of Death for Property Title to Transfer to Beneficiary: You must record (file) this Affidavit of
Death with the county clerk where the property is located for title to the property to legally transfer to the named
beneficiary(ies) listed in the transfer on death deed.

Completing the Affidavit of Death Form
1.

Information of Person Signing Affidavit: Enter your first, middle (if any), and last name. You are the affiant (the person filling
out and signing the affidavit).

2. Legal Description of the Property: Enter the legal description of the property exactly as it appears on the original transfer on
death deed. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THIS INFORMATION IS CORRECT. If you are not absolutely sure, talk to a lawyer.

3. Transfer on Death Deed Filed by Decedent:

• Enter the name of the person who signed the transfer on death deed and has now died exactly as it appeared in the

transfer on death deed in the chart. This person is now called the “Decedent.”

1

Texas Transfer Toolkit  |  Affidavit of Death FormDo not file this page• Enter the date the transfer on death deed was filed, and the county the deed was filed in the appropriate blanks.

• Enter the volume and page number where the transfer on death deed was filed. This can be found on a file-stamped
copy of the transfer on death deed. Some counties have stopped using volume and page numbers. If the file-stamped
copy does not have a volume and page number, use the instrument or document number instead. If you don’t have a
stamped copy of the transfer on death deed, you can get a copy at the county clerk’s office in the county where it was
filed.

4.

Information of Person Who Signed the Transfer on Death Deed: Enter the date the Decedent died, and the city, county, and
state where they died in the chart.

5. Affiant’s Signature: This affidavit must be signed before a notary. Do not sign your name or enter the date until you are stand-

ing in front of a notary.

6. Acknowledgement: You do not need to fill out anything in this box. The notary will fill it out.

7.

“After Recording, Return to” Section: Fill in the name and address of the beneficiary, who is a new owner of the property now
that the Decedent has died, here. Once the affidavit is recorded, it will be returned to the beneficiary with a document num-
ber or a volume and page number so that it can be located later.

8. File the Affidavit of Death (NOT These Instructions) in the County Clerk’s Office:

• Bring Original and One Copy: Bring the original and at least one copy of the complete and notarized Affidavit of Death to

the County Clerk’s office in the county where the property is located.

• Bring Personal Identification: The county clerk may require you to show personal identification.

• Bring Money: The County Clerk will charge a fee to file the Affidavit of Death and may not accept a check. You may want

to call the County Clerk’s office and find out how much the charge will be before you go.

• Do Not File the Instructions: If you file the instructions, it may cause confusion and will also cost you more money.
