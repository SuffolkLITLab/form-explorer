Texas Transfer Toolkit Overview

The Texas Transfer Toolkit is a digital resource from the Texas Access to Justice Commission (TAJC) to help Texans with 
limited means transfer their home, car or money in a bank account to a beneficiary upon their death.

When someone dies without designating a beneficiary to receive these items, their loved ones must go to probate court and 
have a judge to decide who gets them – a process that can be costly, stressful and time-consuming. Although someone can 
designate who will get these items in a will, a will still must go through the probate process. Hiring a lawyer to navigate this 
process may be an unnecessary expense for those without complex estates. If an individual only wishes to transfer a home, car 
or money in a bank account, this Toolkit can avoid probate and save money.

What’s Included
The Toolkit contains several forms to be completed by an asset owner prior to death, as well as one form to be completed by the 
beneficiary after the owner’s death. The forms included in the Toolkit are:

•  Transfer on Death Deed and Affidavit of Death, which transfer title to a home

•  Beneficiary Designation for a Motor Vehicle and Application for Texas Title and/or Registration forms to transfer title of 

a vehicle

Instructions to complete or cancel the paperwork and how to obtain a Payable on Death account from their bank are also in-
cluded. Preparing these forms prior to a crisis can save time, money and stress for those who are grieving.

Why It’s Important
Although these forms previously existed, the new Toolkit gathers them in one centralized place, eliminating an obstacle that may 
have prevented individuals from taking these steps. By providing this resource for free, TAJC hopes to empower people to plan 
ahead and take care of their family.

Who Should Use It
This new resource is primarily for people with very limited assets and not for those with more complex estate issues. However, 
anyone can use the Toolkit forms to transfer their car, home or money in a bank account, even if they also need a will to trans-
fer additional assets, such as jewelry or stocks. Individuals with more assets should consult a lawyer to ensure their wishes are 
followed.

Where to Find It
In addition to providing the Toolkit online at texasatj.org/texas-transfer-toolkit, free legal aid clinics 
across the state will increase awareness about these forms.

Instructions

Important Notice to Property Owner
Carefully read all instructions for this form. It is best to talk to a lawyer before using this form.  For privacy and identity theft 
reasons, you should not put your social security number or driver’s license number on this form.

What Is a Transfer on Death Deed?
A transfer on death deed is a simple, inexpensive way to transfer real estate to someone else upon your death. It does not involve 
going through probate court, which can be a lengthy and costly process.  It works similarly to a life insurance policy or a payable 
on death account at a bank because the asset passes to your named beneficiary upon your death outside the probate system.  

When to Use a Transfer on Death Deed
You may want to use a transfer on death deed when you own real property, such as a house or land, and you want to give that 
property to someone else when you die.  

Things to Know About Using a Transfer on Death Deed 

•  A transfer on death deed does not affect any of your property rights during your lifetime.  It only takes effect after your 

death.  You can sell the property, use it as collateral on a loan, get property tax exemptions, and enjoy all the other prop-
erty rights you currently have.  

 ɐ

The named beneficiary has no legal right to the property until your death.  If you decide to sell the property, the 
named beneficiary cannot stop you from doing so.  The sale simply “voids” the transfer on death deed and it is as if 
the transfer on death deed never existed.

•  You can only give someone the portion of the property that you own.  For example, if you and your spouse own the 

property in equal shares and you file a transfer on death deed giving the property to someone, like a child or a friend, that 
person only gets your share of the property.  Your spouse still has their share.

•  A transfer on death deed trumps a will.  

 ɐ

 ɐ

If you have a will that gives the property to someone else, this transfer on death deed “trumps” the will.  The benefi-
ciary named in the transfer on death deed gets the property, not the person named in your will.  If you already have a 
will, it is best to talk to an attorney about the pros and cons of using a transfer on death deed.  

If you make a will at some point in the future that gives the property to a different person than the beneficiary listed 
in this transfer on death deed, that provision does not override the deed.  The beneficiary named in this transfer on 
death deed still gets the property.  If you change your mind about who you want to get the property, you need to 
complete the cancellation of transfer on death deed or file an updated transfer on death deed.

•  A transfer on death deed does not protect the property from creditor claims.  You may use a transfer on death deed even 

if there is a debt or lien, such as a mortgage, against the property.  However, upon your death, your beneficiary takes the 
property subject to all mortgages, liens and claims and will be responsible for paying those debts on the property.  Also, if 
the property owner dies and has other unpaid debts, the property could be tied up in probate court until those debts are 
resolved.

1

Texas Transfer Toolkit  |  Transfer on Death Deed•  The transfer on death deed beneficiary must survive you by at least 120 hours. If not, the property is treated as if the 

transfer on death deed did not exist.

•  A transfer on death deed cannot be created by a person acting under a property owner’s power of attorney, however, that 

person can cancel the transfer on death deed.  

Required

public.

•  Must Sign in Front of a Notary:  Do not sign or date the transfer on death deed until you are standing in front of a notary 

•  Must Record Transfer on Death Deed Before Your Death:  You must record (file) this deed before your death with the 

county clerk where the property is located or it will not be effective. 

1.  Property Owner (Transferor) Making this Deed:  Enter your first, middle (if any), and last name, along with your mailing 

address. Write your name exactly as it appears on the deed you received when you became an owner of the property.  If you 
now go by a different name, write your name as listed on the deed, followed by AKA (also known as) and your current name.  
If more than one person owns the property, each person must do this.

2.  Legal Description of the Property:  Enter the legal description of the property, which is different from the mailing or physical 
address of the property. This information is on the deed you received when you became an owner of the property and is also 
available at the county clerk’s office in the county where the property is located. Do NOT use the legal description listed on 
your property tax bill because it is usually incomplete. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS INFORMATION IS CORRECT.  
If you are not absolutely sure, talk to a lawyer.

3.  Address of the Property:  Enter the physical address of the property.

4.  Primary and Alternate Beneficiaries:  You must check the box for A, B, or C. Check ONLY ONE box and fill in the blanks in 

that section.

•  Fill out Selection A if you are married and you and your spouse own the property together.

•  Fill out Selection B if you are married and you own all or part of the property by yourself (your spouse doesn’t own any 

part of it) AND you want your spouse to get your share of the property.

•  Fill out Selection C if either you are not married OR if you are married and do not want your share of the property to go 

to your spouse.

Each selection (A, B, or C) has three parts:

1.  Primary Beneficiary: A “beneficiary” is the person who will own the property when you die. The primary beneficiary 
is the first person you want to own the property. You can, but are not required to, name more than one person as 
primary beneficiary.

2.  Alternate Beneficiary or Beneficiaries: The alternate beneficiary or beneficiaries are the people you want to own the 

property if the primary beneficiary or beneficiaries die before you do.

3.  Transfer on Death: This section tells how you want your property to pass if all your beneficiaries die before you.

 ɐ

For Selection A and B: 

• 

• 

Initial option (a) if you want the alternate beneficiary or beneficiaries’ living children, grandchildren, or 
great-grandchildren to get your share of the property if that beneficiary dies before you do.

Initial option (b) if you DO NOT want the alternate beneficiary or beneficiaries’ children, grandchildren, or 
great-grandchildren to get your share of the property if that beneficiary dies before you do.

 ɐ

For Selection C, section: 

A.  If at Least One Primary Beneficiary Survives Me: If you name more than one primary beneficiary, this 

section tells what you want to do with your share of the property if one or more primary beneficiaries die 
before you, but one or more are still living.

Initial option (a) if you want the deceased primary beneficiary or beneficiaries’ share to go to that
person’s living children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren.

Initial option (b) if you DO NOT want the deceased primary beneficiary or beneficiaries’ share to go to
that person’s children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren. This share will be split among the living
primary beneficiaries.

B.

If NO Primary Beneficiary Survives Me (dies after I do): If my primary beneficiary is my child (or other
descendant) or my brother or sister (or other descendant of either of my parents) AND all primary benefi-
ciaries die before I do, I grant and convey (give) my share to (choose by writing your initials in ONE blank
ONLY):

Initial option (a) if you want the deceased primary beneficiary or beneficiaries’ share to go to that
person’s living children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren.

Initial option (b) if you DO NOT want the deceased primary beneficiary or beneficiaries’ share to go to
that person’s children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren. The alternate beneficiary or beneficiaries
will get the share.

C. If an Alternative Beneficiary Does Not Survive Me: If all your primary beneficiaries and one or more alter-
nate beneficiaries die before you do, this section tells what you want to do with your share of the property.

Initial option (a) if you want the deceased alternate beneficiary or beneficiaries’ shares to go to that
person’s children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren.

Initial option (b) if you DO NOT want the deceased alternate beneficiary or beneficiaries’ shares to go
to that person’s children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren. This transfer on death deed will be
canceled if no primary or alternate beneficiaries are alive when you die.

If you do not initial any section, it will be assumed you chose option (a).

5. Signature of Property Owner:  This deed must be signed before a notary.  Do not sign your name or enter the date until you

are in front of a notary. If two people own the property, both need to sign before a notary.

6. Acknowledgement: You do not need to fill out anything in this box. The notary will fill it out.

7.

“After Recording, Return to” Section:  Fill in the property owner’s name and address here.  Once the transfer on death deed
has been recorded, it will be returned to the property owner with the specific information (the volume, page number, and/
or deed number) on where the deed has been recorded in the county clerk’s office so that it can be located later. Keep the
transfer on death deed in a safe place.

8. File the Deed (NOT These Instructions) in the County Clerk’s Office:

•

•

•

Bring Original and One Copy:  Bring the original and at least one copy of the complete and notarized transfer on death
deed to the County Clerk’s office in the county where the property is located.

Bring Personal Identification:  The county clerk may require you to show personal identification before you file this
document.

Bring Money:  The County Clerk will charge a fee to file the transfer on death deed, which is typically a per page fee.
Many County Clerks do not accept checks.  You may want to call the County Clerk’s office and find out how much the
charge will be and whether they accept checks before you go.  Then file the original and ask them to return a copy of the
original with the recording information on it to the owner.

• Do Not File the Instructions: If you file the instructions, it may cause confusion and will also cost you more money.

been executed.

Transfer on Death Deed Cancellation
Instructions

Important Notice to Property Owner
Carefully read all instructions for this form. It is best to talk to a lawyer before using this form. For privacy reasons, do not put 
your social security number or driver’s license number on this form. Do not file these instructions.

When to Use this Form

If you change your mind and decide you do not want the primary or alternate beneficiaries listed in your transfer on
death deed to own the property upon your death, use this form to cancel the transfer on death deed. See the general
instructions to the transfer on death deed for information on cancelling a transfer on death deed by filing a new trans-
fer on death deed or after a divorce.

Tearing up or destroying your copy or the beneficiary’s copy of the transfer on death deed will not cancel the deed. A
cancellation must be filed with the county clerk where the property is located before your death.

Important Information

The cancellation applies ONLY to the portion of the property you own. For example: Joe and Sue own property to-
gether. They both sign and file a transfer on death deed naming Ann as the beneficiary. Sue changes her mind and files
a cancellation of transfer on death deed but Joe doesn’t. When Joe dies, Ann will get his share of the property but not
Sue’s share.

If more than one owner wants to cancel the transfer on death deed, it is best if each owner completes a separate can-
cellation of transfer on death deed.

Cancellation of a transfer on death deed is sometimes called a “revocation” of a transfer on death deed.

Motor Vehicle Beneficiary Designation and 
Application for Texas Title and/or Registration
Instructions

What Happens to My Car After I Die?
Most people think that they can simply give the car keys to the person they want to have the car when they die. Unfortunately, it 
isn’t that easy. The car title must be legally transferred to show that person now owns the car. 

Until recently, the only way to legally transfer title to a car after the owner died was to go through probate court, which often 
costs more than the car is worth. 

Now, car owners can complete the two Texas Department of Motor Vehicles forms in this kit before they die to choose who they 
want the car to go to. 

How Do I Legally Transfer My Car to Someone After I Die?  It’s a Three-Step Process: 
1. Complete the Beneficiary Designation for a Motor Vehicle form in this kit (Form VTR-121, Texas Department of Motor

Vehicles).  This form tells the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles who you want to give your car to upon your death (also
called ‘the beneficiary”).

2. Complete the Application for Texas Title and/or Registration form in this kit (Form 130-U, Texas Department of Motor

Vehicles).  This form tells the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles to add the beneficiary’s name to the car title.

3. Bring both completed forms, proof of your ownership of the car (your car title or other proof), and the $28 or $33 title

application fee to your county’s tax assessor-collector’s office.

Beneficiary Designation of a Motor Vehicle Form
1. What information will I need to fill it out?

•

•

•

•

•

The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), which is usually listed on the proof of car insurance, or etched on the window
of the car.

The full legal name of the person you want the car to go to.

Some form of ID that has been issued by the government, such as a driver’s license, ID card, or passport.

2. How do I fill it out? For help completing the form, contact your local county tax assessor-collector.  It is probably best to go to

their office and ask for help.

In the Certification section, choose the box that meets your needs:

If you’ve never before named a beneficiary to this vehicle, check the first box that says you are “designating” the
beneficiary.

If you’ve already named a beneficiary but have changed your mind and want someone else to get it, check the second
box that says you are “changing” the beneficiary designation.

1

Texas Transfer Toolkit  |  Motor Vehicle Beneficiary Designation• 

If you’ve already named a beneficiary and now don’t want that person or anyone else to get it, check the third box that 
says you are “revoking” the beneficiary designation.

Application for Texas Title and/or Registration Form
1.  How do I fill out the Application for Texas Title and/or Registration form?  For help completing the form, contact your 
local county tax assessor-collector.  It is probably best to go to their office and ask for help. If you do, make sure to have 
the information needed to complete the form with you, like the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), your driver’s license 
number or ID.  

General instructions:

In the “Applying for” section, check the “Title Only” box.

• 

• 

• 

In the “For a corrected title or registration, check reason” section, check “Other” and write “Beneficiary Designation” 
in the blank.

It is unlikely that you will need to complete anything after number 28. Contact your local county tax assessor-collector 
for additional information.

2.  What happens after I submit both forms and the application fee to my local tax assessor-collector? They will send you a 

new car title with the beneficiary’s name on it. The beneficiary’s name will also be listed in the Texas Department of Motor 
Vehicle’s database, which is important since the beneficiary does not need to have a physical copy of the title with his/her 
name on it to have the title transferred into his/her name after your death.

Beneficiary Designation for a Motor Vehicle 
 

 

Information 
 
An owner or joint owners  may designate a beneficiary to whom interest in the  motor vehicle  transfers upon the death  
of the owner or last surviving owner.  A designated beneficiary has no interest in  a motor vehicle until the owner’s (or 
last  surviving owner’s) death.   Note: A beneficiary does not have to  consent to this designation for it to be valid.  

he beneficiary designation can only be applied  when  all the recorded  owners are individuals.  If any recorded owner 
is an entity (such as a business  or trust),  the beneficiary designation cannot be applied to  the  motor vehicle  record.  

n order for a beneficiary to be  designated, changed  or revoked, this form  must be submitted  with an  Application for  
Texas Title and/or Registration  (Form 130-U),  the  $28  or $33 title application fee, and valid  ownership evidence to a 
county tax assessor-collector’s office before the owner’s  death.   This form  must contain  original signatures  of all 
owners.  

ultiple Owners 
 

In order  for  joint owners  of a motor  vehicle  to designate a beneficiary, the joint owners  must have entered into a  
Rights of  Survivorship Agreement  (refer  to the Rights  of Survivorship Agreement  for a Motor Vehicle  (Form VTR-122)  
for more  information).  Joint owners  will not be able to designate a beneficiary unless they have recorded  (or are also  
recording)  the Rights of Survivorship Agreement  with the department.  The  Rights of Survivorship  must be  indicated  
on the Texas title record in  order to  apply the beneficiary  designation.   The beneficiary  will only have claim  to the  
motor vehicle after  the death of  the last surviving  owner.  

hether  adding, changing,  or revoking  a beneficiary designation,  each  owner is required to sign the same form.  

evoking/Changing  Beneficiary Designation  

This designation may be  changed  or revoked  at any time without  the consent of  the designated beneficiary.  To  revoke 
or change  a beneficiary,  this form  must be completed.   This completed form  must be  submitted with  an  Application for  
Texas Title and/or Registration  (Form 130-U), the $28 or $33  title  application  fee,  and  the current  Texas title.  

pon Owner’s Death 
 

Upon the owner’s (or last  surviving  owner’s) death, the beneficiary  may transfer the  motor vehicle into their name if 
they survive the  owner (or  last surviving owner) by  120 hours and the  title application is  submitted not later than the  
180th day after the owner’s (or last  surviving owner’s) death.  Alternatively, the beneficiary may disclaim (decline)  
interest i  n  the motor vehicle.   A beneficiary must  obtain a title in their name prior to  any subsequent transfer by the  
beneficiary.  If the beneficiary has  not submitted an application by the  180th day  or the beneficiary  has disclaimed  
interest, the motor vehicle  may be transferred through heirship or must be probated.  A beneficiary that claims a  
motor vehicle subject to a lien (or other interest) is subject to  those liens  (or other interests).  A release of lien from  
the lienholder on record is  required if the  current  record reflects a lien  unless the lien  carries  forward.  

o claim the  vehicle, the beneficiary  must submit an  Application for Texas Title  and/or Registration  (Form 130-U),  the 
$28  or $33 title application fee,  the  Texas title in the deceased owner’s name  listing the beneficiary, and  a death  
certificate.   A release  of lien from the lienholder on record is required if the current record reflects a lien unless the

Payable on Death Bank Accounts
Instructions

Why Do I Need a Payable on Death Bank Account?
If you don’t have a payable on death bank account, no one can access the money in your bank account when you die to pay your 
bills, funeral costs, or other necessities. Any money in your account becomes part of your estate and a probate court judge will 
decide who can access the money. Going to probate court can take a lot of time and can be expensive for your family and friends 
who will be paying the cost of going to probate court (court costs, a lawyer, etc.).

If you have a payable on death bank account, all the money in your account will go directly to the people you choose to get it – 
without the expense and inconvenience to your family and friends of going through probate court.

How Do I Get a Payable on Death Bank Account?
1.  Decide who you want to get the money or other asset in any checking account, savings account, certificates of deposit, safe 

deposit box, or other bank account. You can name more than one person, if you’d like. 

2.  Go to your bank and tell them that you want to make your bank account payable on death.

3.  Your bank will ask you to name a beneficiary or beneficiaries (the person or people you want the money to go to) and to sign 

your name to confirm that this is what you want to do.

Texas Transfer Toolkit  |  Payable on Death Bank AccountsInstructions for Beneficiaries
After Filing Toolkit Forms, Give This to Your Loved Ones

This paper tells your loved ones who will get your home, car, or bank account(s) after your death. It’s also a good idea to give 
each beneficiary (the person who is getting the home, car or money from the bank account) a copy of the forms that have been 
filed along with any other information they need to know to complete the transactions after your death (example: the affidavit 
of death form needed to transfer title to your home, the vehicle identification number/VIN for your car, the name of your bank 
and the branch location where the form was filed, account numbers, etc.).

For My Beneficiaries
I have filed the following forms to make sure that these 
assets transfer to my beneficiaries after my death.

Loved One

Check all that apply.

If you are the beneficiary on a Transfer on Death Deed (for a home):
To claim the home or property, you must fill out an Affidavit of Death, 
sign and date the Affidavit of Death in front of a notary and submit 
it to the county clerk where the property is located. If the property 
is not fully paid for, you will be responsible for making the mortgage 
payment and any other expenses associated with the property. The 
Affidavit of Death form can be found here: texasatj.org/texas-transfer-
toolkit.

If you are the beneficiary of a car or other motor vehicle:
To claim title to the car or vehicle, you must get the title changed to 
your name within 180 days after the owner’s death. You can do this 
by submitting an Application for Texas Title and/or Registration, the 
title application fee and the Texas title in the deceased owner’s name, 
listing you as beneficiary, to the county clerk where the property is 
located. It is best to go there in person. If the car is not fully paid for, 
you will be responsible for making the car payments or the lender can 
repossess the car. The Application for Texas Title and/or Registration 
can be found here: texasatj.org/texas-transfer-toolkit.

How to file to receive funds from a Payable on Death Account (for a bank account):
Upon the owner’s death, the money in their bank account will go di-
rectly to you. Visit the bank where the form was filed to make arrange-
ments for the transfer. Different banks may have different require-
ments for identification, etc., so it’s best to call before you go to be 
sure you have the right documentation. If you do not live in the same 
city or town of the bank where the form was filed, call the bank and 
ask them what to do. They should have the account listed as a payable 
on death account in their system.
