      <pre>Jury Trials During the 
COVID-19 Pandemic  
OBSERVATIONS AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS

Administrative Director
Office of Court Administration 
August 28, 2020

Executive Summary

Texas’ constitutional bill of rights provides that “the right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate.”1 Ensuring 
that the right to a jury trial is available in all cases has been strained during the past six months, as the 
ability to gather prospective jurors and others together during the pandemic has been limited. Prior to the 
pandemic, Texas courts averaged 186 jury trials per week. However, since mid-March, jury trials have been 
suspended except for in limited cases assisted by the Office of Court Administration (OCA) through October 
1. Pursuant to the Supreme Court’s Emergency Orders Regarding the COVID-19 State of Disaster, OCA has 
reviewed 85 requests to hold jury trials from June to September, and twenty of those trials have occurred. 
Based upon the planning, observations, and lessons learned from those trials as noted below, OCA submits 
to the Supreme Court the following recommendations regarding jury proceedings: 

1. 

In-person jury proceedings should be limited to district and county courts, including statutory county 
courts and statutory probate courts, between October 1 and December 31. 

2.  All courts should be permitted to conduct virtual jury proceedings, which are allowable under the 

current emergency order. However, in jailable criminal jury trials, virtual jury proceedings should only 
occur with appropriate waivers and consent of the defendant and prosecutor made on the record. In 
all other virtual jury trial proceedings, consent should not be required.  

3.  The local administrative district judge for each county and the presiding judge of a municipal court 

should be required, after conferring with all judges in the county (local administrative district judges) 
or city (presiding judges of municipal courts) to submit a plan for conducting jury trials consistent with 
guidelines for conducting jury trial proceedings issued by OCA. Included in those guidelines should be: 

 a.  Procedures for the summoning of jurors 

b.  Guidance on appropriate locations for jury proceedings 

c.  Requirements for screening requirements 

d.  Requirements for face coverings 

e.  Social distancing protocols 

f. 

Alternate Jurors 

g.  Arrangement of Courtroom 

h.  Microphone protection protocols

Vulnerable witnesses 

Food precautions

4.  To assist with coordination of local resources and to manage capacity issues, each judge wishing to 
conduct a jury proceeding, including a statutory probate judge, should be required to gain approval 
for that trial by the local administrative district judge and regional presiding judge. 

5.  The local administrative district judge overseeing the conduct of an in-person jury proceeding 

should be required to consult with the local health authority not more than 5 days prior to the jury 
proceeding to verify that local health conditions and plan precautions are appropriate for the trial to 
proceed.  

6. 

In all jury trial proceedings, courts should be required to consider motions or objections related 
to proceeding with the trial, if any, on the record at least seven days prior to the trial. If motions or 
objections related to proceeding with the trial are made less than seven days prior to the trial, courts 
should be required to consider those motions on the record as soon as practicable. 

7.  Courts should establish communication protocols to ensure that no court participants have tested 
positive for COVID-19 within the last 30 days, have symptoms of COVID-19, or have been recently 
exposed to COVID-19. 

8.  Courts wishing to conduct virtual jury trials should be required to ensure that all prospective jurors 

have access to technology with which to participate. 

9.  OCA should be required to issue detailed guidance to assist courts wishing to conduct virtual jury trials 

and assist those courts in conducting the trials to the greatest degree possible.  

10. The regional presiding judges should be required to ensure that all courts, including the statutory 
probate courts, in each region are operating in full compliance with the Court’s Orders and the 
Guidance issued by OCA related to jury trial proceedings, report to the office of the Chief Justice of 
the Supreme Court any jury trial proceedings that are being conducted in the regions—and the court 
in which the proceedings are being conducted—that are inconsistent with the Court’s Orders and the 
Guidance issued by OCA, and assist each region’s local governments and courts to ensure that courts 
have the ability to conduct jury proceedings. 

11. OCA should coordinate with the regional presiding judges to monitor the jury trial proceedings in the 
state and the Department of State Health Services regarding the public health situation in the state 
and regions of the state and should make additional recommendations to the Supreme Court as 
necessary to ensure the health of all participants involved with and observers of jury proceedings.

Timeline of Texas Judiciary Response 
to Pandemic

As many Texans were celebrating the dawn of a new decade on 
December 31, 2019, the original cluster of cases of the COVID-19 disease 
(“COVID-19”) was identified in China. Less than three weeks later, the 
first diagnosed case of COVID-19 was identified in the United States. 
While Texas would not see its first diagnosed case of COVID-19 until 
March 4, the Texas judiciary began its involvement with the state’s 
COVID-19 response by participating in a preparedness briefing to 
Governor Greg Abbott on February 27. Based upon the information 
gathered at that briefing, the Texas judiciary activated its response plan 
and actions occurred as noted in the margins.

Week 1

March 5 (1 COVID case in the 
state) – the Office of Court 
Administration (OCA) issues 
the first COVID-19 guidance 
to courts recommending that 
courts prepare to respond to 
COVID-19 cases in the state, 
including determining authority 
for decisions, determining 
essential functions and essential 
staff, preparing for teleworking 
and remote court proceedings, 
and readying communication 
strategies. 

March 6 – Chief Justice Nathan L. 
Hecht assigns 31 district judges 
to hear emergency requests for 
quarantine orders under Chapter 
81 of the Texas Health and Safety 
Code.

Remote Hearings

After the Supreme Court’s First Emergency Order was issued, OCA 
explored various technology platforms to enable judges to conduct 
proceedings remotely with all participants. Key to this decision was 
the user-friendliness of the platform, features to promote participation 
by all participants, and security. After evaluating several platforms, 
OCA determined that Zoom would be the best platform for the Texas 
judiciary. To test this determination, OCA requested twenty judges test 
the platform with remote hearings during the week of March 16-20. 
Almost 100 proceedings were conducted during that week, with judges 
providing very positive feedback about the platform’s utility for remote 
hearings. With this feedback, OCA procured enough licenses for every 
judge in Texas to have a license so that the full features and security of 
the Zoom platform would be available to those judges. Texas judges 
quickly embraced the technology as shown in the graphs below, with 
an estimated 440,000 remote hearings in every case type and type of 
proceeding, including bench and jury trials, with 1.3 million participants 
lasting almost 1 million hours held in the 6-month period. 

Week 2

March 12 (25 COVID cases in 
the state) – OCA issues the 
second Guidance on Court 
Procedures during the pandemic, 
recommending that courts delay 
or conduct remotely all non-
essential court proceedings until 
at least April 1. OCA recommends 
that courts suspend all jury trials 
and large docket calls until at 
least April 1.

March 13 – Approximately four 
hours after Governor Abbott 
issued a disaster declaration 
and public health emergency 
declaration for the state, the 
Supreme Court, joined by the 
Court of Criminal Appeals, uses 
its emergency powers under 
Section 22.0035(b), Texas 
Government Code, to issue the 
First Emergency Order Regarding 
the COVID-19 State of Disaster. 
The order permitted all courts in 
all cases, without a participant’s 
consent, to modify or suspend 
deadlines, allow or require remote 
participation by anyone involved 
in a hearing or proceeding (except 
jurors), conduct proceedings 
away from the court’s usual 
location, and permitted courts to 
extend the statute of limitations.

March 13 – Chief Justice Nathan 
L. Hecht assigns 21 justices of 
the courts of appeals to hear 
appellate proceedings in cases 
filed under Chapter 81 of the 
Texas Health and Safety Code 
(quarantine). 

Week 3

March 17 – 9:13 am – District 
Judge Emily Miskel holds the first 
fully remote hearing in the state in 
a family law temporary restraining 
order proceeding, a hearing that 
lasts just over one hour with 7 
participants. The proceeding is 
streamed live on Judge Miskel’s 
court YouTube channel. 

5

Week 3

March 17 – The Supreme Court 
issues the Second Emergency 
Order to clarify child possession 
schedules.

March 19 – OCA procures 3,100 
Zoom licenses to permit all 
courts in Texas to conduct remote 
proceedings. 

March 19 – The Supreme Court 
issues the Third Emergency Order 
that amends and clarifies the 
First Emergency Order. The order 
prohibits courts from conducting 
non-essential proceedings in 
person contrary to local, state, 
or national directives regarding 
maximum group size.

March 19 – The Supreme Court 
issues the Fourth Emergency 
Order that suspends trials, 
hearings, and other proceedings 
in most eviction cases until April 
19.

March 19 (143 COVID cases in 
the state) – OCA issues its third 
Guidance on Court Procedures to 
courts, recommending that courts 
delay non-essential proceedings 
to at least May 1, including jury 
trials. OCA invites all judges to 
sign up for Zoom licenses at no 
cost to the court and schedules 
training webinar for March 23.

March 20 – The Supreme Court 
issues the Fifth Emergency Order 
that tolls deadlines in attorney 
disciplinary and disability 
proceedings.

Week 4

March 22 – The Supreme Court 
issues the Sixth Emergency Order 
to permit online voting in the 
2020 State Bar elections.

Limited Jury Trial Approval Process

In its Seventeenth Emergency Order Regarding the COVID-19 State of 
Disaster issued on May 27, the Supreme Court prohibited courts from 
holding jury proceedings, including jury selection or a jury trial, prior 
to August 1. In addition, the Court required OCA to coordinate with the 
Regional Presiding Judges and local administrative judges to assist trial 
courts in conducting a limited number of jury proceedings. In the May 
27 order, the Court required consent from all parties to proceed with 
the limit jury trials, but the consent requirement was removed in the 
Eighteenth Emergency Order on June 29. The Court required OCA to 
submit a report to the Court outlining its observations regarding those 
jury proceedings and making recommendations regarding procedures 
for jury proceedings. In subsequent emergency orders, the Court further 
delayed jury proceedings until October 1. 

Prior to reviewing any jury proceeding requests, OCA consulted with 
infectious disease experts at the Texas Department of State Health 
Services (DSHS). Those meetings resulted in several best practices and 
answered questions that greatly assisted OCA in its efforts. DSHS staff 
have remained available to OCA staff throughout the spring and summer 
to assist with providing advice on matters affecting public health. This 
includes reviewing the local COVID case data in each county several days 
before the trial is scheduled to begin and relaying any concerns about 
moving forward. 

In order to assist trial courts in conducting a limited number of jury 
proceedings, OCA requested that courts interested in conducting 
either in-person or remote jury proceedings coordinate with their 
local administrative judges and regional presiding judges and to make 
a request to proceed to OCA. OCA would then schedule a remote 
webconference meeting to discuss the judge’s plan for the jury 
proceeding. At those meetings, the various aspects of the trial were 
reviewed and feedback was provided. When issues arose about certain 
protocols of the trial that might affect public health, OCA consulted with 
infectious disease experts at DSHS. 

Since the Supreme Court’s Seventeenth Order was issued, OCA has 
reviewed 85 requests to conduct a jury trial. Of those requests, OCA 
approved 84 requests, and one request was withdrawn. 

Week 4

March 23 – Chief Justice Nathan L. 
Hecht assigned additional duties 
to the Regional Presiding Judges 
to ensure that all courts in their 
regions comply with executive 
directives and the Courts’ orders, 
including not conducting in-
person proceedings inconsistent 
with the Courts’ orders or OCA 
Guidance. 

March 23 – OCA conducts webinar 
to train judges on the use of 
Zoom for remote proceedings. 
This marks the official start of the 
use of Zoom in Texas for remote 
proceedings. 

March 24 – The Supreme Court 
issues the Seventh Emergency 
Order to clarify child possession 
schedules during the pandemic in 
light of shelter-in-place orders.

March 25 – District Judge Emily 
Miskel conducts the first fully 
virtual contested bench trial using 
Zoom. 

March 26 (1,396 COVID cases in 
the state) – OCA issues its fourth 
Guidance on Court Procedures to 
courts, recommending that courts 
delay all in-person proceedings to 
at least May 8, holding essential 
proceedings only if holding 
the proceeding remotely is not 
possible or feasible and only 
if 10 or less people are in the 
courtroom or in areas around the 
courtroom, and that no non-
essential proceedings should be 
held in-person. 

Week 5

March 31 – Governor Abbott 
issues statewide stay-at-home 
order from April 2 to April 30.

April 1 – The Supreme Court 
issues the Eighth Emergency 
Order amending the tolling of the 
statute of limitations in civil cases. 

7

April 2 (4,669 COVID cases in

to suspend certain debt collection 
proceedings under April 30.

April 9 – The Supreme Court 
issues the Eleventh Emergency 
Order to extend deadlines in 
disciplinary proceedings before 
the Judicial Branch Certification 
Commission. 

April 9 (10,230 COVID cases in 
the state) – OCA issues its sixth 
Guidance on Court Procedures to 
courts, providing updates on the 
situation but leaving the guidance 
from March 26 unchanged.

Week 7

the state) – OCA issues its seventh 
Guidance on Court Procedures 
to courts, recommending that 
in-person proceedings be

Grand Jury Proceedings

Grand juries are generally empaneled to serve for a single term of court, 
which for most counties is January to June and July to December. 
While courts are permitted during a disaster to extend the term of a 
grand jury to a timeframe set by the regional presiding judge2 or to 
reassemble discharged grand juries,3  some courts wished to empanel 
new grand juries. Empaneling grand juries is less complicated than a 
petit jury proceeding since fewer jurors are required to be summoned 
and less time is required to pick the grand jurors. Therefore, OCA issued 
a grand jury empanelment template procedure and advised judges 
that they could proceed without further approval if they followed the 
empanelment template procedure. OCA required that judges who 
used the procedure submit a report of the grand jury empanelment 
proceeding. To date, 40 grand juries have been empaneled using the 
template procedure. No grand juries have been empaneled using any 
other procedure.

Observations from Limited Jury Trials

Plans

OCA commends the trial court judges, local administrative judges, and regional presiding judges for the 
diligent efforts they made in proposing protocols to conduct in-person and virtual jury trials. Conducting 
both in-person and virtual jury trials during the pandemic requires extensive planning and preparation. 
All of the judges who proposed jury trials had prepared detailed plans for the jury trial, which will be 
necessary for all jury trials going forward. 

Cases Needing Jury Trials

During the last fiscal year, Texas courts tried an average of 186 jury trials per week, as shown below. Jury 
trials represented 0.11% of all dispositions, meaning that 99.89% of all cases were disposed in a method 
other than jury trial.

Jury Trials by Case Type – Fiscal Year 2019

As the table shows, the primary use of jury trials is in criminal cases involving jailable offenses (42%). 
Last fiscal year, an average of 78 jury trials were conducted each week in these cases, meaning that Texas 
courts would typically have tried almost 1,900 jailable criminal cases since the jury trial suspension in 
March. Because of the inability to conduct widespread jury trials since March, a significant population 
of criminal defendants are awaiting trial, many of whom are still in jail. OCA saw the primary source of 
requests for jury trials coming from these cases, and OCA expects there to be a significant backlog of 
criminal jury trials in jailable criminal cases.

Motions/Objections to Proceeding

When OCA first began working on requests to conduct limited jury trials, the Court’s order required 
consent to proceed. Very few judges were able to obtain consent to proceed (only 3 jury trials were 

13

proposed during that time). However, OCA discussed with each judge the need to consider any 
objections or motions relating to proceeding with the jury trial. In each case, judges committed to 
hearing motions or objections to proceeding at a scheduled hearing, on the record, and in sufficient time 
before the trial to permit counsel to pursue appellate options if desired. In at least three cases, counsel 
filed petitions for writs of mandamus in the appellate courts.4  

Summoning Jurors

Almost all of the courts who proceeded with jury trials included with their summons a letter from 
the judge describing the precautionary measures the court had taken to protect the health of the 
prospective jurors. This was done to improve the appearance rates. Most courts saw about a 5-10% drop 
in the normal appearance rate prior to the pandemic. 

In addition to the letter from the judge, courts included with their summons a “COVID questionnaire.” 
The questionnaire solicited from the jurors information about their symptoms, exposure to COVID, and 
vulnerability to COVID and suggested that those jurors responding affirmatively to those questions 
contact the court for rescheduling or excusal from jury duty. On average, about 10% of the summoned 
jurors requested a COVID-related excuse or to be rescheduled. Judges were liberal in granting excuses or 
rescheduling jurors for these reasons. 

Locations for Jury Proceedings

Due to space limitations, most courts were unable to conduct the qualification and voir dire process in 
courthouse facilities and instead needed to obtain auxiliary space in other buildings in the county. The 
most common spaces that were used were gymnasiums, theaters, and ballrooms. Issues with acoustics, 
lighting, security, and availability were the most common impediments in these facilities. Most judges 
were able to move to a courtroom once a jury was selected.

None of the courts have been able to use existing jury deliberation rooms, as the size of the rooms do 
not permit adequate social distancing. Rather, almost all courts have utilized nearby courtrooms or the 
courtroom in which the case is being tried as the jury deliberation room. 

Screening

Face Coverings

All courts conducting in-person jury trials established screening protocols that involved temperature 
checks and questions about potential symptoms or exposure. Prospective jurors who exhibited or 
reported symptoms or exposure were excused. All other observers and participants in the trial were 
subject to the same screening. Courts using auxiliary facilities also established security screening 
protocols at those facilities. 

All courts conducting in-person jury trials encouraged or required facial coverings. Trials in June 
occurred prior to Governor Abbott’s executive order requiring facial coverings. All trials since the 
executive order have required facial coverings. Courts reported some issues with obtaining compliance 

4.   See In re Kinder Morgan Production Company, LLC (11-20-00190-CV, 11th Court of Appeals; 20-0634, Supreme Court of Texas); In re Meg Brewer 

(09-20-00193-CV, 9th Court of Appeals); In re Ryan Carter Lemon (10-20-00231-CR).

14

with the facial covering requirement, and counsel in jury cases reported concerns with facial coverings 
worn by witnesses or prospective jurors who were speaking during voir dire. To accommodate those 
concerns and protect public health, OCA consulted with the Department of State Health Services to 
obtain an alternative that has been used in subsequent trials. The alternate involves the use of both 
facial coverings and face shields. When a witness or prospective juror is speaking and immobile, a face 
shield has been donned and the facial covering lowered while the individual is speaking. As soon as the 
individual has finished speaking and before the person becomes mobile, the individual raises the facial 
covering. Face shields have been provided by the courts and have not been collected from participants at 
the end of the proceeding. 

Social Distancing

Breaks

Alternates

All courts conducting in-person jury trials have arranged facilities and courtrooms in such a way to 
permit at least six feet of distancing between all participants and observers. Some criminal defense 
counsel and their clients have maintained less than six feet of distance for consultation purposes. 

While courts were able to maintain social distancing at most times, a particular concern was raised with 
individuals failing to socially distance at breaks, particularly when exiting the courtroom or facility being 
used. Therefore, OCA recommended that bailiffs dismiss persons “funeral-style” with single rows starting 
at the back exiting first. Courts reported that this method seemed to resolve the issue. 

All courts chose alternate jurors for the proceedings. This step was taken to ensure that the jury size 
could be maintained if non-COVID-related issues with a juror arose.5

Arrangement of the Courtroom

Most of the courts conducting in-person jury trials have inadequate space in their jury boxes to ensure 
adequate social distancing. In these situations, the courts have used the gallery of the courtroom or a 
combination of the jury box/gallery to seat the jury. This has required some other rearrangement of the 
courtroom to include turning counsel tables to face the jury, moving the witnesses closer to the jury 
(often in the jury box), and providing televisions closer to the jury for viewing digital evidence that is 
being displayed.

Some courts with larger jury boxes have been able to place the jury in the normal jury box with the 
addition of plexiglass and some other alterations in the seating arrangement. 

Public Access to Trials

Since most courts have placed jurors in the gallery and with limited gallery capacity to ensure social 
distancing, seating for the public has been limited. Most courts have been able to provide some seating 
for the public in the courtroom, but some courts have had to broadcast the proceeding to another 

5.  Courts knew that a COVID-related exposure would likely mean that the jury trial would be unable to continue.

15

courtroom for the public to observe. In this situation, up to 3 courtrooms may be required for the jury 
proceeding (1 for the trial, 1 for the jury deliberation room, and 1 for the public viewing area). 

When the public is placed in the gallery of the courtroom and the jury is also in the gallery, courts have 
taken special steps to ensure separation of the jury from the public.

Most courtrooms used microphones for witnesses and other participants. Some courts that used 
auxiliary spaces with acoustics concerns also required microphones. Due to the design of microphones 
(with holes) and the method of transmission of COVID, OCA sought advice from the Department of State 
Health Services on how to reduce transmission from the microphone. Courts were advised to utilize 
disposable microphone covers designed to keep the microphones clean and to change the covers 
between users of the microphone. 

With the use of face coverings and face shields, most courts were able to accomplish side bar 
conversations by moving to a larger area of the courtroom and maintaining social distancing. However, 
some courts purchased headsets with earphones and microphones that could be worn by all participants 
in a sidebar conversation so that the conversation could occur without the need for participants to move.

Microphones

Sidebars

Exhibits/Evidence

All courts encouraged the use of digital exhibits/evidence where feasible to reduce the exchange of paper 
or physical exhibits/evidence in the courtroom. When physical or paper exhibits/evidence were used, 
courts used gloves to handle the exhibit/evidence. Because of the potential for cross-contamination and 
transmission, gloves were used and then immediately discarded rather than being continuously worn. 
Since most courts were using courtrooms or other large rooms for jury deliberation, most courts placed 
the exhibits/evidence on a table in the deliberation room for the jury’s review. Rather than having the 
jury pass the exhibits/evidence, jurors were encouraged to move to review the exhibits/evidence on the 
tables.

Food

Cleaning

16

Many courts feed their jurors during deliberation, and some do so during the trial portion as well. Courts 
who do feed their jurors made special effort to ensure that jurors were provided with individual meals 
rather than communal food like pizza or salad.

As part of their in-person operating plans, courts have laid out protocols for cleaning the courthouse and 
courtroom facilities. In addition to those protocols, the courts trying in-person jury trials added several 
cleaning protocols. First, judges made sure to assign seats to prospective and selected jurors to lessen 
the amount of cleaning necessary during breaks. If a jury shuffle was requested, the seating had to be 
cleaned prior to the next seating. Second, judges ensured that the witness stand was cleaned between 
each witness by wiping down the witness seating and other areas. Other areas of the courtroom where 
there is transition of individuals had to be cleaned during breaks and after hours.

Virtual Jury Trials

In the three virtual jury trials that have been conducted in the state (2 to verdict), the challenges are 
different and are unrelated to the pandemic. Rather, the challenges are related to technology. However, 
with planning, practice, and preparation, the courts that have conducted virtual jury proceedings have 
been able to overcome those challenges to effectively administer virtual jury trials. 

Courts trying virtual jury trials included with their summonses a remote jury questionnaire that inquired 
about the prospective jurors’ available technology and ability to participate in a private space. While 
most indicated they could, a few did not have the technology. OCA provided iPads with cell service to 
those jurors to permit them to effectively participate. A few jurors did need to be excused because of 
technology challenges, but most did not have any significant issues.

Courts trying virtual jury trials needed a technically savvy bailiff to assist prospective jurors with 
technical issues during check-in, trial, and deliberation. The issues were generally easy to overcome with 
the assistance of the bailiff. A training video was produced by OCA to assist the jurors in their preparation 
for remote participation. However, the courts needed to take extra time during the juror check-in process 
to provide this assistance. 

The courts divided the jury panel into smaller groups to allow easier observation of the prospective 
jurors during voir dire. This practice worked 
well, but it did lengthen the time required for 
voir dire. Judges, lawyers, and observers all 
indicated that they felt that the prospective 
jurors were at ease and more engaged than 
usual in the voir dire process. Prospective 
jurors were named with identifiers instead of 
their full names to increase privacy. 

Once the jury was seated, the jurors were 
attentive without distraction. Each court 
recited special admonishments to the jurors 
to address issues that were unique to a virtual 
trial. 

Jurors deliberated in a breakout room without 
difficulty and reviewed evidence that was 
submitted through a filesharing service like Box 
or DropBox.

Recommendations 

Based upon the experiences and proceedings detailed above, OCA makes the following recommendations 
regarding procedures for jury proceedings: 

1. 

In-person jury proceedings should be limited to district and county courts, including statutory county 
courts and statutory probate courts, between October 1 and December 31. 

2.  All courts should be permitted to conduct virtual jury proceedings, which are allowable under the 

current emergency order. However, in jailable criminal jury trials, virtual jury proceedings should only 
occur with appropriate waivers and consent of the defendant and prosecutor made on the record. In 
all other virtual jury trial proceedings, consent should not be required.  

3.  The local administrative district judge for each county and the presiding judge of a municipal court 

should be required, after conferring with all judges in the county (local administrative district judges) 
or city (presiding judges of municipal courts) to submit a plan for conducting jury trials consistent with 
guidelines for conducting jury trial proceedings issued by OCA. Included in those guidelines should be: 

a.  Procedures for the summoning of jurors 

Courts should be required to include with summonses information on precautions that have been 
taken to protect the health and safety of prospective jurors and COVID questionnaires that elicit 
from prospective jurors information about their exposure or vulnerability to COVID-19. Courts 
should consider using juror questionnaires for voir dire to assist in shortening the length of voir 
dire or the number of venirepersons. Courts should be encouraged to liberally grant excuses or 
reschedule prospective jurors who have been potentially exposed, who are symptomatic, and who 
are vulnerable or live with someone vulnerable to COVID-19.  

b.  Guidance on appropriate locations for jury proceedings 

Courts should be required to identify an appropriate location for conducting the various phases of 
a jury proceeding that enable adequate social distancing at all phases. Courts should detail how 
the court will ensure adequate security at the alternative location and that the court has followed 
the appropriate guidelines required of courthouses for in-person hearings.  

c.  Requirements for screening 

Courts should be required to screen all court participants and observers for elevated temperatures 
and use a questionnaire to determine if the individual has recently had symptoms of COVID-19 or 
been exposed to COVID-19. Courts should ensure that participants in a trial who are incarcerated 
should be screened by the jail/prison prior to transport to the courtroom and any known exposure, 
symptoms, or COVID-19 positive test results within the past 30 days be reported to the judge 
presiding over the jury trial.  

d.  Requirements for face coverings 

Courts should be required to ensure that all persons entering the common areas of a courthouse, 
including a courtroom or any other location being used to conduct a jury trial, wear a face covering 
at all times unless the person is an individual that is not recommended to wear a mask by the 
Centers for Disease Control or the Texas Department of State Health Services.6 

18

Courts should be required to ensure that all court participants wear face coverings from jury 
qualification through the end of trial. Court participants who may need to lower their face mask to 
speak or for a short period of time should be required to wear a face shield. When speaking, a court 
should permit a court participant to lower his or her mask so long as a face shield is worn and the 
person speaking is immobile.  

e.  Social distancing protocols 

Courts should be required to ensure that social distancing of all court participants and observers 
is maintained at all times during the jury proceeding, including during the trial and deliberation. 
Special attention should be paid by courts to ensuring adequate social distancing and managed 
exits of individuals during breaks, especially when dismissing large groups of people for a break.  

f.  Alternate Jurors 

g.  Arrangement of Courtroom 

Courts should be encouraged to consider selecting alternate jurors to permit the trial to continue in 
the event of a juror becoming ineligible to serve for a reason unrelated to that person’s exposure to 
or contraction of COVID-19. 

Courts should be required to submit as part of the jury trial plan descriptions or drawings of the 
way in which courtroom participants (judge, parties/counsel, jurors, witnesses, court reporters, 
bailiffs, public) will be arranged in the courtroom. Special attention should be paid to placement 
of the witness and parties so that the jurors, judge, and attorneys can see the witness and parties 
during testimony. Special attention should also be paid to placement of evidence presentation 
displays so that jurors and witnesses can see the information being displayed. 

Courts should plan for spaces where a judge can have sidebar or private conversations with jurors 
and counsel. 

h.  Microphone protection protocols 

Courts should be required to limit the shared use of microphones during the jury proceeding. 
If a microphone must be shared, courts should limit the passing of the microphone unless the 
microphone is cleaned between each user. In addition, the use of disposable microphone covers 
should be required to be placed on shared microphones and changed between each user. 

i.  Exhibit/evidence management 

Courts should be required to limit the use of physical or paper exhibits/evidence where feasible or 
appropriate by converting the exhibit/evidence to a digital form. When physical or paper exhibits/
evidence is required, courts should reduce the exchange of that exhibit/evidence to the number of 
persons necessary and should limit passing the exhibit/evidence to the individual members of the 
jury. If an exhibit/evidence is required to be transferred from person-to-person, single use gloves 
should be worn and discarded immediately after handling the exhibit/evidence. 

6.   Currently, the CDC recommends that children under the age of 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, incapacitated, or 

otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance not wear a mask. 

19

During jury deliberations, courts should make efforts to provide the jury with access to digital 
exhibits/evidence that would normally be shared with the jury during deliberation. Where digital 
exhibits/evidence is not feasible, courts should consider limiting the transfer of the exhibits/
evidence from juror-to-juror by spreading the exhibits/evidence on a table for inspection from the 
table in the jury deliberation room.  

Courts should be required to inquire whether witnesses to the proceedings have COVID-related 
issues. To the degree constitutionally permissible or with the consent of the parties, judges should 
permit witnesses to testify remotely via videoconference, especially if that witness has symptoms 
of or a recent positive test for COVID-19, has been recently exposed, or is vulnerable to contracting 
COVID-19. 

Courts that provide food to jurors or other participants during a jury proceeding should be required 
to ensure individual food portions, such as individually boxed meals, are provided.  

j.  Vulnerable witnesses 

k.  Food precautions 

l.  Cleaning requirements 

Courts should be required to implement frequent cleaning protocols during the jury proceeding. 
Specifically, courts should ensure that shared spaces such as witness stands, seating in the 
gallery, and seating during qualification/voir dire are cleaned during transitions of those spaces. 
Courts should assign seats for members of the jury panel and selected jurors to reduce potential 
transmission and the need for more frequent cleaning.  

4.  To assist with coordination of local resources and to manage capacity issues, each judge wishing to 
conduct a jury proceeding, including a statutory probate judge, should be required to gain approval 
for that trial by the local administrative district judge and regional presiding judge. 

5.  The local administrative district judge overseeing the conduct of an in-person jury proceeding 

should be required to consult with the local health authority not more than 5 days prior to the jury 
proceeding to verify that local health conditions and plan precautions are appropriate for the trial to 
proceed.  

6. 

In all jury trial proceedings, courts should be required to consider motions or objections related 
to proceeding with the trial, if any, on the record at least seven days prior to the trial. If motions or 
objections related to proceeding with the trial are made less than seven days prior to the trial, courts 
should be required to consider those motions on the record as soon as practicable. 

7.  Courts should establish communication protocols to ensure that no court participants have tested 
positive for COVID-19 within the last 30 days, have symptoms of COVID-19, or have been recently 
exposed to COVID-19. 

8.  Courts wishing to conduct virtual jury trials should be required to ensure that all prospective jurors 

have access to technology with which to participate. 

20

9.  OCA should be required to issue detailed guidance to assist courts wishing to conduct virtual jury trials 

and assist those courts in conducting the trials to the greatest degree possible.  

10. The regional presiding judges should be required to ensure that all courts, including the statutory 
probate courts, in each region are operating in full compliance with the Court’s Orders and the 
Guidance issued by OCA related to jury trial proceedings, report to the office of the Chief Justice of 
the Supreme Court any jury trial proceedings that are being conducted in the regions—and the court 
in which the proceedings are being conducted—that are inconsistent with the Court’s Orders and the 
Guidance issued by OCA, and assist each region’s local governments and courts to ensure that courts 
have the ability to conduct jury proceedings. 

11. OCA should coordinate with the regional presiding judges to monitor the jury trial proceedings in the 
state and the Department of State Health Services regarding the public health situation in the state 
and regions of the state and should make additional recommendations to the Supreme Court as 
necessary to ensure the health of all participants involved with and observers of jury proceedings.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
