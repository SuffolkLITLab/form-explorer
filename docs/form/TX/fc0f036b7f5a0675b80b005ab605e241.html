TIPS FOR AVOIDING MOST COMMON MISTAKES 

1)  Clearly  designate  the  age  range  of  the  victim  for  aged  based  offenses  in  the 

name  of  the  offense  (e.g., Aggravated  Sexual  Assault  of  a  Child  ˂  6  yrs, 

Aggravated Sexual Assault of a Child ˂ 14 yrs, Injury to a Child ≤ 14 yrs, Injury 

to an Elderly Individual ≥ 65 yrs).  

2)  Verify that the name of the offense, statute of the offense, degree of the offense, 

and length of the prison sentence are consistent. 

3)  Clearly designate any “drug free zone” offenses. 

4)  For continuous abuse of a child, the last date is the official offense date for all 

5)  For organized criminal activity, the first date is the official offense date for all 

6)  If the defendant is required to register as a sex offender, indicate the age of the 

victim at the time of the offense in the Sex Offender Registration section of the 

judgment. The age provided in this section is used to determine the defendant’s 

obligations  under  the  Sex  Offender  Registration  Program.  It  is  not  used  to 

determine the defendant’s eligibility for parole or mandatory supervision.

of the offense. 

Change of Venue 

If the Indictment or Information contains more than one count, enter the count number 

If venue was moved from the county of origin, enter the change of venue information in 

the gray boxes underneath “County, Texas” in the style of the judgment. Click on the first 

box and select “On change of venue from.” Click on the second box and enter the name of the 

county in which the offense occurred.  

Incident No. /TRN and State ID No.  

The  Incident  Number,  also  known  as  the  Incident  Tracking  Number  (TRN),  is 

assigned to the defendant during a specific arrest. The State Identification Number (State 

ID  No.)  is  a  unique  number  assigned  by  the  Texas  Department  of  Public  Safety  to  every 

defendant for a lifetime. 

Enter the TRN and State ID No., if these numbers have been assigned at the time of 

the judgment. The attorney for the State should have access to these numbers.  

JUDGE PRESIDING: 

 

“Judge Presiding” refers to the trial judge, which includes a visiting or judge assigned 

to the case or sentencing hearing. The visiting, assigned, or elected judge of the court may 

sign the  judgment,  even if the  visiting,  assigned,  or  elected  judge  did  not preside  over the 

trial or sentencing hearing.3   

ATE SENTENCE IMPOSED and DATE PROCEEDINGS DEFERRED: 

“Date Sentence Imposed” means the date that the court pronounced the sentence in 

open court, not the date that the sentence commences.

CHARGING INSTRUMENT:  

Enter  the  statutory  citation  for  the  offense  of conviction,  including  any  subsections 

that specify the manner in which the offense occurred and any subsections or other statutes 

that enhance the punishment range due to a special fact or circumstance in the case (e.g., the 

offense occurred in a drug free zone (Sec. 481.134, Health and Safety Code), the victim was 

at  a  tender  age  (Sec.  22.021(f),  Penal  Code),  or  the  offense  was  committed  as  part  of  the 

activities  of  a  criminal  street  gang  (Sec.  71.028(c),  Penal  Code).  A  special  fact  or 

circumstances does not include the defendant’s criminal history.  

Two  boxes  are  provided  for  this  entry.  Enter  the  section  or  article  in  the  first  box. 

Click  on  the  second  box  to  select  the  name  of  the  applicable  statute.  “Penal  Code”  is  the 

default setting. Be sure to change this setting if the defendant was charged under a different 

statute, such as the Texas Transportation Code or the Texas Health and Safety Code. 

OTE: Be as specific as possible when entering the statute or statutes for the offense. Don’t 

forget to include any subsection or statute that elevates the punishment range due to a 

special fact or circumstance of the case. Please remember that a special fact or circumstance 

does not include the defendant’s past criminal history.  

EXAMPLES 

(Assault)  There  are  three  different  manners  of  way  to  commit  an  assault  under 

Section  22.01  of  the  Penal  Code,  and  depending  on  the  manner,  the  offense  is  classified  

anywhere from a Class C misdemeanor to a second degree felony. 4  

 

4 A defendant may commit an assault by intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly: (1) causing bodily injury, (2) threatening to cause 
bodily injury, or (3) causing an offensive or provocative touching.

defendant.  

STATUTE FOR OFFENSE:   

 

 

 

 

   

Defendant  is  convicted  of  intentionally  causing  bodily  injury  by  hitting  a 

person with her fist. The statutory citation is §22.01(a)(1), Penal Code, as this 

indicates the manner in which the assault occurred.  

If  the  defendant  is  convicted  of  intentionally  causing  bodily  injury  to  her 

boyfriend  by  impeding  her  boyfriend’s  breathing  by  covering  his  mouth  and 

nose with a pillow, the statutory citation changes to Sec. 22.01(b)(2)(B), Penal 

Code,  as  this  better  describes  the  special  status  of  the  victim,  a  fact  that 

elevates the offense from a Class A misdemeanor to a 3rd degree felony. 

 

(Aggravated Sexual Assault) An aggravated sexual assault is punishable anywhere 

from 5 to 99 years or life in prison.5 However, if the victim is: (1) less than 6 years of age at 

the  time  of  the  offense;  or  (2)  less  than  14  years  of  age  at  the  time  of  the  offense  and  the 

offense  was  committed  in  the  manner  specified  in  the  statute,  the  minimum  punishment 

increases  to  25  years  and  the  defendant  is  no  longer  eligible  for  parole.6  The  enhanced 

punishment is the result of Jessica’s Law which is codified at §21.021(f), Tex. Penal Code.  

Jessica’s Law provisions (i.e., §21.021(f), Tex. Penal Code) must be clearly indicated if 

applicable.7 For instance, if the court orders the defendant to serve a period of imprisonment 

without parole, the judgment should include: (1) the name of the offense, including the age 

range of the victim, (e.g., Aggravated Sexual Assault of a Child < 6 Yrs); and/or (2) a specific 

statutory reference to §22.021(f)(1) or (2), Tex. Penal Code. The statutory reference provides 

clear notice to TDCJ that the defendant must serve a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 

years in prison and is ineligible for parole.  

Defendant is convicted of intentionally using his penis to penetrate the vagina 

of a child who was less than six years of age at the time of the offense.  The 

complete  statutory  citation  is  Sec.  22.021(a)(1)(B)(iii),(a)(2)(B)/(f)(1),  Tex. 

Penal Code.  

 

 

5 Other mandatory and optional fines may apply also. 
6 See Tex. Penal Code § 22.021(f); Tex. Gov’t Code § 508.145(a). A defendant convicted of an offense under § 22.021 is ineligible 
for release to mandatory supervision, as well. See Tex. Gov’t Code § 508.149(a)(8).

his document does not provide legal advice or modify the court’s judgment, findings or orders in the case. The sole purpose of this

NOTE:  With respect to Aggravated Sexual Assault under §22.021, Tex. Penal Code, a 

  T

defendant is ineligible for parole only if he or she is punished under Subsection (f) of that 

section which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years. Therefore, regardless of 

the offense description and statute, if the period of imprisonment is less than 25 years, the 

defendant will be deemed eligible for parole. 

 

 

 

DATE OF OFFENSE:  

“Date of Offense” is the date that the offense was committed. However, for offenses 

with a course of conduct over a period of time (e.g., organized criminal activity, continuous 

sexual assault of a child), the “Date of Offense” is the first date in a range of dates that the 

offense was committed and the  last  date  that the  offense  was  committed.  For  offense  that 

occur over a course of time, TDCJ needs both the “beginning date” and “ending date” on the 

face of the judgment. Failure to provide this information will delay the defendant’s intake 

processing at TDCJ.  

Two boxes are provided for this entry. Enter the date that the offense was committed 

in the first box. But, for offenses that occurred over a course of time (e.g., organized criminal 

activity, continuous sexual assault of a child), enter the first date in a range of dates in the 

first box and the last date in the range of dates in the second box.   

LEA TO OFFENSE:  

Enter the defendant’s plea to the offense. 

The box for  this entry contains four  options: NOLO  CONTENDERE,  GUILTY,  and 

NOT GUILTY. Click on the box and select the appropriate plea. 

EGREE OF OFFENSE:  

“Degree  of Offense” means  the classification  that  the statute  assigns  to  the  offense 

(e.g., first degree felony, Class A misdemeanor). Felonies are classified into five categories: 

(1)  capital  felonies,  (2)  first  degree  felonies,  (3)  second  degree  felonies,  (4)  third  degree 

felonies,  and  (5)  state  jail  felonies.  Do not take enhancement paragraphs based on the

D

A drop down list containing the class of most offenses is provided for this entry. Select 

the appropriate class of the offense for which the defendant was convicted, not charged. An 

offense designated a misdemeanor in the Penal Code without specification as to punishment 

or category is a Class C misdemeanor.8  An offense designated a felony in the Penal Code 

without specification as to category is a state jail felony.9 

 

  T

DISCUSSION REGARDING DEGREE OF OFFENSE 

Normally, the degree of offense determines the range of punishment that a court (or 

jury)  can  consider  when  determining  the  appropriate  punishment  for  a  defendant.  For 

instance, if the defendant is convicted of a third degree felony, the range of punishment is 2 

to 10 years in prison and a fine up to $10,000.10 However, if a defendant has a prior criminal 

history, the range of punishment is enhanced to a higher category for purposes of sentencing 

the defendant.11 When the class of the offense is enhanced for sentencing purposes, the higher 

category is known as the degree of punishment (a.k.a. degree of enhancement). 

When  entering  Degree  of  Offense,  it  is  important not to confuse  the  degree  of  the 

offense with the degree of punishment, especially if the two differ.  The degree of punishment 

does  not  change  the  degree  of  the  offense.  The  degree  of  the  offense  remains  the  same 

throughout the duration of the trial or plea. So, if a defendant is convicted of a third degree 

felony in the first phase of the trial or plea (i.e., the guilt/innocence phase), the defendant 

remains convicted of a third degree felony at the end of the second phase of the trial or plea 

(i.e., the punishment phase), even if the defendant is punished at the second degree felony

10 Other mandatory and optional fines may apply also. 
11 The court must make certain findings regarding the past criminal history before the range of punishment can be enhanced.

range.   

   

What to Do When the Degree of Punishment Differs From the Degree of Offense? 

First, the judgment does not provide an entry for the degree of punishment.  So, do 

not create a separate field or enter a special order for it. Instead, focus on entering the pleas 

and findings for the enhancement paragraphs, as this information is what legally justifies 

punishment  at  a  higher  range.12  If  the  judgment  does  not  contain  findings  on  the 

enhancement paragraphs, the omission will delay intake processing at TDCJ or result in an 

illegal sentence.

document is to provide instructions and guidance for completing the felony judgment forms promulgated by OCA.  
 

  T

EXAMPLES 

(Repeat Offender) Defendant is convicted of Kidnapping, a third degree felony. 

The State alleged  an enhancement paragraph asserting that Defendant  was 

previously convicted of a third degree felony. The court found the enhancement 

paragraph true and sentenced Defendant to 12 years in TDCJ. The Degree of 

Offense is third degree felony, although punishment is in the range for a second 

degree felony. The judgment must reflect the court’s finding of “TRUE” for the 

enhancement  paragraph.  If  it  does  not,  the  judgment  contains  an  illegal 

sentence, as the 12-year sentence is outside of the range of punishment for a 

third degree felony.   

 (Habitual  Offender)  Defendant  is  convicted  of  Burglary,  a  second  degree 

felony, after breaking into a neighbor’s house to steal money. The State alleged 

two  enhancement  paragraphs  asserting  that  Defendant  was  previously 

convicted of a third degree felony and a second degree felony. The court found 

the  enhancement  paragraphs  true  and  sentenced  Defendant  to  30  years  in 

TDCJ.  The  Degree  of  Offense  is  second  degree  felony.  The  judgment  must 

reflect the court’s findings of “TRUE” on the enhancement paragraphs in order 

to make this a valid sentence.   

INDING ON DEADLY WEAPON:  

The  judgment  must  reflect  any  affirmative  finding  of  a  deadly  weapon,  and  if  the 

deadly  weapon  is  a  firearm,  the  judgment  must  indicate  that  the  deadly  weapon  was  a 

firearm.  

  F

 

 

12 This assumes that the enhancement paragraphs reflect the defendant’s past criminal history, not enhancements due to other 
factors (i.e., the victim’s tender age, the defendant is a member of a street gang, the offense occurred in a drug free zone).

ENHANCEMENT PARAGRAPHS: This refers to enhancement paragraphs that reflect the 

  T

defendant’s past criminal history. (The options have changed.) 

The  attorney  for  the  State  may  seek  to  enhance  the  range  of  punishment  for  the 

offense during the sentencing phase  of  the  trial  (or  plea)  by  alleging  the  defendant’s  past 

criminal  history  in  enhancement  paragraphs  on  the  charging  instrument  or  in  a  written 

motion.  If  the  court  finds  that  the  enhancement  paragraphs  are  true,  the  range  of 

punishment for the offense will be enhanced to the next (for repeat offenders) or higher than 

the next (for habitual offenders) class or a mandatory minimum prison sentence will apply.13 

The amount of the enhancement will depend on the degree of the offense and the number and 

sequence of the prior convictions found true.14  

 

If the court found any of the enhancement paragraphs true, enter the defendant’s plea 

and the court’s finding for each enhancement paragraph alleged. A drop down list with four 

options  is  provided  for  this  entry.  “N/A”  is  the  default  setting.  Don’t  forget  to  change  the 

default setting if the State alleged an enhancement paragraph. An explanation of the options 

is provided below.

DJUDICATION OF GUILT DEFERRED ,  DEFENDANT  PLACED  ON  DEFERRED 

ADJUDICATION: (NEW –attach a copy of the conditions of deferred adjudication to the 

udgment) 
j

After  a  defendant  enters  a  plea  of  guilty  or  nolo  contendere,  the  court  may  defer 

further proceedings and place the defendant on deferred adjudication.  

If  the  defendant  is  placed  on  deferred  adjudication,  prepare  an  Order  of  Deferred 

Adjudication, not a Judgment of Conviction. Attach a copy of the document setting forth the 

conditions of deferred adjudication to the Order. 

OTE:    The  Order  of  Deferred  Adjudication  does  not  provide  an  entry  for  the  date  the 

sentence commences. Do not add a field for it, even if the court ordered the defendant to serve 

confinement as a condition of deferred adjudication. Confinements served as a condition of 

deferred adjudication are recorded on the first page of the Order under the heading titled, 

“Confinement as a Condition of Deferred Adjudication Community Supervision.”  

ENTENCE  OF  CONFINEMENT  SUSPENDED,  DEFENDANT  PLACED  ON 

COMMUNITY SUPERVISION:  (NEW – attach a copy of the conditions of community 

supervision to the judgment) 

After  the  court  sentences  a  defendant  to  a  term  of  confinement,  the  court  has 

discretion  to  suspend  the  sentence  of  confinement  and  place  the  defendant  on  community 

supervision.15  

 

If the court placed the defendant on community supervision, place an “X” in the box 

to indicate that the sentence of confinement was suspended and the defendant was placed on 

community supervision. Enter the period of community supervision in the two gray boxes. 

Click on the first box to enter a number. Click on the second box to select the appropriate 

unit  of  time  (i.e.,  days,  months,  years).  Attach  a  copy  of  the  document  setting  forth  the 

conditions of community supervision to the judgment. 

 

15 If the jury sentences the defendant to a term of confinement, the court can suspend the sentence and place the defendant on 
community supervision only if the jury recommends it.

PUNISHMENT AND PLACE OF CONFINEMENT: 

If  the court sentences  the defendant  to confinement, the  judgment  must  reflect  the 

period and place of confinement. 

Three boxes are provided for this entry. Enter a number (length of time) in the first 

box.  Enter  the  unit  of  time  (i.e.,  days,  months,  years)  in the  second  box  by  clicking  on the 

appropriate unit of time. The third box contains a drop down list with the names of various 

facilities. Select the name of the appropriate facility. N/A is the default setting for this entry. 

Don’t forget to change this setting if the court ordered the defendant confined. 

NOTE: If the court ordered the defendant confined as a condition of community supervision 

or deferred adjudication, do not enter information regarding punishment and place of 

confinement here. For cases involving confinement as a condition of community supervision 

or deferred adjudication, complete the section titled, “Confinement as a Condition of 

Community  Supervision,”  or  “Confinement  as  a  Condition  of  Deferred  Adjudication 

Community Supervision,” respectively. Do not enter jail credit information without also 

providing a special order that the defendant is entitled to jail time credit on time ordered 

served as a condition of community supervision or deferred adjudication. Absent a special 

order, TDCJ will not calculate jail credit for time served as a condition of community 

supervision or deferred adjudication. Enter the special order on the judgment. 

ATE SENTENCE COMMENCES: 

“Date Sentence Commences” is the date that the sentence of confinement begins. This 

entry  is  needed  only  if  the  court  executed  the  sentence  or  did  not  place  the  defendant  on 

deferred adjudication or community supervision. A sentence is executed if the defendant is 

taken into custody on the sentence, or given a designated date and time to report to the place 

of confinement to begin the sentence.

If the sentence was executed, enter the date that the confinement begins. Do not enter 

a date if the confinement was imposed as a condition of community supervision or deferred 

adjudication. Confinement as a condition of community supervision or deferred adjudication 

begins when the defendant arrives at the place of confinement, absent a special order to the 

contrary. A special order is provided in Affirmative Findings and Special Orders for the felony 

judgment forms. Enter the special order on the Judgment or Order of Deferred Adjudication. 

 

 

  T

OTE:  If a date is entered for “Date Sentence Commences,” complete the section for 

Punishment Options also.  

HIS SENTENCE SHALL RUN: (NEW – Format change) 

A defendant may have multiple convictions that result in multiple sentences. If this 

occurs,  the  judgment  is  required  to  reflect  whether  the  defendant’s  sentence  will  run 

consecutively  or  concurrently.  “N/A”  is  the  default  setting  for  this  entry.  Don’t  forget  to 

change the entry if the default setting is incorrect. 

If the court intends sentences to run consecutively, the text field for the entry must 

set  forth  the  court,  case  numbers  of  the  sentences  the  court  intends  to  run  consecutively, 

date(s) judgment entered, and sentence length for each of the consecutive cases. In order for 

a sentence to run consecutively, the order of sentences must start with the first judgment 

entered; that is, a sentence cannot be consecutive to another sentence that has a subsequent 

date of judgment.   

INES, COURT COSTS, REIMBURSEMENT FEES, and RESTITUTION: (For Judgments 

Adjudicating Guilt and Judgments Revoking Community Supervision, see NOTE #2 below.) 

A  judgment  must  reflect  the  fines  pronounced  by  the  court,  court  costs, 

reimbursement fees, and any restitution ordered by the court. Some fines, court costs16, and 

reimbursement  fees  are  mandated  by  statute,  and  unless  the  court  waives  or  reduces  a 

specifically mandated fine, court cost, or reimbursement fee, the defendant has to pay the 

 

16 As of January 1, 2020, there are two court costs, that is, the state consolidated court cost ($185 for district courts) and the local 
consolidated court cost ($105 for district courts). All other costs have been reclassified as a fine or reimbursement fee.

conditions are met and the court assesses the fine or fee.  

If applicable, enter the total amount of fines pronounced by the court, the total court 

costs, the total reimbursement fees, and any restitution amount. If the court pronounced any 

fines, in addition to entering the total amount of fines, check the appropriate box on page 2 

of the judgment form under “Fines Imposed Include (check each fine and enter each amount 

as pronounced by the court” to indicate what fines were assessed.).  

Enter  the  total  amount  of  court  costs  and  reimbursement  fees  assessed.  These 

amounts must be itemized in the bill of costs. If the court ordered restitution: (1) designate 

who should receive the restitution by selecting “Victim” or “Agency/Agent” in the drop down 

list provided; and (2) enter a special finding or attach an Order of Restitution setting forth 

the  amount  and  frequency  of  the  restitution  payments  and  the  name  and  address  of  the 

person designated to receive the payments.

OTE #3: A clerk may want to consult with the judge before assessing a fine on a defendant 

who was placed on deferred adjudication, who has not been found guilty, or who committed 

the offense before the fine went into effect or increased.   

EX OFFENDER REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS:    

Upon conviction or adjudication of certain offenses, a defendant has to register as a 

sex offender with the local law enforcement or the Texas Department of Public Safety. For a 

list of offenses that require sex offender registration upon conviction or adjudication, see Tex. 

Code Crim. Proc. art. 62.001(5). 

If a defendant is required to register as a sex offender, the judgment must contain a 

statement that the defendant is required to register and a statement of the age of the victim 

[at the time] of the offense.18 The age of the victim has an impact on the defendant’s duty to 

register. Therefore, it is important to put the age of the victim at the time of the offense on 

the judgment or order of deferred adjudication, especially if the victim is a child. 

 

If the defendant is required to register as a sex offender, check the box to indicate so.  

Next, enter the age of the victim at the time of the offense by typing a number in the first box 

and selecting the appropriate period of time in the second box.  

OTE: For this section, age does not have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but the 

best practice is to include an affirmative finding as to the age of the victim at the time of the 

ffense, if the victim is less than 17 years of age.

The defendant is entitled to jail time credit from the date of arrest and confinement 

to the date of sentencing.19 The trial court is required to pronounce the jail time credit, if any, 

at the time of sentencing.20 The credit is applied toward confinement served as a result of the 

conviction,  not  toward  confinement  served  as  a  condition  of  community  supervision  or 

deferred adjudication.21

The victim impact statement is the form used to record the impact of the offense on 

the  victim  or  the  victim’s  family.  Every  victim  has  the  right  to  complete  a  victim  impact

statement was returned to the attorney for the State.22  

A question is provided for this entry. An answer is required, even if it remains “N/A,” 

which is the default setting and applies only if the offense did not involve a victim. Change 

“N/A,” to “Yes” or “No,” if the offense involved a victim. If the victim did not return the victim 

impact statement, the answer is “NO,” not “N/A.”  

 

DILIGENT PARTICIPATION CREDIT:  (NEW entry required for state jail felonies – Tex. 

Code Crim. Proc. art. 42.0199) 

 

Diligent  participation  credit  is  time  credit  based  on  a  defendant’s  diligent 

participation in an educational, vocational, treatment, or work program while confined in the 

state jail. The credit is awarded at the court’s discretion, and it cannot exceed one-fifth of the 

defendant’s  sentence.23  If  the  defendant  is  convicted  of  a  state  jail  felony,  the  court  must 

decide whether the defendant is presumptively entitled to diligent participation credit, but 

only if the offense was committed on or after September 1, 2011. If the offense was committed 

prior to September 1, 2011, diligent participation credit does not apply and the court should 

enter “N/A” as the answer.  

An answer of “Yes” or “No” is required, if the defendant was convicted of a state jail 

felony for with the date of offense is on or after September 1, 2011. “N/A” is the default setting. 

Please remember to change the default setting to “Yes” or “No” if the offense occurred on or

NOTE #1:  “Yes” does not mean that the defendant will receive diligent participation credit. 

It simply lets TDCJ know that if the defendant meets the other legal requirements, the 

defendant is entitled to the credit.

Place an “X” in the appropriate box.  

OW TO HANDLE TRIAL IN ABSENTIA: 

OCA did not create a separate judgment for trials in absentia. If the defendant was 

tried in absentia, edit the judgment form by deleting and replacing certain language.  Delete 

“This cause was called for (trial or jury) and the parties appeared,” and replace it with, “This 

cause was called and the parties, with the exception of Defendant, appeared.”  Delete 

“Counsel/Waiver of Counsel (select one)” and any option underneath it indicating that the 

defendant  appeared.  Finally,  delete  any  other  lines  that  are  inconsistent  with  trial  in 

absentia or that do not accurately reflect what occurred in the defendant’s absence.

Put an “X” in the appropriate box. If the appropriate option is Confinement as a Condition of 

Community Supervision, enter the number of days and place of confinement in the boxes in 

the  first  sentence.  If  the  court  ordered  the  period  of  confinement  to  begin  prior  to  the 

defendant’s arrival at the place of confinement, the court must enter a special order to that 

effect. A special order is provided in Affirmative Findings and Special Orders for the felony

On 08/31/2018, Defendant was convicted of Possession of a Controlled 

Substance and sentenced to 15 months in the state jail. However, the 

court suspended the sentence and placed Defendant on probation for 2 

years. The court ordered Defendant to serve 90 days in the state jail as 

a condition of probation. After sentencing, Defendant spent 60 days in 

the county jail before he was transported to the state jail. How many 

days will Defendant serve in the state jail?

or optional, in the defendant’s presence. If the court proceeds in the defendant’s absence, the 

judge  must  still  pronounce  all  fines.  The  written  judgment  must  contain  only  the  fines 

pronounced by the judge.  

The sum of all fines checked in this section must equal the total reflected for fines on 

the  first  page  of  the  judgment.  The  statutory  amount  authorized  for  each  fine  is  in 

parenthesis. The amounts provided are for guidance purposes only and do not control. The 

judge’s pronouncement controls what fines will be imposed and how much will be imposed. 

 

DWI Traffic Fines are calculated in accordance with Transportation Code §709.001. 

Basically, the fine is $3,000 for the first conviction within a 3-year period. For a second or 

subsequent conviction within 3-years period, the fine is $4,500. However, if it shown on the 

trial (or plea) of the offense that the defendant had an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more 

at the time an analysis of the defendant’s blood, breath, or urine was performed, the fine is 

$6,000 on a first or subsequent conviction. However, if the court makes a finding that the 

defendant is indigent, the court must waive the fines imposed under Section 709.001(c).  

 

  T

OTE: A clerk may want to consult with the judge before assessing a fine on a defendant 

who was placed on deferred adjudication, who has not been found guilty, or who committed 

the offense before the fine went into effect or increased. 

XECUTION OF SENTENCE: 

Put an “X” in the box if the court ordered the sentence executed. This means that the 

court did not place the defendant on community supervision or deferred adjudication. Do not 

mark  this  box,  if  the  box  on  the  front  page  indicates  that  the  sentence  was  suspended  or 

further proceedings were deferred.

FFIRMATIVE FINDING REGARDING FELONY CONVICTION: (NEW) 

SB 1 (87(2)), effective December 2, 2012) requires the court to make an affirmative 

finding, in the trial of a felony offense, if the defendant is found guilty of the offense, that the 

defendant has been found guilty of a felony and enter the affirmative finding in the judgment 

of  the  case.  In  addition,  the  court  must  instruct  the  defendant  regarding  how  the  felony 

conviction will impact the defendant’s right to vote. A clerk should put an “X” in the box only 

the court pronounces the affirmative finding in court and on the record.  
 
f
i

FFIRMATIVE FINDINGS AND SPECIAL ORDERS: 

Affirmative  findings  and  special  orders  can  impact  a  defendant’s  punishment, 

eligibility  for  parole  or  mandatory  supervision,  or  duty  to  register  as  a  sex  offender.  For 

example, if the court enters an affirmative finding that the offense was committed because 

of bias or prejudice, the defendant must perform 300 hours of community service upon the 

defendant’s release on parole or mandatory supervision.30  

If the court entered an affirmative finding or special order, include it on the judgment 

or  order  of  deferred  adjudication.  Affirmative  findings  and  special  orders  are  provided  in 

A

ffirmative Findings and Special Orders for the felony judgment forms, or  the  court  may 

draft its own. 

HOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS IT TO PREPARE THE JUDGMENT: 

It  is  the  court’s  responsibility  to  ensure  a  judgment  is  prepared.  The  court  may 

prepare  the  judgment  or  order  the  prosecuting  attorney,  defense  attorney,  or  court  clerk, 

under the supervision of an attorney, to do so.31

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
