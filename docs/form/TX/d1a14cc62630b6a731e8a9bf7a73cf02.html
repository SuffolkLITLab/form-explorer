      <pre>Texas Court Structure

The current structure of the court system of Texas was established by an 1891 amendment to the Texas Constitution of 1876. 
The amendment established the Supreme Court as the highest state appellate court for civil matters, and the Court of Criminal 
Appeals as the highest state appellate court in criminal matters. The amendment also established courts of appeals that exercise 
intermediate appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases.1

District courts are the state’s trial courts of general jurisdiction. The geographical area served by each district court is established 
by the specific statute creating the court.

In addition to these state courts, the Texas Constitution provides for a county court in each county, presided over by the county 
judge. The county judge also serves as head of the county commissioners court, the governing body of the county. To aid 
the constitutional county court with its judicial functions, the Legislature has established statutory county courts, generally 
designated as county courts at law or statutory probate courts, in the more populous counties.

The Texas Constitution also authorizes not less than one nor more than 16 justices of the peace in each county. The justice courts 
generally have exclusive jurisdiction of civil matters when the amount in controversy does not exceed $200 and concurrent 
jurisdiction with the county courts when the amount in controversy exceeds $200 but does not exceed $20,000. These courts also 
have jurisdiction in misdemeanor cases where punishment upon conviction may be by fine only.

By statute, the Legislature has created municipal courts in each incorporated city in the state. These courts have original 
jurisdiction over violations of municipal ordinances and concurrent jurisdiction with the justice courts over misdemeanor state 
law violations, limited to the geographical confines of the municipality. Municipal courts also have civil jurisdiction limited to a 
few specific types of cases.

Trials in the justice courts and most municipal courts are not of record, and appeals therefrom are by new trial (“trial de novo”) to 
the county court, except in certain counties, where the appeal is to a county court at law or to a district court. When an appeal is 
by trial de novo, the case is tried again in the higher court, just as if the original trial had not occurred.

Jurisdiction of the various levels of courts is established by constitutional provision and by statute. Statutory jurisdiction is 
established by general statutes providing jurisdiction for all courts on a particular level, as well as by the statutes establishing 
individual courts. Thus, to determine the jurisdiction of a particular court, one must examine the Constitution; the general 
statutes establishing jurisdiction for that level of court; the specific statute authorizing the establishment of the particular court in 
question; the statutes creating other courts in the same county (whose jurisdictional provisions may affect the court in question); 
and the statutes dealing with specific subject matter (such as the Family Code, which requires, for example, that judges who are 
lawyers hear appeals from cases heard by non-lawyer judges in juvenile cases).

Judicial Administration

The Texas Supreme Court has constitutional responsibility for the efficient administration of the judicial system and possesses 
the authority to make rules of administration applicable to the courts.1 Under the direction of the Chief Justice, the Office of Court 
Administration aids the Supreme Court in carrying out its administrative duties by providing administrative support and technical 
assistance to all courts in the state.

The Supreme Court and the Texas Legislature also receive recommendations on long-range planning and improvements in the 
administration of justice from the Texas Judicial Council, a 22-member policy-making body composed of two appointees from 
each level of court, as well as appointees from the Governor and legislative branches of government. The Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court, Presiding Judge of the Court of Criminal Appeals, chief justices of each of the courts of appeals, and judges of 
each of the trial courts are generally responsible for the administration of their respective courts.

For the district and statutory county courts there is also a local administrative district judge in each county, as well as a local 
administrative statutory county court judge in each county that has a statutory county court. In counties with two or more district 
courts, a local administrative district judge is elected by the district judges in the county for a term not to exceed two years.2 
Similarly, in counties with two or more statutory county courts, a local administrative statutory county court judge is elected by 
the statutory county court judges for a term not to exceed two years. The local administrative judge is charged with implementing 
the local rules of administration, supervising the expeditious movement of court caseloads, and other administrative duties.3

To aid in the administration of justice in the trial courts, the state is divided into eleven administrative judicial regions. With the 
advice and consent of the Senate, the Governor appoints one of the active or retired district judges, or a retired appellate court 
judge who has district court experience residing in each region, as the presiding judge. The statutory probate court judges also 
select a presiding judge, who must be an active statutory probate court judge.

The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may convene periodic conferences of the chief justices of the courts of appeals, as well as 
periodic conferences of the eleven presiding judges to ensure the efficient administration of justice in the courts of the state.

By statute, the Supreme Court has administrative control over judicial branch agencies and issues Administrative Orders to 
include orders for appointments to judicial boards, commissions, and task forces.

Funding of the Judicial Branch

The State provides funding for salaries 
and operating costs of the Supreme 
Court, Court of Criminal Appeals, and 
intermediate appellate courts. The State 
funds a base salary for district judges 
and salary reimbursements for certain 
constitutional and statutory county 
court judges, as well as salaries, salary 
supplements, expenses of retirement, and 
other payroll-related benefits for certain 
prosecutors. The State also pays for or 
supplements some other expenses of 
the judicial branch, including juror pay, 
basic civil legal services, criminal indigent 
defense, judicial technology, and special 
prosecution units.

Most counties supplement the base salary 
of judges of the intermediate appellate 
courts and district courts. Counties pay the 
operating costs of district courts, as well as 
the salary of judges, salaries of other staff, 
and operating costs for constitutional 
county courts, county courts at law, 
and justice courts. Cities finance all costs 
related to the operation of municipal 
courts, including judges’ salaries.

In FY 2022, state appropriations for the 
Texas judicial system accounted for 
0.42 percent of all state appropriations.  
Fifty-nine percent of the financing for 
the judicial system came from General 
Revenue sources. Twenty-two percent 
came from dedicated General Revenue 
funds, such as the Fair Defense Account, 
the Statewide Electronic Filing System 
Account, and the Judicial and Court 
Personnel Training Fund, and the 
remaining amounts came from other 
special funds, including the Judicial Fund 
and federal funds.
