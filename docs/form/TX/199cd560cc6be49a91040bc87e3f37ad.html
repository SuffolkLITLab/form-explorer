      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre>1.  An employee accrues and is entitled to be credited for annual (vacation) leave for each month 
or fraction of a month of service, as set forth in the table below.  An employee accrues annual 
leave at the applicable rate beginning on the first day of employment and ending on the last duty 
day of state employment.  Accrued leave is the employee’s personal entitlement and is transferred 
with the employee when he transfers from one state agency to another, subject to provisions of 
Texas Government Code section 661.153 (see infra). 

.    Although  an  employee  begins  accruing  leave  credit  on  the  first  day  of  employment,  an 
employee  may  not  take  annual  leave  until  the  employee  has  six  months  of  continuous 
employment with the state. 

.  An employee should check with his or her supervisor to schedule annual leave.  If a conflict 
arises, priority in scheduling annual leave is determined by the employee’s length of service with 
the  Court.    Special  rules  may  apply  during  the  Christmas  season  due  to  the  large  number  of 
requests. 

.    Leave  Schedule.    A  full-time  employee  accrues annual  leave  and may  carry  annual  leave 
forward from one fiscal year to the next in accordance with the following schedule.  The amount 
of leave a part-time employee accrues and may carry forward is determined on a proportionate 
basis.  Unused accumulated annual leave that may not be carried forward into the next fiscal year 
shall be credited to the employee’s sick leave balance on the first day of the next fiscal year.

FIFTH COURT OF APPEALS 
EMPLOYEE LEAVE POLICY 

.03.  LEAVE POLICIES.      

 

 
A.  Annual Leave.  (TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 661.152).  
 

         

  3

 

 

.  Each full-time employee accrues sick leave credit at the rate of eight hours for each month or 
fraction of a month of employment with the State.  A part-time employee accrues sick leave on 
a proportionate basis.  There is no limit to the amount of sick leave that may be accrued or carried 
forward from one fiscal year to the next.   

 
Hours taken off for medical, dental, and other health-related appointments are considered 
 
legitimate claims against sick leave.  An employee may not take sick leave after his or her last 
day of employment. 

.    Sick  leave  with  pay  may  be  taken  when  sickness,  injury,  or  pregnancy  and  confinement 
prevent the employee’s  performance  of  duty  or  when  the  employee is needed to  care for and 
assist a member of the employee’s immediate family who is sick.  For purposes of taking regular 
sick  leave  with  pay,  the  following  persons  are  considered  to  be  members  of  the  employee’s 
immediate family:  (a) an individual who resides in the same household as the employee and is 
related to the employee by kinship, adoption, or marriage; (b) a foster child of the employee who 
resides  in  the  same  household  as  the  employee  and  who  is  under  the  conservatorship  of  the 
Department  of  Protective  and  Regulatory  Services;  and  (c)  a  minor  child  of  the  employee, 
regardless of whether the child lives in the same household. 

An employee’s use of sick leave to care for and assist members of the employee’s family 
who are not described in the previous paragraph is strictly limited to the time necessary to provide 
care and assistance to a spouse, child, or parent of the employee who needs the care and assistance 
as a direct result of a documented medical condition. 

.  An employee who must be absent from duty because of illness shall notify his supervisor or 

cause the supervisor to be notified of that fact at the earliest practicable time. 

.  To be eligible for accumulated sick leave with pay during a continuous period of more than 
three working days, an employee absent due to sickness, injury, or pregnancy and confinement 
shall send to the administrative head of the agency a doctor’s certificate showing the cause or 
nature of the condition or another written statement of the facts concerning the condition that is 
acceptable  to  the  administrative  head.    The  administrative  head  may  require  documentation 
concerning illnesses resulting in absences of three or fewer working days. 

.  Upon return to duty after a three-day or more sick leave, the employee shall, without delay, 
complete  the  prescribed  application  for  sick  leave  and  submit  the  application  through  proper 
channels to the appropriate approving authority for consideration. 

.  The administrative head of the agency may authorize exceptions to the amount of sick leave 
an employee may take.  Such exceptions are authorized on an individual basis after a review of 
the merits of the particular case.

B.  Sick Leave.  (TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. §§ 661.201–.202). 

 

C.  Donation of Sick Leave.  (TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 661.207). 

.    An  employee  may  donate  any  amount  of  the  employee’s  accrued  sick  leave  to  another 
employee of the Court who has exhausted all of his or her sick leave, including any time the 
employee may be eligible to withdraw from the sick leave pool.  An employee may not provide 
or receive remuneration or a gift in exchange for donated sick leave.  

.  An employee who receives donated sick leave may use the donated sick leave for only the 
following purposes: 

 

(a)    When  sickness,  injury,  or  pregnancy  and  confinement  prevent  the  employee’s 
performance of duty or when the employee is needed to care for and assist a member of 
the employee’s immediate family who is sick.   
 
(b)  To care for and assist members of the employee’s family who are not described in 
the  previous  paragraph  is  strictly  limited  to  the  time  necessary  to  provide  care  and 
assistance to a spouse, child, or parent of the employee who needs the care and assistance 
as a direct result of a documented medical condition. 

.  Donated sick leave  is  taxable to the recipient when the donated sick leave is  used.  (Rev. 

Ruling 90-29, 1990-1 C.B. 11). 

.  Sick Leave Pool. 

1.    Statutory  Authority.    The  Court  established  a  Sick  Leave  Pool  Policy  and  adopted  the 
following policies pursuant to the provisions of chapter 661 of the Texas Government Code. 

.  An employee is eligible to use time contributed to the sick leave pool if the employee has 
exhausted  the  employee’s  sick  leave  because  of  catastrophic  illness  or  injury  or  a  previous 
donation of time to the pool.  (TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 661.004). 

.  Administration of the Pool.  The Business Administrator shall serve as Pool Administrator for 
the Court, will develop policy and procedures to transfer accrued sick leave into and out of the 
pool, will develop rules and procedures for the operation of the pool, and will develop forms for 
contributions and usage of the sick leave pool. 

.  Procedures and Forms.  The procedures for contributing to and requesting leave from the sick 

leave pool and the applicable forms are available in the Employee Handbook. 

.  Family and Medical Leave. (TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. §§ 661.912–.913). 

1.  A state employee who has a total of at least 12 months of state service and who has worked 
at  least  1,250  hours  during  the  12-month  period  preceding  the  beginning  of  leave  under  this 
section is entitled to leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) (29 U.S.C. 
§§ 2601, et seq.).  While taking leave under the FMLA, an employee must first use all available 
and  applicable  annual  and  sick  leave.    An  employee  who  is  receiving  temporary  disability

  E

 

benefits  or  workers’  compensation  is  not  required  to  first  use  applicable  paid  annual  or  sick 
leaving while receiving leave under the FMLA. 

.    An  employee  who  has  been  employed  for  fewer  than  12  months  by  the  state  or  who  has 
worked fewer than  1,250  hours  during the 12-month period preceding the beginning of leave 
under  the  FMLA  is  eligible  to  take  a  parental  leave  of  absence  not  to  exceed  12  weeks  in 
accordance with this section.  While taking leave under the FMLA, an employee must first use 
all available and applicable annual and sick leave, and the remainder of the leave is unpaid.  The 
leave authorized by this section is limited to, and begins on the date of, the birth of a natural child 
of the employee or the adoption by or foster care placement with the employee of a child younger 
than three years of age. 
 

F.    Administrative  Leave.    Administrative  leave  can  only  be  awarded  upon  receipt  of  an  annual 
outstanding  performance  evaluation  by  a  supervisor  and  the  approval  of  the  Chief  Justice.    The 
maximum  allowable  award  of  administrative  leave  is  32  hours  per  fiscal  year.    Annual  performance 
evaluations are generally completed each summer.  Awards of administrative leave will be tracked on 
monthly  timesheets.   Administrative  leave  must  be  used  within  12  months  of  the  initial  award 
date.   Employees  cannot  rollover  administrative  leave  beyond  the  initial  12  months,  cannot  transfer 
administrative  leave  when  going  to  work  for  another  state  agency,  and  cannot  be  paid  for  unused 
administrative leave upon termination or retirement. 
 

Because  budget  cuts  restrict  the  Court’s  ability  to  monetarily  compensate  employees  for 
outstanding performance, the Court implements this leave option to reduce the impact of budget cuts on 
employee morale.  An employee with an outstanding performance evaluation may also opt to receive 
administrative  leave  in  lieu  of  one-time  merit  compensation,  if  the  administrative  leave  is  of  greater 
benefit.  Under exceptional circumstances, approved by the Chief Justice, an outstanding employee may 
receive both a combination of administrative leave and monetary compensation.  

  2

.  Emergency Leave.  A state employee is entitled to emergency leave without a deduction in 
salary because of a death in the employee’s family.  For purposes of this rule, the following are 
considered the employee’s family:  spouse, parent, brother, sister, grandparent, grandchild, or 
child of the employee or of the employee’s spouse.  The administrative head of the agency may 
grant an employee emergency leave for another reason other than a death in the family if the 
administrative head determines the employee has shown good cause for taking the emergency 
leave.  (TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 661.902). 

2.    Administrative  Closures.    Occasionally,  the  Chief  Justice  may  administratively  close  the 
Court  or  provide  for  a  staff  reduction  due  to  weather  conditions  or  other  circumstances  as 
determined appropriate.  In these instances, such time will not be charged against an employee’s 
accumulated annual or sick leave.  Employees who have previously made arrangements to be on 
leave will not receive credit for the administratively scheduled closure or staff reduction. 

 

 

.  Miscellaneous Leave Provisions. 

  1

  G

3.  Jury Duty and Court Appearance.  (TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 659.005). 
 

(a)  The time spent by an employee who is called for jury service will not be charged 
against  the  employee’s  accumulated  leave,  nor  will  the  compensation  the  employee 
receives for jury service be deducted from the employee’s salary. 

(b)  An employee who serves as a witness in an official capacity in a judicial proceeding 
or legislative hearing may not accept or receive a witness fee for the appearance.  An 
employee who appears as a witness in a judicial proceeding or legislative hearing in a 
nonofficial capacity may, under certain circumstances, be entitled to receive customary 
witness fees.  Before accepting any witness fees or reimbursement for travel and per diem, 
the employee should consult the Chief Justice. 

.    Voting.    All  employees  are  encouraged  to  exercise  their  right  to  vote  in  all  elections.  
Employees are encouraged to participate in the election process.  However, campaigning must 
take place outside of working hours or while on leave.  Employees may not use their position as 
a  state  employee  in  their  election  activities,  nor  may  any  state  property  be  utilized  for  that 
purpose.  No Court rules will affect any employee’s right to vote or rights as a private citizen to 
express opinions on political subjects or candidates. 

  4

f an election is held on a normal work day, and an employee is unable to vote prior to or 
following normal work hours, the employee may request time off during normal working hours 
to exercise his or her right to vote.  The employee will be granted a reasonable amount of time 
to accomplish this purpose.  (TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 661.914). 

5.  Military Leave. (TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. §§ 437.202, .254; 661.903, .904, .9041). 
 

(a)  An employee who is a member of the Texas military forces, a reserve component of 
the armed forces, or a member of a state or federally authorized urban search and rescue 
team is entitled to a paid leave of absence from the employee’s duties on a day on which 
the  person  is  engaged  in  authorized  training  or  duty  ordered  or  authorized  by  proper 
authority for not more than 15 workdays in a fiscal year.  During a leave of absence, the 
employee may not be subjected to loss of time, efficiency rating, personal time, sick leave 
or annual time.  When the employee is relieved from duty, the employee is to be restored 
to  the  position  the  employee  held  when  ordered  to  duty.    (TEX.  GOV’T  CODE  ANN.  § 
437.202). 

  I

 

(b)  An employee called to state active duty as a member of the Texas military forces by 
the governor or other appropriate authority in response to a natural or man-made disaster 
or because of an emergency is entitled to receive paid emergency leave without loss of 
military  leave  under  section  437.202  or  annual  leave.    However,  an  employee  who  is 
called to federal active duty as a member of the Texas military forces may not receive the 
employee’s state salary, except as provided by law.  (TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. §§ 437.254, 
661.903, .904, .9041). 

 

 

 

(c) An employee called to active duty during a national emergency to serve in a reserve 
component of the armed forces of the United States under Title 10 or 32, United States 
Code, is entitled to an unpaid leave of absence.  An employee on unpaid leave of absence 
during military duty described in this section continues to accrue state service credit for 
purposes of longevity pay, annual leave, and sick leave.  All aspects of government code 
section 661.904 apply to a leave taken under this section.  (TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 
661.904). 

 

 

.  Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Medical Services Volunteers.  An employee who is 
a volunteer firefighter or an emergency medical services volunteer (as defined in Tex. Health & 
Safety    Code  §  773.003)  is  entitled to  a  leave  of  absence to  attend  fire service  or  emergency 
medical services training conducted by a state agency or institution of higher education, not to 
exceed five working days in a fiscal year.  (TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 661.905). 
 
7.  Leave of absence without pay.  The Chief Justice may grant an employee a leave of absence 
without pay not to exceed 12 months when the leave would be in the mutual interest of the Court 
and the employee.  Except for disciplinary suspensions, active military duty, and leave covered 
by  workers’  compensation  benefits,  an  employee  must  use  all  accumulated  paid  leave 
entitlements before going on leave without pay status.  However, sick leave must first be used 
only if the employee is taking leave for a reason for which the employee is eligible for sick leave.  
An employee must formally request leave without pay status and approval of leave without pay 
must be reflected in a Personnel Action Form.  (TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 661.909). 

  6

  8

.  Other leave.  Other leave may be available to employees in accordance with the law.  (TEX. 

GOV’T CODE ANN. chapter 661). 

  
H.  Transfer of Leave Credits.  An employee transferring from one state agency to another is entitled 
to transfer credit for accumulated sick and annual leave to the new state agency if state employment is 
uninterrupted and if the employee is not paid for the leave. 

To transfer either the amount of accrued leave or the rate of leave accrual, the employee must 
request that each state agency with which the employee was employed send a statement containing the 
appropriate information regarding length of employment to the Business Administrator.  (TEX. GOV’T 
CODE ANN. § 661.153, .204). 

.  Exceptions to Leave Policy.  Exceptions to the use of sick leave and annual leave may be authorized 
by the Chief Justice on an individual basis after review of the particular case.  Neither annual leave nor 
sick leave accrues during a leave of absence without pay.  Upon returning from an extended leave of 
absence without pay, an employee will have priority consideration for a comparable job if the employee’s 
original job is not available.
