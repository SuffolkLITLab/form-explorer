      <pre>THIRD DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS LOCAL RULES 

he procedures prescribed by this local rule apply in addition to those prescribed by the Texas 
Rules of Appellate Procedure.  The Rules of Appellate Procedure continue to apply with full force 
and effect. 

ocal Rule 1.   Frivolous Appeals in Criminal Cases 

Pre-withdrawal  Compliance.  An appointed attorney who believes that an appeal in a 
criminal case is frivolous must comply with all legal requirements before filing an Anders 
brief.    The  Third  Court  requires  counsel  to  demonstrate  compliance  with  these  pre-
withdrawal requirements by filing, contemporaneously with counsel’s motion to withdraw 
and  Anders  brief,  a  completed  Certificate  of  Counsel.  The  form  for  this  certificate  is 
attached hereto and is available on the Court’s website.  It provides written verification to 
the Court that counsel has provided copies of the motion and brief to appellant, advised 
appellant of his rights, explained to appellant the procedures to be followed in a frivolous 
appeal, and informed appellant of the applicable deadlines. 

Notice to Appellant.  A sample cover letter for appointed counsel to send to appellant in 
a  frivolous  criminal  appeal  is  attached  hereto  and  is  available  on  the  Court’s  website.  
Though not required to be used by counsel, the Court strongly encourages counsel to use 
this letter to assist in fulfilling counsel’s obligations pursuant to Anders. 

Content of Anders Brief.  The Third Court does not require counsel to expressly address 
any  particular  area  in  the  Anders  brief.    However,  counsel  must  demonstrate  a  diligent 
review  of  the  record  and  the  applicable  law.    Accordingly,  the  Court  recommends 
examining the following areas of the record and the law to ensure compliance with Anders: 

  T

  L

  (

a) 

b) 

  (

c) 

  (

 

the charging instrument; 
jurisdiction; 
pre-trial matters and motions; 
any required admonishments (for example, in before a guilty plea); 
jury selection; 
expert testimony; 
jury argument; 
the court’s jury charge; 
sufficiency of the evidence; 
assistance of counsel; 
assessment of court costs or attorney’s fees; 
the judgment

(3) 
(4) 
(5) 
(6) 
(7) 
(8) 
(9) 
(10) 
(11) 
(12) 
 

This list is not exhaustive and depends, of course, on the nature of the case being appealed.  
However, discussion of these areas is helpful to the Court in making its determination of 
whether the appeal is frivolous.  Counsel is also encouraged to discuss in the brief any other 
potential errors present in the record considered by counsel. 

 

   

Respectfully submitted,

THIRD JUDICIAL DISTRICT 

THE STATE OF TEXAS 

SITTING AT AUSTIN, TEXAS 

CERTIFICATE OF COUNSEL 

In  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  Anders  v.  California,  386  U.S.  378  (1967),  I, 

[Name of Attorney], court-appointed counsel for appellant, [Name of Appellant], in the above-

referenced appeal, do hereby verify, in writing, to the Court that I have: 

notified  appellant  that  I  filed  a  motion  to  withdraw  as  counsel  with  an  accompanying 
Anders brief, and provided a copy of each to appellant; 

informed appellant of his right to file a pro se response identifying what he believes to be 
meritorious grounds to be raised in his appeal, should he so desire; 

advised  appellant  of  his  right  to  review  the  appellate  record,  should  he  wish  to  do  so, 
preparatory to filing that response; 

explained  the  process  for  obtaining  the  appellate  record,  provided  a  Motion  for  Pro  Se 
Access  to  the  Appellate  Record  lacking  only  appellant’s  signature  and  the  date,  and 
provided the mailing address for this Court; and 

informed  appellant  of  his  right  to  seek  discretionary  review  pro  se  should  this  Court 
declare his appeal frivolous.

Dear [Appellant]:  

nclosed please find a copy of the motion to withdraw as counsel and brief pursuant to Anders v. 
California that I have prepared and filed in your case.  After a diligent search of both the clerk’s 
record and reporter’s record in your case and a review of the applicable law, it is my opinion that 
no  reversible  error  occurred  at  your  [trial  /  plea  proceeding  /  sentencing  proceeding  / 
revocation proceeding / adjudication proceeding]. 

henever appellate counsel files a motion such as this, the law provides the appellant the right 
to review the record and file a response identifying to the appellate court any grounds he thinks 
are  non-frivolous  issues  to  be  raised  on  his  behalf  that  the  appellate  court  should  consider  in 
deciding whether the case presents any meritorious grounds for appeal.  Because I have filed this 
motion and brief, you now have the right to review the record and file a response or brief if you 
so  choose.    To  assist  you  in  obtaining  the  record  if  you  wish  to  review  it,  I  have  enclosed  a 
Motion for Pro Se Access to the Appellate Record for you to file.  In order to obtain the appellate 
record, you must sign and date the motion and mail it to the Third Court of Appeals within ten 
days of the date of this letter at the following address: 
 

Jeffrey D. Kyle, Clerk 
Third Court of Appeals 
Post Office Box 12547 
Austin, Texas 78711 

  
The Court of Appeals will then direct the clerk of the trial court to provide you with a copy of the 
appellate record.  Your response will be due to be filed in the Third Court of Appeals within 30 
days of the date the clerk provides the record to you. 

hether or not you file a response, the law requires the Court of Appeals to review the record to 
determine if the Court agrees with my assessment that no meritorious grounds for appeal exist, 
i.e.,  that  no  reversible  error  exists.    If  the  Court  does  not  agree,  but  instead  believes  there  are 
non-frivolous issues to be raised on your behalf, the Court must abate the appeal to have another 
attorney appointed to review the record on your behalf. 

hould  the  Court  of  Appeals  ultimately  determine  that  there  are  no  meritorious  grounds  to  be 
raised and that your appeal is frivolous, the Court will affirm your [conviction and sentence / 
revocation / adjudication].  You may then file a pro se petition for discretionary review with 
the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.  Such petition must be filed within 30 days of the date the 
Court of Appeals renders its judgment. 

eel free to write me if you have any questions about the procedure utilized in your appeal.  I 

will do my best to answer any questions you may have.
