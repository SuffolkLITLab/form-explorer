 – any unique supporting document including exhibits and proposed orders that 

 - any files stored in an electronic format. This can include (but is not limited to) 

a pleading, plea, motion, application, request, exhibit, brief, memorandum of law, 

Document –

NARA 
If filing a single document, it is the lead document. 
NIEM

– a document as defined by Rule 21 (a) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. 

 - National Archives and Records Administration 
 – National Information Exchange Model – a partnership of the U.S. Department of 

Justice, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services designed to develop, disseminate and support enterprise-wide information 
exchange standards and processes that can enable jurisdictions to effectively share critical 
information in emergency situations, as well as support the day-to-day operations of agencies 
throughout the nation. NIEM was adopted formally by JCIT and is promulgated in data 
Electronic Court Filing (ECF) standards
exchanges in Texas Administrative Code, Title 1, Part 8, Chapter 177. 

 - a set of non-proprietary extensible markup

OCR
PDF

 – Optical Character Recognition 
 – Portable Document Format – for the purpose of these standards this is PDF 1.4 (ISO 

19005-1:2005 – Revised as ISP/NP 19005-1). This standard specifies how to use PDF for 
long-term preservation of electronic documents and is applicable to documents containing 
PDF Distiller 
combinations of character, raster and vector data. 

– a program or application that converts files into PDF files so that the printed 

appearance of a document is preserved regardless of the application used to create it. This 
PDF Software
functionality is commonly seen as “Print to PDF”, “Save to PDF” or “Export to PDF”. 

 – software that conforms to International Organization for Standardization 

(ISO) 32000-1:2008. This standard specifies standards for creating (writing), reading, 
JCIT
displaying and interacting with PDF documents.

SYSTEM DATA EXCHANGE STANDARDS 

2
In accordance with Texas Administrative Code, Title 1, Part 8, Chapter 177, information exchanges 
that occur between the various systems (electronic filing manager, case management, document 
management, etc.) should occur using the current OASIS LegalXML specifications. The OASIS 
LegalXML specification is a subset to NIEM. 
 

DIGITAL MEDIA STANDARDS 

3
In addition to content and formatting promulgated by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Texas 
Code of Criminal Procedure, and Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, the following standards apply 
to digital media filed electronically or scanned from source records (filed after the effective date of 
these standards) by the clerk.  

 
DOCUMENTS 
An e-filed document must be in text-searchable PDF, using fonts specified in the PDF 
specification, on 8.5x11 page size, with the content appropriately rotated.   
 
When possible, the document should be generated directly from the originating software 
using a PDF distiller. 
 
Prior to being filed electronically, a scanned document must have a resolution of 300 DPI. 
Preferably, scanned documents should be made searchable using OCR technology.

3.1

 
An e-filed document may not contain any security or feature restrictions including 
password protection or encryption and may not contain embedded multi-media video, 
audio, or programming.   
 
Documents may not contain package PDF’s.  PDF’s should not be embedded inside of 
another PDF. Documents may not contain embedded fonts. Each document must be a single 
PDF.  An appellate court may require that multiple PDF documents be combined into a 
single PDF document and bookmarks used to separate content appropriately. The content 
of the document should not depend on bookmarks.   
 
Any e-filed document filename should contain only alphanumeric characters that are part of 
the Latin1_General character set. No special characters are allowed and the length of the 
filename should be restricted to 50 characters. 

When an audio/video file is natively supported by at least one media player listed in these 
standards, the file must not be converted into another format. 
 
If an audio/video file is not natively supported by at least one media player listed in these 
standards, the file must be converted to another format supported by at least one media 
player listed. The original, any hardware requirements, and software needed to view/hear 
the original must be submitted as well.  
 
If modifications are needed to enhance the native audio/video, a copy of the original must 
be made. The modified copy (submitted in addition to the original audio/video) must also 
be generated in a format supported by at least one media player listed in these standards.

EFILING FILING CONFIGURATIONS 

4
Below are the standard filing configurations to be used in the eFiling system for district, county 
court at law, probate, and constitutional county courts. This list of filing configurations must be 
accepted in each court. Courts and clerks may not add to this configuration, but may eliminate 
codes if not needed in a particular jurisdiction.  

It is important to note that these standards only apply to the electronic filing system which is a 
delivery system and are NOT standards for a county case management or document management 
system.

 In some counties, clerks use additional services to route money to the appropriate general ledger accounts. 
In these cases, clerks can use “Z-(County Use Only) – Service – Constable” additional services to route to the 
appropriate account. In these cases, the services listed should be associated with an existing “Service – 
Constable” type of additional service that the filer would normally use.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
