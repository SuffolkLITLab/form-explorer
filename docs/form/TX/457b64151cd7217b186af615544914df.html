════════════════════ 
Misc. Docket No. 15-9048 
════════════════════ 
 
════════════════════════════════════════════════════ 
 
FINAL APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO THE TEXAS RULES OF EVIDENCE 
 
════════════════════════════════════════════════════ 

RDERED that: 

By order dated November 19, 2014, in Misc. Docket No. 14-9232, the Supreme Court of 
Texas  approved  amendments  to  the  Texas  Rules  of  Evidence  and  invited  public 
comment.  After  receiving  public  comments,  the  Supreme  Court  made  revisions  to  the 
rules. This order incorporates those revisions and contains the final version of the rules. 
The amendments are effective April 1, 2015. 

Except  for  the  amendments  to  Rules  511  and  613,  which  include  substantive 
amendments,  these  amendments  comprise  a  general  restyling  of  the  Texas  Rules  of 
Evidence.  They  seek  to  make  the  rules  more  easily  understood  and  to  make  style  and 
terminology  consistent  throughout.  The  restyling  changes  are  intended  to  be  stylistic 
only. 

Following  a  lengthy  restyling  process,  the  Federal  Rules  of  Evidence  were  amended 
effective December 1, 2011. The Texas Rules of Evidence restyling project was initiated 
with the aim of keeping the Texas Rules as consistent as possible with Federal Rules, but 
without effecting any substantive change in Texas evidence law. 

ollowing  the  lead  of  the  drafters  of  the  restyled  Federal  Rules,  the  drafters  of  the 
restyled  Texas  Rules  were  guided  in  their  drafting,  usage,  and  style  by  Bryan  Garner, 
Guidelines  for  Drafting  and  Editing  Court  Rules,  Administrative  Office  of  the  United 
States  Courts  (1996)  and  Bryan  Garner,  Dictionary  of  Modern  Legal  Usage  (2d  ed. 
1995).

Formatting Changes 

Many  of  the  changes  in  the  restyled  rules  result  from  using  format  to  achieve  clearer 
presentations.  The  rules  are  broken  down  into  constituent  parts,  using  progressively 
indented  subparagraphs  with  headings  and  substituting  vertical  for  horizontal  lists.

“Hanging indents” are used throughout. These formatting changes make the structure of 
the rules graphic and make the restyled rules easier to read and understand even when the 
words  are  not  changed.  Rules  103,  404(b),  606(b),  and  612  illustrate  the  benefits  of 
formatting changes. 

Changes to Reduce Inconsistent, Ambiguous, Redundant, Repetitive, or Archaic Words 

The restyled rules reduce the use of inconsistent terms that say the same thing in different 
ways.  Because  different  words  are  presumed  to  have  different  meanings,  inconsistent 
usage can result in confusion. The restyled rules reduce inconsistencies by using the same 
words  to  express  the  same  meaning.  For  example,  consistent  expression  is  achieved  by 
not  switching  between  “accused”  and  “defendant”  or  between  “party  opponent”  and 
“opposing  party”  or  between 
the  various  formulations  of  civil  and  criminal 
action/case/proceeding. 

The  restyled  rules  minimize  the  use  of  inherently  ambiguous  words.  For  example,  the 
word  “shall”  can  mean  “must,”  “may,”  or  something  else,  depending  on  context.  The 
restyled rules replace “shall” with “must,” “may,” or “should,” depending on which one 
the context and established interpretation make correct in each rule. 

The  restyled  rules  minimize  the  use  of  redundant  “intensifiers.”  These  are  expressions 
that  attempt  to  add  emphasis,  but  instead  state  the  obvious  and  create  negative 
implications  for  other  rules.  The  absence  of  intensifiers  in  the  restyled  rules  does  not 
change their substantive meaning.  See, e.g., Rule 602 (omitting “but need not”). 

The restyled rules also remove words and concepts that are outdated or redundant. 

Rule Numbers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  restyled  rules  keep  the  same  numbers  to  minimize  the  effect  on  research. 
Subdivisions  have  been  rearranged  within  some  rules  to  achieve  greater  clarity  and 
simplicity. 
 
The  amendments  to  Rule  511  align  Texas  law  on  waiver  of  privilege  by  voluntary 
disclosure with Federal Rule of Evidence 502.  
 
In response to public comments, the Court made the following changes to the version of 
the restyled rules proposed by Misc. Docket No. 14-9232. 

.       The  comment  to  Rule  509  has  been  revised  to  add  the  following  sentence  to  the 
end  of  the  comment:  “Finally,  reconciling  the  provisions  of  Rule  509  with  the 
parts  of  Tex.  Occ.  Code  ch.  159  that  address  a  physician-patient  privilege 
applicable to court proceedings is beyond the scope of the restyling project.”  
 
The comment to Rule 510 has been revised to add the following paragraph: “Tex. 
Health & Safety Code ch. 611 addresses confidentiality rules for communications

between  a  patient  and  a  mental-health  professional  and  for  the  professional’s 
treatment  records.  Many  of  these  provisions  apply  in  contexts  other  than  court 
proceedings. Reconciling the provisions of Rule 510 with the parts of chapter 611 
that  address  a  mental-health-information  privilege  applicable to  court  proceedings 
is beyond the scope of the restyling project.” 
 
The  comment  to  Rule  613  has  been  revised.  The  comment  now  reads:  “The 
amended  rule  retains  the  requirement  that  a  witness  be  given  an  opportunity  to 
explain  or  deny  (a)  a  prior  inconsistent  statement  or  (b)  the  circumstances  or  a 
statement  showing  the  witness’s  bias  or  interest,  but  this  requirement  is  not 
imposed  on  the  examining  attorney.  A  witness  may  have  to  wait  until  redirect 
examination  to  explain  a  prior  inconsistent  statement  or  the  circumstances  or  a 
statement  that  shows  bias.  But  the  impeaching  attorney  still  is  not  permitted  to 
introduce extrinsic evidence of the witness’s prior inconsistent statement or bias 
unless  the  witness  has  first  been  examined  about  the  statement  or  bias  and  has 
failed to unequivocally admit it. All other changes to the rule are intended to be 
stylistic only.” 
 
The  Court  revised  Rule  804(b)(1)(A)(i)  to  remove  redundant  language.  The 
change is stylistic only. 

The Court revised Rule 902(10)(B) to add the following sentence to the text of the 
rule:  “The  proponent  may  use  an  unsworn  declaration  made  under  penalty  of 
perjury in place of an affidavit.” 

The Clerk is directed to: 

a. 

 

file a copy of this order with the Secretary of State; 

cause a copy of this order to be mailed to each registered member of the State Bar 
of Texas by publication in the Texas Bar Journal; 

send a copy of this order to each elected member of the Legislature; and 

submit a copy of the order for publication in the Texas Register.

ARTICLE I. 
GENERAL PROVISIONS 

ule 101. 

Title, Scope, and Applicability of the Rules; Definitions 

Title. These rules may be cited as the Texas Rules of Evidence. 

Scope. These rules apply to proceedings in Texas courts except as otherwise provided in 
subdivisions (d)-(f). 

Rules on Privilege. The rules on privilege apply to all stages of a case or proceeding. 

Exception  for  Constitutional  or  Statutory  Provisions  or  Other  Rules.  Despite  these 
rules, a court must admit or exclude evidence if required to do so by the United States or 
Texas Constitution, a federal or Texas statute, or a rule prescribed by the United States or 
Texas Supreme Court or the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. If possible, a court should 
resolve  by  reasonable  construction  any  inconsistency  between  these  rules  and  applicable 
constitutional or statutory provisions or other rules. 

e) 

Exceptions.  These rules—except for those on privilege—do not apply to: 

the  court’s  determination,  under  Rule  104(a),  on  a  preliminary  question  of  fact 
governing admissibility; 

    R

grand jury proceedings; and 

the following miscellaneous proceedings: 

an  application  for  habeas  corpus  in  extradition,  rendition,  or  interstate 
detainer proceedings; 

an inquiry by the court under Code of Criminal Procedure article 46B.004 
to determine whether evidence exists that would support a finding that the 
defendant may be incompetent to stand trial; 

C) 

bail proceedings other than hearings to deny, revoke, or increase bail; 

D) 

hearings on justification for pretrial detention not involving bail; 

E) 

proceedings to issue a search or arrest warrant; and 

F) 

direct contempt determination proceedings.

Exception for Military Justice Hearings. The Texas Code of Military Justice, Tex. Gov’t 
Code  §§  432.001-432.195,  governs  the  admissibility  of  evidence  in  hearings  held  under 
that Code. 

“criminal  case”  means  a  criminal  action  or  proceeding,  including  an  examining 
trial; 

“public office” includes a public agency;  

“record” includes a memorandum, report, or data compilation;  

a “rule prescribed by the United States or Texas Supreme Court or the Texas Court 
of Criminal Appeals” means a rule adopted by any of those courts under statutory 
authority;  

“unsworn  declaration”  means  an  unsworn  declaration  made  in  accordance  with 
Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 132.001; and 

a  reference  to  any  kind  of  written  material  or  any  other  medium  includes 
electronically stored information.

Definitions. In these rules:  

(1) 

“civil case” means a civil action or proceeding;  

omment to 2015 Restyling:  The reference to “hierarchical governance” in former Rule 101(c) 
has been deleted as unnecessary. The textual limitation of former Rule 101(c) to criminal cases 
has been eliminated. Courts in civil cases must also admit or exclude evidence when required to 
do  so  by  constitutional  or  statutory  provisions  or  other  rules  that  take  precedence  over  these 
rules. Likewise, the title to former Rule 101(d) has been changed to more accurately indicate the 
purpose and scope of the subdivision. 
   

ule 102. 

Purpose  

hese  rules  should  be  construed  so  as  to  administer  every  proceeding  fairly,  eliminate 
unjustifiable  expense  and  delay,  and  promote  the  development  of  evidence  law,  to  the  end  of 
ascertaining the truth and securing a just determination. 

ule 103. 

Rulings on Evidence  

a) 

Preserving a Claim of Error. A party may claim error in a ruling to admit or exclude 
evidence only if the error affects a substantial right of the party and:  

(1) 

if the ruling admits evidence, a party, on the record:

(A) 

timely objects or moves to strike; and  

(B) 

states the specific ground, unless it was apparent from the context; or  

(2) 

if  the  ruling  excludes  evidence,  a  party  informs  the  court  of  its  substance  by  an 
offer of proof, unless the substance was apparent from the context.  

Not Needing to Renew an Objection. When the court hears a party’s objections outside 
the presence of the jury and rules that evidence is admissible, a party need not renew an 
objection to preserve a claim of error for appeal. 

Court’s  Statement  About  the  Ruling;  Directing  an  Offer  of  Proof.  The  court  must 
allow  a  party  to  make  an  offer  of  proof  outside  the  jury’s  presence  as  soon  as 
practicable—and before the court reads its charge to the jury. The court may make any 
statement about the character or form of the evidence, the objection made, and the ruling. 
At a party’s request, the court must direct that an offer of proof be made in question-and-
answer form. Or the court may do so on its own.  

Preventing the Jury from Hearing Inadmissible Evidence. To the extent practicable, 
the court must conduct a jury trial so that inadmissible evidence is not suggested to the 
jury by any means.  

Taking  Notice  of  Fundamental  Error  in  Criminal  Cases.  In  criminal  cases,  a  court 
may take notice of a fundamental error affecting a substantial right, even if the claim of 
error was not properly preserved.  

ule 104. 

Preliminary Questions  

In General. The court must decide any preliminary question about whether a witness is 
qualified,  a  privilege  exists,  or  evidence  is  admissible.  In  so  deciding,  the  court  is  not 
bound by evidence rules, except those on privilege.  

Relevance  That  Depends  on  a  Fact.  When  the  relevance  of  evidence  depends  on 
whether a fact exists, proof must be introduced sufficient to support a finding that the fact 
does exist. The court may admit the proposed evidence on the condition that the proof be 
introduced later.  

c) 

Conducting a Hearing So That the Jury Cannot Hear It. The court must conduct any 
hearing on a preliminary question so that the jury cannot hear it if:  

the hearing involves the admissibility of a confession in a criminal case;  

a defendant in a criminal case is a witness and so requests; or  

justice so requires.

Cross-Examining  a  Defendant  in  a  Criminal  Case.  By  testifying  outside  the  jury’s 
hearing on a preliminary question, a defendant in a criminal case does not become subject 
to cross-examination on other issues in the case.  

Evidence Relevant to Weight and Credibility. This rule does not limit a party’s right to 
introduce  before  the  jury  evidence  that  is  relevant  to  the  weight  or  credibility  of  other 
evidence. 

ule 105.  

Evidence  That  Is  Not  Admissible  Against  Other  Parties  or  for  Other 
Purposes 

Limiting  Admitted  Evidence.  If  the  court  admits  evidence  that  is  admissible  against  a 
party or for a purpose—but not against another party or for another purpose—the court, 
on request, must restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly.  

b) 

Preserving a Claim of Error. 

(1) 

(2) 

Court  Admits  the  Evidence  Without  Restriction.  A  party  may  claim  error  in  a 
ruling to admit evidence that is admissible against a party or for a purpose—but 
not  against  another  party  or  for  another  purpose—only  if  the  party  requests  the 
court to restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly. 

Court  Excludes  the  Evidence.  A  party  may  claim  error  in  a  ruling  to  exclude 
evidence  that  is  admissible  against  a  party  or  for  a  purpose—but  not  against 
another party or for another purpose—only if the party limits its offer to the party 
against whom or the purpose for which the evidence is admissible.   

ule 106. 

Remainder of or Related Writings or Recorded Statements  

f  a  party  introduces  all  or  part  of  a  writing  or  recorded  statement,  an  adverse  party  may 
introduce,  at  that  time,  any  other  part—or  any  other  writing  or  recorded  statement—that  in 
fairness  ought  to  be  considered  at  the  same  time.  “Writing  or  recorded  statement”  includes 
depositions. 

ule 107. 

Rule of Optional Completeness 

f  a  party  introduces  part  of  an act,  declaration,  conversation, writing, or recorded statement, an 
adverse  party  may  inquire  into  any  other  part  on  the  same  subject.  An  adverse  party  may  also 
introduce any other act, declaration, conversation, writing, or recorded statement that is necessary 
to explain or allow the trier of fact to fully understand the part offered by the opponent. “Writing or 
recorded statement” includes a deposition.

takes judicial notice before notifying a party, the party, on request, is still entitled to be 
heard.  

Instructing the Jury. In a civil case, the court must instruct the jury to accept the noticed 
fact as conclusive. In a criminal case, the court must instruct the jury that it may or may 
not accept the noticed fact as conclusive.

ule 403.  

Excluding Relevant Evidence for Prejudice, Confusion, or Other Reasons  

he court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a 
danger  of  one  or  more  of  the  following:  unfair  prejudice,  confusing  the  issues,  misleading  the 
jury, undue delay, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.  

Prohibited  Uses.  Evidence  of  a  person’s  character  or  character  trait  is  not 
admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance 
with the character or trait. 

2) 

Exceptions for an Accused. 

In  a  criminal  case,  a  defendant  may  offer  evidence  of  the  defendant’s 
pertinent  trait,  and  if  the  evidence  is  admitted,  the  prosecutor  may  offer 
evidence to rebut it.

In a homicide case, the prosecutor may offer evidence of the victim’s trait 
of peacefulness to rebut evidence that the victim was the first aggressor.  

In a civil case, a party accused of assaultive conduct may offer evidence of 
the victim’s trait of violence to prove self-defense, and if the evidence is 
admitted,  the  accusing  party  may  offer  evidence  of  the  victim’s  trait  of 
peacefulness.

Prohibited  Uses.  Evidence  of  a  crime,  wrong,  or  other  act  is  not  admissible  to 
prove  a  person’s  character  in  order  to  show  that  on  a  particular  occasion  the 
person acted in accordance with the character.   

Permitted Uses; Notice in Criminal Case. This evidence may be admissible for 
another  purpose,  such  as  proving  motive,  opportunity,  intent,  preparation,  plan, 
knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident. On timely request by 
a  defendant  in  a  criminal  case,  the  prosecutor  must  provide  reasonable  notice 
before  trial  that  the  prosecution  intends  to  introduce  such  evidence—other  than 
that arising in the same transaction—in its case-in-chief.

ule 405.  Methods of Proving Character 

a) 

By Reputation or Opinion. 

  R

  (

 

In  General.  When  evidence  of  a  person’s  character  or  character  trait  is 
admissible,  it  may  be  proved  by  testimony  about  the  person’s  reputation  or  by 
testimony  in  the  form  of  an  opinion.  On  cross-examination  of  the  character 
witness,  inquiry  may  be  made  into  relevant  specific  instances  of  the  person’s 
conduct. 

Accused’s Character in a Criminal Case. In the guilt stage of a criminal case, a 
witness may testify to the defendant’s character or character trait only if, before 
the day of the offense, the witness was familiar with the defendant’s reputation or 
the facts or information that form the basis of the witness’s opinion.

(b) 

By  Specific  Instances  of  Conduct.  When  a  person’s  character  or  character  trait  is  an 
essential element of a charge, claim, or defense, the character or trait may also be proved 
by relevant specific instances of the person’s conduct.  

ule 406.   Habit; Routine Practice  

vidence of a person’s habit or an organization’s routine practice may be admitted to prove that 
on a particular occasion the person or organization acted in accordance with the habit or routine 
practice. The court may admit this evidence regardless of whether it is corroborated or whether 
there was an eyewitness.  

ule 407.  

Subsequent Remedial Measures; Notification of Defect 

a) 

Subsequent  Remedial  Measures.  When  measures  are  taken  that  would  have  made  an 
earlier  injury  or  harm  less  likely  to  occur,  evidence  of  the  subsequent  measures  is  not 
admissible to prove: 

 

•  negligence; 
•  culpable conduct; 
•  a defect in a product or its design; or 
•  a need for a warning or instruction. 

But the court may admit this evidence for another purpose, such as impeachment or—if 
disputed—proving ownership, control, or the feasibility of precautionary measures. 

b) 

Notification of Defect.  A manufacturer’s written notification to a purchaser of a defect 
in one of its products is admissible against the manufacturer to prove the defect. 

omment to 2015 Restyling: Rule 407 previously provided that evidence was not excluded if 
offered for a purpose not explicitly prohibited by the Rule. To improve the language of the Rule, 
it now provides that the court may admit evidence if offered for a permissible purpose. There is 
no intent to change the process for admitting evidence covered by the Rule. It remains the case 
that if offered for an impermissible purpose, it must be excluded, and if offered for a purpose not 
barred  by  the  Rule,  its  admissibility  remains  governed  by  the  general  principles  of  Rules  402, 
403, 801, etc.

conduct or statements made during compromise negotiations about the claim. 

Permissible  Uses.  The  court  may  admit  this  evidence  for  another  purpose,  such  as 
proving a party’s or witness’s bias, prejudice, or interest, negating a contention of undue 
delay, or proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution.  

omment to 2015 Restyling: Rule 408 previously provided that evidence was not excluded if 
offered for a purpose not explicitly prohibited by the Rule. To improve the language of the Rule, 
it now provides that the court may admit evidence if offered for a permissible purpose. There is 
no intent to change the process for admitting evidence covered by the Rule. It remains the case 
that if offered for an impermissible purpose, it must be excluded, and if offered for a purpose not 
barred  by  the  Rule,  its  admissibility  remains  governed  by  the  general  principles  of  Rules  402, 
403, 801, etc. 

he reference to “liability” has been deleted on the ground that the deletion makes the Rule flow 
better  and  easier  to  read,  and  because  “liability”  is  covered  by  the  broader  term  “validity.”  
Courts have not made substantive decisions on the basis of any distinction between validity and 
liability. No change in current practice or in the coverage of the Rule is intended. 

inally, the sentence of the Rule referring to evidence “otherwise discoverable” has been deleted 
as  superfluous.  The  intent  of  the  sentence  was  to  prevent  a  party  from  trying  to  immunize 
admissible  information,  such  as  a  pre-existing  document,  through  the  pretense  of  disclosing  it 
during  compromise  negotiations.  But  even  without  the  sentence,  the  Rule  cannot  be  read  to 
protect pre-existing information simply because it was presented to the adversary in compromise 
negotiations.

a  crime  against  the  other  spouse, any  member  of  the  household  of 
either spouse, or any minor child; or 

bigamy under Section 25.01 of the Penal Code. 

General  Rule.  In  a  criminal  case,  an  accused’s  spouse  has  a  privilege  not  to  be 
called to testify for the state. But this rule neither prohibits a spouse from testifying 
voluntarily  for  the  state  nor  gives  a  spouse  a  privilege  to  refuse  to  be  called  to 
testify for the accused.  

Failure to Call Spouse. If other evidence indicates that the accused’s spouse could 
testify  to  relevant  matters,  an  accused’s  failure  to  call  the  spouse  to  testify  is  a 
proper subject of comment by counsel. 

3)  Who  May  Claim.  The  privilege  not  to  testify  may  be  claimed  by  the  accused’s 

spouse or the spouse’s guardian or representative, but not by the accused.

omment to 2015 Restyling: Previously, Rule 504(b)(1) provided that, “A spouse who testifies 
on behalf of an accused is subject to cross-examination as provided in Rule 611(b).” That sentence 
was included in the original version of Rule 504 when the Texas Rules of Criminal Evidence were 
promulgated in 1986 and changed the rule to a testimonial privilege held by the witness spouse. 
Until then, a spouse was deemed incompetent to testify against his or her defendant spouse, and 
when a spouse testified on behalf of a defendant spouse, the state was limited to cross-examining 
the spouse about matters relating to the spouse’s direct testimony. The quoted sentence from the 
original Criminal Rule 504(b) was designed to overturn this limitation and allow the state to cross-
examine a testifying spouse in the same manner as any other witness. More than twenty-five years 
later, it is clear that a spouse who testifies either for or against a defendant spouse may be cross-
examined in the same manner as any other witness. Therefore, the continued inclusion in the rule 
of a provision that refers only to the cross-examination of a spouse who testifies on behalf of the 
accused  is  more  confusing  than  helpful.  Its  deletion  is  designed  to  clarify  the  rule  and  does  not 
change existing law.

Procedures.   

(C) 
 

(i) 

If  it  appears  that  an  informer  may  be  able  to  give  the  testimony 
required  to  invoke  this  exception  and  the  public  entity  claims  the 
privilege,  the  court  must  give  the  public  entity  an  opportunity  to 
show in camera facts relevant to determining whether this exception 
is met. The showing should ordinarily be made by affidavits, but the 
court  may  take  testimony  if  it  finds  the  matter  cannot  be 
satisfactorily resolved by affidavits. 

ii) 

No counsel or party may attend the in camera showing. 

The  court  must  seal  and  preserve  for  appeal  evidence  submitted 
under this subparagraph (2)(C). The evidence must not otherwise be 
revealed without the public entity’s consent. 

On the public entity’s request, the court must order the disclosure be 
made in camera. 

ii) 

No counsel or party may attend the in camera disclosure. 

If the informer’s identity is disclosed in camera, the court must seal 
and preserve for appeal the record of the in camera proceeding. The 
record of the in camera proceeding must not otherwise be revealed 
without the public entity’s consent.  

3) 

Legality of Obtaining Evidence.

Limited  Privilege  in  a  Criminal  Case.  There  is  no  physician–patient  privilege  in  a 
criminal  case.  But  a  confidential  communication  is  not  admissible  in  a  criminal  case  if 
made: 

to a person involved in the treatment of or examination for alcohol or drug abuse; 
and 

by a person being treated voluntarily or being examined for admission to treatment 
for alcohol or drug abuse. 

 

(c) 

General Rule in a Civil Case. In a civil case, a patient has a privilege to refuse to disclose 
and to prevent any other person from disclosing: 

a confidential communication between a physician and the patient that relates to or 
was made in connection with any professional services the physician rendered the 
patient; and 

a  record  of  the  patient’s  identity,  diagnosis,  evaluation,  or  treatment  created  or 
maintained by a physician. 

d)  Who May Claim in a Civil Case. The privilege may be claimed by: 

the patient; or 

the patient’s representative on the patient’s behalf. 

The  physician  may  claim  the  privilege  on  the  patient’s  behalf—and  is  presumed  to  have 
authority to do so.

Comment to 2015 Restyling: The physician–patient privilege in a civil case was first enacted in 
Texas in 1981 as part of the Medical Practice Act, formerly codified in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 
4495b. That statute provided that the privilege applied even if a patient had received a physician’s 
services before the statute’s enactment. Because more than thirty years have now passed, it is no 
longer necessary to burden the text of the rule with a statement regarding the privilege’s retroactive 
application. But deleting this statement from the rule’s text is not intended as a substantive change 
in the law.

The  former  rule’s  reference  to  “confidentiality  or”  and  “administrative  proceedings”  in 
subdivision (e) [Exceptions in a Civil Case] has been deleted. First, this rule is a privilege rule 
only.  Tex.  Occ.  Code  §  159.004  sets  forth  exceptions  to  a  physician’s  duty  to  maintain 
confidentiality of patient  information outside court and administrative proceedings. Second, by 
their own terms the rules of evidence govern only proceedings in Texas courts. See Rule 101(b). 
To  the  extent  the  rules  apply  in  administrative  proceedings,  it  is  because  the  Administrative 
Procedure  Act  mandates  their  applicability.  Tex.  Gov’t  Code  §  2001.083  provides  that  “[i]n  a 
contested  case,  a  state  agency  shall  give  effect  to  the  rules  of  privilege  recognized  by  law.” 
Section 2001.091 excludes privileged material from discovery in contested administrative cases.   

tatutory references in the former rule that are no longer up-to-date have been revised. Finally, 
reconciling the provisions of Rule 509 with the parts of Tex. Occ. Code ch. 159 that address a 
physician-patient privilege applicable to court proceedings is beyond the scope of the restyling 
project.

personal affairs; or 

D) 

the personal representative of a deceased patient. 

A communication is “confidential” if not intended to be disclosed to third persons

evaluation, or treatment;  

B)

person from disclosing: 

(A) 

a confidential communication between the patient and a professional; and 

a record of the patient’s identity, diagnosis, evaluation, or treatment that is 
created or maintained by a professional. 

In  a  civil  case,  any  person—other  than  a  patient’s  representative  acting  on  the 
patient’s behalf—who receives information privileged under this rule may disclose

patient  made  to  a  professional  during  a  court-ordered  examination  relating  to  the 
patient’s mental or emotional condition or disorder if:

omment to 2015 Restyling: The mental-health-information privilege in civil cases was enacted 
in Texas in 1979. Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 5561h (later codified at Tex. Health & Safety Code § 
611.001  et  seq.)  provided  that  the  privilege  applied  even  if  the  patient  had  received  the 
professional’s  services  before  the  statute’s  enactment.  Because  more  than  thirty  years  have  now 
passed,  it  is  no  longer  necessary  to  burden  the  text  of  the  rule  with  a  statement  regarding  the 
privilege’s retroactive application. But deleting this statement from the rule’s text is not intended as 
a substantive change in the law. 

ex. Health & Safety Code ch. 611 addresses confidentiality rules for communications between a 
patient  and  a  mental-health  professional  and  for  the  professional’s  treatment  records.  Many  of 
these provisions apply in contexts other than court proceedings. Reconciling the provisions of Rule 
510 with the parts of chapter 611 that address a mental-health-information privilege applicable to 
court proceedings is beyond the scope of the restyling project.

General Rule. 

(a) 
 

A  person  upon  whom  these  rules  confer  a  privilege  against  disclosure  waives  the 
privilege if: 

the person or a predecessor of the person while holder of the privilege voluntarily 
discloses or consents to disclosure of any significant part of the privileged matter 
unless such disclosure itself is privileged; or 

the  person  or  a  representative  of  the  person  calls  a  person  to  whom  privileged 
communications  have  been  made  to  testify  as  to  the  person’s  character  or 
character  trait  insofar  as  such  communications  are  relevant  to  such  character  or 
character trait. 

 
Lawyer-Client Privilege and Work Product; Limitations on Waiver. 

Notwithstanding  paragraph  (a), 
the 
circumstances  set  out,  to  disclosure  of  a  communication  or  information  covered 
by the lawyer-client privilege or work-product protection. 

the  following  provisions  apply, 

in 

Disclosure  Made  in  a  Federal  or  State  Proceeding  or  to  a  Federal  or 
State Office or Agency; Scope of a Waiver. When the disclosure is made 
in  a  federal  proceeding  or  state  proceeding  of  any  state  or  to  a  federal 
office  or  agency  or  state  office  or  agency  of  any  state  and  waives  the 
lawyer-client privilege or  work-product protection, the waiver extends to 
an undisclosed communication or information only if: 

the waiver is intentional; 

 

 

the  disclosed  and  undisclosed  communications  or 
information concern the same subject matter; and 

  

they ought in fairness to be considered together. 

Inadvertent Disclosure in State Civil Proceedings. When made in a Texas 
state proceeding, an inadvertent disclosure does not operate as a waiver if 
the holder followed the procedures of Rule of Civil Procedure 193.3(d).  

Controlling  Effect  of  a  Court  Order.  A  disclosure  made  in  litigation 
pending before a federal court or a state court of any state that has entered 
an  order  that  the  privilege  or  protection  is  not  waived  by  disclosure 
connected with the litigation pending before that court is also not a waiver 
in a Texas state proceeding.

Controlling Effect of a Party Agreement. An agreement on the effect of 
disclosure in a state proceeding of any state is binding only on the parties 
to the agreement, unless it is incorporated into a court order. 

(4) 

  

Comment to 2015 Restyling: The amendments to Rule 511 are designed to align Texas law with 
federal law on waiver of privilege by voluntary disclosure. Subsection (a) sets forth the general 
rule.  Subsection  (b)  incorporates  the  provisions  of  Federal  Rule  of  Evidence  502.  Like  the 
federal rule, subsection (b) only addresses disclosure of communications or information covered 
by the lawyer-client privilege or work-product protection. These amendments do not affect the 
law governing waiver of other privileges or protections. 

ule 512. 

Privileged Matter Disclosed Under Compulsion or Without Opportunity to 
Claim Privilege 

 privilege claim is not defeated by a disclosure that was: 

a)  

compelled erroneously; or  

b)   made without opportunity to claim the privilege. 

Rule 513. 

Comment On or Inference From a Privilege Claim; Instruction 

Comment or Inference Not Permitted. Except as permitted in Rule 504(b)(2), neither the 
court  nor  counsel  may  comment  on  a  privilege  claim—whether  made  in  the  present 
proceeding or previously—and the factfinder may not draw an inference from the claim. 

Claiming Privilege Without the Jury’s Knowledge. To the extent practicable, the court 
must conduct a jury trial so that the making of a privilege claim is not suggested to the jury 
by any means.  

Claim of Privilege Against Self-Incrimination in a Civil Case. Subdivisions (a) and (b) 
do  not  apply  to  a  party’s  claim,  in  the  present  civil  case,  of  the  privilege  against 
self-incrimination. 

Jury Instruction. When this rule forbids a jury from drawing an inference from a privilege 
claim,  the  court  must,  on  request  of  a  party  against  whom  the  jury  might  draw  the 
inference, instruct the jury accordingly.

(a) 

In  General.  Every  person  is  competent  to  be  a  witness  unless  these  rules  provide 
otherwise. The following witnesses are incompetent: 

Insane  Persons.  A  person  who  is  now  insane  or  was  insane  at  the  time  of  the 
events about which the person is called to testify. 

Persons  Lacking  Sufficient  Intellect.  A  child—or  any  other  person—whom  the 
court examines and finds lacks sufficient intellect to testify concerning the matters 
in issue. 

b) 

The “Dead Man’s Rule.”   

Applicability. The “Dead Man’s Rule” applies only in a civil case: 

by or against a party in the party’s capacity as an executor, administrator, or 
guardian; or 

by or against a decedent’s heirs or legal representatives and based in whole 
or in part on the decedent’s oral statement. 

General Rule. In cases described in subparagraph (b)(1)(A), a party may not testify 
against another party about an oral statement by the testator, intestate, or ward. In 
cases described in subparagraph (b)(1)(B), a party may not testify against another 
party about an oral statement by the decedent. 

3)  

Exceptions.  A  party  may  testify  against  another  party  about  an  oral  statement  by 
the testator, intestate, ward, or decedent if: 

(A) 

the party’s testimony about the statement is corroborated; or 

the opposing party calls the party to testify at the trial about the statement. 

4) 

Instructions.  If  a  court  excludes  evidence  under  paragraph  (b)(2),  the  court  must 
instruct  the  jury  that  the  law  prohibits  a  party  from  testifying  about  an  oral 
statement  by  the  testator,  intestate,  ward,  or  decedent  unless  the  oral  statement  is 
corroborated  or  the  opposing  party  calls  the  party  to  testify  at  the  trial  about  the 
statement.

  C

omment to 2015 Restyling: The text of the “Dead Man’s Rule” has been streamlined to clarify 
its meaning without making any substantive changes. The text of former Rule 601(b) (as well as 
its  statutory  predecessor,  Vernon’s  Ann.  Civ.  St.  art.  3716)  prohibits  only  a  “party”  from 
testifying about the dead man’s statements. Despite this, the last sentence of former Rule 601(b) 
requires  the  court  to  instruct  the  jury  when  the  rule  “prohibits  an  interested  party  or  witness” 
from testifying. Because the rule prohibits only a “party” from testifying, restyled Rule 601(b)(4) 
references  only  “a  party,”  and  not  “an  interested  party  or  witness.”  To  be  sure,  courts  have 
indicated  that  the  rule  (or  its  statutory  predecessor)  may  be  applicable  to  a  witness  who  is  not 

Tex. Sup. Ct Misc. Dkt. No. 15-9048 

 

Page 33
 

 

Ct. Crim. App. Misc. Dkt. No. 15-001 

 

nominally  a  party  and  inapplicable  to  a  witness  who  is  only  nominally  a  party.  See,  e.g., 
Chandler  v.  Welborn,  156  Tex.  312,  294  S.W.2d  801,  809  (1956);  Ragsdale  v.  Ragsdale,  142 
Tex. 476, 179 S.W.2d 291, 295 (1944).  But these decisions are based on an interpretation of the 
meaning of “party.” Therefore, limiting the court’s instruction under restyled Rule 601(b)(4) to 
“a party” does not change Texas practice. In addition, restyled Rule 601(b) deletes the sentence 
in  former  Rule  601(b)  that  states  “[e]xcept  for  the  foregoing,  a  witness  is  not  precluded  from 
giving evidence . . . because the witness is a party to the action . . .” This sentence is surplusage. 
Rule  601(b)  is  a  rule  of  exclusion.  If  the  testimony  falls  outside  the  rule  of  exclusion,  its 
admissibility will be determined by other applicable rules of evidence. 

 

ule 602.  

Need for Personal Knowledge  

 witness may testify to a matter only if evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding 
that  the  witness  has  personal  knowledge  of  the  matter.  Evidence  to  prove  personal  knowledge 
may  consist  of  the  witness’s  own  testimony.  This  rule  does  not  apply  to  a  witness’s  expert 
testimony under Rule 703.  

ule 603.   Oath or Affirmation to Testify Truthfully  

efore testifying, a witness must give an oath or affirmation to testify truthfully. It must be in a 

form designed to impress that duty on the witness’s conscience.  

ule 604.  

Interpreter  

n interpreter must be qualified and must give an oath or affirmation to make a true translation.  

ule 605.  

Judge’s Competency as a Witness  

he presiding judge may not testify as a witness at the trial. A party need not object to preserve 

the issue.  

ule 606.  

Juror’s Competency as a Witness  

a) 

At the Trial. A juror may not testify as a witness before the other jurors at the trial. If a 
juror is called to testify, the court must give a party an opportunity to object outside the 
jury’s presence.  

b) 

During an Inquiry into the Validity of a Verdict or Indictment.

that occurred during the jury’s deliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s 
or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s mental processes concerning the verdict or

statement on these matters.  

Exceptions. A juror may testify:

(A) 

about whether an outside influence was improperly brought to bear on any 
juror; or  

B) 

to rebut a claim that the juror was not qualified to serve.  

Rule 607.   Who May Impeach a Witness  

  (

ny party, including the party that called the witness, may attack the witness’s credibility.  

ule 608.  

A Witness’s Character for Truthfulness or Untruthfulness  

Reputation or Opinion Evidence. A witness’s credibility may be attacked or supported 
by  testimony  about  the  witness’s  reputation  for  having  a  character  for  truthfulness  or 
untruthfulness,  or  by  testimony  in  the  form  of  an  opinion  about  that  character.  But 
evidence  of  truthful  character  is  admissible  only  after  the  witness’s  character  for 
truthfulness has been attacked.  

Specific Instances of Conduct. Except for a criminal conviction under Rule 609, a party 
may  not  inquire  into  or  offer  extrinsic  evidence  to  prove  specific  instances  of  the 
witness’s conduct in order to attack or support the witness’s character for truthfulness. 

In General. Evidence of a criminal conviction offered to attack a witness’s character for 
truthfulness must be admitted if: 

the crime was a felony or involved moral turpitude, regardless of punishment; 

the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to a party; and 

it is elicited from the witness or established by public record.

Limit on Using the Evidence After 10 Years. This subdivision (b) applies if more than 
10  years  have  passed  since  the  witness’s  conviction  or  release  from  confinement  for  it, 
whichever  is  later.  Evidence  of  the  conviction  is  admissible  only  if  its  probative  value, 
supported  by  specific  facts  and  circumstances,  substantially  outweighs  its  prejudicial 
effect.

Effect  of  a  Pardon,  Annulment,  or  Certificate  of  Rehabilitation.  Evidence  of  a 
conviction is not admissible if:  

the  conviction  has  been  the  subject  of  a  pardon,  annulment,  certificate  of 
rehabilitation, or other equivalent procedure based on a finding that the person has 
been rehabilitated, and the person has not been convicted of a later crime that was 
classified as a felony or involved moral turpitude, regardless of punishment;  

probation has been satisfactorily completed for the conviction, and the person has 
not  been  convicted  of  a  later  crime  that  was  classified  as  a  felony  or  involved 
moral turpitude, regardless of punishment; or  
the  conviction  has  been  the  subject  of  a  pardon,  annulment,  or  other  equivalent 
procedure based on a finding of innocence. 

d) 

Juvenile Adjudications. Evidence of a juvenile adjudication is admissible under this rule 
only if:  

the witness is a party in a proceeding conducted under title 3 of the Texas Family 
Code; or  

the United States or Texas Constitution requires that it be admitted. 

Pendency of an Appeal. A conviction for which an appeal is pending is not admissible 
under this rule.  

Notice.  Evidence  of  a  witness’s  conviction  is  not  admissible  under  this  rule  if,  after 
receiving  from  the  adverse  party  a  timely  written  request  specifying  the  witness,  the 
proponent of the conviction fails to provide sufficient written notice of intent to use the 
conviction. Notice is sufficient if it provides a fair opportunity to contest the use of such 
evidence.

Scope of Cross-Examination. A witness may be cross-examined on any relevant matter, 
including credibility. 

Leading Questions. Leading questions should not be used on direct examination except 
as  necessary  to  develop  the  witness’s  testimony.  Ordinarily,  the  court  should  allow 
leading questions:

when a party calls a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with 
an adverse party.

to have those options; or

Adverse Party’s Options; Deleting Unrelated Matter. An adverse party is entitled to 
have the writing produced at the hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the witness about 
it, and to introduce in evidence any portion that relates to the witness’s testimony. If the 
producing party claims that the writing includes unrelated matter, the court must examine 
the writing in camera, delete any unrelated portion, and order that the rest be delivered to 
the adverse party. Any portion deleted over objection must be preserved for the record.  

Failure  to  Produce  or  Deliver  the  Writing.  If  a  writing  is  not  produced  or  is  not 
delivered  as  ordered,  the  court  may  issue  any  appropriate  order.  But  if  the  prosecution 
does not comply in a criminal case, the court must strike the witness’s testimony or—if 
justice so requires—declare a mistrial.

(2)   Need Not Show Written Statement. If the witness’s prior inconsistent statement is 
written, a party need not show it to the witness before inquiring about it, but must, 
upon request, show it to opposing counsel. 

(3)   Opportunity  to  Explain  or  Deny.  A  witness  must  be  given  the  opportunity  to 

explain or deny the prior inconsistent statement. 

Extrinsic Evidence. Extrinsic evidence of a witness’s prior inconsistent statement is 
not admissible unless the witness is first examined about the statement and fails to 
unequivocally admit making the statement. 

Opposing Party’s Statement. This subdivision (a) does not apply to an opposing 
party’s statement under Rule 801(e)(2). 

b)  Witness’s Bias or Interest. 

Foundation Requirement. When examining a witness about the witness’s bias or 
interest, a party must first tell the witness the circumstances or statements that tend 
to show the witness’s bias or interest. If examining a witness about a statement—
whether oral or written—to prove the witness’s bias or interest, a party must tell the 
witness: 

(A) 

the contents of the statement; 

B) 

the time and place of the statement; and 

C) 

the person to whom the statement was made. 

2)   Need Not Show Written Statement. If a party uses a written statement to prove the 
witness’s bias or interest, a party need not show the statement to the witness before 
inquiring about it, but must, upon request, show it to opposing counsel. 

3)   Opportunity  to  Explain  or  Deny.  A  witness  must  be  given  the  opportunity  to 
explain or deny the circumstances or statements that tend to show the witness’s bias 
or interest. And the witness’s proponent may present evidence to rebut the charge 
of bias or interest. 

4) 

Extrinsic  Evidence.  Extrinsic  evidence  of  a  witness’s  bias  or  interest  is  not 
admissible unless the witness is first examined about the bias or interest and fails to 
unequivocally admit it.

(c)  Witness’s  Prior  Consistent  Statement.  Unless  Rule  801(e)(1)(B)  provides  otherwise,  a 
witness’s  prior  consistent  statement  is  not  admissible  if  offered  solely  to  enhance  the 
witness’s credibility. 

omment to 2015 Restyling: The amended rule retains the requirement that a witness be given 
an opportunity to explain or deny (a) a prior inconsistent statement or (b) the circumstances or a 
statement  showing  the  witness’s  bias  or  interest,  but  this  requirement  is  not  imposed  on  the 
examining  attorney.  A  witness  may  have  to  wait  until  redirect  examination  to  explain  a  prior 
inconsistent statement or the circumstances or a statement that shows bias. But the impeaching 
attorney still is not permitted to introduce extrinsic evidence of the witness’s prior inconsistent 
statement or bias unless the witness has first been examined about the statement or bias and has 
failed to unequivocally admit it. All other changes to the rule are intended to be stylistic only. 

ule 614.  

Excluding Witnesses  

t  a  party’s  request,  the  court  must  order  witnesses  excluded  so  that  they  cannot  hear  other 
witnesses’  testimony.  Or  the  court  may  do  so  on  its  own.  But  this  rule  does  not  authorize 
excluding:  

a) 

a party who is a natural person and, in civil cases, that person’s spouse;  

b)  

after being designated as the party’s representative by its attorney: 

in a civil case, an officer or employee of a party that is not a natural person; or 

in a criminal case, a defendant that is not a natural person;  

 
a person whose presence a party shows to be essential to presenting the party’s claim or 
defense; or  

the victim in a criminal case, unless the court determines that the victim’s testimony would 
be materially affected by hearing other testimony at the trial.

examination, the court, on motion of a party who did not call the witness, must order an 
attorney  for  the  state  or  the  defendant  and  the  defendant’s  attorney  to  produce,  for  the 
examination  and  use  of  the  moving  party,  any  statement  of  the  witness  that  is  in  their 
possession and that relates to the subject matter of the witness’s testimony.

Producing the Entire Statement. If the entire statement relates to the subject matter of 
the  witness’s  testimony,  the  court  must  order  that  the  statement  be  delivered  to  the 
moving party. 

Producing  a  Redacted  Statement.  If  the  party  who  called  the  witness  claims  that  the 
statement contains information that does not relate to the subject matter of the witness’s 
testimony,  the  court  must inspect the statement in camera. After excising  any unrelated 
portions, the court must order delivery of the redacted statement to the moving party. If a 
party objects to an excision, the court must preserve the entire statement with the excised 
portion indicated, under seal, as part of the record. 

Recess to Examine a Statement. On the moving party’s request, the court must recess 
the proceedings to allow time for a party to examine the statement and prepare for its use. 

Sanction  for  Failure  to  Produce  or  Deliver  a  Statement.  If  the  party  who  called  the 
witness  disobeys  an  order  to  produce  or  deliver  a  statement,  the  court  must  strike  the 
witness’s  testimony  from  the  record.  If  an  attorney  for  the  state  disobeys  the  order,  the 
court must declare a mistrial if justice so requires. 

a  written  statement  that  the  witness  makes  and  signs,  or  otherwise  adopts  or 
approves; 

a substantially verbatim, contemporaneously recorded recital of the witness’s oral 
statement that is contained in any recording or any transcription of a recording; or

ule 703.  

Bases of an Expert’s Opinion Testimony  

n expert may base an opinion on facts or data in the case that the expert has been made aware 
of, reviewed, or personally observed. If experts in the particular field would reasonably rely on 
those kinds of facts or data in forming an opinion on the subject, they need not be admissible for 
the opinion to be admitted. 

omment  to  2015  Restyling:  All  references  to  an  “inference”  have  been  deleted  because  this 
makes  the  Rule  flow  better  and  easier  to  read,  and  because  any  “inference”  is  covered  by  the 
broader  term  “opinion.”  Courts  have  not  made  substantive  decisions  on  the  basis  of  any

without first testifying to the underlying facts or data. But the expert may be required to 
disclose those facts or data on cross-examination. 

Voir Dire Examination of an Expert About the Underlying Facts or Data. Before an 
expert states an opinion or discloses the underlying facts or data, an adverse party in a civil 
case  may—or  in  a  criminal  case  must—be  permitted  to  examine  the  expert  about  the 
underlying facts or data. This examination must take place outside the jury’s hearing.

helping the jury evaluate the opinion is outweighed by their prejudicial effect. If the court

Statements That Are Not Hearsay. A statement that meets the following conditions is 
not hearsay:  

A Declarant-Witness’s Prior Statement. The declarant testifies and is subject to 
cross-examination about a prior statement, and the statement:  

when offered in a civil case, was given under penalty of perjury at 
a trial, hearing, or other proceeding or in a deposition; or 

when  offered  in  a  criminal  case,  was  given  under  penalty  of 
perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding—except a grand jury 
proceeding—or in a deposition;

is inconsistent with the declarant’s testimony and: 

B) 

is  consistent  with  the  declarant’s  testimony  and  is  offered  to  rebut  an 
express or implied charge that the declarant recently fabricated it or acted 
from a recent improper influence or motive in so testifying; or 

C) 

identifies a person as someone the declarant perceived earlier. 

An  Opposing  Party’s  Statement.  The  statement  is  offered  against  an  opposing 
party and:  

(A)  was made by the party in an individual or representative capacity;  

B) 

is one the party manifested that it adopted or believed to be true;  

C)  was made by a person whom the party authorized to make a statement on 

the subject;  

conspiracy. 

D)  was made by the party’s agent or employee on a matter within the scope of 

that relationship and while it existed; or 

E)  was  made  by  the  party’s  coconspirator  during  and  in  furtherance  of  the 

A  Deponent’s  Statement.  In  a  civil  case,  the  statement  was  made  in  a  deposition 
taken  in  the  same  proceeding.  “Same  proceeding”  is  defined  in  Rule  of  Civil 
Procedure 203.6(b). The deponent’s unavailability as a witness is not a requirement 
for admissibility.

Comment to 2015 Restyling: Statements falling under the hearsay exclusion provided by Rule 
801(e)(2)  are  no  longer  referred  to  as  “admissions”  in  the  title  to  the  subdivision.  The  term 
“admissions” is confusing because not all statements covered by the exclusion are admissions in 

Tex. Sup. Ct Misc. Dkt. No. 15-9048 

 

Page 43
 

 

Ct. Crim. App. Misc. Dkt. No. 15-001 

 

the colloquial sense—a statement can be within the exclusion even if it “admitted” nothing and 
was not against the party’s interest when made. The term “admissions” also raises confusion in 
comparison  with  the  Rule  803(24)  exception  for  declarations  against  interest.  No  change  in 
application of the exclusion is intended. 

he  deletion  of  former  Rule  801(e)(1)(D), which cross-references Code of Criminal  Procedure 
art.  38.071,  is  not  intended  as  a  substantive  change.  Including  this  cross-reference  made  sense 
when the Texas Rules of Criminal Evidence were first promulgated, but with subsequent changes 
to the statutory provision, its inclusion is no longer appropriate. The version of article 38.071 that 
was initially cross-referenced in the Rules of Criminal Evidence required the declarant-victim to 
be available to testify at the trial. That requirement has since been deleted from the statute, and 
the statute no longer requires either the availability or testimony of the declarant-victim. Thus, 
cross-referencing the statute in Rule 801(e)(1), which applies only when the declarant testifies at 
trial about the prior statement, no longer makes sense. Moreover, article 38.071 is but one of a 
number  of  statutes  that  mandate  the  admission  of  certain  hearsay  statements  in  particular 
circumstances.  See,  e.g.,  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  art.  38.072;  Family  Code  §§  54.031, 
104.002,  104.006.  These  statutory  provisions  take  precedence  over  the  general  rule  excluding 
hearsay,  see  Rules  101(c)  and  802,  and  there  is  no  apparent  justification  for  cross-referencing 
article 38.071 and not all other such provisions.  

nadmissible  hearsay  admitted  without  objection  may  not  be  denied  probative  value  merely 
because it is hearsay. 

Present  Sense  Impression.  A  statement  describing  or  explaining  an  event  or 
condition, made while or immediately after the declarant perceived it.  

Excited  Utterance.  A  statement  relating  to  a  startling  event  or  condition,  made 
while the declarant was under the stress of excitement that it caused.

hen a hearsay statement—or a statement described in Rule 801(e)(2)(C), (D), or (E), or, in a 
civil  case,  a  statement  described  in  Rule  801(e)(3)—has  been  admitted  in  evidence,  the

admissible  for  those  purposes  if  the  declarant  had  testified  as  a  witness.  The  court  may  admit 
evidence of the declarant’s statement or conduct, offered to impeach the declarant, regardless of 
when it occurred or whether the declarant had an opportunity to explain or deny it. If the party 
against whom the statement was admitted calls the declarant as a witness, the party may examine 
the declarant on the statement as if on cross-examination.

c) 

an original is not located in Texas; 

d) 

the party against whom the original would be offered had control of the original; was at 
that time put on notice, by pleadings or otherwise, that the original would be a subject of 
proof at the trial or hearing; and fails to produce it at the trial or hearing; or  

e) 

the writing, recording, or photograph is not closely related to a controlling issue.  

ule 1005.   Copies of Public Records to Prove Content  

he proponent may use a copy to prove the content of an official record—or of a document that 
was  recorded  or  filed  in  a  public  office  as  authorized  by  law—if  these  conditions  are  met:  the 
record  or  document  is  otherwise  admissible;  and  the  copy  is  certified  as  correct  in  accordance 
with Rule 902(4) or is testified to be correct by a witness who has compared it with the original. 
If  no  such  copy  can  be  obtained  by  reasonable  diligence,  then  the  proponent  may  use  other 
evidence to prove the content.  

ule 1006.   Summaries to Prove Content  

he  proponent  may  use  a  summary,  chart,  or  calculation  to  prove  the  content  of  voluminous 
writings,  recordings,  or  photographs  that  cannot  be  conveniently  examined  in  court.  The 
proponent must make the originals or duplicates available for examination or copying, or both, 
by  other  parties  at  a  reasonable  time  and  place.  And  the  court  may  order  the  proponent  to 
produce them in court.  

ule 1007.   Testimony or Statement of a Party to Prove Content  

he proponent  may prove  the  content  of a writing, recording, or photograph by  the  testimony, 
deposition,  or  written  statement  of  the  party  against  whom  the  evidence  is  offered.  The 
proponent need not account for the original.  

ule 1008.   Functions of the Court and Jury  

rdinarily, the court determines whether the proponent has fulfilled the factual conditions for 
admitting other evidence of the content of a writing, recording, or photograph under Rule 1004 
or 1005. But in a jury trial, the jury determines—in accordance with Rule 104(b)—any issue 
about whether:  

a) 

an asserted writing, recording, or photograph ever existed;  

b) 

another one produced at the trial or hearing is the original; or

Submitting a Translation. A translation of a foreign language document is admissible if, 
at least 45 days before trial, the proponent serves on all parties: 

the translation and the underlying foreign language document; and 

a  qualified  translator’s  affidavit  or  unsworn  declaration  that  sets  forth  the 
translator’s qualifications and certifies that the translation is accurate.   

b)  Objection. When objecting to a translation’s accuracy, a party should specifically indicate 
its inaccuracies and offer an accurate translation. A party must serve the objection on all 
parties at least 15 days before trial.  

Effect  of  Failing  to  Object  or  Submit  a  Conflicting  Translation.  If  the  underlying 
foreign  language  document  is  otherwise  admissible,  the  court  must  admit—and  may  not 
allow a party to attack the accuracy of—a translation submitted under subdivision (a) unless 
the party has: 

submitted a conflicting translation under subdivision (a); or 

objected to the translation under subdivision (b). 

Effect of Objecting or Submitting a Conflicting Translation. If conflicting translations 
are submitted under subdivision (a) or an objection is made under subdivision (b), the court 
must determine whether there is a genuine issue about the accuracy of a material part of the 
translation. If so, the trier of fact must resolve the issue. 

Qualified Translator May Testify. Except for subdivision (c), this rule does not preclude 
a party from offering the testimony of a qualified translator to translate a foreign language 
document.  

Time Limits. On a party’s motion and for good cause, the court may alter this rule’s time 
limits.  

Court-Appointed Translator. If necessary, the court may appoint a qualified translator. 
The reasonable value of the translator’s services must be taxed as court costs.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
