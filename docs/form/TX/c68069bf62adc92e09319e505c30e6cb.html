n 2004, the Appellate Section of the State Bar of Texas and the Second Court of Appeals worked together to identify key information 
needed by appellate attorneys and pro se litigants to practice effectively before the court. To assist the court in this effort, the Appellate 
Section collected and formatted the relevant information and  first published it  in the Appellate Advocate in February 2005.  This information 
was most recently updated in January 2022, and the court intends to keep the information current for the use of persons with matters before the court.

SPECIAL NOTES 

The court prefers that the first page 
of any e-filed document be numbered 
page 1, and that all subsequent page 
numbers are sequential, so that the 
page numbers on the document 
correspond with the page numbers 
shown in the pdf reader software 
used by the court to view electronic 
documents. 

ecause of the inherent delay in a 
document’s being uploaded to an 
electronic service provider and 
that document’s being reviewed 
and accepted by the clerk’s office 
for filing, the court strongly 
encourages parties requesting 
emergency relief to call the clerk’s 
office before or immediately after 
filing a document requiring 
emergency action so that the 
document may be processed and 
circulated to the court 
expeditiously. 
All motions are considered and 
decided any day of the week. Rulings 
on motions for rehearing are 
announced on Thursdays.

COURT’S PARTICULAR 
PRACTICES 
 

The Ins and Outs 

Effective January 1, 2014, 
attorneys in civil and criminal 
cases must e-file all documents 
(except a document under seal or 
subject to a motion to seal) 
through the electronic filing 
system at www.efiletexas.gov. 
Tex. R. App. P. 9.2 (c)(1), (3). 

ersons who are not represented 

by an attorney may, but are not 
required to, e-file documents. 
Tex. R. App. P. 9.2(c) (1). 

aper copies of documents that 

must be e-filed will not be 
accepted except in an emergency 
with the court’s permission Tex. 
R. App. 9.2(c)(1), (3). 

All documents in appeals or original 
proceedings, including appendices, 
must be redacted in accordance with 
Tex. R. App. P. 9.8-.10. 
Redaction pointers for e-filed 
documents are available at the 
Supreme Court’s website.  It is the 
parties’ responsibility, not the court’s, 
to ensure that documents filed with 
the court are properly redacted. 
Nevertheless, the court may require a 
document to be corrected and 
resubmitted if, upon screening, a clerk 
discovers unredacted sensitive data, as 
defined in the rules of appellate 
procedure and guidelines posted on 
the court’s website.  See also Tex. 
Fam. Code Ann. §§56.01(j), 109.002(d); 
L.R.7. 

  A

Agreed motions are submitted 
when filed. Contested motions 
(other than motions for extension 
or emergency motions) are held 
for 10 days before submission to 
the court.  See Tex. R. App. P. 
10.3(a). 

oth presubmission motion 

panels and appeal panels are set in 
the spring/summer for the 
following fiscal year. Motion 
panels change every 6 weeks 
except for late June through 
August, when they change weekly; 
the administrative justice changes 
on a rotating basis every 6 weeks 
from September through late June 
and weekly thereafter through the 
end of August. 

  B

Motions filed before a panel is assigned 
and that may be decided by a single justice 
are decided by the administrative justice. 
If the administrative justice requests that a 
panel be assigned to a particular motion, 
the motion will be submitted to that 
panel. After a panel is assigned to a case, 
motions are submitted to the panel or 
head of panel, depending on the nature of 
the motion.  See Tex. R. App. 10.4(a). 

irst motions for extension of time to file 
briefs requesting 30 days or less—20 days 
or less in accelerated appeals (except

certification cases)—are generally 
handled by the clerks and are granted

the court and are disfavored without a 
reasonable explanation of the need for 
additional time. 

arental termination, child protection, 

and juvenile certification appeals are 
assigned an author and panel when 
the notice of appeal is received, so the

Motions to extend may be granted 
upon a reasonable explanation of need 
but in shorter increments, in light of

for disposition in such cases. Tex. R.

PROCEDURE  WHAT AND HOW TO FILE 

HOW HANDLED 

SPECIAL NOTES 

Record 

The court notifies the parties, 
clerks, and reporters of the due 
date in accordance with Tex. R. 
App. P. 35. 

Motions to extend are filed by 
clerks and reporters directly with 
the court. 

COURT’S PARTICULAR 
PRACTICES 

All motions to extend in 
parental termination, child 
protection, and juvenile 
certification appeals are 
submitted to the author.  

Except in parental termination and 
child protection cases as defined in 
Tex. R. App. P. 28.4(a)(2) and 
juvenile certification appeals, first 
motions to extend for 30 days or 
less—10 days or less in accelerated 
cases—are generally handled by the 
clerks. First motions asking for more 
than 30 or 10 days, as well as 
subsequent motions to extend, are 
submitted to the administrative justice 
unless a panel has been assigned; in 
that case, the motion will be submitted 
to the justice who is head of panel.  

 

Under Tex. R. App. P. 35.3(c), each 
extension granted may not exceed 30 
days in regular appeals and 10 days in 
accelerated appeals.  

The court receives the majority of clerk’s 
and reporters records via e-filing, with 
two exceptions: (1) when the court 
requests that a sealed record be paper 
filed and (2) when the court grants an 
exceptional request by a clerk or reporter 
to file all or part of the appellate record 
via paper or other physical media. 

In parental termination and child 
protection cases, extensions may not 
exceed 30 days total and may not be 
granted in all appeals.  Tex. R. App. 
P. 28.4(b)(2). 

 

4 

Under Tex. R. App. P. 9.8–.10, a 
child may be identified only by initials 
or pseudonym in a brief or original 
proceeding petition; documents in 
the brief or petition AND any 
appendices (text, headers, and 
footers inclusive) must be 
redacted to protect the child’s 
identity. 

he court requires that references to 

parents and other persons from 
whose names a child may be 
identified (e.g., relatives or foster 
parents) also use initials or 
pseudonyms. L.R. 7. 

lthough it is the filer’s 

responsibility, not the court’s, to 
ensure that documents filed with the 
court are properly redacted, the court 
will require a filing to be corrected 
and resubmitted if, upon screening, a 
clerk discovers unredacted sensitive 
data anywhere in the filing (including 
text, headers, titles, footnotes, and 
the appendix). Tex. R. App. P. 9.9–
.10. 

  T

  A

Unless requested by the 
court, all amended, 
supplemental, post-
submission, and letter briefs 
must be accompanied by a 
motion for leave to file. L.R. 
1.B. 

ross-Appeals: Unless 
otherwise notified by the 
court, cross-appellants must 
file their cross-appellants’ 
brief on the due date for the 
appellants’ brief unless the 
court permits otherwise. 

  C

riginal Proceedings: Generally, the court 

sets a 10-day deadline if it requests a 
response and a 5-day deadline for any 
reply. Sometimes circumstances warrant a 
shorter or longer deadline. 

  O

Appeals: The court uses the filing 
deadlines in Tex. R. App. P. 38.6(a)–(c), 
but those dates are not set until the 
complete record is filed. The parties are 
notified by letter of the filing dates. L.R. 
1.D. 

f a party wishes to provide the 
court with courtesy copies of 
briefs, the court requests that the 
party provide 3 copies including 
appendices, no later than 10 
business days before the 
scheduled submission date. 

omputer-generated briefs must 

include the word count 
certification required by Tex. R. 
App. P. 9.4(a)(3). 

ecause the court does not 
subscribe to Lexis, the court 
prefers that any citations and 
hyperlinking to authorities be to 
Westlaw. Items in the brief may 
be hyperlinked so long as they 
otherwise comply with the rules 
of appellate procedure and this 
court’s local rules. 

tems in appendices must be 
redacted in accordance with Tex. 
R. App. P. 9.8–.10. The court will 
consider an improperly redacted 
appendix noncompliant and will 
require the brief to be 
resubmitted. 

tems that are most helpful in an 
appendix include legislative 
history, any case with only a 
Lexis citation, and foreign law, if 
applicable.

Appeals: Generally, a panel is assigned 
when the appellee’s brief is filed. 
Occasionally, an appeal that includes the 
same or similar issues as a prior appeal or 
original proceeding in the case will be 
assigned to the same panel, but not 
necessarily the same author, as the prior 
appeal or original proceeding.

proceedings, accelerated appeals, 
juvenile certification appeals, and

COURT’S PARTICULAR 
PRACTICES 

Appeals: Requests for oral 
argument are not automatically 
honored. In certain categories of 
cases, requests are screened by 
the assigned author’s staff 
attorney, who makes a 
recommendation regarding oral 
argument. The assigned author 
then decides whether to grant 
oral argument.  The factors 
considered in determining 
whether to grant oral argument 
include whether the decisional 
process would be significantly 
aided by argument.  Tex. R. App. 
P. 39.1. 

f an appeal is ordered submitted 
without argument, the court will 
consider an objection by a party 
requesting argument in its 
discretion. There is no filing fee 
for an objection to the denial of 
oral argument.

The court generally releases its 
opinions on Thursdays. 
Opinions in original 
proceedings, parental 
termination/child protection 
cases, and juvenile certification 
appeals are handed down on 
any day. The proposed opinion 
(including concurrences and 
dissents) is circulated to the 
panel first and then to the entire 
court.  

   

COURT’S PARTICULAR 
PRACTICES 
Except during July and August, 
the court has a pre-set weekly 
submission docket that includes 
cases submitted both orally and 
on briefs. 

or most appeals, the author is 
assigned approximately 21 days 
before submission. In original 
proceedings, permissive appeals, 
mental health appeals, parental 
termination and child protection 
appeals, juvenile certification 
appeals, and appeals from the 
denial of pretrial applications for 
writ of habeas corpus in criminal 
cases, the author is assigned 
when the proceeding is filed.  

  F

Author is chosen on a rotation 
cycle by the clerk’s office. 

Typically, voting occurs immediately 
after oral argument for cases 
submitted with argument and for most 
non-oral argument cases submitted 
that same day. In some non-oral 
argument cases, the panel votes after 
reading the briefs. 
Internal guidelines recommend that 
the author circulate an initial draft to 
panel members no later than 6 months 
after submission. The guidelines 
suggest that each panel member has 14 
days to sign off on the draft, request a 
panel conference, or note that he or 
she intends to draft a concurrence or 
dissent. The panel member then has 
60 days to circulate the draft of a 
concurrence or dissent. Additional 
time is allowed for subsequent opinion 
drafts. 

he court endeavors to circulate 

opinions, including concurrences and 
dissents, in accelerated appeals and 
original proceedings on a shorter 
timetable. 

arental termination, child protection, 

and juvenile certification appeals 
should be issued within 180 days of 
the filing of the notice of appeal so far 
as reasonably possible; therefore, the 
internal guidelines for circulation of 
opinions in those types of cases are 
greatly reduced. Tex. R. Jud. Admin.

within 15 days after the court of appeals’ judgment 
or order is rendered. Tex. R. App. P. 49.5. 

 I

Once filed, an original proceeding is immediately 
assigned a panel and author, and a court staff 
attorney prepares a recommendation to the panel. 
All justices on the panel are immediately provided 
copies of the petition after it is processed by the 
clerks. 
f a motion requesting emergency relief is also 
filed, it is circulated immediately and dealt with 
ASAP. If there is no motion for emergency relief, 
the original proceeding is addressed as soon as 
possible within the normal course of business. 

 I

ecause of the inherent delay in a document’s 

being uploaded to an electronic service 
provider and that document’s being reviewed 
and accepted by the clerk’s office for filing, the 
court strongly encourages parties to call the 
clerk’s office before or immediately after filing 
a document requiring emergency action so 
that the document may be processed and 
circulated to the court expeditiously.

In most cases, the court records oral arguments digitally and posts them on its website. The court may, on its own motion, decline to post an argument, 
particularly if sensitive information, such as the name of a child, is inadvertently recorded. 
 

Appellate Mediation 
1.  The court encourages appellate mediation, but  the  court  does  not  appoint  mediators. The  court refers cases to  mediation only if  the parties voluntarily choose 

2. 

and agree upon a mediator. 
If the court determines that at least one of  the parties has indicated an interest in mediation, the court will  generally order the parties to mediate unless a party objects 
or  the  parties cannot agree upon a mediator.  Parties  interested in mediation must complete the applicable part of the docketing statement. 

3.  Any contact with the court regarding mediation must be through the clerk’s office. 
4.  The parties must agree upon a mediator. The court will not appoint a mediator and will not abate the appeal for mediation if the parties cannot reach an agreement. 

Fees 
1.  Appeal:  $205  (civil  only); Permissive Appeal application $205 
2.  Original Proceeding: $155 
3.  Motions: $10 (civil only); Motions for Rehearing $15 (civil only) 
4.  Response to Motion and Objection to Denial of Oral Argument: no fee 
5.  Other fees: Copies are $0.10 per page for the first 50 pages and $0.50 per page for all pages over 50; certified copies are $1.00 per page ($5.00 minimum); copies of 

oral arguments before September 2, 2008, are $3.00 per CD; and the fee for an exhibit tendered for oral argument is $25.00. 

6.  Each party to  a  case  may request and  will  be  provided, free  of  charge, one  CD  with  an  electronic copy of  the  appellate record, subject to the party’s being 
able to receive the copy in that format. Sealed records, however, will be made available to the parties upon a motion, in a manner specified by order of the court. 

E-Filing 
For more information on e-filing documents, including the appellate record, please see the Electronic Filing tab under the Practice Before the Court heading on this 
court’s website. 

Miscellaneous 
1.  A party who is not required to e-file may file a paper copy of a document after court business hours with a justice who is willing to accept it. Tex. R. App. P. 
9.2(a)(2). To set up after-hours filing, call the clerk’s office during business hours if possible. Outside of normal business hours, call the after-hours number listed 
in the court’s phone recording. 

2.  The court uses visiting judges as  often as  necessary within budget limitations. 
3.  The court rarely decides to sit en banc. The court may be convened en banc for the purposes of hearing or rehearing any case on the Chief Justice’s own motion 

or upon a motion supported by a majority of the court. The court hears an average of 3 cases a  year en banc. 

4.  The  court  encourages  a  party  seeking  emergency relief  to  advise  the  clerk’s  office  via  telephone  that  an  emergency matter  has  or imminently will be filed.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
