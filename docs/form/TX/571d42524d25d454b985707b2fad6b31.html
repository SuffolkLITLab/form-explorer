      <pre>PROTECTIVE ORDER KITAPPROVED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS:1Where do I file the forms? 
After you fill out the forms, make two copies and take them 
all to the courthouse. You may file the forms in one of three 
places: the county where you live, the county in which the 
other person lives, or any Texas county in which the violence 
occurred. *If you have a divorce or custody case pending 
against the other person, file the forms in the same county 
as the case or the county where you live. 

What if I live or have children with the other person?
The judge can make orders about who gets to use the 
house, apartment, or car. The judge can also make other 
orders like protection of pets, child custody, child support, 
visitation, and spousal support. 

Can I get protection right away? 
The judge may give you a ‘Temporary Ex Parte Protective 
Order,’ which is a temporary order that protects you until 
your court hearing. Please note: If you do not receive a 
court document entitled “Temporary Ex Parte Protective 
Order” that is signed by a judge after you apply, you do 
NOT have a Protective Order yet. You must go to your 
hearing and ask the judge for a Protective Order. 

In some cases, the judge orders the other person to leave 
the home right away. If you want this, ask the judge when 
you file your application and be ready to testify at a hearing. 

Do I have to go to court? 
Yes. Even if you get a Temporary Ex Parte Protective Order, 
you must go to the next hearing. It should be in about 2 
weeks, and that is when the judge will decide if you get a 
Protective Order and for how long. If you do not go, the 
Temporary Ex Parte Protective Order may end. 

Read Get Ready for Court. You can find this at: 
www.texaslawhelp.org/protectiveorderkit or ask the court 
clerk for a copy. 

How will the other person know about the 
Protective Order? 
You must have the other person "served"  before  the court 
hearing. This means a law enforcement officer --not you-- will 
"serve" the other person a copy of your application. The clerk 
can arrange for law enforcement to serve the other person 
for FREE.

Please note: When the other person receives your application, 
they will also receive a copy of your signed Affidavit or 
Declaration. If the other person is in the military, a copy of your 
application and Affidavit or Declaration will also be sent to the 
officials on base. 

How long will the Protective Order last? 
In most cases, a Protective Order will last up to 2 years. There 
are some situations where a court can issue an order that lasts 
longer than 2 years.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
