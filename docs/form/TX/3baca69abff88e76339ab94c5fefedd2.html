the instructors and provide their credentials, indicate the time allotted to each segment, and 
provide the date and location of the course. 

To be approved, the training must consist of at least 24 hours of content covering mediation 
methods, goals, and techniques. The course content must also address the following: 

(1) 

a survey of the law of guardianship; 

the purpose and nature of guardianship, including the typical interests at stake in a 
contested guardianship; 

practical  and  ethical  considerations  arising  in  typical  guardianship  mediation 
scenarios based upon case studies; 

alternatives to guardianship, including less restrictive support and services available 
for the prospective ward; 

matters relating to capacity of the prospective ward, including mediation of conflicts 
regarding an incapacity determination; 

issues  of  mediation  confidentiality  and  the  privacy  interests  of  the  parties  to 
mediation; 

the ward’s bill of rights; 

the  importance  of  involving  the  prospective  ward  and  focusing  mediation  on  the 
prospective ward; 

practical  matters  regarding  a  guardian’s  responsibilities  to  conduct  inventories, 
accountings, and reports on the ward’s estate, as well as other fiduciary duties; and 

10) 

the role of the Mediator as an impartial facilitator in resolving contested matters. 

 
The Commission may approve a course provided by an alternative dispute resolution system 
or  other  dispute  resolution  organization  as  an  approved  guardianship  mediation  training 
course. 

Once a guardianship mediation training course is approved, the Commission will post the 
name of the course and its provider on the Commission’s website. 

A Mediator is encouraged to attend a guardianship mediation training course approved by 
the  Commission,  but  attendance  is  not  a  required  prerequisite  to  conduct  a  guardianship 
mediation.  A court has discretion to refer a contested guardianship dispute to any Mediator, 
regardless of whether the Mediator has attended a guardianship mediation training course 
approved by the Commission.

Certified Guardians 
 
Code of Ethics and Minimum Standards for Guardianship Services 
 

Code of Ethics 

reamble. The purpose of this Code of Ethics and Minimum Standards for Guardianship Services 
(Minimum Standards) is to protect the interests of incapacitated persons in Texas by ensuring that 
certified guardians and guardianship programs provide guardianship services in a professional and 
competent  manner.  These  standards  are  promulgated  by  the  Texas  Supreme  Court  pursuant  to 
Section 155.101 of the Texas Government Code. 

.  Ward’s Independence and Self-Reliance Promoted.  Guardianships in Texas are designed to 
grant authority over an incapacitated person only to the extent necessary to promote and protect 
the incapacitated person’s well-being. To that end, the guardian must seek to encourage the 
development  or  maintenance  of  maximum  independence  and  self-reliance  to  the  extent 
consistent  with  the  ward’s  health  and  safety and  financial circumstances,  with  the  eventual 
goal, if possible, of self-sufficiency. 

.   Fiduciary Relationship. A guardian is a fiduciary of a ward under the guardian’s care and must 
exhibit the highest degree of loyalty and fidelity in the guardian’s relations with the ward. 

.   Confidentiality. A guardian must treat information relating to a ward under the guardian’s care 
as confidential and may disclose such information only with the consent of the ward or, if the 
ward cannot give consent, only as necessary to promote and protect the ward’s wellbeing. To 
the  extent  not  inconsistent  with  the  ward’s  direction  and  best  interests,  or  to  the  extent 
necessary  to  respond  to  a  complaint  or  investigation,  a  guardian  may  disclose  information 
about the ward’s condition to family and friends of the ward or to an appropriate government 
entity.  A  guardian  must  disclose  information  about  those  matters  specified  in  Section 
1151.056, Texas Estates Code, to a ward’s spouse, parents, siblings and children, unless the 
court relieves the guardian of the duty to do so in accordance with Section 1151.056, Texas 
Estates Code. 

.   Ward’s  Preferences  Generally  Respected.  When  making  decisions  on  behalf  of  a  ward,  a 
guardian must strive to act in accordance with the known or ascertainable preferences of the 
ward,  including  preferences  expressed  in  valid  estate  planning  documents,  unless  to  do  so 
would cause substantial harm to  the ward’s  person  or property, in which case  the guardian 
should make decisions that are in the best interest of the ward. A guardian must regularly visit 
and, to the extent feasible, confer with the ward regarding decisions to be made in and on the 
ward’s behalf. To the extent not inconsistent with the ward’s direction and best interests, a 

Misc. Docket No. 21-9098

  P

guardian may confer with family and friends of the ward concerning the ward’s preferences. 

.   Duty of Competence. A guardian of the person must make reasonable and informed decisions 
about the ward’s residence, care, treatment, and services. A guardian of the estate must take 
care of and manage the estate as a prudent person would manage the person’s own property 
unless relevant law imposes a higher standard of care. In either case, a guardian must exercise 
reasonable  diligence  to  remain  informed  about  options  available  to  the  ward  to  promote 
independence and self-reliance. A guardian must refrain from making decisions outside of the 
scope of authority granted to the guardian by law or court order. 

.   Less Restrictive Alternatives Preferred. In determining the ward’s residence, a guardian must 
strive  to  select  a  residence  that  represents  the  least  restrictive  environment  available,  both 
practically and financially. In making decisions relating to the ward’s health, the guardian must 
strive to select care, treatment and service options that represent the least restrictive form of 
intervention available, both practically and financially. In either event, the guardian must give 
due consideration to the ward’s preferences and well-being. 

.   Avoidance  of  Conflicts  of  Interest  and  Self-Dealing.  A  must  avoid  conflicts  of  interest  and 
refrain from personally engaging in transactions with the ward and other forms of self-dealing, 
except in a manner authorized by law. 

.   Responsibility to Keep Court Apprised of Condition of Ward’s Person or Property. A guardian 
must  keep  the  court  monitoring  the  guardianship  apprised  of  the  guardian’s  and  ward’s 
whereabouts and the condition of the ward’s person and estate, including timely filing reports 
and accounts as required by law or court order, and updating the court regarding significant, 
material changes as they occur. 

.   Responsibility to Seek Modification or Termination of Guardianship. A guardian must seek 
modification  of  the  terms  of  the  guardianship  or  termination  of  the  guardianship  when 
appropriate to promote the independence and self-reliance of the ward. Upon termination of a 
guardianship,  the  guardian  must  settle  and  close  the  guardianship  competently  and  without 
unnecessary delay. 

0. Responsibility to Manage Caseload. A guardian must not accept a new appointment if doing 
so would substantially and adversely affect the guardian’s ability to fulfill duties to any ward 
already  under  the  guardian’s  care.  When  a  guardian  can  no  longer  effectively  perform  the 
duties of thea guardian to a ward under the guardian’s care, the guardian must take necessary 
steps to alert the court of the need for the appointment of a successor guardian.

.   Applicability. These Minimum Standards apply to the provision of guardianship services by 
certified guardians, guardianship programs, and the Texas Department of Aging and Disability

(d)  Unless  this  right  of  the  ward  is  limited  by  a  court  or  otherwise  restricted  by  law,  the 
guardian  must  provide  the  ward  contact  information  for  the  court,  the  Judicial  Branch 
Certification Commission, the Department of Family and Protective Services, Disability 
Rights Texas, and other state and local agencies and organizations which provide resources 
on aging, disability, mental health, and intellectual and developmental disabilities. 

4.  Relationship with Family Members and Friends of the Ward. 
 

(a)  The  guardian  must  maintain  a  professional  relationship  with  the  ward’s  family  and  the 

ward’s friends. 

b)  The guardian must recognize the value of family and friends to the quality of life of the 
ward.  The  guardian  must  encourage  and  support  the  ward  in  maintaining  contact  with 
family members and friends when doing so benefits the ward. 

c)  The  guardian  must  assist  the  ward  in  maintaining  or  reestablishing  relationships  with 

family and friends, except when doing so would not be of benefit to the ward. 

d)  When disposing of the ward’s assets, the guardian may notify family members and friends 
and  give  them  the  opportunity,  with  court  approval  and  in  compliance  with  the  Texas 
Estates Code, to obtain assets (particularly those with sentimental value). 

e)  The guardian must make reasonable efforts to preserve property designated in the ward’s 
will and other estate planning devices executed by the ward. Subject to court approval, the 
present  needs  of  a  ward,  if  not  covered  by  other  property,  may  have  priority  over 
preservation of designated property. 

f)  The guardian may maintain communication with the ward’s family and friends regarding 
significant occurrences that affect the ward when that communication would benefit the 
ward. 

g)  The guardian must maintain communication with the ward’s spouse, parents, siblings, and 
children if the ward is admitted to a medical facility for acute care for three days or longer, 
the ward’s residence has changed, or the ward is staying at a location other than the ward’s 
residence for longer than a week, unless the court relieves the guardian of the duty to do so 
in accordance with Section 1151.056, Texas Estates Code. 

h)  The guardian  may  keep  immediate family members and  friends advised of all pertinent 
medical  issues  when  doing  so  would  benefit  the  ward.  The  guardian  may  request  and 
consider family input when making medical decisions.

(i)  The guardian must inform the ward’s spouse, parents, siblings, and children if the ward 
dies and, in the event of the ward’s death, of any funeral arrangements and the ward’s final 
resting place, unless the court relieves the guardian of the duty to do so in accordance with 
Section 1151.056 Texas Estates Code. 

.   Relationship with Other Professionals and Providers of Service to the Ward. 

(a)  The guardian must treat all professionals and service providers with courtesy and respect 

and strive to enhance cooperation on behalf of the ward. 

b)  The  guardian  must  develop  and  stay  current  with  the  services,  providers,  facilities,  and 
community resources to ensure that the ward receives high-quality services from the most 
appropriate provider. 

c) The guardian must coordinate and monitor services needed by the ward to ensure that the 
ward is receiving the appropriate care and treatment. A guardian must not provide direct 
services  to  the  ward  for  compensation  unless  a  written  contract  approved  by  the  court 
authorizes the provision of such services. 

d)  The guardian must engage the services of professionals (such as attorneys, accountants, 
stockbrokers, real estate agents, doctors) as necessary to appropriately meet the needs of 
the ward and in compliance with the Texas Estates Code. 

e)  The guardian must avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest or impropriety when 
dealing  with  the  needs  of  the  ward.  Impropriety  or  conflict  of  interest  arises  where  the 
guardian  has  some  personal  or  agency  interest  that  can  be  perceived  as  self-serving  or 
adverse to the position or best interest of the ward. A conflict of interest may also arise 
where the guardian has dual or multiple relationships with a ward which conflict with each 
other or has a conflict between the best interests of two or more wards. The guardian must 
disclose  dual  or  multiple  relationships  to  the  court,  except  those  which  are  casual, 
coincidental  or  allowed  under  Standard  15(c).  Governmental  entities  and  guardianship 
programs providing multiple services must maintain an arm’s-length relationship between 
those services.

(a)  The guardian must enable the ward to exercise the ward’s right to make informed consent 
decisions to the greatest extent of the ward’s capacity and ability. Unless this right of the 
ward is limited by a court or otherwise restricted by law, the guardian must annually explain

language, or preferred mode of communication, and in a manner accessible to the ward. 

b)  Unless  this  right  of  the  ward  is  limited  by  a  court  or  otherwise  restricted  by  law,  the 
guardian must provide the ward a copy of the guardianship order, letters of guardianship, 
contact information for the court that issued the letters, contact information for the Judicial 
Branch Certification Commission, and other entities required by §1151.351, Texas Estates 
Code. 

c)  The guardian, standing in the place of the ward who lacks capacity, must access the same 
information that would have been given to the ward if the ward had capacity in order to 
make informed substituted judgments on behalf of the ward. 

d)  The guardian must make a good faith effort to determine whether the ward has previously 
stated any preferences before making any decisions on the ward’s behalf and then follow 
these preferences unless doing so would adversely affect the ward or the ward’s estate. 

e)  The guardian may make decisions that are contrary to the known preferences of the ward 

when following the wishes of the ward would adversely affect the ward. 

(a)  Each decision made by the guardian must be an informed decision based on the principle 

7.   Standards for Decision-Making. 
 

of Informed Consent. 

b)  Substituted Judgment. 

(1)  Substituted Judgment is the principle of decision-making that substitutes, as the guiding 
force in any surrogate decision made by the guardian, the decision the ward would have 
made when competent. 

2) Substituted  Judgment  promotes  the  underlying  values  of  self-determination  and 

wellbeing of the ward. 

3)  Substituted  Judgment  is  not  used  when  following  the  ward’s  wishes  would  cause 
substantial harm to the ward or when the guardian cannot establish the ward’s prior 
wishes. 

  (

  (

 

(c)  Best Interest of the Ward. 
 

(1)  Best Interest is the standard of decision-making the guardian should use when the ward 

Misc. Docket No. 21-9098 
 

 

 

Page 20  

 

  (

  (

  (

  (

 

  (

 

has never had capacity or when the ward’s wishes cannot be determined. 

2)  The Best Interest standard requires the guardian to consider the least intrusive, most 
normalizing, and least restrictive course of action possible to provide for the needs of 
the ward.  

3)  The  Best  Interest  standard  is  used  when  following  the  ward’s  wishes  would  cause 
substantial harm to the ward, or when the guardian is unable to establish the ward’s 
prior or current wishes. 

4)  Best  Interest  decisions  include  consideration  of  the  ward’s  current  and  previously 

expressed wishes. 

8. Least Restrictive Alternative. 
 

(a)  The guardian must carefully evaluate the alternatives that are available and choose the one 
that  best  meets  the  needs  of  the  ward  while  placing  the  least  restrictions  on  his  or  her 
freedom, rights, and ability to control his or her environment. 

b)  The guardian must weigh the risks and benefits and develop a balance between maximizing 
the independence and self-determination of the ward and maintaining the ward’s protection 
and safety. 

c)  The following guidelines apply in the determination of the least restrictive alternative: 

(1)  The  guardian  must  become  familiar  with  the  available  options  for  residence,  care, 

medical treatment, vocational training, and education. 

2)  The guardian must make a good faith effort to know the ward’s preferences. 

3)  The  guardian  must  consider  assessments  of  the  ward’s  needs  as  determined  by 
specialists.  This  may  include  an  independent  assessment  of  the  ward’s  functional 
ability, the ward’s health status, and the ward’s care needs. 

9.   Self-Determination of the Ward. 

a)  The guardian must provide the ward with every opportunity to exercise those rights that 
the ward might be capable of exercising as they relate to the care of the ward’s person. 

b)  The guardian must encourage the development or maintenance of maximum self-reliance

and independence of the ward. 

c)  The guardian must advocate for individualized planning and the least restrictive alternative 

on behalf of the ward. 

10. Duties Regarding Diversity and Personal Preference of the Ward. The guardian must make a 
good faith effort to determine the extent to which the ward identifies with particular ethnic, 
religious, gender, cultural, and personal values and to make decisions consistent with these 
values, unless doing so would result in substantial harm to the ward’s person or property. 

(a)  Subject to state and federal law, the guardian must keep the affairs of the ward confidential. 

b)  The guardian must respect the ward’s privacy and dignity, especially when the disclosure 

of information is necessary.  

c)  Disclosure of information must be limited to what is necessary and relevant to the issue 

being addressed in the best interest of the ward. 

12. Duties of the Guardian of the Person. The guardian of the person has the following duties and 

obligations to the ward unless the order of appointment provides otherwise: 

(a)  To see that the ward is living in the most appropriate environment that addresses the ward’s 

wishes and needs. 

(1)  The  guardian must authorize moving  a  ward  to a  more  restrictive environment only 
after  evaluating  other  medical  and  health  care  options  and  making  an  independent 
determination that the move is the least restrictive alternative at the time, fulfills the 
current needs of the ward, and serves the overall best interest of the ward. 

2)  When  the  guardian  considers  involuntary  or  long-term  placement  of  the  ward  in  an 
institutional setting, the bases of the decision must be to minimize the risk of substantial 
harm to the ward, to obtain the most appropriate placement possible, and to secure the 
best treatment for the ward. 

(b)  To ensure that provision is made for the support, care, comfort, health, and maintenance of 

the ward. 

  (

 

c)  To make reasonable efforts to secure for the ward medical, psychological, therapeutic, and

social  services,  training,  education,  and  social  and  vocational  opportunities  that  are 
appropriate and that will maximize the ward’s potential for self-reliance and independence. 

d)  To  seek  specific  judicial  authority  when  the  dissolution  of  a  marriage  or  another

capacity is partially or completely restored. 

2)  Meet with the ward as soon after the appointment as is feasible. At the first meeting, to 
the  extent  possible  given  the  ward’s  capacity  to  comprehend  and  communicate,  the 
guardian must: 

(A) Communicate to the ward the role of the guardian; 

B) Explain the rights retained by the ward; 

C) Unless this right of the ward is limited by a court or otherwise restricted by law, 
deliver a copy of the guardianship order, letters of guardianship, a copy of the Bill 
of Rights for Wards, Subchapter H, Chapter 1151, Texas Estates Code, and contact 
information for the court that issued the order and letters. 

D) Unless this right of the ward is limited by a court or otherwise restricted by law, 
provide  the  ward  contact  information  for  regulatory  agencies  and  resource 
organizations as required by §1151.351, Texas Estates Code.

ward rather than providing those services directly.

services  and  to  advocate  vigorously  on  behalf  of  the  ward,  the  guardian  must  be 
independent from all service providers.

profit or fee unless no alternative is available and the guardian discloses this arrangement

i)  The guardian must determine if a will exists and, for estate planning purposes only, may

1162.005 of the Texas Estates Code. 

17. Guardian of the Estate: Initial and Ongoing Responsibilities.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
