BRIEF EXPLANATION OF THE FEDERAL FARM BILL AND RELATED 
TEXAS LEGISLATION IN THE CONTEXT OF MARIHUANA PROSECUTION 
August 2019 
 

 

Scope of Document:  

his document focuses on the impact of the federal farm bill and similar state legislation on forensic analysis 
of seized drugs in the crime laboratory as well as observations from the Office of Court Administration 
regarding case filing data. Considerations regarding probable cause, the use of circumstantial evidence, and 
similar legal issues in marihuana cases are beyond the scope of this document.  

ackground:  

n December 20, 2018, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 legalized the industrial production of 
hemp nationwide while simultaneously removing hemp from the Controlled Substances Act. Under the new 
law,  hemp  was  reclassified  as  an  agricultural  product  and  the  United  States  Department  of  Agriculture 
(USDA) was charged with publishing regulations to govern the industry. The legislation delegates to states 
and  Indian  tribes  through  their  departments  of  agriculture  the  broad  authority  to  regulate  and  limit  the 
production  and  sale  of  hemp  products  within  their  borders.  However,  states  and  tribes  cannot  limit  the 
transportation or shipment of hemp and hemp products through their respective jurisdictions. Should a state 
or tribe opt not to do this, the regulations of the United States Department of Agriculture apply.  

ince the passage of the federal bill, many state legislatures have adopted their own laws authorizing the 
Departments of Agriculture at the state level to write rules governing the local industry and submit plans to 
the USDA describing their proposed regulatory systems.1  

he contemplated safeguards governing the industrial/agricultural hemp industry are extensive, but many 

states (including Texas) are still in the process of drafting administrative rules.  

emp vs. Marihuana:  

nder  the  Texas  Hemp  Bill  (HB-1325),  marihuana  and  tetrahydrocannabinol,  or  THC  (excluding  the 
limited THC in hemp), remain illegal substances. THC is the chemical component that induces the “high” 
effect. What changed under Texas law, similar to the federal legislation, is that “hemp” is now excluded 
from the definition of “controlled substance” and “marihuana.”2  

emp and marihuana both come from the cannabis plant. Different parts of the plant have different THC 
concentrations and various factors may impact whether a particular plant sample exceeds the statutory THC 

 

1  See  http://www.ncsl.org/research/agriculture-and-rural-development/state-industrial-hemp-statutes.aspx  for  an  overview  of 
state statutes.  
2 Hemp is defined as “the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds of the plant and all derivatives, 
extracts,  cannabinoids,  isomers,  acids,  salts  of  isomers,  whether  growing  or  not,  with  a  delta-9  tetrahydrocannabinol 
concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.”

limit of 0.3%.3 For example, if a hemp farmer waits too long to harvest, the THC in the crop may exceed 
the legal threshold of 0.3%. HB-1325 provides many safeguards to ensure the plant material from Texas 
farms is compliant with the THC cutoff established in the law. Administrative rulemaking by the Texas 
Department of Agriculture will provide additional detail and guidance.  

B-1325 and Marihuana Prosecution: 

aw enforcement agencies routinely submit suspected illegal substances to accredited crime laboratories 
for analysis. The laboratories test the substance and issue a report to assist law enforcement and prosecutors 
with  decision-making  in  a  case.  Before  HB-1325  was  enacted,  laboratories  reported  a  positive  result  if 
cannabinoids  were  present.  When  no  cannabinoids  were  detected,  the  laboratory  reported  no  controlled 
substance. The laboratories were not required to quantitate the THC, i.e., to identify the amount of THC, in 
the evidentiary sample. In order for crime laboratories to specifically quantitate the THC, which definitively 
distinguishes  hemp  and  marihuana  from  an  analytical  chemistry  perspective,  they  need  additional 
equipment  and  staffing.  This  is  because  quantitation  is  more  complex  and  time-consuming  in  forensic 
casework than simply identifying the presence or absence of THC.  

ome Texas prosecutors have announced plans to no longer prosecute low-level marihuana cases and to 
dismiss pending cases that were filed after the enactment of the new law. In response, Texas Governor Greg 
Abbott,  Lieutenant  Governor  Dan  Patrick,  House  Speaker  Dennis  Bonnen  and  Attorney  General  Ken 
Paxton issued a letter to district attorneys statewide emphasizing that marihuana was not decriminalized 
with the passage of HB-1325.4 New case filings of low-level marihuana cases decreased by over 20% in 
June 2019 compared to June 2018.5 

olutions in Progress:   

ecause the federal farm bill was signed into law before the Texas Hemp Bill, the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA) was the first agency to address the challenge of reporting analytical information to 
law enforcement that would assist them in distinguishing hemp from marihuana in seized drug samples.  

he DEA developed a qualitative method using a three-pronged analytical scheme for plant material.6 This 
method results in two possible reporting statements: (1) positive for marihuana (THC above 1%); or (2) 
inconclusive for marihuana/hemp (when one or more of the tests is negative). For inconclusive results, the 
submitting agency is then afforded the opportunity to request additional testing, which would include the 
use  of  a  full  quantitative  method.  Depending  on  the  laboratory,  that  additional  testing  may  need  to  be 
outsourced or it may be performed internally.  

 key advantage of the DEA’s analytical approach is that it provides submitting agencies with a reliable 
tool to assist with decision-making in the vast majority of suspected marihuana cases. It is also much faster 
and less expensive than a full quantitation. Based on the experience of federal agencies, including the DEA 
and  the  United  States  Army  crime  laboratory,  evidentiary  samples  of  suspected  marihuana  in  real-life 
casework almost always contain THC levels significantly higher than 1%, thus making the DEA’s method 
highly informative for stakeholders in the criminal justice system. Texas laboratories are currently in the 
process  of  validating  the  DEA’s  method  with  enhancements  as  needed.  This  statewide  effort  is  being 

 

3 With the exception of West Virginia, all states that have enacted legislation regulating hemp have used the 0.3% limit. West 
Virginia’s legislation uses a THC content of less than 1%.

5 The law’s effective date was June 10, 2019. 
6 Additional work is currently underway to validate an analytical scheme for edibles and oils.

implemented  in  collaboration  with  the  Institute  for  Forensic  Research,  Training  and  Innovation  at  Sam 
Houston State University. Texas laboratories expect to be issuing reports  using the validated  method in 
approximately six months.  

ccreditation Considerations:  

nder Article 38.35 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, in order for seized drug analysis (including 
quantitation) to be admitted in a criminal trial, it must be performed in a laboratory accredited by the Texas 
Forensic Science Commission.7 The Commission recognizes national accrediting bodies that accredit to 
ISO standards (17025 or 17020), including forensic supplemental standards that address the intersection of 
laboratory analysis with the criminal justice system.8  

any private laboratories that currently perform quantitation for the agricultural/industrial hemp industry 
are  accredited  to  ISO-17025.  However,  they  are  not  typically  accredited  to  the  supplemental  forensic 
standards. These laboratories may choose to add the forensic supplement to their scope of accreditation and 
would then be eligible to analyze cases for law enforcement agencies or defendants.  

uestions  regarding  accreditation  for  forensic  casework  should  be  directed  to  Leigh  Savage  at 

leigh.savage@fsc.texas.gov. Media inquiries should be directed to megan.lavoie@txcourts.gov.
