EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

State forensic science commissions may contribute to forensic improvement through oversight and 
coordination of forensic science resources. This report provides a review for states wishing to create 
and maintain a state forensic science commission. Recognizing the substantial differences that exist 
among the states regarding governance, culture, statutes and crime laboratory systems1, this report 
provides an overview of considerations in planning for and developing a state-level forensic science 
commission.  

State commissions focus on communication and collaboration among laboratories and stakeholders, 
allocation of resources, laboratory improvements, promulgation of accreditation and certification 
standards, investigations into misconduct or professional negligence in crime laboratories, and other 
implementation and oversight issues.  

A state forensic science commission may play a positive role in forensic improvement. State 
commissions may help to:  

  prevent or mitigate problems in forensic science laboratories or systems in a role as the 

investigator of misconduct or professional negligence; 

  ensure that national standards are implemented in practice, especially regarding accreditation 

activities; 

  coordinate state or grant funding to address areas of need or opportunities to implement 

technological or operational innovations; and 

  improve cooperation among forensic science laboratories and stakeholders. 

Although only 10 states (and the District of Columbia) currently have statutorily created forensic 
science commissions, many more states have DNA commissions or informal advisory boards or are 
considering forming commissions. Existing state commissions vary considerably with respect to 
which of these functions they fulfill. A planning process can determine which elements should be 
considered, including issues relating to the sustainment of a commission, such as the allocation of 
staff and funding, membership, and policies and procedures.  

Although this report is largely descriptive, detailing the experience of current and past commission 
activities from various states, it also presents “lessons learned” based on the experience of states 
who have established a commission or other type of advisory board to address forensic science. 
Following the report, Appendices 1 and 2 provide specific details for each of the 11 commissions 
currently in existence in the United States.

forensic laboratories (i.e., medical examiner/coroner offices) as well.

Methodology 

This report is based on a review of state forensic science commissions, as well as similar groups such 
as DNA review boards, task forces or advisory boards. Numerous interviews were conducted with 
staff or commission members from each existing state commission, the Director of the District of 
Columbia Department of Forensic Science2 (DCDFS) who, by statute, works with two different 
commissions, members of the U.S. National Commission on Forensic Science (NFSC), and staff 
from the Office of the Forensic Science for the United Kingdom, which oversees forensic 
laboratories in the U.K.  

There are many documents and journal articles on the subject, which have been cited where 
appropriate, as well as statutes, annual reports and other published documents from state 
commissions. Further documentation was gathered by in-person and online attendance of meetings 
of several existing state forensic science commissions, as well as the NCFS.  

Context of Forensic Science Improvement 

The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) is the research, development and evaluation agency of the 
U.S. Department of Justice, dedicated to improving knowledge and understanding of crime and 
justice issues through science3. NIJ’s Forensic Technology Center of Excellence (FTCoE) was 
established to support NIJ’s research, development, testing and evaluation (RDT&E) process in all 
areas of forensic science, including technology transition and knowledge transfer for the forensic 
science and criminal justice communities4. State forensic science commissions may play a key role in 
promoting innovations developed by NIJ’s research program and identified by the FTCoE as 
promising for adoption into practice5. 

State forensic science commissions exist in a broader context of organizations that are designed to 
promote forensic improvement. Many professional organizations promote training, accreditation, 
and other activities for practitioners and leaders in the crime laboratory. For example, forensic 
professional organizations provide scientific and training conferences, publish journals, and 
contribute to the professional development of the forensic disciplines. Federal organizations include 
the Organization of Scientific Area Committees6 and the Scientific Working Group on DNA 
Analysis and Methods (SWGDAM)7, which are national efforts to develop and promulgate scientific 
standards. In general, these organizations promote standards but lack the ability to implement 
specific changes in laboratory practice.

Impetus for Strengthening Forensic Sciences 

There have been efforts at the national level to address these issues. Notably, the National Academy 
of Sciences (NAS) published a report in 2009, “Strengthening Forensic Science, A Path Forward,”8 
which recommended a range of reforms, including changes in terminology, standards, 
administration, and scientific support. Other academic papers9 and government reports (e.g., the 
Executive Office of the President’s Subcommittee on Forensic Science report, Strengthening 
Forensic Science: A Progress Report in February 2014 and The President’s Council of Advisors on 
Science and Technology’s 2016 report, Report on Forensic Science in Criminal Courts: Ensuring Scientific 
Validity of Feature-Comparison Methods). In partnership with DOJ, NIST has created 35 Organization 
for Scientific Area Committees (OSAC) to develop standards, guidelines and best practices intended 
to improve quality and consistency within the forensic science community. The 2014 Census of 
Publicly Funded Forensic Crime Laboratories found that the clear majority of laboratories are now 
accredited (88%), conduct proficiency testing (98%), and maintain a written code of ethics (94%) 
and written standards for employee performance (75%).10 

The Role of a State Forensic Science Commission 

Although national-level efforts can contribute to forensic improvement, state and local engagement 
is required because over 93% of forensic laboratory services are requested and provided by state and 
local laboratories.11 Several states have chosen to address the challenges faced by the forensic 
science community through the creation of a state forensic science commission. As of 2016, 10 
states have legislatively created forensic science commissions that are currently active. Functioning 
on a smaller scale, state commissions can quickly identify and respond directly to issues. Further, the 
working relationships among stakeholders fostered by state commissions allow them to be proactive 
in addressing problems.  

Although most state forensic laboratories are now accredited and have solid quality assurance 
programs in place, those are not always an absolute protection against problems and crises. Through 
customer engagement with the laboratory or by acting as a direct oversight body, commissions have 
served to augment the accreditation of laboratories in a way that they feel best suits the cultures and 
resources of their states.12 Many commissions permit citizens to register complaints about potential

forensic misconduct or other issues within the crime laboratory system. These commissions, 
working with other government entities and stakeholders, can conduct thorough, independent 
reviews to identify the sources of problems and make comprehensive recommendations that address 
laboratory management or policy shortfalls. Such reviews have played a positive role in building 
public confidence in forensic science and the criminal justice community. Appendix 1 summarizes 
the responsibilities of each state commission as developed. 

The value of a state forensic science commission is closely related to the importance of sound 
forensic practice to police, prosecutors, policy-makers, and other stakeholders. Many state 
commissions were created in response to forensic errors that arose from laboratory negligence or 
misconduct.13 In these cases, policy-makers have seen the formation of a state forensic science 
commission to mitigate potential future problems, including costs associated with settlements and 
damages from civil suits, which can be substantial.14 States have also used commissions to conduct 
retroactive case reviews, such as in the case of hair microscopy.15  

Using a Commission to Engage Stakeholders 

A state forensic science commission provides a forum for robust discussions between forensic 
science stakeholders to improve communication and coordination. Thus, membership typically 
includes most customers in the criminal justice system.16 State forensic science commissions may 
work directly with formal or informal organizations of crime laboratory directors, which can serve in 
an advisory capacity. For example, the New York crime laboratory directors’ group is the NY Crime 
Lab Advisory Committee (NYCLAC). NYCLAC reports to the Commission on Forensic Science as 
needed, and the Chair of NYCLAC is a member of the Commission. If these relationships work 
well, issues directly relating to science (as opposed to issues that impact the delivery system of 
forensic services) can be specifically directed to scientists. 17 

                                                  

following the Office of Inspector General (IG)’s release of a comprehensive assessment of the misconduct of a 
former DNA technician and FBI DNA Laboratory’s protocols and practices. The FBI Laboratory has been accredited 
since 1998.)  

13 One early proponent and sponsor of the Texas legislation that created their commission, State Senator Juan Hinjosa, 

said:  

“One of the ways to lose faith in the criminal justice system is to convict innocent people of crimes they did not 
commit using evidence that is unreliable, unscientific and pure junk science. In creating our commission, we wanted 
to ensure it was not politicized and that all stakeholders needed to buy in and share the same goals. We needed to 
focus on credible evidence based on valid and reliable scientific research to avoid wrongful convictions.”

16 When serving as President of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences (AAFS), Joseph P. Bono wrote the 
following article: Bono, Joseph P. “The Blame Game Has Run Its Course, Strengthening Forensic Science 
Investigation,” Texas Bar Journal 74(7) (July 2011): 592-596. “The best way to maximize the probability for success in 
strengthening the forensic sciences is for interested parties across the scientific, legal, and academic communities to 
find common ground and build upon it.” 

17 Peter Marone, who served as the Chairman of CFSO in 2008, testified before the U.S. House Subcommittee on 

Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security. In his comments discussing the mixture of scientists and stakeholders 
serving on state oversight commissions, he stated: “The key to appropriate and proper oversight is to have individuals 

4 

Several jurisdictions have two commissions: one involving stakeholders, including lawyers (both 
prosecution and defense) and another working group comprising scientists.18 Technical issues are 
discussed and resolved by the scientific group, whereas issues affecting the criminal justice system 
are discussed and resolved by the broader customer group. Additionally, several states have 
broadened their knowledge base by including technical experts from other states. 19 Often, 
commissions include the agency heads who oversee forensic services. As one crime laboratory 
manager said: “This gives me at least a couple of hours every quarter to discuss my lab – I wouldn’t 
have this opportunity without his [agency head] being on the commission.” In another case, a law 
enforcement stakeholder learned a great deal by reviewing materials in preparation for commission 
meetings. 

Using a Commission to Coordinate Resources within a State 

State commissions may promote cooperation and coordination across multiple forensic providers 
with varying jurisdiction. These activities may encompass the promotion of training, certification, 
and accreditation to establish a foundation for a consistent level of forensic work. A commission 
may be used to coordinate resource allocation and eliminate duplication of services or provide a 
mechanism to allocate resources within a discipline that requires expensive equipment or specialized 
experts. These efforts may incorporate broader resource considerations, such as cooperation to 
address backlogs or incorporate new methods. 

This role may extend to allocation of grant funding and conformance with federal grant 
requirements. For example, Coverdell requires an entity in each state to provide independent 
investigations of laboratory problems. State commissions are familiar with and knowledgeable about 
crime laboratory management and practice and can take on an investigative role using this previously 
established body of knowledge. 20 

Using a Commission for Outreach from the Forensic Science Community 

The development of closer working relationships among interested parties is valuable to members of 
commissions, laboratory directors and other professionals who routinely work with them. 
Particularly noteworthy is the ability of the defense bar to have a comfortable relationship with 
crime laboratory managers. If professionals who usually engage in relatively adversarial relationships 

representing the stakeholders, but that these individuals must be there for the right reason, to provide the best 
possible scientific analysis. There cannot be any room for preconceived positions and agenda-driven positions.” Supra 
note 4 at 28. 

18 Another example of this is the DCDFS. D.C. Law § 5-1501.01 et seq. provides for the Department’s Director to work 
with two boards. The Science Advisory Board, which consists of nine voting members, must include five scientists 
with experience in scientific research and methodology, including a statistician and a member with quality assurance 
experience. Four other members must be forensic scientists. This Board reviews all reports of allegations of 
professional negligence and misconduct, program standards and protocols, the quality and timeliness of services and 
future programs. The Stakeholder Council includes the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety and Justice, public safety and 
health officials, prosecution and defense attorneys. This Council focuses on the effectiveness and delivery of services 
and advises the Mayor and City Council.

Coverdell requirement, see Laurin, Jennifer E. “Remapping the Path Forward: Toward a Systemic View of Forensic

work together to develop standards and protocols, some issues that might have been litigated can be 
resolved through commission discussions.21 

Having a forensic science commission can elevate the visibility and understanding of crime 
laboratory work within the criminal justice community. Additionally, if a commission functions at a 
high level of transparency, the public and other associated organizations working with the criminal 
justice system will also gain a better understanding. In most cases, these efforts extend to 
engagement with policy-makers and other decision-makers who have an interest in forensic science 
practice in their state. Through educational activities, the state commission can play a positive role to 
improve the understanding of key issues. 

North Carolina has an annual Forensic Science Week during which it conducts events to increase 
the community’s understanding of forensic work. These activities are intended to produce a realistic 
view of forensic work among colleagues and the public, in contrast to media portrayals.22 

Using a Commission to Improve Public Confidence 

 The state commission may improve public confidence by establishing risk prevention and

mitigation strategies for laboratory operations. The commission’s oversight role may include
the establishment of standards or best practices within the state laboratory system. Relevant
strategies have been identified by forensic science manager associations at both the federal
(ASCLD) and state levels. These factors include the following:

 Hiring practices and background investigations;
 Competency testing and evaluation;
 Periodic internal and external proficiency testing;
 Discipline certification;
 Clear and specific policies and protocols that are periodically reviewed;
 Rigorous quality assurance programs with dedicated managers;
 Sufficient personnel and equipment;23
 Accreditation;
 Resources (federal/state/local) targeting to maximize efficiency and coordination and avoid

 Outreach to customers, particularly relating to evidence priorities and backlogs; and
 The existence of a direct working relationship with crime scene investigators, including

duplication;

training.

21 Customers can be considered both upstream users who make preliminary decisions regarding forensic evidence and 

what should be analyzed and downstream users presenting forensic evidence in a judicial setting. See Id at 1076; also, 
for a discussion of the risk associated with upstream evidence collection, see Horvath, Frank, and Meesig, Robert,

Forensic Sciences 41 (1996): 963-969.

CURRENT STATUTORILY CREATED STATE FORENSIC SCIENCE 
COMMISSIONS 

Currently, only 10 states24 and the District of Columbia have a legislatively created commission to 
provide support, guidance or oversight to state and local crime laboratories. In general, these 
commissions seek to address “… wide variability in capacity, oversight, staffing, certification, and 
accreditation…” within forensic laboratory systems.25,26 In some cases, commissions have followed 
working groups established by crime laboratory directors that include criminal justice stakeholders to 
address customer needs on an ad hoc basis. In such situations, the creation of state commissions may 
provide more permanent and recognizable entities that are more inclusive of stakeholders outside of 
forensic science.27 

In general, there are two primary models. Most state commissions work with the primary forensic 
provider: the state crime laboratory system. These commissions often serve to provide customer 
(user agency) feedback and may have a large scientific membership to review protocols and 
methodologies. Virginia and the District of Columbia have two commissions, one to address each 
aspect. Other states (e.g., Maryland, Missouri, New York and Texas) oversee numerous state and 
local laboratories and focus more on oversight, accreditation and licensing. See Appendix 2 for more 
details on each state commission, its structure, and its statutory authorization. 

PLANNING FOR A STATE FORENSIC SCIENCE COMMISSION 

This review of existing and dormant state forensic science commissions provides some valuable 
lessons for states considering creating a commission. Several commissions appear to have 
discontinued because of a lack of funding and support. In other cases, commissions continue but 
lack the full range of authority necessary to meet the needs of forensic science oversight. For states 
considering the creation of a commission, one valuable strategy to move forward is to create a state 
forensic science planning commission. This may be achieved through legislation. Such an effort could 
require one to two years to accomplish, however it would ultimately help establish the standing 
commission for success.  

The responsibilities and duties of existing commissions, developed by both statutory language and 
practice, include a wide range of activities, and the statutory language varies considerably. In general, 
these duties are framed to support a commission overseeing one primary state laboratory system or 
aspects of multiple state and local laboratories within its jurisdiction. In the former case, the 
commission tends to serve in an advisory capacity to the director of the state lab and often has fiscal

25 NAS Report, supra note 5, at 14. 
26 In this paper, the term ‘accreditation’ is used to refer to accreditation gained from one of a number of accreditation 
bodies, including the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA), ASCLD/LAB, and American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI)-American Society for Quality (ASQ) National Accreditation Board (ANAB). 

27 Prosecutors are also being encouraged to create Customer Working Groups. See Hamann, Kristine, “Customer 
Working Groups – Benefits for Directors of Public Forensic Laboratories,” ASCLD Executive Education Digests 3 
(2014).

responsibilities. In contrast, in the latter case, the commission tends to be more involved and to 
have some level of oversight and pursue ongoing engagement with laboratories to identify issues for 
which mitigation measures may be helpful statewide. The planning process should include careful 
deliberation concerning the scope of responsibilities, duties, and independence of a new state 
forensic science commission. 

The planning process represents an opportunity to involve criminal justice, legislative, and forensic 
science professionals (e.g, law enforcement, scientists, legal, advocate) in state commissions from the 
very beginning and, thus, foster buy-in and ensure that the commission is designed to meet the 
needs of the community. A planning commission also permits appropriate stakeholders to educate 
themselves on other states’ models and identify issues important to their state. The planning effort 
produces recommendations for the standing commission, including legislative authority, 
membership, staffing, and other support.  

This planning group should educate themselves about other commissions and survey existing 
forensic science laboratories (including forensic science units, which often include latent print 
services. If oversight responsibilities are recommended, crime laboratory directors and personnel will 
want input into the process so that their concerns are addressed.  

The planning commission should focus on the collection of relevant data concerning forensic 
science services in the state. Items for discussion and drafting of the legislative language to create a 
standing forensic science commission should include the following: 

 A survey of forensic science laboratories. This will necessarily include defining a forensic

science laboratory. Latent print, crime scene and digital evidence units may work outside of
traditional laboratories and may warrant separate definitions. The identification of forensic
laboratories can be accomplished with the assistance of a state crime laboratory directors’
organization.28

 A survey of interested stakeholders and resources.
 Familiarity with existing state facilities. Consideration should be given to participation in

tours of different facilities during meetings.

 Education. This should include aspects of laboratory management and quality assurance and
a review of forensic science commissions that are active in other states. The identification
and review of the literature in this area are also important.

 Opportunities for discussion. The Planning Commission should schedule a few open

hearings at which interested community members, professional organizations and other
stakeholders may make public comment. A dedicated opportunity for crime laboratory
directors and managers and other personnel to address the group should also be provided.

28 For an example of a comprehensive report including survey of laboratories and stakeholders, see the following report:

Legislative Models 

Successful commissions rely on legislative language that provide clear direction concerning the scope 
of members’ responsibilities. In Appendix 2, the reader can access citations to the enabling 
legislation for the current forensic science commissions. Virginia, Washington, North Carolina, 
Rhode Island and the District of Columbia have jurisdiction-wide laboratories. The guidance 
provided to the state laboratories regarding methodologies comes from technical groups (e.g., 
Virginia’s Scientific Advisory Committee and North Carolina’s Forensic Advisory Board), and the 
commission may provide budgetary oversight (Washington).29 A commission should distinguish 
between its agency oversight authority and the need for a laboratory director to manage personnel 
and day-to-day operations. 

The enabling statute should also include language providing for rule-making authority if 
commission’s duties include the investigation of complaints, accreditation or certification/licensure. 
Typically, states will require the commission to provide an annual report, which can be a mechanism 
to advocate for additional resources or other legislative action.  

The statute should describe the composition of the commission, at least in general. When 
membership is contingent on holding a specific office, it should be recognized that continuity can be 
disrupted if too many members’ appointments are subject to political changes. The Texas statute has 
undergone close legislative scrutiny and multiple amendments and may provide a useful example.30 
The statutory authorization for all existing commissions can be found in and additional background 
is provided in Appendix 1 and 2. 

Membership Considerations 

Most frequently, commission members are determined by gubernatorial appointment. In a few 
states, appointments are made by the Attorney General. To minimize the role of political 
considerations, statutes may require specific qualifications for appointees. Often, prosecution or 
defense members can be nominated by their professional organizations. Appointments can also be 
tied to areas of expertise in forensic science. Academic members are often appointed by the dean of 
their institutions, whereas law enforcement members are typically nominated by their departments 
or professional associations. Statutorily-defined qualifications permit the governor to know who 
might most effectively serve on a commission and may allow a nominating organization to have 
meaningful input. The request for nominations further provides an opportunity for the represented 
organizations to learn about the commission’s work. Under this nomination structure, the appointed 
member periodically reports back to his or her organization, increasing the visibility of the 
commission, establishing useful lines of communication, and, thus, enhancing the ultimate buy-in to 
the commission’s work.  

The composition of a commission should relate to the functions for which it has been established. Most 
commissions will include forensic scientists, outside scientists, and stakeholders to be effective, either on one

large commission or on two working commissions/boards/subcommittees New York’s 14-member 
commission, which has a general responsibility to ensure accreditation across all forensic science laboratories, 
also has a distinct DNA subcommittee to oversee the accreditation of DNA laboratories and make binding 
recommendations to the full commission.31  

Numerous commission members and staff stress the importance of a shared vision among 
members. Legislative provisions for term limits, reappointment, and restrictions on reappointment 
are designed to improve the long-term engagement and focus of commission members. Both 
continuity and occasional new members are needed to maintain commissions’ effectiveness. Another 
relevant protection to consider is establishing a requirement that members provide a financial 
disclosure to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest. 

Table 2 is a summary of the membership of current state forensic science commissions. The chart 
does not cover every member in every state but provides a picture of common representatives. 

Specific Stakeholders and Partners 

Key individuals to consider for commission membership and working partnerships associated with 
commissions (e.g., subcommittees, working groups, case review committees and investigative panels) 
include the following: 

 Crime Laboratory Directors – Although only a few laboratory directors may serve as voting
members of a commission, forensic science leaders should attend all state commission
meetings. Forensic scientists are necessary to review and facilitate the adoption of specific
methodologies and protocols.

 Medical Examiner/Coroner – This individual is the central figure in any death investigation
and often manages both his or her office and the toxicology laboratory in his or her facility.
Notably, the TFSC is currently chaired by a Medical Examiner.

 Prosecutor – This person can be either the elected/appointed prosecutor for a jurisdiction
or an assistant but must have strong interest in and experience with forensic science.32
 Defense Attorney – As above, this person must be willing and able to engage on forensic

science issues. 

 Law Enforcement – These individuals bring a customer perspective and may also represent
various crime scene and latent print units that work outside of laboratory environments.
Ideally, they would also be experienced in many collaborative efforts and community
outreach.

 Judiciary – These individuals may be active or retired. Often, active judges have not

participated in forensic science commissions because of ethical considerations. However, a
recent change in Judicial Ethics has clarified that a judge can play an important role
regarding the administration of justice.33

 Academics – Individuals who are affiliated with academic institutions can provide a wealth
of knowledge and resources. Their valuable contributions can include research, input and

31 New York Executive Law § 995-b (2-a). 
32 Several prosecutors’ offices are already engaged in forensic issues and have created Conviction Integrity Units These 

prosecutors are well positioned to engage with the work of forensic science commissions. 

33 See Hammond, Larry A. “The Failure of Forensic Science Reform in Arizona,” Judicature 93 (May-June 2010): 227-

230.

10 

guidance with respect to protocols and methodologies and student volunteer assistance with 
case reviews and research.34 Independent academic scientists contribute different and 
valuable perspectives. Nominations can be made by the deans of institutions. 

 Criminal Justice Agencies – These may include the state administrative agency that acts as
the conduit for federal block grants (including Coverdell grants). In Virginia, a member
from the Virginia State Crime Commission, whose ability to access a prisoner database
represents a useful resource, is included. Criminal justice participation is critical when, for
example, the commission is developing notification protocols regarding results of discipline-
specific case reviews, such as those being performed on hair microscopy in numerous
jurisdictions.

 Departments of Public Health – These agencies are generally responsible for the

accreditation of public laboratories and are very experienced with quality assurance
programs.

 Legislators – These individuals are important during the planning stages and can pave the
way for needed legislation. The identification of legislators with a background and specific
interest in forensic work is critical. In Texas, interested legislators were engaged early in the
process of creating the TSFC and have updated the statute to address emerging needs. 35

her Less-traditional Members and Partners to Consider 
t
O

 Allied Professionals – Health professionals that provide care and expertise in a forensic

setting such as physicians, nurses, dentists, and emergency response providers.

 Statistician - This position is becoming increasingly crucial as research on the validation of
methodologies and computation of error rates continues. All 33 committees of the national
OSAC process include a statistician, so it may be advisable to have that type of expertise
available to a state forensic science commission. Academic institutions may be good sources
for the recruitment of such members.

 Risk Management – The person with this responsibility should be able to work with and
provide aid and resources to governmental agencies. A crime laboratory may not always
keep up with ISO 17025 standards with respect to its equipment, maintenance, facilities or
staffing levels. Any of these may create deficiencies in supervision or quality assurance and,
thereby, put the system at risk. Risk managers can help agency heads to identify these risks
and, at times, provide the funding and resources necessary to minimize them.

 Victim Assistance Representative – This person can provide an important voice and

perspective, particularly when commissions undertake historical case reviews. This type of
review may require notification of the parties involved in a case that has already been
adjudicated. Victim assistance professionals have the relevant experience for these activities.

 Librarian – Some librarians have particular expertise in forensic science and in teaching

professionals how to perform forensic science research. Although each state may not have

34 The National Clearinghouse for Science, Technology and the Law is administratively located at Stetson University. 

One of its primary functions is to create and maintain a database of forensic science research. This work is primarily 
performed by students who receive credit. Virginia’s Forensic Science Board also makes use of students to conduct 
preliminary work on discipline-specific case reviews. 

35 Texas State Senator Juan “Chey” Hinojosa (D-McAllen) is one example of legislative involvement. He has been a 

leader in strengthening forensic services and sponsored HB-1068, which created the TFSC. Delaware’s Director of 
Forensic Science Dr. Rebecca Walker, who is a former state legislator, is another such example. The Delaware 
Forensic Science Commission also benefits from the engagement of the chairs of the Safety and Homeland Security 
Committees of both houses. Both of these legislators also have law enforcement experience.

access to librarians with such knowledge, relationships could be established with librarians 
associated with law schools. “The law librarian is poised to provide resources, create 
partnerships, and help to resolve complex legal research problems.” (Billie Jo Kaufman, 
Associate Dean for Library & Information Resources, Professor of Law, American 
University, Washington College of Law, Pence Law Library.)  

STAFF AND COORDINATION 

Budget, Staff and Partners 

Everyone working with a state commission who was interviewed for this report believes that a 
dedicated budget and staff are necessary for the commission to examine forensic services statewide 
and ensure the level of effectiveness and efficiency required by our criminal justice system. At times, 
the commission must be able to respond appropriately and quickly to investigate issues. This may 
also mean hiring discipline-specific experts to assist in investigations or series of case reviews.  

Staff will be needed to develop and disseminate commission documents, support meetings, and 
manage a commission web presence. Commission members may incur costs for meetings, inquiries 
and other commission business. Although these expenses may not be formally captured under the 
commission budget, the resource expenditures are real and should be anticipated.36 

Many commissions operate with minimal budgets to cover members’ travel costs, staff support, 
website expenses, and investigative expenses. Others, such as the Texas commission, have had 
dedicated budgets and staff since their inception. Established in 2005, the TFSC was set up as an 
independent body but was administratively placed within Sam Houston University for budgetary 
purposes. Initial funding of $250,000 was established in 2007 and provided for a coordinator. The 
current staff of four is expected to increase with the 2015 addition of responsibilities of accreditation 
and the licensing of analysts, which will be required in Texas as of 2019. The current annual budget 
is $500,000. The sustained work of the TCFS can most likely be attributed to a variety of factors. 
However, the funding of the Commission and its ability to hire dedicated staff beginning at its 
inception have certainly contributed.  

When the New York State Commission on Forensic Science was established in 1994, it was 
administratively placed within the New York DCJS. The head of that Division is legislatively 
designated as the chair. Simultaneously, New York formed the Office of Forensic Services (OFS) 
within the DCJS to provide staff support for the Commission. OFS is also charged with the 
maintenance of the DNA database. Several members of that Commission reported that, for several 
weeks prior to their quarterly meeting, the OFS staff expends great effort to prepare for the meeting. 
Staff gathers, prepares and provides all necessary documents and materials for each member of the 

36 Every commission meeting observed involved an additional layer of attendees other than the commission members 

and staff, including general counsel for agencies, most crime laboratory managers in the state and other customers (e.g., 
analysts, lawyers and criminal justice agency personnel) working directly or indirectly on the commissions’ 
subcommittees and projects. This type of attendance can promote effective and efficient communication. 

12 

Commission. In addition, if a complaint is filed regarding an analyst’s misconduct or negligence, 
OFS conducts the investigation.  

Most often, existing staff aid commissions in addition to their other duties. Although such staff may 
assist in initiating planning efforts, full-time, dedicated staff may be needed to supply the ongoing 
support needed by commissions and communication with members, interested professionals and the 
public. 

Both California and Minnesota had a commission or task force, but they were discontinued because 
of a lack of budget and staff, among other issues. The Minnesota Forensic Laboratory Advisory 
Board published its last report in January 2011, but has not met for several years due to an absence 
of funding and staff. In 2012, the California Forensic Science Task Force published its 
recommendations and planned to publish a follow-up report regarding implementation the 
following year. Neither the task force nor a standing commission have been funded. 

General Counsel 

Based on first-hand observations of commission meetings and activities, an actively engaged general 
counsel can help the commission establish a solid reputation and, in general, contribute to the 
commission’s success. First, they can provide important legal guidance to the commission and, thus, 
help keep it on track, effective and efficient. In addition, he or she can act as a conduit for reliable 
communication among all concerned parties. This helps the commission establish a reputation for 
accessibility and develop credibility with the judiciary and stakeholder associations (e.g., prosecutors 
and public defenders).  

A state commission may obtain legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General for the state. 
The individual providing this advice may be a single assistant attorney general (AAG) who will have 
numerous other clients and demands on his or her time. That individual may not have any forensic 
science background. Certainly, this person will provide legal advice regarding matters of statutory 
interpretation. Over time, if the assigned assistant works closely with the commission, can 
participate in educational opportunities, and gains a solid foundation in forensic science and crime 
laboratory issues, he or she could become a real asset.  

The TFSC employs a general counsel who works closely with the Texas Criminal Justice Integrity 
Unit (TCJIU), which is an important partner in the Commission’s endeavor.37 

The general counsel to a state’s primary forensic science laboratory may play a similar role as the 
general counsel to a commission. For instance, the General Counsel to the Virginia DFS is involved 
with the state’s Forensic Science Board, the Scientific Advisory Committee and numerous 
subcommittees involved with the Board’s work. The VDFS General Counsel acts as the face of the 
Department with the public and professional organizations, speaking at judicial and attorney 

37  Judge Barbara Hervey, who serves on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, chairs this group. The TCJIU, which is 

focused on training and other systemic issues in the criminal justice (continued on next page) system, has worked with 
the TFSC on hosting Stakeholder Roundtable Discussions and providing training to hundreds of criminal justice 
professionals. 

13 

conferences about the work of both the Department and of the Board. The Arkansas State Crime 
Laboratory has recently added a general counsel to its staff.  

Role of the Inspector General (IG) 

Some states have an Office of the IG. This Office may, by statute, be responsible for complaints 
relating to state forensic science laboratories. Consideration should be given to developing an 
appropriate relationship between the IG and commission. Often, an IG’s office will lack the 
expertise to perform investigations into technical matters in the forensic laboratory. The relationship 
between the state forensic science commission and the IG’s office should be considered in the 
planning process to clearly define respective roles and responsibility for investigation. New York has 
an IG who has conducted investigations into allegations of professional misconduct and negligence, 
although the IG has established contracts with external experts to support investigations. 

Administrative Home 

A commission should be as independent as possible, but an administrative home can be beneficial to 
limit the infrastructure needed to support commission staff and activities. As discussed previously, 
the TFSC has an administrative home at Sam Houston University. The University provides budget 
and human resource support and office space. This administrative home also represents an 
opportunity for a valuable partnership with the academic institution for research, training and other 
opportunities.  

Maryland’s commission is located within the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Office of 
Quality Control. This state entity has experience with clinical laboratories and is currently developing 
ties with the forensic community. 

Other commissions are structured within state administrative agencies that oversee federal Justice 
Assistance Grant monies or within existing state laboratory or Attorney General Offices. A 
commission should be located where it has the necessary support and opportunities to access 
valuable partners and is sufficiently neutral to establish its credibility and independence. 

Policies and Procedures 

A state forensic science commission will require the adoption of policies and procedures to govern 
its work. Policies and procedures may cover internal processes regarding the development of 
standards, protocols and methodologies and or commission oversight priorities. Clear structure and 
direction are critically important for oversight responsibilities. In particular, the complaint and 
investigation processes must be clear and transparent to ensure public confidence in the review of 
reports of misconduct or professional misconduct. Policies and procedures provide structure and 
guidance to members and the commission chair regarding their roles and responsibilities and the 
order of business of meetings. Roberts Rules of Order or another meeting management system may 
be required by the state or adopted by the commission. 

Procedures should be developed early in the process of creating a commission and should include 
any state requirement regarding open meetings and necessary publications, expectation for meeting 

14 

agendas and how public input may be obtained by the commission. The issue of confidentiality also 
needs to be clarified. Certain personnel matters must remain confidential, at least during the 
pendency of an investigation. However, in general, commission meetings should be public. This 
issue itself is one reason why having a general counsel is helpful for a commission. During any 
meeting, a person must be available to provide guidance on matters that may require closed sessions. 

The TFSC Policies and Procedures represent a working model that has been updated every few 
years as the Commission takes on additional responsibilities.38  

The Need to Educate Members 

Before a commission tackles any of its responsibilities, sufficient time should be set aside to educate 
its members. The members of a state commission (or planning effort) will come to the table with a 
variety of levels of knowledge and experience. For this reason, the Rhode Island State Crime 
Laboratory Commission specifically requires new members to be trained within six months.39 

Topics that should be included in the educational agenda are as follows: ethics, quality assurance, the 
accreditation process, the certification of analysts, national work in progress, crime laboratory tours 
and contemporary issues facing forensic science (e.g., the review of hair microscopy and the lack of 
research in some comparative disciplines). Other interested parties may be included in these training 
sessions, such as the following: 

 crime lab managers or supervisors;
 general counsel to agencies that operate a laboratory;
 assistant attorneys general who will work with the commission;
 legislative members on committees responsible for criminal justice;
 representatives from any state agency responsible for criminal justice grants; and
 prosecutors and public defenders likely to work with the commission.

As much of the orientation material will be familiar to the forensic scientists, they may serve as 
instructors. 

Annual Report 

Publishing an annual report demonstrates to the public that a commission is involved and effective. 
Several existing commissions (i.e., those in Missouri, Virginia and Texas) are required to provide an 
annual report. Other commissions may publish such a report as a matter of practice or post their 
meeting minutes on agency websites. Such documentation is valuable on a variety of levels: 1) It 
provides valuable information to the appointing authority (often the governor) and informs the 
appropriate legislative members of the commission’s work. 2) It helps inform agency heads and 
interested members of the community and represents a critical part of the commission’s 
transparency. 3) It permits members of the commission to observe progress in a very specific way 

38 See the TFSC website at http://www.fsc.texas.gov. 
39 R. I. Gen. Laws, Title 12 Criminal Procedure, § 12-1.1-8. (2006) 

15 

and helps to orient new members. Finally, 4) it can serve to support requests for appropriate funding 
for crime laboratories. 

Website 

Having a dedicated commission website elevates its visibility and transparency and provides the 
public with easy access to information. Features of a helpful website include: accessibility (easy to 
find); general description of the commission (structure, vision, mission, policy/procedures); 
information about upcoming meetings; live streaming of current meetings and archived videos of 
prior meetings; details of the complaint process, including a downloadable complaint form; 
availability of final reports upon investigation completion; and list of commissioners and relevant 
points of contact. Unique features include Virginia’s development of a method of controlled access 
to Certificates of Analysis which is due to be piloted in 2017. 

Meeting Schedule and Commission Maintenance 

Enabling statues generally provide minimum meeting requirements (often quarterly) for 
commissions. States can consider having meetings at different laboratories, particularly early during 
the planning effort, to assist in the education of all members. Some commissions stream meetings 
on a website and archive a recording to maximize the engagement of other professionals and 
interested community members. Some commissions (e.g., New Mexico) will allow additional 
meetings if the membership requests it. These avenues encourage greater involvement by other 
stakeholders and the community and add to the perception of transparency. 

Most often, although reimbursement of actual or per diem costs is provided, statutes do not permit 
additional monetary compensation. Developing a consistent meeting schedule, selecting meeting 
locations with ample parking, limiting the length of meetings, providing materials in advance and 
giving members the ability to attend meetings by telephone are all aspects that have helped with 
continuity, engagement, and members working well together.  

COMMISSION VISION AND MISSION 

Values 

Consistent themes regarding the 
composition of commissions and 
their values are summarized. Broadly 
expressed thoughts of commission 
members include: 

 “For our Commission or any Commission on Forensic Science to be 
effective, it is essential that members of the commission be prepared 
to come to the table with a willingness to put any personal agendas 
and allegiances aside and work with others.” 

Richard Alpert, Assistant Criminal District Attorney, 
Tarrant County and member, TFSC

 Members must commit to work on a common mission, not their own self-interest.
 Transparency and confidentiality must be balanced as necessary and appropriate.
 Participation in the commission cannot be for personal gain.
 Trust and respect are critical.
 The overriding goal must be what is best for forensic science.

16 

These are the hallmarks of a valuable and effective commission. The state legislature or appointing 
authority may choose to establish key values for the commission’s business to contribute to a long-
term vision that guides the members.  

Transparency 

Transparency is an important element to build confidence among the public and the criminal justice 
system regarding the professional and objective forensic work performed in a state. Indeed, it 
permits anyone who is interested to be informed and follow the work of a commission, observe the 
actual discussions on issues, and see what corrective action is taken. It provides a mechanism to 
assure the community that the commission has real substance. 

However, merely stating that the process will be transparent is not sufficient, and there are 
numerous aspects and levels of transparency. For example, transparency will often mean some 
online presence for the commission, including publications, web broadcast and archive of meetings, 
and accreditation information. Figure 1 is a continuum of transparency in the context of a state 
commission, beginning with posting of meetings and agendas and moving to higher levels of 
perceived transparency.  

Figure 1. Possible Actions to Increase Transparency 

Because the clear goal of the commission is to encourage good science, achieving an appropriate 
balance regarding disclosures and transparency is critically important. The commission should 
encourage the disclosure of problems and investigate them within its purview. However, laboratory 
directors and analysts may not cooperate as fully in an environment that feels punitive. For example, 

17 

total transparency that includes the identities of individual analysts may do more harm than 
good. The question then becomes how a commission can foster protected disclosure. Crime 
laboratory leaders are working to produce a culture in which random or systematic errors are 
understood to be a part of every physical measurement, including every forensic examination. 
Human errors should be expected and used to improve training and procedures in the laboratory. 
The state forensic science commission needs to contribute to a positive culture in crime laboratories 
while maintaining its role as an independent investigating body.  

Assessing Capabilities and Needs 

Many commissions are charged with assessing the capabilities and needs of existing state crime 
laboratories. This is a natural first step that helps commission members become acquainted with the 
facilities, managers and issues. One of the first tasks in this process is to determine a precise and 
useful definition of a crime laboratory or unit.40 Many forensic science units will handle latent print 
comparisons, crime scene investigation, or digital evidence outside the traditional crime laboratory 
setting. Because of their size or location, these units may not be accredited, although they may fall 
under a state commission’s responsibility under its authorizing law. Other critical terms that must be 
defined include ‘forensic analyst’ and ‘forensic analysis’. 

When identifying all their forensic science laboratories, some states have directed surveys to all state 
law enforcement agencies.41 Such surveys can include questions about the types of analysis 
performed, number of personnel, accreditation status of the laboratory, certification of personnel 
and facilities. It is equally important to consider including in the survey an opportunity for the 
agency to report any issues it is facing relating to its crime laboratory. The commission may also 
obtain reports from crime laboratory directors regarding budgets and the need for space, equipment 
and resources. The commission may also examine casework resource requirements and backlogs 
through a partnership with an academic institution. This research would quantify the minimum 

40 Texas Article 38.35 (a)(4) provides the following: 

The term ‘forensic analysis’ is defined as a medical, chemical, toxicological, ballistic, or other expert examination or 
test performed on physical evidence, including DNA evidence, for the purpose of determining the connection of the 
evidence to a criminal action. The term includes an examination or test requested by a law enforcement agency, 
prosecutor, criminal suspect or defendant, or court. The term does not include:

community supervision or parole and conducted by or under contract with a community supervision and
corrections department, the parole division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, or the Board of
Pardons and Paroles; or
an expert examination or test conducted principally for the purpose of scientific research, medical practice, civil
or administrative litigation, or other purpose unrelated to determining the connection of physical evidence to a
criminal action.”

requirements necessary to do the job that the criminal justice stakeholders and community expect 
crime laboratories to do. A commission may enable the adoption of new methodologies or 
requirements for accreditation and certification in this manner by a thorough, ongoing 
understanding of resource constraints and needs. 

Data collection and analysis can begin a process of mutual collaboration that can contributes to 
increasing and maintaining laboratory efficiency, effectiveness and quality. Many states already have 
a crime laboratory managers’ association and may have access to this information. The commission 
may use this and other information to determine the resources needed for crime laboratories to 
deliver reliable, scientific results. A commission’s independence provides additional justification and 
support for a crime laboratory’s request for equipment and personnel submitted to the funding 
authority. 42  

One resource that is available to crime laboratory managers is Project FORESIGHT at West 
Virginia University. This NIJ-funded project collects data from more than 100 participating 
laboratories, and in return, the laboratories receive a customized report comparing their 
performance in each forensic investigative area to industry standards free of charge.43 Additional 
laboratory management publications and resources are also available through this project. 

Stewardship 

Crime laboratory directors strive for excellence. They want to practice good science, have 
appropriate research results to support their methodologies, maintain professional excellence and 
move the state of forensic services forward. Many state commissions have responsibility for 
stewardship of crime laboratories in an oversight role. Oversight may include: 1) providing for state 
accreditation by piggybacking on an existing accreditation body (e.g., New York and Texas), 
2) providing an additional and separate licensing process (e.g., Maryland), and 3) receiving and
investigating complaints of serious professional negligence and misconduct.

When a separate audit (in addition to that completed by an accreditation entity) is not required by a 
state, oversight is accomplished primarily through the commission’s review of reports regarding 
misconduct and professional negligence. Crime laboratories are required to send those reports to 
their accreditation entity.  

State-level accreditation may be considered after a commission reviews the forensic laboratories’ 
past performance.44 Texas adds an additional layer of oversight by administering a self-disclosure 
program that permits the TFSC to review all reports of misconduct and professional negligence in a

timely manner. The U.K. combines its Forensic Science Regulator with a Forensic Science Advisory 
Council, which was created in 2007, to provide a more formalized model.45 “This can be viewed as 
the culmination of a new approach to quality in forensic science which can be traced back to 
numerous high profile miscarriages of justice in the 1990s.”46 

Complaints and Investigations 

A state forensic science commission may be the entity assigned to investigate complaints filed by 
individuals or attorneys and the self-disclosure of professional misconduct and negligence by crime 
laboratories themselves. States and crime laboratories receiving Coverdell grants must have an 
external and independent governmental entity to investigate allegations of serious negligence and 
misconduct. State commissions may fulfill this requirement.  

Prior to accepting any complaint, decisions should be made regarding the required process, including the 
creation of a complaint form, development of the investigative process, and considerations relating to 
notification and issues of confidentiality. The complaint process should be detailed and part of a 
commission’s published policies and procedures.  

Complaint forms may be published on a commission’s website. In Texas, once jurisdiction is 
determined by the full commission based on the recommendation of the Complaint Review 
Subcommittee, complaints are investigated by a panel of three commissioners. If an independent 
analyst in the discipline under consideration appears necessary, additional funding may be required 
to retain that individual.  

After a complaint has been concluded, if professional misconduct or negligence is found, a decision 
regarding who is to be notified of the finding must be made. At times, prosecutors and defense 
attorneys must be notified, in addition to the complainant. Depending on the nature of the 
complaint and the result of the investigation, the information may be subject to discovery.47 A 
complaint disposition form is used by Texas and includes the following language: “As described in 
FSC policies and procedures §4.0(d), a finding is not a comment upon the guilt or innocence of any 
individual and is not necessarily a basis for relief in litigation or in any other forum. Any final report 
itself is not prima facie evidence of the information or findings contained in the report.”48 

Accreditation 

Several states require the accreditation of crime laboratories. This requirement may be part of the 
duties and responsibilities of a commission by statute, or it may result from legislation that makes 
accreditation a necessary requirement for the introduction of reports or testimony in a criminal

trial.49 Some states that require accreditation (i.e., New York, Texas, Missouri and Maryland) allow 
this requirement to be satisfied primarily through an independent accreditation body.50  

The state may require that laboratories submit all correspondence with the accrediting agency to the 
commission. This would alert the commission to the need for corrective action or allegations of 
misconduct or professional negligence. The commission may examine if systemic issues exist, 
investigate specific incidents or take any other appropriate action. The knowledge that a review body 
exists that will ask questions when necessary increases the community’s confidence in the system.  

Today, most state crime laboratories (approximately 85 percent) are accredited. Nevertheless, 
whether accreditation should be part of a commission’s responsibilities is worthy of discussion.51,52 
If a state is to require its own accreditation process, then its standards should be sufficiently 
different to warrant a separate audit and must not merely duplicate the accreditation entity’s audit. 
Commissioners must recognize that accreditation by external accreditation bodies is expensive and 
that the personnel resources required for such audits constitute additional costs to the laboratories. 

Although most state and large crime laboratories are currently accredited, many forensic science 
units — e.g., latent print analysis, digital evidence units, firearms operability, breath alcohol and crime 
scene investigators— are contained within police departments and are, in general, not accredited. 
Many smaller law enforcement agencies may lack a crime laboratory but maintain a latent print and 
CSI unit. These units are often not accredited because compliance with ISO 17025 standards (the 
general requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories) may not be 
possible.53 Instead, some agencies have such units accredited under ISO 17020 (the general criteria 
for the operation of various types of bodies performing inspection). Another strategy to handle 
these smaller forensic units is to have all analysts certified, which can provide a certain level of 
confidence in the reliability of the work conducted. 

Maryland has a unique program that requires all laboratories and latent units (state law does not yet 
cover CSI units) to be licensed. This state licensure is one of several requirements for a laboratory’s 
accreditation. This strategy permits more frequent audits than required by the accreditation body. 
Any disclosures by the laboratory required by the accreditation body are maintained and then 
reviewed by the state annually. The four non-accredited latent print units in the state can still gain 
state licensure through an assessment and audit process, and on-site visits are conducted every three 

49 Texas Code of Criminal Procedures, Art. 38.35(c);. 
50 Typically, accreditation is achieved through ASCLD/LAB, which requires laboratories to meet ISO/IEC 17025:2005 
requirements and applicable ASCLD/LAB-International supplemental requirements. ASCLD. (n.d.). ANSI-ASQ 
National Accreditation Board (ANAB) is now the home of ASCLD/LAB. Retrieved from http://www.ascld-lab.org/ 
Other accrediting bodies include A2LA, the American Board of Forensic Toxicology, ANAB and the College of 
American Pathologists.

accreditation of forensic laboratories. Retrieved from 
http://www.ncsl.org/Documents/cj/AccreditationOfForensicLaboratories.pdf 

52 The accreditation process may include review of internal quality assurance programs, internal audits, management 
reviews, proficiency testing, on-site assessments (every four years), biannual site-visits, nonconformance reports, 
corrective actions, root-cause analysis, and annual summaries. Often a state commission receives copies of these 
documents at the time they are filed or annually.

years. This program is operated by the Maryland DHMH, Office of Health Care Quality, which 
assesses all medical laboratories in Maryland. Although this may seem an unusual fit, the personnel 
have experience in medical laboratories and quality assurance. Additionally, they work with the 
Forensic Licensing Advisory Board (FLAB) in the development and implementation of standards 
for state licensure.54 

State-level accreditation may require more frequent oversight than would typically exist with an 
independent accreditation entity. Whereas independent accreditation audit teams typically visit every 
five years, a state’s own accreditation process can result in a more frequent and visible relationship. 
This may increase transparency, accountability and public confidence. Furthermore, the commission 
can consider any additional accreditation requirements it feels are necessary and appropriate. 

A commission will also need to identify any private laboratories, three out of 10 public laboratories 
outsource some work.55 In Maryland, the state will issue a letter of acceptance to private laboratories 
if they are determined to be qualified per FLAB requirements. In Texas, the accreditation process 
includes private laboratories.  

Certification/Licensure 

A state forensic science commission may oversee requirements for the certification of forensic 
analysts, as is currently being advocated at the federal level.56 No one certification exists for all 
disciplines; instead, certifications are discipline specific. Some disciplines, such as digital forensics, 
do not currently have a single universally accepted certification, and different certifications can be 
obtained from different entities and from the manufacturers of specific software tools.  

The requirements for specific discipline certifications vary widely and may require years of 
experience before an analyst may even apply. Additionally, certification tests may vary significantly in 
cost and level of difficulty. Any certification process would be in addition to existing external and 
internal proficiency testing undertaken by laboratory analysts as part of accreditation and quality 
assurance protocols.  

Requiring certification across the board is associated with other challenges, including union 
contracts and management operational issues (e.g., what must be done when an employee fails to 
maintain his or her certification).  

Many laboratories encourage but do not require certification. They may support it through 
incentives, such as paying for the certification or making it a prerequisite for salary increases and 
promotions. A commission must consider these issues before any statute is enacted that requires 
certification. For example, when adding a licensing program to the TFSC’s responsibilities, the 
Texas legislature recognized that it would take time for a committee of scientists to create the

from the DHMH. Currently, its members are considering expanding or creating another group to include more 
laboratory directors and other customers to discuss issues of mutual concern.

requirements for such a program and provided a three-year time frame for the transition.57 North 
Carolina has required the certification of analysts working at the NCSCL since June 2012.58 

Retroactive Reviews 

Many states have initiated statewide reviews of certain cases or classes of forensic casework. This has 
happened in recent years regarding DNA mixture interpretation, hair microscopy and serology. The 
state commission may be well positioned to conduct these types of retroactive reviews. 

The commission may appoint a subcommittee to identify scientists and appropriate stakeholders to 
meet and determine the methodology for retroactive reviews. These reviews reveal an important 
attribute of commissions: They should be flexible enough to establish subcommittees for specific 
projects/reviews and to request assistance from other professional scientists and stakeholders as 
appropriate for a project.  

As a specific example, when the Virginia Forensic Science Board begins a discipline-specific case 
review, members of the Board and the Scientific Advisory Committee meet with other identified 
stakeholders and the general counsel to the Virginia DFS. The Virginia State Crime Commission and 
the Virginia Indigent Defense Commission are included on these review panels. The Virginia State 
Crime Commission can readily identify any defendants who are currently prisoners within the state 
correctional system. Additionally, investigators for the Virginia Indigent Defense Commission can 
assist in locating defendants or family members when necessary. This is a further example of how 
the early identification of assets and resources is very important to state commissions. 

Texas has taken on several such reviews. For example, in collaboration with the State Fire Marshall, 
the state altered the use of methodologies in arson investigations. “In a December 7, 2015 
statement, the International Association for Arson Investigators (IAAI), the largest professional 
organization of fire investigators in the world, endorsed Texas’ actions as a model for multidiscipline 
science review panels. Specifically, the IAAI supported Texas’ independent, multidisciplinary Science 
Advisory Workgroup. This is the group that conducted the postconviction review of arson 
convictions where there was a substantial and credible allegation that those convictions were based 
on outdated science or methodology. The IAAI encourages every state to follow the Texas model 
for review and, through IAAI’s Public Agency Advisory Committee, aids jurisdictions to help locate 
resources for reviews of the science and methodology underlying arson convictions.” For more 
information, see the white paper on this topic created by the TFSC.59  

On additional aspect of these case reviews, those regarding trial transcripts, is that the review team 
may also identify errors made by prosecutors and defense counsel regarding overstating the forensic 
analyst’s testimony in arguments to the jury. This is merely one example in which a state commission

would be in a good position to discuss systemic issues regarding the use of forensic science by 
stakeholder. 

Training and Education 

The NAS Report was clear on its recommendation for the education of prosecutors, defense 
attorneys and judges in forensic science. Some examples of educational efforts are as follows: 

 Arizona does not have a statutorily created commission. It has, however, had a Forensic
Science Advisory Committee since 2007. Operating under the authority of the Attorney
General, this Committee includes dozens of stakeholders who attend meetings several times
a year. In 2011, the Committee held its first Forensic Science Academy at the Maricopa
County Medical Examiner’s Office, and both prosecutors and defense attorneys were
invited to attend. Since that time, the Committee has held a Basic Academy, an Advanced
Academy and a Driving under the Influence (DUI), Domestic Violence, and DNA (3-D)
Academy. Monies gained through tuition for the academies are used to bring in speakers
from out of state to lecture on topics to provide continuing education to scientists several
times a year. The Committee also works with Arizona’s Judicial College to provide forensic
science training for judges. To date, more than 9,800 hours of training have been provided
to more than 1,100 individuals.

 Montana has a Forensic Science Laboratory Advisory Board that was established as a
Coverdell-required independent investigative body. Although this Board generally only
meets annually, it performs community outreach and training, including open houses hosted
by the state laboratory for the public. Personnel also deliver numerous presentations and
training to stakeholder organizations, including the sheriffs’ association, chiefs of police,
defense organization, county attorneys, judges and justices of the peace.

 The TFSC routinely works with the TCJIU as a partner to provide training for

stakeholders.

 Virginia’s Forensic Science Board and DFS jointly run a Forensic Academy for crime scene
investigators from law enforcement agencies that submit evidence to crime laboratories for
analysis. The CSIs can participate annually in continued training and engage in an alumni
association. These activities are designed to improve collaboration between local agencies
and the DFS, which handles most forensic analysis in the state.

Other Responsibilities 

Many commissions use the scientists involved on a commission or subcommittee to assist in the 
review of new methodologies prior to their implementation. Such reviews may be organized through 
a state’s forensic laboratory director’s organization. The reviews may be connected to national-level 
efforts, including the work of the OSACs. In some cases, commissions may assign a commission 
member or staff person to act as the conduit to national reform efforts, other state commissions or 
professional organizations in the forensic sciences. These lines of communication may facilitate the 
transmittal of standards and guidelines from national programs to state and local forensic scientists.  

24 

Several states take on specific, ongoing projects regarding the identification of human remains.60 
Again, these projects require multidisciplinary involvement and benefit greatly from academic 
partnerships. Dialogue with federal agencies regarding requirements for DNA entries into databases 
and comparisons is crucial, and as for other projects, commission/boards are appropriate 
responsible institutions. The Rio Grande Project in Texas represents a commission taking on such a 
responsibility. Additionally, state commissions represent appropriate multidisciplinary bodies to 
participate in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) program that 
provides NIJ support to assist in the use of DNA technology for missing persons and the 
identification of human remains.61 

CONCLUSION 

With 10 states having legislatively established commissions, several others with informal boards and 
still others (i.e., Massachusetts) considering the creation of a forensic science commission, sufficient 
momentum and interest likely exist to create a National Association of Forensic Science 
Commissions. Such an association would facilitate the networking of commissions regarding issues 
that arise. Additionally, conferences would provide an opportunity to disseminate information on 
best practices regarding websites, policies and procedures, operational considerations, retroactive 
discipline case reviews and various other issues as they emerge. They also could serve as productive 
venues for subsets of commissions, such as crime laboratory directors, general counsel, statisticians 
and staff. States interested in creating a state commission would benefit from technical assistance, 
such as best practices, model policies and procedures and guided discussions during planning efforts 
to identify how best to meet specific states’ needs. 

Smaller states may consider combining their resources through a regional approach. Such an 
approach would be like that followed by North Carolina, whose board invited several scientists 
working in other states to participate. This relatively broad-based group provides the state with 
extensive expertise and resources. 

Recognizing that more than 90 percent of crime laboratory services are provided by state and local 
laboratories; states are in an ideal position to impact the quality of forensic work and enhance the 
public confidence in the results. State forensic science commissions can provide stewardship and 
support to forensic science laboratories within their jurisdictions. State commissions can bring 
together forensic scientists, crime laboratory managers and customers in the criminal justice system. 
This multidisciplinary group can then identify and solve issues, learn from other states and foster 
continuous improvement.  

This group of professionals focused on enhancing forensic work should ideally engage in a planning 
effort to describe and define the role and responsibilities their state commission should have. This 
planning effort also initiates the process of relationship building and the education of its participants 
to best identify current and potential issues facing crime laboratories and how they can be most 
appropriately addressed.

25 

Because many of the duties and responsibilities of a state forensic science commission will have 
public interest, the transparency of its operations will increase public confidence regarding the 
integrity of the commission’s process, forensic evidence and the criminal justice system. When the 
level of broad-based, proactive collaboration on a commission and its subcommittees is higher and 
when the public is more informed on the work being done, financial support and greater public 
awareness and support for laboratories will more likely be forthcoming.

Arkansas 

In 1981, Arkansas took legislative action to remove the state laboratory from the Department of 
Public Safety and make it an independent agency. It is the primary lab for the state and accepts 
public defender cases. In 1991, Arkansas created an eight- member State Crime Laboratory Board as 
a policy board. Its membership - primarily considered to be its “customer” base - is tasked with 
prescribing responsibilities of the lab’s executive director and the appointment of the state’s medical 
examiner. The Board is authorized to accept gifts, grants or funds and enters into contracts. It has 
policy-making powers as to the operation of the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory. 

Eight members who are gubernatorial appointments with seven-year terms: 

 Active judge;
 Practicing lawyer;
 County Sheriff;
 Chief of police;
 Prosecutor;
 Two physicians; and
 Member-at-large.

Arizona 

Arizona’s Forensic Science Advisory Committee was not statutorily created. Instead, in 2008, the 
Arizona Attorney General created this group, which is administered by the Attorney General’s 
Office. This Committee is a relatively large group, and its membership includes all crime laboratory 
directors; representatives from the prosecution, defense, judiciary, Justice Project, law enforcement, 
and Arizona Criminal Justice Council; and a victim advocate. It has been chaired since its inception 
by a retired judge. The Committee has created a Forensic Science Academy to train prosecutors, 
defense attorneys, crime laboratory analysts and judges. It has also recently begun a hair microscopy 
review working group. The Committee operates informally and serves as the independent 
investigative body for Coverdell grants.62 The Office of the Attorney General provides staff support 
through a part-time coordinator.

and units of local government to help improve the quality and timeliness of forensic science and medical examiner

Delaware 

California enacted legislation in 2007 creating the California Crime Laboratory Review Task Force to 
“make recommendations as to how best to configure, fund, and improve the delivery of state and 
local crime laboratory services in the future.” 63 A comprehensive survey was conducted and 
numerous public meetings held over two years at different crime laboratories. A comprehensive 
report was issued in 2009 recommending, among other items, the certification of analysts and 
accreditation of laboratories through existing accreditation bodies. They also recommended the 
creation of a statewide entity, stating that the most effective method of handling with the identified 
laboratory issues would be by means of inter-jurisdiction coordination and advocacy at the state 
level. The Task Force was to issue a supplemental report the following year. However, this report 
was never published, and the group no longer meets. No state commission was ever created.64 

Delaware created its Forensic Science Commission in 2015. The mission of this Commission is to 
provide oversight and guidance to the Division of Forensic Science, which is within the Department 
of Safety and Homeland Security. Its 10 members include customers (i.e., law enforcement, 
prosecution and defense), legislators and forensic scientists.  

Ten members, including some gubernatorial appointments: 

 Secretary of Department of Health & Social Service;
 Attorney General (or designee);
 Chief Defender (or designee);
 State Senate–Chair, Homeland Security;
 House–Chair, Homeland Security;
 Representative of the Chiefs of Police;
 State Troopers Association or FOP (with forensic science training; list provided by the
Secretary of Department of Safety & Homeland Security and the governor); and

 Two members with forensic science expertise (gubernatorial appointments).

District of Columbia 

District of Columbia provided for two advisory and oversight bodies when it created the DCDFS in 
2011. The Science Advisory Board is composed of nine experienced scientists, and the Director and 
Deputy Director of the DCDFS serve as ex officio, non-voting members. This Board serves to 
review and recommend matters related to the scientific operation of the Department. The second 
board is the Stakeholder Council, which consists of designated positions and has the Deputy Mayor 
for Public Safety serving as its chairperson. Its duties consist of identifying issues regarding the 
delivery of services and the effectiveness of DCDFS. It also advises the Mayor and the D.C. Council 
on matters relating to the Department.

Illinois 

Indiana 

Maryland 

Illinois established a Laboratory Advisory Committee in 2005 to make recommendations regarding 
accreditation and quality assurance. This group has not met for the last five years. 

Indiana statutorily created a Commission on Forensic Sciences in 1959. This Commission was 
intended to establish and maintain a laboratory for scientific research and experimentation. 
However, this commission no longer appears to meet. 

Maryland developed a different model in 2009. In this state, the legislation placed oversight 
responsibility for the regulation of accredited and non-accredited forensic laboratories under the 
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH), Office of Health Care Quality. This 
Department is the agency that regulates all clinical laboratories. The legislature focused on requiring 
crime laboratories to meet requirements relating to quality assurance and laboratory management 
and administration and to obtain a state license to conduct forensic work. The Maryland Forensic 
Laboratory Advisory Committee was established to advise the DHMH in the implementation of a 
licensing program. By 2012, it had published the program regulations and had begun licensing 
forensic laboratories using a “crosswalk” to bridge state-developed requirements with existing 
accreditation programs used by the laboratories. It requires frequent on-site survey visits and audits 
proficiency testing and the disclosure of professional misconduct or negligence. All full-service 
crime laboratories are accredited. Four non-accredited latent print laboratories, which are based in 
police departments, have also gained state licensure. These laboratories require a full on-site survey 
every three years in addition to annual proficiency testing and internal on-site audit reviews.  

The Forensic Sciences Advisory Committee consists of ten members who are mostly gubernatorial 
appointments and have three-year terms: 

 DHMH, Director of Laboratories Administration (or designee);
 DHMH, Director of Office of Health Care Quality (or designee);
 American Society for Clinical Laboratory Science;
 University of Maryland School of Medicine, Department of Medical Research and

Technology;

 A2LA;
 AAFS;
 ASCLD/LAB;
 Director of a state forensic laboratory;
 Director of a county forensic laboratory; and
 Director of a municipal forensic laboratory.

Minnesota 

Minnesota had a very active Commission on Forensic Science that was created in 2006 for Coverdell 
compliance. This Commission’s early work included a survey of the forensic work performed in the 
state, although there was a perception that this function was not well-defined. The members were all 
voluntary and lacked funding or formal authority or power. By 2012, this Commission was no longer 
meeting. 

Missouri 

Missouri’s Crime Laboratory Review Commission, which was created in 2009 within the 
Department of Public Safety, is a very active commission and met nine times in 2015. This group 
has only five members: the Deputy Director for the Department of Public Safety, a crime laboratory 
manager, a chief of police, a prosecutor and a defense attorney. 

Its mission is broad: It is to provide an independent review of state-funded laboratories and (“shall 
have the power to”) do the following: 1) access capabilities and needs, 2) authorize independent 
investigations into allegations of serious negligence or misconduct, 3) appoint investigative teams, 4) 
recommend changes for agencies found to be negligent, 5) assess the capabilities and needs of 
laboratories regarding quality and timely services, and 6) issue reports to the Director of the 
Department of Public Safety.  

This Commission’s annual reports summarize activities and suggestions to improve the reviewed 
laboratories. As of 2012, Missouri law requires that laboratory reports and testimony must be from 
accredited laboratories. This accreditation is to be provided by an organization approved by the 
Department of Public Safety. 65 

The Crime Lab Review Commission has five members, most of whom are gubernatorial 
appointments: 

 Director of the Department of Public Safety;
 Prosecutor;
 Defense attorney;
 Senior manager from an accredited crime laboratory; and
 Member of law enforcement in a management position.

Montana 

New York 

Montana has a Forensic Science Laboratory Advisory Board that was not statutorily created but was, 
instead, created as a Coverdell-required independent investigative body. Although this Board 
generally only meets annually, its major activities include community outreach and training.  

In 1994, New York became the first state commission mandating accreditation of forensic labs as an 
important foundation of sound forensic work. The legislation created the New York State 
Commission on Forensic Science to develop a program of accreditation for all forensic laboratories. 
This accreditation includes approval of laboratory methodologies and the establishment of minimum 
qualifications for laboratory directors. The goals of this enabling legislation included increasing the 
“effectiveness, efficiency, reliability and accuracy” of forensic work and promoting increased 
cooperation and coordination among forensic laboratories and other agencies in the criminal justice 
system. 66 The statute’s objectives also identified issues relating primarily to DNA, including the need 
to ensure compatibility with other state and federal laboratories to the extent necessary to share 
information, data and results of forensic analyses and tests. Administrative responsibility for the 
Commission was placed within the Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS), and the Office of 
Forensic Services was created within that Division. This office also oversees the DNA database. The 
Commission has 14 members who are scientists, criminal justice agency heads, academics and 
attorneys (both prosecution and defense.) The DNA Subcommittee, which was created at the same 
time as the Commission, was given sole authority over DNA laboratory accreditation and 
methodologies. This seven-member subcommittee is composed of all scientists with legislatively 
defined specific areas of expertise. 

The State Commission on Forensic Science has 14 members, most of whom are gubernatorial 
appointments, have three-year terms, and are subject to reappointment: 

  Commissioner of the New York DCJS (serves as Chair); 
  Ex officio Commissioner of the Department of Health (or designee); 
  Chair New York state crime laboratory committee; 
  Director of a forensic laboratory in New York;  
  Director of the Office of Forensic Services, DCJS; 
  Two scientists with experience in laboratory standards or quality assurance (from the list 

provided by the Commissioner of Health); 

  Law enforcement (from the list provided by the Commissioner of Criminal Justice Services);

 Public criminal defense bar (from the list provided by the public defense organization);
 Private criminal defense bar (from the list provided by the defense attorney organization);
 Two members-at-large: one recommended by the president of the senate and one

recommended by the speaker of the assembly; and

 Attorney or judge with a background in privacy issues and biomedical ethics (from the list

provided by the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals).

The statutorily created DNA Subcommittee includes seven scientists, and its chair is appointed by 
the Commission Chair. This Subcommittee is the sole authority on DNA laboratory accreditation 
and methodologies.

North Carolina 

North Carolina created the North Carolina Forensic Advisory Board in 2011. This Board consists of 
a group of scientists and academics, many from outside of the state, who advise the North Carolina 
State Crime Laboratory (NCSCL). Its members are appointed by the Attorney General. The 
composition of the forensic disciplines within the committee is specified in its enabling statute.  

Administratively housed within the North Carolina Department of Justice Office of the Attorney 
General, the Board reviews new scientific programs and methods, protocols for testing, guidelines 
for court testimony and qualification standards for laboratory scientists. North Carolina provides 
community outreach through laboratory tours and observance of North Carolina’s Forensic Science 
Week. It is also very transparent, providing all laboratory case files to its customers via a secure web-
based program. Its Quality Assurance Manual, policies and procedures accreditation materials, and 
audit reports are all available online, as are its Annual Reports to the Joint Legislative Oversight 
Committee on Justice & Public Safety. The North Carolina statute provides that complaints are 
received and investigated by an ombudsman. 

The Forensic Science Advisory Board has fifteen members appointed by the Attorney General with 
four-year, staggered terms: 

 State Crime Laboratory Director;
 Forensic scientist with experience in quality assurance;
 Chief Medical Examiner;
 Forensic scientist in molecular biology;
 Forensic scientist in population genetics;
 Scientists in forensic chemistry;
 Scientists in forensic biology;
 Forensic scientist in trace evidence;
 Scientist in forensic toxicology;

 Member of IAI;
 Member of the Association of Firearms and Tool Mark Examiners;
 Member of International Association for Chemical Testing or American Chemical Society;
 Member of ASCLD;
 Member of AAFS; and
 Member of American Statistical Association.

This state requires accreditation. The North Carolina General Statute states that accreditation shall 
be by an “accrediting body that requires conformance to forensic specific requirements and which is 
a signatory to the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) Mutual Recognition 
Arrangement for Testing.” (ISO 17025 for testing laboratories). The current accrediting body for the 
NCSCL is ANAB. 

North Carolina requires individual certification, and the North Carolina General Statute states: 
“Forensic Scientists I, II, and III, forensic science supervisors, and forensic scientist managers at the 
State Crime Laboratory shall be required to obtain individual certification consistent with 
international and ISO standards within 18 months of the date the scientist becomes eligible to seek 
certification according to the standards of the certifying entity…” There is no certification 
requirement for local laboratories.

Oklahoma 

Oklahoma has a Forensic Sciences Improvement Task Force hosted by the Oklahoma District 
Attorneys Council. This Task Force operates as the Coverdell independent investigative body and 
the committee for the Justice Assistance Grants to Oklahoma. The Task Force provides state plans 
for forensic laboratories to improve the quality, timeliness and credibility of forensic services. The 
Task Force also holds an Open House for attorneys and the public to improve their understanding 
of the forensic services in the state. As of 2005, Oklahoma requires the accreditation of public crime 
laboratories: 74 OK Stat § 74-150.37 (2014). This statute exempts alcohol/breath, CSI, digital, crime 
scene reconstruction, marijuana and latent print analysis. For latent print analysis to be admitted into 
evidence, it must be conducted by an International Association for Identification (IAI)-certified 
examiner. 

Rhode Island 

In 1978, Rhode Island was the first state to create a State Crime Laboratory Commission to oversee 
the state crime laboratory, which is located at the University of Rhode Island. This statutory 
authority is broad and specifically provides for oversight, including goals, priorities, budget, and 
monitoring and evaluation of the general operation of the state crime laboratory. The legislative 
purpose focused on the need for goals, objectives and standards for crime scene investigation (CSI) 
and the coordination of the state and local law enforcement agencies. The powers and duties 
include, among others, the budget functions of applying for grants and accepting appropriated 
funds. 

36 

The commission itself has five members, two of whom are ex officio. They are tasked with 
recommending legislation to the governor and legislature. The administration of the state crime 
laboratory, including budget and personnel, is the responsibility of an Executive Secretary, who is 
the Dean of the College of Pharmacy at the University of Rhode Island. This Executive Secretary 
provides reports of these operations to the commission.  

The State Crime Laboratory Commission has five members who are gubernatorial appointments, 
have two-year terms and are subject to reappointment: 

 Attorney General–ex officio;
 Superintendent of state police–ex officio;
 Rhode Island Police Chiefs Association representative; and
 Two public members.
 Statute: Title 12 Criminal Procedures, Chapter 12-1.1 et seq.

Texas 

Texas currently has what some describe as the most robust state commission. This characterization 
is based on its staff (which currently includes general counsel and three other positions), budget and 
breadth of responsibilities. Created in 2005 as an oversight body, one of the Texas Forensic Science 
Commission’s (TFSC) primary responsibilities is to investigate complaints of professional 
misconduct and negligence. The initial enabling legislation also provides for a program of self-
disclosure through which all laboratories, facilities or entities that conduct forensic analyses report 
professional negligence or misconduct to the Commission. (§ 4(a)(m2) Texas Code of Criminal 
Procedure.) With this focus on oversight for forensic services in Texas and the passage of an 
omnibus bill on related criminal justice issues, the legislature also required forensic laboratories to be 
accredited and placed administrative responsibility for that program within the Department of 
Public Safety. Included in this legislation was the requirement that laboratories be accredited for 
their evidence to be admissible in a criminal action.  

In 2015, the accreditation responsibility was transferred to the TFSC. Simultaneously, the TFSC was 
also given the responsibility of creating and administering a forensic analyst licensure program that 
mandates licensure for analysts in forensic disciplines subject to accreditation in Texas by 2019. 
Other areas of responsibility include: performing discipline-specific reviews; pursuing forensic 
development activities, such as staying current with national forensic reform work; educating 
criminal justice professionals; and conducting the Rio Grande Identification Project. The TFSC is an 
independent Commission but is administratively located within the Sam Houston University budget. 

The TSFC has nine members who are gubernatorial appointments, have two-year staggered terms, 
and are subject to reappointment: 

 Prosecuting attorney (from the list provided by the Texas District and County Attorneys

Association);

Virginia 

Virginia created two boards by statute in 2005. The Forensic Science Board, which consists of 15 
members, includes stakeholders, customer base and representatives from the state agencies, Supreme 
Court of Virginia and legislature and two members from the Scientific Advisory Committee. Serving 
as a policy board for the Virginia Department of Forensic Science (DFS), it is required (has the 
“power and duty”) to provide program and fiscal standards and goals; establish long-range programs 
for new technologies; advise the Governor, Director of the Department and the General Assembly 
on matters relating to the DFS in general; and act on recommendations of the Scientific Advisory 
Committee. (The DFS is the primary provider of public forensics in Virginia.) The Board also 
monitors funds and contracts, approves grants, and recommends actions to “foster and promote 
coordination and cooperation between the DFS and the user programs that are served.”67
