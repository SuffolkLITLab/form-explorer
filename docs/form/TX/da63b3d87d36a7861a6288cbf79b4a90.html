Concerning

736

Petitioner:

Respondent(s):

Default Order

1. On this day, the Court considered Petitioner's motion for a default order granting its

application for an expedited order under Rule 736. Petitioner's application complies with

the requirements of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 736.1.

2. The name and last known address of each Respondent subject to this order is

. Each Respondent was properly served with the citation, but none

filed a response within the time required by law. The return of service for each

Respondent has been on file with the court for at least ten days.

3. The property that is the subject of this foreclosure proceeding is commonly known as

[legal description ofthe property]

4. The lien to be foreclosed is indexed or recorded at

[volume/page,

5. The material facts establishing Respondent's default are alleged in Petitioner's

application and the supporting

[affidavit or declaration]. Those facts are

adopted by the court and incorporated by reference in this order.

6. Based on the

[affidavit or declaration] of Petitioner, no Respondent subject to

this order is protected from foreclosure by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, 50

U.S.C. App. §501 etseq.

7. Therefore, the Court grants Petitioner's motion for a default order under Texas Rules of

Civil Procedure 736.7 and 736.8. Petitioner may proceed with foreclosure of the property

described above in accordance with applicable law and the

[loan

agreement, contract, or lien] sought to be foreclosed.

8. This order is not subject, to a motion for rehearing, a new trial, a bill of review, or an

appeal. Any challenge to this order must be made in a separate, original proceeding filed
