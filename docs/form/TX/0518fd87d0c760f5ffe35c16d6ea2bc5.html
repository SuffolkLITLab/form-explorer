Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 
 
Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 
 

APPEAL NO.: 

11-017 

ESPONDENT: 

Caldwell County Court at Law Judge Edward L. Jarrett 

ATE: 

 

February 29, 2012 

PECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge Stephen B. Ables, Chair; Judge John Ovard; Judge Olen 
Underwood; Judge J. Rolando Olvera; Judge Jeff Walker 

 

 

 

Petitioner requested the following records from Judge Edward L. Jarrett (“Respondent”): 

1.  “Copy of cellular phone records or billing detail listing incoming and outgoing calls by 
date and time for the days March 1, 2010 through October 1, 2010 inclusive, for the 
cellular phone assigned to Caldwell County Judge Edward Jarrett.” 
 

2.  “Copy  of  any  and  all  calendars  and  or  schedules  used  by  the  court  or  other  record, 
calendar and or schedules used by court personnel in written or electronic form used or 
maintained by the Caldwell County Court at Law and or its personnel and or presiding 
judge for the month of March 1, 2010 – October 1, 2010.” 
 

3.  “Any  and  all  records  of  the  court  or  of  court  personnel  of  any  kind  that  reveal  the 
whereabouts of Caldwell County Court at Law Judge Edward Jarrett for the days of his 
recusal for case number 31648.” 
 

4.  “Copy of any and all email communications between Caldwell County Court at Law 
Judge Edward Jarrett and any person that discusses vacation plans of any person in the 
Caldwell County Court at Law for the months March 2010 through October 2010.” 

Respondent replied that he does not have any information responsive to numbers 1 and 2 and 
that the records responsive to numbers 3 and 4 are exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5(c) and 
(h).  Petitioner then filed this appeal. 

 
The first item requested by Petitioner is a copy of cellular phone bills or records for the cell 
 
phone assigned to Judge Jarrett.  Respondent states that he does not have a cellular phone issued to 
him  by  the  county  or  paid  for,  in  whole  or  in  part,  with  public  funds.    Petitioner  argues  that 
Respondent should provide bills for the cellular phone numbers that he has provided to his staff and 
to the public so that she can confirm that public funds have not been used to pay for this cellular 
phone service.  We previously have held that bills for cellular phones used by court staff and paid 
for, in whole or in part, with public funds, are judicial records that are subject to Rule 12.  See Rule 
12 Decision No. 11-009.  Respondent has informed this committee that he has not been assigned a

cellular phone by the county and that public funds are not used to pay for any portion of the costs 
associated  with  his  personal  cellular  phone.    Rule  12  does  not  require  Respondent  to  disclose 
personal cellular phone bills in order to prove that they are not paid for with public funds.  This 
portion of Petitioner’s appeal is denied.   

Petitioner also requested copies of calendars or schedules used by the court or other record, 
calendar or schedules used by court personnel in written or electronic form from March 1, 2010 
through October 1, 2010.  Respondent informed Petitioner that he does not have records responsive 
to this request and stated that if the information exists, it would be in the possession of the Caldwell 
County  Clerk.    Petitioner  maintains  that  Respondent  failed  to  comply  with  Rule  12.6(f).    This 
provision requires a judicial officer who receives a request for a judicial record not in his custody  to 
promptly attempt to ascertain who the custodian of the records is, and if the proper custodian is 
identified, to forward the request to the proper custodian.  In response to the appeal, Respondent 
explains that the requested records do not exist and that his suggestion that Petitioner check with the 
Caldwell County Clerk was a courtesy.  Respondent also argues that any calendar that the clerk has is 
a calendar maintained by the clerk and not a calendar that is used or maintained by his court as 
requested by Petitioner.  Because the request was for a calendar that is used or maintained by the 
court or its staff and Respondent has indicated that such a record does not exist, Respondent was not 
required to take further action.  Accordingly, this portion of Petitioner’s appeal is denied. 

The third request is for records of the court or court personnel of any kind that “reveal the 
whereabouts” of Judge Jarrett on the days in which a case in which he was recused was heard.  In 
Rule 12 Decision No. 11-009, we interpreted a similar request to be one for records that indicate 
where the judge was if he was not in the office.  We ruled that a record with information related to a 
judge’s personal appointments or schedule when he is not in the office or on the bench is not a record 
that is made or maintained in the regular course of a court’s business and is not subject to Rule 12.  
Though we agree with this ruling, we want to clarify that information regarding a judicial officer’s 
“whereabouts” that reveals engagements or appointments related to the judicial officer’s regular 
course of business, such as attendance at a judicial education conference or a judicial meeting, is 
subject to Rule 12.  Because the requested information may be subject to Rule 12, we will address 
Respondent’s claims that it is exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5(c) and (h).  Rule 12.5(c) does 
not exempt this information because it only applies to personnel records and information regarding a 
judicial officer’s “whereabouts” is not a personnel record.  Rule 12.5(h) exempts information that 
reflects appointments or engagements that are in the future or that constitute an invasion of personal 
privacy.  Respondent did not explain why the release of the responsive information would constitute 
an  invasion  of  personal  privacy.    If  the  information  reveals  personal,  non-business  related 
appointments or events, we agree that release of this information would constitute an invasion of 
personal privacy.  However, general statements about leave or documentation about appointments or 
events  that  are  in  the  Respondent’s  regular  course  of  business  do not  constitute an invasion of 
personal  privacy  and  are  not  exempt  under  Rule  12.5(h)  unless  they  reflect  appointments  or 
engagements that are in the future.  See Rule 12 Decision No. 11-016.  
 

The last request is for a copy of email communications between Judge Jarrett and any person 
that discuss vacation plans of any person in Judge Jarrett’s court for the months of March 2010 
through  October  2010.    In  Rule  12  Decision  No.  11-009,  we  interpreted  a  similar  request  for 
“vacation plans” to be a request for records that indicate “vacation taken.”  In that decision we held 
that a record that discusses personal vacation plans is not a record that is made or maintained for a 

   

   

 

 

court or judicial agency in its regular course of business and is not subject to Rule 12.  But we also 
explained that a record that documents vacation leave or a request for approval to take leave pertains 
to a court’s or judicial agency’s administrative function and is a judicial record that is subject to Rule 
12.  We reaffirm this analysis and find that records responsive to the request at issue in this appeal 
may be subject to Rule 12 depending on the content.  Respondent maintains that this information is 
exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5(c) and (h).   Rule 12.5(c) exempts from disclosure any 
personnel record that would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  Though 
leave  records  may  be  considered  personnel  records,  the  release  of  basic  leave information  or a 
notation  that  a  person  is  “out,”  without  additional  details,  would  not  constitute  an  invasion  of 
personal privacy, much less a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy as required by Rule 
12.5(c).  See Rule 12 Decision No. 11-016.  Therefore, this information is not exempt under Rule 
12.5(c) and it is not exempt under Rule 12.5(h), unless it is for an appointment or engagement that 
occurs in the future.   

    
 
Accordingly, we sustain the denial of access to Respondent’s cellular phone bill records and 
find that, because the requested judicial calendar records do not exist, Respondent was not required 
to comply with Rule 12.6(f).  Additionally, we find that information regarding the Respondent’s 
“whereabouts” and emails that discuss the Respondent’s or his staff’s vacation plans may be judicial 
records.  We are confident that Respondent will review the responsive records, if any, and respond in 
a manner that is consistent with this decision.
