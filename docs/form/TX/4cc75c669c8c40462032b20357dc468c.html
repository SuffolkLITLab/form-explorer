1)   Unless  the  notice  of  court  proceeding  states  otherwise,  a  person  who 
participates  in  a  court  proceeding  does  so  by  physical  presence  in  the 
courtroom. Upon appropriate notice by a party or the court, a court may 
allow  or  require  a  participant  to  appear  at  a  court  proceeding  by 
videoconference,  teleconference,  or  other  available  electronic  means, 
except as otherwise provided in (2). 

Participant Method of Appearance.  

  (

b) 

  (

A) 

a party or lawyer to appear electronically for a court proceeding 
in  which  oral  testimony  is  heard,  absent  good  cause  or  the 
agreement of the parties; or 

B) 

a lawyer, party, or juror to appear electronically for a jury trial, 
absent the agreement of the parties. 

  (

(2)   A court must not require: 

(c)  

Judge  Method  of  Appearance;  Location.  A  judge  may  appear  at  a  court 
proceeding  by  videoconference,  teleconference,  or  other  available  electronic 
means.  However,  even  if  appearing  electronically,  a  judge  must  conduct  the 
court proceeding from a location required by law. 

d)  Objection. A party may object to any method of appearance, stating good cause 
for the objection. The objection must be made within a reasonable time after 
the party receives notice of the appearance. The court may, but is not required 
to,  conduct  a  hearing  on  the  objection.  Before  proceeding  by  the  objected-to 
method  of  appearance,  the  court  must  rule  on  the  objection  and  timely 
communicate the ruling to the parties in a written order or on the record.  

e) 

Factors. In determining good cause under this rule, the court should consider 
factors such as: 

(1)  

case type;  

2)  

court proceeding type; 

3) 

the number of parties and witnesses;  

4)  

the complexity of the legal and factual issues;  

  

5)  

the type of evidence to be submitted, if any;

(6)  

technological  restrictions  such  as  lack  of  access  to  or  proficiency  in 
necessary technology;  

7)  

travel restrictions such as lack of transportation, distance, or inability 
to take off work;  

8)   whether  a  method  of  appearance  is  best  suited  to  provide  necessary 
language access services for a person with limited English proficiency or 
accommodations for a person with a disability; and  

9)  

any previous abuse of a method of appearance. 

Open Courts. If a court conducts a court proceeding in which all participants 
appear electronically, the court must: 

provide  reasonable  notice  to  the  public  of  how  to  observe  the  court 
proceeding; and 

provide  the  public  the  opportunity  to  observe  the  court  proceeding, 
unless the court has determined that it must close the court proceeding 
to  protect  an  overriding  interest,  considered  all  less-restrictive 
alternatives  to  closure,  and  made  findings  on  the  record  adequate  to 
support closure.

  C

omment to 2023 change: New Rule 21d clarifies procedures for appearances 
at  court  proceedings.  Paragraph  (a)  defines  “court  proceeding”  and  “participant.” 
Paragraph  (b)  governs  a  participant’s  method  of  appearance.  Certain  statutes 
expressly  prohibit  electronic  appearances,  in  which  case  the  governing  statute 
applies. Paragraph (c) provides that the judge may appear by electronic means, but 
it requires the judge to appear electronically from a location required by law. See, e.g., 
TEX.  CONST.  art.  V,  §  7(d);  TEX.  GOV’T  CODE  §§  24.030(a),  26.002(c).  Nothing  in 
paragraph  (c)  permits  the  judge  to  conduct  a  proceeding  away  from  a  location 
required  by  law.  Paragraph  (d)  addresses  objections  to  any  method  of  appearance, 
and paragraph (e) addresses good-cause factors. Paragraph (f) recognizes the public’s 
right to reasonable notice of and access to a fully electronic proceeding unless there 
is an overriding interest. A court should rarely close a court proceeding from public 
observation, and in such an exceptional case, the court must use the least restrictive 
measure to protect the overriding interest.

Notes and Comments 
 

Comment  to  2023  change:  New  Rule  500.10  clarifies  procedures  for 
appearances at court proceedings. Paragraph (a) governs the method of appearance 
for court “participants,” which is defined in Rule 500.2. Under paragraph (b), a judge 
in any justice court proceeding may appear electronically, but the judge must preside 
over it from the judge’s office at times prescribed by the commissioner’s court. TEX. 
GOV’T  CODE  §  27.051(b).  Nothing  in  paragraph  (b)  permits  the  judge  to  conduct  a 
proceeding away from a location required by law. Paragraph (c) addresses factors that 
a  judge  should  consider  in  determining  the  method  of  appearance.  Paragraph  (d) 
clarifies  requirements  for  notices.  Paragraph  (e)  recognizes  the  public’s  right  to 
reasonable  notice  of  and  access  to  a  fully  electronic  proceeding  unless  there  is  an 
overriding  interest.  A  judge  should  rarely  close  a  court  proceeding  from  public 
observation, and in such an exceptional case, the judge must use the least restrictive 
measure to protect the overriding interest.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
