Note on Retirement Funds (for example, pension, profit-sharing, and stock option plans, 401ks, and IRAs): 

If you use these forms to divide retirement funds, you will need to obtain an additional court order, usually 
called a “qualified domestic relations order” (QDRO), to make the division effective.  A QDRO form is not 
included in this Divorce Set.  It is recommended that you hire a lawyer to prepare a QDRO.  If you and your 
spouse keep your own retirement funds or do not have any retirement funds, you do not need a QDRO.

Page 2 

What It Is and How to Use It 
If you are poor, or on government benefits because you are poor, or you cannot pay court fees, 
you may fill out this form to ask the Court if you can file for divorce without paying the court 
and filing fees.  The Court may ask you to present evidence of your income and expenses at a 
hearing.  The Court may or may not decide to let you file without paying.  It is sometimes called 
a “Pauper’s Oath” or an “Affidavit of Inability to Pay Costs.” 
This form must be filed at the courthouse to start your divorce case.  It tells the Court and your 
spouse that you want a divorce and states what you want the Court to order in the Final Decree 
of Divorce.  It is sometimes called the “Original Petition” or “Petition.”  
This form may be filled out by your spouse, if he or she agrees to sign it.  It tells the Court that 
your spouse has received a copy of the Original Petition for Divorce and does not want to be 
formally given a copy by a constable, sheriff, or process server.  This form allows the judge to 
finalize your divorce as long as your spouse has signed the Final Decree of Divorce, and allows 
your spouse to be notified of any hearings in the case.  Other Waiver of Service forms are not 
the same.  Your spouse must sign the Waiver in front of a notary.  The Waiver must be signed at 
least one day after the Original Petition for Divorce is filed.   
This form finalizes your divorce and states what the Court has ordered in your case.  Fill it out 
and bring it to your final divorce hearing.  
This form tells the Court what your spouse’s last known address is and is filled out only in 
certain situations.  If a Waiver or an Answer (see below for definition) has not been filed and 
your spouse has not signed the Final Decree of Divorce, you must bring this form to the final 
divorce hearing.   
This form must be filed if you or your spouse moves.  It tells the Court what the new address is 
so that the Court can contact you about hearings, etc.   
This form tells the Court whether or not your spouse is on active military duty.  If a Waiver or an 
Answer (see below for definition) has not been filed and your spouse has not signed the Final 
Decree of Divorce, you must bring this form to the final divorce hearing.   

Definition 
Your spouse has a right to know, in writing, that you are filing for divorce. You cannot simply 
send your spouse a letter.  You must use a legally acceptable way and prove to the Court that 
you did so.  There are (3) ways to give legal notice:  Waiver of Service, Official Service of Process, 
or by Posting or Publication. Each is described in Step 4 in these instructions.     
Official service of process is when your spouse is formally “served” with (given) the Original 
Petition for Divorce by a constable, sheriff, or private process server, or when the clerk sends it 
by certified mail, return receipt requested.  You must use official service of process if a Waiver 
of Service form has not been filed in your case.  It is always best to officially serve your spouse if 
there has been domestic violence in the relationship or a Protective Order is in effect.  
When your spouse tells the Court in writing that s/he has received a copy of the Original 
Petition for Divorce and does not want to be formally “served” with the Original Petition for 
Divorce, your spouse is “waiving service of process.” 
If your spouse contests the divorce, your spouse may file an “answer” instead of signing the 
Waiver of Service.  This Set has no answer form because it is for uncontested cases.  However, 
you may still use this Set if your spouse signs the Final Decree of Divorce after filing an answer.  
An additional court order that is necessary to complete the division of a retirement fund.  A 
QDRO form is not included in this Divorce Set.  It is recommended that you hire a lawyer to 
prepare a QDRO if you use these forms to divide retirement funds.

•  Make two copies of the Original Petition for Divorce and, if you are using it, the Affidavit of Indigency.   

Step 3:  File (turn in) your Original Petition for Divorce, and if applicable, your Affidavit of Indigency 
•  Take the original and the two copies of your Original Petition for Divorce and your Affidavit of Indigency, if 
applicable, to the courthouse and file them (turn them in) with the District or County Court at Law Clerk.   

o  NOTE:  If you are using an Affidavit of Indigency, you must sign it in front of a notary and you must file 

the Original Petition for Divorce and the Affidavit of Indigency at the same time. 

If there is a local standing order that you need to follow or attach to any of your documents. 
If there are local rules that you need to know about for your divorce case. 

•  Ask the clerk: 
o 
o 
o  For a Civil Case Information Sheet.  Fill it out and file it with your Original Petition for Divorce. 
o  For an Information on Suit Affecting the Family Relationship form, also called a BVS or Bureau of Vital 
Statistics form.  It changes state records about your marital status, etc.  Fill it out and file it with your 
Original Petition for Divorce. 

o  To “file-stamp” your copies.  The clerk will stamp your papers with the date and time you turned them 

in.  The clerk will keep the original and give you back your file-stamped copies. 

• 

If you are not filing an Affidavit of Indigency, you will need to pay a filing fee.  The fee may be between $150- 
$300, depending on where you live.  

•  The clerk will ask you if you want to have your spouse “served” with the papers.  See Step 4 for an explanation. 

Step 4:   Give Your Spouse “Legal Notice” that You Have Filed for Divorce.  (See definition on page 2)  
•  There are three ways to give legal notice for this Set.  Choose the one method that best fits your situation:

How to Use this Set: 

tep 1:  Read These General Instructions 

Instructions for Divorce Set 1 - Uncontested, No Minor Children, No Real Property 

Page 4 

1.  By Waiver of Service.  If your spouse agrees to fill out the Waiver of Service form in this Set, you do not 

need to have your spouse served by Official Service of Process.  Follow the steps below to use the Waiver of 
Service. 

o  Mail or hand-deliver a “file-stamped” copy of the Original Petition for Divorce and a blank Waiver of 
Service form to your spouse.  WARNING:  Do not hand-deliver these papers if there has been 
domestic violence in the relationship, especially if a judge has signed a Protective Order ordering 
you or your spouse to stay away from the other.  Mail or give legal notice by official service of 
process instead. 

o  Tell your spouse to sign the Waiver in front of a notary public at least one day after you filed the 

Original Petition for Divorce.  Otherwise, your spouse will have to redo it. 

o  You or your spouse must file (turn in) the Waiver where you filed your Original Petition for Divorce. 

2.  By Official Service of Process.  This method must be used in certain situations, described in the Glossary 

chart on page 2.  Follow the steps below to use Official Service of Process. 

o  Tell the clerk where you filed your Original Petition for Divorce that you need to “serve” your spouse 

with the Original Petition for Divorce.  There will be a fee for this service. 

o  Tell the clerk if you want a constable, sheriff, or private process server to handle service of process 

or if you want the clerk to handle it by certified mail, return receipt requested. 

• 

• 

 

If a constable, sheriff or private process server handles it, they will complete a Return of 
Service form stating where and when your spouse was served.  This form is proof to the 
Court that you gave your spouse legal notice.  They may file the Return of Service at the 
courthouse or give it to you.  If they give it to you, make a copy and file the original. 
If the clerk handles it, the return receipt (or, “green card”) is proof to the Court that you 
gave your spouse legal notice.  The return receipt must be signed by your spouse, so only 
use this option if you know that your spouse is the only person who will sign for the letter 
when the mailman delivers it.  

o  Check to make sure the Return of Service or the return receipt is filed (turned in) to the court where you 

filed your Original Petition for Divorce, at least 12 days before your final hearing.  

3.  By Posting or Publication.  If you do not know where your spouse is, you will need to give legal notice by 

posting (posting the paperwork at the courthouse) or by publication (publishing legal notice in the 
newspaper).  

o 

 Go to www.TexasLawHelp.org and look at the Legal Notice, Service by Posting, and Service by 
Publication Sets for more details. 

• 

If you change anything in the Original Petition for Divorce after giving your spouse legal notice, you must 
give your spouse a copy of the Amended (changed) Original Petition for Divorce and file it with the court.  
You can give your spouse a copy by using the methods listed above, or you can use any method allowed 
under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 21a, which is available online and may be available at the court.  If you 
use a method allowed under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 21a, the Amended (changed) Original Petition 
that you file with the court must include a signed statement showing you complied with the rule. 

tep 5.  Complete Final Forms and Prepare for Court. 

•  Fill out the Final Decree of Divorce form and sign it.  If your spouse has filed an Answer or a Waiver, your 

spouse must sign the Final Decree of Divorce.

o  NOTE:  A creditor’s right to collect on a debt is not affected by a divorce decree.  So, if the Court orders 
your spouse to pay a specific debt from the marriage and your spouse does not pay it, the creditor can 
still seek payment from you.  

• 

If a Waiver or an Answer has not been filed, you must fill out the Certificate of Last Known Address form and the 
Military Status Affidavit form.  Make two copies. 
 

•  Prepare for Court.   

o  You will need to give testimony when talking to the judge.  Some judges will ask you questions, others 

want you to read a “script” of testimony.  You can find sample “prove up” testimony online 
at www.TexasLawHelp.org.   

o  Learn tips on what to do when you go to court and when the judge calls your case online 

at www.TexasLawHelp.org.  
 

Step 6.  Go to Court and Present Your Divorce Case to the Judge  

•  After 61 days have passed since you filed the Original Petition for Divorce, you may finalize your divorce.   

o  Victims of domestic violence may be able to finalize a divorce earlier.  Call 1-800-374-4673 to get advice 

from an attorney at no charge. 

•  Ask the clerk or court coordinator when uncontested divorce cases are heard and bring the following to court 

with you on that day: 
 

If your spouse has signed the Final Decree of 
Divorce, bring: 
1.  A file-stamped copy of your Original Petition 

If your spouse has not signed the Final Decree of 
Divorce or filed a Waiver or an Answer, bring: 
1.  A file-stamped copy of your Original Petition 

for Divorce; 

for Divorce; 

2.  Your completed Final Decree of Divorce form, 

2.  A file-stamped copy of the Return of  

signed by you and your spouse; and 

Service;  

3.  The Waiver of Service signed by your spouse (if 
not already filed) or a file-stamped copy of the 
Return of Service (if a Waiver or Answer has 
not been filed).   

3.   Certificate of Last Known Address; 
4.   Military Status Affidavit; and 
5.   Your completed Final Decree of Divorce, signed 
by you. 
 

 
 

   

•  When you go to the courthouse, stop by the clerk’s office: 

o  Ask if you need the court file, a docket sheet (list of what has been filed), or anything else from their 

o 

office to bring with you to court. 
If a Waiver or an Answer has not been filed, you need to file the Certificate of Last Known Address and 
the Military Status Affidavit in the clerk’s office before you go to court, then bring a file-stamped copy of 
each with you to court. 
   
Step 7.  Finalize Your Divorce 

•  Once the judge has signed your Final Decree of Divorce, take it to the clerk’s office and file it.   Your divorce is 

NOT final until you do so. 

•  Turn in the Information on Suit Affecting the Family Relationship form (a BVS, or Bureau of Vital Statistics form) 

if you did not turn it in when you filed your Original Petition for Divorce.   

Instructions for Divorce Set 1 - Uncontested, No Minor Children, No Real Property 

Page 6 

•  Get a certified copy of your Final Decree of Divorce from the clerk while you are there.  You will need one if you 
are changing your name or dealing with creditors and may need one for other circumstances.   The clerk may 
charge a fee for the certified copy.   

•  NOTES:   

o  You cannot get married to someone else until 30 days after your Final Decree of Divorce is signed. 
o  After your divorce is final, remember to sign documents to get car titles changed; revise your will; 

change beneficiaries on your life insurance policies, retirement plans, bank accounts, etc; prepare and 
submit a QDRO if you use these forms to divide retirements funds.

WARNING to Respondent:  
Do not use this form if: 

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

• 
• 
• 

• 

You and your spouse disagree about any issue in your divorce.   
You or your spouse wants to file specific grounds for divorce, such as cruelty or adultery.   
The wife is pregnant, even if the husband is not the father. 
The wife has had a child by another man since the date of marriage. 
You and your spouse have a disabled child, regardless of that child’s age. 
You and your spouse have a biological or adopted child together who is either under 18 years old or who is 18 years old and 
still in high school. 
You or your spouse wants spousal support or maintenance, referred to as “alimony” in some states.    
You or your spouse owns or is buying real property (such as a house, building, piece of land, or other real estate).   
You or your spouse has an ongoing bankruptcy case. 

Note on Retirement Funds (for example, pension, profit-sharing, and stock option plans, 401ks, and IRAs): 

If you use these forms to divide retirement funds, you will need to obtain an additional court order, usually called a “qualified 
domestic relations order” (QDRO), to make the division effective.  A QDRO form is not included in this Divorce Set.  It is 
recommended that you hire a lawyer to prepare a QDRO.  If you and your spouse keep your own retirement funds or do not 
have any retirement funds, you do not need a QDRO.   

INSTRUCTIONS to Respondent: 
Talk to a lawyer if you don’t understand this form, or read the instructions for this Divorce Set 1 - Uncontested, No Minor Children, No 
Real Property, which can be found at www.TexasLawHelp.org.   If you do use this form: 
•  Do not sign it until at least one day after the Original Petition for Divorce has been filed with the clerk’s office.  Your spouse 

should have given you a copy of the Original Petition for Divorce when he or she gave you this form.  The official court stamp on 
your copy will tell you when it was filed.  If you sign this form before then, you will need to redo it. 

• 

Fill out this form completely.  You must include your address. 

Sign this form in front of a notary. If you sign it beforehand, you will need to redo it. 

• 
•  Give the original signed form back to your spouse or file it (turn it in) to the court where your spouse filed the Original Petition for 

Divorce. Keep a copy for your records.

5.  Divorce 

6.  Property and Debts  

IT IS ORDERED that the Petitioner and the Respondent are divorced. 

About community property:  Texas is a community property state.  This means that any new property or debt that 
either party obtains from the minute they are married until the minute the judge grants the divorce is probably 
community property, even if the property or debt is only in one spouse’s name. There are only a few exceptions to 
the law of community property such as gifts, inheritance, or a recovery for personal injuries that occurred during 
the marriage that is not for lost wages or medical expenses.  All community property and debt should be included 
in the Final Decree of Divorce. 

About separate property: If either party receives a gift, an inheritance, or a recovery for personal injuries that 
occurred during the marriage that is not for lost wages or medical expenses, it is separate property. It is a good 
idea to list separate property obtained during the marriage as that spouse’s separate property in the Final Decree 
of Divorce. 

More information about community and separate property can be found by consulting a lawyer, as well as in the 
Texas Family Code, Chapters 3, 4, and 5.  

he Court makes the following orders regarding the parties’ community and separate property:

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
