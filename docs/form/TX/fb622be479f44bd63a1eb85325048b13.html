We  viewed  “Beyond  Brief  Writing”  as  an  opportunity  to  delve  into  topics  not 
typically discussed in other advanced legal writing presentations.  Through the 
examples set out in this paper, we hope you’ll find ways to improve and enliven 
your  brief  writing.  Conferences  like  these  are  a  chance  to  step  away  from  the 
routine of churning out briefs and to reflect. Without such moments to pause and 
gain perspective, we can trick ourselves into thinking that the grueling hours spent 
putting  a  brief  together will  be  directly  related,  if  not  matched,  by  the  court’s 
painstaking  attention  to  our  work 
product.  Ha!  No  one  has  ever  said 
that  they  wished  they  could  keep 
reading  a  legal  brief  just  a  little  bit 
longer. Far from it. William Zinsser in 
his  classic  nonfiction  writing  guide, 
“On  Writing  Well,”  chides  that  “the 
reader is an impatient bird, perched 
on  the  thin  edge  of  distraction  or 
sleep.”1  

There is no reason to think judges are different. After all, they have many more 
briefs to read after yours. According to the Office of Court Administration, in Fiscal 
Year  2020,  there  were  3,450  new  writs,  1,043  new  petitions  for  discretionary 
review (PDRs), and 618 new original proceedings filed in the Court of Criminal 
Appeals.2 In the same period, the courts of appeals saw 3,631 new criminal case 
filings and 5,074 new civil ones.3 To put that in perspective, that’s about 8,500 
new cases. If you assume a 12% dismissal rate off the top,4 that’s 7,500 cases 
getting  briefing.  If  each  advocate  uses  only  half her  word  limit,  that  comes  to 
15,000  words  of briefing total in  the case.  At  the average  reader’s rate  of 250

4 12% is a fair estimate. In Fiscal Year 2020, 23% of cases were dismissed, 12% at 
the opinion stage, suggesting roughly 11% were dismissed at an earlier stage. Id. 
at 50, 52. In the prior year, 24% of cases were dismissed, 9% at the opinion stage, 
leaving  15%  dismissed  earlier.  FY19  Annual  Statistical  Report,  Office  of  Court 
Administration, 17-18.

words a minute, that comes to 1 hour of reading per case, which is 7,500 hours a 
year or 312 days a year that the courts of appeals spend reading briefs. With this 
new  perspective  in mind,  let’s  plunge in to how  we can make the most of the 
precious few minutes that any of our briefs will get.   

1. Visual Aids 

V
isual aids are a valuable  tool for appellate courts and practitioners.  They are 
magnetic when placed among the written word.  Images, notably, have proven to 
be a particularly potent way to capture attention and persuade. 5  

Images  are  efficient,  accessible,  and  memorable.  Multimedia  legal 
argument may assist courts, litigants, and scholars to convey complex 
scientific, technical, or abstract information.  They also engage readers, 
particularly twenty-first-century readers, to whom legal writing is a vast 
black-and-white desert.6 

With some creativity and not-so-new ingenuity, a variety of methods―images, 
screenshots,  charts,  and  bullet  points―can  be  employed  to  augment  and 
facilitate your prose.   

a. Courts Leading by Example with Visual Aids 

Though Westlaw has been slow to adapt to include certain images,7 that has not 
stopped the Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) from pressing forward.   In Milton v. 

 

5  Elizabeth  G.  Porter, Taking Images Seriously,  114  COLUM.  L.  REV.  1687,  1724 
(2014)  (“[L]awyers  and  judges  are  embedding  images  directly  into  legal 
documents,  using  those  images  to  drive  arguments  and—through  explicit 
argument  and  implicit  messaging—to  compel  conclusions.”).    Porter’s  article 
provides a comprehensive history of images in the legal arena.  
6 Id. at 1694 (2014).   
7  On Westlaw certain visual material, particularly in pre-2019 sources, is marked 
with  “TABULAR  OR  GRAPHIC  MATERIAL  SET  FORTH  AT  THIS  POINT  IS  NOT 
DISPLAYABLE”  within  documents.    Meanwhile,  HeinOnline  has  adapted  to  this 
technology.  Id. at 1781. The CCA recent use of hyperlinks in opinions have not 
been reproduced in Westlaw. See, e.g., Pugh v. State, No. PD-1053-19, 2022 WL 
224275 (Tex. Crim. App. Jan. 26, 2022).  

 

5 

tate, PD-0207-18, the Court included screenshots from, and a link on its website 
S
to, a video  in the record of a zoo lion trying to eat a human baby through the 
protective  glass  that  was  improperly  used  during  the  prosecutor’s  closing 
argument. 

ustices  on  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  have  occasionally  used  visuals 
attached  to  their  opinions,8  but  in  one  recent  use,9  Justice  Neil  Gorsuch 
incorporated a photograph from the record in line with the text of his statement 
to the denial  of certiorari. The photo of the  curtilage of  a  home supported his 
argument that officers on a “knock and talk” strayed from the implied license to 
go to the front door: 

 

 

8  See  Dellinger,  Hampton,  “Words  are  Enough:  The  Troublesome  Use  of 
Photographs, Maps, and Other Images in Supreme Court Opinions,” 110 Harvard 
Law Rev. 1704, Vol. 110, No. 8 (June 1997) (citing, for example, the attachment 
of the alleged libel in the New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964), and 
lamenting  that  photographs,  while  appearing  objective,  can  “result  in  a 
particularly subjective version of the ‘facts’”).   
9 Bovat v. Vermont,  141  S.  Ct.  22  (2020)  (Gorsuch,  J.,  statement  on  denial  of 
certiorari).

                J

 

 

  

 

In  addition  to  photographs,  courts  also  use  tables  and  charts  to  summarize 
cases,10  explain  complex  holdings,11  and  compare  offense  elements  or 
testimony.12 While there are numerous and ever-more-recent examples of courts 
communicating  their  message  visually,  still  more  opportunities  exist  for 
practitioners to incorporate visual aids to persuade. 

 

10 Hyett v. State, 58 S.W.3d 826, 836 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet. 
ref’d) (Wittig, J., dissenting).  
11  Schutz v. State,  957  S.W.2d  52,  75  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  1997)  (appendix  of 
admissible evidence on credibility of child victim in sex abuse cases).  
12 Ex parte Beck, 541 S.W.3d 846, 858 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017).

b.  Practitione rs Are Using Visual Aids 

i. Photos and Screenshots in Briefs 

Words rarely capture the full import of visual material, as hard as you may try, and 
images tend to stick with us longer, too.13   Therefore, you can include a photo or 
screenshot from a video in a brief to help solidify a point.  Pictures and screenshots 
should enhance or supplement your argument, but they should not substitute for 
thoughtful advocacy.  

In  Monjaras v. State,  PD-0582-21,  for  example,  the  Appellant’s  brief  used 
screenshots  from  the  officers’  body  cameras  to  demonstrate  when  and  how, 
according  to  Appellant,  the  consensual  encounter  transformed  into  an 
investigative detention with the officers’ proximity and use of hand-gestures and 
touch.   Though the officers’ actions were described in writing, the screenshots 
operate as authority for Appellant’s propositions and instantly provide the Court 
with the necessary context.   

 

13 Daniel Glaser, “Why pictures trigger buried memories faster than words,” The 
Guardian, Dec. 18, 2016.  

8 

  

                   

 

Professor Porter observed that images promote the “gestalt perspective”: “Rather 
than parsing an image into its constituent parts, we approach it from a gestalt 
perspective,  taking  it  all  in  at  once.”14    This  can  provide  a  litigant  with  an 
opportunity  to  strike  their  mark  quickly  and  without  excess  explanation.    The 
“gestalt perspective” approach was used effectively by the State in Hoang v. State, 
No. 05-08-01303-CR.  There, the State included a photo of the victim’s injuries to 
help refute the claim that the Appellant acted in self-defense and defense of a 
third party.   

hen a document, exhibit, jury charge, or charging instrument is at the heart of 
your case, including it within your brief will often aid the court.  First, it obviates 
the need of the court to cull through the record to find the document at issue.  
Second, it helps the court understand your argument.  Descriptors only go so far; 
seeing is believing. If, in telling someone else about your case, you would reach 
for a photo exhibit or pull it up on your computer to explain, consider adding it as 
an image in your brief.    

The same goes for other exhibits. In Patterson v. State, PD-0322-21, the issue is 
whether the search warrant for drugs in a fraternity house was particular enough 

14 Porter, 114 COLUM. L. REV. at 1753.  

 

9 

  

                  W

 

 

to authorize the search of the Appellant’s bedroom. Appellant’s brief includes the 
affidavit incorporated into the warrant to establish the details (or lack thereof) 
that, in Appellant’s view, prove the warrant was too general.   Also, to direct the 
Court’s focus, Appellant went a step further by highligh ting the relevant text.  

creenshots showing the historical development of statutes can also be helpful.  
As we all know, the appellate-practitioner brain seems hardwired to want to see 
the  source  for  itself.    When  dealing  with  nuanced  and  significant  statutory 
changes, providing screenshots of the text with effective dates, amendments, and 
emphasized additions and deletions can assist the court.  The court can follow the 
development by evaluating the comparative text side-by-side without pausing to 
conduct its own research.  The same information can be conveyed by retyping an 
excerpt from the statute, but when you reproduce the image of the statute from 
the session laws —layout and all—the court knows you have gone to the source 
and there is added assurance that your reproduction is accurate.  

In Harbin v. State, PD-0059-20, the State used screenshots of historical murder 
and sudden-passion statutes to explain how the court of appeals erred to mix and 
match statutes by applying the “punishment” sudden passion from a 1994 statute 
to a murder committed in 1991.   

10 

   

 

            S

   

 

In our everyday lives, we communicate via text and email.  When these items have 
evidentiary value and form the basis for a legal argument, including them as a 
screenshot avoids any dispute about their completeness and content.    The State 
in Ukwauchu v. State,  PD-0366-17,  displayed  text messages to  show that they 
were inadmissible under the rule of optional completeness and referred to the 
past sexual conduct between the victim and Appellant in violation of TEX. R. EVID. 
412.15 

 

15   The messages were later reproduced in a concurring opinion after the case 
was unsealed.  Ukwauchu v. State, PD-0366-17 (Yeary, J., concurring).   

11 

  

               

 

ii. Charts in Briefs 

Tables  and  charts  can  be  especially  useful  in  condensing  information  into  a 
comprehensible  and  memorable  form.  You  can  save  the  court  the  trouble  of 
parsing  out  a  lengthy  indictment  by  including  a  chart  of  charges,  particularly 
where the differences between the paragraphs or counts are minor but matter. In 
this example, the parties disputed what elements the jury had to be unanimous 
about in a single count indictment with multiple paragraphs:    

 

 

If you have something to compare or contrast—such as elements of two statutes 
or testimony of two witnesses or one witness on two occasions—a two-column 
chart can very quickly convey  this information. A chart can make your point far 
better  than  any  assertion  you  could  make  in  words  for  remarkably  similar  or 
different comparisons.  

A
 series of complex financial transactions can similarly be made understandable 
by creating a diagram to show payments and companies’ relationships. If a party 
used an exhibit to illustrate this information at trial, it will frequently also aid the 
court of appeals. Including it in your brief saves the court the time and trouble of 
searching for it.  

12 

 

 

Advocates  have  long  used  vertical  timelines  in  speedy-trial  claims  to  list  the 
events that occur in a case, but you can go one step further by setting out various 
periods of delay next to the number of days as in this example from another state. 
You  could  add  color  to  designate  which  party  the  period  should  be  weighed 
against and even shades of color to indicate  strength. 

 

    

 

 

A
  similar  setup  can be  helpful for  other time  calculations,  like  the  tolling  (and 
resuming) of limitations periods, or numerical information like IQ-test results in 
an intellectual-disability claim.16   

 

16 The CCA did just that fairly recently in Petetan v. State, 622 S.W.3d 321, 338 
(Tex. Crim. App. 2021). 

 

13 

Charts can also be included as an appendix.   When your case involves a large 
amount of data that needs to be distilled for the court, an appendix chart will help 
present that information without cluttering your brief.  In Dulin v. State, PD-0856-
19, the State created a chart from the State of Texas budget to show that criminal 
justice expenses far exceeded the amount of court costs assessed.   Instead of just 
citing Texas’ entire biennium budget, which comprises thousands of pages, the 
State laid out specific amounts dedicated to criminal justice.   

owerPoint and other applications can be used to create aesthetically pleasing 
charts and graphs that can be inserted into your document using the snipping tool 
or by taking a screenshot.  So, just because you are working in a word processing 
program doesn’t mean that you are relegated to its tools for creating charts and 
graphs.  Indeed, creating a chart or graph in Word or WordPerfect can be difficult 
to format or leave little room for creativity.  PowerPoint’s “smart art” feature offers 
several options for charts and graphs that allow data to be easily inserted into an 
already existing format.  And they include color to boot.  PowerPoint also allows 
you to format your own chart or graph to suit your needs.   

14 

  P

 

inally,  like  charts,  bullet  points  can  visually  and  substantively  emphasize  or 
separate information.   This tactic was effective in Cook v. State, PD-0850-21, to 
highlight testimony that opened the door to rebuttal evidence.      

iii. Hyperlinks 

Hyperlinks offer a powerful referencing tool that far surpasses its paper-and-ink 
analog.  With  a  click  or  tap,  you  can take  the  reader  to  an  outside website  or 
different section of your brief. Judges are consumers of online content, too, and 
many  may  appreciate  electronic  briefs  that  incorporate  the  conveniences they 
use  every  day  for online  navigation.  That  said,  the  practitioner  should  also  be 

15 

   

                  F

   

 

 

aware of the evolving rules  in this area. Criminal E-filing Rule 2.2(4)17 requires 
compliance  with  the  Technology  Standards  set  by  the  Judicial  Committee  on 
Information Technology. This includes the rule that e-filed documents “may not 
contain any . . . feature restrictions including password protection.” Rule 3.1D. This 
language likely forbids hyperlinks to Westlaw and Lexis documents and even the 
State Bar’s legal research platform “Fastcase” since they all require some kind of 
log-in or password for access. But it should not prohibit links to the txcourts.gov 
opinions. Just be aware that the page numbers do not align with the Southwestern 
Reporter and default links take the reader to the beginning of what could be a 
lengthy document.  

Also, use your best judgment when it comes to hyperlinks. Don’t use them just 
because you can, or because your legal research software adds them to your brief 
with the click of a button. Numerous bright blue links on the page are  distracting 
and are of no value when used to refer repeatedly to the same case on the same 
page. You can alleviate some of the distractions by changing the text color to black 
and underlining the text to signal a link.  

It’s better to be judicious about sending your reader somewhere other than your 
brief. Instead of hyperlinking every case  you cite, consider using hyperlinks only 
for  difficult-to-find  sources,  such  as  legislative  history,  or  other  trustworthy 
websites like government cites or online dictionaries.  

Note on Appendices 
 
A

The Rules of Appellate Procedure do not require an appendix in criminal cases. 
Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(k). But the documents required for civil cases (the judgment, 
jury  charge,  findings  of  fact,  text  of  statute,  or  rule  on  which  the  argument  is 
based)  can  frequently  be  helpful  to  include  in  criminal  briefs  where  they  are 
relevant to the  issues raised. Even if you are  including part of a  jury  charge or 
statute within the text of your brief, consider adding the entire document in  an 
appendix. Bookmark the appendix to show up on the navigation panel of the PDF 
of your brief.

c. Warnings about Visual Aids 

i. The E-filing Rule  

Briefs  cannot  include  embedded  video  or  audio  materials.    Rule  2.2  of  the 
Statewide Rules Governing Electronic Filing in Criminal Cases governs the format 
for electronically filed documents.19  Subsection (4) requires litigants to “comply 
with  the  Technology  Standards  set  by  the  Judicial  Committee  on  Information 
Technology  and  approved  by  the  Supreme  Court  and  the  Court  of  Criminal 
Appeals.”   In turn, Rule 3.1.D. of the Technology Standards, applicable to digital 
media  documents,  states  that  “[a]n  e-flied  document  may  not  contain  .  .  . 
embedded multi-media video, audio, or programming.”20 

ii. Ethical Conce rns 

itigants should remember that visual materials must be used in accordance with 
L
the Rules of Professional Conduct and the Rules of Appellate Procedure.

•  Cropping, size alterations, and omitting text from visual materials should be 
done with Texas Rule of Professional Conduct 3.03(a) in mind.  Rule 3.03(a) 
provides  that  a  lawyer  shall  not  knowingly  make  a  false  statement  of 
material law or fact to the court.   

•  Visual  materials  should  not  be  used  to  subvert  the  document  length 

provided in Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.4(i).   

•  Privacy-protected  information  under  Texas  Rule  of  Appellate  Procedure 

9.10 should not be disclosed using visual material.    

•  Obscene, offensive, or pornographic material should also be omitted from 

visual materials.   

iii. Thinking Critically about Visuals 

For all the reasons that visuals are powerful, persuasive tools in briefs, they also 
have the potential to mislead:21  

Sidebars, infographics, rollover states, and embedded video in briefs 
could  draw  the  eye  and  the  mind  away  from  the  nuanced  and 
substantiated legal arguments that have characterized legal writing 
until  now.  Where  an  image  will  do,  perhaps  readers  will  have  less 
incentive  to pore over  detailed text. There  is  a real risk that visual 
advocacy  will  create  more  gloss  but  less  substance  in  legal 
discourse.22 
 

In  one  memorable  example,  Maverick’s  owner  Mark  Cuban  incorporated  a 
photograph in a summary judgment motion to argue that he had not financially 
team.  The  photograph  essentially  communicated  that 
mismanaged  the 
championship-winning  teams  can’t  be  financially  mismanaged—a  dubious 
argument  had  it  actually  been  articulated  in  words—but  that  was  persuasive 
when conveyed implicitly through image:

s Porter argues, lawyers and judges are trained in the analysis of legal text, not 
images,  and  we  often  naively  think  such  images  “obviously”  or  “indisputably” 
represent  “truth.”23  Certainly  some  facts  can  be  conclusively  determined  by  a 
photo or video, but our use of visuals to persuade often communicates in ways 
beyond traditional legal argument and reason, and judges and opposing counsel 
should be wary of that. Gruesome autopsy photos in a brief about legal sufficiency 
would be one rather obvious emotional ploy. But even when the admissibility of 
the autopsy photos is the issue in the case (as with a Rule 403 objection), dropping 
them into the brief removed from the context  and lead-up in which they were 
offered at trial and viewed by the jurors has the potential to skew things.  

Textual  descriptions  that  accompany  images  can  affect  how  we  perceive  and 
interpret  them.24  And  this  likely  goes  beyond  mere  captions.  The  brief  itself 
provides  context  and  manages  expectations  for  these  images.  In  one  example 
Porter cites, the plaintiff in a copyright violation case positioned two images side-
by-side, one of his own work and the other, the claimed copyright violator’s. This 
comparison had the effect of highlighting the similarities and downplaying their

differences and may  have helped  form initial impressions of the evidence that 
would be difficult for the responding party to shake.  

Briefing and legal advocacy in general often entail managing expectations and 
influencing  perception.  The  difference is  that  we  are  often  not  as  skeptical  or 
critical of those influences when it comes to images because, as stated above, 
“seeing is believing.”       

But as with many other aspects of appellate practice, advocates can frequently 
find persuasive ways to respond by digging deeper. In one  case, the State used its 
brief to counter the appellate judge’s natural inclination to view the evidence as 
the  trial  court  had.  The  issue  in  the  case,  a  State’s  appeal,  was  reasonable 
suspicion for failure to yield right of way “so closely as to be an immediate hazard 
to the operator’s movement in or across the intersection.” The officer testified that 
the  defendant  nearly  caused  an  accident  when  he  merged  in  front  of  another 
driver already on the roadway, causing the bystander driver to slow down very 
quickly. The officer’s dashcam, which recorded the two vehicles, was introduced 
at  the  suppression  hearing.  The  trial  court  relied  on  the  video  to  rule   in  the 
defendant’s favor, explaining that it showed there was no immediate hazard and 
that  the  other  driver  had  just  “tapped”  his  brakes.  Anticipating  that  appellate 
judges might have the same reaction to the video from watching it a single time, 
the State’s brief deliberately undercut any expectations that video of a near-miss 
accident would have the drama of a Hollywood movie. It incorporated a frame 
from the video supporting the officer’s testimony:  

 

 

20 

Whether we realize it or not, there are always interpretive choices being made 
when we view and use evidence.  Why not do it deliberately.  By analyzing the 
visual  record  to  the  same  extent  we  would  analyze  the  statute’s  language, 
appellate practitioners can contribute to a more convincing and lasting persuasive 
view of the evidence and invite appellate judges to do the same in deciding the 
cases before them.   

2. Making Strategic Choices 

a. Statement of Facts 

i. 

Begin with the Facts 

Attorneys often attempt to write a brief in the order it will be written.  That can 
make the job a lot more complex than necessary.  The best place to start is with 
the facts.  But the key is to tailor the facts to the legal issue.   This means identifying 
the operative facts.  

ith  your  broad-sense  legal  issue  in  mind,  drafting  the  operative  facts  first 
ensures  that  you  know  the  exact  situation  you  are  dealing  with.    This  avoids 
wasting time analyzing a topic that doesn’t really exist because:  

•  you  didn’t  pay  close  enough  attention  to  a  determinative  detail  when 

initially reading the record; 

•  you relied on the opposing party’s rendition of the facts that were wrong; 

21 

                W

 

•  you relied on a faulty memory (your own or that of the trial attorney) of 

what occurred at trial; or 

•  you took a court’s incorrect rendition of the facts at face value. 

Imagine the scenario of writing a thoughtful and thorough analysis on a pretrial 
motion to suppress issue only to realize later that some of the facts relied upon 
by the trial court or the opposing party were admitted after the trial court made 
its  ruling  (and  there  was  no  re-litigation  of  the  issue).    Because  the  post-
suppression-ruling facts cannot be considered in analyzing the issue , you might 
need  to  start  over  or  eliminate  the  issue  entirely.25    Knowing  the  facts  in  play 
should be the first step in your brief building block.  

This  approach  has  the  beneficial  secondary  effect  of  narrowing  your  legal 
research.  If you know that your case contains facts X, Y, and Z, you can eliminate 
caselaw  with  non-analogous  facts  A,  B,  and  C  during  your  in-depth  research 
phase.     And  in  the  process,  you  may realize  the  significance  of  a  fact  initially 
dismissed or undervalued.   

Remember that you can revisit your fact section when you hit a point in argument 
that makes something more (or less) important than you first realized.   

ii.  Myth Busting About Facts  

L
ike  urban  myths,  there  are  certain  misconceptions  held  by  many  appellate 
practitioners regarding the fact section in brief.  It’s time to bust those myths.     

First, you don’t need to include all the facts in your case, so don’t provide a bench-
brief-like summary of the record.   Your fact section is not supposed to replace or 
substitute  the  appellate  court’s  own  record  review.    As  mentioned,  the  art  of 
crafting a fact section involves providing a narrative tailored to your legal claim.   

Next, you can reference facts in your argument section that were not previously 
mentioned in your fact section.  It’s okay for your fact section to be more general 
and  then  build  on  it  later  with  details  in  your  analysis.      For  instance,  you  can 

 

25  See e.g., Rangel v. State,  250  S.W.3d  96,  97-98  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  2008) 
(dismissing  the  State’s  and  Appellant’s  petitions  for  discretionary  review  as 
improvidently  granted  because  none  of  the  evidence  required  to  analyze  the 
ruling was presented to the trial court until after its ruling).   

 

22 

generically list offenses constituting sexual abuse and then later describe them in 
detail as needed to support a sufficiency or harm claim.   Or you can summarize 
testimony  in  the  fact  section  and  later replicate  the  exact  testimony  when it’s 
material to a point of error.     

Third,  you  don’t  need  an  elaborate  fact  section  when  your  issue  is  purely 
procedural.  Again, tailor the facts needed to the issue before the court.  When a 
procedural  issue  is  involved,  the  facts  are  the  transactions  that  set  up  the 
procedural question.   A good example of this is the State’s Brief in Huggins v. 
S
tate,  PD-0590-21,  which  deals  with  a  belated  request  to  invoke  the  right  to 
counsel after it was previously waived.  

iii.  Fact Considerations 

When drafting a fact section, continue to ask yourself if a fact is relevant to your 
issue.  Some practitioners have a habit of being overly detailed.  This happens 
when names and dates are used with no real bearing.  When a court sees names 
and dates, this implicitly suggests that those things will be important to the case.  
Recall “Chekhov’s Gun” rule: “If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, 
then in the following one it should be fired.  Otherwise don't put it there.”  If details 
carry no import to the legal issue, don’t include them because they establish an 
unnecessary and unfulfilled expectation for the reader. 

Do your best to eliminate redundant facts.  As stated before, it’s permissible to set 
out a general factual background and later address the particulars when needed 
to  support  your  legal  argument.    It  can  show  a  lack  of  thoughtfulness  when 
practitioners simply repeat (or even copy and paste) the above-mentioned facts.   
Though it can be difficult to plan to eliminate redundancies in the initial writing 
process, it can certainly be achieved in the editing process by thinking about how 
to introduce facts more generally when greater detail follows.   

Lastly, remember that Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 38.1(g) requires a party 
to set out the pertinent facts “without argument” in the fact section.  One reason 
for  this is  so that  opposing  counsel  and  the  court can  sort  out  the  claims  and 
arguments  actually  being  raised  on  appeal  from  what  may  only  be  sideline, 
gratuitous  complaints  about what  occurred  in  the  trial  court. Good  advocate s, 
obviously, would eliminate any such gratuitous remarks anyway. Another reason 
is so that the appellate court and the parties are dealing with the right facts—i.e., 

 

23 

those relevant under the applicable standard of review. A recitation of the facts in 
the light most favorable to the defense is appropriate when the issue is denial of 
a defensive instruction, not sufficiency review. The no-argument rule should force 
advocates to confront and accept the controlling facts rather than wasting time 
and effort commenting on what they think is unfair about how those facts were 
arrived  at.  As  a  result,  the  briefing  can  advance  beyond  arguments  over 
irrelevancies to a more productive debate about why, despite certain facts against 
the party, it should still prevail.26  

But while the statement of facts should be written without argument, there is still 
room for advocacy in how those facts are presented. “You advance that objective 
by your terminology, by your selection and juxtaposition of the facts, and by the 
degree of prominence you give to each . . . . You will amplify the facts that suggest 
your desired outcome by placing them prominently in the narrative.”27 Criminal 
cases provide great material for the kind of long-arc storytelling that is compelling 
and persuasive—whether it is about the offense or the investigation. And doing 
the initial work of weeding out irrelevancies and accounting for the standard of 
review will free you to use the creative process of narration to highlight facts that 
aid your cause instead of distracting from it.   

iv.  Where to Brief Facts 

Determining where to brief facts can be a demanding organizational exercise.  It 
usually depends on the type and number of issues you are dealing with.  When 
there are numerous issues with specific facts, it may be better to brief the facts by 
the issue in the argument section.  In that case, a more global explanation of the 
facts can be given in the formal fact section.   

 

26 See, e.g., Carter v. State, No. 06-18-00124-CR, 2019 WL 1996533, at *2 (Tex. 
App.—Texarkana  May  7,  2019,  no  pet.)  (ruling  on  the  merits  but  “not 
disagree[ing]”  with  the  State’s  assessment  that  the  defense  brief  violated  Rule 
38.1(g)  by  presenting  only  the  facts  from  the  losing  side  and  being 
argumentative); see also State ex rel. Kilian v. City of W. Linn, 112 Or. App. 549, 
554 (1992) (noting that a lengthy witness-by-witness recitation of the testimony 
favorable to the party “rarely creates a useful impression of the facts”). 
27  Antonin  Scalia  and  Bryan  Garner,  MAKING  YOUR  CASE:  The  Art  of  Persuading 
Judges, at 94 (2008).  

 

24 

If you have a sufficiency or defensive-entitlement issue, the fact section can give 
a comprehensive overview of the facts, with the analysis immediately following at 
the start of the argument section.   If you are the responding party and address 
issues in a different order in which they were first presented, tell the court you 
have altered the order in the reply.  

Overall,  remain  flexible in  your  approach.    Just  because  you  started  using  one 
method to present your facts doesn’t mean you have to stick with it.   Remember 
that  your  finished  product  is  what  matters.    When  the  flow  just  isn’t  working, 
change things up by reorganizing.  Before starting any reorganization, it may be 
helpful to save your new draft under a different name so you can always go back 
to your original material if needed.   

b. Statutory Construction 

Statutory construction issues can be vexing.  Over and over, courts say that the 
plain text controls, subject to narrow exceptions of ambiguity or absurdity.  Even 
if you think that the text is unambiguous, provide an extratextual analysis because 
it’s hard to predict where a court will fall.  You don’t want to be in the position of 
not having weighed in and then having the case decided against you.  Further, 
extratextual sources can be used as additional support for a plain-text analysis or 
call attention to a potential adverse argument that should be addressed.     

In going beyond the plain text, several resources are available to help with your 
research: 

•  Texas Legislature Online 
•  Texas State Library and Archives Commission 
•  Texas State Law Library 
•  Texas Legislative Reference Library 

ever lose sight of the fact that statutory construction issues will frequently affect 

other cases.  It’s essential to ask:  

•  Are other statutes worded similarly and thus will be impacted? 
•  How does the scheme of other codes impact your case or vice-versa? 
•  If your argument prevails, will the rule be tenable when applied in future 

cases?

statute?   

c. Sufficiency 

Because courts are busy, they are anxious to grasp your argument quickly and 
move  on.  This  is  especially  true  of  sufficiency  claims,  which  could  encompass 
challenges to an element's interpretation or proof as to any or all the elements. 
Narrow  the  argument  (or  response)  at  the  top  of  your  issue  with  a  concise 
statement of why you should win before getting into the details, setting out all the 
statutory elements, or inserting a cut-and-paste standard of review paragraph. If 
you  use  a  cut-and-paste  standard,  tailor  it  to  what  is  needed  to  resolve  this 
sufficiency  challenge.  Courts  frequently  reuse  the  same  standard  of  review 
paragraph(s) in opinions. Hence, it is easy for practitioners to follow suit, repeating 
the  same  or  similar  language  in  their  briefs  because  they  believe  this  is  what 
courts  want  to  hear. This  only  encourages  skimming  or  wholesale  skipping  of 
sections  of  your  brief.  Make  what  you  say  count.  The  standard  of  review  for 
sufficiency is probably one of the best known of any. So limit your iteration to only 
the salient parts, said a single time. For the same reason, trim any quotes from 
other cases to a phrase or two. Because sufficiency claims are unique to your set 
of facts, long quotations from other sufficiency cases are seldom helpful.  

  common  mistake  practitioners  make  in  sufficiency  arguments  is  treating  a 
A
recitation of the facts as argument. It’s not. Particularly if you have already set out 
the facts in a separate section of your brief or a subpoint in the issue, use the 
argument section to explain their significance. The narrative you have created will, 
of course, arc in support of your position. Still, unless the court happens to already 
agree with that position, you will have to articulate the connections and rational 
inferences to persuade. 

i.   Be Strategic About What You Argue 

Be  strategic  about  what  you  argue. If  you  are  the  appellant,  skip  surface-level 
claims that can be quickly answered by regurgitating that the jury determines the 
weight and credibility of the evidence (i.e., the child was not credible; the child 
could not have been molested when others were in the home). Consider instead 

 

26 

whether  the  statutory  language  is  susceptible  to  a  different  interpretation, 
requiring more than the State ever dreamed, and so it wasn’t even trying to prove 
it. The defense argument in Nicholson v. State, PD-0963-19, is a prime example.   
There, the defendant was convicted of evading in a vehicle , which criminalizes 
intentionally  fleeing  from  a  person  the  defendant  knows  is  a  peace  officer 
“attempting lawfully to arrest or detain him.” TEX. PENAL CODE § 38.04(a). Earlier 
caselaw had held that the knowledge requirement encompassed the  attempted 
detention, but not its lawfulness. But the statute had since been amended to place 
the word “lawfully” right in the middle of the phrase a defendant had to “know” 
about.  At  trial,  the  State  told  the  jury,  consistent  with  the  caselaw,  that  “the 
defendant doesn’t have to know that the officer lawfully tried to arrest him.” It 
made  no  concerted  effort  to  prove that  fact  because  it  hadn’t  interpreted  the 
statute that way. In this context, the defendant’s plain-language interpretation on 
appeal  opened  up  a  new  avenue  of  argument,  one with  a  lot  of  potential  for 
success despite an unfavorable standard of review. See Nicholson v. State, 594 
S.W.3d 480 (Tex. App.—Waco 2019, pet. granted).  

ii.   Be Strategic About How You Argue 

Numerous sufficiency challenges assert that the evidence of guilt relied solely on 
speculation and include block quotations from Hooper v. State, 214 S.W.3d 19 
(Tex. Crim. App. 2007). This doesn’t make it so. To be successful, whether you are 
arguing sufficiency for the defense or no rational evidence to raise a lesser for the 
State, you need to show the court why the opposing position is irrational. This is a 
difficult  standard  to  meet.  Aim  for  something  violating  the  laws  of  physics, 
contravening  human  experience,  or  being  just  plain  fanciful.  One  particularly 
good example of this on both sides is Melgar v. State, No. PD-0243-20, currently 
pending in the Court of Criminal Appeals.  There, the State’s theory is that the 
defendant killed her husband at home and then staged being trapped in a closet. 
The defense theory is that she, too, was a bona fide victim in the home-invasion. 
The parties each highlight different aspects of the case to support their claim. The 
defense relies on physical evidence undercutting the State’s version (like marks 
from bindings up the defendant’s arms inconsistent with self-imposed bondage) 
and the tenuousness of the State’s trial theory that she wedged a chair under the 
closet doorknob while inside the closet. The State responds with the fact that the 
jury could disbelieve any of the testimony about the state of the evidence when 

 

27 

she  was  discovered,  even  from  the  State’s  own  witnesses.  Both  advocates  go 
beyond the surface-level briefing too common in sufficiency claims.        

d. Strategies for the Argument Se ction Generally 

Regardless of the particular issue you are arguing, a few general strategies apply. 
First, be selective about the cases you brief. Briefing the twelve most cited cases 
on your issue may be fine for pre-writing but no argument should consist of an 
unconnected parade of case-summary paragraphs all beginning with the phrase 
“In such and such case ….” The argument section is the time to focus in on the one 
or two cases that really control, just as you narrow your discussion of the relevant 
facts in your statement of facts. If a case helps your argument but  its holding is 
not really debatable, use only one case—and only cite it. As Scalia and Garner put 
it, “Anything more is just showing off to an unappreciative audience.”28 Save the 
brief explanation of facts and analysis for the cases essential to your argument. 

Second,  remember  that  not  every  case  can  or  should  be  harmonized.  As  you 
search for a legal proposition underlying the cases, you are likely to find cases that 
are wrongly decided, particularly if a legal proposition has never been articulated. 
Outlier cases can distract you  from the guiding principle. Don’t throw out what 
could  be  a  better  rule  just  because  there’s  one  or  two  cases  that  don’t  fit—
especially  if  they  are  unpublished  or  from  a  different  court  of  appeals.  Also 
consider a long game in the Court of Criminal Appeals. Sometimes if you ignore 
what the courts of appeals are doing—even if only temporarily—you can more 
easily identify a rule fitting most of the cases. Be sure to acknowledge that the 
court of appeals cannot overrule a Court of Criminal Appeals case (and it will be 
naturally hesitant to overrule one of its own), but sometimes that’s the way toward 
re-aligning the law with the statute, making a court-made rule stick closer to its 
purpose, or any number of things that advance the law.  

Finally, for questions of first impression, aim to  build a framework of  what has 
occurred in the law before this case so that the next step you want the Court to 
take follows inevitably from this presentation. This is easier said than done. But 
we frequently employ it through narrative in the statement of facts. Adapting that 
idea in your argument section can push your briefing well beyond the basic. For

examples  of  this  build-up  style  in  judicial  opinions, see Watkins v. State,  619 
S.W.3d 265, 274-78 (Tex. Crim. App. 2021), and in a brief, see the State’s short 
amicus brief in Rodriguez v. State, PD-1130-19.  

e.  Keep it to the Record  

On  direct  appeal,  you  are  bound  by  the  trial  record.    This  means,  in  Judge 
Cochran’s  infamous  words,  “swell  stuff”  is  prohibited.29    The  prohibited  “swell 
stuff” includes: 

•  Scientific evidence not subject to judicial notice.30 
•  Facts or materials not in the appellate record. 
•  Reports from the Forensic Science Commission.31   

As with every rule, there are exceptions.  Sometimes extra -record information is 
inextricably tied to a legal issue.  In those rare instances, it may be necessary to 
consult outside resources.  This has been done repeatedly in court-cost cases to 
demonstrate  whether  costs  are  appropriately  dedicated  to  a  criminal  justice 
purpose.32  Outside sources can also fill occasional gaps in the court’s knowledge 

 

29 Hernandez v. State,  116  S.W.3d  26,  30  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  2003)  (“The  State 
Prosecuting Attorney presents a plethora of cites to scientific articles and learned 
treatises, as well as to some cases from other jurisdictions concerning this general 
area of scientific endeavor. This is swell stuff. The trial court should have been 
given this material, and appellant should have been allowed an opportunity to 
cross-examine any witnesses who sponsored it.”).

f. Reducing Your Points for More Efficient Briefing 

The  order  in  which  you  proceed  with  the  parts  of  your  brief  has  already  been 
touched on above.  But more explanation is warranted.  Starting your brief writing 
with the order in which it will be read can create unnecessary work.  To bring more 
efficiency to the writing process, try using the following framework:  

he strategy here is to begin with the facts for the reasons stated above.  The next 
step is to compose your argument section.  This entails fully fleshing out your legal 
argument  and  its  organization.      This  is  the  bulk  of  the  hard  work;  during  this 
process, you solidify the legal issues and operative facts.   

Now  think  about  how  the  argument  section  provides  the  foundation  for  your 
argument  summary.    Once  the  argument  section  is  complete,  you  can  easily

2014,  pet.  ref’d)  (citing  Homeland  Security  website  for  the  definition  of  “ICE 
   
detainer”). 

30 

  T

   

 

transition to the summary of the argument section.  This is, after all, a synopsis of 
everything you just methodically and painstakingly analyzed.    

With the hard work completed, move on to crafting your issues.  Think of your 
issues  as  the  smallest  constituent  part  of  the  summary  of  the  argument  and 
argument.  At  this  point,  you  shouldn’t  have  any  questions  about  the  legal 
principles and operative facts that need to be included.   You can focus on how to 
write  the  issue,  not  what  to  write.    Based  on  experience,  when  a  practitioner 
prematurely drafts the issues—say before writing the main parts of the brief―it 
can negatively affect the writing and research process.  First, your perspective may 
be hampered because you are too tied to the issue you’ve cast.  Second, it may 
ultimately create more work because it is highly likely that you’ll need to redraft 
your issue as your ideas and focus coalesce.   So, it may be beneficial to suppress 
the instinct to start your brief by drafting your issues or continually edit them as 
you proceed with the analysis.   Admittedly, this framework may not work best for 
you, and if that’s the case, see Section 3.iii. below.   

Finally, complete your process with an opening statement (or executive summary) 
at the beginning of your brief.  This  helps the reader quickly grasp what the case 
is about.  Note that most courts do this at the beginning of their opinions because 
of  this.    Follow  their  lead.    A  statement  should  include  the  legal  principles, 
operative facts, and the form of relief that you want.   This is a more condensed 
version of the summary of the argument.   Former CCA Judge Keasler was known 
to have a 75-word limit for opening statements in his opinions.  Though this rule 
may be impossible to follow in all cases, it’s a good guidepost and can force you 
to weed out unnecessary phrases and words.  And in doing this for every case, you 
will learn to become a more concise writer (and hopefully more efficient).    

g.   Use Headings Pe rsuasive ly 

Headings are not only helpful to break up ideas, but they can also be a means to 
persuade.    And  although  their  persuasive  impact  seems  minimal  when  they 
appear in the body of your lengthy argument section, think about their use in a 
table of contents.   When all that is presented are your headings, seen together, 
they can offer a roadmap of your analysis in a persuasive format.  Consider the 
following example: 

 

31 

he table of contents is often an afterthought (if that), but if you strategize with 
persuasive  headings,  you  can  harness  this  brief-content  requirement  into  an 
advocacy tool.    

It can also provide a final chance to check the organization of your argument. 

3. Framing the Issue 

a. Overview 

The playwright Anton Chekhov famously said, “The task of a writer is not to solve 
the  problem  but  to  correctly  pose  the  question.”  This  is  doubly  true  of  the 
appellate practitioner. As explored in more depth later, properly framing the issue 
can  provide  the  Court a  roadmap  for  ruling in  your  favor. A vital piece  of that 
frame  is the  issue  statement. There   are several models  for crafting  good  issue 
statements—Bryan Garner’s Deep Issue 35 and the “Under-Does-When” model36 
are two. But whatever method you choose, a good issue statement includes: 

•  the controlling legal principles (when it needs to), and  
•  only the operative facts.  

 

35 Bryan Garner, THE WINNING BRIEF 53-97 (2d ed. 2003).  
36  Clay  Greenberg  &  Matthew  Weingast,  “Persuasive  Issue  Statements,”  The 
Writing  Center  at  Georgetown  University  Law  Center  2  (2015)  (describing  a 
single-sentence-issue  formula  with  the  following  structure:  “Under  [controlling 
law], does [legal question] when [legally significant facts.]”).    

32 

   

 

          T

 

It needs to convey what the case is poised to decide , which can take some effort 
to distill.  

Early drafts can be meandering, often because the writer hasn’t determined what 
are the controlling principles and facts are or how best to phrase them, as in this 
example: 

The court of appeals misapplied the standard for reviewing relevance 
determinations where its analysis for determining whether the trial 
court abused its discretion in excluding relevant evidence looked to 
whether, based on the trial court's personal evaluation of competing 
or available inferences, it is reasonable to reject the State's proffered 
inferences, when the proper standard looks to whether an appellate 
court can state with confidence that by no reasonable perception of 
common  experience  could  it  be  determined  that  the  proffered 
inference is one that is reasonably available from the evidence. 

This issue statement is overloaded. It asks too much of the reader to  hold these 
details  and  concepts  in  mind  and  follow  the  train  of  thought.  Here’s  a  more 
succinct revision: 

In  affirming  the  trial  court's  decision  to  exclude  evidence  as 
irrelevant, did the lower court wrongly disregard the State's relevance 
theory  because  the  trial  court  did  not  believe  it,  even  though  a 
rational factfinder could have?        

In making it more concise, the revision necessarily omits some ideas present in 
the original, but this is necessary for writing an issue statement. To be understood, 
you have to make some choices. To make it persuasive, you have to make the 
right ones.  

b. Draft the Issue with the Twitte r Limit in Mind 

Anyone who scrolls Twitter knows that you are limited to expressing an idea with 
280 characters.   This can be very difficult when it comes to encapsulating legal 
issues.  But the character allowance provides a helpful guideline  for composing 
issues because it forces you to pare down an issue by identifying what is essential.   
The  following  are  rewritten  issue  examples  taken  from  the  SPA’s  Twitter  feed 
(@OSPATX) notifying practitioners what PDRs the CCA has granted: 

 

33 

c. Revising the Issue Statement a s You Go 

Although, as stated earlier, it is likely more efficient to wait toward the end of the 
writing process to draft your issue statement(s), that may not work for you. If you 
revise as you go, be sure your process helps you identify what details matter and 
when you can be more general. Here’s what that process might look like: 

 

draft  (from Day v. State, PD-0682-21): 
 
t
s
r
F
i

When both the police and motorist know of a warrant for his arrest, 
does an unlawful seizure before that point still make it unlawful to 
detain  the  motorist  and,  when  he  flees,  prevent  a  conviction  for 
evading, or does the discovery of the warrant purge any taint, just as 
in the Fourth Amendment context? 

 

34 

                           

 

M

arkup: 

 

 

Some reductions are obvious—"arrest warrant” instead of “warrant for his arrest”; 
“earlier”  instead  of  “before  that  point.”  Other  things,  like  “in  the  Fourth 
Amendment context,” are implicit (just by mentioning purging taint) and can be 
eliminated. Also, I tend to say things in two different ways, first one way and then 
it’s  opposite,  in  case  one  way  “speaks”  to  the  reader  better.  Application 
paragraphs of jury charges do this with the “converse” instruction (i.e., “If you do 
not so find, you will acquit the defendant.”). But it’s unnecessary bulk in an issue 
statement and, worse, can confuse the reader expecting each clause to convey 
something new (not just say the same thing differently).  

Other  things  are  more  fundamentally  flawed  and  appear  in  this  drafting  stage 
because I haven’t worked out their importance. For example, my facts involve an 
unlawful  seizure,  but  does  that  matter?  It’s  an  evading  case.  Won’t  any  prior 
illegality do? The initial draft begins with the fact that the police and motorist both 
know of the existence of a warrant. On revision, this is unimportant but, more than 
that, steals a prime position from what I want the court most to focus on:  Eureka, 
there’s a warrant! 

After  further  drafting  and  working  out  what’s  important  through  writing  (and 
sometimes more research), you can weed out the unimportant detail and manage 
to talk about something concrete too. While there’s always room for improvement 
and further revision, I finally settled on this: 

 

35 

Will discovery of an arrest warrant necessarily render an attempted 
seizure  on  the  warrant  “lawful”  (despite  an  earlier  illegality)  for 
purposes of evading arrest? 

d. The Deep Issue 

Bryan Garner argues that practitioners should package their issue statement with 
what the judge needs to understand the case and decide it in the writer’s favor, 
all in 90 seconds.37 He advocates that practitioners do this through a syllogism in 
the following format: 

  Major Premise—Principle of Law 

  Minor Premise—Facts of the Case 

 

Question (essentially the conclusion that follows)  

He provides the following criminal-case example: 

A
  criminal  defendant  has  the  right  to  be  present  whenever 
prospective jurors are questioned on voir dire. During voir dire in this 
murder case, a prospective juror was questioned by the judge at the 
bench. Williams was present and positioned so that he could hear the 
conversation. He asked to approach the bench while the prospective 
juror  was  questioned,  but  his  request  was  denied.  Did  that  denial 
violate Williams’s right to be present?38 

In our experience, however, in criminal cases, particularly in the CCA, the Court is 
often familiar with the controlling principle of law so that it doesn’t have to be 
overtly stated. To take one recognizable case, Derichsweiler v. State, 348 S.W.3d 
906 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011), one could imagine the following syllogism: 

36 

 

37 Garner, THE WINNING BRIEF at 55.  
38 Id. at 78.  

       

 

lthough the Court focused on whether there had to be reasonable suspicion of 
a particular crime (ultimately holding there did not), this concept could easily be 
incorporated into a single-sentence issue. The major premise of what is generally 
required  for  reasonable  suspicion  could  be  skipped  since  it  is  already  widely 
known. 

This will not always be the case, though. When your court is not familiar with the 
controlling  law  (for  little-used  statutes  or  highly  specialized  areas  of  law,  for 
example), Garner’s model could aid the court. Here’s one such recent example in 
the CCA: 

(from Brown v. State, PD-0034-20)  

Article 46B.0095 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure allows for 
commitment of an incompetent defendant for the "maximum term 
provided  by  law  for  the  offense  for  which  the  defendant  was  to  
be    tried."    The  maximum  term  of  confinement  for  a  juvenile 
adjudicated for a first-degree felony offense is forty years if the State 
obtains grand jury approval for a determinate-sentence.  What, then, 
is "the maximum term provided by law" for determining the length of 
mental-health commitment for a juvenile who is accused of a crime 
severe enough to be determinate-sentence eligible but is found unfit 
to proceed before a grand jury could make a determinate-sentence 
finding? 

Another  potentially  persuasive  use  of  Garner’s  model  is  in  arguing  against  an 
expansion of a legal doctrine, as in this example by law professor and Supreme 
Court advocate Jeffrey Fisher in Hemphill v. New York, No. 20-637: 

A
 litigant’s argumentation or introduction of evidence at trial is often 
deemed to “open the door” to the admission of responsive evidence 
that would otherwise be barred by the rules of evidence.  

The question presented is:  Whether, or under what circumstances, a 
criminal defendant who opens the door to responsive evidence also 
forfeits  his  right  to  exclude  evidence  otherwise  barred  by  the 
Confrontation Clause. 

37 

  A

 

Note  that  even  here,  Fisher  provides  a  single -statement  issue  for  the  court,  a 
practice that we support.  

At the other extreme are issue statements that never collect in one digestible form 
what the advocate sees as the controlling law and facts in the case. This is a missed 
opportunity for advocacy at best, and, at worst, can be a sign of a total lack of 
framing of the issue. In one case before the CCA, the defense ide ntified a question 
that has been an unresolved issue in Texas for some time: Are anticipatory search 
warrants prohibited under Texas law. Parker v. State, PD-0388-21. While this is 
clearly the “issue” in the case in one sense, it does not provide the framework for 
why the defense should win. It doesn’t identify what law should control or when. 
The  Court  may  find  this  in  the  brief,  of  course,  but when  the  brief  writer  sets 
everything out in one short section by building that frame around the issue, she 
can be much more persuasive and save the Court time, too. Likewise , the State, 
in  response,  can  frame  the  issue  in  a  way  that  favors  its  position.  One  might 
imagine the parties framing the issue in Parker as follows: 

hile putting this information in your issue statement is likely unwieldy for many 
criminal  cases,  we  still  recommend  that  it  appear  in  condensed  form  (like  an 

 

38

executive  summary)  somewhere  in  your  brief—either  in  an  initial  opening 
paragraph or at the top of each issue. 

4. Breaking the Mold: Things to Help You Grow 

a.  Mistakes 

Mistakes are universal, and making them is expected.  The saying goes, “It’s not 
a matter of if but when.”  How you handle mistakes makes a difference to your 
professional growth and credibility.    

L
et Go of a Bad Argument  
 common mistake is to hold on to a flawed argument or strategy.  Don’t trap 
A
yourself in plan-continuation bias where you fail to stop, think of alternatives, and 
course correct.   When something’s not working in your favor, learn  to let it go, 
even when you’ve spent hours or days researching and writing.  Set aside your 
inclination to stay the course or keep material just because of all the time and 
effort you spent on it.   Know that you’ve benefitted from learning something new, 
and hope that maybe (just maybe) one day this material will be helpful in another 
case.    

ss Up and Correct Mistakes 

We’re all familiar with that gut-sinking feeling when you realize that you’ve made 
a material mistake in a document already filed in court.  With angst swimming in 
your mind, you then ponder your options.  But there’s only one right option: fess 
up and correct it when possible.   It can be difficult to do, but you owe the court 
candor.  TEX. R. PROF. RESPONSIBILITY 3.03(a).  And things would be far worse if it 
went uncorrected and was seized upon by opposing counsel or the court in an 
opinion.    In the end, your credibility is at issue in your current case and future 
cases.   

arn from Your Analytical Mistakes 

You can learn from your analytical mistakes by comparing your argument and the 
argument  that  the  court  ultimately  adopted,  even  when  you’re  the  prevailing 
party.  Don’t just be satisfied that you won; seriously consider the analysis that you 
may have missed.   
 

39 

  Fe

  Le

 

40 

And  if  your  analytical  mistake  becomes  apparent  upon  reading  opposing 
counsel’s brief, dig in and remedy it with a response.   

Understanding of Others’ Mistakes 
 

When  you  confront  another  person’s  mistake,  assume  it  is  just  that  without 
inferring any malintent.  Remember that it’s when, not if, and think about how 
you’d like to be treated had it been your “when” moment.   You can respectfully 
point out a mistake in a neutral manner without engaging in any personal attacks 
or taking it personally.  How you treat others affects your credibility with the court 
and other practitioners.  Have no doubt that unprofessional behavior does not go 
unnoticed by judges and their staff and will be recalled every time you appear in 
a future case . . . you just may not be aware of it.   

b. Hypotheses and Rabbit Trails 

Encourage professional growth by accepting that there’s more to discover  and 
consider  beyond  your  initial  impressions.    Always  be  curious  in  developing  an 
argument  by  taking  the  rabbit  trails  you  will  inevitably  find  while  testing  your 
hypothesis.    Press  on  and exhaust  the  possibilities  through  to  a  resolution.    If 
you’ve decided to discount an angle , ask yourself if it’s something that should be 
pointed out to the court and opposing counsel.  Frequently, another open and 
curious mind will land on the same question, so it could help explain why you’ve 
ruled out a particular rabbit trail and potentially save the court from having to 
rehash it unnecessarily.    

c.  Criticism Improves Your Skills and Work-Product 

Legal writing and analysis are personal, so it’s hard to place yourself in the position 
to be critiqued intentionally.  However, it’s necessary to grow and improve.  And 
isn’t it much better to get it from a trusted colleague rather than opposing counsel 
or the court?  Seek out a colleague with more experience who is willing to take 
the time to help sharpen your skills.  Finding the right fit for your style may take 
some trial and error, but an experienced practitioner’s critical feedback will be 
invaluable in the short and long term.   

If you are a solo practitioner or the only appellate practitioner in an office, you 
may need to look outside your office for help.  Word of mouth among our small 

    Be

 

group of criminal appellate practitioners is  probably the best  way  to  identify  a 
person, and don’t forget about those who have recently retired but would like to 
stay somewhat active in the field.  If you work among other appellate attorneys, 
you can try to create reciprocal relationships that can  support all of you.   

We’ve all benefitted from knowledgeable mentors along the way, so get past your 
fear that others will think it’s an imposition to help more junior attorneys.  Those 
with experience are often happy to have a chance to pay it forward.  And, at the 
very  least,  you’ve  broadened  your  network  by  interacting  with  someone  with 
whom you will likely cross paths in the future.    

d.  Invent Words or Phra ses 

One trick to help enliven your briefs is to replace repetitive, wordy phrases with a 
single-word concept. For example, if you find yourself repeatedly typing phrases 
like  “whether the defendant was  entitled  to  an instruction on  self-defense and 
defense of others,” create a shorthand for the concept. When I joined the State 
Prosecuting Attorney’s Office, I noticed Stacey Soule and John Messinger doing 
this—and it’s really an advance. They use the word “entitlement,” and even as a 
reader encounters this shorthand for the first time, in context, it is clear what it 
refers to.  

Don’t be afraid to coin a phrase for a doctrine if there isn’t already one in use or if 
a traditional name has been criticized. See State’s Brief, Cook v. State, No. PD-
0850-21 (suggesting “remedial cumulative evidence doctrine” to replace wide-
ranging  “curative  admissibility”).  Names  like  the  “Barker factors”  started  with 
someone seizing on a convenient shorthand and others catching on.39 There’s no 
reason why you can’t be the one to name the next doctrine or test.   

e.   Freedom from Citations 

The  appellate  practitioner  is  trained  to  have  a  citation  to  back  up  every 
proposition.    But  that  isn’t  always  possible,  and  it’s  our  job  to  shepherd  the 
formation and advancement of the law.   Move past feeling uncomfortable, and 

 

39 “How a Word Gets Into the Dictionary,” Merriam-Webster (“A word gets into a 
dictionary when it is used by many people who all agree that it means the 
same thing.”). 

 

41 

don’t unduly restrict yourself from making an argument just because you don’t 
have a case on point.  In some instances, particularly when urging something new, 
your argument will rely on common sense.    Just say it.  The caveat is that it’s 
important to show the logic underpinning your work.  Take the reader through 
your thought process step-by-step.    

Occasionally, an issue has no precedent and truly is one of first impression.  This 
is a wonderful opportunity to exert your ability to make a logical argument that 
can be applied in future cases.  A recent example of this is McCurley v. State, No. 
02-21-00122-CR.  McCurley involves the use of novel genealogical DNA evidence 
generated by a lab not accredited by the Texas Forensic Commission.  The crux is 
how accreditation impacts the admissibility of a novel type of DNA evidence that 
is so new no accreditation is available and temporary accreditation is not required.  
This case being the first of its kind exemplifies pure lawyering at its best.   

In Ortiz v. State,  PD-1061-19,  the  State  presented  a  novel  twist  on  occlusion 
assault that challenged well-established law: 

                     

42 

And, in doing so in Ortiz, the State fleshed out its thought process:  

 

                   

43 

e careful not to displace research, however.  When you can, find an analogous 
proposition to draw upon.   The most common practice is to use a Cf. cite to an 
authority with an obviously related principle.   

              B

 

 

ut sometimes it’s necessary to apply a more advanced rule to uncharted territory.  
Take, for example, the rule that inchoate offenses in Title 4 of the Penal Code 
cannot be exported to non-Penal Code offenses and the converse consequence 
that non-Penal Code offenses cannot be imported into Titles 4 through 11.  State 
v
Colyandro, 233 S.W.3d 870, 876, 884 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).  In Chase v. State, 
.
 
PD-1768-13, the State argued for an extension of that rule to non-Penal Code 
defenses  to  preclude  the  import  of  extra-Penal  Code  defenses  to  Penal  Code 
offenses.  Though the State lost this case,40 it demonstrates how larger system-
based legal principles can be used to further an analogous but novel point.  

f.  Think in Terms of Systems and Consequences 

Recognize that your arguments will likely impact other areas of the law and vice 
versa.  You should always ask yourself what other areas of law will be affected or 

 

40 Chase v. State,  448  S.W.3d  6,  13-15  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  2014)  (“We  reject  the 
State’s  contention  that  §  1.03(b)  bars  the  application  of  a  non-Penal-Code 
defense to a Penal Code offense.”).  

44 

         

                B

 

what areas of law need to be considered in making your argument.  Playing out 
issues  to  see  how  they  fit  within  the  legal  system  and  their  consequences 
generally require a broad understanding of Texas criminal law that comes with 
many years of experience.   But even as a new attorney, you need to be aware of 
related issues you inevitably don’t know and do your best to identify them.   Be 
patient and humble and expect that it will take time and effort to develop these 
skills.  Again, seek out a trusted colleague and ask for help when you need it.   

Systems 
For example, consider the following issue from Roland v. State, PD-0035-21: Do 
county  courts  have  jurisdiction  concurrent  with  district  courts  over  official 
misconduct  cases?    This  issue  raised  several  ancillary  questions  related  to  a 
change in jurisdiction, should the Court find concurrent jurisdiction, that needed 
to be addressed for the Court in deciding the issue:    

onsequences 
L
ikewise, you may need to explain to the court how your argument will apply to a 
statutory scheme beyond your case.  In Prichard v. State, PD-0712-16, the State 
proposed  that  the  Court  construe  cruelty  to  non-livestock  animal  offenses  to 
authorize a deadly weapon finding.  The State’s argument, if accepted, would have 
impacted future  cases beyond the  statutory subsection charged.  Therefore, in 
graph format, the State laid out when a deadly weapon finding would apply to the 
various statutory subsections:

ystems and consequences can intersect.  In Bowen v. State, the CCA broke new 
ground  and  authorized  reformation  to  the  base  offense  when  the  evidence 
supporting the aggravating element was insufficient.  374 S.W.3d 427 (Tex. Crim. 
App. 2012).   That led to Thornton v. State, where the CCA reformed to the lesser 
offense of attempt.  425 S.W.3d 289 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014).   Bowen and Thornton 
paved the way for Walker v. State, which  applied reformation to a lesser when 
there was a conviction for a legally non-existent greater offense.  594 S.W.3d 330 
(Tex. Crim. App. 2020).   Along the way, other legal issues have spawned from 
owen’s reformation rule.  Now there is a new area in which practitioners must

Another  area  where  consequences  are  important  to  predict  is  in  a  case  that 
presents some type of extraordinary bad fact.   This typically happens in a State’s 
case in which the State wants to win because the facts surrounding the crime were 
egregious  or  the  conviction  is  questionable  in  hindsight  or  may  raise  serious 
ethical concerns.45    In the former, the State may feel compelled to present an 
argument that would harm the State’s long-term interests if applied in the future.  
In the latter situation, the State may want to confess error without realizing the 
case’s status as future precedent.  Prosecutors must think of how the rule of law 
they  ask  for  will  be  applied  in  the  court  of  appeals  district  or  statewide.  
Undoubtedly, prosecutors are duty-bound to  see that justice is done, TEX. CODE 
CRIM. PROC. art. 2.01, but if, in the long run, a position could potentially harm the 
State  (on  a  macro  scale  due  to  Texas’  decentralized  prosecution  model),  a 
prosecutor should consider how to confine it without   overtly betraying the rule 
of law.   
 

g.  Overcoming Bad Pre cedent 

It’s  not  unusual  for  a  party’s  position  to  be  controlled  by  negative  precedent.  
Though the court of appeals may be bound by precedent, that doesn’t mean it has 
to be the end of the matter.  All is not lost.  Set your case up for review by the CCA 
by providing the lower court with the argument you would want them to adopt if 
they could.  This gives the lower court an opportunity to urge the CCA to grant 
review to revisit an issue and overrule precedent.46  Additionally, it can garner a 

 

43 See, e.g., Do v. State, PD-0556-20: (asking whether the 15. DWI enhancement 
is a guilt or punishment issue but the opinion left it unresolved).  
44 See, e.g., Ortiz v. State, S.W.3d 804 (Tex. Crim. App. 2021) (simple assault is not 
a lesser of occlusion assault).  
45 Because defense attorneys are duty-bound to their client’s interests, they don’t 
typically confront these types of dilemmas.  
46 See, e.g., Colyandro,  233  S.W.3d  at 873  (“But  the  court  did  suggest  that  we 
revisit Baker, stating that “Baker appears to be based on questionable reasoning 
and is arguably in conflict with the history of the criminal conspiracy offense in 
Texas  as  well  as  the  growing  legislative  trend  to  propagate  felony  offenses

concurring or dissenting opinion by a justice that does the same.  Having a lower-
court or a lower-court justice on your side when petitioning for review can help 
get your case granted and case law overturned.   

h.  Legal It Up 

Thinking of new approaches to issues isn’t always straightforward.  You will need 
to push yourself  beyond reflexively accepting the  status  quo.   There are a few 
avenues you can take to help formulate a viable legal question: 

•  Consider whether the standard of review is appropriate.47 
•  Consider who should bear the burden of production or persuasion.48  
•  Revisit  a  proposition’s  point  of  origin  to  determine  whether  it  has  been 

improperly applied or expanded beyond its original justification.49   

 

throughout the various statutory codes.”);  Watkins v. State, 554 S.W.3d 819, 821 
(Tex. App.—Waco 2018), rev'd and remanded, 619 S.W.3d 265 (Tex. Crim. App. 
2021) (“applying well-established precedent from the Court of Criminal Appeals, 
by which this Court is bound, we are constrained to hold that the definition or 
standard  we  must  use  to  determine  whether  the  objectionable  evidence  was 
material is the same after the passage of the Michael Morton Act as it was before 
passage,  regardless  of  what  the  Legislature  may  have  thought  or  intended  to 
accomplish.”). 
47  See, e.g., Matlock v. State, 392 S.W.3d 662, 667 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013) (“The 
State petitioned this Court, arguing that the court of appeals erred by applying a 
factual-sufficiency  standard  of  review  in  deciding  whether  the  evidence  was 
legally sufficient to satisfy appellant's burden to prove his affirmative defense.”). 
48  See, e.g., State’s Brief White v. State, PD-0442-17 (“Whether the proponent of 
evidence at trial has the burden of showing statutory compliance in response to 
an objection under Article 38.23 (the Texas exclusionary rule.”).  
49 See, e.g, Ash v. State, 533 S.W.3d 878, 883 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017) (“The State 
argues that we have alternately stated that a witness is an accomplice as a matter 
of law if he could have been charged with the same offense as the defendant, a 
lesser-included  of  that  offense,  or  when  the  evidence  clearly  shows  that  the 
witness could have been so charged. We agree, and we take this opportunity to 
clarify any confusion.”).

•  Ask whether the principle has been undermined by more recent law.50 

Considering  these  points  implores  you  to  question  the  law  and  its  current 
application. 

5. Breaking the Mold: Things to Remember 

It’s important to challenge your assumptions and question everything, even if it’s 
to guide you back to basic matters.  Too frequently, appellate practitioners get 
bogged down in a merits issue or distracted by a trending topic.   There are a few 
issues that are always worth vetting: 

•  Preservation.  Don’t forget that some issues require specificity to preserve 
for  appellate  review,  especially  those  that  can  be  raised  as  pretrial 
suppression issues.  

•  Category of Right at Issue.   It may seem like all the rights and prohibitions 
have  been neatly categorized as  systemic,  waivable, or forfeitable under 
arin v. State.  851 S.W.2d 275 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993).  But far from it.  
M
•  Estoppel.  Even when preservation does not apply, estoppel may still be a 

bar to review.  Prystash v. State, 3 S.W.3d 52 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).  

6.  Oral Argument 

There  are  two  points  about  oral  argument  that  are  worth  pointing  out  after 
viewing years of CCA arguments.  First, don’t split argument with another attorney.   
While issues can be cabined, a court’s discussion will not be separated.  Judges 
and  Justices  want  to  talk  about a  problem  on  their  time  and  their  prompting.  
Splitting argument prevents this.  Relatedly, be able to pivot among topics; don’t 
rebuff a question because, in your mind, you haven’t switched to that topic yet.  
Argument is for the court, and you are there to assist it and not be a roadblock to 
helpful discourse. 

 

50  See, e.g., Miller v. State, 457 S.W.3d 919, 927 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015) (adopting 
closely  related  crimes  exception  to  the  corpus  delicti  rule); Shumway v. State, 
__SW.3d__,  PD-0108/09-20,  2022  WL  301737,  at  *8-9  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  2022) 
(adopting incapable of outcry exception to the corpus delicti rule).

7.  Conclusion 

Have faith in yourself.  It’s easy to undermine your worth by comparing yourself 
to other successful practitioners or those who held a position before you.  But you 
need to trust your voice and instincts and be open to learning and boosting your 
appellate advocacy.
