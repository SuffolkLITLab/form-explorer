Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 
 
Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 
 

APPEAL NO.: 

18-001 

ESPONDENT: 

Judge Justin Sanderson, 60th District Court 

ATE: 

 

April 13, 2018 

 

 

 

PECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge Stephen B. Ables, Chairman; Judge Mary Murphy;1 Judge 
Billy Ray Stubblefield; Judge Sid Harle; Judge Kelly G. Moore 

Petitioner requested the following from Respondent: 1) copies of all emails sent and received 
from Respondent’s government email accounts during a specific time period, 2) copies of all emails 
sent and received from the government email accounts of two of Respondent’s employees during a 
specific time period, 3) copies of all emails sent and received from Respondent’s personal email 
accounts during a specific time period regarding a specific lawsuit, 4) copies of all emails sent and 
received from Respondent’s personal email accounts during a specific time period that reference 
specific named individuals, 5) copies of all emails sent and received from Respondent’s government 
email accounts  and those of Respondent’s employees  during  a specific time period regarding a 
specific lawsuit, 6) copies of all emails sent and received from Respondent’s and Respondent’s 
employees’ government email accounts during a specific time period that reference specific named 
individuals,  7)  copies  of  all  text  messages  sent  and  received  from  Respondent’s  personal  and 
government cell phones that reference specific named individuals during a specific time period, 8) 
copies of Respondent’s telephone logs, bills, or records showing all incoming and outgoing calls on 
specific dates, 9) copies of any communications referencing, pertaining to, or memorializing any 
communications between Respondent or Respondent’s employees and a federal bankruptcy court and 
specific named individuals regarding a specific case during a specific time period, and 10) a copy of 
a subpoena return regarding a specific witness in a specific case. Respondent did not respond to 
Petitioner’s request; Petitioner then filed this appeal.  

 
 
We  first  address  the  requests  numbered  1  and  2  above.    Respondent  maintains  that  the 
requests for all of Respondent’s emails and Respondent’s employees’ emails for a specific time 
period are overly broad and burdensome.  We agree with Respondent.  However, when such requests 
are made, we recommend that records custodians inform requestors so that they may narrow their 
requests or provide additional information so that the records they are seeking can be identified.  
This approach is consistent with the policy of Rule 12 that it be liberally construed to achieve its 
purpose to provide public access to information in the judiciary.  Accordingly, Petitioner should be 
allowed the opportunity to narrow his request or provide additional information so that Respondent 
can determine if any records responsive to the request exist. 

                                                
1 Presiding Judge Mary Murphy did not participate in the decision.

In his response to this appeal, Respondent included for our review emails that he believes 
may be responsive to Petitioner’s request number 1.  Respondent informs us that he identified these 
emails  based  on  the  other  requests  made  by  Petitioner  regarding  a  specific  case  and  specific 
individuals. We have reviewed the emails Respondent has submitted and conclude that they all 
pertain to court cases.   

Rule 12 applies to the denial of access to judicial records.  Rule 12.2(d) defines a “judicial 
record” as one that is “made or maintained by or for a court or judicial agency in its regular course of 
business but not pertaining to its adjudicative function, regardless of whether that function relates to 
a specific case.  A record of any nature created, produced, or filed in connection with any matter 
that is or has been before a court is not a judicial record.”  (Emphasis added.)  Because all the 
emails submitted by Petitioner in response to request number 1 relate to specific cases, they are not 
judicial records under Rule 12.  See Rule 12 Decisions Nos. 15-017, 11-004, and 00-001.  

We next address the requests numbered 3, 5, 9 and 10.  These requests are also for records 
that pertain to a specific case.  Accordingly, if any records exist that are responsive to these requests, 
they are not subject to Rule 12.2 

Regarding request number 6, we have reviewed the responsive emails submitted for our 

review and conclude that they also pertain to a specific case and are not subject to Rule 12. 

  
Respondent has provided for our review a copy of telephone bills responsive to Petitioner’s 
request number 8 for telephone logs, bills, or records.  Telephone bills are judicial records and must 
be released unless a Rule 12 exemption applies. See Rule 12 Decision Nos. 17-004 and 11-009. 
Respondent did not raise any exemptions from disclosure for our consideration and we are unable to 
conclude that any apply based on our review of the submitted records.   

Lastly, Respondent has asserted that he does not have any records responsive to numbers 3, 4, 
7, and 10. A records custodian is not required to create a document in response to a request.3  See 
Rule 12.4(a)(1) and Rule 12 Decision No. 16-012. Therefore, Respondent has no further obligation 
regarding this request. 

In summary, Petitioner should be given the opportunity to narrow his request or provide 
additional information to Respondent regarding his requests numbered 1 and 2 above. The records 
responsive to numbers 1, 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10, if any, pertain to court cases.  Therefore, they are not 
judicial records as defined by Rule 12 and we are without authority to grant the petition in whole or 
in  part  or sustain the denial of access to these records.  Respondent does not have  any records 
responsive  to  numbers  3,  4,  7,  and  10;  therefore,  no  further  action  regarding  these  requests  is 
required under Rule 12.  The records responsive to request number 8 are not exempt from disclosure. 
Accordingly, Petitioner’s appeal regarding the denial of access to the records responsive to request 
number 8 is granted.  

                                                
2 We note that Respondent has asserted in his response that he does not have any records responsive to numbers 3 
and 10. 
3 We also note that if records responsive to numbers 3 and 10 existed, they would not be subject to Rule 12 because 
they are requests for case records.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
