ORDER DECLARING ELIJAH W. RATCLIFF A VEXATIOUS LITIGANT 

On July 7, 2022 in accordance with TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 11.053, this Court 

held a hearing on Defendant The State of Texas’ Motion to Declare Elijah W. Ratcliff a Vexatious 

Litigant.  The State of Texas’ Motion to Declare Elijah W. Ratcliff a Vexatious Litigant was filed 

on  or  before  the  90th  day  after  of  the  filing  of  The  State  of  Texas’  Answer  in  this  lawsuit,  in 

accordance with TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 11.051. All parties received proper notice of this 

hearing, in accordance with TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 11.053.  Plaintiff Elijah W. Ratcliff 

(“Plaintiff”) was served with the Motion and Notice of this Hearing and:  

 

 

_X__ did appear. 

_____ did not appear. 

parties, enters the following order: 

  The Court having reviewed the motion, pleadings, the law, evidence and arguments of all 

On April 18, 2022, Elijah W. Ratcliff filed this lawsuit, alleging that The State of Texas is 

responsible  for  state  torts,  violations  of  the  U.S.  Constitution,  and  the  Texas  Deceptive  Trade 

Practices Act.  (Petition).  Elijah W. Ratcliff presents no factual allegations on the part of The State 

of Texas. (Petition).  Elijah W. Ratcliff seeks $100 million in damages.  (Petition, p. 10). 

Elijah W.  Ratcliff  does  not  allege  or  produce  any  evidence  to  establish  a  waiver  of  the 

sovereign immunity of The State of Texas.  Further, Elijah W. Ratcliff does not have standing to 

bring any of his claims in this lawsuit against The State of Texas because Elijah W. Ratcliff does 

not present an alleged injury that is “fairly traceable” to the specific conduct of The State of Texas, 

and this Court cannot redress any alleged injury because of sovereign immunity.  As a result, this 

Court also lacks subject matter jurisdiction to entertain this lawsuit. 

Accordingly, there is not a reasonable probability that Elijah W. Ratcliff will prevail in the 

litigation against The State of Texas. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 11.054 

Over the last seven years, Elijah W. Ratcliff has filed this and commenced, prosecuted, or 

maintained as a pro se litigant numerous other litigations other than in small claims court that have 

been finally determined adversely to him or determined to be groundless.  See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & 

REM. CODE § 11.054(1)(A) and (C).  These include, but are not limited to the following litigations 

finally determined adversely to Elijah W. Ratcliff: 

Elijah W. Ratcliff v. Jenkins and Young, P.C., et al.; Cause No. 5:22-cv-00048; in 
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Lubbock 
Division, dismissed April 6, 2022; 
 
Elijah W. Ratcliff v. State of Texas, et al.; Civil Action No. 9:21-cv-00246; in the 
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Lufkin Division, 
dismissed December 22, 2021; 

Ratcliff v. Greyhound Lines, Inc., No. 18-CV-9672 (LLS), 2018 WL 10945322, at 
*1 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 20, 2018), aff'd sub nom. Ratcliff v. Greyhound Bus Lines, 
Inc., 792 F. App'x 121 (2d Cir. 2020)

Ratcliff v. Texas, et al., No. 9:15-CV-106, 2017 WL 907992, (E.D. Tex. Mar. 7, 
2017), aff'd, 699 F. App'x 410 (5th Cir. 2017) 

In re Ratcliff, 578 U.S. 1011, 136 S. Ct. 2387, 195 L. Ed. 2d 775 (2016) 
(mandamus denied). 
 

Additionally,  after  a  litigation  has  been  finally  determined  against  Elijah  W.  Ratcliff, 

Ratcliff repeatedly relitigated or attempted to relitigate, pro se, the validity of the determination 

against the State of Texas, which was the same defendant as to whom the litigation was finally 

determined.  See  TEX.  CIV.  PRAC.  &  REM.  CODE  §  11.054(2)(A).      Elijah  W.  Ratcliff  has  also 

repeatedly relitigated or attempted to relitigate, pro se, the cause of action, claim, controversy, or 

any of the issues of fact or law determined or concluded by the final determination against the 

State of Texas, which was the same defendant as to whom the litigation was finally determined.  

See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 11.054(2)(B).  Before the filing of this lawsuit, the same 

causes of action,  claims,  controversies, and issues of  fact  or law were  determined adversely to 

Elijah W. Ratcliff and in favor of the State of Texas in litigations in 2009, 2011, and 2015.  See 

Elijah W. Ratcliff v. State of Texas, et al.; Civil Action No. 9:21-cv-00246; Dkt. 17 at *3 (E.D.Tx. 

Dec. 22, 2021). 

Further, Elijah W. Ratcliff has a previous determination that he is a vexatious litigant by a 

federal court in an action or proceeding based on the same or substantially similar facts, transition, 

or occurrence.  See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 11.054.  Two of these are: 

•  Ratcliff v. Texas, No. 9:15-CV-106, 2017 WL 907992, at *1-2 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 7, 2017), 
aff'd, 699 F. App'x 410 (5th Cir. 2017) (because of his “vexatious filings that are a flagrant 
abuse of judicial process,” Ratcliff is sanctioned and “enjoined from filing any further 
action,  complaint,  or  motion  in  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the  Eastern 
District of Texas without first paying the sanction ordered, and the previous sanctions 
ordered by this court, and obtaining leave from the Chief Judge of the United States 
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas”) (emphasis added); and 
 

•  Ratcliff v. Unauthorized Prac. of L. Comm. and the State of Texas, No. 9:13-CV-70, 2013 
WL  4029045,  at  *1  (E.D.  Tex.  Aug.  6,  2013)  (“Ratcliff  has  a  lengthy  history  of  filing 

3 

 

 

frivolous lawsuits and lawsuits with no basis for federal jurisdiction. Multiple sanctions 
have not deterred Ratcliff's vexatious litigation practices”; p. 3: noting that in 2006, 
Ratcliff was sanctioned “as a result of his vexatious litigation practices,” but because that 
did not deter him, he was “barred from filing any new lawsuits or pleadings in closed 
cases without prior judicial approval finding that the pleading has been filed in good 
faith”) (emphasis added). 

n addition, Elijah W. Ratcliff has been determined to be a vexatious litigant by two other courts 

•  Ratcliff  v.  Greyhound  Lines,  Inc.,  No.  18-CV-9672  (LLS),  2018  WL  10945322,  at  *4 
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 20, 2018), (Exhibit F, p. 1, fn 1: “By order dated July 31, 2014, this Court 
barred  Plaintiff  from  filing  future  civil  actions  in  this  Court  in  forma  pauperis 
without leave of the Court. Ratcliff v. Lighty, No. 14-CV-2704 (LAP) (S.D.N.Y. July 31, 
2014)”) (emphasis added).   

ourts cannot allow litigants to abuse the judicial system and harass their victims without 

  C

•  Ratcliff v. McKeever, No. H-85-CV-2490, 1986 WL 256 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 17, 1986) 
(enjoining Plaintiff “from refiling tax refund suits in [that court] for the years 1977 
through 1981”), aff'd, 807 F.2d 994 (5th Cir. 1986) (table opinion)  

consequence.  Accordingly, the Court FINDS that Elijah W. Ratcliff is such a litigant, and his 

conduct is subject to review and action by this Court. 

Chapter 11 of the TEXAS CIVIL PRACTICE AND REMEDIES CODE, provides this Court with 

the authority to prevent Elijah W. Ratcliff from using the judicial system to retaliate against and 

in proceedings unrelated to this lawsuit: 

harass The State of Texas or any other party. 

ORDER 

 

Chapter 11 of the TEXAS CIVIL PRACTICE AND REMEDIES CODE governs suits brought by 

vexatious litigants.  The Court may, on defendant’s motion or sua sponte, designate a party as a 

vexatious litigant.  TEX. CIV. PRAC. REM. CODE § 11.101.   

A party may be declared a vexatious litigant if there is not a reasonable probability that he 

will prevail in litigation and in the seven-year period immediately preceding the date the defendant 

makes the motion under Section 11.051, the party has commenced, prosecuted, or maintained at 

4 

  I

 

 

least five litigations as a pro se litigant other than in a small claims court that have been finally 

determined adversely to the plaintiff, OR if a plaintiff repeatedly relitigates issues, causes of action, 

claims, or the validity of such determinations in prior lawsuits, OR if the plaintiff has previously 

been determined to be a vexatious litigant in a proceeding based on the same or a substantially 

similar set of facts or occurrences.  TEX. CIV. PRAC. REM. CODE § 11.054. 

 

As discussed above, Elijah W. Ratcliff does not allege or produce any evidence to establish 

a waiver of The State of Texas’ sovereign immunity, nor does Elijah W. Ratcliff establish his own 

standing to bring any cause of action against The State of Texas. 

Specifically, the Court FINDS as follows: 

(1) There IS NOT a reasonable probability that Elijah W. Ratcliff will prevail in his current 

litigation against The State of Texas. 

(2) In the past seven-year period, Elijah W. Ratcliff, has  “ commenced,  prosecuted, or 

maintained  at  least  five  litigations  as  a  pro  se  litigant  other  than  in  a  small  claims 

court that have been finally determined adversely to” Elijah W. Ratcliff. 

(3) After  a  litigation  has  been  finally  determined  against  Elijah  W.  Ratcliff,  Ratcliff 

repeatedly  relitigated  or  attempted  to  relitigate,  pro  se,  the  validity  of  the 

determination against The State of Texas, which was the same defendant as to whom 

the litigation was finally determined.   

(4) After  a  litigation  has  been  finally  determined  against  Elijah  W.  Ratcliff,  Ratcliff 

repeatedly  relitigated  or  attempted  to  relitigate,  pro  se,  the  cause  of  action,  claim, 

controversy, or any of the issues of fact or law determined or concluded by the final 

determination  against  the  same  defendant  as  to  whom  the  litigation  was  finally 

determined. 

 

5 

(5) Elijah  W.  Ratcliff has  a  previous  determination  that  he  is  a  vexatious  litigant  by  a 

federal  court  in  an  action  or  proceeding  based  on  the  same  or  substantially  similar 

facts, transition, or occurrence.   

(6) Elijah W. Ratcliff meets the criteria for finding a plaintiff a vexatious litigant. 

Accordingly, this Court ORDERS that Elijah W. Ratcliff is adjudicated to be a vexatious 

litigant. 

Because of this, the Court ORDERS that Elijah W. Ratcliff is prohibited from filing pro 

se  any  new  litigation  in  a  court  in  this  state,  under  the  name  “Elijah  W.  Ratcliff,”  “Elijah 

Ratcliff,” “Elijah W. Ratcliff, Agent” or any other name, without first being granted permission 

to file by the local administrative judge, pursuant to TEX. CIV. PRAC. REM. CODE § 11.101.  Such 

permission shall be granted only if the litigation appears to have merit and is not filed for purposes 

of harassment or delay; such permission may also be conditioned on the furnishing of a security.   

Elijah W. Ratcliff is hereby NOTIFIED that he is subject to punishment pursuant to the 

inherent powers of the court or by contempt if he fails to obey this pre-filing order.    

The Court further ORDERS that the Clerk of the Court is directed to notify the Office of 

Court Administration of this Court’s declaration of Elijah W. Ratcliff as a vexatious litigant and 

this prefiling order, pursuant to TEX. CIV. PRAC. REM. CODE § 11.103 (a).  The Office of Court 

Administration of the Texas Judicial System shall list Elijah W. Ratcliff a/k/a “Elijah W. Ratcliff, 

Agent” on the list of vexatious litigants subject to prefiling orders on the agency's Internet website.  

TEX. CIV. PRAC. REM. CODE § 11.103(b). 

Finally, the Court ORDERS that  proceedings in this matter are hereby stayed; that Elijah 

W. Ratcliff is ORDERED to provide security to Defendant the State of Texas by posting a bond 

with  this  Court  in  the  amount  of  $____________  to  cover  reasonable  expenses  incurred  in 

10,000.00

 

6 

connection with the litigation commenced by Elijah W. Ratcliff, including costs and attorney’s 

fees; that, if Elijah W. Ratcliff fails to post a $____________ bond within ten calendar days of the 

10,000.00

signing of this Order, then this suit will be dismissed with prejudice in its entirety, pursuant to 

TEX. CIV. PRAC. REM. CODE § 11.056.

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
