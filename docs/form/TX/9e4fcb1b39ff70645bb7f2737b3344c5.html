Section 72.030 of the 
Government Code 
requires the Office of 
Court Administration 
(OCA) to collect data 
relating to judicial 
turnover and the 
reasons for that 
turnover. The report 
must also include 
findings comparing the 
compensation of Texas’ 
state judges with 
compensation of judges 
at corresponding levels 
in the five states closest 
in population and to 
lawyers engaged in 
private practice. A 
report containing this 
information is to be 
released no later than 
December 1 of each 
even-numbered year. 
This report contains the 
information required by 
Section 72.030, 
updating the 
information presented 
in the last judicial 
turnover report issued 
in 2020. 

 

 

The most significant factors in judges’ decisions to leave were retirement and personal reasons. 
After reaching a 14-year high in 2016-2017, the percentage of judges retiring decreased slightly 
over the last 2 biennia. Most of these judges intended to continue working as a visiting judge. 

Judicial Compensation Continues to Lag Behind Other States 
While  the  new  compensation  structure  established  in  September  2019  increased  base  state 
salaries for judges with more than 4 years of relevant experience, the base salary for judges with 
0  to  4  years  of  experience  remained  unchanged  from  2013,  the  year  of  the  last  increase. 
Meanwhile, judges in all five of the other most populous states received increases, ranging from 
13 to 48 percent since 2013. Nationwide, salaries increased in almost every state, averaging 19 
to 20 percent.

ompensation for Judges Lags Behind Attorneys, Even with Much More 

Experience 
According to data collected by the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) for its Texas Wages and 
Employment Projections, the statewide average salary for an experienced lawyer in 2021 was 
$185,818, and the average salary for all lawyers was $150,350. TWC defines experienced workers 
as the wage earned by the upper two-thirds of all workers in the selected occupation.  

The  minimum  state  base  salary  for  district  judges  is  less  than  the  average  salary  for  lawyers 
statewide in 2021 and significantly less than the average salary for an experienced lawyer. Apart 
from the average salary of judges on the highest courts, all other judicial salaries fall below the 
average salary of an experienced lawyer.  

 

1 The Chief Justice and Presiding Judge receive an additional $2,500 to $3,000 in state compensation based on years of eligible 

judicial experience.

he involuntary turnover rate fell to 7 percent, as most judges were not up for reelection. The 
spike  in  involuntary  turnover  in  the  previous biennium  was  primarily  due  to  the  considerable 
number of judges who were defeated for reelection in 2018 but also the result of an unusually 
high number of judges reaching mandatory retirement age. (See Appendix B)

Salaries of Texas Lawyers 
Justices and judges for the Supreme Court, Court of Criminal Appeals, and Courts of Appeals are 
required  to  have  at  least  10  years  of  experience  as  lawyers.13  As  of  September  1,  2022,  the 
average length of time since licensure was 31 years for judges of the appellate courts.14 Eighty-
six percent of appellate judges had 20 or more years of experience, and 57 percent had 30 or 
more years. 

A constitutional amendment passed in 2021 increased the minimum years of experience for a 
district judge from four to eight years. The average length of time since licensure was 29 years 
for district judges. Seventy-nine percent of judges had 20 or more years of experience, and 42 
percent had 30 or more years.

According to data collected by the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) for its Texas Wages and 
Employment Projections, the statewide average salary for an experienced lawyer in 2021 was 
$185,818,  and  the  average  salary  for  all  lawyers  was  $150,350.15  TWC  defines  experienced 
workers as the wage earned by the upper two-thirds of all workers in the selected occupation.  

The  minimum  state  base  salary  for  district  judges  is  less  than  the  average  salary  for  lawyers 
statewide in 2021 and significantly less than the average salary for an experienced lawyer. Apart 
from the average salary of judges on the highest courts, all other judicial salaries fall below the 
average salary of an experienced lawyer.

Appendix A: Purpose and Methodology 
Purpose of Report 
To  provide  the  Legislature  with  information  to  facilitate  legislation  that  ensures  that  the 
compensation of state judges is adequate and appropriate, the 79th Texas Legislature charged 
the  Office  of  Court  Administration  (OCA)  with  collecting  information  relating  to  state  judicial 
turnover. Section 72.030 of the Texas Government Code requires OCA to: 

1) 

2) 

obtain data on the rate at which state judges resign from office or do not seek reelection, 
as well as the reason for these actions; and 

file a report containing this data for the preceding state fiscal biennium with the governor, 
lieutenant governor, speaker of the house of representatives, and presiding officers of 
the  standing  committees  of  each  house  of  the  Legislature  with  jurisdiction  over  the 
judiciary or appropriations. 

The report must also include the following findings: 

1)  whether  the  compensation  of  state  judges  exceeds,  is  equal  to,  or  is  less  than  the 
compensation of judges at corresponding levels in the five states closest in population to 
Texas; and  

2)  whether the compensation of state judges exceeds, is equal to, or is less than the average 

salary of lawyers engaged in the private practice of law. 

Methodology 
Data for general turnover in the state judiciary for the biennium were compiled from 

•  notices of resignation and notices of appointment from the Governor’s Office,  
•  election results from the Secretary of State’s website, 
•  surveys sent to departing judges, and 
•  news articles concerning the departure of judges. 

The  findings  on  reasons  for  voluntary  turnover  are  based  on  the  survey  responses  of  state 
appellate and district judges who left the state judiciary voluntarily during the period. Designed 
by OCA staff and reviewed and approved by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the survey 
instrument asked respondents to indicate: 

• 
to what extent certain factors influenced their decision to leave their current positions,  
•  whether certain factors would compel the individual to continue serving as a state judge, 

and  

•  what they did immediately after leaving office.

A-2 

urveys  were  sent  to  each  of  the  appellate  and  district 
judges who left the state judiciary voluntarily and did not 
resign  under  allegations  of  misconduct  during  the 
biennium.  Once  OCA  received  notification  about  a 
resignation,  a  survey  was  sent  to  the  judge  by  email. 
Follow-up  notifications,  along  with  another  copy  of  the 
questionnaire,  were  sent  to 
judges  who  had  not 
responded.

4. 

I have tremendously enjoyed my 20-year tenure as district judge. When I ran for office, I knew it 
was time to run. When I chose not to run for a 6th term, it was because I knew it was time to 
retire.                     
I have been a district judge for over 20 years. It has been a wonderful career.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
I was honored to serve for 31 years.  
I have thoroughly enjoyed my career as a Texas District Judge. The work is intellectually 
stimulating and very rewarding. I have daily opportunities to have a positive impact on 
individual lives and the community at-large. I am inspired by my judicial colleagues and the 
attorneys who practice in my court. My judicial career (20 years district judge) (10 years 
constitutional district judge) has been a true pleasure and a source of immense personal pride.      
5.  This is all premised in my case with continued good health, which I have. I would not do well just 
sitting and for hitting a golf ball (which I would like to have some more time for). I am not an 
accurate long gun hunter, but I appreciate those who are. I don't have patience for fishing. I 
have 8 blessings among nine, who are very special - my grandchildren.       
I loved my years of service (27+).

Working Conditions

I love being a judge and hope to have the opportunity to serve as a visiting judge. I am not 
retiring because I am burned out or sick of the job. In my view, there is just too much work to

is not the practice of law and do some visiting judge work. 

2.  Term of office should be 6 years.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
