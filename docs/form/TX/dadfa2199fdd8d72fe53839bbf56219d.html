On  April  15,  2019,  Petitioners  made  a  Rule  12  request  for  a  variety  of  records1  from 
Respondent regarding the Johnson County juvenile indigent defense plan, CPS court appointment 
plan, related attorney appointment lists and list maintenance, and related court appointments. On 
April 25, 2019, Respondent replied to Petitioners that it was providing them records it believed 
were responsive to 8 of the 16 categories of records requested. Respondent also stated it was not 
aware of records that fit the specific parameters of the remaining 8 records requests, and made no 
Rule 12 pronouncements related to any of the documents. Then, on October 18, 2019, Petitioners 
made a follow-up Rule 12 records request2 related to the removal of Petitioners from the juvenile 
indigent defense appointment list and for related attorney appointment data. Respondent replied 
on October 30, 2019 that it was providing Petitioners with certain documents in response to the 
request, but that it was not making any pronouncements as to whether the documents demonstrated 
“good  cause”  for  removal  from  the  appointment  lists  because  doing  so  would  “invade  the 
parameters” of Rule 12.5 exemptions related to judicial work product (Rule 12.5(a)) and internal 
deliberations (Rule 12.5(f)). Respondent  separately  asserted that documents  or records that fell 
under Rule 12.5(a) and Rule 12.5(f) were exempt from disclosure. Petitioners filed this appeal and 
requested expedited review. We did not grant Petitioners’ request for expedited review, and the 
special committee will not address Petitioners’ appeals requests that extend beyond the scope of 
the records requested from Respondent.3 

                                                           

1 In Petitioners’ April 15 letter, 10 of 16 the records requests sought records showing the specific date(s) Petitioners 
were removed from the juvenile indigent defense appointment list plus the judge(s) connected to, reason(s) for, and 
notice provided in connection with removal, as well as any date(s) the Petitioners were intentionally skipped from 
receiving appointments. The remaining requests related to the establishment and maintenance of the Johnson County 
Juvenile Indigent Defense Plan, CPS attorney appointment plan or rules, and related attorney appointment data.  

2 In Petitioners’ October 18 letters, two of Petitioners’ three requests sought documents that might show any “good 
cause”  reasons  to  substantiate  the  removal  of  Petitioners  from  the  juvenile  indigent  defense  appointment  list.  The 
remaining request related to attorney appointment data. 

3 The  special committee  will  not comment on the  nature  of the documents  submitted to it that extend beyond the 
records sought by Petitioners in their Rule 12 records requests. Rule 12 exists to provide public access to information 
in the judiciary, and does not require the special committee to opine on the validity of assertions posed by Petitioners. 
See Rule 12 Decision No. 19-016. 

Rule 12 Requested Records 

First, we must determine whether Rule 12 applies to the Petitioners’ request for records. 
The threshold issue in a Rule 12 appeal is whether the requested records are “judicial records,” 
which are defined by Rule 12.2(d) as follows:  

“Judicial record means a record made or maintained by or for a court or judicial 
agency  in  its  regular  course  of  business  but  not  pertaining  to  its  adjudicative 
function, regardless of whether that function relates to a specific case. A record of 
any nature created, produced, or filed in connection with any matter that is or has 
been before a court is not a judicial record.” (emphasis added) 

In  Rule  12  Decision  No.  16-005,  the  special  committee  considered  an  appeal  from  an 
attorney  who  was  removed  from  the  list  of  attorneys  eligible  for  appointment  under  the  Fair 
Defense Act Plan of the Harris County Criminal Courts at Law. Relying on the US Fifth Circuit’s 
2009  decision  in  Davis  v.  Tarrant  County,  Texas4  we  concluded  that  records  related  to  the 
maintenance of a list of attorneys who are eligible for appointment under a county’s Fair Defense 
Act plan are related to a judge’s “adjudicative function” and are not “judicial records” as defined 
by  Rule  12.2(d).  See  Rule  12  Decision  No.  16-005.  The  act  of  removing  an  attorney  from  a 
county’s Fair Defense appointment list is part of list maintenance and as such the act relates to a 
judge’s  adjudicative  function.  The  Petitioners’  requests  related  to  dates  the  Petitioners  were 
skipped over for appointments as well as to the judges connected to removal from the appointment 
list, the reasons for removal, and the notice connected to that removal are therefore related to a 
court’s adjudicative functions and are not judicial records.  

We next address Petitioners’ request for documents related to the local juvenile indigent 
defense plan and CPS attorney appointment plan or rules. As we observed in Rule 12 Decision 
No.  19-016,  a  court’s  local  rules  of  procedure  specifically  address  the  processing  of  cases  and 
therefore  relate  to  a  court’s  adjudicative  function.  Indigent  defense  plans  and  CPS  attorney 
appointment plans or rules fall under the umbrella of local rules of procedure, and thus are not 
judicial records. 

We lastly address Petitioners’ request related to court appointment data. Petitioners, in their 
April letter to Respondent, requested a copy of “all documents needed to show” the number of 
Johnson County juvenile indigent defendants appointed counsel on or after February 26, 2018 as 
well as the number of Spanish-speaking juvenile indigent defendants appointed counsel on or after 
February 26, 2018. In Respondent’s April reply, Respondent indicated it was providing Petitioners 
documents  it  believed  were  responsive  to  the  request  for  the  number  of  juvenile  indigent 
defendants appointed  counsel,  but  that it was  not  aware of records that  covered the number of 
Spanish-speaking  juvenile  indigent  defendants  appointed  counsel.  Petitioners  made  the  same 
requests again in October, and Respondent replied that it was not aware of the existence of any 
documents that pertained to the requests. A judicial officer is not required to create a document in 
response to a request (Rule 12 Decision No. 18-001), and Respondent is under no obligation to 

                                                           

4 565 F.3d 214, 226 (5th Cir. 2009). 

harvest its case files to create a document that would satisfy Petitioners’ requests.5 

Because the records at issue in this appeal are not judicial records under Rule 12, we can 
neither  grant  the  petition  in  whole  or  in  part,  nor  sustain  denial  to  the  requested  records.  And 
because the records at issue are not judicial records, we need not address Respondent’s exemption 
claims related to the records. 

Deficient Notice of Denial 

Finally, we briefly address Petitioners’ deficient notice of denial arguments. The primary 
significance  of  a  decision  finding  that  a  record  is  not  subject  to  Rule  12  is  that  the  Rule  12 
procedures for responding to a request and appealing the denial of a request do not apply. See Rule 
12 Decision No. 12-006. Because the records at issue in this appeal are not judicial records under 
Rule 12, Respondent  was not  obligated to  comply  with Rule 12 notice of denial  procedures in 
responding to Petitioners. 

In closing, and as has been stated in many previous Rule 12 decisions, although the records 
at issue are not “judicial records” does not mean they are completely exempt from disclosure. The 
records may be open pursuant to other laws, and neither the fact that a record is not subject to Rule 
12 nor a decision making this determination should be used as a basis for withholding records. 

 

                                                           
5 We note that there is a distinction between court appointment data found in court case files and appointment data 
reports  generated  from  those  files.  Court  appointment  data  found  in  juvenile  records  are  a  product  of  the  court’s 
appointment discretion in a given case, are clearly related to a court’s adjudicative function, are therefore not judicial 
records, and are not subject to Rule 12. However, some juvenile indigent defense appointment data must be reported 
to the Office of Court Administration by the clerks on a monthly basis. To the extent Respondent was maintaining a 
report of appointment data for administrative purposes or if Respondent had a copy of a court activity data report 
generated  by  the  clerk  that  covered  the  data  requested  by  Petitioners,  Respondent  would  need  to  produce  the 
information because the documents would relate to the court’s administrative function and be subject to Rule 12. See 
Rule 12 Decision No. 19-016 (maintenance of copy of local rules relate to judicial officer’s administrative function, 
not its adjudicative function).
