Section 1.  Members 

Article III—Membership 
 

The members of the State Bar are those persons designated by the Act. 

ection 2.  Enrollment in the State Bar 

Within  ten  days  of  being  admitted  to  practice  law  in  Texas,  a  member  must  file 

with the clerk the enrollment form prescribed by the State Bar and pay all required fees.  

ection 3.  Member Contact Information; Duty to Keep Updated  

Each  member  must  provide  to  the  State  Bar  and  keep  updated  any  contact 
information requested by the State Bar, including the member’s: 
•  registered mailing address; 
•  preferred email address; 
•  electronic service address; and 
• 

telephone number. 

If  a  member  fails  to  designate  an  electronic  service  address,  the  member’s 
preferred  email  address  will  be  deemed  to  be  the  member’s  electronic  service 
address. 

A member must update the member’s registered mailing address, preferred email 
address, and electronic service address on the State Bar website within 30 days of 
a change to any address.

notice  is  sent  to  the  member’s  registered  mailing  address  or  preferred  email 
address.   

Section 4.  Membership Fees

Section 6.  Default in Payment of Fees or Assessments 
 

If a member is in default of payment of membership fees or any assessment levied 
by the Court on the 30th day after the due date, the clerk will promptly notify the member 
of the default. If the fees and assessments are not paid within 60 days after the notice of 
default  is  mailed,  the  defaulting  member  will  automatically  be  suspended  from  the 
practice of law.  Practicing law while suspended is professional misconduct and grounds 
for  discipline. 

ection 7.  Resignation  from  Membership  Other  Than  in  Face  of  Pending 

Disciplinary Action  

A  member  may  resign  from  membership  by  delivering  to  the  State  Bar  the 
following materials, addressed to the clerk: 
• 
• 

the resignation form provided by the State Bar; 
the member’s bar card or, if the card has been lost, a written statement—either 
sworn to before a notary or made under penalty of perjury—that the card has 
been lost and will be returned to the State Bar if found; and 

•  a  certificate  by  the  chief  disciplinary  counsel  affirming  that  no  disciplinary 
action  is  pending  against  the  member  and  that  the  member  is  not  being 
investigated for professional misconduct. 

The  membership  records  will  be  amended  to  reflect  the  member’s  resignation 
when the State Bar receives and verifies the materials required by (A). 

ection 8.  Waiver of Membership Fees  

.  Waiver for Military Service in a Combat Zone 

The  executive  director  will  waive  or  refund  the  membership  fees  of  a 
member  of  the  United  States  Armed  Forces  for  any  year  in  which  the 
member  serves  in  a  combat  zone  designated  by  an  executive  order  of  the 
President of the United States. 

To request a waiver or refund under this subsection, a member must remit 
to  the  State  Bar  the  form  prescribed  by  the  State  Bar  and  all  required 
documentation  before  the  end  of  the  dues  year  in  which  the  member  is

The  legal  services  fee  mandated  by  Section  81.054(j),  Government  Code, 
may not be waived under this subsection. 
 
The executive director may waive some or all of the remaining membership 
fees of any member who demonstrates undue hardship. 
 
Undue  hardship  exists  when  a  member  is  unable  to  pay  membership  fees 
due  to  illness,  disability,  or  other  extraordinary  circumstances  beyond  the 
member’s control. 
 
To request a waiver under this subsection, a member must, by August 31 of 
each year in which a waiver is requested, remit to the State Bar: 
• 
•  a written statement by the member—either sworn to before a notary or 
made  under  penalty  of  perjury—averring  that  the  circumstances  on 
which  the  request  is  based  are  beyond  the  member’s  control  and  the 
direct cause of the member’s inability to pay membership fees; and 

the form provided by the State Bar; 

•  any other documentation required by the State Bar. 

Approval of a request for a waiver under this subsection is within the sole 
discretion of the executive director. 

the member has not previously obtained an expunction under this rule; 
 
the suspension was for 90 days or less; 

except for the suspension that is the subject of the expunction request, the 
member has not previously been suspended for nonpayment of membership 
fees; 

.  Within  30  days  after  a  waiver  is  granted  under  this  section,  the  State  Bar  will 

report the waiver to the clerk. 

ection 9.  One-Time  Expunction  of  an  Administrative  Suspension 

for 

Nonpayment of Membership Fees  

This  section  does  not  apply  to  a  disciplinary  suspension  for  professional 
misconduct. 
 
A member who meets the following criteria may request a one-time expunction of 
an administrative suspension for nonpayment of membership fees:

B.  Waiver for Undue Hardship 
 

the  member  is  not  currently  the  subject  of  a  disciplinary  proceeding  or 
investigation; and 

the  member  has  no  record  of  disciplinary  suspension—whether  active  or 
probated—or of prior disbarment or resignation in lieu of discipline. 

 
The member seeking the expunction must make a written request to the State Bar. 
After  verifying  that  the  member  meets  the  criteria  in  (B),  the  State  Bar  will 
forward  to  the  clerk  the  member’s  request  and  a  recommendation  that  the 
member’s  record  of  suspension  be  expunged.  The  clerk  will  expunge  the 
suspension from the member’s record. 
 
A  suspension  expunged  under  this  rule  is  deemed  never  to  have  occurred.  The 
record  of  an  expunction  is  confidential  and may  not  be  disclosed  by  the  clerk  or 
the State Bar.

Section 10.  Return to Former Status  

.  When a member who has been suspended for nonpayment of fees or assessments 
removes  the  default  by  payment  of  fees  or  assessments  then  owing  plus  an 
additional  amount  equivalent  to  one-half  the  delinquency,  the  suspension  will 
automatically be lifted and the member restored to former status. Return to former 
status  is  retroactive  to  the  inception  of  the  suspension,  but  does  not  affect  any 
proceeding for discipline of the member for professional misconduct. 

  

A person who has voluntarily resigned from membership must apply to the Board 
of Law Examiners and comply with the rules of the Court pertaining to admission 
to the practice of law before resuming the practice of law.  
 
An  inactive  member  may  return  to  active  status  upon  written  application  to  the 
clerk and payment of fees for the current year.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
