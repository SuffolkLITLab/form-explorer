Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 
 
Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 
 

APPEAL NO.: 

21-007s 

ESPONDENT: 

Office of Court Administration 

ATE: 

 

December 8, 2021 

 

 

 

PECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge Stephen B. Ables, Chairman; Judge Ray Wheless; Judge 
Olen Underwood; Judge Missy Medary; Judge Susan Brown 

Petitioner requested copies of certain documents and responses received by Respondent in 
response  to  a  request  for  offers  (RFO)  issued  by  Respondent.  Respondent  provided  Petitioner 
copies of the RFO responses submitted by the vendors, including an offer containing redactions 
from a specific vendor (“Vendor”). At the time Vendor submitted its offer under the RFO, Vendor 
identified  the  redacted  information  as  trade  secret  and  proprietary  information  that  should  be 
withheld in the event Respondent received a records request for the Vendor’s offer. Respondent 
informed Petitioner that certain information in Vendor’s RFO response would be withheld from 
disclosure  under  Rule  12.5(i)(3)  of  the  Rules  of  Judicial  Administration  as  “trade  secret  or 
commercial  or  financial  information  made  privileged  or  confidential  by  statute  or  judicial 
decision.” Petitioner filed an appeal requesting access to the redacted RFO information and Vendor 
was notified of the appeal. Vendor submitted a letter asserting that the redacted RFO information 
was  proprietary  trade  secret  and  commercial  information  that  should  not  be  released  by 
Respondent. Vendor also noted that in accordance with Texas Government Code Section 552.1101, 
“courts  must  preserve  the  secrecy  of  trade  secrets  and  all  other  ‘commercial  or  financial 
information for which it is demonstrated based on specific factual evidence that disclosure would 
cause substantial competitive harm to the person from whom the information was obtained.’”  

espondent provided the special committee a copy of the offer without pricing information 
and the committee, in Rule 12 Decision No. 21-007, concluded that the offer information Vendor 
wished  to  withhold  was  exempt  from  disclosure  under  Rule  12.5(i)(3)  because  it  related  to 
Vendor’s trade secrets. The special committee also requested for its review the line-item pricing 
and hourly rates information Vendor believes are exempt from disclosure. In response, Respondent 
provided  a  copy  of  the  proposal  submitted  by  Vendor  in  response  to  the  RFO  with  the  pricing 
information.  

  
Rule 12.5(i)(3) exempts from disclosure any judicial record that is confidential or exempt 
from disclosure under a state or federal constitutional provision, statute, or common law, including 

 

1 Vendor cited Section 552.110 of the Business and Commerce Code, but the quoted language is from Section 552.110 
of the Government Code. Chapter 552 of the Government Code, commonly referred to as the Public Information Act, 
governs  the  public’s  right  of  access  to  records  of  public  entities  in  the  executive  and  legislative  branches  of 
government.

information that relates to a trade secret or commercial or financial information made privileged 
or confidential by statute or judicial decision. A “trade secret” is “any formula, pattern, device or 
compilation of information which is used in one’s business and presents an opportunity to obtain 
an advantage over competitors who do not know it or use it.” In re Bass, 113 S.W.3d 735, 739 
(Tex. 2003) (citing Restatement of Torts § 757 cmt. b (1939)). Trade secret analysis involves the 
weighing of six nonexclusive factors2, not all of which need to be satisfied to find a trade secret 
exists; other circumstances can be relevant to trade secret analysis. 113 S.W.3d at 740. Moreover, 
“[i]t is self-evident that the subject matter of a trade secret must be secret.” Luccous v. J.C. Kinley 
Co., 376 S.W.2d 336, 338 (Tex. 1964); Restatement of Torts § 757 cmt. b. Some Texas courts 
have  deemed  pricing  and  rate information  a  trade  secret  in  certain  circumstances3  while  others 
have  not4,  and  a  trade  secret  is  generally  something  continuously  used  in  the  operation  of  the 
business. Hyde Corp. v.  Huffines, 314 S.W.2d 763, 776 (Tex. 1958); Restatement of Torts § 757 
cmt. b. (“[A trade secret] differs from other secret information in a business . . . in that it is not 
simply information as to single or ephemeral events in the conduct of the business, as, for example, 
the amount or other terms of a secret bid for a contract[.]”). Finally, we note that parallel Open 
Records  Letter  Rulings  issued  by  the  Attorney  General  suggest  that,  as  a  matter  of  policy,  the 
public has a strong interest in pricing information in government contracts.5  
 

The proposal submitted for our review includes recurring quarterly/annual charges, pricing  
assumptions, and an hourly rate for change orders. Our trade secret analysis of this information 
leads us to conclude that neither the quarterly/annual charges nor the hourly rate for change orders 
rise to the level of “trade secret.” The recurring charges cannot reasonably be said to be “secret,” 
as  the  current  value  of  Respondent’s  contracts  can  be  quickly  located  by  the  public  on  the 
Legislative  Budget  Board’s  contract  database  website.  Recurring  charge  amounts,  annually  or 
quarterly, can be easily deduced from this information. And the hourly rate figure for change orders 
found in the proposal, considered in context of the overall contract, appears to relate to a “single 
or ephemeral event[] in the conduct of the business” rather than a “formula, pattern, device, or 
compilation of information” that presents an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors. 
We also note that there is a strong public interest in pricing information found in Respondent’s 
contracts. Accordingly, this information is not exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5(i)(3). As 
for Vendor’s pricing assumptions, we agree that some information present in this section of the 
proposal rises to the level of a “trade secret” as it sheds light on how the Vendor developed the 

 

2 These factors include: (1) the extent to which the information is known outside the business, (2) the extent to which 
it is known by employees and others involved in the business, (3) the extent of measures taken to guard the secrecy of 
the information, (4) the value of the information to the business and its competitors, (5) the amount of effort or money 
expended in developing the information, and (6) the ease or difficulty with which the information could be properly 
acquired or duplicated by others. In re Union Pac. R.R., Co., 294 S.W.3d 589 (Tex. 2009) (citing In re Bass, 113 
S.W.3d at 739).  
3 See, e.g., Waste Management of Texas v. Abbott, 406 S.W.3d 626, 635-38 (Tex. App. Eastland 2013) rev. denied 
(June 19, 2015) (holding pricing and volume information in waste tickets qualified as a trade secret); Bertotti v. C.E. 
Shepherd  Co.,  752  S.W.2d  648,  653-54  (Tex.  App.  –  Houston  [14th  Dist.]  1988,  no  writ.)  (upholding  temporary 
injunction  to  enforce  non-compete  covenant  because  company  had  legitimate  interest  in  protecting  product 
information, including price information).  
4 General Insulation Co. v. King, No. 14-08-00633-CV, 2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 490, 2010 WL 307952, *4 (Tex. App. 
– Houston [14th Dist.] Jan. 26, 2010, no pet.) (concluding summary-judgment proof established that customer-specific 
pricing did not rise to level of a trade secret). 
5 See, e.g., Open Records Letter Ruling Nos. 2012-10618, 2011-17965, and 2009-04170. 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

fees listed in its response to the RFO. This pricing information makes it similar to that found in 
cases  where  courts  found  pricing  and  volume  information  qualified  as  a  trade  secret.6  For  this 
reason, we conclude that the pricing assumption information is exempt from disclosure.  
 

We  next  consider  Vendor’s  assertion  that  courts  must,  in  accordance  with  the  Public 
Information  Act  (PIA)  provision  found  in  Government  Code  Section  552.110,  “preserve  the 
secrecy  of  trade  secrets  and  all  other  ‘commercial  or  financial  information  for  which  it  is 
demonstrated  based  on  specific  factual  evidence  that  disclosure  would  cause  substantial 
competitive harm to the person from whom the information was obtained.’” However, Respondent 
is a judicial agency that is subject to Rule 12 of the Rules of Judicial Administration, not to the 
PIA, and Rule 12 does not include a similar exemption.7  
 

For the reasons stated above, we conclude that Vendor’s recurring quarterly/annual charge 
and hourly rate for change order pricing information is not exempt under Rule 12.5(i)(3), and that 
information should be released. Conversely, we find that the pricing assumption information does 
rise to the level of a trade secret and is exempt from disclosure. 

 

6 See Waste Management v. Abbott, 406 S.W.3d at 635-38.  
7 We note that even if Rule 12 did include a similar provision, Vendor has failed to demonstrate based on specific 
factual evidence that disclosure would cause substantial competitive harm to Vendor.
