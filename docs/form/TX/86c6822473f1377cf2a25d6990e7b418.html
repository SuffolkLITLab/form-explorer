Attachment- any unique supporting document including exhibits and proposed orders that 
are not defined in Rule 21  (a) of the Texas Rules of Civil  Procedure. 
Digital Media- any files  stored in an electronic format. This can include (but is  not limited to) 
text, audio and video files. 
Document- a pleading, plea, motion, application, request, exhibit, brief, memorandum of law, 
or other instrument in electronic form. 
DPI - Dots per inch 
Lead Document- a document as defined by Rule 21  (a) of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. 
If filing a single document, it is the lead document. 
NARA  -National Archives and Records Administration 
NIEM- National Information Exchange Model- a partnership of the U.S.  Department of 
Justice, the U.S.  Department of Homeland Security, and the U.S.  Department of Health and 
Human Services designed to develop, disseminate and support enterprise-wide information 
exchange standards and processes that can enable jurisdictions to effectively share critical 
information in emergency situations, as well as support the day-to-day operations of agencies 
throughout the nation. NIEM was adopted formally by JCIT and is promulgated in data 
exchanges in Texas Administrative Code, Title 1, Part 8, Chapter 177. 
Electronic Court Filing (ECF)  standards- a set of non-proprietary extensible markup 
language (XML)  and Web services specifications, along with clarifying explanations and 
amendments to those specifications that have been added for the purpose of promoting 
interoperability among electronic court filing vendors and systems. 
OCA- Office of Court Administration 
OCR- Optical Character Recognition

PDF- Portable Document Format- for the purpose of these standards this is PDF 1.4 (ISO 
19005-1:2005- Revised as ISP /NP 19005-1). This standard specifies how to use PDF for 
long-term preservation of electronic documents and is applicable to documents containing 
combinations of character, raster and vector data. 
PDF Distiller- a program or application that converts files  into PDF files so that the printed 
appearance of a document is preserved regardless of the application used to create it. This 
functionality is commonly seen as "Print to PDF", "Save to PDF"  or "Export to PDF". 
PDF Software- software that conforms to International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO)  32000-1:2008. This standard specifies standards for creating (writing), reading, 
displaying and interacting with PDF documents.

2  SYSTEM  DATA EXCHANGE  STANDARDS 
In accordance with Texas Administrative Code, Title 1, Part 8,  Chapter 177, Information exchanges 
that occur between the various systems (electronic filing manager, case management, document 
management, etc.) should occur using the current OASIS  LegalXML specifications. The OASIS 
LegalXML specification is a subset to NIEM. 

3  DIGITAL  MEDIA STANDARDS 
In addition to content and formatting promulgated by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Texas 
Code of Criminal Procedure, and Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, the following standards apply 
to digital media filed  electronically or scanned from source records (filed after the effective date of 
these standards) by the clerk 

3.1  DOCUMENTS 

A.  An e-filed document must be in text-searchable PDF, using fonts specified in the PDF 

specification, on 8.5x11 page size, with the content appropriately rotated. 

B.  When possible, the document should be generated directly from the originating software 

using a PDF distiller. 

Judicial Committee on Information Technology 

Page 3 of 17 

Technology Standards v2.0 

C.  Prior to being filed electronically, a scanned document must have a resolution of 300 DPI. 

Preferably, scanned documents should be made searchable using OCR technology. 

D.  An  e-filed document may not contain any security or feature restrictions including 

password protection or encryption and may not contain embedded multi-media video, 
audio, or programming. 

E.  Documents may not contain package PDF's.  PDF's should not be embedded inside of 

another PDF.  Documents may not contain embedded fonts. Each Document must be a single 
PDF.  An appellate court may require that multiple PDF documents be combined into a 
single PDF document and bookmarks used to separate content appropriately. The content 
of the document should not depend on bookmarks. 

F.  Any e-filed document filename should contain only alphanumeric characters that are part of 
the Latinl_General character set. No special characters are allowed and the length of the 
filename should be restricted to SO  characters. 

3.2  AUDIO/VIDEO 

A  When an audio/video file is natively supported by at least one media player listed in these 

standards, the file  must not be converted into another format. 

B. 

If modifications are needed to enhance the native audio /video, a copy of the original must 
be made. The modified copy (submitted in addition to the original audio/video) must also 
be generated in a format supported by at least one media player listed in these standards. 

C.  The following media players are supported (specific audio/video formats can be found on 

each media player's website): 

a.QuickTime (Apple) 
b.VLC  media player (VideoLAN  Organization) 
c. Windows media player (Microsoft) 

4  EFILING  FILING  CONFIGURATIONS 
Below are the standard filing configurations to be used in the eFiling system for district, county 
court at law, probate, and county courts. This list of filing configurations must be accepted in each 
court. Courts and clerks may not add to this configuration, but may eliminate codes if not needed in 
a particular jurisdiction. 

It is important to note that these standards only apply to the electronic filing system which is a 
delivery system and are NOT standards for a county case management or document management 
system.

clerks may designate the type of writ and have multiple "Service-Sheriff-Writ" services available. 
3  In some counties, clerks use additional services to route money to the appropriate general ledger accounts. 
In these cases, clerks can use "Z-(County Use Only)- Service- Constable" additional services to route to the 
appropriate account. In these cases, the services listed should be associated with an existing "Service -
Constable" type of additional service that the filer would normally use.
