Instructions and Information Regarding Reconsideration of a 
Defendant’s Ability to Pay and the Standardized Form to 
Request Reconsideration  

If at any time while you are on community supervision your 
ability to pay any fine, fee, program cost, or other payment 
ordered by the court, other than restitution, changes and 
you  cannot afford  to  pay,  you  have the  right  to  request 
that the court review your payments and consider changing 
or waiving your payments. You can use this form to make 
a request for a change in your payments. You cannot use 
this form to request a change in restitution payments. 

bility to Pay 

If  the  court  places  a  defendant  on  community  supervision,  including  deferred 
adjudication community supervision, the law requires the court to consider the 
defendant’s ability to pay before ordering the defendant to make any payment, 
excluding restitution.  
(See Code of Criminal Procedure Art. 42A.655(a) and (c)) 

hat is Community Supervision? 

"Community supervision" includes probation and deferred adjudication community 
supervision. 
(See Code of Criminal Procedure Art. 42A.001(1)) 

econsideration of Defendant’s Ability to Pay 

A  defendant’s  ability  to  pay  may  change  during  the  period  of  community 
supervision. House Bill No. 385, an enactment of the 87th Legislature, requires the 
Office of Court Administration of the Texas Judicial System (OCA) to adopt not 
later  than  January  1,  2022  a  standardized  form  that  a  defendant  can  use  to 
request reconsideration of the defendant’s ability to pay if his or her  financial 
circumstances change. The included form will allow a defendant to request  

econsideration  of  his  or  her  ability  to  pay.  A defendant may not request 
reconsideration of his or her ability to pay restitution.  
(See Code of Criminal Procedure Art. 42A.655(h))

hen and How Can a Defendant Request Reconsideration? 

The  defendant  may  request  reconsideration  any  time  during  the  period  of 
community supervision by completing and filing OCA’s standardized form with the 
clerk of the court. 
(See Code of Criminal Procedure Art. 42A.655(e)) 

re  There  Any  Limits  on  How  Many  Times  the  Defendant  Can  Request 

Reconsideration? 
Yes  
The defendant can make only 1 request within a 6-month period, unless there is 
a substantial and compelling reason for making an additional request during that 
time period.  
(See Code of Criminal Procedure Art. 42A.655(e)) 

an the Court Reconsider The Payment of Restitution? 

The court does not have to consider or reconsider a defendant’s ability to pay 
restitution.  
(See Code of Criminal Procedure Art. 42A.655(c)) 

hat is the Supervision Officer Obligated to Do? 

On defendant’s request, a supervision officer must promptly provide the defendant 
with a copy of OCA’s standardized form. We recommend providing a copy of the 
instructions, too. 
(See Code of Criminal Procedure Art. 42A.655(i))  

hat is the Court Obligated to Do? 

On the defendant’s request, the court must promptly provide the defendant with 
a  copy  of  OCA’s  standardized  form.  We  recommend  providing  a  copy  of  the 
instructions, too. 
(See Code of Criminal Procedure Art. 42A.655(i)) 

t any hearing for an alleged violation of a condition of community supervision, 

the court must reconsider the defendant’s ability to make payments. 
(See Code of Criminal Procedure Art. 42A.655(d)) 

n  receiving  a  proper  request  for  reconsideration,  the  court  must  determine 
whether the defendant’s financial status or ability to make required payments has 
changed so much so that the defendant’s ability to make a payment has been  
substantially hindered. If the court finds there is substantial hinderance, the court

must  then  determine  whether  all  or  part  of  the  required  payments  should  be 
satisfied by an alternative method. 
(See Code of Criminal Procedure Art. 42A.655(e)) 

hat Payments Shall the Court Reconsider? 

The  court  can  reconsider  any  fee,  fine,  reimbursement  cost,  court  cost, 
rehabilitation cost, program cost, service cost, counseling cost, ignition interlock 
cost,  assessment  cost,  testing  cost,  education  cost,  treatment  cost,  payment 
required under Article 42A.652 (Monthly Reimbursement Fee), or other payment 
or cost authorized or required as a condition of community supervision. 
(See Code of Criminal Procedure Art. 42A.655(b), (e)) 

hat Alternative Methods are Available to the Court? 

The court may require payments to be made at a later date or in a specified 
portion  at  designated  times  (e.g., defer any payment or payments for several 
months, order payment of a reduced amount per month, order bimonthly 
payments, or impose a payment plan), waive all or part of payments in total or 
for a specified period of time then reevaluate (e.g., 1 month, 3 months, 6 months), 
require the completion of community service instead of payments, if applicable, 
or require any combination of the aforementioned methods.   
(See Code of Criminal Procedure Art. 42A.655(f)) 

re There Any Filing Fees on Filing the Request? 

No  
Criminal  filing  fees  are  assessed  on  “conviction”  only.  The  request  for 
reconsideration does not result in a conviction, adjudication, or a finding of guilt. 
The clerk should not assess filing fees on the filing of OCA’s standardized form. 

oes the Court Have to Hold a Hearing? 

No 
The  court  does  not  have  to  hold  a  hearing,  but  the  court  must  notify  the 
defendant  and  the  attorney  representing  the  state  of  the  court’s  decision  and 
whether the court will allow an alternative method of payment.

What Happens if the Defendant’s Financial Status or Ability to Pay Improves 
During the Period of Community Supervision? 
The court may order the defendant to pay all or part of any payment waived if 
the court later determines that the defendant has the financial means or resources 
to make the payment. The court must provide notice and an opportunity for the 
defendant to be heard before ordering the payment of any amount waived.

community  supervision  officer  to  verify  your  information  or  provide  some 
input.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
