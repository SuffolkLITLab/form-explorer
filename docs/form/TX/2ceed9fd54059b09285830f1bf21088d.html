"The task of a writer is not to solve the 
problem but to correctly pose the 
question." 

--Anton Chekhov

Overloaded 
Issue
Statement

(in a PDR the CCA 
granted)

The court of appeals misapplied the standard for 
reviewing relevance determinations where its 
analysis for determining whether the trial court 
abused its discretion in excluding relevant 
evidence looked to whether, based on the trial 
court's personal evaluation of competing or 
available inferences, it is reasonable to reject the 
State's proffered inferences, when the proper 
standard looks to whether an appellate court 
can state with confidence that by no reasonable 
perception of common experience could it be 
determined that the proffered inference is one 
that is reasonably available from the evidence.

Rewrite

In affirming the trial court's decision to exclude 
evidence as irrelevant, did the court of appeals 
wrongly disregard the State's relevance theory 
because the trial court did not believe it, even 
though a rational factfinder could have?

Think 
280

“Whether the Fourteenth Court of 
Appeals improperly acted as a 
‘thirteenth juror’ by re-evaluating 
the weight and credibility of the 
evidence showing that the 
complainant’s gunshot wounds 
constituted serious bodily injury?”

Has a woman sustained 
"serious bodily injury" 
when she is shot 
through her breast and 
her thigh?

Revising your issue statement

Will discovery of an arrest 
warrant necessarily 
render an attempted 
seizure on the warrant 
"lawful" (despite an 
earlier illegality) for 
purposes of evading 
arrest?

Day, 614 SW3d 121

Revising: What to Look For

• Irrelevant law
• Repetitive & 
implied concepts

• Wordiness

"Deep Issue"

1) Major Premise—

Principle of Law

2) Minor Premise—

Facts of the Case

3) Question

(conclusion)

Derichsweiler --Defense Framing

Major—An officer must have reasonable suspicion 
that crime is afoot to stop a motorist.

Minor —Defendant was merely grinning at 
others in two parking lots.

Question—Could the officer legally stop the Defendant?

7/29/20XX

--State’s Framing

Major—Reasonable suspicion requires no completed 
crime; imminency of crime is enough.

Minor —Defendant circled the parking lot to 

repeatedly block in and suss out drive-thru 
patrons in multiple locations.

Question—Was the stop justified by the officer’s reasonable 
belief that some crime was imminent?

7/29/20XX

Jeffrey Fisher, Hemphill v. NY

Introducing evidence at trial is often deemed 
to "open the door" to the admission of 
responsive evidence that would otherwise be 
barred by the rules of evidence.

QUESTION PRESENTED: Does a criminal 
defendant who opens the door to responsive 
evidence forfeit his right to exclude evidence 
otherwise barred by the Confrontation Clause?

Is Your Issue “Deep” Enough?

Question—Are anticipatory search warrants 

prohibited under Texas law?     

Parker, PD-0388-21

Major Premise / Controlling Principle?

7/29/20XX

STATE

DEFENSE

Parts of the Texas warrant statute 
expressly require probable cause 
that the items sought "are" (rather 
than "will be") at the place to be 
searched. But not the part that 
applies to warrants for contraband. 

This anticipatory search warrant 
was for contraband.

It is thus permissible.

This Court has construed Art. 
18.01(b)'s "probable cause...for [a 
warrant's] issuance" language 
to require that the object be at the 
search location "at the time of its 
issuance." It’s the basis for staleness.

Anticipatory search warrants cannot 
satisfy this requirement.

Ergo, they are illegal.

Gladys could be characterized as a hostile State’s 
witness. The State does not rely on Gladys’ initial 
direct testimony elicited by the State about Chance 
lying and being coached as a basis for Hicks’ rebuttal 
testimony. 3 RR 121. The defense elicited its own 
credibility testimony because it helped its 
case. Appellant cannot now complain about the 
defense-elicited admission being a predicate because 
he brought it out on cross-examination for his benefit, 
and it was not necessary responsive evidence or 
offered to rebut to the State’s initial evidence. Cf. 
Prystash v. State, 3 S.W.3d 522, 531 (Tex. Crim. App. 
1999) (a party can be estopped from complaining 
about unauthorized jury-charge submission that he 
procured); Hammons v. State, 239 S.W.3d 798, 806 
(Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (“the fact that the State might 
‘bring out its own uglies’ on direct examination in 
anticipation of an attack on a witness’s credibility 
does not preclude the introduction of a witness’s prior 
consistent statement as rebuttal evidence after a 
witness has, in fact, been impeached on cross-
examination with an express or implied accusation of 
recent fabrication.”); Daggett v. State, 187 S.W.3d 444, 
454 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005) (“if extraneous offense 
evidence is improperly introduced during the State’s 
case-in-chief, any error may be cured by the 
defendant’s subsequent testimony which ‘opens the 
door’ to rebuttal.”).

wordy phrases:

The issue here is whether the defendant 
was entitled to an instruction on self-
defense.

The issue here is entitlement.

• Show your thought process.

• But don't displace research, if 

possible.
• Find analogous principles.

Think in Terms of 
Systems and 
Consequences

Do county courts have 
concurrent jurisdiction 
with district courts over 
official misconduct 
cases?

Will litigants appear 
before a non-lawyer 
statutory county 
court judge?

Will the number of 
jurors differ?

Will the practice and 
procedures differ?

Will admonishments 
for a guilty or nolo 
plea differ?

Does the type of 
prosecutor matter?

Will the ability to 
remove an officer be 
restricted when a 
case is tried in 
county court?
