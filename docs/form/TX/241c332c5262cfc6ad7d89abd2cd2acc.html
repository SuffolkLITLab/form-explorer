ARTICLE IV 
ADMINISTRATION 

ection 7.   Nominees for Office of Elected Director 

.   An active  member’s name  may  be placed in  nomination for the office of elected 
director  by  a  written  petition  in  form  prescribed  by  the  board  and  signed  by  the 
lesser of five percent (5%) of the active members whose principal place of practice 
is within the district to be represented by  the nominee if elected, or one hundred 
(100)  of  such  members,  which  petition  must  be  received  in  the  office  of  the 
executive  director  on  or  before  March  1  of  the  year  of  the  election.  A  petition 
signature  is  invalid  if  it  is  not  dated  or  the  signer  signed  the  petition  before 
September 1 of the year before the election. The executive director shall promptly 
review the petition to  verify the eligibility of the nominee. If from  the petition it 
appears the nominee is eligible, that person’s name shall be listed upon the ballot. 
If from the petition the executive director finds the nominee to be ineligible, that 
fact shall immediately be communicated to the nominee. Any nominee desiring to 
appeal  the  findings  of  the  executive  director  shall  forthwith  promptly  notify  the 
executive director, who shall forthwith promptly convene the executive committee 
to hear and determine the matter. The executive committee shall have final authority 
to  determine  questions  of  eligibility  of  the  nominee  and  the  validity  of  the 
nominating  petition  and  shall  do  so  within  ten  (10)  days  of  the  notice  to  the 
executive director. 

The petitions may be in counterparts, and it shall be sufficient that the signatures on 
all the counterparts aggregate the required number of signatures. 

If no valid petition nominating an eligible person shall have been received by the 
executive director by March 1 in respect to a district in the year in which such district 
is to elect a director, or if all persons who have been nominated in the foregoing 
manner shall have died or become disqualified from serving at any time prior to the 
printing of the ballot in such election, then the president of the State Bar with the 
advice of the person then serving as elected director from that district shall name a 
qualified person to stand for election as director from that district. 

If an elected director fails to qualify, such position shall be deemed vacant.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
