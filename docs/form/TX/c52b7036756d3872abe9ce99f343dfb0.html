II.  DECIDED CASES  

 

 Enforcement 
a)  Whole  Woman’s  Health  v. 
Jackson,  642  S.W.3d  569 
(Tex.  Mar.  11,  2022)  [22-
0033] 

This  case  answered  a  certified 
question from the United States Court 
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit asking 
whether  Texas  law  authorizes  certain 
state  officials  to  directly  or  indirectly 
enforce  the  state’s  abortion-restriction 
requirements.  

The  Texas  Legislature  passed 
Senate Bill 8 (labeled the “Texas Heart-
beat Act”) in 2021. Section 3 of the Act 
added  a  new  subchapter  H  to  chapter 
171  of  the  Texas  Health  and  Safety 
Code, which prohibits physicians from 
knowingly 
“in-
“perform[ing]” 
duc[ing]”  an  abortion  unless  they  first 
perform  an  “appropriate”  test  and  do 
not  detect  a  “fetal  heartbeat.”  The 
plaintiffs  provide  and  fund  abortions 
and support women who obtain them in 
Texas.  They  filed  suit  in  federal  court 
requesting  a  declaration  that  the  Act 

or 

1 
 

unconstitutionally restricts their rights 
and  an  injunction  prohibiting  the  de-
fendants  from  enforcing  its  require-
ments. The defendants include the ex-
ecutive directors and commissioners of 
various state agencies.  

challenges, 

These  state-agency  executives 
moved to dismiss the lawsuit, asserting 
jurisdictional 
including 
that  they  are  immune  from  the  plain-
tiffs’  federal  suit  because  Texas  law 
does  not  grant  them  any  authority  to 
enforce  the  Act’s  requirements.  The 
federal district court disagreed and de-
nied  their  dismissal  motions.  The 
United States Supreme Court also dis-
agreed, affirmed the denial of the state-
agency  executives’  dismissal  motions, 
and remanded the case to the Fifth Cir-
cuit. At the state-agency executives’ re-
quest,  the  Fifth  Circuit  then  certified 
the following question to the Court:   
Whether  Texas  law  authorizes 
the  Attorney  General, 
[the] 
Texas Medical Board, the Texas 
Board  of  Nursing,  the  Texas 
Board of Pharmacy, or the Texas 
Health  and  Human  Services 
Commission,  directly  or  indi-
rectly, to take disciplinary or ad-
verse  action  of  any  sort  against 
individuals  or  entities  that  vio-
late  the  Texas  Heartbeat  Act, 
given the enforcement authority 
granted by various provisions of 
the Texas Occupations Code, the 
Texas Administrative Code, and 
the  Texas  Health  and  Safety 
Code  and  given  the  restrictions 
on  public  enforcement  in  sec-
tions  171.005,  171.207,  and 
171.208(a)  of  the  Texas  Health 
and Safety Code. 

The Court concluded that Texas 
 
law does not authorize the state-agency 
executives to enforce the Act’s require-
ments,  either  directly  or  indirectly. 
First,  it  determined  that  the  statute’s 
language unambiguously confirms that 
the  state-agency  executives  cannot  di-
rectly  bring  a  civil  action  under  that 
section  to  enforce  the  Act’s  require-
ments.  The  statute  unequivocally  pro-
vides  that  the  Act’s  testing  and  no-
heartbeat  requirements  may  be  en-
forced  by  a  private  civil  action  under 
section 171.208, and that no state offi-
cial may bring or participate as a party 
in any such action.  
 
The  Court  then  concluded  that 
the state-agency executives also cannot 
indirectly  enforce  the  Act’s  require-
ments  through  “administrative  and 
public 
enforcement  actions” 
against  Texas  physicians,  nurses, 
pharmacists, and other professional li-
censees.  Those  laws  grant  the  state 
agencies  broad  authority  to  enforce 
other  state  laws  through  the  profes-
sional-disciplinary process unless other 
laws provide otherwise, and the Heart-
beat Act expressly provides otherwise. 
The  Court  reached  this  conclusion  for 
three  reasons.  First  is  the  Act’s  em-
phatic,  unambiguous,  and  repeated 
provisions  declaring  that  the  civil  ac-
tion section 171.208 provides is the “ex-
clusive” method for enforcing the Act’s 
requirements.  

civil 

Next,  the  Court  considered  the 
savings  clause  in  section  171.207(b), 
which  states  that  section  171.207(a) 
“may not be construed to . . . limit the 
enforceability  of  any  other  laws  that 
regulate  or  prohibit  abortion.”  The 
plaintiffs contended that the laws that 
authorize agencies to take disciplinary 

2 
 

actions  against  licensees  who  perform 
“criminal abortions” are laws that “reg-
ulate  or  prohibit  abortion.”  The  Court 
disagreed,  reasoning  that  laws  that 
“regulate or prohibit abortion” must do 
more than relate to or have an impact 
on abortions but must be specifically di-
rected at abortions and must substan-
tively  control,  forbid, preclude,  or  hin-
der them.  

Finally,  the  Court  considered 
the  plaintiff’s  argument  regarding  the 
Act’s statement that “[n]o enforcement 
of this subchapter, and no enforcement 
of Chapters 19 and 22, Penal Code, in 
response to violations of this subchap-
ter, may be taken or threatened by” any 
government  actor.  The  plaintiffs  ar-
gued  that  to  read  the  Act  as  broadly 
prohibiting all indirect enforcement ac-
tions  would  render  this  clause  mere 
surplusage. The Court first stated that 
the clause is not surplusage because it 
confirms that although the Act is a civil 
statute,  prosecutors  cannot  pursue 
criminal charges based on an abortion 
that  violates  the  Act’s  requirements. 
But even if the clause were surplusage, 
such a redundancy would not alter the 
clear  terms  of  the  exclusive-enforce-
ment provisions. The clause cannot be 
given  the  full  effect  the  plaintiffs  pro-
pose without rendering other language 
in  the  Act  superfluous.  The  Court  de-
termined that to stay truest to all of the 
Act’s  language,  it  must  conclude  that 
the legislature included the clause not 
to  prohibit  indirect  enforcement  that 
would be permitted in the clause’s ab-
sence but to emphasize and make it un-
mistakably clear that by prohibiting all 
enforcement methods other than a sec-
tion 171.208 civil action, even criminal 
therefore 
prosecutions.  The  Court 

answered  the  Fifth  Circuit’s  certified 
question No. 
 
 Judicial Review 
a)  Tex.  Comm’n  on  Env’t  Qual-
ity  v.  Maverick  County,  642 
S.W.3d  537  (Tex.  Feb.  8, 
2022) [19-1108] 

 
The Texas Commission on Envi-
ronmental  Quality  (TCEQ)  granted 
Dos  Repúblicas  Coal  Partnership 
(DRCP)  a  permit 
to  discharge 
wastewater from its surface mining op-
erations.  Several  local  governments, 
environmental groups, and landowners 
(collectively,  the  Permit  Contestants) 
challenged  the  permit.  The  central  is-
sue in this case was whether DRCP is 
the  mine’s  “operator”  and  thus  the 
proper permit applicant.   
DRCP owns a coal mine in Mav-
 
erick  County.  It  hired  a  contractor  to 
run  the  day-to-day  operations  at  the 
mine.  DRCP  needed  a  permit  to  dis-
charge  wastewater  from  the  mine. 
TCEQ  regulations  require  the  mine’s 
owner  and  operator  to  apply  for  the 
permit  (unless  they  are  the  same  en-
tity).  The  rules  further  define  “opera-
tor” as “[t]he person responsible for the 
overall  operation  of  a  facility.”  Permit 
Contestants  challenged  the  applica-
tion, so TCEQ referred the application 
to  the  State  Office  of  Administrative 
Hearings. The assigned Administrative 
Law Judges held a contested case hear-
ing, after which they issued a Proposal 
for  Decision  finding  that  DRCP  is  the 
mine’s  operator  and  recommending 
that  TCEQ  approve  DRCP’s  applica-
tion with additional environmental re-
quirements.  TCEQ  accordingly  ap-
proved the permit but modified the pro-

Permit Contestants challenged the per-
mit  in  district  court,  arguing  that 
DRCP was not the mine’s operator and 
that the TCEQ erred on other technical 
issues.  The  district  court  reversed 
TCEQ’s  finding  that  DRCP  was  the 
mine’s  operator  but  affirmed  TCEQ’s 
modifications. The court of appeals af-
firmed on the operator issue, but it held 
that it lacked jurisdiction to reach the 
other issues. So the court of appeals va-
cated  the  district  court’s  judgment  on 
those  issues.  TCEQ  and  DRCP  peti-
tioned  for  review  in  the  Supreme 
Court.   
 
The  Supreme  Court  reversed. 
The  Court  held  that  the  plain  text  of 
TCEQ’s  definition  of  operator  and  not 
the  court  of  appeal’s  previously  deter-
mined  definition  of  “operator”  from 
Heritage  on  San  Gabriel  Homeowners 
Association  v.  Texas  Commission  on 
Environmental  Quality,  393  S.W.3d 
417  (Tex.  App.—Austin  2012,  pet.  de-
nied),  applied.  Under  the  plain  text  of 
the  rule,  there  was  substantial  evi-
dence  to  support  TCEQ’s  finding  that 
DRCP was the mine’s operator.  
The Court further held that the 
 
court of appeals had jurisdiction to ad-
dress the remaining issues even after it 
affirmed  the  reversal  of  the  permit  on 
the  operator  issue.  The  Court  ex-
plained  that  a  court’s  prudential  deci-
sion  to  decline  to  reach  certain  issues 
not  necessary  to  the  disposition  of  a 
case  is  not  the  same  as  the  constitu-
tional prohibition on advisory opinions. 
The  Court  declined  to  address 
 
the remaining issues without the court 
of appeals having addressed them first. 
Accordingly, the Court reversed and re-
manded  the  case  for  further  proceed-
ings consistent with the opinion.  

 Jurisdiction 
a)  Pape  Partners  v.  DRR  Fam. 
Props.,  LP,  645  S.W.3d  267 
(Tex. May 20, 2022) [21-0049] 
The issue in this case is whether 
the Texas Commission on Environmen-
tal  Quality  has  jurisdiction  to  adjudi-
cate conflicting claims to ownership of 
surface-water  rights.  Pape  Partners 
and related parties bought a 1,086-acre 
farm  in  McLennan  County  from  Lola 
Robinson.  The  purchase  included  the 
right  to  divert  water  from  the  Brazos 
River for irrigation under a permit that 
TCEQ  issued  to  Robinson  years  prior. 
Robinson  had  also  owned  an  adjacent 
tract  with  appurtenant  water  rights, 
and  that  tract  was  eventually  sold  to 
DRR  Family  Properties.  TCEQ  up-
dated its records in response to chain-
of-title  documentation  submitted  by 
Pape, DRR, and other nearby landown-
ers.  The  updated  records  reflected 
Pape’s right to irrigate only 821 acres, 
which was less than the full acreage of 
the farm. 

Pape  filed  suit  in  district  court, 
seeking a declaration that it possessed 
surface-water rights to the entire farm. 
DRR filed a plea to the jurisdiction, ar-
guing  that  TCEQ  has  exclusive  juris-
diction  to  determine  water-ownership 
rights. The trial court granted the plea, 
and the court of appeals affirmed.  

The  Supreme  Court  began  its 
analysis with the presumption in favor 
of  district  court  jurisdiction  and  the 
corresponding rule that an administra-
tive  agency  may  only  exercise  those 
powers  that  the Legislature  has given 
to it in clear and express statutory lan-
guage. The Court then turned to Chap-
ters 5 and 11 of the Water Code. DRR 
exclusive 
argued 

TCEQ’s 

that 

4 
 

jurisdiction  is  provided  for  in  Section 
5.013(a),  which  grants  TCEQ  “general 
jurisdiction”  over  certain  enumerated 
items,  including  “water  rights  adjudi-
cation.”  But  the  Court  explained  that 
the inclusion of “water rights adjudica-
tion” in Section 5.013(a) is a reference 
to the Water Rights Adjudication Act in 
Chapter 11. The provisions of Chapter 
11,  in  turn,  demonstrate  that  water 
rights adjudication is a term of art for 
TCEQ’s process of allocating the rights 
to  the  water  of  a  particular  source 
through  permits.  That  process,  which 
is  outlined  in  Chapter  11,  requires  a 
district court to determine all issues of 
law  and  fact  independently  of  TCEQ. 
By  contrast,  nothing  in  the  statute’s 
plain text gives TCEQ the authority to 
decide  conflicting  claims  to  water 
rights acquired with the title to land. 

The Court held that TCEQ lacks 
jurisdiction to decide conflicting claims 
of ownership to surface-water rights. It 
reversed the court of appeals’ judgment 
and  remanded  the  case  to  the  trial 
court for further proceedings. 
 

 Texas Water Code

Quality,  646  S.W.3d  498 
(Tex.  June  10,  2022)  [19-
1104] 

The main issues in this case con-
cern  the  Texas  Commission  on  Envi-
ronmental Quality’s authority to grant 
an injection-well permit after a final or-
der  from  the  Railroad  Commission  re-
required 
scinding 
no-harm  letter,  and  the  extent  of 
TCEQ’s authority to alter and add find-
ings  of  fact  following  a  contested  case 
hearing. 

statutorily 

the 

facility 

TexCom  Gulf  Disposal,  LLC, 
sought  to  develop  a  commercial  waste 
disposal 
in  Montgomery 
County. TexCom applied for TCEQ per-
mits to operate one existing Class I in-
jection well and three others it planned 
to construct. The Railroad Commission 
issued a no-harm letter and TCEQ pre-
liminarily  approved  the  application. 
Montgomery  County,  the  City  of 
Conroe, affected individuals, and other 
parties challenged this approval, argu-
ing  the  wells  would  harm  their  sole 
source of underground drinking water. 
The  State  Office  of  Administra-
tive Hearings (SOAH) held a contested 
case hearing on the matter. SOAH rec-
ommended  TCEQ  conditionally  grant 
TexCom’s  permits,  but  TCEQ  re-
manded, instructing SOAH to consider 
new evidence.  

Around  this  time,  Denbury  On-
shore  acquired  a  mineral  interest  un-
derneath  the  proposed  site  and  inter-
vened  in  the  process  in  opposition  to 
the permits. SOAH conducted another 
hearing  and  recommended  denying 
TexCom’s  applications,  reasoning  that 
Denbury’s  future  operations  would 
pump  disposed  waste  back  to  the  sur-
face.  Two  months  later,  the  Railroad 
its  previous 
Commission  rescinded 
no-harm  letter.  But  that  rescission 
would  not  become  effective  for  ninety 
days. Before those ninety days passed, 
TCEQ  issued  a  revised  final  order 
granting  TexCom’s  application.  TCEQ 
changed  some  of  SOAH’s  findings  of 
fact. 

The County, City, and individu-
als sought judicial review of TCEQ’s or-
der,  arguing  primarily  that  the  recis-
sion  of  the  no-harm  letter  voided  the 
proceedings  and  that  TCEQ  did  not 

5 
 

have the authority to change the find-
ings of fact that it did. The trial court 
affirmed TCEQ’s order. The parties ap-
pealed,  and  a  divided  court  of  appeals 
affirmed.  

The  Supreme  Court  affirmed. 
The Court held that the Railroad Com-
mission’s rescission of its no-harm let-
ter did not void TCEQ’s final order. The 
Court next held that TCEQ did not act 
arbitrarily,  capriciously,  or  abuse  its 
discretion by deciding not to reopen the 
record  and  undergo  more  proceedings 
after the Railroad Commission’s rescis-
sion. TCEQ had all of the relevant evi-
dence before it, including the Railroad 
Commission’s  final  order  and  the  evi-
dence that made the Railroad Commis-
sion change its mind.  

The Court then held that TCEQ 
had the authority to make its changes 
to  SOAH’s  findings  of  fact,  so  long  as 
the  changes  were  supported  by  sub-
stantial evidence. The Court held that 
in this case, they were. TCEQ also ade-
quately  explained 
its  changes  by 
providing the basis for its decision and 
allowing  the  petitioners  to  prepare 
their appeal. 

The  Court  also  addressed  vari-
ous other arguments raised by the pe-
titioners and affirmed the judgment of 
the court of appeals. 

 

 

 Evidence of Agreement 
a)  AMC  Ent.  Holdings,  Inc.  v. 
iPic-Gold  Class  Ent.,  LLC, 
638 S.W.3d 198 (Tex. Jan. 14, 
2022) [20-0014] 

This  case  concerned  an  allega-
tion by boutique-theater chain iPic that 
megaplex-theater  chain  AMC  con-
spired  with  another  megaplex-theater 

chain  under  Section  15.05(a)  of  the 
Texas  Free  Enterprise  and  Antitrust 
Act to put iPic out of business. The evi-
dence  turned  on  a  film-industry  prac-
tice in which a theater asks a film’s dis-
tributor  to  grant  it  a  “clearance”—an 
exclusive license to show the film in the 
theater’s  geographic  market  for  a  pe-
riod of time. The evidence showed that 
on  the  same  day  in  July  2014,  AMC 
asked several film-distribution compa-
nies  to  grant  it  clearances  against  an 
iPic theater that was planned in Frisco, 
while  AMC’s  rival,  Regal  Entertain-
ment Group, asked the same distribu-
tion  companies  to  grant  it  clearances 
against  an  iPic  under  construction  in 
Houston.  iPic  alleged  that  AMC  and 
Regal  conspired  to  assert  clearances 
against  these iPic  theaters  in  order  to 
put  iPic  out  of  business  in  Frisco  and 
Houston.  After  iPic  and  Regal  settled, 
the trial court granted summary judg-
ment for AMC, but the court of appeals 
reversed.  

agreement 

The  main  issue  in  the  Supreme 
Court  of  Texas  was  whether  iPic  had 
raised a fact issue on the existence of a 
between 
conspiratorial 
AMC  and  Regal.  The  Court  explained 
that  the  Texas  statute  is  construed  in 
accordance with federal law construing 
Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act 
and  that  decisions  of  the  Supreme 
Court  of  the  United  States  limit  what 
inferences  can  reasonably  be  drawn 
from circumstantial evidence of a con-
spiracy. Specifically, the jurisprudence 
of  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United 
States  teaches  that  (1)  parallel  busi-
ness conduct, alone, is insufficient evi-
dence  of  conspiracy,  (2)  when  the  con-
spiracy  alleged  is  implausible,  more 
is  needed  to 
persuasive  evidence 

6 
 

survive summary judgment, and (3) the 
plaintiff’s  evidence  must  tend  to  ex-
clude  the  possibility  that  the  defend-
ants acted independently. 

The  Supreme  Court  of  Texas 
first held that the factual context of the 
case  rendered  iPic’s  conspiracy  claim 
implausible. The Court pointed out the 
undisputed evidence that a Regal exec-
utive  had  informed  an  iPic  executive 
that  Regal  planned  to  “clear”  iPic’s 
Houston theater several months before 
iPic began planning a theater in Frisco. 
The Court also observed that AMC and 
Regal did not need to work together in 
order to seek the clearances that each 
sought. 

The  Court  went  on  to  examine 
the  evidence  in  light  of  the  “plus  fac-
tors” that federal courts have found to 
suggest an agreement. The Court char-
acterized  iPic’s  evidence  as  resting  on 
parallel business conduct and suspicion 
and concluded that it did not tend to ex-
clude the possibility that AMC acted in-
dependently of Regal. Accordingly, the 
Court reversed the court of appeals and 
rendered judgment for AMC and Regal. 
 

 

 Enforcement  of  Arbitration 

Agreement 

a)  Baby  Dolls  Topless  Saloons, 
Inc. v. Sotero, 642 S.W.3d 583 
(Tex. Mar. 18, 2022) (per cu-
riam) [20-0782] 

 
At  issue  in  this  case is  whether 
three terms in a written contract—“re-
lationship,”  “license,”  and  “this  agree-
ment”—are so unclear as to render the 
contract and the arbitration agreement 
contained  therein  unenforceable.  And 
further,  if  the  contract  is  valid  and 

enforceable, whether arbitration is ap-
propriate. 

This  dispute  arose  from  the 
tragic  death  of  Stephanie  Sotero  Her-
nandez.  Hernandez  was  killed  in  a 
high-speed crash while riding in a car 
driven by Mayra Naomi Salazar in the 
early morning hours after the two adult 
entertainers  had  left  work  at  Baby 
Dolls Topless Saloons (the Club). Her-
nandez’s  family  sued  the  Club  for 
wrongful death and survival damages, 
alleging  that  the  Club  served  Salazar 
alcohol  after  knowing  she  was  clearly 
intoxicated.  Almost  two  years  prior  to 
the accident, Hernandez and the Club 
had  signed  a  12-page  contract—re-
ferred  to  throughout  the  written  con-
tract as “this Agreement”—giving Her-
nandez  a  “revocable  license  (the  Li-
cense)  and  non-exclusive  right  to  use 
and  occupy  the  designated  portions  of 
the [Club’s premises]” for “the perform-
ing  of  live  erotic  dance  entertainment 
and  related  activities.”  The  contract 
contained a broad arbitration provision 
“pursuant  to  the  Federal  Arbitration 
Act[.]” Once the Family sued the Club, 
the Club moved to compel arbitration. 
A divided court of appeals affirmed the 
trial court’s denial of the Club’s motion 
to compel arbitration. The court of ap-
peals  held  that  “the  parties’  minds 
could not have met regarding the con-
tract’s subject matter and all its essen-
tial terms such that the contract is not 
an enforceable agreement.”  
 
In a per curiam opinion, the Su-
preme Court reversed and directed the 
trial court to grant the Club’s motion to 
compel arbitration. The Court resolved 
the  contract’s  alleged  ambiguities  us-
ing  well-established  principles  of  con-
Additionally, 
tract 

construction. 

7 
 

because  the  contract’s  arbitration  pro-
vision  clearly  and  unmistakably  dele-
gated threshold arbitrability questions 
to  an  arbitrator,  the  Court  compelled 
arbitration for the arbitrator to decide 
any  gateway  issues  the  parties  had 
agreed to arbitrate. Finally, addressing 
the  Family’s  alternative  argument—
that even if a valid contract existed at 
some point, it had expired by the time 
of  Hernandez’s  accident—the  Court 
held  that,  based  on  the  separability 
doctrine, such a question is for an arbi-
trator to decide because it does not call 
the contract’s formation or validity into 
question.  
 

b)  CHG  Hospital  Bellaire,  LLC 
v.  Johnson,  644  S.W.3d  188 
(Tex.  Apr.  22,  2022)  (per  cu-
riam) [21-0441] 

This  case  concerns  whether  an 
employee’s  sworn  testimony  that  she 
did  not  recall  acknowledging  an  elec-
tronic  arbitration  agreement  is  suffi-
cient to create a fact issue as to its va-
lidity.  Seketa Johnson was injured on 
the  job  and  sued  her  employer,  CHG 
Bellaire,  LLC,  for  negligence,  gross 
negligence,  and  premises 
liability. 
CHG  moved  to  compel  arbitration, ar-
guing that the parties had consented to 
an  enforceable  arbitration  agreement. 
The trial court denied the motion. The 
court of appeals affirmed, holding that 
Johnson’s sworn testimony that she did 
not  recall  acknowledging  the  arbitra-
tion  agreement  at issue  created  a  fact 
question as to its validity. 

After the court of appeals issued 
its opinion, the Supreme Court decided 
Aerotek,  Inc.  v.  Boyd,  624  S.W.3d  199 
(Tex.  2021).  CHG  appealed,  and  the 
parties  agreed  that  under  Aerotek, 

Johnson failed to raise a fact issue as to 
whether  she  consented  to  the  arbitra-
tion agreement. Accordingly, the Court 
reversed the court of appeals’ judgment 
and remanded the case so it could con-
sider  Johnson’s  alternative  argument 
that  her  claims  do  not  fall  within  the 
scope of the arbitration agreement. 
 

c)  In  re  Ayad,  655  S.W.3d  285 
(Tex. Sept. 23, 2022) (per cu-
riam) [22-0078]  

The  issue  in  this  case  was 
whether the trial court erred by enforc-
ing  a  premarital  agreement  providing 
for arbitration of disputes before a reli-
gious  tribunal.  Mariam  Ayad  sued  to 
divorce her husband and be appointed 
joint managing conservator of the cou-
ple’s son. Husband filed a counterpeti-
tion and moved to enforce a prenuptial 
agreement  providing  that  any  marital 
conflict would “be resolved according to 
the  Qur’an,  Sunnah,  and  Islamic  Law 
in a Muslim court, or in [its] absence by 
a  Fiqh  Panel.”  Ayad  raised  several 
challenges to the validity and enforcea-
bility of the agreement, including chal-
lenges  based  on  the  indefiniteness  of 
terms,  unconscionability,  and  public 
policy.  The  trial  court  concluded  that 
under  the  Texas  General  Arbitration 
Act,  it  was  required  to  enforce  the 
agreement.  It  therefore  ordered  the 
parties to arbitration without address-
ing  Ayad’s  validity  and  enforceability 
challenges. The court of appeals denied 
Ayad’s mandamus petition.  

The  Supreme  Court  granted 
Ayad’s  mandamus  petition  without 
hearing  oral  argument.  The  Court  ex-
plained that the trial court had abused 
its discretion by compelling arbitration 
without  deciding  Ayad’s  challenges 

8 
 

because the Family Code alters the or-
dinary  rule  regarding  who  decides  va-
lidity  and  enforceability  challenges  to 
an  arbitration  agreement  when  the 
agreement  is  asserted  in  a  suit  for  di-
vorce or custody of a child.  

The  Court  noted  that  a  trial 
court’s  error  in  compelling  parties  to 
arbitration is ordinarily reviewable by 
eventual appeal from a final judgment 
enforcing an arbitration award. But the 
Court  held  that  Ayad  lacks  an  ade-
quate  remedy  by  appeal  because  the 
trial  court’s  error  here  was  ignoring  a 
statutory  command  unique  to  the  di-
vorce  context  to  try  issues  of  validity 
and enforceability before ordering arbi-
tration. 
 

d)  In  re  Whataburger  Restau-
rants  LLC,  645  S.W.3d  188 
(Tex. Apr. 22, 2022) [21-0165] 
There  are  two  issues  in  this 
mandamus  proceeding:  (1)  whether  a 
party who does not receive notice of an 
order  in  time  to  appeal  because  of  a 
trial  court  clerk’s  error  may  appeal; 
and  (2)  whether  an  arbitration  agree-
ment  between  Whataburger  Restau-
rants LLC (Relator) and Yvonne Card-
well (Real Party in Interest) is illusory. 
On  both  issues,  the  Supreme  Court 
held in Whataburger’s favor. 

In  February  2013,  Cardwell 
sued  her  employer,  Whataburger,  al-
leging that she had been injured while 
working  as  a  dishwasher  at  one  of 
Whataburger’s  El  Paso  restaurants. 
Whataburger moved to compel arbitra-
tion based on its mandatory arbitration 
policy.  The

Whataburger’s  motion,  holding  that 
the  policy  was  unconscionable.  The 
court  of  appeals  reversed  the  trial 

court 

court’s  order  and  remanded  with  in-
structions  to  the  trial  court  to  grant 
Whataburger’s  motion  and  order  arbi-
tration, but the court of appeals failed 
to  adjudicate  Cardwell’s  cross-points. 
The Supreme Court granted Cardwell’s 
petition  for  review,  and  without  hear-
ing  oral  argument,  issued  a  short  per 
curiam opinion reversing and remand-
ing to the court of appeals to either ad-
dress  Cardwell’s  alternative  argu-
ments  or  remand  the  case  to  the  trial 
court to address them. On remand, the 
court  of  appeals  rejected  all  of  Card-
well’s  remaining  arguments  but  one: 
that  the  policy  was  illusory  because 
Whataburger  could  revoke  it  at  any 
time. The court declined to resolve the 
issue and instead remanded the case to 
the trial court because (1) neither party 
had  entered  the  entire  handbook  into 
the record and (2) it was unclear to the 
court of appeals whether the trial court 
had  passed  on  the  illusoriness  issue 
when  it  denied  Whataburger’s  motion 
to compel initially.  

From there, Whataburger filed a 
supplemental  motion  to  compel  arbi-
tration  addressing  Cardwell’s  illusori-
ness argument. A month later, the trial 
court denied the motion with a one-sen-
tence  order  (the  August  2018  order). 
However,  the  clerk  failed  to  give 
Whataburger or Cardwell notice of the 
order denying the supplemental motion 
to compel arbitration. Whataburger re-
ceived notice of the order 153 days after 
it had been issued—long after both the 
twenty-day deadline to appeal and the 
ninety-day  deadline  extension  allowed 
by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 306a. 
Eight days after learning of the denial 
of  its  supplemental  motion  to  compel,

Whataburger 

moved

reconsideration  and  for  a  determina-
tion of the date it received notice of the

to  reconsider.  It  then  issued  an  order

received notice of its order denying the 
supplemental motion to compel within

The  Supreme  Court  first  held 
that Whataburger lacked an adequate 
appellate remedy by appeal. The Court 
reasoned  that  Whataburger  was  de-
prived of its right to appeal an interloc-
utory  order  by  the  trial  court  clerk’s 
failure to give the required notice of the 
August  2018  order,  and  then  by  the 
trial  court’s  refusal  to  vacate  the  Au-
gust 2018 order and decide Cardwell’s 
illusoriness challenge anew. The Court 
explained  that  counsel  should  have 
some  right  to  rely  on  the  text  of  Rule 
306a, which imposes a duty on clerks to 
provide notice of trial court orders. Fur-
ther, 
that 
Court 
Whataburger acted promptly to protect 
is right to appellate review upon learn-
ing of the August 2018 order, and as a 
result, it had not slept on its rights.  
 
Second, the Court  held that the 
trial  court  abused  its  discretion  in 
denying Whataburger’s motion to com-
pel  arbitration.  Here,  the  Court  ad-
dressed  Cardwell’s  illusoriness  argu-
ment,  noting  that  the  policy  contains 
detailed restrictions on Whataburger’s 
ability to change the policy. Pointing to 
a  case  with  similar  arbitration  policy 
language, the Court concluded that the 
policy’s  restrictions  on  Whataburger’s 
ability  to  modify  or  revoke  the  policy

The  trial  court  granted  Taylor  Wood-
row  and  Taylor  Morrison’s  motion  to 
compel arbitration with respect to Mr. 
Ha, but it denied the motion as to Mrs. 
Ha  and  the  children.  The  court  of  ap-
peals affirmed. 

The  Supreme  Court  reversed. 
Under  direct-benefits  estoppel,  liti-
gants  who  sue  based  on  a  contract  or 
who otherwise seek direct benefits from 
the  contract  subject  themselves  to  its 
terms, including any arbitration provi-
sion.  The  Court  held  that  direct-bene-
fits  estoppel  applies  in  this  case  be-
cause Mrs. Ha and the children sought 
direct benefits from Mr. Ha’s purchase 
agreement by living in the home. When 
a  spouse  and  minor  children  live  in  a 
family  home  purchased  by  the  other 
spouse, they have accepted direct bene-
fits  from  the  other  spouse’s  purchase 
agreement such that they may be com-
pelled  to  arbitrate  under  that  agree-
ment’s  arbitration  provision  when  the 
family  sues  as  an  integrated  unit  for 
factually  intertwined  construction-de-
fect claims.

tract  claims—and  therefore  may  be 
compelled to arbitrate under their par-
ents’ arbitration agreement—when the 
petition  fails  to  distinguish  between 
the parents’ and children’s causes of ac-
tion.  

Jack and Erin Skufca purchased 

rendered it not illusory. The Court then 
turned  to  Cardwell’s  additional  illuso-
riness argument: the policy’s language 
conditions  the  parties’  promises  to  ar-
bitrate on Cardwell’s continued, at-will 
employment.  The  Court  noted  a  prior 
case  with  substantially  similar  policy 
language  that  the  Court  had  upheld. 
The  Court  explained  that  the  policy 
here  makes  clear  that  the  parties’ 
agreement to arbitrate was not depend-
ent  on  Cardwell  employment  status, 
and  as  a  result,  the  policy  is  not  illu-
sory. For these reasons, the Court con-
ditionally granted mandamus relief.

v.  Ha,  ___  S.W.3d  ___,  2023 
WL  443891  (Tex.  Jan.  27, 
2023) (per curiam) [22-0331] 
The issue in this case is whether 
a  spouse  and  minor  children  may  be 
compelled to arbitrate pursuant to the 
other  spouse’s  arbitration  agreement 
when the family sues for construction-
defect  claims  concerning  their  family 
home.  

Tony  Ha  signed  a  purchase 
agreement  to  buy  a  home  from  home-
building  company  Taylor  Morrison. 
The  purchase  agreement  included  an 
arbitration  provision.  Mr.  Ha  later 
sued Taylor Morrison, alleging that the 
home  had  developed  significant  mold 
problems  and  asserting  claims  based 
on  construction  defects  and  fraud.  He 
was  joined  in  the  suit  by  his  wife, 
Michelle  Ha,  and  their  three  minor 
children. In their original petition, the 
Ha family collectively asserted a num-
ber  of  claims,  including  breach  of  con-
tract.  They  later  amended  their  peti-
tion, however, so that only Mr. Ha as-
serted  the  breach-of-contract  claim.

a  home  from  homebuilding  company 
Taylor  Morrison.  The  purchase  agree-
ment included an arbitration provision. 
The  Skufcas  allege  that  less  than  a 
year  after  moving  in,  the  home  devel-
oped  significant  mold  problems  that 
caused  their  children  to  be  continu-
ously ill. They sued Taylor Morrison for 
construction  defects  and  fraud.  The 
Skufcas’ petition included both Mr. and 
Mrs.  Skufca  as  plaintiffs,  as  well  as 
Mrs.  Skufca  as  next  friend  of  the  cou-
ple’s two minor children. The Skufcas’ 
petition,  however,  did  not  distinguish 
between  the  parents  and  children  in 
any of its causes of action, including the 
breach-of-contract claim.  

Taylor  Morrison  moved  to  com-
pel  the  Skufcas  to  arbitrate.  The  trial 
court denied the motion as it pertained 
to  the  children.  Taylor  Morrison  ap-
pealed, arguing that direct-benefits es-
toppel—the  principle  that  a  litigant 
who  sues  based  on  a contract  subjects 
himself to the contract’s terms, includ-
ing  its  arbitration  provision—requires 
the  children  to  arbitrate  their  claims. 
The court of appeals affirmed, holding 
that direct-benefits estoppel did not ap-
ply because, based on its reading of the 
petition,  the  children  did  not  actually 
join the breach-of-contract claim.  

The  Supreme  Court  reversed. 
The  Court  held  that,  because  the 
breach-of-contract  claim  simply  re-
ferred to “Plaintiffs” and did not distin-
guish between the parents and the chil-
dren, the children joined their parents’ 
breach-of-contract  claim.  The  children 
were thus subject to  their parents’ ar-
bitration  agreement  through  direct-
benefits estoppel. Moreover, even if the 
children  had  asserted  only  tort  and 
they 
other  noncontractual  claims, 

11 
 

would still be compelled to arbitrate be-
cause they sought direct benefits from 
their  parents’  purchase  agreement  by 
living in the home and suing for factu-
ally 
intertwined  construction-defect 
claims. 
 

 

 Fees 
a)  Sunchase  IV  Homeowners 
Ass’n, Inc. v. David Atkinson, 
643 S.W.3d 420 (Tex. Apr. 8, 
2022) (per curiam) [20-0682]  
The issue in this case is whether 
a  defendant  condominium  association 
is  entitled  to  attorney’s  fees  after  ob-
taining  a  take-nothing  judgment  on 
claims by a plaintiff unit owner. 

David  Atkinson,  a  unit  owner, 
sued  the  homeowners  association  of 
Sunchase  IV,  a  condominium  complex 
in South Padre, Texas. Following hur-
ricane  damage,  Atkinson  alleged  that 
Sunchase, among other things, created 
a fraudulent scheme to keep  insurance 
monies  from,  and  shift  repair  obliga-
tions to, individual owners. He also ar-
gued that Sunchase violated its govern-
ing  documents  by  making  changes  to 
individual units, failing to repair com-
mon  elements,  and  violating  settle-
involving  preferential 
ment 
parking.  Sunchase  responded  with  a 
declaratory  judgment  counter  claim 
and a request for attorney’s fees under 
the Uniform Condominium Act and the 
Uniform  Declaratory  Judgments  Act. 
The trial court granted Sunchase’s mo-
tion  for  summary  judgment  on  twelve 
declaratory  issues and  the  jury  found 
against  Atkinson  on  his  remaining 
claims.  The  jury  also  concluded  that 
Sunchase  was  entitled  to  reasonable 
attorney’s fees. 

terms 

The  court  of  appeals  affirmed 
the trial court’s take-nothing judgment 
but held that Sunchase was not entitled 
to  attorney’s  fees  under  either  ground 
argued  at  trial. As  to  the  UDJA,  the 
court concluded that Sunchase did not 
state  a  claim  for  affirmative  relief  be-
cause its request for  declaratory relief 
was  a  mirror  image  of  Atkinson’s 
claims.  Regarding  the  Condominium 
Act, the court of appeals concluded that 
Sunchase  was  not  a  prevailing  party 
because  (1)  it  was  not  adversely  af-
fected  by  a  violation of Chapter 82 or 
the  condominium’s  declaration  or  by-
laws, and (2) it did not seek affirmative 
relief. 

of 

Because  the  Court  previously 
held that a party may qualify as a “pre-
vailing  party” by  “successfully  defend-
ing  against  a  claim  and  securing  a 
take-nothing judgment,” the Court held 
that Sunchase is entitled to attorney’s 
fees  as  a  prevailing party  under  the 
Condominium  Act.  Contrary  to  the 
court 
conclusion, 
appeals’ 
Sunchase—a  defendant—need  not 
have  shown  that  it  was  adversely  af-
fected by a violation of the Condomin-
ium Act or that it obtained affirmative 
relief. A party that successfully defends 
against a plaintiff’s main issues and ob-
tains  a  take-nothing  judgment  quali-
fies as a prevailing party because it ob-
tains actual and meaningful relief that 
materially alters the parties’ legal rela-
tionship.  Because  Atkinson  alleged 
that his damages were due to violations 
of Sunchase’s governing documents, his 
suit was an “action to enforce” the con-
dominium’s  declaration  and  bylaws, 
and Sunchase obtained a take-nothing 
judgment  on  all  of  Atkinson’s  claims, 
Sunchase  is  a  prevailing  party  and 

12 
 

entitled to attorney’s fees under Chap-
ter  82.  The  Court  did  not  reach 
Sunchase’s  Declaratory  Judgment  Act 
ground. 

Without hearing oral argument, 
the  Court  granted  Sunchase’s  petition 
for  review,  reversed  the  court  of  ap-
peals’  judgment  as  to  attorney’s  fees, 
and  reinstated  the  trial  court’s  judg-
ment awarding fees to Sunchase. 
 

 Liability to Non-clients 
a)  Taylor v. Tolbert, 644 S.W.3d 
637  (Tex.  May  6,  2022)  [20-
0727] 

The issue in this case is whether 
attorney immunity applies to nonclient 
civil suits alleging an attorney has en-
gaged in conduct criminalized by stat-
ute. 

In  this  case,  nonclients  filed  a 
civil  suit  alleging  a  lawyer  violated 
state  and  federal  law  by  improperly 
“using” and “disclosing” electronic com-
munications  illegally  “intercepted”  by 
the lawyer’s client and others during a 
child-custody  modification  proceeding. 
At some point during that proceeding, 
an  iPad  belonging  to  the  client’s  sis-
ter-in-law  began  receiving  text  mes-
sages  and  emails  between  the  client’s 
ex-wife  and  other  individuals.  The  cli-
ent  shared  his  ex-wife’s  messages  and 
emails with his attorney for use in the 
modification proceeding. The iPad was 
also turned over to a forensic expert for 
back-up imaging.   

The  attorney  moved  for  sum-
mary judgment on the pleadings, argu-
ing  that  attorney  immunity  precludes 
her  liability  as  a  matter  of  law.  The 
trial  court  agreed,  but  a  divided  court 
of appeals reversed and remanded. 

 

 Abortion 
a)  Zimmerman v. City of Austin, 
658 S.W.3d 289 (Tex. Dec. 30, 
2022) (per curiam) [21-0262] 
The issue in this case is whether 
a statute that was never expressly re-
pealed  is  enforceable after  a  case  that 
held the statute to be unconstitutional 
was overruled. 

The  City  of  Austin  approved  a 
budget  that  included  funding  for  enti-
ties  that  provide  support  to  residents 
who  seek  abortions.  Don  Zimmerman 
sued the City, alleging that this budget 
allocation violated a Texas statute that 
prohibits furnishing the means for pro-
curing  an  abortion.  The  trial  court 
granted the City’s plea to the jurisdic-
tion, and the court of appeals affirmed. 
The  court  of  appeals  concluded  that 
Zimmerman’s  claim  could  not  proceed 
because of the United States Supreme 
Court’s  opinion  in  Roe  v.  Wade,  410 
U.S.  113  (1973).  Zimmerman  peti-
tioned the Texas Supreme Court for re-
view,  arguing  that  the  statute  was 
never repealed and therefore remained 
enforceable despite Roe. 

After  the  Court  requested  and 
received briefs on the merits, the U.S. 
Supreme  Court  issued  its  opinion  in 
Dobbs  v.  Jackson  Women’s  Health  Or-
ganization,  142  S.  Ct.  2228  (2022), 
which  overruled  Roe.  The  Texas  Su-
preme Court vacated the lower courts’ 
judgments  and  remanded  this  case  to 
the  trial  court  to  address  the  effect  of 
this change in the law, as well as any 
intervening factual developments. 
 

The  Supreme  Court  held  that 
immunity  attached  to  the  state  wire-
tapping  claims  but  not  to  the  federal 
claims.  The  attorney  conclusively  es-
tablished that the conduct at issue oc-
curred  within  the  scope  of  her  repre-
sentation and was not foreign to the du-
ties of an attorney. But, the Court ex-
plained,  conduct  prohibited  by  statute 
is  neither  categorically  excepted  from 
the attorney-immunity defense nor cat-
egorically  immune  from  liability.  Ra-
ther,  whether  an  attorney  may  claim 
the privilege depends on the particular 
statute at issue.  

Here,  the  attorney  was  entitled 
to  immunity  on  the  state  claims  be-
cause  the  Texas  wiretap  statute  has 
not  abrogated  the  common-law  attor-
ney-immunity  defense,  either  ex-
pressly  or  by  necessary  implication. 
The Court reached a different result as 
to  the  federal  claims  because  the  fed-
eral  wiretap  statute  is  worded  differ-
ently  and  because  informative  federal 
authority  persuaded  the  Court  that 
federal courts would not apply Texas’s 
common-law  attorney-immunity  de-
fense to a claim under that statute. The 
Court  reaffirmed  that  when  the  de-
fense  applies,  counsel  is  shielded  only 
from  liability  in  a  civil  suit,  not  from 
other mechanisms that exist to discour-
age  and  remedy  bad-faith  or  wrongful 
conduct,  including  sanctions,  profes-
sional discipline, or criminal penalties, 
as appropriate. 

The  Court  affirmed  in  part,  re-
versed  and  rendered  in  part,  and  re-
manded  the  case  to  the  trial  court  for 
further  proceedings  on  the  federal 
wiretap claims.

 Due Course of Law 
a)  Mitchell  v.  MAP  Resources, 
Inc.,  649  S.W.3d  180  (Tex. 
May 13, 2022) [21-0124] 

At 

issue 

in  this  case  was 
whether  service  by  posting  in  a  1999 
tax-delinquency suit violated a defend-
ant’s procedural due process rights and 
rendered the subsequent default judg-
ment  and  sale  of  her  mineral  interest 
void.  

Elizabeth  Mitchell,  who  died  in 
2009, was the owner of a mineral inter-
est  in  property  in  Reeves  County.  In 
2015, her heirs sued challenging a 1999 
default judgment foreclosing a tax lien 
on  Elizabeth’s  interest.  They  alleged 
that  the  1999  judgment  was  void  be-
cause  Elizabeth  was  not  properly 
served  with  notice  of  the  underlying 
suit and thus the judgment violated her 
constitutional  right  to  procedural  due 
process. The Mitchells argued that the 
taxing  authorities  did  not  attempt  to 
serve Elizabeth personally in the suit, 
despite the fact that her name and ad-
dress  were  available  in  publicly  rec-
orded  warranty  deeds,  and  this  vio-
lated her due process rights. Respond-
ents, MAP Resources and other current 
owners of the mineral interest who pur-
chased  the  property  at  a  tax  sale  or 
later acquired an interest in it, argued 
that those deeds and records could not 
be properly considered in the Mitchells’ 
collateral attack because they were ev-
idence extrinsic to the record of the un-
derlying  suit.  The  trial  court  granted 
summary  judgment  for  MAP  and  or-
dered that the Mitchells take nothing. 
A divided court of appeals affirmed.  

The  Mitchells  appealed  to  the 
Supreme  Court,  which  reversed  the 
court  of  appeals’  judgment.  First,  the 

14 
 

Court held that in a collateral attack on 
a  default 
judgment,  contact  infor-
mation  available  in  deed  and  tax  rec-
ords  may  be  considered  in  deciding 
whether  service  by  posting  satisfied 
due process. Following its and the Su-
preme Court of the United States’ due 
process cases, the Court concluded that 
Rule  117a  of  the  Texas  Rules  of  Civil 
Procedure, which governs service of ci-
tation on defendants in suits for delin-
quent ad valorem taxes, requires that a 
party  seeking  to  serve  a  defendant  by 
publication must conduct a diligent in-
quiry into the defendant’s whereabouts 
first,  and  a  diligent  inquiry  would  in-
clude  a  search  of  relevant  public  rec-
ords. Accordingly, when public records 
contain  the  address  of  a  defendant 
served  by  publication  or  posting,  a 
court  hearing  a  collateral  attack  on  a 
judgment  may  consider  that  evidence 
in  deciding  whether  service  complied 
with the constitutional demands of due 
process.  

then 

The  Court 

considered 
whether the record established a juris-
dictional  defect  and  concluded  that  it 
did. The record showed that the taxing 
authorities did not comply with the re-
quirements of Rule 117a or the consti-
tutional  requirements  of  due  process 
because  Elizabeth  was  not  personally 
served,  despite  the  availability  of  her 
address  in  public  records.  The  Court 
held  that  the  record  underlying  the 
1999  judgment  demonstrated  that  the 
taxing authorities’ service of Elizabeth 
was insufficient to satisfy the require-
ments  of  due  process.  The  Court  re-
versed  the  court  of  appeals’  judgment 
for  MAP  and  rendered  partial  sum-
mary judgment that the court hearing 
the tax foreclosure suit did not acquire 

personal jurisdiction over Elizabeth. It 
remanded the remaining issues in the 
case, including some of MAP’s defenses 
that were not properly on appeal, to the 
trial court for further proceedings.  
 

 Due Process 
a)  B. Gregg Price, P.C. v. Series 
1  –  Virage  Master  LP,  ___ 
S.W.3d 
2023  WL 
2052775 (Tex. Feb. 17, 2023) 
(per curiam) [21-1104] 

___, 

The issue in this case is whether 
due process entitles a defendant to an 
amended notice of hearing when a trial 
court  cancels  a  hearing  and  subse-
quently  reschedules  it  for  the  same 
date. 

B. Gregg Price, P.C., a law firm, 
took out a loan from Series 1 – Virage 
Master LP.  Virage  alleged  that  B. 
Gregg Price personally guaranteed the 
loan and that his law firm failed to re-
pay the loan. Virage sued Price and the 
firm  and  moved  for  summary  judg-
ment. 

Virage served Price with the mo-
tion  for  summary  judgment  on  March 
12, 2020, and notified him of the hear-
ing set for April 2. That same day, the 
trial  court  announced  that  in-person 
proceedings  would  be  canceled  in  re-
sponse to the emerging COVID-19 pan-
demic.  Price’s  lawyer  saw  this  an-
nouncement and assumed he would be 
notified of a new hearing date when the 
hearing was rescheduled. Rather than 
reschedule  the  oral  hearing,  the  court 
changed the hearing method to submis-
sion and scheduled it for April 2. Price’s 
lawyer  first  realized  the  change  when 
he contacted the court on April 1, and 
he  immediately  filed  a  response.  On 
trial  court  granted 
April  2,  the 

15 
 

summary judgment for Virage without 
considering Price’s late-filed response. 
Price  moved  for  a  new  trial, 
which the trial court denied. The court 
of appeals held that the original notice 
was sufficient to apprise Price of the re-
scheduled  hearing  date  and  affirmed 
the  summary  judgment  for  Virage. 
Price petitioned the Supreme Court for 
review.  

The Court reversed, holding that 
Price did not receive adequate notice of 
the April 2 hearing as required by the 
United States and Texas Constitutions. 
Notice of a proceeding must be reason-
ably  calculated,  given  the  circum-
stances,  to  apprise  the  parties  of  the 
pending action and give them a mean-
ingful opportunity to respond. When a 
previously  scheduled  hearing  is  can-
celed by the trial court, a new hearing 
requires  new  notice.  Price  did  not  re-
ceive proper notice as required by due 
process  and  is  therefore  entitled  to  a 
new trial. 
 

 Property Interests 
a)  Tex.  Dep’t  of  State  Health 
Servs. v. Crown Distrib., 647 
S.W.3d  648  (June  24,  2022) 
[21-1045] 

The  question  in  this  case  was 
whether  the  plaintiffs  had  a  constitu-
tionally  protected 
in  pro-
cessing  and  manufacturing  of  smoka-
ble hemp products.  

interest 

The  plaintiffs  in  this  case  (the 
Hemp Companies) are Texas-based en-
tities  that  manufacture,  process,  dis-
tribute,  and  sell  hemp  products—in-
cluding  smokable  hemp  products—in 
Texas.  They  sued  the  Department  of 
State Health Services and its commis-
the 
sioner 

challenge 

to 

constitutionality  of  Health  and  Safety 
Code  section  443.204(4),  which  re-
quires that the Department’s rules reg-
ulating  the  sale  of  consumable  hemp 
products  prohibit  “the  processing  or 
manufacturing  of  a  consumable  hemp 
product for smoking,” and the validity 
of  the  Department’s  rule  300.104, 
which prohibits the “manufacture, pro-
cessing,  distribution  or  retail  sale  of 
consumable  hemp  products  for  smok-
ing.”  

The  trial  court  issued  a  final 
judgment declaring the statute uncon-
stitutional, declaring the rule invalid in 
its entirety, and permanently enjoining 
the  Department  from  enforcing  the 
statute and rule.  

The  Department  filed  a  direct 
appeal in the Supreme Court. The De-
partment  argued  that  the  due-course 
clause does not protect the Hemp Com-
panies’  interest  in  manufacturing  or 
processing  smokable  hemp  products. 
The  Hemp  Companies  asserted  that 
the state’s ban against the manufactur-
ing  and  processing  of  smokable  hemp 
products  in  Texas  violates  the  Consti-
tution’s  due-course  clause  because  the 
ban  has  no  rational  connection  to  any 
possible  government  interest  and  its 
real-world effect is so burdensome as to 
be  oppressive  in  light  of  any  govern-
mental interest.  

The  Court  held  that  the  Texas 
Constitution’s  due-course  clause  does 
not  protect  the  Hemp  Companies’  as-
serted  interest.  The  Court  noted  that 
the due-course clause is not so broad as 
to  protect  every  form  and  method  in 
which one may choose to work or earn 
a  living,  and  some  work-related  inter-
ests do not enjoy constitutional protec-
tion  at  all.  And  some  occupational 

16 
 

interests exist only because the govern-
ment  has  created  them  or  made  them 
available.  Furthermore,  a  person’s 
property interest in that occupation is 
only constitutionally protected when it 
is  “vested.”  A  property  interest  is  not 
vested when a person has a mere uni-
lateral expectation that his occupation 
will remain legal.  

The  Hemp  Companies  argued 
that  their  right  had  vested  because  it 
has  always  been  legal  to  manufacture 
and  process  products  from  certain 
parts  of  hemp  plants.  But  the  Court 
noted that the Hemp Companies do not 
make products from the historically le-
gal  part  of  hemp  plants,  but  from  the 
flowers,  buds,  and  leaves,  which  were 
considered  to  be  “marihuana”  and 
therefore  illegal  under  prior  law.  Nei-
ther did the Court consider it relevant 
that the Hemp Companies legally man-
ufactured smokable hemp products for 
a few months before section 443.204(4) 
became  effective.  Such  a brief  window 
of legality existed only by a temporary 
administrative  quirk  in  the  process  of 
the  substance’s  partial  decriminaliza-
tion.  Such  a  fleeting “right”  was in  no 
sense “vested” in the Companies, which 
had, at most, a mere anticipation that 
the government would allow a right it 
created  to  continue  in  existence.  Nor 
would the uncertain state of the law for 
a  few  months  transform  the  long-pro-
hibited  manufacture  of  smokable  can-
nabis  flower  into  the  kind  of  “lawful 
calling”  to  which  courts  have  afforded 
constitutional protection.  

The  Court  therefore  held  that 
the  manufacture  and  processing  of 
smokable  hemp  products  is  neither  a 
liberty  interest  nor  a  vested  property 
interest the due-course clause protects. 

The Court therefore reversed the trial 
court’s judgment.  

Justice Young filed a concurring 
opinion, in which Chief Justice Hecht, 
Justice  Devine,  and  Justice  Blacklock 
joined.  Justice  Young  agreed  that  the 
due-course clause does not protect the 
Hemp Companies’ interests as they as-
serted them. But he expressed concern 
that  the  state  of  the  jurisprudence  on 
the due-course clause was muddled. He 
thus provided a textual, historical, and 
structural  analysis  of  the  clause  that 
he hoped would aid future inquiry.  
 

 Retroactivity 
a)  Fire  Prot.  Serv.,  Inc.  v.  Sur-
vitec  Survival  Prods.,  Inc., 
649 S.W.3d 197 (Tex. June 3, 
2022) [21-1088] 

At issue in this case is whether a 
statute that requires good cause for the 
termination  of  certain  agreements  be-
tween equipment suppliers and dealers 
is  unconstitutionally  retroactive  when 
applied to an at-will agreement entered 
into before the statute took effect. 

Fire  Protection  Service  (FPS) 
orally  agreed  to  be  an  authorized 
dealer  of  life  rafts  manufactured  by 
Survitec  Survival  Products.  FPS  and 
Survitec  agreed  that  either  of  them 
could terminate their agreement at any 
time  for  any  reason  or  for  no  reason.  
Several years later, the Legislature en-
acted the Fair Practices of Equipment 
Manufacturers,  Distributors,  Whole-
salers,  and  Dealers  Act.  Among  other 
things, the Act prohibits an equipment 
supplier  from  terminating  a  dealer 
agreement without good cause. The Act 
states  that  it  applies  to  an  agreement 
existing  before  the  Act  takes  effect  if 
the  agreement  has  no  expiration  date 

17 
 

and is a continuing contract. 

Nearly  six  years  after  the  Act 
took  effect,  Survitec  terminated  the 
agreement without providing a reason. 
FPS  sued,  alleging  Survitec  violated 
the  Act,  and  the  case  was  removed  to 
federal court. The district court entered 
judgment  for  Survitec  as  a  matter  of 
law, concluding that application of the 
Act  to  the  parties’  preexisting  at-will 
agreement  violated  the  prohibition  on 
retroactive laws in Article I, Section 16 
of  the  Texas  Constitution.  FPS  ap-
pealed,  and  the  Fifth  Circuit  certified 
to the Texas Supreme Court the ques-
tion of whether the Act’s application vi-
olated  the  Constitution’s  retroactivity 
clause. 

The  Supreme  Court  held  that 
application  of  the  Act  to  the  parties’ 
agreement did not violate the constitu-
tional  prohibition  against  retroactive 
laws. The retroactivity clause protects 
only settled expectations. Because FPS 
and  Survitec’s  agreement  was  open-
ended and at-will, Survitec had no rea-
sonable  settled  expectation  that  it 
could  continue  to  operate  under  the 
terms of that agreement in perpetuity. 
And  Survitec  had  sufficient  time  be-
tween  the  Act’s  enactment  and  effec-
tive  date  to  take  whatever  actions  it 
thought necessary to avoid or defer the 
Act’s application to its contractual rela-
tionship with FPS but instead chose to 
continue  operating  under  the  agree-
ment.

a)  City  of  Baytown  v.  Schrock, 
623 S.W.3d 394 (Tex. May 13, 
2022) [20-0309] 

This  case  examines  whether  a 
city’s  wrongful  refusal  to  connect 

utility  service  to  a  landlord’s  property 
was  a  constitutional  taking  requiring 
just compensation. Alan Schrock was a 
landlord  in  the  City  of  Baytown  who 
lost  a  tenant  after  the  city  refused  to 
connect  utility  services  to  Schrock’s 
property due to past-due utility bills for 
services provided to other tenants. The 
city’s  enforcement  ordinance  authoriz-
ing  the  withholding  of  services  con-
flicted  with  the  Texas  Government 
Code,  which  prohibits  municipalities 
from  conditioning  service  on  payment 
of outstanding utility bills incurred by 
other  customers  residing  at  the  same 
address.  Schrock  sued  the  city  for  in-
verse  condemnation  and  other  claims.

After 
Schrock’s  regulatory  takings  claim  re-
mained. The trial court directed a ver-
dict  for  the  city,  concluding  that 
Schrock  had  failed  to  adduce  evidence 
of a regulatory taking. The court of ap-
peals reversed, concluding that fact is-
sues existed as to whether a regulatory 
taking  existed.  The  Supreme  Court  of 
Texas  reversed  the  court  of  appeals’ 
judgment  and  reinstated  the  trial 
court’s directed verdict.

lengthy 

The Court held that Schrock ad-
duced no evidence of a regulatory tak-
ing  because  the  city’s  enforcement  ac-
tion did not regulate land use in a man-
ner that constituted a taking or perma-
nently deprive Schrock of his property. 
The  city’s  ordinance  was  unrelated  to 
land use, and it provided a means to re-
dress  the  enforcement  actions  related 
to the past-due bills.   

In a concurrence, Justice Young 
wrote  to  address  the  scope  of  takings 
under the Texas Constitution and sug-
gest lack of causation as an additional 
reason  for  reversing  the  court  of

 Formation 
a)  Cadence Bank, N.A. v. Roy J. 
Elizondo III, 642 S.W.3d 530 
(Tex.  Mar.  18,  2022)  [20-
0273] 

The  issue  in  this  breach  of  con-
tract dispute is whether a bank’s wire 
transfer  request  form  created  a  con-
tractual  duty  on  behalf  of  the  bank  to 
“verify”  funds  before  completing  the 
wire  transfer  as  requested  by  a  bank-
ing customer. 

Petitioner  Cadence  Bank,  N.A., 
is  a  regional  banking  franchise.  Re-
spondent, Roy J. Elizondo III, is a Hou-
ston-based  lawyer.  In  2014,  Elizondo 
was  scammed.  The  scammer  sought 
Elizondo’s representation in a debt-col-
lection action. Once Elizondo agreed to 
the  representation,  the  scammer  in-
formed  Elizondo  that  the  debtor  had 
agreed  to  settle  and  would  mail  Eli-
zondo a cashier’s check in the amount 
of  the  settlement.  The  scammer  in-
structed  Elizondo  to  deposit  the  check 
into his IOLTA account—which he held 
with  Cadence  Bank—and  then  wire  a 
portion of the funds to a third party in 
Japan. After receiving a cashier’s check 
that appeared to be drawn from an ac-
count  at  Chase  Bank,  Elizondo  depos-
ited  the  check  into  his  account.  After 
contacting Cadence to execute the wire 
transfer,  a  Cadence  Bank  employee 
emailed  Elizondo  a  one-page  form  ti-
International  Outgoing  Wire 
tled 
Transfer  Request.  The  form  contains, 
among other fields, a listed transfer fee 
of $55 and blanks for administrative in-
formation to be filled in by Cadence af-
ter  receiving  Elizondo’s  signature  and 

before  initiating  the  transfer.  It  also 
contains  this  preprinted  admonish-
ment  to  any  Cadence  employee  who 
handles  a  wire  transfer:  “Before  sign-
ing  off,  be  sure  you  ‘know  your  cus-
tomer’  and  have  verified  the  collected 
balance and documented any exception 
approvals.”  Pursuant  to  Elizondo’s  in-
structions, Cadence wired a large por-
tion of the deposited funds to the Japa-
nese bank account Elizondo had identi-
fied on the form. Chase dishonored the 
cashier’s  check  the  very  next  day  and 
returned  it  to  Cadence  unpaid.  Ca-
dence notified Elizondo that the check 
was  returned,  charged  the  provision-
ally deposited amount back to this ac-
count,  and  demanded  that  he  pay  the 
overdrawn funds. Elizondo refused.  

Cadence 

sued  Elizondo 

for 
breach  of  the  deposit  agreement, 
breach of warranty under Section 4.207 
of  the  Uniform  Commercial  Code 
(UCC),  and  common-law  torts.  Eli-
zondo  raised  various  defenses  and 
counter-claimed for breach of contract, 
fraud,  and  negligent  misrepresenta-
tion.  Cadence  moved  for  summary 
judgment on its affirmative claims, and 
Elizondo  filed  a  counter-motion  for 
summary  judgment  on  his  breach-of-
contract  claim.  The  trial  court  denied 
Cadence’s  motion,  granted  Elizondo’s, 
and signed a final judgment that each 
party take nothing. A split panel of the 
court of appeals affirmed. 

Elizondo  claims  that  Cadence’s 
damages were caused by its breach of a 
superseding  contractual  duty  as  ex-
pressed  in  the  wire  transfer  request 
form.  Elizondo  argues  that  by  signing 
the  top  part  of  the  wire-transfer  form 
and emailing it back to a Cadence em-
ployee,  Elizondo  made  an  offer  to  pay 

19 
 

Cadence  $55  to  transfer  money  from 
the  “collected  balance”  of  his  account, 
which, according to Elizondo, is the re-
maining  balance  once  provisionally 
credited  funds  are  excluded.  That  the 
transfer  only  be  made  from  Elizondo’s 
“collected balance” was a material term 
of the agreement established by the ad-
ministrative field with that phrasing in 
the  bottom  half  of  the  form.  Cadence 
accepted Elizondo’s offer by completing 
the form and initiating the transfer. If 
Cadence had fulfilled its duty to ensure 
that Elizondo’s “collected balance” was 
sufficient  before  making  the  transfer, 
then Cadence would have seen that Eli-
zondo’s  collected  balance  was  insuffi-
cient, it would not have made the trans-
fer, and it would not have any damages. 
The  Supreme  Court  disagreed 
with Elizondo’s argument, holding that 
the wire-transfer form fails to create an 
enforceable  contract  at  all.  The  Court 
reasoned that the form’s title is “Inter-
national  Outgoing  Transfer  Request,” 
and  the  form  has  all  the  indicia  of  a 
form whose purpose is to facilitate Ca-
dence’s internal processing of the wire 
transfer.  Contrary  to  Elizondo’s  view, 
the mere presence of the phrases “Col-
lected  Balance/Cash”  and  “Employee 
Who  Verified  Collected  Balance”  on  a 
form  created  by  Cadence  cannot  have 
the effect of implicitly imposing on Ca-
dence  a  contractual  duty  that  super-
seded its rights under the UCC and the 
deposit agreement. Were that the case, 
a  bank’s  routine  administrative  forms 
could  potentially  override  the  UCC’s 
default rules. Thus, the Court reversed 
the  court  of  appeals’  judgment,  re-
manding  the  case  to  the  trial  court  to 
consider  Elizondo’s  remaining  claims 
and defenses.  

 Implied Revocation of Offer 
a)  Angel  v.  Tauch,  642  S.W.3d 
481 (Tex. Jan. 14, 2022) [19-
0793] 

This  contract  dispute  involved 
the seldom invoked doctrine of implied 
revocation.  The  issue  was  whether  an 
offer to settle a debt was revoked when 
the  offeree  learned  from  a  third  party 
that the offeror had  assigned the debt 
for collection.  

South  State  Bank  held  a  $4.6 
million  judgment  against  Kyle  Tauch, 
which  the  bank  purportedly  offered  to 
settle for $2 million while admonishing 
Tauch  that  he  needed  to  act  “quickly” 
because  the  bank  would  “likely  be 
look[ing]  at  other  collection  alterna-
tives.”  Two  days  later,  the  Bank  exe-
cuted an agreement assigning the judg-
ment  to  another  of  Tauch’s  creditors, 
the Gobsmack Gift Trust, for collection. 
Almost  immediately  thereafter,  the 
trust’s attorney emailed Tauch’s attor-
ney,  notifying  him  about  the  assign-
ment  and  demanding  payment  in  full 
on  the  judgment.  At  Tauch’s  request, 
the trustee’s attorney forwarded a copy 
of  the  assignment  agreement,  which 
bore  a  stated  effective  date  of  the  fol-
lowing  day.  On  receipt  of  the  assign-
ment  agreement,  Tauch  promptly 
emailed  the  bank  to  accept  the  settle-
ment offer. 

The bank and the trust rejected 
Tauch’s  assertion  that  a  binding  con-
tract  to  settle  the  debt  for  $2  million 
had been formed by his acceptance be-
fore the assignment agreement’s effec-
tive date. Cross actions for declaratory 
and  other  relief  ensued,  and  on  cross 

20 
 

motions  for  summary  judgment,  the 
trial  court  held  that  any  offer  was  re-
voked on Tauch’s receipt of the assign-
ment  agreement.  The  court  of  appeals 
reversed  in  a  split  decision,  holding 
that the assignment did not render the 
bank unable to go forward with the of-
fer at the time of acceptance because its 
stated effective date was the following 
day. The dissent opined that the effec-
tive date was immaterial because prec-
edent  set  the  standard  for  an  implied 
revocation as requiring only “some act 
inconsistent with the offer,” not an act 
precluding the offer from materializing 
into a contract. 

The  Supreme  Court  reversed 
and  rendered  judgment  that  no  con-
tract  to  settle  the  debt  was  formed. 
More than 75 years ago, in Antwine v. 
Reed, 199 S.W.2d 482, 485 (Tex. 1947), 
the Court held that an offer could be re-
voked without express words of revoca-
tion,  so 
long  as  the  offeree  had 
knowledge  that  the  offeror  had  acted 
inconsistently  with  the  offer.  Antwine 
was  the  first  and  last  time  the  Court 
applied the doctrine. Because Antwine 
involved  a  land  transaction  and  infor-
mation communicated to the offeree by 
the offeror’s agent, the parties disputed 
whether other types of offers can be im-
pliedly  revoked  and  whether  the  doc-
trine  is  applicable  when  the  offeree 
learns  about  the  offeror’s  inconsistent 
action  indirectly  rather  than  directly 
from the offeror or its agent. 

The Court held that the doctrine 
is not constrained to land transactions 
and  the  touchstone  is  inconsistent  ac-
offeror’s 
tion  manifesting 

the 

unwillingness  to  enter  the  proposed 
bargain.  The  assignment  agreement’s 
effective date did not preclude its exe-
cution from manifesting the bank’s un-
willingness  to  enter  the  settlement. 
The dispositive issue is not the offeror’s 
ability  to  enter  the  proposed  bargain 
but continued willingness to do so, and 
assigning  the  judgment  for  collection 
was  inconsistent  with  an  intent  to  re-
lease  the  judgment.  Tauch’s  receipt  of 
the  assignment  agreement  was  suffi-
ciently  reliable  information  about  the 
bank’s action to effectuate a revocation 
of the settlement offer. 

 
 Procuring-cause Doctrine 
a)  Perthuis v. Baylor Miraca Ge-
netics  Lab’ys,  LLC,  645 
S.W.3d  228  (Tex.  May  20, 
2022) [21-0036] 

This  breach-of-contract  action 
addresses whether a former at-will em-
ployee was entitled to commissions on 
sales that closed after his termination.  
Respondent  Baylor  Miraca  Ge-
netics Laboratories, LLC (BMGL) hired 
petitioner  Perthuis  as  its  Vice  Presi-
dent  of  Sales  and  Marketing  in  2015. 
BMGL drafted the employment agree-
ment,  which  gave  Perthuis  an  annual 
base  salary,  provided  that  Perthuis’s 
employment  would  be  at-will,  and 
stated  that  Perthuis’s  commission 
would “be 3.5% of your net sales.” The 
employment  agreement  did  not  define 
“net sales” or place any other parame-
ters on the commission obligation.  

BMGL 

terminated  Perthuis 
days  after  he  had  completed  negotia-
tions  for  a  large  contract.  BMGL  then 
refused to pay Perthuis commissions on 
any  sales  finalized  after  his  termina-
tion  regardless  of  whether  Perthuis 

21 
 

had  secured  the  sale.  Perthuis  sued 
BMGL for breach of contract, asserting 
that BMGL had wrongly refused to pay 
him  commissions.  The  case  went  to 
trial, and the court instructed the jury 
on  the  procuring-cause  doctrine.  The 
jury  found  for  Perthuis  but  did  not 
award him the full amount he sought. 
The court of appeals reversed, holding 
that  the  procuring-cause  doctrine  did 
not apply and that the parties’ contract 
unambiguously  entitled  Perthuis  to 
commissions  only  for  sales  made  dur-
ing his employment. 

The  Supreme  Court  reversed  the 
court of appeals and remanded the case 
to  that  court.  It  clarified  that  the  pro-
curing-cause  doctrine  is  nothing  more 
than a default rule of construction: if a 
contract  promises  a  commission,  the 
broker is entitled to a commission if the 
broker proves that the sale was the di-
rect  and  proximate  result  of  the  bro-
ker’s efforts unless the parties’ contract 
provides otherwise. Parties remain free 
to displace the default rule of the pro-
curing-cause  doctrine  with  different 
contract  terms.  But  if  the  parties  did 
not do so, the broker’s entitlement to a 
commission vests upon his having pro-
cured the sale, not upon involvement in 
a  sale’s  execution  or  the  broker’s  con-
tinued employment.  

The  contract  in  this  case  was  si-
lent about any exceptions to the obliga-
tion  to  pay  commissions.  The  Court 
therefore  found  the  procuring-cause 
doctrine  applied.  The  Court  then  re-
manded  the  case  for  the  court  of  ap-
peals  to  assess  any  further  challenges 
that  BMGL  preserved, 
including 
BMGL’s sufficiency challenge.  

Justice  Huddle,  joined  by  Justice 
Boyd,  dissented.  The  dissent  would 

have  limited  the  procuring-cause  doc-
trine  to  seller-broker  relationships  in 
the real-estate context and would have 
found  the  doctrine  inapplicable  in  the 
employment-at-will  context.  The  dis-
sent would have held that the commis-
sion  provision  was  ambiguous,  and 
therefore  would  have  remanded  the 
case  for  a  jury  to  determine  whether 
the parties intended Perthuis to receive 
commissions on post-termination sales. 
 

 Releases  and  Reliance  Dis-

claimers  

a)  Transcor  Astra  S.A. 

v. 
Petrobras  America,  Inc.,  650 
S.W.3d  462  (Tex.  April  29, 
2022) [20-0932] 
This  case  arises 

from 

  
the 
breakup of a joint venture between two 
international  petroleum  corporations. 
In  2006,  Petrobras  and  Astra  entered 
into  a  stock  purchase  and  sale  agree-
ment that created the joint venture to 
own  and  operate  a  Texas  oil  refinery. 
By 2009, the parties became embroiled 
in numerous disputes, which were ad-
judicated  in  arbitration.  The  arbitra-
tion award terminated their joint ven-
ture  and  required  Astra  to  sell  its  50-
percent  interest  in  the  refinery  to 
Petrobras.  Petrobras  accepted  the  in-
terest but failed to pay Astra the $640 
million purchase price. The parties con-
tinued litigating and arbitrating issues 
until 2012 when the parties reached a 
comprehensive  settlement  agreement. 
At  the  time,  Astra  had  obtained  over 
$750  million  in  judgments  against 
Petrobras  and  had  other  pending 
claims  demanding  $400  million  more. 
As  part  of  this  settlement  agreement, 
Petrobras  agreed  to  pay  Astra  more 

22 
 

than  $820  million  to  satisfy  the  judg-
ments against Petrobras.  

After  the  settlement  agreement 
was  signed,  Petrobras  alleged  that  it 
later  discovered  that  Astra  had  en-
gaged in substantial corruption to con-
vince  Petrobras  to  accept  the  2006 
stock-purchase  agreement  and  2012 
settlement  agreement.  Upon  discover-
ing  Astra’s 
alleged  misconduct, 
Petrobras sued Astra and also initiated 
an arbitration proceeding.  

Astra filed a series of summary-
judgment motions based on the settle-
ment  agreement’s  release  and  dis-
claimer  of  reliance.  The  trial  court 
granted those motions and issued a fi-
nal judgment that the 2012 settlement 
agreement bars Petrobras’s claims, in-
cluding the claims asserted in arbitra-
tion. The judgment also awarded Astra 
$1.3 in attorney’s fees and costs. 

Petrobras  appealed  the  final 
judgment, and the court of appeals re-
versed.  The  court  held  that  Petrobras 
released  its  fiduciary-duty  claims  to 
the extent they relate to the 2006 set-
tlement  agreement  but  not  to  the 
claims  related  to  the  negotiation  and 
signing  of  the  2012  settlement  agree-
ment.  The  court  of  appeals  also  held 
that  the  settlement  agreement’s  reli-
ance disclaimer bars Petrobras’s fraud 
claims  against  the  Astra  entities  but 
not  against  the  individual  defendants 
named  in  this  suit.  Finally,  the  court 
held  that  the  release  bars  Petrobras’s 
remaining claims to the extent they are 
derivative  of  the  fraud  claims.  The 
court then reversed Astra’s award of at-
torney’s fees and remanded for further 
proceedings. Both Astra and Petrobras 
petitioned this Court for review. 

The  Supreme  Court  concluded 
that the settlement agreement bars all 
of  Petrobras’s  claims  in  both  this  suit 
and  the  arbitration  proceeding.  In  do-
ing so, the Court held that Petrobras’s 
claims relating to fiduciary duties were 
barred  by  the  settlement  agreement’s 
release because the claims fell outside 
of the release’s exception clause. Next, 
the  Court  held  that  the  settlement 
agreement’s  reliance  disclaimer  was 
enforceable under the Forest Oil factor 
test. The Court also held that the set-
tlement agreement and its reliance dis-
claimer extended protection to the indi-
vidual  defendants,  and  it  held  that 
Petrobras’s fraud claims against the in-
dividuals  were also barred.  Related  to 
the ongoing arbitration proceeding, the 
Court  held  that  the  stock  purchase 
agreement’s arbitration clause was su-
perseded by the 2012 settlement agree-
ment,  and  thus,  the  claims  Petrobras 
asserted 
in  arbitration  were  also 
barred  by  the  settlement  agreement. 
And  finally,  the  Court  reinstated  the 
trial court’s attorney’s fee award under 
section 37.009 of the Texas Civil Prac-
tice and Remedies Code. 
 

 Substantial Compliance 
a)  James  Constr.  Grp.,  LLC  v. 
Westlake  Chem.  Corp.,  650 
S.W.3d  392  (Tex.  May  20, 
2022) [20-0079] 

 
This  case  arises  out  of  a  con-
struction  contract  dispute  between  an 
owner and contractor; the principal is-
sues are: (1) whether the owner was re-
quired to strictly (or only substantially) 
comply with a written-notice condition 
precedent to recover damages in a ter-
mination  for  default;  (2)  whether  the 
owner could substantially comply with 

23 
 

the  written-notice  requirement  absent 
a writing; and (3) whether a provision 
barring recovery of consequential dam-
ages  merely  waived  liability  for  such 
damages or constituted a covenant not 
to sue.   

Westlake,  the  owner,  replaced 
James, the contractor, for safety viola-
tions following a fatal accident involv-
ing a James employee. The contract al-
lowed  Westlake  to  assign  work  to 
James  and  other 
contractors  at 
Westlake’s  discretion.  Westlake  was 
entitled  under  the  intervention  clause 
to intervene and require James to im-
prove its safety at James’s cost if James 
was  performing  work  unsafely.  And 
Westlake was entitled to terminate the 
contract with James for convenience or 
default. To terminate for default based 
on safety violations and recover associ-
ated  costs,  Westlake  was  required  to 
give  James  three  notices  in  writing: 
(1) that  Westlake  had  reasonably  de-
termined there were serious safety vio-
lations  (triggering  a  72-hour  window 
for James to begin remediation efforts); 
(2) that  Westlake  was  not  reasonably 
satisfied  with  the  pace  and  quality  of 
James’s  remediation  efforts;  and  (3) 
that James was terminated for default. 
The  contract  also  included  an  indem-
nity  provision  and  a  waiver  of  conse-
quential damages. 

Westlake sued James for breach 
of contract to recover the costs of hiring 
a replacement contractor. James coun-
terclaimed, alleging Westlake breached 
by  improperly  terminating  James  for 
default  and  seeking  contractually  pro-
hibited  consequential  damages.  The 
jury found that Westlake substantially 
complied with all three of the safety-vi-
olation-section’s notice conditions, and 

that James violated both the interven-
tion clause and the safety-violation sec-
tion  by  failing  to  pay  Westlake’s  costs 
associated with transferring the work. 
It  also  found  that  James  violated  the 
indemnity  provision  by  failing  to  in-
demnify  Westlake  in  litigation  follow-
ing  the  worksite  fatality  and  that 
Westlake  violated  the  consequential-
damages  waiver  by  suing  James  for 
consequential damages. The trial court 
rendered judgment largely on the jury’s 
verdict,  awarding  both  parties  dam-
ages and attorney’s fees.     

The  court  of  appeals  affirmed 
the judgment as to the award of dam-
ages  and  attorney’s  fees  to  Westlake 
and reversed as to the award to James 
on its counterclaim. The court held that 
the  doctrine  of  substantial  compliance 
applied to the notice requirements and 
that the evidence was legally sufficient 
to  support  the  jury’s  findings  that 
Westlake  substantially  complied.  The 
court  also  held  that  Westlake  did  not 
breach  the  contract  by  seeking  conse-
quential  damages  because  the  provi-
sion barring such damages was merely 
a liability waiver, not a covenant not to 
sue.  

The  Supreme  Court  affirmed  in 
part, reversed in part, and remanded to 
the  trial  court  for  further  proceedings 
on  Westlake’s  attorney’s  fees.  The 
Court  first  held  that  substantial  com-
pliance  was  the  appropriate  standard 
when  evaluating  compliance  with  a 
contractual-notice condition. However, 
the  Court  explained  that  without  a 
writing in some form, a party does not 
comply,  substantially  or  otherwise, 
with  a  written-notice  condition.  The 
Court  concluded  that  at  a  minimum, 
Westlake  failed  to  provide  two  of  the 

24 
 

three  required  written  notices.  To  the 
extent 
from 
there  were  writings 
Westlake to James, they failed to pro-
vide the requisite notice, and it was un-
disputed  that  there  was  no  writing 
whatsoever giving the final notice ter-
minating  James.  The  Court  therefore 
held  Westlake  did  not  substantially 
comply  with  the  written-notice  condi-
tions  precedent  to  termination  for  de-
fault  and  was  not  entitled  to  contract 
damages  under  that  provision.  The 
Court further rejected Westlake’s argu-
ment  that  the  intervention  clause, 
which  had  no  notice  requirement, 
served  as  an  independent  ground  for 
the same damages award, holding that 
the  intervention  clause  could  not  be 
used  as  an  end-run  around  the  more 
stringent requirements under the con-
tract’s termination-for-default section.   
However,  the  Court  affirmed  as 
to James’s failure to comply with its in-
demnity  obligations.  The  Court  re-
that 
jected 
Westlake’s failure to provide the requi-
site  notices  under  the  safety-violation 
section  constituted  a  material  breach 
that excused those obligations because 
the  written-notice  requirement  was  a 
condition  precedent  to  termination  for 
default, not a covenant. The Court fur-
ther  affirmed  the  take-nothing  judg-
ment  on  James’s  counterclaim  for 
breach  of  contract  under  the  conse-
quential-damages waiver, interpreting 
the provision to constitute a waiver of 
liability for consequential damages, not 
a  covenant  not  to  sue.  Construing  the 
provision’s  language  as  a  whole  and 
considering the nature of the waiver—
which bars only a type of damages—the 
Court  held  that  the  provision  did  not 
subject  a  party  to  liability  merely  for 

argument 

James’s 

seeking  damages  that  are  ultimately 
classified as consequential rather than 
direct. Accordingly, while James could 
not be held liable for Westlake’s conse-
quential  damages,  Westlake  did  not 
breach 
consequential-damages 
waiver by seeking them.     

the 

Chief  Justice  Hecht,  joined  by 
Justice Devine, Justice Busby, and Jus-
tice  Bland,  dissented  in  part,  opining 
that  Westlake  substantially  complied 
with the safety-violation section’s writ-
ten-notice  requirements.  Chief  Justice 
Hecht  would  have  held  that  a  writing 
was not required to substantially com-
ply in light of evidence of actual notice. 
He  also  would  have  held  that  there 
were  writings  supplying  notice  from 
Westlake  as  to  the  first  two  requisite 
notices and that a writing from James 
supplied  the  final  required  notice.  Fi-
nally, the dissent argued that the inter-
vention  clause, 
independently  sup-
ported Westlake’s award. 

Justice  Boyd,  joined  by  Justice 
Blacklock  and  Justice  Huddle,  dis-
sented as to James’s the consequential-
damages  counterclaim,  opining  that 
the provision unambiguously created a 
covenant  not  to  sue  and  that  the  trial 
court’s  judgment  in  James’s  favor  on 
that claim should be reinstated. 
 

 

 Fiduciary Duties 
a)  In  re  Estate  of  Poe,  648 
S.W.3d  277  (Tex.  June  17, 
2022) [20-0178] 

The  issues  in  this  case  are  (1) 
whether a director of a corporation may 
owe an informal fiduciary duty to man-
age the corporation in the best interest 
of  an  individual  shareholder  in  addi-
tion to his formal fiduciary duties to the 

25 
 

corporation,  and  (2)  whether  the  jury 
was  correctly  charged  regarding  the 
statutory  safe  harbor  under  Business 
Organizations  Code  Section  21.418(b) 
for  an  otherwise  self-dealing  transac-
tion. 

Dick Poe, as the sole director of 
Poe  Management,  Inc.  (PMI),  author-
ized  the  issuance  of  1,100  shares  of 
PMI stock, which he purchased for ap-
proximately  $3.2  million.  Before  the 
share  issuance,  Dick’s  son,  Richard, 
was  PMI’s  sole  shareholder.  Richard 
found out about the share issuance af-
ter Dick’s death, and he sued to invali-
date  the  share  issuance.  Richard  as-
serted two main theories: (1) the share 
issuance was a self-dealing transaction 
that violated Dick’s fiduciary duties to 
PMI  as  a  director,  and  (2)  Dick 
breached an informal fiduciary duty he 
owed  to  Richard  to  manage  PMI  in 
Richard’s best interest. 

Over  Richard’s  objection,  the 
trial court submitted the informal-fidu-
ciary-duty theory to the jury. The trial 
court also submitted a question asking 
about  the  safe  harbor  for  self-dealing 
transactions  under  Section  21.418(b). 
The trial court instructed the jury that 
they could find the share issuance valid 
under  any  of  the  three  conditions  set 
forth in the statute: if it was approved 
by disinterested directors, if it was ap-
proved by a vote of the shareholders, or 
if it was fair to PMI. Richard objected, 
arguing  that  only  the  third  condition 
(fairness to PMI) was raised by the ev-
idence. 

The 

jury 

found 

that  Dick 
breached an informal fiduciary duty he 
owed to Richard and that the share is-
suance  was  not  valid  and  enforceable. 
The  trial  court  rendered  judgment 

invalidating  the  share  issuance.  The 
court of appeals affirmed, holding there 
was  sufficient  evidence  to  support  the 
jury’s  “no”  answer  to  the  question 
whether  the  share  issuance  was  valid 
and 
Section 
21.418(b). Concluding that this finding 
was sufficient to support the judgment, 
the court did not address whether sub-
mission  of  the  informal-fiduciary-duty 
theory was proper.  

enforceable 

under 

The  Texas  Supreme  Court  re-
versed. The Court concluded that, as a 
matter  of  law,  a  corporation’s  director 
cannot owe an informal duty to operate 
or  manage  the  corporation  in  the  best 
interest of or for the benefit of an indi-
vidual shareholder. A director’s fiduci-
ary duty in the management of a corpo-
ration is solely for the benefit of the cor-
poration.  The Court also held that the 
trial  court  abused  its  discretion  by in-
structing the jury that it could find the 
share  issuance  valid  and  enforceable 
based  on  conditions  for  which  there 
was no support in the evidence. 

The  Court  concluded  that  the 
jury’s  deliberations  should  have  fo-
cused solely on whether the share issu-
ance was fair to PMI. As a result of the 
erroneous  submission  of  the  informal-
fiduciary-duty theory and the extrane-
ous instructions regarding grounds for 
finding  the  share  issuance  was  valid 
and enforceable, the trial court’s errors 
likely confused or misled the jury when 
it  answered  this  question.  The  Court 
therefore  held  that  the  trial  court’s 
charge errors probably caused the ren-
dition of an improper judgment and re-
manded for a new trial.

 Settlement Credits 
a)  Virlar 

v. 

Puente, 

___ 
S.W.3d___, 2023 WL 2053170 
(Tex. Feb. 17, 2023) [20-0923] 
The main issues in this medical 
malpractice  case  involve  settlement 
credits  under  Chapter  33  of  the  Civil 
Practice and Remedies Code and peri-
odic  payments  for  future  medical  ex-
penses under the Texas Medical Liabil-
ity Act in Chapter 74 of the Code.  

Jo Ann Puente suffered brain in-
juries  due  to  complications  of  a  prior 
surgery while in the hospital care of Dr. 
Jesus  Virlar.  Puente  and  members  of 
her  family  sued  Virlar;  the  physicians 
association  that  employed  him,  re-
ferred to as Gonzaba; and other health 
care  providers.  Several  claims  settled 
prior  to  trial,  including  the  claims  by 
Puente’s minor daughter against some 
defendants  for  loss  of  consortium  and 
services.  Ultimately,  the  only  claims 
tried were Puente’s claims against the 
non-settling defendants, including Vir-
lar and Gonzaba.  

After  a  jury  verdict  of  $14  mil-
lion for Puente, the defendants moved 
for  a  settlement  credit  under  Chapter 
33,  arguing  that  the  $3.3  million 
Puente’s  daughter  received  in  settle-
ment  should  reduce  the  amount  of 
Puente’s  award.  The  defendants  also 
moved  for  periodic  payments  of  the 
award under the Medical Liability Act. 
The trial court denied both motions. 

A  majority  of  the  court  of  ap-
peals, sitting en banc, largely affirmed. 
Without addressing the predicate ques-
tion  whether  Chapter  33  requires  a 
credit  for  the  daughter’s  settlement, 
the  court  held  that  applying  Chapter 
33 here would violate the Open Courts 

provision  of  the  Texas  Constitution. 
The court further held that the defend-
ants  had  not  presented  sufficient  evi-
dence for the trial court to grant peri-
odic  payments.  The  defendants  peti-
tioned for Supreme Court review. 

The  Court  affirmed  in  part  and 
reversed  in  part.  The  Court  first  re-
versed with respect to the court of ap-
peals’  Chapter  33  analysis.  The  Court 
held that the daughter is a “claimant” 
under  Chapter 33  because  her  claims 
for loss of consortium and services are 
claims  for  injury  to  another  person, 
Puente. Chapter 33 therefore  requires 
that the daughter’s settlement be cred-
ited  against  the  judgment.  The  Court 
went on to hold that applying Chapter 
33  here  would  not  violate  the  Open 
Courts  provision  because  the  statute 
gives  Puente  a  greater  recovery  than 
she  would  have  obtained  under  the 
common law. 

The Court also reversed with re-
spect to the court of appeals’ analysis of 
the  Medical  Liability  Act.  The  Court 
held that the defendants had presented 
sufficient evidence of the statutory pre-
requisites and that the trial court was 
therefore  required  by  the  Act  to  order 
periodic payments for at least some of 
Puente’s  future  damages.  Finally,  the 
Court affirmed with respect to some ev-
identiary  challenges  raised  by  the  de-
fendants.  
 

 Candidates 
a)  In  re  Anthony,  642  S.W.3d 
588 (Tex. Mar. 18, 2022) (per 
curiam) [22-0193] 

The issue in this application for 
mandamus relief is whether a city sec-
retary  correctly  rejected  a  candidate’s 

 

27 
 

application to be on the ballot because 
the  candidate  left  the  blank  to  supply 
her  occupation  blank.  Relator  Linda 
Anthony serves as the current Mayor of 
West  Lake  Hills  but  is  otherwise  re-
tired.  On  her  2022  application  to  ap-
pear on the ballot, she did not fill in an 
answer in the box labeled “Occupation 
(Do not leave blank).” Anthony’s oppo-
nent, Jeffrey Taylor, objected to her ap-
plication for failing to include an occu-
pation,  as  required  by  Texas  Election 
Code  Section  141.031(4)(B).  The  city 
secretary  rejected  Anthony’s  applica-
tion,  and  the  court  of  appeals  denied 
Anthony’s  petition  for  writ  of  manda-
mus.  

Anthony  argued  that  because 
she is retired, she has no occupation to 
include  on  her  application,  and  there-
fore her application does not violate the 
Election  Code.  Taylor  argued  that  the 
Legislature  requires  an  occupation 
from  every  candidate  and  that  there-
fore the city secretary had no discretion 
to accept the application.  

The  Court  granted  Anthony 
mandamus  relief.  The  ordinary  mean-
ing  of  the  word  “occupation”  encom-
passes compensated work, and as a re-
tired, uncompensated mayor, Anthony 
has  no  occupation.  Because  Anthony 
cannot include on her application what 
she  does  not  have,  her  application  did 
not violate the Election Code. The city 
secretary’s  review  of  the  application 
was limited to Taylor’s challenge and to 
Anthony’s  response,  which  demon-
strated that her application was not de-
ficient.  Taylor  did  not  dispute  the  fac-
tual  truth  of  Anthony’s  occupational 
status, only the legal effect of the blank 
box.    

 

 Voting by Mail 
a)  Paxton  v.  Longoria,  646 
S.W.3d  532  (Tex.  June  10, 
2022) [22-0224] 

 
This case involves three certified 
questions relating to a pre-enforcement 
challenge  to  two  recently  enacted  pro-
visions of the Texas Election Code: sec-
tion  276.016(a)(1)  and  section  31.129. 
Section  276.016(a)(1),  enacted  as  part 
of the Election Integrity Protection Act 
of 2021, makes it an offense for a “pub-
lic official or election official” to “know-
ingly . . . solicit[] the submission of an 
application to vote by mail from a per-
son  who  did  not  request  an  applica-
tion.”  Section  31.129  states  that  an 
election official who is employed by or 
is  an  officer  of  the  state  or  a  political 
subdivision  of  the  state  and violates  a 
provision  of  the  Election  Code  may  be 
liable  to  the  state  for  a  civil  penalty, 
which  may  include  termination  and 
loss of employment benefits. 

Isabel  Longoria, 

the  Harris 
County  Elections  Administrator,  and 
Cathy Morgan, a volunteer deputy reg-
istrar serving in Travis and Williamson 
Counties,  sued  in  federal  court  to  en-
join enforcement of the anti-solicitation 
provision  and  the  civil-liability  provi-
sion  (as  applied  to  violations  of  the 
anti-solicitation  provision).  Longoria 
and Morgan sued Texas Attorney Gen-
eral Warren K. Paxton and the district 
attorneys  of  Harris,  Travis,  and  Wil-
liamson  Counties,  all  in  their  official 
capacities. The district court granted a 
preliminary  injunction,  and  Paxton 
and Williamson County District Attor-
ney Shawn Dick appealed. The United 
States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Fifth 
Circuit certified three questions to the 
Court:  (1)  whether  volunteer  deputy 

28 
 

registrars  are  “public  officials”  under 
the Election Code, (2) whether certain 
types  of  speech  constitute  solicitation 
section  276.016(a)(1),  and 
under 
(3) whether  the  Attorney  General  is  a 
proper official to enforce section 31.129. 
The  parties  agreed  on  the  an-
swers  to  the  first  and  third  certified 
questions,  so  the  Court  answered, 
based solely on those agreements, that 
(1)  Morgan,  a  volunteer  deputy  regis-
trar, was not a public official subject to 
section 276.016(a)(1); and (2) the Attor-
ney General lacks authority to enforce 
section  31.129.  Because  there  was  no 
adversity between the parties on those 
questions, the Court disclaimed any ef-
fect of its answers beyond this case. 

With respect to the second certi-
fied question, the Court concluded that 
solicitation under section 276.016(a)(1) 
was not limited to seeking applications 
of  mail-in  ballots  from  persons  who 
were  ineligible  to  vote  by  mail.  The 
plain text of section 276.016(a)(1) pro-
hibits  officials  from  soliciting  the  sub-
mission  of  a  vote-by-mail  application 
from “a person who did not request an 
application.” The Court also concluded 
that  the  definition  of  “solicits”  under 
section  276.016(a)(1)  is  not  limited  to 
demanding  submission  of  an  applica-
tion  for  mail-in  ballots.  Finally,  the 
Court  concluded  that  telling  voters 
they have the opportunity to apply for 
mail-in ballots is not solicitation under 
section 276.016(a)(1), but instead qual-
ifies as providing “general information 
about voting by mail, the vote by mail 
process,  or  the  timelines  associated 
with  voting,”  which  is  expressly  ex-
cluded  from  section  276.016(a)(1)  un-
der section 276.016(e)(1). 
 

 

 Statutory Requirements  
a)  Ex  parte  K.T.  and  Ex  parte 
C.F.,  645  S.W.3d  198  (Tex. 
May  13,  2022)  [20-0977,  21-
0075] 

The  issue  in  these  cases  is 
whether  an  acquittal  and  conviction 
can  form  a  criminal  episode,  which 
would bar expunction of records under 
the expunction statute. 

Respondents K.T. and C.F. each 
has  one  misdemeanor  DWI  conviction 
and,  more  than  three  years  later,  one 
subsequent  misdemeanor  DWI  acquit-
tal. Both respondents filed petitions in 
the  relevant  trial  court  requesting  ex-
punction of the arrest records pertain-
ing  to  their  acquittals.  Separate  trial 
courts  ordered  expunction  of  each  re-
spondent’s  records  over  the  Depart-
ment of Public Safety’s objections. The 
court of appeals in each case affirmed—
over dissenting colleagues—but for dif-
ferent reasons.  

The  K.T.  court  of  appeals  held 
that  an  acquittal  cannot  constitute 
“commission”  of  an  offense;  thus,  one 
conviction  and  one  acquittal  could  not 
form a criminal episode.  The C.F. court 
of  appeals  held  that  C.F.  was  entitled 
to  expunction  because  C.F.’s  two  DWI 
offenses shared no common or continu-
ing  fact  pattern,  did  not  lend  them-
selves  to  joint  prosecution,  and  could 
not  share  a  concurrent  sentence.  So, 
they  did  not  form  a  criminal  episode. 
The  state  petitioned  the  Supreme 
Court for review in both cases.  

The Supreme Court held that re-
spondents  were  entitled  to  expunction 
because  an  acquittal  does  not  consti-
tute  a  “commission  of  an  offense”  and 

29 
 

so cannot form a criminal episode. The 
Court  held  an  acquittal  cannot  be  a 
part of a criminal episode because only 
committed  offenses  can  be  part  of  a 
criminal episode. It reasoned the plain 
meaning  of  “commission”  requires  the 
act  of  “committing,  doing,  performing, 
or perpetrating” and that an acquittal 
illustrates the state failed, rather than 
succeeded, in showing such a “commis-
sion.”  The  Court  concluded  that  to  in-
terpret an offense resulting in acquittal 
as  a  commission  would  contradict  the 
plain meaning of “commission.”  

The Court also rejected respond-
ents’ argument that “commission of an 
offense” only included convictions. The 
Court looked to a nearby statutory pro-
vision for context and concluded it con-
templated  offenses  subject  to  prosecu-
tion  as  eligible  to  forming  a  criminal 
episode.  The  Court  thus  held  that  a 
criminal  episode  could  include  more 
than  just  convictions.  The  Court  af-
firmed the judgments of both courts of 
appeals. 

Justice Boyd filed a dissent, stat-
ing he would have reversed the courts 
of  appeals’  judgments.  He  would  have 
held that acquittals could be part of a 
criminal  episode.  He  also  would  have 
held  that  two  offenses  could  form  a 
criminal episode even if they were com-
mitted years apart from each other be-
cause offenses do not need to be tempo-
rally related to form an episode.  
 

 

 Investigation of Child Abuse 
a)  In re Abbott, 645 S.W.3d 276 
(Tex. May 13, 2022) [22-0229] 
At issue in this case was the ex-
tent of a court of appeals’ authority to 
protect  parties’  interests  during  an 

interlocutory appeal under Texas Rule 
of Civil Procedure 29.3.  

and 

procedures 

that  certain 

On February 18, 2022, the Texas 
attorney general issued an opinion let-
“‘sex 
ter  concluding 
change’ 
treat-
ments . . . when performed on children, 
can  legally  constitute  child  abuse  un-
der several provisions of chapter 261 of 
the Texas Family Code.” The governor 
then sent a letter to the Texas Depart-
ment of Family and Protective Service 
(DFPS)  stating  that  “a  number  of  so-
called  ‘sex  change’  procedures  consti-
tute  child  abuse  under  existing  Texas 
law”  and  instructed  “DFPS  and  all 
other state agencies” to “follow the law 
as explained in” the attorney general’s 
opinion.  DFPS  issued  a  media  state-
ment  that  it  would  follow  the  gover-
nor’s instructions.   

The parents of a child diagnosed 
with  gender  dysphoria  and  a  doctor 
who treats such children sued the gov-
ernor,  the  DFPS  commissioner,  and 
DFPS,  challenging  the  governor’s  and 
DFPS’s  statements.  The  district  court 
granted  plaintiffs  a  temporary  injunc-
tion  that  restrained  the  defendants 
from:  “(1) taking  any  actions  against 
plaintiffs  based  on  the  governor’s  and 
DFPS rule . . . as well as Attorney Gen-
eral  Paxton’s  opinion;”  “(2) investigat-
ing reports in the state of Texas against 
any and all persons based solely on al-
leged  child  abuse . . . where  the  only 
grounds for the purported abuse or ne-
glect are either the facilitation or pro-
vision  of  gender-affirming  medical 
treatment  or  the  fact  that  the  minors 
are transgender, gender transitioning, 
or receiving or being prescribed gender-
treatment;” 
affirming 
medical 
for 
“(3) prosecuting 

referring 

or 

30 
 

prosecution such reports;” and “(4) im-
posing  reporting  requirements  on  per-
sons  in  the  state  of  Texas  who  are 
aware  of  others  who  facilitate”  the 
above actions.   

The  state  filed  an  interlocutory 
appeal,  which  automatically  super-
seded  the  district  court’s  injunction. 
The court of appeals reinstated the in-
junction  under  its  authority  in  Texas 
Rule  of  Appellate  Procedure  29.3  to 
“make any temporary orders necessary 
to preserve the parties’ rights until dis-
position of the appeal.” The state peti-
tioned  the  Supreme  Court  for  manda-
mus relief from the injunction. 

The Supreme Court granted par-
tial relief.  The Court first clarified that 
neither  the  governor  nor  the  attorney 
general  could  bind  DFPS’s  investiga-
tory authority. The Court granted man-
damus relief as to the parts of the court 
of appeals’ order that purported to bind 
nonparties,  reasoning  such  an  injunc-
tion was outside of the court of appeals’ 
authority to protect parties’ rights un-
der  rule  29.3.  The  Court  also  granted 
mandamus relief as to the parts of the 
court of appeals’ order binding the gov-
ernor,  as  the  governor  does  not  have 
authority  to  investigate,  prosecute,  or 
impose reporting requirements regard-
ing child abuse allegations. Lastly, the 
Court  denied  the  state  relief  as  to  the 
order’s impact on the plaintiffs. 

Justice Lehrmann filed a concur-
ring  opinion.  The  concurrence  high-
lighted the narrow scope of the Court’s 
partial grant of mandamus relief, par-
ticularly its lack of effect on the merits 
of the underlying suit. The concurrence 
also viewed the scope of the court of ap-
peals’ order as narrower than the state 
presented. The concurrence viewed the 

injunction as returning DFPS’s investi-
gative policies to the status quo, which 
the  concurrence  reasoned  implicated 
whether  the  state  indeed  has  an  ade-
quate remedy by appeal. 

Justice Blacklock filed a partially 
dissenting  opinion,  in  which  Justice 
Boyd  and  Justice  Devine  joined.  The 
partial dissent would have granted the 
state mandamus relief as to the part of 
the  court  of  appeals’  order  regarding 
the  plaintiffs.  The  dissent  reasoned 
that the plaintiffs did not establish that 
they  were  entitled  to  an  injunction 
against  DFPS beginning  an investiga-
tion of potential child abuse. According 
to  the  dissent,  the  proper  time  for 
courts to review DFPS’s actions is after 
the  investigation  stage  when  DFPS 
tries to act based on the investigation. 
 

 Jurisdiction,  Post-divorce 

Property Division 

a)  S.C. v. M.B., 650 S.W.3d 428 
(Tex.  June  17,  2022)  [20-
0552] 

After a divorce decree fails to di-
vide  all  community  property,  does  a 
district  court  other  than  the  divorcing 
court  have  subject-matter  jurisdiction 
to  divide  the  undivided  property?  The 
Supreme Court answered yes.  

S.C.  and  M.B.  divorced.  Part  of 
that  divorce  process  included  dividing 
up their community property—a prop-
erty classification that can only exist in 
marriage. To do so, S.C. prepared an in-
ventory, which later became part of the 
divorce decree. Some parts of the com-
munity  estate  were  left  off  the  inven-
tory and remained undivided.  

The  Family  Code  provides  the 
opportunity for either spouse to seek a 
just-and-right  division  of  property  not 

31 
 

divided  in  a  divorce.  M.B.  did  not  use 
this  remedy.  Instead,  she  sued  under 
the  Property  Code  in  a  different court 
from  the  divorcing  court.  S.C.  filed  a 
plea  to  the  jurisdiction  claiming  that 
only  the  Family  Code  remedy  was 
available  and  that  only  the  divorcing 
court  had  subject-matter  jurisdiction 
over  that  remedy.  The  trial  court 
granted  the  plea,  but  also  certified  a 
permissive  appeal,  which  the  court  of 
appeals accepted. The court of appeals 
reversed.  

The  Texas  Supreme  Court 
granted  S.C.’s  petition  for  review,  af-
firmed the court of appeals’ judgment, 
and  remanded  the  case  to  the  trial 
court. The Court held that the Family 
Code  divest  district  courts  other  than 
the  divorcing  court  of  subject-matter 
jurisdiction.  Looking  to  the  Family 
Code as a whole, the Court noted that 
it is full of references to exclusive juris-
diction, while the section at issue here 
is silent to jurisdiction. The Court also 
noted,  while  “shall”  was  mandatory 
language,  it  only  mandates  that  the 
just-and-right  standard  must  be  ap-
plied if properly invoked.   

Justice  Bland  filed  a  dissenting 
opinion, in which Justice Boyd and Jus-
tice  Busby  joined.  The  dissenting  jus-
tices  would  hold  that  the  plain  lan-
guage of the statute requires the court 
that adjudicated the parties’ initial di-
vorce  to  hear  any  subsequent  claim 
that  the  final  divorce  decree  failed  to 
divide  property  that  was  part  of  the 
community estate. Accordingly, the dis-
sent would hold that the trial court in 
this case properly granted the jurisdic-
tional plea because the claim alleged is 
one for undivided marital property sub-
sequent to a final divorce decree, and it 

was  not  the  district  court  that  adjudi-
cated the parties’ divorce. Further, the 
dissent would hold that the court of ap-
peals  lacked  jurisdiction  to  hear  this 
permissive appeal because the permis-
sive  appeal  statute  excludes  cases 
brought under the Family Code. 
 

 Termination  of  Parental 

Rights 

a)  In  the  Interest  of  A.L.R.,  a 
Child,  646  S.W.3d  833  (Tex. 
June 17, 2022) [21-0658] 

At 

issue 

in  this  case  was 
whether a father’s court-ordered family 
service  plan  was  sufficiently  specific 
under  Section  161.001(b)(1)(O)  of  the 
Family  Code  to  support  the  termina-
tion of his parental rights. 

The  trial  court  terminated  the 
father’s  parental  rights  to  his  daugh-
ter, finding by clear and convincing ev-
idence  that  he  had  failed  to  comply 
with his court-ordered service plan and 
that  he  had  engaged  in  criminal  con-
duct that resulted in his incarceration 
for more than two years. The father ap-
pealed, arguing that his service plan—
which phrased tasks as requests—was 
insufficiently specific to support termi-
nation  under  subsection  (O).  He  also 
argued that there was insufficient evi-
dence  that  he  would  remain  incarcer-
ated for at least two years. The court of 
appeals affirmed the trial court’s order, 
holding  that  sufficient  evidence  sup-
ported  termination  of  the  father’s  pa-
rental rights under Subsection (O). The 
court  of  appeals  did  not  reach  the  fa-
ther’s  argument  regarding  Subsection 
(Q). 

The  Supreme  Court  reversed, 
holding  that  the  service  plan  was  too 
ambiguous  to  support  termination  of 

32 
 

the father’s parental rights under Sub-
section  (O).  The  service  plan’s  tasks 
were worded as requests, which do not 
connote a mandatory requirement. Alt-
hough  the  plan’s  “goals”  were  worded 
as positive mandates, the service plan 
could be interpreted  as merely requir-
ing  that  the  parent  provide  the  child 
with  a  safe  environment,  with  the 
plan’s requested tasks only guiding the 
parent  toward  that  requirement.  The 
Court  observed  that  while  a  parent’s 
engagement  with  the  terms  of  an  am-
biguous service plan may show the par-
ent’s  understanding  of  the  terms,  it 
does not, without more, show a parent’s 
understanding  that  completion  of  spe-
cific tasks is mandatory. 

The Court remanded the case to 
the court of appeals for consideration of 
the trial court order on Subsection (Q).  
 

b)  In re C.L.E.E.G., a Child, 639 
S.W.3d  696  (Tex.  Feb.  4, 
2022) (per curiam) [21-0245] 
 
The issue presented in this case 
was whether the record contained suf-
ficient  evidence  to  support  the  trial 
court’s  finding  that  Father  would  not 
receive parole from his prison sentence 
and  would  be  unable  to  care  for  the 
Child for at least two years. 
 
The  Department  of  Family  and 
Protective Services placed the Child in 
foster care after she tested positive for 
methamphetamines at birth. When the 
Child  was  six  months  old,  Father  was 
imprisoned after pleading guilty to four 
felony charges, including possession of 
a  controlled  substance  with  intent  to 
deliver and felon in possession of a fire-
arm.  He  received  concurrent  seven-
year 
sentences.  The  Department 
moved  to  terminate  Father’s  parental 

appeals  substituted  its  judgment  for 
that of the trial court, which could rea-
sonably have found that Father would 
not be paroled. And given Father’s tes-
timony that he had no family members 
he  would  want  the  Child  placed  with 
during  his  incarceration,  and  his  fail-
ure  to  provide  any  names  to  the  De-
partment  for  background  checks,  the 
trial court could reasonably have found 
he was unable to care for the Child dur-
ing his imprisonment. Thus, sufficient 
evidence  existed  to  support  the  trial 
court’s  termination  of  his  parental 
rights under subsection (Q). 

)  In  re  J.W.,  645  S.W.3d  726 
(Tex. May 27, 2022) [19-1069] 
In  this  case,  Father  challenges 
the legal sufficiency of the evidence to 
support  the  jury’s  finding  that  his  pa-
rental  rights  should  be  terminated  as 
well as the trial court’s submission of a 
broad-form termination question to the 
jury.  

J.W. was born with drugs in his 
system, including opiates and amphet-
amines, some of which originated with 
Mother’s  abuse  of  codeine-containing 
medication  while  pregnant.  The  De-
partment of Family and Protective Ser-
vices  removed  J.W.  from  his  parents 
and  placed  him  in  foster  care.  After  a 
five-day jury trial, the jury found that 
both  parents’  rights  should  be  termi-
nated, and the trial court rendered a fi-
nal order of termination. As to Father, 
the jury found that “at least one” of the 
statutory  termination  grounds  con-
tained  in  Texas  Family  Code  Sections 
161.001(b)(1)(D)  (endangering  condi-
tions  or  surroundings),  (E)  (endanger-
ing conduct), and (O) (failure to comply 
with  service  plan  after  removal  for 

  c

rights  under  Texas  Family  Code  Sec-
tion 161.001(b)(1)(Q), which allows for 
termination with clear and convincing 
evidence the parent will be imprisoned 
and  unable to  care  for  the  child  for  at 
least  two  years.  The trial  court  termi-
nated Father’s parental rights, and he 
appealed, arguing the evidence was le-
gally and factually insufficient to sup-
port the trial court’s findings. The court 
of  appeals  reversed,  concluding  that 
Father  presented  testimony  he  would 
be  paroled  in  the  near  future  and  the 
Department  failed  to  refute  that  evi-
dence. 

The Court reversed in a per cu-
riam  opinion  and  reinstated  the  trial 
court’s  judgment  terminating  Father’s 
parental  rights.  Although  evidence  of 
the  availability  of  parole  is  relevant 
when  considering  termination  under 
subsection (Q), the factfinder is free to 
assess  the  demeanor  of  witnesses  and 
disregard a parent’s parole-related tes-
timony, especially when it amounts to 
mere conjecture. Looking to the record, 
the Court concluded that sufficient evi-
dence  supported  the  trial  court’s  find-
ing that Father would be ineligible for 
parole  within  two  years.  Father  testi-
fied he “knew for a fact” he would not 
serve  the  full  seven  years  because  he 
had  enrolled  in  a  gang-disassociation 
program,  was  studying  to  obtain  his 
GED,  and  had  good  behavior,  and  be-
cause  the  COVID-19  pandemic  could 
also increase his chance of parole. Con-
tradicting  this  testimony,  Father  con-
ceded that the parole board would con-
sider  his  lifelong  criminal  history  and 
multiple convictions, that he had previ-
ously  had  his  community  supervision 
revoked, and that he had already been 
denied  parole  once.  The  court  of 

33 
 

abuse or neglect) were established and 
that termination was in J.W.’s best in-
terest. The court of appeals affirmed as 
to both parents. Only Father petitioned 
for review. 

The  Supreme  Court  reversed 
and remanded for a new trial. First, the 
Court  held  that  legally  sufficient  evi-
dence  supported  the  Subsection  (O) 
ground  because  the  jury  reasonably 
could have concluded based on the evi-
dence that Father failed to maintain a 
safe  and  stable  home  environment,  as 
the service plan required. Much of the 
same evidence also supported the jury’s 
best-interest finding.  

The  Court  went  on  to  hold  that 
legally insufficient evidence supported 
the Subsection (D) termination ground. 
The Court explained that, as a general 
matter,  the  relevant  time  frame  for 
evaluating  this  ground  is  before  a 
child’s  removal.  Because  J.W.  was  re-
moved  almost  immediately  after  he 
was born and his parents had only su-
pervised  visits  with  him  until  trial, 
only Father’s role with respect to J.W.’s 
“environment”  before  he  was  born  is 
relevant to Subsection (D). And while a 
parent’s  knowledge  of  the  other  par-
ent’s  drug  use  during  pregnancy  and 
corresponding failure to attempt to pro-
tect the unborn child from the effects of 
that drug use can contribute to an en-
dangering  environment  and  thus  sup-
port an endangerment finding, Father 
did  not  fail  to  make  such  an  attempt 
here.  

Because  legally  insufficient  evi-
dence supported one of the termination 
grounds,  which  was  improperly  sub-
mitted  to  the  jury  as  part  of  a  broad-
form  termination  question  that  com-
mingled valid and invalid grounds, the 

34 
 

Court held that the error  prevented it 
from  determining  whether  the  jury 
based its verdict on the invalid ground. 
Accordingly, the Court remanded for a 
new trial on termination of Father’s pa-
rental rights.  

Justice Young filed a concurring 
opinion emphasizing that Father must 
be  judged  by  his  own  actions,  not 
Mother’s,  and  that  neither  the  Court 
nor the Department contends that Fa-
ther  had  an  obligation  to  divorce 
Mother to maintain his parental rights. 
Rather,  Father  presented  the  divorce 
as evidence that he was addressing the 
risk Mother posed to J.W., and the evi-
dence that the divorce was not genuine 
called that claim into question. 

Justice Boyd dissented, agreeing 
with  the  court  of  appeals  that  legally 
sufficient  evidence  supports  all  three 
termination grounds as well as best in-
terest.  Justice  Boyd  thus  would  have 
affirmed the court of appeals’ judgment 
affirming  the  termination  of  Father’s 
parental rights.  

Justice Blacklock, joined by Jus-
tice Devine and Justice Busby, also dis-
sented, opining that none of the termi-
nation  grounds  were  supported  by  le-
gally sufficient evidence and that judg-
ment  should  be  rendered  reinstating 
Father’s parental rights.  
 

d)  In re of M.P., 639 S.W.3d 700 
(Tex.  Feb.  4,  2022)  (per  cu-
riam) [21-0360] 

 
The issue in this parental termi-
nation case was whether the appellate 
court  should  remand  for  a  new  trial 
when it affirms on one ground for ter-
reverses  on  other 
mination  but 
grounds. The trial court terminated the 
parental  rights  of  Father  on  several 

grounds  under  Section  161.001(b)  of 
the Family Code. The grounds included 
failure  to  comply with  a  court-ordered 
service  plan  (subsection  O),  endanger-
ing  conditions  (subsection  D),  and  en-
dangering conduct (subsection E). The 
court of appeals affirmed under (O) but 
concluded that the evidence was factu-
ally insufficient to support termination 
under (D) and (E). The court of appeals 
was  required  to  review  the  sufficiency 
of the evidence under (D) and (E), even 
though it could affirm the termination 
of  parental  rights  under  (O),  because 
the Supreme Court had held that such 
review  is  required.  In  re  N.G.,  577 
S.W.3d  230  (Tex.  2019).    Due  process 
concerns  require  such  review  because 
termination  under  (D)  and  (E)  can  af-
fect  parental  rights  as  to  other  chil-
dren. 
The  court  of  appeals,  after  con-
 
cluding that the evidence was factually 
insufficient  under  (D)  and  (E),  re-
manded the case to the trial court for a 
new  trial  on  those  grounds.  The  Su-
preme  Court  reversed  the  part  of  the 
court  of  appeals’  judgment  remanding 
the case. The Supreme Court held that 
in these circumstances, the court of ap-
peals should dispose of the case by af-
firming the termination under (O) and 
striking the (D) and (E) findings. A re-
mand  was  inappropriate  because  it 
would delay the proceedings and could 
not change the result that Father’s pa-
rental  rights  were  terminated  on 
ground (O). Accordingly, the Court re-
versed the part of the court of appeals’ 
judgment remanding the case for a new 
trial  and  rendered  judgment  striking 
the trial court’s findings on grounds (D) 
and (E).

 Chapter 2400 
a)  Von Dohlen v. City of San An-
tonio,  643  S.W.3d  387  (Tex. 
Apr. 1, 2022) [20-0725] 

The issue in this case is whether 
individuals suing the City of San Anto-
nio  for  excluding  Chick-fil-A  from  the 
San  Antonio  airport  on  account  of 
Chick-fil-A’s  contributions  to  various 
religious  organizations  pleaded  suffi-
cient facts to invoke a statutory waiver 
of governmental immunity.  

At  a  March  2019  meeting,  two 
members  of  the  San  Antonio  City 
Council  expressed  concerns  about 
Chick-fil-A’s  inclusion  in  a  proposed 
concession agreement for the San Anto-
nio  airport,  citing  Chick-fil-A’s  history 
of  funding  anti-LGBTQ  organizations. 
The city council ultimately voted in fa-
vor  of  amending  the concession  agree-
ment  to  replace  Chick-fil-A  with  an-
other vendor. After the vote, the Texas 
Legislature  passed  Senate  Bill  1978, 
which created Chapter 2400 of the Gov-
ernment Code. The statute prohibits a 
governmental  entity  from  taking  any 
adverse  action  against  a  person  based 
wholly or partly on the person’s contri-
butions to religious organizations.  

Following  Chapter  2400’s  effec-
tive date, five citizens residing in coun-
ties  near  the  airport  sued  the  city  in 
state district court. The citizens alleged 
that  the  city’s  continued  exclusion  of 
Chick-fil-A based on its donations to re-
ligious  organizations  violated  Chapter 
2400.  The  citizens  requested  declara-
tory  and  injunctive  relief,  plus  costs 
and attorney’s fees. The city sought dis-
missal based on governmental immun-
ity  and  lack  of  standing.  After  a 

hearing, the trial court denied the city’s 
jurisdictional  challenges,  and  the  city 
appealed. The court of appeals reversed 
and rendered judgment dismissing the 
case for lack of jurisdiction.  

The  court  of  appeals  reasoned 
that, although the citizens purported to 
be  seeking  only  prospective  relief,  the 
only  plausible  remedy  for  their  claims 
was  invalidation  of  the  previously  en-
acted concession agreement. Thus, the 
court of appeals concluded that the cit-
izens’  claims  were  barred  by  govern-
mental immunity. The court of appeals 
did not address standing.  

under 

action” 

The Supreme Court reversed the 
court  of  appeals’  judgment  dismissing 
the case for lack of jurisdiction and re-
manded the case to the trial court. The 
Court held that the citizens failed to al-
lege sufficient facts to invoke a waiver 
of immunity because their petition did 
not point to any specific action taken by 
the  city  on  or  after  Chapter  2400’s  ef-
fective  date  that  could  constitute  an 
“adverse 
Section 
2400.002.  The  Court  rejected  the  citi-
zens’ argument that their mere allega-
tion  that  the  city  is  taking  actions  to 
implement the agreement approved by 
the city council is sufficient to invoke a 
waiver  of  immunity  because  the  citi-
zens did not describe any of the actions 
related to the agreement’s implementa-
tion.  But  the  Court  further  held  that 
because the citizens’ petition did not af-
firmatively  negate  the  existence  of  ju-
risdiction, they should be given the op-
portunity  to  replead.  The  Court  con-
cluded  that  standing  should  be  deter-
mined based on the parties’ live plead-
ing, so it would be premature to weigh 
in on the city’s standing arguments be-
fore the citizens repleaded. 

36 
 

Justice  Blacklock  concurred  in 
the judgment, joined by Justice Devine. 
The concurrence would have held that 
the  citizens’  petition  sufficiently  in-
voked a waiver of immunity because it 
credibly alleged that the exclusionary, 
discriminatory effects of the city coun-
cil’s vote would continue to be felt after 
Chapter 2400’s effective date. The con-
currence  reasoned  that,  based  on  the 
record,  the  city  was  not  entitled  to  a 
presumption that it would comply with 
Chapter 2400 after its effective date. 
 

 Official Immunity 
a)  City of San Antonio v. Riojas, 
640 S.W.3d 534 (Tex. Feb. 18, 
2022) [20-0293] 

At  issue  in  this  case  is  what  a 
governmental defendant must show to 
law-enforcement-of-
demonstrate  a 
ficer’s good faith for purposes of estab-
lishing  the  officer’s  official  immunity 
from  suit  when  the  plaintiff’s  injuries 
occurred in the context of routine traf-
fic management. 

While  driving  on  an  interstate 
highway,  San  Antonio  police  officer 
Tristan activated his emergency lights 
to  warn  approaching  motorists  of  a 
traffic slowdown ahead. Behind Officer 
Tristan  and  three  lanes  to  the  left  of 
him,  plaintiff  Riojas  wrecked  his  mo-
torcycle  after  the  car  in  front  of  him 
stopped abruptly. Riojas sued the City, 
claiming  that  Officer  Tristan  acted 
negligently  by  turning  on  his  emer-
gency lights and that the lights caused 
Riojas’ accident. 

The City filed a plea to the juris-
diction, arguing that its governmental 
immunity  from  suit  had  not  been 
waived.  Riojas  argued  that  the  City’s 
immunity  was  waived  by  Section 

101.021(1)  of  the  Texas  Tort  Claims 
Act.  A  main  issue  in  the  case  was 
whether Officer Tristan “would be per-
sonally  liable”  to  Riojas  under  Section 
101.021(1)(B)  or  whether  his  actions 
were protected by official immunity. In 
order for the doctrine of official immun-
ity  to  apply,  the  City  was  required  to 
prove that Officer Tristan was acting in 
good faith when he turned on his emer-
gency lights. The trial court denied the 
City’s plea, and the court of appeals af-
firmed. 

The  court  of  appeals  reasoned 
that  under  Wadewitz  v.  Montgomery, 
951 S.W.2d 464 (Tex. 1997), in order to 
prove  Officer  Tristan’s  good  faith,  the 
City was required to show that Officer 
Tristan  balanced  the  need  for  action 
against the potential risks of taking it 
before activating his emergency lights. 
The  court  then  concluded  that  Officer 
Tristan’s  affidavit  failed  to  meet  the 
Wadewitz need-risk balancing test. 
The Supreme Court held that the court 
of  appeals  applied  the  wrong  test. 
Wadewitz and other cases applying the 
need-risk balancing test had involved a 
high-speed pursuit or some other emer-
gency action carrying an inherent risk 
of  harm  to  the  public.  The  Court  ex-
plained  that  it  had  expressly  limited 
the need-risk-balancing requirement to 
the  emergency-response  context  and 
held  that  when  a  routine  law-enforce-
ment  activity  is  at  issue,  the  govern-
mental  defendant  is  only  required  to 
show that a reasonably prudent officer 
faced  with  the  same  circumstances 
could  have  believed  his  conduct  was 
justified. Officer Tristan’s affidavit met 
that  test,  and  Riojas  did  not  present 
any  conflicting  evidence.  Accordingly, 
the Court reversed the judgment of the 

37 
 

court  of  appeals  and  dismissed  Riojas’ 
claims against the City for lack of juris-
diction. 
 

 Texas Tort Claims Act 
a)  Christ  v.  Tex.  Dep’t  of 
Transp.,  ___  S.W.3d  ___, 
2023 WL 1871560 (Tex. Feb. 
10, 2023) [21-0728] 

The issue in this case is whether 
the  Tort  Claims  Act  waives  immunity 
for a premises-defect claim based on a 
commonly occurring condition. 

Daniel Christ and his wife were 
riding their motorcycle through a con-
struction zone when they collided head-
on with a vehicle that crossed into their 
lane. The Texas Department of Trans-
portation  prepared  the  construction 
project’s  traffic  control  plan,  which 
called  for  the  placement  of  concrete 
barriers between the opposing lanes of 
traffic.  The  contractor  instead  placed 
yellow  stripes  and  buttons,  acting  on 
TxDOT’s purported oral approval. The 
Christs  sued  TxDOT,  alleging  negli-
gence based on a premises defect.   

TxDOT filed a plea to the juris-
diction  and  no-evidence  motion  for 
summary judgment. It argued the Tort 
Claims Act did not waive its sovereign 
immunity because the Christs failed to 
raise a fact issue on their premises-de-
fect  claim  and  because  TxDOT’s  road-
way-design  decisions  were  discretion-
ary.  The  trial  court  denied  TxDOT’s 
plea and motion, and TxDOT appealed. 
The court of appeals reversed, holding 
that TxDOT retained its immunity be-
cause it had discretion to orally modify 
the traffic control plan. The Christs pe-
titioned the Supreme Court for review. 
The  Court  affirmed  on  different 
grounds.  The  Court  held  that  the 

liability  should  be  capped  at  $100,000 
because Curry failed to establish that a 
higher cap applies or, alternatively, the 
evidence  conclusively  established  that 
Gulf Coast was subject to the $100,000 
cap.  The  court  of  appeals  affirmed.  It 
concluded  that  the  Tort  Claims  Act’s 
damages  caps  are  an  affirmative  de-
fense and Gulf Coast had the burden ei-
ther to obtain a jury finding or to pre-
sent  conclusive  evidence  at  trial  that 
the lower cap applied. Gulf Coast peti-
tioned the Supreme Court for review. 

The Supreme Court reversed. It 
held  that  the  Tort  Claims  Act’s  dam-
ages  caps  are  incorporated  into  the 
Act’s waiver of immunity from suit, so 
a  governmental  unit  retains  its  im-
munity from suit as to a claim that ex-
ceeds  the  applicable  cap.  The  Court 
concluded that, as part of the plaintiff’s 
burden  to  affirmatively  demonstrate 
the trial court’s jurisdiction, the plain-
tiff  has  the  burden  to  establish  which 
cap  applies.  The  Act’s  higher  cap 
($250,000)  applies  only  to  “the  state 
government”  or  “a  municipality,”  and 
the  Court  determined  that  Curry  did 
not plead or prove that Gulf Coast was 
either. As a result, he failed to satisfy 
his  burden  that  Gulf Coast  waived its 
the 
immunity 
$100,000 cap. The Court independently 
held  that  the  uncontroverted  evidence 
established that Gulf Coast was a com-
munity  center  under  Chapter  534  of 
the Health and Safety Code and there-
fore  subject  to  the  Tort  Claims  Act’s 
$100,000  cap.  The  Court  concluded 
that the trial court should have consid-
ered  evidence  presented  after  trial  re-
garding the applicable damages cap. 
 

from  suit  beyond 

Christs  failed  to  raise  a  fact  issue  on 
whether a condition of the roadway was 
unreasonably  dangerous.  In  the  trial 
court, the Christs argued the construc-
tion zone was unreasonably dangerous 
solely due to the substitution of stripes 
and buttons for concrete barriers. The 
Christs presented no evidence that the 
use  of  stripes  and  buttons  to  separate 
travel  lanes,  a  common  condition  on 
roadways, was measurably more likely 
to  cause  injury  in  this  case.  Nor  did 
they  present  evidence  of  any  com-
plaints  or  reports  of  injuries  from  the 
use of stripes and buttons. Because the 
Christs did not raise a fact issue as to 
the  existence  of  an  unreasonably  dan-
gerous condition, an essential element 
of  their  premises-defect  claim,  they 
failed to establish a waiver of TxDOT’s 
immunity under the Tort Claims Act. 

)  Gulf Coast Ctr. v. Curry, 658 
S.W.3d  281  (Tex.  Dec.  30, 
2022) [20-0856] 

The issue in this case is whether 
the Texas Tort Claims Act’s caps on the 
amount of a governmental unit’s liabil-
ity  implicate  the  trial  court’s  jurisdic-
tion  so  the  plaintiff  has  the  burden  to 
prove which cap applies. 

Daniel  Curry  was  struck  by  a 
bus driven by an employee of The Gulf 
Coast Center, a governmental unit that 
provides intellectual-disability services 
in  Galveston  and  Brazoria  Counties. 
Curry sued Gulf Coast under the Tort 
Claims Act, which caps the amount of a 
defendant’s  liability  based  on  what 
type  of  governmental  unit  the  defend-
ant is. Following a jury trial, the trial 
court rendered judgment for Curry that 
included  $216,000  in  damages.  Gulf

S.W.3d  723  (Tex.  Sept.  16, 
2022) (per curiam) [21-0606]  
In this personal injury case, the 
City  of  Tyler  argued  that  Leondra 
Leach  failed  to  establish  that  he  gave 
the City proper notice as required un-
der the Texas Torts Claims Act and the 
city charter.  

Leach  alleges  that  he  was  in-
jured while he was working for his em-
ployer  after  an  improperly  secured 
piece  of  wood  flew  off  the  City’s  truck 
and  hit  him  in  the  head.  Under  the 
Texas  Torts  Claims  Act,  a  party  must 
provide  timely  notice  to  the  govern-
mental entity; failure to do so deprives 
the  trial  court  of  jurisdiction  over  the 
claim.  The  City  of  Tyler’s  charter  re-
quires  notice  of  tort  claims  within 
thirty days. The City has promulgated 
a “Claims Notice” form that a claimant 
may  submit  to  comply  with  the  city 
charter's  requirement.  Leach’s  em-
ployer  completed  and  filed  that  form 
seven days after the incident. The em-
ployer  told  Leach  that  it  would  file  a 
single  notice  both  for  itself  and  for 
Leach,  so  Leach  himself  filed  nothing 
with the City during the thirty-day pe-
riod that the city charter allows. 

 The  court  of  appeals  concluded 
that  the  notice  provided  was  inade-
quate  under the  Tort  Claims  Act  and 
did  not  separately  examine  whether 
the  notice  met  the  city  charter's  re-
quirements.  

The Supreme Court reversed. It 
held that the information on the claims 
notice was sufficient to establish notice 
under  the  city  charter  and  that  the 
lower courts therefore erred in conclud-
ing that the district court lacked juris-
claim.  The 
diction  over  Leach’s

Supreme Court therefore reversed and 
remanded for further proceedings. 
 

d)  Maspero v. City of San Anto-
nio,  640  S.W.3d  523  (Tex. 
Feb. 18, 2022) [19-1144] 
At  issue  in  this  case is  whether 
the City of San Antonio’s governmental 
immunity  is  waived  under  the  Texas 
Torts  Claims  Act  for  a  police  officer’s 
use or operation of a patrol car while in 
pursuit  of  a  fleeing  suspect.  In  2012, 
Kimberly Kory, a San Antonio police of-
ficer, was participating in an investiga-
tion of a drug-trafficking operation and 
was  in  vehicular  pursuit  of  a  fleeing 
suspect,  David  Rodriguez.  In  his  at-
tempt  to  evade  apprehension,  Mr.  Ro-
driguez’s vehicle collided with the Mas-
peros’  vehicle,  resulting  in  the  Mas-
peros’ injuries and the death of two of 
their children. The Masperos sued the 
City,  asserting  Section  101.021  of  the 
Tort  Claims  Act  waived  the  City’s  im-
munity  because  their  injuries  arose 
from Officer Kory’s operation or use of 
a motor-driven vehicle. In response, the 
City  filed  a  plea  to  the  jurisdiction, 
claiming  the  Masperos’  injuries  were 
too attenuated from the officer’s use of 
a  motor  vehicle  to  trigger  Section 
101.021 and that in any event, Section 
101.055,  the  Act’s  emergency  excep-
tion,  rendered  the  Act  inapplicable  to 
the  Masperos’  claims.  The  trial  court 
granted the City’s plea, and the court of 
appeals  reversed,  holding  the  Act 
waived the City’s immunity. 

The  Supreme  Court  reversed, 
holding  that  the  Act’s  emergency  ex-
ception applied as a matter of law. Un-
der  Section  101.055,  the  Tort  Claims 
Act  does  not  apply  to—and  thus  does 
not  waive  immunity  from—a  claim 

arising from an employee’s action while 
reacting to an emergency situation (1) 
if the action complied with the laws and 
ordinances applicable to emergency ac-
tion or (2) in the absence of such a law 
or ordinance if the action was not reck-
less.  It  was  undisputed  that  Officer 
Kory was reacting to an emergency sit-
uation.  The  Court  held  that  Officer 
Kory’s  alleged  failure  to  comply  with 
internal  department  policies  did  not 
equate to a failure to comply with “laws 
and  ordinances”  and  that  her  alleged 
failure  to  use  her  siren  at  the  time  of 
the collision neither violated the Trans-
portation Code nor had a causal nexus 
to  the  Masperos’  injuries.  The  Court 
further  held  that  the  Masperos  had 
failed to raise a fact issue that Officer 
Kory acted with conscious indifference 
or  reckless  disregard  for  the  safety  of 
others during the pursuit. Because Sec-
tion 101.055 foreclosed the Act’s appli-
cation,  the  Court  did  not  address 
whether  Section  101.021  would  other-
wise have waived the City’s immunity. 
Finally, the Court rejected the court of 
appeals’  holding  that  an  independent, 
common-law  ground  existed  to  waive 
the  City’s  immunity  on  the  Masperos’ 
claim  for  negligent  implementation  of 
policy.  Because  the  City  is  immune 
from suit, the Court dismissed the case 
for lack of jurisdiction. 
 

 Texas Whistleblower Act 
a)  City of Fort Worth v. Pridgen, 
653 S.W.3d 176 (Tex. May 27, 
2022) [20-0700] 

This case concerns the proper in-
terpretation of “good faith report[] [of] 
a  violation  of  law”  under  the  Texas 
Whistleblower Act. 

Abdul Pridgen and Vance Keyes 

40 
 

were  veteran  law  enforcement  officers 
employed by the Fort Worth Police De-
partment. Both supervised the Depart-
ment’s Internal Affairs and Special In-
vestigations Units, which are responsi-
ble  for  investigating  allegations  of  po-
lice misconduct. In December 2016, the 
Department  received  national  atten-
tion when a video depicting Officer Wil-
liam  Martin’s  forceful  arrest  of  a 
woman  and  her  daughter  went  viral. 
Pridgen and Keyes helped lead the De-
partment’s subsequent investigation of 
the  incident.  The  investigation  con-
cluded  that  Martin  committed  several 
criminal  violations  and  should  be  ter-
minated.  Pridgen  and  Keyes  assert 
they reported these conclusions to their 
supervisor, Chief Fitzgerald, on multi-
ple occasions. Ultimately, Officer Mar-
tin was only suspended for ten days.  

Several  months  after  the  inci-
dent, Officer Martin’s previously undis-
closed  body  camera  video  and  other 
confidential  files  were  released  and 
posted on a public website and a Face-
book  page.  Chief  Fitzgerald  initiated 
an investigation into the source of the 
leak. Internal Affairs officers concluded 
that Pridgen had downloaded the files 
to  a  thumb  drive,  and  that  Keyes  had 
been  in  Pridgen’s  office  at  the  time  of 
the download. Pridgen and Keyes were 
subsequently  placed  on  detached  duty 
and demoted.  

Pridgen and Keyes sued the City 
pursuant to the Whistleblower Act, al-
leging  the  City  took  adverse  action 
against  them  in  response  to  their  re-
ports  of  Officer  Martin’s  alleged  viola-
tions of law. The trial court denied the 
City’s motions for summary judgment. 
The court of appeals affirmed. The City 
petitioned  for  review  in  the  Supreme 

Court, arguing that Pridgen and Keyes 
did not “report” under the Act because 
they  did  not  disclose  new  information 
and  that  they  made  their  “reports”  as 
part of their normal job duties. 

The  Supreme  Court  reversed. 
First,  the  Court  held  that  based  on 
common  dictionary  definitions  of  the 
term, to “report” under the Act, an em-
ployee must provide information as op-
posed to mere conclusions or opinions. 
A  public  employee  must  convey  infor-
mation  that  exposes  or  corroborates  a 
violation  of  law  or  otherwise  provide 
relevant,  additional  information  that 
will help identify or investigate illegal 
conduct.  The  Court  also  held  that  the 
Act’s  “good  faith”  limitation  applies  to 
the “report” requirement.  

The Court rejected the City’s ar-
gument that to “report” under the Act, 
an employee must “disclose” new infor-
mation.  It  reasoned  that  though  dis-
closing new information regarding ille-
gal conduct may qualify as “report[ing] 
a  violation  of  law,”  the  Act  protects 
other types of communications, such as 
corroborative  reports.  The  Court  like-
wise rejected the City’s argument that 
employees do not “report[] a violation of 
law”  under  the  Act  when  they  convey 
information as part of their job duties. 
It  reasoned  that  such  a  limitation 
might preclude the Act from protecting 
public  employees  in  positions  where 
they are best equipped to convey infor-
mation  regarding  government  illegal-
ity.  

Applying  these  principles,  the 
Court  determined  that  Pridgen  and 
Keyes had failed to “report” under the 
Act.  First,  the  Court  concluded  that 
Pridgen’s  and  Keyes’s  “reports”  were 
exposing, 
not 

toward 

geared 

41 
 

corroborating,  or  otherwise  providing 
information pertinent to identifying or 
investigating  governmental  illegality. 
It noted that Pridgen and Keyes did not 
“report”  any  new  information  to  Chief 
Fitzgerald. Additionally, since Pridgen 
and  Keyes  and  Chief  Fitzgerald  re-
viewed the same sources, Pridgen and 
Keyes  did  not  “corroborate”  any  facts 
that  were  unverified  or  subject  to  dis-
pute.  The  Court  concluded  that  Prid-
gen’s and Keyes’s testimony merely ev-
idenced  an  intent  to  persuade  Chief 
Fitzgerald  to  classify  Officer  Martin’s 
known actions as criminal conduct and 
to  terminate  his  employment.  These 
recommendations amounted to conclu-
sions  and  opinions  that  do  not  trigger 
the  Act’s  protections.  Therefore,  the 
Act does not waive the City’s immunity 
from suit.  

Justice  Blacklock 

concurred. 
The  concurrence  agreed  with  the  ma-
jority  that  to  “report”  under  the  Act, 
employees  must  convey  information, 
not just conclusions, and that Pridgen’s 
and Keyes’s statements did not satisfy 
this requirement. However, he thought 
the  Court  erred  in  rejecting  the  City’s 
other proposed limitations. He also dis-
agreed  with  the  Court’s  discussion  of 
the  Act’s  purpose,  which  he  believed 
risked  opening  the  door  to  expansive 
readings of the Act that could jeopard-
ize  other  executive-branch  preroga-
tives, like hiring and firing employees.  
Justice Boyd dissented. The dis-
sent agreed with the majority that re-
ports  must  provide  information.  How-
ever, he argued that Pridgen and Keyes 
satisfied  this  requirement  because 
their  reports  included  factual  infor-
mation regarding conduct they reason-
ably  believed  constituted  violations  of 

law.  Therefore,  they  submitted  suffi-
cient evidence to show they “report[ed]” 
under the Act. 
 
 Tim Cole Act 
a)  Brown v. City of Houston, ___ 
S.W.3d 
2023  WL 
___, 
1486228  (Tex.  Feb.  3,  2023) 
[22-0256] 

At issue in this certified question 
is whether Tim Cole Act claimants may 
maintain a lawsuit after they have re-
ceived compensation from the State.  

Alfred  Dewayne  Brown  was 
wrongfully imprisoned for capital mur-
der.  After  his  release,  he  applied  for 
Tim  Cole  Act  compensation,  but  the 
Comptroller  denied  his  applications. 
Brown then sued the City of Houston, 
Harris  County,  and  various  city  law-
enforcement  officials  in  federal  court, 
alleging violations of his constitutional 
rights.  While  that  suit  was  pending, 
and  based  on  new  information  uncov-
ered during that litigation, a state dis-
trict  court  dismissed  the  charges 
against  Brown  on  the  ground  that  he 
was  actually  innocent.  The  Comptrol-
ler,  however,  denied  Brown’s  renewed 
request for Tim Cole Act compensation. 
The  Supreme  Court  granted  Brown’s 
petition  for  writ  of mandamus  and  di-
rected  the  Comptroller  to  compensate 
Brown.  

The  defendants  in  Brown’s  fed-
eral case then argued that his suit had 
to be dismissed under a provision in the 
Act  that  prohibits  a  person  receiving 
compensation  under  the  Act  from 
“bring[ing]  any  action  involving  the 
same  subject  matter . . . against  any 
governmental  unit  or  an  employee  of 
any  governmental  unit.”  The  district 
the 
and 
court 

granted 

agreed 

42 
 

defendants’ motion for summary judg-
ment.  Brown  appealed,  and  the  Fifth 
Circuit certified the following question 
to the Court: “Does Section 103.153(b) 
of the Tim Cole Act bar maintenance of 
a  lawsuit  involving  the  same  subject 
matter against any governmental units 
or employees that was filed before the 
claimant received compensation under 
that statute?” 

The  Court  answered  the  ques-
tion yes. In so holding, the Court prin-
cipally relied on the text and history of 
the  Tim  Cole  Act,  reasoning  that  the 
word  “bring”  in  Section 103.153(b)  en-
tails not only filing suit but also main-
taining one. The history of the Act, the 
Court explained, shows that the Legis-
lature intended to funnel all claims for 
compensation through the administra-
tive process, subject only to the poten-
tial  for  mandamus  relief  in  the  Su-
preme Court. The Court also observed 
that  this  understanding  of  the  text  is 
consistent  with  its  precedent,  which 
has 
Sec-
tion 103.153(b) to bar all claims once a 
claimant  receives  compensation.  Fi-
nally,  the  Court  noted,  it  would  inter-
pret the statute in a way that preserves 
immunity;  the  Legislature’s  willing-
ness  to  waive  sovereign  immunity  by 
providing  compensation  was  condi-
tioned on that compensation being the 
last  word  in  the  dispute  about  the 
wrongful imprisonment.

At 
whether 

governmental  immunity  protected  the 
Commissioners’  determination  of  con-
formity. The Court explained that gov-
ernmental  immunity  for  the  Commis-
sioners had not been waived by statute, 
and the Association’s claim did not fall 
within the ultra vires exception to gov-
ernmental  immunity.  First,  there  was 
no ministerial duty under state law to 
deny a nonconforming plat. Next, there 
was no clear abuse of discretion by the 
Commissioners.  The  UDC  required  a 
determination  of  conformity  by  the 
Commissioners,  and  listed  items  for 
the Commissioners to consider in mak-
ing their determination. The Court con-
cluded that, so long as the Commission-
ers fully consider the proper materials, 
the duty to interpret the UDC had been 
committed  to  the  Commissioners’  dis-
cretion.  Since  the  record  showed  that 
the  Commissioners  considered  the 
proper  items,  the  Association’s  chal-
lenge to a discretionary decision made 
within  the  Commissioners’  authority 
was barred by governmental immunity 
and must be dismissed. Since the Court 
resolved the case on governmental im-
munity  grounds,  it  did  not  reach 
whether  the  Association  had  standing 
to challenge the plat approval.

The issue in this case is whether 
a school district is entitled to prospec-
tive  injunctive  relief  against  the  over-
sight  actions  of  the  Texas  Education 
Agency  Commissioner  after  the  Legis-
lature  substantially  amended  the  por-
tions  of  the  Education  Code  limiting

protected a zoning commission’s deter-
mination  that  a  proposed  subdivision 
conformed with applicable law. 

Escalera Ranch is a subdivision 
within the City of Georgetown’s extra-
territorial  jurisdiction,  accessible  via 
Escalera Parkway. A developer applied 
to the city’s Planning and Zoning Com-
mission  for  approval  of  a  preliminary 
plat  for  a  new  subdivision,  Patience 
Ranch, neighboring Escalera Ranch. As 
planned, Escalera Parkway would pro-
vide  the  only  access  to  homes  in  Pa-
tience  Ranch.  Several  Escalera  Ranch 
residents  expressed  concerns  about 
adding  more  traffic  to  Escalera  Park-
way and asserted that the plan did not 
conform to the City’s Unified Develop-
ment  Code  (UDC).  The  Planning  and 
Zoning Commission concluded the plat 
did conform to UDC requirements, and 
that  it  had  a  duty  under  state  law  to 
approve the conforming plat. 

The Escalera Ranch Owners’ As-
sociation  sued  the  Commission  mem-
bers in their official capacities for man-
damus  relief,  asserting  that  the  plat 
was nonconforming. In a plea to the ju-
risdiction,  the  Commissioners  argued 
that the Association lacked standing to 
sue,  and  that  they  had  a  ministerial 
duty to approve a plat they had deter-
mined to be conforming. The trial court 
granted  the  Commissioners’  plea.  The 
court  of  appeals  reversed,  reasoning 
that  the  increased  traffic  along  with 
the 
risks 
amounted  to  a  particularized  injury 
and that the determination of whether 
the plat was conforming was a matter 
of discretion, judicially reviewable for a 
clear abuse.

In  2016,  the  Commissioner  ap-
pointed a conservator to Houston Inde-
pendent  School  District  to  address  re-
peated unacceptable academic account-
ability ratings received by a high school 
in  the  district.  In  2019,  a  second  high 
school  received  its  fifth  unacceptable 
rating  in  six  years,  and  the  Commis-
sioner received a recommendation from 
a special accreditation investigation to 
appoint  a  board  of  managers  to  Hou-
ston  ISD  and  lower  the  district’s  ac-
creditation status.  

Before  the  Commissioner  could 
act, Houston ISD sought and received a 
temporary injunction barring the Com-
missioner  from  appointing  a  board  of 
managers  or  taking  any  other  action 
based  on  the  results  of  the  investiga-
tion. The Commissioner appealed and a 
divided  court  of  appeals  affirmed, 
based on its interpretation of the then-
existing  Education  Code.  While  the 
Commissioner’s  petition  to  this  Court 
was pending, the 87th Legislature sub-
stantially amended the relevant provi-
sions of the Education Code.  

The  Supreme  Court  reversed. 
The Court held that the temporary in-
junction must be supportable under the 
amended  statutes  because  Houston 
ISD only has the right to seek prospec-
tive  compliance  with  the  law.  The 
Court  interpreted  the  amendments  to 
eliminate the grounds the court of ap-
peals relied on to affirm the temporary 
injunction. Because Houston ISD failed 
to  show  that  the  Commissioner’s 
planned  actions  would  violate  the 
amended  law,  the  Court  vacated  the 
temporary  order  and  remanded  the 
case for the parties to reconsider their

c)  Van  Boven  v.  Freshour,  659 
S.W.3d  396  (Tex.  June  3, 
2022) [20-0117] 

The issue in this case is whether 
members  of  the  Texas  Medical  Board 
acted  ultra  vires  by  refusing  to  void  a 
temporary sanction reported against a 
physician  to  the  National  Practitioner 
Data Bank even though the Board ulti-
mately determined that the allegations 
underlying  the  temporary  sanction 
were not proved.  

After  two  patients  filed  com-
plaints  against  Dr.  Van  Boven,  the 
Board  temporarily  restricted  his  li-
cense to practice medicine and reported 
the  suspension  to  the  federal  Data 
Bank. The U.S. Department of Health 
and  Human  Services  issues  a  Guide-
book  categorizing  the  types  of  reports 
to be made, which include an Initial Re-
port, a Void Report, and a Revision-to-
Action  Report.  In  accordance  with  the 
Guidebook’s  instructions,  the  Board 
submitted to the Data Bank an Initial 
Report with notice of Van Boven’s tem-
porary suspension. 

Later,  an  Administrative  Law 
Judge  concluded  the  Board  did  not 
prove  the  allegations  against  Van  Bo-
ven.  Although  the  Board  could  have 
sought  judicial  review  of  the  judge’s 
findings, the Board adopted them. The 
Board  issued  a  final  order  dismissing 
the  disciplinary  proceeding  against 
Van Boven and reinstating his medical 
license.  

Van Boven then urged the Board 
to submit to the Data Bank a Void Re-
port,  which  the  Guidebook  says  is  ap-
propriate when the action giving rise to 
the Initial Report is overturned on ap-
peal. The submission of a Void Report 
removes  the  Initial  Report  from  the 

physician’s  record.  The  Board  instead 
submitted  a  Revision-to-Action  report, 
which the Guidebook describes as “a re-
port  of  an  action  that  modifies  an  ad-
verse  action  previously  reported.” 
When  a  Revision-to-Action  Report  is 
filed, the Initial Report remains part of 
the physician’s record.  

Van Boven sought a writ of man-
damus directing the Board members to 
submit a Void Report to the Data Bank. 
Van Boven argued that the Board’s im-
munity  from  suit  was  waived  because 
the Board acted ultra vires by submit-
ting  a  Revision-to-Action  Report.  The 
trial court denied the Board member’s 
plea to the jurisdiction, but the court of 
appeals  reversed  and  rendered  judg-
ment dismissing Van Boven’s suit. 

The  Supreme  Court  reversed 
and  remanded  the  case  to  the  trial 
court  for  further  proceedings.  The 
Court  reasoned  that  the  Board’s  final 
order  overturned  the  temporary  sus-
pension and that, therefore, the Guide-
book required a Void Report to be filed. 
Justice  Boyd  filed  a  dissent  ex-
plaining his view that the Board’s deci-
sion to file a Revision-to-Action Report 
rather than a Void Report did not vio-
late any state or federal law and there-
fore was not an ultra vires act. 

 

 

 Service of Process 
a)  In  re  Guardianship  of  Fair-
ley,  650  S.W.3d  372  (Tex. 
Mar. 4, 2022) [20-0328] 

The  issue  in  this  case  was 
whether  orders  issued  in  a  guardian-
ship proceeding were void because the 
ward  was  not  properly  served  in  com-
pliance with Texas Estates Code chap-
ter  1051.  James  Fairley’s  wife, 

45 
 

Mauricette, filed applications to be ap-
pointed  as  his  temporary  and  perma-
nent guardian. Both applications were 
personally  served  on  James  by  a  pri-
vate process server. James’s daughter, 
Juliette, opposed the applications. The 
probate court appointed Mauricette as 
James’s  guardian,  and  Juliette  unsuc-
cessfully appealed that order. 

After James died, Juliette filed a 
wrongful-death  suit  against  Mauri-
cette in district court. On Mauricette’s 
motion,  the  probate  court  transferred 
the  wrongful-death  suit  to  the  still-
pending guardianship proceeding. The 
probate  court  then  denied  Juliette’s 
motion  under  the  Texas  Citizens  Par-
ticipation Act (TCPA) challenging both 
the motion to transfer and a Rule 91a 
motion to dismiss. Juliette filed an in-
terlocutory  appeal,  arguing  (among 
other  things)  that  the  probate  court’s 
orders  were  void  because  James  was 
never properly served with the applica-
tions under chapter 1051 of the Estates 
Code.  The  court  of  appeals  held  that 
James  was  properly  served,  and  it  af-
firmed  the  probate  court’s  order.  Juli-
ette  petitioned  for  review,  asserting 
that all the probate court’s orders were 
void for lack of jurisdiction over James. 
The  Supreme  Court  held  that 
the  probate  court’s  orders  were  not 
void. The Court first concluded that the 
probate  court  obtained  subject-matter 
jurisdiction over the guardianship pro-
ceeding when Mauricette filed her ini-
tial application. James’s death did not 
moot the appeal, nor did his death au-
tomatically  terminate  the  guardian-
ship  proceeding  so  as  to  deprive  the 
probate court of jurisdiction to transfer 
the wrongful-death suit. 

With  respect  to  service,  the 
Court  held  that  Estates  Code  section 
1051.103(a) identifies who must be per-
sonally served with a guardianship ap-
plication, but section 1051.051 specifies 
who may serve the application and how 
service must be effected. Although the 
statute  allowed  that  application  to  be 
served by a private process server, the 
record failed to establish that the per-
son  effecting  service  was  “disinter-
ested.”  Service  of  the  application  for 
permanent  guardianship  by  a  private 
process server did not comply with the 
statute. 

The  Court  nevertheless  con-
cluded  that  these  technical  defects  in 
service did not void the probate court’s 
orders.  James  was  represented  in  the 
guardianship proceeding by a court-ap-
pointed attorney ad litem, and through 
the  attorney’s  affirmative  actions, 
James entered a general appearance in 
that proceeding and thereby consented 
to the personal jurisdiction of the pro-
bate court and waived any technical de-
fects  regarding  service.  It  was  undis-
puted  that  James  was  personally 
served with the applications, and Juli-
ette failed to establish that any defect 
in  the  method  of  service  rose  to  the 
level of a violation of due process. 

Justice Devine, joined by Justice 
Blacklock,  dissented.  Noting  that  pro-
posed  wards  in  guardianship  proceed-
ings  are  among  the  most  vulnerable 
members  of  society,  the  dissent  would 
have  held  that  the  failure  to  strictly 
comply with the heightened service re-
quirements  set  forth  in  the  Estates 
Code deprived the probate court of ju-
risdiction over James.

 Duty to Defend 
a)  Monroe  Guar.  Ins.  Co.  v. 
BITCO  Gen.  Ins.  Corp.,  640 
S.W.3d  195  (Tex.  Feb.  11, 
2022) [21-0232] 

 
At  issue  in  this  case is  whether 
Texas law permits consideration of ex-
trinsic  evidence  to  determine  whether 
a liability insurer owes a duty to defend 
when  the  plaintiff’s  pleading  is  silent 
about a potentially dispositive coverage 
fact. 

David Jones sued 5D Drilling & 
Pump  Service  for  damages  resulting 
from 5D’s negligence while drilling an 
irrigation  well.    Jones  alleged  that  he 
contracted with 5D in 2014 and that 5D 
stuck a drilling bit in the bore hole, ren-
dering the well useless. The petition al-
leges  that  Jones’s  land  was  damaged 
but  is  silent  as  to  when  any  alleged 
damage occurred. 

Monroe Guaranty Insurance Co. 
and  BITCO  General  Insurance  Corp. 
each  provided  commercial  general  lia-
bility  coverage  to  5D,  but  at  different 
times.  5D  demanded  a  defense  from 
both  insurers,  but  Monroe  refused  to 
defend,  contending  that  any  covered 
property  damage  occurred  before  its 
policy  period  began.  The  underlying 
lawsuit settled, and BITCO sued Mon-
roe  in  federal  district  court,  seeking 
contribution for its defense costs. Mon-
roe  and  BITCO  stipulated  that  5D’s 
drill  bit  stuck  in  the  bore  hole  “in  or 
around November 2014,” which was be-
fore  Monroe’s  policy  began  in  October 
2015. 

Applying 

“eight-corners 
the 
rule” and considering only Jones’s peti-
tion and the Monroe policy, the district 
court held that Monroe owed a duty to 

defend  because  the  property  damage 
could  have  occurred  anytime  between 
the formation of the drilling contract in 
2014 and the filing of Jones’s lawsuit in 
2016.  Monroe  appealed,  and  the  Fifth 
Circuit  certified  two  questions  to  the 
Court: (1) whether the exception to the 
eight-corners rule articulated in North-
field  Insurance  Co.  v.  Loving  Home 
Care,  Inc.,  was  permissible  under 
Texas law; and (2) when applying such 
an exception, whether a court may con-
sider  extrinsic  evidence  of  the  date  of 
an occurrence. 

The Court held that extrinsic ev-
idence may be considered in duty-to-de-
fend  cases  under  certain  circum-
stances.  The  eight-corners  rule  re-
mains  the  initial  inquiry  to  be  used. 
But if the underlying petition states a 
claim that could trigger the duty to de-
fend,  and  the  application  of  the  eight-
corners rule, due to a gap in the plain-
tiff’s  pleading,  is  not  determinative  of 
whether  coverage  exists,  Texas  law 
permits  consideration  of  extrinsic  evi-
dence  provided  the  evidence  (1) goes 
solely to an issue of coverage and does 
not overlap with the merits of liability, 
(2) does  not  contradict  facts  alleged  in 
the  pleading,  and  (3) conclusively  es-
tablishes  the  coverage  fact  to  be 
proved. 

The  Court’s  standard  is  similar 
to that in Northfield, with minor refine-
ments.  First,  the  threshold  inquiry  is: 
does the pleading contain the facts nec-
essary  to  resolve  the  question  of 
whether  the  claim is covered?  Second, 
there is no requirement that the extrin-
sic  evidence  goes  to  a  “fundamental” 
coverage issue. And third, the proffered 
extrinsic  evidence  must  conclusively 
establish the coverage fact at issue. 

47 
 

In response to the Fifth Circuit’s 
second  certified  question,  the  Court 
concluded  that  evidence  of  the  date  of 
an  occurrence  may  be  considered  if  it 
meets  the  other  requirements  for  con-
sideration of extrinsic evidence. In this 
case, the stipulation’s use as urged by 
Monroe would overlap with the merits 
of liability, so it cannot be considered in 
determining  whether  Monroe  owes  a 
duty to defend. 
 

 Insurer’s Tort Liability 
a)  Elephant  Ins.  Co.  v.  Kenyon, 
644 S.W.3d 137 (Tex. Apr. 22, 
2022) [20-0366]  

The issue in this wrongful death 
and survival action is whether an auto-
mobile insurer owed an insured motor-
ist a duty either to process an accident 
claim  without  requesting  that  the  in-
sured  take  photographs  or  to  issue  a 
safety warning along with any such re-
quest.  

Following  a  single-vehicle  auto-
mobile accident, the insured called her 
husband  from  the  accident  scene  and 
then called her insurer to report the ac-
cident. In response to the insured’s in-
quiry  about  whether  to  take  pictures, 
the insurer’s call center representative 
replied,  “Yes,  ma’am.  Go  ahead  and 
take  pictures.”  At  some  point,  the  in-
sured’s husband arrived at the accident 
scene,  and  while  taking  pictures,  he 
was struck and killed by another vehi-
cle. The insured sued the insurer under 
negligence  and  gross-negligence  theo-
ries that were based, in whole or part, 
on the insured’s contention that the in-
surer’s call center employee was negli-
gent in “instructing” her to take unnec-
essary  photographs  of  a  single  vehicle 
instruction 
accident  because 

the 

substantially  increased  the  risk  of 
harm to her husband and such photos 
would be of nominal or no value in pro-
cessing any claim. The insured argued 
that,  given  the  “special  relationship” 
between  them,  the  insurer  had  a  gen-
eral  duty  to  act  as  a  reasonable  and 
company  and 
prudent 
breached that duty when it instructed 
the insureds to take photographs.  

insurance 

The  trial  court  denied  the  in-
surer’s  motion  for  summary  judgment 
on  the insured’s  policy  benefits  claims 
but granted summary judgment on the 
insured’s negligence claims, ruling the 
insurer  “owed  no  duty”  to  the  insured 
or  her  husband  with  respect  to  those 
claims. Deeming the duty issue a con-
trolling  question  of  law,  the  court  au-
thorized a permissive appeal as to the 
portion of the summary judgment order 
pertaining to that question. 

The court of appeals affirmed in 
a divided panel opinion. On en banc re-
hearing, the court split again but came 
to the opposite decision, reversing and 
remanding.    Strictly  construing  the 
permissive appeal as constrained to the 
existence  of  any  duty  at  all,  the  court 
held  that  (1) insurers  generally  owe 
their insureds a duty of good faith and 
fair dealing and (2) the insurer failed to 
conclusively  negate  that  duty  because 
the record bore some evidence that the 
“request  or  instruction  [to]  take  acci-
dent  scene  pictures”  had  “[some]thing 
to do with the processing [or paying] of 
claims.” The court further held that the 
insurer  had  voluntarily  undertaken  a 
duty for the insured’s benefit or protec-
tion and, in doing so, increased the risk 
of  harm  to  the  insured  and  her  hus-
band.  Finally,  and  in  response  to  the 
dissents,  the  court  held  that  even  if  a 

48 
 

duty did not already exist between in-
surer and insured, one should be recog-
nized based on the Phillips factors—an 
array  of  considerations  courts  balance 
in  determining  the  existence  and  pa-
rameters  of  a  common  law  duty.  The 
dissents asserted that the majority had 
adopted  a  “new  duty”  and,  along  the 
way,  had  misapplied  the  Phillips  fac-
tors,  the  duty  of  good  faith  and  fair 
dealing, and the common law negligent 
undertaking theory.    

The  Supreme  Court  unani-
mously reversed. The Court first clari-
fied that once accepted by an appellate 
court,  a  permissive  interlocutory  ap-
peal is an appeal like any other.  That 
being the case, and in light of such an 
appeal  being  from  “the  order,”  the 
scope of review is not strictly construed 
with respect to the controlling question 
of  law.  Here,  the  question  of  the  in-
surer’s duty involved not only the exist-
ence but also the scope of any duty, and 
the Court held that the insured’s negli-
gence  claims  failed  for  want  of  an  ap-
plicable  legal  duty.  The  Court  ex-
plained  that  (1) the  duty  of  good  faith 
and fair dealing applies to an insurer’s 
sharp practices and, thus, does not en-
compass  the  conduct  alleged  here;  (2) 
the Phillips factors do not weigh in fa-
vor of recognizing a new duty requiring 
insurers to refrain from requesting ac-
cident scene photos or of doing so only 
with  a  safety  admonishment;  and 
(3) the insurer did not, by answering a 
phone call and responding to a question 
about  taking  photographs,  voluntarily 
undertake an affirmative course of ac-
tion  that  was  “necessary”  to  “protect” 
the  insureds  or  their  property  from 
“harm.” The Court therefore rendered a 
take-nothing judgment for the insurer 

on  the  insured’s  negligence  and  gross 
negligence claims. 

Justice  Young  concurred.  He 
opined that, in the modern era, it is un-
likely courts could properly “discover” a 
new duty lurking in the shadows, espe-
cially when, as here, the degree of pos-
itive  law  and  regulation  is  considera-
ble. The concurrence suggested that, in 
an  appropriate  case,  the  Court  might 
re-examine  the  judicial  role  in  recog-
nizing  tort  duties,  observing  that  the 
Phillips factors require “weighing” and 
“balancing”  considerations  that  are 
more  suited  for  the  legislative  branch 
than the judiciary. 
 

 Policies/Coverage 
a)  Pharr–San  Juan–Alamo  In-
dep.  Sch.  Dist.  v.  Tex.  Pol. 
Prop./Cas. 
Subdivisions 
Joint  Self  Ins.  Fund,  642 
S.W.3d  466  (Feb.  11,  2022) 
[20-0033] 

At issue in this insurance-cover-
age dispute is whether a golf cart is cov-
ered under an automobile liability pol-
icy.  The  Pharr-San  Juan-Alamo  Inde-
pendent  School  District  had  an  auto-
mobile-liability 
insurance  from  the 
Texas  Political  Subdivisions  Prop-
erty/Casualty  Joint  Self  Insurance 
Fund.  The  policy  required  the  Insur-
ance Fund to indemnify and defend the 
School District for damages “caused by 
an accident and result[] from the own-
ership, maintenance or use of a covered 
auto.”  The  policy  defined  “auto”  as  “a 
land  motor  vehicle  .  .  .  designed  for 
travel on public roads.”  

After  Alexis  Flores  was  thrown 
from a golf cart driven by a School Dis-
trict  employee  during  a  school  pro-
gram,  she  sued  the  sued  the  School 

49 
 

District.  While  that  suit  was  pending, 
the School District requested a defense 
and  indemnity  from  the  Insurance 
Fund under its automobile policy. The 
Insurance Fund refused, asserting that 
the policy did not provide coverage be-
cause  a  “golf  cart”  is  not  designed  for 
travel  on  public  roads  and  thus  is  not 
an  “auto.”  The  Insurance  Fund  filed 
this  suit  seeking  a  declaratory  judg-
ment that it had no duty to defend the 
School  District.  The  School  District 
filed  a  counter-claim  for  declaratory 
judgment  that  the  policy  required  the 
Insurance  Fund  to  defend  and  indem-
nify  the  School  District.  Meanwhile, 
Flores  won  a  $100,000 
judgment 
against the School District.  

Both  the  Insurance  Fund  and 
the School District moved for summary 
judgment.  With its  motion,  the  School 
District  attached  additional  docu-
ments, including print-outs of portions 
of  the  website  of  E-Z-Go,  a  golf-cart 
manufacturer, and a Wall Street Jour-
nal article on electric vehicles. The trial 
court  determined  as  a  matter  of  law 
that  the  policy  requires  the  Insurance 
Fund  to  defend  and  indemnify  the 
School District. It entered a final judg-
ment requiring the Insurance Fund to 
pay the School District the costs it in-
curred  in  defending  Flores’s  suit  and 
the $100,000 it paid to satisfy the judg-
ment  in  that  suit,  plus  post-judgment 
interest.  

The  Insurance  Fund  appealed, 
and the court of appeals reversed, hold-
ing  that  neither  party  was  entitled  to 
summary judgment on either the duty 
to defend or the duty to indemnify. The 
appellate court first held that, in an ex-
ception  to  the  eight-corners  rule  that 
prohibits the consideration of extrinsic 

evidence in insurance cases like this, it 
could  consider  extrinsic  evidence  be-
cause the evidence was relevant only to 
the insurance-coverage dispute and not 
relevant to the merits of Flores’s claims 
against  the  School  District.  Next,  the 
court  concluded  that  the  School  Dis-
trict’s  extrinsic  evidence  established 
that  “the  term  ‘golf  cart’  has  an  ex-
panded  meaning  in  today’s  lexicon,” 
such  that  it  may  include  vehicles  that 
are designed for travel on public roads. 
But  the  court  concluded  that  the  trial 
court erred by granting the School Dis-
trict’s  summary-judgment  motion  be-
cause  the  extrinsic  evidence  raised  a 
fact  question  about  the  design  of  the 
golf cart from which Flores was thrown. 
On the duty to indemnify, the court of 
appeals also held that the evidence cre-
ated  a  genuine  issue  of  fact  regarding 
whether the golf cart was an “auto” cov-
ered by the policy. 

The  School  District  petitioned 
the Supreme Court for review, but the 
Insurance Fund did not. The Supreme 
Court  affirmed  the  court  of  appeals’ 
judgment  reversing  the  trial  court’s 
judgment, but for different reasons. As 
to  the  duty  to  defend,  the  Court  first 
noted  that  in  a  separate  case  decided 
the same day as this one, the Court ap-
proved  an  exception  to  the  eight-cor-
ners  rule  that  allows  consideration  of 
extrinsic  evidence  in  certain  condi-
tions.  See  Monroe  Guar.  Ins.  Co.  v. 
BITCO Gen. Ins. Corp., 640 S.W.3d 195 
(Tex.  2022). The  Court  concluded  that 
the  Monroe exception  did  not  apply  to 
this  case.  The  Monroe  exception  re-
quires a “gap” in the plaintiff’s petition 
that leaves  the  Court  unable to  deter-
mine whether coverage exists by apply-
ing the eight-corners rule. In this case, 

50 
 

there was no “gap” in the petition’s rec-
itation of facts that needed to be filled. 
And based on the facts alleged, the pe-
tition in this case did not state a claim 
that  could  trigger  the  duty  to  defend 
under the eight-corners rule.  

The  Court  held  that  the  com-
mon, ordinary, and generally accepted 
meaning  of  “golf  cart”  did  not  include 
vehicles  “designed  for  travel  on  public 
roads,” as the insurance policy defined 
“auto.”  The  Court looked  to  dictionary 
and  statutory  definitions,  determined 
that  the  extensive  legislation  permit-
ting golf carts to be operated on public 
roads  under 
limited  circumstances 
showed that golf carts are not normally 
designed for public-road use, and noted 
that  courts  from  other  jurisdictions 
have  consistently  used  and  construed 
the term “golf cart” to refer to a vehicle 
not designed for travel on public roads. 
Second,  the  Court  held  that  even  if  it 
could consider the School District’s ex-
trinsic  evidence,  that  evidence  did  not 
support  a  finding  that  golf  carts  are 
“designed for travel on public roads.”  
 
As to the duty to indemnify, the 
Court held again that the evidence con-
clusively  established  that  the  vehicle 
from which Flores was thrown was not 
“designed  for  travel  on  public  roads.” 
The evidence showed that the golf cart 
was “an older model, electric type [golf 
cart]  commonly  seen  on  golf  courses,” 
was a “normal golf cart you would see 
at a golf course,” and was “not street le-
gal,” even if it may have been used on 
public roads for brief periods. Thus, no 
evidence established that the golf cart 
was a “covered auto” under the policy. 
Finally, the Court noted that its analy-
sis would entitle the Insurance Fund to 
summary  judgment.  But  because  the 

Insurance  Fund  did  not  file  a  petition 
for review, the Court could not render 
judgment  in  its  favor  and  instead  re-
manded to the trial court.  
 

 Private Right of Action 
a)  Tex.  Med.  Res.,  LLP  v.  Mo-
lina  Healthcare  of  Tex.,  Inc., 
659 S.W.3d 424 (Tex. Jan. 13, 
2023) [21-0291] 

The  Texas  Insurance  Code  re-
quires an insurer to pay for emergency 
care provided to its insureds by an out-
of-network  provider  at  the  provider’s 
“usual and customary rate.” The main 
issue in this case and a companion case 
brought on certified question from the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Cir-
cuit,  No.  22-0138,  United  Healthcare 
Insurance  Co.  v.  ACS  Primary  Care 
Physicians Southwest, P.A., is whether 
the Code authorizes a private damages 
action  by  a  physician  against  an  in-
surer  for  violating  this  statutory  re-
quirement. 

Out-of-network  emergency-care 
doctors  sued  Molina, alleging  that  the 
insurer failed to pay the doctors’ usual-
and-customary rates for treating thou-
sands  of  Molina’s 
insureds.  They 
pleaded a cause of action directly under 
the  Code’s  emergency-care  provisions, 
a common-law quantum meruit claim, 
and a statutory claim for unfair settle-
ment  practices.  The  lower  courts  dis-
missed  all  of  the  doctors’  claims,  and 
the Supreme Court affirmed. 

The  Court  first  held  that  the 
Code does not authorize a private cause 
of  action  for  a  violation  of  the  usual-
and-customary  rate  payment  require-
ment.  The  Court  reasoned  that  a  pri-
vate a cause of action is not clearly im-
plied in the text of the emergency-care 

51 
 

provisions and noted that the Legisla-
ture  has  given  the  Department  of  In-
surance  broad  authority  to  enforce 
those  provisions.  The  Court  also  re-
jected  the  doctors’  argument  that  re-
cent  statutory  amendments  that  cre-
ated  a  mandatory  arbitration  scheme 
for  claims  under  the  emergency-care 
provisions  retroactively  created  a  pri-
vate cause of action for claims governed 
by the old, pre-arbitration law.  

As  to  the  doctors’  other  claims, 
the Court held that the doctors cannot 
satisfy  the  second  element  of  a  quan-
tum  meruit  claim—that  they  under-
took to treat Molina’s insureds for the 
benefit  of  Molina—and  also  that  the 
unfair-settlement-practices 
doctors’ 
claim  is  not  viable.  Finally,  the  Court 
addressed the parties’ and lower courts’ 
characterizations  of  Molina’s  chal-
lenges  to  the  doctors’  claims  as  issues 
of the doctors’ standing. The Court re-
iterated that statutory or common-law 
prerequisites  to  a  plaintiff’s  filing  suit 
or recovering on a claim are not issues 
of standing but of merits.  
 

 Texas Anti-Indemnity Act 
a)  Maxim  Crane  Works,  LP  v. 
Zurich  Am.  Ins.  Co.,  642 
S.W.3d  551  (Tex.  Mar.  3, 
2022) [21-0727] 

At issue in this certified question 
case is whether a person employed by a 
general contractor is also considered an 
“employee” of the subcontractor under 
the Texas Anti-Indemnity Act.  

Skanska  USA,  Inc.,  a  general 
contractor, hired Berkel & Co. Contrac-
tors as a subcontractor on a large con-
struction project in Houston. As a con-
dition  of  working  on  the  job,  Skanska 
to 
required 

subcontractors 

its 

participate  in  a  contractor-controlled 
insurance program (CCIP), which pro-
vided both general commercial liability 
and  workers’  compensation  insurance. 
Berkel then leased a crane from Maxim 
Crane Works, L.P., for use on the con-
struction  project.  As  required  under 
the  lease,  Berkel  named  Maxim as  an 
additional insured under Berkel’s com-
mercial general liability insurance pol-
icy, which was issued by Zurich Ameri-
can  Insurance  Company.  Maxim  did 
not enroll in Skanska’s CCIP. 

A Berkel employee operating the 
crane  caused  the  boom  to  collapse, 
crushing  the  leg  of  Tyler  Lee,  a 
Skanska project supervisor. Lee recov-
ered  workers’  compensation  benefits 
under  Skanska’s  CCIP  and  then  sued 
Berkel,  Maxim,  and  others  in  state 
court. A jury returned a verdict for Lee, 
allocating  90%  of  the  fault  to  Berkel 
and 10% to Maxim. Maxim and Lee set-
tled. The Fourteenth Court of Appeals 
reversed  the  trial  court’s  judgment 
against  Berkel  because  it  concluded 
that the Texas Workers Compensation 
Act  provided  the  exclusive  remedy  for 
Lee’s injuries. The court reasoned that 
because Lee and Berkel were both cov-
ered  under  Skanka’s  CCIP,  they  were 
effectively co-employees under the Act.  
In this separate suit, which was 
removed  to 
federal  court,  Maxim 
sought declaratory relief and damages 
against Zurich for improperly denying 
Maxim  coverage  as  an  additional  in-
sured under Berkel’s policy. The TAIA 
sets forth a general rulemaking indem-
nification  clauses  in  construction  con-
tracts  unenforceable.  The  rule  applies 
equally to additional insured coverage, 
but  an  exception  makes  additional  in-
sured coverage enforceable if the claim 

52 
 

runs  against  the  policyholder’s  em-
ployee. The district court granted sum-
mary  judgment  for  Zurich  on  the 
ground  that  the  “employee  exception” 
of  the  Texas  Anti-Indemnity  Act 
(TAIA) precluded Maxim from coverage 
as  an  additional  insured.    Maxim  ap-
pealed. 

In the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the  Fifth  Circuit,  Maxim  and  Zurich 
agreed  that  the  TAIA  voids  Berkel’s 
CGL  policy  from  covering  Maxim’s 
costs  unless  the  “employee  exception” 
applies to their dispute. The Fifth Cir-
cuit  therefore  certified  the  following 
question to the Court: whether the em-
ployee exception “allows additional in-
sured coverage when an injured worker 
brings a personal injury claim against 
the  additional  insured  (indemnitee), 
and  the  worker  and  the  indemnity[or] 
are deemed ‘co-employees’ . . . for pur-
poses of the [Texas Workers’ Compen-
sation Act (TWCA)].” 

The Court accepted the certified 
question  and  held  that  the  word  “em-
ployee” in section 151.103 of the TAIA 
bears  its  common,  ordinary  meaning, 
which is not affected by whether the in-
demnitor  and  injured  employee  are 
considered  co-employees  for  purposes 
of the TWCA.

v. Afiya Ctr., ___ S.W.3d ___, 
2023 WL 2193586 (Tex. Feb. 
24, 2023) [21-0978, 21-1039]  
The  issue  in  these  consolidated 
cases  is  whether  an  advocate  against 
legalized  abortion  defamed  advocacy 
groups  supporting  legalized  abortion 

exhortatory,  first-person  tone,  would 
understand  Dickson’s  speech  to  ad-
vance  longstanding  arguments  about 
the morality and legality of abortion in 
the  service  of  advocating  that  Roe  v. 
Wade be overturned. Such opinions are 
constitutionally  protected.  An  exami-
nation of the statements and their con-
text  shows  no  abuse  of  the  constitu-
tional right to freely speak. Dickson did 
not  urge  or  threaten  violence,  nor  did 
he  misrepresent  the  underlying  con-
duct  in  expressing  his  opinions  about 
that conduct. 

In a concurring opinion, Justice 
Devine wrote to emphasize that a prior 
declaration  that  the  Texas  abortion 
laws  are  unconstitutional  did  not  re-
move  them  from  the  law  books.  Now 
that  the  declaration  has  been  over-
ruled,  these  prohibitions  are  enforcea-
ble. 

)  Mem’l  Hermann  Health  Sys. 
v.  Gomez,  649  S.W.3d  415 
(Tex. Apr. 22, 2022) [19-0872] 
At  issue  in  this  defamation  and 
business-disparagement 
case  was 
whether  any  evidence  supported  the 
jury’s findings that certain statements 
were published and caused damages.  

Miguel A. Gomez, III, M.D., was 
a cardiovascular surgeon at a Memorial 
Hermann hospital campus in Houston. 
When Methodist West opened a nearby 
campus, Gomez began to discuss split-
ting his practice between the two hos-
pitals.  Memorial  Hermann  employee 
Jennifer  Todd  contacted  Methodist 
West  employee  Cyndi  Peña  to  share 
concerns about Gomez’s reputation as a 
surgeon.  Peña  had  heard  concerns  be-
fore,  and  she 
informed  Methodist 
West’s  CEO.  Methodist  West  hired 

  b

when he called them “criminal organi-
zations.”   

Mark  Lee  Dickson  lobbied  the 
city council in Waskom to pass an ordi-
nance declaring abortion an act of mur-
der. The ordinance identified The Lilith 
Fund  for  Reproductive  Equity,  the 
Afiya Center, and Texas Equal Access 
Fund  as  “criminal  organizations”  be-
cause they assist individuals in obtain-
ing abortions. Dickson reproduced por-
tions of the ordinance on his Facebook 
page  and  added  his  own  commentary 
that the groups are criminal organiza-
tions because they “exist to help preg-
nant Mothers murder their babies” and 
“murder  innocent  unborn  children.” 
The  groups  sued  Dickson  for  defama-
tion  in  Travis  and  Dallas  counties.  In 
both suits, Dickson filed motions to dis-
miss under the Texas Citizens Partici-
pation  Act,  which  were  denied.  The 
Fifth  Court  of  Appeals  affirmed,  con-
cluding that Dickson’s statements were 
not  legally  verifiable  under  the  Texas 
Penal Code. The Seventh Court of Ap-
peals  reversed,  holding  that  Dickson’s 
statements  were  constitutionally  pro-
tected  statements  of  opinion.  The  Su-
preme  Court  granted  review  and  con-
solidated the cases for oral argument.  
The  Supreme  Court  held  that  a 
reasonable reader would conclude that 
Dickson’s  statements  were  opinions 
that expressed disagreement with legal 
protections  for  abortion.  Courts  con-
sider  the  entire  context  of  an  alleged 
defamatory  statement  from  the  per-
spective of a reasonable reader, who is 
knowledgeable  of  current  events  and 
sensitive  to  the  manner  of  dissemina-
tion.  A  reasonable  reader,  apprised  of 
the ongoing national debate surround-
ing abortion and informed by Dickson’s

Gomez.  Meanwhile,  Memorial  Her-
mann  began  to  review  non-risk-ad-
justed surgeon mortality rates. This re-
view flagged Gomez as a surgeon with 
a  particularly  high  mortality  rate. 
Gomez objected to the use of this data, 
arguing  it  was  statistically  invalid. 
However, another Memorial Hermann 
employee, Byron Auzenne, told Gomez 
that the data was being widely shared. 
Gomez  eventually  resigned  his  privi-
leges at Memorial Hermann and moved 
his practice entirely to Methodist West.  
Gomez sued Memorial Hermann 
for  antitrust  violations,  and  defama-
tion  and  business  disparagement. 
Gomez  argued  that  Memorial  Her-
mann  used  faulty  data  as  part  of  a 
“whisper campaign” to ruin his reputa-
tion and prevent him from pulling pa-
tients  to  a  rival  hospital.  The  jury 
charge provided two statements in quo-
tation  marks—one  from  Auzenne  to 
Gomez,  and  one  from  Todd  to  Peña—
and asked the jury to answer the defa-
mation  and  disparagement  questions 
“with  respect  to”  the  quoted  state-
ments. The jury rejected Gomez’s anti-
trust  claims  but  awarded  him  over  $6 
million in damages for defamation and 
business  disparagement.  The  court  of 
that 
appeals 
Auzenne’s statement encompassed the 
mortality  data  generally,  and  that 
Todd’s  statement  represented  the  al-
leged whisper campaign.  

affirmed, 

holding 

The  Supreme  Court  reversed 
and  rendered  judgment  for  Memorial 
Hermann.  The  Court  first  interpreted 
the jury charge, which provided specific 
quoted statements, instructed the jury 
to  answer  the  questions  “with  respect 
to”  the  provided  statements,  and  re-
ferred the jury back to “the statement.” 

54 
 

The  Court  held  that  the  jury  charge 
only  asked  the  jury  about  the  quoted 
statements themselves, not the mortal-
ity data in general or the alleged whis-
per campaign. 

Accordingly, the Court held that 
no  evidence  supported  the  jury’s  find-
ing that Auzenne’s statement to Gomez 
was published. There was no evidence 
that the quoted statement properly be-
fore  the  jury  was  communicated  to  a 
third  party  besides  Gomez.  Similarly, 
the  Court  held  that  no  evidence  sup-
ported  the  jury’s  finding  that  Todd’s 
statement  to  Peña  caused  any  of 
Gomez’s  claimed  damages.  The  evi-
dence  showed  that  Peña  had  already 
heard from others what Todd reported 
to her. Nothing connected Peña to any 
of Gomez’s referring physicians. While 
Peña  informed  Methodist  West’s  CEO 
of what she heard, no harm came of it—
Methodist  West  still  offered  Gomez  a 
position at the hospital.  
 

 

 Eminent Domain 
a)  In  re  Breviloba,  LLC,  650 
S.W.3d  508  (Tex.  June  24, 
2022) (per curiam) [21-0541]  
in  this  case  was 
whether  counterclaims  exceeding  the 
amount-in-controversy cap on a county 
court at law’s additional jurisdiction re-
quire a transfer to the district court.  

issue 

At 

Breviloba  sued  H  &  S  Hoke 
Ranch, LLC in a county court at law to 
condemn  a  50-foot-wide  pipeline  ease-
ment  across  Hoke  Ranch’s  property. 
Hoke  Ranch  counterclaimed,  arguing 
that Breviloba was a sham entity that 
lacked  eminent  domain  authority. 
Hoke  Ranch  sought  ownership  of  the 
portion of pipeline crossing its land or 

$13 million in damages.  

Hoke  Ranch  moved  to  transfer 
its  counterclaims  to  the  district  court, 
arguing that they exceeded the county 
court  at  law’s  $250,000  jurisdictional 
limit.  The  county  court  at  law  denied 
the motion. A divided court of appeals 
granted  Hoke  Ranch’s  mandamus  re-
lief  and  ordered  the  entire  case  be 
transferred  to  the  district  court.  Bre-
viloba  sought  mandamus  relief  from 
the Supreme Court. 

The Supreme Court condition-

ally granted Breviloba’s writ of manda-
mus, agreeing that the county court at 
law  retained  jurisdiction  over  the  en-
tire  eminent  domain  case.  Under  the 
Texas  Property  Code,  district  courts 
and county courts at law have concur-
rent  jurisdiction  over  eminent  domain 
proceedings, with no amount-in-contro-
versy cap. The Texas Government Code 
provides  a 
jurisdictional  grant  to 
county  courts  at  law for  civil  cases  up 
to  a  $250,000  amount-in-controversy 
limit. But this is in addition to other ju-
risdiction  provided  by  law,  and  the 
$250,000  cap  does  not  limit  a  county 
court at law’s jurisdiction over eminent 
domain  cases  specifically  granted  in 
the Property Code. 

The  Court  then  concluded  that 
Hoke  Ranch’s  counterclaims  were  in 
fact  part  of  an  eminent  domain  case 
and therefore not subject to an amount-
in-controversy cap. Hoke Ranch’s coun-
terclaims  challenged  Breviloba’s  con-
demnation  authority—a  clear  issue  of 
eminent  domain.  The  court  at  law 
therefore maintained its jurisdiction. 

Accordingly, the Court held that 
the  court  of  appeals  erred  and  condi-
tionally  granted  mandamus  relief,  di-
recting the court of appeals to vacate its 

55 
 

mandamus order.  
 

 Jurisdictional Discovery 
a)  In re Christianson Air Condi-
tioning  &  Plumbing,  LLC, 
639 S.W.3d 671 (Tex. Feb. 4, 
2022) [20-0384] 

The issue in this mandamus pro-
ceeding is whether permissible discov-
ery  under  Texas  Rule  of  Civil  Proce-
dure 120a(3) must relate exclusively to 
the jurisdictional question.  

Plumbing installer Christianson 
Air  Conditioning  and  Plumbing,  LLC 
and homebuilder Continental Homes of 
Texas,  LP  (together,  “Christianson”) 
sued pipe-manufacturer NIBCO, alleg-
ing  that  NIBCO’s  brand  of  PEX  pipe 
leaked  after  installation  in  thousands 
of  Texas  homes.  Christianson  also 
brought claims against Canadian engi-
neering  firm  Jana  Corporation,  claim-
ing that Jana helped NIBCO reformu-
late defective PEX pipe and obtain cer-
tification  for  the  Texas  market.  Jana 
filed  a  special  appearance  contesting 
personal jurisdiction under Rule 120a. 
Christianson  successfully  moved  to 
compel the depositions of two corporate 
representatives  over  Jana’s  objections 
that  Christianson’s  proposed  list  of 
thirty  deposition  topics  impermissibly 
touched the merits of the case.  

Jana  filed  a  petition  for  writ  of 
mandamus  in  the  Third  Court  of  Ap-
peals,  challenging  nine  of  the  deposi-
tion  topics.  The  court  of  appeals 
granted  Jana  mandamus  relief  as  to 
eight  of  the  topics,  holding  that  the 
trial court abused its discretion by com-
pelling jurisdictional discovery of infor-
mation not exclusively related to the ju-
risdictional  question.  Christianson 
then  filed  this  mandamus  proceeding, 

challenging  the  court  of  appeals’  con-
clusions regarding six of the deposition 
topics.  Christianson  argued  that  the 
court of appeals read Rule 120a(3) too 
narrowly, and that topics targeting the 
“purposeful  availment”  element  of  ju-
risdiction may necessarily overlap with 
merits issues. 

Rejecting  the  court  of  appeals’ 
standard,  the  Court  held  that  a  trial 
court  does  not  abuse  its  discretion 
merely by compelling discovery on top-
ics that overlap with merits issues. In-
stead,  when  a  plaintiff  requests  juris-
dictional discovery under Rule 120a(3), 
the information sought must be essen-
tial  to  prove  at  least  one  part  of  the 
plaintiff’s  theory  of  personal  jurisdic-
tion.  Thus,  when  a  stream-of-com-
merce-plus theory of personal jurisdic-
tion  is  at  issue,  proposed  deposition 
topics  must  target  either  the  defend-
ant’s purposeful availment of the Texas 
forum  or  the  relatedness  between  the 
alleged  forum  contacts  and  the  litiga-
tion. The Court also noted that the top-
ics  proposed  must  also  comport  with 
principles limiting the scope of discov-
ery  generally.  In  reviewing  Christian-
son’s  proposed  topics,  the  Court  con-
cluded  that  the  challenged  topics,  in 
addition to being overbroad or duplica-
tive under general discovery principles, 
encompass  some  matters  essential  to 
establishing  purposeful  availment  or 
relatedness,  but  also  encompass  mat-
ters  non-essential  to  either  factor. 
Holding  that  mandamus  relief  was 
proper, the Court conditionally granted 
mandamus relief, directed the court of 
appeals to vacate its mandamus order, 
and instructed the trial court to apply 
the  Court’s  new  standard  to  the  re-
maining disputed deposition topics.

 Standing 
a)  Abbott v. Mexican Am. Legis. 
Caucus, Tex. House of Repre-
sentatives,  647  S.W.3d  681 
(Tex.  June  24,  2022)  [22-
0008] 

This  direct  appeal  arises  from 
two  consolidated  suits  challenging  the 
constitutionality  of  the  Legislature’s 
recently  enacted  laws  reapportioning 
the  State’s  senatorial  and  representa-
tive districts based on the 2020 census. 
The census data was not released until 
September 2021, after the conclusion of 
the Legislature’s 2021 regular session, 
and the Legislature then passed the re-
apportionment  laws  during  a  special 
session called by the Governor. 

In one of the suits, the Mexican 
American  Legislative  Caucus  (MALC) 
sued the Governor and the Secretary of 
State for declaratory and injunctive re-
lief.  MALC  claims  that  H.B.  1,  which 
reapportioned  the  representative  dis-
tricts, is unconstitutional because it vi-
olates  the  “county  line  rule”  of  the 
Texas  Constitution  by  providing  only 
one  district  wholly  contained  within 
Cameron  County  even  though  the 
county’s population is sufficient to sup-
port  two  such  districts.  In  the  other 
suit,  two  state  senators,  a  registered 
voter and candidate for House District 
37,  and  the  Tejano  Democrats  (collec-
tively,  the  Gutierrez  plaintiffs)  sued 
the State of Texas challenging the va-
lidity of both H.B. 1 (for the same rea-
son as MALC) and S.B. 4, which reap-
portioned  the  Texas  senatorial  dis-
tricts.  The  Gutierrez  plaintiffs  allege 
that both bills violate the Texas Consti-
tution because they were enacted dur-
ing a special session of the Legislature 

rather  than  during  “the  first  regular 
session” after publication of the census. 
Both  cases  were  transferred  to 
and consolidated before a special three-
judge  district  court.  The  defendants 
filed  pleas  to  the  jurisdiction,  arguing 
the plaintiffs lacked standing and their 
claims  were  barred  by  sovereign  im-
munity.  The  trial  court  denied  the 
pleas except as to the Gutierrez plain-
tiffs’ claim for injunctive relief. The de-
fendants  appealed,  reiterating  their 
standing and immunity arguments and 
also  contending  that  the  plaintiffs’ 
claims are moot because they have dis-
claimed any request for relief with re-
spect to the 2022 election, and the cur-
rent district maps will not apply to the 
2024  election  because  the  Legislature 
is  constitutionally  required  to  under-
take reapportionment again in 2023.   
The  Supreme  Court  reversed  in 
 
part, dismissed in part, and remanded 
in part. As an initial matter, the Court 
held  that  the  plaintiffs  had  not  dis-
claimed their request for relief as to the 
2022  election  and  that  their  claims 
were not moot. Although the likelihood 
of obtaining relief relating to the 2022 
election is low, such relief is not impos-
sible.  

Turning  to  MALC’s  suit,  the 
Court held that MALC lacked associa-
tional  standing.  The  Court  assumed 
without  deciding  that  MALC  had  met 
its  initial  burden  as  to  its  individual 
members’  standing.  However,  the  in-
terest that MALC claims gives some of 
its  members  individual  standing  as 
Cameron County residents to challenge 
H.B. 1 is unrelated to MALC’s organi-
zational purpose—maintaining and ex-
panding  Latino  representation  across 
elected  offices  in  Texas.  Accordingly, 

57 
 

MALC failed to meet the second prong 
of associational standing. 

By contrast, the Court held that 
one of the Gutierrez plaintiffs, a Cam-
eron  County  resident,  sufficiently  al-
leged  a  particularized  injury  with  re-
spect  to  H.B.  1’s  alleged  violation  of 
Section  26  of  the  Texas  Constitution. 
Another  Gutierrez  plaintiff,  a  state 
senator  who  was  elected  in  2020  for  a 
four-year  term  but  is  required  to  run 
for reelection in 2022 because all sena-
tors  must  run  for  reelection  after  ap-
portionment, sufficiently alleged a par-
ticularized  injury  with  respect  to  S.B. 
4’s alleged violation of Section 28 of the 
Texas  Constitution.  Notwithstanding 
these particularized injuries, the Court 
held that they were not traceable to the 
State of Texas, the only named defend-
ant in the Gutierrez plaintiffs’ suit, be-
cause  there  was  no  enforcement  con-
nection  between  the  challenged  laws 
and  the  State  itself.  However,  the 
Court  explained  that  it  could  remand 
for the plaintiffs to replead their claims 
against  a  proper  state  defendant  ab-
sent incurable jurisdictional defects.  

However, the Court agreed with 
the State that the Section 28 claim was 
facially invalid and thus barred by im-
munity.  Section 28  states  in  part  that 
“[t]he Legislature shall, at its first reg-
ular  session  after  the  publication  of 
each  United  States  decennial  census, 
apportion the state into senatorial and 
representative  districts.”  The  Court 
held that in requiring reapportionment 
at that first regular session, Section 28 
does  not  prohibit  reapportionment  at 
other times. Further, the plaintiffs’ in-
terpretation  would  foreclose  reappor-
that, 
tionment  despite 

fact 

the 

following the census, the existing maps 
on their face violate the U.S. Constitu-
tion. 

Accordingly, 

claims  and 

the  Court  dis-
missed  MALC’s 
the 
Gutierrez  plaintiffs’  Section  28  claim 
for  lack  of  jurisdiction  and  remanded 
the  Gutierrez  plaintiffs’  Section  26 
claim to give them an opportunity to re-
plead against a proper State defendant. 
Chief  Justice  Hecht,  joined  by 
Justice  Boyd  and  Justice  Blacklock, 
dissented, opining that the claims were 
moot as to the 2022 election. As to the 
2024  election,  the  claims  are  not  yet 
ripe and may never germinate because 
reapportionment before that election is 
a  virtual  certainty.  Accordingly,  the 
dissent  would  have  dismissed  both 
suits for lack of jurisdiction.    
 

b)  Grassroots  Leadership,  Inc. 
v.  Tex.  Dep’t  of  Family  and 
Protective Servs., 646 S.W.3d 
815 (Tex. June 17, 2022) (per 
curiam) [19-0092]  

At 

issue 

in  this  case  was 
whether  formerly  detained  asylum-
seeking mothers have standing to chal-
lenge a Department of Family and Pro-
tective Services rule applying to certain 
family detention facilities. 

After  a  federal  court  enjoined 
the Dilley and Karnes federal immigra-
tion  detention  centers  from  detaining 
asylum-seeking  families  because  the 
centers  lacked  a  childcare  license,  the 
Department  promulgated  Rule  748.7 
establishing licensing requirements for 
family  residential  centers  detention 
centers. Rule 748.7 provides an excep-
tion to state childcare licensing stand-
ards  that  largely  prohibit  facilities 
from  housing  unrelated  adults  and 

58 
 

children in the same bedroom. 

that, 

reliance 

Grassroots Leadership, together 
with  several  detained  mothers  and  a 
daycare operator, sued the Department 
to challenge Rule 748.7, and, in partic-
ular, the room-sharing exception. They 
alleged 
on 
in 
Rule 748.7(c), the centers permit unre-
lated adults and children to share bed-
rooms, resulting in safety risks and pri-
vacy  violations  to  the  detainees  and 
their  children.  The  plaintiffs  also  al-
leged  that  the  Rule’s  adoption  results 
in longer detention periods. The plain-
tiffs sought injunctive relief and a dec-
laration  that  the  Department  lacked 
authority to adopt Rule 748.7.  

The  Department  and  interven-
ing private contractors who operate the 
facilities filed pleas to the jurisdiction, 
contending  that  the  plaintiffs  lack 
standing  to  challenge  the  Rule.  After 
granting  the  pleas  in  part,  the  trial 
court  declared  Rule  748.7  invalid  be-
cause it “contravenes” and “runs coun-
ter  to  the  general  objectives  of”  the 
Texas  Human  Resources  Code.  The 
trial court further enjoined the Depart-
ment  from  granting  licenses  under 
Rule 748.7.  

The  court  of  appeals  reversed, 
holding that the detainee-mothers lack 
standing  to  assert  their  claims.  The 
court of appeals held the detainees did 
not  allege  an  injury  traceable  to  the 
Rule.  

The detained mothers petitioned 
The Supreme Court for review, arguing 
they alleged concrete injuries traceable 
to  Rule 748.7  that  are  redressable  in 
court and thus they have standing. In 
cross-petitions,  the  respondents  con-
tested  the  detainees’  standing  and 
raised issues that the court of appeals 

did not reach. 

In  a  per  curiam  opinion,  the  Su-
preme Court reversed and directed the 
court of appeals to consider the remain-
ing jurisdictional issues and the merits 
of  the  case,  as  appropriate.  The  Court 
held  that  the  detained  mothers  had 
standing to challenge the rule because 
they  alleged  concrete  injuries,  includ-
ing  probable  risk  of  harm  and  privacy 
violations. Contrary to the court of ap-
peals’  interpretation,  Rule 748.7  per-
mits  minors  to  share  bedrooms  with 
unrelated  adults  where  it  otherwise 
would not be permitted at these facili-
ties,  and  thus  the  injuries  alleged  are 
traceable  to  the  Rule.  Should  they  be 
proven,  the  requested  relief  seeks  re-
dress of those harms.   
 

 Subject Matter Jurisdiction 
a)  Preston v. M1 Support Servs., 
L.P.,  642  S.W.3d  452  (Tex. 
Jan. 21, 2022) [20-0270] 

At 

issue 

in  this  case  was 
whether the families of three deceased 
Navy  servicemembers  and  an  injured 
servicemember may sue a private Navy 
contractor  for  negligently  maintaining 
a  helicopter  that  crashed  during  a 
training exercise, or if their claims are 
barred  by  the  political  question  doc-
trine. 

The Navy hired M1 Support Ser-
vices to perform maintenance on a fleet 
of Navy aircraft. After the maintenance 
had been completed, five Navy service-
members  took  one  of  the  maintained 
helicopters out for a  training exercise. 
During  the  exercise,  the  helicopter 
caught fire and crashed into the ocean, 
killing  three  passengers  and  injuring 
two. The survivors of the deceased and 
one  injured  passenger  sued  M1  under 

59 
 

the  Death  on  the  High  Seas  Act  and 
maritime law. M1 filed a plea to the ju-
risdiction,  arguing  that  review  of  this 
case  would  require  judicial  second-
guessing of military decisions constitu-
tionally  committed  to  the  Executive 
and  Legislative  Branches.  The  trial 
court granted M1’s plea to the jurisdic-
tion, and the court of appeals affirmed. 
The Supreme Court reversed. 

The  Court  held  that  the  Navy 
did  not  exercise  plenary  control  over 
M1’s  maintenance  activities  such  that 
M1’s actions could be considered Navy 
actions. Further, M1 did not adduce ev-
idence  in  its  plea  to  the  jurisdiction 
that  would  connect  any  negligence  on 
the  Navy’s  part  to  the  cause  of  the 
crash.  Therefore,  adjudication  of  this 
case  could  not  implicate  a  review  of 
Navy decisions. The Court held that is-
sues  that  implicate  sensitive  military 
decision-making are insulated from ju-
dicial  review.  The  claims  here,  how-
ever,  did  not  implicate  such  sensitive 
matters. 

The  Court  reversed  the  court  of 
appeals’  judgment  and  remanded  the 
case  to  the  trial  court  for  further  pro-
ceedings. 
 

 

 Discovery 
a)  In  re  LCS  SP,  LLC,  640 
S.W.3d  848  (Tex.  Feb.  25,

At issue in this case is whether a 
plaintiff suing under Civil Practice and 
Remedies Code Chapter 74, the Texas 
Medical  Liability  Act,  may  obtain  dis-
covery  of  a  skilled  nursing  facility’s 
general  policies  before  serving  the  ex-
pert report that the  Act requires. Sec-
in 
tion  74.351(s)  stays  discovery 

health-care  liability  cases  until  the 
plaintiff  serves  the  defendant  with  an 
expert report supporting the plaintiff’s 
claim, unless the discovery seeks infor-
mation that is “related to the patient’s 
health care.” 
 
Donna  Smith  was  a  patient  at 
the  Signature  Pointe  Senior  Living 
Community,  a  skilled  nursing  facility 
owned  by  LCS  SP,  LLC.  During  that 
time,  she  allegedly  suffered  multiple 
falls,  fracturing  her  ankle,  shoulder, 
and hip. Her husband, Kenneth Smith, 
sued  on  her  behalf,  asserting  health-
care liability claims against LCS under 
the Texas Medical Liability Act. Before 
serving LCS with the Act’s required ex-
pert  report,  Smith  sought  discovery  of 
LCS’s  general  policies.  LCS  objected, 
arguing  that  the  Act  stayed  discovery 
until  after  the  service  of  an  expert  re-
port. The trial court denied Smith’s mo-
tion to compel discovery. 
 
Smith petitioned the court of ap-
peals for mandamus relief, and the ap-
pellate court granted a stay of Smith’s 
expert-report deadline. The court then 
conditionally  granted  relief,  holding 
that LCS’s policies were relevant to as-
sessing  the  appropriate  standard  of 
care that applies to the facility. LCS pe-
titioned the Supreme Court for relief. 
 
Invoking the Act’s stay of discov-
ery in Section 74.351(s), the Court held 
that LCS’s policies were not discovera-
ble  before  Smith  served  LCS  with  an 
expert report. Although the Act excepts 
information  “related  to  the  patient’s 
health care” from the stay of discovery, 
LCS’s  policies  are  not  specific  enough 
to Mrs. Smith’s health care to exclude 
them  from  the  discovery  stay.  Smith 
argued  that  the  Court’s  precedent  in 
Diversicare Gen. Partner v. Rubio, 185 

60 
 

S.W.3d  842  (Tex.  2005),  meant  that 
LCS’s policies were necessarily discov-
erable  before  the  service  of  an  expert 
report. However, the Court had no oc-
casion to examine the Act’s stay of dis-
covery  in  Diversicare.  Though  infor-
mation may be relevant and discovera-
ble,  only  that  which  is  specifically  re-
lated  to  the  patient’s  health  care  may 
be had before the plaintiff serves a re-
port. Thus, the trial court acted within 
its  discretion  in  determining  that  pro-
duction  of  general  policies  and  proce-
dures was premature. 
LCS also objected to the court of 
 
appeals’ stay of the Act’s expert-report 
deadline.  The  Court  held  that  the  ap-
pellate court’s stay was an appropriate 
exercise of the court of appeals’ power 
to  grant  “any  just  relief”  under  Texas 
Rule of Appellate Procedure 52.10(b) to 
preserve  the  rights  of  the  parties  and 
the court’s jurisdiction.

 Expert Reports 
a)  E.D.  v.  Tex.  Health  Care, 
P.L.L.C.,  644  S.W.3d  660 
(Tex.  May  6,  2022)  (per  cu-
riam) [20-0657] 

The  issue  in  this  medical-mal-
practice  case  is  whether  an  expert  re-
port reflects “an objective good faith ef-
fort”  to  satisfy  the Texas  Medical Lia-
bility Act’s “fair summary” standard in 
a suit alleging that negligent perinatal 
care  during  labor  and  delivery  caused 
an infant’s brain damage and other se-
rious health conditions.   

The  defendant  doctor  induced 
the  mother’s  labor  after  a  full-term, 
healthy  pregnancy.  During  the  next 
day and a half, fetal heart-rate tracing 

showed intermittent signs of fetal dis-
tress.  These  tracings  were  not  accu-
rately charted by the attending nurse, 
but the doctor physically examined the 
patient at one point and communicated 
with the nurse about the patient’s con-
dition at least two times. Shortly after 
the last communication between doctor 
and nurse, the situation became “very 
concerning”  when  the  fetal  heart  rate 
plummeted,  a  condition  called  fetal 
bradycardia. Twenty minutes later, the 
baby  was  delivered  in  grave  condition 
via  emergency  cesarean  section,  and 
she  was  subsequently  diagnosed  with 
hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, cere-
bral palsy, and quadriplegia.  

joint  motion 

The baby’s parents sued the doc-
tor, his medical practice, and others for 
negligence.  After  the  plaintiffs  timely 
served an amended expert report as re-
quired by the Medical Liability Act, the 
defendant doctor and his practice filed 
a 
the 
healthcare-liability  claims  with  preju-
dice.  The  motion  asserted  that  the  re-
port inadequately articulated a demon-
strable  breach  of  the  standard  of  care 
and  was  “conclusory,  speculative,  and 
disconnected 
the  underlying 
facts.”  

to  dismiss 

from 

The  trial  court  denied  the  mo-
tion, but the court of appeals reversed, 
dismissed  the  claims  with  prejudice, 
and  remanded  to  the  trial  court  to 
award  reasonable  costs  and  attorney’s 
fees. The court found the report conclu-
sory,  speculative,  and  legally  insuffi-
cient to support the healthcare-liability 
claims.  

Without hearing oral argument, 
the  Supreme  Court  reversed  and  re-
manded.  The Court concluded that the 
expert’s report was adequate under the 

61 
 

Medical Liability Act’s “good faith” and 
“fair  summary”  standards  because  it 
(1) described  the  standard  of  care  the 
doctor owed to mother and child as re-
quiring  effective  communication  with 
the nurse or close personal monitoring 
of the fetal heart rate; (2) identified the 
doctor’s breach as failure to timely and 
accurately evaluate the fetal heart-rate 
tracing  markers,  either  personally  or 
by making appropriate inquiries of the 
attending nurse; and (3) explained that 
earlier delivery would have avoided or 
lessened  the  injury  the  baby  suffered 
and  that  the  doctor’s  failures  delayed 
delivery too late to avoid injury. 

The Court held that, in conclud-
ing to the contrary, the court of appeals 
failed to consider the report as a whole 
and  impermissibly  weighed  the  credi-
bility of the expert’s opinions. 
 

b)  Lake Jackson Med. Spa, Ltd. 
v.  Gaytan,  640  S.W.3d  830 
(Feb. 25, 2022) [20-0802] 
The primary issue in this case is 
whether  a  plaintiff’s  claims  constitute 
“health care liability claims” under the 
Texas Medical Liability Act. A prelimi-
nary  issue  is  whether  the  Act  prohib-
ited  the  plaintiff 
filing  an 
amended petition after the Act’s dead-
line for serving expert reports.  

from 

Erika  Gaytan  sued  Lake  Jack-
son Medical Spa, Ltd., its employee, an 
aesthetician, and its owner, Dr. Robert 
Yarish, complaining that the aestheti-
cian  negligently  performed  various 
skin  treatments  that  caused  scarring 
and  discoloration  to  Gaytan’s  skin. 
Gaytan  originally  sued  for  “medical 
negligence” involving an “improper and 
negligent course of medical treatment.” 
Well  after  120  days  had  passed,  the 

defendants moved to dismiss Gaytan’s 
claims  because  she  had  not  served  an 
expert report as required by the Texas 
Medical Liability Act.  

In response, Gaytan argued that 
the Act did not apply because she com-
plained only about “cosmetic skin treat-
ments”  she  received  “purely  for  aes-
thetic  reasons.”  She  filed  a  second 
amended  petition  the  day  before  the 
hearing  on  the  defendants’  dismissal 
motion, in which she omitted all refer-
ences to the Act and to “medical” treat-
ments  or  negligence.  Her  factual  alle-
gations  remained  the  same.  The  trial 
court denied the defendants’ dismissal 
motion, and the defendants took an in-
terlocutory  appeal.  The  court  of  ap-
peals affirmed. 

The  Court  held  first  that  the 
courts  could  consider  Gaytan’s  second 
amended petition. First, the Act’s 120-
day  deadline  expressly  applies  only  to 
the serving of an expert report, and not 
to the filing of amended pleadings. Sec-
ond,  the  Act  says  nothing  about 
whether or when a claimant can amend 
her pleadings, and the rules generally 
permit  parties  to  freely  amend  their 
pleadings. Third, courts must consider 
“the underlying nature of the plaintiff’s 
claim  rather  than  its  label.”  Finally, 
the Act’s dismissal process justifies the 
trial  court’s  consideration  of  amended 
pleadings.  
 
As  to  the  underlying  nature  of 
Gaytan’s  claims,  the  Court  held  that 
they  were  health  care  liability  claims 
subject  to  the  expert-report  require-
ment. First, although Dr. Yarish never 
saw Gaytan personally, a physician-pa-
tient  relationship  can  arise  “without 
the  formalities  of  a  contract,”  and  the 
lack  of  consent-to-treatment  forms  or 

62 
 

the  like  does  not  preclude  a  relation-
ship.  A  patient  need  not  interact  di-
rectly  with  or  have  physical  contact 
with the physician for the relationship 
to  exist.  What  matters  is  the  physi-
cian’s express or implied agreement to 
provide,  and  the  patient’s  express  or 
implied agreement to accept, the physi-
cian’s “professional services.” The facts 
of this case conclusively establish that 
Gaytan became Dr. Yarish’s patient by 
seeking  treatments  from  an  employee 
at a medical spa Dr. Yarish owned and 
operated. 
Next,  Gaytan’s  claims  com-
 
plained of “medical care or treatment.” 
Expert  testimony  was  necessary  be-
cause  Gaytan  complained  of  services 
and treatment “not within the common 
knowledge  of  laypersons.”  The  proper 
and  applicable  standards  of  “dermato-
logical care,” reliance on medical histo-
ries, risks involving the use of prescrip-
tion creams, and proper adjustments of 
a  laser-treatment  device,  as  well  as 
whether defendants’ conduct fell below 
those  standards,  are  all  matters  that 
require expert testimony. And the con-
duct Gaytan complained of was an “in-
separable or integral part of the rendi-
tion of health care.” “Nonsurgical med-
ical  cosmetic  procedures”  constitute 
“the  practice  of  medicine”  in  Texas. 
Gaytan  asserted  that  she  sought  the 
treatments for acne, which is a disease, 
from a physician-owned “medical spa,” 
which by definition offers medical ser-
vices that must be performed or super-
vised by a licensed physician.   
 
Gaytan’s  claims  were  therefore 
health  care  liability  claims  subject  to 
the  Texas  Medical  Liability  Act’s  ex-
pert-report 
requirements.  Because 
Gaytan failed to serve an expert report 

before  the  Act’s  120-day  deadline,  the 
Court dismissed her claims. The Court 
remanded the case to the trial court to 
award defendants their reasonable at-
torney’s fees and costs. 
 

 Sufficiency of the Evidence 
a)  Pediatrics  Cool  Care  v. 
Thompson,  649  S.W.3d  152 
(May 13, 2022) [21-0238] 
At  issue  in  this  case is  whether 
there was legally sufficient evidence to 
support a jury’s finding that a doctor’s 
negligence caused a teen’s suicide.  

Accompanied  by  her  mother, 
A.W.  visited  her  pediatrician  to  ad-
dress  feelings  of  depression.  After  a 
brief  consultation,  a  physician  assis-
tant prescribed Celexa, an anti-depres-
sant. Five months later, A.W. commit-
ted suicide. A.W.’s parents sued the pe-
diatrician  and  the  physician  assistant 
for  negligence  and  presented  evidence 
that  the  care  A.W.  received  fell  below 
the standard. On the issue of causation, 
the parents presented a psychiatric ex-
pert, who testified that, had the physi-
cian  assistant  asked  A.W.  additional 
questions  and  interviewed  A.W.  out-
side her mother’s presence, A.W.’s an-
swers  “would  have  created  pathways 
towards treatment options.” If the pro-
viders  had  followed  up  with  A.W.,  as 
they  should  have,  and  if  A.W.  had  ac-
cepted  further  treatment,  the  expert 
testified that A.W. more likely than not 
would still be alive.  

The jury found that the pediatri-
cian  and  the  physician  assistant  had 
proximately  caused  A.W.’s  death.  The 
court of appeals affirmed, holding that 
the  providers’  negligence  was  a  sub-
stantial factor in bringing about A.W.’s 
death. Though the jury charge gave the 

63 
 

standard  proximate  cause  instruction, 
the court of appeals declined to assess 
whether the providers’ negligence was 
a  cause  in  fact,  or  but-for  cause,  of 
A.W.’s  death,  citing  Bustamante  v. 
Ponte, 529 S.W.3d 447, 457 (Tex. 2017).  
The Court reversed, holding that 
Bustamante  did  not  eliminate  but-for 
causation.  Bustamante  stands  for  the 
proposition  that,  when  the  negligent 
acts  of  multiple  providers  are  so  con-
current  that  they  cannot  be  examined 
in isolation, the  correct  approach  is  to 
consider  whether  each  provider’s  indi-
vidual  negligence  is  a  substantial  fac-
tor in the injury and whether the com-
bined negligence was a but-for cause of 
the  injury.  The  Court  reaffirmed  the 
causation  standard  it  set  forth  in  two 
earlier cases holding that medical neg-
ligence was not a but-for cause of a pa-
tient’s suicide.  

Applying  the  correct  standard, 
the Court held that the parents did not 
provide legally sufficient evidence that 
the providers’ combined negligence was 
a but-for cause of A.W.’s death. The ex-
pert’s testimony relied on assumptions 
not found or contradicted by facts in the 
record,  including  about  whether  A.W. 
had suicidal thoughts at the time of her 
visit  and  would  have  disclosed  such 
thoughts had she been asked the right 
questions,  despite  the  evidence  that 
A.W.  had  never  disclosed  suicidal 
thoughts to anyone. The expert also as-
sumed that A.W. would have accepted 
treatment,  despite  evidence  that  A.W. 
had  declined  counseling.  The  expert 
conceded that even if the providers had 
not  been  negligent,  A.W.  might  still 
have  committed  suicide.  Finally,  the 
expert  did  not  exclude  the  possibility 
suggested  by  the  providers’  expert—

that A.W.’s suicide, like many teenage 
suicides,  was  a  spontaneous,  impul-
sive,  and  thus  unpreventable  act.  The 
Court rendered judgment that the par-
ents take nothing.  

Justice  Busby  joined the  major-
ity  opinion  and  issued  a  concurring 
opinion suggesting that plaintiffs in fu-
ture  suicide  cases  might  request  that 
the ordinary causation standard be tai-
lored  to  account  for  the  limitations  of 
psychiatric  science  and  highlighting 
the administrative and criminal reme-
dies available to address medical negli-
gence.  

Justice  Boyd  dissented,  joined 
by  Justice  Lehrmann.  The  dissent 
agreed  on  the  causation  standard  but 
argued  that  the  parents’  expert  testi-
mony  was  legally  sufficient  evidence 
that  A.W.  would  still  be  alive  but  for 
the providers’ negligence, based on the 
expert’s  long  history  of  successfully 
treating adolescent patients presenting 
with  depression  as  sufficient  basis  for 
his statements about what A.W. would 
have said or done if her care had been 
different.  
 

 

 Damages—Periodic 

Pay-

ments Statute 

a)  Columbia  Valley  v.  A.M.A., 
654 S.W.3d 135 (Tex. Apr. 22, 
2022) [20-0681] 

In  this  medical  negligence  case, 
the  jury  awarded  more  than  $10  mil-
lion to the plaintiff, who was born with 
his  umbilical  cord  wrapped  tightly 
around  his  neck  and  later  was  diag-
nosed  with  cerebral  palsy.  The  jury 
found that his injuries were caused by 
the defendant medical center because, 
for example, nurses delayed calling the 

64 
 

obstetrician after observing the baby’s 
heartrate drop dangerously.  

The  medical  center  asked  the 
trial  judge  to  apply  the  Periodic  Pay-
ments  Statute  to  the  award  of  future 
medical  damages.  The  trial  court 
awarded  $604,000  annually  for  five 
years  and  ordered  that  the  remainder 
be paid to a special-needs trust up front 
and  in  a  lump  sum.  After  trial,  the 
medical  center  challenged  the  jury 
award and the application of the peri-
odic-payments statute. The court of ap-
peals affirmed the trial court.   

The Supreme Court’s only other 
opinion  interpreting  the  periodic-pay-
ment statute, Regent Care of San Anto-
nio,  L.P.  v.  Detrick,  610  S.W.3d  830 
(Tex.  2020),  was  published  after  the 
trial  court  made  its  decision  in  this 
case.  In  Regent  Care,  the  Supreme 
Court  examined  the  periodic-payment 
statute for the first time and gave guid-
ance to trial courts in applying the stat-
ute  to  jury  awards.  Because  the  trial 
court made its decision without Regent 
Care’s guidance, the Supreme Court re-
manded the case to the trial court to ap-
ply  the  periodic-payments  statute  in 
light of Regent Care and this opinion.   
Specifically, the Court held that 
the trial court must point to evidence, 
either contained in the record or gath-
ered  in  further  hearings  about  the 
structure  of  the  periodic  payments,  to 
justify  how  it  structures  any  periodic-
payments order, including any amount 
paid  up  front  as  a  lump  sum.  The 
court’s order cannot contradict the jury 
award.  Finally,  the  award  must  not 
evade  the  statutory  requirement  that 
payments of future medical costs cease 
if  the  beneficiary  dies  before  the  pay-
complete.  The  Court 
ments  are 

remanded  for  further  proceedings  re-
garding  the  periodic-payments  award 
structure.  
 

 

 Drainage Fees 
a)  Perez  v.  Turner,  653  S.W.3d 
191 (Tex. June 10, 2022) [20-
0382] 

This  suit  challenged  a  City  of 
Houston  drainage  fee  ordinance.  In 
2010,  voters  approved  Proposition  I, 
which amended the City Charter to cre-
ate  a  drainage  and  street  fund  to  re-
ceive revenue from various sources in-
cluding  fees  imposed  on  real  property 
owners.  Elizabeth  Perez  (a  municipal 
voter and taxpayer) and others filed an 
election  contest.  The  Supreme  Court 
held  in  Dacus  v.  Parker,  466  S.W.3d 
820, 822 (Tex. 2015), that the proposi-
tion  language  misleadingly  failed  to 
mention  drainage  charges  that  would 
be imposed on property owners. On re-
mand, the trial court held that Proposi-
tion I’s amendment to the City Charter 
was void; that ruling was upheld on ap-
peal. Meanwhile, in 2011, the city coun-
cil  passed  its  own  drainage  fee  ordi-
nance  known  as  the  DFO,  creating  a 
utility  that  was  allowed  to  collect  and 
spend drainage fees.  

In  2015,  following  the  Supreme 
Court’s Dacus decision, Perez filed the 
pending  suit  against  the  City,  its 
mayor, and its director of public works 
(collectively  the  City).  Perez  claimed 
she had paid fees under the DFO. She 
alleged that the DFO was void and that 
the  fees  had  been  assessed  and  col-
lected  under  the  void  DFO  and  2010 
charter  amendment.  The  suit  sought 
class certification, and as relief sought 
reimbursement  of  drainage  fees  and 

65 
 

prospective  injunctive  relief  against 
such fees. 

The City filed a plea to the juris-
diction/motion for summary judgment. 
The trial court dismissed the suit, con-
cluding  that  (1)  Perez’s  constitutional 
claims  relating  to  the  2010  charter 
amendment at issue in Dacus were not 
ripe  for  adjudication  at  the  time  the 
pending suit was filed; (2) Perez lacked 
standing  to  challenge  the  collection  of 
drainage 
the  charter 
amendment  or  the  DFO;  and  (3)  gov-
ernmental  immunity  barred  her  ultra 
vires  claims.  In  2018,  while  the  case 
was  on  appeal,  the  City  passed  a  new 
charter  amendment  curing  the  princi-
pal defects in the DFO that Perez had 
alleged.  The  court  of  appeals  affirmed 
the dismissal of Perez’s claims based on 
its analysis of ripeness and standing. 

fees  under 

  The Supreme Court affirmed the 
court of appeals’ dismissal of the claims 
but  remanded  the  case  to  the  district 
court to allow Perez the opportunity to 
replead her claims. 

The  Court  disagreed  with  the 
court of appeals that claims regarding 
the alleged invalidity of the 2010 char-
ter  amendment  were  not  ripe  at  the 
time  Perez  filed  suit.  Perez  had  as-
serted  a  present  injury  sufficient  to 
make  her  claims  ripe.  The  Court  held 
that Perez had standing to pursue the 
two  remaining  claims.  Perez  had  tax-
payer  standing  to  seek  an  injunction 
against the expenditure of illegally col-
lected funds. She also had standing to 
bring  her  remaining  reimbursement 
claim. 

However,  the  Court  ultimately 
held that Perez’s claims were properly 
dismissed on grounds of governmental 
reimbursement 
immunity.  Perez’s 

claim and her claim for injunctive relief 
were premised on the City’s lack of au-
thority  to  assess  the  drainage  fees  in 
the  absence  of  a  valid  charter  amend-
ment. The Court, however, agreed with 
the City that even in the absence of the 
2010 charter amendment, the City had 
authority  under  its  general  authority 
as  a  home-rule  municipality  to  enact 
the  DFO.  Perez  argued  that  the  DFO 
conflicted  with  a  state  statute—the 
Municipal  Drainage  Utility  Systems 
Act (MDUSA)—but the Court held that 
the  MDUSA  itself  states  that  it  does 
not  alter  a  home-rule  municipality’s 
general  powers.  The  Court  noted  that 
Perez might have a valid claim that the 
DFO  violated  the  City  Charter’s  reve-
nue  or  spending  caps,  but  she  did  not 
argue this theory of drainage fee inva-
lidity to the Court. 

Finally,  the  Court  held  that 
while Perez’s claims were properly dis-
missed, she should be given the oppor-
tunity to replead in light of intervening 
events. The Court therefore remanded 
the case to the district court.  
 

 

 Solid Waste Regulation 
a)  Builder Recovery Servs., LLC 
v.  Town  of  Westlake,  650 
S.W.3d  499  (Tex.  May  20, 
2022) [21-0173] 

The  primary  issue  in  this  case 
was whether a general-law municipal-
ity  could  impose  a  percentage-of-reve-
nue license fee on a solid waste hauling 
company.  Builder  Recovery  Services 
(BRS) collects and removes solid waste 
from  residential  construction  sites  in 
the  Town  of  Westlake,  a  general-law 
municipality.  Westlake  has  a  “fran-
chise  agreement”  with  another  com-
pany,  Republic,  that  provides  regular 

66 
 

residential  and  commercial  trash  col-
lection  for  the  whole  town.  BRS  pro-
vides  waste-hauling  services  for  indi-
vidual  customers  who  are  building  or 
remodeling homes. BRS believed it was 
permitted by law to provide this service 
despite  the  town’s  exclusive  franchise 
agreement with Republic. After negoti-
ations, the town adopted an ordinance 
that  permitted  BRS  to  operate  its 
waste-hauling  business,  but  BRS  was 
required to obtain a license, follow cer-
tain  rules  pertaining to  waste  haulers 
(such  as  rules  related  to  vehicle 
maintenance and identification, insur-
ance, and reports), and pay a fee equal 
to  15%  of  the  revenue  generated  from 
the operations. 

BRS sued, claiming that the reg-
ulation exceeded the town’s regulatory 
authority.  The  district  court  held  that 
the  regulation  was  preempted  by  sec-
tion 361.0961 of the Health and Safety 
Code,  which  regulates  certain  waste-
management containers. But the court 
rejected  BRS’s  other  arguments  as  to 
why the ordinance was allegedly inva-
lid. 

The  court  of  appeals  held  that 
the ordinance was permitted under sec-
tion  363.111  of  the  Health  and  Safety 
Code,  which  authorizes  municipalities 
to  “adopt  rules  for  regulating  solid 
waste collection, handling, transporta-
tion, storage, processing, and disposal.” 
The court held that the ordinance was 
not preempted under section 361.0961. 
The court also held that insofar as BRS 
was challenging the 15% fee as an un-
constitutional  occupation  tax,  this  is-
sue  was  moot  because  the  town  had 
lowered the 15% fee to 3%. 

The Supreme Court reversed the 
court of appeals’ judgment. It held that 

the validity of the fee was not moot be-
cause  BRS  was  challenging  any  fee 
based  on  a  percentage  of  revenue  and 
because  it  had  paid  fees  based  on  the 
15%  rate  into  an  escrow  account  and 
was  seeking  return  of  these  fees.  The 
court held that general-law municipal-
ities only have powers expressly or im-
pliedly  conferred  upon  them.  Implied 
powers are limited to those reasonably 
necessary to make effective the powers 
expressly  granted  and  must  be  “indis-
pensable”  to  carrying  out  expressly 
granted  powers.  Under  this  standard, 
the town had no authority under Texas 
law to impose a percentage-of-revenue 
license fee on BRS.  

As to the other aspects of the ordi-
nance  including  the  license  require-
ment, the Court noted that the parties 
had  not  briefed  the  severability  of  the 
other  provisions.  Further,  the  town 
was  unclear  in  its  briefing  as  to 
whether  it  contends  the  other  provi-
sions survive if the fee is declared inva-
lid  and  whether  it  wishes  to  retain 
them, and BRS in its briefing was un-
clear as to whether it objected to being 
subject to other rules set out in the or-
dinance. The Court remanded the case 
to the court of appeals to consider these 
other provisions if the parties wished to 
argue them.  
 

 

 Duty of Reasonable Care  
a)  Three  Aces  Towing,  Inc.  v. 
Landrum,  653  S.W.3d  727 
(Tex. Sept. 23, 2022) (per cu-
riam) [21-0652]  

The issue in this case is whether 
the  court  of  appeals  misapplied  the 
common-law rule that the duty of rea-
sonable care applicable to a negligent-

67 
 

undertaking claim is limited to the con-
text of the undertaking.  

Jeffrey  Landrum  died  after  be-
ing crushed by a portable storage unit 
that he delivered to 3 Aces Storage by 
tractor  trailer.  Landrum  had  asked  3 
Aces’  owner,  Dawn  Hancock,  to  help 
him  push  the  unit  about  a  foot  to  the 
end  of  the  trailer,  which  she  did. 
Landrum then instructed Dawn to step 
away from the trailer while he finished 
the unloading process. Once Dawn had 
stepped  away,  Landrum  tried  to  ease 
the unit down a ramp on the end of the 
trailer with his hands, but the unit fell 
on top of him.  

Landrum’s daughter sued 3 Aces 
for  wrongful  death.  Though  the  trial 
court  granted  3  Aces’  motion  for  sum-
mary  judgment,  a  divided  court  of  ap-
peals reversed. The panel majority rea-
soned that once Dawn started assisting 
Landrum, she undertook a duty to pro-
tect  him  from  dangers  that  a  prudent 
person could foresee resulting from the 
situation.  

Without hearing oral argument, 
the  Supreme  Court  reversed  and  ren-
dered  judgment  for  3  Aces.  In  a  prior 
case,  the  Court  had  explained  that 
when  one  undertakes  to  provide  ser-
vices to another, the person assumes a 
duty of reasonable care that “is limited 
to that undertaking.” Here, the undis-
puted  evidence  showed  that  Landrum 
asked Dawn only to help him move the 
unit  about  a  foot  to  the  end  of  the 
trailer  and  that  Dawn  had  stopped 
helping  and  stepped  away  when 
Landrum asked her to. The Court held 
that  any  duty  of  reasonable  care  that 
Dawn undertook ended when Landrum 
told her to step away while he finished. 
 

 Premises Liability 
a)  In  re  Eagleridge  Operating, 
LLC,  642  S.W.3d  518  (Tex. 
Mar. 11, 2022) [20-0505] 
This  mandamus  proceeding 
challenged  a  trial-court  order  striking 
a  responsible-third-party  designation 
in  a  negligence  suit  arising  from  a 
burst  pipeline  on  an  oil-and-gas  well-
site.  The  issue  was  whether  a  former 
minority working-interest owner bears 
continuing  responsibility  for  defective 
premises  conditions  despite  convey-
ance of its ownership interest if (1) the 
condition  was  constructed  while  the 
former owner was serving as the well-
site  operator  of  record  and  (2) the  for-
mer owner received a fee to serve as the 
operator. 

When  the  pipeline  was  con-
structed,  Aruba  Petroleum  was  a  mi-
nority working-interest owner that was 
receiving  a  fee  while  serving  as  the 
wellsite  operator  of  record.  But  before 
injured  a 
the  pipeline  burst  and 
worker, Aruba had conveyed its owner-
ship  interest  to  the  majority  work-
ing-interest  holder,  USG  Properties, 
and  ceased  serving  as  operator  of  rec-
ord.  The  injured  worker  and  his  nu-
clear  family  members  sued  USG  and 
the new operator of record, Eagleridge 
Operating,  for  negligence  and  gross 
negligence.  Eagleridge,  in  turn,  desig-
nated  Aruba  as  a  responsible  third 
party, but on the plaintiffs’ motion, the 
trial court struck the designation. The 
plaintiffs had argued that, as a former 
owner,  Aruba  had  no 
property 
post-conveyance 
for 
responsibility 
premises  defects  even  as  to  conditions 
it had created. 

Eagleridge  sought  mandamus 
relief, urging that, in constructing the 

68 
 

the 

that 

pipeline, Aruba had acted in a dual ca-
pacity as both owner and independent 
contractor and remained responsible in 
the latter capacity under general negli-
gence principles even after relinquish-
ing ownership and control of the prop-
erty. In a split decision, the court of ap-
peals denied mandamus relief based on 
Occidental  Chemical  Corp.  v.  Jenkins, 
478  S.W.3d  640  (Tex.  2016),  which 
(1) “reject[s] the notion that a property 
owner  acts  as  both  owner  and  inde-
pendent contractor when improving its 
own property” and (2) holds that, after 
the  creator  of  a  dangerous  premises 
condition  has  conveyed  ownership  of 
real property, the property’s new owner 
“ordinarily  assumes  responsibility  for 
the  property’s  condition  with  the  con-
veyance.”  Id.  at  644,  648.  The  dissent 
concluded 
responsi-
ble-third-party designation was proper 
because Eagleridge produced some evi-
dence that Aruba was “working under 
a third-party contract” with USG when 
it  allegedly  constructed  a  hazardous 
condition  and,  if  the  jury  so  found, 
Aruba would remain responsible in its 
capacity as an independent contractor  
The Supreme Court denied man-
damus  relief,  agreeing  with  the  lower 
courts  that  Occidental  precludes  the 
dual-role  analysis  central 
to  Ea-
gleridge’s designation theory. Applying 
Occidental, the Court held that Aruba’s 
responsibility  for  premises  defects  did 
not survive conveyance of its ownership 
interest  to  USG.  As  the  Court  ex-
plained,  Occidental  holds  that  a  prop-
erty  owner,  when  making  improve-
ments  on  its  own  property,  acts  solely 
in its capacity as an owner and not as 
an  independent  contractor.  The  Court 
that  Aruba’s 
was  not  persuaded 

minority-interest status or receipt of an 
operations fee gave rise to an exception. 
Aruba  and  USG  were  tenants-in-com-
mon, and as Eagleridge acknowledged, 
each could construct improvements on 
the  property  without  the  other’s  con-
sent.  The  Court  concluded  that  an 
agreement  strictly  between  tenants in 
common to allocate expenses, assign re-
sponsibilities, and  compensate  for  dis-
parate efforts in a joint endeavor does 
not create an exception to Occidental as 
to improvements each party would oth-
erwise have been free to construct. Oc-
cidental’s core holding is based on own-
ership,  and  Aruba  was  a  property 
owner exercising its possessory right to 
develop  its  property  when  it  allegedly 
installed the gas line. 

The  Court  declined  to  consider 
additional  issues  raised  for  the  first 
time on petition for writ of mandamus 
because those issues had not been pre-
sented  to  the  respondent  trial  court. 
The  extraordinary  nature  of  the  man-
damus remedy almost always requires 
a  predicate  request  to  the  respondent 
and a refusal to act, which did not occur 
here  as  to  the  new  issues.  The  Court 
also did not reach the plaintiffs’ alter-
native  argument  that  Eagleridge  pro-
duced  no  evidence  that  Aruba  had  ac-
tually constructed the pipeline. 
 

b)  Energen  Res.  Corp.  v.  Wal-
lace,  642  S.W.3d  502  (Tex. 
Mar. 11, 2022) [20-0451] 

At 

issue 

 
in  this  case  was 
whether  Chapter  95  of  the  Civil Prac-
tice  and  Remedies  Code  applies  when 
alleged  negligence  at  an  improvement 
other than the one on which the plain-
tiff  was  working  contributed  to  the 
plaintiff’s  injuries.  Energen  Resources 

69 
 

Corporation  began  drilling  an  oil  well 
on  its  mineral  leasehold.  To  facilitate 
the  oil  well  operations,  Energen  hired 
Dubose Drilling, Inc. to construct a wa-
ter well nearby; Dubose subcontracted 
with Elite Drillers Corporation to com-
plete  the  water  well.  One  day,  a  “gas 
kick”  occurred  at  the  oil  well,  causing 
gas to migrate from the reservoir to the 
wellbore.  Three  days  later,  Bryce  J. 
Wallace,  Elite’s  president,  was  super-
vising work at the water well when he 
noticed an increase in air pressure. An 
explosion  followed,  damaging  Elite’s 
equipment  and  leaving  Wallace  se-
verely injured. 

Elite, Wallace, and Elite’s insur-
ers  (collectively,  “plaintiffs”)  sued  En-
ergen for negligence, gross negligence, 
and  trespass  to  chattels.  Energen 
moved  for  traditional  summary  judg-
ment,  asserting  that  Chapter  95—
which limits a property owner’s liabil-
ity  when  an  independent  contractor, 
hired  to  work  on  an  improvement  to 
real property, brings a negligence claim 
“aris[ing] from the condition or use” of 
that  improvement—applied  to  plain-
tiffs’  claims.  The  trial  court  granted 
Energen’s motion and rendered a take-
nothing  judgment.  After  determining 
that Energen failed to conclusively es-
tablish  Chapter  95’s  applicability,  the 
court  of  appeals  reversed  and  re-
manded. 

The Supreme Court reversed the 
court  of  appeals’  judgment  and  rein-
stated  the  trial  court’s  take-nothing 
judgment.  First,  the  Court  held  that 
Energen  conclusively  established  that 
Chapter 95 applies to plaintiffs’ claims. 
Although plaintiffs argued that it was 
negligent  activity  at  the  oil  well—ra-
ther than a dangerous condition of the 

water well—that caused their injuries, 
the  Court  concluded  the  characteriza-
tion of the claim was not dispositive. In-
stead, in determining Chapter 95’s ap-
plicability,  the  relevant  question  is 
whether negligence involving the “con-
dition  or  use”  of  the  improvement  on 
which the plaintiff was working caused 
the  plaintiff’s  damages.  And  even  if 
negligence  elsewhere  contributed  to 
the plaintiff’s injuries, the Court reiter-
ated  that  negligence  at  the  improve-
ment need not be the “only cause” of the 
plaintiff’s damages.  

The  Court  also  held  that  Ener-
gen conclusively established that it nei-
ther exercised nor retained control over 
plaintiffs’  work.  The  summary  judg-
ment record demonstrated that Dubose 
had contracted with Elite, and Wallace 
testified  that  he  had  never  spoken  to 
anyone  at  Energen.  Plaintiffs  argued 
that  Energen’s  senior  geologist  had 
made  recommendations  about  the  wa-
ter well, but such suggestions were not 
enough to establish control. As a result, 
Energen  could  not  be  liable  under 
Chapter 95. 

Justice Blacklock, joined by Jus-
tice Young, filed a concurring opinion. 
The  concurrence  agreed  that  Chapter 
95  applied  but  disagreed  with  the 
Court’s analysis. In particular, the con-
currence  would  have  used  the  plain 
text of the statute to conclude that the 
presence of natural gas (a condition) in 
the  water  well  (the  relevant  improve-
ment)  caused  the  plaintiffs’  injuries. 
According  to  the  concurrence,  the 
Court  overcomplicated  Chapter  95  by 
examining whether the negligence that 
caused  the  plaintiff’s  damages  “in-
volved” the improvement on which the 
plaintiff was working.

c)  United Supermarkets, LLC v. 
McIntire,  646  S.W.3d  800 
(Tex. June 17, 2022) (per cu-
riam) [21-0208] 

This case concerned whether an 
approximately  3/4-inch  divot  in  a  gro-
cery store parking lot presented an un-
reasonable risk of harm.  

United  owns  a  Market  Street 
grocery  store  in  Frisco.  Sherie  McIn-
tire, a regular customer, sustained se-
rious injuries when her heel caught in 
the divot in the Market Street parking 
lot  as  she  exited  her  truck.  McIntire 
sued United, asserting premises-defect 
claims. The trial court granted United’s 
motions  for  summary  judgment,  hold-
ing that the defect was not unreasona-
bly dangerous as a matter of law. The 
court  of  appeals  reversed  and  re-
manded. It reasoned that McIntire pro-
vided evidence that the divot’s size and 
shape indicated it posed an unreasona-
ble risk of harm, and that United failed 
to clearly mark the divot. Additionally, 
it  cited  McIntire’s  expert’s  report, 
which  reflected  that  United  disre-
garded  safety  standards  and  that  the 
defect could have caused McIntire’s in-
juries. 

In a per curiam opinion, the Su-
preme  Court  reversed  and  reinstated 
the trial court’s judgment, holding that 
the divot was not unreasonably danger-
ous as a matter of law. It noted that the 
divot measured less than an inch deep, 
no  evidence  indicated  it  had  produced 
other complaints or injuries, and noth-
ing  in  the  record  suggested  the  defect 
was  unusual  relative  to  other  small 
pavement  defects.  It  also  held  that  it 
could not conclude that McIntire’s acci-
dent  was  foreseeable  considering  that 
tiny surface defects in parking lots are 

ubiquitous and naturally occurring.  

Additionally,  the  Court  stated 
that  McIntire’s  expert’s  report  did  not 
alter  its  conclusion.  It  reasoned  that 
testimony that a condition could injure 
an  invitee  did  not  constitute  evidence 
that the condition posed an unreasona-
ble  risk  of  harm.  Moreover,  McIntire 
failed to submit evidence showing that 
the  safety  codes  referenced  in  the  ex-
pert  report  applied  to  the  Market 
Street  parking  lot  either  when  it  was 
constructed  or  on  the  date  of  the acci-
dent. 
 

 Public Utilities 
a)  CenterPoint  Energy  Res. 
Corp. v. Ramirez, 640 S.W.3d 
205  (Tex.  Feb.  11,  2022) 
[20-0354] 

The issue in this personal-injury 
case is whether a limitation of liability 
provision in a utility tariff approved by 
state regulators bars the utility’s liabil-
ity  for  damages  suffered  by  a  residen-
tial customer’s houseguests.  

these  visits, 

In  2011,  Adrian  and  Graciela 
Castillo  purchased  a  new  home.  Over 
the  next  three  years,  Graciela’s  par-
ents, Fernando and Minerva Ramirez, 
were frequent visitors and guests at the 
the 
home.  During 
Ramirezes used the home’s gas services 
for daily living activities. In 2015, while 
Fernando was attempting to repair the 
Castillos’  electric  clothes  dryer,  he  in-
advertently opened the valve on an un-
used gas line behind the dryer. Escap-
ing  gas  ignited,  resulting  in  an  explo-
sion that damaged the home and seri-
ously injured Fernando.  

The  Ramirezes  sued  the  home-
builder, the plumber, and the utility for 
under 
personal-injury 

damages 

71 
 

negligence  and  gross-negligence  theo-
ries. They alleged that all three defend-
ants had breached a duty to plug or seal 
the unused gas line. The plumber set-
tled;  the  trial  court  directed  a  verdict 
for  the  defendants  on  the  gross-negli-
gence  claims;  and  after  finding  all  of 
the  defendants  negligent  as  alleged, 
the 
jury  apportioned  responsibility 
60% to  the  homebuilder,  34% to  the 
utility, and 6% to the plumber.  

The  utility  filed  a  motion  for 
judgment notwithstanding the verdict, 
urging that the regulator-approved and 
filed utility tariff precludes liability for 
any portion of the Ramirezes’ damages. 
The  tariff  applies  to  “all  Consumers,” 
broadly  defined  to  “mean  a  person  or 
organization utilizing [the utility’s] ser-
vices or who wants to utilize [the util-
ity’s]  services.”  The  tariff  provides, 
without  exception,  that  the  utility 
“shall  not  be  liable  for  any  damage  or 
loss  caused  by  the  escape  of  gas  from 
Consumer’s housepiping or Consumer’s 
appliances”  and  defines  “housepiping” 
as  “[a]ll  pipe  and  attached  fittings 
which  convey  gas  from  the  outlet  side 
of the meter to the Consumer’s connec-
tion  for  gas  appliances.”  The  parties 
disputed  whether  the  tariff  applies  to 
anyone other than the utility’s custom-
ers  and  whether  the specific  provision 
at  issue  applies  regardless  of  the 
Ramirezes’  “consumer”  or  “customer” 
status. They also disputed the applica-
bility  of  another  liability  limitation 
that  was  subject  to  an  exception  the 
Ramirezes claimed to have established. 
The  trial  court  denied  the  util-
ity’s  motion 
the 
and 
Ramirezes  more  than  $6.9 million  in 
actual damages. On appeal, the home-
builder settled, and the court of appeals 

awarded 

affirmed the judgment against the util-
ity. It determined that the tariff did not 
apply to a customer’s houseguests and 
that,  as  a  general  proposition,  a  tariff 
only  governs  the  relationship  between 
the utility and its customer.  

The  Supreme  Court  reversed 
and  rendered  judgment  for  the  utility 
because (1) the tariff’s terms expressly 
apply  to  “all  consumers,”  (2) as  active 
users  of  the  utility’s  gas  services,  the 
houseguests  met  the  tariff’s  definition 
of  that  term,  and  (3) their  damages 
were caused by an excluded peril. The 
Court explained that a tariff approved 
by a regulatory body is not a “mere con-
tract”  and  instead  carries  “the  force 
and  effect”  of  law.  Accordingly,  the 
houseguests were bound by the tariff’s 
terms because, as consumers, the tariff 
applied to them and, like any other law, 
neither assent nor actual knowledge is 
required to enforce its terms as written.  
The Court also found no conflict 
between the tariff’s liability limitation 
and the local ordinances. An ordinance 
imposing  a  duty  is  not  inconsistent 
with a tariff provision limiting liability 
for  damages;  to  the  contrary,  they  are 
correlated with one another because a 
liability limitation only comes into play 
if the utility could be liable for violating 
some duty or obligation imposed by law 
or  contract.  Finally,  assuming  the 
open-courts  provision  was  implicated, 
the Court held that enforcement of the 
liability limitation did not infringe the 
Ramirezes’  constitutional  rights  be-
cause  the  tariff  did  not  withdraw  all 
remedies or avenues of redress or make 
a remedy by due course of law contin-
gent on an impossible condition.

 Vicarious Liability 
a)  Cameron  Int’l  Corp.  v.  Mar-
tinez,  ___  S.W.3d  ___,  2022 
WL  17998214  (Tex.  Dec.  30, 
2022) (per curiam) [21-0614] 
The issue in this case is whether 
an  oilfield  worker  traveling  for  per-
sonal  necessities  was  acting  in  the 
course  and  scope  of  his  employment 
such that the employer is vicariously li-
able for the worker’s alleged negligence 
in  connection  with  a  car  accident  en 
route. 

Cameron International Corpora-
tion hired John Mueller for a four-day 
job  at  a  remote  oil  well  worksite  near 
Orla,  Texas.  After  Mueller’s  last  con-
tracted workday, his supervisor invited 
him  to  eat  in  Pecos.  Mueller  drove  on 
his own to eat with his supervisor, fuel 
his truck, and restock his personal sup-
ply  of  food  and  water  to  bring  back  to 
the  worksite,  anticipating  contracting 
for  additional  work.  On  his  way  back, 
Mueller was involved in a deadly acci-
dent. The accident survivors and their 
estates  sued  Mueller,  Cameron,  and 
others  for  negligence,  and  sought  to 
hold Cameron liable under the doctrine 
of respondeat superior. 

Cameron  moved  for  summary 
judgment, arguing  that it was  not lia-
ble for worker travel that it did not con-
trol  or  direct.  The  trial  court  granted 
Cameron’s motion, but the court of ap-
peals  reversed.  The  court  of  appeals 
held  that  a  fact  issue  existed  as  to 
whether Mueller was on a special mis-
sion in the course and scope of his du-
ties for Cameron at the time of the ac-
cident. 

Cameron  petitioned  the  Su-
preme  Court  for  review,  arguing  that 
in 
court  of  appeals  erred 
the 

interpreting  the  special  mission  doc-
trine too broadly by applying it to a per-
sonal errand. The Court agreed and re-
versed,  reinstating  the  trial  court’s 
judgment in a per curiam opinion. The 
Court  emphasized  its  recent  state-
ments that an employer cannot be held 
vicariously liable for accidents that oc-
cur  while  a  worker  conducts  personal 
errands. The Court also declined to ex-
pand the scope of vicarious liability to 
match that of workers’ compensation li-
ability, and it reaffirmed past holdings 
that  workers’  compensation  liability 
uses a distinct framework and attaches 
in broader situations than common law 
vicarious liability. 
 

 

Drainage 

 Covenants to Protect Against 

a)  Rosetta Res. Operating, LP v. 
Martin, 645 S.W.3d 212 (Tex. 
May 6, 2022) [20-0898] 

This  oil  and  gas  dispute  con-
tained three issues: First, whether the 
lessee’s  obligation  to  protect  against 
drainage was triggered under a poorly 
drafted 
second, 
lease  addendum; 
whether the lessors were barred by res 
judicata from raising a lease-construc-
tion  argument  that  was  waived  in  a 
severed appeal; and third, whether the 
court  of  appeals  erroneously  reversed 
the trial court’s summary judgment for 
claims not challenged on appeal. 

The  Martins,  lessors-respond-
ents,  entered  into  a  mineral  lease 
agreement  (the  Martin  Lease)  with 
Mesquite Development, which later as-
signed  its  rights  to  lessee-petitioner 
Rosetta  Resources  Operating,  LP. 
Shortly  after  the  assignment,  Rosetta 
joined  Newfield  Exploration  Co.  and 

73 
 

Dynamic  Production,  Inc.  (collectively 
Newfield) to create a pooled unit which 
contained  the  northern  portion  of  the 
lease.  Newfield  subsequently  drilled  a 
well  on  the  pooled  unit  (the  Martin 
Well)  and  a  well  on  nearby  non-adja-
cent acreage (the Simmons Well).  

The  Martins  sued  both  Rosetta 
and Newfield under breach-of-contract, 
tort,  and  statutory  theories.  The  Mar-
tins argued that Rosetta and Newfield 
did  not  protect  against  drainage  from 
the  Simmons  Well  as  required  under 
an addendum to the Martin Lease. On 
individual  motions  for  summary  judg-
ment, the lessees argued that the Sim-
mons Well did not trigger an obligation 
to  protect  against  drainage  because  it 
was drilled on acreage that did not ad-
join  the  lease  acreage.  The  trial  court 
granted  summary  judgment  for  New-
field and severed the claims against it 
for appeal. During the Newfield appeal, 
the  Martins  argued  that  the  Martin 
Well  had  triggered  the  addendum’s 
covenant  to  protect  against  drainage 
from  the  Simmons  Well.  Concluding 
that such an argument was waived, the 
court  of  appeals  affirmed  the  trial 
court’s summary judgment because the 
Simmons  Well  did  not  trigger  the  ad-
dendum.  

After  the  Newfield  appeal  but 
before  ruling  on  Rosetta’s  summary 
judgment,  the  trial  court  invited  the 
Martins to raise the Martin-Well argu-
ment  in an  amended petition  and  mo-
tion  for  summary  judgment.  Denying 
the  Martins’  motion,  the  trial  court 
granted  summary  judgment  for  Ro-
setta  on  each  of  the  Martins’  claims. 
The  court  of  appeals  reversed  and  re-
manded,  granting  partial  summary 
judgment  for  the  Martins  because  the 

Martin Well triggered a general duty to 
protect against drainage and a specific 
duty  to  spud  an  offset  well  or  release 
the undrilled acreage.   

The  Supreme  Court  held  that 
the addendum is ambiguous regarding 
whether the Martin Well triggered Ro-
setta’s  obligation  to  protect  against 
drainage from the Simmons Well. Sec-
ond,  the  Court  held  that  res  judicata 
does not prevent the Martins from rais-
ing 
their  Martin-Well  argument 
against Rosetta. Third, the Court held 
that  the  court  of  appeals  erred  by  re-
versing  Rosetta’s  summary  judgment 
as  to  the  Martins’  tort  and  statutory 
claims.  Because  a  party  must  negate 
judgment 
each  possible  summary 
ground  and  Rosetta  established  eco-
nomic-loss-rule and no-benefit grounds 
for summary judgment on the Martins’ 
tort  and  statutory  claims,  the  court  of 
appeals  did  not  properly  reverse  sum-
mary judgment as to those claims.  

The  Court  reversed  the  court  of 
appeals  judgment,  reinstated  the  trial 
court’s summary judgment in part as to 
the Martins’ tort and statutory claims, 
and  remanded  for  further  proceedings 
on the Martins’ claim for breach of con-
tract.  
 

 Deed Construction 
a)  Van  Dyke  v.  Navigator  Grp., 
___  S.W.3d  ___,  2023  WL 
2053175 (Tex. Feb. 17, 2023) 
[21-0146] 

This dispute concerns whether a 
1924  deed  reserving  “one-half  of  one-
eighth” of the mineral estate reserved a 
1/2 interest or a 1/16 interest.  

In 1924, the Mulkey parties con-
veyed  their  ranch  and  the  underlying 
minerals  to  the  White  parties  with  a 

74 
 

reservation  of  “one-half  of  one-eighth” 
of  the  mineral  estate.  For  many  dec-
ades,  the  parties’  interactions  with 
each  other  and  in  transactions  with 
third parties reflected the understand-
ing  that  both  sides  had  a  1/2  interest. 
But in 2013, nearly 90 years after the 
deed, the White parties brought a tres-
pass-to-try-title  action  asserting  that 
the deed had reserved only a 1/16 inter-
est.  The  Mulkey  parties  assert  that 
they possess a 1/2 interest today for one 
of  two  reasons.  Either  the  deed  re-
served  that  1/2  interest  all  along,  or 
else, even if it originally reserved only 
a 1/16 interest, the other 7/16 must be 
recognized  by  operation  of  the  pre-
sumed-grant  doctrine.  The  trial  court 
granted  the  White  parties’  motion  for 
partial  summary  judgment  and  de-
clared that the deed unambiguously re-
served a 1/16 interest. The court of ap-
peals  affirmed,  holding  that  the  deed 
unambiguously  conveyed  15/16  of  the 
mineral estate to the White parties and 
that  the  presumed-grant  doctrine  did 
not apply.  

The  Supreme  Court  reversed. 
First, the Court held that the text of the 
1924 deed reserved the Mulkey parties 
a  1/2  interest  in  the  mineral  estate. 
Terms  must  be  given  the  plain  mean-
ing that they bore at the time they were 
written. Thus, the reservation depends 
on whether the use of “1/8” in a double-
fraction 
reflected  an  arithmetical 
meaning in 1924. The Court held that 
the  double-fraction  instead  reflects  a 
contemporary  term  of  art,  as  the  es-
tate-misconception theory and the use 
of  1/8  as  the  standard  royalty  show. 
The  Court  thus  applied  a  rebuttable 
presumption  that  instruments  from 
this  time  used  1/8  within  a  double-

fraction  to  refer  to  the  entire  mineral 
estate. Nothing in the text or structure 
of the deed in question rebuts that pre-
sumption,  so  the  1924  deed’s  reserva-
tion of “one-half of one-eighth” reserved 
1/2 of the mineral estate.    

In  rare  cases,  the  presumed-
grant doctrine recognizes that the orig-
inal instrument does not accurately re-
flect current ownership. The Court ad-
dressed that doctrine and held that the 
parties’  extensive  and  unbroken  his-
tory  of  recognizing  and  acting  in  reli-
ance on a 1/2–1/2 split meant that the 
Mulkey parties had obtained the rest of 
a 1/2 interest at some point after 1924 
even  if  the  deed  had  reserved  only  a 
1/16 interest.  

The Court therefore reversed the 
judgment of the court of appeals and re-
manded  to  the  trial  court  for  further 
proceedings  that  will  lead  to  a  final 
judgment.  
 

 Royalty Payments   
a)  Nettye  Engler  Energy,  LP  v. 
BlueStone Nat. Res. II, LLC, 
639 S.W.3d 682 (Tex. Feb. 4, 
2022) [20-0639] 

This  mineral  dispute  involves 
the construction of an oil-and-gas deed 
with  respect  to  the  delivery  point  for 
calculating  a  royalty.  The  issue  is 
whether  and  to  what  extent  a  royalty 
interest bears a proportionate share of 
postproduction costs.  

The predecessors of Nettye Eng-
ler Energy, LP conveyed a tract of land, 
reserving  a  one-eighth  nonparticipat-
ing  in-kind  royalty  interest  in  miner-
als. The relevant deed language states 
the  royalty  is  “free  of  cost  in  the  pipe 
line, if any, otherwise free of cost at the 
mouth  of  the  well  or  mine.”  Such  an 

75 
 

interest is free of  production costs but 
bears its proportional share of postpro-
duction costs from the point of delivery 
to the royalty interest holder unless the 
conveyance  specifies  otherwise.  Ini-
tially,  the  wellsite  operator  that  pre-
ceded BlueStone Natural Resources II, 
LLC sold Engler’s share of production, 
valuing it at the point of sale to the gas 
purchaser’s  pipeline,  which  rendered 
the royalty free of postproduction costs. 
But  when  BlueStone  assumed  opera-
tions, it began valuing Engler’s share of 
production  in  the  onsite  gathering 
pipeline,  thus  burdening  the  royalty 
with  postproduction  costs  from  that 
point  forward.  Engler’s  royalty  pay-
ments  decreased,  and  Engler  sued 
BlueStone  for  common-law  conversion 
and money had and received. The par-
ties  agreed  that  some  gas  pipeline  ex-
ists, and that the royalty is free of pro-
duction costs and postproduction costs 
incurred before delivery into that pipe-
line, but they disagreed about the loca-
tion of the pipeline. Engler argued that 
the deed could only refer to offsite pipe-
lines,  like  downstream  transportation 
or  distribution  pipelines,  because  a 
gathering  pipeline  is  not  a  “pipe  line” 
as  the  term is  used  in  the  deed.  Blue-
Stone  argued  that  gathering  pipelines 
are  pipelines  in  both  ordinary  and 
trade meaning, so it was proper to cal-
culate  the  royalty  interest  as  bearing 
postproduction costs after that point.  

On  cross-motions  for  summary 
judgment, the trial court held Engler’s 
royalty interest was free of cost in the 
transportation  pipeline,  and  thus  free 
of  some  but  not  all  postproduction 
costs.  The  court  awarded  Engler 
$88,849.33  in  actual  damages.  Blue-
Stone  appealed,  and  the  court  of 

appeals  reversed  and  rendered  judg-
ment  in  BlueStone’s  favor.  The  court 
viewed Burlington Resources Oil & Gas 
Co.  v.  Texas  Crude  Energy,  LLC,  573 
S.W.3d 198 (Tex. 2019), as establishing 
a rule equating “into the pipeline” deed 
language  with  a  delivery  or  valuation 
point “at the wellhead or nearby.” For 
this reason, and because the court con-
cluded  that  a  gathering  system  is  a 
pipeline,  the  court  held  that  the  deed 
language at issue essentially created a 
delivery point at the wellhead. The Su-
preme  Court  affirmed  but  disagreed 
that  Burlington  Resources  established 
such a rule, concluding instead that the 
opinion  merely  emphasized  that  all 
contracts,  including  mineral  convey-
ances, are construed  as a whole to as-
certain the parties’ intent from the lan-
guage they used to express their agree-
ment.  Thus,  when  construing  an 
oil-and-gas deed, the standard rules of 
contract  construction  apply,  and  a 
deed’s language is given its plain mean-
ing  unless  the  instrument  shows  the 
parties agreed otherwise. An expert af-
fidavit  opining  on  the  meaning  of  the 
deed language did not elucidate the un-
derstanding  of  the  words  at  the  time 
the deed was executed and would only 
have impermissibly added limiting lan-
guage  to  modify  the  terms.  Accord-
ingly, the Court did not consider it.  

Following  the  standard  rules  of 
contract  construction,  the  Court  ob-
served that a gas gathering pipeline is 
a “pipe line” in common, industry, and 
regulatory  parlance.  Case  law  further 
confirms  that  mineral  conveyances 
commonly  contemplate  delivery  into 
onsite pipelines “connected to the well.” 
The  absence  of  similar  limiting  lan-
guage  in  the  deed  did  not  narrow  the 

76 
 

ordinary  meaning  of  the  term  “pipe 
line.” The deed did not exclude a gath-
ering pipeline from the usual meaning 
of  the  term,  specify  a  particular  pipe-
line, or otherwise negate delivery at or 
near  the  wellsite.  Accordingly,  Blue-
Stone satisfied its obligation to deliver 
Engler’s  share  of  production  “free  of 
cost in the pipe line” by deducting post-
production costs incurred after delivery 
in the gas gathering system from gross 
sales  proceeds  in  accounting  for  the 
value of Engler’s nonparticipating roy-
alty interest.

 Trust  Modification  Proceed-

a)  In  re  Troy  S.  Poe  Trust,  646 
S.W.3d  771  (Tex.  June  17, 
2022) [20-0179] 

The  issue  in  this  case  was 
whether  there  is  a  right  to  a  trial  by 
jury  in  a  judicial  trust-modification 
proceeding under Texas Property Code 
Section 112.054. 

Dick  Poe  established  a  trust  to 
provide  for  the  needs  of  his  son, Troy. 
The trust required that trustees make 
decisions unanimously and designated 
as trustees Dick, his other son Richard, 
and his accountant Anthony Bock. Af-
ter  Dick  died,  Bock  filed  a  petition  in 
the probate court seeking modification 
of the trust under Section 112.054, and 
Troy (acting through an attorney ad li-
tem)  supported  the  modification  re-
quest.  Richard  opposed  modification 
and demanded a jury trial on all triable 
issues. The probate court denied Rich-
ard’s  jury  demand,  conducted  a  bench 
trial,  and  ordered  that  the  trust  be 

modified.  

The  court  of  appeals  reversed 
and remanded the case for a new trial, 
concluding that Richard was entitled to 
a jury trial on the predicate questions 
of whether the trust needed to be mod-
ified.  The  court  of  appeals  noted  that 
the  Constitution’s  Judiciary  Article 
provides  a  jury  right  in  “causes”  and 
that  the  Legislature  is  authorized  to 
regulate  jury  trials.  The  court  of  ap-
peals  then  reasoned  that  Texas  Prop-
erty  Code  Section  115.012  “generally 
provides for jury trials” by incorporat-
ing the Rules of Civil Procedure into ac-
tions brought under the Trust Code. 

The  Supreme  Court  reversed, 
holding  that  there  was  no  statutory 
right  to  a  trial  by  jury  in  a  judicial 
trust-modification  proceeding.  The 
Court noted that Section 112.054 does 
not provide for or even mention a jury, 
and it held that the Trust Code’s incor-
poration of the Rules of Civil Procedure 
could not be construed to create a jury 
right  where  one  did  not  already  exist. 
Additionally, the Court concluded Bock 
and  Troy  preserved  their  complaint 
that the Constitution does not require 
a  jury  trial  in  judicial  trust-modifica-
tion proceedings by raising those argu-
ments  in  their  motion  for  rehearing 
and petitions for review. But the court 
of appeals never addressed those argu-
ments.  Noting  that  it  was  not  the 
Court’s ordinary practice to be the first 
forum for novel questions, the Court re-
manded the case to the court of appeals 
for consideration of petitioners’ consti-
tutional  arguments  in  the  first  in-
stance.  

Justice Busby filed a concurring 
opinion,  joined  by  Justice  Devine  and 
Justice Young. The concurrence agreed 

77 
 

with the Court’s statutory analysis and 
decision to remand but noted the need 
for  a  coherent  framework  for  evaluat-
ing the scope of the Constitution’s guar-
antees  of  a  trial  by  jury  and  provided 
an  overview  of  the  Court’s  precedents 
for  consideration  in  future  disputes 
over whether the Constitution provides 
a right to a jury in a particular proceed-
ing. 

 
 Will Construction 
a)  Jordan v. Parker, ___ S.W.3d 
___, 2022 WL 17998227 (Tex. 
Dec. 30, 2022) [21-0205] 
This  case  presents  the  issue  of 
whether  a  conveyance  of  “all  of  my 
right, title and interest” in a ranch in-
cluded the grantor’s remainder interest 
in an estate that held an interest in the 
same ranch.  

interest 

J. Loyd Parker Jr. left a life es-
tate to his widow, Ruthie Parker, with 
a remainder in the estate to their two 
children.  The  estate  included  many 
real  estate  holdings,  including  a  one-
fourth 
in  the  Cottonwood 
Ranch.  Loyd  Jr.’s  son,  Loyd  III,  sepa-
rately  owned  a  one-eighth  fee  simple 
interest in the Cottonwood Ranch. Dur-
ing his mother’s lifetime, Loyd III con-
veyed  “all  of  my  right,  title  and  inter-
est”  in  the  Cottonwood  Ranch  to  his 
daughters,  Elise  and  Allison,  in  equal 
shares. Loyd III died and left his entire 
estate to his wife, Kathy. 

After  Loyd  III’s  death,  Elise 
claimed a right to a one-sixteenth inter-
est in the Cottonwood Ranch from Loyd 
III’s  remainder  interest  that  followed 
Ruthie’s life estate. Kathy sued Elise to 
resolve  this  claim,  and  the  trial  court 
granted  summary  judgment  to  Elise. 
The  court  of  appeals  reversed.  It  held 

that  Loyd  III’s  deed,  executed  during 
his  mother’s  lifetime,  did  not  convey 
any  remainder  interest  that  followed 
her life estate. The court of appeals re-
lied on the rule that a grantor may con-
vey a future interest only by clear and 
express  language  demonstrating  the 
intent to do so. 

The  Supreme  Court  affirmed. 
The Court held that, because Loyd Jr.’s 
will gave the life tenant expansive pow-
ers to sell or give away estate holdings, 
Loyd III had only an expectancy in any 
particular piece of estate property dur-
ing Ruthie’s life tenancy. The Court re-
affirmed the longstanding rule that an 
expectancy  or  future  interest  may  be 
conveyed  only  through  language  that 
clearly  manifests  the  grantor’s  intent 
to convey it. Therefore, when Loyd III 
conveyed all his right, title, and inter-
est in the Cottonwood Ranch through a 
deed that did not expressly refer to his 
expectancy,  he  conveyed  only  the  fee 
simple interest he owned at the time. 
 

 

 Appellate Deadlines 
a)  Mitschke  v.  Borromeo  & 
Blackjack  Ranch  L.L.E., 
LLC,  645  S.W.3d  251  (Tex. 
May  13,  2022)  [21-0326,  21-
0331]  

This case answers two questions 
about  appellate  procedure:  first,  if 
there  is  a  conflict  within  transferor-
court case law, how does the transferee 
court resolve it; second, if a party files 
a motion for new trial in the incorrect 
cause number but the motion is other-
wise  proper,  does  that  motion  extend 
the  appellate  deadlines  under  Rule 
26.1.  

Mitschke’s  son  died  in  an  all-

78 
 

vehicle 

accident. 

Later 
terrain 
Mitschke  sued  Borromeo,  Blackjack, 
and several other defendants for negli-
gent  entrustment,  negligent  training 
and  supervision,  and  negligent  under-
taking.  Opposing  those  claims,  Borro-
meo and Blackjack successfully moved 
for summary judgment, then moved to 
sever. The trial court granted the sev-
erance motion. Severing made the prior 
summary  judgment  order  a  final,  ap-
pealable  order.  Mitschke  moved  for  a 
new trial to extend the appellate dead-
lines.  

When Mitschke moved for a new 
trial, he did so in the original cause ra-
ther  than  the  severed  cause.  In  an  ef-
fort to save the cases, Mitschke filed a 
notice  of  appeal  in  both  causes  three 
days  before  the  would-be  extended 
deadlines.  The  case  was  transferred 
from the Third Court of Appeals to the 
Seventh.  The  Seventh  asked  the  par-
ties  to  brief  the  possible  jurisdictional 
defect  of  a  late  appeal.  In  addressing 
timeliness,  the  parties  revealed  con-
flicting  case  law  in  the  Third  Court. 
The Seventh Court decided later Third 
Court precedent should control and dis-
missed the case for want of jurisdiction.   

The Supreme Court of Texas re-
versed  and  remanded  for  proceedings 
on the merits. The Court first held that 
the Seventh Court ought to have relied 
upon the earlier Third Court precedent 
unless  there  was  some  intervening 
change  in  the  law by  a  higher  court—
including  the  Third  Court  sitting  en 
banc—or legislative change.  

Next,  the  Court  held  Mitschke’s 
motion for new trial extended both the 
trial court’s plenary power under Texas 
Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  329b  and  the 
appellate timelines under Rule 26.1(a). 

The  Court  recognized  a  long  line  of 
cases that require reading the rules of 
appellate and civil procedure to find ju-
risdiction and reach the merits.   
 

judgment  to  vacate  the  trial  court’s 
judgment.  The  Court  dismissed  the 
case and affirmed the court of appeals’ 
judgment as modified.  
 

 Dismissal 
a)  Alsobrook  v.  MTGLQ  Invs., 
LP,  656  S.W.3d  394  (Tex. 
Nov.  18,  2022)  (per  curiam) 
[22-0079] 

This  case  concerns  the  proper 
procedure for dismissal when a case be-
comes moot prior to the filing of the ap-
peal.  Mortgagee  MTGLQ  Investors 
sought  to  foreclose  on  Courtney  Al-
sobrook’s property. Alsobrook filed suit 
and  obtained  a  temporary  injunction. 
After  the  injunction  expired  and  Al-
sobrook did not move to extend it, the 
trial court granted summary judgment 
in  MTGLQ’s  favor,  and  MTGLQ  suc-
cessfully foreclosed on the property.  

Alsobrook  appealed.  MTGLQ 
moved  to  dismiss  the  appeal  as  moot 
because  Alsobrook  was  no  longer  the 
owner of the property. The court of ap-
peals  granted  the  motion  and  dis-
missed  the  appeal.  Alsobrook  then 
sought  review  in  the  Supreme  Court, 
arguing  that  the  court  of  appeals 
should  have  also  vacated  the  trial 
court’s judgment. 

In a per curiam opinion, the Su-
preme Court held that the court of ap-
peals  erred  by  failing  to  vacate  the 
lower court’s judgment. The Court reit-
erated its long-standing practice of set-
ting  aside  all  previous  orders  when  a 
case  becomes  moot  on  appeal.  The 
Court also held that, under Rule of Ap-
pellate  Procedure  43.2(f),  the  court  of 
appeals  should  have  dismissed  the 
“case,”  not  the  “appeal.”  The  Court 
therefore modified the court of appeals’

b)  Durden  v.  Shahan,  658 
S.W.3d  300  (Tex.  Dec.  30, 
2022)  (per  curiam)  [21-1003, 
21-1017, 21-1018] 

The  issues  in  this  case  are  (1) 
whether a county attorney has author-
ity  to  initiate  a  Texas  Open  Meetings 
Act suit in the name of the State; and 
(2) whether the attorney made a bona 
fide attempt to invoke the court of ap-
peals’ jurisdiction with respect to sanc-
tions imposed against the attorney per-
sonally.  

County  Attorney  Todd  Durden 
filed  three  lawsuits  on  behalf  of  the 
State of Texas that alleged violations of 
the  Texas  Open  Meetings  Act  by  Kin-
ney  County  officials.  The  trial  court 
concluded  that  Durden  lacked  author-
ity to file the suits on the State’s behalf. 
The court dismissed all three cases and 
sanctioned  Durden  personally  by  or-
dering  him  to  pay  the  defendants’  at-
torney’s fees and costs. Durden filed a 
notice  of  appeal  that  stated  that 
Durden, in his official capacity, was ap-
pealing as to all issues and all parties 
affected by the order. The court of ap-
peals  affirmed,  agreeing  that  Durden 
lacked authority and refusing to reach 
the  merits  of  his  sanctions  complaint 
because he failed to file a notice of ap-
peal in his individual capacity. 

In a per curiam opinion, the Su-
preme  Court  affirmed  the  part  of  the 
court  of  appeals’  judgment  dismissing 
Durden’s  Texas  Open  Meetings  Act 
suits  because  he  lacked  authority  to 
bring them, but the Court reversed the

This petition presented the issue 
of whether a court of appeals abused its 
discretion by denying a petition for per-
missive  interlocutory  appeal.  In  a  per

S.W.3d

(Tex.  Nov.  18, 
2022)  (per  curiam)  [21-0130, 
21-0133] 

___, 

The  issue  addressed  in  this  per 

part  of  the  judgment  that  dismissed 
Durden’s  appeal  of  the  sanctions  im-
posed  against  him  personally.  The 
Court  first  held  that  while  the  Texas 
Constitution  authorizes  county  attor-
neys  to  represent  the  State  in  some 
cases,  that  authority  to  represent  the 
State does not include the authority to 
independently decide whether to insti-
tute  a  suit  on  the  State’s  behalf.  The 
Legislature  must  specifically  provide 
that authority by statute. The Court re-
jected Durden’s argument that TOMA’s 
language  authorizing  any  “interested 
person” to sue provides authority for a 
county attorney to bring a TOMA suit 
on  the  State’s  behalf.  The  Court  then 
turned  to  the  dismissal  of  Durden’s 
sanctions appeal. After reiterating the 
rule that appeals should be decided on 
the  merits  rather  than  dismissed  for 
procedural  defect,  the  Court  held  that 
the  court  of  appeals  should  have  ac-
cepted Durden’s appeal from the sanc-
tions order or permitted him to amend 
the  notices  of  appeal  because  Durden 
made a bona fide attempt to invoke the 
court’s 
jurisdiction.  The  Court  re-
manded the case to the court of appeals 
for further proceedings.

Vela,  647  S.W.3d  709  (Tex. 
June  30,  2022)  (per  curiam) 
[21-0901]  

This petition presented the issue 
of whether a court of appeals abused its 
discretion by denying a petition for per-
missive  interlocutory  appeal.  In  a  per 
curiam  opinion  denying  review,  the 
Court  noted  that  the  court  of  appeals’ 
opinion  failed  to  advise  the  parties  of 
the  basic  reasons  for  its  decision  to 

80 
 

curiam  opinion  is  whether  the  Gover-
nor may appoint and commission sub-
stitute justices to participate in the Su-
preme Court’s determination of a case 
in which the State of Texas is a party. 
The State filed suits against sev-
eral related entities, including two Ger-
man  companies  (Volkswagen  Aktieng-
esellschaft  and  Audi  Aktiengesell-
schaft),  for  alleged  violations  of  state 
environmental laws. The German enti-
ties filed special appearances challeng-
ing  the  court’s  exercise  of  personal  ju-
risdiction  over  them,  which  the  trial 
court denied. Divided courts of appeals 
reversed  and  dismissed  the  State’s 
claims  against  the  German  entities. 
The State filed petitions for review. The 
Court granted the petitions and consol-
idated  them  for  oral  argument,  which 
was held on February 22, 2022. 

While  the  cases  were  pending, 
two of the Court’s nine justices recused 
sua  sponte.  Relying  on  Government 
Code Section 22.005, the Chief Justice 
requested  that  the  Governor  commis-
sion two new justices to participate in 
the  determination  of  these  cases.  The 
German entities objected to this proce-
dure on various grounds. They argued 
that  if  the  seven  remaining  justices 
cannot  reach  a  five-justice  majority, 
the Court should dismiss the petitions 
as improvidently granted. 

The  Court  denied  the  German 
entities’ objections. The Court first held 
that the Governor’s appointment of jus-
tices  to  participate  in  determining 
these cases would not allow the State to 
be the judge of its own cause. The Gov-
ernor is not the party bringing the un-
derlying lawsuit—the suit was brought 
by the Attorney General at the request 
on 
the  Texas  Commission 
of 

81 
 

Environmental Quality. The Court con-
cluded that party status cannot be im-
puted  on  the  Governor  and  the  mere 
fact that justices are appointed by the 
Governor is no basis for claiming they 
would  be  acting  on  the  State’s  behalf. 
The  Court  next  held  that  the  Gover-
nor’s  appointments  do  not  violate  due 
process.  Neither  the  Governor  nor  the 
appointed justices have the type of per-
sonal or pecuniary interest in the out-
come of these cases that would create a 
serious,  objective  risk  of  actual  bias. 
And adopting the German entities’ the-
ory would prohibit the appointment of 
any substitute justice, which could pre-
vent the Court from resolving the case. 
Finally,  the  Court  concluded  that 
Texas’s  procedural  rules  and  ethical 
canons  do  not  require  the  automatic 
disqualification  or  recusal  of  any  jus-
tice  appointed  by  the  Governor.  The 
mere  fact  that  the  Governor  selected 
the justices to participate in these cases 
would not create in reasonable minds a 
perception that these justices would be 
unable  to  carry  out  their  responsibili-
ties  with  integrity,  impartiality,  and 
competence. 
 

 Jurisdiction 
a)  Chen  v.  Razberi  Tech.,  Inc., 
645 S.W.3d 773 (Tex. May 27, 
2022) [21-0499] 

The issue on appeal was whether 
the  court  of  appeals  retained  jurisdic-
tion to determine the merits of a live ju-
risdictional  dispute  after  an  order  on 
interlocutory  appeal  merged  into  a  fi-
nal  judgment  that  was  not  subse-
quently appealed.  

Razberi Technologies, Inc. had a 
business  relationship  with  a  Taiwan-
ese  company,  DynaColor.  When  the 

relationship  soured,  Razberi  sued 
DynaColor  and  its  Taiwanese  CEO, 
Warren  Chen  (collectively,  Chen)  in 
Texas. Chen specially appeared to chal-
lenge  personal  jurisdiction.  After  the 
trial  court  denied  the  special  appear-
ances, Chen filed an accelerated inter-
locutory appeal. While the appeal was 
pending, the trial court rendered final 
judgment in Razberi’s favor on the mer-
its,  and  Chen  did  not  appeal  the  final 
judgment. Razberi then filed a motion 
to dismiss the pending appeal as moot 
because  the  order  on  appeal  had 
merged  into  the  final  judgment.  The 
appellate  court  agreed  and  dismissed 
Chen’s appeal as moot without resolv-
ing  the  still-live  jurisdictional  issue. 
The  court  held  that  Chen  could  have 
raised the jurisdictional issue by filing 
a  separate appeal  from  the  final judg-
ment but chose not to do so.  

Chen moved for rehearing citing 
Texas  Rule  of  Appellate  Procedure 
27.3, which applies to an order or judg-
ment  on  appeal  that  is  subsequently 
modified or vacated. Rule 27.3 requires 
an appellate court to treat the pending 
appeal  “as  from  the  subsequent  order 
or 
judgment.”  The  appellate  court 
granted  rehearing  and  withdrew  its 
original opinion in Chen I, but on sec-
ond  rehearing,  the  court  reversed 
course and reinstated its original opin-
ion.  

The  Supreme  Court  reversed 
and remanded to the court of appeals to 
consider  the  merits  of  the  special  ap-
pearances. The Court held that, under 
Rule 27.3,  a  second  “protective”  notice 
of appeal from the final judgment was 
not necessary for the appellate court to 
maintain  its  pre-existing  jurisdiction 
over the still-live jurisdictional dispute. 

82 
 

Rule 27.3 prevented an appeal from an 
interlocutory jurisdictional ruling from 
becoming  moot  when  it  merged  into  a 
final  judgment,  and  further  accords 
with the general principle that “a court 
of appeals has jurisdiction over any ap-
peal in which the appellant files an in-
strument in a bona fide attempt to in-
voke the appellate court’s jurisdiction.”  
Because  Chen  timely  appealed  the  ju-
risdictional ruling, the court of appeals 
erred in dismissing the appeal as moot 
solely because the order on appeal sub-
sequently  merged  into  the  final  judg-
ment. A second notice of appeal was not 
required  unless  the  parties  wished  to 
expand the scope of the appeal beyond 
the issues encompassed by the pending 
appeal.  
 

 Permissive Interlocutory Ap-

peals 

a)  Indus. 

Specialists 

v. 
Blanchard  Refining  Co.,  652 
S.W.3d  11  (Tex.  June  10, 
2022) [20-0174]  

 
The issue presented in this case 
is whether a court of appeals abused its 
discretion either by denying a petition 
for  permissive  interlocutory  appeal  or 
by  failing  to  explain  its  reasons  for  so 
doing. 
 
Blanchard  Refining  Company 
hired  Industrial  Specialists  to  provide 
turnaround services at Blanchard’s re-
finery  in  Texas  City.  A  workplace  fire 
injured  several  employees,  who  sued 
Blanchard. After the parties settled the 
employees’ claims, Blanchard filed suit 
to enforce an indemnity provision in its 
contract  with  Industrial  Specialists. 
The trial court denied the parties’ com-
peting summary-judgment motions but 
Specialists’ 
granted 

Industrial 

unopposed motion to pursue a permis-
sive interlocutory appeal under section 
51.014(d)  of  the  Texas  Civil  Practice 
and  Remedies  Code.  The  court  of  ap-
peals denied Industrial Specialists’ pe-
tition  for  permissive  appeal.  In  a  one-
page  memorandum  opinion,  the  court 
concluded that “the petition fail[ed] to 
establish  each  requirement”  for  a  per-
missive  appeal.  On  appeal  to  the  Su-
preme Court, both parties argued that 
the  court  of  appeals abused  its  discre-
tion  by  refusing  to  accept  the  appeal 
and by failing to adequately explain its 
reasons for that decision.  
 
The  Court  disagreed  with  the 
parties  and  affirmed  the  court  of  ap-
peals.  Section  51.014(f)  of  the  Texas 
Civil Practice and Remedies Code says 
that a court of appeals “may” accept a 
permissive  appeal  if  the  appealing 
party timely files a petition “explaining 
why an appeal is warranted under Sub-
section (d).” Section 51.014(d) says trial 
courts  “may”  permit  an  interlocutory 
appeal if (1) the order “involves a con-
trolling  question  of  law  as  to  which 
there is a substantial ground for differ-
ence of opinion,” and (2) “an immediate 
appeal  from  the  order  may  materially 
advance  the  ultimate  termination  of 
the litigation.” Based on this clear stat-
utory language, a majority of the Court 
held  that  section  51.014(f)  permits 
courts of appeals to accept a permissive 
interlocutory  appeal  when  the  two  re-
quirements  of  section  51.014(d)  are 
met, but it grants the courts discretion 
to reject the appeal even when the re-
quirements are met. A plurality of the 
Court agreed that the court of appeals’ 
opinion  satisfied  Texas  Rule  of  Appel-
late  Procedure  47.4,  which  requires 

83 
 

that  memorandum  opinions  give  the 
court’s “basic reasons” for its decision. 
 
Justice Blacklock filed a concur-
ring  opinion,  in  which  Justice  Bland 
joined,  concluding  that  the  Court’s 
precedent  in  Sabre  Travel  Interna-
tional, Ltd. v. Deutsche Lufthansa AG, 
567 S.W.3d 725, 732 (Tex. 2019), which 
held  that  section  51.014(f)  grants  “ab-
solute” discretion to courts of appeals to 
deny permissive appeals, ought to have 
disposed of this case. The concurrence 
thus joined the Court’s holding that the 
court  of  appeals  did  not  abuse  its  dis-
cretion  by  denying  the  appeal  and 
would  have  further  held  that  neither 
section 51.014(f) nor rule 47.4 required 
it to explain its reasons for doing so.  
 
Justice Busby filed a dissenting 
opinion,  in  which  Chief  Justice  Hecht 
and Justice Young joined, arguing that 
the  court  of  appeals abused  its  discre-
tion. First, it acted arbitrarily and un-
reasonably by failing to adhere to guid-
ing  principles  in  its  decision,  as  evi-
denced  by  its  denial  of  the  permissive 
appeal  when  the  two  requirements  of 
section 51.014(d) were objectively met. 
Further, it failed to adequately explain 
the reasons for its decision as required 
by both section 51.014 and rule 47.4.

 Preservation of Error 
a)  Browder 

v.  Moree,  659 
S.W.3d  421  (Tex.  June  24, 
2022) (per curiam) [21-0691] 
in  this  case  was 
whether a party, after obtaining an ad-
verse  ruling  on  his  request  for  a  jury 
trial,  must  also  object  to  that  adverse 
ruling  to  preserve  the  issue  for  appel-
review.  Bramlette  Holland 
late 
Browder  sought  conservatorship  and 
possession  of  Kelly,  the  biological 

daughter of Rachel Moree and Clarence 
Dean  Hinds,  Jr.  Although  Browder  is 
not  related  to Kelly, he  lived  with  her 
and became a father figure to her dur-
ing the course of his six-year relation-
ship with Moree.  

On  November  26,  2018,  Hinds 
appeared before the trial court and re-
quested a continuance. The trial court 
agreed  to  recess  the  case  until  early 
March 2019, and on February 1, 2019, 
Browder  filed  a  written  demand  for  a 
jury  trial.  In  a  letter  ruling,  the  trial 
court  denied  Browder’s  demand,  con-
cluding  that  Browder  had  waived  his 
jury  demand  by  failing  to  make  it  be-
fore the bench trial began in November 
2018.  The  court  of  appeals  affirmed, 
but it did so for a different reason. Ac-
cording  to  the  court  of  appeals, 
Browder did not preserve the jury issue 
for appeal because he failed to object to 
the trial court’s denial of his request or 
to  the  trial  court’s  decision  to  proceed 
with a bench trial.  

The  Supreme  Court  denied 
Browder’s  petition  for  review,  and 
Browder  filed  a  motion  for  rehearing. 
In  a  per  curiam  opinion,  the  Supreme 
Court  denied  Browder’s  motion  for  re-
hearing.  After  determining  that  the 
trial court did not abuse its discretion 
in  denying  Browder’s  demand  as  un-
timely, the Court disapproved the court 
of  appeals’  holding  that  Browder 
needed to object to the trial court’s de-
nial of his jury demand to preserve the 
jury issue for appeal. Because Browder 
had already obtained an adverse ruling 
from the trial court on his jury demand, 
he did not need to object to that ruling 
to preserve his complaint.

 Vacatur  
a)  Tex. Dep’t of Family & Protec-
tive  Servs.  v.  N.J.,  644 
S.W.3d  189  (Tex.  Apr.  22, 
2022) [20-0940] 

The issue in this case is whether 
the  Supreme  Court  should  vacate  the 
court  of  appeals’  opinion  after  part  of 
the case became moot on appeal. 

The  Department  of  Family  and 
Protective  Services  initiated  termina-
tion  proceedings  against  15-year-old 
N.J. three months after she gave birth. 
N.J. was never served with citation of 
the  petition.  The  case  went  to  trial, 
which  N.J.  participated  in  personally 
and through her court-appointed attor-
ney ad litem. The jury returned a ver-
dict terminating N.J.’s parental rights 
and appointing the Department as the 
child’s managing conservator. 

The  court  of  appeals  reversed 
and remanded the case for a new trial, 
concluding  that  the  trial  court  lacked 
personal  jurisdiction  over  N.J.  The 
court  held  that  N.J.  could  not  waive 
service  or  consent  to  the  court’s  juris-
diction because she is a minor. 

The  Department  petitioned  for 
review. While the case was pending in 
the Supreme Court, N.J., now 18, exe-
cuted an affidavit relinquishing her pa-
rental rights. The Department declined 
to notify the Court of this development 
for over a year, and the Court granted 
the petition for review. Ten days before 
argument,  the  Department  moved  to 
(1) dismiss the appeal as moot, (2) va-
cate the court of appeals’ judgment, (3) 
vacate  the  trial  court’s  judgment  in 
part,  and  (4)  vacate  the  court  of  ap-
peals’ opinion. 

The Supreme Court granted the 
Department’s  motion  in  part.  The 

Court held that the portion of the case 
appealed  by  N.J.  was  moot.  Accord-
ingly, the Court vacated the court of ap-
peals’ judgment and the portion of the 
trial  court’s 
judgment  terminating 
N.J.’s parental rights. But the Court re-
jected the Department’s request to va-
cate the court of appeals’ opinion. The 
Court  concluded  that  vacatur  of  the 
court of appeals’ opinion did not serve 
the  public  interest  because  (1)  a  par-
ent’s  decision  to  voluntarily  terminate 
his  or  her  parental  rights  is  not  one 
that would be motivated by a desire to 
manipulate precedent, and (2) the De-
partment substantially delayed notify-
ing  the  Court  of  the  events  that  ren-
dered the case moot. 

Justice Lehrmann filed a concur-
ring  opinion.  The  concurrence  agreed 
with  the  Court’s  opinion  but  empha-
sized that the Court’s decision to let the 
court of appeals’ opinion stand was not 
an endorsement of its rationale or hold-
ing.  
 

 

 Discovery 
a)  In re Auburn Creek L.P., 655 
S.W.3d  837  (Tex.  Dec.  2, 
2022) (per curiam) [21-0886] 
The issue in this mandamus pro-
ceeding  is  whether  the  trial  court 
abused its discretion by denying the de-
fendants’  motion  under  Texas  Rule  of 
Civil Procedure 204.1 to conduct a med-
ical examination of the plaintiffs.  

Members of the Pau family sued 
their  landlord  Auburn  Creek  and  re-
lated  parties,  alleging  that  they  sus-
tained  traumatic  brain  injuries  from 
being  exposed  to  carbon  monoxide  in 
their  apartment.  The  Paus  sought 
more  than  $33  million  in  damages. 

85 
 

Auburn Creek moved for an order un-
der  Rule  204.1  requiring  the  Paus  to 
submit  to  neuropsychological  testing 
by a clinical psychologist whom Auburn 
Creek  had  retained  as  a  testifying  ex-
pert.  After  the  trial  court  denied  the 
motion  without  prejudice,  Auburn 
Creek  filed  a  motion  to  reconsider, 
which the trial court also denied. Both 
motions  were  filed  more  than  thirty 
days before the end of the discovery pe-
riod, as required by Rule 204.1. On the 
Paus’  motion,  and  because  Auburn 
Creek  acknowledged  that  its  expert 
could not form an opinion on the nature 
and extent of the Paus’ injuries without 
examining  the  plaintiffs  himself,  the 
trial court issued an order striking the 
expert’s testimony in part. The court of 
appeals denied Auburn Creek’s manda-
mus petition.  

The  Supreme  Court  condition-
ally granted mandamus relief in a per 
curiam  opinion.  The  Court  first  held 
that  Auburn  Creek’s  motions  were 
timely.  The  Paus  argued  that  the  mo-
tion to reconsider was filed too late be-
cause the hearing was not held until a 
few days before the end of the discovery 
period, and it would not have been pos-
sible to conduct the examination before 
discovery  closed.  The  Court  disagreed 
because  Auburn  Creek’s  motions  were 
timely under Rule 204.1, and the delay 
in  having  the  motion  to  reconsider 
heard  was  outside  of  Auburn  Creek’s 
control. 

Next,  the  Court  held  that  Au-
burn  Creek’s  motion  satisfies  Rule 
204.1’s  good-cause  requirement  be-
cause  Auburn  Creek’s  motion  met  the 
three-part test established by Supreme 
Court precedent: (1) the examination is 
likely  to  lead  to  relevant  evidence;  (2) 

proportionality,  undue  burden,  over-
breadth, and confidentiality. 
 

c)  In  re  Kuraray  Am.,  Inc.,  656 
S.W.3d  137  (Tex.  Dec.  9, 
2022) (per curiam) [20-0268] 
The issue in this case is whether 
the trial court abused its discretion by 
ordering a party to produce up to four 
months of cell-phone data from its em-
ployees. 

Multiple  workers  at  a  chemical 
plant sued the plant operator, Kuraray 
America,  Inc.,  for  injuries  resulting 
from  a  chemical  release  and  fire. 
Shortly after the incident, Kuraray col-
lected  the  company-issued  cell  phones 
of  several  employees  and  copied  the 
data.  The  plaintiffs  moved  to  compel 
discovery  of  all  information  collected 
from  those  phones.  The  plaintiffs  did 
not  allege  that  cell-phone  use  by  any 
Kuraray  employee  contributed  to  the 
chemical release, but they argued at a 
hearing that Kuraray employees could 
have  been  distracted  by  their  cell 
phones  and  presented  evidence  that 
Kuraray had a history of problems with 
cell-phone use by employees. The trial 
court  ordered  Kuraray  to  produce  the 
cell-phone  data  of  three  employees  for 
four  months  before  the  chemical  re-
lease  and  of  two  supervisors  for  six 
weeks  before  the  release.  Kuraray 
moved  for  reconsideration,  asserting 
that the cell-phone data demonstrated 
that none of the five employees was us-
ing a cell phone at a time when the em-
ployees  could  have  been  distracted 
from  responding  to  plant  conditions. 
The trial court denied reconsideration. 
Kuraray  sought  mandamus  relief, 
which  the  court  of  appeals  denied. 

there is a nexus between the examina-
tion and the condition alleged; and (3) 
the information cannot be obtained by 
less intrusive means. After concluding 
that Auburn Creek lacked an adequate 
remedy  by  appeal,  the  Court  directed 
the  trial  court  to  withdraw  its  orders 
denying the motion to compel and par-
tially  striking  Auburn  Creek’s  expert 
and to sign an order requiring the Paus 
to submit to an examination by Auburn 
Creek’s expert.  

)  In  re  Central  Or.  Truck  Co., 
644 S.W.3d 668 (Tex. May 6, 
2022) (per curiam) [20-0945] 
In  this  personal-injury  suit,  the 
plaintiff  alleges  she  suffered  a  trau-
matic brain injury and a corresponding 
diminution of her employment opportu-
nities and earning capacity following a 
2017  rear-end  collision.  The  issue  in 
the original proceeding is whether the 
defendants  are  entitled  to  seek  (1) 
infor-
post-accident  medical-billing 
mation from the plaintiff’s medical pro-
viders and (2) third-party production of 
the plaintiff’s pre-accident medical, ed-
ucation, and employment records along 
with  insurance  records  pertaining  to 
injuries  the  plaintiff  suffered  in  two 
prior accidents. 

Although the Supreme Court de-
termined  the  discovery  requests  seek 
relevant  information,  including  infor-
mation  discoverable  under  In  re  K&L 
Auto  Crushers,  LLC,  667  S.W.3d  239 
(Tex. 2021), the Court denied the man-
damus petition without prejudice to al-
low  the  parties  to  confer  and  the  trial 
court  an  opportunity  to  reconsider  its 
orders  in  light  of  the  extensive  guid-
ance  K&L  Auto  Crushers  provides  for 
resolving  the  parties’  disputes  about 

  b

86 
 

Kuraray  then  petitioned  the  Supreme 
Court for a writ of mandamus. 

The Court conditionally granted 
Kuraray’s  petition.  The  Court  held 
that, to obtain production of cell-phone 
data, the party seeking the data must 
first allege or provide some evidence of 
cell-phone  use  by  the  person  whose 
data  is  sought  at  a  time  when  cell-
phone use could have contributed to the 
underlying  incident. Once  this  burden 
is  satisfied,  the  trial  court  may  order 
production  of  cell-phone  data  but  only 
for the time period in which cell-phone 
use could have contributed to the inci-
dent. If this initial production indicates 
that cell-phone use could have contrib-
uted to the incident, then the trial court 
may  consider  whether  additional  dis-
covery regarding cell-phone use may be 
relevant.  Here,  the  Court  concluded 
there  was  no  showing  that  any  em-
ployee’s cell-phone use could have con-
tributed to the chemical release, so the 
trial  court  abused its  discretion  by  or-
dering production of cell-phone data for 
a six-week or four-month period. 
 

d)  In  re  UPS  Ground  Freight, 
Inc.,  646  S.W.3d  828  (Tex. 
June 17, 2022) [20-0827] 
In this wrongful-death suit, UPS 
sought mandamus relief from a discov-
ery  order  compelling  production  of  all 
alcohol-and-drug  test  results  for  all 
drivers at its Irving, Texas facility fol-
lowing  a  fatal  motor-vehicle  accident 
involving  a  single  UPS  driver.  The  is-
sues  in  the  original  proceeding  in-
cluded whether the discovery requests 
were overbroad and whether the disclo-
sure was prohibited by federal law. 

Phillip Villarreal, a driver oper-
ating out of UPS’s Irving facility, tested 

87 
 

positive for THC after he was involved 
in  a  multi-vehicle  collision  that  killed 
Nathan  Dean  Clark.  Clark’s  mother, 
Jacintha McElduff, sued Villarreal and 
UPS  for  negligence  and  gross  negli-
gence.  Among  other  things,  McElduff 
alleged  that  UPS  knowingly  failed  to 
properly  drug  test  Villarreal,  know-
ingly allowed him to drive while under 
the  influence,  and  knowingly  failed  to 
comply  with  federal  alcohol-and-drug 
testing laws as well as its own testing 
policies. 

When deposed, Villarreal admit-
ted  that  he  had  used  marijuana  for 
years before the collision and had pro-
vided marijuana to other drivers. To es-
tablish a pattern and practice of failing 
to adequately drug test at the Irving fa-
cility,  McElduff  served  discovery  re-
quests  seeking  (1) the  names,  ad-
dresses,  and  telephone  numbers  of  all 
UPS drivers dispatched out of that fa-
cility in the eleven years before the ac-
cident,  and  (2)  all  drug-and-alcohol 
tests of those drivers without any time 
restriction.  The  trial  court  compelled 
production,  overruling  UPS’s  objec-
tions that the requests were overbroad, 
sought  irrelevant  information,  were 
preempted by federal law, and violated 
the  nonparty  drivers’  privacy  rights. 
The  court  of  appeals  conditionally 
granted mandamus relief, holding that 
the discovery requests were not appro-
priately  time-limited  and,  therefore, 
overbroad. In response, the trial court 
revised  the  discovery  order  to  include 
stricter time-period limitations.  

When UPS raised similar objec-
tions to the revised discovery order, the 
court of appeals generally rejected all of 
UPS’s  objections  but  agreed  that  the 
discovery  order  violated  the  nonparty 

drivers’  privacy.  Conditionally  grant-
ing mandamus relief in part, the court 
held that the trial court abused its dis-
cretion by compelling production of un-
redacted records that would reveal the 
identities  of  the  nonparty  drivers 
whose  test  results  would  be  released. 
The trial court again revised its order, 
compelling production subject to redac-
tion of identifying information. On the 
trial  court’s  rendition  of  a  compliant 
discovery  order,  the  court  of  appeals 
dismissed  the  mandamus  petition  as 
moot.  

The  Supreme  Court  condition-
ally granted mandamus relief, holding 
that the trial court erred in compelling 
disclosure of confidential drug-test rec-
ords  of  nonparty  UPS  employees  who 
were  uninvolved  in  the  accident  that 
claimed  Clark’s  life.  The  discovery  re-
quests were overbroad because the in-
dividual drug-test results of uninvolved 
drivers were irrelevant to proving that 
UPS negligently trained, retained, and 
entrusted a vehicle to Villarreal or was 
grossly negligent in those regards. The 
results  were  also  irrelevant  to  deter-
mining  whether  UPS  complied  with 
federal  drug-test  mandates  because 
drug-test results of drivers from a sin-
gle facility have no bearing on the na-
tional  drug-testing  program’s  compli-
ance with federal mandates.  
 

 Finality of Judgments 
a)  Patel v. Nations Renovations, 
LLC,  ___  S.W.3d  ___,  2023 
WL  1871558  (Tex.  Feb.  10, 
2023) (per curiam) [21-0643] 
The issue in this case is whether 
a judgment confirming a final arbitra-
tion award was final.  

This  case  arose  out  of  a 

88 
 

construction-project  dispute  between 
Nations, Huntley, and a third party, in 
which  all  parties  agreed  to  submit  all 
claims to binding arbitration. The arbi-
trator issued a final arbitration award 
in Nations’  favor.  At Nations’  request, 
the district court rendered a judgment 
confirming the arbitration award. The 
judgment stated that: “Nations have all 
writs and processes to aid in execution 
of this judgment[,] . . . that all relief not 
granted  herein  is  denied[,] . . . [and] 
that  this  is  a  final  judgment  and  ap-
pealable.”  However,  after  the  arbitra-
tion award was issued, and then again 
after the judgment confirming the arbi-
tration  award  was  signed,  Nations 
added  additional  defendants  to  the 
case,  including  relator  Patel.  Nations 
alleged that the new defendants are al-
ter egos of Huntley and sought to hold 
them vicariously liable for the damages 
owed by Huntley. 

Approximately a year and a half 
later, Nations moved the district court 
to  modify  the  judgment  to  clarify  that 
it  was interlocutory, not  final. Unsure 
of its jurisdiction and whether the judg-
ment  was  final,  the  district  court 
granted Nations’ motion to modify the 
judgment  but  sua  sponte  certified  the 
question  for  interlocutory  appeal.  The 
court of appeals denied review.  

Treating  the  defendants’  peti-
tion for review as a petition for writ of 
mandamus,  the  Supreme  Court  held 
that the judgment confirming the arbi-
tration award was clearly and unequiv-
ocally  final.  The  Court  reasoned  that 
while no magic language is required to 
establish  sufficient  indicia  of  finality, 
the  statements  in  the  judgment  here, 
taken  together,  render  it  final,  even 
though  none  of  the  statements  would 

alone  be  sufficient.  The  Court  then 
clarified that a judgment cannot be fi-
nal  as  to  some  parties  but  not  others. 
Finally, the Court pointed out that Na-
tions’  motion  to  modify  came  far  too 
late;  if,  when  the  judgment  was  en-
tered, Nations was unsure as to its fi-
nality or thought that a final judgment 
had been entered erroneously, Nations 
should have sought clarification or ap-
pealed within the statutory time frame 
for  doing  so.  Because  the  order  grant-
ing the motion to modify the judgment 
confirming  the  arbitration  award  was 
void, the Court granted mandamus re-
lief  directing  the  trial  court  to  with-
draw it.

a)  In  re  Contract  Freighters, 
Inc.,  646  S.W.3d  810  (Tex. 
June 17, 2022) [21-0134] 
This  mandamus  action  chal-
lenged  certain  discovery  rulings  in  a 
vehicle  collision  lawsuit.  Relator  Con-
tract  Freighters  employed  Randall 
Folks as a driver. Folks’s tractor-trailer 
collided  with  the  vehicle  of  plaintiffs 
Jimmy  and  Paula  McPherson,  after 
which  the  McPhersons  sued  Contract 
Freighters  for  negligent  hiring  and 
training.  The  challenged  discovery  re-
quests  sought  records  from  Contract 
Freighters  and  from  the  U.S.  Depart-
ment  of  Transportation  for  any  acci-
dent 
involving  Contract  Freighters 
within  the  last  five  years.  Contract 
Freighters  objected  and  moved  to 
quash the requests, but the trial court 
and  the  court  of appeals  denied  relief. 
Contract Freighters then filed its peti-
tion for a writ of mandamus in the Su-
preme Court.  

89 
 

The  McPhersons  purported  to 
withdraw  the  challenged  discovery  re-
quests  by  issuing  new  discovery  re-
quests  that  did  not  contain  the  ob-
jected-to  items.  The  McPhersons  then 
filed a motion in this Court to dismiss 
the petition as moot. They did not file 
anything with the district court regard-
ing its challenged orders.  
found 
The  Court 

the 
McPhersons’  unilateral  withdrawal  of 
the challenged actions did not moot the 
case.  A  case  is  not  necessarily  mooted 
when the challenged actions are with-
drawn,  particularly when  the  plaintiff 
gave  no  enforceable  assurances  that 
they would not resubmit the challenged 
orders  and  when  the  action  that  pur-
ports  to  moot  the  case  occurs  only  as 
appellate scrutiny grows near. 

that 

In previous cases, this Court has 
found these kinds of fishing expeditions 
to be overly broad and burdensome as 
a matter of law. The Court thus condi-
tionally granted mandamus relief. 
 

 Responsible 

Third-Party 

Designation 

a)  In  re  YRC,  Inc.,  646  S.W.3d 
805 (Tex. June 17, 2022) (per 
curiam) [21-0846] 

At 

issue 

in  this  case  was 
whether  the  trial  court  erred  in  deny-
ing defendant YRC’s motion for leave to 
designate a responsible third party in a 
negligence  suit  arising  from  a  work-
place injury.  

In  2015,  James  Curry  was  in-
jured on the job while loading a trailer 
parked at a freight dock owned by his 
employer,  Eaton  Corporation.  Eaton 
authorized  YRC,  the  operating  freight 
carrier,  to  pull  the  trailer  away  while 
Curry was still actively loading it, and 

Curry fell out and was injured. He then 
filed  a  successful  workers’  compensa-
tion claim. Curry filed a negligence suit 
against  YRC  and  its  driver  in  2016. 
YRC filed a motion to designate Eaton 
a  responsible  third  party  pursuant  to 
section 33.004 of the Texas Civil Prac-
tice  and  Remedies  Code.  At  the  time 
the  motion  was  filed,  trial  was  set  
sixty-two days later. The trial court de-
nied the motion for leave to designate, 
finding that (1) YRC failed to establish 
good cause for its delay in filing its mo-
tion  for  leave;  (2)  the  motion  was  un-
timely because it was filed five years af-
ter the subject injury and thus the stat-
ute of limitations on the claim against 
Eaton had expired; and (3) YRC failed 
to plead sufficient facts to support the 
motion. The court of appeals affirmed.  
YRC  sought  mandamus  relief 
from the Supreme Court, arguing that 
the trial court erred in denying the mo-
tion to designate. The Court agreed in 
a  per  curiam  opinion,  holding  that  all 
three of the trial court’s grounds for de-
nial were error. First, a motion to des-
ignate  a  responsible  third  party  is 
timely  so  long  as  it  is  filed  before  the 
then-pending trial date. Because YRC’s 
motion was filed sixty-two days before 
the  trial  setting,  it  was  therefore 
timely. Second, the trial court erred in 
concluding that the motion was filed af-
ter the applicable limitations period ex-
pired.  Section  33.004(d)  provides  that 
“a defendant may not designate a per-
son  as  a  responsible  third  party  with 
respect  to  a  claimant’s  cause  of  action 
after  the  applicable  limitations  period 
on the cause of action has expired with 
respect to the responsible third party” 
unless  the  possible  designation  was 
timely disclosed. There is no applicable 

90 
 

limitations  period  with  respect  to 
Curry’s  claims  against  Eaton  because 
Eaton is a workers’ compensation sub-
scriber,  which  provides  the  exclusive 
remedy for recovery for workplace inju-
ries, and a negligence action by Curry 
against Eaton is precluded as a matter 
of  law.  Consequently,  section  33.004 
did not foreclose YRC’s designation. 

Finally,  the  trial  court  abused  its 
discretion  in  concluding  that  YRC  did 
not plead sufficient facts to support its 
motion. YRC was required to meet the 
pleading standard set out by the Texas 
Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  which  de-
mands  only  “a  short  statement  of  the 
cause of action sufficient to give fair no-
tice  of  the  claim  involved.”  The  Court 
concluded  that  YRC’s  motion  cleared 
that  bar.  Accordingly, 
the  Court 
granted YRC’s petition for writ of man-
damus  and  directed  the  trial  court  to 
vacate its order denying YRC’s motion 
for  leave  to  designate  a  responsible 
third party and to grant the motion.  
 

 Service of Process 
a)  U.S.  Bank  Nat’l  Assoc.  v. 
Moss,  644  S.W.3d  130  (Tex. 
Feb. 25, 2022) [20-0517] 

At 

issue 

 
in  this  case  was 
whether  Estates  Code  chapter  505  or 
section 17.028 of the Civil Practice and 
Remedies  Code  is  the  appropriate 
method of service on a financial institu-
tion serving as a foreign corporate fidu-
ciary.  
 
Moss  is  a  homeowner  in  Dallas 
County.  In  2005,  Moss  refinanced  his 
mortgage  and  signed  a  home  equity 
deed of trust. U.S. Bank claimed own-
ership  of  that  deed  by  assignment.  In 
2017,  Moss  sued  the  Bank,  seeking  to 
quiet title on his home, and alleged that 

the Bank could no longer sell the prop-
erty because the statute of limitations 
had  expired.  He  served  the  Bank—
which was domiciled in Ohio and acting 
as  a  foreign  corporate  fiduciary  in 
Texas—by  serving  the  Secretary  of 
State,  pursuant  to  chapter  505  of  the 
Estates Code. Section 505.004 provides 
that a foreign corporate fiduciary must 
appoint the Secretary of State as the fi-
duciary’s agent for service of process in 
actions  related  to  trusts,  estates,  and 
other  matters.  U.S.  Bank  did  not  ap-
pear  in  the  quiet  title  lawsuit,  and 
Moss obtained a default judgment.  
 
U.S. bank sought to set aside the 
default judgment on the grounds that it 
was improperly served and filed an eq-
uitable bill of review in the trial court. 
The Bank contended that financial in-
stitutions may only be served pursuant 
to  section  17.028  of  the  Civil  Practice 
and  Remedies  Code,  which  requires 
service on a financial institution’s “reg-
istered  agent.”  The  trial  court  agreed 
with  Moss  that  service  under  the  Es-
tates Code was proper. The court of ap-
peals affirmed, holding that both meth-
ods  of  service  are  valid  and  Moss 
properly  effectuated  service  on  the 
Bank via the Estates Code. 

The  Bank  appealed  to  the  Su-
preme Court, which reversed the court 
of  appeals’  judgment.  First,  the  court 
held  that  section  17.028  of  the  Civil 
Practice  and  Remedies  Code  provides 
the  exclusive  methods  of  serving  a  fi-
nancial  institution.  It  then  considered 
the comprehensive statutory landscape 
governing  foreign  corporations  operat-
ing  in  Texas  and  determined  that  the 
Secretary of State, as an agent for ser-
vice  of  process  under  Estates  Code 
chapter 505, is not a “registered agent” 

91 
 

as  required  by  section  17.028.  The 
Court  reasoned  that  the  various  laws 
governing  foreign  corporations  doing 
business  in  Texas,  including  the  Civil 
Practice  and  Remedies  Code  and  Es-
tates Code as well as the Finance Code 
and  Business  Organizations  Code,  do 
not,  when  read  together,  support  the 
conclusion  that  the  Secretary  of  State 
can  be  a  corporation’s  “registered 
agent” for purposes of service of process 
section 17.028 of the Civil Practice and 
Remedies  Code.  Consequently,  the 
Court  held  that  Moss’s  service  of  the 
Secretary did not satisfy the service re-
quirements of 17.028 and the Bank was 
not  properly  served.  The  Court  re-
versed  the  court  of  appeals’  judgment 
denying  the  bill  of  review,  rendered 
summary  judgment  setting  aside  the 
default  judgment,  and  remanded  the 
case  to  the  trial  court  for  further  pro-
ceedings on the merits.  

 
 Standing 
a)  Jones  v.  Turner,  646  S.W.3d 
319 (Tex. June 17, 2022) [21-
0358] 

This case concerns whether tax-
payers  have  standing  to  challenge  al-
leged  misallocation  of  tax  revenue  by 
city officials and whether the taxpayers 
in  this  case  sufficiently  pleaded  ultra 
vires  acts  by  alleging  the  city  officials 
had  no  discretion  in  so  misallocating 
the funds. 

Two  Houston  taxpayers,  Jones 
and Watson, sued Houston Mayor Syl-
vester  Turner  and  other  City  Officials 
for  allegedly  underfunding  the  Dedi-
cated  Drainage  and  Street  Renewal 
Fund established under the City Char-
ter,  which  mandated  that  a  certain 
amount of funds be spent “exclusively” 

on  drainage  and  street  maintenance. 
Specifically, the taxpayers alleged that 
in Fiscal Year 2020, the ad valorem tax 
revenue  allocation  to  the  Fund  had  a 
shortfall of about $50 million. The tax-
payers’  pleadings  indicated  that  they 
calculated that amount by multiplying 
Fiscal Year 2020’s total assessed taxa-
ble property value by the Charter’s al-
location  of  an  “amount  equivalent  to 
proceeds  from  $0.118  of  the  City’s  ad 
valorem tax levy,” minus debt service, 
to the Fund.  

The City Officials filed a plea to 
the  jurisdiction  asserting  governmen-
tal immunity. The City Officials argued 
the  pleadings  did  not  show  that  they 
acted outside their authority. They also 
contested  the  taxpayers’  calculations. 
The  trial  court  denied  the  plea  to  the 
jurisdiction. 

On  appeal,  the  City  Officials 
maintained  their  entitlement  to  im-
munity  and  argued  for  the  first  time 
that  the  taxpayers  lacked  standing  to 
bring  suit.  The  court  of  appeals  held 
that the taxpayers did not have stand-
ing.  The  appeals  court  concluded  that 
the taxpayers failed to show that their 
suit sought to enjoin an illegal expendi-
ture  of  funds  (or  any  expenditure  of 
funds)—a necessary component of tax-
payer  standing.  Having  determined 
that the taxpayers had not established 
taxpayer  standing  and  had  not  other-
wise shown a particularized injury, the 
appeals  court  dismissed  the  case  for 
want  of  jurisdiction  without  reaching 
the immunity issue. 

The Supreme Court reversed. It 
was  undisputed  the  taxpayers  were 
“taxpayers” for purposes of standing, so 
the question was whether they pleaded 
sufficient  facts  showing  that  public 

92 
 

funds were expended on allegedly ille-
gal  activity.  The  Court  held  they  did. 
The  taxpayers’  calculations  showed  a 
measurable and not de minimus misal-
location and alleged that the City was 
in  fact  spending  the  money  on  other 
services  that  would  not  have  received 
those  funds  if  City  Officials  had  allo-
cated them properly.  

The Supreme Court also reached 
the immunity issue the court of appeals 
did  not  address.  The  Court  held  that 
the  Charter  gave  the  City  Officials  no 
discretion  but  to  allocate  the  funds  as 
mandated. Finally, the Court held that 
the trial court did not err in declining 
to  dismiss  the  taxpayers’  claims  for 
mandamus  and  declaratory  relief  at 
the plea to the jurisdiction stage.  
 

 Summary Judgment 
a)  Weekley  Homes,  LLC  v. 
Paniagua,  646  S.W.3d  821 
(Tex. 
2022) 
[21-0197] 

June 

17, 

The  issues  in  this  case  were 
(1) whether a party preserves an issue 
for appeal when it “d[oes] not substan-
tively  argue”  that  issue  in  its  briefing 
in the court of appeals but still directs 
the court’s attention to the error about 
which  it  complains  and  (2)  whether 
pleadings  may 
sum-
mary-judgment evidence. 

constitute 

In  this  case,  Weekley  Homes, 
LLC  hired  Leobardo  Maravilla,  Jose 
Maravilla, and John Paniagua to work 
on  a  townhome  construction  project. 
While working on the project, the three 
men were moving a metal scaffold on a 
driveway  made  wet  by  rain.  The  scaf-
fold came within six to ten feet of a tem-
porary  power  line,  electrocuting  Jose 
and injuring Paniagua. 

Paniagua  and  several  of  Jose’s 
relatives sued Weekley for negligence, 
gross  negligence,  and  premises  liabil-
ity. After discovery, Weekley moved for 
summary  judgment  under  Chapter 95 
of  the  Texas  Civil  Practice  and  Reme-
dies Code, which limits a real-property 
owner’s liability for common-law negli-
gence claims arising from a contractor’s 
or subcontractor’s work on an improve-
ment  to  the  property.  Weekley’s  sum-
mary-judgment motion cited the plain-
tiffs’  petition  as  evidence  that  the 
driveway  and  townhome  comprised  a 
single  improvement  for  Chapter 95’s 
purposes. The trial court granted sum-
mary  judgment  in  Weekley’s  favor  on 
all  claims.  The  court  of  appeals  af-
firmed  summary 
judgment  on  the 
gross-negligence claims but reversed as 
to the negligence and premises-liability 
claims,  holding  that—because  plead-
ings

mary-judgment

had not adduced evidence to satisfy the 
second  requirement  for  Chapter 95’s 
applicability.

The  Supreme  Court  first  deter-
mined that the plaintiffs preserved the 
issue of whether Weekley conclusively 
established the second requirement be-
cause  they  adequately  directed  the 
court of appeals’ attention to their com-
plaint; namely, that the trial court er-
roneously  concluded  Chapter 95  was 
applicable.  The  Supreme  Court  then 
addressed whether pleadings may con-
stitute  summary-judgment  evidence. 
While  acknowledging  that  pleadings 
are not generally competent summary-
judgment  evidence,  the  Court  ex-
plained  that  judicial  admissions  in  an 
opposing party’s pleadings may be used

guidance in Regency. 
 

 

 Error Preservation 
a)  In the Matter of the Marriage 
Williams,  646  S.W.3d  542 
(Tex.  June  10,  2022)  [21-
0584] 
issue 

At 

in  this  case  was 
whether  a  defendant  challenging  the 
sufficiency of the evidence to support a 
default judgment must, to preserve er-
ror, also file a motion for new trial un-
der  Craddock  v.  Sunshine  Bus  Lines, 
Inc., 133 S.W.2d 124 (Tex. 1939). 

Anthony  Williams  filed  for  di-
vorce  from  his  wife,  Theresa.  Theresa 
failed  to  answer,  and  the  trial  court 
rendered  a  default  judgment  granting 
the divorce and dividing the marital es-
tate. Theresa motioned for a new trial 
but raised neither the sufficiency of the 
evidence supporting the divorce decree 
nor  Craddock  in  the  trial  court.  The 
trial  court  denied  Theresa’s  new  trial 
motion, and she appealed, arguing that 
the trial court abused its discretion in 
the  property  division  because  there 
was no evidence as to separate property 
and  no  evidence  that  the  division  was 
just and right. She did not assign as er-
ror the denial of her motion for a new 
trial.  

The  court  of  appeals  affirmed, 
holding  that  Theresa’s  failure  to  chal-
lenge the denial of the new trial motion 
under Craddock resulted in a failure to 

preserve  error  of  her  other  claims 
raised  on  appeal,  including  whether 
the trial court erred in its property di-
vision.  Theresa  appealed  to  the  Su-
preme  Court, 
that 
Craddock governs equitable challenges 
to default judgments, while evidentiary 
sufficiency is a legal challenge that can 
be raised for the first time on appeal. 

contending 

The Supreme Court agreed with 
Theresa  and  reversed  the  court  of  ap-
peals’ decision in a per curiam opinion. 
The Court reasoned that a motion for a 
new  trial  under  Craddock  and  an  evi-
dentiary-sufficiency  motion  are  dis-
tinct.  The  Court  held  that  a  failure  to 
file  a  motion  for  new  trial  under 
Craddock  in  the  trial  court  does  not 
foreclose a party’s ability to raise on ap-
peal  an  evidentiary  challenge  to  a  de-
fault property division.  
 

b)  FieldTurf USA, Inc. v. Pleas-
ant  Grove  Indep.  Sch.  Dist., 
642 S.W.3d 829 (Tex. Mar. 4, 
2022) [20-0507] 

The issues presented in this case 
were (1) whether a trial court’s on-the-
record,  oral  ruling  on  an  objection  to 
summary-judgment  evidence  is  suffi-
cient  for  error-preservation  purposes 
when  the  ruling  is  not  reduced  to  a 
written order and (2) whether the court 
of appeals erred in remanding for a new 
trial  without  addressing  the  appel-
lant’s rendition issues.  

A  school  district  contracted  for 
the  installation  of  an  artificial-turf 
field. After the field began to degrade, 
the district sued its general contractor 
(Altech)  and  the  turf  manufacturer 
(FieldTurf) for breach of warranty. Al-
tech moved for summary judgment, ar-
guing that there was no evidence that 

94 
 

it had breached any warranty. The Dis-
trict  responded  that  the  construction 
contract specified a range of acceptable 
“G-Max” ratings the field was required 
to meet and attached a report showing 
that the field’s G-Max rating exceeded 
that  range.  Altech  objected  in  writing 
to  the  report  on  several  grounds,  in-
cluding  that  it  was  not  authenticated. 
The trial court sustained the objection 
on  the  record  at  the  summary  judg-
ment hearing and granted Altech’s mo-
tion  for  summary  judgment,  but  the 
court  did  not  issue  a  written  order  on 
the  objections.  After  trial  on  the  Dis-
trict’s 
claims 
breach-of-warranty 
against  FieldTurf,  the  trial  court 
awarded the district $175,000 in dam-
ages.   

The  district  appealed  the  sum-
mary judgment for Altech, and the dis-
trict  and  FieldTurf  both  appealed  the 
trial court’s judgment. The court of ap-
peals reversed the summary judgment, 
holding  that  the  G-Max  report  re-
mained in the summary judgment rec-
ord because of the lack of a written or-
der  on  Altech’s  objection  and  that  the 
report  created  a  fact  issue  on  the 
breach-of-warranty  claim  against  Al-
tech. Without addressing the merits of 
the issues presented on appeal as to the 
judgment  against  FieldTurf,  the  court 
of  appeals  remanded  the  warranty 
claims  against  both  defendants  for  a 
new  trial,  holding  that  the  erroneous 
summary  judgment  for  Altech  limited 
the evidence presented to the jury with 
respect to the claim against FieldTurf.   
The  Supreme  Court  reversed. 
The  Court  first  held  that  the  court  of 
appeals  erred  in  remanding  the  claim 
against  FieldTurf  for  a  new  trial  be-
cause the record  contained no support 

for the court of appeals’ conclusion that 
the  summary  judgment  for  Altech, 
whether or not erroneous, affected the 
development or presentation of the evi-
dence  at  trial  on  the  claim  against 
FieldTurf.  Accordingly,  the  Court  re-
manded the case to the court of appeals 
to address the merits of the parties’ ap-
pellate issues on that claim. 

summary 

The Court further held that the 
court  of  appeals  erred  in  holding  that 
the G-Max report remained in the sum-
mary  judgment  record  and  could  be 
considered  in  reviewing  the  summary 
judgment  for  Altech.  The  Court  held 
that  a  written  order  is  not  required  if 
the record clearly shows a ruling on the 
objection. Here, the reporter’s record of 
the 
judgment  hearing 
showed  that  the  trial  court  sustained 
Altech’s objection to the G-Max report, 
and the district did not argue on appeal 
that the court erred in doing so. Accord-
ingly,  the  Court  held  that  the  report 
was not part of the summary judgment 
record on appeal and that the court of 
appeals  erred  in  relying  on  the  report 
to reverse the summary judgment. Fi-
nally,  the  Court  rejected  the  district’s 
argument  that  the  G-Max  report  was 
cumulative of other evidence in the rec-
ord that created a fact issue on the war-
ranty  claim.  The  Court  thus  reversed 
the court of appeals’ judgment and re-
instated the summary judgment for Al-
tech.

The  Court  granted  relief.  When

 Deed Restrictions 
a)  JBrice  Holdings,  L.L.C.  v. 
Wilcrest  Walk  Townhomes 
Ass’n,  644  S.W.3d  179  (Tex. 
Apr. 22, 2022) [20-0857] 
This  declaratory-judgment  suit 
involves  whether  neighborhood  deed 
restrictions  prohibited  a  property 
owner’s short-term rentals of the prop-
erty. 

JBrice  Holdings,  L.L.C.  owned 
two  townhomes  in  the  Wilcrest  Walk 
subdivision  and  leased  them  out  as 
short-term rentals. The Wilcrest Walk 
property owners’ association demanded 
the 
cease 
that 

renting 

JBrice 

properties  for  short  terms  and  later 
adopted  rules  prohibiting  short-term 
rentals,  claiming  rule-making  author-
ity under Texas Property Code Section 
204.010(a)(6).  The  neighborhood  deed 
restrictions  included  a  leasing  clause 
that allowed leasing of the properties in 
general  and  prohibited  restrictions  on 
an  owner’s  leasing  rights  other  than 
those  listed  in  the  deed  restrictions 
themselves.  The  deed  restrictions  in-
cluded  a  residential-use  clause  that 
prohibited use of the property “for any 
purpose other than as a private single-
family  residence”  for  the  owner  or  his 
tenants. 

JBrice  sought  a  declaratory 
judgment that the deed restrictions al-
lowed its short-term rentals. The asso-
ciation counterclaimed for breach of the 
restrictive covenants and passed rules 
prohibiting  short-term  leases  of  fewer 
than thirty days. JBrice then asked the 
court  to  declare  the  association’s 
amended rules invalid. The trial court 
granted  partial  summary  judgment  to 
the association on its claim that JBrice 
had  breached  the  deed  restrictions  by 
renting  for  short  terms.  The  court  is-
sued a permanent injunction on rentals 
of fewer than seven days and awarded 
attorney’s fees. The court of appeals af-
firmed,  concluding  that  the  Property 
Code  authorized  the  association  to 
adopt rules barring short-term rentals 
because  the  deed  restrictions  were  si-
lent as to short-term use. 

The Supreme Court reversed the 
judgment  of  the  court  of  appeals,  va-
cated  the  permanent  injunction,  and 
remanded the case for consideration of 
attorney’s  fees.    The  Court  held  that 
the  residential-use  covenant  did  not 
prohibit  short-term  rentals.  Further, 

96 
 

because the deed restrictions expressly 
prohibited  restraints  on  leasing  other 
than  those  contained  within  the  cove-
nants  themselves,  the  association  had 
no authority to adopt rules prohibiting 
short-term rentals under the Property 
Code. 
 

 Eminent Domain 
a)  Hlavinka  v.  HSC  Pipeline 
P’ship, LLC, 650 S.W.3d 483 
(Tex. May 27, 2022) [20-0567] 
The  issues  in  this  case  are 
(1) whether  a  pipeline  company  trans-
porting  polymer-grade  propylene  can 
be  a  common  carrier  with  condemna-
tion  authority  under  the  Texas  Busi-
and 
ness  Organizations  Code, 
(2) whether a property owner may tes-
tify  during  condemnation  proceedings 
about recent arms’-length transactions 
with  other  pipeline  companies  as  evi-
dence  of  the  current  highest  and  best 
use of the property in determining the 
market value of the easement taken. 

The  Hlavinkas  own  several 
thousand  acres  of  land  in  Brazoria 
County,  across  which  run  several  pri-
vately  negotiated  pipeline  easements. 
After  failing  to  negotiate  a  deal  with 
the  Hlavinkas,  HSC Pipeline Partner-
ship, LLC, initiated condemnation pro-
ceedings  to  take  an  easement  for  its 
pipeline.  

At  trial,  the  Hlavinkas  chal-
lenged: (1) whether Texas Business Or-
ganizations Code gave HSC condemna-
tion authority, (2) whether any author-
ity  conferred  by  the  Code  applies  to 
pipelines that transport polymer-grade 
propylene,  and  (3)  whether  HSC  is  a 
common  carrier  for  public  use.  HSC 
moved  for  partial  summary  judgment 
as  to  its  condemnation  authority.  The 

trial  court  granted  HSC’s  motion  for 
summary  judgment  and  denied  the 
Hlavinkas’ jurisdictional plea. 

As  evidence  of  the  condemned 
easement’s  value, 
the  Hlavinkas 
sought to admit testimony of two recent 
arms’-length  easement  sales  to  other 
pipeline  companies  across  the  Hlavin-
kas’  land.  The  trial  court  granted 
HSC’s  motion  to  exclude  this  testi-
mony, thus limiting the land’s market 
value to agricultural value. 

The court of appeals determined 
that the Texas Business Organizations 
Code  granted  independent  condemna-
tion authority and that polymer-grade 
propylene qualifies as an “oil product,” 
but  the  court  reversed  the  summary 
judgment  in  favor  of  HSC  because  it 
concluded  that  whether  the  pipeline 
served a public use was a fact question 
for the jury to resolve. The court of ap-
peals also reversed the exclusion of ev-
idence, holding that the testimony was 
admissible as evidence of the property’s 
market value.  

The Supreme Court affirmed the 
court  of  appeals’  conclusion  that  the 
Code  grants  condemnation  authority 
and that polymer-grade propylene is a 
qualifying  product  under  that  section. 
The Court reversed the court of appeals 
on  the  public  use  issue,  holding  that 
public  use  presents  a  legal  question, 
evidence 
and  HSC’s  undisputed 
demonstrates public use. The Court af-
firmed on the valuation issue, holding 
that  a  property  owner  may  testify  to 
arms’-length  sales  of  easements  to 
other pipeline companies as evidence of 
the  condemned  property’s  highest  and 
best use, and the exclusion of such evi-
dence was harmful error. The Court re-
manded the case to the trial court for a 

97 
 

new  trial  to  determine  the  market 
value of the property taken. 
 

b)  Miles v. Tex. Cent. R.R. & In-
frastructure, Inc., 647 S.W.3d 
613 (Tex. June 24, 2022) [20-
0393] 
issue 

At 

in  this  case  was 
whether  two  private  entities  (collec-
tively,  Texas  Central)  formed  to  con-
struct  and  operate  high-speed  passen-
ger  rail  between  Houston  and  Dallas 
have  statutory  eminent-domain  au-
thority.  

Miles, who owns property along 
the  railway’s  proposed  route,  sued  to 
challenge Texas  Central’s  eminent-do-
main  authority  after  it  attempted  to 
survey Miles’s property. Texas Central 
counterclaimed,  seeking  a  declaratory 
judgment  that  it  is  a  “railroad  com-
pany” and an “interurban electric rail-
way  company”  with  eminent-domain 
authority under Chapters 112 and 131 
of  the  Texas  Transportation  Code,  re-
spectively. The trial court granted sum-
mary judgment for Miles. The court of 
appeals  reversed,  holding  that  Texas 
Central  qualified  as  both  a  railroad 
company  and  an  interurban  electric 
railway company. 

The  Supreme  Court  affirmed. 
Chapter  131  grants  eminent-domain 
authority  to  an  “interurban  electric 
railway company,” which is a “corpora-
tion  chartered  for  the  purpose  of  con-
structing,  acquiring,  maintaining,  or 
operating  lines  of  electric  railway  be-
tween  municipalities  in  this  state  for 
the  transportation  of  freight,  passen-
gers,  or  both.”  The  Court  held  that 
Texas  Central  falls  within  the  plain 
language of this grant of authority, as 
the  company  was  chartered  for  the 

purpose  of  constructing  and  operating 
an electric railway between municipal-
ities  in  this  state—Houston  and  Dal-
las—for  the  transportation  of  passen-
gers.  The  Court’s  precedent  supports 
interpreting statutes to embrace later-
developed technologies when the text is 
broad enough to allow it, and the Leg-
islature’s recodification of Chapter 131 
in 2009 cuts against Miles’s argument 
that the statute applies only to a kind 
of train that has been extinct in Texas 
for over 70 years.  

test” 

The  Court  next  rejected  Miles’s 
contention that under Texas Rice Land 
Partners,  Ltd.  v.  Denbury  Green  Pipe-
line–Texas, LLC, 363 S.W.3d 192 (Tex. 
2012),  a  private  entity  asserting  emi-
nent-domain  authority  must  demon-
strate a reasonable probability that the 
project will be completed and thus pro-
duce the public good for which author-
ity is sought. While such a “reasonable-
probability-of-completion 
is 
rooted in sound public policy and would 
provide  an  additional  layer  of  protec-
tion  for  landowners  whose  land  is 
taken  for  speculative  projects,  it  finds 
no support in Denbury or the Constitu-
tion.  Rather,  the  Legislature  has  al-
ready  provided  numerous  protections 
to  landowners  who  are  the  subject  of 
condemnation  proceedings,  and  it  is 
not the Court’s role to second-guess the 
the 
Legislature’s  balance  between 
rights of property owners and the ben-
efits served by authorizing eminent do-
main. 

Chief  Justice  Hecht,  joined  by 
Justice Young, concurred, opining that 
Texas  Central  qualifies  as  both  an  in-
terurban electric railway company and 
a railroad company. 

Justice  Young  also  separately 

98 
 

concurred, opining that the Court cor-
rectly engaged in the heightened scru-
tiny  required  in  interpreting  statutes 
that confer eminent-domain authority. 
He  explained  that  when  a  statute  de-
fines its scope by using clear words that 
prescribe  specific  conditions,  as  Chap-
ter  131  does,  the  law  reaches  new  de-
velopments  that  satisfy  the  statutory 
criteria. 

Justice  Devine  dissented,  argu-
ing  that  Article  I,  Section  17(b)  of  the 
Texas  Constitution  forecloses  Texas 
Central’s  contemplated  taking  by  ex-
cluding from “public use” a taking “for 
transfer to a private entity for the pri-
mary purpose of economic development 
or enhancement of tax revenues.”  

Justice Huddle, joined by Justice 
Devine  and  Justice  Blacklock,  dis-
sented, arguing that Chapter 131, read 
in its historical context, conferred emi-
nent-domain authority to facilitate con-
struction  of  small  electric  railways 
traveling  short  distances,  not  high-
speed  rail  requiring  massive  infra-
structure  and  traversing  hundreds  of 
miles. Justice Huddle would hold that 
serious  doubts  exist  about  whether 
Texas  Central  and  its  high-speed  rail 
project fall within Chapter 131’s scope, 
requiring  that  doubt  to  be  resolved  in 
the landowner’s favor. 
 

 Trespass To Try Title 
a)  Stelly v. DeLoach, 644 S.W.3d 
657  (Tex.  Apr.  8,  2022)  (per 
curiam) [21-0065]  

The  Supreme  Court  decided 
Brumley  v.  McDuff,  616  S.W.3d  826 
(Tex.  2021)  after  the  court  of  appeals 
made its decision in this case. In Brum-
ley,  the  Court  held  that  the  Brumleys 
pleaded  the  elements  of  a  trespass-to-

were subject to a four-year limitations 
period. Triex pleaded the discovery rule 
to  save 
its  otherwise  time-barred 
claims. 
 
The  trial  court  granted  Marcus 
&  Millichap’s  motion  for  summary 
judgment  on  limitations  grounds.  The 
court of appeals reversed. It concluded 
that  the  evidence  conclusively  estab-
lished  that  Triex  knew  it  was  injured 
when Taylor Petroleum defaulted, but, 
applying the discovery rule, it held that 
there  was  a  fact  issue  as  to  whether 
Triex  knew  or  should  have  known  in 
2012  that  Marcus  &  Millichap  caused 
its injury. In reaching this holding, the 
court of appeals concluded that because 
there  was  a  fiduciary  relationship  be-
tween  Triex  and  Marcus  &  Millichap, 
Triex had no duty to make a diligent in-
quiry into its possible claims.  

In a per curiam opinion, the Su-
preme  Court  reversed.  It  concluded 
that  the  discovery  rule  applied  to 
Triex’s  claims,  but,  as  prior  cases  ex-
plain, a fiduciary relationship does not 
eliminate a plaintiff’s duty of reasona-
ble diligence. It also noted that the dis-
covery rule does not delay accrual until 
the plaintiff knows the exact identity of 
the wrongdoer. Accordingly, the Court 
held that despite the fiduciary relation-
ship,  Triex  was  required  to  exercise 
reasonable  diligence,  and  had  it  done 
so, it should have timely discovered the 
facts  giving  rise  to  its  claims  against 
Marcus  &  Millichap.  The  Court  rein-
stated the trial court’s summary judg-
ment. 

   

try title claim even though they did not 
title the claim that way in their plead-
ings.  Similarly,  here,  all  parties  knew 
that Stelly sought settled ownership of 
the  land  at  issue,  even  though  he 
brought a breach-of-contract claim. Un-
der  the  standards  in  Brumley,  the 
Court  held  that  Stelly  did  accurately 
plead  a  trespass-to-try  title  claim  and 
the four-year statute of limitations ap-
plicable  to  a  breach  of  contract  claim 
does not apply.  

The  Court  reversed  the  court  of 
appeals on that issue and remanded for 
further considerations. 
 

 
 Discovery Rule 
a)  Marcus  &  Millichap  Real 
Est. Inv. Servs. of Nev., Inc. v. 
Triex  Tex.  Holdings,  LLC, 
659 S.W.3d 456 (Tex. Jan. 13, 
2023) (per curiam) [21-0913] 
The  issue  in  this  case  is  the 
proper application of the discovery rule 
to a breach of fiduciary duty claim. In 
2008,  Triex  bought  a  gas  station  in 
Lubbock and leased it back to its exist-
ing  operator,  Taylor  Petroleum.  Triex 
and  the  gas  station’s  owner  both  re-
tained Marcus & Millichap to represent 
them in the transaction. In 2012, Tay-
lor Petroleum defaulted on the lease. A 
little over three years later, Triex sued 
Taylor  Petroleum  and  related  parties. 
After deposing Taylor Petroleum’s cor-
porate  officers  a  year  later,  Triex  sus-
pected  that  Marcus  &  Millichap  mis-
represented the sale and lease transac-
tion,  and  added  the  company  to  the 
suit.  Triex  asserted  claims  for  fraud, 
breach  of  fiduciary  duty,  and  conspir-
acy,  which  allegedly  occurred  during 
the  2008  transaction.  These  claims

 Tolling 
a)  Berry  v.  Berry,  646  S.W.3d 
516 (Tex. May 13, 2022) [20-
0687] 

This  case  concerned  the  statute 
of  limitations  and  several  issues  of 
trust  law.  Laura  and  Marvin  Berry 
owned  a  contracting  company  called 
Berry  Contracting.  They  also  owned  a 
ranch called Flying Bull Ranch. Berry 
Contracting and Berry family members 
used the Ranch for business and pleas-
ure. Marvin and Laura had four sons—
Kenneth,  Dennis,  Marvin  G.,  and  Al-
len. The parents transferred ownership 
of the Ranch to a limited partnership. 
The parents later transferred their lim-
ited  partnership  interest  to  the  Berry 
Dynasty Trust. The four brothers were 
trustees of the Trust. The Trust Agree-
ment states that the sons and their is-
sue  are  “demand  beneficiaries”  of  the 
Trust.  After  Marvin  died,  Laura  be-
came  the  sole  manager  of  the  Ranch. 
Laura  also  owned  a  company  called 
Berry Ranches. 

Kenneth  was  the  former  presi-
dent  of  Berry  Contracting.  For  many 
years,  Berry  Contracting  paid  rent  to 
the  Partnership  under  an  oral  lease, 
but there was evidence that lease pay-
ments were not made in some years or 
were  not  made  to  the  Partnership  but 
were instead made to Laura’s company 
Berry  Ranches.  In  March  2007,  Berry 
Contracting  and  the  Partnership  exe-
cuted a written lease for the first time. 
The  lease  was  for  an  initial  term  of 
twenty-five  years,  renewable  for  up  to 
ninety-nine  years.  In  December  2008, 
the lease was summarized in a Memo-
randum of Lease that was filed in the 
courthouse records. 

Kenneth  and  his  daughter 

100 
 

Chelsea sued Kenneth’s three brothers, 
the  Ranch,  Berry  Contracting,  and 
Berry  Ranches.  The  plaintiffs  alleged 
that Berry Contracting did not pay for 
its  use  of  the  Ranch,  that  lease  pay-
ments  were  wrongfully  sent  to  the 
Berry  Ranches  and  then  re-routed  to 
the  brothers  as  “kick-backs,”  that  the 
rent under the lease was set at a below-
market  amount,  and  that  the  term  of 
the  lease  was  excessively  long  and  in 
violation  of  the  Partnership  Agree-
ment,  which  stated  that  leases  could 
not exceed three years. The suit alleged 
that Kenneth’s brothers, as trustees of 
the Trust, breached their fiduciary du-
ties  and  that  the  other  defendants 
aided and abetted such breaches. Ken-
neth sued as a beneficiary and trustee 
of the Trust and sued in a derivative ca-
pacity  on  behalf  of  the  Partnership. 
Chelsea  sued  as  a  beneficiary  of  the 
Trust. 

After  the  suit  was  filed,  the  de-
fendants and other family members ex-
ecuted  a  Consent  Agreement  which 
provided  for  payment  of  $440,000  in 
unpaid rent to the Partnership, a mod-
ification  of  the  lease  to  a  three-year 
term, and a statement that the claims 
in this suit were not in the best interest 
of the Trust and should not be further 
pursued. 

The  defendants  filed  a  plea  to 
the  jurisdiction/motion  to  dismiss/mo-
tion  for  summary  judgment  asserting 
that  Chelsea  lacked  standing  to  seek 
relief, and that Kenneth lacked stand-
ing to seek relief as a trustee or in a de-
rivative  capacity.  The  defendants  also 
filed  a  motion  for  summary  judgment 
asserting that all claims related to the 
lease  were  barred  by  limitations.  The 
trial court granted the standing motion

b)  Zive v. Sandberg, 644 S.W.3d 
169 (Tex. Apr. 22, 2022) [20-
0922] 
issue 

in  this  case  was 
whether the rule announced in Hughes 
v. Mahaney & Higgins, 821 S.W.2d 154 
(Tex. 1991)—that the statute of limita-
tions  for  a  legal  malpractice  claim  is 
tolled until all appeals of the underly-
ing  action  are  concluded—applies  to 
appellate  proceedings  in  which  the 
malpractice  plaintiff  does  not  partici-
pate.  Jeffrey  R.  Sandberg  represented 
Youval Zive in a deficiency action aris-
ing out of Zive’s personal guaranty of a 
loan. Settlement attempts failed, alleg-
edly  because  of  Sandberg’s  malprac-
tice,  and  the  trial  court  entered  sum-
mary  judgment  in  the  lender’s  favor. 
Zive  and  his  co-parties  appealed,  and 
on April 1, 2016, the Supreme Court de-
nied Zive’s petition for review and the 
separate petition filed by his co-parties. 
Zive  took  no  further  action  regarding 
his  petition,  and  when  his  co-parties 
filed a petition for writ of certiorari in 
the  United  States  Supreme  Court,  he 
did  not  attempt  to  join  or  otherwise 
support their petition. 

On  October  1,  2018,  Zive  filed 
this  legal  malpractice  suit  against 
Sandberg.  Sandberg  moved  for  sum-
mary  judgment,  arguing  that  Zive’s 
malpractice  claim  accrued  on  April  1, 
2016, and therefore was barred by the 
two-year  statute  of  limitations.  The 
trial  court  granted  Sandberg’s  motion 
and rendered a take-nothing judgment. 
The  court  of  appeals  affirmed.  A  dis-
sent  contended  that  Hughes  tolling 
should encompass the period in which 
further appellate relief is available to a 
party, even if the party ultimately does 
not pursue it.  

summary 

judgment 
and  granted 
against Kenneth on the limitations mo-
tion. The court of appeals affirmed the 
rulings  on  standing  and  reversed  the 
ruling on limitations. 

The  Supreme  Court  affirmed  in 
part and reversed in part. It held that 
Kenneth’s  claims  against  his  co-trus-
tees  for  breach  of  fiduciary  duty  were 
barred  by  limitations.  The  suit  was 
filed in 2016 and concerned inadequate 
lease  payments  during  the  2000  to 
2007 period. Kenneth’s  status as trus-
tee, the highly adversarial nature of his 
relationship  with  his  bothers,  his  ac-
tual  knowledge  of  the  oral  lease,  and 
the recorded instrument all compel the 
conclusion that Kenneth was not some-
how lulled into inaction that should toll 
the running of limitations. 

The Court held that Chelsea was 
authorized  to  bring  suit  under  the 
Property Code. But Kenneth, as one of 
four trustees, did not have authority to 
sue on behalf of the Trust. The brothers 
and  others  provided  in  the  Consent 
Agreement  that  they  did  not  wish  to 
pursue  such  claims.  The  Court  con-
cluded that one trustee could not pur-
sue  claims  on behalf of  the  Trust  that 
the other trustees did not wish to pur-
sue. The Court also held that Kenneth 
had no legal authority to bring a deriv-
ative  claim  on  behalf  of  the  Partner-
ship.  While  Texas law  sometimes  per-
mits a limited partner to bring a deriv-
ative claim on behalf of a limited part-
nership,  Kenneth  was  not  a  limited 
partner of the Partnership.

This  case  concerned  a  franchise 
tax dispute over the method of allocat-
ing  the  proportion  of  services  per-
formed in Texas. Sirius XM Radio sells 
satellite radio services to customers in 
Texas  and  elsewhere.  The  content  is 
largely  produced  outside  of  Texas  and 
is  transmitted  on  equipment  largely 
outside of Texas. Customers can access 
the  service  by  purchasing  a  radio  and 
paying a subscription fee. A chip set in 
the radio decrypts the signal. If a cus-
tomer pays the fee, Sirius sends a sig-
nal  from  out  of  state  that  permits  the 
chip set to decrypt the signal. 
The Texas franchise tax is based 
 
on  three  steps.  First  the  taxpayer’s 
“margin” is calculated. Second, the “ap-
portioned margin” is calculated as the 
ratio  of  the  taxpayer’s  gross  receipts 
from  business  done  in  Texas,  over  the 
gross receipts from the entire business. 
Third,  permitted  deductions  are  ap-
plied to the apportioned margin to yield 
the  “taxable  margin”  to  which  the  tax 
rate  is  applied. This appeal  concerned 
the second step. 
 
The  apportioned  margin  de-
pends  on  the  proportion  of  the  tax-
payer’s receipts that are “gross receipts 
from business done in this state,” TEX. 
TAX  CODE  §  171.106(a),  which  in  turn 
depends on receipts from “each service

act,”  was  the  service  of  unscrambling

The Supreme Court affirmed the 
court  of  appeals’  judgment.  First,  the 
Court held that Hughes tolling extends 
through only the appellate proceedings 
in which the malpractice plaintiff par-
ticipates.  Noting  its  preference  for 
bright-line  rules,  the  Court  concluded 
it  would  be  easier  for  courts  and  liti-
gants to calculate Hughes tolling’s end 
date by looking to the last action taken 
by the malpractice plaintiff. The Court 
also observed that this rule did not im-
pose a burden on the malpractice plain-
tiff, who could benefit from Hughes toll-
ing  during  the  pendency  of  appellate 
proceedings  initiated  by  a  co-party  so 
long as he joined in those proceedings. 
Finally,  the  Court  reasoned  that  this 
rule was most consistent with the gen-
eral principle that a reversal on appeal 
as to one party does not warrant a re-
versal as to non-appealing parties.  

The  Court  further  held  that  for 
purposes of Hughes tolling, the date on 
which  the  litigation  is  “finally  con-
cluded”  is  the  date  the  court  in  which 
the case is pending rules on the last ac-
tion taken by the malpractice plaintiff. 
Although  it  acknowledged  that  there 
were  other  potential  terminal  points, 
the Court determined that these alter-
the 
natives  would  overcomplicate 
straightforward  Hughes  analysis.  Ap-
plying  Hughes  to  this  case,  the  Court 
concluded that Hughes tolling ended on 
April  1,  2016,  when  the  Court  denied 
Zive’s petition for review in the under-
lying case.

 Premium  and  Maintenance 

Taxes 

a)  Hegar  v.  Health  Care  Serv. 
Corp.,  652  S.W.3d  39  (June 
17, 2022) [21-0080]  

The  issue  in  this  case  was 
whether  the  Comptroller  correctly  as-
sessed taxes against an insurer’s sales 
of  stop-loss  policies  under  Insurance 
Code Chapters 222 and 257.   

The Texas Department of Insur-
ance approved Blue Cross Blue Shield 
to  sell  and  issue  stop-loss  policies  to 
employers that self-fund their employ-
ees’  health  insurance.  The  policies  in-
demnify the policyholder for amounts it 
pays  to  reimburse  health-care  claims 
above a specific threshold. The thresh-
old is set for each covered employee as 
well as for the entire covered group. In 
calendar year 2012, Blue Cross paid a 
premium  tax  on  the  stop-loss  policies 
under Insurance Code Chapter 222 and 
a  maintenance  tax  under  Insurance 
Code Chapter 257. It filed suit to obtain 
a  refund  of  these  taxes.  On  cross-mo-
tions  for  summary  judgment,  the  dis-
trict court ruled in favor of Blue Cross, 
and the court of appeals affirmed. The 
Supreme Court granted the Comptrol-
ler’s petition for review.  

The premium tax applies to pre-
miums  received  “from  any  kind  of  . . . 
insurance  policy  or  contract  covering 
risks on individuals or groups . . . aris-
ing from the business of . . . health in-
surance.”  TEX. INS. CODE  § 222.002(b). 
The  Comptroller  argued  that  the  poli-
cies  cover  risks  on  individuals  and 
groups  because  the  policies  reimburse 
health-care claims above the individual 
and  aggregate  attachment  points, 
which  are  directly  tied  to  payment  of 
individual  and  group  health-care 

the radio signal. Sirius argued that the 
relevant  receipt-producing  acts  were 
the use of equipment and personnel to 
produce  and  broadcast  the  radio  con-
tent. 

Sirius paid the tax under protest 
and sought a refund. The district court 
agreed  with  Sirius  as  to  the  correct 
method for calculating the apportioned 
margin  and  ordered  a  substantial  re-
fund.  The  court  of  appeals  reversed, 
agreeing with the Comptroller that the 
relevant receipt-producing act was un-
scrambling the radio signal. 

The Supreme Court reversed the 
court  of  appeals.  The  Court  held  that 
“service performed in this State” refers 
here  to  the  production  and  broadcast-
ing  of  radio  content,  which  occurs  al-
most  entirely  outside  of  Texas.  The 
Court, under a plain-meaning analysis 
of the statute, concluded that a service 
is performed in this State if the labor is 
done  in  this  State.  If  technology  per-
forms the useful act, the location of the 
equipment  is  considered.  Prior  cases 
have likewise looked to the location of 
the  taxpayer’s  personnel  and  equip-
ment in determining the place where a 
service  is  performed.  The  Court  also 
looked  to  the  economic  realities  of  the 
service  and  reasoned  that  customers 
are  paying  for  the  content  Sirius  pro-
duces and broadcasts, not decryption. 

The  Court  reversed  the  court  of 
appeals’  judgment  and  remanded  the 
case  to  that  court  for  consideration  of 
issues that court had not reached.

claims. Blue Cross responded that the 
stop-loss policies do not cover risks on 
individuals or groups because the self-
insured  employers  were  not  natural 
persons.  

or 

individually 

The  Supreme  Court  held  that 
Section  222.002(b)  unambiguously im-
posed  a  tax  on  stop-loss  policies,  and 
that  the  presumption  in  favor  of  the 
taxpayer  did  not  apply.  The  policies 
cover  risks  on  individuals  and  groups 
because  the  risk  the  policy  covers  is 
that the covered individuals will either 
collectively 
incur 
health-care  costs  above  the  threshold 
amount.  The  Court  observed  that  the 
statute’s  inclusion  of  an  exception  for 
stop-loss policies issued to HMOs sup-
ported  the  conclusion  that  other  stop-
loss policies are taxable. The Court also 
looked to the statute’s use of the word 
“group”  to  mean  “a  single  nonprofit 
trust” in Section 222.002(c) to foreclose 
a  reading  of  the  statute  that  limited 
“group”  to  mean  multiple  natural  per-
sons.  

Blue Cross also argued that the 
stop-loss policies did not arise from the 
business  of  health  insurance.  The 
Court  held  that  the  policies  do  arise 
from  the  business  of  health  insurance 
because  payments  under  the  policies 
directly relate to the obligation to pro-
vide health-care coverage.  

The  maintenance  tax  applies  to 
premiums  “collected  from  writing  life, 
health,  and  accident  insurance  in  this 
state.”  TEX.  INS.  CODE  § 257.003(a)(1). 
The  Comptroller  argued  that  Blue 
Cross is only authorized to sell health 
insurance;  if  the  stop-loss  policies  are 
not  health  insurance  then  Blue  Cross 
lacks  authorization  to  sell  them.  Blue 
losses 
Cross  responded 

that 

the 

104 
 

covered  by  health  insurance—bodily 
injury, death, or sickness—can only be 
suffered  by  natural  persons,  not  em-
ployers.  

The Court held that, because the 
purpose  of  the  maintenance  tax  is  to 
cover the costs of regulating the health 
insurance industry, the relevant ques-
tion  is  whether  the  stop-loss  policies 
are regulated as health insurance. Blue 
Cross  conceded  that  stop-loss  policies 
are  treated  as  accident  and  health  in-
surance for administrative and regula-
tory purposes.  

Justice Blacklock filed a dissent-
ing  opinion,  joined  by  Justice  Devine, 
Justice Busby, and Justice Young. The 
dissenting  justices  agreed  with  the 
Court that the stop-loss policies are un-
ambiguously  subject  to  the  mainte-
nance  tax.  However,  the  dissent  con-
cluded that the stop-loss policies do not 
unambiguously  cover  risks  on  individ-
uals  or  groups.  The  dissent  would 
therefore  have  applied  the  presump-
tion  in  favor  of  the  taxpayer  and  af-
firmed the court of appeals.  
 

 Property Tax 
a)  In  re  Stetson  Renewables 
Holdings,  LLC  and  Ogallala 
Renewable  Project,  LLC,  658 
S.W.3d  292  (Tex.  Dec.  30, 
2022) (per curiam) [22-1119] 
The issue in this case is whether 
applicants in a statutory tax-incentive 
program  have  a  judicially  enforceable 
right to compel the Comptroller to pro-
cess their applications.  

Chapter  313  of  the  Texas  Tax 
Code establishes a tax program that al-
lows  school  districts  to  offer  property-
tax  incentives  to  businesses  willing  to 
make investments within the districts’ 

boundaries.  The  Legislature  gave  the 
Comptroller  a  supervisory  role  over 
this  program,  part  of  which  includes 
completing  an  economic-impact  evalu-
ation  and  issuing  certificates  of  ap-
proval (or a written explanation of a de-
nial) to businesses that apply. Relators 
in this case are renewable-energy busi-
nesses that submitted Chapter 313 ap-
plications.  The  Comptroller  informed 
them,  however,  that  because  of  the 
high volume of applications submitted, 
the limited resources of his office, and 
Chapter 313’s statutory deadline of De-
cember 31, 2022, he will not be able to 
process their applications.  

In response, the businesses filed 
a petition for writ of mandamus and a 
motion for temporary relief against the 
Comptroller, asking the Court to order 
the  Comptroller  to  review  their  Chap-
ter 313 applications and to extend the 
statutory expiration date of the Chap-
ter  313  program  to  accommodate  the 
influx  of  applications.  In  support  of 
these  requests,  the  businesses  argued 
that  Chapter  313  imposed  a  manda-
tory,  non-discretionary  duty  on  the 
Comptroller  to  process  their  applica-
tions.  They  pointed  out,  for  example, 
that Chapter 313 says the Comptroller 
“shall”  complete  applicants’  economic-
impact evaluations within ninety days. 
The  Supreme  Court,  however, 
denied the businesses’ mandamus peti-
tion and motion for temporary relief. It 
held that the businesses did not have a 
judicially  enforceable  right  to  compel 
the Comptroller to process their appli-
cations.  The  Court  agreed  that,  even 
though the Comptroller’s duties might 
be  mandatory  and  non-discretionary, 
nothing  in  the  statute  indicated  that 
the  Court  was  meant  to  enforce  the 

105 
 

deadline. Even in the absence of a judi-
cially crafted remedy, the Court said, a 
statutory  command  remains  a  statu-
tory command because the Legislature 
has  many  ways  to  correct  the  execu-
tive’s  failure  to  abide  by  a  statutory 
deadline.  The  Court  further  reasoned 
that  a  judicial  remedy  could  also  in-
trude  on  the  Legislature’s  prerogative 
to  determine  not  only  when  a  tax-in-
centive program must end but also how 
far it is worth pressing to achieve com-
pliance with a statutory directive. For 
those  reasons,  the  Court  concluded 
that the businesses were not entitled to 
mandamus relief.  
 

 

 Permits 
a)  Gabriel Inv. Grp. v. Tex. Alco-
holic  Beverage  Comm’n,  646 
S.W.3d  790  (Tex.  June  17, 
2022) [22-0062] 

This certified question case con-
cerned  the  Texas  Alcoholic  Beverage 
Code’s prohibition against public corpo-
rations owning certain permits. 

“Package  stores”  sell  alcohol  to 
the public and require a permit issued 
by the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Com-
mission  (TABC).  In  1995,  the  Legisla-
ture enacted section 22.16(a) of the Al-
coholic Beverage Code to prohibit pub-
lic corporations (as defined by that sec-
tion)  from  owning  or  controlling  pack-
age stores. Subsection (a) provides that 
“[a]  package  store  permit  may  not  be 
held by a public corporation, or by any 
entity  which  is  directly  or  indirectly 
owned or controlled, in whole or in part, 
by a public corporation, or by any entity 
which  would  hold  the  package  store 
permit  for  the  benefit  of  a  public 

Investment 
corporation.”  Gabriel 
Group,  Inc.  owns  forty-five  package 
stores  in  South  Texas.  Although  pub-
licly owned, it fell under a grandfather 
clause, section 22.16(f), which provides 
that “[t]his section shall not apply” to a 
public  corporation  which  held  a  pack-
age store permit on April 28, 1995. 

In  2019,  Gabriel  filed  for  Chap-
ter 11 bankruptcy protection. The par-
ties represented that, as part of a pro-
posed  bankruptcy  plan,  Gabriel  would 
remain  the  same  corporation  and 
would  continue  to  hold  its  existing 
package store permits and acquire new 
ones. Gabriel proposed to sell all or part 
of its shares to another public corpora-
tion but was unsure if its planned stock 
sale to another, non-exempt public cor-
poration would affect its exemption un-
der  subsection  (f).  Gabriel  sued  the 
TABC for a declaratory judgment, and 
the  bankruptcy  court  granted  sum-
mary judgment declaring that Gabriel 
would no longer be exempt under sub-
section (f) from the ban on public-corpo-
ration ownership of package store per-
mits.  The  district  court  affirmed  the 
bankruptcy court. Gabriel sought Fifth 
Circuit review. 

The  Fifth  Circuit  certified  the 
following questions of Texas law to the 
Texas Supreme Court: 

1.  If Texas Alcoholic Bev-
erage  Code  Section  22.16(f)  ex-
empts a package store from Sec-
tion 22.16(a), and if the package 
store sells any, most, or all of its 
shares to a corporation that does 
not  itself  qualify  under  Section 
22.16(f), will the package store’s 
package  store  permits  remain 
valid? 

2.    If  yes  to  (1),  can  the 

106 
 

package  store  validly  accumu-
late  additional  package  store 
permits  by  reason  of  Section 
22.16(f)? 

The Supreme Court accepted the 
certified  questions  and  answered  both 
questions  “yes.”  The  parties  agreed 
that  the  certified  questions  should  be 
construed to ask about a public corpo-
ration’s  package  store  permits,  not  a 
“package  store’s  package  store  per-
mits.” 

As  to  the  first  question,  the 
Court held that subsection (f)’s exemp-
tion  remains  operative  if  an  exempt 
public corporation sells its shares to a 
non-exempt  corporation.  The  Court 
reasoned that subsection (f)’s reference 
to  “this  section,”  which  “shall  not  ap-
ply”  to  an  exempt  corporation,  could 
only mean the entirety of section 22.16, 
including  subsection  (a)’s  prohibitions 
against  ownership  of  package  store 
permits by public corporations.  

The  Court  rejected  TABC’s  con-
struction of section 22.16 to mean that 
ownership of an exempt corporation by 
a non-exempt corporation prohibits the 
exempt corporation from having a per-
mit.  TABC’s  reading  would  “apply” 
subsection  (a)  to  the  exempt  corpora-
tion,  in  violation  of  the  subsection  (f) 
dictate  that  the  entirety  of  section 
22.16 “shall not apply” to exempt corpo-
rations. The Court held that the statute 
should  be  interpreted  as  unambigu-
ously written. While permitting a large 
public  corporation  to  own  and  control 
an exempt corporation might run coun-
ter to subsection (a)’s apparent purpose 
of banning ownership of a permit by a 
public corporation as well as any entity 
which is controlled by a public non-ex-
empt  corporation,  the  subsection  (f) 

granting him habeas relief based on the 
trial  court’s  findings  that  G.S.’s  attor-
ney gave him “erroneous advice regard-
ing parole eligibility.” He also included 
a copy of the district attorney’s motion 
to dismiss the charges.  

The Texas Comptroller of Public 
Accounts  denied  G.S.’s  application  for 
compensation. G.S. filed an application 
to cure in November 2015 and included 
a  copy  of  the  alleged  victim’s  written 
declaration  recanting  her  accusations. 
The  Comptroller  denied  that  applica-
tion as well.  

In October 2016, the district at-
torney  recommended  that  all  records 
regarding  G.S.’s  arrest  and  conviction 
be  expunged,  which  the  trial  court 
granted. Over the next four years, G.S. 
filed  four  more  applications  for  com-
pensation, with which he included cop-
ies  of  the  expunction  recommendation 
and  order.  The  Comptroller  denied  all 
four.  G.S.  filed  his  petition  for  writ  of 
mandamus in the Supreme Court.  

The Court held that G.S. had not 
established that he is “actual innocent” 
as  the  Act  requires.  The  Act  provides 
three  methods  of  establishing  eligibil-
ity,  two  relevant  to  this  case.  The 
claimant  can  show  he  “has  been 
granted relief in accordance with a writ 
of  habeas  corpus  that  is  based  on  a 
court finding or determination that the 
person is actually innocent of the crime 
for which the person was sentenced” or 
that  the  trial  court  dismissed  the 
charge against the claimant “based on 
a motion to dismiss in which the state’s 
attorney  states  that  no  credible  evi-
dence exists that inculpates the defend-
ant and . . . the state’s attorney believes 
that the defendant is actually innocent 

exception  unambiguously  applies  to 
the entirety of section 22.16, including 
all  of  subsection  (a).  Statutory  excep-
tions, by their nature, limit the scope of 
the general rule and do not necessarily 
advance  the  purposes  behind  the  gen-
eral rule. 

As  to  the  second  certified  ques-
tion,  the  Court  also  answered  it  “yes” 
because  TABC  offered  no  argument 
that  the  Court  could  answer  it  “no”  if 
the first question was answered in the 
affirmative. 
 

Eligibility for Compensation 
a)  In  re  G.S.,  644  S.W.3d  160 
(Tex. Apr. 22, 2022) [21-0127] 
This  case  concerns  whether  an 
applicant under the Tim Cole Act ade-
quately  established  his  “actual  inno-
cence.”  

In September 2010, G.S. pleaded 
guilty  to  indecency  with  a  child  and 
was  sentenced  to  seven  years’  impris-
onment.  Four  years  later,  he  applied 
for  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus,  arguing 
that his attorney had provided ineffec-
tive  assistance  by  incorrectly  advising 
him  when  he  would  be  eligible  for  pa-
role. After a hearing, the trial court rec-
ommended that the Court of Criminal 
Appeals reverse G.S.’s conviction. It did 
and remanded the case for a new trial. 
While the case was pending in the trial 
court on remand, G.S.’s alleged victim 
admitted that she had lied. The district 
attorney  moved  that  the  case  be  dis-
missed “pending further investigation.”  
In September 2015, G.S. applied 
for  wrongful-imprisonment  compensa-
tion  under  the  Tim  Cole  Act.  He  in-
cluded  with  his  application  a  copy  of 
the Court of Criminal Appeals’ opinion 

   

107 
 

of  the  crime  for  which  the  person  was 
sentenced.”  

The Court held that G.S. did not 
establish  that  he  was  granted  habeas 
relief “based on a court finding or deter-
mination” that he “is actually innocent 
of  the  crime”  for  which  he  was  sen-
tenced. G.S. argued he satisfied this el-
igibility method the same way the ap-
plicant  did  in  In  re  Allen,  366  S.W.3d 
696  (Tex.  2012),  in  which  the  Court 
held  that  the  Court  of  Criminal  Ap-
peals implicitly made a Schlup-type ac-
tual-innocence finding when it granted 
habeas relief based on ineffective assis-
tance of counsel. But G.S.’s habeas pe-
tition  was  not  based  on  a  Schlup-type 
claim for relief. Schlup applies when a 
procedural  bar  prevents  a  claimant 
from  obtaining  habeas  relief  despite 
the  existence  of  new  evidence  estab-
lishing the claimant’s actual innocence. 
G.S.’s constitutional claim was not pro-
cedurally  barred  and  was,  in  fact, 
heard and ruled upon by the trial court 
and the Court of Criminal Appeals.  

The  Supreme  Court  then  held 
that G.S. did not establish that the trial 
court dismissed the charge against him 
“based on a motion to dismiss in which 
the state’s attorney states that no cred-
ible evidence exists that inculpates the 
defendant and . . . the state’s attorney 
believes that the defendant is actually 
innocent of the crime for which the per-
son  was  sentenced.”  Here,  the  trial 
court  dismissed  the  case  based  on  the 
district attorney’s motion, but the mo-
tion stated only that the district attor-
ney wished to dismiss “pending further 
investigation.” The Court therefore de-
nied mandamus relief. 

Justice  Lehrmann  joined  the 
majority  opinion  but  also  filed  a 

108 
 

concurring opinion to express her con-
cern that the statute can in some cases 
deny  relief  to  the  very  people  the  Act 
was  intended  to  compensate.  In  this 
case,  if  the  exculpatory  evidence  had 
surfaced  earlier,  G.S.  could  have  been 
entitled to habeas relief on actual-inno-
cence  grounds  and  thus  eligible  for 
compensation under the Tim Cole Act. 
Or  if  the  case  hadn’t  been  dismissed, 
the district attorney could have filed a 
motion  with  the  requisite  statutory 
language  regarding  a  lack  of  credible 
evidence  and  the  attorney’s  belief  of 
G.S.’s  actual  innocence.  Second,  relief 
could  hinge  on  the  apparently  unbri-
dled discretion of the state’s attorney to 
include or not include the requisite lan-
guage in a motion to dismiss following 
receipt of exculpatory evidence. Justice 
Lehrmann  suggested  the  legislature 
consider  amending  the  Act  to  address 
these concerns.

626  S.W.3d  1  (Tex.  App.—

ston  [14th  Dist.]  2021),  pet. 
granted  (Sept.  30,  2022)  [21-
0755] 

These cases concern the Fire and 
Police  Employee  Relations  Act,  which 
created a judicial alternative to strikes 

and  other  labor  techniques  to  protect 
the public from the dangers of a strik-
ing fire or police force. The Act requires 
that the compensation and other condi-
tions  of  employment  for  firefighters 
and  police  officers  are  “substantially 
the  same  as  compensation  and  condi-
tions of employment prevailing in com-
parable  private  sector  employment.” 
The Act creates an alternative mecha-
nism through which a public employer 
and firefighters can engage in non-com-
pulsory arbitration or judicial enforce-
ment of the standards of the Act if the 
employer refuses to arbitrate. The judi-
cial-enforcement  provision  allows  a 
trial court to “declare the compensation 
or  other  conditions  of  employment  re-
quired by” the Act” for up to one year. 
The collective bargaining agree-
ment between the City of Houston and 
the  Fire  Fighters’  Association  expired 
on June 30, 2017. The parties failed to 
reach an agreement under the Act con-
cerning  compensation,  work  hours, 
overtime,  paid  leave,  staffing,  and 
grievance  procedures.  The  Association 
filed  suit  after  the  Association  re-
quested  arbitration  and  the  City  re-
fused to arbitrate. 

In  City  of  Houston,  The  Fire 
Fighters’ Association sought a declara-
tion of the compensation and other con-
ditions of employment required by the 
Act.  The  City  asserted  the  defenses  of 
governmental and sovereign immunity 
and filed a plea to the jurisdiction and 
a  motion  for  summary  judgment  chal-
lenging the constitutionality of sections 
of  the  Act.  The  trial  court  denied  the 
City’s  plea  to  the  jurisdiction  and  mo-
tion of summary judgment and granted 
the Association’s cross-motion for sum-
mary judgment on immunity. The City 

109 
 

appealed,  and  the  court  of  appeals  af-
firmed. 

In  Houston  Professional  Fire 
Fighters’  Association,  the  police  offic-
ers’  union  argued  that  the  charter 
amendment  provision  should  be  en-
joined because it is preempted by state 
law  and  it  is  void  because  it  was  not 
adopted  through  proper  procedures. 
The trial court held that the state law 
did  preempt  the  charter  amendment. 
The court of appeals reversed and held 
that it did not.  

The City and the police union pe-
titioned  the  Supreme  Court.  The  Su-
preme  Court  granted  the  petitions  for 
review  and  consolidated  the  cases  for 
oral argument. 
 

 Judicial Review 
a)  Wal-Mart  Stores, 

Inc.  v. 
Xerox  State  &  Local  Solu-
tions,  Inc.,  646  S.W.3d  546 
(Tex.  App.—Dallas  2020), 
pet.  granted  (May  27,  2022) 
[20-0980] 

 
This case addresses whether the 
court  of  appeals  erred  in  holding  that 
Wal-Mart  could  not  recover  tort  and 
breach-of-contract damages from Xerox 
after  Wal-Mart  incurred  losses  during 
a massive system outage.  

The Supplemental Nutrition As-
sistance  Program  (SNAP)  is  a  federal 
program that provides nutritional sup-
port for qualifying low-income individ-
uals  and  families.  Wal-Mart  accepts 
SNAP  benefits  for  qualifying  food 
items. Xerox contracts with state agen-
cies,  which  administer  SNAP,  to  pro-
vide electronic verification of such pur-
chases.  In  October  2013,  Xerox’s  sys-
tem unexpectedly went offline for more 
than  ten  hours,  impacting  more  than 

1,400 Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club stores. 
During the outage, Wal-Mart employed 
a backup system (“store-and-forward”) 
that allows it to store transactions and 
re-submit them for authorization when 
the system is restored.  

Wal-Mart  alleges  that  during 
the outage, Xerox misrepresented that 
the system was back online when it was 
still down, causing Wal-Mart to prema-
turely submit some transactions for au-
thorization.  When  Xerox’s  system  de-
nied  these  transactions,  Wal-Mart’s 
system  automatically  deleted  them. 
Other  transactions  were  successfully 
submitted and processed after the out-
age but were denied because the SNAP 
insufficient 
possessed 
beneficiary 
funds or used an invalid PIN number. 
Wal-Mart  alleges  Xerox  breached  its 
contracts  with  the  state  agencies  by 
failing to indemnify Wal-Mart for these 
transactions.  Overall,  Wal-Mart  al-
leges  it  incurred  over  $2  million  in 
losses. It sued Xerox for negligence and 
negligent  misrepresentation.  It  also 
sued  Xerox  for  breach-of-contract,  al-
leging it was a third-party beneficiary 
to  Xerox’s  contracts  with  the  state 
agencies. 
 
The  trial  court  granted  Xerox’s 
motions  for  summary  judgment.  The 
court of appeals affirmed. First, it held 
that  federal  regulation  bars  retailers 
from suing third-party processors when 
their  damages  occur  while  employing 
the  store-and-forward  backup  system. 
It also held that Wal-Mart failed to al-
lege negligent misrepresentations sub-
jecting Xerox to liability, and Xerox did 
not owe Wal-Mart a tort duty. Finally, 
the  court  rejected  Wal-Mart’s  breach-
of-contract claim on grounds that Wal-

110 
 

Mart failed to establish its status as a 
third-party beneficiary. 
 
Wal-Mart  petitioned  the  Su-
preme Court for review. It argues that 
the regulation only shields state agen-
cies from liability and the court of ap-
peals’  interpretation  would  unjustifi-
ably  pre-empt  state  common-law  tort 
actions. Second, Wal-Mart argues that 
Xerox  was  not  entitled  to  summary 
judgment on Wal-Mart’s breach-of-con-
tract  claims  because  the  entirety  of 
Xerox’s  contracts  with  the  states  are 
not in the record. Finally, Wal-Mart ar-
gues that the court of appeals erred in 
holding  that  Xerox  did  not  owe  Wal-
Mart a tort duty, that Wal-Mart did not 
establish  its  third-party  beneficiary 
status, and that Wal-Mart did not have 
a  viable  negligent  misrepresentation 
claim.  Xerox  argues  that  Wal-Mart’s 
system  configuration  constitutes  a  su-
perseding cause of its losses because it 
prevented  Wal-Mart  from  re-submit-
ting  transactions  denied  during  the 
outage.  The  Supreme  Court  granted 
the petition for review. 
 

 

 Arbitrability 
a)  MP Gulf of Mex., LLC v. Total 
E&P  USA,  Inc.,  647  S.W.3d 
96  (Tex.  App.—Tyler  2020), 
pet.  granted  (June  17,  2022) 
[21-0028] 

The primary issue in this case is 
whether incorporation of American Ar-
bitration  Association  (AAA)  rules  con-
stitutes  clear  and  unmistakable  evi-
dence of an intent to arbitrate the ques-
tion of arbitrability.  

MP and Total had working inter-
ests in oil and gas units that shared a 
“Common System” for production. The 

Common System was governed by two 
agreements:  the  System  Operating 
Agreement  and  the  Cost  Sharing 
Agreement. The underlying dispute in 
this  case  arose  from  MP’s  assessment 
of  about  $41  million  to  the  Common 
System,  which  Total  asserted  should 
have  been  billed  under  the  operating 
agreement of the individual unit at is-
sue. MP demanded payment and initi-
ated  mediation  under  the  System  Op-
erating Agreement’s dispute resolution 
provisions.  Mediation  was  unsuccess-
ful. 

Total sued under the Cost Shar-
ing  Agreement  seeking  declaration 
that the Cost Sharing Agreement allo-
cated  the  costs  to  the  individual  unit 
under its operating agreement, not the 
Common  System.  Total  also  initiated 
arbitration  under  that  unit’s  agree-
ment.  MP  initiated  AAA  arbitration 
under  the  System  Operating  Agree-
ment. Total moved to stay the AAA ar-
bitration, and MP moved to compel it. 
The  trial  court  denied  MP’s  motion  to 
compel  and  granted  Total’s  motion  to 
stay. 

The  court  of  appeals  reversed 
and  rendered 
judgment  compelling 
AAA  arbitration  and  lifted  the  stay. 
The court held that the System Operat-
ing  Agreement’s  incorporation  of  the 
AAA rules was clear and unmistakable 
evidence  of  the  parties’  intent  to  arbi-
trate the question of arbitrability. The 
court accordingly held that whether the 
parties’  dispute  fell  under  the  System 
Operating  Agreement’s  arbitration 
provision was for the arbitrator, not the 
courts.  Total  petitioned  the  Supreme 
Court  for  review,  which  the  Court 
granted.

 Enforcement  of  Arbitration 

Agreement  

a)  Hous. ANUSA, LLC v. Shat-
tenkirk, 657 S.W.3d 331 (Tex. 
App.—Houston  [14th  Dist.] 
2022),  pet.  granted  (Jan.  27, 
2023) [22-0214] 

The  issues  in  this  case  are  (1) 
whether  both  substantive  and  proce-
dural unconscionability must be shown 
to  establish  that  an arbitration agree-
ment is unenforceable and (2) whether 
Shattenkirk  produced  sufficient  evi-
dence to establish that the arbitration 
agreement is unconscionable due to ex-
cessive costs.  

Houston ANUSA owns and oper-
ates a car dealership in Houston. Wal-
ter  Shattenkirk  was  hired  as  its  gen-
eral  manager  but  later  fired.  He  sued 
Houston  ANUSA  for  discrimination 
and  retaliation,  alleging  that  he  was 
terminated  for  reporting  racist  com-
ments made by his supervisor. Houston 
ANUSA  moved  to  compel  arbitration 
based  on  an  agreement  that  Shatten-
kirk allegedly signed during the hiring 
process,  which  requires  the  parties  to 
arbitrate  any  claim  arising  from  the 
employment  relationship, 
including 
discrimination  claims.  The  agreement 
does not specify who would pay admin-
istrative fees, the arbitrator’s compen-
sation, or other expenses.  

The  trial  court  concluded  that 
the agreement is substantively uncon-
scionable  and  refused  to  enforce  it 
based on Shattenkirk’s argument that 
the cost of arbitration would be so high 
that  it  would  effectively  preclude  him 
from asserting his claims. The court of 
appeals affirmed, noting that no provi-
sion  in  the  agreement  caps  Shatten-
kirk’s costs and that Houston ANUSA 

failed to offer evidence to contest Shat-
tenkirk’s claim of financial hardship.  

Houston  ANUSA  petitioned  the 
Supreme  Court  for  review,  arguing 
(1) that  the  Court  should  require  a 
showing of both substantive and proce-
dural unconscionability when evaluat-
ing the unconscionability of arbitration 
agreements  and  (2)  that  Shattenkirk 
failed to meet his burden of proof on ei-
ther  substantive  or  procedural  uncon-
scionability.  The  Court  granted  Hou-
ston ANUSA’s petition for review. 
 

b)  Lennar  Homes  of  Tex.  Land 
&  Constr.,  Ltd.  v.  Whiteley, 
625 S.W.3d 569 (Tex. App.—
Houston  [14th  dist.]  2021), 
pet.  granted  (Dec.  16,  2022) 
[21-0783] 

The issue in this case is whether 
an arbitration agreement in a recorded 
deed runs with the land and therefore 
binds  the  home’s  successive  purchas-
ers.  

A homebuyer purchased a house 
from Lennar Homes. Both the deed and 
the  home’s  warranty,  which  was  at-
tached  to  the  purchase  agreement, in-
cluded  an  arbitration  agreement.  The 
original homebuyer later sold the home 
to Kara Whiteley. Soon after Whiteley 
purchased the home, she sued Lennar 
for  negligent  construction  and  breach 
of  implied  warranties,  alleging  that 
construction  defects  caused  a  serious 
mold problem in her home. 

The  trial  court  initially  stayed 
the case for arbitration over Whiteley’s 
objection. The arbitrator denied White-
ley all relief and awarded Lennar attor-
ney’s fees and costs. But after arbitra-
tion, the trial court vacated the award 
against Whiteley. Lennar appealed.   

112 
 

The  court  of  appeals  affirmed, 
holding  that  Whiteley  was  not  bound 
by  the  arbitration  provision  in  the 
deed.  Lennar  also  argued  that  four 
other,  independent  reasons  required 
Whiteley  to  arbitrate  her  claims.  But 
the court of appeals disagreed, holding 
that  (1) Whiteley  did  not  expressly  or 
impliedly  assume 
the  arbitration 
agreement  in  the  deed  when  she  pur-
chased the home, (2) Whiteley was not 
a  third-party  beneficiary  of  the  war-
ranty,  (3) direct-benefits  estoppel  did 
not  bind  Whiteley  to  the  arbitration 
the  warranty,  and 
agreement 
(4) Whiteley  did  not  waive  her  objec-
tion  to  arbitration  by  her  actions  dur-
ing arbitration. 

in 

Lennar  petitioned  the  Supreme 
Court for review. Lennar’s main argu-
ment  is  that  the  arbitration  provision 
in  the  recorded  deed  runs  with  the 
land,  binding  Whiteley  and  requiring 
her to arbitrate her claims. The Court 
granted the petition for review.  
 

 

 Attorney-Client Privilege  
a)  Franklin  Ctr.  for  Gov’t  & 
Pub. Integrity v. Univ. of Tex. 
Sys.,  ___  S.W.3d  ___,  2020 
WL 7640146 (Tex. App—Aus-
tin 2020), pet. granted (Sept. 
30, 2022) [21-0534]  

This  case  presents  the  question 
whether an independent investigator is 
a  “lawyer’s  representative”  for  pur-
poses  of  the  attorney–client  privilege 
when  the  investigator  is  not  retained 
solely for legal advice.  

The University of Texas System 
hired Kroll Associates to investigate al-
legations of improper admissions prac-
tices at UT Austin. After Kroll’s report 

Whichever party prevailed was entitled 
to  the  funds  in  the  account.  The  Su-
preme  Court  ultimately  ruled 
for 
Fischer.  When  Fischer  went  to  collect 
the funds he was entitled to, the parties 
learned  that  Holmes  had  absconded 
with the money. 

CTMI sued Fischer for a declar-
atory judgment that CTMI had fulfilled 
its  obligations  under  the  settlement 
agreement  by  placing  the  disputed 
funds  in  Holmes’  account.  Fischer 
counterclaimed  for  breach  of  contract. 
The  trial  court  rendered  judgment  for 
CTMI,  but  the  court  of  appeals  re-
versed. A main issue in the court of ap-
peals  was  whether  the  settlement 
agreement  created  a  valid  escrow 
agreement. Relying on caselaw describ-
ing  an  escrow  agreement  as  involving 
the  deposit  of  funds  with  a  neutral 
third party, the court held that the set-
tlement  agreement  did  not  create  an 
escrow agreement because Holmes was 
not  a  neutral  third  party.  The  court 
thus 
that  CTMI  had 
breached  the  agreement  by  failing  to 
pay Fischer the amount owed to him.

The  Supreme  Court  granted 

CTMI’s petition for review. 
 
 

was  released,  the  Franklin  Center 
made a request under the Texas Public 
Information  Act  for  all  documents  ob-
tained by Kroll in its investigation. In 
the litigation that ensued, the Franklin 
Center  continued  to  seek  a  subset  of 
documents that were either provided to 
Kroll  by  the  UT  System  or  created  by 
Kroll in the course of its investigation. 
The  UT  System  argues  that  all  of  the 
documents  sought  are  protected  from 
disclosure by the attorney–client privi-
lege  because  Kroll  was  serving  as  its 
“lawyer’s  representative”  under  Texas 
Rule of Evidence 503.  

The  trial  court  granted  the  UT 
System’s  motion  for  summary  judg-
ment, but the court of appeals reversed. 
The court held that Kroll is not a “law-
yer’s  representative”  and  that,  there-
fore,  none  of  the  documents  withheld 
are  exempt  from  disclosure.  The  Su-
preme Court granted the UT System’s 
petition for review. 

 
 Escrow  
a)  Fischer  v.  Boozer,  2021  WL 
(Tex.  App.—Fort 
5934465 
Worth  2021),  pet.  granted 
(Feb. 24, 2023) [22-0050] 
The  issue  in  this  case  is  who  is 
liable  when  parties  to  a  settlement 
agreement  place  disputed  funds  in  an 
account  controlled  by  the  attorney  of 
one  party,  and  the attorney  steals  the 
funds. 

The  CTMI  parties  and  Fischer 
settled  most  of  their  claims  arising 
from a previous dispute over the sale of 
a  tax-consulting  business.  The  settle-
ment agreement provided that CTMI’s 
attorney,  Holmes,  would  hold  the  dis-
puted funds in an escrow account until 
litigation.

 Class Certification 
a)  Mosaic Baybrook One, L.P. v. 
Simien, 646 S.W.3d 847 (Tex. 
App.—Houston 
[1st  Dist.] 
Sept.  22,  2020),  pet.  granted 
(June 3, 2022) [19-0612 & 21-
0159],  consolidated  for  oral 
argument 
with  Mosaic 
Baybrook One, L.P. v. Cessor, 
648 S.W.3d 299 (Tex. App.—
Houston  [1st  Dist.]  Sept.  22, 
2020),  pet.  granted  (June  3, 
2022) [21-0161] 

The  issues  in  these  cases  sur-
round  class  certification:  whether  the 
trial  courts  performed  the  required 
to  determine 
“rigorous  analysis” 
whether the certification prerequisites 
were met and whether the certification 
orders listed all the elements of the de-
fenses, as the Rules of Civil Procedure 
require.  In  addition,  one  petition  asks 
whether a court of appeals’ opinion de-
clining an application for a permissive 
interlocutory appeal must state a basic 
analysis  for  doing  so  and  whether  the 
requirements for certifying an interloc-
utory appeal were met. 

Both lawsuits stem from tenant 
complaints. Tenants of properties that 
Mosaic  owns  and  manages  pursued 
class actions, claiming that Mosaic im-
properly billed them in violation of cer-
tain  statutes.  In  Simien,  class  repre-
sentative Simien sued Mosaic under a 
provision  of  the  Water  Code  that  was 
amended  after  Simien  initiated  the 
lawsuit.  Mosaic  specially  excepted  to 
Simien’s  petition,  contending  that  the 
amendment  applied  retroactively.  It 
also  asked  the  trial  court  to  strike  Si-
mien’s request for certain penalties and 
attorney’s fees and to dismiss the claim 

114 
 

for  lack  of  jurisdiction.  The  trial  court 
overruled  the  special  exceptions,  de-
nied the motion to dismiss, and granted 
Simien’s  motion  for  partial  summary 
judgment. It certified Mosaic’s request 
for a permissive interlocutory appeal of 
the  summary-judgment  ruling,  which 
the  court  of  appeals  denied.  The  trial 
court later found that the class-certifi-
cation prerequisites were satisfied and 
certified the requested classes. In Ces-
sor, the trial court likewise granted the 
class representative’s motion for certi-
fication. 

Mosaic  perfected  interlocutory 
appeals in both cases, and the court of 
appeals  affirmed  the  certification  or-
ders.  Mosaic  argued  that  the  trial 
courts abused their discretion by certi-
fying the classes without conducting a 
rigorous analysis to determine that the 
certification  prerequisites  were  satis-
fied. The court of appeals disagreed. In 
Simien,  it  wrote  that  Mosaic’s  argu-
ments on the merits neither pointed to 
“any theory unmoored from the plead-
ings”  nor  undermined  the  trial  court’s 
finding  that  the  certification  require-
ments  were  met.  When  Mosaic  con-
tended that the trial plan should have 
expressly addressed the elements of its 
defenses, the court of appeals held that 
the trial court did not abuse its discre-
tion because the record showed that it 
had considered the defenses in deciding 
whether to certify the class. In Cessor, 
Mosaic complained that the trial court 
did  not  conduct  the  requisite  rigorous 
analysis,  but  the  court  of  appeals  ex-
plained  that  deciding  the  merits  of  a 
suit  to  determine  “its  maintainability 
as a class action is not appropriate.” It 
also  reasoned  that  the  statute’s  plain 
language  made  elaborate  analysis 

unnecessary, and the trial court’s certi-
fication order parsed the statutory lan-
guage to identify the issues of law and 
fact common to the class. 

Mosaic  petitioned  the  Supreme 
Court  for  review  in  both  cases.  The 
Court granted the petitions and consol-
idated them for argument. 
 

 

 Standing 
a)  Am.  Campus  Cmtys.,  Inc.  v. 
Berry,  646  S.W.3d  857  (Tex. 
App.—Austin  2021),  pet. 
granted  (June  3,  2022)  [21-
0874] 

The issues presented in this case 
are  (1) whether  absent  class  members 
lack standing to seek civil penalties for 
alleged violations of the Texas Property 
Code  and  (2) whether  the  court  of  ap-
peals  was  required  to  determine  and 
evaluate  the  specific  elements  for  the 
causes of action raised by the class.  

American Campus Communities 
and over thirty of its subsidiaries (col-
lectively, ACC) are landlords at various 
throughout 
properties 
residential 
Texas. Former tenants of ACC proper-
ties  filed  a  class  action  alleging  that 
ACC  violated  Section  92.056(g)  of  the 
Texas  Property  Code,  which  requires 
that  leases  contain  bold  or  underlined 
language informing tenants of the rem-
edies available when a landlord fails to 
repair or remedy conditions that mate-
rially  affect  the  tenant’s  physical 
health  or  safety.  The  tenants  further 
alleged  that  by  omitting  the  required 
language, ACC knowingly attempted to 
waive its landlord duties in violation of 
a statutory anti-waiver prohibition, en-
titling the tenants to further civil pen-
alties.  

115 
 

The  trial  court  denied  ACC’s 
summary-judgment motion and issued 
an  order  granting  class  certification. 
ACC  filed  an  interlocutory  appeal  of 
the class-certification order. The court 
of appeals modified the order to remove 
references to the tenants’ claim for de-
claratory  and  injunctive  relief,  but  it 
otherwise  affirmed  the  class  certifica-
tion.  

ACC  petitioned  the  Supreme 
Court  for  review  arguing  that  (1) the 
absent class members lack standing be-
cause they suffered no concrete injury-
in-fact,  and  (2) the  court  of  appeals 
erred  by  failing  to  examine  the  sub-
stantive  elements  of  the  underlying 
claims  in  its  predominance  analysis. 
The  Court  granted  the  petition  for  re-
view.

(Tex. App.—Waco 2021), pet. 
granted  (Oct.  21,  2022)  [21-
1006]  

The  plaintiffs  in  this  case  are 
homeowners who claim that municipal 
sewer facilities near their home caused 
the  release  of  noxious  odors.  This  ap-
peal concerns whether the homeowners 
raised sufficient evidence of a constitu-
tional taking to defeat a plea to the ju-
risdiction filed by the municipality.  

Alton and Nina Leuschner own a 
home in Robinson, Texas. The City con-
structed a sewer lift station and related 
sewage  line  near  their  home.  The 
Leuschners  noticed  severe,  foul  odors 
after  the  lift  station  was  brought  into 
service. They sued the City claiming a 
constitutional  taking.  The  City  filed  a 
jurisdiction,  attaching 
plea  to  the 

 

 Oil-and-Gas Leases
a)  MRC  Permian  Co.  v.  Point 
Energy  Partners  Permian 
LLC,  624  S.W.3d  643  (Tex. 
App.—El  Paso  2021,  pet. 
granted  (May  27,  2022)  [21-
0461] 

This case presents two questions 
about contract interpretation of oil and 
gas leases plus another question about 
tortious  interference  with  contract. 
First,  what  is  the  best  reading  of  this 
force majeure clause? Second, how does 
this  contract—and  possibly  other  oil-
and-gas contracts—measure how far a 
“wellbore  extends  horizontally  in  the 
producing  formation”?  Third,  do  the 
facts  here  present  a  fact  issue  about 
tortious interference in contract?  

MRC Permian signed four essen-
tially  identical  leases  with  mineral 
owners to develop oil and gas wells in 
the Permian Basin. After a three-year 
term,  to  retain  the  right  to  develop 
MRC had to drill a new well every 180 
days.  No  one  disputes  that  MRC 
missed  that  deadline.  Because  the 
deadline passed, Point Energy signed a 
new lease with the mineral owners. But 
MRC claims it properly gave notice un-
der  the  force  majeure  clause,  so  the 
deadline  was  extended.  Whether  that 
deadline was extended—and therefore 
leased  continued—turns  on 
MRC’s 
whether  MRC  properly  had  a  right  to 
invoke the force majeure clause. Point 
Energy  argues  a  scheduling  incident 
was the real cause of the missed dead-
line, so there was no force majeure and 
the lease terminated.  

If  the  lease  terminated  that 
leads  to  another  question  under  the 
lease.  The  lease  provides  that  upon 

affidavits  and  other  evidence  in  sup-
port  of  the  plea.  The  Leuschners  filed 
affidavits and other evidence in opposi-
tion  to  the  plea.  The district  court  de-
nied the plea, and the City filed an in-
terlocutory  appeal.  The  court  of  ap-
peals reversed and dismissed the suit. 
The court of appeals reasoned that lia-
bility  for  a  constitutional  taking  re-
quires proof that the government acted 
intentionally,  and  the  evidence  here 
did  not  show  that  the  City—in  plan-
ning  or  constructing  the  lift  station—
knew  that  the  station  would  cause 
identifiable harm by the production of 
offensive odors or that specific property 
damage was substantially certain to re-
sult from its actions. Chief Justice Gray 
dissented,  arguing  that  liability  for  a 
taking could extend to intentional con-
duct in the daily operation of the sewer 
system.  

The  Leuschners  filed  a  petition 
for review. They argue that the court of 
appeals erred in misplacing the burden 
of proof on them when it reviewed the 
City’s plea to the jurisdiction. They also 
argue that takings liability can extend 
to recurring conduct by the government 
that  damages  property.  Finally,  they 
contend that the intent inquiry should 
include  consideration  of  evidence  that 
the City learned, after initial construc-
tion,  about  the  nuisance  the  City  had 
created  by  continued  operation  of  the 
facility. The Court granted the petition 
for review.

termination the lease splits for each de-
veloped  well,  and  MRC  will  have  a 
lease  for  each  well  so  long  as  it  pro-
duces  in  paying  quantities.  The  wells’ 
acreage is determined by whether each 
wellbore extend horizontally more than 
5,000 feet. MRC contends the lease re-
quires measuring from where the well-
bore enters the formation until it exits, 
while  Point  Energy  argues  it  depends 
on  angles  and  perforation  of  the  well-
bore.  

Finally,  MRC  claims  that  Point 
Energy  and  some  of  its  agents  con-
cealed their connections to one another 
and  induced  the  mineral  owners  to 
breach their lease with MRC. Point En-
ergy responds it had a good-faith belief 
the  contract  was  terminated,  there  is 
no evidence that it knew it was not, and 
their leases are top leases that cannot 
interfere with MRC’s rights.  

MRC  sued  to  settle  these  and 
other  questions.  The  parties  had  sev-
eral competing summary judgment mo-
tions. The trial court granted summary 
judgment  on  most  issues  in  Point  En-
ergy’s  favor  but  certified  an  interlocu-
tory  appeal.  The  court  of  appeals  re-
versed, finding for MRC on issues one 
and three, and decided because the con-
tract did not terminate, it did not have 
jurisdiction  to  answer  question  two. 
The Supreme Court granted review.  
 

 Releases  and  Reliance  Dis-

claimers 

a)  Austin  Trust  Co.  v.  Houren, 
647 S.W.3d 913 (Tex. App.—
Houston  [14th  Dist.]  2021), 
pet.  granted  (June  17,  2022) 
[21-0355] 

There  are  three  primary  issues 
in  this  case.  The  first  is  whether  the 

117 
 

executor  of  an  estate owed  a  fiduciary 
duty to trust beneficiaries. The second 
issue  is  whether  a  decedent’s  estate 
was  required  to,  and  did,  disclose  all 
material facts in connection with a re-
lease  executed  by  beneficiaries  to  the 
decedent’s  marital  trust.  The  third  is-
sue is whether the trial court abused its 
discretion  in  excluding  certain  finan-
cial  documents  from  the  summary 
judgment evidence. 

Bob  Lanier  was  the  surviving 
spouse  of  Elizabeth  Lanier.  Elizabeth 
was also survived by her and Bob’s five 
children.  Upon  Elizabeth’s  death,  her 
will created the Robert C. Lanier Mari-
tal Trust. At that time, Elizabeth’s es-
tate  was  valued  at  approximately  $54 
million,  and  she  placed  most  of  those 
assets  in  the  Marital  Trust.  Bob  was 
the  sole trustee  and beneficiary  of  the 
Marital Trust. Bob married Elyse after 
Elizabeth’s death and was additionally 
survived by Elyse and her two children. 
At the time of Bob’s death, the Marital 
Trust  was  valued  at  approximately 
$5.5 million. In Bob’s will, he directed 
the Marital Trust assets remaining at 
his death to pass to the Bob and Eliza-
beth Lanier Descendants Trust for the 
benefit  of  Elizabeth’s  Children.  Addi-
tionally,  Bob  left  assets  from  his  own 
Estate—separate  from  the  Marital 
Trust—to Elyse and her two children. 
Jay  Houren  served  as  the  inde-
pendent  executor  of  Bob’s  Estate. 
Houren proposed a “Family Settlement 
Agreement” (FSA) to all interested par-
ties.  The  parties  received  disclosures, 
including a general ledger at the center 
of  this  dispute,  which  the  Marital 
Trust’s beneficiaries claim as proof that 
Bob  either  owed  the  Marital  Trust  a 
$37  million  debt  or  breached  a 

fiduciary duty by taking excessive dis-
tributions from the Marital Trust’s in-
come. Despite the ledger’s inclusion in 
the disclosures, all parties executed the 
FSA. The FSA contained a release that 
generally applied to any and all liabil-
ity arising from any and all claims re-
lating  to  Bob’s  Estate  or  the  Marital 
Trust, as well as any claims related to, 
based upon, or made evident in the dis-
closures.  

The funds were distributed from 
the  Marital  Trust  to  the  Descendants 
Trusts,  and  Houren  distributed  Bob’s 
Estate’s assets according to Bob’s will. 
Austin Trust then sent a demand letter 
to Houren seeking repayment of an al-
leged  $37  million  debt  owed  by  Bob’s 
Estate  to  the  Marital  Trust.  Austin 
Trust  based  its  demand  on  the  disclo-
sures.  

Houren filed a declaratory judg-
ment action against Austin Trust seek-
ing  a  declaration  that  the  alleged  $37 
million debt did not exist. Austin Trust 
answered and filed a counterclaim for a 
contrary declaration. Austin Trust also 
added a claim for a breach of fiduciary 
duty against Bob’s Estate. Houren filed 
a  motion  for  partial  summary  judg-
ment on both of Austin Trust’s claims. 
The  trial  court  granted  the  motion. 
Austin Trust appealed. 

The  court  of  appeals  held  that 
the  Marital  Trust  beneficiaries  re-
leased their claims against Houren and 
Bob’s  Estate  when  they  signed  the 
FSA. In its analysis, the court did not 
decide  whether  Bob  and  Houren  owed 
the  beneficiaries  a  fiduciary  duty.  In-
stead, the court applied the Forest Oil 
factors to determine that the FSA was 
enforceable  and  affirmed  the  trial 

118 
 

court’s grant of partial summary judg-
ment.  

In Austin Trust’s briefing before 
the  Supreme  Court,  it  argues  that 
Houren,  as  executor  of  Bob’s  Estate, 
breached a fiduciary duty to the benefi-
ciaries of the Marital Trust. The court 
of appeals failed to conduct a “full dis-
closure”  analysis  as  it  should  have. 
Houren argues the FSA was a full and 
final release and that Houren owed no 
fiduciary  duty  to  the  petitioners.  The 
Court granted the petition for review.  
 

 

 Corporate Governance 
a)  Skeels  v.  Suder,  2021  WL 
(Tex.  App.—Fort 
4785782 
Worth  2021),  pet.  granted 
(Jan. 27, 2023) [21-1014] 
The issue in this case is whether 
a  resolution  by  law  firm  shareholders 
provides the firm with the power to re-
deem shares of a former partner for no 
value.  

While  a  shareholder  at  Fried-
man,  Suder  &  Cooke,  P.C.,  David 
Skeels and other shareholders signed a 
resolution purporting to give the found-
ing shareholders broad corporate pow-
ers.  After  Skeels  left  the  firm,  it  noti-
fied him that it would be redeeming his 
shares  for  zero  dollars  by  the  powers 
authorized  in  the  resolution.  Skeels 
sued,  seeking  a  declaration  that  the 
firm  lacked  the  power  to  redeem  his 
shares for no value. The trial court con-
cluded  that  the  resolution  authorized 
the  firm’s  actions  and  rendered  judg-
ment for the firm.   

After  multiple  rehearings,  the 
court  of  appeals  modified  the  trial 
court’s  judgment  to  delete  awards  of 
fees  and  sanctions  but  otherwise 

affirmed. It concluded that the resolu-
tion was a shareholder agreement that 
granted  the  firm  broad  governing  au-
thority, including the power to redeem 
Skeels’s  shares  on  its  chosen  terms. 
The  court  of  appeals  rejected  Skeels’s 
argument that the firm’s actions must 
comply with a Business Organizations 
Code  provision  regarding  share  re-
demption by professional corporations. 
The court also held that Skeels waived 
his  complaint  that  the  resolution 
lacked consideration was therefore un-
enforceable. 

Skeels  petitioned  the  Supreme 
Court for review. He asserts that he did 
not waive his lack-of-consideration de-
fense  and  that  the  resolution  must 
strictly comply with the share-redemp-
tion requirements in the Code.    

The Court granted Skeels’s peti-

tion. 
 

 Veil-Piercing 
a)  In  re  First  Reserve  Mgmt., 
L.P.,  2022  WL  120010  (Tex. 
App.—Beaumont  2022),  ar-
gument  granted  on  pet.  for 
writ  of  mandamus  (Jan.  27, 
2023) [22-0227] 

The issue in this case is whether 
the  trial  court  should  have  dismissed 
the plaintiffs’ claims against an inves-
tor  in  a  petrochemical  manufacturing 
company under Texas Rule of Civil Pro-
cedure 91a.  

After  explosions  at  a  chemical 
plant in southeast Texas caused wide-
spread damage and injuries, thousands 
of lawsuits were filed and consolidated 
in  an  MDL  court  for  pretrial  proceed-
ings. Defendant–Relator First Reserve 
is  a  private-equity  firm  that  owns  a 
controlling  stake  in  the  plant’s  owner, 

119 
 

TPC Group. TPC lacks its own board of 
directors and is run by the board of an-
other  entity  related  to  First  Reserve. 
Plaintiffs  seek  to  pierce  the  corporate 
veil  and  hold  First  Reserve  liable  for 
damages  caused  by  the  explosion 
through an alter-ego theory.  

First  Reserve  moved  to  dismiss 
Plaintiffs’ claims under Rule 91a, argu-
ing that they fail as a matter of law be-
cause  First  Reserve’s  relationship  to 
TPC  and  its  governing  board  is  con-
sistent with industry standards for pri-
vate-equity 
investment.  The  MDL 
court denied the motion, and the court 
of appeals denied First Reserve’s man-
damus petition. 

The Supreme Court granted ar-
gument  on  First  Reserve’s  mandamus 
petition. 
 

 

 Non-Economic Damages 
a)  Gregory  v.  Chohan,  615 
S.W.3d 277 (Tex. App.—Dal-
las 2020), pet. granted. (Sept. 
2, 2022) [21-0017] 

The  primary  issue  in  this  case 
concerns the proper standard of review 
for  non-economic  damages 
in  tort 
cases.  

Sarah  Gregory  was  driving  a 
tractor  trailer  for  her  employer  New 
Prime  when  the  vehicle  slid  on  an  icy 
road.  She  lost  control  and  jackknifed 
across the highway, starting a string of 
auto  accidents  that  killed  Bhupinder 
Singh Deol. Deol’s family sued Gregory, 
New Prime, and others involved in the 
accident.  All  but  Gregory  and  New 
Prime settled. 

Before  trial,  Gregory  and  New 
Prime  identified  other  drivers  and 
their  employers  as  responsible  third 

parties, but the trial court struck those 
designations.  The 
jury  apportioned 
fifty-five percent of the responsibility to 
Gregory  and  thirty  percent  to  New 
Prime. The jury awarded Deol’s family 
$16,447,272.31  in  economic  and  non-
economic damages.  

Gregory  and  New  Prime  ap-
pealed. The court of appeals, sitting en 
banc,  affirmed.  It  held  that  the  trial 
court did not err by striking Gregory’s 
motion  to  designate  responsible  third 
parties.  It  rejected  New  Prime’s  argu-
ment  that  the  noneconomic  damages 
were  excessive  and were  not  individu-
alized.  

Gregory  and  New  Prime  peti-
tioned  the  Supreme  Court  for  review. 
They  argue  that  the  court  of  appeals 
applied  the  wrong  standard  of  review 
regarding  the  non-economic  damages 
and no objective standard supports the 
non-economic  damages  awarded  here. 
They  also  argue  that  insufficient  evi-
dence  supports  the  mental  anguish 
damages awarded. Finally, they argue 
that  the  trial  court  erred  by  striking 
their  responsible-third-party  designa-
tions.  The  Court  granted  Gregory  and 
New Prime’s petition.  

 

 

 Disability Discrimination 
b)  Tex.  Tech  Univ.  Health  Scis. 
Ctr.–El  Paso  v.  Niehay,  641 
S.W.3d  761  (Tex.  App.—El 
Paso 2022) (per curiam), pet. 
granted  (Jan.  27,  2023)  [22-
0179] 

The  issues  in  this  case  are 
(1) whether morbid obesity qualifies as 
a  disability  under  the  Texas  Commis-
sion  on  Human  Rights  Act  if  the  em-
ployer  does  not  regard  the  obesity  as 

120 
 

caused  by  a  separate  condition  and 
(2) whether the employer waived attor-
ney–client privilege. 

Texas  Tech  University  Health 
Sciences Center–El Paso dismissed Dr. 
Lindsey  Niehay  from  its  medical  resi-
dency  program.  Niehay  sued  for  disa-
bility  discrimination,  contending  that 
Texas Tech dismissed her because it re-
garded  her  as  morbidly  obese.  Texas 
Tech filed a combined plea to the juris-
diction  and  motion  for  summary  judg-
ment, challenging whether Niehay was 
disabled and arguing that she was dis-
missed  for  reasons  other  than  her 
weight.  In  response,  Niehay  offered 
deposition  testimony  from  a  Texas 
Tech  employee  about  communications 
involving  Texas  Tech’s  in-house  coun-
sel that suggested Niehay’s weight was 
a factor in her dismissal. The trial court 
overruled Texas Tech’s objection to this 
testimony  and  denied  Texas  Tech’s 
plea and motion. 

The court of appeals affirmed. It 
held that Niehay asserted a valid disa-
bility-discrimination 
claim  because 
morbid  obesity  may  be  regarded  as  a 
physical  impairment without  evidence 
of an underlying physiological cause of 
the obesity. The court also held that the 
trial court did not abuse its discretion 
in considering the deposition testimony 
because  Texas  Tech  waived  any  privi-
lege  claim  and  that  Niehay  presented 
direct  evidence  of  discriminatory  in-
tent. 

Texas  Tech  petitioned  the  Su-
for  review,  arguing 
preme  Court 
(1) that Niehay did not have a disabil-
ity because it did not regard her morbid 
obesity  as  being  caused  by  a  separate 
condition and (2) that it did not waive

 Whistleblower Actions 
a)  Tex.  Health  and  Human 
Servs.  Comm’n  v.  Pope,  646 
S.W.3d 562 (Tex. App.—Aus-
tin  2020),  pet.  granted  (May 
27, 2022) [20-0999] 

At  issue  in  this  case is  whether 
alleged  reports  made  by  two  former 
managers at the Texas Health and Hu-
man  Services  Commission  qualify  as 
“good-faith reports [of] violation of law 
by [a] employing governmental entity” 
under  the  Whistleblower  Act.  While 
overseeing  HHSC’s  Medical  Transpor-
tation  Program,  under  which  contrac-
tors  provide  rides  to  Texans  for  Medi-
caid-eligible  health  services,  Pope  and 
Pickett complained to law enforcement 
authorities about a third-party contrac-
tor’s failure to follow state parental-ac-
companiment rules, HHSC’s failure to 
collect rebate payments from said con-
tractor, and a lack of documentation to 
support  responses  to  an  on-going  fed-
eral audit.  

After  Pope  and  Pickett  were 
fired, they sued HHSC under the Texas 
Whistleblower  Act.  HHSC  filed  a  plea 
to the jurisdiction and motion for sum-
mary judgment, arguing that that Pope 
and Pickett failed to show they made a 
good faith report of a violation of law by 
a  governmental  entity.  The  trial  court 
denied  HHSC’s  plea  and  motion.  The 
court  of  appeals  affirmed,  concluding 
that  Pope  and  Pickett’s  report  of  a 
third-party  contractor’s  legal  violation 
necessarily  implicated  a  violation  by 
HHSC,  and  that  HHSC’s  “responsibil-
ity” to enforce Medicaid laws may have 
been  violated  when  it  did  not  seek 

121 
 

reimbursement from the contractor.  

In its petition for review, HHSC 
argued that Pope and Pickett reported 
violations  of  law  by  a  third  party,  not 
HHSC,  and  that  the  Whistleblower 
Act’s  good-faith  standard  does  not  ap-
ply when a reporting employee does not 
identify  a  governmental  entity.  Next, 
HHSC argued that no law requires that 
it  seek  rebate  payments  from  contrac-
tors; any law making HHSC “responsi-
ble”  for  enforcing  state  Medicaid  laws 
merely describes the agency’s jurisdic-
tion. Last, HHSC argued that Pickett’s 
emails  concerning  the  response  to  the 
federal audit should not be considered 
independent  reports.  The  Supreme 
Court  granted  HHSC’s  petition  for  re-
view. 
 

 

 Divorce Decrees 
a)  In  the  Interest  of  J.N.,  L.N., 
K.N.,  and  M.N.,  Children 
(Tex. 
2022  WL  1211200 
App.—Dallas 
pet. 
2022), 
granted  (Feb.  24,  2023)  [22-
0419] 

The issue in this case is whether 
harmless  error  review  should  apply 
when a trial court fails to comply with 
a statutory requirement to interview a 
child during a divorce proceeding.  

Father  filed  for  divorce  from 
Mother and  parties proceeded to trial. 
The  Family  Code  provides  that  in  a 
bench  trial,  at  the  request  of  a  party, 
the court “shall interview” a child over 
the  age  of  twelve  to  determine  the 
child’s  wishes  regarding  primary  resi-
dence. Mother initially requested a jury 
trial,  but  she  withdrew  her  request in 
order to have the trial court interview 
her  oldest  daughter,  M.N.,  who  was 

 Termination  of  Parental 

Rights 

a)  In  re  A.A., G.A.,  &  K.A.,  635 
S.W.3d  430  (Tex.  App.—Am-
arillo  Oct.  5,  2021),  pet. 
granted 
(May  27,  2022) 
[21-0998] 

Mother’s  parental  rights  were 
terminated for noncompliance with her 
family-services plan.  

Three of Mother’s children were 
removed  from  their  Father’s  care  and 
placed  in  a  foster  home  due  to  his  ne-
glect  and  abuse.  At  that  time,  Mother 
was living in New Mexico, and Father 
had  primary  custody  of  the  children. 
The Department of Family and Protec-
tive  Services  filed  a  petition  to  termi-
nate  parental  rights  of  both  Mother 
and Father. The Department provided 
Mother with a plan she was required to 
follow to secure reunification with her 
children.  The  trial  court  found  that 
Mother failed to comply with the plan 
and that termination of parental rights 
was in the children’s best interests. Be-
cause of this, the trial court terminated 
Mother’s parental rights under Section 
161.001(b)(1)(O)  of  the  Texas  Family 
Code,  which  allows  for  termination  if 
the  parent  failed  to  comply  with  the 
provisions  of  a  court  order  specifically 
establishing  the  actions  necessary  for 
the  parent  to  obtain  the  return  of  the 
child who has been in the permanent or 
temporary  managing  conservatorship 
of  the  Department  for  not  less  than 
nine  months  as  a  result  of  the  child’s 
removal from the parent for the abuse 
or neglect of the child.  

The  court  of  appeals  affirmed, 
holding  that  there  was  evidence  that 
supported the trial court’s finding that 
the  children  were  removed  from  the 

court  denied 
trial 
thirteen.  The 
Mother’s  request  for  an  interview  and 
granted  Father  the  exclusive  right  to 
decide  their  children’s  primary  resi-
dence. Mother appealed.  

The court of appeals affirmed. It 
held that the trial court erred by failing 
to  conduct  the  interview  but  that  the 
error  was  harmless.  The  Family  Code 
provides  that  interviewing  the  child 
“does not diminish the discretion of the 
trial  court  in  determining  the  best  in-
terests of the child.” Accordingly, it rea-
soned,  even  if  M.N.  had  expressed  a 
preference to live with Mother, the trial 
court would not have been obligated to 
make a different conservatorship deci-
sion.  The  court  of  appeals  concluded 
that the trial court’s grant of the exclu-
sive  right  to  Father  was  supported  by 
the  evidence  and  that  M.N.’s  prefer-
ence  to  live  with  Mother  would  not 
have constituted a sufficient reason to 
separate her from her siblings.   

Mother  petitioned  for  review. 
She argues that applying harm analy-
sis to the interview requirement is in-
appropriate  because  the  statute  is 
mandatory,  it  is  impossible  to  deter-
mine harm, Mother gave up her consti-
tutional right to a jury trial in reliance 
on the interview, and applying a harm 
analysis would undermine the statute’s 
purpose  of  providing  children  with  a 
voice  in  court  proceedings  that  affect 
their lives. 

The  Court  granted  the  petition 

for review.

home due to abuse or neglect and sup-
ported  a  finding  that  termination  was 
in the children’s best interest.  

Mother’s  petition  for  review  ar-
gues  that  the  court  of  appeals  inter-
preted  Section 161.001(b)(1)(O)  in  an 
improperly expansive manner, making 
Mother  subject  to  termination  despite 
the  absence  of  any  allegation  or  suffi-
cient evidence that she—as opposed to 
Father—abused  or  neglected  the  chil-
dren.  Mother  also  argues  that  Texas 
courts lack jurisdiction under the Uni-
form  Child  Custody  Jurisdiction  and 
Enforcement  Act  because  a  New  Mex-
ico  court  determined  Mother’s  initial 
custody  determination  under  the  di-
vorce  decree,  vesting  the  court  with 
continuing 
jurisdiction.  The  Court 
granted the petition for review. 
 

b)  In  re  J.S.,  2022  WL  620709 
(Tex.  App.—Dallas  2022), 
pet.  granted  (Sept.  30,  2022) 
[22- 0420]  

The issue in this case is whether 
the trial court complied with the statu-
tory requirements for extending its ju-
risdiction  over  a  suit  to  terminate  pa-
rental  rights  initiated  by  the  Depart-
ment  of  Family  and  Protective  Ser-
vices. The Family Code provides for au-
tomatic  dismissal  of  such  a  suit  if  the 
trial on the merits has not commenced 
within  a  year  of  the  case’s  initiation, 
but the Code also allows the trial court 
to  extend  its  jurisdiction  over  the  suit 
for an additional six months if the court 
“extraordinary  circum-
finds 
stances”  necessitate  it  doing  so  and 
that the extension would be “in the best 
interest of the child.”  

that 

On the statutory dismissal date, 
Mother appeared for  a bench trial but 

123 
 

requested  a  jury  trial.  At  the  Depart-
ment’s  request,  the  court  made  the 
best-interest  finding  required  by  the 
Family  Code  orally  on  the  record  and 
then  set  a  jury  trial  for  a  later  date. 
About  six  weeks  after  the  initial  dis-
missal  date,  the  court  issued  an  order 
reciting both the extraordinary-circum-
stances  and  best-interest  findings  re-
quired by the Code. The court eventu-
ally  issued  a  judgment  terminating 
Mother’s  parental  rights.  Mother  ap-
pealed,  challenging  the  sufficiency  of 
the evidence to support the judgment.  
The  court  of  appeals  raised  the 
issue  of  the  trial  court’s  compliance 
with the statutory requirements for ex-
tending  jurisdiction  on  its  own.  The 
court held that the trial court’s attempt 
to  extend  its  jurisdiction  was  ineffec-
tive  because  the  court  made  only  the 
best-interest  finding  before  the  initial 
dismissal  date,  and  the  court’s  order 
making  both  findings  came  too  late. 
The court vacated the trial court’s judg-
ment and dismissed the case for lack of 
subject-matter jurisdiction.  

After  initially  denying  the  De-
partment’s petition for review, the Su-
preme Court granted the Department’s 
motion  for  rehearing  and  its  petition

0056] 

The  primary  issues  in  these 
cases are whether the Electric Reliabil-
ity Council of Texas (ERCOT) is a “gov-
ernmental unit” entitled to an interloc-
utory appeal from the denial of a plea 
to the jurisdiction and whether ERCOT 
has governmental immunity from suit.  
ERCOT  is  the  system  adminis-
trator for Texas’s power grid. CPS En-
ergy  is  a  municipally  owned  utility. 
CPS sued ERCOT for its actions during 
the  winter  storm  of  February  2021. 
CPS  claimed  that  ERCOT  improperly 
kept energy prices raised, resulting in 
overcharges  to  energy-market  partici-
pants  like  CPS  and  that  ERCOT  un-
lawfully  adjusted  CPS’s  account  to 
make  up  for  other  participants’  de-
faults. ERCOT filed a plea to the juris-
diction arguing that the Public Utility 
Council  of  Texas  (PUC)  had  exclusive 
jurisdiction  over  CPS’s  claims  and  as-
serting  governmental  immunity.  The 
trial court denied the plea. 

ERCOT  appealed  under  the  in-
terlocutory-appeal  statute  permitting 
“governmental unit” from taking an in-
terlocutory  appeal  from  a  denial  of  a 
plea  to  the  jurisdiction.  It  also  filed  a 
mandamus arguing that it enjoyed gov-
ernmental  immunity.  The  court  of  ap-
that  ERCOT  was  a

The primary issue in this case is 
whether the Electric  Reliability Coun-
cil  of  Texas  (ERCOT)  enjoys  govern-
mental immunity.  

ERCOT  is  the  system  adminis-
trator  for  Texas’s  power  grid.  It  pub-
lishes reports on its predictions for the 
state’s capacity and demand for energy. 
Panda  relied  on  those  reports  when  it 
decided to construct new power plants. 
When ERCOT later revised its predic-
tions to indicate an excess of energy in-
stead  of  a  shortfall,  Panda  sued  for 
fraud,  negligent  misrepresentations, 
and breach of fiduciary duty. 

ERCOT filed a plea to the juris-
diction arguing that the Public Utility 
Council  of  Texas  (PUC)  had  exclusive 
jurisdiction  over  Panda’s  claims  and 
asserting governmental immunity. The 
trial court denied the plea. ERCOT ap-
pealed and filed a mandamus petition. 
The  court  of  appeals  reversed.  Panda 
filed  a  mandamus  petition  in  the  Su-
preme Court, and ERCOT filed a condi-
tional  petition  for  review.  Meanwhile, 
Panda also filed another petition for re-
view  in  the  court  of  appeals,  which 
abated  pending  the  Supreme  Court’s 
decision.  But  because  of  that  appeal, 
the Supreme Court dismissed both pe-
titions before it as procedurally moot.  
The  court  of  appeals  reinstated 
Panda’s appeal and held, in an en banc 
opinion, that ERCOT is not entitled to 
governmental  immunity  and  that  the 
PUC  does  not  have  exclusive  jurisdic-
tion over Panda’s claims. 

ERCOT again petitioned the Su-
preme  Court  for  review.  The  Court 
granted EROT’s petition.

Improvement  District  Number 3 
statutorily  empowered  to  “acquire  by

water resources within its jurisdiction. 
The Improvement District sought to ex-
tend  a  water  pipeline  under  a  canal 
that the Hidalgo County Water Irriga-
tion  District Number  1  owns. The Im-
provement  District  and  the  Irrigation 
District could not agree to terms for an 
easement.  The  Improvement  District 
then filed this condemnation suit. The 
Irrigation  District  responded  with  a 
plea to the jurisdiction, claiming that it 
is immune from suit. 

entities 

The trial court granted the Irri-
gation District’s plea, and the court of 
appeals affirmed. The court of appeals 
pointed to caselaw stating that govern-
mental 
immunity 
against  all  suits  for  land.  The  court 
then  concluded  that  by  empowering 
water districts to condemn “any land,” 
the Legislature had not unambiguously 
waived  the  immunity  possessed  by  a 
governmental condemnee.  

enjoy 

The  Improvement  District  peti-
tioned for review, arguing that the Su-
preme  Court  historically  has  not  ap-
plied  immunity  in  intragovernmental 
condemnation  cases  and  that  to  apply 
it  in  this  context  would  not  serve  im-
munity’s underlying purposes. The Im-
provement District argues in the alter-
native  that  even  if  immunity  would 
otherwise  apply, 
the  Legislature 
waived it in the Water Code. The Court 
granted review. 

       

governmental  unit  that  could  take  an 
interlocutory appeal under the statute. 
It  therefore  dismissed  ERCOT’s  man-
damus and, in the appeal, reversed the 
trial court’s denial of ERCOT’s plea to 
the jurisdiction. The court held that the 
PUC  has  exclusive  jurisdiction  over 
CPS’s  claims.  And  because  CPS  had 
failed  to  exhaust  its  administrative 
remedies, the court of appeals rendered 
judgment dismissing CPS’s claims. 

CPS  petitioned  the  Supreme 
Court  for  review,  and  ERCOT  filed  a 
mandamus petition. In its mandamus, 
ERCOT maintains that it is entitled to 
governmental immunity. In its petition 
for review, CPS argues that ERCOT is 
not a governmental unit that can take 
an  interlocutory  appeal  and  that  the 
PUC  does  not  have  exclusive  jurisdic-
tion  over  its  claims.  The  Supreme 
Court granted CPS’s petition for review 
and  granted  argument  on  ERCOT’s 
mandamus petition.

equal governmental entity’s exercise of 
its  eminent  domain  authority.  If  im-
munity exists, an additional question is 
whether  the  Legislature  has  waived 
that immunity by granting to the con-

and 

League  City 

At  issue  in  this  breach-of-con-
tract case is whether League City’s en-
tering  into  an  agreement  with  Jimmy 
Changas, Inc., for the construction of a 
restaurant  was  a  governmental  ac-
tion—such  that  the  City  is  immune 
from suit—or a proprietary action. 
Jimmy 
 
Changas  entered  into  an  agreement 
under  Chapter  380  of  the  Texas  Local 
Government Code, under which Jimmy 
Changas would build a restaurant and 
the  City  would  reimburse  Jimmy 
Changas 
its  water  and 
wastewater  fees,  all  fees  associated 
with  plat  approval  and  building  per-
mits,  and  a  percentage  of  Jimmy 
Changas’  sales-tax  revenue.  Jimmy 
Changas alleged that the City failed to 
reimburse it for any of these expenses, 
and it sued the City for breach of con-
tract. 

for  all 

The City filed a plea to the juris-
diction,  arguing  that  it  performed  a 
governmental  function  by  making  the 
agreement  with  Jimmy  Changas,  and 
that  it  therefore  is  immune  from  suit. 
It further argued that Jimmy Changas 
could  not  demonstrate  that  the  City’s 
governmental 
immunity  had  been 
waived  under  the  Local  Government 
Code.  Jimmy  Changas  contends  that 
the City’s entering into the agreement 
does not qualify as a governmental ac-
tion  under  the  Texas  Tort  Claims  Act 
and  that  its  suit  for  damages  may 
therefore  proceed.  The  trial  court

denied the City’s plea, and the court of 
appeals  affirmed  the  trial  court’s  de-
nial.  The  Supreme  Court  granted  re-
view.

granted  (Feb.  24,  2023)  [22-

This  case  concerns  the  City  of 
Austin’s  immunity  from  premises-de-
fect  claims  arising  from  an  accident 
that  occurred  on  a  City-owned  side-
walk. The City granted Guero’s restau-
rant a permit to use a portion of side-
walk  for  outdoor  restaurant  seating. 
Guero’s  and  the  City also  executed  an 
agreement  that  required  Guero’s  to 
comply  with  maintenance  require-
ments imposed by the City.  

its  obligations  under 

Quinlan  was  injured  when  she 
fell  from  an  elevated  edge  of  the  side-
walk to the street below. She sued, al-
leging  that  the  City  negligently  per-
formed 
the 
maintenance  agreement,  among  other 
claims. The trial court denied the City’s 
plea to the jurisdiction. A split panel of 
the  court  of  appeals  affirmed  with  re-
spect  to  the  maintenance-agreement 
claims.  The  majority  concluded  that 
the  maintenance  agreement  created  a 
fact  issue  on  the  jurisdictional  fact  of 
the City’s control of the premises, pre-
cluding dismissal of those claims. 

The Supreme Court granted the 
City’s petition for review. The City ar-
gues that its immunity from suit is not 
waived  under  the  Tort  Claims  Act  be-
cause it retained discretion about how 
or whether to enforce the maintenance 
agreement.  The  City  also  challenges 

trial  court  denied  all  three  of  Gulf 
Coast’s motions and signed a judgment 
against Gulf Coast for the full amount 
of the verdict. 

Gulf  Coast  appealed,  challeng-
ing, among other things, the judgment 
in excess of the $100,000 statutory cap. 
The court of appeals affirmed the trial 
court’s  judgment.  The  appellate  panel 
reasoned  the  final  judgment  was  per-
missible  because  “Gulf  Coast  failed  to 
conclusively  establish  its  status  as  a 
unit  of  local  government  and  failed  to 
obtain an affirmative finding from the 
jury  on  that  issue.”  Gulf  Coast  moved 
for  rehearing  and  reconsideration  en 
banc, asking the court of appeals to cor-
rect  its  error  in  failing  to  apply  the 
$100,000  cap  on  liability,  which  the 
court denied.  

The  Texas  Tort  Claims  Act 
waives  immunity  from  suit  and  liabil-
ity  for  a  “governmental  unit.”  The 
TTCA  imposes  damages  caps  for  gov-
ernmental  units  whose  immunity  has 
been  waived  under  the  Act.  The  Act 
contains  different  damages  caps,  and 
determining  which  cap  applies  hinges 
on  the  category  into  which  a  govern-
mental  unit  fits.  The  four  categories 
are:  (1)  “the  state  government”;  (2)  a 
(3) a  non-municipal 
“municipality”; 
“unit  of  local  government”;  and  (4)  an 
“emergency 
organization.” 
State  governments  and  municipalities 
are  subject  to  a  higher  damages  cap, 
while  units  of  local  government  and 
emergency  service  organizations  are 
subject to the lower cap.

Gulf  Coast  argues  that  the  de-
termination  of  whether  an  entity  con-
stitutes a “unit of local government” for 
TTCA  damages  caps  purposes  is  a 
question  of  law  for  courts  to  decide.

The  issues  in  this  case  are 
whether a party’s characterization as a 
“unit of local government” as classified 
by the Texas Tort Claims Act (TTCA) is 
a  question  of  law  or  fact,  and  further, 
whether  the  TTCA’s  damages  caps 
limit the Act’s waiver of immunity from 
suit. 

Petitioner, The Gulf Coast Cen-
ter, provides mental health services to 
patients  in  Galveston  and  Brazoria 
Counties.  Respondent,  Daniel  Curry, 
Jr., was hit by a bus while walking in a 
pedestrian crosswalk in Texas City. He 
sued  Gulf  Coast,  the  bus’s  owner  and 
operator,  for  the  injuries  he  allegedly 
sustained as a result of the accident. At 
the trial court, Curry alleged that Gulf 
Coast is a “governmental unit” and that 
his  claims  were  within  the  limited 
waiver  of  immunity  under  Title  5, 
Chapter 101 of the Texas Civil Practice 
& Remedies Code. Gulf Coast affirma-
tively  pleaded  its  status  as  a  govern-
mental  unit,  and  that  its  liability  is 
limited by the TTCA. A jury eventually 
found Gulf Coast 100 percent responsi-
ble  for  Curry’s  injuries  and  awarded 
Curry  $216,000  in  damages.  Curry 
moved for entry of judgment on the full 
amount of the award with prejudgment 
interest.  Gulf  Coast  filed  a  motion  for 
new trial, a motion to correct and mod-
ify the judgment, and a motion for judg-
ment notwithstanding the verdict. The 

127 
 

Gulf  Coast  reasons  that  this  determi-
nation  involves  a  straightforward  ap-
plication  of  unambiguous  statutes. 
Likewise, Gulf Coast contends that the 
TTCA’s damages caps waive immunity 
from suit only to the extent of the lia-
bility that the TTCA creates. Curry, on 
the  other  hand,  argues  that  a  party’s 
TTCA  categorization  is  a  question  of 
fact, and Gulf Coast’s failure to seek a 
jury  finding  on  the  issue  renders  Gulf 
Coast  unable  to  conclusively  establish 
its  status  as a  “community  center”  for 
the  first  time  on  appeal.  Additionally, 
Curry  argues  that  Gulf  Coast’s  pur-
ported immunity from liability defense 
is  not  jurisdictional  but  instead  must 
be raised as an affirmative defense ra-
ther  than  by  jurisdictional  plea.  The 
Court granted Gulf Coast’s petition for 
review.

This  case  results  from  a  single-
vehicle accident after Texas A&M Uni-
versity changed the design of an inter-
section  and  presents  the  issues  of 
(1) the  scope  of  an  exception  to  the 
waiver  of  governmental  immunity  un-
der the Texas Tort Claims Act for a gov-
ernmental unit’s exercise of discretion-
ary powers, (2) when an off-road defect 
constitutes  a  special  defect  under  the 
act,  and  (3) whether a  plaintiff  should 
have  an  opportunity  to  replead  when 
the defendant’s plea to the jurisdiction 
challenges only the failure to plead suf-
ficient  facts  and  not  the  existence  of 
facts establishing jurisdiction.  

128 
 

Kristopher Fraley sued the Uni-
 
versity  for  claims  of  premises  defect, 
special  defect,  and  negligent  imple-
mentation,  asserting  that  after  the 
University converted a four-way inter-
section to a T-intersection by changing 
a portion of an existing road to a drain-
age ditch without warning or safety de-
vices. The University filed a plea to the 
jurisdiction claiming governmental im-
munity, which the trial court denied.  

The  court  of  appeals  reversed, 
concluding that (1) the University’s de-
cisions  to  eliminate  a  roadway  and  to 
not  install  new  traffic  safety  devices 
are  discretionary  design  decisions, 
(2) the  redesign  of  the  intersection  is 
not  within  the  same  class  as  an  ob-
struction or excavation and therefore is 
not  a  special  defect  under  the  Texas 
Tort Claims Act, and (3) Fraley did not 
plead  any  allegations  of  a  misuse  of 
tangible personal property. Noting that 
an amended petition could not cure the 
jurisdictional  defects,  the  court  of  ap-
peals dismissed Fraley’s claims rather 
than provide an opportunity to replead.   
 
Fraley  petitioned  the  Supreme 
Court  for  review,  arguing  that  he 
pleaded  facts  sufficient  to  waive  the 
University’s government immunity un-
der the act and that even if not, he was 
entitled to the opportunity to replead to 
cure  the 
jurisdictional  defect.  The 
Court  granted  Fraley’s  petition  for  re-
view.

ville,  647  S.W.3d  710  (Tex. 
App.—Corpus  Christi–Edin-
burg  2020),  pet.  granted 
(June 17, 2022) [20-0975] 
The  issue  in  this  case  concerns 
the  use  of  motor-driven  equipment, 

trial  court  lacked  jurisdiction.  The 
court of appeals reversed, finding that 
the City’s actions constituted nonuse of 
property that did not invoke the waiver 
of immunity and remanded to the trial 
court  with  instructions  to  dismiss  the 
homeowner’s  suit.  The  Homeowners 
appealed.  

The  Texas  Tort  Claims  Act 
waives  immunity  from  suit  and  liabil-
ity for a “governmental unit.” However, 
a  governmental  unit  is  liable  if  “prop-
erty  damage  is  proximately  caused  by 
the wrongful act or omission or the neg-
ligence  of  an  employee  acting  within 
his scope of employment” if the damage 
“arises from the operation of use” of mo-
tor-driven equipment. Homeowners ar-
gue  that  concerning  the  use  of  mo-
tor-driven  equipment,  the  court  of  ap-
peals  misapplied  the  nexus  causation 
standard. They further argue that the 
court  of  appeals  failed  to  look  at  their 
intent  and  by  complaining  about  the 
North Laredo Gate being open, their in-
tent was to complain about the gate be-
ing  closed.  The  City  argues  that  the 
Homeowners do not complain about the 
use of the gate, but instead allege that 
the City’s failure to act was negligent. 
The  Court  granted  the  homeowner’s 
petition for review.  

                   

whether negligent use or operation of a 
floodgate  caused  flooding  damage  to 
homeowners’ properties. 

Petitioner  Homeowners  experi-
enced flooding after heavy rainfall. The 
Homeowners  alleged that  their  homes 
were  flooded  from  the  nearby  resaca 
and that the flooding was caused by the 
City  of  Brownsville’s  negligent  opera-
tion  of  its  stormwater  system.  The 
stormwater system contains a series of 
drainage  ditches,  resacas,  and  other 
bodies of water, which are controlled by 
multiple  motor-driven  gates  and 
pumps.  Specifically,  the  Homeowners 
allege that the misuse of the North La-
redo Gate caused excessive stormwater 
to accumulate in the nearby resaca. On 
the  day  of  the  storm,  four  of  the  five 
gates were initially open, including the 
North  Laredo  Gate.  That  afternoon,  a 
city employee charged with stormwater 
management noted that the resaca had 
normal  waterflow.  An  hour  later,  the 
employee  observed  abnormal  negative 
waterflow moving from downstream to 
upstream and closed the North Laredo 
Gate.  Shortly  after  placing  pumps  at 
other downstream flood gates, the em-
ployee  returned  to  the  North  Laredo 
Gate where he observed knee-deep wa-
ter over the nearby road and continued 
negative  water  flow.  This  is  when  the 
homes flooded.  

The  Homeowners  sued  the  City 
of  Brownsville,  claiming  the  City  and 
its employees negligently operated mo-
tor-driven equipment by untimely acti-
vation.  Following  a  hearing,  the  trial 
court denied the City’s plea to the juris-
diction. The City filed an interlocutory 
appeal,  asserting  that  its  immunity 
from suit was not waived by the Texas 
Torts  Claims  Act,  and  therefore,  the

granted  (Jan.  27,  2023)  [22-
0124]  

2021), 

The primary issue in these cases 
is  whether  an  executive  order  barring 
local  mask  mandates  falls  within  the 
scope of authority granted to the Gov-
ernor under the Texas Disaster Act.  

The Texas Disaster Act empow-
ers  the  Governor  to  declare  a  state  of 
disaster and to issue responsive execu-
tive orders that have the force and ef-
fect of law. During the COVID-19 pan-
demic, several local governmental enti-
ties, including the City of San Antonio, 
Bexar County, Dallas County, and Har-
ris  County,  enacted  mask  mandates. 
Citing his authority under the Disaster 
Act, Governor Abbott issued Executive 
Order  GA-38  in  response.  GA-38  pro-
hibits  cities,  counties,  and  other  local 
governmental  entities  from  issuing 
mask mandates. The order states that 
it  supersedes  any  conflicting  local  re-
quirements and suspends any statutes 
on which local officials might rely to is-
sue contradictory orders.  

In three separate lawsuits, local 
governmental entities and officers sued 
Governor  Abbott,  the  State  of  Texas, 
and Attorney General Paxton, either in 
separately.  Each 
combination 

or 

130 
 

sought a declaration that GA-38’s pro-
hibition against mask mandates is un-
authorized  and  an  injunction  barring 
its  enforcement.  San  Antonio  and 
Bexar  County  alternatively  sought  a 
declaration  that  the  Disaster  Act  vio-
lates  the  Texas  Constitution.  In  each 
case,  the  trial  court  granted  a  tempo-
rary  injunction  prohibiting  enforce-
ment  of  GA-38.  The  courts  of  appeals 
affirmed,  concluding  the  local  govern-
mental entities demonstrated a proba-
ble right to relief because GA-38 went 
beyond  the  Governor’s  delegated  au-
thority under the Disaster Act. 

Governor  Abbott,  the  State  of 
Texas,  and  Attorney  General  Paxton 
petitioned  the  Supreme  Court  for  re-
view. They argue that GA-38 is author-
ized by the Disaster Act and preempts 
inconsistent local orders. They also ar-
gue that the trial courts lacked jurisdic-
tion to issue the temporary injunctions 
and  that  the  courts  of  appeals  did  not 
properly balance the equities. 

The Court granted the petitions 

for review.

In Hartzell, S.O. received a PhD

honesty in connection with her doctoral

lated  its  academic  standards,  UT  in-
formed  S.O.  it  intended  to  revoke  her 
PhD.  S.O.  filed  this  suit,  seeking  de-
claratory  relief  that  UT  could  not  re-
voke her degree. UT filed a plea to the 
jurisdiction,  asserting  sovereign  im-
munity  and  urging  that  S.O.’s  claims 
were not yet ripe because it has not re-
voked  S.O.’s  degree.  In  response,  S.O. 
moved  for  summary  judgment.  The 
trial court denied UT’s plea but granted 
S.O.’s  motion  for  summary  judgment, 
concluding  that  UT  lacks  authority  to 
revoke S.O.’s degree and thus acted ul-
tra  vires  in  attempting  to  do  so.  The 
court of appeals affirmed. 

In Trauth, K.E. graduated from 
Texas State University with her PhD in 
2011.  K.E.’s  former  faculty  advisor 
later raised concerns about K.E.’s uni-
versity  data  collection  related  to  her 
dissertation.  After  an  administrative 
investigation,  Texas  State  found  that 
K.E.  engaged  in  academic  misconduct 
and  revoked  her  PhD.  K.E.  filed  suit, 
seeking  declaratory  and  injunctive  re-
lief to restore her PhD. 
 
In  the  trial  court,  Texas  State 
filed  a  plea  to  the  jurisdiction,  assert-
ing sovereign immunity because Texas 
State had the authority to revoke K.E.’s 
degree and arguing that the relief she 
sought  was  retrospective,  and  thus 
barred  by  sovereign  immunity.  The 
trial  court  denied  the  plea,  and  Texas 
State appealed. The court of appeals af-
firmed. 
 
Both universities petitioned this 
court,  arguing  that  public  universities 
have  the  authority  to  revoke  degrees. 
UT  also  argues  that  S.O.’s  claims  are 

131 
 

not  ripe,  and  Texas  State  urges  that 
K.E.’s  remedy  is  retrospective  and 
barred by sovereign immunity. The Su-
preme  Court  has  granted  review  and 
consolidated these cases for argument.  
 

 

 Policies/Coverage 
a)  Nat’l  Union  Fire  Ins.  Co.  of 
Pittsburgh, Pa. v. Exxon Mo-
bil  Corp.,  658  S.W.3d  305 
(Tex.  App.—Houston 
[1st 
Dist.]  2021),  pet.  granted 
 
(Jan. 27, 2023) [21-0936] 
The issue in this case is whether 
Exxon  Mobil  is  considered  an  “addi-
tional insured” under National Union’s 
umbrella  policy  or  Starr  Indemnity  & 
Liability Insurance’s bumbershoot pol-
icy.   

This  case  arises  out  of  a  work-
place accident where two contract em-
ployees were severely burned by a dis-
charge of hot water. Exxon settled with 
the employees for a little over $24 mil-
lion.  Some  of  the  settlement  was  cov-
ered by general-liability insurance pol-
icies  obtained  under  a  service  agree-
ment  between  Exxon  and  the  contrac-
tor,  Savage  Refinery  Service.  Exxon 
paid the rest out of pocket. The service 
agreement required Savage to obtain at 
least $2 million in commercial general 
liability insurance and to name Exxon 
as an “additional insured.” As a result, 
Savage obtained four different policies: 
(1) a $25 million bumbershoot commer-
cial general liability policy from Starr, 
(2) a $25 million umbrella commercial 
general  liability  policy  from  National 
Union, (3) a $4.5 million primary com-
mercial  general  liability  policy  from 
National  Union,  and  (4)  a  $1  million 
marine general liability/or AEL master 

liability  from  National  Union/or  AIG 
Europe Limited. After the accident, the 
smaller policies paid out, but the larger 
policies did not.  

Exxon  brought  breach  of  con-
tract claims against Starr and National 
Union  for  their  failure  to  recognize 
Exxon  as  an  “additional  insured”  on 
these  larger  policies.  Exxon,  National 
Union,  and  Starr  filed  competing  mo-
tions for summary judgment. The trial 
court 
(1)  granted  Starr’s  motion 
against National Union and Exxon and 
(2) granted Exxon’s motion against Na-
tional  Union,  holding  National  Union 
liable to Exxon for over $20 million un-
der  the  umbrella  policy.  National  Un-
ion and Exxon both appealed.   

The  court  of  appeals  reversed 
and  rendered  in  part  and  affirmed  in 
part.  It  held  that  the  trial  court  erred 
in granting Exxon’s motion against Na-
tional Union because Exxon’s status as 
an  “additional  insured”  only  extended 
to  primary  coverage,  not  to  the  um-
brella  policy.  The  court  also  affirmed 
the  trial  court’s  decision  in  favor  of 
Starr, reasoning that because the bum-
bershoot  policy  is  an  umbrella  policy, 
Exxon had no contractual right to cov-
erage.      

Exxon filed a petition for review 
in  the  Supreme  Court  arguing  that  it 
should be considered an “additional in-
sured” under both the National Union 
and Starr policies. Exxon reasons that 
under  incorporation-by-reference  prin-
ciples, a document may be incorporated 
for the limited purpose of ascertaining 
who  is  insured  or  what  risks  are  cov-
ered.  Thus,  Exxon  argues,  the  docu-
ments  here  evidence  that  the  primary 
policies intended to extend coverage to 
include Exxon as an additional insured 

132 
 

under the umbrella policies. The Court 
granted the petition for review. 

 
 Rescission of Policy 
a)  Arce v. Am. Nat’l Ins. Co., 633 
S.W.3d  228  (Tex.  App.—Am-
arillo  2021),  pet.  granted 
(Nov. 18, 2022) [21-0843] 
The primary issue in this case is 
whether an insurer’s ability to rescind 
a life insurance policy based on an ap-
plicant’s  material  misrepresentation 
requires proof of the applicant’s intent 
to deceive.  

Sergio  Arce  applied  for  life  in-
surance  from  American  National  In-
surance Company. He did not disclose 
on his application that he had been di-
agnosed with hepatitis C and suffered 
from related health problems. Thirteen 
days  after  the  policy  was  issued,  he 
died in a car accident. His mother, Ber-
tha, made a claim for benefits. Ameri-
can National denied the claim after dis-
covering  that  Sergio  had  misrepre-
sented his medical history.  

Bertha sued American National 
for breach of contract and violations of 
the  Texas  Insurance  Code.  The  trial 
court  granted  summary  judgment  for 
American National, rescinding the pol-
icy and dismissing Bertha’s claims. The 
court  of  appeals  reversed,  concluding 
that a genuine issue of material fact ex-
ists  as  to  whether  Sergio  intended  to 
deceive  American  National  on  his  in-
surance application. 

American  National  petitioned 
the Supreme Court for review, arguing 
that the common law intent-to-deceive 
element  for  rescission  claims  conflicts 
with  the  recodified  Insurance  Code’s 
unambiguous  text,  which  does  not  re-
quire  an  intent  to  deceive  except  for 

 Subject Matter Jurisdiction  
a)  Perez  v.  Ditech  Servicing, 
LLC, 2021 WL 5365103 (Tex. 
App.—Corpus  Christi–Edin-
burg 2021), pet. granted (Oct. 
21, 2022) [21-1109]  

At issue in this case is whether a 
statutory county court exercising juris-
diction  pursuant  to  an  independent, 
county-specific statute is subject to the 
same jurisdictional limitations as if the 
court  were  exercising  its  concurrent 
constitutional  county  court  jurisdic-
tion.  

Perez purchased a house subject 
to a deed of trust held by Bank of Amer-
ica, Ditech’s predecessor in interest. Af-
ter  Bank  of  America  initiated  foreclo-
sure  proceedings,  Perez  filed  suit  in  a 
statutory county court. Perez asserted 
that the bank waived its right to fore-
close  on  the  property,  and  the  bank 
counterclaimed for judicial foreclosure. 
During the pendency of the case, Bank 
of  America  assigned  its  rights  under 
the deed of trust to Ditech.  

The county court rendered judg-
ment  in  favor  of  Perez.  Ditech  ap-
pealed,  and  the  court  of  appeals  re-
versed  and  remanded.  On  remand, 
Ditech  moved  for  summary  judgment 
on its judicial foreclosure counterclaim, 
and Perez argued that statutory county 
courts  lack  subject-matter  jurisdiction 
over actions requiring the resolution of 
issues of title to real property. The stat-
utory  county  court  rejected  Perez’s 
challenge 
jurisdiction  and 
granted  Ditech’s  motion  for  summary 
judgment. Perez appealed, challenging 
only  the  statutory  county  court’s  sub-
ject-matter jurisdiction.

The court of appeals vacated and 
dismissed,  holding  that  the  statutory 

policies in place longer than two years. 
American National asserts that requir-
ing  an  intent  to  deceive  for  all  rescis-
sion claims would eliminate that statu-
tory  distinction.  The  Court  granted 
American  National’s  petition  for  re-
view. 
 

 

 Personal Jurisdiction  
a)  LG  Chem  Am.,  Inc.  v.  Mor-
gan, 2020 WL 7349483 (Tex. 
App.—Houston 
[1st  Dist.] 
2020),  pet.  granted  (Feb.  24, 
2023) [21-0994]  

This  appeal  addresses  personal 
jurisdiction  over  a  foreign  manufac-
turer and its U.S. subsidiary.  

Tommy  Morgan  alleges  that  he 
suffered  severe  burns  and  other  inju-
ries  when  the  lithium-ion  battery  in-
side  of  an  e-cigarette  exploded  in  his 
pocket.  Morgan  brought  products-lia-
bility  claims  against  several  defend-
ants, including the South Korean man-
ufacturer of the battery, LG Chem, and 
its U.S. distributor, LG Chem America. 
LG Chem and LG Chem America each 
filed  special  appearances,  which  the 
trial  court  denied  following  a  hearing. 
The court of appeals affirmed.  

LG Chem  and  LG  Chem  America 
filed separate petitions for review, each 
arguing  that  it  lacks  the  kind  of  rela-
tionship  to  the  e-cigarette  market  or 
permanent  presence  in  Texas  that 
could give rise to personal jurisdiction. 
The  Supreme  Court  granted  the  peti-
tions for review.

 Expert Reports  
a)  Collin  Creek  Assisted  Living 
Ctr.,  Inc.  v.  Faber,  629 
S.W.3d 630 (Tex. App.—Dal-
las  2021)  (en  banc),  pet. 
granted  (Apr.  1,  2022)  [21-
0470]  

The issue in this case is whether 
claims against an assisted living facil-
ity arising out of a resident’s fall on the 
facility’s sidewalk, pleaded as premises 
liability claims, are health care liability 
claims (HCLCs) under the Texas Medi-
cal Liability Act (TMLA) and therefore 
require an expert report.  

Collin Creek operates a licensed 
facility.  Carmelina 
assisted 
Smith  was  a  resident.  Smith’s  daugh-
ter,  Christine  Faber,  came  to  pick 

living 

134 
 

Smith  up  for  an  appointment.  With 
Smith  seated  backwards  in  a  rolling 
walker,  a  Collin  Creek  employee 
wheeled  Smith’s  walker  down  a  park-
ing lot sidewalk to Faber’s car. A wheel 
of  the  walker  became  caught  in  the 
sidewalk. The walker tipped over, and 
Smith suffered injuries. She died about 
a week later.  

Faber sued Collin Creek, assert-
ing negligence, negligent hiring, prem-
ises  liability,  and  bystander  claims. 
Collin Creek moved to dismiss the case 
for failure to timely serve an expert re-
port under the TMLA, arguing that Fa-
ber’s  claims  were  HCLCs.  Faber 
amended  her  petition  to  remove  any 
claims  of  active  negligence  by  Collin 
Creek,  leaving  only  allegations  based 
on  the  condition  of  the  sidewalk.  The 
trial  court  granted  Collin  Creek’s  mo-
tion  to  dismiss.  The  court  of  appeals 
panel affirmed. On en banc reconsider-
ation,  the  court  of  appeals  reversed, 
holding  that  Faber’s  live  petition  did 
not assert an HCLC and did not require 
an expert report. 

Collin  Creek  filed  a  petition  for 
review.  Collin  Creek  argues  that  Fa-
ber’s  amended  pleading  does  not 
change the nature of Faber’s claims. If 
the  underlying  facts  could  support  an 
HCLC,  then  the  requirements  of  the 
TMLA apply regardless of what theory 
the plaintiff pleads. Here, the underly-
ing facts include the employee’s provi-
sion  of  health  care  to  Smith,  which 
could support an HCLC and require an 
expert  report.  Therefore,  the  trial 
court’s  dismissal  was  proper.  The  Su-
preme Court granted Collin Creek’s pe-
tition for review. 
 

 

 Authority  
a)  Emps.’  Ret.  Fund  v.  City  of 
Dallas, 636 S.W.3d 692 (Tex. 
App.—Dallas 
pet. 
granted  (Feb.  24,  2023)  [22-
0102] 

2021), 

The  issues  in  this  case  are  (1) 
whether  requiring  the  board  of  a  pen-
sion  fund  to  approve  amendments  to 
the city code is an improper delegation 
of  authority;  and  (2) whether  an  ordi-
nance that changes one part of the city 
code constitutes an amendment to an-
other part of the code. 

The Dallas City Code houses the 
governing  provisions  of  the  City  Em-
ployees’  Retirement  Fund.  The  Code 
provides  that  an  ordinance  amending 
those provisions must first be approved 
by the Retirement Fund’s Board. Some 
members  of  the  Board  are  elected  by 
City  employees.  Without  the  Board’s 
approval, the City passed an ordinance 
that imposes term limits on the Board’s 
elected  members.  The  Retirement 
Fund and the City each sought declar-
atory relief and filed cross-motions for 
summary  judgment.  The  trial  court 
granted the City’s motion and rendered 
judgment in its favor.

The court of appeals reversed. It 
held  that  the  ordinance  amended  the 
Retirement  Fund’s  governing  provi-
fundamentally 
it 
sions 
changed  the  qualifications  to  be  an 
elected  member  of  the  Retirement 
Fund’s Board. The court thus held that 
the  portion  of  the  ordinance  that  im-
poses term limits is invalid because the 
City  failed  to  obtain  the  Board’s  ap-
proval. 

The City petitioned the Supreme 
Court  for  review,  arguing  (1)  that 

135 
 

requiring the City to obtain the Board’s 
approval  to  amend  part  of  the  City 
Code  is  an  improper  delegation  of  au-
thority; and (2) that the ordinance does 
not amend the Retirement Fund provi-
sions.  The  Court  granted  the  petition 
for review. 
 

b)  Hotze  v.  Turner,  634  S.W.3d 
508 
(Tex.  App.—Houston 
[14th  Dist.]  2021),  pet. 
granted  (Dec.  16,  2022)  [21-
1037]  

 
This case concerns a pair of bal-
lot  propositions,  Propositions  1  and  2, 
that were submitted to Houston voters 
in 2004. Both were designed to provide 
tax  relief  to  city  residents.  The  ordi-
nance  submitting  them  to  an  election 
included a “poison pill” provision after 
the text of Proposition 1. The provision 
stated that “[i]f another proposition for 
a Charter amendment relating to limi-
tations in City revenues is approved at 
the same election at which this propo-
sition is also approved, and if this prop-
osition  receives  the  higher  number  of 
favorable  votes,  then  this  proposition 
shall prevail and the other shall not be-
come effective.”  

Both  propositions  passed  but 
Proposition 1 received more votes. The 
city then refused to enforce Proposition 
2, relying on the poison-pill provision in 
the  election  ordinance  and  Article  IX, 
Section 19 of the Houston City Charter. 
The charter provision states that if “at 
any election for the adoption of amend-
ments if the provisions of two or more 
proposed  amendments  approved  at 
said  election  are 
inconsistent  the 
amendment receiving the highest num-
ber of votes shall prevail.”  

Hotze,  one  of  the  citizens  who 
had  petitioned  to  get  Proposition  2  on 
the ballot, filed the underlying declara-
tory-judgment  action  to  have  Proposi-
tion  2  enforced.  After  dispositive  mo-
tions and a bench trial, the trial court 
signed a judgment declaring that Prop-
osition 2 is not effective due to the poi-
son pill, the city-charter provision does 
not  apply,  and  the  city  complied  with 
Proposition  1.  A  divided  court  of  ap-
peals  affirmed.  The  Supreme  Court 
granted Hotze’s petition for review.   
 

 

 Duty 
a)  Mendez v. Hous. Harris Area 
Safety  Council,  Inc.,  634 
S.W.3d 154 (Tex. App.—Hou-
ston  [1st  Dist.]  2021),  pet. 
granted  (June  17,  2022)  [21-
0496] 

The Issue in this case is whether 
companies that collect and test employ-
ment-related drug-screen samples owe 
a  duty  of  care  to  the  third-party  em-
ployees being screened. 

Mendez  was  required  to  submit 
to a random drug screen as part of his 
employment.  Houston  Area  Safety 
Council (HASC) was the trade associa-
tion  that  collected  Mendez’s  samples 
and Psychemedics was the drug-testing 
lab  that  tested  his  samples.  Mendez’s 
urine sample was negative, but his hair 
sample was positive for cocaine and co-
caine  metabolites.  Although  a  subse-
quent  hair  test  came  back  negative, 
Mendez  was  terminated  from  his  em-
ployment. After a third test came back 
negative,  Mendez  was  rehired  but  not 
assigned  to  any  jobsites,  so  he  ulti-
mately began working for another em-
ployer. 

136 
 

Mendez sued HASC and Psyche-
medics,  alleging  the  companies  negli-
gently  administered  and  analyzed  the 
first  hair  sample,  resulting  in  a  false 
positive  that  cost  him  his  job.  Both 
companies  filed  motions  for  summary 
judgment. The trial court concluded the 
companies did not owe Mendez a duty 
of  care  and  accordingly  granted  sum-
mary judgment for the companies. The 
court of appeals reversed, holding that 
the  risk–utility  factors  weighed  in  fa-
vor  of  imposing  a  duty  on  the  compa-
nies.  HASC  and  Psychemedics  peti-
tioned  the  Supreme  Court  for  review, 
which the Court granted.  
 

 Railroad Crossing   
b)  Kan.  City  S.  Ry.  Co.  v.  Hor-

926281  (Tex.  App.—Dallas 
2021),  pet.  granted  (Dec.  16, 
2022) [21-0769]  

This case, which arises from the 
collision of a train and a car at a rail-
road  crossing,  raises  questions  of  fed-
eral  preemption,  evidentiary  suffi-
ciency, and charge error.  

Ladonna  Sue  Rigsby  was  killed 
by  a  train  operated  by  Kansas  City 
Southern  Railroad  Company  while 
driving across a railroad crossing. Her 
children  sued  the  Railroad  Company, 
alleging  that  its  failure  to  correct  a 
raised  hump  in  the  mid-point  of  the 
crossing  and  its  failure  to  maintain  a 
yield  sign  at  the  crossing  were  proxi-
mate  causes  of  the  accident.  The  jury 
found  the  Railroad  Company  and 
Rigsby  both  negligent  and  equally  re-
sponsible  for  the  accident.  The  trial 
court entered a judgment awarding the 
plaintiffs  damages  for  the  Railroad 
Company’s negligence. 

 

 Leases 
a)  Apache Corp. v. Apollo Expl., 
LLC,  631  S.W.3d  502  (Tex. 
App.—Eastland  2021),  pet. 
granted  (June  3,  2022)  [21-
0587] 

This  oil-and-gas  lease  dispute 
involves  what  respondents  Apollo  Ex-
ploration,  Cogent  Exploration,  and 
Sellmoco’s  (collectively  Sellers)  rights 
are  under  purchase  and  sale  agree-
ments  (PSAs)  entered  into  with  peti-
tioner Apache Corporation (Apache).  

Sellers  and  Gunn  Oil  Company 
came  to  own  over  109  leases  in  the 
Bivens  Ranch  area,  totaling  120,000 
acres,  with  the  biggest  lease  being 
100,000 acres. This lease is divided into 
three equal blocks: North Block, South 
Block,  and  East  Block.  Sellers  and 
Gunn Oil eventually sold 75% of their 
interests  in  these  leases  to  Apache, 
each  executing  a  separate  PSA  with 
Apache. These PSAs cover the distinct 
fractional  interests  Sellers  and  Gunn 
Oil have in the same 109 leases. 

In time, Sellers sued Apache and 
requested a declaration of their rights 
under the PSAs. Gunn Oil, who sold its 
remaining  lease  interest  to  Apache 
soon  after  the  lawsuit  was  first  initi-
ated, did not join. Sellers sought to de-
termine  how  to  calculate  the  formula 
that—given a certain output—provides 
Sellers the right to repurchase some of 
Apache’s  leases,  Apache’s  duties  with 
regards  to  maintaining  its  leases,  and 
Apache’s  duty  to  offer  to  sell  a  failing 
lease  interest  under  one  PSA  to  all 
Sellers.  The  petition  also  alleges 
Apache  breached  the  PSAs  and  com-
mitted  various  related  torts.  Apache 
filed  motions  for  summary  judgment

proximately  caused  the  collision;  and 
(3) if one of the plaintiff’s liability theo-
ries is invalid, whether the submission 
of both in a single broad-form question 
requires a new trial. A divided court of 
appeals  reversed  and  remanded.  The 
majority  concluded  that  the  plaintiffs’ 
humped-crossing  theory  is  preempted 
by federal law and that the submission 
of  both  the  humped-crossing  theory 
and the yield-sign theory in a single li-

Both sides petitioned for review. 
The plaintiffs challenge the court of ap-
peals’  holding  that  the  humped-cross-

and  the  Railroad  Company  challenges

gued the PSAs allowed Sellers to repur-

quired to offer Sellers a failing lease in-

that  the  North  Block  Lease  termina-

The trial court granted Apache’s

Apache’s  motions  on  how  to  calculate 
the  lease  repurchase  formula  and  on 
how to account for the working interest 
originally  owned  by  Gunn  Oil.  It  also 
granted Apache’s motion on the North 
Block Lease, holding the lease expired 
on  January 1, 2016. Having  narrowed 
the scope of relevant evidence, Apache 
filed  motions  seeking  to  exclude  the 
testimony  of  three  expert  witnesses 
Sellers  had  designated  to  testify  on 
damages  on  relevancy  and  reliability 
grounds.  One  of  those  experts,  Peter 
Huddleston,  testified  that  the  North 
Block  Lease  expired  on  December  31, 
2015, and on how to calculate the work-
ing interest in the Gunn Oil lease. The 
trial court granted these motions. With 
these  rulings  secured,  Apache  then 
filed a no-evidence motion for summary 
judgment  arguing  Sellers  could  pro-
duce  no  evidence  of  damages  for  their 
remaining  breach-of-contract  and  tort 
claims.  The  court  granted  the  motion 
and,  after  Sellers  nonsuited  their  re-
maining claims, rendered a final judg-
ment that Sellers take nothing on their 
claims  and  that  Apache  recover  attor-
neys’ fees. 

The court of appeals affirmed in 

138 
 

part,  reversed  in  part,  and  remanded 
the case back to the trial court for fur-
ther proceedings. The court of appeals 
affirmed  the  trial  court  that  Sellers 
take  nothing  on  some  of  their  tort 
claims  and  on  the  exclusion  of  two  of 
the damages experts. The CA reversed 
on (1) the expiration date of the North 
Block Lease, (2) the determination that 
Apache did not have to offer Sellers its 
failing lease interests under the Gunn 
Oil  PSA,  and  (3)  the  lease  repurchase 
formula. The court of appeals reasoned 
the lease expiration date was ambigu-
ous,  that  the  PSA  required  Apache  to 
offer all Sellers a failing least interest, 
and  that  Apache  had  not  conclusively 
established  its  meaning  of  the  repur-
chase provision was correct. Because of 
the reversals on the first two issues, the 
court of appeals also reversed the trial 
court’s order excluding expert Huddle-
ston’s  damages  testimony  as  to  those 
issues. Consequently, the appeals court 
also reversed the no-evidence summary 
judgment  order  on  damages  and  its 
award  of  attorneys’  fees  to  Apache.  In 
light of these rulings, the appeals court 
reversed  the  final  judgment  and  re-
manded for further proceedings. 

Apache  petitioned  the  Supreme 
Court requesting a reversal of the court 
of  appeals’  judgment  that  (1)  there 
were  fact  issues  regarding  the  North 
(2) 
Block  Lease  expiration  date, 
Apache’s  obligation  to  offer  Sellers  its 
failing lease interests under the Gunn 
Oil  PSA,  and  that  (3)  Apache  had  not 
conclusively  established  the  meaning 
of  the 
lease  repurchase  provision. 
Lastly, Apache requests the Court rein-
state  the  trial  court’s  order  granting 
Apache’s  no-evidence  summary  judg-
ment  order.  The  Supreme  Court 

Headington’s  interest  in  other  tracts. 
The agreement included a release pro-
vision  in  which  Headington  released 
Petro  “and  its  affiliates  and  their  re-
spective  officers,  directors,  sharehold-
ers,  employees,  agents,  predecessors 
and  representatives”  for  any  claims 
and  liabilities  related  to  the  Loving 
Tract. 

Headington sued Finley, seeking 
recovery  of  damages  stemming  from 
the termination of Headington’s rights 
under the Arrington Lease. Petro inter-
vened,  arguing  Headington  had  re-
leased its claims against Finley by vir-
tue of Finley’s status as a “predecessor” 
of Petro with respect to the lease rights. 
The  trial  court  rendered  summary 
judgment for Finley and Petro, holding 
that  the  word  “predecessor”  in  the  re-
lease included a predecessor in title to 
the subject property interest.  

A  divided  court  of  appeals  re-
versed,  holding  that  the  word  “prede-
cessors” in the release did not unambig-
uously include Finley because it was in-
cluded  with  a  list  of  terms  that  relate 
to  corporate  composition  or  structure, 
not  to  real-property  interests.  Accord-
ingly, the release did not apply to Fin-
ley as a predecessor in title. For essen-
tially the same reason, the court of ap-
peals held that Finley did not qualify as 
a third-party beneficiary of the release.       

Petro  and  Finley  filed  petitions 
for review, arguing that the court of ap-
peals ignored ordinary rules of contract 
interpretation  and  instead  applied  a 
narrow, and erroneous, construction of 
the  release.  The  Supreme  Court 
granted the petitions for review. 

     

granted the petition. 

 
 Release Provisions  
a)  Finley  Res.,  Inc.  v.  Heading-
ton Royalty, Inc., 623 S.W.3d 
480 
(Tex.  App.—Dallas 
2021),  pet.  granted.  (Sept.  2, 
2022) [21-0509] 

This  case  presents  issues  con-
cerning the scope of a release provision 
in an acreage swap agreement between 
two oil-and-gas lessees.   

Finley owned leasehold rights to 
the  shallow  minerals  (up  to 5,000  feet 
deep)  on  a  tract  of  land  (the  Loving 
Tract)  pursuant  to  the  Arrington 
Lease. Headington held a leasehold in-
terest in the “deep rights” (below 5,000 
feet) on the same tract under the same 
lease.  Petro  Canyon  obtained  a  top 
lease  from  WIRC,  LLC  entitling  it  to 
mineral  rights  for  the  entire  Loving 
Tract  upon  termination  of  the  Arring-
ton Lease. In June 2017, Petro notified 
Finley  that  the  Arrington  Lease  may 
have terminated due to Finley’s failure 
to  produce  in  paying  quantities.  They 
entered  into  an  agreement  in  which 
Finley assigned its rights under the Ar-
rington  Lease  to  Petro’s  affiliate,  and 
Petro  agreed  to  assume  all  liabilities 
Finley incurred with respect to the Lov-
ing  Tract.  Finley  notified  Headington 
of  its  intent  to  plug  and  abandon  its 
wells,  and  Headington  took  the  posi-
tion  that  the  notice  was  too  late  be-
cause  the  Arrington  Lease,  including 
Headington’s interest, had terminated 
before  the  assignment  due  to  Finley’s 
failure to produce. Petro and Heading-
ton subsequently entered into an acre-
age swap agreement whereby Petro as-
signed its interest in the Loving Tract 
for 
in 
to  Headington

 Royalty Payments 
a)  1776 Energy Partners, LLC v. 
Freeport-McMoRan  Oil  & 
Gas  LLC,  ___  S.W.3d  ___, 
2021  WL  6127930 
(Tex. 
App.—San  Antonio  2021), 
pet.  granted  (Dec.  16,  2022) 
[22-0095] 

The issue in this case is whether 
a  title  dispute  permits  a  payor  of  oil-
and-gas proceeds to withhold payments 
without interest under the safe-harbor 
provision  of  the  Texas  Natural  Re-
sources  Code.  The  safe-harbor  statute 
permits payors of oil-and-gas proceeds 
to withhold payments without interest 
if  there  is  a  payee  title  dispute  that 
would  affect  distribution  of  payments 
or  reasonable  doubt  as  to  the  payee’s 
clear title. 

Oil-and-gas  operator  Ovintiv 
agreed to pay 1776 Energy certain pro-
ceeds from the development of oil-and-
gas  interests.  During  the  agreements’ 
operative  period,  a  third  party  sued 
and won a judgment against 1776 En-
ergy.  The  judgment  ordered  1776  En-
ergy to transfer its legal title to the pro-
duction  payments. 
1776  Energy 
promptly  posted  a  supersedeas  bond 
and appealed. In light of the judgment 
and appeal, Ovintiv suspended its pay-
ments  to  1776  Energy  under  the  safe 
harbor. While the appeal was pending, 
1776  Energy  sued  Ovintiv  for  wrong-
fully  withholding  production  pay-
ments. 

Ovintiv  moved 

for  summary 
judgment,  arguing  that  the  title  dis-
pute affected distribution of payments 
or  engendered  reasonable  doubt  as  to 
1776  Energy’s  clear  title,  so  Ovintiv 
was  entitled  to  suspend  payments 

140 
 

under  the  safe  harbor.  The  trial  court 
granted  summary  judgment,  but  the 
court of appeals reversed. The court of 
appeals  held  that  Ovintiv  was  always 
obligated  to  pay  1776  Energy  because 
the  supersedeas  bond  suspended  the 
judgment and 1776 Energy never relin-
quished  legal  title,  so  no  title  dispute 
affected the payments. The court of ap-
peals  also  held  that  genuine  issues  of 
material fact precluded summary judg-
ment on whether Ovintiv had reasona-
ble doubt as to clear title because Ovin-
tiv’s  corporate  representative  testified 
that  Ovintiv  knew  that  1776  Energy 
would  hold  the  assets  until  it  trans-
ferred legal title, and because no other 
payor suspended payments to 1776 En-
ergy. 

Ovintiv petitioned for review, ar-
guing that the safe harbor entitled it to 
suspend payments in light of the litiga-
tion, since it created reasonable doubt 
as  to  clear  title  and  affected  which 
payee  would  ultimately  be  entitled  to 
the  payments.  The  Supreme  Court 
granted review. 
 

b)  Devon  Energy  Prod.  Co.  v. 
Sheppard,  643  S.W.3d  186 
(Tex.  App.—Corpus  Christi– 
Edinburg 2020), pet. granted 
(April 1, 2022) [20-0904] 
At  issue  in  this  case is  whether 
the  parties’  lease  required  Devon  En-
ergy  to  add  postproduction  costs  in-
curred by third-party purchasers to the 
gross  proceeds  from  sale  before  calcu-
lating Sheppard’s royalty. 

Sheppard sued Devon Energy for 
allegedly reducing royalty payments by 
failing  to  add  postproduction  costs. 
Devon Energy asserted it did not incur 
the  costs  at  issue;  they  were  instead 

incurred  by  downstream  purchasers, 
and Devon Energy was not required to 
add post-sale costs to the royalty base. 
The parties stipulated to twenty-three 
issues,  each  addressing  particular 
amounts  that  Devon  Energy  allegedly 
failed to add to the royalty base in vio-
lation  of  the  lease.  The  trial  court 
granted  summary  judgment  for  Shep-
pard on all twenty-three issues. 

The court of appeals affirmed in 
part  and  reversed  in  part.  The  court 
noted  that  the  royalty  provision  was 
“highly  unique”:  the  provision  stated 
that  certain  sums  “shall  be  added”  to 
the royalty base so that Sheppard’s roy-
alty  is  not  charged  “directly  or  indi-
rectly”  with  postproduction  costs.  The 
court  held  that,  per  those  terms,  the 
plain  language  of  the  lease  required 
Devon  Energy  to  add  expenses  in-
curred by third-party purchasers to the 
royalty  base.  Applying  the  lease  as  so 
construed,  the  court  of  appeals  held 
that some but not all the amounts at is-
sue  in  the  stipulated  issues  should 
have  been  added  to  the  royalty  base. 
Accordingly,  the  court  of  appeals  af-
firmed summary judgment as to those 
amounts that should have been added 
and reversed summary judgment as to 
those that should not have been added. 
Devon  Energy  petitioned  for  re-
view.  Devon  Energy  asserts  that  be-
cause the royalty is based on gross pro-
ceeds  from  sale,  post-sale  costs  neces-
sarily must not be included in the roy-
alty  base.  Devon  Energy  argues  that 
the  court  of  appeals  therefore  erred, 
contending  that  the  court  construed 
the lease’s terms in isolation and with-
out  regard  for  precedent  construing 
gross-proceeds  leases.  Sheppard  ar-
gues  that  the  plain  language  of  the 

141 
 

lease  controls  over  background  princi-
ples  and  that  Devon’s  argument  ren-
ders  portions  of  the  lease  surplusage. 
The Supreme Court granted Devon En-
ergy’s petition for review. 
 

 

 Compulsory Joinder  
a)  In re Kappemeyer, ___ S.W.3d 
___,  2021  WL  5577761  (Tex. 
App.—Corpus Christi—Edin-
burg  Nov.  30,  2021),  argu-
ment granted on pet. for writ 
of mandamus (Sept. 2, 2022) 
[21-1063]  

The principal issue in this case is 
whether individual homeowners are re-
quired to join all 700 of a community’s 
other homeowners to secure a declara-
tion  that  the  homeowner’s  association 
cannot  enforce  restrictive  covenants 
the  association  unilaterally  amended 
to subject the plaintiffs to the associa-
tion’s enforcement authority. The trial 
court  granted  the  association’s  motion 
to  abate  and  ordered  the  plaintiff 
homeowners  to  join  and  serve  all  700 
homeowners  within  ninety  days  on 
pain of dismissal. The court of appeals 
summarily denied mandamus relief. 
 
On  petition  for  writ  of  manda-
mus to the Supreme Court, the plaintiff 
homeowners  assert  that  joinder  is  not 
compulsory  because  they  seek  only  a 
declaration  preventing  enforcement  of 
the restrictive covenants against them 
and the Declaratory Judgments Act ex-
pressly  states  that  a  declaration  of 
rights  does  not  prejudice  the  rights  of 
any person not a party to the lawsuit. 
They  further  contend  that  Rule 39  of 
the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure does 
not  require  joinder  of  all  homeowners 
acted 
because 

association 

the 

unilaterally  in  amending  the  restric-
tive covenants and because the associ-
ation  failed  to  meet  its  burden  to 
demonstrate  that  the  other  homeown-
ers have “claim[ed] an interest relating 
to the subject of the action.”  

In opposition, the association ar-
gues that the other homeowners claim 
an  interest  in  the  litigation  through 
their  deeds  because  (1) the  litigation 
impacts  their  property  rights  and 
(2) the findings necessary to grant the 
requested declaration would either in-
validate  the  amended  restrictive  cove-
nants entirely or allow the plaintiffs to 
avoid paying what the association has 
deemed their “fair share” of the upkeep 
for community amenities. The associa-
tion  further  maintains  that,  without 
joinder, it would be at risk of multiple 
lawsuits  and  inconsistent  obligations 
with respect to the nonparty homeown-
ers.  
 

 Dismissal 
a)  CAE SimuFlite, Inc. v. Tala-
vera,  ___  S.W.3d  ___,  2022 
WL 202987 (Tex. App.—Dal-
las  2022),  pet.  granted  (Dec. 
16, 2022) [22-0180] 

The main issues in this case are 
whether  Texas  should  recognize  a 
cause  of  action  for  educational  mal-
practice and whether a trial court must 
grant a Rule 91a motion to dismiss any 
time a novel claim is asserted.  

This  case  arises  out  of  a  plane 
crash in which the two pilots on board, 
Talavera  and  Flores,  were  killed.  The 
pilots’  heirs  and  representatives  sued 
the  two  flight-training  centers  that 
trained the pilots, CAE and American, 
alleging negligent training and breach 
of contract. The pilots’ lawsuit centered 

142 
 

on  the  allegation  that  the  crash  re-
sulted from the flight-training centers’ 
inadequate  training  and  instruction. 
Both CAE and American moved to dis-
miss the pilots’ claims on the basis that 
Texas law has never recognized a claim 
for  educational  malpractice.  The  trial 
court denied the motions to dismiss but 
authorized  a  permissive  interlocutory 
appeal. The court of appeals denied the 
petition  and  dismissed  the  appeal  for 
want of jurisdiction.  

The  flight-training  centers  peti-
tioned for review, arguing that (1) the 
pilots’ claims are claims of educational 
malpractice;  (2)  Texas  should  not  rec-
ognize a cause of action for educational 
malpractice; and (3) Rule 91a requires 
a  trial  court  to  grant  a  motion  to  dis-
miss any time a novel claim is asserted. 
The  Supreme  Court  granted  the  peti-
tion for review. 
 

 Statute of Limitations 
a)  Ferrer  v.  Almanza,  647 
S.W.3d  726  (Tex.  App.—Am-
arillo  Mar.  16,  2021),  pet. 
granted  (June  17,  2022)  [21-
0513] 

The issue in this case is whether 
section 16.063 of the Texas Civil Prac-
tice  and  Remedies  Code  tolls  the  stat-
ute of limitations on an action when a 
resident defendant is physically absent 
from the state even though the defend-
ant is still amenable to service by Texas 
courts.  

This suit arises from a car acci-
dent involving Respondent Isabella Al-
manza and Petitioner Sibel Ferrer. Fol-
lowing the accident, Almanza left to at-
tend college out of state. Ferrer filed a 
negligence  suit  two  years  later  but 
named  the  wrong  defendants.  Ferrer 

did not name as a defendant and serve 
Almanza until after the statute of limi-
tations had run on her claims. Almanza 
moved for summary judgment based on 
the  statute  of  limitations.  Ferrer  as-
serted  section  16.063  as  a  defense  to 
the statute of limitations.  

The  district  court  granted  sum-
mary  judgment  for  Almanza.  Ferrer 
appealed  and  the  court  of  appeals  af-
firmed. The court of appeals held that 
Supreme  Court  and  circuit  precedent 
holding that non-residents amenable to 
service  in  Texas  were  not  absent  for 
purposes  of  tolling  the  statute  of  limi-
tations under section 16.063 applied to 
bar application of the tolling statute to 
Ferrer’s claims. 

Ferrer filed a petition for review 
arguing that the court of appeals erred 
because  (1)  section  16.063  explicitly 
tolls  the  statute  of limitations  when  a 
Texas  resident  is  physically  absent 
from  the  state  and  (2)  Supreme  Court 
precedent to the contrary only applied 
to  non-residents.  The  Supreme  Court 
granted the petition for review.  
 

 Venue  
a)  Great  Divide  Ins.  Co.  v. 
Fortenberry,  ___  S.W.3d  ___, 
(Tex. 
2021  WL  3160189 
App.—Dallas 
pet. 
2021), 
granted  (Sept.  30,  2022)  [21-
1047]  

The issue in this case is whether 
a hotel may be a residence for purposes 
of determining venue.  

Fortenberry signed a three-year 
contract to play for the Dallas Cowboys 
and  began  training  with  the  team  in 
Dallas  County.  The  team  provided 
Fortenberry with a room at a Residence 
Inn  hotel,  where  Fortenberry  stayed 

143 
 

while  participating  in  team  activities. 
He suffered a serious knee injury at the 
Cowboys’  training  camp  in  California. 
He was unable to return to professional 
football,  and  the  Cowboys  eventually 
terminated his contract.  

Fortenberry  filed  suit  against 
Great  Divide  Insurance  Co.  for  work-
ers’  compensation  in  Dallas  County. 
Great  Divide  moved  to  transfer  venue 
to Travis County, asserting that venue 
was  not  proper  in  Dallas  County  be-
cause  it  was  not  Fortenberry’s  resi-
dence  at  the  time  of  the  injury.  The 
trial  court  denied  Great  Divide’s  mo-
tion  and  the  case  proceeded  to  trial. 
The jury rendered a verdict in Forten-
berry’s favor, and Great Divide was or-
dered to pay temporary income benefits 
to Fortenberry.  

Great  Divide  appealed  the  ver-
dict on several issues. The court of ap-
peals  reversed  and  remanded  for  fur-
ther  proceedings  on  the  venue  issue. 
The  court  concluded  that  Fortenberry 
had not presented prima facie evidence 
that he resided in Dallas County at the 
time  of  his  injury  because  a  stay  in  a 
hotel cannot meet the three-prong resi-
dence  test  created  by  Snyder  v.  Pitts, 
241 S.W.2d 136 (Tex. 1951).  

In  his  petition 

for  review, 
Fortenberry  argues  that  the  court  of 
appeals  erred  by  (1)  failing  to  review 
the  entire  record  for  any  evidence  of 
proper  venue,  as  required  by  Ruiz  v. 
Conoco, 868 S.W.2d 752 (Tex. 1993); (2) 
misapplying the Snyder residence test; 
and  (3)  holding  that  Fortenberry  did 
not  produce  prima  facie  evidence  that 
Great  Divide  had  a  principal  office  in 
Dallas  County.  The  Supreme  Court 
granted  Fortenberry’s  petition  for  re-
view. 

 

 

 Batson Challenge  
a)  United Rentals N. Am., Inc. v. 
Evans, 608 S.W.3d 449 (Tex. 
pet. 
App.—Dallas 
granted.  (Sept.  2,  2022)  [20-
0737]  

2020), 

This  wrongful-death  case  pre-
sents issues regarding (1) Batson chal-
lenges  in  jury  selection,  (2) the  duty 
owed  to  motorists  by  equipment  ship-
pers  who  use  independent  carriers, 
(3) the  sufficiency  of  the  evidence  to 
support  non-economic  damages,  and 
(4) the  admissibility  of  testimony  re-
garding the interpretation of the Texas 
Administrative Code and the necessity 
of a limiting instruction. 
United  Rentals  outsourced  the 
 
transport  of  its  boom  lift  and  forklift, 
with Lares Trucking hired to transport 
the forklift. In a mix-up, Lares Truck-
ing’s  driver  Valentin  Martinez  picked 
up  and  transported  the  boom  lift  in-
stead, resulting in an over-height load. 
During transport, the boom lift struck 
a  low-clearance  bridge  and  a  bridge 
beam collapsed on a vehicle, fatally in-
juring the driver, Clark Davis. Davis’s 
family sued United Rentals.  
 
During  voir  dire,  the trial  court 
sustained  the  plaintiffs’  Batson  chal-
lenge  to  peremptory  strikes  United 
Rentals  used  on  black  women  but  de-
nied United Rentals’ Batson challenge 
to the plaintiffs’ peremptory strikes on 
men, four of whom were white. At trial 
and over an objection, the trial court al-
lowed an expert witness to testify about 
allocation  of  responsibility  under  the 
Texas Administrative Code and denied 
limiting 
United  Rentals’  requested 

144 
 

instruction  regarding  the  Code’s  re-
quirements.  The  trial  court  rendered 
judgment  on  a  jury  verdict,  awarding 
the plaintiffs $2.79 million in compen-
satory damages, including for pain and 
mental  anguish  Davis  suffered  before 
his death. 
The  court  of  appeals  affirmed, 
 
holding that (1) the trial court did not 
err  in  its  Batson,  evidentiary,  and 
charge  rulings;  (2) as  a  party  partici-
pating in the loading of the over-height 
equipment, United Rentals owed Davis 
a duty of reasonable care; (3) sufficient 
evidence  supported  the  jury’s  finding 
that  United  Rentals’  negligence  proxi-
mately  caused  Davis’s  death  and  that 
Davis consciously experienced pain and 
anguish;  and  (4) the  damages  award 
was  not  excessive.  Three  justices  dis-
sented  to  the  denial  of  en  banc  recon-
sideration.  The  Supreme  Court  of 
Texas granted United Rentals’ petition 
for review. 

 
 Order Granting New Trial 
a)  In  re  Rudolph  Auto.,  LLC, 
616 S.W.3d 171 (Tex. App.—
El  Paso  2020),  pet.  granted 
Sept. 2, 2022 [21-0135]  

severely 

At  issue  in  this  case is  whether 
the trial court abused its discretion by 
granting plaintiff a new trial. Plaintiff 
was 
injured  when  her 
coworker  struck her  with his truck on 
the  premises  of  their  employer,  a  car 
dealership.  Both  plaintiff  and  the 
coworker had been drinking alcohol on 
the  dealership’s  premises.  Plaintiff 
brought tort claims against the dealer-
ship, the coworker who struck her, and 
a  third  coworker  who  had  purchased 
the  alcohol.  A  jury  awarded  plaintiff 
roughly $4 million in damages.  

In response to Question 1 of the 
jury charge, the jury found that neither 
plaintiff  nor  the  coworker  who  struck 
her  were  acting  in  the  scope  of  their 
employment  when  the  accident  oc-
curred,  but  the  jury  found  that  the 
coworker  who  purchased  the  alcohol 
was acting in the scope of his employ-
ment.  In  response  to  Question  2,  the 
jury  found  that  any  negligence  by  the 
dealership  did  not  proximately  cause 
plaintiff’s  injuries,  but  in  response  to 
Question 4, the jury assigned the deal-
ership  10%  responsibility.  The  trial 
court denied the dealership’s motion to 
disregard the jury’s answer to Question 
4, and it granted plaintiff’s motion for 
new trial. The court of appeals denied

are  whether  Painter 

In the Supreme Court, the deal-
ership  challenges  each  of  the  reasons 
given  by  the  trial  court  in  its  order 
granting  a  new  trial.  One  issue  is 
whether  the  trial  court  erred  by  con-
cluding  that  the  jury’s  no-negligence 
finding  in  response  to  Question  2  and 
its  assignment  of  responsibility  to  the 
dealership  in  response  to  Question  4 
create an irreconcilable conflict. Other

v. 
Amerimex Drilling I, Ltd. supports the 
trial  court’s  decision  to  grant  a  new 
trial  to  reconsider  arguments  about 
whether plaintiff and the individual de-
fendants  were  acting  in  the  scope  of 
employment and whether a new trial is 
justified either by allegedly prejudicial 
testimony  by  the  dealership’s  expert 
witness or by the jury’s relatively small 
non-economic damages award to plain-
tiff.  The  Court  has  granted  review  of 
the dealership’s mandamus petition.

 Jury  Instructions  and  Ques-

tions 

a)  Schindler  Elevator  Corp.  v. 
Ceasar,  2021  WL  5570136 
(Tex. App.—Beaumont 2021), 
pet.  granted  (Dec.  16,  2022) 
[22-0030] 

This  appeal  concerns  whether 
the  trial  court  in  this  personal-injury 
case  erred 
in  excluding  evidence, 
charging  the  jury,  and  imposing  sanc-
tions  (including  mid-trial  document 
production)  and  whether  those  errors, 
if any, were harmful. 

Darren  Ceasar  sued  Schindler 
Elevator Corporation for personal inju-
ries resulting from an elevator coming 
to an abrupt stop. At trial, the court re-
fused  to  allow  Schindler  to  introduce 
evidence of Ceasar’s denied application 
for  Social  Security  disability  benefits 
and an earlier lawsuit for personal in-
juries.  In  the  jury  charge,  the  trial 
court refused to include a spoliation in-
struction  regarding  a  post-accident 
video  Ceasar  had  deleted,  and  it  in-
structed  the  jury,  over  Schindler’s  ob-
jection,  on  res  ipsa  loquitur.  The  trial 
court  also  required  Schindler  to  pro-
duce documents mid-trial and imposed 
monetary sanctions for discovery abuse 
against Schindler. The jury returned a 
10–2 verdict for Ceasar. 

Schindler appealed, raising sev-
eral  issues,  including  the  exclusion  of 
evidence, the jury charge, and the mid-
trial  document  production  and  sanc-
tions.  The  court  of  appeals  rejected 
Schindler’s  arguments  and  affirmed 
the judgment. 

Schindler  petitioned  the  Su-
preme  Court  for  review,  asserting  the 
trial court committed harmful error by 
(1)  excluding  evidence  of  Ceasar’s 

disability  application  and  earlier  law-
suit, (2) instructing the jury on res ipsa 
loquitur,  (3)  refusing  Schindler’s  re-
quested  spoliation  instruction,  and  (4) 
requiring  Schindler  to  produce  docu-
ments during trial and imposing mone-
tary  sanctions.  The  Court  granted 
Schindler’s petition. 
 

 Personal Jurisdiction 
a)  State v. Volkswagen Aktieng-
esellschaft, 2020 WL 7640037 
(Tex.  App.—Austin  2020), 
pet.  granted  (Jan.  28,  2022) 
[21-0130],  consolidated  for 
oral  argument  with  State  v. 
Audi Aktiengesellschaft, 2020 
WL  7640037  (Tex.  App.—
Austin  2020),  pet.  granted 
(Jan. 28, 2022) [21-0133] 
The  sole  issue  in  this  appeal  is 
whether Texas courts have personal ju-
risdiction over a nonresident defendant 
when that defendant directs its actions 
toward  the  United  States  as  a  whole, 
but not Texas specifically. Volkswagen 
Aktiengesellschaft (VW Germany) and 
its  subsidiaries,  including  Audi  Ak-
tiengesellschaft  (Audi  Germany)  and 
Volkswagen Group of America, Inc., vi-
olated  U.S.  environmental  laws  by  in-
stalling defeat devices in their cars. De-
feat devices reduce the effectiveness of 
a car’s emissions system and are illegal 
in the United States. Seeking to avoid 
complying  with  federal  environmental 
regulations,  VW  Germany  and  Audi 
Germany  jointly  decided  to  install  de-
feat  devices  in  their  cars  sold  in  the 
United States. When the defeat devices 
began  to  develop  hardware  failures, 
VW  Germany  and  Audi  Germany  in-
stalled  software  fixes  in  in-use,  post-
sale cars throughout the United States. 

146 
 

They did this by (1) issuing recalls and 
installing the software fixes and (2) up-
dating  the  software  when  customers 
in  for  normal 
brought  their  cars 
maintenance. They never revealed the 
purpose of these software updates. 

When  these  actions  came  to 
the  State  of  Texas  sued 
light, 
Volkswagen  Group  of  America  and 
other American entities in a civil envi-
ronmental enforcement action, seeking 
civil penalties and injunctive relief for 
violations  of  the  Texas  Clean  Air  Act. 
Throughout  the  litigation,  the  parties 
have referred to the original factory in-
stallation of defeat devices as “original 
tampering.”  They  have  used  the  term 
“recall tampering” for the allegations of 
installing  the  software  fixes  via  recall 
and  service  campaigns.  The  American 
defendants  moved  for  summary  judg-
law 
ment,  arguing 
preempted  the  State’s  claims.  The 
State  later  added  VW  Germany  and 
Audi Germany as defendants. The trial 
court  granted  partial  summary  judg-
ment  for  the  defendants  on  the  origi-
nal-tampering claims, denying it as to 
the  recall-tampering  claims.  The  Ger-
man entities specially appeared; when 
the trial court denied their special ap-
pearances, the German entities filed an 
interlocutory appeal. 

federal 

that 

A  divided  court  of  appeals  re-
versed  and  dismissed  the  claims 
against  the  German  entities,  holding 
that they had not purposefully availed 
themselves  of  Texas  because  they  di-
rected  recall-tampering  toward  the 
United  States  as  a  whole,  not  Texas 
specifically. Texas courts therefore had 
no personal jurisdiction over them. 

The State filed a petition for re-
view, arguing that the German entities 

purposefully  availed  themselves  of 
Texas’s jurisdiction by effectuating the 
recall campaigns through an American 
subsidiary and by maintaining ongoing 
relationships  with  the  cars.  The  Ger-
man entities counter that because their 
conduct  was  directed  toward  the 
United  States  as  a  whole,  not  Texas 
specifically,  they  did  not  purposefully 
avail  themselves  of  Texas.  The  Court 
granted the petitions for review. 
 

 

 Subrogation  
a)  PNC  Mortg.  v.  Howard,  651 
S.W.3d 154 (Tex. App.—Dal-
las 2021), pet. granted (Sept. 
2, 2022) [21-0941] 

The issue is whether the statute 
of 
limitations  bars  a  refinancing 
lender’s equitable-subrogation claim.   
In  2003,  the  Howards  bought  a 
home using two purchase-money mort-
gages. Two years later, they refinanced 
with Bank of Indiana, using that loan 
to  pay  off  the  earlier  mortgages.  In 
March  2008,  the  bank  assigned  the 
Howards’ note and deed of trust to Na-
tional City Mortgage Company (which 
later merged with PNC), and the How-
ards stopped making payments in No-
vember.  National  City  accelerated  the 
refinance  note  on  June  19,  2009.  The 
parties  dispute  whether  PNC  later 
abandoned  that  acceleration.  In  the 
spring of 2010, Bank of Indiana accel-
erated  and  foreclosed  despite  the  ear-
lier  assignment  to  National  City.  The 
Howards  sued  Bank  of  Indiana,  seek-
ing  a  declaration  that  the  foreclosure 
sale  was  void.  Because  Bank  of  Indi-
identified 
ana’s  acceleration  notice 
PNC  as  the  mortgage  servicer,  the 
Howards  also  named  PNC  as  a 

147 
 

defendant.  In  January  2015,  after  the 
trial  court  granted  partial  summary 
judgment  for  the  Howards  declaring 
the sale void, PNC filed counterclaims 
for contractual and equitable subroga-
tion and to foreclose the lien. PNC also 
filed  a  separate  suit against  the  How-
ards for damages based on their failure 
to  comply  with  the  note’s  obligations. 
The two suits were consolidated.  

The trial court held a bench trial 
and rendered a take-nothing judgment 
against  PNC,  ordering  that  the  note 
and lien on the Howards’ property were 
void. The court of appeals affirmed, and 
the  Supreme  Court  reversed  and  re-
manded to the court of appeals. On re-
mand,  the  court  of  appeals  again  af-
firmed, holding that the equitable-sub-
rogation claim accrued on the maturity 
date  of  the  refinancing  loan—the  date 
the  loan  was  accelerated  in  June 
2009—and was thus barred by the four-
year statute of limitations. 

PNC  filed  a  petition  for  review, 
arguing  that  an  equitable-subrogation 
claim accrues not on the maturity date 
of  the  new  refinance  debt,  but  on  the 
maturity date of the original debt that 
the funds from the refinance loan were 
used to discharge. The Supreme Court 
granted the petition for review. 
 

 

 Property Tax 
a)  Iraan-Sheffield  Indep.  Sch. 
Dist. v. Pecos Cnty. Appraisal 
Dist.,  645  S.W.3d  827  (Tex. 
App.—El  Paso  2022),  pet. 
granted  (Dec.  16,  2022)  [22-
0313] 

The  main  issue  on  appeal  is 
whether  Iraan-Sheffield  ISD  lawfully 
contingent-fee 
a 
entered 

into 

agreement with an attorney under Sec-
tion  6.30(c)  of  the  Texas  Tax  Code, 
which  authorizes  taxing  units  to  hire 
private counsel on a contingent-fee ba-
sis “to represent the unit to enforce the 
collection of delinquent taxes.” 

The  school  district  contracted 
with attorney D.  Brent  Lemon  to  pur-
sue  claims  against  Kinder  Morgan  for 
delinquent taxes. The district contends 
that  Kinder  Morgan  inaccurately  or 
fraudulently  valued  its  mineral  inter-
ests and, as a result, underpaid ad val-
orem  taxes.  The  school  district’s  chal-
lenge  to  the  appraisal  district’s  valua-
tion was unsuccessful, so Lemon timely 
perfected  an  administrative  appeal  to 
the  district  court.  In  that  proceeding, 
Kinder  Morgan  and  the  appraisal  dis-
trict  jointly  filed  a  Rule 12  motion  to 
show authority, alleging the school dis-
trict lacked statutory authority to hire 
Lemon  on  a  contingent-fee  basis. 
Kinder  Morgan  contends  that  Section 
6.30(c) does not authorize Lemon’s en-
gagement  because  the  school  district’s 
contract with Lemon is in reality a “tax 
ferret  contract”  to  identify  new  prop-
erty  that  is  not  on  the  tax  rolls  for  a 
contingent fee. The trial court granted 
the motion, struck all pleadings filed by 
Lemon,  and  dismissed  the  suit  with 
prejudice. 

The  court  of  appeals  reversed 
and  remanded,  holding  that  despite 
having features of a tax-ferret contract, 
Section  6.30(c)  authorized  the  engage-
ment  because  “delinquent  taxes,”  as 
used  in  Section  6.30,  should  not  be 
given  the  restrictive,  technical  mean-
ing derived from other provisions of the 
Tax Code. 

Kinder  Morgan  and  the  ap-
praisal district petitioned the Supreme 

148 
 

Court for review, arguing that no stat-
ute,  including  Section  6.30(c),  author-
ized  the  school  district  to  enter  into  a 
contingent-fee  agreement  with  Lemon 
because  the  engagement  does  not  in-
volve  the  collection  of  “delinquent” 
taxes  as  the  word  is  used  throughout 
the  Tax  Code.  The  Court  granted 
Kinder  Morgan  and  the  appraisal  dis-
trict’s petition for review. 
 

 

 Tolling 
a)  El  Pistolón  II,  Ltd.  v.  Levin-
son  Alcoser  Assocs.,  627 
S.W.3d 494 (Tex. App.—Cor-
pus  Christi–Edinburg  2021), 
pet.  granted  (Feb.  24,  2023) 
[21-0797] 

The issue in this case is whether 
the  statute  of  limitations  is  equitably 
tolled  for  a  plaintiff’s  subsequent  suit 
after the court dismissed the plaintiff’s 
earlier suit based on its failure to file a 
statutorily compliant expert certificate. 
Property owner El Pistolón sued 
Levinson  for  breach  of  contract  and 
negligence,  alleging  that  Levinson 
failed to competently design the archi-
tecture for a proposed shopping center. 
When a plaintiff claims damages aris-
ing from the provision of services by a 
licensed architectural firm, Civil Prac-
tice  and  Remedies  Code  Chapter 150 
requires the plaintiff to include with its 
petition a certificate of merit from a li-
censed architect attesting to the factual 
basis of the plaintiff’s claims. The par-
ties litigated whether El Pistolón’s cer-
tificate  of  merit  was  sufficient.  The 
trial  court  initially  concluded  that  it 
was,  but  the  Supreme  Court  reversed 
that decision seven years after El Pis-
tolón filed its certificate and remanded 

the  case.  On  remand,  the  trial  court 
dismissed El Pistolón’s claims without 
prejudice. 

El  Pistolón  immediately  refiled 
its  suit  against  Levinson  with  a  new 
certificate  of  merit, but  the  trial  court 
granted  summary  judgment,  conclud-
ing that El Pistolón’s claims were now 
barred  by  the  statute  of  limitations. 
The court of appeals reversed, holding 
that the statute of limitations was eq-
uitably tolled. The court of appeals re-
lied  on  the  legal  impediment  rule  to 
conclude that the necessity of El Pisto-
lón’s  subsequent  lawsuit  depended  on 
the outcome of the appeal in the earlier 
suit, thus impeding El Pistolón from fil-
ing earlier. 

Levinson  petitioned  for  review, 
arguing that the court of appeals erred 
in extending the legal impediment rule 
outside  the  legal  malpractice  context. 
The Supreme Court granted review. 

 

 

 Applicability to Claims 
a)  Comcast Corp. v. Hous. Base-
ball  Partners  LLC,  627 
S.W.3d 398 (Tex. App.—Hou-
ston  [14th  Dist.]  2021),  pet. 
granted  (June  3,  2022)  [21-
0641] 

This case addresses whether the 
Texas  Citizens  Participation  Act 
(TCPA) applies to claims for fraud, civil 
conspiracy,  and  breach-of-contract 
stemming  from  the  sale  of  a  major 
sports network.  

In 2003, the Houston Astros and 
Houston  Rockets  formed  the  Houston 
Regional  Sports  Network  to  broadcast 
games  to  viewers  in  Houston  and  the 
surrounding  area.    In  2010,  Comcast 

149 
 

purchased  an  equity  interest  in  the 
Network and signed an affiliate agree-
ment  in  which  it  agreed  to  distribute 
Network  programming  to  all  Comcast 
subscribers in exchange for an “affiliate 
fee.”  The  premise  behind  the  parties’ 
business  plan was  the  Network would 
sign similar agreements with other dis-
tributors for the same rates. In Novem-
ber  2011,  Jim  Crane  and  his  affiliate, 
Houston Baseball Partners (HBP), pur-
chased the Astros and their interest in 
the  Network.  The  Network  ultimately 
became  insolvent.  In  September  2013, 
Comcast  filed  an  involuntary  bank-
ruptcy  petition  against  the  Network. 
HBP  subsequently  sued  McLane  (the 
Astros’  former  owner),  Comcast,  and 
their affiliates for fraud, negligent mis-
representation, and civil conspiracy. It 
also  sued  McLane’s  affiliate,  Champi-
ons, for breach-of-contract and sought a 
declaratory judgment regarding Cham-
pions’ 
obligations. 
that  Comcast  and 
HBP  claimed 
McLane made two sets of material mis-
representations  when  HBP  was  con-
ducting due diligence prior to purchas-
ing the Network: (1) that Comcast be-
lieved the affiliate rates were “reasona-
ble” and “achievable,” and (2) Comcast, 
rather than the Astros, proposed the af-
filiate rates.   

indemnification 

Comcast  removed  the  case  to 
federal court where the bankruptcy ac-
tion was pending. After abating the ac-
tion  for  five  years,  the  bankruptcy 
court  remanded  the  case.  On  remand, 
McLane  filed  a  TCPA  motion  to  dis-
miss,  which  Comcast  joined.  The  trial 
court  denied  McLane  and  Comcast’s 
TCPA motion, and they filed an inter-
locutory  appeal.  The  court  of  appeals 
affirmed.  First,  it  held  that  even

tion 

a)  Winstead PC v. USA Lending 
Grp., Inc., 2021 WL 1047208 
(Tex. App.—Tyler 2021), pet. 
granted  (Feb.  24,  2023)  [21-
0437] 

At  issue  in  this  case is  whether 
the  Texas  Citizens  Participation  Act 
applies to legal malpractice claims.  

Winstead 

represented  USA 
Lending in its suit against a former em-
ployee  and  obtained  a  default  judg-
ment.  After  the  court  entered  a  final 
judgment,  USA  Lending  discovered 
that  Winstead  had  failed  to  request 
damages in its motion for default judg-
ment. USA Lending sued Winstead for 
legal  malpractice,  alleging  that  Win-
stead’s 
to  seek  damages 
breached  the  applicable  standard  of 
care  and  resulted  in  a  loss  of  over 
$1,000,000. Winstead filed a motion to 
dismiss  under  the  TCPA,  which  the 
trial court denied.  

failure 

The  court  of  appeals  reversed, 
holding  that  the  TCPA  applied  to  the 
claim, the Act’s commercial-speech ex-
emption did not apply, and USA Lend-
ing  did  not  provide  clear  and  specific 
evidence  of  causation.  The  court  then 
remanded  the  case  to  the  trial  court 
with instructions to dismiss.  

USA Lending filed a petition for 
review,  asserting  that  its  malpractice 
claim is not based on or in response to 
Winstead’s  “communications,”  as  the 
TCPA requires, but instead is based on 
Winstead’s  failure  to  communicate. 
USA Lending also argues that, even if 
the  TCPA  applied,  USA  Lending  has 
presented sufficient evidence of causa-
tion and damages to survive the motion 
to dismiss.  

though  HBP  had  assigned  “all  of  [its] 
rights  under  the 
[Purchase  Sales 
Agreement]” to its affiliate prior to the 
sale, it still had standing to sue. Next, 
it held that the trial court did not err in 
denying Comcast and McLane’s motion 
to  dismiss.  It  assumed  without  decid-
ing  that  the  TCPA  applied  to  HBP’s 
claims.  However,  it  held  HBP  met  its 
burden to establish the prima facie ele-
ments for all its claims. 

Comcast and McLane petitioned 
the  Supreme  Court  for  review.    First, 
they argue that HBP lacks standing to 
sue because it assigned all its claims to 
Holdings.  Second,  they  argue  that  the 
court  of  appeals  erred  in  holding  that 
HBP  established  its  prima  facie  case 
for 
its  tort  and  breach-of-contract 
claims. Among other things, they argue 
that  (1)  the  alleged  misrepresentation 
that  Comcast  proposed  the  affiliate 
rates  is  not  material,  (2)  the  alleged 
misrepresentation  that  the  affiliate 
rates  were  “reasonable”  and  “achieva-
ble” is a non-actionable opinion or pre-
diction, and (3) regardless, HBP did not 
establish its justifiable reliance on the 
alleged  misrepresentations.  Finally, 
they  argue  that  the  TCPA  applies  to 
HBP’s  claims  because  they  implicate 
Comcast’s  and  McLane’s  exercises  of 
the  rights  of  free  speech  and  associa-
tion.  The  Supreme  Court  granted  the 
petition for review.

ingredient used in other herbicides be-
sides  Sendero.  The  farmers  harvested 
or plowed under the damaged crop. 

The  farmers  sued  Helena  for 
two-years-worth  of  damage  to  111 
fields  in  total,  pleading  negligence, 
gross negligence, negligence per se, and 
trespass.  They  engaged  expert  wit-
nesses  to  address  causation.  Helena 
moved to strike the expert testimony as 
unreliable and filed a no-evidence mo-
tion  for  summary  judgment,  arguing 
there  was  no  evidence  that  Sendero 
from  Helena  caused  the  alleged  dam-
age.  The  trial  court  granted  both  mo-
tions. The court of appeals reversed in 
part,  holding  that  most  of  the  expert 
testimony  was  reliable,  and  that  it, 
along with the state inspection and test 
results, constituted sufficient evidence 
to raise a fact issue as to causation.  

Helena  filed  a  petition  for  re-
view.  Helena  argues  that  the  farmers 
failed  to  link  the  damage  to  Helena’s 
application because they insufficiently 
ruled  out  alternative  causes.  In  addi-
tion,  Helena  argues  that  the  farmers 
failed  to  present  evidence  of  dose-spe-
cific exposure to each of their 111 alleg-
edly  damaged  fields,  and  that  such  a 
showing is required in order to survive 
summary  judgment.  Finally,  Helena 
argues that the causation experts’ opin-
ions  are  unreliable  because  they  are 
based on speculation.  

The  Supreme  Court  granted 

Helena’s petition for review.

In  contrast,  Winstead  argues 
that  USA  Lending’s  claim  is  rooted  in 
Winstead’s deficient motion for default 
judgment,  which  qualifies  as  a  “com-
munication.”  Moreover,  Winstead  con-
tends  that  the  commercial-speech  ex-
emption  does  not  apply  and  that USA 
Lending  has  not  presented  clear  and 
specific  evidence  to  establish  a  prima 
facie case for its claim. 

The Supreme Court granted the 

petition for review.

630 S.W.3d 234 (Tex. App.—
Eastland  2020),  pet.  granted 
(May 27, 2022) [20-0881] 
The issue in this case is whether 
the  plaintiff–farmers  presented  suffi-
cient reliable evidence to survive a no-
evidence  motion  for  summary  judg-
ment  that  herbicide  from  the  defend-
ant’s aerial application caused their al-
leged injuries.  

Helena  arranged  for  a  large-
scale  aerial  application  of  a  mesquite 
herbicide  called  Sendero.  Sendero  is 
known  to  cause  damage  to  cotton 
plants.  After  this  application,  cotton 
farmers upwind of the application site 
reported  crop  damage.  A  state  inspec-
tor  traced  the  damage  to  Helena’s  ap-
plication. Test results from some of the 
fields  indicated  exposure  to  one  of 
ingredients—an

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
