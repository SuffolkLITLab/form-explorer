      <pre>Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 
 
Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 
 

APPEAL NO.: 

11-001 

ESPONDENT: 

State Bar of Texas 

ATE: 

 

March 8, 2011 

 

 

 

PECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge  Stephen  B.  Ables,  Chairman;  Judge  Olen  Underwood; 
Judge David Peeples; Judge Dean Rucker; Judge Jeff Walker

Petitioner requested a copy of approximately 63,000 attorney e-mail addresses from the State 

Bar of Texas (the State Bar or Respondent) that had been released previously to another requestor.    
Respondent  requested an opinion from  the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) regarding its 
authority to release the requested e-mail addresses under Chapter 552 of the Government Code 
(commonly referred to as the “Public Information Act”).  Respondent was unsure whether it was still 
authorized to release the e-mail addresses that had previously been released because, subsequent to 
that  release,  many  attorneys  chose  to  restrict  public  access  to  this  information  under  Section 
552.1176, Texas Government Code (Confidentiality of Certain Information Maintained by State 
Bar).  The OAG decision required Respondent to withhold the requested attorney e-mail addresses 
except for those belonging to government attorneys who did not elect to restrict public access to their 
e-mail addresses under Section 552.1176, Texas Government Code.  Respondent provided the e-mail 
addresses it could release to Petitioner and withheld the rest.  Petitioner has appealed Respondent‟s 
denial of access to the e-mail addresses arguing that they are subject to Rule 12, not the Public 
Information Act, and that Rule 12 does not exempt them from disclosure. 

e first address whether Rule 12 applies to the records at issue in this appeal.  Rule 12 
defines a “judicial agency” as “an office, board, commission or other similar entity that is in the 
Judicial  Department  and  that  serves  an  administrative  function  for  a  court.”    Rule  12.2(b).    A 
“judicial record” under Rule 12 is “a record made or maintained by or for a court or judicial agency 
in  its  regular  course  of  business  but  not  pertaining  to  its  adjudicative function.”  Rule 12.2(d).  
Section 81.011 of the Government Code provides that the State Bar is an administrative agency of 
the judicial department; and the State Bar maintains membership records, including attorney e-mail 
addresses, for the Supreme Court under Section 81.029(c) of the Government Code.  Thus, the State 
Bar is a judicial agency and the requested e-mail addresses fall within the definition of judicial 
records that are subject to Rule 12.   Section 81.033 of the Government Code, however, specifically 
makes the State Bar and its records subject to Chapter 552 of the Government Code, and Rule 12 
does not apply to records to which access is controlled by Chapter 552 of the Government Code or 
another statute or provision of law.  See Rule 12.3(a)(4).  Further, in Comment Number 1 to Rule 12, 
the Supreme Court specifically mentioned the inapplicability of Rule 12 to the State Bar.  Comment 
1 reads in pertinent part: 

  W

 

 

 

 

 

in  Rule  12.2(b) 

the  definition  of  “judicial  agency” 

      Although 
is 
comprehensive, applicability of the rule is restricted by Rule 12.3.  The rule does 
not  apply  to  judicial  agencies  whose  records  are  expressly  made  subject  to 
disclosure  by  statute,  rule,  or  law.    An  example  is  the  State  Bar  (“an 
administrative agency of the judicial department”, Tex Gov‟t Code §81.011(a)), 
which is subject to the Public Information Act.  Tex. Gov‟t Code §81.033.  Thus, 
no judicial agency must comply with both the Act and this rule; at most one can 
apply. 

t is this Committee‟s opinion that this comment was added to prevent a situation such as the 
one presented in this appeal: a judicial agency having to determine whether the Public Information 
Act, Rule 12 or both apply to some or all of its records.   

etitioner cites Abbott v. State Bar of Texas, 241 S.W.3d 604 (Tex. App.-Austin 2007, pet. 
denied) in support of his position that attorney membership records are covered under Rule 12.  The 
Abbott  case  addressed  the  applicability  of  the  Public  Information  Act  to  attorney  membership 
records, including home addresses and telephone numbers, maintained by the State Bar. 1  The Abbott 
court suggested that Rule 12 might apply and held that access to the membership information at issue 
was “not governed by the Public Information Act, but by „rules adopted by the Supreme Court of 
Texas or by other applicable laws and rules‟ pursuant to section 552.0035.” 2   

e respectfully decline to follow the Abbott decision for the following reasons.  First, Abbott 
did not consider the comment to Rule 12, quoted above, in which the Supreme Court said that the 
State Bar‟s records are governed by the Public Information Act and not by Rule 12.  Also, Abbott 
was issued prior to the effective dates of both Section 552.1176 of the Government Code, which 
specifically addresses the confidentiality of membership records maintained by the State Bar, and the 
2008 amendments to Article III, Section 2 of the State Bar Rules regarding attorney membership 
information.  In a note to the amended Article III, Section 2, the Supreme Court states that Section 
552.1176 of the Government Code prescribes the confidentiality of certain membership information 
maintained by the State Bar. 
 

Accordingly, we find that Rule 12 does not apply to the membership records of the State Bar 
and this committee can neither grant the petition in whole or in part nor sustain the denial of access 
to the requested records.

1 E-mail addresses were not at issue in the Abbott case and they were not included in the list of membership 
information that the State Bar was required to maintain under the version of Article III, Section 2 of the State Bar 
Rules that was in effect at the time the Abbott decision was issued. 
2 Section 552.0035(a) provides that “access to information collected, assembled or maintained by or for the judiciary 
is governed by rules adopted by the Supreme Court of Texas or by other applicable laws and rules.”
