Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 

ESPONDENT: 

Travis County Justices of the Peace - Precincts 1, 4 and 5 

ATE: 

 

May 12, 2015 

PECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge  Stephen  B.  Ables,  Chairman;  Judge  Olen  Underwood; 
Judge David Peeples; Judge Dean Rucker; Judge Kelly G. Moore  

etitioner requested from Travis County’s Precinct 1, 2, 4, and 5 justice of the peace courts 
the number of truancy cases filed annually by Austin Independent School District (AISD) in those 
courts against parents and students over the past five years.  Petitioner also requested documents in 
those  cases  that  involved  parents  and  non-juvenile  students.    In  one  of  the  exchanges  between 
Petitioner  and  one  of  the  Respondents,  Petitioner  clarified  that  she  would  like  “the  number  of 
truancy cases filed in their courts for the last five years against juvenile students, non-juvenile 
students and parents.” Petitioner states that the Precinct 2 court responded to her request.  At the 
time she submitted her petition, Petitioner had not heard from the Precinct 1 court, though more than 
14 days had elapsed since she had submitted her request, and her request was denied by the Precinct 
4 and 5 courts.  In their denial letter, Respondents indicated that the number of truancy cases filed 
could be obtained from the Office of Court Administration’s website.  Petitioner then appealed.   

n their response to this appeal Respondents state that the Travis County Attorney’s Office 
responded  to  Petitioner  on  behalf  of  the  courts  explaining  that  the  information  requested  was 
information created, produced, or filed in connection with matters before the courts and were not 
judicial records subject to Rule 12.  Respondents also argue that even if the records are subject to 
Rule 12, they “do not have a system formatted to run this particular information” and “the courts do 
not keep track of cases specifically filed by AISD for truancy.”  They also state that retrieving this 
information would require the courts to “manually review each file, which would cause an undue 
burden on the courts’ resources and unreasonably impede normal operations of the courts” and they 
assert that Rule 12 does not require the courts to “create a record, other than to print information 
stored in a computer.”     

he  threshold  issue  in  a  Rule  12  appeal  is  whether  the  requested  records  are  “judicial 

records,” which are defined by Rule 12.2(d) as follows:   

Judicial record means a record made or maintained by or for a court or judicial agency in its 
regular course of business but not pertaining to its adjudicative function, regardless of whether that 
function relates to a specific case.  A record of any nature created, produced, or filed in connection 
with any matter that is or has been before a court is not a judicial record.”  (Emphasis added.)

Petitioner’s  request  for  documents  related  to  cases  involving  parents  and  non-juvenile 
defendants is a request for records made and maintained by a court that pertain to its adjudicative 
function; the records pertain to matters that have been or will be before a court.  As such, they are 
not judicial records under Rule 12.2(d), and are not subject to Rule 12.  Rule 12 Decision No. 03-
005.  

We note, however, that though we find that these records are not “judicial records” within the 
meaning of Rule 12, they may be open pursuant to other law such as the common-law right to public 
access.  See Rule 12 Decisions 00-001 and 00-003.  We also note that the primary significance of a 
decision finding that a record is not subject to Rule 12 is that the Rule 12 procedures for responding 
to requests and appealing the denial of requests do not apply.  Neither the fact that a record is not 
subject  to  Rule  12  nor  a  decision  making  this  determination  should  be  used  as  a  basis  for 
withholding records. 

We next address Petitioner’s request for the number of truancy cases filed annually by AISD. 
 After engaging in a discussion with Respondents regarding this portion of her request, Petitioner 
later clarified and limited her request to the “number of truancy cases filed in their courts for the last 
five years against juvenile students, non-juvenile students and parents” without regard to whether 
they  were  filed  by  AISD.    Respondents  noted  in  their  reply  to  Petitioner’s  request,  that  this 
information was available on OCA’s website. 

Respondents are correct that this information is collected by OCA.1  It is collected from all of 
the justice courts in the state as required by rules promulgated by the Texas Judicial Council.  Thus, 
assuming the courts have filed the necessary reports with OCA, the courts should have records that 
contain the number of truancy cases filed in each court.  Respondents argue that this information is 
also related to the courts’ adjudicative functions and is not subject to Rule 12; we disagree.  Records 
created by the courts and their clerks for the purpose of reporting aggregate statistical information to 
OCA do not pertain to the courts’ adjudicative functions, the process by which they decide cases.  
Neither are they created, produced or filed in connection with matters that are or have been before a 
court.  Accordingly, we find that the records created by the courts to submit to OCA indicating the 
number  of  truancy  cases  filed  in  each  court  are  subject  to  Rule  12  and  are  not  exempt  from 
disclosure. 

egarding the documents that we have determined are not subject to Rule 12, we are without 
authority to grant the petition or sustain the denial of access to these records.  To the extent that the 
reports submitted to OCA regarding justice court activity exist and contain the requested information 
regarding the number of truancy cases filed in each court, they are subject to Rule 12 and are not 
exempt from disclosure. Accordingly, the petition is granted in regards to disclosure of records that 
contain this information.
