Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

Executive Summary 

The  87th  Texas  Legislature  charged  the  Department  of  Family  and  Protective  Services  (DFPS)  and  the 
Supreme  Court  of  Texas  Permanent  Judicial  Commission  for  Children,  Youth  and  Families  (Children’s 
Commission) with the tasks of evaluating the use of the Forensic Assessment Center Network (FACN) and 
developing  recommendations  for  further  improvement.  To  ensure  a  full  evaluation,  DFPS  and  the 
Children’s Commission invited parents who had experience with the FACN, along with child and family 
advocates,  Child  Abuse  Pediatricians,  other  pediatric  specialists,  judges,  and  attorneys  who  represent 
parents, children, or DFPS to share their experiences.  

DFPS  relies  on  the  FACN  to  provide  evaluations  by  medical  specialists  of  children  who  may  have 
experienced abuse or neglect. Given the significant impact that DFPS involvement can have on a family, 
this report recognizes the need to have additional guidance and transparency for all those who may be 
involved with the FACN.  

After  holding  a  Listening  Session  and  Round  Table  meeting,  DFPS  and  the  Children’s  Commission 
developed a list of joint recommendations. Although the FACN is a valuable resource to DFPS, DFPS and 
the  Children’s  Commission  identified  areas  where  the  FACN  contract  can  be  improved  and  expanded; 
where resources can be developed; where training can be provided; where data and information sharing 
can be improved; and where global system improvements can be made.  

Contract: The Listening Session and Round Table identified the need to require standardized and detailed 
information in the FACN report that supports the determination. 

Resources: The Listening Session and Round Table identified the need for additional support to families, 
child welfare professionals, and medical specialists in cases involving the use of the FACN in the following 
ways:  

•  Create a DFPS specialist position at the state or regional level focused on complex medical cases.1 
•  Explore the creation of a uniform protocol for DFPS investigations involving allegations of child 

abuse or neglect in complex medical cases. 

•  Clarify the roles of the DFPS Child Protective Investigator and the FACN specialists. 
•  Create and utilize a medical resource form for parents to complete that includes clarifying medical 

information for DFPS during an investigation. 

•  Explore a blind review process of FACN determinations from an outside medical team. 
• 
•  Clearly articulate to parents what their rights are during a DFPS investigation when the FACN is 

Improve communication between parents, DFPS, and all medical professionals. 

involved. 

•  Provide clear guidance about the administrative review process and expungement of records. 

Training:  The  Listening  Session  and  Round  Table  identified  areas  where  additional  training  would  be 
beneficial to aid in the transparency and accuracy of a DFPS investigation when the FACN is involved. The 
following audiences would benefit from additional training on these topics: 

•  DFPS staff 

o  Provide clear guidance for DFPS investigations in complex medical cases.  
o  Consider  second  opinions  in  complex  medical  cases  and  obtain  second  opinions  as 

appropriate.

(87th Leg. Session). 

Data  and  Information  Sharing:  Listening  Session  and  Round  Table  identified  that  data  collection  and 
information  sharing  are  each  critical  components  to  the  child  welfare  system.  The  following 
recommendations were developed to support better outcomes for children and families: 

•  Establish uniform data collection and analysis practices, including collecting information by FACN 

case type. 

•  Support  case  management  continuity  and  coordinated  transfers  of  cases  including  increasing 

communication between the FACN Specialists, DFPS, and families. 
 

System Improvement: The Listening Session and Round Table identified related recommendations that 
would strengthen the child welfare community; the following broader concerns about the child welfare 
system should be considered: 

•  Expand availability of mandated reporter training. 
•  During Family Team Meetings with DFPS, ensure that a decisionmaker is present so families can 

leave with a plan. 

•  Provide a climate where children and families are served in a trauma-informed manner. 
•  Encourage jurisdictions to establish pre-petition legal representation programs. 
•  Explore state, regional or local programs that offer support through parent advocates, mentors, 

• 

or other support programs for parents going through the child welfare process. 
Identify opportunities to increase parental access to experts. 
 

These  recommendations  aim  to  better  align  policy  with  practice  and  ensure  transparency  and 
accountability for complex medical cases involving DFPS investigations.

Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

Charge 

Background 

In 2021, the 87th Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill (SB) 1578, which amended the Texas Family Code 
regarding the use of Forensic Assessment Center Network (FACN) consultations by Department of Family 
and  Protective  Services  (DFPS)  in  making  determinations  relating  to  the  abuse  or  neglect  of  a  child.2 
Additionally, SB 1578 tasked DFPS, with the assistance of the Children’s Commission, to evaluate DFPS’ 
use of the network and develop recommendations for further improvement.3 Through a Listening Session 
with parents and a Round Table with stakeholders representing multiple perspectives and jurisdictions 
throughout  Texas,  the  Children’s  Commission  and  DFPS  aimed  to  document  current  gaps  and  identify 
areas  to  strengthen  communication  and  transparency  for  families  as  well  as  to  support  safety, 
permanency, and well-being for children.  

In this report, the term “complex medical cases” refers to cases that mimic child abuse or neglect which 
include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  physical  abuse  or  medical  neglect  by  the  parent  (formally  referred  to 
Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy). The term is used throughout the report in direct reference to DFPS 
investigations with referrals to the Forensic Assessment Center Network. 

History of FACN 

In 2005, the 79th Texas Legislature passed SB 6 which created the FACN as a joint effort between DFPS 
and the University of Texas Health Science Center (UTHSC) – Houston.4 Prior to the creation of the FACN, 
DFPS did not have regular access to physicians trained in pediatrics, trauma, or forensics, particularly in 
rural areas. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC), DFPS, health care professionals, 
and  child  welfare  professionals  collaborated  to  design  the  FACN  as  a  comprehensive,  cost-effective 
medical services delivery model  which  would  better allow the  needs of children  served  by DFPS to  be 
met.5 On September 1, 2005, FACN was approved for appropriation.6 

Consistent with SB 6, the current contract between DFPS and UTHSC-Houston is in effect from September 
1, 2019 to August 31, 2024 and it outlines the use of the FACN.7 The purpose of the contract is to support 
DFPS, through access to medical professionals, in making decisions relating to the presence or absence of 
child  abuse  or  neglect.8  The  goals  of  the  contract  are  to  provide  statewide  access  to  forensic  medical 
consultation services to DFPS staff, expert testimony regarding child abuse or neglect diagnoses in DFPS 
cases, and ongoing statewide training on the medical aspects of abuse and neglect to DFPS staff and others 
identified by DFPS.9  

The current contract requires UTHSC-Houston to:  

•  Provide case consultations and written assessments in response to referrals by DFPS;  

•  Provide expert testimony regarding the assessments as requested by DFPS;  

•  Develop and deliver training to DFPS staff;  

•  Maintain a peer review process for physicians;  

•  Submit monthly reports; and  

•  Provide  ongoing  operations,  maintenance,  and  performance  improvement  of  the  FACN  web-

based system.10

Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

The specialists utilized by the FACN are healthcare providers who are independently licensed to diagnose 
and  treat  medical  conditions  in  the  state  of  Texas  (e.g.,  nurse  practitioner,  physician,  or  physician’s 
assistant). Additionally, FACN specialists are certified in pediatrics by a nationally recognized board; have 
received  additional  training  in  child  abuse  and  neglect,  beyond  general  pediatric  training;  regularly 
evaluate children for alleged abuse or neglect as part of a routine pediatric practice; and are either board-
certified in child abuse pediatrics by the American Board of Pediatrics, or are supervised by a certified 
Child  Abuse  Pediatrician  (CAP).11  At  a  minimum, supervision  constitutes  shared  participation  or  timely 
review of all cases involving serious bodily injury and/or hospitalization.12  

To become certified in child abuse pediatrics, the American Board of Pediatrics requires validly licensed 
physicians to complete three years of full-time fellowship training in an accredited program or part-time 
training over no more than six years.13 The physician must satisfy a scholarly activity requirement during 
their fellowship and pass the subspecialty certifying examination.14 As of March 2021, twenty-two CAPs 
were  certified  by  the  American  Board  of  Pediatrics  in  Texas,  the  equivalent  of  0.3  subspecialists  per 
100,000 Texas children.15 As explained below, not all CAPs are part of the FACN.  

To ensure the  FACN  covers  the  entire  state,  UTHSC-Houston  subcontracted  with  five  medical  facilities 
across Texas, including UTHSC-San Antonio, UT-Southwestern, UT-Medical Branch, Texas Tech University, 
and  UT-Austin  Dell  Medical  School.  UTHSC-Houston  obtained  prior  written  consent  from  DFPS  before 
procuring and subcontracting to these entities.16 Subcontractors must accept and abide by all terms and 
conditions imposed on UTHSC-Houston in the original contract between UTHSC-Houston and DFPS.17 

Referral Process 

The  FACN  receives  referrals  from  DFPS  staff.  DFPS  may  make  a  referral  to  the  FACN  when  additional 
clarification on abuse or neglect cases is needed to address child safety decisions or to ask general ongoing 
medical questions.18 Pursuant to DFPS policy,  DFPS must make a referral to the FACN in the following 
circumstances: 

•  There does not appear to be any reasonable explanation for a child’s injury, or the explanation is 

not consistent with the injury. 

•  A child requires an in-person forensic assessment examination. 

•  The caseworker needs assistance to determine whether abuse or neglect occurred. 

•  There  is  a  difference  of  opinion  between  a  medical  professional  and  DFPS  regarding  whether 
abuse or neglect occurred, or about the seriousness of an injury or condition, and clarification is 
needed. 

•  There is evidence of medical child abuse (also known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy). 

•  The caseworker has a question about abuse or neglect that a medical professional may be able to 

clarify. 

•  A child younger than 11 years old has a Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD), and there is not a 

preponderance of evidence that abuse led to the STD.19  

•  Near-fatality cases when the treating physician is not a child abuse pediatrician.20

Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

When DFPS staff refers a case to the FACN, their requests can be made via a telephone service or via a 
web-based submission, both of which are available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.21 Under 
the contract, there are three types of referrals, each with a corresponding timeline within which the FACN 
specialist  must  complete  the  consultation  and  provide  the  written  assessment.  A  routine  referral 
constitutes  any  referral  that  is  not  an  emergency  or  complex  referral.22  For  these  referrals,  the  FACN 
specialist has seven calendar days from the time of receipt of adequate case information to complete the 
assessment.23  An  emergency  referral,  as  determined  by  DFPS  staff,  requires  a  shorter  response  time. 
These referrals require FACN specialists to complete their assessment within three calendar days.24 Finally, 
a complex referral involves voluminous information.25 For these referrals, DFPS and FACN specialists are 
to mutually agree on an acceptable time period.26 

When making the referral, DFPS staff upload any documentation they collect for the FACN specialist to 
review into the web-based system made accessible to both DFPS and FACN staff. The documentation may 
include photographs, medical documentation, lab reports, information about the victim, statements from 
the alleged perpetrator and witnesses, and the DFPS intake.27 Upon review, the FACN specialists perform 
any of the following actions: 

•  Provide their written assessment based upon the documentation provided;  

•  Request  an  in-person  medical  evaluation  for  the  child  either  in  the  Emergency  Room  (ER)  or 

through a clinic appointment; or  

•  Recommend a specialty consultation with medical experts who have training in identifying unique 
health  conditions,  many  of  which  manifest  symptoms  similar  to  those  of  abuse  or  neglect  or 
otherwise increase the risk of misdiagnosis.28 

Upon  completion  of  either  the  medical  evaluation  or  specialty  consultation,  the  FACN  specialist  can 
complete  the  consultation  and  provide  a  written  assessment.  Notably,  a  FACN  consultation  and 
assessment may be done without an in-person medical evaluation of the child.  

Physicians  can  also  refer  cases  to  the  FACN.29  This  occurs  when  a  child  is  hospitalized  or  there  is  an 
outpatient referral from a physician, and abuse or neglect is suspected. The referring physician, often part 
of the Emergency Room team or the primary care team, can request to consult with the FACN specialists. 
For this type of referral, FACN specialists must provide their written assessments within three calendar 
days of a child being seen at a hospital or clinic.30  

The  written  assessment  is  the  final  product  resulting  from  the  referral  and  case  consultation  and  is 
uploaded  into  the  web-based  system  for  DFPS  staff  to  review.  The  assessment  consists  of  the  FACN 
specialist’s  opinion  as  to  whether  the  physical  injury  or  condition  resulted  from  or  was  likely  to  have 
resulted  from  abuse  or  neglect  of  a  child.31  While  the  FACN  specialist  can  make  various  findings, 
“substantial” and “concerning” are the two most “significant” determinations regarding abuse or neglect, 
also referred to as maltreatment: 

•  Substantial – Based on the medical evidence and information provided for the case, the finding(s) 

cannot be reasonably explained by anything other than maltreatment. 

•  Concerning – There is concern for maltreatment based on the medical evidence and information 

provided.32 

 

 

 

6 

Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

When the cause of the injury or illness is less clear, the FACN specialist may make the following finding: 

•  Non-specific  –  May  result  from  maltreatment,  but  accidental/natural  explanations  are  also 

possible.33 

The FACN specialist  may  also  choose one of the following  other  determinations in lieu of  a  statement 
regarding the likelihood of abuse or neglect: 

• 

Insufficient information available, therefore unable to determine whether child was abused or 
neglected. 

•  No allegation of abuse or neglect (physician consulted for a non-maltreatment question). 

•  No evidence of maltreatment, or an explanation other than abuse or neglect is likely. 

•  At risk for maltreatment.34 

The FACN determination is one component of a DFPS investigation.  When making a disposition at the end 
of  an  investigation,  DFPS  considers  the  FACN  determinations  in  addition  to  other  investigative 
information.  These  DFPS  dispositions  include  finding  that  there  is  reason  to  believe  abuse  or  neglect 
occurred, that the allegations are unable to be determined, that the allegations are ruled out, or that the 
investigation was unable to be completed.35 

Other Contract Requirements 

Beyond their commitment to providing case consultations and written assessments, by contract the FACN 
specialists provide expert testimony in civil court cases  upon DFPS’ request, either via telephone or in 
person.36 Additionally, UTHSC-Houston and subcontractors offer ongoing training to meet the needs of 
DFPS staff. The requisite training consists of a continuously posted online training concerning how to use 
the FACN web-based system, as well as one face-to-face training organized by DFPS in each of the eleven 
DFPS regions. FACN specialists can also provide up to eleven additional in-person or webinar trainings per 
year as requested by DFPS. Further, UTHSC-Houston maintains a peer review process for FACN specialists 
to  help  physicians  come  to  a  consensus  when  they  disagree  about  an  abuse  or  neglect  diagnosis.37 
Currently, the network utilizes a monthly review process in which 10% of all completed cases from that 
month are randomly assigned to a reviewer from a different institution. On average, this consists of 35-
40 cases being reviewed each month. The performance measures obtained from this process are reported 
to DFPS. 

The  FACN  network  submits  monthly  reports  to  the  Child  Protective  Investigations  (CPI),  Child  Care 
Licensing (CCL), and Purchased Client Services (PCS) State Office Liaisons. These monthly reports include 
a  list  of  activities  categorized  by  DFPS  programs  completed  during  the  previous  month,  including  the 
following: 

•  Total number of referrals received;  

•  Timeliness of the referrals; 

•  Total number of written assessments provided;

•  Total number of regional case consultations; 

•  Dates and locations where expert testimony was provided; 

•  Dates and locations where trainings were held; 

•  Any identified training needs for DFPS staff, as well as the dates, locations, and method of delivery 

of regional case consultations and trainings;  

•  Number of presentations or trainings regarding the FACN network provided by special request; 

•  Type of abuse or neglect involved for all of the FACN referrals; 

•  A report regarding client services; and  

•  Aggregate data regarding the statewide peer review process.  

UTHSC-Houston  also  provides  quarterly  reports  to  DFPS  which  are  made  available  via  the  web-based 
system and discussed during quarterly meetings between DFPS and UTHSC-Houston. The quarterly reports 
contain all the information contained in the monthly reports for that quarter. 

The following data highlight information exchanged regarding the use of the FACN. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, 
DFPS referred 5,368 (3%) of their 154,593 total investigations to the FACN. Of the cases referred to the 
FACN, the following determinations were made: 12% substantial, 41% concerning, and 22% non-specific. 
The  remaining  26%  received  a  determination  of  other,  which  included  no  evidence  of  maltreatment, 
insufficient information available, at risk, or no allegation of abuse or neglect.38

of investigations resulted in removal, 12% resulted in family preservation, and 84% were closed. Overall, 
11% of cases that received a determination from the FACN resulted in removal of a child.  

Legislation 

Legal Framework 

SB 1578 took effect on September 1, 2021 and changed multiple aspects of the FACN. In response, DFPS 
and UTHSC-Houston worked to update their practices accordingly. DFPS and UTHSC-Houston are drafting 
a new contract, to be effective from FY 25-FY 30. The new contract is intended to continue the relationship 
between DFPS and UTHSC-Houston as well as to include updated requirements in the Texas Family Code. 

Under Texas Family Code § 261.30175, a health care practitioner who reports suspected abuse or neglect 
of  a  child  cannot  provide  DFPS  with  forensic  assessment  services  in  connection  with  an  investigation 
resulting from the report.41 Therefore, if a member of the FACN makes a report of abuse or neglect, the 
same practitioner cannot provide the FACN evaluation and determination. This legislative change will be 
reflected in the updated contract and stipulate that when any physician or specialist makes a report of 
abuse or neglect to DFPS, a different FACN physician or specialist must complete the forensic assessment 
or case consultation. 

The  Texas  Family  Code  as  amended  also  changed  the  way  specialty  consultations  can  be  obtained.42 
Although the FACN specialists can recommend a specialty consultation and explain the benefits, only DFPS 
can  refer  the  child’s  case  for  a  specialty  consultation.43  DFPS  must  refer  a  child’s  case  for  a  specialty 
consultation if the  department  determines the child requires it;  the child’s parent or legal  guardian or 
their attorney requests it; or the child‘s primary care physician, or other primary health care provider who 
delivered  health  care,  treatment,  or  otherwise  evaluated  the  child,  recommends  it.44  The  specialty 
consultation cannot be conducted by the original reporter of suspected abuse or neglect.45 These changes 
will be reflected in the updated contract between DFPS and UTHSC-Houston. 

Before  making  a  referral  for  a  specialty  consultation,  DFPS  must  provide  the  child's  parent  or  legal 
guardian, or their attorney, as applicable, written notice of the name, credentials, and contact information 
of the specialist.46 The child’s parent or legal guardian, or their attorney, as applicable, may object to the 
referral and request an alternative specialist. DFPS staff must collaborate with the parent, legal guardian, 

 

9 

Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

or attorney in good faith to select an acceptable specialist.47 However, if necessary, DFPS may refer the 
case to a specialist licensed to practice medicine in Texas over the objection of the parent, legal guardian, 
or attorney.48 

Further,  Texas  Family  Code  §  261.3017(e)  specifies  that  the  parent,  legal  guardian,  or  attorney  of  the 
parent or legal guardian can obtain a second opinion from a physician or other health care provider of 
their choice at their own initiative and expense.49 DFPS must accept and consider this alternative opinion, 
also referred to as a second opinion, as well as document its analysis and determinations regarding the 
opinion.  

Scope of the FACN 

The following entities participate in the Forensic Assessment Center Network: UT Houston: CARE Center; 
UT Southwest: REACH Program; UT Health Science Center at San Antonio: Center for Miracles; UT Medical 
Branch  at  Galveston:  ABC  Center;  Texas  Tech  University:  Pediatric  C.A.R.E  Center;  and  Dell  Children’s 
Medical Center. Each entity in the FACN has a team of medical professionals who evaluate cases involving 
suspected abuse or neglect. Each team has at least one physician who is experienced in evaluating and 
treating cases of child abuse or neglect, though not every team has a physician who is board certified in 
child abuse pediatrics.50 Teams sizes range from one to five physicians.51 FACN teams may also include 
various other medical professionals, such as general pediatrics, nurse practitioners, pediatric fellows, child 
and adolescent psychiatrists, clinical nurse specialists, social workers, project analysts, clinical program 
managers,  and  Sexual  Assault  Nurse  Examiner  (SANE)  coordinators.  Each  team  includes  a  site 
coordinator.52  

DFPS has a contractual relationship with the FACN, which allows the department to make requests to any 
medical  provider  associated  with  FACN.53  However,  the  contract  does  not  limit  DFPS’  ability  to  make 
requests to any medical provider outside the network. 

It is important to note that FACN specialists and CAPs are not the same. Not all pediatric specialists who 
are part of the FACN are CAPs and not all Texas CAPs are part of the FACN. The FACN has specific contracts 
with the medical facilities listed above, and a limited number of pediatric specialists at those facilities are 
part of the FACN.   

MEDCARES 

In 2009, the 81st Texas Legislature passed SB 2080 and created the Texas Medical Child Abuse Resources 
and Education System (MEDCARES) grant program in order to develop and support regional initiatives for 
the improvement of services and scholarly activity related to the assessment, diagnosis, prevention and 
treatment of child abuse and neglect.54 The Department of State Health Services, through MEDCARES, 
awarded  grants  to  hospitals  or  academic  health  centers  with  expertise  in  pediatric  health  care  and  a 
demonstrated  commitment  to  developing  programs  and  centers  of  excellence  for  the  assessment, 
diagnosis, prevention and treatment of child abuse and neglect.55 Effective September 1, 2009, FACN and 
MEDCARES Pediatric Centers of Excellence were approved for appropriation. MEDCARES offered support 
for additional training, education to community partners and providers, clinical services (x-rays/labs), and 
support for medical providers and social workers, case managers, and therapists. However, this funding 
ceased in 2021.

Listening Session Discussion 

Listening Session 

On  April  4,  2022,  the  Children’s  Commission  offered  a  “Listening  Session”  for  parents  to  share  their 
experiences and concerns about the department’s use of the Forensic Assessment Center Network. The 
purpose of the Listening Session was to create a parent-driven discussion about their experiences and to 
elicit suggestions to improve the communication and process between the FACN, DFPS, and families. The 
goal of the Listening Session was to reach a broader group of parents than those attending the Round 
Table and to provide a forum to focus solely on parent voices and recommendations.  

hildren’s  Commission  Executive  Director  Jamie  Bernstein  moderated  the  discussion  with  Children’s 
Commission,  DFPS,  and  Texas  Public  Policy  Foundation  staff  participating  in  listen  only  mode.  DFPS 
attended to listen to the discussion and the suggestions provided by the parents on ways to improve the 
FACN. The discussion followed a Q&A format, with the questions developed by the Children’s Commission 
in collaboration with DFPS and provided to the parents in advance.  

Four families from the Listening Session also participated in the April 11, 2022 Round Table meeting to 
represent  the  parents’  perspectives  in  the  larger  multidisciplinary  group  of  attendees.  This  Listening 
Session helped to shape the discussion at the Round Table where various perspectives were represented 
including DFPS, FACN, judges, attorneys, advocates, and others. See Appendix A for a full list of Listening 
Session participants. Below are the notes from the Listening Session discussion.   

Question: When did you come into contact with DFPS and the doctors in the network? Where did 
that contact occur? 

Each parent who joined the Listening Session as a participant (“participant”) provided details of their initial 
contacts and location. Many participants first had contact with a CAP in a hospital setting and others were 
initially contacted by a DFPS caseworker. One participant only had contact with the CAPs and did not have 
a DFPS case. The years of involvement ranged from 2010 to 2022. The participants’ contact with DFPS or 
CAPs  originated  from  urban,  suburban,  and  rural  areas  surrounding  Abilene,  Dallas-Fort  Worth,  and 
Houston. In at least one case, the CAP involved was not part of the FACN.  

Question: What information do you think would have been helpful to you, your attorneys, or the 
judge? 

Participants identified several overarching themes regarding access to information:  

•  The  need  for  more  clear  information  about  their  legal  rights,  the  legal  process,  and  system 

protocols;  

•  The need for transparency on behalf of DFPS and CAPs; and 

•  The  importance  of  addressing  the  impact  of  the  allegations  on  families  during  ongoing events 

where families were experiencing high levels of stress. 

Regarding  information  for  parents,  participants  expressed  that  misstatements  and  miscommunication 
from hospitals, DFPS, and CAPs were prevalent in their cases, which led to confusion and unfairness. They 
expressed that clear understanding of the process and timelines would have been helpful. Participants 

11 

  C

 

Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

reported  multiple  meetings  and  court  dates  that  parents  missed  due  to  lack  of  notice  or  gaps  in  the 
process. Some participants, but not all, shared that they were given a DFPS Handbook, but reported that 
the  handbook  did  not  fully  assist  with  navigating  the  systems  involved.  Some  participants  further 
explained  that  being  able  to  read  and  process  DFPS  policy  when  in  a  highly  emotional  state  was  very 
difficult. Something akin to an FAQ was suggested as a helpful tool to navigate the process from the outset 
(i.e.,  a  booklet  explaining  parents’  rights,  the  investigatory  process,  what  to  expect,  and  the  full  legal 
process). 

Participants expressed a need to know their rights as parents during their interactions with DFPS. Many 
participants indicated they did not know they had the right to refuse certain medical procedures, refuse 
to speak to the CAP, or refuse to speak to DFPS. The participants also indicated concern about the CAP 
consultation process. Many were not aware of and did not understand the role of the CAP. It was not until 
the DFPS caseworker spoke with them about their investigations that many of the participants understood 
the CAP’s role. One participant did not know a CAP was involved until after DFPS had taken custody of the 
child. 

All participants acknowledged that communication gaps were also intensified due to the fact that they 
were concerned about their child. When a DFPS investigation occurs while a child is ill or injured, parents 
are oftentimes preoccupied with the health of their child and may not fully absorb or understand the full 
process of the investigation. It may not be until later that parents fully comprehend and understand the 
scope of what is occurring legally and/or medically. Several participants indicated they did not understand 
at the time that the additional tests and consultations may be used to help determine whether abuse or 
neglect occurred. Participants stated that because they did not have a full understanding of the purpose 
for  certain  tests,  they  did  not  have  adequate  information  to  give  informed  consent.  One  participant 
highlighted that along  with  the  stress and worry of having  an ill or injured child, many  families  in this 
situation might be dealing with external, co-occurring stressors such as natural disasters, COVID-19, or 
other emergent situations that impact their ability to fully comprehend the evolving medical and legal 
issues. 

Regarding what would be helpful for judges making decisions in these cases, participants stated that full 
transparency and accurate reports to the court from all child welfare professionals early in the case could 
have avoided unnecessary trauma and in some cases, removal. For example, some participants pointed 
to the contradiction of accusing a parent of removing their child from the hospital against medical advice 
when the parent received complete discharge papers for their child. 

Participants indicated frustration that they were only given partial information from the CAPs and DFPS. 
Many  families  obtained  second  opinion  information  or  had  prior  information  from  their  child’s 
pediatrician  or  other  treating  doctor  which  disputed  the  CAP  findings.  In  these  instances,  that 
contradictory information was not added to their files, was disregarded, or not provided to the judge. 
Participants  also  emphasized  that  it  is  critical  for  DFPS  to  inform  the  parents  of  the  investigation  and 
disclose the allegations, as this was not reported as a consistent practice.  

Participants  also  noted  that  having  full  access  to  their  child’s  medical  file  and  the  DFPS  file  is  very 
important.  Participants  indicated  that  they  struggled  to  understand  and  respond  appropriately  to  the 
process as many consultations, affidavits, and conversations contained incomplete information.  

 

12 

Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

Question: What were the gaps in the way the system worked with your family?  

The participants identified multiple gaps with DFPS’ use of the FACN, including rushing the diagnosis and 
investigation, lack of an early appeals process, lack of transparency, not adequately considering second 
opinions,  unavailability  of  early  and  affordable  legal  representation,  and  the  need  for  more  extensive 
training. 

Many  of  the  participants  expressed  frustration  at  not  being  able  to  appeal,  mediate,  or  otherwise 
challenge  the  CAP’s  findings.  Participants  expressed  that  in  their  experience,  once  the  CAP  made  the 
decision  of  suspected  abuse,  no  other  opinion  of  medical  professionals  was  taken  into  account.  They 
reported not having an avenue for the CAP’s opinion, along with all medical records, to be reviewed by 
another  medical  professional  that  DFPS  would  consider.  Participants  also  articulated  concern  that  the 
CAPs made recommendations for removal but stated that this should be a decision made by DFPS, not the 
doctors. 

Participants also reported a lack of transparency about the relationship between the hospitals and DFPS. 
They  reported  uncertainty  and  confusion  regarding  which  personnel  worked  for  the  hospital  and  who 
DFPS  employed  during  the  DFPS  investigation  process.  They  reported  that  a  guide  which  lays  out  the 
process and persons involved would be beneficial.  

Additionally, participants expressed concern that the CAPs aimed to protect the hospital from liability and 
would provide vague descriptions or provide statements such as “this is my opinion.” Participants also 
indicated that DFPS staff relied heavily on CAP determinations because the DFPS staff are not medical 
professionals.  Participants  noted  that  this  approach  created  a  gap  in  accountability  for  DFPS  to  fully 
investigate  and  make  its  own  accurate  determinations.  Further,  some  participants  indicated  that 
malpractice protections left them without recourse against the doctor or hospital who suggested that the 
injuries or illness were the result of child abuse or neglect.  

Participants  also  discussed  barriers  to  obtain  legal  representation,  including  the  high  cost  of 
representation and the need to have legal representation early in the process. All participants reported 
wanting to cooperate with the medical teams and DFPS to help find out what was wrong with their child, 
but they did not realize they were being investigated as perpetrators. 

The participants also addressed gaps in documentation. Participants provided multiple examples where 
full medical records were not part of their file, inaccurate statements were documented, and incorrect 
information was relayed. For example, one participant indicated that they were portrayed as a flight risk 
for seeking second opinions.  

The  participants  identified  a  gap  in  training  for  DFPS  investigators.  Participants  indicated  that  DFPS 
investigators  rely  on  the  CAP’s  opinion  and  lack  training  on  medical  diagnoses  that  mimic  abuse.  The 
participants  recommended  specialized  training  for DFPS  investigators  regarding children  with  complex 
medical needs, obtaining second opinions, and investigating multiple sources of information.  

dditionally, participants recommended improved training on the way DFPS investigators approach an 
investigation.  Participants  reported  that  they  were  treated  as  “guilty  until  proven  innocent.”  They 
expressed feeling that the burden is on  the caregiver to show  abuse/neglect did  not occur, instead of 
being on DFPS to prove that abuse/neglect did occur. Participants indicated that even the term “alleged 
perpetrator” put them at a disadvantage and created a burden to overcome.

Question:  What  changes  do  you  think  would  help  families  who  find  themselves  in  a  similar 
situation in the future? What additional recommendations do you have to improve the use of the 
network? 

The  participants  shared  many  recommendations  to  help  improve  the  use  of  the  Forensic  Assessment 
Center Network.  

One  recommendation  was  the  development  of  a  parent  advocate,  mentor,  or  support  program  that 
provides help for families to navigate the process. Participants suggested this could help bolster caregivers 
and ensure their voices are heard.  

All of the participants supported the idea of overhauling the review system both for current and prior 
cases. For current cases, participants recommended strict policies against allowing the CAP who initially 
made a determination about abuse or neglect to participate on the administrative review panel, a process 
that  the  participants  believed  had  occurred.  Participants  argued  that  a  doctor  who  believes  abuse  or 
neglect  occurred  is  biased  and  unable  to  adequately  review  their  own  work.  Similarly,  participants 
recommended that doctors should be prevented from reviewing their colleague’s determinations as there 
may be pressure to not contradict a colleague or a designated child abuse specialist.  

One suggestion from participants is a blind review process where all identifying information on the child 
and medical professionals is removed to protect against potential bias and to allow the doctors to review 
all medical evidence in a fair and neutral environment.  

Participants further suggested that the FACN should implement a review process for closed cases where 
there  is  a  medical  diagnosis  that  contradicts  the  CAP’s  determination  about  abuse  or  neglect  to  learn 
whether protocols were followed and what steps could be taken to ensure accurate determinations. This 
includes reviewing new medical records and evidence to determine whether the assessment of abuse was 
correct.  

Participants  recommended  that  improved  data  collection  and  analysis  would  be  beneficial  to  better 
identify and address systemic issues.  

One participant suggested that complex medical cases should perhaps not be handled by a CAP but by the 
expert(s) trained in that particular area of medicine (i.e., radiology). Participants emphasized that CAPs 
have special training  in evaluating child abuse, which does include  training in hematological disorders, 
birth trauma, and  other complex medical conditions, but the specialists  trained in these areas may be 
better equipped to handle cases involving these conditions. Another approach suggested by participants 
would be to utilize a review panel to intervene in complex medical cases. Participants identified the need 
for checks and balances and developing an evaluation process to ensure there are no “bad actors” in the 
network if it continues in its current structure.  

One participant suggested creating a uniform, but modular protocol for DFPS investigators and CAPs in 
complex medical cases. The goal would be to help ensure consistency so that an inquiry about second 
opinions is always made, that all medical records are obtained, that questions are always made about 
family history, that regular pediatricians and treating physicians are routinely and regularly interviewed, 
etc. However, another participant cautioned that a “one size fits all” approach is not appropriate and could 
limit flexibility to make determinations based on all the evidence presented.  

 

14 

Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

Additionally, participants suggested that investigators should be trained to ask certain questions about 
how to care for the child when indicators of complex medical needs are present such as use of an oxygen 
tank, specific prescriptions, etc. 

Participants recommended better training on the statutory changes implemented with Senate Bill 1578, 
especially in light of the fact that one of the participant’s cases occurred after the effective date of the bill. 

The participants agreed that the lack of transparency during the DFPS investigation led to  distrust and 
miscommunication during the process. Participants acknowledged living in fear while waiting for DFPS to 
contact them. Participants also noted that their efforts to set up family team meetings and other outreach 
to DFPS was sometimes met with delay or unwillingness to meet. This was a very challenging experience 
while they were also waiting to obtain answers about the injury or illness their child was facing.  

The participants also recommended reviewing the medical billing process for cases involving suspected 
abuse  or  neglect  and  comparing  it  to  other  systems.  Participants  noted  that  children  are  sent  for 
numerous or duplicative tests and treatments during the investigation and insurance and Medicaid could 
be paying for many unnecessary tests.  

One participant indicated how frustrating it was for them to experience this entire process and then have 
DFPS file nonsuit against them and close the case before the family was able to present their case to the 
court. Also, participants noted that if DFPS did not list the CAP as an expert witness in the case, the family 
was not able to depose the CAP.  

Participants emphasized that these investigations and cases are traumatic for the entire family and that 
this trauma does not disappear when the case closes. Participants emphasized that doctors, medical staff, 
and DFPS staff must all understand the impact of these investigations on the families, including on their 
financial and mental well-being. 

Participants  identified  the  significant  financial  strain  that  resulted  from  FACN  and  DFPS  involvement 
including seeking second opinions, hiring experts, etc. This is a challenge for all participants but especially 
challenging for low-income families. Identifying a source of funding to  defray these  costs was another 
identified recommendation from participants.  

The  participants  also  recommended  a  financial  recourse  for  families  to  regain  financial  wholeness,  as 
many  spent  their  life  savings  in  response  to  the  investigation  and  are  currently  still  in  debt  from  the 
allegations  against  them.  Participants  expressed  that  this  recourse  would  provide  further  checks  and 
balances in the system and ensure all records are reviewed and multiple second opinions are taken prior 
to removal of a child and provide an increased level of accountability for all involved.  

Five  participants  from  the  Listening  Session  attended  the  Round  Table  held  on  April  11,  2022.  These 
participants were able  to share their concerns with other  attendees at the Round Table.  The  ensuing 
discussion informed the following recommendations. 

Round Table – Priority Recommendations 

Round Table Discussion 

On April 11, 2022, the Supreme Court of Texas Children’s Commission, in partnership with DFPS, hosted a 
Round Table in Austin on the use of the Forensic Assessment Center Network. Hon. Rob Hofmann, Judge 
of the 452nd District Court and Children’s Commission Senior Jurist in Residence, moderated a five-hour 

 

15 

Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

discussion. Forty-five participants attended, including representatives from DFPS, parents with experience 
with the FACN, parent and child advocates, Child Abuse Pediatricians, other pediatric specialists, judges, 
and  attorneys  who  represent  parents,  children,  or  DFPS.  See  Appendix  A  for  a  complete  Round  Table 
participant list. The Round Table provided a forum for all attendees to discuss the department’s use of the 
FACN, identify gaps in the usage of FACN, and develop recommendations.  

Through  conversations  generated  during  the  Listening  Session  and  the  Round  Table,  DFPS  with  the 
assistance  of  the  Children’s  Commission  evaluated  the  use  of  the  FACN  and  developed  joint 
recommendations to improve the agreement between DFPS and the FACN, and to identify best practices 
for  using  assessments  provided  by  the  FACN.  Overarching  themes  include  the  need  for  increased 
accountability and transparency about the relationship between DFPS and the FACN as well as improved 
communication between DFPS, FACN medical staff, and parents, and the need for additional clarity and 
guidance about the DFPS investigation process when the FACN is involved.  

The  priority  recommendations  are  laid  out  in  italics  and  addressed  in  the  categories  listed  below. 

Contract

Resources

Training

Data & Information Sharing

System Improvement

It is critical to note that not every participant at the Round Table or Listening Session agreed or supported 
each of the recommendations laid out below. While there was some support for each recommendation, 
this report does not represent unanimous consensus for all participants. Rather, this report summarizes 
the key takeaways and themes discussed in both the Listening Session and Round Table. 

Contract 

Prior to the Round Table discussion, all participants received a copy of the FY 20-24  Interagency Contract 
entered into by DFPS and UTHSC-Houston and a draft of the pending FY 25-30 contract. The draft includes 
various updates and changes in response to SB 1578. The joint recommendation below aims to improve 
both the transparency and consistency in the FACN process.  

Require standardized and detailed information in the FACN report that supports the determination.  

Concerns  regarding  transparency  arose  during  the  Round  Table  discussion,  as  there  were  reports  of 
parents having  difficulty obtaining  medical information. Families reported that it was not always clear 
what information the FACN specialist used to make their determination.  

The FY 20-24 Interagency Contract states that the medical professional providing the FACN consultation 
would produce a timely written assessment of the results of the case consultation submitted by the FACN 
to  DFPS  and  an  affidavit  or  other  documentation  to  meet  the  court  or  administrative  hearing 
requirements, if requested by DFPS.56 Currently, the FACN provides a written assessment to DFPS once a 
consultation is complete. That assessment may contain information in the following categories: history 
and  physical,  birth  history,  developmental  history,  past  medical  history,  home  medications,  allergies, 

 

16 

 

Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

immunizations, past surgical history, primary pediatrician, social history, family history, review of systems, 
physical exam with vitals and a detailed body system examination, labs, imaging, and determination.  

Although the FACN assessments contain much of the vital information needed, a joint recommendation 
by DFPS and the Children’s Commission is for the future contract to include details of what is required to 
be  included  in  the  final  written  assessment,  such  as  listing  the  documentation  the  FACN  specialist 
reviewed in making the assessment, who the FACN specialist consulted with, and what, if any, additional 
information the FACN specialist thinks could be pertinent to the child’s assessment. While many FACN 
specialists may include this in their determination, the contract does not specify what information must 
be included. To help ensure this information is available to all parties, the contract should also require 
FACN to provide the medical records and FACN records to DFPS in a timely manner. 

Resources  

The Listening Session and Round Table identified the need for additional support to families, child welfare 
professionals,  and  medical  specialists  in  cases  involving  the  use  of  the  Forensic  Assessment  Center 
Network. These resource recommendations are designed to address checks and balances in the system 
so  that  parents  know  their  rights  and  all  other  stakeholders  fully  understand  their  roles  and 
responsibilities.  

Create a DFPS specialist position at the state or regional level focused on complex medical cases. 

The DFPS investigation and the FACN network are each complex and when the two intersect, it can be 
difficult for parents to navigate. Contributing to this challenge is that there are multiple additional systems 
that often intersect with DFPS’ child welfare process, such as health care (i.e., Medicaid) and education. 
Accordingly, DFPS has subject matter experts to help children and families navigate these specialty areas. 
Each region  is equipped with a Well-Being Specialist57 and an  Educational Specialist.58 The  state office 
liaisons also serve as the regional point of contacts for staff who encounter specific issues related to the 
nuances often involved with these intersecting systems. Additionally, DFPS employs six nurse consultants. 
These nurse consultants are licensed Registered Nurses who do not function in a clinical direct patient 
care role but provide consultation and education to CPS staff about health care issues related to children.59  

The  FACN  and  DFPS  would  both  benefit  from  a  subject  matter  expert  at the  state or  regional  level  to 
consult with the nurse consultants and DFPS staff on cases involving the use of the FACN. Of the 154,593 
completed investigations in FY 2020,60 6127 involved a referral to the FACN.61 Thus, approximately 3.47% 
of all investigations were also reviewed by the FACN62 in that year, resulting in a situation where a CPI 
caseworker is unlikely to  refer a case to the FACN on a regular basis. By identifying a state or regional 
subject matter expert who knows both the duties of DFPS and of the FACN, specialized knowledge and 
expertise would be readily available to ensure proper handling of these complex cases.  

Explore the creation of a uniform protocol for DFPS investigations involving allegations of child abuse or 
neglect in complex medical cases. 

The CPS Handbook provides guidance for investigations on when to make a referral to the FACN but allows 
for discretion for CPI caseworkers.63 While some flexibility is important for investigations, allegations of 
child  abuse  or  neglect  in  complex  medical  cases  can  be  quite  complicated  thus  leading  to  potential 
inconsistencies in caseworker practice.  

One recommendation to address this concern is to create a uniform protocol for all cases that involve the 
FACN. A uniform protocol should not be implemented to require a “cookie cutter” approach but rather to 

 

17 

Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

ensure that certain practices are established with regularity and uniformity across the state. Topics in the 
protocol could include interview techniques such as ensuring that a full birth and medical history of the 
child and family is gathered by the CPI caseworker, that the names and phone numbers of any medical 
professionals who examined the child are noted and interviews are scheduled, and that additional inquiry 
into a heredity or genetic condition are asked during the DFPS interview. 

Clarify the roles of the DFPS Child Protective Investigator and the FACN specialists. 

The CPI caseworker and FACN specialist may not be the only professionals who parents will encounter 
during an investigation. Parents may also encounter CAPs who are not part of the FACN. These CAPs are 
not contracted with DFPS to provide written assessments and do not have a formal documentation review 
process set up with DFPS. Similarly, if a CAP is part of the FACN network, a family may not understand the 
scope of the relationship between the FACN and DFPS and may feel they are not getting a fair assessment 
or investigation due to this relationship. Since it is not always understood or made clear when a CAP is 
involved with DFPS and how that can impact the case, this can add confusion and frustration to an already 
stressful situation. 

Pursuant  to  Texas  Family  Code  §261.307,  during  an  investigation  DFPS  must  provide  the  parent  or 
guardian  with  information  about  the  investigation  procedures,  legal  rights,  and  other  important 
information.64 DFPS provides this information to parents through a handout and online webpage called 
“A  Parent‘s  Guide  to  Department  of  Family  and  Protective  Services  (DFPS)  Investigations”65  to  help 
navigate a DFPS investigation.  

One  way  to  address  the  confusion  around  DFPS  and  the  FACN  would  be  for  DFPS  or  the  Children’s 
Commission to create a separate resource specifically for families who are involved in an investigation 
when  the  FACN  is  being  consulted.  This  resource  should  include  information  about  the  roles  of  the 
professionals involved, the process of a FACN referral, the referral for a specialty consultation, and the 
use of second  opinions.66 This resource may also  contain  information about role clarity when a CAP is 
involved but is not part of the FACN.  

To aid in increased transparency, the FACN specialists should also clearly identify themselves and their 
role when interacting with parents and should document the specialists who interacted with or examined 
the child who is the subject of the FACN report. 

Create and utilize a medical resource form for parents to complete that includes clarifying medical 
information for DFPS during an investigation. 

An  investigation  with  a  FACN  consultation  may  involve  a  child  with  a  complex  medical  history  or  an 
undiscovered medical condition. Parents often have critical information related to the care of the child 
and a process should be in place to ensure that information is captured as early as possible. This can assist 
with the child’s medical care as well as identify conditions that could mimic abuse or neglect.  

DFPS utilizes forms for other purposes to ensure critical information is not lost during the early stages of 
an investigation. For example, if an investigation may result in an out-of-home placement of the child, the 
CPI  caseworker  will  present  the  parents  with  DFPS  Form  2625,  Child  Caregiver  Resource  Form.67  The 
purpose of this form is for the parent to provide the names and locating information for relatives who the 
parents may want to care for the child until the parent is able to have them return to their home.68 Another 
example  is  the  use  of  DFPS  Form  2279,  Placement  Summary  which  contains  a  section  for  the  child’s 
medical history including listing medical conditions, medications, and name of primary physician and any 
specialists.69 

 

18 

Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

By utilizing a medical resource form at the investigation stage, parents could share information about their 
child’s medical needs in their own words and descriptions. If created, this information could be utilized in 
cases where a FACN referral is made and be submitted to the FACN by DFPS. This form may also aid the 
FACN specialists in their case consultation and documentation review. 

Explore a blind review process of FACN determinations from an outside medical team. 

Texas Family Code § 261.3017 contains a provision which states that the FACN and DFPS must use a blind 
peer  review  process  to  resolve  cases  where  physicians  in  the  network  or  system  disagree  about  the 
assessment of the causes of a child’s injuries.70 This blind review process is reflected within the FY 20-FY 
24 contract between DFPS and UTHSC-Houston where Article 2 – Scope of Service provides that there 
must  be  a  peer  review  process  for  physicians.71  Section  2.5  then  goes  on  to  state  that  “[d]uring  the 
contract  period,  UT  will  maintain  the  peer  review  process  for  physicians.  The  process  should  help 
physicians  come  to  a  consensus  when  they  disagree  about  an  abuse/neglect  diagnosis.”72  The  current 
contract  and  practice  require  that  the  FACN  network  conduct  a  peer  review  process  when  there  is  a 
disagreement. However, due to staffing concerns, this review is conducted only in a small number of cases 
referred to the FACN.  

To increase accuracy and transparency, blind peer review should be available in a greater proportion of 
cases referred to FACN. This would likely require increased funding and could require additional contracts. 
DFPS and the FACN will continue to utilize the blind peer review process, but should additional funding be 
added for the FACN program, an external review by non-FACN medical professionals can be explored. 

Improve communication between parents, DFPS, and all medical professionals. 

In DFPS investigations when the FACN is involved, communication can be a challenge between the parents, 
DFPS, and medical professionals. The CPI caseworker speaks with the FACN specialist and with the parents; 
depending  on the case facts, the FACN  specialist may speak with  the parents. Each party may  hear or 
interpret  information  differently  across  these  various  conversations  and  information  can  be  lost  or 
misconstrued.  

DFPS  fully  supports  collaborative  approaches  to  service  planning  and  decision-making  and  currently 
utilizes various approaches to engage family and support systems for children and their families involved 
with  DFPS  such  as  a  Family  Group  Decision  Making  model,  Family  Team  Meetings,  Family  Group 
Conferences, Circle of Support Transition Plan Meetings, and Permanency Conferences.73  

Most relevant to complex medical cases, the Family Team Meeting is generally conducted if a child may 
be removed from their home. These meetings enable DFPS to provide a quick, family-involved response 
to concerns about  the  child’s  safety  or placement and achieve positive results for the child during the 
earliest  stages  of  DFPS  interaction  with  the  family.74  DFPS  can  make  best  efforts  to  improve 
communication between their staff and parents by utilizing a Family Team Meeting when appropriate and 
inviting medical professionals to participate to encourage everyone involved to hear the same information 
at the same time.  

Clearly articulate to parents what their rights are during a DFPS investigation when the FACN is involved.  

Parents should be informed of their rights during a DFPS investigation, especially when a child is receiving 
medical care in a hospital setting. As noted previously, when a child is ill or injured, a parent’s first concern 
is typically for the health and well-being of their child. In the hospital setting, medical providers treat the 
child and aim to ensure their health and safety. This situation can create a very fast-paced and stressful 

 

19 

Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

environment. Information and guidance should be provided to parents to assist them with navigating this 
process. This guidance can be developed by DFPS in collaboration with the Children’s Commission’s Parent 
Resource  Workgroup  or  other  multidisciplinary  groups  that  include  parents  with  lived  experience  and 
parent advocates.   

Provide clear guidance about the administrative review process and expungement of records. 

During the Listening Session and Round Table, parents expressed concerns regarding a desire to have a 
fair review process. Parents reported that if they were able to have their children returned to their care 
by the court after DFPS involvement, they still faced the stigma and challenges of a “reason to believe” 
finding within the DFPS system which could impact the future for their families (i.e., employment).  

Having proper avenues  to dispute  administrative determinations of a “reason to believe” finding is  an 
important part of the review of DFPS Investigations.75 One avenue for review of this determination is the 
Administrative Review of Investigation Findings (ARIF).76 DFPS offers a review of their internal findings 
when CPI makes a finding of “reason to believe” against a person for abuse or neglect of a child and that 
person requests such a review.77  

An ARIF is conducted by an employee of DFPS known as a resolution specialist, who is not involved in or 
directly supervising the investigation. Participants may appear, make statements, provide relevant written 
materials,  and  ask  questions,  but  the  formal  rules  of  evidence  do  not  apply,  and  the  review  does  not 
include  formal  witness  testimony.78  An  interpreter,  legal  representative  of  the  requester,  parent  or 
guardian  (if  requester  is  a  minor), or  a  support  person  may  be  permitted  to  attend  the  ARIF.  79  If  the 
requester/parent disagrees with ARIF decision, they maintain their right to seek an administrative hearing.  

If the ARIF results in a change to disposition, the resolution specialist must ensure that the records of the 
allegation in the DFPS case management system (IMPACT) reflect the decision made in the ARIF.80 Under 
Texas Family Code § 261.315, a requestor/parent is entitled to request the removal of information from 
DFPS  records  concerning  their  role  as  an  alleged  perpetrator  as  a  result  of  the  ARIF.81  The  Texas 
Administrative Code § 707.517(c) gives detailed instructions on how a request can be made to remove 
records, but this may not be easy for a parent to navigate to completion without guidance.  

Another avenue for an administrative review for parents is the State Office of Administrative Hearings 
(SOAH). The mission of SOAH is to resolve disputes between Texas agencies, other governmental entities, 
and private citizens either through an administrative hearing or mediation.82 

The hearing consists of a SOAH judge, who has the sole authority to issues orders without involvement of 
any panel of persons.83 During the SOAH hearing, exhibits and witnesses84 may be called by both parties 
and under the FACN contract, DFPS may call the FACN specialist for their case. Once the judge makes a 
final decision, “the judge shall furnish a copy of the decision to [DFPS] and to each party.”85 

Additional guidance can equip requesters/parents with a better understanding of how to navigate these 
complex processes. Offering more guidance in these areas will support DFPS’ goal of delivering results in 
an accountable, ethical, and transparent manner.86  

Training 

Perhaps the clearest theme from the Listening Session and Round Table was that “practice needs to match 
policy.”  Due  to  a  variety  of  factors,  DFPS  policy  does  not  always  flow  to  the  caseworkers  in  the  field, 
resulting in inconsistent practices. One key approach to addressing this gap is through effective training.  

 

20 

Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

The Listening Session and Round Table shed light on areas where additional training would be beneficial 
to aid in the transparency and accuracy of a DFPS Investigation when the FACN is involved. This includes 
training multiple groups, including DFPS staff as well as the legal and medical communities. DFPS and the 
Children’s  Commission  can  coordinate  efforts  and  partner with  other  organizations to offer  additional 
training opportunities to these audiences. 

Training for DFPS staff 

Provide clear guidance for DFPS investigations in complex medical cases. 

Additional training may be needed to address the following areas during a DFPS investigation: when the 
CPI caseworker should utilize the FACN, what questions a CPI caseworker should ask when a FACN referral 
is made, and what information DFPS should provide to the FACN.  

To  address  the  first  point,  DFPS  Policy  Section  2232  outlines  when  DFPS  caseworkers  should  make  a 
referral to the FACN87 and DFPS provides a resource guide for caseworkers to use when determining if 
they should consult with the network.88 Although these two resources are available for CPI caseworkers, 
DFPS supports a more detailed training for caseworkers that provides specific guidance on cases where 
the FACN is consulted.  

The second point addresses training on what questions a CPI caseworker should be asking when a FACN 
referral  is  made.  The  role  of  the  CPI  caseworker  is  to  “investigate  a  report  that  meets  the  statutory 
definition  of  abuse  or  neglect…”89  Investigations  which  require  the  use  of  the  FACN  consultation  are 
typically those with complicated medical issues.90 Also, as the data show, due to the complexity of the 
investigation there may be an increased number of persons to interview including the parents, caregivers, 
and multiple medical providers, both past and present.  

The third point to address for training in this area relates to what information should be submitted by the 
CPI caseworker to the FACN and what information the FACN medical staff needs. Currently, instructions 
for submitting a FACN referral include that a caseworker can “attach documents and pictures directly… 
[t]his  may  include  items  such  as  medical  records  or  X-rays,  information  concerning  the  child's 
developmental capabilities, laboratory test results, and photographs in order for the physician to have 
sufficient information to provide an accurate and complete report.”91 Training caseworkers on gathering 
a  complete  medical  history  and  then  obtaining  those  historical  medical  records  will  aid  both  CPI 
caseworkers and the FACN in their assessment. No two cases are identical, and it is important that the 
FACN specialists receive a full picture of the child’s health as early as possible. 

Consider second opinions in complex medical cases and obtain second opinions as appropriate. 

Another  area  of  training  that  the  Round  Table  identified  as  needing  additional  guidance  for  CPI 
caseworkers relates to the issue of second opinions.  

Texas Family Code § 261.3017(e) outlines the following directive for DFPS when presented with a second 
opinion: “[t]he department shall accept and consider an alternative opinion obtained and provided under 
this  section  and  shall  document  its  analysis  and  determinations  regarding  the  opinion.”92  Additionally, 
DFPS Policy  Section 2232.2 supports  this  directive that  “[t]he family is not prohibited from seeking an 
alternative opinion at their own expense. If the family seeks a second medical opinion, the caseworker 
must accept and consider this alternative opinion and document it in the contact narrative in IMPACT.”93 
Both  the  Family  Code  and  DFPS  policy  align  in  how  a  second  opinion  must  be  handled  by  the  CPI 
caseworker, which is to accept and consider them.  

 

21 

Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

Additional training  for  DFPS  staff  can  address the various types  of  second opinions  to ensure  that the 
practice of its staff matches the law and its policy. The training should include next steps for caseworkers 
regarding submitting the second opinions and follow up documentation to the FACN. 

Interview the child’s regular treating physicians and any specialists who provided care for the child prior 
to the investigation. 

To ensure a full and complete DFPS investigation when the FACN is involved, DFPS caseworkers should 
make contact and interview the child’s regular treating physician, and any specialists who provided care 
for the child prior to the opening of the DFPS investigation. Often, these medical professionals have critical 
information  about  recent  treatment  or  diagnosis  or  perhaps  relevant  medical  history  that  should  be 
included  as  part  of  the  DFPS  investigation.  By  interviewing  those  medical  professionals who  had  prior 
contact with the child, DFPS investigators can see a full picture of the child’s condition or identify missing 
pieces which need further investigation and inquiry. This information may also assist DFPS investigators 
in reaching a determination about the child’s safety in a more expeditious manner.  

Present clear and thorough documentation and evidence to the court, including second opinions and 
relevant medical testing. 

The final area for training specific to DFPS caseworkers relates to the removal affidavit. Prior to taking 
possession of a child, absent exigent removals,94 a petition requesting permission to take possession of a 
child must be supported by an affidavit.”95 A judge then reviews the petition and accompanying affidavit 
and makes findings under the Texas Family Code § 262.102 that: 

•  There is an immediate danger to the physical health or safety of the child, or the child has been a 

victim of neglect or sexual abuse; 

•  Continuation in the home would be contrary to the child's welfare; 

•  There is no time, consistent with the physical health or safety of the child and the nature of the 

emergency, for a full adversary hearing; and  

•  Reasonable efforts, consistent with the circumstances and providing for the safety of the child, 

were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child.96 

Additionally,  “[a]  determination  under  this  section  that  there  is  an  immediate  danger  to  the  physical 
health or safety of a child or that the child has been a victim of neglect or sexual abuse may not be based 
solely  on  the  opinion  of  a  medical  professional  under  contract  with  the  Department  of  Family  and 
Protective Services who did not conduct a physical examination of the child.”97  

Affidavits  prepared  by  the  DFPS  caseworker  must  include  the  relevant  facts  for  a  judge  to  make  the 
findings  listed  above.  Additional  expanded  training  regarding  affidavit  writing  as  it  relates  to  cases 
involving  complex  medical  cases  and  the  FACN  could  benefit  families’  understanding  of  the  medical 
diagnosis  and  equip  attorneys  and  judges  with  the  information  needed  at  the  beginning  of  a  case.  In 
complex medical cases, there is often a voluminous amount of information that the CPI caseworker must 
condense into a few pages within the affidavit for the judge. When a second opinion is obtained and when 
relevant medical testing is being processed, it is imperative that this information is presented to the court 
so that the court has a clear picture of all explanations regarding the child’s health. The additional training 
noted  above  regarding  information  gathering  and  alternative  opinions  will  help  the  CPI  caseworker  in 
preparing their affidavit for the court.  

 

22 

Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

Training for Attorneys 

When a family is involved in a child welfare proceeding, quality legal representation is essential for all 
parties to ensure that the court strikes the appropriate balance between the rights and duties of all parties 
involved. DFPS and the Children’s Commission recognize the important role of attorneys and the need for 
them to have specialized training for cases involving the FACN. 

Support training for attorneys who represent DFPS on complex medical cases. 

For representation during the filing of a Suit Affecting the Parent Child Relationship, DFPS utilizes regional 
DFPS attorneys as well as district and county attorneys. Prior to filing suit, the attorney who represents 
DFPS will review the CPI caseworker’s affidavit to assess the sufficiency of the evidence. In order to provide 
quality legal representation, these attorneys should understand how to handle complex medical cases. 

The Children’s Commission  2022  version of the Tool Kit  for Attorneys Representing the Department of 
Family  and  Protective  Services  in  Child  Welfare  Cases  will  be  updated  to  include  guidance  on  cases 
involving allegations of child abuse and neglect and the FACN.98 Additionally, the Children’s Commission 
and DFPS can identify training opportunities for attorneys who represent DFPS to ensure they are familiar 
with the FACN process including asking questions about an second opinion, historical and current medical 
records and disclosure of those records if a specialty consult has been requested, and to always inquire 
whether the parents have retained counsel.99  

Identify training opportunities about complex medical cases for attorneys who represent children and 
parents. 

If DFPS files suit seeking to terminate the parent-child relationship, or seeking required participation in 
services, the court must appoint an attorney ad litem to represent the interest of the child and a separate 
ad litem for a parent who is found to be indigent and in opposition to the suit.100 Part of quality legal 
representation is equipping attorneys with knowledge and tools to ensure they understand the scope of 
their duties and the law. Cases involving a referral to the FACN may not be common, but they are likely to 
be complex and additional training could strengthen legal advocacy.  

Topics that the Round Table identified as additional training for attorneys relate to knowing the process 
of the FACN, how medical records can be obtained in an expedited manner from the hospital or DFPS, 
whether a formal discovery request is needed, and whether there is a faster way to obtain evidence.  

One critical training topic for attorneys is regarding Texas Family Code §262.014, Disclosure of Certain 
Evidence.  This provision of the Texas Family Code requires upon the request of the attorney for a parent 
or  the  attorney  ad  litem  for  the  child,  that  DFPS  provide the  name of  any witness  to  be  called  at  the 
adversary, a copy of any offense report used to refresh the memory of the witness, and a copy of any 
photograph, video, or recording presented as evidence at the hearing. By providing expanded training on 
this provision, more attorneys who represent parents and children can access critical information such as 
medical records and the names of medical witnesses before the date of the adversary hearing, or request 
exclusion of such evidence if not properly produced.   

Additionally, the Round Table identified specific training for ad litem attorneys to utilize their ability to 
request information relating to the child under Texas Family Code § 107.006. The Children’s Commission 
published its 2022 Tool Kit for Attorneys Representing Parents and Children in Child Welfare Cases which 
included a specific chapter with guidance on cases involving allegations of child abuse and neglect when 
the FACN is involved.101  

 

23 

Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

Training for Judges 

Provide training on handling complex medical cases to judges who oversee child welfare cases. 

Judges who oversee child welfare cases are tasked with making judicial determinations about the safety, 
permanency, and well-being of a child and their family. A judge’s decision is based solely on the evidence 
presented and must weigh the credibility of that evidence based upon their training and education. By 
providing statewide training designed specifically for judges on the purpose, use, and role of the FACN, 
including changes implemented in response to SB 1578, judges will be better equipped to oversee these 
types of cases in their courts. 

Training for all Child Welfare Professionals 

The following topics were identified at the Round Table to be beneficial to those previously-mentioned 
professionals, along with other professionals such as the medical community. Some of these topics and 
associated audiences may be beyond the scope of the Children’s Commission and DFPS’ reach and will 
require additional collaboration with other entities.  

Expand training on conditions that mimic child abuse and ways to utilize FACN specialists. 

Texas Family Code § 261.3017 identifies four conditions which may mimic physical abuse: rickets; Ehlers-
Danlos Syndrome; osteogenesis imperfecta; vitamin D deficiency; and broad category of “other medical 
conditions that mimic  child  maltreatment  or  increase  the  risk  of  misdiagnosis  of  maltreatment.”102  By 
providing training on conditions which can mimic child abuse to professionals who are involved when the 
FACN is being consulted, all professionals can become more aware of alterative explanations as to why a 
child may be ill or injured. 

Provide additional training and clarification on the FACN term “non-specific” findings. 

As previously discussed, the FACN uses seven types of findings when making a written determination upon 
completion of their consultation: substantial, concerning, non-specific, no evidence of maltreatment, at 
risk for maltreatment, insufficient information available, and no allegation of abuse or neglect. Specifically, 
the  use  of  “non-specific,”  which  means  the  child’s  injury  may  result  from  abuse  or  neglect,  but  that 
accidental/natural  explanations  are  possible,103  can  cause  confusion  for  child  welfare  professionals.  In 
order to ensure each case is properly being evaluated and assessed, a FACN evaluation with this type of 
determination  may  require  additional  in-depth  investigations  and  the  collaborative  effort  of  all  child 
welfare professionals.  

Provide statewide trainings on complex medical cases with second and conflicting opinions. 

Second opinions are critical to the care of children and to the rights of parents involved with DFPS in cases 
involving the FACN. Senate Bill 1578 added specific provisions to the Family Code to help ensure all child 
welfare  professionals  recognize  the  importance  of  these  second  opinions.  Additional  training  is 
recommended  for  all  child  welfare  professionals  on the  right  of  a  parent  to  obtain  a  qualified  second 
opinion,  how  DFPS  must  accept  and  consider  this  second  opinion, and  how  judges  must  consider  this 
opinion when evaluating immediate danger to a child. 

 

24 

Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

Develop trainings on changes to the FACN and DFPS policy and practice resulting from SB 1578 (87th Leg. 
Session). 

The  bill  analysis  for  SB  1758  includes  a  statement  that  the  intent  is  to  “seek  to  better  ensure  that 
individuals against whom a protective order is sought are afforded the same rights to provide medical 
determinations/testimony in court as DFPS” and it “prohibits removal based solely on the opinion of a 
medical professional under contract with DFPS.”104 Publicly available, free or low-cost training for all child 
welfare professionals can help to ensure professionals are aware of the legal requirements. A few main 
points of the training should include how DFPS uses the FACN, the limitations of the FACN, the scope of 
its reach, what the exchange of information between DFPS and the FACN looks like, what DFPS does with 
that information, and how it is then shared with the legal professionals and parents. 

Data and Information Sharing 

Listening Session and Round Table participants acknowledged that data collection and information sharing 
are  each  integral  components  to  the  child  welfare  system.  DFPS  currently  produces  an  interactive 
database that is publicly shared on their website.105 The contract between DFPS and the FACN requires a 
monthly progress report on the activities of the FACN the month prior including the number of referrals 
received,  type  of  case,  and  number  of  written  assessments  provided,  along  with  ten  other  areas  of 
statistics.106 These existing processes can be supplemented to support better outcomes for children and 
families.  

Establish uniform data collection and analysis practices, including collecting information by FACN case 
type. 

Currently DFPS and FACN do not have a system where data are exchanged and calculated automatically, 
all information shared must be done at the case level. As a result, this information is not easily shareable 
on the DFPS website.  

It is difficult to identify practices in need of improvement or trends in cases involving FACN without more 
specificity in the data fields. Since multiple fact scenarios could result in a referral to the FACN, the data 
should be disaggregated by case type to encourage a more robust data analysis.  

An area for improvement identified at the Round Table is to make these data more easily accessible to 
the public and easier to review for trends. However, DFPS may need to contract with a third-party vendor 
to  help  capture  and  analyze  these  data.  A  third-party  vendor  will  require  additional  funding  and 
appropriations as this is not currently in the DFPS budget. DFPS and the Children’s Commission are open 
to holding additional  discussions  on  the data collection and best practices of obtaining, analyzing, and 
sharing this information. 

Support case management continuity and coordinated transfers of cases including increasing 
communication between the FACN Specialists, DFPS, and families.  

Although one CPI caseworker is assigned to an investigation, a case may change hands due to a number 
of reasons possibly  related  to  the  complexity of  the case, supervisor involvement,  a  worker becoming 
unexpectedly unavailable, transfer of a case due to jurisdictional issues, when a case involves a legal out- 
of-home placement, and/or the eventual transfer to a conservatorship caseworker within CPS. Similarly, 
a child may be seen at multiple hospitals or have multiple doctor visits, and unless these medical providers 
are within the same hospital system, medical records do not transfer easily and may not be accessible. 

 

25 

Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

Parents and attorneys both expressed frustration at the Round Table with their ability to timely obtain 
medical records.  

It is critical for child welfare, legal, and medical professionals to communicate with one another and share 
relevant information in a timely manner. By exploring ways to increase information sharing, DFPS, medical 
specialists, and families can better access the vital knowledge that each hold. Some possibilities to explore 
include inviting medical specialists to the DFPS-hosted Family Team Meetings, inviting parents and DFPS 
to medical consultations, or setting up a specific meeting where all parties can discuss the child’s medical 
care, condition, and treatment.  

System Improvement 

During the evaluation of the use of the FACN network, recommendations arose that would benefit the 
child  welfare  community  as  a  whole.  While  the  charge  of  Senate  Bill  1578  was  to  evaluate  and  make 
recommendations for the use of the network, these broader concerns about the child welfare system in 
general should be taken into account. While the recommendations below relate to all child welfare cases, 
specialized information and assistance would undoubtedly strengthen these efforts in complex medical 
cases.  

Expand availability of mandated reporter training. 

The Texas Family Code requires any person who has reasonable cause to believe that a child’s physical or 
mental health or welfare has been adversely affected by abuse or neglect by any person must immediately 
make  a  report  to  the  statewide  hotline;  this  is  also  known  as  the  mandated  reporter  statute.107  A 
professional who has reason to believe a child has been abused or neglected and knowingly fails to make 
a report may be liable for a Class A misdemeanor.108 During the Round Table, it was identified that all 
professionals could benefit from additional mandated reporter training, as there may be some uncertainty 
around what a “reasonable cause to believe” encompasses.  

During Family Team Meetings with DFPS, ensure that a decision maker is present so families can leave 
with a plan.  

As discussed above, DFPS generally utilizes a Family Team Meeting before a child may be removed from 
their home. These meetings enable DFPS to provide a quick, family-involved response to concerns about 
the child’s safety or placement and achieve positive results for the child during the earliest stages of DFPS 
interaction with the family.109 Feedback from the Round Table revealed that sometimes a supervisor from 
DFPS or person with authority to make decisions about a case is not present at these meetings. The lack 
of a supervisor presence can cause a delay in a case. For example, a caseworker often does not have the 
authority to authorize placements or expand/restrict visitation without first staffing the case with their 
supervisor.  

Provide a climate where children and families are served in a trauma-informed manner. 

DFPS staff receive training on “[t]he need to address trauma [as] an important component of effective 
service  delivery.”110  DFPS  currently  offers  trauma-informed  training  “to  assist  families,  caregivers,  and 
other  social  service  providers  in  fostering  greater  understanding  of  trauma-informed  care  and  child 
traumatic  stress.”111  The  Children’s  Commission  supports  the  Statewide  Collaborative  on  Trauma-
Informed Care that helped create the Building a Trauma-Informed Child Welfare System: A Blueprint112 
and  the  TraumaInformedTexas.com  website.  Incorporating  a  trauma-informed  approach  in  all  child 
welfare cases, including cases involving the FACN, is recommended. 

 

26 

Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

Encourage jurisdictions to establish pre-petition legal representation programs. 

Quality  legal  representation  can  help  guide  a  family  through  the  often  confusing  and  sometimes 
complicated process of a DFPS investigation. During the Listening Session, parents reported they did not 
know when they should have consulted with an attorney, but all reported once they did, the attorney was 
able to provide much needed guidance and help. Similarly, pursuant to House Bill 567 (87th Leg. Session), 
once DFPS files a petition requesting required participation in services, the court must appoint an attorney 
to represent the child and parent.113 This is a shift from the appointment of an attorney for a parent and 
child only after DFPS files a petition requesting termination or seeking conservatorship of a child, if the 
parent is found unable to afford the costs of court and appears in opposition of DFPS’ request.114 While 
having attorney representation at a required participation in services will be beneficial to a fair and just 
court process, pre-petition legal representation may be able to divert many investigations from escalating 
to required participation or removal.  

During  the  Listening  Session  and  Round  Table,  parents  indicated  that  at  the  start  of  their  DFPS 
investigation, they had no reason to distrust DFPS and complied with requests during the investigation. 
As the process continued, they struggled with understanding what was happening, what their rights were, 
and what actions they could take against DFPS. During a DFPS investigation, circumstances can change 
very quickly from the time an investigation is launched to when a petition is filed. This time period is vital 
to a family and the sooner they know their rights and can rely on an attorney to help guide them; the 
more  likely  successful  outcomes  can  be  achieved  by  all  involved.  The  need  for  pre-petition  legal 
representation  is  not  unique  to  the  FACN.  Early  representation  is  likely  to  benefit  all  families  who 
encounter DFPS.  

Explore state, regional or local programs that offer support through parent advocates, mentors, or other 
support programs for parents going through the child welfare process. 

Being  involved  with  DFPS  when  facing  child  abuse  or  neglect  allegations  can  be  a  confusing  and  scary 
period for a family. Additional guidance and support can be offered through a parent mentor or other 
support program. Parent advocacy groups can help promote the safety, well-being, and permanency of 
families by empowering parents to be engaged.115  

Currently,  the  Texas  Legal  Services  Center  operates  the  Family  Helpline  where  lawyers  with  DFPS 
experience  are  available  to  answer  questions  which  parents  or  families  have  concerning  the  DFPS 
process.116 Additionally, DFPS with the help of the statewide Parent Collaboration Group provides support 
to parents through local Parent Support Groups that provide information to parents currently receiving 
DFPS services and which a liaison from DFPS attends to help explain the DFPS process.117 Each of the 11 
regions of Texas have one parent support group, with most groups meeting one to two times a month.118 
Beyond these resources, there is not currently a statewide parent mentorship program in Texas.  

Any  statewide,  regional,  or  local  program  that  is  developed  should  operate  independently  of  DFPS. 
Families should be allowed to choose and work with an advocate, mentor, program, etc. and participation 
should  be  voluntary.    State,  regional,  or  local  mentorship  or  support  programs  for  parents  would  be 
beneficial but would likely require additional funding. As noted above, this is a broad recommendation 
that could benefit parents in all child welfare cases but parents involved in a complex medical case may 
require specialized expertise to navigate these systems.

Senate Bill 1578 (87th Leg. Session) Report 

Identify opportunities to increase parental access to experts. 

At the Listening Session and the Round Table, parents identified a financial barrier to being able to hire an 
expert. A parent who is found by the court to be unable to pay costs may have their attorney petition the 
court to authorize the payment for an expert. However, some parents may be able to afford counsel but 
lack adequate funds to hire an expert. Additional funding for expanded parental access to medical experts 
should be explored so that parents have the opportunity to present evidence supporting their position. 
This  challenge  is  not  unique  to  complex  medical  cases,  but  the  likelihood  of  expert testimony  may  be 
greater in these cases.  

The FACN is a resource that is designed to help DFPS receive input from medical specialists on whether a 
child’s condition is related to abuse or neglect. SB 1578 required DFPS and the Children’s Commission to 
evaluate the department’s use of the FACN and develop joint recommendations for improvement. The 
Listening  Session  and  Round  Table  brought  together  a  diverse  group  of  people  including  medical 
professionals,  child  welfare  professionals  and  advocates,  legal  representation,  and  parents  to  have  a 
balanced discussion around this complicated topic. The ideas generated and recommendations laid out in 
this report are intended to spur positive changes and encourage increased transparency. Additional steps 
and  support  for  implementation  of  the  recommendations  made  in  this  report  will  require  a  similarly 
balanced approach. Through collaborative efforts, the FACN can continue to improve and meet the needs 
and goals that are set out for it to accomplish.

In this report, the term “complex medical cases” refers to cases that mimic child abuse or neglect which include, 
but  are  not  limited  to,  physical  abuse  or  medical  neglect  by  the  parent  (also  referred  to  as  Munchausen’s 
syndrome by proxy). The term is used throughout the report in direct reference to DFPS investigations with 
referrals to the Forensic Assessment Center Network.

Forensic Assessment Center Network Evaluation 

Background 

The Forensic Assessment Center Network (FACN) was a result of Senate Bill 6 

(Nelson) of the 79th Regular Legislative Session and was implemented in FY 

2006 as a  joint  project of DFPS  and the University of Texas Health  Science 

Center – Houston. FACN is available for Department of Family and Protective 

Services  (DFPS)  staff  as  valuable  resources  which  provide  expert  opinions 

from  child  abuse  pediatrician's  on  whether  a  child’s  injuries  or  condition  is 

abuse or neglect related.  

As  a  result  of  these  requirements,  effective  September  1,  2005  and  2009, 

FACN  and  MEDCARES  Pediatric  Centers  of  Excellence,  respectively  were 

approved for appropriation.  

FACN: Sec. 266.003.  MEDICAL SERVICES FOR CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT 

VICTIMS:  

(a)    The  [Health  and  Human  Services]  commission  shall 

collaborate  with  health  care  and  child  welfare  professionals  to 

design a comprehensive, cost-effective medical services delivery 

model, either directly or by contract, to meet the needs of children 

served by the department.  The medical services delivery model 

must include:  

(1)  the designation of health care facilities with expertise 

in  the  forensic  assessment,  diagnosis,  and  treatment  of 

child abuse and neglect as pediatric centers of excellence; 

(2)  a  statewide  telemedicine  system  to  link  department 

investigators  and  caseworkers  with  pediatric  centers  of 

excellence or other medical experts for consultation;  

MEDCARES:  Sec.  1001.151.    TEXAS  MEDICAL  CHILD  ABUSE  RESOURCES 

AND EDUCATION SYSTEM GRANT PROGRAM: 

1 

Forensic Assessment Center Network Evaluation 

(a) 

The  department  shall  establish  the  Texas  Medical  Child  Abuse 

Resources and Education System (MEDCARES) grant program to award 

grants for the purpose of developing and supporting regional programs 

to improve the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of child abuse and 

neglect.  

87th Legislative Requirements 

Senate Bill 1578, 87th Legislative Session (2021), amends the Texas Family 

Code  (TFC)  261.3017,  regarding  abuse/neglect  investigation  consultations 

involving  possible  bone  or  tissue  related  conditions  by  the  Forensic 

Assessment Center Network (FACN). 

The MEDCARES grant program was not funded this legislative session.  

The Texas Family Code, as amended by the bill, prohibits DFPS from using a 

health  care  provider  from  FACN  or  another  healthcare  system  for  forensic 

assessment services on a child abuse/neglect investigation if that provider is 

the reporter on the case. 

The  Texas  Family  Code  (TFC)  no  longer  allows  FACN  to  make  referrals  for 

specialty consultations when DFPS or FACN determine that a child requires a 

specialty  consultation.  TFC  is  amended  to  permit  the  following  persons  to 

recommend specialty consultation referrals, in addition to DFPS: 

•  The  child's  primary  care  physician  or  other  health  care  provider  that 

provided health care or treatment or otherwise evaluated the child; 

•  The child's parent/legal guardian; OR 

•  The parent/legal guardian's attorney. 

The law does not prohibit the parent/legal guardian from obtaining a second 

opinion from a physician or other health care provider of their choice. DFPS is 

required  to  accept  and  consider  the  alternative  opinion  when  making  a 

2 

Forensic Assessment Center Network Evaluation 

determination regarding abuse or neglect of the child.  DFPS documents the 

analysis  and  determinations  made  by  the  second  opinion  in  their  case 

management system. 

The bill alters DFPS's ability to remove a child under exigent circumstances, 

based solely on the opinion of a medical professional under contract with DFPS 

who  did  not  conduct  a  physical  examination  of  the  child,  and  broadens  the 

medial  opinions  a  court  must  consider  in  making  a  child  abuse  or  neglect 

determination.  

In addition, this bill requires DFPS to evaluate its use of FACN with assistance 

from  The  Children’s  Commission  of  Texas  (CCTX).  CCTX  will  host  a  diverse 

round table meeting to discuss DFPS’s use of the FACN network with external 

stakeholders, FACN, attorneys, and DFPS staff. DFPS will provide information 

on the FACN program, related policy, practice, current FACN contract, current 

utilization,  historical  background,  and  the  changes  related  to  legislative 

mandates. 

After  the  round  table  meeting,  CCTX  will  compile  recommendations  on  the 

FACN  program  and  submit  these  recommendations  in  a  final  report  to  the 

legislature.  DFPS  will  provide  educational  information  for  the  report  and 

include any additional recommendations outside of those provided by CCTX. 

Forensic Assessment Center Network 

FACN is a coordinated group of physicians from six medical schools in Texas 

who are experts in child abuse and neglect.  Child Abuse Pediatricians (CAPs) 

are  highly-trained  physicians  available  for  consultation  to  children  and 

adolescents with suspected child abuse and neglect injuries.  FACN physicians 

provide written consultations for the cases they review, including their expert 

medical  opinions  of  whether  abuse  or  neglect  occurred.  The  FACN  provides 

consultations  for  several  programs  within  DFPS  including  Child  Protective 

3 

Forensic Assessment Center Network Evaluation 

Investigations 

(CPI),  Child  Protective  Services 

(CPS),  Child  Care 

Investigations (CCI), and Adult Protective Services (APS).  

he  FACN  is  primarily  used  by  CPI  caseworkers  in  cases  of  suspected  child 

abuse and neglect. FACN physicians also provide ongoing training to CPI and 

CPS workers about issues surrounding child abuse and neglect. DFPS staff are 

encouraged to obtain timely medical consultations when necessary, as well as 

documenting and applying the expert opinions to case decisions. 

he goal of the network is to make medical professionals, with expertise in 

child  abuse  and  neglect,  more  readily  available  to  advise  caseworkers. This 

network  fills  in  gaps  when  no  local  pediatric  abuse  and  neglect  experts  are 

available.  The  network  helps  DFPS  staff  make  decisions  about  child  safety 

during investigations. 

urrently, DFPS works with the following medical institutions: 

University of Texas Health Science Center - Houston 

UT Southwestern Medical Center – Dallas 

UT Health Science Center – San Antonio 

UT Medical Branch – Galveston 

Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center – Lubbock 

Dell’s Children Medical Center – Austin 

he  Forensic  Assessment  Center  Network  (FACN)  is  a  valuable  resource 

through which DFPS staff can obtain expert medical opinions to increase the 

accuracy of investigation conclusions.

DFPS  has  a  contract  with  The  University  of  Texas  Health  Science  Center  at 

Houston to create resources that improve the Child Protective Investigations 

(CPI), Child Protective Services (CPS), and the Child Care Investigations (CCI) 

Divisions. This allows access to medical professionals that provide expertise 

in the diagnosis of child abuse/neglect. Access to such expertise is intended 

to support DFPS staff in making decisions relating to the presence/absence of 

child abuse/neglect during CPI/CCI investigations and CPS cases.  

The goals of the FACN contract are to provide the following: 

•  Statewide access to forensic medical consultation services to DFPS staff 

•  Expert testimony regarding child abuse/neglect diagnoses in DFPS cases  

•  Ongoing statewide training on the medical aspects of abuse/neglect to 

DFPS staff and others identified by DFPS 

The  FACN  contract  administrators,  within  DFPS,  have  granted  eligible  FACN 

and DFPS staff access to the telemedicine system. The contract administrators 

use various campaigns to increase awareness and familiarity of FACN for DFPS 

raining for DFPS staff CPI/CPS & CCI caseworkers 

The FACN contract stipulates that FACN develops and provides training at least 

once  a  year  for  each  region.    FACN  currently  provides  training  on  an  as-

requested basis to each region in DFPS.  The FACN physicians and providers 

can present on the following topics on child maltreatment but not limited to: 

Anal/ genital trauma 
Asphyxiation/ strangulation 
Bruising/ petechiae (except anogenital) 
Burn 
Child pornography 

Fracture 
Ingestion/ poisoning

FACN Utilization 

In FY2020, 7041 individualsi (the majority of whom were children), had a “visit 

dateii”with FACN. Of those, 6,967 individuals matched to 6,496 DFPS stages 

in FY2020.

f the 6,496 stages and 6,967 children noted above, 5,368 investigations and 

5,797 children were involved with Child Protective Investigations.  Not all of 

the matched stages involved children as victims for a variety of reasonsv. 

ACN  Physicians  are  available  twenty-four  hours-a-day,  seven  days-a-week 

to provide consultation on acute cases, and during regular business hours to 

review non-acute cases. FACN physicians identify that at least one issue for a 

child is “substantial” or “concerning” 12% and 41% of the time respectively 

during a Child Protective Investigation. Non-specific findingsvi, which could be

a substantial level of concern for maltreatment, the likelihood the investigation 

will be referred for Family Based Safety Services (FBSS) or closed outright is 

at a higher rate of 66%.

Policy has been updated as required by the passing of the legislation. 2232 
Making a Referral to the Forensic Assessment Center Network 

DFPS is required by statute to contract with Texas medical schools and 
hospitals that comprise the Forensic Assessment Center Network 
(FACN). FACN includes physicians who specialize in child abuse and 
neglect. The goal of the network is to make medical professionals with 
expertise in child abuse and neglect more readily available to advise 
caseworkers in cases with complicated medical issues.  

The network provides all of the following: 

•  Case consultation. 

•  Forensic assessment (including medical evaluations). 

•  Training about issues surrounding child abuse and neglect. 

•  The following types of testimony for court proceedings: 

• 

• 

In cases where FACN physically evaluated a child, the FACN 
physician may testify as a medical witness. 

In cases where FACN only reviews records, the FACN physician 
may testify as an expert witness. 

DFPS staff in the following divisions have access to the FACN: 

•  Child Protective Investigations (CPI) 

•  Alternative Response (AR) 

•  Conservatorship (CVS) 

•  Family-Based Safety Services (FBSS) 

•  Child Care Investigations (CCI) 

While CPI and AR primarily use the FACN as a resource, all programs 
have access and can use the FACN. 

When FACN Reports Abuse or Neglect 

If an FACN health care practitioner makes a report of abuse or neglect 
of a child, that health care practitioner cannot be used to also conduct 

11 

Forensic Assessment Center Network Evaluation 

a forensic assessment on the same child. The caseworker may still 
interview the original health care practitioner as a principal or 
collateral. 

If an FACN health care practitioner makes a report, this does not 
disqualify other FACN health care practitioners from conducting the 
forensic assessment. 

For definition of health care practitioner, see the CPS 
Handbook’s Definitions of Terms. 

 

2232.1 When and When Not to Make a Referral to FACN 

Caseworkers may make a referral to FACN when they need additional 
clarification on abuse or neglect cases to address child safety decisions 
or to ask general ongoing medical questions. A caseworker does not 
need approval from any of the following people to request an FACN 
consult: 

•  The child’s parent. 

•  The attorney representing the child or parent. 

•  The child’s primary care physician or other health care practitioner.  

When CPI Must Make a Referral to FACN 

Caseworkers must make a referral to FACN in the following 

circumstances: 

•  There does not appear to be any reasonable explanation for a 

child’s injury or the explanation is not consistent with the injury. 

•  A child requires an in-person forensic assessment examination. 

•  The caseworker needs assistance to determine whether abuse or 

neglect occurred. 

•  There is a difference of opinion between a medical professional and 
DFPS regarding whether abuse or neglect occurred, or about the 
seriousness of an injury or condition, and clarification is needed. 

•  There is evidence of medical child abuse (also known as 

Munchausen syndrome). 

•  The caseworker has a question about abuse or neglect that a 

medical professional may be able to clarify. 

12 

Forensic Assessment Center Network Evaluation 

•  A child younger than 11 years old has a sexually transmitted 

disease (STD), and there is not a preponderance of evidence that 
abuse led to the STD. See 2360 Medical Vulnerability. 

•  Near-fatality cases when the treating physician is not a child abuse 

pediatrician. 

Using FACN in this way is not the same as a specialty consultation. 
See 2232.2 Specialty Consultations. 

Making the Referral to FACN 

Emergency 
The caseworker must immediately contact the FACN by phone (1-888-
TX4-FACN). This contact is available 24 hours a day and seven days a 
week for acute cases. See the FACN Resource GuidePDF Document. 

Non-Emergency 
If the caseworker and supervisor decide to make a referral to FACN for 
a non-acute case, the caseworker must enter the basic referral 
information into the FACN systemExternal 
Link (www.facntx.orgExternal Link) or by phone (1-888-TX4-FACN) 
within two business days during regular business hours. 

When FACN Indicates Abuse or Neglect 

The FACN physicians’ input must be taken into consideration in 
determining abuse or neglect of a child. 

If FACN indicates that abuse or neglect occurred, the caseworker must 
immediately meet with the supervisor and program director to ensure 
the appropriate safety intervention is taken to keep the child safe. 

When there are differing opinions between medical professionals as to 
whether abuse or neglect occurred, the caseworker must do the 
following: 

•  First, establish safety of the child. 

•  After establishing the safety of the child, staff with the caseworker’s 

chain of command and legal to determine next steps. 

See FACN Resource Guide. 

When Not to Make a Referral to FACN 

13 

Forensic Assessment Center Network Evaluation 

A caseworker must not refer a child in DFPS conservatorship to FACN 
for standard medical care, including direct examinations or medication 
services. 

Caseworkers generally do not need to make a referral to FACN when 
both of the following criteria are met: 

•  The child has already been seen by a local physician who is certified 

as a child abuse and neglect specialist. 

•  There are no additional questions or concerns. 

 

2232.2 Specialty Consultations 

FACN can recommend a specialty consultation, but FACN may not 
make a referral for the specialty consultations. If FACN recommends a 
specialty consultation, DFPS obtains the information from the child’s 
digital file in FACN. DFPS reviews the recommendation and determines 
if a referral is needed based on all the information in the investigation. 

A specialty consultation referral may be requested by any of the 
following: 

•  The primary care physician or other health care practitioner that 

provided health care or treatment or otherwise evaluated the child. 

•  The child’s parent or legal guardian. 

•  The parent or legal guardian’s attorney. 

DFPS must refer a case for a specialty consultation in cases of abuse 
and neglect in conjunction with the diagnoses below: 

•  Rickets. 

•  Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. 

•  Osteogenesis-imperfecta. 

•  Vitamin D deficiency. 

•  Other medical conditions that mimic child maltreatment or increase 

the risk of misdiagnosis of child maltreatment. 

The specialty consultation must be completed by a physician who is 
licensed in Texas and board-certified in the field relevant to diagnosing 
and treating the conditions described. The physician must not be the 
original reporter of suspected abuse or neglect. 

14 

Forensic Assessment Center Network Evaluation 

If DFPS makes the determination to refer a child for a specialty 
consultation, DFPS must work with the family to provide them with the 
referral. 

Before making the referral for a specialty consultation, the caseworker 
must provide written notice of the name, contact information, and 
credentials of the specialist to one of the following people: 

•  The child’s parent. 

•  The attorney representing the child or parent.  

The child’s parent, or the attorney representing the child or parent, 
may object to the referral and request an alternative specialist. The 
caseworker and family collaborate to select an acceptable specialist. 
However, the caseworker may refer the child to a specialist over the 
objection of the family. The caseworker must first get approval from 
the supervisor to refer the child to a specialist over the objection of the 
family. 

The family is not prohibited from seeking an alternative opinion at 
their own expense. If the family seeks a second medical opinion, the 
caseworker must accept and consider this alternative opinion and 
document it in the contact narrative in IMPACT. 

2232.3 Documenting Results from FACN Consultations 

The caseworker must document in the FACN contact narrative in 
IMPACT: 

•  All information received from FACN related to child safety. 

•  All results from the consultation with the FACN physicians including 

specialty consultations. 

The caseworker must document in a contact narrative any case 
staffing with the supervisor and program director regarding: 

•  The results of the medical consultations. 

•  Any differing medical opinions between consulting medical 
professionals.  

The caseworker must upload all medical records and any other 
documentation provided by FACN or a medical provider into OneCase. 

 

15 

Forensic Assessment Center Network Evaluation 

2232.4 Requesting an Extension While Awaiting FACN Response 

The caseworker must request an extension if unable to submit the 
investigation to the supervisor for approval within 45 calendar days 
from intake. If an extension is needed, the caseworker uses the 
extension code Medical Records. See 2291.6 Extension Request. 

2232.5 Removing a Child Based on FACN Consult 

Exigent removal of a child may not be based solely on the opinion of a 
medical professional under contract with DFPS who did not conduct a 
physical examination of the child. However, if both the physician who 
conducted the physical examination and the FACN physician agree that 
abuse or neglect occurred, then both opinions may be used for an 
emergency removal. 

5412.11 Exigent Circumstances and Imminent Danger 

Exigent circumstances mean that, based on the totality of the 
circumstances, there is reasonable cause to believe that the child is in 
imminent danger of physical or sexual harm if the child remains in the 
home, and the situation requires immediate action.   

Imminent danger means there is an immediate threat to the child’s 
physical health or safety, or that sexual abuse is about to occur to the 
child. A child is in imminent danger if the caseworker has reason to 
believe that either of the following is true: 

•  The child’s life or limb is in immediate jeopardy. 

•  Physical abuse is about to occur. 

•  Sexual abuse is about to occur. 

A caseworker only considers an emergency removal before obtaining a 
court order when the child is in imminent danger. When determining 
whether the danger is truly imminent and requires immediate action, 
the caseworker looks at various factors, including, but not limited to, 
those described in the following table. 

Specific Considerations 

Factors to 
Consider 
Is there time to 
obtain a court order? 

After the caseworker and supervisor have weighed everything they know about 
the immediate danger to the child, they consider whether the time it takes to 
obtain a court order would place the child in imminent danger. If the child would 
be placed in imminent danger, then an emergency removal before obtaining a 
court order is appropriate. 

Consider All Circumstances 
The caseworker and supervisor must consider all of the circumstances in the 
case. The fact that the courthouse is closed does not automatically support a 

16 

Forensic Assessment Center Network Evaluation 

What is the nature of 
the abuse or 
neglect? 

removal before obtaining a court order. The fact that the courthouse is open 
does not automatically require that a court order be obtained before the 
removal. 

The caseworker and the supervisor must consider the severity, duration, and 
frequency of the abuse, based on the evidence for one or more of the following: 

•  The extent of harm or potential harm. 
•  How recently the abuse occurred. 
•  Whether the abuse was committed against multiple children. 
•  Whether there is a pattern of abuse or the abuse was an isolated 

incident. 

•  Whether there is a condition that requires immediate medical attention. 
•  Whether the parents have an inability or incapacity to meet the 

child’s immediate needs. 

In the Case of Neglect 
When there are only allegations of neglect, the decision of whether to remove 
before obtaining a court order must be based on a determination of whether the 
child is in imminent danger of abuse or serious harm, based on the information 
discovered in the initial investigation, regardless of whether the imminent 
danger is from physical abuse, sexual abuse, or another type of abuse or 
neglect. This could include but is not limited to: 

•  Serious harm because of dangerous home conditions. 
•  Parents being under the influence of a controlled substance and the child 

being unable to protect himself or herself because of age or some other 
factor. 

•  The parents being arrested or unable to be located, with no appropriate 

relatives or fictive kin available to care for the child. 

•  The source of the allegations. 
•  Whether the allegations have been corroborated. 
•  All other evidence the caseworker can gather before making a 

determination about an emergency removal, such as: 

Information available in IMPACT about the family. 

• 
•  Other open stages of service and information from other caseworkers. 
• 

Information from law enforcement and other professionals, including 
medical professionals. 

•  Any additional information that can be gathered while protecting the 

child’s safety. 

Families with a History of DFPS Involvement 
A history of DFPS involvement with the family is not enough, in and of itself, to 
support a conclusion that the danger to the child is immediate. The question is 
not whether DFPS has been involved, but whether DFPS’s involvement 
supports a conclusion that the child is in danger now. 

Cases Involving Assessments by the Forensic Assessment Center 
Network (FACN) 

17 

How strong is the 
evidence supporting 
the allegations? 

The caseworker and the supervisor consider whether the allegations are 
reliable in light of the strength of the evidence supporting them. Such 
considerations include: 

An exigent removal of a child may not be based solely on the opinion of a 
medical professional under contract with DFPS who did not conduct a physical 
examination of the child. However, if both the physician who conducted the 
physical examination and the FACN physician agree that abuse or neglect 
occurred, then the use of both opinions may support an exigent removal. If the 
examining physician is a FACN physician, the forensic assessment must be 
conducted by a different FACN physician or another physician trained in 
diagnosing abuse and neglect. See 2232 Making a Referral to the Forensic 
Assessment Center Network. 

The caseworker must consider whether there are objective indications that the 
parent will flee with the child, such as: 

•  A threat made by the parent to that effect. 
•  A prior DFPS history of the parent fleeing. 
•  A parent who is visiting Texas, rather than living in Texas. 

DFPS must make reasonable efforts to prevent removal; that is, efforts that are 
consistent with the circumstances and provide for the child’s safety. See Texas 
Family Code §262.101External Link. 
When removal is being considered, the caseworker must attempt to implement 
a solution to the family’s problems that is less extreme than an involuntary 
removal, as long as the child’s safety can be assured. 

Possible solutions may include: 

•  A safety plan that would enable the child to remain in the home while still 
protecting the child. This may include removing the alleged perpetrator 
from the home. 

•  Providing family-based safety services. 

When considering removal’s effects on the child, the safety of the child must 
always take priority. 

Is there a risk that 
the parent will flee 
with the child? 

Is there a less 
extreme solution to 
the problem? 

What harm to the 
child could result 
from removal?

4323.1 Obtaining Medical Records 

The investigator requests that the parent provide a medical release 
and requests the medical records during an investigation when the 
allegations being investigated include any of the following: 

Injuries requiring medical treatment. 

• 
•  Serious physical abuse. 
•  Medical neglect. 
•  Physical neglect. 
•  Sexual abuse, if the child received an exam by a sexual assault 

nurse examiner. 

•  A fatality. 
•  A near fatality. 

18 

Forensic Assessment Center Network Evaluation 

If a child in DFPS conservatorship receives medical treatment or dies, 
the investigator works with the child’s caseworker to obtain the 
records. 

If the child is not seen by a medical professional, the investigator must 
consult with a medical professional to obtain a professional opinion of 
the child’s medical condition. 

The investigator may need to obtain the following types of medical 
records, depending on the allegations being investigated: 

•  Records from emergency medical services. 
•  Emergency room and other hospital records. 
•  Records from the child’s primary care physician. 
•  Records from a specialist who provides care or treatment to a child. 
•  Records from a sexual assault nurse examiner. 
•  Autopsy report and other related records from the medical 

examiner, if the child is deceased. 

•  Star Health records. 

5320 Investigation of a Child’s Near Fatality  

Any time a child suffers a near fatality while in care, CCI investigates to 
determine whether abuse or neglect was a factor in the child’s near 
fatality. 

When the investigation of a child’s near fatality occurs in a residential 
child care facility, the investigator must do the following: 

•  Add the facility’s administrator as an alleged perpetrator of neglectful 

supervision. 

•  Determine if there is a preponderance of evidence that the 

administrator engaged in a negligent act or omission that contributed 
to the near fatality. 

If the treating physician is not a child abuse pediatrician, the investigator 
may request consultation with a Forensic Assessment Center Network 
(FACN) physician in order to do the following: 

•  Assign a severity level of Near Fatal. 
•  Determine whether the injury or medical condition was a result of 

abuse or neglect.

i The vast majority of these individuals were children. There are a very small number of times (6 in FY2020) when the 
individual involved was technically an adult. In 5 of these instances the individual was a severely disabled adult. For 
the other instant the “visit date” provided – which is actually a “file upload” date, involved a subsequent clinic visit 
for a child previously seen by FACN as a child.   
ii “Visit Date” is not always the date that a child was seen, or the date that the FACN provided feedback to DFPS 
about a child. Rather, it is the date they uploaded a date file to the FACN system about the interaction they had 
regarding the child. Many times, it is within 1-2 days of the interaction, but there are some instances where it is 
many  months  removed  from  the  interaction.  As  an  example,  one  child  (who  was  deceased)  had  three  “visits”  – 
actually case consultations – recorded. Each one was >3 months after the child’s death. The issue with the FACN 
system recording the upload date, rather than the actual visit date in a reportable way is a system limitation of the 
FACN database. 
iii Includes other stages in DFPS, Child Care Licensing, Residential Care Licensing, and other. 
iv Of the 12 remaining “Other” stages, two were purged cases whose date could not be determined, one was related 
to an “Information and Referral Call” about a child who was previously the alleged victim in an investigation into the 
child’s  death.  Four  involved  the  “Adult  Foster  Care”  program,  and  five  involved  the  “Adult  Protective  Services” 
program.   
v These reasons include, but are not limited to: Contact with FACN during one of the following: 

a) 

Investigation in which the individual is not an alleged victim, or where the investigation has not yet closed 
(321 individuals) 

b)  Substitute Care Case (274 individuals) 
c)  Family Preservation Case (242 individuals) 
d)  Alternative Response case (105 individuals) 
e) 
f)  Other situations (6 individuals) – purged case/involvement as child on Family Reunification or Family Sub 

Intakes in which the individual is not an alleged victim (60) 

care Stage without the child being in care at the time of the visit.

Sometimes  these  contacts  are  follow-ups  from  the  original  contact  which  occurred  during  an  investigation. 
There are also instances where the child is a sibling of a victim child, but they themselves are not identified as a 
victim  in  the  investigation.  Still  other  times,  the  matched  case  may  appear  odd  because  the  “visit  date”  is 
actually a proxy date (technically the date of file upload) provided by FACN since the system was not designed 
in such a way as to give the actual date of contact. 

No evidence of maltreatment, or an explanation other than abuse or neglect is likely; 
At risk for maltreatment; 
Insufficient information available, therefore unable to determine whether child was abused or neglected; 
No allegation of abuse or neglect (physician consulted for a non-maltreatment question). 

vi   Nonspecific determinations are those which may result from abuse or neglect, but accidental/natural explanations 
are also possible. Less concerning findings captured under the “Other” category include:  
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
vii Sometimes additional information changes the FACN level of concern to a higher – or a lower level. However, 
whether you look at the most concerning FACN level of concern during the investigation, or the most concerning 
FACN  level  of  concern  for  the  last  FACN  contact  with  a  child  during  the  investigation,  these  percentages  do  not 
change by more than +/- 2% 
viii  Percentages  shown  in  the  table  are  the  number  of  investigations  in  each  cell,  divided by  the  total  number  of 
investigations for the row.  i.e.  Of the investigations where the most concerning determination during the stage was 
“Concerning”, 20% ended up going to Family Preservation, since 454/(260+454+1518) = 454/2232 = 20%

Investigations (CPI), Child  Protective Services (CPS) Divisions, and the Child Care 
Licensing (CCL) Division of □ FPS access to medical professionals that have expertise 
in the diagnosis of child abuse or neglect.  Access to such expertise is intended to 
support □ FPS staff in making decisions relating to the presence/absence of child 
abuse/neglect during CPI/CPS and CCL investigations.  The goals of the Contract are 
to provide: 

•  Statewide access to forensic medical consultation services to □ FPS staff; 
• 
•  Ongoing statewide training on the medical aspects of abuse and neglect to 

Expert testimony regarding child abuse/neglect diagnoses in  □ FPS cases; and 

□FPS staff and others identified by □ FPS. 

ARTICLE 1 - DEFINITIONS 

The following terms will have the meanings indicated in this Article: 

1.1  Case Consultation - The communication including verbal, written and/or 

electronic, between □FPS staff and FACN staff pertaining to a referral.  This 
consultation results in a final written assessment submitted by the FACN to

by deposition, telephone, teleconferencing, or in person by a Medical Expert 
regarding a FACN referral or assessment. 

1.3  Forensic Medical Assessment - The provision of medical services, which may 
include a history, physical examination, diagnostic testing and treatment, 
resulting in a determination of whether a physical injury or condition resulted from 
or was likely to have resulted from  abuse or neglect of a child, including whether 
the injury was inflicted or accidental, the injury was or was not consistent with a 
given explanation, the condition is or is not developmentally appropriate, etc. 
Besides providing medical services, this assessment may also include a case 
consultation, written assessment, and expert testimony.  □FPS is not responsible 
for any costs associated with the medical services provided. 

1.4  Medical Expert - A healthcare provider who meets the following criteria: 

1.4.1 

Is independently licensed to diagnose and treat medical conditions in the 
State of Texas (e.g., nurse practitioner, physician or physician's assistant) 

1.4.2  Is certified in pediatrics by a nationally recognized board; 
1.4.3  Has received additional training in child abuse and neglect, beyond 

general pediatric training; 

1.4.4  Regularly evaluates children for alleged abuse or neglect as part of his or 

her routine pediatric practice; and 

1.4.5  Is either board-certified in Child Abuse Pediatrics by the American Board 

of Pediatrics (a "CAP"), or is supervised by a CAP. Supervision 
constitutes, at minimum, shared participation or timely review of all cases 
involving serious bodily injury and/or hospitalization 

1.5  Regional Case Consultation_- A meeting comprised of FACN and Regional 
DFPS staff, in which FACN staff are available to informally discuss case 
scenarios.  Any specific case(s) discussed at this meeting that results in a case 
consultation or written assessment and has not yet been referred to FACN prior 
to the meeting must result in an additional referral(s) to FACN. 

1.6  Referral - A  request made by DFPS of FACN, via the web-based system or the 

toll free number, to request a case consultation and written assessment of a child 
abuse or neglect case.  The assessment is usually based on a review of 
available records.  There are three types of referrals: 

1.6.1  Routine Referral - Any referral to FACN that is not an Emergency or 

Complex Referral. 

1.6.2  Emergency Referral - Referrals that are needed quickly, as determined 
by DFPS.  Examples include but are not limited to: a child that has 
suffered serious physical injury; a child that is not expected to survive; a 
child that is in intensive care;  a child that is in immediate risk of serious 
physical injury or sexual abuse: or a written assessment is needed to 
support the removal of a child from the home: and 
1.6.3  Complex Referral - Referrals that involve voluminous
