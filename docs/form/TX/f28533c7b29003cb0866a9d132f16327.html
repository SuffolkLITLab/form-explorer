      <pre>THE STATE OF THE TEXAS JUDICIARY

AN ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS

The Honorable Nathan L. Hecht
Chief Justice
The Supreme Court of Texas

March 23, 2021 

My fellow Texans:

As Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Texas, I am required by law at 
the commencement of each regular legislative session to deliver a message on 
the  state  of  the  Texas  Judiciary,  evaluating  the  courts’  accessibility,  future 
directions, and needs. This is my fourth occasion to do so. Ordinarily, the State 
of the Judiciary address is delivered before a joint session of the Legislature in 
the House Chamber. This year, the continued COVID-19 pandemic prevents 
that. I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak to you through video from 
my chambers in Austin.

Courts Must Remain Open

Texas’ first reported case of COVID-19 was on March 4 of last year in Fort 
Bend  County.  Just  nine  days  later,  a  state  of  emergency  was  declared  by 
President Trump for the nation and by Governor Abbott for the State. No one 
knew then the historic challenges that lay ahead, how they would test us, or 
what we would do to meet them. In the Judiciary, we knew this: justice cannot 
sit out a crisis. Family friction doesn’t disappear in a crisis; sadly, it mounts. 
Crime doesn’t stop in a crisis. Housing and job needs, care for children and the 
elderly, veterans’ appeals for benefits, basic civil legal needs of the poor—all the 
things courts handle every day in good times are even more critical in a crisis. 
Closing the courts was not an option. We could limit operations to emergencies 
for only a few days. Courts, like everyone else, had to adapt.

The first step was to give courts flexibility. The Texas Supreme Court and 
Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  immediately  issued  their  first  Emergency  Order, 
invoking authority enacted by the Legislature in 2009 following Hurricane Ike 
and expanded last session based on what we learned from Hurricane Harvey.

That Order authorized courts to change deadlines and procedures, allow those
involved in a proceeding to participate remotely, and conduct proceedings in
different locations. Courts could adjust routine processes to continue to function
in the new reality.

At  the  same  time,  courts  needed  guidance.  The  Emergency  Order  also
required  courts  to  use  their  flexibility  to  avoid  exposing  court  staff,  parties,
attorneys, jurors, and the public to COVID-19. Texas has 3,220 judges in 1,192
court locations, visited every day by some 325,000 people—1% of the population
—most of whom don’t come by choice. Courts are the busiest convener in the
government. Courts should not force people seeking justice to risk their health
to get it. In a pandemic of historic ferocity, courts sought the expertise of health
officials, state and local, to develop protocols for conducting court proceedings
safely. 

Remote Proceedings

And  courts  needed  new  tools.  Just  before  the  disaster  declaration,  the
Office  of  Court  Administration  had  the  foresight  to  begin  acquiring  Zoom
licenses for all Texas judges. I had never used Zoom; I doubt many judges had.
I thought “zoom” meant to hurry. But remote video-conferencing, which started
statewide one year ago today, allowed courts to continue to process cases with
some efficiency while minimizing health risks to participants.

It’s one thing to have a Zoom license; it’s another to know how to use it, as
the “I am not a cat” hearing in District Judge Roy Ferguson’s court showed.
Training programs and webinars developed by judges and court staff offered
solutions for setting dockets and conducting hearings. Last May, Collin County
District Judge Emily Miskel oversaw the first completely virtual jury trial in the
country—actually, in the world, as far as we know—for which Chief Justice John
Roberts presented her the Rehnquist Award for judicial excellence. Since then,
Texas courts have conducted 35 virtual jury trials. Texas has been a national
leader in utilizing remote proceedings, with more than 3.5 million participants
so  far.  Last  month  Johnson  County  Court  at  Law  Judge  Robert  Mayfield
conducted the one-millionth Zoom hearing in a Texas court.

Remote proceedings achieve important efficiencies. They save time and
money,  sparing  lawyers,  parties,  and  witnesses  from  having  to  go  to  the
courthouse  for  every  hearing.  And  here’s  a  benefit  we  didn’t  expect.  Lots  of

-2-

people involved in court proceedings often find it impossible to attend: they can’t
afford  to  miss  work,  arrange  for  childcare,  and  get  transportation  to  go
downtown and sit at the courthouse waiting for hours to be heard. So they just
don’t go; they default. But with remote proceedings, “going to court” is as easy
as  clicking  on  a  link  or  dialing  a  number  on  a  smart  phone.  We’ve  watched
participation rates in high-volume dockets like child custody and traffic cases
flip from 80% no-shows to 80% appearances. Judges report that few parties are
kept from participating by a lack of access to technology—the so-called digital
divide. And Texas courts are working to close that divide by providing court
participants better access to technology, like iPads to jurors. And there’s another
plus. You can watch remote proceedings on YouTube, giving the public a ringside
seat in every courtroom, increasing transparency and accountability.

We must bring lessons learned in this crisis to the “new normal.” Not all
court  proceedings  can  be  conducted  remotely,  but  many  can  be,  and  must
continue to be. The Supreme Court has convened a working group to identify
best practices for remote proceedings going forward. Senator Zaffirini’s SB 690
and Chairman Leach’s HB 3611 will ensure that scores of statutes on the books,
written  without  technology  in  mind,  will  not  impede  improved  access  and
efficiency in the justice system.

Jury Trials

We’ve shown that jury trials can be virtual in many cases—like traffic
offenses, other simple misdemeanors, and civil cases with few witnesses and
issues. Those cases accounted for some 40% of all jury trials in 2019. For parties
waiting to be reached for an in-person jury trial, a virtual jury trial offers them
their day in court. Virtual trials will continue to play a role in the “new normal”
as a more cost-effective and convenient way for parties to present their case to
a jury of their peers.

Jury trials in felonies and other serious criminal cases, as well as more
complex civil cases, will still be in person. In 2019, Texas courts tried roughly
9,000 cases to verdict; in the past year of the pandemic, we tried 239. We’ve gone
from some 186 jury trials per week to 4. This is not for want of effort by courts.
Courtrooms  aren’t  built  for  social  distancing,  which  requires  lots  of  space  to
qualify and question scores of potential jurors in each case, and modifications to
spread everyone out. Judges have worked very hard to convene juries safely.
Participants in state court proceedings have only occasionally tested positive,

-3-

and there have been no reports of spreading. But the danger is still there. In one
federal jury trial in Texas last fall, at least 15 participants became infected,
including jurors, attorneys, and court staff. We are working hard to resume in-
person jury trials, but we must also work safely.

You can choose for yourself whether to risk greater exposure to COVID-19,
but courts cannot thrust that increased risk on jurors and others who have no
choice  about  appearing  in  court  and  would  stay  away  if  they  could.  As
vaccinations increase, so will the number of jury trials, and soon.

Backlogs

The future beckons. Except for jury trials, Texas courts have mostly kept
current. Fewer civil cases, small claims, and traffic cases are pending today than
before the pandemic. Backlogs have increased somewhat in criminal cases and
family cases, but all courts are working hard to reduce them. More backlogs will
come, with jury trials that courts must work through, and an expected surge in
new case filings held off during the pandemic. With only current resources, we
estimate it may take three years to completely catch up. This is unacceptable,
and I have asked the Legislature for increased funding for retired and former
judges to help us move more quickly. 

Access to Justice

Some 5.2 million of our poorest Texans qualify for basic civil legal services
—help with things like housing, jobs, children’s welfare, guardianships, domestic
violence, and sexual assault. The pandemic has only sharpened these needs.
Last fall, Governor Abbott designated $4 million in federal relief funds for legal
aid. For the next biennium, the Supreme Court’s budget funds basic civil legal
services  at  the  same  level  as  in  past  years  and  includes  $10  million  from
dedicated funds for sexual assault victims, as well as $6 million for legal aid for
veterans. The Supreme Court has asked for an additional $4 million per year,
$1  million  per  year  of  which  will  be  designated  for  veterans’  legal  aid.  We
estimate the extra appropriation will help more than 7,000 additional people
obtain essential legal services, including some 1,800 veterans. We cannot allow
access to justice for the very poor to falter just when they need it most. And we
can expect that as criminal jury trials resume, the need for funding indigent
criminal  defense  required  by  the  Constitution  will  also  increase.  I  urge  the
Legislature to fully fund all these needs.

Bail Reform

We have a bail crisis in Texas. Governor Abbott has declared reform an
emergency. In many Texas courts, a criminal defendant too poor to afford cash
bail remains in jail, even if charged with a minor, non-violent offense and no
threat to the public. The vast majority of people in jail are awaiting trial and
have not been found guilty. In the past 27 years, the percentage of the Texas
county jail population awaiting trial has more than doubled, from around 32%
to over 83%. Who pays to keep these defendants in jail? Taxpayers.

At the same time, a criminal defendant who can afford cash bail can buy
his release, even if he is charged with a serious, violent offense and has several
priors, without regard to whether he is a danger to the public. And when he re-
offends while on release, who pays? Victims, society, all of us.

Haywire? Yes. But worse, it’s wrong to lock up people only because they’re
poor.  It  offends  basic  notions  of  liberty  and  humanity.  And  it’s  dangerous  to
release  defendants  only  because  they  can  afford  to  make  bail.  There  is  a
straightforward  fix.  First,  give  courts  validated,  pretrial,  risk-assessment
information  for  all  defendants  so  judges  can  make  better-informed  decisions
about bail. Second, ask voters to amend the Texas Constitution to allow judges
to  hold  high-risk,  potentially  violent  defendants  without  bail.  Third,  provide
pretrial supervision for those released. And fourth, collect data to verify that the
system is working as it should. I continue to urge the Legislature to reform the
criminal pretrial release system following these four principles.

Eviction Diversion

The  inability  to  pay  rent  hurts  tenants  and  landlords  alike.  Twenty
percent of Texas’ renting households report being behind on rent; 1.5 million of
them  doubt  they  can  pay  next  month’s  rent.    Governor  Abbott’s  Eviction
Diversion Program, operated through the Texas Department of Housing and
Community Affairs, is using $1.2 billion in federal stimulus money to provide
Texans rent relief. About 25% has been spent, benefitting landlords, tenants,
and whole communities, as well as reducing the burdens on the court system.
You  can  learn  about  the  Program  and  apply  for  benefits  at  this  website:
texasrentrelief.com. The Supreme Court will continue to provide procedures to
encourage  landlords  and  tenants  to  take  advantage  of  the  Program  and  to
facilitate distribution of the funds.

Garnishment

The  Texas  Constitution  of  1876  exempted  basic  wages  paid  by  cash  or
check from seizure by creditors to safeguard their use for basic living expenses.
Today,  because  payments  are  often  by  direct  deposit,  they  do  not  have  the
protection our State’s founders believed was important. Threatened seizures of
federal stimulus funds paid to cover basic living expenses during the pandemic
only called attention to the need to modernize wage protections. The Judicial
Council has proposed an update to the basic constitutional exemption. I urge the
Legislature  to  enact  HB  3613  by  Chairman  Leach  and  SB  644  by  Senator
Zaffirini to provide this needed modernization.

Mental Health

For years, the Judicial Council and the Legislature have worked together
for meaningful reforms in our mental health system. With legislative support,
the Judicial Commission on Mental Health has collaborated with stakeholders
statewide, including Senator Joan Huffman and Representative Joe Moody, to
make  further  recommendations  for  ensuring  that  those  with  mental  health
conditions in our justice and municipal courts are mentally competent, that our
successful jail competency restoration programs continue to work well, and that
those with mental health conditions are placed in the least restrictive facilities
to safely receive treatment. Those recommendations are contained in HB 4212
by Representative Moody and SB 1739 by Senator Zaffirini. The Commission has
also made recommendations for improving the use of emergency detention in
mental health crises. I urge the Legislature to pass these important bills.

Juvenile Justice

Children who commit Class C misdemeanors are in the criminal system,
not the juvenile system. If a 12-year-old steals a real car, he is adjudicated as a
juvenile in the civil justice system and faces no criminal penalty. But if he steals
a $10 toy car from a general store, he is prosecuted in the criminal system for a
Class C misdemeanor. This makes no sense. The juvenile justice system provides
judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement many tools to set a child on the right
path that the adult criminal justice system does not. A child who breaks the law
must  certainly  face  the  consequences,  but  the  reason  for  the  juvenile  justice
system is to keep children from being treated as criminals. The Judicial Council
has worked with representatives of the justice and municipal courts, juvenile

-6-

prosecutors, and defense attorneys to propose statutory changes that will help
keep  children  from  spiraling  deeper  into  the  criminal  justice  system  while
holding them accountable for their actions. Senator Perry has filed SB 512, and
Representative  White  HB  3660,  to  enact  these  recommendations.  I  urge  the
Legislature to consider them.

Racial Prejudice

Amidst  the  pandemic,  we  have  been  reminded,  again,  that  the  justice
system faces a far worse disease than COVID-19, a disease that is not novel but
all too chronic and familiar: the disease of racial prejudice. Outcries last summer
charged that the justice system is not fair, and just as importantly, not perceived
to be fair. The charges cannot be ignored. They demand self-examination and
response from all who serve justice. Texas courts are taking a hard, clear look
at themselves, and we will keep doing so. We will gather data to determine how
the justice system is working in fact. We will encourage better training of judges.
We will work to improve the public trust and confidence in the courts that is
absolutely essential to the administration of justice.
 

Challenges Met

I  am  in  my  40th  year  of  judicial  service,  President  of  the  national
Conference of Chief Justices, and Chair of the National Center for State Courts.
Every day I work with judges across the country to ensure the justice system is
working. I will tell you this: the people of Texas can take deep pride in their
judges—municipal judges, justices of the peace, county judges, district judges,
the courts of appeals, and my colleagues on the high courts. They have stood to
the  historic  challenges  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  The  courts  are  open  and
dispensing justice.

Judges  and  court  staff  have  served  at  personal  sacrifice.  Many  have
contracted  COVID-19  themselves.  At  least  four  of  my  colleagues  have  died:
Lubbock County District Judge Ruben Reyes, Wise County Court at Law Judge
Melton Cude, Falls County Justice of the Peace Jack Smith, and Jasper Justice
of the Peace Jimmy Miller. All were just and fair jurists, highly regarded in their
communities. In addition, several court clerks, court staff, and constables have
also succumbed to COVID-19. For them, and for others for whom COVID-19 has
been more than a risk, has been a tragic reality, I ask that we observe a moment
of silence.

Conclusion

We will defeat the pandemic. We will return to normal. For the Judiciary,
it will be a new normal, one with even greater promises of justice for all. My
fellow Texans: the state of the Judiciary is strong, resilient, moving ahead, and
committed to the innovations a fair, efficient system of justice for all demands.

God bless you, and may God bless Texas.
