      <pre>TENTH COURT OF APPEALS LEAVE POLICIES 

verview of State of Texas Employee Leave System 

The  employee  leave  system  is  considered  an  exception-based  system  of  time  keeping.  An 
employee automatically accrues certain types and amounts of leave time on a monthly basis but is 
expected to report and account for any exception to the accrual. 

t is Tenth Court of Appeals policy that every employee must request approval from his  or her 
supervisor before being absent from work.  Every employee has the responsibility to submit the 
request for leave to the Court's supervisory personnel designated to complete the necessary leave 
reports required by the State of Texas. 

xempt employees (all legal staff and the Clerk of the Court)  must  also  submit  a  request for 
leave  for  any  leave  or  sick  time  used.  A  legal  staff’s  request  for  leave  is  submitted  to  the 
assigned justice. 

he Chief Justice rules on request for leave for the Clerk of court and his/ her staff attorneys. 

pecific Types of State Leave 

1.  Annual Leave 

Annual leave, or paid vacation time, is accrued on a monthly basis and determined by length of 
service.  Employees with less than two years of service accrue 8 hours of paid vacation time per 
month; employees with more than two years of service accrue 9 hours per month, and up to 21 
hours a  month  for a 35+  year  employee.  An  employee  may carry certain amounts of  annual 
leave time into a new fiscal year up to an established maximum that, if not used, automatically 
converts to sick leave.    The  monthly  Employee  Leave  Summary  states  when an  employee 
is  reaching  an  automatic  conversion  point.  Additional  information  may  be  found  on  the 
website for the Employees Retirement System of Texas, www.ers.state.tx.us. 

lthough annual leave accrues from the first date of employment, vacation with pay may not be 
taken until an employee has been continuously employed for six months.  An employee who has 
been  continuously  employed  for  six  months  and  who  then  resigns,  is  dismissed,  or  otherwise 
separates from state employment is entitled to be paid for accrued and unused vacation time. 
 

2.  Sick Leave 

A  State  employee  accrues  sick  leave  at  the  rate  of  8  hours  per  month  from  the  first  day  of 
employment.  Unused accrued sick leave can be carried forward annually.  Sick leave is available 
for an employee's illness, injury, pregnancy, confinement, and for when an employee must care 
for a member of his or her immediate family who is actually ill. 

n employee who is absent from work due to an illness must notify his or her supervisor at the 
earliest practicable time.  To be eligible for accumulated sick leave,  with pay,  for a  continuous 
period  of  more  than  three  working  days,  an  employee  must  provide  a  doctor's  certification, 
without violating the provisions of HIPPA, and must provide an acceptable written statement of 
facts about the absence.  For less than three continuous days of sick leave without a reduction in

pay,  the  Chief Justice has the discretion to require a doctor's  certificate,  without  violating  the 
provisions of HIPPA, or an acceptable written statement of facts about the absence. 

ith reasonable advance notice to the employee’s supervisor, an employee may use up to eight 
hours  of  sick  leave  each  calendar  year  to  attend  parent-teacher  conference  sessions  for  the 
employee's child or children who are in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade. 

or  medical/dental  appointments,  a  non-exempt  employee  should  first  request  approval  to  be 

absent from work. 
 

3.  Compensatory Time 

1.  Working    More    Than    40    Hours    a  Week.  The Fair Labor Standards Act 
applies to Texas employees.    This means that a non-exempt employee is entitled to 
compensation  for  any  hours  worked  in  excess  of  40  hours  in  one  work  week. 
Compensation may be in the form of either 1.5 hours per each hour worked in excess 
of 40 hours or, at the discretion of the employing state entity, pay  at the rate of 1.5 
times  the  regular  pay in effect for the employee when the excess time was worked.  
The Court's overtime policy only allows for the  possibility of earning compensatory 
time  off  under  specific  circumstances;  earning  additional  pay  for  overtime  is  not 
available. 

Paid leave or holidays taken during a work week are not counted as  hours  worked 
in  determining  FLSA  overtime  hours.    Any  compensatory  time  earned  must  be 
used within 12 months of the end of the work week in which it was earned,  or  the 
employee  loses  the  time. 

ompensatory time off for exempt employees is within the discretion of the judge to 

whom the exempt employee reports. 

2.  Working National or State Holidays 

For  each  fiscal  year,  the  State  of  Texas  publishes  a  list  of  three  types of  holidays: 
national, state, and optional.    An employee is entitled to a paid day off from work 
for each national or state holiday that does not fall on a Saturday or Sunday, and if 
the employee is not on unpaid leave. 

he  Court  is  officially  closed  on  all  national  holidays,  the  Friday 

following 
Thanksgiving  Day,  December  24th  and  December  26th,  when  those  days  fall 
on  a  weekday.  The Court is also closed on dates that are not designated as official 
State of Texas holidays when the State of Texas Comptroller’s office is closed and 
on McLennan County holidays when the courthouse is officially closed. 

ays designated  as  state  holidays  are  considered  Skeleton  Crew  Holidays.  When 
the  Court  is  open  it  is  required  to  have  enough  employees  on  duty  to  conduct  its 
official  business.    An  employee  who  works  a  Skeleton  Crew  Holiday  is  entitled  to 
compensatory  time  off  during  the  12-month  period  following  the  date  worked.

Employees  are  required  to  give  reasonable  advance  notice  when  taking  this 
compensatory time, although the reason for the request is not required. 

very  year,  the  State  designates  some  religious  holidays  such  as  Rosh  Hashanah, 
Yom  Kippur,  and  Good  Friday  that  fall  on  weekdays  as  Optional  Holidays.  An 
employee  may substitute  an Optional Holiday for a Skeleton Crew Holiday during 
the same fiscal  year  as  the  Optional  Holiday  worked. 

n addition, the Chief Justice may allow an employee to observe Cesar Chavez Day 
as a state holiday, instead of another state holiday that falls on a weekday when the 
agency  must  remain  open  for  business  at  minimum  staffing  levels  (i.e.,  a  Skeleton 
Crew Holiday). 

3.  Emergency  Leave  -  Policy  Guidelines  for  Emergency  Leave  Program  (TEX. 

GOV’T CODE 661.252 & 661.902, 661.923) Effective: 9/1/17 

Program Purpose 
Pursuant  to  Texas  Government  Code  §  661.252,  the  following  are  guidelines  to 
establish the circumstances under which an employee may be entitled to or granted 
emergency  leave  provided  by  Tex.  Gov’t  Code  Chapter  661.  The  Court  leave 
provisions  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  the  following  supplement  is 
provided: 

mergency Leave:  The Chief Justice may grant emergency leave for a reason other 
than  a  reason  described  under  section  661.902(a)  of  the  Texas  Government  Code, 
which provides emergency leave because of a death in the employee’s family. 

• 
• 

he Chief Justice shall grant emergency leave if: 
the employee requests the leave; and 
the  Chief  Justice  determines  the  employee  has  shown  good  cause  for 
taking  emergency leave; and 
the Chief Justice believes in good faith that the employee being granted the 
leave  intends  to  return  to  the  employee’s  position  upon  expiration  of  the 
leave granted. 

• 

uidelines  for emergency leave are provided  below in this  policy section. 

ot later than October 1 of each year, the Chief Justice or the Chief Justice’s designee 
shall  report  to  the  Comptroller  the  name  and  position  of  each  Court  employee 
granted  more  than  32  hours  of  emergency  leave  during  the  previous  state  fiscal

grandparent, or grandchild of the employee’s spouse.  For the purpose of this policy, 
the  term  sibling  includes  an  employee’s  stepbrother  or  stepsister.  The  employee, 
however, is not eligible for this leave if the employee is in an unpaid absence status 
at the time emergency leave is to commence.  [TEX. GOV’T CODE § 661.902(a)]

amily and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) 

The  Department  of  Labor’s  Fact  Sheet  28  describes  the  rights  and  responsibilities  of  the 
employer and employee under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). General information 
is set out below. 

urpose of FMLA 

FMLA  requires  an  employer  to  provide  an  eligible  employee  with  up  to  12  workweeks  of 
unpaid,  job-protected  leave  during  a  12-month  period  of  time  for  certain  family  and  medical 
reasons.  An  employee  who  takes  FML  must  be  returned  to  the  same  job,  or  a  job  with 
equivalent status, benefits, and pay. 

vailability of FMLA Unpaid Leave 

An eligible employee may take a total of 12 weeks unpaid FMLA leave for: 

the birth and subsequent care of a newborn child; 
the placement of a child for adoption or foster care; 
the need to care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition; 

• 
• 
• 
•  a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to work. 

erious Health Condition 

A  serious  health  condition  is  defined  as  an  illness,  injury,  impairment,  or  physical  or  mental 
condition that involves: 

• 
• 

inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential care facility; 
the absence of  more  than  three  calendar  days  from  work  that  also  involves continuing 
treatment by a health care provider; 

•  any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for prenatal care; 
•  a chronic serious health condition (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.); 
•  a  period  of  incapacity  that  is  permanent  or  long-term,  due  to  a  condition  for  which 

treatment may not be effective (e.g., Alzheimer’s, stroke, terminal diseases); 
• 
any absences to receive multiple treatments that would likely result in incapacity 
for  more  than  three  consecutive  days  if  left  untreated  (e.g.,  chemotherapy,  physical 
therapy, dialysis, etc.). 

ntermittent Leave or a Reduced Work Schedule 
FMLA permits the use of intermittent leave or work on a reduced schedule when: 

•  medically  necessary  to  care  for  a  seriously  ill  family  member,  or  because  of  the

• 

employee’s serious health condition; or 
to  care  for  a  newborn  or newly placed adopted  or foster  care child, if approved  by  the 
employer. 

TATE OF TEXAS AND THE FMLA 

se of Paid and Unpaid Leave 

A State of Texas employee is entitled to FMLA leave, if the employee has a total of at least 12 
months  of  state  service  and  has  worked  at  least  1,250  hours  during  the  12-month  period 
immediately preceding the commencement of leave.    A State employee is required to utilize all 
available paid vacation and sick leave while taking FMLA unpaid leave.  Paid and unpaid leave 
are exhausted concurrently, not consecutively. 

owever,  when  an  employee  on  FMLA  leave  is  also  receiving  temporary  disability  benefits 
payments or workers compensation benefits, the employee is not required to utilize paid vacation 
or sick leave concurrently with the FMLA leave.  TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 661.912 Family and 
Medical Leave Act (effective September 1, 1999) (Vernon  2004); General Appropriations Act, 
75 Leg. R.S., ch. 1452, art. IX, ' 9(14)(a), 1997 Tex. Gen. Laws 5535, 6363. 

ealth Insurance During FMLA Leave 

When  all  paid  leave  has  been  exhausted,  the  State  will  continue  to  pay  its  portion  of  the 
employee’s premium for coverage under the group health plan.  During the unpaid FMLA leave 
period, the employee must pay his or her portion of the insurance premium above the state-paid 
portion.  If an employee fails to return to work after taking FML leave, the State may recover the 
health care premiums it paid on behalf of the employee. 

ffect of FMLA Leave 

Service  credit,  annual  leave,  or  sick  leave  is  not  earned  for  any  full  calendar  months  of  leave 
without pay while on FML.  This time is also not included in the calculation  of  the  number  of 
continuous months of employment for purposes of merit increases and leave. 

ENTH COURT OF APPEALS AND THE FMLA 

alendar Year Used to Calculate Eligibility 

The  12-week  leave  period  is  calculated  forward  starting  on  the  first  day  designated  as  FMLA 
leave. 

esignation of Leave and Notice by Employer 

The Court must designate leave, paid or unpaid, as FMLA-qualifying and will provide notice to 
the employee of the designation.  Once the Court has acquired knowledge that the leave is for an 
FMLA  reason,  the  employee  will  be  notified  that  any  applicable  accrued  paid  leave  will  be 
designated as FMLA leave, will be reported in  the  State’s  timekeeping  system  as  FMLA  leave, 
and  the  leave will  be  counted against the 12-week FMLA leave entitlement. 

otice of the designation should be provided to the employee within two business days.  Leave 
cannot be retroactively designated as FMLA leave unless the employee was absent for an FMLA

reason and the Court did not learn the reason until the employee’s return to work. 

otice by the Employee 

When the need for FMLA leave is foreseeable, the employee is required to provide a written 30-
day advance notice before the leave is to begin.  The notice should include the anticipated timing 
and duration of the leave.  Notice must also be provided as soon as practicable if the dates of the 
leave change, are extended, or were not initially known.  When the need for FMLA leave is not 
foreseeable, notice must be provided as soon as practicable under the particular circumstances. 

hether  the  need  for  FMLA  leave  is  foreseeable  or  not,  the  employee  should  provide 
information sufficient to make the Court aware that the employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave, 
the anticipated timing, and the duration.   Failure to provide notice, with no reasonable excuse for 
the delay, may delay the taking of FMLA leave until at least 30 days after the date the employee 
provides the required notice. 

he Court may inquire further, if it is necessary to have more information about the need for the 
leave.  Any  medical  information  the  employee  provides  will  be  stored  in  the  employee’s 
confidential medical file and kept separate from the personnel file. 

s Soon as Practicable 

As soon as practicable means under the particular circumstances, but, at the least, verbal notice 
should be provided within two business days of when the need for leave becomes known to the 
employee. 

edical Certification Required for Serious Health Condition 

For  a  serious  health  condition,  the  Court  requires  a  medical certification confirming that 
such  a  condition  exists.    Once  leave  has  been  granted,  the  employee  may  be  required  to 
provide  updated  medical  information  on  a  periodic  basis.  To  return  to  work  when  an 
absence  was  caused  by  a  serious  health  condition,  the  employee  must provide  a  fitness-for-
duty certificate from the health care provider. 

ealth Insurance 

Once  the  employee  is  on  unpaid  FMLA  leave,  to  continue  coverage  under  the  State’s  group 
health plan, the  employee must make  arrangements  with  the Court  Administrator to pay his or 
her portion of the employee’s health insurance premium. 

mployee Sick Leave Pool Policy 

The  Employee  Sick  Leave  Pool  (the  Pool)  consists  of  accrued  sick  leave  which  is  voluntarily 
donated to the Pool by eligible employees of the Court. The Pool is intended to assist employees 
and their immediate families in dealing with a catastrophic illness or injury that forces them to 
exhaust  all  earned  leave  time  or  when  the  employee  has  exhausted  all  sick  leave  because  of  a 
previous donation of time to the Pool. 

TATUTORY AUTHORITY 

Pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  TEX.  GOV’T  CODE  ANN.  661.001,  661.008  (Vernon  2004),  the 
Employee Sick Leave Pool Policy is established for the Tenth Court of Appeals.

family,  but  who  needs  care  and  assistance  as  a  direct  result  of  a  documented  medical 
condition.  Any  such  time  requested  and  withdrawn  is  strictly  limited  to  the  time 
necessary to provide care and assistance for the documented medical condition. 

•  Earned leave time means all accrued sick, vacation, and compensatory time. 
•  Pool  Administrator  means  the  individual  appointed  by  the  governing  body  of  a  state 

agency to administer the agency’s sick leave pool. 

DMINISTRATION OF THE POOL 

The Court Administrator  will  serve  as the Pool Administrator and will develop  mechanisms to 
transfer accrued sick leave into and out of the Pool; develop rules and procedures for operation of 
the Pool; and develop forms for contributing leave to, and using leave from, the Pool. 

ENERAL PROVISIONS: 

•  An employee of the Court, other than a state official, is eligible to  use  time  contributed 
to  the  Pool,  if  the  employee  has  exhausted  all  of  the  employee’s  earned  leave  time 
because  of  (1)  a  catastrophic  illness  or  injury  or  (2) a previous donation of time to the 
Pool and, the employee will be forced to lose compensation from the State. 

•  An employee may not receive sick leave from the Pool in excess of one-third of the total 

time in the Pool or 90 days, whichever is less. 

• 

•  An  eligible  employee  may  apply  to  the  Pool  Administrator  for  permission  to  withdraw 
leave time from the Pool for the employee’s own catastrophic illness  or  injury,  or  for  a 
catastrophic illness or injury of a member of the employee’s immediate family. 
If the  employee  is  seeking to withdraw  time  because of  a catastrophic  illness  or injury, 
the  employee  must  provide  the  Pool  Administrator  with  a  written  statement  from  the 
licensed practitioner who is  treating  the employee or  the  employee’s immediate family 
member.    The  statement  must  provide  sufficient  information  regarding  the  illness  or 
injury to enable the Pool Administrator to evaluate the employee’s eligibility.  If the Pool 
Administrator determines that the employee is  eligible, the Pool Administrator shall (1) 
approve the transfer of time from the Pool to the employee  and  (2)  credit  the  time  to

EFINITIONS 

  D

the  employee  on  the  Court’s leave records. 

•  An employee with a catastrophic illness or injury is not required to contribute to the Pool 

before the employee may apply to use Pool leave. 

•  An employee who uses leave from the Pool is not required to pay that leave time back to 

• 

the Pool. 
If the employee is a contributing member of the Pool, the employee may apply to use the 
Pool for other than catastrophic illness or injury, when the employee has exhausted his or 
her sick leave balance in the same fiscal year.  Such employee may receive credit for only 
the number of hours they have contributed to the Pool in the same fiscal year for absences 
other than those caused by catastrophic illness or injury. 

•  An employee  must  exhaust  all  earned  leave time before the employee is  eligible to use 
leave from the Pool.  However, an employee who is off work due to an on-the-job injury 
or  illness  is  not  required  to  exhaust  annual  or  compensatory  leave  before  becoming 
eligible to use leave from the Pool. 

•  An employee who has terminated from the Court due to retirement may  withdraw Pool 
contributions within 90 days of rehire to the Court.  Such employee may receive credit for 
only  the  number  of  hours  the  employee  has  contributed  to  the  Pool  in  the  same  fiscal 
year as retirement. 

•  An  employee  who  is  absent on time withdrawn from the Pool may use the time as sick 
leave  earned  by  the  employee,  and  the  employee  is  treated  for  all  purposes  as  if  the 
employee were absent on earned sick leave. 

•  An  employee’s  request  to withdraw time from the Pool  more than once during  a  fiscal 
year  will  be  reviewed  by  the  Pool  Administrator  on  the  facts  and  documentation 
submitted specific to the necessity for the multiple requests. The facts and documentation 
supporting the request will be submitted to the Clerk and the Chief Justice before a final 
decision is made to grant or deny the additional withdrawal of time. 

•  The estate of a deceased employee is not entitled to payment for unused time withdrawn 

by the employee from the Pool. 

ONTRIBUTING SICK LEAVE TO THE POOL 

•  Contributions to the Pool are strictly voluntary on the part of each employee. 
•  Employees are encouraged to contribute to the Pool. 
•  An employee may contribute to the Pool one or more days of the employee’s accrued sick 
leave.  The Pool Administrator shall credit the Pool with the amount of time contributed 
by the employee and shall deduct a corresponding amount of time from the employee’s 
earned sick leave as if the employee had used the time for personal purposes. 

•  A contribution to the Pool by an active employee must be in increments of eight hours, 
but a retiring employee may contribute accrued sick leave in increments of less than eight 
hours. 

•  A retiring employee may designate the number  of the retiring  employee’s accrued sick 
leave  hours  to  be  used  for  retirement  credit  and  the  number  of  the  retiring  employee’s 
accrued sick leave hours to be donated to the Pool. 

•  An employee who makes a contribution to the Pool may not stipulate who is to receive 

that contribution.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
