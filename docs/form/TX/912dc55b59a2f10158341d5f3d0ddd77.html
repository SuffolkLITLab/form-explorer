ravel time between the employee’s home and regular duty station is not considered work 

Full-time  employees  are  expected  to  take  a  meal  break  of  at  least  30  minutes.  Exceptions 
may be made by supervisors on a case-by-case basis. 

An employee is allowed two paid work breaks of up to 15 minutes each.

All OSPA employees must receive prior approval from their supervisors for all leave, unless it 
is for sick leave.  

ntering Leave in CAPPS 

Employees  must  submit  any  leave  taken  in  CAPP  on  a  month-to-month  basis.  The  prior 
month’s leave must be reported within the first week of the next month. By approving their 
employees’ leave in CAPPS, the SPA certifies the approval of any scheduled leave.  

 

Prior Approval to Earn Compensatory Time or Overtime 

Before earning compensatory time or overtime, employees must complete a Request to Earn 
Compensatory  Time  or  Overtime  form  and  obtain  approval  from  the  SPA,  unless  the 
compensatory time is to be earned on a skeleton crew holiday.  This form must be submitted 
to OCA’s Payroll Department.  

iscretion of Supervisors 

Before requesting leave, employees should ensure that they have adequate leave balances 
and  that  their  absence  will  not  interfere  with  the  performance  of  their  job  duties.  Leave 
approval is not automatic. While every attempt is made to accommodate employees’ timely 
leave requests, the SPA has the authority and responsibility to use their discretion to ensure 
that adequate staff remains on duty to perform the work of the agency. 

When  advance  approval  is  not  possible,  the  employee  must  notify  the  SPA  as  soon  as 
possible of the dates and reasons for the absence. Unless extenuating circumstances exist, 
employees  are  expected  to  notify  the  SPA  of  absences  no  later  than  one  hour  after  their 
scheduled starting time. 

xcessive Absenteeism or Tardiness 

Absenteeism or tardiness is excessive when an employee is unable to adequately perform 
his/her job, or when the normal day-to-day work activities of the office are disrupted due to 
excessive  and/or  unscheduled  absences  or  tardiness  by  the  employee.  Excessive 
absenteeism  or  tardiness  may  be  grounds  for  disciplinary  actions,  up  to  and  including 
termination.

Unauthorized Absence 

An employee who fails to report to or remain at work, or who fails to return to work upon 
expiration of approved leave, may be considered to have abandoned his or her position with 
the agency. Such an employee will be expected to produce a satisfactory explanation for the 
unauthorized absence. An employee who is absent from work for three or more consecutive 
days without contacting his or her supervisor will be deemed to have abandoned his or her 
job at the close  of the  third day. Unauthorized absence(s) may be grounds for disciplinary 
actions, up to and including termination. 

vertime and Compensatory Time 

(See Texas Government Code 659.015, 659.016, 659.022, 659.023) 

Time worked in addition to an employee’s regular work schedule may be credited as overtime 
or compensatory (comp) time depending on whether the employee: 

• 

is designated as exempt or non-exempt under the FLSA; and 

•  has worked 40 hours during the week or has taken any leave during the week. 

Overtime provides an employee with 1.5 hours of paid time off for each overtime hour worked. 
Comp time provides an employee with one hour of paid time off for each comp hour worked. 
An employee’s personal residence shall not be deemed to be the employee’s regular place of 
business or duty point for purposes of earning compensatory time. 

 

FLSA Exempt & Non-exempt Employees 

Overtime eligibility is governed under the provisions of the FLSA. Eligibility is not based on an 
employee’s classification title or pay group, but on the employee’s functional job. FLSA exempt 
employees  are  ineligible  to  earn  overtime  compensation.  FLSA  non-exempt  employees  are 
eligible to earn overtime.  OCA’s Human Resources Department is responsible for determining 
the FLSA designation for each employee. 

arning Overtime 

Non-exempt  employees  earn  overtime  for  time  worked  more  than  40  hours  in  a  week.  To 
earn overtime, the 40 hours must be time worked. Paid time off, such as holidays, vacation 
and sick leave, etc., do not count as time worked  for calculating overtime. For  example, a 
non-exempt employee who works 44 hours during one work week earns 4 hours of overtime. 

arning Compensatory Time – Non-exempt Employees 

Non-exempt  employees  earn  straight  compensatory  time  when  paid  hours  exceed  40  in  a 
work week but the employee has worked less than 40 hours. Once the total of actual hours 
worked reaches 40, the employee begins earning overtime. 

P a g e  5 | 22 

  O

  E

  E

 

 

With proper approval, exempt employees may earn compensatory time for hours worked in 
excess of 40 hours in a work week.  

pproval to Earn Comp Time or Overtime 

All  employees  must  submit  to  OCA’s  Payroll  the  Request  to  Earn  Compensatory  Time  or 
Overtime Form and have prior written approval from the SPA before working comp time or 
overtime.  However,  a  non-exempt  employee  must  be  compensated  for  overtime  even  if  it 
was  not  approved  in  advance.  A  non-exempt  employee  who  works  unauthorized  overtime 
should  be  counseled  or  disciplined  just  as  with  any  other  violation  of  agency  policy.    Prior 
written approval is not required before earning holiday comp time. 

An employee’s work schedule may be adjusted to ensure that the employee does not exceed 
40 hours. For example, an employee who must work 2 extra hours on Tuesday can be required 
to leave 2 hours early on Friday so as not to exceed 40 hours that week. 

vertime Compensation  

The agency compensates non-exempt employees  for overtime by granting them paid time 
off at the rate of 1.5 hours for each overtime hour they earn. A non-exempt employee may 
accumulate overtime credit up to 240 hours (160 hours at time and one half) with no time 
limit on the use of these hours. Payment for overtime is made when an employee separates 
from the agency or when accumulated overtime exceeds 240 hours. Exceptions must be 
approved in advance by the SPA. Exempt employees do not earn overtime.  

aximum Comp Time Accruals  

Comp time is credited as one hour earned for each hour worked. 160 hours is the maximum 
number  of  non-holiday  comp  time  hours  that  can  be  carried  as  a  balance  by  an  employee 
during a 12-month period. The SPA may make exceptions to this provision during periods of 
extended  business activities, such as during a Legislative session. 

P a g e  6 | 22 

f an employee submits a written request to use accrued compensatory time at least 90 days 
before it is scheduled to lapse, the SPA must approve the request as stated, or provide the 
employee with an alternate date on which the employee may use the comp time. Comp time 
must be both requested and used before the date it is due to lapse. If an employee’s comp 
time  is  within  90  days  of  lapsing,  the  SPA  is  encouraged  to  reasonably  accommodate  the 
employee’s use of the accrued comp time before it lapses. Employees will be notified annually 
of this policy on comp time accrual and usage. 

  I

se of Accrued Comp Time Before Lapsing  

Comp time must be used within twelve (12) months of when it is earned or it will be forfeited. 
Comp time is not transferable to another state agency and will not be paid when an employee 
separates from the agency.

TIME AND LEAVE POLICY 
OFFICE OF THE STATE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY 
Implemented November 2017 
 
Earning Compensatory Time – Exempt Employees 

Types  of  Holidays  –  There  are  three  types  of  holidays  to  which  an  employee  is  entitled: 
national, state, and optional. Eligible employees are entitled to a paid day off from work on 
national and state holidays as specified by the Legislature. 

ligibility – Employees are entitled to paid day off from work on a specified holiday if:  

the holiday does not fall on a Saturday or Sunday; and 

the employee is not on Leave Without Pay. 

• 

• 

  E

Skeleton Crew Days – The agency will have a sufficient number of employees on duty during 
a state holiday (skeleton crew day) to conduct the public business of the agency except for 
those state holidays which fall on a Saturday or Sunday, the Friday after Thanksgiving Day, 
and  December  24th  and  26th.  The  SPA  may  use  her  discretion  in  determining  staffing 
requirements on skeleton crew days. Employees who must work on a national or state holiday 
will accrue holiday compensatory time and will be allowed time off during the 12-month period 
following the date of the holiday worked. Employees who work on skeleton crew days must 
enter the number of hours worked in CAPPS to receive credit for this time.  

OSPA  will  maintain  a  skeleton  crew  during  any  non-national  holiday  when  the  State 
Legislature is in session. 

Optional  Holidays  –  An employee  is  entitled  to  paid  leave  to  observe  an  optional holiday 
(Cesar  Chavez  Day,  Rosh  Hashanah,  Yom  Kippur,  or  Good  Friday)  if  he/she  agrees  to 
relinquish a state holiday (skeleton crew day) during that same fiscal year. If the employee 
fails  to  work  a  skeleton  crew  day  in  the  same  fiscal  year,  a  day  of  vacation  leave  will  be 
charged instead. If no vacation leave is available, he or she will lose one day of pay. 

Holiday Before Work Begins or After Work Ends – An individual must be a state employee on 
the  workday  before  and  after  a  designated  holiday  to  be  paid  for  that  holiday,  unless  the 
holiday falls on the first or last workday of the month. 

Part-time Employees – Part-time employees are entitled to the same holidays with pay (on a 
prorated basis) as granted to full-time employees.  

nnual Vacation Leave 
(See Texas Government Code 661.152) 

Eligibility – An employee is eligible to take annual vacation leave with pay after meeting the 
specified requirements: 

•  an  employee  with  no  previous  State  employment  may  take  annual  leave  after 

completing six (6) full months of continuous employment with OSPA; or

•  an employee with previous state employment who has completed six (6) full months 
or  more  of  continuous  state  employment  and  whose  vacation  balance  has  been 
transferred from the other  state agency is eligible to take the accrued annual leave 
upon employment; or 

•  an employee with previous State employment who has a break in service of at least 
30  days  and  has  completed  six  (6)  full  months  or  more  of  continuous  State 
employment may take annual leave as it is earned upon re-employment. 

Rate  of  Accrual  and  Allowable  Carry  Forward  –  The  schedule  below  shows  rates  of  annual 
leave accrual for various lengths of State employment and the maximum number of hours an 
employee  may  carry  forward  each  fiscal  year  beginning  on  September  1st.  The  schedule  is 
based on full-time employment. 

 

 

Employees accrue vacation from their first day of employment. They end this accrual on their 
last day of duty. Duty day means an employee’s last physical date on the job. An employee 
may not accrue vacation time while exhausting vacation time for termination purposes. 

An  employee  in  a  leave-without-pay  (LWOP)  status  for  a  full  calendar  month  does  not 
accrue  vacation leave for that month. An employee on paid or unpaid leave which extends 
into a subsequent month does not earn accrued leave until he/she returns to work. 

Excess Balances – Excess annual leave balances above the amount that can be carried forward 
will be credited to the employee’s sick leave balances on the first day of the new fiscal year. 

Higher Accrual Effective Date – Credit for the higher rate of accrual as shown on the above 
schedule will be given on the first calendar day of the month, if the employee’s anniversary 
date falls on the first calendar day of the month. If the employee’s anniversary date falls after 
the first calendar day of the month, the increase will occur on the first calendar day of the 
following month. 

Part-time  Employees  –  The  number  of  hours  accrued  and  the  amount  of  maximum  carry 
forward allowed for part-time employees will be on a proportionate basis. 

P a g e  8 | 22 

Sick  Leave  Accrual  –  Each  employee  accrues  paid  sick  leave  beginning  on  the  first  day  of 
employment  and  ending  on  the  last  duty  day  of  state  employment.  Duty  day  means  an 
employee’s last physical day on the job.  An employee will be credited with his/her full accrual 
for each full or fraction of a month worked. 

Full-time  employees  accrue  sick  leave  at  the  rate  of  eight  (8)  hours  per  month.  Part-time 
employees accrue sick leave at a rate in proportion to that of a full-time employee. Sick leave 
accumulates with the unused amount carried forward each month, and there is no limitation 
on the amount which may be accrued. An employee in a leave status on the first day of the 
month  may  not  use  sick  leave  accrued  for  that  month  until  after  the  employee  returns  to 
work. 

Use of Sick Leave – An employee is eligible to use sick leave immediately upon employment 
with  the  agency.  Sick  leave  may  be  taken  when  sickness,  injury,  or  pregnancy  and 
confinement prevent the employee’s performance of duty or when the employee is needed to 
care and assist a member of his/her immediate family who is sick. An employee’s use of sick 
leave for family members not residing in that employee’s household is strictly limited to the 
time necessary to provide care and assistance to the spouse, child or parent of the employee 
that needs such care and assistance as a direct result of a documented medical condition. 

Timely Notification – An employee who must be absent from work because of sickness, injury, 
or pregnancy and confinement must notify the SPA at the earliest possible time. If the absence 
is going to be for more than one day, the employee must notify the SPA of his/her status each 
morning, unless other arrangements are made. 

Absence for More Than Three Days – When an employee is off work due to sickness, injury, 
pregnancy, confinement, etc.  for more than three (3) consecutive work days, he/she must 
submit with the leave form a doctor’s statement showing the cause or nature of the illness, 
or some other written statement of the facts concerning the illness, acceptable to the SPA. 

Absence for More than Six Days or Partial Days in a Month – It is the responsibility of the SPA 
to monitor absences to facilitate a determination of whether an employee or his/her family 
member may have a serious medical condition. When an employee is absent for more than 
six days or partial days in any month because of sickness, injury, pregnancy and confinement, 
or medical treatment, the SPA may notify OCA’s human resources department immediately. 
If the employee is entitled to Family and Medical Leave, appropriate steps will be taken by 
the human resources department. See Family and Medical Leave Act section below.  

Excessive Use of Sick Leave – Excessive use of sick leave may be evident when an employee 
uses sick leave as it is accrued and/or totally runs out  of leave (unless due to a bona  fide 
serious  health  condition  as  specified  under  the  Family  and  Medical  Leave  Act),  resulting in 
leave without pay status. 

Birth or Adoption of a Child – An employee who adopts a child under three years of age may 
use  the  amount  of  sick  leave  that  would  be  necessary  to  recover  from  pregnancy  and 
childbirth.  Female  state  employees  may  use  sick  leave  for  pregnancy  and  confinement.    A 
state  employee who is  the father of a newborn child may use his sick leave in conjunction

Parent-Teacher  Conferences  –  An  employee  who  is  a  parent  of  a  child  who  is  a  student 
attending a grade from pre-kindergarten through 12th grade may use up to eight hours of 
sick leave each fiscal year to attend parent-teacher conference sessions for the employee’s 
children. The employee must give reasonable notice to the SPA. 

Transfer  of  Sick  Leave  –  If  an  employee  makes  a  direct  transfer  to  another  state  agency 
without a break in service, the sick leave balance will transfer to the receiving agency. If there 
is a break in service, but the employee is re-employed by the State within 12 months, the 
employee may be entitled to restoration of sick leave balances 

Unused Sick Leave Balance – Once an employee terminates employment with the State, the 
employee is not entitled to payment for any sick leave balance. 

Sick Leave Upon Death – In the event  of  employee death,  one-half of the sick leave balance 
or 336 hours of sick leave, whichever is less, is paid to the employee’s estate if the employee 
was continuously employed at least six months at the time of death.  

xtended Sick Leave 
(See Texas Government Code 661.202) 

Extended  Sick  Leave  –  If  all  leave  balances  are  exhausted,  an  employee  may  request 
Extended Sick Leave. Extended Sick Leave is a form of paid leave and may be granted for the 
same  reasons  as  Sick  Leave.  Exceptions  may  be  authorized  on  an  individual  basis  after  a 
review of the merits of each case. 

Approval of Extended Leave – Authority to approve or disapprove Extended Sick Leave is at 
the SPA and is to be based on the best interests of the agency.  

Eligibility – To be eligible for Extended Sick Leave, an employee must: 

•  have exhausted all sick leave, annual leave, and compensatory/overtime; 

•  be performing job duties at a satisfactory level according to the immediate supervisor 
and as reflected in the employee’s most recent performance Work Review Program; 

•  have used past sick leave in a responsible manner. Sick leave consistently taken as it 
is earned, or failure to maintain sick leave balances without good cause or a pattern 
of being sick on Monday, Fridays, or days immediately before or after a holiday may 
not be considered responsible use; 

• 

indicate intention and ability to return to work after the period of extended sick leave. 

Maximum Allowance – If approved, the length of Extended Sick Leave is determined by the 
employee’s  length  of  employment  with  the  agency  (on  a  prorated  basis  for  part-time 
employees) as follows: 

•  Less than 2 years – A total of 40 hours of Extended Sick Leave may be granted within

ick Leave Pool 

(See Texas Government Code 661.002) 

  S

Purpose  –  The  agency  has  established  a  Sick  Leave Pool  so  agency  employees  may  assist 
other agency employees who have exhausted all paid leave due to a catastrophic injury or 
illness. Sick Leave Pool is a form of paid leave. 

Pool Administrator – OCA’s human resources director is the Sick Leave Pool Administrator. 

Catastrophic  Illness  Defined  –  Catastrophic  illness  is  defined  as  a  severe  condition  or 
combination of conditions affecting the mental or physical health of the employee or a member 
of the employee’s immediate family that requires the services of a licensed practitioner for a 
prolonged time, that forces the employee to exhaust all leave time accrued by that employee, 
and that would cause the employee to lose compensation from the State if additional leave 
were not granted. 

On-the-Job Injuries – This policy does  not  apply  to  employees  injured  on the  job. Those 
employees are covered by  workers’ compensation benefits. 

Pregnancy and Childbirth – Pregnancy, childbirth (including cesarean deliveries), or related 
medical conditions will be treated as any other temporary disability, and will not be considered 
catastrophic under routine and/or normal conditions. 

Requesting Sick Leave Pool – Requests for leave from the Sick Leave Pool must be submitted 
in writing to the SPA and referred to OCA’s human resources director. A doctor’s statement 
must be attached that includes a diagnosis and the proposed length of absence from work. 
This  is  the  same  form  as  the  one  for  FMLA  Medical  Certification.  If  the  request  is  for  an 
immediate  family  member,  the  doctor  should  indicate  the  length  of  time  the  employee  is 
required to assist the family member. 

Employee Donations to Sick Leave Pool – All donations of sick leave hours to the Sick Leave 
Pool are strictly voluntary and are treated as if the employees had used the time for personal 
purposes. The policies governing donations to the pool are: 

•  employees who make donations to the pool may not stipulate who is to receive their 

•  active employees may donate one or more days of accrued sick leave in increments of 

terminating/retiring employees may donate sick leave at the time of separation; 

retiring employees may designate the number of accrued sick leave hours to be used 
for retirement credit and the number to be donated to the sick leave pool. 

Using Sick Pool Leave – An employee may apply to use sick leave from the agency Sick Leave 
Pool provided the catastrophic illness or injury will exhaust all leave, including: 

donations; 

eight hours; 

• 

•

Implemented November 2017 
 

•  Sick; 

•  Annual (if available); 

•  Compensatory/Overtime; and 

•  Extended Sick (if available).  

•  Severity of the illness or injury; 

•  Responsible use of sick leave in the past; 

•  Sustained satisfactory job performance; and 

• 

Intention to return to work. 

Criteria for Approval of Sick Leave Pool Request – Before a Sick Leave Pool request will be 
granted, the following factors will be taken into consideration: 

Approval  must  be  obtained  from  the  SPA.  Requests  will  be  evaluated  in  the  order  in 
which they are received. 

Return  to  Work  –  If  a  physician  releases  an  employee  back  to work or  does  not  provide  a 
statement requesting additional time (subject to the approval of the SPA), and the employee 
does not return to work immediately, the employee will not be paid for the unauthorized time.  

Maximum Amount of Leave Per Request – The maximum amount of leave granted per request 
will be limited to the lesser of 45 working days (360 hours) or one-third of the total time in 
the pool, and is pro-rated for part-time employees. The employee may reapply for additional 
leave if the amount previously granted is insufficient to cover the employee’s absence. The 
subsequent  requests are subject to the same  restrictions as indicated  previously, including 
additional  physician’s  statements.  Although  employees  may  make  additional  requests  for 
leave  from  the  Sick  Leave  Pool,  the  total  amount  granted  for  catastrophic  injury  or  illness 
cannot exceed the lesser of one-third of the total time in the pool or 90 days (720 hours). 

Leave Accruals While on Sick Leave Pool – An employee on Sick Leave Pool status will still 
accrue annual and sick leave at the beginning of each month, but the leave will not be credited 
until the first day of return to duty.  

onation of Sick Leave 
(See Texas Government Code 661.207) 

Purpose – State employees may voluntarily transfer any amount of their accrued sick leave 
to another state employee within the same agency. 

Eligibility – To be eligible, the receiving employee must: 

•  be employed in the same agency as the donor employee 

•  exhaust all available sick leave, including any time granted by sick leave pool 

Prohibitions – State law prohibits: 

•  an employee from providing or receiving a gift in exchange for donated sick leave; 

•  an employee who receives the donated sick leave from using that sick leave except as 
provided  by  Texas  Government  Code,  Sections  661.202(d)  and  661.202(e).  Those

sections allow for the use of sick leave to care for the employee or for members of the 
employee’s immediate family. “Immediate family” is defined as individuals related by 
kinship,  adoption,  or  marriage  who  live  in the  same  household;  foster  children  who 
reside in the same household; and minor children, regardless of whether they live in 
the  same  household.  Sick  leave  may  also  be  used  to  care  for  immediate  family 
members  who  do  not  reside  in  the  same  household  only  for  a  documented  medical 
condition. In that instance only, “immediate family” is interpreted as spouse, parent, 
or child; and   

•  an employee who donates sick leave from receiving credit in the Employees Retirement 
System  of  Texas  for  any  sick  leave  that  is  unused  on  the  last  day  of  the  donated 
employee’s employment.  

Possible Tax Implications - Sick leave donations will be considered a taxable event to the 
donor unless the situation qualifies as a medical emergency according to IRS guidelines. 
IRS guidelines state, “a medical emergency is one that requires an employee’s prolonged 
absence from work, resulting in a substantial loss of income because the employee has 
exhausted  all  of  his  otherwise  available  paid leave.”  Donations  not  qualified  as  medical 
emergencies will be treated as wages for employment tax purposes. Such wages will be 
considered a lump-sum payment and subject to 25% income tax, Medicare, and applicable 
social security withholdings. Employees making a donation are encouraged to consult a 
tax advisor. 

amily and Medical Leave Act 

(See Texas Government Code 661.912) 

Purpose – The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) requires the agency to provide eligible 
employees up to twelve (12) weeks per year off work for the birth, adoption, or foster care 
of a child, or because the employee or a spouse, parent, or child of the employee has a serious 
illness.  State  law  requires  employees  to  utilize  all  sick  and  annual  paid  leave  while  taking 
leave pursuant to this provision, unless they are receiving temporary  disability or workers’ 
compensation benefits.  

Eligibility – For purposes of the FMLA, an eligible employee is one who has been employed by 
the  State  for  at  least  12  months,  and  who  has  worked  at  least  1,250  hours  during  the 
preceding  12  months.  When  calculating  the  required  12  months  of  State  employment  for 
FMLA  eligibility,  all  State  employment  will  be  counted  and  it  need  not  be  continuous.  The 
1,250 hours refers to hours actually worked and does not include any paid time off.  

Conditions – An eligible employee is entitled to a total of  12  work weeks of leave during a 
rolling 12-month period which begins on the date an employee uses any FMLA leave.  FMLA 
leave may be used for: 

• 

• 

• 

the birth of a son or daughter, and to care for the newborn child; 

the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care; 

the care of the employee’s spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition; or 

•  a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions 

of his/her job.

Serious  Health  Condition  –  A  serious  health  condition@  is  defined  as  an  illness,  injury, 
impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves either inpatient care in a hospital, 
hospice, or residential medical care facility or continuing treatment by a licensed health care 
provider.  

12-Week Maximum – Under FMLA, the maximum combination of paid and unpaid leave will 
be limited to 12 weeks. Any extension beyond this period must be requested and approved 
under provisions of the agency Leave Without Pay policy. Failure of the employee to report 
back to work at the end of the prescribed period, without prior written approval from the SPA, 
will be considered leave without pay. Unauthorized absence is grounds for disciplinary action, 
up to and including termination. 

Paid Leave/Unpaid Leave – The FMLA does not entitle an employee to paid leave in addition 
to other types of paid leave already accrued by the employee. Eligible employees must use 
all  appropriate  paid  leave,  annual  and  sick,  while  taking  Family  Medical  Leave.  State 
compensatory time, holiday time, and administrative leave that are benefits of the State may 
be counted toward the entitlement. Federal law does not permit FLSA compensatory time to 
be  used  concurrently  with  Family  Medical  Leave.    If  an  employee  elects  to  use  FLSA 
Compensatory time while out on Family Medical Leave, that time is not counted toward the 
12-week entitlement. After all paid leave is exhausted, employee will be on unpaid leave for 
the remainder of their Family Medical Leave. 

Planned  Medical  Treatment  –  When  the  need  for  leave  is  foreseeable,  based  on  planned 
medical treatment for the employee or family member, the employee must make a reasonable 
effort to schedule the treatment so as not to unduly interrupt the operations of the employer, 
subject to the approval of the health care provider providing the planned care. The employee 
should provide 30 days’ notice, or if not possible, as much notice as is practicable.  

Intermittent Leaves and Reduced Schedules – Leave for the illness of the employee or family 
member  may  be  taken  intermittently  or  on  a  reduced  schedule  when  medically  necessary.  
Leave for childbirth or placement for adoption or foster care may be taken intermittently or 
on a reduced work schedule only with the agreement of the SPA.  

Temporary  Transfer  –  If  an  employee  requests  intermittent  or  reduced-schedule  leave  for 
medical reasons, the SPA may temporarily transfer the employee to an available alternative 
position for which the employee is qualified, and which has equivalent pay, if the alternative 
position better accommodates recurring periods of leave than the employee’s regular position. 

Reinstatement – An eligible employee who takes FMLA leave is entitled to be restored to his 
or her former position, or to an equivalent position with equivalent pay, and other terms and 
conditions of employment.  

Benefit Rights – The taking of leave under FMLA may not result in the loss of any employment 
benefit accrued prior to the date on which the leave commenced.  Nothing in the Act, however, 
entitles an employee to any right, benefit, or position other than one to which the employee 
would have been entitled had the leave not been taken.  

Insurance – The agency will maintain any group health coverage for the employee on leave 
on the same terms as if the employee were at work for the duration of the leave. An employee 
on unpaid leave for an entire calendar month is responsible for paying his/her portion of the 
insurance premium and the State will pay its portion.

TIME AND LEAVE POLICY 
OFFICE OF THE STATE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY 
Implemented November 2017 
 

An employee who is granted an approved leave of absence under this policy may continue his 
or her group insurance coverage by arranging with Human Resources to pay his or her portion 
of the premium contributions during the period of unpaid absence. Employees will be required 
to continue to pay their share of group health benefit costs during the period of leave under 
the law.  

If an employee elects not to return to work upon completion of an approved unpaid leave of 
absence, the agency may recover from the employee the cost of any premiums paid by the 
State  to  maintain  the  employee’s  coverage,  unless  the  failure  to  return  to  work  was  for 
reasons beyond the employee’s control or due to the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a 
serious health condition.  

Certification of Serious Health Condition – An employee requesting leave under FMLA because 
of  his/her  or  a  family  member’s  serious  health  condition  will  be  required  to  provide 
certification  from  the  health  care  provider  treating  the  condition.  The  health  care  provider 
should  provide  detailed  information  regarding  the  condition  of  the  employee  or  family 
member, and also give an estimate of the amount of time needed for the employee’s recovery 
or the amount of time the employee is needed to care for the family member. If intermittent 
leave or a reduced leave schedule is requested, the health care provider should also state the 
dates and duration of planned medical treatment.  

Additional Certifications – An employee may be required to obtain a second certification from 
a health care provider designated or approved by the agency. If the second provider disagrees 
with the first, a third and final opinion might also be required from a jointly selected provider.  

Return to Work – An employee who has been absent due to a serious health condition must 
provide certification from the health care provider that he/she is able to resume work.  

Spouses Employed by Agency – A husband and wife who are eligible for FMLA leave and who 
are both employed by the agency are permitted to take only a combined total of 12 weeks of 
leave during a fiscal year if the leave is taken: 

• 

• 

• 

for birth of a son or daughter or to care for the child after birth; 

for  placement  of  a  child  for  adoption  or  foster  care,  or  to  care  for  the  child  after 
placement; or 

to care for a parent (but not a parent in law) with a serious health condition. 

When a husband and wife each take a portion of the total 12-week leave to care for a parent 
or for the birth, adoption, or placement of a child, each would be entitled to take the remaining 
portion of  the 12-week leave for his/her own serious illness or to care for a sick child. 

Notice of Birth or Placement of a Child – In the case of FMLA leave for the birth or placement 
of a child for adoption or foster care, an employee should provide 30 days’ advance notice 
before  the  date  on  which  the  leave  would  begin,  if  possible.  If  the  employee  is  unable  to 
provide such notice, he or she must provide as much notice as is practicable.  

OSPA Designation – When OCA’s Human Resources has been notified of absences indicating 
that  a  serious  medical  condition  may  exist,  OCA’s  Human  Resources  Director  will  ask  for 
sufficient  information  to  determine  whether  the  employee  is  entitled  to  FMLA  leave.  If  so, 
Human  Resources  will  make  a  preliminary  designation  of  qualification  and  will  notify  the 
employee. The employee will be asked to provide medical certification of the nature of the 
illness or injury and whether it qualifies as a serious medical condition.

Returning to Work Following an Injury or Illness – The OSPA will make every reasonable effort 
to provide suitable return-to-work opportunities for an employee who is unable to perform his 
or her regular duties following a work-related injury or illness. This may include modifying the 
employee’s regular job or, if available, providing temporary alternate work depending on the 
employee’s physical abilities. An employee must obtain a valid return-to-work release from a 
qualified physician and interact with his or her supervisor and Human Resources to determine 
the capacity in which he or she may return to work. 

arental Leave 

(See Texas Government Code 661.913) 

12 Week Maximum – Employees with fewer than 12 months of state service or less than 1,250 
hours in the 12 months immediately preceding the start of leave are entitled to a parental 
leave of absence, not to exceed 12 weeks, for the birth of a natural child or the adoption or 
placement in foster care of a child under three years of age.  This period begins with the date 
of  birth,  or  the  first  day  the  adoptive  or  foster  child  is  formally  placed  in  the  home.  The 
employee must use all available accrued leave before going on leave without pay while taking 
the parental leave. 

Notification  –  An  employee  anticipating  using  parental  leave  should  notify  the  OSPA  and 
OCA’s Human Resources at the earliest possible opportunity to allow ample time to plan for 
covering duties for the duration of the absence.  

FMLA Provisions – Parental leave is only available for employees who are not eligible for FMLA 
leave.  

oster Parent Leave 
(See Texas Government Code 661.906) 

Policy – Any State employee who is a foster parent to a  child under the conservatorship of 
the Department of Family and Protective Services is entitled to a leave of absence with full

of the employee, or to attend the Admission, Review and Dismissal (ARD) meeting held by a 
school district regarding the child.

employee’s  family.  The  employee’s  family  is  defined  as  the  employee’s  spouse,  and  the 
employee’s or spouse’s parents, children, brothers, sisters, grandparents, and grandchildren.

investigation.  

Other Reasons – The SPA may grant  Emergency Leave to an employee for reasons other than 
bereavement if the employee shows good cause and the SPA believes in good faith that the 
employee intends to return to work when the emergency leave ends. The granting of such 
leave is at the sole discretion of the SPA, and is granted only if it is determined to be in the 
best interest of the employer.

Witness Fees – A state official or employee cannot accept or  receive a fee for appearing as a 
witness  in  his/her  official  capacity  in  any  judicial  action  or  legislative  investigation.    If  the 
appearance as a witness is not  in an official capacity but is to testify from personal knowledge

customary fee.  

Approval  –  After  jury  duty  or  testimony  is  completed,  the  employee  should  submit

schedule. 

Workday Exercise Schedule – The employee’s workday exercise schedule should be approved 
by the SPA. The best time to exercise during a workday may vary by employee as well as by

schedules that will not be disruptive to the agency’s workload. 

Deviations from the Schedule – Any individual deviations from the schedule involving taking 
leave to exercise at a different time from the one scheduled must be coordinated in advance

Documentation of EW Leave – Employees must document the time spent during the workday 
for exercise in CAPPS using the time reporting code of EXERT. 

Employee Misconduct – This policy shall not be used as an excuse to arrive to work late or to 
leave early without engaging in the scheduled exercise. Any employee who abuses this policy 
will be subject to disciplinary action.  

pproved Leave Without Pay 

(See Texas Government Code 661.909) 

  A

Leave Without Pay Defined – Approved Leave Without Pay (LWOP) is the temporary absence 
from duty of an employee who intends to return to work. During the length of the absence, 
which cannot exceed 12 months, pay is suspended.  

their 
Request from Employee – Employees requesting Leave Without  Pay  must  submit 
request  in  writing  to  the  SPA.  If  approved,  the  request  will  be  forwarded  to  OCA’s  Human 
Resources.  The request must include a start date and an ending date. The request must also 
include  the  reason  for  the  request,  and,  if  for  medical  reasons,  it  must  include  a  doctor’s 
statement and any other detailed justification that adequately explains the  reasons for the 
request.  

Review by Administration – All requests for Leave Without Pay will be reviewed for approval 
by  the  SPA.  Approval  of  the  request  is  not  automatic.  The  requested  leave  time  may  be 
disapproved or adjusted to meet the business needs of OSPA. If the request is disapproved 
or adjusted, and the employee is unable or declines to remain on the job, the agency may 
take appropriate action to terminate employment.  

Return  to  Work  –  Although  approval  of  Leave  Without  Pay  constitutes  a  guarantee  of 
employment  upon  return,  such  a  guarantee  is  subject  to  fiscal  constraints.  Upon  return  to 
duty, the employee may be placed anywhere in the agency, and his/her salary level is not 
guaranteed.  Employees are  expected to return to work immediately upon the expiration of 
the approved dates for Leave Without Pay, unless they have requested and received approval 
for an extension.  

Failure to Return to Work – Failure to return to work from Leave Without Pay on the approved 
return date will be considered abandonment of position, and the agency may take appropriate 
action to terminate employment.  

Exhausting Available Paid Leave – All available accumulated paid leave entitlements must be 
exhausted before granting Leave Without Pay, except leave as a result of disciplinary actions, 
active military duty, or Workers’ Compensation. Sick leave must be exhausted before going 
on leave without pay status only if the leave is for a reason for which the employee is eligible 
for sick leave.  

Leave Accruals and Insurance Premium – If an absence  covers an entire calendar month, 
the employee does not accrue any vacation or sick leave. The employee is also responsible 
for payment of his/her insurance premiums (unless excepted under provisions of the FMLA).  
A full or partial calendar month during which an employee is on leave without pay does not 
constitute  a  break  in  continuity  of  employment.  Except  for  an  employee  returning  from 
military  leave  without  pay,  a  full  calendar  month  during  which  an  employee  is  on  leave

without pay is not counted in computing total state service for purposes related to longevity 
pay  or  to  the  rate  of  accrual  of  vacation  leave;  or  continuous  state  service  for  purposes 
related to merit salary provisions or vacation leave.  

Exceptions to Policy – The SPA may grant exceptions to these provisions when it is deemed 
to be in the best interest of the State, such as when the leave is to work for another state 
governmental entity under an interagency agreement, or for educational purposes.
