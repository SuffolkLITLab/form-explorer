      <pre>Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 

Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 
 

PPEAL NO.: 

22-007 

ESPONDENT: 

 
 
DATE: 

 
 

296th District Court 
 
July 21, 2022 

 

 
 
 

PECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge  Stephen  B.  Ables,  Chair;  Judge  Missy  Medary;  Judge 
Dean Rucker; Judge David L. Evans; and Judge Ana Estevez  

Petitioner  submitted  a  records  request  to  Respondent  on  March  17,  2022  (the  “March 
request”). The March request was denied and subsequently became the subject of our decision in 
Rule  12  Appeal  No.  22-003.  In  April,  prior  to  the  release  of  Decision  No.  22-003,  Petitioner 
requested from Respondent two additional sets of records:  

•  “all  records  in  [Respondent’s]  office  regarding  the  [March  request],  to  include 

communications about that request[;]” and  

•  “all records concerning [Petitioner’s client] and/or [Petitioner] since [Respondent] 

received the [March request].”  

For the first set of records, Respondent answered that the request was “overbroad, constitutes the 
matter currently pending in [Rule 12 Appeal No. 22-003], and [did] not include Judicial records.” 
For the second set of records, Respondent replied that the records were not judicial records and 
that they were confidential under Rule 12.2(f) (internal deliberations exemption). Respondent also 
added that “to the extent [the records were] sent to or received from an attorney for legal advice or 
assistance[,] such [records] are confidential attorney-client communications.” Petitioner then filed 
a  petition  for  review.  Petitioner  contested  Respondent’s  determination  that  the  request  was 
overbroad, and observed that he was “unaware of any authority suggesting that records relating to 
a proceeding under Rule 12.9 are themselves exempt from disclosure.” Respondent, in its reply to 
Petitioner’s petition, informed the special committee that the records sought, to the extent they 
existed, were not judicial records because Petitioner and Petitioner’s client were participants in an 
“underlying court case.” Respondent stated that some of the responsive communications addressed 
Rule 12 Decision No. 22-003 and the March request, and that the communications were attorney-
client privileged. Petitioner then submitted a reply to Respondent’s reply, citing Rule 12.6(d) in 
arguing that “[i]f nothing else, the letter headings, signature lines and/or email addresses of any 
responsive documents would not be covered by attorney-client privilege.” Petitioner requested that 
the special committee review the responsive records in camera to determine what portions should 
be redacted. Respondent provided the special committee the responsive records for our in camera 
review.  
 

Rule 12 applies to “judicial records,” those records “made or maintained by or for a court 
. . . in its regular course of business but not pertaining to its adjudicative function[.]” Rule 12.2(d). 
Moreover, a record “created, produced, or filed in connection with any matter that is or has been 
before a court is not a judicial record.” Rule 12.2(d). After reviewing the records, we conclude that 
they do not pertain to Respondent’s adjudicative function, and have not been created, produced, 
or filed in connection with a matter before a court. They thus fall within the definition of a “judicial 
record” under Rule 12 and are facially subject to it.

Nevertheless, even where a record is facially subject to Rule 12 as a judicial record the rule 
itself may be inapplicable to the record by Rule 12’s own terms. Rule 12 does not apply to records 
that are subject to a rule of evidence. Rule 12.3(a)(1)(c). Thus, attorney-client communications 
that are privileged under Rule 503 of the Texas Rules of Evidence (TRE) are not subject to Rule 
12. See Rule 12 Decisions No. 22-001 and No. 08-006. TRE 503(b)(1) holds that a client has a 
privilege  to  refuse  to  disclose  and  to  prevent  any  other  person  from  disclosing  confidential 
communications made to facilitate the rendition of professional legal services to the client between 
the client or the client’s representative and the client’s lawyer or the lawyer’s representative. TRE 
503(a)(1) holds that a “ ‘client’ is a person [or] public officer . . . that (A) is rendered professional 
legal services by a lawyer; or (B) consults with a lawyer with a view to obtaining professional 
legal services from the lawyer.” Having reviewed the withheld records in camera, we conclude 
the records consist of information privileged under TRE 503.  
 

Petitioner cites Rule 12.6(d) in urging that at least some materials in the records be released. 
We note that the attorney-client privilege extends to an entire communication. See, e.g., Huie v. 
DeShazo, 922 S.W.2d 920, 923 (Tex. 1996); In re Valero Energy Corp., 973 S.W.2d 453, 457 
(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, orig. proceeding). Once established, the privilege extends 
to the entire document, not merely to the specific portions relating to legal advice or opinions. In 
re Toyota Motor Corp., 94 S.W.3d 819 (Tex. App. San Antonio 2002, orig. proceeding) (citing 
Pittsburgh Corning Corp. v. Caldwell, 861 S.W.2d 423, 425 (Tex. App. Houston [14th Dist.] 1993, 
orig.  proceeding).  With  the  sought-after  emails  being  subject  to  attorney-client  privilege  and 
extending to the entire document, then, the records in toto are not subject to Rule 12. Accordingly, 
we can neither grant the appeal from the denial of the responsive records nor sustain the denial of 
access to them.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
