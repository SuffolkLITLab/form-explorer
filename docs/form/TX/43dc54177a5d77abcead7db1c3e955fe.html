      <pre>Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 
Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 

APPEAL NO.: 

19-006

RESPONDENT: 

Coffee City Municipal Court 

DATE: 

August 9, 2019 

SPECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge Stephen B. Ables, Chairman; Judge Ray Wheless; Judge 
Olen  Underwood;  Judge  Billy  Ray  Stubblefield;  Judge  Susan 
Brown  

Petitioner  submitted  several  requests  for  information  to  Respondent  and  is  appealing 
Respondent’s refusal to respond to three of them.1  Respondent’s denial letter informed Petitioner 
that the judicial system was not subject to the Public Information Act, the requested records were not 
“judicial records” under Rule 12, and that the court would not respond to further inquiries from 
Petitioner.  Respondent submitted a response to this appeal but did not provide for our review copies 
of records responsive to the requests that were denied. 

Though  the  judiciary  is  not  subject  to  Chapter  552  of  the  Texas  Government  Code, 
commonly referred to as the Public Information Act, it is subject to Rule 12 of the Rules of Judicial 
Administration, the rule which governs public access to judicial records.  In reviewing an appeal 
under Rule 12, we must first consider whether the requested records are judicial records subject to 
Rule 12.  A “judicial record” is defined by Rule 12.2(d) as a “record made or maintained by or for a 
court  or  judicial  agency  in  its  regular  course  of  business  but  not  pertaining  to  its  adjudicative 
function, regardless of whether that function relates to a specific case.   A record of any nature 
created, produced, or filed in connection with any matter that is or has been before a court is not a 
judicial record.”  (Emphasis added.)   

The three requests at issue in this appeal list numerous questions and categories of records 
regarding the court’s functions and its court costs collection program.  Some of the records requested 
by Petitioner are records that were created, produced or filed in connection with cases that have been 
before the Coffee City Municipal Court.  Therefore, they are not “judicial records” as defined by 
Rule 12.2(d) and they are not subject to Rule 12.  See Rule 12 Decisions Nos. 01-001 and 17-012. 
Accordingly, we are without authority to grant the petition in whole or in part or sustain the denial of 
access to these records.2 We are providing copies of the requests at issue in this appeal to both 

1 Petitioner appealed the denial of two requests dated May 23, 2019 and one request dated May 21, 2019.  The 
documents submitted by Respondent indicate that Petitioner was provided the records requested in his May 21, 2019 
request and may have been provided some of the records requested in his May 23 requests.  This appeal addresses 
the requests that have not been complied with or addressed by Respondent.  
2 We note, however, that case records or court records which are not “judicial records” as defined by Rule 12 may be 
open pursuant to other law such as the common-law right to public access.  See Rule 12 Decisions 00-001 and 00-
003. We also note that the primary significance of a decision finding that a record is not subject to Rule 12 is that
the Rule 12 procedures for responding to requests and appealing the denial of requests do not apply. Neither the fact
that a record is not subject to Rule 12 nor a decision making this determination should be used as a basis for
withholding records.

Petitioner and Respondent with items that we have concluded are not subject to Rule 12 marked with 
an “N/A.” 
 

Many  of  the  items  listed  in  Petitioner’s  requests  are  questions  or  ask  for  summary 
information. Though a judicial officer does not have to answer questions or create documents to 
provide  summary  information,  if  the  questions  or  requests  are  for  information  that  the  records 
custodian knows may be available from a record maintained by the records custodian, a records 
custodian should advise the requestor so that the requestor can amend the request to ask for those 
records.  See Rule 12 Decision No. 17-002.  We have placed a “Q” next to the questions or items 
listed on the requests at issue in this appeal that may be requesting information that may be available 
in records maintained by the court. 

Some of the requests appear to describe records that may be subject to Rule 12.  If they exist, 
these  records  should  be  provided  to  Petitioner.3    These  items  are  highlighted  in  yellow  on  the 
requests at issue. If Respondent is not the custodian of the requested records but can ascertain who 
the custodian of the records is, Rule 12.6(f) requires Respondent to forward the request to that person 
and notify Petitioner.  See Rule12 Decision No. 17-001. 

espondent also informed us that it has been difficult for her to comply with the numerous 
requests submitted by Petitioner because she does not currently have staff to assist her.  Rule 12.6(b) 
requires a records custodian to respond to requests as soon as practicable, but not more than 14 days, 
after receiving a request.  However, it also provides that a records custodian may send written notice 
to the requestor stating that the records cannot be provided within the required 14 days and setting a 
reasonable time when they can be produced or copies provided.  This provision acknowledges that, 
due to workload and staffing levels, some requests cannot be completed within 14 days, and allows a 
records custodian to respond within a reasonable time. This is the appropriate response under these 
circumstances.4 
 
 
In summary, we are without authority to grant the petition in whole or in part or sustain the 
denial of access to the records we have concluded are not subject to Rule 12. Respondent should 
review the questions submitted by Petitioner to determine if any of the records maintained by the 
Court contain information that may be responsive to the questions so that Petitioner may amend his 
request.  If Respondent is not the custodian of the requested records but knows who is, Respondent 
should forward Petitioner’s request to that person and notify the Petitioner. Lastly, those records we 
have identified as subject to Rule 12 should be released to Petitioner. Because we have reached this 
decision without  the benefit of reviewing any responsive records, we give Respondent leave to 
submit  any  records  for  our  in  camera  review  that  Respondent  believes  are,  or  may  contain 
information, that is exempt from disclosure.

3 A records custodian is not required to create a record that doesn’t exist.  See Rule 12.4(a)(1) and Rule 12 Decision 
No. 16-012. 
4 We note that a records custodian may deny a record if the custodian makes specific, non-conclusory findings that 
compliance with a request would substantially and unreasonably impede the routine operation of the court or judicial 
agency. See Rule 12.8(a)(2). However, Respondent did not invoke this provision and nothing in the response 
submitted to this committee indicates that it should apply in this instance.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
