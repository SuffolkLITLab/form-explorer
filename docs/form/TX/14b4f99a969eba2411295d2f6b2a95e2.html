(2)

(3)

Plaintiffwas timely and properly notiﬁed ofthe hearing on COLLIN COUNTY’S

MOTION FOR ORDER DETERMINING RYAN GALLAGHER A VEXATIOUS

LITIGANT and he personally appeared at such hearing;

On January 23, 2020, the Court conducted a hearing, in accordance With TEX.

CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §1 1.053, t0 determine whether Plaintiff Ryan

Gallagher meets the criteria t0 be found a vexatious litigant under TEX. CIV.

PRAC. & REM. CODE §1 1.101(a), and if so, whether a Preﬁling Order should

be issued against him. The Court took judicial notice 0f and entered into

evidence the documents attached as Exhibits N0. 1-44 to the APPENDIX TO

COLLIN COUNTY’S MOTION FOR ORDER DETERMINING RYAN GALLAGHER A

VEXATIOUS LITIGANT. The Court also took judicial notice 0f all cases ﬁled by

The Court also considered argument 0f Collin County and Ryan Gallagher as

LITIGANT, (b) the APPENDIX T0 COLLIN COUNTY’S MOTION FOR ORDER

limitations, res judicata, and immunities. Similarly, Plaintiff” s claims against

the State 0f Texas and Texas Attorney General are barred by immunities.

or maintained” by Ryan Gallagher is found to be a time period beginning on
January 8, 2013.  Litigation filed before then yet still prosecuted or maintained
[i.e., on appeal] afterwards counts for the Court’s quantifying the number of
pro se litigations during the operative time period; 

(9)

The Court finds that Ryan Gallagher has commenced, prosecuted or maintained
Thirty Four (34) pro se litigations in the relevant time period of January 8,
2013, to January 8, 2020, and which have been determined adversely to him.
Attached  to  the  APPENDIX  TO  COLLIN  COUNTY’S  MOTION  FOR  ORDER
DETERMINING RYAN GALLAGHER A VEXATIOUS LITIGANT as Exhibit No. 1-44,
and also contained on the Collin County’s judicial record management system
ODYSSEY, are the corresponding docketsheets and other information for each
such  litigation  which  Ryan  Gallagher  has  commenced,  prosecuted  or
maintained since January 8, 2013, and that have been determined adversely to
him, which this Court takes judicial notice of for all purposes and has entered
into evidence in this case; 

(10)  The Court further finds that Ryan Gallagher, after litigation has been finally
determined against him, repeatedly relitigates or attempts to relitigate, pro se,
either (1) the validity of the determination against the same defendants as to
whom the litigation was finally determined; (2) or the cause of action, claim,
controversy, or any of the issues of fact or law determined or concluded by the
final determination against the same defendants as to whom the litigation was
finally determined.  It appears to the Court that Ryan Gallagher has filed four
subsequent litigations just against Collin County involving the same alleged
issues, bringing suits in state court and federal court. The documents attached
to the APPENDIX TO COLLIN COUNTY’S MOTION FOR ORDER DETERMINING
RYAN GALLAGHER A VEXATIOUS LITIGANT as Exhibits No. 1 and 43, and also
contained  on  the  Collin  County’s  judicial  record  management  system
ODYSSEY, evidence that after litigation has been finally determined against
him, Ryan Gallagher repeatedly relitigates or attempts to relitigate, pro se,
either (1) the validity of the determination against the same defendants as to
whom the litigation was finally determined; (2) or the cause of action, claim,
controversy, or any of the issues of fact or law determined or concluded by the
final determination against the same defendants as to whom the litigation was
finally determined.   This includes, but is not limited to, the following actions:
