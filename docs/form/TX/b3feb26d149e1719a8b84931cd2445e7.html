Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions

Petitioner  requested  from  Respondent  “the  monthly  and  annual  statistical  analysis, 
calculations, and presentations for each of the seven district courts in Montgomery County for the 
following information:  cases pending, cased filed, motions to revoke, cases reactivated, all other 
cases added, total incoming, total cases pending, cases disposed, cases placed on inactive, total 
outgoing, cases pending end month, clearance rate percentage, time to disposition, average days to 
disposition for all criminal, juvenile, family, and civil cases in each court for each month and year of 
2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.”  He also requested “certified stenographic recorder data showing time 
each certified stenographic recorder machine” was used on a daily basis for each month and year 
from 2012 to 2015.  Respondent denied Petitioner’s request claiming the statistical court data was 
exempt under Rule 12.5(f) and that Respondent was not the custodian of the records maintained on 
the stenographic recorders.  Petitioner then filed this appeal. 

n its response to the petition, Respondent states that it was directed to prepare the statistical 
reports and that they are used to assist the judges in reviewing their case data to ensure the data were 
successfully migrated from an old case management system to a new one.  Respondent also argues 
that  the  reports  are  “designed  to  present  information  in  a  manner  that  will  assist  the  judges  in 
reviewing case load data and in decision making related to judicial administration.”  Relying on Rule 
12 Decision No. 05-003, Respondent maintains that this information is exempt from disclosure 
under Rule 12.5(f) as a “record relating to internal deliberations of a court or judicial agency, or 
among  judicial  officers  or  members  of  a  judicial  agency,  on  matters  of  court  or  judicial 
administration.”  Petitioner provided for our review a copy of a report like the ones he requested that 
had been prepared for the district judges in Montgomery County but that he obtained from someone 
other than Respondent.  If the sample provided by Petitioner is an accurate depiction of the reports 
prepared by Respondent that are responsive to Petitioner’s request, Rule 12 Decision No. 05-003 
does not support Respondent’s conclusion.  The responsive records in Rule 12 Decision No. 05-003 
were  reports  prepared  by  a  consultant  who  had  analyzed  court  data  and  provided  conclusions 
regarding the data.  The reports at issue in this appeal contain case data reflecting the number of 
cases  filed,  cases  disposed,  motions  to  revoke  as  well  as  clearance  rates  and  other  information 
regarding case disposition statistics. The reports do not contain any analysis, recommendations or 
discussion related to the data.  They are simply a tally of the number of cases in a particular category 
or the number of days that have elapsed between actions and charts depicting the same information.  
Accordingly, we conclude that the reports  at issue in this appeal are not related to the internal 
deliberation  of  a  court  or  judicial  agency  or  among  judicial  officers  on  matters  of  court

administration and are not exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5(f).   
 

The records at issue in this appeal are more like those addressed in Rule 12 Decision No. 15-
002.    Those  records  reflected  the  number  of  truancy  cases  filed  in  the  courts  against  certain 
individuals for a specified period of time.  They were reports of aggregate data that were prepared 
for submission to the Office of Court Administration (OCA) pursuant to rules promulgated by the 
Texas  Judicial  Council.    The  Special  Committee  determined  that  they  were  not  exempt  from 
disclosure.  Though Respondent acknowledges that the information in the reports at issue in this 
appeal contain the same information included in publicly available reports prepared by the district 
clerk for submission to OCA, it maintains that the reports it has prepared can be distinguished.  We 
disagree.  Though the reports requested by Petitioner were created for a purpose other than for 
submission to OCA and provide data by court rather than aggregate data for the whole county, the 
information in both types of reports is essentially the same.  For the reasons stated above and in light 
of the Rule 12 directive that it should be liberally construed to achieve its purpose, we conclude that 
the requested reports should be released.  
 

Petitioner also requested certified stenographic recorder data.  In his Petition, Petitioner 
refers to this as “metadata from stenographic recording machines” and alleges that seven of the eight 
stenographic  machines  in  use  by  the  district  courts’  court  reporters  are  owned  by  the  county.    
Respondent replied that it is not the custodian of the stenographic machines and that it is unable to 
ascertain who the custodian is.  A judicial record that is subject to Rule 12 is one that is “made or 
maintained by or for a court or judicial agency in its regular course of business but not pertaining to 
its  adjudicative  function,  regardless  of  whether  that  function  relates  to  a  specific  case.”    Rule 
12.2(d).  “The judicial records of a court with only one judge, such as any trial court, are in the 
custody  of  that  judge.”    Rule  12.2(e)(1).    Records  created  on  a  stenographic  recorder  in  the 
courtroom are made or maintained for a court in its regular course of business; however, these 
records often relate to a court’s adjudicative function and are not judicial records as defined by Rule 
12.  If the information requested by Petitioner is a “judicial record” subject to Rule 12, the records 
custodian would be the judge of the court in which the stenographic recording machine was used.  
Because Respondent, based on the uncertainty of who the custodian of records maintained on a 
stenographic recorder is, did not address whether the requested information exists, and if it exists, 
whether it is a “judicial record” that is subject to Rule 12, and if it is subject to Rule 12, whether it is 
exempt from disclosure, we give Respondent leave to submit its arguments on behalf of the judges 
for our consideration. 

 
 
In summary, we grant the petition regarding the statistical reports requested by Petitioner, a 
sample of which was attached to Petitioner’s appeal.  We also give Respondent leave to address 
whether  the  requested  stenographic  recorder  information  exists,  and  if  it  exists,  whether  it  is  a 
“judicial record” that is subject to Rule 12, and if it is subject to Rule 12, whether it is exempt from 
disclosure.
