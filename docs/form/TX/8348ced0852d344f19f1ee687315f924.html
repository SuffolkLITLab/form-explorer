      <pre>Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 
Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 

   

APPEAL NO.: 

19-016 

ESPONDENT: 

Eighth Administrative Judicial Region 

ATE: 

 

December 9, 2019 

 

 

 

PECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge Stephen B. Ables, Chairman; Judge Kelly G. Moore; Judge 
Alfonso Charles; Judge Susan Brown; Judge Ray Wheless  

Petitioner requested from Respondent a copy of any judicial record that the presiding judge 
of the region had approved and signed which showed any local county plans, local county rules, or 
local county procedures that must be followed by the judges of Somervell and Johnson counties. The 
presiding judge informed Petitioner that it was his understanding that the only local rules that had 
been adopted by the courts serving Johnson and Somervell counties were the counties’ Indigent 
Defense Plans and provided a web address where Petitioner could access the counties’ Indigent 
Defense Plans. He also informed Petitioner that he did not believe Rule 12 applied to local rules 
because access to them is controlled by the Texas Rule of Civil Procedure or the Texas Code of 
Criminal Procedure and are excluded from Rule 12 under Rule 12.3, and he informed Petitioner that 
he was not the custodian of the requested records. Petitioner then filed this appeal and requested 
expedited review.  We did not grant Petitioner’s request for expedited review. 1   

etitioner asserts that Respondent’s reply to his request was a “partial denial of complete 
access to the requested judicial records” and that Respondent failed to provide proper notice of 
denial and information regarding Petitioner’s right to appeal.  Petitioner also asserts that Respondent 
“declined to give an opinion regarding whether the counties’ local rules must be followed” and asks 
this  special  committee  to  conclude  that  Respondent  failed  to  provide  complete  access  to  the 
requested records because the “presiding judge failed to acknowledge that the judges of Johnson and 
Somervell counties are required to follow their publicly posted Indigent Defense Plans.”  

 
 
We first address whether the requested records are subject to Rule 12.  A record is subject to 
Rule 12 if it is one that is “made or maintained by or for a court or judicial agency in its regular 
course of business but not pertaining to its adjudicative function, regardless of whether that function 
relates to a specific case.  A record of any nature created, produced, or filed in connection with any 
matter that is or has been before a court is not a judicial record.”  (Emphasis added.)  Rule 12.2(d).  

  P

A court’s local rules of procedure specifically address the processing of cases; thus, they 
relate to a court’s adjudicative function and are not subject to Rule 12 when maintained by a court. 
However, a presiding judge’s review and approval of local rules submitted by the region’s courts for 
the presiding judge’s approval is an administrative function, not an adjudicative one.  Therefore, if a 

                                                 
1 We note that the documents at issue in this appeal are attached to the petition; thus, there is no need for an 
expedited appeal.

regional presiding judge maintains in the region’s office a copy of the rules that have been signed by 
the  presiding  judge,  they  are  being  maintained  as  records  related  to  the  presiding  judge’s 
administrative function and are subject to Rule 12. The fact that the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 
or the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure control or discuss a court’s duty to provide access to or 
post the rules does not alter our conclusion that a copy of the rules that was signed and approved by 
the presiding judge and maintained by the administrative judicial region is subject to Rule 12.  

We next address Petitioner’s claim that Respondent denied him the records he requested and 
failed to provide the notice of denial required by Rule 12.8. Respondent informed Petitioner that he 
was not the custodian of the requested records but provided Petitioner a link to a website where they 
could be accessed. We do not believe that Respondent denied Petitioner access to the requested 
records  when  Respondent  directed  Petitioner  to  a  link  on  a  website  where  they  could  be 
downloaded.2 This is an efficient way to make records available for inspection and we do not want 
to discourage judicial officers from handling Rule 12 requests in a manner that is expeditious and, in 
many instances, satisfies the requestor. However, if a requestor does not want to access requested 
records from a website, the requestor should inform the records custodian, and if the records exist 
and are maintained by the records custodian, then the records custodian must either provide the 
requested records in the manner or form desired by Petitioner or deny the request and provide the 
requestor  with  the  appropriate  notice  of  denial.  Petitioner  did  not  inform  Respondent  that  the 
response  did  not  satisfy  his  request.    Accordingly,  we  conclude  that  Respondent  did  not  deny 
Petitioner’s request for records by referring him to a website to access the requested records.3 

Lastly, we address Petitioner’s request that this special committee determine that Respondent 
failed to provide complete access to the requested records because the presiding judge failed to 
acknowledge that the judges of Johnson and Somervell counties are required to follow their Indigent 
Defense Plans. Petitioner misunderstands the purpose of Rule 12.  Its purpose is to provide the 
public  access  to  information  in  the  judiciary  and  it  establishes  procedures  for  requesting  and 
providing access to judicial records.  Rule 12 does not require a judge to opine on any matter or 
acknowledge the validity of assertions posed by requestors. 

For the reasons discussed above, the petition is denied. 

   

   

   

   

 

 

       

                                                 
2 Petitioner’s request states that the requested documents may be provided in electronic format. 
3 Petitioner also asserted that Respondent should have determined who the custodian of the records is and refer the 
request to the appropriate records custodian under Rule 12.6(f).  We do not address this point since we have 
concluded that Respondent attempted to provide the requested records by referring Petitioner to a website where he 
could access the requested records.
