I.  Background 

Family First Prevention Services Act 

The Family First Prevention Services Act (FFPSA) was enacted as part of the federal Bipartisan 

Budget Act of 2018 (H.R. 1892). FFPSA seeks to reduce entry into foster care, limit the use of 
congregate care, as well as improve services and outcomes for children placed in care.1 The law 
restructured federal child welfare funding and the use of Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. 2 
FFPSA specifies that though the child welfare agency can continue to use contracted residential 

care providers for placements, Title IV-E maintenance payments are no longer allowed for any 

child in a General Residential Operation (GRO) after the first fourteen days, unless the placement 
meets  the  requirements  of  being  a  Qualified  Residential  Treatment  Program  (QRTP). 3  This 
component of FFPSA went into effect in Texas in September 2021.4  

Qualified Residential Treatment Programs 

A QRTP is an operation that is accredited and licensed as a GRO and provides qualified treatment 

services  to  children  and  youth  in  Texas  Department  of  Family  &  Protective  Services  (DFPS) 
conservatorship  with  the  most  complex  emotional,  mental,  and  behavioral  health  needs. 5  To 
become  a  QRTP,  a  provider  must  have  a  trauma-informed  treatment  model  and  must  have 

licensed  nursing  and  clinical  staff  available  24/7  on-site  according  to  the  provider’s  treatment 
model. 6 Additionally, a QRTP must facilitate family outreach, engagement, and inclusion in the 
child’s treatment program and provide discharge and family-based aftercare support for at least 
six months post-discharge. 7 

DFPS QRTP Pilot 

In September 2020, DFPS released their FFPSA Strategic Plan, which included a plan for a QRTP 
pilot. 8 The pilot is designed to serve youth under the age of 18 who have complex emotional, 
behavioral,  and  mental  health  issues.9  The  youth  served  may  have  experienced  unsuccessful 
placements  in  less  restrictive  environments,  experienced  episodes  of  being  a  child  without 

placement,  be  diagnosed  with  an  emotional  disorder,  or  have  experienced  being  placed  in 
psychiatric hospitals or the juvenile justice system. For a youth aged 13 and up, the length of 
treatment in a QRTP cannot exceed 12 consecutive months, or 18 non-consecutive months. 10 
For a youth under the age of 13, the length of treatment cannot exceed 6 consecutive or non-
consecutive months.11 In compliance with the national requirement, within 30 days of a child’s 
placement in a QRTP, an assessment must be completed by a qualified individual. 12 The QRTP 

4 
 

 

assessment process during the pilot includes three steps. The first step consists of the Child and 
Adolescent  Needs  and  Strengths  (CANS)  Assessment,  which  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the 
youth’s  caseworkers. 13  Then,  DFPS  will  coordinate  and  facilitate  a  QRTP  permanency  team 
meeting.14 Finally, Youth for Tomorrow (YFT), 15 a not-for-profit behavioral health care company 
in  Texas,  will conduct  a third  party clinical review  which  will  result  in recommendations  by  a 
qualified individual concerning placement. 16 Should the assessment result in a recommendation 
for QRTP placement, the DFPS Director or Associate Director of Placement, or their designee, 
will need to approve the placement.17 

Notably,  to  be  part  of  the  QRTP  pilot,  DFPS  requires  providers  to  offer  a  trauma-informed 
treatment model to be evidence based, promising practice, or research supported and approved 
by  the  agency. 18  DFPS  also  specifies  that  the  aftercare  support  provided  must  include  crisis 
intervention  and  monthly  contact  with  family  or  next  caregiver  of  the  youth. 19  Finally,  any 
provider in the pilot must provide a 1:4 ratio of supervision for youth during waking hours and 
1:5 supervision during sleeping hours. 20 If there is capacity, providers will be required to accept 
any youth in DFPS conservatorship who meets the operation’s QRTP admission criteria. If the 

operation does not believe it is in a youth’s best interest to be admitted to their QRTP, before 
declining admission, the contractor must staff the case with the operations treatment team and 

submit  a  written  statement  to  DFPS  outlining  specific  reasons  for  declining  admission  of  the 

youth.  A  QRTP  will  not  conduct  an  unplanned  discharge  of  a  youth  without  conducting  a 
multidisciplinary  meeting  which  must  include  the  youth’s  treatment  and  permanency  teams; 

additionally the DFPS Director or Associate Director of Placement, or their designee, must be 
in agreement with the discharge.21  

The QRTP pilot stipulates that discharge planning must begin at the time of placement and should 
include the QRTP provider, child’s family or subsequent caregiver support, and members of the 
Permanency Team. 22 The QRTP provider will also be responsible for providing post-discharge 
aftercare services and support for a minimum of 6 months. 23 

Efforts to begin the QRTP pilot are ongoing. In April 2022, DFPS published an Open Enrollment 
opportunity for licensed GROs to become contracted QRTP providers. 24  

Senate Bill 1575 (87th Legislative Session) 

Pursuant to Senate Bill (SB) 1575, passed during the 87th Legislative Session, a court must review 
the placement within 60 days of a child’s initial placement in a QRTP. 25 In this review, the court 
shall consider any assessment, determination, and documentation made by a qualified individual 

5 
 

 

regarding  the child’s  placement  and determine whether  the child’s  needs can  be met  through 
placement in a foster home. 26 If not, the court must then determine whether placing the child in 
a  QRTP  provides  the  most  effective  and  appropriate  level  of  care  for  the  child  in  the  least 

restrictive environment as well as whether placing the child in a QRTP is consistent with the 
short-term and long-term goals for the child, as specified in the child’s permanency plan. Based 
upon  its  determinations,  the  court  must  either  approve  or  disapprove  of  the  placement. 27 
Following the initial determination, as long as a child remains in a QRTP, the court must review 

the  placement  using  updated  information  provided  by  DFPS  at  each  subsequent  status  and 
permanency hearing. 28 

II.  SB 1575 Workgroup 

SB 1575 included a requirement for the Supreme Court of Texas Permanent Judicial Commission 
for  Children,  Youth,  and  Families  (Children’s  Commission),  in  collaboration  with  DFPS,  to 

establish and oversee a work group to examine the oversight of and best practices related to 

Residential Treatment Center (RTC) placements, including placements in Qualified Residential 
Treatment Programs as that term is defined by FFPSA, codified as 42 U.S.C. Section 672(k)(4).  

Workgroup Charge 

The  SB  1575  Workgroup  was  given  the  charge  to  consider  topics  and  changes  to  current 

practices which the work group determines necessary to ensure the appropriate use of and to 

improve the transition into and out of residential treatment center placements, including: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

Statutorily required judicial review of residential treatment center placements; 

Fiscal implications of additional judicial review for residential treatment center 
placements; 

Methods  for  improving  the  state's  practices  regarding  the  duration  of 
residential treatment center placements, including best practices for transition 
planning and involving family and other relevant participants in preparing the 
child for a subsequent placement; 

Proposed  statutory  changes  regarding  appropriate  judicial  findings,  evidence 
required  to  be  submitted  by  the  department,  and  recommendations  for 
information to be gathered from the child's attorney or guardian ad litem; and 

Model court orders determined to be appropriate for the legal requirements 
for a particular placement. 29 

6 
 

Membership and Structure 

 

Judge Rob Hofmann, Senior Jurist in Residence for the Children’s Commission and Judge of the 
452nd Judicial District Court, served as Chair for the SB 1575 Workgroup. Workgroup members 
included  participants  representing  the  courts,  attorneys,  Court  Appointed  Special  Advocates 

(CASA),  Single  Source  Continuum  Contractors  (SSCCs)  and  providers,  advocates,  as  well  as 
DFPS,  Texas  Juvenile  Justice  Department  (TJJD),  and  Texas  Health  and  Human  Services 

Commission (HHSC) representatives.  

The SB 1575 Workgroup met on September 30 and December 10, 2021 and April 29 and July 

12, 2022. At the first meeting on September 30, 2021, the workgroup created two subgroups to 

divide the topics laid out in the above charge: the Legal Subgroup and the RTC Best Practices 
Subgroup.  The  Legal  Subgroup  focused  on  topics  1,  2,  4,  and  5  listed  above.  The  RTC  Best 

Practices Subgroup focused on topic 3 listed above. The SB 1575 Workgroup received updates 

about the progress of the subgroups and reviewed the recommendations included in this report. 

Subgroups 

The Legal Subgroup included judges, attorneys for parents, children, and DFPS, CASA and other 
advocates, providers, DFPS, and TJJD. This group met on a monthly basis from November 2021 

to June 2022, with the exception of April 2022 which was canceled due to scheduling conflicts. 

The Legal Subgroup had a narrower charge than the RTC Best Practices Subgroup and focused 
primarily on what statutory changes may be needed to address court and legal duties when a 

child is placed in an RTC or QRTP.  

The  RTC  Best  Practices  Subgroup  included  judges,  attorneys,  CASA  and  other  advocates, 

multiple  providers  and  provider  organizations,  mental  health  professionals,  lived  experience 

leaders, HHSC, DFPS, and  TJJD. This group met on a monthly basis from November 2021 to 
June  2022.  The  subgroup  decided  to  take  at  least  one  topic  per  meeting  to  focus  in  on  the 

nuances of each issue including, but not limited to, assessment, transition planning, youth and 

family engagement, duration of placement, and treatment models. 

The recommendations in this report were generated by the subgroups and reviewed by the SB 
1575 Subgroup. Members lists for the workgroup and subgroups are included herein. DFPS and 

the Children’s Commission collaborated throughout this process, including providing context for 

the supported recommendations in this report.  

7 
 

 

III.  Legal Recommendations 

Pursuant  to  its  charge,  the  Legal  Workgroup  developed  recommendations  related  to  judicial 

review of RTC and QRTP placements as well as Guardian ad Litem and Attorney ad Litem duties. 
Proposed statutory changes are included below. In addition, the Legal Workgroup identified two 

related recommendations about dispute resolution and data collection.  

Alternative Strategies 

a.  Recommendation:  Placement  decisions  should  be  resolved  without  court 
intervention  whenever  possible,  including  by  agreement  of  the  parties,  through 
family group decision-making or other mechanisms to resolve disputes. 

Although  the  SB  1575  Workgroup  and  Legal  Subgroup  made  multiple  recommendations 

regarding court review of RTC and QRTP placements, there was also consensus that disputes 

over these placements should be resolved without court intervention whenever possible. While 
the court may ultimately need to determine whether the placement is appropriate, there are 

many non-adversarial mechanisms already in place to address disagreements in a collaborative 

and inclusive format before the matter is brought before the court. 

Court Data 

b.  Recommendation:  Identify  court  data  currently  available  in  the  Child 
Protection  Case  Management  System  (CPCMS)  related  to  RTC  and  QRTP 
placement  reviews  and  share  the  relevant  fields with  courts  that  do  not  utilize 
CPCMS.  Update  CPCMS  or  other  tracking  methods  to  incorporate  data 
collection relevant to this report. 

The Office of Court Administration (OCA) develops and maintains the Child Protection Case 
Management System for the Child Protection Courts in Texas. Fields in this case management 

system can be used to track RTC and QRTP placement reviews and over time these fields can 

be  adapted  as  needed.  For  non-Child  Protection  Courts,  the  relevant  fields  in  CPCMS  can 

perhaps serve as a model for data collection. Regardless of the case management system used, 
courts should identify methods to track data on RTC and QRTP placement reviews and analyze 

the data for continuous quality improvement purposes. 

8 
 

 

Proposed Statutory Changes 

The  SB  1575  Legal  Subgroup  reviewed  various  statutes  to  determine  what  changes  would  be 

recommended  for  guardians  ad  litem,  attorneys  ad  litem,  and  judges  to  define  their  roles  in 

reviewing placements in either Residential Treatment Centers or Qualified Residential Treatment 
Programs.  Each  of  the  proposed  statutory  recommendations  laid  out  below  aims  to  identify 

common  language  and  clarify  responsibilities  for  the  legal  stakeholders.  Notably,  since  these 

recommendations would be incorporated into existing court hearings, there were no significant 
fiscal implications identified for the courts to include additional findings. 

Tex. Fam. Code § 263.001. DEFINITIONS.  

Recommendation:  ADD  (a)(5)  “Residential  Treatment  Center”  means  any 
General Residential Operation for seven or more children or young adults that 

provides  treatment  services  and  is  licensed  by  the  Texas  Health  and  Human 

Services Commission. 

To adequately and clearly address the types of placement that require court review, the terms 
used must be clear. Adding this definition to Texas Family Code § 263.001 will create a single 

reference in Chapter 263 for how the term Residential Treatment Center is used throughout 

the chapter. Inclusion of this term will ensure DFPS, HHSC, attorneys, guardians ad litem, judges, 

parents,  children,  and  others  are  all  using  common  terminology  when  referring  to  an  RTC 
placement.  

Tex. Fam. Code § 263.002. REVIEW OF PLACEMENTS BY COURT; FINDINGS 

Recommendation:  ADD  (d)  If  the  child  is  or  may  be  placed  in  a  residential 
treatment center, the court shall determine: 

(1) whether the child's needs can be met through placement in a family-like setting; 

(2)  if  placement  in  a  residential  treatment  center  is  required,  whether  the 

recommended or existing program can provide the most effective and appropriate 
level of care for this child; 

(3)  whether  the  recommended  or  existing  program  is  the  least  restrictive 
environment consistent with the child's best interest and individual needs; and 

9 
 

 

(4) whether the placement is consistent with the short-term and long-term goals 
for the child, as specified in the child's permanency plan. 

(e)  In  making  the  determinations  required  by  subsection  (d),  the  court  may 

consider the following: 

(1) psychological or psychiatric assessments; 

(2) the current treatment plan and progress being made; 

(3) any significant medical, legal, or behavioral incidents; 

(4) the reasons for discharge from prior or current placements; 

(5) the programs available at the facility to address the child’s needs; 

(6) the program’s plan to discharge the child after treatment; 

(7) whether there are other programs that more effectively meet the child's needs; 

or 

(8) other information that would assist the court in making the determination. 

The recommendation is to require the court to make certain findings when a child is or may be 

placed in an RTC. This language is similar to the required court findings for QRTP placements 

pursuant to Texas Family Code § 263.00201. Given the high level of care and the therapeutic 
need for RTC placements, it is critical for courts to review whether the placement meets the 

child’s needs and goals and is appropriate for the child. Some courts already review placements 

in RTCs or require court approval before placing a child in an RTC and the “is or may” language 
allows for that flexibility.  

In order to make these findings, the court will rely on information provided by the attorneys in 

the case and the enumerated list of the potential information sources is included to encourage 

the  use  of  existing  documents  and  assessments  to  help  inform  the  court’s  decision.  This 
recommendation does not place a duty on the court to seek out this information; rather, the 

court should make the required findings based on the information submitted by the attorneys in 

the case.

Tex. Fam. Code § 263.202. STATUS HEARING; FINDINGS  

Recommendation: ADD (b)(5) if the child is placed in a residential treatment 
center, whether continued placement is appropriate pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code 

§263.002. 

(6)  if  the  child  is  placed  in  a  qualified  residential  treatment  program,  whether 

continued placement is appropriate pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code §263.00201. 

FFPSA and the Texas Family Code require continued review of QRTP placements at the status 

hearing, but this requirement is not specified in the statutory section that judges and attorneys 
reference for the status hearing. This recommendation suggests a technical change so that the 

required  findings  are  incorporated  in  the  Status  Hearing  section  of  the  Family  Code.  The 

recommendation also mirrors this approach for ongoing review of RTC placements. 

Tex. Fam. Code § 263.306. PERMANENCY HEARINGS BEFORE FINAL ORDER  

Recommendation:  ADD  (a-1)(5)(J)  if  the  child  is  placed  in  a  residential 
treatment center, whether continued placement is appropriate pursuant to Tex. 

Fam. Code §263.002; and 

(K)  if  the  child  is  placed  in  a  qualified  residential  treatment  program,  whether 

continued placement is appropriate pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code §263.00201. 

Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  263.5031.  PERMANENCY  HEARINGS  FOLLOWING  FINAL 

ORDER  

Recommendation:  ADD  (a)(4)(M)  if  the  child  is  placed  in  a  residential 
treatment center, whether continued placement is appropriate pursuant to Tex. 

Fam. Code §263.002; and 

(N)  if  the  child  is  placed  in  a  qualified  residential  treatment  program,  whether 

continued placement is appropriate pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code §263.00201.  

FFPSA and the Texas Family Code also require continued review of QRTP placements at every 

permanency review hearing, but this requirement is not specified in the statutory sections that 
judges  and  attorneys  reference  for  those  hearings. This  recommendation  suggests  a  technical 

change so that the required findings are incorporated in the Permanency Hearing sections of the 

Texas Family Code. The recommendation also mirrors this approach for ongoing review of RTC 
placements.  

11 
 

 

Guardian ad Litem and Attorney ad Litem 
Duties 

Guardians ad litem (GALs) and attorneys ad litem (AALs) have critical roles in assisting the court 

with a determination about whether an RTC or QRTP placement is appropriate. The SB 1575 

Workgroup and Legal Subgroup identified additional duties and the need for increased access to 
information about the child’s needs and the placement for both GALs and AALs. Notably, for 

attorney guardians ad litem and attorneys ad litem, these additional responsibilities could have a 

fiscal impact in attorney’s fees.  

Tex. Fam. Code § 107.002. POWERS AND DUTIES OF GUARDIAN AD LITEM FOR 
CHILD 

ADD  and  AMEND  (b)  A  guardian  ad  litem  appointed  for  the  child  under  this 
chapter shall: 

(4)  Seek  to  elicit  in  a  developmentally  appropriate  manner,  the  opinion  and 

concerns of the child regarding the current or proposed placements;  

(c ) If a child is, or will be, placed in a Residential Treatment Center as defined by 

Section  263.001,  Qualified  Residential  Treatment  Program  as  defined  by 

263.00201, or similar treatment setting, the guardian ad litem shall: 

(1) Review any available information related to the child’s needs, or supporting 

such placement, including, but not limited to the Child and Adolescent Needs and 

Strengths assessment, psychological evaluation, discharge notice from current or 

past placements, recent incident reports, and counseling notes; 

(2) Review any available information regarding how the placement is appropriate 

to meet the child’s specific needs; 

(3)  As  appropriate,  be  permitted  to  request  a  placement  conference  and 

participate  in  any  conferences  conducted  by  the  Department  or  the  child’s 

treatment  team  related  to  the  initial  and  ongoing  placement  in  a  Residential 

Treatment Center, Qualified Residential Treatment Program, or similar treatment 

setting; and 

12 
 

 

(4)  Provide  to  the  court  by  report  or  testimony,  a  recommendation  about 

placement based on the best interest of the child. 

(cd) A guardian ad litem appointed for the child under this chapter is entitled to: 

(12) receive the information described in section (c)(1) and (2). 

GALs are charged with advocating for the best interests of a child and in order to inform that 

position, it is critical for GALs to consult the child in a developmentally appropriate manner to 

ascertain the child’s opinion regarding the placement. Although this is especially critical for an 
RTC  or  QRTP  placement,  the  recommendation  was  for  this  duty  to  apply  to  any  proposed 

placement. There are more specific areas laid out for the GAL to explore when the proposed 

placement is a RTC or QRTP. In order to fulfill these duties, GALs will need to access relevant 

information. 

Tex. Fam. Code § 107.004. ADDITIONAL DUTIES OF ATTORNEY AD LITEM FOR 
CHILD 

Recommendation:  ADD  (f)  If  a  child  is,  or  will  be,  placed  in  a  Residential 
Treatment Center, Qualified Residential Treatment Program, or similar treatment 

setting, the attorney ad litem shall: 

(1)  Review  any  available  information  related  to  the  child’s  needs  or  supporting 
such placement, including, but not limited to the Child and Adolescent Needs and 

Strengths assessment, psychological evaluation, discharge notice from current or 

past placements, recent incident reports, and counseling notes; 

(2) Review any available information regarding how the placement is appropriate 

to meet the child’s specific needs; 

(3)  As  appropriate,  be  permitted  to  request  a  placement  conference  and 
participate  in  any  conferences,  unless  good  cause  is  shown,  conducted  by  the 

Department  or  the  child’s  treatment  team  related  to  the  initial  and  ongoing 

placement  in  Residential  Treatment  Center,  Qualified  Residential  Treatment 
Program, or similar treatment setting;  

(4) In a developmentally appropriate manner, elicit the opinion and concerns of 
the child regarding the current or proposed placement a sufficient amount of time 

13 
 

 

before any hearing to allow the attorney ad litem to prepare for the hearing in 
accordance with the child's expressed objectives of representation;  

(5)  In  a  developmentally  appropriate  manner,  advise  the  child  as  required  by 

subsection (a)(1) of the Department’s request or recommendation for placement 

and the likelihood of the request being granted; and  

(6) Advocate to the court for the child’s specific desires regarding the requested 

placement as required by subsection (a)(2).  

The recommended duties for the AAL are similar to those of the GAL with several important 
distinctions.  First,  the  AAL’s  role  is  to  advocate  for  the  child’s  specific  desires  regarding  the 

proposed or ongoing placement. Second, the AAL must also utilize their role as counselor to 

advise their client about the recommendation and what may happen in court. Third, the AAL 
must gather required information in a timely manner in order to zealously advocate for their

child client.  

FOR PARENT 

Recommendation:  AMEND  (a)(2)  An  attorney  ad  litem  appointed  under 
Section 107.013 to represent the interests of a parent is entitled to: 

(F)  participate  in  any  case  staffing  conducted  by  the  Department  of  Family  and 
Protective Services in which the parent is invited to participate, including, as 

appropriate, a case staffing to develop a family plan of service, a family group 

conference, a permanency conference, a mediation, a case staffing to plan for 
the discharge and return of the child to the parent, a case staffing related to a 

placement in a residential treatment center or qualified residential treatment 

program, and any other case staffing that the department determines would 

be appropriate for the parent to attend, but excluding any internal department 
staffing  or  staffing  between  the  department  and  the  department's  legal 

representative. 

This recommendation explicitly states that the attorney ad litem for the parent would have the 

right to participate in case staffings related to the RTC or QRTP placement so that the attorney 
remains informed and has an opportunity to advocate on their client’s behalf.

Tex. Fam. Code § 264.018. REQUIRED NOTIFICATIONS 

Recommendation: AMEND (5) "Significant event" means: 

(E) a placement in a qualified residential treatment program as that term is defined 
by  42  U.S.C.  Section  672(k)(4)  or  placement  in  a  residential  treatment  center, 

including  meetings  or  conferences  to  determine  the  appropriateness  of  the 

placement. 

Senate  Bill  1575  added  QRTP  placements  as  a  significant  event  which  triggers  notice  to 

enumerated individuals within a 10-day timeframe. The recommendation is to require a similar 
notice of placement in an RTC as a significant event.  

Model Court Order 

One part of the charge for the workgroup was to formulate model order language. The language 

for  the  order  was  modeled  after  the  proposed  statutory  changes  to  require  court  findings 
regarding RTC or QRTP placements. The language included for RTCs and QRTPs can be used 

as part of existing court order templates or could be used as a standalone order, depending on 

court practice and preference. Separate model order  language for RTC and QRTP placement 
reviews are included below.

IV.  RTC Best Practices Recommendations 

As mentioned above, the RTC Best Practices Subgroup was charged with considering topics and 

changes to current practices the workgroup determined necessary to ensure the appropriate use 
of and to improve the transition into and out of residential treatment center placements. This 

included  methods  for  improving  the  state's  practices  regarding  the  duration  of  residential 

treatment center placements, including best practices for transition planning and involving family 
and other relevant participants in preparing the child for a subsequent placement. 30 

In  examining  the  scope  of  this  charge,  members  of  the  SB  1575  Workgroup  and  RTC  Best 

Practices Subgroup fully acknowledged that there are existing regulations and requirements in 

place to set the minimum standards for operation of a Residential Treatment Center. As noted 
in Rider 38 (87th Legislative Session), DFPS must work with HHSC and other foster care oversight 
entities  to  align  functions  and  eliminate  any  unnecessary  or  duplicative  oversight  while  still 

maintaining transparency and accountability. This includes the impact of increased oversight on 

foster  family  recruitment  and  retainment,  elimination  of  duplicative  functions,  improved 
communications  and  documentation  between  agencies,  fiscal  impact  on  foster care  providers, 

and  improved  alignment  with  Community-Based  Care  implementation. It  is  also  important  to 

acknowledge  that  to be  fully  realized,  the  best practices  are  contingent  on  a well-trained  and 

adequately  staffed  workforce.  Also,  the  recommendations  made  in  this  report  are  limited  to 
Department of Family and Protective Services placements but may be relevant to children placed 

through  Health  and  Human  Services  Commission  Residential  Treatment  Center  Project,  the 

Juvenile Justice System, or other agency placements. 

Accordingly,  the  subgroup  focused  on  aspirational  goals  and  best  practice  milestones. 
Throughout  the  RTC  best  practice  recommendations,  the  legend  below  is  used  to  indicate 

whether a recommendation may require legislative action or funding or is addressed in minimum 

standards or DFPS policy.  

L = Legislative; $ = Financial Impact; MS = In Minimum Standards; P = DFPS Policy 

18 
 

Access to Information 

a.  Recommendation: Upon intake and on a regular basis, DFPS, SSCCs, and RTC 
staff should review the familial information for the child 1 to determine who can 
maintain  contact  with  the  child  and  who  should  be  informed  about  the  child’s 
treatment and progress. P 31 

While it may be best practice to review information regarding who a child can have contact with, 
this  may  not  happen  consistently  and  routinely  for  every  RTC  placement  for  every  child. 

Sometimes the individuals who can maintain contact with a child can change so this information 

should  be  reviewed  on  a  regular  basis.  Ensuring  that  the  RTC  has  correct  and  up  to  date 
information regarding appropriate family contacts can facilitate positive permanency for children 

and provide support while they are in placements. 

b.  Recommendation: Before, during, and after an RTC placement, all appropriate 
parties  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  family2  members  [unless  prohibited  from 
access by the court], legal parties, attorneys, child advocates, RTC providers, and 
juvenile justice personnel) need timely3 and readily available access to information 
about  a  child’s  treatment  and  progress  in  the  placement.  Guidance  should  be 
developed to address confidentiality concerns. MS 32 

After all appropriate parties are identified, and when this information is well-maintained,  two-

way communication is critical to the success of a child’s RTC placement and information about 
the  child’s  progress  should  be  promptly  shared  with  these  individuals.  This  communication 

ensures that everyone has access to the information needed to support the child, even after the 

child is no longer placed in the RTC.  

c.  Recommendation: All RTC staff should be clear about who is on a “no contact” 
list and is prohibited against having contact with each child by court order in a civil 
or  criminal  case  or  bond  conditions  or  on  the  RTC  “no  contact”  list.  Safety 

 

 In this report, “Child” refers to child, youth, and young adult. 
2 In this report, “Family” refers to parents, relatives, and kin who are approved to maintain contact and receive 
information about the child. 
3 In this report, “Timely” refers to as soon as practicable with a focus on urgency and accountability. This may vary 
depending on a case-by-case basis.  

L = Legislative; $ = Financial Impact; MS = In Minimum Standards; P = DFPS Policy  19

measures should put in place to ensure any prohibited contact, as determined on 
a case-by-case basis by a court order, does not occur. MS 33 

As important as knowing who to contact about a child’s treatment and progress is being clear 

on who cannot have contact with the child. There are serious safety and well-being concerns 
when  information  is  shared  with  individuals  who  are  prohibited  by  court  order  from  having 

contact with the child. Depending on the court order, the contact could be in-person contact, 

or it could be another form of contact, such as telephone or video contact.  

d.  Recommendation:  To  ensure  all  parties  and  advocates  have  access  to 
information about which family members and fictive kin have been explored by 
DFPS  or  an  SSCC  as  a  supportive  connection  for  the  child  or  ruled  out  as 
inappropriate, this information should be included in the court report. L  

   

The following areas are already covered in the court report: 

Status Hearing: NOTIFICATION OF RELATIVES 

•  DFPS Efforts to Notify Relatives and Fictive Kin 

• 

• 

Individuals Identified, Located and/or Notified 

Individuals Not Identified, Located, or Notified 

Permanency  Plan  and  Progress  Report  (Temporary  Managing Conservatorship): 

NOTIFICATION OF RELATIVES 

•  Parental Cooperation 

•  DFPS Efforts to Locate Missing Parents 

•  Notification of Relatives and Efforts to Notify Fictive Kin 

The Permanency Progress Report (Permanent Managing Conservatorship) does not appear to 

have a section for continuing the efforts regarding relatives or fictive kin. Training and information 
should be available for staff to ensure these fields are regularly and routinely updated so that all 

appropriate  parties  have  access  to  up-to-date  information  about  potential  placement  and 

supportive resources for the child.  

e.  Recommendation:  For  children  involved  in  multiple  systems,  coordination  is 

critical to ensure there are no lapses in information or treatment.  

L = Legislative; $ = Financial Impact; MS = In Minimum Standards; P = DFPS Policy  20 

Subgroup members discussed that children placed in RTCs often come into contact with multiple 

systems, including but not limited to, education, health care, and juvenile justice. With multiple 
systems  involved  in  the  child’s  treatment  and  placement,  information  can  be  lost  or 

misunderstood so it is critical that the agencies serving the child communicate and collaborate. 

Current  efforts  to  improve  in  this  area  are  underway  to  address  these  concerns  at  DFPS, 

including Clinical Care Coordination and an Inter-Agency Team. 

Youth Engagement 

a.  Recommendation:  As  developmentally  appropriate,  children  placed  in  RTCs 
should  have  regular,  meaningful  opportunities  to  be  involved  in  decisions  that 
impact their lives. In TMC and PMC cases, planning meetings should routinely and 
regularly occur for children placed in RTCs, including discharge planning meetings. 
Children should be informed about and included in Circles of Support/Transition 
Planning Meetings and these meetings should occur as needed for children age 14 
and older placed in RTCs. P 34 MS 35 

The phrase “Nothing About Us Without Us” captures the sentiment that children in care should 
be involved in the decisions that impact their lives. Decisions related to placement in an RTC are 

certainly  no  exception  and  perhaps  the  need  for  their  engagement  is  enhanced  in  these 

circumstances.  This  includes  Circles  of  Support  and  Transition  Planning  Meetings  where 
important  discussions  occur  about  the  child’s  future,  including  discharge  from  an  RTC  and 

transition to adulthood. Decisions about how and when to engage children placed in RTCs should 

be made on a case by cases basis, taking into account the child’s developmental needs.  

b.  Recommendation:  As  developmentally  appropriate,  children  should  be 
provided with access to normalcy activities during RTC placements in order to 
develop skills to prepare them for a more family-like setting as well as adulthood. 
Training  should  be  provided  for  Residential  Child  Care  Regulation,  Residential 
Child  Care  Investigations,  and  Child  Protective  Investigations  on  translating 
minimum  standards  to  balance  risk  with  the  importance  of  ongoing  access  to 
normalcy activities and normal behaviors. P 36 MS37 

While the need for normalcy is not limited to children placed in RTCs, there must be intentional 

planning  to  provide  access  to  normalcy  activities  when  the  child  is  not  placed  in  a  home-like 

setting. The reasonable and prudent parent standard provides some guidance for caregivers about 
how to navigate what is and what is not age and developmentally appropriate. Again, every child’s 

needs and development will be different, as well which activities are of interest to the child. As a 

   

L = Legislative; $ = Financial Impact; MS = In Minimum Standards; P = DFPS Policy  21 

result, training should be provided to help balance the need for normalcy with the regulatory 

environment for RTC facilities. 

c.  Recommendation:  Prior  to  placement  and  at  intake,  the  child  should  be 
counseled that their presence is due to treatment goals and the climate at every 
RTC should reflect an atmosphere where children are encouraged that they are 
not placed there as punishment but rather to address their needs. 

To be successful in an RTC placement, a child must feel physically and emotionally safe. Young 
adults with lived experience reported a sense of stigma associated with an RTC placement and 

noted  that  they  felt  labeled  as  “bad  kids.”  Every  aspect  of  the  physical  environment  and 

interaction  with  staff  should  send  signals  to  children  placed  in  RTCs  that  the  reason  for  the 
placement is to address a therapeutic need, not to punish the child for any challenging behaviors.  

d.  Recommendation:  RTC  providers  should  adopt  a  youth  engagement 
framework which may include components of positive youth development, trauma 
informed  care,  or  restorative  practices. Youth  with  lived  experience  should  be 
consulted by RTCs at the organizational level (i.e., utilizing existing youth advisory 
councils or developing a council or Board of Directors position).  

While case level engagement is important for each individual child placed at an RTC, there are 

broader decisions about how an RTC operates that could be informed by young adults with lived 
experience  in  both  foster  care  and  in  an  RTC  placement.  Learning  from  those  with  lived 

experience  can  strengthen  an  RTC  at  the  organizational  level.  Adopting  a  youth  engagement 

framework would institutionalize the organization’s commitment to youth engagement and clarify 
practices and procedures related to youth engagement.  

e.  Recommendation: Youth with lived experience should be consulted to identify 
agency and statewide systems level improvements, including minimum standards 
and DFPS policy changes and protocols. L 

There are several existing organizations that provide a statewide forum for youth engagement to 

advise on broader, systemic issues. DFPS supports the Youth Leadership Council which provides 
a forum for youth who are currently or were formerly in foster care to discuss their experiences 

with the Texas foster care system and make recommendations to the Department for improving 
the  system.38  The  Texas  Network  of  Youth  Services  supports  the  Young  Adult  Leadership 
Council as a leadership program to engage youth and young adult leaders from across Texas. 39 
These councils should be utilized to inform improvements in the Texas child welfare system.  

   

L = Legislative; $ = Financial Impact; MS = In Minimum Standards; P = DFPS Policy  22 

f.  Recommendation:  As  indicated,  RTC  providers  should  consider  identifying 
youth-directed peer or near-peer support to help children navigate the placement 
and support successful transition planning. Reimbursable compensation should be 
provided for peer support. $ 

Engaging youth and young adults to serve as peer or near-peer support was cited as one strategy 

to provide additional help and encouragement for children placed in RTCs. It can be beneficial to 
have an individual who has been through similar circumstances to help children currently placed 

in an RTC to navigate the process. This type of support may not be appropriate for all youth and 

should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  

Family Engagement 

a.  Recommendation: Authentic family engagement must be a priority for DFPS, 
SSCCs,  CASAs,  attorneys,  judges,  and  all  RTC  providers  at  every  stage  of 
treatment  and  placement,  including  formal  steps  in  the  process  (i.e.,  court 
appearances,  treatment  team  meetings)  as  well  as  informal  opportunities  for 
engagement (i.e., sharing schoolwork, inclusion in campus activities as appropriate) 

Family  engagement  is  a  core  RTC  best  practice  and  requires  intentional  planning  and  follow 

through from every stakeholder in the child welfare system. Formal, traditional opportunities for 
family  engagement,  such  as  designated  court  appearances,  are  already  required  but  may  lack 

meaningful opportunities for input and collaboration. Equally important, informal opportunities 

for engagement encourage not only a sense of normalcy but also serve to promote permanency 
and well-being for children placed in RTCs.  

b.  Recommendation:  Effective  models  to  identify  and  engage  a  child’s  family 
should  be  supported  by  funding  and  utilized  to  the  extent  possible  to  identify 
supportive family connections for children placed in RTCs. $ 

While there are several models to operationalize family finding, CASA utilizes, and DFPS has a 
contract for staff to be trained to use, Collaborative Family Engagement (CFE). This is a contract 

requirement for QRTPs but not for RTCs. CFE may not be available in every region in Texas and 

each community should utilize a model that meets the needs of children and family and provides 

a thorough search of familial connections. Regardless of the model used, additional funding may 
be needed to ensure each community has access to the technology and staff support.  

c.  Recommendation: If no family or fictive kin is identified for a child at intake, 
RTC staff should work with the child as well as DFPS, SSCC staff, CASAs, and ad 

L = Legislative; $ = Financial Impact; MS = In Minimum Standards; P = DFPS Policy  23 

   

litems to identify familial contacts for the child regardless of whether the family 
member can provide a future placement for the child. $ 

Many  providers  want  to  help  identify  family  connections  for  children  placed  in their  RTCs  by 

intentionally creating a culture where family is identified for every child. This recommendation 
encourages  providers  to  collaborate  with  other  system  stakeholders  to  identify  family 

connections,  even  if  those  connections  cannot  serve  as  potential  placements.  Since  providers 

offer the daily care for the child, they may have access to information that others do not. There 
must be clear channels of communication for this critical information regarding potential family 

connections to be shared with all necessary stakeholders. There may be fiscal implications under 

the  standard  RTC  contract  if  this  is  required  by  providers;  this  engagement  is  a  requirement 

under the QRTP contract. 

d.  Recommendation:  Identifying  familial  connections  will  require  regular  or 
repeated  assessment  of  identified  family  members  to  determine  whether 
conditions have changed that could impact the role an individual can play in the 
child’s life. P 40 

Every family has unique and complex dynamics and families involved in the child welfare are no 
different. Life circumstances can change quickly and a family member or kin who was previously 

not in a position to provide support or placement may become able to do so at any point in 

time. As a result, it is a best practice for child welfare stakeholders to make ongoing efforts to 
review and locate supportive connections for children placed in RTCs.  

e.  Recommendation: Although family engagement is important on a case-specific 
basis, it can also benefit RTCs to implement practices related to family engagement 
at the organizational level, such as including individuals with lived experience on 
Boards or in hiring decisions. 

Similar to the recommendation about youth engagement above, family engagement is critical at 

both  the  case  and  system  levels.  RTCs  should  consider  integrating  individuals  with  lived 

experience  in  key  decisions  at  the  organizational  level  so  that  all  aspects  of  the  facilities 
functioning  can  benefit  from  the  insights  of  those  who  have  experienced  something  similar 

firsthand.  

f.  Recommendation:  DFPS,  SSCCs,  and  RTC  providers  should  consider 
identifying family partner support services to help families navigate the placement 
and support successful transition planning. L $ 

   

L = Legislative; $ = Financial Impact; MS = In Minimum Standards; P = DFPS Policy  24 

Peer support can be beneficial for children placed in RTCs; similarly, their family members may 

also  benefit  from  help  with  navigating  the  placement  and  the  child  welfare  system  generally. 
Working  with  designated  points  of  contact  to  ask  questions  about  treatment  and  transition 

planning,  family members may better understand the process and be better equipped to support 

children when they leave an RTC.  

Treatment Model 

a.  Recommendation: The treatment model, interventions, and services provided 
at each RTC should be easily accessible in a transparent, readily available manner 
so that all system stakeholders have access to information about which services 
are  provided  in  each  facility.  Evidence-based  practices  should  be  indicated, 
prioritized, and encouraged. L $ MS 41 

This was the only recommendation that was generated independently by both the SB 1575 Legal 

Subgroup and the RTC Best Practices Subgroup. The goal of the recommendation is for RTCs 
to provide transparent, public information about what treatment services are available to meet 

the needs of discrete populations of youth. Judges, attorneys, CASAs, and others indicated that 

unless they conduct independent research, it is not clear what services and supports are offered 
at each RTC. This it is very challenging to determine if the placement is in the best interests of 

the child. While the recommendation is aimed at transparency and clarity around which services 

are  provided  at  each  facility,  there  was  also  an  acknowledgment  that  RTCs  must  maintain 

flexibility to tailor those services to meet each child’s needs. If this information is made publicly 
available,  there  would  likely  be  a  fiscal  implication  for developing  a  central  place  to store and 

maintain the information.  

& Res. Code 42.256. 

Note: HHSC has not yet drafted a rule related to the treatment model required in Tex. Health 

b.  Recommendation:  DFPS,  HHSC,  SSCCs,  RTCs  should  offer  culturally 
responsive and supportive services to meet children’s needs and identities. MS 42 

Each  child  placed  in  an  RTC  is  unique  and  brings  their  own  culture  and  identity  to  the 
environment. There should be enough flexibility to provide a consistent treatment model but 

make any modifications necessary to be responsive to each child’s individual needs.  

c.  Recommendation: Since the Qualified Residential Treatment Program (QRTP) 
is a new treatment intervention in Texas, additional study and evaluation is needed 

   

L = Legislative; $ = Financial Impact; MS = In Minimum Standards; P = DFPS Policy  25 

to determine which elements, if any, of the QRTP model should apply to the RTC 
model.  

SB  1575  workgroup  and  subgroup  members  agreed  that  more  time  is  needed  to  better 

understand and evaluate the QRTP model before it is applied to RTC models in Texas. As QRTPs 
roll out in Texas and nationwide, there are many lessons to learn from how to best implement 

the model and which children are the best match for placement. When more information about 

the QRTP model is available, DFPS and other system stakeholders can consider which aspects of 
the model can or should apply to RTC placements.  

Trauma-Informed & Trauma-Responsive 

a.  Recommendation: Every RTC should implement trauma-informed & trauma-
responsive  policies  and  practices  to  address  the  trauma,  grief,  and  loss 
experienced  by  children  and  families  in  the  child  welfare  system.  This  includes 
reviewing the use of restraints and seclusions and actions that may retraumatize 
children. MS 43 

It is difficult for a child placed in an RTC to make progress in their treatment unless the trauma, 
grief, and loss they experienced can be addressed in a safe environment. The RTC environment, 

services, and procedures should be viewed through a trauma lens. Handling challenging behaviors 

without  the  use  of restraint  or seclusion  is  a  concrete example  of  how to  provide  a  trauma-
responsive environment.  

b.  Recommendation: The child’s family members should be engaged in the child’s 

therapeutic interventions aimed at addressing intergenerational trauma. $ 

While the primary focus during an RTC placement may be on the child’s treatment, often their 

family members have also experienced trauma and could benefit from inclusion in therapeutic 

interventions  that  address  intergenerational  trauma.  This is  not  a  current  offering  at RTCs  in 
Texas because there is no mechanism in place to pay for those services. If additional funding were 

available, this type of therapeutic intervention could promote healing for both the child and the 

family.  

RTC Best Practice Framework 

a.  Recommendation: RTC providers should identify and become familiar with the 
standards set out in a research-supported, evidence-based, or promising practice 

   

L = Legislative; $ = Financial Impact; MS = In Minimum Standards; P = DFPS Policy  26 

framework  which  support  positive  outcomes  for  children  who  are  involved  in 
placements in an RTC. The framework should include child, family, and community 
collaboration, clinical care and excellence as well as transition planning and services 
for youth 15 years or older. $ 

Due to a variety of factors, the operation of RTCs require compliance with various rules and 

regulations. As a consequence, the focus can be on compliance and minimum standards rather 
than  promoting  best  practices.  While  RTCs  must  certainly  maintain  their  commitment  to 

compliance, examining or adopting a best practice framework can help keep the focus on the 

innovation  and  engagement  RTCs  provide.  While  this  report  does  not  suggest  one  particular 
framework, the primary framework discussed by the workgroup and subgroups was the Building 
Bridges  Initiative  (BBI). 44 BBI  was cited  a comprehensive  example  of  a framework  that  can  be 
adopted in whole or in part by an RTC provider to elevate practices.  

Additional funding may be needed to support the selected framework implementation, including 

funding for training, technical assistance, data collection and analysis, and additional staff. Existing 
expertise and funding should be leveraged to the extent possible. 

b.  Recommendation:  RTC  providers  should  prioritize  the  selected  framework 
best practice components and work to elevate those priorities in an accessible 
and transparent manner.  

Every RTC has strengths and opportunities for improvement. As a result, there cannot be a “one 
size fits all” approach to the adoption of a best practice framework. Each RTC should identify 

priority areas to implement best practices. This process can be iterative and different priorities 

may surface over time.  

c.  Recommendation:  When  implementing  the  selected  framework  practices, 
RTCs should integrate a community based-approach and coordinate with Local 
Mental Health Authorities.  

Having  a  robust  partnership  with  members  of  the  community  should  be  identified  as  a  key 

component  of  any  best  practice  framework.  Local  Mental  Health  Authorities  (LMHAs),  Local 

Intellectual  and  Developmental  Disability  Authorities  (LIDDAs),  as  well  as  other  community 
partners  have  access  to  resources  and  support  during  and  after  RTC  placements.  Strong 

communication and collaboration with community partners will strengthen both the support for 

individual children and the RTC at an organizational level.

a.  Recommendation:  Efforts  to  develop  capacity  both  regionally  and  statewide 
should address the needs of all children, including but not limited to young children 
as well as children with Intellectual or Developmental Disabilities, Autism, sensory 
issues,  a  history  of  juvenile  justice  involvement,  a  history  of  violence,  medical 
issues, complex mental health diagnoses, and learning disabilities, etc. $ 

Discussions related to best practices naturally coincided with concerns about developing capacity 

in Texas. Developing capacity is an ongoing effort throughout Texas; some examples are capacity 
building  specialists/teams  at  DFPS,  House  Bill  5  (87th  Legislative  Session)  capacity  grants, 
Treatment  Foster  Family  Care,  and  QRTPs.  Rate  modernization  also  is  intended  to  assist  in 

capacity-building efforts. This recommendation highlights the specific need to develop capacity 

for sub-populations of children with special needs.  

b.  Recommendation: DFPS and SSCC staff should prioritize a localized approach 
to placement in RTCs to allow children to remain in Texas and close to home and 
to maintain connections to the community in the least restrictive placement so 
long as therapeutically indicated. P45  

In shifting to Community-Based Care, Texas is investing in keeping children closer to home and 
closer to family connections. Many children benefit from remaining close to home because they 

can  maintain  connections  to  supportive  peers  and  adults  as  well  as  remain  in  a  familiar 

environment. For some children, a new environment may be therapeutically indicated (e.g., for a 
trafficking  survivor)  and  this  should  be  taken  into  account.  One  significant  benefit  of  these 

capacity-building efforts is keeping children in DFPS conservatorship placed within Texas in lieu 

of sending children to an out of state facility. 

Duration of Placement 

a.  Recommendation: In an ongoing manner, RTC providers should communicate 
to  the  attorneys,  advocates,  and  child  as  developmentally  appropriate,  the 
anticipated  treatment  duration,  benchmarks,  and  progress  towards  discharge 
rather than leave the duration of placement open-ended. MS46  

When the duration of placement is open-ended, it is challenging for a child to set expectations 

and goals for treatment and discharge. Similarly, attorneys and advocates may not have a clear 

sense  of  how  long  the  child  will  be  placed  at  the  RTC  and  this  makes  it  difficult  to  plan  for 

L = Legislative; $ = Financial Impact; MS = In Minimum Standards; P = DFPS Policy  28 

Capacity 

   

discharge and encourage a realistic permanency plan. This recommendation suggests that clearer 

communication about the expected duration of treatment and the milestones the child needs to 
meet will create more transparency in the process and ensure everyone is on the same page 

about expectations for the child during the RTC placement.  

b.  Recommendation:  DFPS  policy  and  practice  should  be  clear  that  formal 
discharge notice is not required to start looking for a subsequent placement. P47 

Several providers emphasized the need to start looking for the subsequent placement early in 

the RTC placement so that thoughtful and thorough discharge planning could occur. Rather than 

wait until the end of the placement, providers suggested that a subsequent placement resource 
should be identified and included in not only discharge planning but also in treatment while the 

child  is  placed  at  the  facility.  DFPS  should  allow  for  informal  communication  with  providers 

instead of requiring a provider to file notice of discharge to trigger the process to identify another 
placement. 

c.  Recommendation: Treatment staffings should occur at least every 30 days, with 
notice provided in advance to families and all legal attorneys and advocates. MS48 

Holding staffings every 30 days was identified as a best practice for all RTCs to ensure each child’s 

progress is reviewed on a regular basis. To ensure everyone has access to critical information 

about each child’s treatment and progress, families, attorneys, and advocates should be notified 
about the staffings.  

Transition Planning 

c.  Recommendation: Pre-placement interviews or visits should occur on a routine 
basis before children are placed in an RTC. This could include identifying which 
school the child would attend while placed at the RTC. P49 

Pre-placement interviews or visits are already allowed but workgroup and subgroup members 
noted that this approach is not regularly used throughout the state. Allowing the child to see 

where they will be placed can help set expectations and address any concerns the child may have 

about the placement. Since school is a critical aspect of any child’s life, ideally any pre-placement 
interview or visit would address where the child will attend school (i.e., on campus charter, local 

school district campus).  

d.  Recommendation: Upon entry into an RTC placement, children (and families 
as  appropriate)  should  have  an  introduction  to  the  facility  and  what  it  offers, 

   

L = Legislative; $ = Financial Impact; MS = In Minimum Standards; P = DFPS Policy  29 

information on their rights and the rights of the child, and what the child and family 
can expect for the duration of the placement. MS 50 

Every child should have an orientation to an RTC facility when they are placed, including what 

services  and  activities  are  offered  and  what  to  expect  from  daily  life.  In  addition,  information 
should be provided about the child’s rights while in care including how to access their attorney, 

advocate, and Foster Care Ombudsman. As appropriate depending on the status of the child’s 

ability to be in contact with the family, family involvement, and legal status, family members should 
receive similar information about the RTC.  

e.  Recommendation:  All  stakeholders  must  set  the  expectation  that  transition 
planning  will  begin  on  Day  One  of  the  placement  to  encourage  healing  and 
permanency for the child. 

It takes intentional planning and practice to start transition planning early instead of addressing 

this key area when the child is almost ready to be discharged from an RTC. The culture at an 
RTC should set the expectation that the child will have a smooth transition from the RTC to the 

next  placement  or  return  to  family.  If  transition  planning  begins  early,  the  child  has  a  better 

understanding of what will happen after the placement and this gives the child something to work 
towards.  

f.  Recommendation: In non-emergencies, DFPS and SSCCs must communicate a 
change in placement to the RTC placement and the child with adequate time (no 
later than 48 hours) to prepare for the transition. P51 

Absent an emergency, RTC staff should receive notice as early as possible that a child will change 

placements. This will give the RTC staff time to prepare the child for the transition and document 
any information that needs to be provided to the subsequent placement in a timely manner.  

g.  Recommendation: Administrative and financial barriers should be addressed to 
allow subsequent placements to reserve a bed (ideally up to 14 days) for the child 
if the subsequent placement is a good match to meet the child’s needs. $  

One significant barrier for transition planning is the limitation on holding a subsequent placement 

for a child. This is challenging when an appropriate placement is identified but the child is not yet 
ready for discharge. There are administrative challenges as well as financial barriers that would 

need to be addressed to provide this additional flexibility. However, the result could promote 

permanency and more supportive transitions for children placed in RTCs.  

   

L = Legislative; $ = Financial Impact; MS = In Minimum Standards; P = DFPS Policy  30 

h.  Recommendation:  DFPS,  SSCC,  and RTC  staff  must  utilize  opportunities  to 

provide input into a subsequent placement for the child. P52 

DFPS, SSCCs, and RTC staff have access to a plethora of information about a child’s treatment, 

progress,  and  daily  functioning.  Establishing  clear  channels  of  communication  will  ensure  this 
information is not lost and that each entity has opportunities to provide input on the subsequent 

placement. With  a more  complete  picture  of the  child’s  needs, it  will be  easier to match  the 

subsequent placement to the child’s needs and equip the subsequent placement to meet those 
needs.  

i.  Recommendation:  To  the  extent  practicable,  children  should  have  the 
opportunity to maintain positive connections developed in an RTC after leaving 
the placement. This includes ensuring RTC staff and peer support contacts remain 
on the child’s call list after the child leaves the RTC as appropriate. P53  

Every  time  a  child  changes  placements,  there  is  a  potential  loss  of  supportive  peer  and  adult 

connections.  Although  determinations  must  be  made  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  children  should 

have an opportunity to maintain contact with these supportive individuals after they leave the 

RTC placement.  

j.  Recommendation: Members of the community where the child will reside after 
the  RTC  placement  should  be  given  the  opportunity  to  be  involved  in  the 
transition planning process; this includes but is not limited to schools and the Local 
Mental Health Authorities. 

As  mentioned  above,  community  partnerships  support  RTC  best  practices  and  for  this 
recommendation, those relationships in the community should be utilized to support transition 

planning.  The  result  of  these  partnerships  will  be  greater  continuity  in  mental  health  and 

educational support so that children can maintain the progress they achieve while placed at an 
RTC.  

k.  Recommendation: Aftercare of up to six months should be utilized if available 
to support a successful transition after a child exits an RTC placement and the 
legal parties should be aware of the plan and duration of aftercare services. $ 

The RTC model is designed to provide an intensive therapeutic environment. If children respond 
to those interventions while placed at an RTC, it can be beneficial to continue to follow up with 

aftercare after the child leaves the placement. Aftercare can also address any challenges during 

   

L = Legislative; $ = Financial Impact; MS = In Minimum Standards; P = DFPS Policy  31 

the transition after the placement and support the subsequent placement. To be realized with 

regularity and uniformity, there may be a cost associated with this recommendation.  

Data 

a.  Recommendation: DFPS, SSCCs, and RTC staff should collect and analyze data 
on measures related to RTC placements including, but not limited to, length of 
RTC  placements,  subsequent  placement  type,  number  of  RTC  placements  per 
child,  use  of  restraints  and  seclusion,  reason  for  discharge,  and  FFPSA  post-
discharge metrics. L $ 

Data collection and analysis were identified as a central component of RTC best practices. To 
strengthen  practices  and  support  continuous  quality  improvement,  DFPS,  SSCCs  and  RTCs 

should identify priority data points and a mechanism to track shared metrics. This would likely 

have a fiscal implication for fields that are not already collected and/or shared.  

b.  Recommendation: Identify a publicly available landing page to allow for access 

to shared data measures. L $ 

Similar to the recommendation above regarding consolidating information about RTC treatment 

models,  a  publicly  available  landing  page  would  allow  for  increased  access  to  shared  data 
measures. Transparent access to this information will assist system stakeholders in determining 

whether proposed placements are a good fit to meet the needs of each child.  

c.  Recommendation: HHSC, in collaboration with DFPS and TJJD, should track 
and identify gaps in short-term and long-term treatment service array for children 
who may be placed in an RTC, including step down facilities and treatment foster 
care,  regardless  of  whether  the  placement  is  connected  to  the  public  mental 
health, juvenile justice, or child welfare system or other child-serving system. L $ 

While  HHSC,  DFPS,  and  TJJD  all  track  capacity  needs  and  service  gaps,  an  interagency  data 

analysis  would  support  a  more  robust  understanding  of  the  needs  of  children  in  Texas  and 

encourage the more efficient use of limited resources.  

Rate Modernization 

a.  Recommendation: This report contains no recommendations regarding rates 
that are independent of the foster care rate modernization proposal underway by 

   

L = Legislative; $ = Financial Impact; MS = In Minimum Standards; P = DFPS Policy  32 

DFPS, including support for elimination of Levels of Care. Standards of care should 
be developed once the rate methodology is finalized and put into practice.  

There is significant overlap with encouraging RTC best practices and efforts underway to evaluate 

rate modernization. Multiple presentations were provided to the SB 1575 RTC Best Practices 
Subgroup in order to align the priorities of both efforts.  

V.  Conclusion 

The  SB  1575  Workgroup,  Legal  Subgroup,  and  RTC  Best  Practices  Subgroup  took  a 
multidisciplinary approach to assessing the legal landscape and best practices for RTCs in Texas. 

The recommendations included in this report will need to be prioritized at the state, regional, 

and  local  areas.  Many  recommendations  are  aimed  at  ensuring  the  existing  law,  policy,  and 

standards are implemented with fidelity for every child placed in an RTC. To  transform these 
recommendations  into  practice,  continued  oversight  will  be  needed.  If  an  existing  body  can 

oversee implementation, prioritizing these recommendations should be added to the charge. One 

potential existing oversight body is the Committee on Advancing Residential Practices (CARP). 
CARP membership is primarily comprised of DFPS, SSCCs, and provider representatives so if 

CARP is selected as the appropriate oversight body, there should be some consideration given 

to creating a working group that includes other stakeholders such as judges, attorneys, advocates, 
and individuals with lived experience.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
