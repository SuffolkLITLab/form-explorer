Each  of  these  elements  must  be  completed  for  the  application  to  receive  full  consideration.  Carefully  review  any 
formatted  content  pasted into the  online system,  which  will  only accept  basic formatting.  The  sections of  the  grant 
application are: 
  

   

  A

  F

  A

a.  Introduction (Executive Summary)—In one hundred (100) words or less, describe the program and 
its main goals. This paragraph will be the abstract of the project. Clearly state what the program will 
do and the broad goals that will be met if the program is funded. The summary will be most useful if it 
is prepared after the application itself has been developed in order to summarize effectively the key 
elements of the project. 

b.  Problem Statement—Describe the issue or problem the proposed activity is intended to improve or 
correct. Make a clear, concise, and well-supported statement of the problem to be addressed. Provide 
any formal or informal data related to the problem. Include information about the affected populations, 
social and economic costs of the issue, and resources currently used.  

c.  Objectives—Develop clear targets and goals for the program to accomplish. State how the objectives 

address the problem stated above. 

i.  Objectives must be directly related to the program in this application and the funds requested. 
ii.  Objectives must be time and date specific and measurable. 
iii.  Objectives are the basis for the evaluation and progress reports. 
iv.  Objectives must be consistent with the Problem Statement. 
v.  Technical Support Applications should also identify research questions in this section. 
d.  Activities—Describe the specific activities the applicant will conduct if awarded a grant.  The activities 

should support the objectives.   

i.  Include detailed instructions of step-by-step procedures that will take place to implement the 

program and the resources needed to complete each task.

implement the program.  

iv.  Write this section so that outsiders know exactly what the applicant plans to do.  
v.  Provide justification related to effectiveness and/or economy of the activity proposed. Include 

supporting research on this activity if available.   

vi.  Describe whether existing staff and/or contractors will perform tasks, reports, etc. or if new 
staff positions will be created to implement the program. If the program will be implemented 
through a contract, include information on the selection process. 

vii.  If the proposed program implements a new component into an existing process or program, 

clarify how the new process is different from existing programs. 

e.  Evaluation—Describe the process that  will  be  used  to  determine  whether  the  program  has met  the 

stated objectives and the measures that will be used to demonstrate the program’s impact.  

i.  Evaluation must be linked directly to the objectives and activities. The evaluation must measure 
both the progress made toward implementing the grant-funded activity and the effect of the 
program once it is in operation.

indigence and requests for appointed counsel will be accepted electronically and maintained in 
an online data management system”). 

iii.  Measures must be quantifiable (e.g., count the number of requests for counsel received). 
iv.  Measures must be time-specific (e.g., requests for counsel will be counted from February to 

January and reported monthly). 

v.  Measures must identify the manner in which they will be recorded for future review (e.g., a 
case management system report). Data collection cooperation agreements with county offices 
and departments are strongly recommended so that the applicant can demonstrate it will be able 
to meet data collection and evaluation goals.  

vi.  The measure  of success is determined  by the  goals  and  objectives  of the  proposed activity. 
Describe how milestones, accomplishments, and timelines will be tracked and recorded. 
vii.  Evaluations  must  demonstrate  how  the  program  impacts  other  county  processes  when 
applicable.  Evaluations  of  program  success  should  be  considered  from  both  fiscal  and 
programmatic perspectives.

ii.  Provide a narrative to detail and justify all budgeted expenses. This narrative must correspond 

to the activities section.  

iii.  Indicate in the budget and narrative the non-reoccurring start-up costs for multi-year grants.  
iv.  Indirect  costs  are allowable  but  the  application  will not  be  considered  competitive if above 

10%. Preferred applications will include little or no indirect cost requirements. 

v.  The  equipment  line  requires  a  list  of  equipment  to  be  purchased.  All  equipment  must  be 
purchased in the first  year  of  the  grant unless  permission is  granted from  TIDC  in  writing. 
Otherwise, the equipment costs will not factor into the total project cost after the first year of 
funding. 

vi.  Budget line items must include detailed basis of cost explanations in the budget narrative.

In addition to the full grant application narrative and budget described above, applicants must submit the 
following: 
 

1.  Resolution/Internet  Submission  Form—Counties  applying 

the 
Resolution/Internet  Submission  Form  (See  Attachment  A)  in  order  for  the  Commission  to  consider  the 
application. The resolution must be adopted by the County Commissioners Court, signed by the applicant’s 
authorized  official,  and  uploaded  to  the  online  grant  application.  Nonprofit  organization  applicants  should 
submit a resolution adopted by their governing board authorizing the application and additional documentation 
of county support and coordination.  

for  grants  must  also 

submit 

•  The adopted resolution is the official authorization for the grant request. It names the grant officials 
required in Texas Administrative Code § 173.301. It is also a pledge to take legal responsibility for the 
appropriate expenditure of grant funds. Finally, it certifies that the applicant will abide by all relevant 
rules, policies, and procedures if TIDC awards grant funds to the applicant.  

•  The Internet Submission Form is a separate form located on the bottom of the Resolution Form.  The 
Internet  Submission  Form  must  contain  the  confirmation  number  that  will  be  generated  when  the 
application is submitted.  The confirmation number may be completed by hand after the Resolution 
Form is approved by Commissioners Court and the application is submitted. 

2.  Judicial Support—The judiciary is responsible for each county’s Indigent Defense Plan. Applications must 
include letter(s) of support from the judges who will participate in or implement the program (See Attachment 
B). Attachment B is a sample form and must be edited to describe the level and type of commitment the judges 
will provide to the specific program in the application.  

3.  Additional Requirements for Public Defender or Managed Assigned Counsel Programs—Applicants 
must provide an Oversight Board plan describing the membership positions, board structure, and board 
responsibilities. (Note: Applicants are not required to name individual board members in the application, but 
rather board member positions, such as “member of the defense bar,” “community member,” or “law 
professor focused on criminal law.”) Applicants must also provide a Leadership Selection Plan that outlines 
the recruitment and selection of the program’s chief defender.  See TIDC guidance in A Guide to Public 
Defender Oversight Boards, Texas Chief Defender Sample Hiring Rubric, and Sample Chief Public Defender 
Job Description, available at http://www.tidc.texas.gov/improvement/system-building/.  

4.  Other  Supporting  Documents—Additional  material  such  as  timelines,  data  collection  cooperation 
agreements, letters of support, additional budget detail, or other supporting documents must be uploaded in the 
online application form before the application due date. Nonprofit applicants must also submit organizational 
information, including articles of incorporation, documentation of current nonprofit status, and list of members 
of the governing board, and documentation of county support and coordination.  

5.  Additional Requirements for Technology Grant Requests—Budget narratives for technology projects must 
include detailed basis of cost information. In addition, TIDC has issued Functionality and Data Guidelines for 
Indigent Defense Technology Projects that should be carefully reviewed when preparing software-related grant 
applications.  Applications  should  address  the  extent  to  which  the  proposed  project  is  consistent  with  the 
guidelines, as well as the reasons for any departures from the guidelines. 

pplications  must  be  submitted  online.    For  priority  consideration,  applications,  commissioners  court 
resolutions, documentation of judicial support, and any other supporting documents should be submitted by 5:00 
PM on May 8, 2023. Applications submitted after this date may be considered for funding based on availability of any 
funds remaining after award decisions on applications meeting the priority deadline. A confirmation number will be 
generated by the system for all online submissions. This is the number that needs to be entered in the Internet Submission 
Form portion (bottom) of the commissioners court resolution template.  

eneral Application Requirements  

 

a.  New Programs and Positions—Only new programs or positions will be funded. This may include adding 
new  positions  or  new  elements  to  existing  programs. The  application must clearly  demonstrate  that  the 
requested positions will perform work that is not currently provided.    

b.  Maximum Applications—An applicant may submit one new application per fiscal year.  
c.  Grant Officials—Each grant application must designate the following:

i.  Program director. This person must be the officer or employee responsible for program operation 
or  monitoring  and  will  serve  as  the  point-of-contact  regarding  the  program’s  day-to-day 
operations. 

ii.  Financial officer. For counties, this person must be the county auditor or county treasurer if the 
applicant  does  not  have  a  county  auditor.  Other  applicants  must  designate  the  chief  financial 
officer.  

iii.  Authorized  official.  This  person  must  be  authorized  by  the  commissioners  court  or  governing 
board to apply for, accept, decline, modify, or cancel the grant for the applicant. A county judge 
or  a  designee  authorized  by  the  governing  body  in  its  resolution  may  serve  as  the  authorized 
official. 

iv.  The program director and the authorized official may be the same person. The financial officer 

may not serve as the program director or the authorized official. 

Fiscal Application Requirements 
 

a.  Multi-Year Funding—Funding is available for multi-year programs (four years), or rural regional public 
defender  sustainability  grants  (ongoing)  to  encourage  innovative  long-term  programs  to  improve  the 
delivery of indigent services. Continued awards for multi-year programs can be renewed up to program 
limits, but TIDC only awards funding for the current fiscal year.   

b.  Equipment Costs—Equipment and other one-time costs will only be funded in the first year of the grant 
unless permission is granted by TIDC in writing. The Commission’s portion of the grant and the cash match 
after the first year of funding will be calculated based on the total project costs less the equipment expenses 
from the first year. 

c.  Calculating the Cash Match 

i.  Formulas: 

ii.  Match Requirements: 

1.  Total Project Cost multiplied by percent of match required = Total Match Required 
2.  Total Project Cost minus Total Match Required = Total Commission Grant Request 

1.  Multi-year Improvement Grant Requests—Counties must provide a cash match from county or other 
funds of 20% of total project costs in the first funding year, 40% the second funding year, 60% the third 
funding year, and 80% the fourth funding year. An applicant’s use of matching funds must comply with 
the same statutes, rules, regulations, and guidelines applicable to the use of the Commission funded 
portion of a grant project.  

2.  Rural Regional Public Defender Sustainability Grant Requests—Counties with a population less than 
100,000 participating with other counties in a multi-county (3+) regional public defender office are 
eligible  for  80%  reimbursement  in  the  initial  year  of  funding.  In  subsequent  years  of  funding, 
participating counties must provide a cash match of 1/3rd of the total approved budget. A participating 
county’s  individual  share  of  the  cash  match  is  determined  by  the  interlocal  agreement  between 
participating  counties.  The  participating  counties  collectively  contribute  the  required  cash  match 
amount, typically calculated based on caseload or population. 

3.  Single-Year  Videoconferencing—Applications  for  videoconferencing  equipment  require  a  fifty 
percent (50%) cash match. Counties may use the videoconferencing system for any hearings authorized 
under Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Chapter 46B.  

4.  Technology Projects—Software development projects with significant direct indigent defense benefits 
impacting  multiple  counties  may  be  grant  funded  at  up  to  50%.    Indigent  defense  software 
implementation projects, including CUC TechShare Indigent Defense implementation (involving set-
up,  configuration,  and  training)  requires  a  50%  match.  Maintenance  and  operations  costs  for  CUC 
TechShare Indigent Defense are not eligible for Improvement Grant funds. Business process consulting 
associated  with  preparation  to  implement  software,  computer  system  connectivity  and  integration 
projects  and  county-specific  modifications  to  software  developed  through  multi-county  TIDC  grant 
projects are not eligible for Improvement Grant funds.   

5.  Use of Program Income—Applicants must apply any program income to expenses prior to submitting 

reimbursement claims under the grant.

in response to submitted applications.  

f.  Competitive  Application  Process—The  application  process  for  TIDC’s  Improvement  Grant  Program  is 
competitive. Awards are based on a review of the grant application and supporting documentation. Receipt of 
a Notice to Proceed with Application does not guarantee funding by TIDC or alter the competitive nature of the 
process. 

g.  Review Criteria—TIDC staff will review each grant using objective tools and comparative analysis. The 

weight given to each section or combination of sections is at the sole discretion of TIDC.  

h.  Final  Selection—TIDC  may  select  and  award  programs  that  reflect  geographic  diversity,  demographic 

diversity, and/or distinctive program elements at its own discretion. 

i.  Future Funding for Multi-Year Projects—TIDC generally awards funding only for the current grant year. 
Future funding will be based on the submission of a brief application to continue funding in subsequent years 
up to eligible limits, submission of required progress reports, a demonstration of successful progress made in

each year. If the implementation of the grant program results in a reduction of the county’s indigent defense 
expenditures below the baseline, formula grant funds may be withheld by TIDC. 

k.  Delayed Start—TIDC’s Period for Funding and Program Operation is October 1 to September 30. Counties 
may  begin  to  make  program  expenditures  on  October  1;  however,  multi-year  grant  programs  occasionally 
require counties to postpone expenditures for several months. The hiring of the first program position typically 
marks the first month of program operation for multi-year grants. In order to allow a grantee to take advantage 
of the typical first-year 80% cash match, the funding amounts will be calculated from the first month of program 
operation. If approved for continued funding, the grantee will enter into the next grant period with the previous 
year’s reimbursement rate for a temporary period that is equal to the duration of the first year’s delay. The 
remainder of the renewed grant period will be reimbursed at the match rate for the corresponding grant year. 
This process will carry forward each year until the program is complete. Grant documentation will reflect the 
grantee’s funding schedule and any adjustments that may be required because of the delayed start of program 
operation. 

l.  Supplanting Prohibited—Commission funding can only be awarded for new programs; a county may not 

reduce the amount of funds provided for indigent defense services because of a grant award. 

m.  Dual Use—If an applicant applies for an indigent defense program that may be tied to a general government 
process, the applicant must provide documentation and rationale to establish a basis of costs to determine the 
portion of a program/project that is attributable to indigent defense. 

a.  Fund Use—Funds must be used to pay for the direct and/or administrative costs of providing and/or improving 

rogram Fiscal Requirements 

indigent defense services. 

b.  Allowable Costs—Grants may be used for:  

i.  Attorney fees for indigent defendants accused of crimes or juvenile offenses;  
ii.  Expenses for licensed investigators, experts, forensic specialists, or mental health experts related to the 

criminal defense of indigent defendants; and  

iii.  Other  approved  expenses  allowed  by  this  grant  program  or  necessary  for  the  operation  of  a  funded 

program. 

c.  Unallowable  Costs—TIDC  has  adopted  the  Texas  Grant  Management  Standards  (TxGMS)  to  determine 
unallowable costs. See TxGMS for a full list of unallowable costs. Specifically, in accordance with TxGMS 
and the grant rules the following conditions apply: 
i.  General government costs are unallowable; 
ii.  Costs of law enforcement, prosecution, supervision, and incarceration are unallowable; 
iii.  Replacing existing county funding with grant funds is unallowable; and  
iv.  Funding positions that previously existed or currently exist in the county is unallowable. 

d.  Failure  to  Begin—Failure  to  begin  operating  the  program  before  the  end  of  the  grant  award  period  may 

constitute a failure to meet performance measures unless authorized by TIDC. 

Grantee Reporting Requirements 

a.  Maintain  Official  Contact  Information—All  counties  must  maintain  correct  grant  official  contact 
information on TIDC’s Grant, Reporting, and Plan Management Website (http://tidc.tamu.edu). Counties must 
advise  TIDC  of  changes  in  the  authorized  official,  program  director,  financial  officer,  local  administrative 
district judge, local statutory county judge and county judge by updating contact information. TIDC staff will 
use e-mail whenever possible to notify counties of required reports and funding opportunities. 

b.  Reports—Online  fiscal  and  program  reports  are  required  each  quarter.  All  grants  will  require  at  least  one 
follow-up report outside of the grant period. A reporting schedule will be provided in the Statement of Grant 
Award (SGA) if TIDC authorizes a grant award. 

Program Records Requirements 

 

a.  Data Collection and Agreements—Grantees must collect data to support the evaluation of the program’s 

impact and compliance with the Fair Defense Act. This may require data collection agreements from county 
offices or departments to provide information to the program director on a regular basis. 

b.  Records Retention—Grantees must maintain records related to the funded activity for at least three years after 

the end of the grant period. Records may be stored electronically.

c.  Monitoring and Auditing—Records must be made available to TIDC or its designees upon request. (See Texas 

Administrative Code § 173.401 for more details.) 

rogram Equipment and Purchasing Requirements 

a.  Use DIR State Contract—Counties must purchase all technology, equipment and software must be purchased 
from the Department of Information Resources (DIR) State Contract. A county may submit a written request 
for exception that demonstrates why the DIR contract cannot be used for this project or is not cost-effective. 
Entities  not  eligible  to  purchase  under  the  DIR  contract  must  adopt  and  follow  procurement  policies  and 
document cost comparisons prior to making equipment purchases.  

b.  Inventory—Equipment  purchased  with  grant  funds  by  a  county  is  the  property  of  the  county.  Non-county 
grantees must include in their proposal a plan for equipment purchased with grant funds when the program 
ends. TIDC requires each grantee to maintain an inventory record of all equipment purchased with grant funds. 
After the grant period expires, the grantee must complete a physical inventory of all grant funded property and 
must  reconcile  the  results  with  the  existing  property  records.  The  inventory  report  must  be  submitted  and 
reconcile with the final financial expenditure report.  

c.  Equipment and Software Maintenance—All equipment purchased with grant funds may include up to three 
(3) years of maintenance to ensure the equipment will operate as intended during and beyond the grant period. 
For multi-year grants, the cost of the actual equipment and other one-time costs will only be funded the 
first year of the grant and will not factor into the overall project costs in subsequent years of funding. 
d.  Technology  Standards—Software  developed  with  grant  funds  must  conform  to  applicable  industry 
information  exchange  standards  including  the  National  Information  Exchange  Model  (NIEM)  and  the 
Electronic Case File (ECF) 4 standards.  Applications that include information technology projects must also 
address how the projects meet applicable technology standards adopted by the Texas Department of Information 
Resources  (DIR)  and  Judicial  Committee  on  Information  Technology  (JCIT)  as  applicable.  If  no  relevant 
standards are available from DIR or JCIT, then the county must meet commonly accepted technology standards 
such as Open Data Base Compliant (ODBC) or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) as 
applicable. 

Contracting Requirements 

a.  Professional and Contractual Services—Any contract or agreement entered into by a grantee that obligates 
grant funds from TIDC must be in writing and consistent with Texas contract law. Grantees must establish a 
contract administration system to ensure that contract deliverables are provided as specified in the contract. 
Grantees must regularly and consistently document the results of their contract monitoring reviews and must 
maintain the files and results of all contract monitoring reviews in accordance with the record retention 
requirements described in this section of the RFA. A grantee’s failure to monitor its contracts may result in 
disallowed costs.  

b.  Commission Review—Contracts with third parties for core services in funded programs must be provided to 

TIDC and approved prior to execution.  

c.  Contract Performance Monitoring—Grantees that use grant funds to contract for services must develop and 
include in the contract provisions to monitor each contract that is for more than $10,000 per year. These 
provisions must include specific actions to be taken if the grantee discovers that the contractor’s performance 
does not meet the operational or performance terms of the contract. In the case of contracts for public 
defender offices and managed assigned counsel programs, these provisions must include a review of 
utilization and activity, reporting of financial data to evaluate the contractor’s performance within the budget 
required by statute for such programs. TIDC staff must review each contract at least once every two years and 
notify the grantee if it is not sufficient (See TAC § 173.311).  

d.  Limit on Equipment for Third Party Contracting of Legal Services—Counties that contract with third 

parties to provide direct client indigent defense services may have included one-time purchase of equipment 
in the grant application. Counties may not include in the contract with the third party the full costs of the 
equipment line item into future funding years.

Attachment C 
Required Program Elements 

IDC has funded several programs in the categories listed below. In addition to general program requirements provided 
throughout the RFA, applications for these specific types of programs must include the following required elements to 
be considered for funding.  

1)  Indigent  Defense  Coordinators  (IDC)—These  are  multi-year  grant  programs.  IDCs  have  been  funded  to 
institutionalize indigent defense processes into the courts of a county or region. They are dedicated to improving 
the appointment process and providing documentation that a county is in compliance with the Fair Defense Act. 
IDCs have reduced administrative time that judges must devote to indigent defense activities. They can also enhance 
processes  for  fair,  neutral  and  non-discriminatory  appointment  practices.  A  clear  and  objective  standard  of 
indigence with a timely appeal process to the courts in case of denial by the IDC ensures success of these programs. 
IDCs are not to be confused with court administrators, secretaries, or court docket managers.  

Required Program Elements: 
a)  Must perform all appointments (in and out of court) as the designee of the judge or judges; 
b)  Must  maintain  the  rotation  default  system  on  assigned  counsel  systems  and  monitor  the  frequency  and 

reasons of exception for off list appointments; 

c)  Must report summary of appointment data to judges at least monthly; 
d)  Must  manage  the  graduated  list  of  court  appointed  attorneys  for  judges  and  receive  applications  for 

advancements or adjustments as higher qualifications are met by attorneys; 

e)  Must  monitor  appointment  list  and  attorneys’  completion  of  continuing  legal  education  (CLE)  to  meet 

minimum requirements of local plan and Commission rules;  

f)  Must  review  invoices  submitted  by  attorneys  and  compare  to  appointment  schedule  prior  to  judicial 

approval; 

plan(s) adopted by courts; 

g)  Perform training for law enforcement, magistrates, local  bar, and  other stakeholders  on  indigent  defense 

h)  Report directly to the judges (rural) or board of judges (mid-size or urban); 
i)  Develop  procedures  to  track  attorney  contact  with  client,  which  includes  tracking,  investigating,  and 

reporting allegations of attorneys not meeting their clients within statutory or plan requirements; and 

j)  Must involve all courts in the jurisdiction (rural and mid-sized) or all of the judges of a type of court (larger 

jurisdiction). 

 

2)  Videoconferencing  (VC)—TIDC  has  funded  programs  that  use  technology  to  provide  better  representation  or 
promote prompt appointment requirements. The courts can use the technology to remediate the effects of geography 
or volume on court processes. An acceptable videoconferencing system will focus on improving access to effective 
assistance  of counsel for indigent  defendants.  It may  also help  the  county meet  prompt appointment  or  prompt 
attorney contact requirements of the Fair Defense Act. TIDC may award videoconference grants to meet the three 
following objectives:  

A. Attorney/Client meetings - Promotes client contact with appointed attorneys.  
B. Magistration —Counties can use VC technology to improve the performance of magisterial duties, including 
the  duties  to  inform  the  accused  of  the  right  to  appointed  counsel  and  the  procedures  for  requesting 
appointment  of  counsel,  and  to  provide  persons  requesting  appointed  counsel  with  necessary  forms  for 
making requests and ensuring that reasonable assistance in completing required forms is provided to the 
accused at the time of the magistrate’s hearing. 

C. Indigency determinations and applications - The court may use the technology to conduct the interview to 

determine indigence or to consider requests for court appointed counsel. 
 

equired Program Elements: 

  R

a)  Must meet the needs of the public defender’s office (if applicable), managed assigned counsel program (if 
applicable), and local attorneys on the appointment list and involve the public defender’s office, managed 
assigned counsel program, and local defense bar in the planning stages; 

b)  Must be used by all judges in the jurisdiction involved in the specific aspect of the program (e.g., includes a 

countywide process change in magistration, attorney/client meetings, etc.);

  T

 

c)  Must be used to meet a specific element of the Fair Defense Act (e.g., indigence determination, magistration, 

attorney contact, etc.);  

d)  Must involve sheriff, jail administrator and other law enforcement as applicable; 
e)  Must be purchased from the State DIR contract (see program requirements); 
f)  May include the price of at least three years of maintenance; 

 

 

3)  Purchase  of  Information  Technology  Products—Many  IT  products  may  be  considered  for  funding  only  in 
relation to how they improve local indigent defense processes. Any project allowed under this type of purchase 
must clearly focus on improving indigent defendants’ access to effective assistance of counsel. These projects often 
reduce administrative time of judges and court staff involved in the appointment or payment process. 

Required Program Elements: 
a)  Must meet the needs of the public defender’s office (if applicable), managed assigned counsel program (if 
applicable), and local attorneys on the appointment list and involve the public defender’s office, managed 
assigned counsel program, and local defense bar in the planning stages; 

b)  Software programming must be portable to other jurisdictions; 
c)  The product must have clearly defined activity, summary, and management reports; and 
d)  Must avoid use for general court processes. 
e)  Any agreements entered into as part of a funded project must ensure that all data is the property of the county, 
is available and accessible to the county within a reasonable time, and subject to disclosure or withholding 
based on the county’s obligation under the laws in effect at the time. The County must review all requests 
for data, and no data may be released to a third party without County approval. 

f)  Contracts must state the format in which the data will be provided in case of termination of agreement with 

vendors. 

g)  For any grants that involve developing new software solutions with state and/or county funds, the statement 
of grant award must clearly address considerations and expectations regarding the ownership of and access 
to the source code for any programing. 

h)  Technology project funding requests must include detailed basis of cost explanations. 
i)  Technology project grant payments will be based on verifiable achievement of project phase completions. 
j)  Software developed should conform with appropriate industry information exchange standards. 

4)  Public  Defender  Offices,  Managed  Assigned  Counsel  Programs,  and  Other  Direct  Client  Services—
Establishing public defenders, managed assigned counsel programs, regional defenders, mental health defender, 
and juvenile defender services are priorities of the Commission. Direct client services are the most likely to receive 
funding.  

Required Program Elements: 
a)  Must focus on serving clients;  
b)  Must demonstrate broad-based support of the local judiciary; 
c)  Must maintain an Oversight Board that meets at least twice a year. (TIDC recommends quarterly meetings 

to facilitate stakeholder communication.)  

d)  Must involve clear appointment/referral and intake processes; 
e)  Must  include  adequate  access  to  support  services  including  administrative  support,  paralegals,  and 

investigators; 

f)  Must have defined caseload/workload standards consistent with TIDC’s published guidelines; 
g)  Must consult the local bar association, if any, in the planning stages; 
h)  Must have internal case management/tracking controls sufficient to monitor attorney caseload/workload; 
i)  Must  have  ability  to  produce  other  reports  that  enable  the  office  to  evaluate  its  own  performance  and 

demonstrate its cost-effectiveness to other local defense systems; and 

j)  Emphasis on staff training/supervision/evaluation to continually improve office performance. 

5)  Mental Health Public Defender or Managed Assigned Counsel Programs:  

Required Program Elements 

 

a)  A written plan must be developed addressing how the program will interface with and not duplicate existing 
resources (LMHAs, TDCJ Reintegration, CSCD, etc.) available to people with mental health issues; and  
b)  Must consult the local bar association, if any, in the planning stages.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
