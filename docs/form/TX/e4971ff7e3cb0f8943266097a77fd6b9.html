      <pre>Transfer on Death Deed Cancellation
Instructions

Important Notice to Property Owner
Carefully read all instructions for this form. It is best to talk to a lawyer before using this form. For privacy reasons, do not put 
your social security number or driver’s license number on this form. Do not file these instructions.

When to Use this Form

If you change your mind and decide you do not want the primary or alternate beneficiaries listed in your transfer on
death deed to own the property upon your death, use this form to cancel the transfer on death deed. See the general
instructions to the transfer on death deed for information on cancelling a transfer on death deed by filing a new trans-
fer on death deed or after a divorce.

Tearing up or destroying your copy or the beneficiary’s copy of the transfer on death deed will not cancel the deed. A
cancellation must be filed with the county clerk where the property is located before your death.

Important Information

The cancellation applies ONLY to the portion of the property you own. For example: Joe and Sue own property to-
gether. They both sign and file a transfer on death deed naming Ann as the beneficiary. Sue changes her mind and files
a cancellation of transfer on death deed but Joe doesn’t. When Joe dies, Ann will get his share of the property but not
Sue’s share.

If more than one owner wants to cancel the transfer on death deed, it is best if each owner completes a separate can-
cellation of transfer on death deed.

Cancellation of a transfer on death deed is sometimes called a “revocation” of a transfer on death deed.

Required

front of a notary public.

• Must Sign in Front of a Notary: Do not sign or date the cancellation of transfer on death deed until you are standing in

• Must Record Cancellation Form Before Your Death: You must file this cancellation of transfer on death deed form
with the county clerk where the property is located before your death. If you don’t, the property will go to the per-
son(s) listed as the primary or alternate beneficiaries in the transfer on death deed upon your death. NOTE: Tearing
up or destroying your copy or the beneficiary’s copy of the transfer on death deed will not cancel the deed.

Completing the Cancellation of Transfer on Death Deed Form
1. Property Owner (Transferor) Making this Cancellation:

The person who currently owns the property must complete this cancellation form.

If more than one person owns the property, each property owner who wants to cancel the transfer on death deed for
their share of the property should complete a cancellation of transfer on death deed form.

place.

the original and ask them to return a copy of the original with the recording information on it to the owner.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
