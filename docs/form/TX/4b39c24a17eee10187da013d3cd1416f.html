RULES OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH CERTIFICATION COMMISSION 

.2 

Requirement of Certification or Registration 

A  person  may  not  engage  in  shorthand  reporting  in  this  State  or  be  appointed  as  an 
official  court  reporter  or  deputy  court  reporter  unless  that  person  is  certified  as  a 
shorthand reporter by the Supreme Court of Texas. 

(1) 

A  certification  must  be  for  one  or  more  of  the  following  methods  of  shorthand 
reporting:  

(A)  written shorthand; 

(B)  machine shorthand;  

(C) 

oral stenography; or  

 

 

 

 

(2) 

(D) 

any other method of shorthand reporting authorized by the Supreme Court.  

A person may not assume or use the title or designation “court recorder,” “court 
reporter,” or “shorthand  reporter,” or any  abbreviation,  title, designation,  words, 
letters, sign, card, or device tending to indicate that the person is a court reporter 
or shorthand reporter, unless the person is certified as a shorthand reporter by the 
Supreme Court of Texas. Nothing in this rule must be construed to either sanction 
or  prohibit  the  use  of  electronic  court  recording  equipment  operated  by  a 
noncertified  court  reporter  pursuant  and  according  to  rules  adopted  or  approved 
by the Supreme Court of Texas.  

b) 

A court reporting firm and its affiliate offices must register with the Commission. Unless 
a firm and its affiliate offices are registered with the Commission, the firm must not:  

(1) 

use  the  title  or  designation  “court  recording  firm,”  “court  reporting  firm,”  or 
“shorthand  reporting  firm”  or  any  abbreviation,  title,  designation,  words,  letters, 
sign, card, or device tending to indicate that the firm is a court reporting firm or 
shorthand reporting firm; or

a party to the litigation involved, the party’s attorney, or a full-time employee of 
either; or  

court  reporting  services  performed  outside  of  this  State  by  a  shorthand  reporter 
who  is  not  certified  in  this  State  for  use  in  a  court  proceeding  in  this  State, 
provided that the work resulting from those services is produced and billed wholly 
outside of this State.  

d) 

Subject  to  the  requirements  of  Rule  6.4(d)  and  (e),  nothing  in  these  rules  should  be 
construed to prohibit the employment of a noncertified shorthand reporter until a certified 
shorthand  reporter  is  available  in  the  judicial  district  where  services  of  a  shorthand 
reporter are desired.  

e) 

To qualify for certification, a person must:  

(1) 

satisfy the requirements of Section 3.0 of these rules;  

(2) 

pass  an  examination  as  required  by  the  Commission  in  one  or  more  of  the 
methods of shorthand reporting authorized by Rule 6.2(a)(l); and  

(3) 

be a high school graduate or possess the GED equivalent.  

f) 

Examination procedures. 

To take an examination, an applicant for certification must file the required forms 
and  pay  the  required  fees  according  to  the  deadlines  established  by  the 
Commission.  

Prior  to  or  simultaneously  with  the  submission  of  an  applicant’s  application  to 
take  Part  A  of  the  examination,  the  applicant  must  submit  a  statement  of 
proficiency.  

(A) 

(B) 

The  statement  of  proficiency  must  be  on  the  form  provided  by  the 
Commission and must contain the certification of a court reporting school 
instructor.  

If  the  applicant  attended  and  learned  court  reporting  skills  at  a  court

(D) 

(E) 

(F) 

 

 

 

 

 

(C) 

The person making the certification required in (f)(2)(A) must certify that 
the applicant has satisfactorily passed at the rate of 95% accuracy at least 
two tests on new material of each of the following: 

(i) 

(ii) 

five minutes of two-voice dictation of questions and answers given 
at 225 words per minute;  

five minutes of dictation of  a jury charge  given  at  200 words per 
minute; and  

(iii) 

five minutes of dictation of selected literary material given at 180 
words per minute.  

The  tests  required  by  (f)(2)(C)  must  be  administered  and  graded  by  the 
person who certifies the applicant’s statement of proficiency and must be 
taken  by  the  method  of  shorthand  reporting  for  which  the  applicant  has 
applied for  examination. The two tests  must have been taken  and passed 
no more than one year apart.  

The applicant may not be deemed eligible to take an examination until the 
Commission receives the statement of proficiency.  

If  the  Commission  has  on  file  a  valid  statement  of  proficiency  for  an 
applicant,  the  applicant  is  not  required  to  file  a  new  statement  of 
proficiency. A statement of proficiency is valid for one year from the date 
of the last proficiency test described in (f)(2)(C) and must be valid on the 
date of the examination for which the applicant has applied.  

(G) 

In lieu of the statement of proficiency, an applicant who:  

(i) 

(ii) 

is  licensed  in  good  standing  in  another  jurisdiction  may  submit 
proof of licensure from the licensing authority of that jurisdiction; 
or  

is  certified  as  an  RMR,  as  an  RPR,  or  pursuant  to  a  national 
examination  that  the  Commission  determines  is  of  equivalent  or 
greater  degree  of  difficulty  than  the  RMR  or  RPR  examinations 
may submit a letter from the certifying organization.  

(H) 

The letter submitted under (f)(2)(G) must:

(ii) 

(iii)

the certification expires; and  

attest  that  the  applicant  has  passed  the  exam  for  the  certification 
and is currently certified and in good standing.  

The  national  certification  must  be  valid  on  the  date  of  the  Texas 
examination for which the applicant has applied.  

The letter submitted under (f)(2)(G) is valid until the next expiration date 
of the applicant’s national certification.  

Part  A  will  be  composed  of  five  minutes  of  two-voice  dictation  of 
questions  and  answers  given  at  225  words  per  minute,  five  minutes  of 
dictation of a jury charge given at 200 words per minute, and five minutes 
of dictation of selected literary material given at 180 words per minute.  

Each  applicant  must  personally  take  down  the  test  and  must  reduce  the 
takedown to writing.  

The minimum  passing  grade on  each section of  Part A is  95% accuracy. 
An error will be charged for:  

(i) 

each wrong word;  

(ii) 

each omitted word;  

(iii) 

each added word not dictated;  

(iv) 

each contraction where read as two words;

(viii)  each misspelled word;  

(ix) 

each plural or singular if the opposite was dictated; and  

(x) 

each wrong number.  

(D)  Applicants may use a dictionary during Part A.  

(E) 

Applicants  will  be  allowed  three  hours  to  complete  the  transcription  of 
Part  A  of  the  test.  If  time  permits,  an  applicant  may  review  his  or  her 
transcript  but  may  use  only  the  original  takedown  from  which  the 
transcript was prepared to review the transcript.  

(2) 

Part B component.  

(A) 

Part  B  of  the  test  must  consist  of  objective  questions  touching  on 
elementary  aspects  of  court  reporting,  spelling,  and  grammar  and  Texas 
rules and procedure.  

(B)  Applicants may not use a dictionary during Part B. 

(C) 

The minimum passing grade on Part B is 75%.  

(3) 

Notwithstanding  Rule  3.1l(d),  an  applicant  who  passes  Part  A  or  Part  B  of  the 
examination but fails the other part will not be required to be reexamined on the 
part that the applicant passed.  

An applicant who fails an examination may request that the examination be regraded by 
sending a written request to the Commission office within 20 days of the date of notice 
that  the  applicant  has  failed  the  examination.  If  the  examination  is  regraded,  the 
Commission will inform the applicant of the results of the regrading. Upon receipt of the 
regrading results, the applicant may request a personal review of the examination with a 
member of the advisory board. The request for a personal review must be in writing and 
filed within 20 days of the notice of regrading results.  

The  Commission  must  certify  to  the  Supreme  Court  of  Texas  the  names  of  applicants 
who have completed all application requirements and are determined on examination to 
be qualified in professional shorthand reporting. In its certification, the Commission must

the examination.  

A person certified under Chapter 52 of the Government Code prior to September l, 1983, 
may retain a general certification authorizing the person to use any method of shorthand 
reporting authorized in Rule 6.2(a)(1), provided that the person keeps the certification in 
continuous effect.  

To  register,  a  court  reporting  firm  or  affiliate  office  must  pay  all  required  fees  and 
register on a form provided by the Commission. The registration form must state whether 
any officers, directors, or managerial employees of the firm or affiliate office have been 
finally  convicted  of  a  felony  or  misdemeanor  other  than  a  minor  traffic  offense  or 
juvenile offense.  

l) 

The Commission may:  

(1) 

(2) 

refuse to certify to the Supreme Court the application of a person who was finally 
convicted of an offense that directly relates to the duties and responsibilities of a 
certified court reporter as determined using the factors listed in Rule 3.5; or  

refuse to register a court reporting firm or affiliate office if an officer, director, or 
managerial  employee  of  the  firm  or  affiliate  office  was  finally  convicted  of  a 
felony or misdemeanor that directly relates to  providing court reporting services 
as determined using the factors listed in Rule 3.5.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
