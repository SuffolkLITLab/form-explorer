REMOTE PROCEEDING TOOLKIT

I N T R O D U C T I O N

This toolkit is meant to provide courts with
considerations and guidance for adopting
policies for remote and hybrid proceedings, as
well as a menu of options for achieving
success with remote and hybrid proceedings
that are mindful of court budgets and
capacity. 

These resources and guidance come from
several sources. Some were developed by
courts in anticipation of post-pandemic
remote hearings. Others are examples of
pandemic policies that can be used post-
pandemic. Academic research, national
webinars, technical assistance work, and
conversations with courts and experts from
around the world have also informed NCSC’s
thinking in this area. Additional NCSC
resources on remote proceedings are available
here. For a quick video overview, check out
NCSC’s hybrid hearings tiny chat.

Clear policies promote fairness and
transparency for all court users.

Standardization can improve performance,
reduce costs, decrease errors, and will help
courts process cases more efficiently.

GUIDING PRINCIPLES

When developing policies for

remote proceedings, it is

important to ensure these

policies promote judicial

principles including fairness

and equality. 

Key Guiding Principles

Equal
Access

Due
Process

Transparency

Fairness

Standardization

Safety

Equal access: Does the remote

proceeding policy permit all court users

to participate equally and equitably

both remotely and in person? How does

it account for people who are not able to

use technology? People who need

interpretation for limited English

proficiency? People who need

accommodations for access?

rights  with  user  access?  How  will

technology challenges that happen mid-
hearing  be  handled  to  ensure  that
people’s rights are not violated? [i]

Transparency:  Is  the  policy  clear  and

understandable? 

Is 

it  available 

in

languages  that  are  not  English?  How

does it allow for public access?  How  is  it
communicated  to  the  public  and  which

court 
forms,  notices,  websites,  or
outreach  practices  might  need  to  be

modified? Can the policy be easily found
and understood by all court users? 

2

G U I D I N G   P R I N C I P L E S
C O N T I N U E D

Fairness: Does the policy address the needs of
all court users? Does it provide adequate
options for people to appear both remotely
and in person? 

Standardization: Does the policy ensure that
court-users will encounter the same processes
in all courts across the jurisdictions? If there
are differences in policy for particular courts or
particular cases or proceeding types, are there
clear justifications for those differences?

Safety: Does the policy safeguard against
inappropriate disclosure of personal
information? Are there provisions in place to
notify participants about live-streaming and to
guide participants about how to safeguard
personal information that might be visible if
they are appearing from home or a location in
their community? Does the policy consider
trauma-informed principles to allow parties to
fully participate?

3

This  NCSC  resource  has  more  information  about  guiding  principles
and how to incorporate them into virtual hearings. [ii] If you’d like to
see  the  principles  explained  in  the  style  of  Goodnight  Moon,  as  read
by five state supreme court justices, here you go. 

4

   

This can be a good opportunity for court communities to consider
their values and guiding principles. [iii] The body making
recommendations or decisions about remote proceeding policies
should take time to reflect on what is important in their jurisdiction
and to the court-users that they serve. The how-to information in the
Strategies section may be helpful here as you gather information
from stakeholders about guiding principles.

REMOTE PROCEEDING TOOLKIT

What is a "Remote
Proceeding?"

For purposes of this toolkit, a
remote proceeding is any
proceeding where at least one
participant appears by video
conference or telephone. This
includes proceedings where all
parties appear virtually and
proceedings where some parties
appear in-person and some
appear virtually/telephonically.

This toolkit covers some basic
concepts applicable to all types
of hearings where at least one
party appears remotely. There are
special considerations for hybrid
hearings where there are parties
appearing remotely and in-
person, including placement of
equipment and due process
considerations that NCSC is also
exploring in its Hybrid Hearings
Improvement Project in pilot
sites across the country.

Courts adopting remote
proceeding policies
should ensure that their
policies include a
definition of a remote
proceeding. 

Consider broad
definitions to allow for
flexibility.

 State Spotlight: Arizona’s
Continuity of Court Operations
Workgroup defines a remote
hearing as “any court hearing
where one or more participant
uses a technology-based
platform, such as Zoom, Teams,
WebEx, Skype, GoToMeeting,
bridgelines, conference call lines,
telephone, or similar technology
to participate in the court
hearing.”
 

Remote Proceedings Toolkit

Why Remote
Proceedings?

Allowing remote participation supports due process,
equal access, transparency, fairness, and safety. Remote
proceedings reduce barriers to appearing in court,
improve public access, and are responsive to the diverse
needs and preferences of court users.

7

Reduce Barriers to
Appearing in Court

Participants in NCSC's 2021 State
of the State Courts survey
identified the following barriers
to physically attending court:
distance to court (49%); time off
work or school (41%);
transportation (30%); disability
access (23%); childcare (22%).

8

In-person hearings can create serious barriers for court users. People must take time off
work, travel to a courthouse (navigating public transportation in some circumstances,
paying for gas and parking, driving long distances in rural jurisdictions), and finding
childcare. [iv] Additionally, in-person hearings can be difficult for some people with
disabilities, [1] and some people may feel uneasy going to a physical courthouse if they
are undocumented or have been involved in the criminal justice system. Remote
hearings can also increase participation for survivors of violence who may feel safer
appearing remotely when appropriate. [v] Allowing remote appearances can eliminate
these barriers and create better participation in court hearings.

And in fact, early data suggests that remote proceedings increase participation. Data
from the Maricopa County Justice Courts in Arizona, for example, showed a change in
failure-to-appear rates in eviction cases from about 40% to as low as 13%. [vi]

           

[1]It is important to keep in mind that the needs of people with
disabilities are highly individualized and for some people with
disabilities, in-person proceedings are more accessible. If a court
user identifies as a person with a disability, it is critical to ask the
person what they need to meaningfully participate. Accessibility
and accommodations are discussed more in various sections of this
toolkit.

Initial surveys show that court users want the
option to appear remotely

9

Most participants in the 2021 NCSC State of the State
Courts survey would consider appearing remotely for
some types of court proceedings, including jury
screening, traffic proceedings, small claims, and
consumer debt. [vii]

A 2021 study commissioned by the D.C. Bar
Foundation about the use of remote hearings in
family law cases found that most participants
reported that remote hearings eliminated challenges
with appearing for court hearings and that they
preferred remote hearings, particularly for shorter
hearings. [viii]

     

     

User
Preference

Better Public
Access

Livestreaming or remote access to court proceedings has allowed public
participation in the judicial process in a more robust way, which can bolster
public trust and confidence in the legal system. People can view court
proceedings more easily and gain a better understanding of the judicial process.
This has been particularly useful for researchers, court watchers, news
organizations, and law students. However, there are privacy considerations for
courts to keep in mind as they think through how to balance public access and
the wider access that streaming creates. These considerations are discussed in
the Public Access section of this toolkit.

10

Court Improvement
Considerations

Remote hearings can improve
court processes so long as court
leadership considers how
processes can be modified to
ensure the appropriate balance of
efficiency and procedural fairness
and develop appropriate plans.
Courts should embrace this
opportunity to process map and
evaluate current procedures and
case flows and consider what
barriers or challenges currently
exist, and how shifting to remote
hearings could allow the court to
redesign those processes for
improvement. 

Better participation will lead to
better outcomes and increased
public trust in courts. Remote
hearings can also lead to
smoother functioning of hearings.

STRATEGIES

It is critical to have clear policies for
court users to understand when
remote proceedings are possible,
and how to engage with court
proceedings remotely. In July 2022,
the Conference of Chief Judges and
Conference of State Court
Administrators adopted a resolution
encouraging states and jurisdictions
to create policies around the use of
remote proceedings. As you develop
remote hearing policies use the
following best practices to gather
information:

Several states including
Arizona, California,
Illinois, Maryland,
Michigan, and Utah
created task forces to
address the continued
use of remote hearings
post-pandemic.
 

Gather feedback from stakeholders. Include a

variety of groups, such as judges, court staff,

lawyers - private bar, legal services and public

defenders, self-represented litigants, parties in

criminal cases, justice partners, the disability

community, and community organizations such

as victim’s rights organizations and other

community leaders. Court user feedback is

critical here. 

Use a variety of methods to collect feedback.

Use paper and electronic surveys, focus groups,

interviews, and stakeholder-based bodies such

as task forces to obtain information. Make sure

written materials can be read and understood by

a wide audience and are translated into

languages that are prevalent in your community.

Don’t make blanket assumptions about

particular case types (e.g. all criminal hearings

must be in person or all evidentiary hearings

must be in-person). Rather use the guiding

principles outlined above, additional principles

important to your court community, and the

realities of your community to create your own

policies.

Identify challenges and successes. What does

your state do well? What is a challenge? How

might challenges be addressed? Identify ways to

collect information from courts in your states

about experiences with remote proceedings to

assist with statewide policies. 
 

13

Task-Force How-To

The following sections contain tools for
convening a task force to make
recommendations on remote proceedings.

14

     

Key Questions:
Who is responsible for convening the task force?

What should the task force do? Obtain
stakeholder feedback? Make
recommendations?

What is the timeline for recommendations?

Who should participate in the task force in your
community? Ensure diverse representation
from court users, court staff, judges, justice
partners, and attorneys. Consider “non-
traditional” partners, like social service providers
whose clients use the courts, as well as
researchers and academics who may study the
courts, in order to understand the experiences
and needs of court-users that may not have
been previously taken into account.

A task force may be
helpful to ensure input
from a variety of
stakeholders,
thoughtful
consideration of process
changes that may need
to happen, and
opportunities for user
testing.

Task Force
Participation/Input
Checklist

You can use the following checklist to identify task force
participants. The level of participation of members may vary
but try to seek input from the following groups: 

☐    Judges from a variety of court types (criminal, civil, juvenile,
family, small, medium, large)

☐    Court administrators from a variety of court types (criminal, civil,
juvenile, family, small, medium, large)

Topic 1

☐    Courtroom staff, including bailiffs and court reporters

☐    Court self-help staff and court clerks

☐    Civil attorneys including private practitioners and attorneys who
work for civil legal service organizations

Selecting the
Technology Platform

Use this time to reassess the technology you are already using and determine if
a change is needed. Technology is a tool but not a fix-all. Make sure to think
about your guiding principles as you consider how to incorporate technology
into court processes and hearings. And remember, language access and
disability accommodation considerations should be part of the remote hearing
policy and should be factored into technology decisions. To help in this process,
NCSC created an interactive online tool (as well as a pdf and physical booklet)
that will help you think through considerations and allow you to incorporate
guiding principles. You can access the tool here: www.ncsc.org/exitingtech. 

18

Key Questions
About Technology
Platforms

The following checklists outline some key questions to ask
about technology platforms and court use of platforms:

☐ Do court staff find it easy to use?

☐ Are court users able to connect easily with the platform?

☐ If this is a new platform, has it been tested by court staff and users?

Topic 1

☐ Will the platform allow for simultaneous interpretation?

☐ Does the platform allow for captioning and other accessibility
requirements? [x]

☐ Does the platform allow for the hearing to be recorded? Can these
hearings be used to establish a court record? 

☐ Does the platform allow for viewing and exchanging documents? 

☐ What is the cost of the platform?

☐ Will there be a cost to court-users? If yes, use another platform to ensure
access and avoid due process concerns.

☐ If changing platforms, what steps do you need to take to ensure
continuity of services? (See the next section about contracting for digital
services for more information.)

Additional
considerations

Key Questions For
Contracting Digital
[xii]
Services 

☐ Have you considered data ownership? 

Who owns any data created by use of the platform? How does this
intersect with privacy laws and public record laws in your
jurisdictions? What steps will your court need to take to ensure that
data is protected? How will data errors that impact court users be
handled?

Topic 1

☐ Will your court and court users be able to adapt and modify the
technology in any way to meet the needs of the court? 

☐ Who is responsible for providing platform support? If court users
must go to the platform company for technical support, what does
this look like?

☐ How will updates to the platform be handled? Will you need to
purchase new licenses in the future?

☐ What happens if the platform is no longer supported (i.e. if the
technology company decides to retire the platform)? Do you have a
plan to transfer platforms?

21

Court Broadband Considerations: Some

courthouses are located in areas where

broadband is either not available or not

reliable and this may impact a court’s ability

to realistically conduct remote hearings.

(This Arizona report has good information

about court technology infrastructure.)

Courts should consider their own

technology capacity in creating policies

about remote hearings. However,

courthouses in these locations are likely to

be in rural areas where people may

experience transportation barriers and must

travel long distances to courthouses so

remote hearings may be particularly

important in these communities. Courts in

these areas should consider grants or

funding to modernize court technology if

appropriate.

Hybrid Proceedings: If a proceeding is a

hybrid proceeding (some parties are

appearing in person and others are

appearing remotely), do courtrooms need

additional equipment to ensure that all

participants can hear and see each other

and that a clear record can be captured?

Check out this short video to learn more. 

Virtual Courtroom Structure: This NCSC

resource contains examples of how

courtrooms in Vermont and Illinois have

structured their courtroom equipment. [xii]

22

   

ADDRESSING
BARRIERS

The following sections address
some common technology
barriers (often referred to as
the “digital divide”) and
strategies to help with these
barriers.
 

State Spotlight:
Illinois’ First Judicial District and
the Administrative Office of the
Illinois Courts received a
Technology Modernization Grant
that they used to rewire
courthouses and purchase
equipment for remote hearings
in rural Illinois counties. 
 

State
Spotlight

Minnesota Legal Services has placed 270
kiosks in community locations
throughout the state which can be used
to access remote hearings. 

Travis County, Texas provided iPads and
hotspots to jurors for virtual jury trials.

D.C. has a number of remote hearing
sites in community locations.

Maryland has partnered with public
libraries to loan equipment and hotspots
to court users.

Hawaii has created a Wi-Fi map so users
can identify Wi-Fi locations. The
Minnesota-based Land O’Lakes, Inc. also
has a Wi-Fi map.

23

The Challenge: Although one study indicated
that 85% of Americans own a smartphone and
97% own a cell phone and at least three-
quarters of Americans own a computer or
tablet of some sort, [xiv] the reality is that
owning a device does not mean that a court
user is well equipped to access a remote
proceeding. Their devices may not have good
cameras or microphones. (Data and
broadband access are also discussed in the
next section.)

     

Strategies: 

Provide kiosks in courthouses and/or other
community locations where people can go to
access hearings remotely. Ensure that these
kiosks are located in private spaces, particularly
kiosks hosted by community partners. Learn
more about kiosks in this short video.

 

Identify community points for access and
provide this information with hearing notices
about schools, libraries, McDonalds, Starbucks,
or other local businesses that offer free Wi-Fi.

Consider whether users can “check-out”
equipment from the court [xv] or public library.
[xvi]

Ensure phone participation is always an option.

Court Users:
Equipment Barriers

Court Users: Broadband/Data
Access Issues

The Challenge: At least 21 million Americans do not have broadband access [xvii] and
others may have infrequent access to the internet due to resource challenges such as
pre-paid phone or data plans that are not always active or inconsistent access to devices.
Although surveys suggest that a high percentage of Americans have a smartphone or
access to a smartphone, it is important to remember that not all smartphone owners
have consistent coverage. Some have plans with limited data and others may not always
have service. 

Strategies: 

·      Kiosks are also an option for these users.

24

     

·      Identify community points for access and provide this information with hearing
notices about schools, libraries, McDonalds, Starbucks, or other local businesses that
offer free Wi-Fi.

·      Ensure phone participation is always an option.

·      Consider whether there is a role for your court/jurisdiction in advocating for
increased broadband access in your community. For example, Michigan’s Task Force
recommends that their state court administrator, judges’ associations, and the State Bar
of Michigan “coordinate a plan to advocate for the adoption of legislative appropriations
to modernize the state’s broadband and technology infrastructure.” [xviii]

Court Users: Technology
Knowledge Issues

The challenge: Some court participants may not feel comfortable using
technology. These participants include parties, attorneys, and court staff.
This is a place where user testing and feedback can be important, both in
identifying barriers and developing strategies and resources for users who
do not feel as comfortable with technology. 

Strategies:

 

Ensure  there  are  clear  instructions  (ideally  available  in  several  formats  and  languages,
including written and video) provided to court users about how to log on, the technology
platform, whom to contact if a user is having problems, and expectations about the wait
time and the hearing. Sample instructions from various states are available in this toolkit
here.

Provide  dedicated  technology  training  to  court  staff  and  judges,  including  training  on
how to enable interpretation, captioning, and other accessibility tools.

Ensure phone participation is always an option.

Build  a  “tech  check”  into  the  hearing  process.  This  may  include  asking  users  to  log  on
early to test equipment and designating a staff person to ensure that users' technology is
working  correctly.  Consider  having  court  staff  contact  litigants  days  in  advance  of  the
hearing  to  run  tests  on  equipment  and  a  user’s  comfort  using  the  system—which  can
pay dividends for a user’s experience during the hearing and increase court appearance
rates.

Some  courts  have  identified  court-based  helpers  who  can  assist  both  users  and  court
staff with technology. Courts should consider whether to request staff or train volunteers
for this role.

25

   

Technology Knowledge
Issues Continued

User testing of technology before deciding on a particular technology can
help identify technologies that may be easier for users. Ensure user testing
includes limited English proficient users and users with disabilities.

Even court users who are more familiar with technology will benefit from
clear information about how to access technology for a hearing and how to
ensure quality internet connections. Examples of resources for technology
instructions and what-to-expect documents are included in this toolkit.

State
Spotlights:

Vermont has court staff who act as
“tech bailiffs” to address technology
problems during hearings, ensure
that technology is working for court
users, and help court staff
troubleshoot technology questions
from court users.

Michigan’s Committee
recommended that court staff be
trained annually on technology use.

26

Flexibility & Resources

In-person should always be an option. Some users will
prefer to be in person, and for some people with disabilities,
it will be necessary for them to participate in person.

 

Technology
Resources

These NCSC
resources have
information about
considerations
when selecting
technology and
technology needs. 
 

27

Be ready to grant continuances if the party or participant experiences a
technology problem. 

     

Do not sanction parties for non-appearance until ensuring that their
failure to appear was not the result of a technology failure. 

Flexibility:

Flexibility is essential to ensure due process and equal
access. Some examples of flexibility include:

If a certain hearing type is presumptively remote or
in person, create a clear process for parties to
request a change. Parties should be able to request
a change without having to travel to court and
appear before a judge. Consider allowing these
requests to be made via email, phone, or a web-
based form. 

Allow telephonic appearance for users who want to
appear remotely and are not able to use video.

REMOTE PROCEEDING TOOLKIT

Introduction:

This section provides guidance and examples about identifying
the types of proceedings that may be more appropriate for
remote participation or for in-person participation. Several
jurisdictions have issued guidance about the types that are
presumptively in-person or presumptively remote.

Identifying Benchmarks:

Some suggested benchmarks are on the pages that follow with
examples of courts that have adopted policies based on these
benchmarks, but there may be others relevant to your jurisdiction. 

 

 

29

Length of Proceeding

States that have considered post-pandemic remote
proceedings have made some shorter proceedings
presumptively remote. [xix]

 

Examples:

Scheduling conferences

Status hearings

Arraignments and pleas agreements (particularly where
incarceration is not anticipated)

Non-evidentiary motion hearings

30

     

Long periods of time on videoconferencing software can lead to exhaustion,
irritability, and difficulty with decision-making. [xx] Tips for holding longer
proceedings remotely are also addressed in Modules 5 and 7 (Tips for
Remote Hearings and Cautions).

Evidence

Will Evidence Be Presented?

If not, the proceeding may be appropriate for remote appearance. Arizona recommends
that many non-evidentiary proceedings be presumptively remote.

However, not all evidentiary proceedings need to take place in-person. The following
sections break out some considerations about evidence when making decisions about
how to hold evidentiary proceedings. 

What Type of Evidence Will Be Presented?

Can the evidence be adequately and fairly considered in a remote setting? Physical
evidence will be harder to accommodate in remote hearings than documents or
photographs. 

Connecticut has a remote presumption for bench trials in cases where there are no
interpreters and that do not have numerous exhibits. [xxi]

31

Virtual Or In-Person

The following states have created guidance or recommendations
about post-pandemic remote hearings:

Click on a state to see their guidance or
recommendations

Arizona: Hearings involving witness
testimony, jury selection, and trials, as well
as bench trials are in-person. Other
proceedings may take place remotely.

Minnesota: Presumption that most non-
evidentiary civil hearings are remote.

Maryland: Criminal and civil trials are
presumed to be in-person. A number of
criminal hearings including arraignments
and plea agreements where incarceration is
not anticipated are presumed to be remote.
Many civil non-jury evidentiary proceedings
are also presumptively remote as are order
of protection hearings.

Michigan: Presumption that certain types of
civil proceedings including pre-trial hearings
and motions, as well as certain limited criminal
proceedings, including arraignments are
remote. Trials and evidentiary proceedings are
presumed to be in-person but could be remote
if there is agreement by all parties and the
court. 

32

Witness Testimony

Equal Access Considerations: 

Remote hearings may allow for increased use of experts by parties who previously
could not afford the cost of bringing an expert in person.

Remote testimony may allow some witnesses to feel safer and more able to testify. 

Witness Credibility Determinations: 

Some stakeholders have expressed concerns about determining witness credibility if the
witness is appearing by phone or video. Whether to allow remote witness testimony may
be a determination best made on a case-by-case basis instead of creating a presumption.

Should you Allow Remote Witness Testimony?

Weigh the potential costs and benefits of allowing remote witness testimony,
including due process and fairness concerns.

Remember that decisions about remote proceedings and testimony can be made on
a case-by-case basis. Create a clear process to request remote or in-person
proceedings.

Criminal cases will require different considerations than civil cases. Think carefully
about confrontation clause concerns in criminal proceedings. This NCSC resource
gives a more detailed analysis of remote proceedings and the confrontation cause
and there is a section of this toolkit specifically addressing confrontation clause
concerns.

33

OTHER EVIDENCE
CONSIDERATION

Key Questions:

Strategies:

Be flexible about evidence and remote

hearings. 

Create clear instructions to parties

about evidence sharing and evidence

procedure in remote hearings.

Minnesota Evidence Procedure

Massachusetts Land Court Sample
Zoom Pretrial Order

Samples

   

How will proposed evidence be
shared with all parties prior to
the hearing?

How will evidence be shared
with other parties during the
hearing if there is some reason it
cannot be shared ahead of time?
 

Minnesota: Has created an
Exhibit Process Overview and
Digital Exhibit Management
System evidence to help parties
submit exhibits to the court and
other parties. 
 

34

State Spotlight:
 
Arizona: Is creating a digital
evidence portal where parties
can upload and view exhibits.
This portal is live in some Arizona
counties and will expand
statewide. 

   

Proceedings that impact significant rights or liberty
interests might be better suited to an in-person
format.

 

Examples:

Criminal jury trials

Sentencing hearings

Termination of parental rights

Adult guardianship/conservatorship proceedings

35

     

Confrontation Clause: Where the Confrontation Clause is at issue, some states
have created guidance to help courts determine whether in-person hearings and
testimony are needed. Most courts see criminal trials as proceedings that must be
in person.

Effective Assistance of Counsel: Without the ability to communicate in real-time,
attorney-client representation in criminal cases may be seriously compromised. If
remote criminal proceedings are part of your jurisdiction’s recommendations,
make sure to address communication. 

Due Process Concerns Generally: Constitutional concerns do not only arise in
criminal cases. [xxii] Be mindful of general due process considerations and
whether a party can meaningfully participate in any remote hearing. For example,
Michigan’s court rule on remote proceedings requires courts to consider whether
the use of videoconferencing technology will undermine the integrity, fairness, or
effectiveness of the proceeding.

Rights & The Constitution

Convenience & Party
Specific Considerations

Build in the room to consider participant convenience and technology
comfort and party-specific considerations in decisions about whether to
allow proceedings to occur remotely. This means allowing room for
flexibility and case-by-case decision-making. However, be careful that this
does not lead to bias in decision-making (e.g. assumptions that participants
in particular demographic groups are not comfortable with technology or
will not be able to maintain court decorum when participating remotely). 

Sample:

 

Michigan’s recent court rule on when to permit remote proceedings requires
courts to consider among other things:

Court and party capabilities to participate in a videoconference.

Convenience to parties and the potential to increase access to courts by allowing
parties and/or their counsel to appear by videoconferencing technology.

If there is reason to believe that the participants will not be able to maintain the
dignity, solemnity, and decorum of court while using videoconferencing technology.
 

36

Jury
Trials

Most states that have developed guidance
about remote/in-person proceedings place
jury trials in the in-person category.
However, there may be some parts of jury
selection that can be handled virtually.
Remote jury selection can result in better
juror participation, a more diverse jury pool,
and court savings if jurors do not have to
physically come to the courthouse. Jury
selection is currently happening remotely in
some Texas courts; in civil trials in New
Jersey; in Duval County, Florida; in Mohave
County, Arizona; and some counties in
California. The King County Superior Court in
Washington surveyed prospective jurors
who appeared for voir dire remotely and
found the majority appreciated being able to
participate remotely and would like a
remote option to remain in place. 

37

This is a good opportunity to think about other
court services and programs that might
benefit from a remote component. Self-help
services and some probation services and
check-ins are good examples of court-based
programs that can benefit from continued
remote components.

Litigants who are appearing remotely may not
have the same opportunities to learn about or
access on-site services including self-help
centers and court-based legal help desks.
Information about these services should be
shared widely to ensure litigants are still able
to access the same supports and services they
would be able to in person. If services are
available remotely, consider when and how
referrals can be made to a service provider. 

Collect user and participant feedback about
court services and programs to understand
how remote options can help people accessing
these services and programs.

Both Maryland [xxiii] and Illinois [xxiv] provide
remote self-help services.

Tools for Determining
Proceeding Format 

The following worksheets may help you as you think through
remote proceeding policies in your jurisdiction:

Proceeding Type Worksheet
List proceeding types that happen in your jurisdiction:

What proceeding types might be appropriate for remote proceedings? Should they
be remote by default? Remote if a party requests remote appearance? 

Topic 1

Has your jurisdiction (not necessarily the court itself) had any analysis done about the
digital divide in your community? Are there existing community resources to bridge
the digital divide that you could share with court users? 

Are there proceedings that should never be remote? Remote only in extraordinary
circumstances?

What factors are important to you in considering whether to hold proceedings
remotely or in-person?

Scheduling:

Reduce or eliminate the use of trailing dockets. Schedule
each proceeding for a specific time even if using the same
remote meeting link. This will eliminate confusion for court
users who may be waiting in virtual waiting rooms, allow
participants to plan if they need to use public equipment or
have limited minutes or data, and will reduce frustration for
court staff and users.

If using trailing dockets, consider asking participants who
are using kiosks or other public access points to identify this
in their username and prioritize these cases if possible since
the use of kiosks and other public computers/devices may
be time-limited. 

 

42

Instructions to Court-
Users

Ensure that instructions are available in multiple
languages and that there are picture instructions for
court users who do not read. 

 

Proceedings will run more smoothly, and court-users will feel more
confident in the court process if they have good information about
what to expect. User-testing any instruction and informational
materials and asking for feedback from court users is important to
make sure that participants understand instructions, materials, and
the technology itself.

The following pages have tips about
what information to include and how
to reach court users:

43

44

How to Connect:

Provide detailed instructions with

pictures to users with notices. This

should include information about

how to connect to the video

platform, and how to access

interpretation channels on the

platform. Make sure that there are

instructions for phone users as well,

including instructions about how to

access interpretation. Also, give

participants information about how

to get help before the proceeding if

they have questions about

technology, interpretation, or

accommodations. 

Colorado instruction documents

Maryland “toolkit” 

 

Samples:

   

 

COURT EXPECTATIONS
& NORMS

Give users information about
what to expect during the
proceeding and court
expectations about appearance
and behavior. 

Provide information about
privacy and safety considerations
including the use of virtual
backgrounds. Emphasize that
these are still public proceedings
even if a person is appearing from
their home. 

State Samples:
 

·      Minnesota

     

·      Alaska 

Virtual Waiting
Rooms

Manage remote participants:

Ensure parties and witnesses enter
the correct hearing at the correct
time.

Direct attorneys and clients into
breakout rooms for pre-hearing
discussion if necessary.

Provide information to participants
about the hearing schedule and when
they can expect to be admitted:

Waiting in a virtual waiting room is
disorienting and frustrating to many
users. Giving information and
updates about when they can
expect to be admitted is important
to reduce frustration and help court
processes run more smoothly.

Consider customizing waiting
screens and other “virtual real
estate” to display helpful links and
resources, phone numbers to call for
help, and information about what to
expect in the hearing. 

Provide information to participants
about court expectations and
resources

Display links or videos about hearing
norms and court expectations for
users appearing remotely.

Provide information about specific
resources. For example, in eviction
cases, provide information about
rental assistance programs. Use QR
codes and links that will allow
participants to connect to rental
assistance applications.

45

   

We often hear about the need for trauma-informed practices in
particular case types (child welfare or juvenile justice hearings) [xxvi],
but the reality is that for many litigants any court proceeding can
trigger trauma or involve traumatic experiences. The following
recommendations can be applied in any case type to ensure people
are able to meaningfully participate and that the court receives
better information from participants:

Give clear instructions to participants in multiple formats (e.g. verbal,
written, and at various points in the proceeding) and in multiple
languages

When appropriate, give participants choices about how to appear (e.g.
by video, with video off, telephonically, in person)

46

   

More information about trauma-informed practices is available in this
NCSC report.

Trauma Informed
Practices

Proceedings Conduct

There are some steps that judges can take at the beginning
of remote proceedings to ensure that parties understand the
expectations and how the proceeding will run. This is
particularly important if parties are appearing by phone and
do not have visual cues. Collect user feedback regularly about
the process for remote proceedings to identify barriers,
points of confusion, and ways to make proceedings run
smoothly. 

47

Virtual Platform
Basics

Give participants some virtual platform basics at the
beginning of the hearing:

Share an image of the platform controls (mute button, raise hand) indicated.
For example: 

Please mute your audio unless speaking:

Not Muted

Muted

Remind participants to mute. Provide verbal instructions to telephone
participants about how to mute if there are particular controls (e.g. * 6) that
they need to use.

Let participants know how they should let the court know they would like to
be heard. This may be raising virtual hands, using a chat feature, or other
instructions for telephone participants.

Explain how to change participants' display names and remind participants of
any naming conventions (e.g. "NAME, Plaintiff").

Give participants instructions about how to access interpretation and
captioning if necessary.

 

48

Set Hearing Norms
& Give a Roadmap:

Emphasize that this is still a court proceeding
and there are expectations for behavior and
decorum.
Explain how the court proceeding will be
structured and the order of presentations (e.g.
we will hear opening statements from the
plaintiff first and then from the defendant).
Consider developing scripts for judges in your
jurisdiction to use if they would like. 

Capturing the Record:

 

Getting a clear record has been a challenge for courts during remote
proceedings. Make sure you have a plan for how to capture the
record and test it with both in-person and remote participants.

 

49

Key Questions:

PUBLIC ACCESS

How will your court provide public

access? 

How will information be provided to

the public about access? 

How will access be managed so that

public access does not become

disruptive to the proceeding? Many
courts have addressed this through
the use of livestreaming via YouTube

or other platforms and disabling
comments on the stream.

What privacy concerns might

livestreaming raise for litigants and
how can courts be mindful of this?

For example, some courts have
created viewing rooms where they

stream hearings but do not stream to
the internet.

Does your jurisdiction have media
rules protecting images of parties

(e.g. juveniles, victims)? Do these
rules apply to streaming

proceedings? Should similar rules be
created for streaming? Will this
violate laws about public access?

50

Transparency is a key value for
courts and remote hearings have
allowed the public to participate
in the judicial process in ways
that were not possible before.
However, widespread public
access through live streaming or
other virtual access has new
privacy implications as
information about court
proceedings can be viewed
widely and even captured and
reproduced on the internet.

Consider a streaming delay so
that confidential proceedings or
portions of proceedings are not
inadvertently shared.
· Some courts have created
public access viewing rooms in
the courthouse, where
participants can go to view the
livestream of court proceedings.

REMOTE PROCEEDING TOOLKIT

Virtual hearings are new territory. Policies regarding
remote hearings should not stay static, as there are
frequent changes to technologies and practices based on
experience. Policies should be reassessed periodically but
at least once a year using information collected from courts
and users.

 

Create a Calendar

Build a review process for
any remote hearing
policies. 

·How often will the review
happen? Every six
months? Every year?

·Who is responsible for
initiating the review? Who
will participate?

   

53

Identify What Data You Need:

What information will you need to tell if your remote
hearing policies are successful? When identifying
information, keep in mind the guiding principles
you identified initially.

How will this information be collected? Will case
management software need to be updated to
collect it? What about court operating procedures?

Make feedback from court users an integral part
of the review process.

Refer to the feedback tools discussed in Module 2 of this toolkit.

Safety & Privacy 

Remote Considerations

REMOTE PROCEEDING TOOLKIT

SAFETY & PRIVACY

Virtual proceedings allow broader
access to court proceedings by
the public. While this has positive
repercussions when it comes to
court transparency and fairness, it
also has safety and privacy risks.

Proceedings dealing with
personal and sensitive
information are now potentially
available to a wider audience of
people. [xxvii] With in-person
proceedings, court observers
would need to be in the
geographic location of the
courthouse and physically travel
to the courthouse. With virtual
hearings, this is not the case.
Some examples of case types that
could expose harmful or
embarrassing information
include family law cases, eviction
hearings, and criminal cases.
[xxviii]

Effective Assistance of

Counsel:

Are there additional requirements for

attorneys appearing remotely

necessary to ensure effective

representation? (i.e., attorneys must

appear by video not telephonically)

Provide opportunities for attorneys
and clients to consult using breakout

rooms before and after hearings or
during hearing recesses as well as

ample time during proceedings,
particularly criminal proceedings for
attorney-client communications. 

Are there rule or process changes

needed in your jurisdiction to make
sure that attorney representation is

not compromised by remote
hearings?

Remote
proceedings
should not impede
attorney
representation.

56

Final Remote
Considerartions

Zoom Fatigue:
Spending long periods of time on videoconferencing platforms is psychologically
challenging for people and can lead to exhaustion and difficulty with decision-
making, colloquially called “Zoom fatigue.” [xxix]

If long proceedings are being conducted remotely, ensure breaks are built in. This
can be as simple as a twenty-second break every twenty minutes where remote
participants are encouraged to look at objects twenty feet away from their screen.
[xxix]

Remote Hearings Are Still New:

We do not yet have a lot of data about remote proceedings. This means we don’t
know if there are unintended harms to litigants or promising practices that we
haven’t yet identified. It is critical to reassess and collect data, including user
feedback and user testing involving all stakeholders, and be willing to learn and
stay flexible.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
