Both the legal and the administrative sides of the Court’s docket have experienced significant and unusual demands in 2022 due to the lingering and changing landscape of the Covid-19 state of disaster and the Operation Lone Star state of disaster. The Court consists of one chief justice and eight justices, two judicial commissions (the Children’s Commission and the Judicial Commission on Mental Health), and approximately 87 staff members. The Court has statewide, final appellate jurisdiction in most civil and juvenile cases, a robust and time sensitive mandamus and emergency motions docket, as well as full rulemaking power in civil actions.The Court has an extensive docket comprised of questions such as business disputes, election contests, governmental immunity, statutory interpretation, real estate, insurance, workers’ compensation, natural resources, family law, and a variety of other civil cases. The Supreme Court also writes rules related to civil procedure and evidence, oversees the Texas Access to Justice Commission and the Texas Access to Justice Foundation, supervises the State Bar of Texas and the Board of Law Examiners, and generally provides for the efficient and fair administration of justice for the State of Texas. The Court is aided in all of its duties by outstanding support staff – permanent specialized attorneys who assist with legal research, writing, and court administration; a Clerk of the Court and his deputies, who receive and process electronic filings and interface with the public; law clerks who work for one-year terms to assist the Court with its caseload; executive assistants and administrative personnel; and personnel devoted to two judicial commissions: the Permanent Judicial Commission on Children, Youth and Families and the Texas Judicial Commission on Mental Health. More than 85% of the Court’s operating budget is devoted to salaries for these employees.  The Legislature has understood the Court’s role in our governmental structure in prior Sessions by giving the Court authority to manage limited resources, including exemptions for certain limitations in the General Appropriations Act and authority to carry over unexpended balances between years in the biennium. The Court requests continued authority to utilize these features. Accordingly, the Court requests the following exceptional items:Exceptional Item 1.  Judiciary-Wide Inflation Relief and Staff Retention and Recruitment in Strategy A.1.1 – Appellate Court Operations ($467,694 per year) and in Strategy B.1.4 Judicial Commission on Mental health ($65,330 per year)The staff positions within the Article IV Courts and Agencies require a unique level of skill. From attorneys, to clerks and interpreters, to researchers and IT professionals, the expertise needed to keep the third branch of government running is vast. Recruiting and retaining qualified staff is challenging, even more so with inflation at 9.1 percent and rising. In FY 2021, the Judiciary had the third highest turnover rate in the state by General Appropriations Act Article at 14.5 percent. Salaries within the judiciary are not keeping up with inflation and are not competitive with other agencies or the private sector. Over the past year, Article IV Courts and Agencies have noticed a concerning trend of positions remaining open for lengthy periods of time and a steep decline in qualified applicants. Some entities have resorted to paying for recruiting tools to get a small pool of qualified candidates. Salary compression is also a major issue, where out of necessity, positions are posted at higher salaries than what current employees are making. The Article IV Courts and Agencies collectively request a 10 percent salary increase for staff to maintain and recruit a strong and experienced judicial workforce.  Exceptional Item 2.  Funding for Basic Civil Legal Services in Strategy B.1.1.  ($5,000,000 per year)The Court requests an additional $10 million in funding for Basic Civil Legal Services for the biennium.  The appropriation would fund two priorities: increased need for  Page 1 of 3Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)8/5/2022 12:56:34PM201 Supreme Court of Texas88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's Statementlegal services and increased access to the courts resulting from the pandemic. Families are struggling and spending considerably more to meet basic needs like food and shelter. Some families with children and young people face new impediments. For many young people, the isolation during the pandemic exacerbated what were already serious issues.  Civil Legal Aid provides services to young people in the child welfare system and those experiencing mental and physical health challenges in the schools and communities. Legal services interventions produce successful and healthy outcomes for those individuals, their families, their communities, and the institutions that help them.The pandemic also created changes in the access to justice delivery and court systems. Many courts and litigants use remote technology for court proceedings, increasing court efficiency and appearance rates. Many low-income people face challenges in attending in-person hearings, such as childcare, work-related issues, distance and travel time, and cost of travel. Civil Legal Aid can help low-income Texans facing technological barriers by providing approximately 250 supported kiosks in communities throughout the state to assist with appearances in remote court proceedings. Through such kiosks, Civil Legal Aid would assist with using the technology, including instruction in basic videoconference protocols and other issues such as introducing evidence in a virtual hearing. Exceptional Item 3.  Inflation Relief for Supreme Court Operating Expenses in Strategy A.1.1 ($150,000 per year)Operating expenses for consumable supplies, utilities, equipment rental, and subscription services have increased due to inflation.  In order to maintain current operating levels, an increase of $150,000 per year is needed to meet these increased costs, such as copy machine and scanner rentals, equipment services agreements, subscriptions to online periodicals and legal research services (Westlaw, Lexis, Texas Lawyer, Law360, Law.com, etc.), and consumable office and cleaning supplies.    Exceptional Item 4.  Dedicated Children’s Mental Health Funding in Strategy B.1.4 Judicial Commission on Mental Health ($250,000 per year)Due to increased demand for children’s mental health services, the Judicial Commission on Mental Health and the Children’s Commission are expanding their programming for judges and court stakeholders. This funding would add Youth Systems Sequential Intercept Model Mappings, an Annual Youth Judicial Summit on Mental Health, educational videos, roundtables, and workshops that promote: (i) collaboration for more efficient processes; (ii) education on topics such as juvenile mental health courts, juvenile justice, children without placement, and children in crisis; and (iii) support for the judiciary in identifying local mental health supports in their communities through projects such as the Innovations Map—a county-specific map serving as a one-stop-shop for local and statewide resources for courts and communities.  This exceptional item would provide the judiciary with specialized training, tools, and resources in children’s mental health to better administer justice for Texas children, youth, and families.Exceptional Item 5.  Supreme Court Justice Tenure-Based Compensation in Strategy A.1.2 ($40,042 per year)Due to new membership on the Court and increasing judicial tenure, additional funds are needed in 2024-2025 to comply with Texas Government Code Section 659.012’s tiered, tenure-based compensation structure for judicial salaries. Page 2 of 3Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)8/5/2022 12:56:34PM201 Supreme Court of Texas88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's StatementUB AUTHORITYThe Supreme Court requests that all unobligated and unexpended general revenue balances remaining from funds appropriated to the Supreme Court in Strategy A.1.1 (Appellate Court Operations), Strategy B.1.1 (Basic Civil Legal Services including Sexual Assault Program GR Dedicated Fund 5010), and Strategy B.1.4 (Judicial Commission on Mental Health) as of August 31, 2024 are appropriated to the Supreme Court for the fiscal year beginning September 1, 2024 for the same purposes. OTHER JUDICIAL BRANCH BUDGET MATTERSIn addition to the exceptional items listed above, the Supreme Court supports the following items that are included in other agencies’ budget requests:  JUDICIAL COMPENSATION COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION – COMPTROLLER JUDICIARY SECTIONThe Supreme Court supports the Judicial Compensation Commission’s recommendation for the 2024-2025 biennium.  It includes an 11% increase for 2024, then another 11% increase of the adjusted 2024 salary rate for each level based on the tier level they fall within.  Qualified, careful, committed, and trustworthy Texas judges can only be recruited and retained if their salaries are adjusted and increased appropriately over time.  Now is that time.  NATIONAL CENTER FOR STATE COURTS – COMPTROLLER JUDICIARY SECTIONThe appropriation for the National Center for State Courts dues is carried in the Comptroller Judiciary Section’s budget, and the Supreme Court supports the request to fund the dues at 100% for the upcoming biennium.  OFFICE OF COURT ADMINISTRATIONFor the Supreme Court and the Third Branch to function efficiently and accurately, it is vital that the Office of Court Administration (OCA) be adequately funded. The Supreme Court and the judicial branch utilize many technological, data, interpreting, security, and other administrative services consolidated through the OCA. The Supreme Court fully supports OCA’s exceptional item requests, and, in addition to the judiciary-wide inflation relief item requested above, draws special attention to the following requests: Replacing the Legacy Appellate Case Management System; Replacing the Legacy Case Level Data System; Information Technology Licensing; and Court Services Staff for Specialty Courts and Court Security Specialists.  STATE LAW LIBRARYThe Court wishes to express support for the State Law Library’s Legislative Appropriations Request. The Supreme Court and other courts rely significantly on the resources in the State Law Library to conduct legal research on pending matters, and the Library’s resources also serve the public at large and increase access to justice for poor and modest means Texans, who need access to free legal information and resources.

From attorneys, to clerks and interpreters, to researchers and IT professionals, the expertise needed to keep the third branch of government running is vast. Recruiting and retaining qualified staff is challenging, even more so with inflation at 9.1 percent and rising. In FY 2021, the Judiciary had the third highest turnover rate in the state by General Appropriations Act Article at 14.5 percent. Salaries within the judiciary are not keeping up with inflation and are not competitive with other agencies or the private sector. Over the past year, Article IV Courts and Agencies have noticed a concerning trend of positions remaining open for lengthy periods of time and a steep decline in qualified applicants. Some entities have resorted to paying for recruiting tools to get a small pool of qualified candidates. Salary compression is also a major issue, where out of necessity, positions are posted at higher salaries than what current employees are making. The Article IV Courts and Agencies collectively request a 10 percent salary increase for staff to maintain and recruit a strong and experienced judicial workforce.EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS:Salaries within the judiciary are not keeping up with inflation and are not competitive with other agencies or the private sector.

The appropriation would fund two priorities: increased need for legal services and increased access to the courts resulting from the pandemic. Families are struggling and spending considerably more to meet basic needs like food and shelter. Some families with children and young people face new impediments. For many young people, the isolation during the pandemic exacerbated what were already serious issues.  Civil Legal Aid provides services to young people in the child welfare system and those experiencing mental and physical health challenges in the schools and communities. Legal services interventions produce successful and healthy outcomes for those individuals, their families, their communities, and the institutions that help them.The pandemic also created changes in the access to justice delivery and court systems. Many courts and litigants use remote technology for court proceedings, increasing court efficiency and appearance rates. Many low-income people face challenges in attending in-person hearings, such as childcare, work-related issues, distance and travel time, and cost of travel. Civil Legal Aid can help low-income Texans facing technological barriers by providing approximately 250 supported kiosks in communities throughout the state to assist with appearances in remote court proceedings. Through such kiosks, Civil Legal Aid would assist with using the technology, including instruction in basic videoconference protocols and other issues such as introducing evidence in a virtual hearing.EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS:The appropriation would fund two priorities: increased need for legal services and increased access to the courts resulting from the pandemic.PCLS TRACKING KEY:4.A.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
