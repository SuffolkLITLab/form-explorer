Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 
 
Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 

PECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge  Stephen  B.  Ables,  Chairman;  Judge  Billy  Ray 
Stubblefield,  Judge  David  Evans,  Judge  Ana  Estevez,  Judge 
Alfonso Charles 

Petitioner requested from Respondent copies of emails or notes sent or received by Judge 

Rayes, an assigned judge serving on a case in the 218th Judicial District Court (herein “Court”), 
or Court personnel that mentioned specific named individuals and were sent to or received from 
a specific list of email addresses or any other email address. Petitioner also requested telephone 
records that demonstrated calls or text messages sent to or received by specific individuals and 
telephone numbers and notes taken during telephone calls from the phone used by Judge Rayes 
to communicate about court matters. The judge of the Court in his capacity as local 
administrative district judge denied Petitioner’s request asserting they were exempt under Rule 
12.5 of the Rules of Judicial Administration.  Petitioner then filed this appeal. 

e first address the issue of who the appropriate respondent is in this appeal.  Originally, 

Judge Rayes was identified as the sole respondent.1 Upon further review and the fact that 
Petitioner’s request involves emails sent or received by Court staff, it is our opinion that the 
Court is also a proper respondent in this case.  The Office of Court Administration sent 
correspondence regarding this appeal to Judge Rayes in care of the local administrative district 
judge at the Court’s email and physical addresses but neither Judge Rayes nor the Court 
submitted a response to the petition. Because the Court was not originally listed as a respondent 
and to ensure that we consider any exemptions that apply to the responsive records, we grant the 
Court 14 days from the date of this decision to provide a response if the Court desires to do so.  

ext, we address the issues raised by Petitioner. The special committee’s authority under 
Rule 12 is limited to the review of the denial of access to judicial records as defined by Rule 12. 
Rule 12.2(d) defines a judicial record as one that is “made or maintained by or for a court or 

1 Assigned judges serve many courts and in some instances may be considered custodians of the records that they 
create and maintain separately from the courts they serve.

judicial agency in its regular course of business but not pertaining to its adjudicative function, 
regardless of whether that function relates to a specific case.  A record of any nature created, 
produced, or filed in connection with any matter that is or has been before a court is not a judicial 
record.”   

ased on our review of the petition, it appears that Judge Rayes was assigned to serve on 

a case in which Petitioner is a party and that the records Petitioner seeks are emails, telephone 
records, and notes reflecting communications or calls sent or received by Judge Rayes and Court 
staff and the attorneys and staff who represent another party in the same case.  We have reviewed 
the sample email provided by Petitioner and conclude that it is related to the case in which 
Petitioner is a party.  Thus, the sample email and any similar emails or notes related to 
Petitioner’s case pertain to the Respondents’ adjudicative function and are not covered by Rule 
12.   

f responsive emails or notes exist that were made or are maintained by Respondents or 

Court staff and do not pertain to the Respondents’ adjudicative function, they would be subject to 
Rule 12 and should be released unless they are exempt from disclosure. In the Court’s denial of 
Petitioner’s request, the Court asserted that the requested records were exempt from disclosure 
under Rule 12.5 but did not provide any specific exemptions. Without additional information or 
copies of the responsive documents we are unable to confirm whether they are exempt from 
disclosure.  Accordingly, we must conclude that any responsive emails or notes made or 
maintained by Respondents or Court staff that do not pertain to Petitioner’s case or Respondents’ 
adjudicative function should be released. If they contain information that Respondents believe is 
exempt from disclosure, we give the Court 14 days from the date of this decision to submit a 
written response specifying the exemption claimed and to tender the judicial records for our in 
camera review. 
   
We next address Petitioner’s request for telephone records.  Prior Rule 12 special 
committees have concluded that telephone records are subject to disclosure under Rule 12.  See 
Rule 12 Decision Nos. 11-009 and 11-017.  If Respondents are the custodians of these records 
they should be provided to Petitioner. If they contain information that is exempt from disclosure 
under Rule 12, we give the Court 14 days from the date of this decision to submit a written 
response specifying the exemption claimed and to tender the judicial records for our in camera 
review.  If Respondents are not the custodians of these records and Respondents can ascertain 
who the records custodian is, Respondents should refer Petitioner’s request to the proper records 
custodian. See Rule 12.6(f).  

n  summary,  the  petition  is  granted  in  part  and  Petitioner  should  be  provided  the 
requested records if they are not related to a case or the Respondents’ adjudicative function.  In 
the event that portions of the responsive records are exempt, the Court may submit them for our 
in camera review.  If Respondents are not the custodians of the requested telephone records but 
can  ascertain  who  is,  they  should  forward  Petitioner’s  request  to  the  appropriate  records 
custodian.
