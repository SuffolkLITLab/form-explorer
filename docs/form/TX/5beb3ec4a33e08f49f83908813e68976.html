A FIELD GUIDE TO THE TAXES OF TEXAS

E very year, the state of Texas collects billions of dollars in state taxes and fees, federal 

receipts and other sources of revenue. These funds are used to pay for all of the responsibilities 

of the state government, including the education of more than 5.4 million public school students 

and the provision of health insurance for 5.7 million low-income Texans.

This guide provides an overview of the major Texas state taxes. Read on to:

•  learn how major taxes have contributed to state revenue during the past 10 years;

•  see revenue collections, estimates and allocations on one page; and

•  connect to other in-depth resources about state taxes and finances.

Cumulative Growth Rates

State tax collections saw higher cumulative growth rates than Texas personal income before fiscal 2014. Collections declined 
in 2016 due to franchise tax cuts and a slowdown in the oil and gas industries. Tax collections rebounded in 2018 due mostly 
to increased remittances from taxpayers in the oil and gas industries and rose moderately in 2019 as taxable spending in these 
industries plateaued.

Some tax categories saw record year-over-year declines in fiscal 2020 collections due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a 
collapse in oil prices. As the Texas economy began to recover and oil prices rebounded, tax collections in nearly every category 
grew in fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2022, state tax collections saw record growth due to a vigorous economic rebound from the 
pandemic, high energy prices and inflation.

Where Does Texas’ Tax Revenue Come From?

While Texas is a relatively low-tax state, it relies on revenue generated by more than 30 different taxes to fund the 
functions of state government. Nearly all of this revenue is generated by the following major taxes:

•  Texas imposes a 6.25 percent sales and use tax  
on sales, leases and rentals of goods as well as on 
taxable services such as telecommunications and 
amusement services.

• Texas’ severance taxes are imposed on entities that 
extract nonrenewable natural resources such as oil or 
natural gas. They are levied at rates of 4.6 percent of 
market value for oil and condensate and 7.5 percent of 
market value for natural gas. Revenues from these taxes 
are highly variable depending on market conditions.

• Texas taxes motor vehicle sales at a rate of 

6.25 percent of the sales price minus any trade-in 
allowance. Motor vehicle rentals are taxed at  
6.25 percent or 10 percent of gross receipts  
depending on the length of the rental contract.

• The state’s insurance taxes include a number  
of premium taxes levied at rates ranging from 0.5 

percent to 4.85 percent of gross premiums, as well  
as various maintenance taxes.

• Texas’ motor fuel tax rates can vary depending  

on the type of fuel; the two most common, gasoline  
and diesel, are both taxed at 20 cents per gallon.

• Texas’ “sin” taxes are levied on tobacco and  

alcoholic beverage products. The largest taxes in 
revenue terms are the cigarette tax, levied at $1.41  
per pack of 20, and mixed beverage taxes, imposed  
on consumers at 8.25 percent of the sales price  
and on business permit holders at 6.7 percent of  
gross receipts.

• The state’s franchise tax is imposed on certain kinds 
of businesses operating in Texas, such as corporations, 
banks, limited liability corporations and partnerships.  
Of the millions of businesses across the state, only  
about 160,000 filers usually owe any franchise tax.

Texas’ total tax revenue rose by 25.6 percent in fiscal 2022, to $77.2 
billion. Sales, oil production and natural gas production taxes each had 
multiple months of record high revenue collections during the year.

GLENN HEGAR • TEXAS COMPTROLLER OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTSWhere Does Texas’ Tax Revenue Go?

For accounting and budgeting purposes, state revenue is 
deposited or transferred into various funds, with most going 
into the General Revenue Fund (GR) for appropriation by the 
Legislature. Some tax revenue, however, is deposited directly 
or transferred into special funds for specific purposes. Three of 
the state’s most prominent special revenue funds are the State 
Highway Fund (SHF), the Property Tax Relief Fund (PTRF) and  
the Economic Stabilization Fund (ESF).

The SHF is used for the construction, maintenance and policing 
of public roads. Historically, the primary revenues for this fund 
have been federal receipts, 75 percent of motor fuel tax net 
collections, most motor vehicle registration fees and, since fiscal 
2015, one-half of 75 percent of oil production and natural gas 
production tax revenues exceeding fiscal 1987 collections in any 
fiscal year. Beginning in fiscal 2018, based on a constitutional 
amendment approved by Texas voters in 2015, the first $2.5 
billion of state sales tax collections in excess of $28 billion 
a fiscal year were transferred to the SHF. The constitutional 
amendment also called for depositing 35 percent of motor 
vehicle sales and rental tax collections in excess of $5 billion  
to the SHF, a threshold that first was met in fiscal 2021. In  
 

State Highway Fund (SHF)

the 2024-25 biennium, the Comptroller’s office estimates the  
SHF will receive $34.2 billion from all sources.

The PTRF is used along with GR and other funds to finance the 
state’s K-12 public education system. The major revenue sources 
for this fund include the amount of franchise tax collections 
generated by its restructuring in fiscal 2008, and revenue from the 
$1 increase in the cigarette tax rate implemented in fiscal 2007. 
Over the 2024-25 biennium, the Comptroller’s office estimates  
the PTRF will receive $5.2 billion from all revenue sources.

The ESF, also known as the Rainy Day Fund, receives one-half 
of 75 percent of oil production and natural gas production tax 
revenues in any fiscal year that exceeds fiscal 1987 collections, 
and one-half of any unencumbered GR surplus remaining 
at the end of each biennium. It is estimated there will be an 
unencumbered GR balance transfer into the ESF of $5.7 billion 
in fiscal 2024, in addition to a $3.3 billion transfer of severance 
taxes. With the transfer of severance taxes in fiscal 2025, the 
constitutional ESF cap is expected to be reached for the first  
time in its existence. A portion of the severance tax transfer  
(an estimated $689 million) as well as interest earnings from  
the fund (an estimated $184 million) will be retained in GR  
and available for general-purpose spending.

KEY TO SOURCES, PAGES 6-17

The motor vehicle sales and use tax,  
the largest tax in this category, is 
imposed on the retail sales price, less 
trade-in allowance, of motor vehicles  
sold in Texas. The motor vehicle rental 
tax is levied as a percentage of gross 
receipts derived from the rental of a 
vehicle, at a rate that varies depending 
on the length of the rental.

In November 2015, voters approved a 
constitutional amendment to deposit  
35 percent of the net annual revenue 
from these taxes above $5 billion to  
the SHF. The $5 billion threshold  
was first reached in fiscal 2021 with  
a transfer of $237 million, and the  
transfer is projected to total $1.1  
billion in the 2022-23 biennium  
and $1.4 billion in 2024-25.

Non-tax Revenue

The state’s major non-tax revenue 
sources are federal income, fees and 
licenses, state health-related fees  
and rebates, state lottery proceeds,  
land income and proceeds from the 
state’s investments.

Taxes That Texas Does Not Levy

Texas does not collect a state property 
tax. Property taxes are levied by local 
governmental entities, school districts 
and special purpose districts (see p. 20).

Texans pay federal income taxes, but 
not state or local income taxes. Federal 
dollars contributed 40 percent of total 
state net revenue in fiscal 2022.

SALES AND USE TAXES

E N A C T E D   1 9 6 1
Sales and use taxes are the state’s single 
largest source of tax revenue, raising 
about 56 cents of every state tax dollar 
in fiscal 2022. The sales tax generally is 
imposed on final sales, rentals and leases 
of tangible personal property — physical 
goods or their classified equivalent — 
and on sales of certain services, such as 
amusements, telephone services and the 
repair of tangible personal property.

Starting in fiscal 2018, a constitutional 
amendment requires up to $2.5 billion  
to be transferred to the SHF from net 
sales tax revenue in excess of $28  
billion each fiscal year.

The 2019 passage of House Bill (HB) 1525 
by the 86th Legislature, requiring online 
marketplace providers to collect taxes on 
sales made through their platforms, has 
resulted in additional sales tax collections 
of $3.2 billion through fiscal 2022 and 
will bring in an estimated additional $1.5 
billion in fiscal 2023 and $3.3 billion in 
2024-25. This revenue is deposited outside 
GR to the Tax Reduction and Excellence in 
Education Fund.

The motor vehicle sales and use tax,  
the largest tax in this category, is 
imposed on the retail sales price, less 
trade-in allowance, of motor vehicles  
sold in Texas. The motor vehicle rental 
tax is levied as a percentage of gross 
receipts derived from the rental of a 
vehicle, at a rate that varies depending 
on the length of the rental.

In November 2015, voters approved a 
constitutional amendment to deposit  
35 percent of the net annual revenue 
from these taxes above $5 billion to  
the SHF. The $5 billion threshold  
was first reached in fiscal 2021 with  
a transfer of $237 million, and the  
transfer is projected to total $1.1  
billion in the 2022-23 biennium  
and $1.4 billion in 2024-25.

MOTOR FUEL TAXES

Motor fuel taxes are the state’s 
consumption taxes on gasoline, diesel 
fuel and liquefied and compressed 
natural gas. In general, these taxes  
are charged on each gallon of fuel  
sold in Texas used to propel vehicles  
on Texas’ public roads.

The rates for the gasoline and diesel  
fuel taxes last changed in 1991, when 
they were both increased from 15  
cents to 20 cents per gallon.

FRANCHISE TAX

The franchise or “margins” tax is the 
current version of one of the state’s 
oldest taxes, levied for the privilege  
of doing business in Texas. The tax 
due is based on an entity’s apportioned 
taxable margin.1

In 2006, the Legislature made 
significant changes to the tax, including 
transitioning to the taxable margin as 
the sole base component and expanding 
the tax to limited partnerships, business 
trusts and other legal entities. These 
changes apply to reports due on or  
after Jan. 1, 2008.

In 2015, the Legislature voted to reduce 
franchise tax rates by 25 percent,  
which took effect in fiscal 2016.

LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES

Property taxes are levied by counties, 
cities, school districts and special 
purpose districts such as community 
colleges and public hospitals. These  
local entities can levy a property tax  
by adopting a tax rate with two 
components: a maintenance and 
operations (M&O) rate, and an interest 
and sinking (I&S) rate (also referred  
to as debt service). A separate entity 
called a county appraisal district  
is responsible for determining the 
market value of each property  
within each county.

While the state of Texas has not levied  
a property tax since 1980, local  
property values have a direct impact  
on the state budget due to the nature  
of the school finance system.

1  The figures presented are calculated totals for each tax 
year based on data self-reported to the Comptroller’s 
office and not actual total property tax levies. The 
Comptroller’s office does not guarantee the accuracy  
of self-reported information.

2  Average property tax rates are weighted by calculated 
property tax levies and include only entities that report 
levying the respective tax to the Comptroller’s office.

3  Rate limits represent the general rule applied to nearly 
all applicable entities. There may be cases, however, in 
which some entities can exceed this limit or are subject  
to a more restrictive tax rate limit.

4  Tax rate compression began in tax year 2019 as the result 
of HB 3, 86th Legislature, Regular Session. The maximum 
M&O tax rate for a school district is the district’s 

maximum compressed rate, as calculated by the Texas 
Education Agency based on estimated property value 
growth and provided to the district each August, plus  
up to an additional 17 cents.

5  Education Code Section 45.0031, sometimes referred 
to as the “50-cent test,” requires school districts to 
demonstrate to the Attorney General’s office their ability 
to pay the principal and interest on any proposed bonds, 
as well as all outstanding bonds, from a tax rate not to 
exceed 50 cents.

6  Tax Code Section 302.001 restricts Type B general law 
municipalities to an annual property tax rate of no more 
than 25 cents. Texas Constitution Article XI, Sections 
4 and 5, restrict other general law and home-rule 
municipalities based on population size.

LOCAL SALES TAXES

Like state sales tax, local sales tax is 
imposed on final sales, rentals and leases 
of tangible personal property — physical 
goods or their classified equivalent —  
and on sales of certain services, such as 
amusement, information and telephone 
services, as well as the repair of tangible 
personal property.

Local sales tax is collected by retailers 
across the state and remitted to the 
Comptroller’s office along with state sales 
tax. The Comptroller then distributes the 
local portion of sales tax collections to 
local governmental entities each month.

The passage of HB 2153 by the 86th 
Legislature provided a single local  
tax rate for remote sellers. Remote  
sellers with total Texas revenue above 
$500,000 are required to collect and 
remit local use taxes and may choose  
to collect the single local tax rate or the 
local tax based on the total local tax rate 
in effect at the destination. The single 
local tax rate for 2023 is 1.75 percent.

The Texas Constitution requires the Comptroller’s 
office to estimate the amount of revenue available 
to the Legislature for general-purpose spending 
in each biennium. The Biennial Revenue Estimate 
(BRE) is published just before the start of each 
regular legislative session and revised as necessary 
at the beginning of each special session. The state 
constitution requires legislators to approve a 
balanced budget for state spending that may not 
become law until the Comptroller certifies that it  
is within available revenue.

T H E   B U D G E T   P R O C E S S
I N  B R I E F

General Appropriations Act —  
“The Budget”
The General Appropriations Act embodies the  
Texas state government’s two-year budget.

State budget writers are required to limit  
spending growth from the current budget to the  
next. Under the constitutional spending limit, 
the growth rate of spending from tax revenue not 
dedicated by the state constitution must not exceed 
the estimated growth of the state’s economy as 
determined by the Legislative Budget Board (LBB). 
Only majority votes by both the House and Senate 
can override the spending limit. A second statutory 
spending cap, created by Senate Bill 1336, 87th 
Legislature, Regular Session, limits the growth of 
consolidated general revenue appropriations to the 
estimated growth of the state’s economy and requires 
a vote of three-fifths of each legislative chamber to 
exceed. For the 2024-25 biennium, the LBB approved 
a 12.33 percent cap for both spending limits.

State Spending Decisions
In recent years, the majority of state expenditures 
have gone toward:

•  health and human services programs such  
as Medicaid, adult and child protection and  
assistance to the disabled and those in poverty;

•  public education spending that supplements  

local property tax revenues;

•  transportation, road and bridge maintenance  

and construction, and airports;

•  higher education;

•  law enforcement, courts and prisons;

•  state government operations; and

•  natural resources and state parks.

24

25

GLENN HEGAR • TEXAS COMPTROLLER OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTSEach state agency prepares a detailed legislative appropriations request (LAR) itemizing the funding it seeks for the upcoming biennium.After several reviews, hearings and approvals, the LBB uses the LARs to draft the general appropriations bill, which then is submitted to the Legislature.The Governor also submits an independently developed budget to the Legislature.Prior to the legislative session, the Comptroller’s office issues the Biennial Revenue Estimate, outlining funds to become available from taxes and other revenue sources for the biennium. Following the regular legislative session, the Comptroller’s office reevaluates this estimate in light of changing economic conditions, as well as the fiscal impacts of any legislative changes. A Certification Revenue Estimate is published early in the new biennium that provides lawmakers with an updated picture of the state’s expected fiscal condition during the two-year budget cycle.Budget Approval Steps• The Texas House Committee on Appropriations and the Senate Finance Committee simultaneously deliberate on the general appropriations bill. After the committees pass their versions of the bills, the full House and Senate consider each version.• A conference committee of both House and Senate members works to combine the two versions into the final General Appropriations Act, which then  is voted on by both chambers.• Once approved, it goes to the Comptroller’s office for final certification that the bill is within  available revenue.• The last step is the Governor’s signature. Once signed, the bill becomes law, allocating the state’s funds for two more years. The Governor may veto individual spending items within the budget.RESOURCES
