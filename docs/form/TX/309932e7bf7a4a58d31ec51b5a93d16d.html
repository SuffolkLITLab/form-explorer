Rule 11. Pretrial Proceedings in Certain Cases. 

11.1  Applicability.  This  rule  applies  to  any  case  filed  before  September  1,  2003,  that 
involves  material  questions  of  fact  and  law  in  common  with  another  case  pending  in 
another court in another county on or after October 1, 1997. 

11.2 Definitions. 

in which a case is pending; 

(a) Presiding judge means the presiding judge of an administrative judicial region 

(b) Regular judge means the regular judge of a court in which a case is pending. 

(c) Pretrial judge means a judge assigned under this rule. 

(d) Related means that cases involve common material issues of fact and law. 

11.3 Assignment of Pretrial Judge. 

(a) By presiding judge. On motion or request under 11.4, a presiding judge may 
assign  an  active  district  judge,  including  himself  or  herself,  to  a  case  to  conduct  all 
pretrial proceedings and decide all pretrial matters. 

(b)  Authority  of  pretrial  judge.  The  pretrial  judge  will  preside  over  all  pretrial 
proceedings  in  the  case  in  place  of  the  regular  judge.  The  pretrial  judge  will  decide  all 
pretrial motions, including motions to transfer venue and motions for summary judgment. 
The pretrial judge and the regular judge must consult on setting a trial date. 

(c) Different judges assigned. The same pretrial judge need not be assigned in all 
related  cases.  If  more  than  one  pretrial  judge  is  assigned  in  related  cases,  either  in  the 
same  region  or  in  different  regions,  the  pretrial  judges  must  consult  with  each  other  in 
conducting pretrial proceedings and deciding pretrial matters. 

 

Page 9

assign  an  active  district  judge  to  other  administrative  regions  to  allow  the  judge  to  be 
assigned as a pretrial judge under this rule. 

(e)  No  objections  to  pretrial  judge.  An  assignment  under  this  rule  is  not  made 
pursuant to section 74.054 of the Government Code, and therefore a pretrial judge is not 
subject to an objection under section 74.053 of the Government Code. 

(f) Termination of assignment. An assignment under this rule terminates when: 

(i) all pretrial proceedings in a case have been completed; 

(ii) the pretrial judge ceases to be an active district judge; or

assignment.

conduct of the cases. 

Otherwise, the presiding judge must deny the motion or request. 

(i) Order. The presiding judge must issue an order deciding the motion or request. 

The order must be filed in the case in which assignment of a pretrial judge was sought. 

(j) Service and notice. A  party must serve  any paper filed under this  rule on  all 
parties to the cases identified under (b)(1) and (b)(2) and on the presiding judge or judges 
for those cases. If a judge files any paper under this rule, the clerk of the court in which 
the paper is filed must send a copy to all parties to the cases identified under (b)(1) and 
(b)(2) and to the presiding judge or judges for those cases. The clerk of the court where a 
case is pending in which assignment of a pretrial judge is sought shall serve as the clerk 
for the presiding judge under this rule.

11.5  Review.  A  presiding  judge's  order  granting  or  denying  a  motion  or  request  for 
appointment  of  a  pretrial  judge  may  be  reviewed  only  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  an 
original mandamus proceeding. 

11.6 Expenses of Pretrial Judge. If a pretrial judge travels outside the judge's county of 
residence  to  conduct  proceedings,  the  county  in  which  the  proceedings  are  conducted 
must pay--on certification by the presiding judge of the administrative judicial region in 
which  the  other  county  is  located--the  pretrial  judge's  actual  travel  expenses  and  actual 
living expenses incurred for conducting the proceedings. 

11.7 Relationship to Rule 13. 

(a)  Generally.  This  rule  is  to  be  construed  and  applied  so  as  to  facilitate  the 

implementation of Rule 13 to the greatest extent possible. 

(b) Application of Rule 13 by Agreement of the Parties. Parties may agree to the 
application of Rule 13.  Such an agreement must be in writing and must be joined by all 
parties  to  the  case.  An  agreement  is effective and irrevocable  when it is filed with  the 
trial court if: 

(1) no pretrial judge has been appointed in the case, or 

(2)  a  pretrial  judge  has  been  appointed  in  the  case,  and  the  parties  in  all 
related  cases  to  which  the  same  pretrial  judge  has  been  assigned  have  likewise 
agreed to the application of Rule 13. 

(c) Assignment of Pretrial Judges After September 1, 2003.  An assignment of a 
pretrial judge to any case after September 1, 2003, must be made in consultation with the 
Chair of the Multidistrict Litigation Panel. 

(d)  Consultation  of  Pretrial  Judges.  In  conducting  pretrial  proceedings  and 
deciding pretrial matters, a pretrial judge assigned under this rule must consult with the 
judge of a pretrial court to which related cases have been transferred under Rule 13. 

Rule 12. Public Access to Judicial Records 

12.1  Policy.  The  purpose  of  this  rule  is  to  provide  public  access  to  information  in  the 
judiciary consistent with the mandates of the Texas Constitution that the public interests 
are  best  served  by  open  courts  and  by  an  independent  judiciary.  The  rule  should  be 
liberally construed to achieve its purpose. 

12.2 Definitions. In this rule: 

(a) Judge means a regularly appointed or elected judge or justice. 

 

Page 12 

(b)  Judicial  agency  means  an  office,  board,  commission,  or  other  similar  entity 
that is in the Judicial Department and that serves an administrative function for a court. A 
task force or committee created by a court or judge is a “judicial agency”. 

(c)  Judicial  officer  means  a  judge,  former  or  retired  visiting  judge,  referee, 
commissioner,  special  master,  court-appointed  arbitrator,  or  other  person  exercising 
adjudicatory powers in the judiciary. A mediator or other provider of non-binding dispute 
resolution services is not a “judicial officer”. 

(d)  Judicial  record  means  a  record  made  or  maintained  by  or  for  a  court  or 
judicial  agency  in  its  regular  course  of  business  but  not  pertaining  to  its  adjudicative 
function,  regardless  of  whether  that  function  relates  to  a  specific  case.  A  record  of  any 
nature created, produced, or filed in connection with any matter that is or has been before 
a  court  is  not  a  judicial  record.  A  record  is  a  document,  paper,  letter,  map,  book,  tape, 
photograph, film, recording, or other material, regardless of electronic or physical form, 
characteristics, or means of transmission. 

(e)  Records  custodian  means  the  person  with  custody  of  a  judicial  record 

determined as follows: 

(1) The judicial records  of a court with only one judge, such as  any trial 
court,  are  in  the  custody  of  that  judge.  Judicial  records  pertaining  to  the  joint 
administration  of  a  number  of  those  courts,  such  as  the  district  courts  in  a 
particular county or region, are in the custody of the judge who presides over the 
joint administration, such as the local or regional administrative judge. 

(2) The judicial records of a court with more than one judge, such as any 
appellate  court,  are  in  the  custody  of  the  chief  justice  or  presiding  judge,  who 
must act under this rule in accordance with the vote of a majority of the judges of 
the court. But the judicial records relating specifically to the service of one such 
judge or that judge's own staff are in the custody of that judge. 

(3) The judicial records of a judicial officer not covered by subparagraphs 

(1) and (2) are in the custody of that officer. 

(4)  The  judicial  records  of  a  judicial  agency  are  in  the  custody  of  its 
presiding officer, who must act under this rule in accordance with agency policy 
or the vote of a majority of the members of the agency. 

12.3 Applicability. This rule does not apply to: 

(a) records or information to which access is controlled by: 

(1) a state or federal court rule, including: 

 

Page 13 

(A) a rule of civil or criminal procedure, including Rule 76a, Texas 

Rules of Civil Procedure; 

(B) a rule of appellate procedure; 

(C) a rule of evidence; 

(D) a rule of administration; 

(2) a state or federal court order not issued merely to thwart the purpose of 

this rule; 

(3) the Code of Judicial Conduct; 

(4) Chapter 552, Government Code, or another statute or provision of law; 

(b)  records  or  information  to  which  Chapter  552,  Government  Code,  is  made 
inapplicable by statute, rule, or other provision of law, other than Section 552.003(1)(B); 

(c) records or information relating to an arrest or search warrant or a supporting 

affidavit, access to which is controlled by: 

(1)  a  state  or  federal  court  rule,  including  a  rule  of  civil  or  criminal 

procedure, appellate procedure, or evidence; or 

(2) common law, court order, judicial decision, or another provision of law 

(d) elected officials other than judges. 

12.4 Access to Judicial Records. 

(a) Generally.  Judicial  records  other than those  covered by  Rules 12.3 and  12.5 
are open to the general public for inspection and copying during regular business hours. 
But this rule does not require a court, judicial agency, or records custodian to: 

(1) create a record, other than to print information stored in a computer; 

(2) retain a judicial record for a specific period of time; 

(3) allow the inspection of or provide a copy of information in a book or 

publication commercially available to the public; or 

(4)  respond  to  or  comply  with  a  request  for  a  judicial  record  from  or  on 
behalf of an individual who is imprisoned or confined in a correctional facility as 
defined in Section 1.07(a), Penal Code, or in any other such facility in any state, 
federal, or foreign jurisdiction. 

 

Page 14 

(b) Voluntary Disclosure. A records  custodian  may voluntarily  make  part  or all 
of the information in a judicial record available to the public, subject to Rules 12.2(e)(2) 
and 12.2(e)(4), unless the disclosure is expressly prohibited by law or exempt under this 
rule, or the information is confidential under law. Information voluntarily disclosed must 
be made available to any person who requests it. 

12.5  Exemptions  from  Disclosure.  The  following  records  are  exempt  from  disclosure 
under this rule: 

(a)  Judicial  Work  Product  and  Drafts.  Any  record  that  relates  to  a  judicial 
officer's  adjudicative  decision-making  process  prepared  by  that  judicial  officer,  by 
another judicial officer, or by court staff, an intern, or any other person acting on behalf 
of or at the direction of the judicial officer. 

(b) Security Plans. Any record, including a security plan or code, the release of 
which would jeopardize the security of an individual against physical injury or jeopardize 
information  or  property  against  theft,  tampering,  improper  use,  illegal  disclosure, 
trespass, unauthorized access, or physical injury. 

(c)  Personnel  Information.  Any  personnel  record  that,  if  disclosed,  would 

constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. 

(d) Home Address and Family Information. Any record reflecting any person's 
home  address,  home  or  personal  telephone  number,  social  security  number,  or  family 
members. 

(e) Applicants for Employment or Volunteer Services. Any records relating to an 

applicant for employment or volunteer services. 

(f)  Internal  Deliberations  on  Court  or  Judicial  Administration  Matters.  Any

officers or members of a judicial agency, on matters of court or judicial administration. 

(g)  Court  Law  Library  Information.  Any  record  in  a  law  library  that  links  a 

patron's name with the materials requested or borrowed by that patron. 

(h)  Judicial  Calendar  Information.  Any  record  that  reflects  a  judicial  officer's 
appointments  or  engagements  that  are  in  the  future  or  that  constitute  an  invasion  of 
personal privacy. 

(i) Information Confidential Under Other Law. Any record that is confidential or 
exempt  from  disclosure  under  a  state  or  federal  constitutional  provision,  statute  or 
common law, including information that relates to: 

 

Page 15 

(1)  a  complaint  alleging  misconduct  against  a  judicial  officer,  if  the 
complaint  is  exempt  from  disclosure  under  Chapter  33,  Government  Code,  or 
other law; 

(2)  a  complaint  alleging  misconduct  against  a  person  who  is  licensed  or 
regulated by the courts, if the information is confidential under applicable law; or 

(3) a trade secret or commercial or financial information made privileged 

or confidential by statute or judicial decision. 

(j) Litigation or Settlement Negotiations. Any judicial record relating to civil or 

criminal litigation or settlement negotiations: 

(1) in which a court or judicial agency is or may be a party; or 

(2) in which a judicial officer or member of a judicial agency is or may be 

a party as a consequence of the person's office or employment. 

(k)  Investigations  of  Character  or  Conduct.  Any  record  relating  to  an 

investigation of any person's character or conduct, unless: 

(1) the record is requested by the person being investigated; and 

(2) release of the record, in the judgment of the records custodian, would 

not impair the investigation. 

(l)  Examinations.  Any  record  relating  to  an  examination  administered  to  any 

person, unless requested by the person after the examination is concluded. 

12.6 Procedures for Obtaining Access to Judicial Records. 

(a) Request. A request to inspect or copy a judicial record must be in writing and 
must  include  sufficient  information  to  reasonably  identify  the  record  requested.  The 
request must be sent to the records custodian and not to a court clerk or other agent for 
the  records  custodian.  A  requestor  need  not  have  detailed  knowledge  of  the  records 
custodian's filing system or procedures in order to obtain the information. 

(b) Time for Inspection and Delivery of Copies. As soon as practicable--and not 
more than 14 days--after actual receipt of a request to inspect or copy a judicial record, if 
the record is available, the records custodian must either: 

(1) allow the requestor to inspect the record and provide a copy if one is 

requested; or 

(2)  send  written  notice  to  the  requestor  stating  that  the  record  cannot 
within  the prescribed  period  be produced or  a  copy provided,  as  applicable,  and 

 

Page 16 

setting a reasonable date and time when the document will be produced or a copy 
provided, as applicable. 

(c) Place for Inspection. A  records custodian must produce  a requested  judicial 

record at a convenient, public area. 

(d) Part of Record Subject to Disclosure. If part of a requested record is subject 
to disclosure under this rule and part is not, the records custodian must redact the portion 
of  the  record  that  is  not  subject  to  disclosure,  permit  the  remainder  of  the  record  to  be 
inspected, and provide a copy if requested. 

(e)  Copying;  Mailing.  The  records  custodian  may  deliver  the  record  to  a  court 
clerk  for  copying.  The  records  custodian  may  mail  the  copy  to  a  requestor  who  has 
prepaid the postage. 

(f)  Recipient  of  Request  not  Custodian  of  Record.  A  judicial  officer  or  a 
presiding officer of a judicial agency who receives a request for a judicial record not in 
his  or  her  custody  as  defined  by  this  rule  must  promptly  attempt  to  ascertain  who  the 
custodian of the record is. If the recipient of the request can ascertain who the custodian 
of the requested record is, the recipient must promptly refer the request to that person and 
notify the  requestor  in  writing of  the  referral. The  time for  response prescribed in Rule 
12.6(b)  does  not  begin  to  run  until  the  referral  is  actually  received  by  the  records 
custodian. If the recipient cannot ascertain who the custodian of the requested record is, 
the  recipient  must  promptly  notify  the  requestor  in  writing  that  the  recipient  is  not  the 
custodian of the record and cannot ascertain who the custodian of the record is. 

(g) Inquiry to Requestor. A person requesting a judicial record may not be asked 
to disclose the purpose of the request as a condition of obtaining the judicial record. But a 
records custodian may make inquiry to establish the proper identification of the requestor 
or to clarify the nature or scope of a request. 

(h) Uniform Treatment of Requests. A records custodian must treat all requests 
for information uniformly without regard to the position or occupation of the requestor or 
the  person  on  whose  behalf  a  request  is  made,  including  whether  the  requestor  or  such 
person is a member of the media. 

12.7 Costs for Copies of Judicial Records; Appeal of Assessment. 

(a) Cost. The cost for a copy of a judicial record is either: 

(1) the cost prescribed by statute, or 

(2)  if  no  statute  prescribes  the  cost,  the  cost  the  Office  of  the  Attorney 

General prescribes by rule in the Texas Administrative Code. 

 

Page 17 

(b)  Waiver  or  Reduction  of  Cost  Assessment  by  Records  Custodian.  A  records 

custodian may reduce or waive the charge for a copy of a judicial record if: 

(1)  doing  so  is  in  the  public  interest  because  providing  the  copy  of  the 

record primarily benefits the general public, or 

(2) the cost of processing collection of a charge will exceed the amount of 

the charge. 

(c) Appeal of Cost Assessment. A person who believes that a charge for a copy of 
a  judicial  record  is  excessive  may  appeal  the  overcharge  in  the  manner  prescribed  by 
Rule 12.9 for the appeal of the denial of access to a judicial record. 

(d) Records Custodian not Personally Responsible for Cost. A records custodian 

is not required to incur personal expense in furnishing a copy of a judicial record. 

12.8 Denial of Access to a Judicial Record. 

(a) When Request May be Denied. A records custodian may deny a request for a 

judicial record under this rule only if the records custodian: 

(1)  reasonably  determines  that  the  requested  judicial  record  is  exempt 

from required disclosure under this rule; or 

(2)  makes  specific,  non-conclusory  findings  that  compliance  with  the 
request would substantially and unreasonably impede the routine operation of the 
court or judicial agency. 

(b)  Time  to  Deny.  A  records  custodian  who  denies  access  to  a  judicial  record 
must notify the person requesting the record of the denial within a reasonable time--not to 
exceed 14 days--after receipt of the request, or before the deadline for responding to the 
request extended under Rule 12.6 (b)(2). 

(c) Contents of Notice of Denial. A notice of denial must be in writing and must: 

(1) state the reason for the denial;  

(2) inform the person of the right of appeal provided by Rule 12.9; and 

(3)  include  the  name  and  address  of  the  Administrative  Director  of  the 

Office of Court Administration. 

12.9 Relief from Denial of Access to Judicial Records. 

 

Page 18 

(a)  Appeal.  A  person  who  is  denied  access  to  a  judicial  record  may  appeal  the 
denial  by  filing  a  petition  for  review  with  the  Administrative  Director  of  the  Office  of 
Court Administration. 

(b) Contents of Petition for Review. The petition for review: 

(1)  must  include  a  copy  of  the  request  to  the  record  custodian  and  the 

records custodian's notice of denial; 

(2) may  include  any supporting  facts, arguments, and  authorities that the 

petitioner believes to be relevant; and 

(3)  may  contain  a  request  for  expedited  review,  the  grounds  for  which 

must be stated. 

(c) Time for Filing. The petition must be filed not later than 30 days after the date 

that the petitioner receives notice of a denial of access to the judicial record. 

(d) Notification of Records Custodian and Presiding Judges. Upon receipt of the 
petition  for  review,  the  Administrative  Director  must  promptly  notify  the  records 
custodian  who  denied  access  to  the  judicial  record  and  the  presiding  judge  of  each 
administrative judicial region of the filing of the petition. 

(e)  Response.  A  records  custodian  who  denies  access  to  a  judicial  record  and 
against whom relief is sought under this section may--within 14 days of receipt of notice 
from  the  Administrative  Director--submit  a  written  response  to  the  petition  for  review 
and include supporting facts and authorities in the response. The records custodian must 
mail a copy of the response to the petitioner. The records custodian may also submit for 
in camera inspection any record, or a sample of records, to which access has been denied. 

(f) Formation of Special Committee. Upon receiving notice under Rule 12.9(d), 
the presiding judges must refer the petition to a special committee of not less than five of 
the  presiding  judges  for  review.  The  presiding  judges  must  notify  the  Administrative 
Director, the petitioner, and the records custodian of the names of the judges selected to 
serve on the committee. 

(g)  Procedure  for  Review.  The  special  committee  must  review  the  petition  and 
the  records  custodian's  response  and  determine  whether  the  requested  judicial  record 
should  be  made  available  under  this  rule  to  the  petitioner.  The  special  committee  may 
request the records custodian to submit for in camera inspection a record, or a sample of 
records,  to  which  access  has  been  denied.  The  records  custodian  may  respond  to  the 
request in whole or in part but it not required to do so. 

(h)  Considerations.  When  determining  whether  the  requested  judicial  record 
should be made available under this rule to petition, the special committee must consider: 

 

Page 19 

(1) the text and policy of this Rule; 

(2)  any  supporting  and  controverting  facts,  arguments,  and  authorities  in 

the petition and the response; and 

(3)  prior  applications  of  this  Rule  by  other  special  committees  or  by 

courts. 

(i) Expedited Review. On request of the petitioner, and for good cause shown, the 

special committee may schedule an expedited review of the petition. 

(j)  Decision.  The  special  committee's  determination  must  be  supported  by  a 

written decision that must: 

(1)  issue  within  60  days  of  the  date  that  the  Administrative  Director 

received the petition for review; 

(2)  either  grant  the  petition  in  whole  or  in  part  or  sustain  the  denial  of 

access to the requested judicial record; 

(3) state the reasons for the decision, including appropriate citations to this 

rule; and 

(4) identify the record or portions of the record to which access is ordered 

or denied, but only if the description does not disclose confidential information. 

(k)  Notice  of  Decision.  The  special  committee  must  send  the  decision  to  the 
Administrative  Director.  On  receipt  of  the  decision  from  the  special  committee,  the 
Administrative Director must: 

(1)  immediately  notify  the  petitioner  and  the  records  custodian  of  the 

decision and include a copy of the decision with the notice; and 

(2)  maintain  a  copy  of  the  special  committee's  decision  in  the 

Administrative Director's office for public inspection. 

(l)  Publication  of  Decisions.  The  Administrative  Director  must  publish 

periodically to the judiciary and the general public the special committees' decisions. 

(m)  Final  Decision.  A  decision  of  a  special  committee  under  this  rule  is  not 

appealable but is subject to review by mandamus. 

(n)  Appeal  to  Special  Committee  Not  Exclusive  Remedy.  The  right  of  review 
provided  under  this  subdivision  is  not  exclusive  and  does  not  preclude  relief  by 
mandamus. 

 

Page 20 

12.10  Sanctions.  A  records  custodian  who  fails  to  comply  with  this  rule,  knowing  that 
the failure to comply is in violation of the rule, is subject to sanctions under the Code of 
Judicial Conduct. 

Comments 

1.  Although  the  definition  of  “judicial  agency”  in  Rule  12.2(b)  is  comprehensive, 
applicability  of  the  rule  is  restricted  by  Rule  12.3.  The  rule  does  not  apply  to  judicial 
agencies whose records are expressly made subject to disclosure by statute, rule, or law. 
An example is the State Bar (“an administrative agency of the judicial department”, Tex. 
Gov't Code § 81.011(a)), which is subject to the Public Information Act. Tex. Gov't Code 
§ 81.033. Thus, no judicial agency must comply with both the Act and this rule; at most 
one can apply. Nor does the rule apply to judicial agencies expressly excepted from the 
Act by statute (other than by the general judiciary exception in section 552.003(b) of the 
Act),  rule,  or  law.  Examples  are  the  Board  of  Legal  Specialization,  Tex.  Gov't  Code  § 
81.033, and the Board of Disciplinary Appeals, Tex. R. Disciplinary App. 7.12. Because 
these  boards  are  expressly  excepted  from  the  Act,  their  records  are  not  subject  to 
disclosure  under  this  rule,  even  though  no  law  affirmatively  makes  their  records 
confidential. The Board of Law Examiners is partly subject to the Act and partly exempt, 
Tex. Gov't Code § 82.003, and therefore this rule is inapplicable to it. An example of a 
judicial agency  subject  to  the rule is the  Supreme  Court Advisory  Committee,  which is 
neither subject to nor expressly excepted from the Act, and whose records are not made 
confidential by any law. 

2. As stated in Rule 12.4, this rule does not require the creation or retention of records, 
but neither does it permit the destruction of records that are required to be maintained by 
statute  or  other  law,  such  as  Tex.  Gov't  Code  §§  441.158-.167,  .180-.203;  Tex.  Local 
Gov't Code ch. 203; and 13 Tex. Admin. Code § 7.122. 

3. Rule 12.8 allows a records custodian to deny a record request that would substantially 
and  unreasonably  impede  the  routine  operation  of  the  court  or  judicial  agency.  As  an 
illustration,  and  not  by  way  of  limitation,  a  request  for  “all  judicial  records”  that  is 
submitted  every  day  or  even  every  few  days  by  the  same  person  or  persons  acting  in 
concert could substantially and unreasonably impede the operations of a court or judicial 
agency that lacked the staff to respond to such repeated requests.  

 
4.  Comment to 2008 change:  The Attorney General’s rule, adopted in accordance with 
Section 552.262 of the Government Code, is in Section 70.3 of Title I of the Texas 
Administrative Code.

(B) all  parties  in  those  cases  and  the  names,  addresses,  telephone 

numbers, fax numbers, and email addresses of all counsel. 

(b) Request  for  Transfer  by  Judges.  A  trial  court  or  a  presiding  judge  of  an 
administrative  judicial  region  may request a transfer of  related  cases  to a  pretrial court. 
The request must be in writing and must list the cases to be transferred. 
 

(c) Transfer on the MDL Panel's Own Initiative. The MDL Panel may, on its own 
initiative, issue an order to show cause why related cases should not be transferred to a 
pretrial court. 
 

(d) Response;  Reply;  Who  May  File;  When  to  File.  Any  party  in  a  related  case 

may file: 
 

(1) a response to a motion or request for transfer within twenty days after 

service of such motion or request; 

(2) a  response  to  an  order  to  show  cause  issued  under  subparagraph  (c) 

within the time provided in the order; and 

(3) a reply to a response within ten days after service of such response. 

(e) Form  of  Motion,  Response,  Reply,  and  Other  Documents.  A  motion  for 
transfer, response, reply, or other document addressed to the MDL Panel must conform to 
the requirements of Rule 9.4 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure. Without leave of 
the  MDL  Panel,  the  following  must  not  exceed  20  pages:  the  portions  of  a  motion  to 

Page 23 

transfer  required  by  subparagraphs  (a)(1)-(2);  a  response;  and  a  reply.  The  MDL  Panel 
may request additional briefing from any party. 
 

(f) Filing. A motion, request, response, reply, or other document addressed to the 
MDL Panel must be filed with the MDL Panel Clerk. The MDL Panel Clerk may require 
that all documents also be transmitted to the clerk electronically. In addition, a party must 
send  a  copy  of  the  motion,  response,  reply,  or  other  document  to  each  member  of  the 
MDL Panel. 
 

(g) Filing Fees. The MDL Panel Clerk may set  reasonable fees approved by the 

Supreme Court of Texas for filing and other services provided by the clerk. 
 

(h) Service. A  party must serve a motion,  response,  reply, or other  document  on 
all  parties  in  related  cases  in  which  transfer  is  sought.  The  MDL  Panel  Clerk  may 
designate a party or parties to serve a request for transfer on all other parties. Service is 
governed by Rule 9.5 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure. 
 

(i) Notice to Trial Court. A party must file in the trial court a notice -- in the form 
prescribed by the MDL Panel -- that a motion for transfer has been filed. The MDL Panel 
Clerk must cause such notice to be filed when a request for transfer by a judge has been 
filed. 
 

(j) Evidence.  The  MDL  Panel  will  accept  as  true  facts  stated  in  a  motion, 
response, or reply unless another party contradicts them. A party may file evidence with 
the  MDL  Panel  Clerk  only  with  leave  of  the  MDL  Panel.  The  MDL  Panel  may  order 
parties to submit evidence by affidavit or deposition and to file documents, discovery, or 
stipulations from related cases. 
 

(k) Hearing.  The  MDL  Panel  may  decide  any  matter  on  written  submission  or 
after  an  oral  hearing  before  one  or  more  of  its  members  at  a  time  and  place  of  its 
choosing. Notice of the date of submission or the time and place of oral hearing must be 
given to all parties in all related cases. 
 

(l) Decision.  The  MDL  Panel  may  order  transfer  if  three  members  concur  in  a 
written  order  finding  that  related  cases  involve  one  or  more  common  questions  of  fact, 
and that transfer to a specified district court will be for the convenience of the parties and 
witnesses and will promote the just and efficient conduct of the related cases. 
 

(m) Orders  Signed  by  Chair  or  Clerk;  Members  Identified.  Every  order  of  the 
MDL  Panel  must  be  signed  by  either  the  chair  or  by  the  MDL  Panel  Clerk,  and  must 
identify the members of the MDL Panel who concurred in the ruling. 
 

(n) Notice of Actions by  MDL Panel. The MDL Panel Clerk must give notice to 
all parties in all related cases of all actions of the MDL Panel, including orders to show 
cause, settings of submissions and oral arguments, and decisions. The MDL Panel Clerk 

 

Page 24 

may direct a party or parties to give such notice. The clerk may determine the manner in 
which notice is to be given, including that notice should be given only by email or fax. 
 

(o) Retransfer. On its own initiative, on a party's motion, or at the request of the 
pretrial  court,  the  MDL  Panel  may  order  cases  transferred  from  one  pretrial  court  to 
another  pretrial  court  when  the  pretrial  judge  has  died,  resigned,  been  replaced  at  an 
election,  requested  retransfer,  recused,  or  been  disqualified,  or  in  other  circumstances 
when retransfer will promote the just and efficient conduct of the cases. 

3.4 Effect on the Trial Court of the Filing of a Motion for Transfer. 

(a) No  Automatic  Stay.  The  filing  of  a  motion  under  this  rule  does  not  limit  the 

jurisdiction of the trial court or suspend proceedings or orders in that court. 
 

(b) Stay of Proceedings. The trial court or the MDL Panel may stay all or part of 

any trial court proceedings until a ruling by the MDL Panel. 

3.5 Transfer to a Pretrial Court. 

(a) Transfer  Effective  upon  Notice.  A  case  is  deemed  transferred  from  the  trial 
court  to  the  pretrial  court  when  a  notice  of  transfer  is  filed  with  the  trial  court  and  the 
pretrial court. The notice must: 
 

(1) list  all  parties  who  have  appeared  and  remain  in  the  case,  and  the 
names, addresses, phone numbers, and bar numbers of their attorneys or, if a party 
is pro se, the party's name, address, and phone number; 

(2) list those parties who have not yet appeared in the case; and 

(3) attach a copy of the MDL transfer order. 

(b) No Further Action in Trial Court. After notice of transfer is filed in the trial 
court, the trial court must take no further action in the case except for good cause stated 
in the order in which such action is taken and after conferring with the pretrial court. But 
service of any process already issued by the trial court may be completed and the return 
filed in the pretrial court. 
 

(c) Transfer of Files; Master File and New Files in the Pretrial Court. If the trial 
court and pretrial court are in the same county, the trial court must transfer the case file to 
the pretrial court in accordance with local rules governing the courts of that county. If the 
trial court and pretrial court are not in the same county, the trial court clerk must transmit 
the case file to the pretrial court clerk. The pretrial court clerk, after consultation with the 
judge of the pretrial court, must establish a master file and open new files for each case 
transferred  using  the  information  provided  in  the  notice  of  transfer.  The  pretrial  court 
may direct the manner in which pretrial documents are filed, including electronic filing. 
 

  1

Page 25 

(d) Filing  Fees  and  Costs.  Unless  the  MDL  Panel  assesses  costs  otherwise,  the 
party moving for transfer must pay the cost of refiling the transferred cases in the pretrial 
court, including filing fees and other reasonable costs. 
 

(e) Transfer  of  Tag-along  Cases.  A  tag-along  case  is  deemed  transferred  to  the 
pretrial court when a notice of transfer -- in the form described in Rule 13.5(a) -- is filed 
in both the trial court and the pretrial court. Within 30 days after service of the notice, a 
party to the case or to any of the related cases already transferred to the pretrial court may 
move the pretrial court to remand the case to the trial court on the ground that it is not a 
tag-along case. If the motion to remand is granted, the case must be returned to the trial 
court,  and  costs  including  attorney  fees  may  be  assessed  by  the  pretrial  court  in  its 
remand  order.  The  order  of  the  pretrial  court  may  be  appealed  to  the  MDL  Panel  by  a 
motion for rehearing filed with the MDL Panel Clerk. 

3.6 Proceedings in Pretrial Court. 

(a) Judges Who May Preside. The MDL Panel may assign as judge of the pretrial 
court any active district judge, or any former or retired district or appellate judge who is 
approved by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Texas. An assignment under this 
rule  is  not  subject  to  objection  under  chapter  74  of  the  Government  Code.  The  judge 
assigned  as  judge  of  the  pretrial  court  has  exclusive  jurisdiction  over  each  related  case 
transferred  pursuant  to  this  rule  unless  a  case  is  retransferred  by  the  MDL  Panel  or  is 
finally resolved or remanded to the trial court for trial. 
 

(b) Authority of  Pretrial  Court. The pretrial court has the authority to decide, in 
place  of  the  trial  court,  all  pretrial  matters  in  all  related  cases  transferred  to  the  court. 
Those  matters  include,  for  example,  jurisdiction,  joinder,  venue,  discovery,  trial 
preparation  (such  as  motions  to  strike  expert  witnesses,  preadmission  of  exhibits,  and 
motions in limine), mediation, and disposition by means other than conventional trial on 
the  merits  (such  as  default  judgment,  summary  judgment,  and  settlement).  The  pretrial 
court may set aside or modify any pretrial ruling made by the trial court before transfer 
over which the trial court's plenary power would not have expired had the case not been 
transferred. 
 

(c) Case Management. The pretrial court should apply sound judicial management 
methods early, continuously, and actively, based on its knowledge of each individual case 
and  the  entire  litigation,  in  order  to  set  fair  and  firm  time  limits  tailored  to  ensure  the 
expeditious resolution of each case and the just and efficient conduct of the litigation as a 
whole. After a case is transferred, the pretrial court should, at the earliest practical date, 
conduct a hearing and enter a case management order. The pretrial court should consider 
at  the  hearing,  and  its  order  should  address,  all  matters  pertinent  to  the  conduct  of  the 
litigation, including: 
 

(1) settling the pleadings; 

  1

 

 

 

Page 26 

(2) determining  whether  severance,  consolidation,  or  coordination  with 
other actions is desirable and whether identification of separable triable portions 
of the case is desirable; 

(3) scheduling preliminary motions; 

(4) scheduling  discovery  proceedings  and  setting  appropriate  limitations 

on discovery, including the establishment and timing of discovery procedures; 

(5) issuing protective orders; 

(6) scheduling alternative dispute resolution conferences; 

(7) appointing organizing or liaison counsel; 

8) scheduling dispositive motions; 

  (

(9) providing for an exchange of documents, including adopting a uniform 
numbering  system  for  documents,  establishing  a  document  depository,  and 
determining  whether  electronic  service  of  discovery  materials  and  pleadings  is 
warranted; 

(10) determining 
teleconferencing is appropriate; 

if 

the  use  of 

technology,  videoconferencing,  or 

(11) considering  such  other  matters  the  court  or  the  parties  deem 

appropriate for the just and efficient resolution of the cases; and 

(12) scheduling further conferences as necessary. 

(d) Trial Settings. The pretrial court, in conjunction with the trial court, may set a 
transferred  case  for  trial  at  such  a  time  and  on  such  a  date  as  will  promote  the 
convenience  of  the  parties  and  witnesses  and  the  just  and  efficient  disposition  of  all 
related proceedings. The pretrial court must confer, or order the parties to confer, with the 
trial  court  regarding  potential  trial  settings  or  other  matters  regarding  remand.  The  trial 
court must cooperate reasonably with the pretrial court, and the pretrial court must defer 
appropriately to the trial court's docket. The trial court must not continue or postpone a 
trial setting without the concurrence of the pretrial court. 

3.7 Remand to Trial Court. 

(a) No Remand if Final Disposition by Pretrial Court. A case in which the pretrial 
court  has  rendered  a  final  and  appealable  judgment  will  not  be  remanded  to  the  trial 
court. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  1

 

 

Page 27 

(b) Remand.  The  pretrial  court  may  order  remand  of  one  or  more  cases,  or 
separable  triable  portions  of  cases,  when  pretrial  proceedings  have  been  completed  to 
such a degree that the purposes of the transfer have been fulfilled or no longer apply. 
 

(c) Transfer of Files. When a case is remanded to the trial court, the clerk of the 
pretrial  court  will  send  the  case  file  to  the  trial  court  without  retaining  a  copy  unless 
otherwise ordered. The parties may file in the remanded case copies of any pleadings or 
orders from the pretrial court's master file. The clerk of the trial court will reopen the trial 
court file under the cause number of the trial court, without a new filing fee. 

3.8 Pretrial Court Orders Binding in the Trial Court After Remand. 

(a) Generally. The trial court should recognize that to alter a pretrial court order 
without  a  compelling  justification  would  frustrate  the  purpose  of  consolidated  and 
coordinated  pretrial  proceedings.  The  pretrial  court  should  recognize  that  its  rulings 
should  not  unwisely  restrict  a  trial  court  from  responding  to  circumstances  that  arise 
following remand. 
 

(b) Concurrence  of  the  Pretrial  Court  Required  to  Change  Its  Orders.  Without 
the written concurrence of the pretrial court, the trial court cannot, over objection, vacate, 
set aside, or modify pretrial court orders, including orders related to summary judgment, 
jurisdiction,  venue,  joinder,  special  exceptions,  discovery,  sanctions  related  to  pretrial 
proceedings, privileges, the admissibility of expert testimony, and scheduling. 
 

(c) Exceptions.  The  trial  court  need  not  obtain  the  written  concurrence  of  the 
pretrial  court  to  vacate,  set  aside,  or  modify  pretrial  court  orders  regarding  the 
admissibility of evidence at trial (other than expert evidence) when necessary because of 
changed  circumstances,  to  correct  an  error  of  law,  or  to  prevent  manifest  injustice.  But 
the trial court must support its action with specific findings and conclusions in a written 
order or stated on the record. 
 

(d) Unavailability of Pretrial Court. If the pretrial court is unavailable to rule, for 

whatever reason, the concurrence of the MDL Panel Chair must be obtained. 

3.9 Review. 

(a) MDL Panel Decision. An order of the MDL Panel, including one granting or 
denying a motion for transfer, may be reviewed only by the Supreme Court in an original 
proceeding. 
 

(b) Orders  by  the  Trial  Court  and  Pretrial  Court.  An  order  or  judgment  of  the 
trial court or pretrial court may be reviewed by the appellate court that regularly reviews 
orders of the court in which the case is pending at the time review is sought, irrespective 
of whether that court issued the order or judgment to be reviewed. A case involving such 
review  may  not  be  transferred  for  purposes  of  docket  equalization  among  appellate 
courts. 

  1

Page 28 

(c) Review  Expedited.  An  appellate  court  must  expedite  review  of  an  order  or 

judgment in a case pending in a pretrial court. 
 

Comment - 2005 

ubsection (b) is amended and subsection (c) is added to clarify the handling of appeals 
by  appellate  courts.    Subsection  (b)  forbids  transfer  for  docket  equalization  but  not  for 
other purposes that might arise.  Subsection (c) does not require that an appeal from an 
order or judgment of a case pending in a pretrial court be treated as an accelerated appeal 
under the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure if it would  otherwise  not  be  accelerated.  
Rather, subsection (c) requires expedited consideration by the appellate court regardless 
of whether review is sought by an appeal that is or is not accelerated, or by mandamus. 

3.10 MDL  Panel  Rules.  The  MDL  Panel  will  operate  at  the  direction  of  its  Chair  in 
accordance  with  rules  prescribed  by  the  panel  and  approved  by  the  Supreme  Court  of 
Texas. 

3.11 Civil Actions Filed Before September 1, 2003, Involving Claims for Asbestos- 
and Silica-Related Injuries. 
 

(a) Applicability. To the extent permitted by chapter 90 of the Texas Civil Practice 
and Remedies Code, Rule 13.11 applies to civil actions filed before September 1, 2003, 
that involve claims for asbestos- or silica-related injuries. 
 

(b) Statutory  Reference;  Definitions.  Statutory  references  in  Rule  13.11  are  to 
chapter 90 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. “Claimant” has the meaning 
assigned in section 90.001(6). “Report” has the meaning assigned in section 90.001(24). 
 

(c) Notice to Transfer Under Section 90.011(b). A notice of transfer under section 

90.010(b) must be filed in the trial court and the pretrial court and must: 
 

(1) be titled “Notice of Transfer Under Section 90.010(b)”; 

(2) list  all  parties  who  have  appeared  and  remain  in  the  case,  and  the 
names, addresses, phone numbers, and bar numbers of their attorneys or, if a party 
is pro se, the party's name, address and phone number; 

(3) state the name of each claimant transferred; 

(4) attach to the  notice filed in  the  pretrial court a copy of the claimant's 

live petition; and 

(5) if filed by a defendant, contain a certificate stating that the filing party 
conferred, or at least made a reasonable attempt to confer, with opposing counsel 

Page 29 

 

  S

about whether the notice of transfer is appropriate as to each individual claimant 
transferred. 

(d) Effect on Pending Motion for Severance. If, when a notice of transfer is filed 
in the trial court, a motion for severance has been filed but the trial court has not ruled, 
the trial court must rule on the motion within 14 days of the date the notice of transfer is 
filed, or the motion is deemed granted by operation of law. 
 

(e) When Transfer Effective. A case is deemed transferred from the trial court to 
the pretrial court when a notice of transfer is filed with the trial court unless a motion for 
severance  is  pending.  If  a  motion  for  severance  is  pending  when  a  notice  of  transfer  is 
filed  with  the  trial  court,  a  case  is  deemed  transferred  when  the  trial  court  rules  on  the 
motion or the motion is deemed granted by operation of law. 
 

(f) Further  Action  in  Trial  Court  Limited.  After  a  notice  of  transfer  is  filed,  the 

trial court must take no further action in the case except: 
 

(1) to rule on a motion for severance pending when the notice of transfer 

was filed, or 

g) Severed Case File. If a claim is severed from a case that includes one or more 
claimants covered by section 90.010(a), the file for the severed claims in the trial 
court  should  be  numerically  linked  to  the  original  case  file  and  should  contain 
only  the  live  petition  containing  the  severed  claim.  The  severed  case  file  is 
deemed  to  include  all  papers  in  the  original  case  file.  The  pretrial  court  may 
require a different procedure in the interests of justice and efficiency. 

  (

(2) for  good  cause  stated  in  the  order  in  which  such  action  is  taken  and 

after conferring with the pretrial court. 

  
But  service  of  any  process  already  issued  by  the  trial  court  may  be  completed  and  the 
return filed in the pretrial court. 

(h) Transfer of Files. The pretrial court may order the trial court clerk to transfer a 
case  file  to  the  pretrial  court.  A  case  file  must  not  be  transferred  to  the  pretrial  court 
except as ordered by that court. 
 

(i) Filing Fees and Costs. A defendant who files a notice of transfer must pay the 
cost  of  filing  the  case  in  the  pretrial  court,  including  filing  fees  and  other  reasonable 
costs. If the pretrial court remands the case to the trial court, the pretrial court may order 
that  costs  be  allocated  between  the  parties  in  a  way  that  encourages  just  and  efficient 
compliance with this rule, and may award appropriate and reasonable attorney fees. 
 

Comments - 2005

1.    Rule  13.11  is  added  to  provide  procedures  for  cases  covered  by  chapter  90  of  the 
Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, enacted effective September 1, 2005. 

.  The rule does not require a statement in the notice of transfer that no report has been 
served under chapter  90,  or that  a report has been served but does not comply with the 
provisions of that statute.  The omission of such a requirement in the notice of transfer is 
not intended to limit the pretrial court's authority under Rule 166 of the Texas Rules of 
Civil  Procedure  to  employ  appropriate  procedures  to  ascertain  a  party's  position  on  the 
issue. 

.  It is anticipated that the party filing a notice of transfer will usually be a defendant, 
and that the party filing a motion for severance will usually be a claimant.  Ordinarily, a 
party  filing  the  notice  of  transfer  is  responsible  for  filing  fees  and  costs  in  the  pretrial 
court,  although  there  may  be  exceptions.    See  Rule  13.5(d).    Also,  a  party  who 
successfully  moves  to  sever  a  claim  into  a  separate  proceeding  in  the  trial  court  is 
customarily responsible for filing fees and costs, although severance is “on such terms as 
are just”, Tex. R. Civ. P. 41, and again, there may be exceptions.  The intent of this rule is 
that  severance  and  transfer  procedures  minimize  costs  and  burdens  on  parties  and  the 
courts. 

.  A pretrial court has discretion under Rule  13.11(g)-(i)  to order the maintenance and 
transfer of physical case files and to allocate costs and fees so as to minimize costs and 
burdens on parties and the courts. 

ule 14.  Special Three-Judge District Court 

4.1  Applicability 

his rule applies to cases filed in a district court in this state in which the state or a state 

officer or agency is a defendant in a claim that: 

challenges the finances or operations of this state’s public school system; or  

involves the apportionment of districts for the house of representatives, the senate, 
the  State  Board  of  Education,  or  the  United  States  Congress,  or  state  judicial 
districts. 

4.2  Procedure for Initiating the Creation of a Special Three-Judge District Court 

The  attorney  general  may  petition  the  Chief  Justice  to  convene  a  special  three-
judge  district  court  in  any  case  to  which  this  rule  applies.  The  petition  must  be 
submitted to the Supreme Court clerk for presentation to the Chief Justice. A copy 
must be filed in the district court in which the case is pending and served on all 
parties to the case.  
 
The petition must:

list  all  parties  and  counsel  and  complete  contact  information  for  all 
counsel; 

state the cause number and style of the case, the district court in which it is 
pending, and the name of the judge to whom it is assigned;

Procedure 9.5; and 

 

include as appendices the live pleadings on file and a copy of the district 
court’s docket sheet for the case. 
 

(c) 

Any party may submit a response to the petition within seven days of the date that 
the petition is filed in the district court. The Chief Justice may shorten the time for 
submitting a response. 

d) 

The  filing  of  a  petition under  this  rule  stays  all  proceedings  in  the  district  court 
until the Chief Justice acts on the petition. 

4.3  Action on Petition; Composition of the Special Three-Judge District Court  

a)  

If a petition establishes the applicability of this rule, the Chief Justice will grant 
the petition, order the creation of a special three-judge district court, and appoint 
three persons to serve on the court. 

b)  

The special three-judge district court will be composed of: 

the  district  judge  of  the  judicial  district  to  which  the  original  case  was 
assigned; 

one district  judge  of a  judicial district other than a judicial district in the 
same  county  as  the  judicial  district  to  which  the  original  case  was 
assigned; and  

different from the district in which the original case was assigned;

different  from  the  district  in  which  the  district  judge  appointed 
under (b)(2) sits. 

c) 

The  Chief  Justice  will  designate  the  presiding  judge  of  the  special  three-judge 
district court. 

d)   A  judge  or  justice  appointed  under  (b)(2)  or  (3)  must  have  been  elected  to  that 

office and may not be serving an appointed term of office. 

A special three-judge district court convened under this rule must conduct the trial 
and  all  hearings  in  the  district  in  which  the  case  was  filed  and  may  use  the 
courtroom,  other  facilities,  and  administrative  support  of  the  original  district 
court.  

Except  as  provided  by  this  rule  or  Chapter  22A,  Government  Code,  the  Texas 
Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  and  all  other  statutes  and  rules  applicable  to  civil 
litigation  in  a  district  court  in  this  state  apply  to  proceedings  before  a  special 
three-judge district court.

4.5  Actions by Judge or Justice Serving on a Special Three-Judge District Court 

a)  With  the  unanimous  consent  of  the  three  judges  sitting  on  a  special  three-judge 

district court, a judge or justice of the court may:  

4.4  Location of Special Three-Judge District Court; Governing Rules 

1) 

independently conduct pretrial proceedings; and  

2)  

sign interlocutory orders before trial.  

  (

  (

b)   A  judge  or  justice  of  a  special  three-judge  district  court  may  not  independently 
order a temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, or an order that finally 
disposes of a claim before the court.  

c)   Any  independent  action  taken  by  one  judge  or  justice  of  a  special  three-judge 
district  court  related  to  a  claim  before  the  court  may  be  reviewed  by  the  entire 
court at any time before final judgment. 

4.6  Transfer and Consolidation of Related Cases 

a) 

“Related case” means any case in which the state or a state officer or agency is a 
defendant that arises from the same nucleus of operative facts as the case before a 
special three-judge district court, regardless of the legal claims or causes of action

On  the  motion  of  any  party  to  a  case  assigned  to  a  special  three-judge  district 
court,  the  special  three-judge  district  court  must  transfer  a  related  case  to  itself 
and consolidate the related case with the case before the court. The special three-
judge district court may transfer a related case without the consent of the parties 
to the related case or of the court in which the related case is pending. 

The motion must be in writing and include:   

the cause number, style, court, and name of the judge of the court in which 
the related case is pending; 

a  list  of  parties  and  counsel  in  the  related  case  and  complete  contact 
information for all counsel;   

a  demonstration  that  the  related  case  arises  from  the  same  nucleus  of 
operative facts as the case before the special three-judge district court; 

the live pleadings on file in the related case; and 
 
a certificate of service on all parties to the case pending before the special 
three-judge district court and to the related case.

4.7  Appeals and Original Proceedings 

n appeal  from  an appealable interlocutory order or  from  a  final judgment of  a special 
three-judge  district  court  is  to  the  Supreme  Court  under  Texas  Rule  of  Appellate

Court under Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 52. 

ule  15.    Appeals  from  Trial  Courts  in  Counties  Assigned  to  Multiple  Appellate 

Districts.  

5.1  Applicability.  This rule applies to appeals from an order or judgment issued by a 
trial court in a county assigned by law to more than one court of appeals district 
unless  assignment  of  such  appeals  is  governed  by  statute.    This  rule  does  not 
apply  to  appeals  to  the  Courts  of  Appeals  for  the  First  and  Fourteenth  Districts 
from  trial  courts  in  counties  in  those  districts,  as  assignment  of  such  appeals  is 
governed by statute.

15.2  When Consolidation Required.  If notices of appeal filed by two or more parties 
from  a  single  judgment  or  order  designate  different  courts  of  appeals  that  have 
jurisdiction  of  the  appeal  because  the  county  in  which  the  trial  court  sits  is 
assigned to more than one appellate district, the appeals must be consolidated in 
one of the courts of appeals.  

5.3  Consolidation by Agreement; Notice to Courts of Appeals.   

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

Appealing  Parties  to  Confer  Regarding  Consolidation.    When  any 
appealing  party  learns  that  two  or  more  parties  have  properly  designated 
different  courts  of  appeals,  that  party  must  promptly  confer  with  lead 
counsel  for  all  other  appealing  parties  (if  represented,  otherwise  counsel 
must  confer  with  the  pro  se  party)  and  determine  if  all  appealing  parties 
will agree to consolidate the appeals in one of the courts of appeals. 

Time  to  Provide  Notice.    No  later  than  30  days  —  20  days  in  an 
accelerated appeal — after the filing date of the first-filed notice of appeal 
described  in  paragraph  (a),  the  parties  must  submit  to  the  clerks  of  both 
courts of appeals written notice either of the appealing parties’ agreement 
to  consolidate  the  appeals  or  of  the  appealing  parties’  inability  to  reach 
agreement regarding consolidation. 

Contents of Notice.  The notice must identify each appealing party and the 
party’s counsel (if represented, or state that the party is pro se), and must 
either identify the  court  of appeals designated by agreement or state that 
the appealing parties were unable to agree to  consolidate all appeals in a 
particular court.  The notice must also contain a certificate stating that the 
filing  parties  conferred,  or  made  a  reasonable  attempt  to  confer,  with  all 
other  appealing  parties  regarding  consolidation  of  the  appeals.    If  the 
notice states that all appealing parties have agreed to consolidation, it must 
identify every party or party’s attorney who agreed to the consolidation.  

Consolidation  by  Agreement  of  All  Appealing  Parties.    If  the  clerks  of 
both courts of appeals receive notice that all appealing parties have agreed 
to  consolidation,  the  chief  justices  of  both  courts  will  request  the  Chief 
Justice of the Supreme Court to transfer all pending appeals in the case to 
the court of appeals designated by the parties’ agreement. 

5.4  Consolidation When Appealing Parties Unable to Agree. 

(a) 

Clerks of Courts of Appeals to Jointly Notify Trial Court Clerk. 

(1) 

If  both  courts  of  appeals  receive  notice  of  the  appealing  parties’ 
inability to reach agreement regarding consolidation, the clerks of 
both appellate courts must jointly notify the clerk of the trial court 
in writing of that fact.

(2) 

If the period described in Rule 15.3(b) has passed and the clerks of 
the  two  courts  of  appeals  have  not  received  any  notice  from  the 
appealing parties regarding consolidation, the chief justices of the 
two  courts  of  appeals  shall  confer  and  instruct  the  clerks  of  their 
respective  courts  to  jointly  notify  the  clerk  of  the  trial  court  in 
writing that the appealing parties failed to timely submit notice of 
agreement  regarding  consolidation,  and  instruct  the  clerk  to 
perform the selection process in Rule 15.4(b). 

(b) 

Consolidation  by  Trial  Court  Clerk.    After  the  trial  court  clerk  receives 
notice  from  the  clerks  of  the  courts  of  appeals  regarding  either  the 
appealing parties’ inability to reach agreement as to consolidation or their 
failure  to  timely  submit  notice  of  agreement,  the  clerk  shall  write  the 
numbers of the two courts of appeals on identical slips of paper and place 
the  slips  in  a  container  folded  in  half  or  otherwise  arranged  so  that  the 
numbers  are  completely  hidden  from  view.    The  trial  court  clerk  shall 
draw a number from the container at random, in a public place, and shall 
assign  the  case  to  the  court  of  appeals  for  the  corresponding  number 
drawn. 

5.5  All Appeals From Same Judgment or Order to be Consolidated Together.   

When  appeals  to  multiple  courts  of  appeals  have  been  consolidated  pursuant  to 
this rule,  other parties’  appeals from the  same  judgment  or order  underlying  the 
consolidated appeals must be assigned to the same court of appeals in which the 
previous appeals were consolidated.

JCAR  Clerk  in  writing  upon  approval  or  denial  of  a  request  for  additional 
resources. On receipt of such notice, the JCAR Clerk must transmit a copy to the 
affected trial court.

mandated by sections 74.252-74.257 of the Government Code, enacted effective January 
1,  2012.    The  procedures  in  Rule  16  are  not  exclusive;  judges  may  still  be  assigned  as 
provided for in sections 74.052-74.062 of the Government Code.
