Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)8/5/2022  4:53:31PM222 Second Court of Appeals District, Fort Worth88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's StatementTexas’ intermediate appellate courts have weathered serious challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 ransomware attack, but these challenges will continue into the foreseeable future. The courts have not been fully funded since 2015 yet have dutifully risen to the task as can be seen by the dramatic decline in the number of cases pending in the courts of appeals. Respectfully, additional funding is now necessary to ensure the efficient administration of justice going forward.The core function of Texas intermediate appellate courts is to process, review, and decide by written opinion appeals from trial courts in civil and criminal cases. Population growth across the State and the magnitude of annual case filings, in concert with an ever-increasing number of case types requiring expedited review, make clear that the courts of appeals need sufficient resources to manage their busy dockets and provide the high quality of justice to which the citizens of Texas are entitled. Although case filings decreased in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic, filings are returning to pre-pandemic levels as of June 2022 and are expected to continue to increase beyond pre-pandemic levels as trial courts resume full operations and clear their backlogs. The Annual Statistical Report for 2021 reported that family violence cases increased at the highest rate over the past five years. We anticipate a rise in other types of litigation as well that will result in a surge of appeals over the next biennium. The courts of appeals, collectively, began in the 79th and 80th Legislative Sessions to work toward a zero-based budget model referred to as Similar Funding for Same-Sized Courts. This budget model quantified the funding required to meet the personnel and operational needs of the courts, thus enabling the courts to accomplish their core function and meet their performance measures. The Similar Funding for Same-Sized Courts initiative was fully funded in 2015, and the courts have been operating under this zero-based budget model since that time. Since the development of the budget model in approximately 2005, the demands of the core function of the courts have required higher-skilled and higher-salary positions. The prior model used salary classification levels for attorneys and staff that are now outdated. Additionally, operating costs for necessary resources such as Westlaw/LexisNexis and other administrative needs have increased dramatically. Further, considering recent attacks on judges and an increase in mass shootings, more funds are needed to provide adequate security at the courts.Prior to the 87th Legislative Session, in early 2020, the Council of Chiefs revised the data in the budget model to reflect the increased funding needed to optimally operate the fourteen courts. However, in preparing for the impending session, the Council was keenly aware that the need for state funds to address the pandemic was the highest priority. Because there were many uncertainties regarding the state of the economy and it was anticipated state revenues would be limited, agencies were asked to reduce budgets by 5%. The Council appreciated and respected the position of the state and, therefore, did not seek additional funding at that time. While the Council greatly appreciates that budgets of the courts of appeals in the last biennium were not cut, funding of the updated budget model is, nonetheless, now necessary. Accordingly, the budget model data has been further updated to reflect current operating needs.Since 1983, the work of the intermediate courts of appeals has been accomplished by 80 justices statewide. In that time, the population of Texas has nearly doubled. A key component to handling the ever-increasing workload without additional justices has been the employment of a highly skilled and trained professional workforce, including appellate lawyers and clerical staff, who assist the justices in processing complex cases, researching and drafting orders and opinions, disposing of voluminous motions, and managing accelerated and emergency matters. Appellate work requires specialized knowledge and significant experience, and the courts constantly face competition from higher-paying private practice and government legal jobs for skilled attorneys and staff. Specialized technological skills are also necessary to understand and operate the complex case management system currently used by the courts. Transitioning to a new case management system in the next biennium will also require special skills. Hiring and retaining qualified support staff is critical to the courts’ ability to manage their dockets and efficiently resolve the cases before them.Funding for all fourteen courts of appeals comprises merely 0.035% of the State budget as a whole. Yet, on average, 96.5% of each appellate court’s budget is dedicated to  Page 1 of 31Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)8/5/2022  4:53:31PM222 Second Court of Appeals District, Fort Worth88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's Statementsalaries and benefits. Without additional funding, appellate courts will be unable to attract and retain the highly trained and skilled support staff with the specialized knowledge and relevant experience critical to the courts’ function. Without sufficient qualified staff, courts cannot comply with Legislative mandates to give accelerated and preferential treatment to certain appeals, such as parental-termination and juvenile-certification appeals under the Family Code, mental-health appeals under the Health and Safety Code, and interlocutory appeals under the Civil Practice and Remedies Code.All fourteen courts of appeals continue to expend resources to recover from the 2020 ransomware attack on the courts’ computer systems. The loss of data overall was substantial and continues to require resources to reconstitute work that could not be recovered. And while all State agencies experienced the negative effects of COVID-19, the combined effects of the ransomware attack plus COVID-19 created a unique hardship for the appellate courts.EXCEPTIONAL ITEM #1: Increase the general revenue limit to meet the updated budget modelThe updated budget model reflects increased funding to permit the courts to attract and retain experienced lawyers and support staff with the requisite knowledge and skills to assist the courts in meeting their performance measures and fulfilling the core function of timely processing and disposing of appeals. Without an increase in funding, appellate courts will lose talented personnel to higher-paying private jobs. This loss of key personnel will detrimentally affect performance standards, including (1) a reduction in overall dispositions of appeals, preventing the courts from clearing older cases and reaching the disposition target of 100% of new appeals filed in the biennium, and (2) an increase in the time from filing until disposition for those appeals which remain pending. Any unnecessary delay will be particularly devastating to the State by creating significant adverse consequences for the businesses, families, and children in Texas that are awaiting justice through the resolution of their disputes. Note, the updated budget model does not include an adjustment for the impact of inflation.EXCEPTIONAL ITEM #2: Judiciary-wide inflation reliefAttorneys and staff of the courts of appeals have been impacted in many ways by increasing costs due to inflation. The impact has been devastating for many because the State has not given them a meaningful raise in a significant period of time. Their buying power for goods and services has diminished and, at some courts, has resulted in attrition by those seeking higher-paying jobs. If salaries are not increased, the courts risk losing more personnel that will be costly to replace. Training takes time and will impact the ability of the courts to meet the current and expected demands as we navigate the post-pandemic surge.On May 4, 2022, the Council of Chiefs submitted written testimony to the Senate Committee on Finance comprised of testimonials from court personnel describing personal experiences with rising costs. The Council asks for consideration of this testimony.The courts of appeals join in the judiciary-wide inflation relief for non-judicial employees sought by Article IV courts and agencies. Respectfully, a ten percent (10%) increase on the budget model salaries is sought to help absorb the impact of inflation. To maintain the Similar Funding for Same-Sized Courts model that has worked exceptionally well for years, the requested percentage must be based on the budget model salaries. This exceptional item is not duplicative of exceptional item 1, which does not include an adjustment for the inflation that is expected to persist for some time to come.RIDER REQUESTS:The courts of appeals also request the following with regard to the across-the-board riders found in Article IV (p. IV-38): Page 2 of 32Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)8/5/2022  4:53:31PM222 Second Court of Appeals District, Fort Worth88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's Statement1.Retain Article IV rider, Sec. 3, Appellate Court Exemptions2.Retain Article IV rider, Sec. 5, Interagency Contracts for Assigned Judges for Appellate Courts3.Retain Article IV rider, Sec. 6, Appellate Court Transfer AuthorityHistorically, the Legislature has granted the courts exemption from certain limitations in the General Appropriations Act. They have also granted the courts the authority to carry over unexpended budget balances between years within the biennium. The flexibility afforded by these measures enhances the courts’ management ability, and we seek continuation of these budget features.ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS OF SUPPORT:In order for the courts of appeals to function efficiently, it is vital that the Office of Court Administration (OCA) be adequately funded.  The courts of appeals rely on many of the services provided by OCA and, therefore, the courts of appeals fully support the exceptional items the OCA requests as part of its funding. More specifically, the courts of appeals strongly support the request for funding related to the acquisition of a new appellate case management system to replace the current system known as TAMES as well as a case-level data system.If the Legislature appropriates a cost-of-living increase to state employees, the courts of appeals request that all court employees be included in any such cost-of-living increase.   Finally, the courts of appeals wish to express appreciation to and support for the Judicial Compensation Commission and the Legislature’s efforts to strengthen the justice system by increasing judicial salaries to attract and retain a strong judiciary.  The courts of appeals request that the Legislature implement the Judicial Compensation Commission’s recommendations for an increase in judicial compensation.Note on Appropriated Receipts: At the direction of the LBB & Governor’s Office, this court has included appropriated receipts in the total amount of $16,000 for FY 2024 and 2025 reflecting reimbursement for copies of opinions and other court documents.  These amounts are merely an offset for additional expenses incurred by the Court and do not constitute additional funds available for general expenditures for the Court.  The amount can vary significantly from year to year. Page 3 of 33ORGANIZATIONAL CHART

The Second Court of Appeals District is composed of twelve counties: Archer, Clay, Cooke, Denton, Hood, Jack, Montague, Parker, Tarrant, Wichita, Wise, and Young. This court has intermediate appellate jurisdiction of all civil and criminal cases appealed from approximately 100 lower courts in these twelve counties. Cases include civil appeals in which the amount of the trial court's judgment exceeds $250, exclusive of costs and interest, and all criminal appeals except appeals from cases in which the death penalty has been imposed, which are appealed directly to the Court of Criminal Appeals. The Second Court of Appeals also has jurisdiction over original proceedings--such as writs of mandamus, injunction, prohibition, and habeas corpus--arising from cases in the twelve counties it serves.  The court processes, reviews, and decides each case filed in the court by written opinion or order.  This process requires a highly skilled and trained professional workforce, including appellate lawyers and clerical staff, who assist the justices of the court in disposing of cases and researching and writing opinions.The Second Court of Appeals District's population and caseload have more than doubled since 1983, when the court’s size was increased to its current number of 7 justices.  In 1983, the population in our district was 1.4 million and has now grown to approximately 3.6 million.  In the same time period, the court’s workload has increased from 491 cases filed in 1983 to over 1,000 filed in FY 2019, the last full year before the COVID-19 crisis.  Filings have steadily increased since 2020 as the State rebounds from the effects of COVID-19, and by 2023, filings are expected to exceed pre-pandemic levels. Experience has shown that after every major financial crisis in the past 20 years, the number of cases filed in the intermediate appellate courts has risen significantly. Without additional justices to handle the increased workload, the court must maintain sufficient funding to recruit and retain professional, qualified staff to handle the increases in volume of cases filed, the number of accelerated and expedited matters on the court’s docket, and the requests for access to court records from litigants, the public, and their counsel.EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS  IMPACTING STRATEGY:3.A.

Estimated and NontransferableThe 86th Legislature established current levels of judicial compensation that are fixed by statute and added Strategy A.1.2., Appellate Justice Salaries, which holds estimated and nontransferable funds that are dedicated to judicial salaries and are unable to be spent on any other category of appellate court operations.STRATEGY DESCRIPTION AND JUSTIFICATION:Judicial salaries are established by statute and cannot be increased or decreased by the court.  Salaries vary among the justices, depending on their level of judicial experience.  The court cannot predict with certainty the exact funding needs for judicial salaries in the future due to unforeseeable changes to the composition of the court that may arise as a result of elections, resignations, retirements, or deaths.

Without an increase in funding, appellate courts will lose talented personnel to higher-paying private jobs. This loss of key personnel will detrimentally affect performance standards, including (1) a reduction in overall dispositions of appeals, preventing the courts from clearing older cases and reaching the disposition target of 100% of new appeals filed in the biennium, and (2) an increase in the time from filing until disposition for those appeals that remain pending. Any unnecessary delay will create significant adverse consequences for the businesses, families, and children in Texas that are awaiting justice through the resolution of their disputes. Note, the updated budget model does not include an adjustment for the impact of inflation. 5.00 5.00FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT POSITIONS (FTE):EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS:The Second Court of Appeals District's population and caseload have more than doubled since 1983, when the court’s size was increased to its current number of 7 justices.  In 1983, the population in our district was 1.4 million and has now grown to approximately 3.6 million. In the same time period, the court’s workload has increased from 491 cases filed in 1983 to over 1,000 filed in FY 2019, the last full year before the COVID-19 crisis. Filings have steadily increased since 2020 as the State rebounds from the effects of COVID-19, and by 2023, filings are expected to exceed pre-pandemic levels.  Experience has shown that after every major financial crisis in the past 20 years, the number of cases filed in the intermediate appellate courts has risen significantly. 4.A.

Exceptional Item Request ScheduleWithout additional justices to handle the increased workload, the court must maintain sufficient funding to recruit and retain professional, qualified staff to handle the increases in volume of cases filed, the number of accelerated and expedited matters on the court’s docket, and the requests for access to court records from litigants, the public, and their counsel. At base appropriation levels in FY 2024-25, the court will be able to fully fund only 9 of its 14 staff attorney positions under the guideline budget. 5 staff attorney positions will be left unfunded, severely restricting the court’s ability to fill vacancies as staff attorneys resign from the court.  Funding for this exceptional item would allow the court to fill these vacancies and return to full staffing levels for the coming biennium.PCLS TRACKING KEY:4.A.

The impact has been devastating for many because the State has not given them a meaningful raise in a significant period of time. Their buying power for goods and services has diminished and, at some courts, has resulted inattrition by those seeking higher-paying jobs. If salaries are not increased, the courts risk losing more personnel that will be costly to replace. Training takes time and will impact the ability of the courts to meet the current and expected demands as we navigate the post-pandemic surge.On May 4, 2022, the Council of Chiefs submitted written testimony to the Senate Committee on Finance comprised of testimonials from court personnel describing personal experiences with rising costs. The Council asks for consideration of this testimony.The Second Court of Appeals (along with the other 13 courts of appeals) joins in the judiciary-wide inflation relief for non-judicial employees sought by Article IV courts and agencies. Respectfully, a ten percent (10%) increase on the budget model salaries is sought to help absorb the impact of inflation. To maintain the Similar Funding for Same-Sized Courts model that has worked exceptionally well for years, the requested percentage must be based on the budget model salaries. This exceptional item is not duplicative of exceptional item 1, which does not include an adjustment for the inflation that is expected to persist for some time to come.EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS:The lack of raises for employees, coupled with soaring inflation, has drastically affected the court's ability to attract and retain qualified staff.  In FY 2021-2022, the court experienced a 43% turnover in its staff attorney ranks, and almost all departing employees named low salaries as a significant motivating factor in their decisions to leave the court. Court job postings stay open for months at a time because low salaries render the court unable to attract qualified applicants. In addition, the court has left one deputy 4.A.

Exceptional Item Request Scheduleclerk position vacant for most of FY 2022 in an effort to retain staff through the use of those funds to increase other employees'  salaries. As a result, due in large part to extended staff attorney vacancies and frequent employee turnover, the number of cases disposed by the court in FY 2022 is the lowest it has been in at least the last ten years. A 10% salary adjustment for inflation would allow the court to increase employee retention and reduce turnover, which in turn will improve court efficiency and increase the number of appeals disposed.PCLS TRACKING KEY:4.A.

Assessment of Attainment of HUB Procurement Goals 3.5% 5.2%The Heavy Construction, Building Construction, Special Trade Construction, and Professional Services categories were not applicable to the court's operations in either FY 2020 or FY 2021 because the court did not have any strategies related to construction or any need for professional services.Applicability:Approximately 95% of the court's appropriations is expended on salaries and personnel costs.  Sole-source purchases, including highly specialized legal publications purchased directly from the publishers, comprise a large portion of the court's remaining expenditures.  Additionally, the Office of Court Administration performs most of the computer-related purchases for the court.  But overall, due to the small size of the court and the nature of its function (judicial services), the court does not make a large amount of purchases during any given fiscal year, and most of the purchases made by the court are small spot purchases using time-efficient, noncompetitive procedures.  Therefore, the opportunities for the court to make HUB purchases are limited.Factors Affecting Attainment:Whenever possible and feasible, the court's purchases are carried out through TXSmartBuy, WorkQuest, TCI, and other set-aside contractors, as required by the Comptroller.  The court makes efforts to identify HUB vendors selling through TXSmartBuy.Outreach Efforts and Mentor-Protégé Programs:C.

Historically Underutilized Business Supporting ScheduleDue to the small size of the court (37 authorized FTEs), the court is unable to dedicate full-time staffing to increasing participation of HUBs.  The court's accountant, who performs most purchasing activities for the court, makes a good-faith effort to identify and consider HUB vendors when making purchasing decisions.The court made good-faith efforts in both FY 2020 and FY 2021 to increase purchases from HUB vendors.  However, there are instances when HUB vendors' products, services, and pricing (including shipping and handling) are more costly than those of non-HUB vendors, especially for the small spot purchases that made up most of the court's expenditures on commodities and services.  Under such circumstances, the court chooses the best value as it expends taxpayer dollars.  The court will continue to make good-faith efforts to meet or exceed its HUB goals in the coming biennium.Current and Future Good-Faith Efforts:6.A.     Page 2 of 2396.H.

Constitutional or Statutory Creation and Use of Funds:

As per court order #65971, Tarrant County established an Appellate Judicial System pursuant to sections 22.201(c) and 22.2031 of the Texas 
Government Code. A fee of $5 is set for each non-indigent civil suit filed in each county court, statutory county court, probate court, or district court, 
except such fees that apply to any suit filed by a county or any suit for delinquent taxes. Management of the system is vested in the Chief Justice of 
the Second Court of Appeals, and funds received from such fees shall be used and distributed only for the purpose of assisting the Second Court of 
Appeals.

Method of Calculation and Revenue Assumptions:

Revenue assumptions are based on current year collections. The number of civil suits filed determines the actual revenue received. The above annual 
revenue is reduced by the mandatory salary supplement and payroll-related costs for each Justice, and by county-related overhead costs that must 
be paid directly from these funds. Additional overhead expenditures that exceed the amount of funds appropriated by the State, due to the 
underfunded State budget, also reduce the balance of this fund.
