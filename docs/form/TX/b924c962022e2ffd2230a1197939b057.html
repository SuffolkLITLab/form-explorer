Director Statement

The Texas Judiciary closed out Fiscal Year 2021 with more than 6.9 million filings and judges disposing of more than 6.4 million 
cases. The overall court backlog caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic was up 8 percent when comparing active pending cases 
from March 2020 versus active pending cases in August 2021.

This is my first Annual Statistical Report to oversee as the Administrative Director of the Office of Court Administration. It has 
been inspiring to see the judiciary rise to the occasion in every aspect throughout the pandemic. From leading the nation in 
online court proceedings, to innovations in keeping jury trials moving forward, and developing plans to dig out of the court 
backlog. The judiciary persevered and is stronger and more prepared to face the next challenge.

The collection of accurate court data is important now more than ever. It influences how we operate our judicial system, how 
decisions are made by lawmakers and the public perception of our courts.  The judiciary is committed to improving data 
collection and making upgrades to one day include the collection of case level data. I look forward to the day when we can 
publish a report that includes these data enhancements. In the meantime, please enjoy exploring our 2021 Annual Statistical 
Report. 

Key highlights include:

•  Civil case filings continued to decline in 2021 at most court levels due to the pandemic. The number of new civil cases 

fell by 13 percent in the county courts, by 5 percent in the justice courts, and by 2 percent in the municipal courts. In the 
district courts, new civil cases increased by 3 percent.

•  After a decline due to the pandemic, injury or damage cases involving a motor vehicle increased 15 percent in 2021 to 

an all-time high.

•  Debt cases declined by 11 percent in the district courts and by 15 percent in the county courts while they rose by 12 

percent in the justice courts to an all-time high.

•  After reaching an all-time high in 2019, new landlord/tenant cases filed in justice courts fell 28 percent in 2020 and 

another 31 percent in 2021. The number of cases filed in 2021 was the lowest since 2000. 

Estate (probate) cases grew by 19 percent in 2021.

•  After a steep decline in 2020 due to the pandemic, the number of new family law cases increased 3 percent in 2021. The 

number of post-judgment suits for modification or enforcement, however, declined by 11 percent.

•  New divorce cases and new parent-child cases not involving divorce increased from the previous year.

The number of new felony cases filed increased each year since 2014, reached an all-time high in 2019, declined in 2020 
due to the pandemic but rebounded in 2021.

The number of new misdemeanor cases had been falling since 2007 but took a steep dive in 2020 due to the pandemic 
and a significant decline in drug cases. 2021 filings were down almost 50 percent from the 2007 peak and were the 
lowest since at least 1985. 

Felony drug offenses exceeded misdemeanor drug offenses by almost 18,000 cases due to continued decline in the 
prosecution of marijuana cases as well as an overall steep decrease in filed misdemeanor cases due to the pandemic.

i

•  Over the last 5 years the only misdemeanor case types that increased were assault cases, including family violence 

assault, and first DWI offenses.

that increased in 2020 and 2021.

•  Capital murder, aggravated assault/attempted murder, family violence, and auto theft were the only felony categories 

Traffic and parking cases declined by 8 percent from the previous year, continuing a 13-year decline that was intensified 
by the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, and was the lowest number filed since 1980.

•  Non-traffic misdemeanor cases fell by 13 percent from the previous year and was the second lowest number since 1979.

Since the peak in 2007, the number of juvenile cases filed has fallen 74 percent to the lowest level since 1993.

The active pending caseload grew by 5 percent in the district courts due to lower than usual clearance rates while the 
active pending caseload in the county courts remained relatively steady. 

We hope you find the information in this report helpful.

Texas Court Structure

The current structure of the court system of Texas was established by an 1891 amendment to the Texas Constitution of 1876. 
The amendment established the Supreme Court as the highest state appellate court for civil matters, and the Court of Criminal 
Appeals as the highest state appellate court in criminal matters. The amendment also established courts of appeals that exercise 
intermediate appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases.1

District courts are the state’s trial courts of general jurisdiction. The geographical area served by each district court is established 
by the specific statute creating the court.

In addition to these state courts, the Texas Constitution provides for a county court in each county, presided over by the county 
judge. The county judge also serves as head of the county commissioners court, the governing body of the county. To aid 
the constitutional county court with its judicial functions, the Legislature has established statutory county courts, generally 
designated as county courts at law or statutory probate courts, in the more populous counties.

The Texas Constitution also authorizes not less than one nor more than 16 justices of the peace in each county. The justice courts 
generally have exclusive jurisdiction of civil matters when the amount in controversy does not exceed $200 and concurrent 
jurisdiction with the county courts when the amount in controversy exceeds $200 but does not exceed $20,000. These courts also 
have jurisdiction in misdemeanor cases where punishment upon conviction may be by fine only.

By statute, the Legislature has created municipal courts in each incorporated city in the state. These courts have original 
jurisdiction over violations of municipal ordinances and concurrent jurisdiction with the justice courts over misdemeanor state 
law violations, limited to the geographical confines of the municipality. Municipal courts also have civil jurisdiction limited to a 
few specific types of cases.

Trials in the justice courts and most municipal courts are not of record, and appeals therefrom are by new trial (“trial de novo”) to 
the county court, except in certain counties, where the appeal is to a county court at law or to a district court. When an appeal is 
by trial de novo, the case is tried again in the higher court, just as if the original trial had not occurred.

Jurisdiction of the various levels of courts is established by constitutional provision and by statute. Statutory jurisdiction is 
established by general statutes providing jurisdiction for all courts on a particular level, as well as by the statutes establishing 
individual courts. Thus, to determine the jurisdiction of a particular court, one must examine the Constitution; the general 
statutes establishing jurisdiction for that level of court; the specific statute authorizing the establishment of the particular court in 
question; the statutes creating other courts in the same county (whose jurisdictional provisions may affect the court in question); 
and the statutes dealing with specific subject matter (such as the Family Code, which requires, for example, that judges who are 
lawyers hear appeals from cases heard by non-lawyer judges in juvenile cases).

Judicial Administration

The Texas Supreme Court has constitutional responsibility for the efficient administration of the judicial system and possesses 
the authority to make rules of administration applicable to the courts.1 Under the direction of the Chief Justice, the Office of Court 
Administration aids the Supreme Court in carrying out its administrative duties by providing administrative support and technical 
assistance to all courts in the state.

The Supreme Court and the Texas Legislature also receive recommendations on long-range planning and improvements in the 
administration of justice from the Texas Judicial Council, a 22-member policy-making body composed of two appointees from 
each level of court, as well as appointees from the Governor and legislative branches of government. The Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court, Presiding Judge of the Court of Criminal Appeals, chief justices of each of the courts of appeals, and judges of 
each of the trial courts are generally responsible for the administration of their respective courts.

For the district and statutory county courts there is also a local administrative district judge in each county, as well as a local 
administrative statutory county court judge in each county that has a statutory county court. In counties with two or more district 
courts, a local administrative district judge is elected by the district judges in the county for a term not to exceed two years.2 
Similarly, in counties with two or more statutory county courts, a local administrative statutory county court judge is elected by 
the statutory county court judges for a term not to exceed two years. The local administrative judge is charged with implementing 
the local rules of administration, supervising the expeditious movement of court caseloads, and other administrative duties.3

To aid in the administration of justice in the trial courts, the state is divided into eleven administrative judicial regions. With the 
advice and consent of the Senate, the Governor appoints one of the active or retired district judges, or a retired appellate court 
judge who has district court experience residing in each region, as the presiding judge. The statutory probate court judges also 
select a presiding judge, who must be an active statutory probate court judge.

The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may convene periodic conferences of the chief justices of the courts of appeals, as well as 
periodic conferences of the eleven presiding judges to ensure the efficient administration of justice in the courts of the state.

By statute, the Supreme Court has administrative control over judicial branch agencies and issues Administrative Orders to 
include orders for appointments to judicial boards, commissions, and task forces.

Funding of the Judicial Branch

The State provides funding for salaries 
and operating costs of the Supreme 
Court, Court of Criminal Appeals, and 
intermediate appellate courts. The State 
funds a base salary for district judges 
and salary reimbursements for certain 
constitutional and statutory county 
court judges, as well as salaries, salary 
supplements, expenses of retirement, and 
other payroll-related benefits for certain 
prosecutors. The State also pays for or 
supplements some other expenses of 
the judicial branch, including juror pay, 
basic civil legal services, criminal indigent 
defense, judicial technology, and special 
prosecution units.

Most counties supplement the base salary 
of judges of the intermediate appellate 
courts and district courts. Counties pay the 
operating costs of district courts, as well as 
the salary of judges, salaries of other staff, 
and operating costs for constitutional 
county courts, county courts at law, 
and justice courts. Cities finance all costs 
related to the operation of municipal 
courts, including judges’ salaries.

In FY 2022, state appropriations for the 
Texas judicial system accounted for 
0.42 percent of all state appropriations.  
Fifty-nine percent of the financing for 
the judicial system came from General 
Revenue sources. Twenty-two percent 
came from dedicated General Revenue 
funds, such as the Fair Defense Account, 
the Statewide Electronic Filing System 
Account, and the Judicial and Court 
Personnel Training Fund, and the 
remaining amounts came from other 
special funds, including the Judicial Fund 
and federal funds.

ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES

The presiding judge of an administrative judicial region may assign a judge to handle a case or docket of an active judge in the 
region who is unable to preside (due to recusal, illness, vacation, etc.) or who needs assistance with a heavy docket or backlog. 
These “assigned judges” may be active judges of other courts in the region or may be individuals residing in the region who used 
to serve as active judges.1

During fiscal year 2021, the presiding judges made a total of 4,947 assignments within their respective regions, a decrease of 
three percent from the previous year.

Some constitutional county and justice court judges are also attorneys, though a law license is not required. More than half 
of municipal judges are attorneys, due mainly to the requirement that a judge of a municipal court of record be an attorney.1  
Municipal courts of record are generally established in the largest communities of the state and employ many judges.

The average years of experience for the judges who are attorneys is comparable to the experience of judges who must be 
attorneys.

Case Status
For more specific information about the case status categories listed below, as well as definitions of the various disposition types, 
refer  to  the  reporting  instructions  posted  at  http://www.txcourts.gov/reporting-to-oca/judicial-council-trial-court-activity-
reports.aspx. 

Cases Pending Beginning of Month–Active: The number of cases that were awaiting disposition at the beginning of the reporting 
period.

Cases Pending Beginning of Month–Inactive: The number of cases that had been classified as inactive at the beginning of the 
reporting period.

Reactivated: The number of cases that had previously been placed on inactive status, but were restored to the court’s control 
during the reporting period. Further court proceedings in these cases could be resumed during the reporting period and proceed 
toward disposition. The rules for reactivating a case are the reverse of those for placing a case on inactive status, (e.g., the lifting 
of a stay, arrest of a defendant with an outstanding warrant, etc.).

All  Other  Cases  Added  (Reopened): The  number  of  cases  in  which  a  judgment  had  previously  been  entered  but  which  were 
restored to the court’s pending caseload during the reporting period. These cases come back to the court due to the filing of a 
request to modify or enforce that existing judgment and a hearing before a judicial officer is requested to review the status of the 
case or initiate further proceedings in the case.

otal Cases on Docket: The sum of the number of new cases filed, cases appealed from lower courts, reactivated and reopened 
cases.

  T

Total Dispositions: The number of cases for which an original entry of judgment has been entered during the reporting period. 
For cases involving multiple parties/issues, the disposition is not to be reported until all parties/issues have been resolved.

Placed  on  Inactive  Status: The  number  of  cases  whose  status  was  administratively  changed  to  inactive  during  the  reporting 
period due to events beyond the court’s  control. These  cases were removed  from  court  control,  and  the court could take no 
further action until an event restored the case to the court’s active pending caseload. Examples include cases in which a warrant 
of arrest was issued, a stay was issued while a defendant undergoes temporary or extended inpatient mental health treatment, 
or a stay was issued due to bankruptcy.

Cases Pending End of Month–Active: The number of cases that were awaiting disposition at the end of the reporting period.

Cases Pending End of Month–Inactive: The number of cases that had been classified as inactive at the end of the reporting period.

New Cases Filed: The number of cases that were filed with the court for the first time during the reporting period.

CLEARANCE RATE

Clearance Rate: The number of cases disposed or placed on inactive status divided by the number of cases added to the docket 
(including reactivated cases). The clearance rate is a measure of how effectively a court is disposing the cases added to its docket. 

A clearance rate of 100 percent indicates that the court disposed of the same number of cases during the year as were added to 
the docket during the year, resulting in no changes to the court’s case backlog.

 

Formula:

Number of cases disposed + number of cases placed on inactive status 

divided by 

number of new cases filed + number of cases reactivated + cases appealed from lower courts + all other cases added

DISTRICT COURTS
Criminal Docket
A criminal case is counted as one defendant per indictment or 
information. For example, if an indictment names more than 
one defendant, there is more than one case; three defendants 
named in one indictment equals three cases. If the same 
defendant is charged in more than one indictment, even if for 
the same criminal episode, there is more than one case; the 
same person named in four indictments equals four cases. 
Finally, if an indictment contains more than one count (Art. 
21.24, Code of Criminal Procedure), only one case per person 
named in the indictment is reported. The case is reported 
under the classification for the most serious offense alleged.

duty to provide suitable instructions to prevent injury.

STATUTORY COUNTY COURTS
Misdemeanor Case Docket
A criminal case is counted as one defendant per information 
or complaint. For example, if an information names more 
than one defendant, there is more than one case; three 
defendants named in one information equals three cases. If 
the same defendant is charged in more than one information, 
even if for the same criminal episode, there is more than one 
case; the same person named in four informations equals 
four cases. Finally, if an information contains more than one 
count (Art. 21.24, Code of Criminal Procedure) only one case 
per person named in the information is reported. The case is 
reported under the classification for the most serious offense 
alleged.

Case categories are identical to the ones used in the 
CRIMINAL SECTION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COUNTY COURT
