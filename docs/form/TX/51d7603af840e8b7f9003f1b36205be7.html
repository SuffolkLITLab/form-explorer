RULES GOVERNING ADMISSION TO THE BAR OF TEXAS 
 
Rule 4 
Present Good Moral Character and Fitness Requirement 
 
(a)   No one shall be eligible for admission to the Bar or for certification as a Foreign Legal 
Consultant until the investigation of such person’s moral character and fitness has been 
completed, and it has been determined by the Board that such individual possesses present 
good moral character and fitness.  

Good moral character is a functional assessment of character and fitness of a prospective 
lawyer. The purpose of requiring an Applicant to possess present good moral character is 
to exclude from the practice of law those persons possessing character traits that are likely 
to result in injury to future clients, in the obstruction of the administration of justice, or in 
a violation of the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct. These character traits 
usually involve either dishonesty or lack of trustworthiness in carrying out responsibilities. 
There  may  be  other  character  traits  that  are  relevant  in  the  admission  or  certification 
process, but such traits must have a rational connection with the Applicant’s present fitness 
or capacity to practice law and accordingly must relate to the legitimate interests of Texas 
in protecting prospective clients and in safeguarding the system of justice within Texas.  

Fitness, as used in these Rules, is the assessment of mental and emotional health as it affects 
the competence of a prospective lawyer. The purpose of requiring an Applicant to possess 
this fitness is to exclude from the practice of law any person having a mental or emotional 
illness or condition which would be likely to prevent the person from carrying out duties 
to clients, courts or the profession. A person may be of good moral character, but may be 
incapacitated  from  proper  discharge  of  his  or  her  duties  as  a  lawyer  by  such  illness  or 
condition. The fitness required is a present fitness, and prior mental or emotional illness or 
conditions are relevant only so far as they indicate the existence of a present lack of fitness.  

The following provisions shall govern the determination of present good moral character 
and fitness of a Declarant or an Applicant who has been convicted of a felony in Texas or 
placed on  probation for a felony  with  or without an  adjudication of  guilt Texasdeferred 
adjudication  community  supervision  in Texas,  or  who  has  been  convicted  or  placed  on 
probation  with  or  without  an  adjudication  of  guiltdeferred  adjudication  community 
supervision or similar in another jurisdiction for a crime whichthat would be a felony in 
Texas. A Declarant or Applicant may be found lacking in present good moral character and 
fitness  under  this  rule  based  on  the  underlying  facts  of  a  felony  conviction  or  deferred 
adjudication  community  supervision,  as  well  as  based  on  the  conviction  or  probation 
through deferred adjudication community supervision itself. 

(1) 

The record of conviction or order of deferred adjudication is conclusive evidence 
of guilt.   

(21)  An individual guilty of a felony under subsection (d) is conclusively not to have 
deemedExcept  as  otherwise  provided  in  paragraph  (2),  a  felony  conviction  or

felony  deferred  adjudication  community  supervision  creates  a  rebuttable 
presumption that the Declarant or Applicant lacks present good moral character and 
fitness and shall not be permitted to file a Declaration or an Application for a period 
of five years after the completion of the sentence and/or period of probationdeferred 
adjudication community supervision. Such presumption may be rebutted based on 
the evidence shown under subsection (f). 

32)  Upon a credible showing that aA felony conviction or felony probation, either with 
or without an adjudication of guilt, has been reversed on review by an appellate 
court, or that executive pardon has been granted, the Declarant or Applicant shall 
be  permitted  to  file  a  Declaration  or  an  Applicationdeferred  adjudication 
community  supervision  does  not  create  a  presumption  that  the  Declarant  or 
Applicant lacks present good moral character and fitness, if: 

(A) 

the  felony  conviction  or  felony  deferred  adjudication  community 
supervision has been reversed on review by an appellate court; 

B) 

the Declarant or Applicant has been pardoned for the felony; or 

  (

 

the  felony  for  which  the  Declarant  or  Applicant  received  deferred 
adjudication  community  supervision  has  been  dismissed  and  discharged 
under Article 42A.111, Code of Criminal Procedure, unless the Declarant 
or Applicant was placed on deferred adjudication community supervision 
for a felony: 

(i) 

listed in Article 42A.054(a), Code of Criminal Procedure; 

ii) 

described by Article 62.001(5) or (6), Code of Criminal Procedure; 

iii) 

committed under Chapter 21 or 43, Penal Code; or 

  (

  (

C)

  (

 

iv) 

related to the practice of law. 

(e) 

 
The following provisions shall govern the determination of present good moral character 
and  fitness  of  a  Declarant  or Applicant  who  has  been  licensed  to  practice  law  in  any 
jurisdiction  and  has  been  disciplined,  or  allowed  to  resign  in  lieu  of  discipline,  in  that 
jurisdiction: 

(1) 

A certified copy of the order or judgment of discipline from the jurisdiction is prima 
facie  evidence  of  the  matters  contained  in  such  order  or  judgment,  and  a  final 
adjudication in the other jurisdiction that the individual in question has committed 
professional  misconduct  is  conclusive  of  the  professional  misconduct  alleged  in 
such order or judgment. 

(2) 

An individual disciplined for professional misconduct in the course of practicing 
law in any jurisdiction or an individual who resigned in lieu of disciplinary action 

Misc. Docket No. 21-9099 
 

Page 4 

     

 

 

(“disciplined individual”) is deemed not to have present good moral character and 
fitness and is therefore ineligible to file a Declaration or an Application during the 
period  of  such  discipline  imposed  by  such  jurisdiction,  and  in  the  case  of 
disbarment  or  resignation  in  lieu  of  disciplinary  action,  until  the  disciplined 
individual  has  properly  filed  an  application  for  re-licensure  in  the  disciplining 
jurisdiction, in accordance with the procedures established for re-licensure in that 
jurisdiction, and has obtained a final determination on that application. 

 

Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  provision  of  this  paragraph  (e)(2)  and  except  as 
provided  in  paragraph  (d)(2),  if  the  period  of  discipline  imposed  by  another 
jurisdiction exceeds five years, the disciplined individual may file a Declaration or 
an Application after the expiration of five years from the date of imposition of such 
discipline,  provided  that  (s)he  has  obtained  a  final  determination  on  his/her 
application for re-licensure in the disciplining jurisdiction. 

(3) 

The only defenses available to an Applicant or Declarant under subsection (e) are 
outlined below and must be proved by clear and convincing evidence: 

The procedure followed in the disciplining jurisdiction was so lacking in 
notice  or  opportunity  to  be  heard  as  to  constitute  a  deprivation  of  due 
process. 

There  was  such  an  infirmity  of  proof  establishing  the  misconduct  in  the 
other  jurisdiction  as  to  give  rise  to  the  clear  conviction  that  the  Board, 
consistent  with  its  duty,  should  not  accept  as  final  the  conclusion  on  the 
evidence reached in the disciplining jurisdiction. 

The  deeming  of  lack  of  present  good  moral  character  and  fitness  by  the 
Board  during  the  period  required  under  the  provisions  of  subsection  (e) 
would result in grave injustice. 

(A) 

B) 

C) 

  (

  (

  (

D) 

The misconduct for which the individual was disciplined does not constitute 
professional misconduct in Texas. 

 
If  the  Board  determines  that  one  or  more  of  the  foregoing  defenses  has  been 
established, it shall render such orders as it deems necessary and appropriate. 

(4) 

An individual who applies for admission to practice law in Texas or who files a petition for 
redetermination of present moral character and fitness after the expiration of the five-year 
period required under paragraph (d)(2)subsection (d) above or after the completion of the 
disciplinary  period  assessed  or  ineligibility  period  imposed  by  any  jurisdiction  under 
paragraph (e)(2) shall be required to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence:  

that the best interest of the public and the profession, as well as the ends of justice, 
would be served by his or her admission to practice law; 

(1)  

  

f) 

  (

(2)  
  
(3)  

that (s)he is of present good moral character and fitness; and 

that  during  the  five  years  immediately  preceding  the  present  actionapplication, 
(s)he has been living a life of exemplary conduct. 

An individual who files a petition for redetermination of present moral character and fitness 
after  an  adverse  determination  based  on  a  felony  conviction,  felony  probation  with  or 
without adjudication of guiltdeferred adjudication community supervision, or professional 
misconduct or resignation in lieu of disciplinary action and whose petition is denied after 
a hearing, is not eligible to file another petition for redetermination until after the expiration 
of  three  years  from  the  date  of  the  Board’s  order  denying  the  preceding  petition  for 
redetermination. 

If an Applicant is alleged to have violated the Texas Bar Examination Security Policy, the 
Executive  Director  may  withhold  delivery  of  the  Applicant’s  Texas  Bar  Examination 
results until the allegation is resolved by the Board. If, after notice and a hearing, the Board 
determines that an  Applicant  violated the policy, the Board may deem the  Applicant to 
have failed the Texas Bar Examination and prohibit the Applicant from taking the Texas 
Bar Examination in the future.
