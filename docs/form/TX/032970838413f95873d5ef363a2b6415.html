Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 
 
Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 
 

APPEAL NO.: 

22-013 

ESPONDENT: 

Travis County Civil Court Administration  

ATE: 

January 17, 2023 

PECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge  Stephen  B.  Ables,  Chair;  Judge  Dean  Rucker;  Judge 
David Evans; Judge Ana Estevez; Judge Ray Wheless  

 

 

 

 

 

On November 6, 2022, Petitioner sent to Respondent a request for the following categories 

of records: 

1.  “All 2019 weekly docket settings for the Travis County District Civil Courts (non-family)”; 

2.  “All  records  of  cases  including  parties,  dates  and  attorneys  presided  over  by [the  419th 

District Court Judge] from 2019 to present”; 

3.  “Any records of the administration of the Travis County Central Docket in 2019”; and 

4.  “Any records of requests in 2019 under Section 2.6 Assignment of All or Part of Case to a 
Particular  Judge  in  the  Local  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  The  District  Courts  of  Travis 
County Texas.” 

In a November 14 reply to Petitioner, Respondent denied access to the requested records on the 
grounds that they were not “judicial records” subject to disclosure under Rule 12 because to the 
extent they existed they “are maintained by the judiciary and pertain to case files relating to matters 
brought  before  the  Court,  or  to  the  adjudicative  function  of  the  Travis  County  Civil  Courts.” 
Following  receipt  of  Petitioner’s  timely  appeal  and  acting  under  the  direction  of  the  Special 
Committee’s  Directive  Regarding  Petitions  for  Access  to  Case  Records,  the  Office  of  Court 
Administration (OCA) informed Petitioner that from the face of the petition it appeared the records 
requested  were  case  records,  not  judicial  records  subject  to  Rule  12.  The  OCA  letter  granted 
Petitioner  two  weeks  to  contest  OCA’s  conclusions.  Shortly  thereafter,  Petitioner  submitted  a 
reconsideration  letter  conceding  that  Items  1  and  2  of  the  request  were  case  records  and 
withdrawing the petition for those records. Petitioner then cited Rule 12 Decision No. 08-002 in 
requesting  reconsideration  of  the  petition  for  the  remaining  requests.  Upon  further  review,  the 
Special Committee for Review of Petitions for Access to Case Records requested that the petition, 
limited to Items 3 and 4 of Petitioner’s request, be referred to a special committee for review. 

We  first  address  the  records  responsive  to  Item  3  of  Petitioner’s  request. The  threshold 
issue in a Rule 12 appeal is whether a record is a “judicial record” as defined by Rule 12.2(d). Item 
3 of Petitioner’s request seeks “[a]ny records of the administration of the Travis County Central 
Docket in 2019.” Respondent denied access to the records on the grounds that the records sought 
fell outside the definition of “judicial records” because they either pertained to case files relating 
to matters brought before the court or to the adjudicative function of the county courts. Petitioner 
challenged  Respondent’s  framing  of  the  Item  3  records  request,  stating  that  it  “involve[s]  the 

 

 

 

  R

  D

  S

   

   

 

administration of the court system . . . not [the court system’s] adjudicative function in resolving 
the disputes between 2 or more parties.” In its reply to the appeal, Respondent added that “Item 
(3)  seeks  information  concerning  the  District  Courts’  central  docket,  which  refers  to  the  daily 
process by which Court Administration distributes each of the settings — matters scheduled for a 
hearing at that day and time — to an available District Court for hearing and adjudication.” 

Several Rule 12 Decisions have concluded that records related to a court’s administration 
of cases pertain to a court’s adjudicative function.  In Rule 12 Decision No. 09-006, the petitioner 
was denied access to internal administration rules for issuing opinions and orders from a court of 
appeals. The special committee observed that, although the internal administration rules requested 
did not relate to a specific case or matter before the court, the internal administration rules did 
relate to how the court processed cases for disposition and regulated the method by which cases 
pending  in  the  court  were  decided.  Subsequent  Rule  12  decisions  have  built  upon  this 
interpretation. See Rule 12 Decision Nos. 17-018 (internal operation procedure manual regarding 
how  court  processes  cases  pertains  to  adjudicative  function),  19-016  (court’s  local  rules  of 
procedures,  when  maintained  by  court,  relate  to  adjudicative  function  because  they  address 
processing of cases), and 19-026 (internal operating procedures and local rules relate to court’s 
adjudicative function because they address processing of cases).   

In his appeal, Petitioner does not reference any of these decisions and relies instead on Rule 
12  Decision  No.  08-002  to  support  his  contention  that  docket  administration  records  “[c]an  be 
considered judicial records related to administrative process.” In Rule 12 Decision No. 08-002, the 
petitioner requested from a local municipal court a copy of a certain administrative order and other 
records  instructing municipal  court  judges  on  decorum  and  conduct.  The  respondent  asserted  a 
Rule 12.5(a) (Judicial Work Product and Drafts) exemption to disclosure, but neither provided the 
special committee with a description of the withheld documents nor provided any documents to 
the special committee for in camera consideration. Rather, the respondent simply alleged that the 
requested records related to the judge’s adjudicative decision-making process and was considered 
judicial  work  product.  Without  the  benefit  of  the  records  or  a  description  of  them,  the  special 
committee granted the petition for access noting that the requested records appeared to relate to 
the court’s administrative processes. 

In essence, Rule 12 Decision No. 08-002 considered whether the requested records were 
exempt  under  Rule  12.5(a)  as  judicial  work  products  or  drafts.  After  reviewing  the  Rule  12 
decisions  issued  after  Decision  No.  08-002  and  the  description  of  the  records  provided  by 
Respondent,  we  conclude  that  Decision  No.  08-002  is  not  controlling  in  this  appeal.   As  noted 
above,  how  a  court  processes  or  decides  cases  is  part  of its  adjudicative  function.  See  Rule  12 
Decision Nos. 09-006, 17-018, 19-016, 19-026. Records that relate to the daily process by which 
a court administration office distributes settings are part of how a court processes cases and are 
therefore part of a court’s adjudicative function. Accordingly, the records in Item 3 are not “judicial 
records” under Rule 12 and we are without authority to grant the petition in whole or in part or 
sustain the denial of access to the requested records. 

Next,  we  address  the  records  responsive  to  Item  4  of  Petitioner’s  claim.  Under  Rule 
12.2(d),  a record  “created,  produced,  or filed  in  connection  with  any  matter  that  is  or  has  been 
before a court is not a judicial record.” Such records are case records. See Rule 12 Decision No. 
00-001. Item 4 of Petitioner’s request seeks “any records of requests in 2019 under section 2.6 [of 
the  Local  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  and  Rules  of  Decorum  for  the  District  Courts  of  Travis 
County]” (hereinafter “Travis County Local Rules”). Rule 2.6 of the Travis County Local Rules 
is entitled “Assignment of All or Part of Case to a Particular Judge.” Local Rule 2.6 itself reads in 
part: “If a party or parties believe that a case, or part of a case, has unusual characteristics that 

   

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

make it particularly suitable for assignment to one judge, the party or parties jointly may request 
the Local Administrative Judge to assign the case to one judge” (emphasis added). Petitioner’s 
request,  as  extrapolated  through  Travis  County  Local  Rule  2.6,  is  therefore  a  request  for  any 
records requesting that a case or part of a case be assigned to a judge. Records of request under 
Travis County Local Rule 2.6, then, are records “created, produced, or filed” in connection with a 
case and as such are case records, not judicial records. The special committee has no authority 
under Rule 12 to review a dispute over case records. See Rule 12 Decision No. 00-001. 

The  records  in  Items  3  and  4  fall  outside  Rule  12’s  definition  of  “judicial  records.”  

Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.
