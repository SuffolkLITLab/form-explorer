      <pre>Non-CODIS Rapid DNA Considerations and Best Practices for Law 
Enforcement Use 

 
Background and Introduction  

Following enactment of the Rapid DNA Act of 2017 (Public Law 115-50) in August 2017, the 

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began implementation of the Act’s provisions. The Rapid DNA Act 
authorizes the FBI Director to: (1) issue standards and procedures for the use of Rapid DNA instruments 
in the booking station and resulting DNA analyses; and (2) include in the National DNA Index System1, 
DNA identification records and analyses by criminal justice agencies using Rapid DNA instruments 
approved by the FBI Director in compliance with the FBI Director’s standards and procedures.  

The House Report accompanying the Rapid DNA Act of 2017 (H.R. 510) described the bill as 

follows: 

“DNA technology has advanced a great deal in the years since the 1994 Act. Whereas it once 
took days or weeks, DNA testing can now be completed in a matter of hours. There is currently 
technology, known as Rapid DNA technology, that allows for DNA testing and identification on 
a small, copier-sized machine. A DNA sample--oftentimes a cheek swab--is taken, placed 
into a cartridge that slides into the Rapid DNA machine, and reports back the DNA profile 
in approximately ninety minutes. The FBI, working with the forensics community, is hopeful that 
this technology can be used in a booking station to help identify suspects in the same way a 
fingerprint is currently used. At present, Rapid DNA technology can only be used for 
identification purposes, not crime scene analysis. 

Unfortunately, the 1994 Act creating CODIS does not allow for the use of this technology 
since only state labs are allowed access to CODIS. Currently, booking stations have to send their 
DNA samples off to state labs and wait weeks for the results. This has created a backlog that 
impacts all criminal investigations using forensics, not just forensics used for identification 
purposes. H.R. 510 would modify the current law regarding DNA testing and access to CODIS. 
The short turnaround time resulting from increased use of Rapid DNA technology would 
help to quickly eliminate potential suspects, capture those who have committed a previous 
crime and left DNA evidence, as well as free up current DNA profilers to do advanced 
forensic DNA analysis, such as crime scene analysis and rape-kits.”  House Report 115-117 
(May 2017) [emphasis added] 
 

A number of professional associations/organizations issued statements on Rapid DNA reiterating 
agreement with the position that Rapid DNA technology be used, at present, for single source reference 
analyses.2 These position statements identify the following challenges to the use of Rapid DNA  

                                                           
1 Note:  the terms NDIS (National DNA Index System) and CODIS (the Combined DNA Index System) may be 
used interchangeably in this document, however, NDIS references the index at the national level and CODIS 
typically refers to the software and databases at all levels – local, state and national. 
2 See, for example, ASCLD Position Statement (2017) at https://www.ascld.org/wp-
content/uploads/2017/11/ASCLD-Position-Statement-RAPID-DNA.pdf; NDAA Position Statement on Use of 
Rapid DNA Technology (2018) at https://dps.alaska.gov/getmedia/fb933229-8e52-4cf8-8fe0-

technology presented by crime scene or forensic samples that are not present with single source reference 
samples:  

•  Crime scene samples may be mixtures, contain low quantity or degraded DNA; 
•  The FBI Director’s Quality Assurance Standards for Forensic DNA Testing Laboratories 

requires quantitation of forensic samples; 

•  There are currently no approved Expert Systems for crime scene samples; and 
•  Law enforcement collecting crime scene samples do not have the education, training or 

experience necessary to assess the crime scene evidence and determine the type of testing to 
achieve the optimal results from the DNA sample.  

he FBI has been focusing its primary implementation efforts on the use of Rapid DNA 
instruments in booking stations for the analysis of single source reference samples obtained from arrestees 
and other offenders required by law to provide DNA samples. In particular, the FBI is working to develop 
the statutorily required standards and procedures and pilot testing of the computer interfaces and 
communications involving law enforcement agencies (as contrasted with forensic DNA laboratories who 
are the current participants in the National DNA Index System). However, at the same time, the FBI is 
aware that Rapid DNA instruments are being marketed to and used by law enforcement agencies for the 
analysis of crime scene samples. To address this, the FBI empaneled a Rapid DNA Task Force composed 
of two task groups to assess, evaluate, and make recommendations on the use of Rapid DNA instruments 
for the analysis of crime scene samples -- the Rapid DNA Crime Scene Technology Advancement Task 
Group and the Non-CODIS Rapid DNA Best Practices/Outreach and Courtroom Considerations Task 
Group.   

The Non-CODIS Rapid DNA Best Practices/Outreach and Courtroom Considerations Task 
Group was empaneled in October 2018 and includes representatives from forensic DNA laboratories, law 
enforcement, and prosecutors. One of the objectives for the Task Group includes providing best practices 
for the law enforcement community when using Rapid DNA instruments for the analysis of crime scene 
samples. This will allow law enforcement to strategically implement this technology for purposes of 
establishing a proper foundation for the introduction of the resulting DNA analyses in court. The Task 
Group recognizes that law enforcement’s use of Rapid DNA instruments to analyze crime scene samples 
reflects on the use of Rapid DNA technology in general and accordingly seeks to ensure a consistent and 
appropriate use of Rapid DNA technology on crime scene samples, even if the resulting DNA analyses 
are not eligible for CODIS and NDIS. It is important to the law enforcement community and the criminal 
justice system that Rapid DNA technology be used in a responsible manner that preserves the reputation 
of statutorily authorized law enforcement DNA databases at the local, state and national levels. 

Accordingly, the Task Group is providing guidance for law enforcement implementing Rapid 

DNA technology in the analysis of crime scene samples in the following areas: administrative practices, 
Rapid DNA instruments and consumables, staffing, training and proficiency testing, crime scene samples, 
consensual reference samples, abandoned or surreptitious samples, sample assessment and acceptance, 
sample comparisons, reporting Rapid DNA results, metrics, and safety.

Crime Scene Samples: 

1.  Establish a policy to identify which samples will be collected and subjected to Rapid DNA 
analysis. Consider quantity, quality, potential mixtures, and sample consumption when 
developing the policy. Criteria should be based on validation data, the training level of the user, 
potential investigative and court impact, and quality assurance concerns. 
 
 “A-Swab/ B-Swab” strategy should be employed:  A-Swab: swab/sample for accredited forensic 
DNA laboratory analysis.  B-Swab: “additional swab” for Rapid DNA analysis. Consider side-by-
side collection where biological material is collected “together” during the swabbing motion 
(bouquet method) versus the A-Swab is collected first and the B-Swab collected second 
(sequential). 

2. 

Consensual Reference Samples: 

1.  Follow existing consent standards for your state and agency, if applicable. Consider written 

consent form, witness, audio or video recording of consent and collection. 
 

2.  Determine method of reference swab collection, either self-collection or law enforcement officer 

collection and establish a written protocol for reference sample collection. 
 

3.  If Rapid DNA analysis will be used for databasing in addition to direct comparison, collect at 

least 2 samples (one for Rapid/one for lab OR 2 for databasing purposes). 

1.  Determine if and when abandoned or surreptitious DNA samples will be processed.   

2.  Determine if abandoned or surreptitious Rapid DNA data will be databased and/or used for direct 

Abandoned or Surreptitious Samples: 

 

comparisons only.

b.  Modified Rapid DNA analysis that incorporates some level of review of the 

data/electropherogram by a trained individual. The level of review and interpretation 
should be dictated by the level of training/expertise of the user. For example, levels could 
include: 

i.  Technician: trained to review basic single source profiles and identify those 

profiles (data) that need to be rejected or submitted to the laboratory examiner for 
review. 

ii.  Forensic Examiner: a fully qualified DNA analyst, trained on all aspects of DNA 

analysis. 

c.  Procedure should address interpretation or rejection of samples that yield no data, are 
inconclusive, mixtures, or partial profiles. If fully automated system, this should be 
addressed in the parameters used to set up your system and may not require a separate 
procedure. 

d.  Procedure should be based on developmental and/or internal validation, as appropriate. 

2.  Establish written protocols on how Rapid DNA profiles may be utilized. 

a.  Single source profiles generated by an approved and properly maintained Rapid DNA 

instrument, utilizing approved Expert System software. 

b.  Profiles interpreted by a qualified DNA analyst. 
c.  Procedure should address whether profiles will be used for single case comparisons 

and/or stored/searched within a local DNA database. 

Sample Comparisons 

1.  Establish written Rapid DNA comparison procedures. Consider the following: 

a.  Fully automated Rapid DNA (black box) analysis and comparison of samples using a 

validated and approved Rapid DNA instrument. 

b.  Modified Rapid DNA analysis and comparison that incorporates interpretation and 

comparison of data/electropherograms by a trained individual. The level of interpretation 
and comparison should be dictated by the level of training/expertise of the user. For 
example, levels could include: 

i.  Technician: trained to review and compare basic single-source profiles and 

identify those comparison profiles (data) that require submission to a laboratory 
examiner for review. 

ii.  Forensic Examiner: a fully qualified forensic DNA analyst, trained on all relevant 

aspects of DNA analysis. 

2.  Establish requirements and procedures for reporting the conclusions from a comparison that may 
include ‘match’, ‘possible match’, ‘no match’, and ‘inconclusive’ conclusions when comparing 
profiles. 

a.  Consider how the significance of a match/no match will be reported.   

i.  Basic match statement with no statistics issued as an investigative lead with 

referral to future accredited forensic DNA laboratory analysis. 

ii.  Match statement based on a pre-established threshold, such as a minimum 

number of loci. 

iii.  Actual statistics for the comparison, calculated by a qualified DNA analyst.

iv.  No match (exclusion) statement. 

3.  Establish a procedure for the interpretation and reporting of mixtures, if using modified approach 

with trained and qualified DNA analyst. 
 

4.  Establish a procedure for the review of electropherograms, if using the modified approach or as a 
quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) step in the fully automated approach to ensure the 
system is functioning appropriately.  
 

5.  Establish if Rapid DNA data will be compared to previously generated results and/or stored 

within a local non-CODIS database.   

a.  Local non-CODIS databases should have fully developed and documented procedures for 

profile acceptance, expungement, use, and security. 

6.  Establish a policy to address concordance/non-concordance between A-swab and B-swab results.  

Reporting Rapid DNA Results 

1.  Establish a Rapid DNA report writing procedure that includes the comparison issues addressed 

2.  Establish a procedure for sample failures and machine run failures. 

1.  Considering tracking volume and type of cases and samples submitted. 

2.  Considering tracking outcomes including number and types of samples processed, profiles 

generated (sample success rate: partial and complete profiles). 
 

3.  Consider tracking arrests, prosecutions, convictions, and exonerations involving Rapid DNA 

4.  Consider determining effect of Rapid DNA program on crime statistics. 

1.  Establish procedures for the handling and disposal of chemical hazardous waste. 

2.  Establish procedures for the handling and disposal of biohazardous waste.
