(a)  

Except  as  permitted  in  paragraphs  (c)  or  (d),  a  lawyer  having  knowledge  that  another 
lawyer has committed a violation of applicable rules of professional conduct that raises a 
substantial question as to that lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in 
other respects, shall inform the appropriate disciplinary authority. 

b) 

 Except as permitted in paragraphs (c) or (d), a lawyer having knowledge that a judge has 
committed  a  violation  of  applicable  rules  of  judicial  conduct  that  raises  a  substantial 
question as to the judge’s fitness for office shall inform the appropriate authority. 

c)   A  lawyer  having  knowledge  or  suspecting  that  another  lawyer  or  judge  whose  conduct 
the lawyer is required to report pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Rule is impaired 
by chemical dependency on alcohol or drugs or by mental illness may report that person 
to  an  approved  peer  assistance  program  rather  than  to  an  appropriate  disciplinary 
authority.  If  a  lawyer  elects  that  option,  the  lawyer’s  report  to  the  approved  peer 
assistance  program  shall  disclose  any  disciplinary  violations  that  the  reporting  lawyer 
would otherwise have to disclose to the authorities referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b). 

d)  

This rule does not require disclosure of knowledge or information otherwise protected as 
confidential information: 

(1) 

by Rule 1.05 or 

 

(2) 

 

by any statutory or regulatory provisions applicable to the counseling activities of 
the approved peer assistance program. 

(e)    A lawyer who has been convicted or placed on probation, with or without an adjudication 
of  guilt,  by  any  court  for  barratry,  any  felony,  or  for  a  misdemeanor  involving  theft, 
embezzlement, or fraudulent or reckless misappropriation of money or other property—
including a conviction or sentence of probation for attempt, conspiracy, or solicitation—
must  notify  the  chief  disciplinary  counsel  within  30  days  of  the  date  of  the  order  or 
judgment.  The notice must include a copy of the order or judgment.  

f)    A  lawyer  who  has  been  disciplined  by  the  attorney-regulatory  agency  of  another 
jurisdiction  must notify the chief disciplinary  counsel  within  30 days  of  the date  of the 
order or judgment. The notice must include a copy of the order or judgment.

TEXAS DISCIPLINARY RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT 

   

Rule 8.03. Reporting Professional Misconduct 

Self-regulation  of  the  legal  profession  requires  that  members  of  the  profession  initiate 
disciplinary investigations when they have knowledge not protected by Rule 1.05 that a 

Misc. Docket No. 18-9030

violation of these rules  has occurred.  Lawyers have a similar obligation with  respect  to 
judicial  misconduct.  Frequently,  the  existence  of  a  violation  cannot  be  established  with 
certainty until a disciplinary investigation has been undertaken. Similarly, an apparently 
isolated  violation  may  indicate  a  pattern  of  misconduct  that  only  a  disciplinary 
investigation can uncover. Consequently, a lawyer should not  fail to  report an apparent 
disciplinary  violation  merely  because  he  cannot  determine  its  existence  or  scope  with 
absolute  certainty.  Reporting  a  violation  is  especially  important  where  the  victim  is 
unlikely to discover the offense. 

It should be noted that this Rule describes only those disciplinary violations that must be 
revealed by the disclosing lawyer in order to avoid violating these rules himself. It is not 
intended  to,  nor  does  it,  limit  those  actual  or  suspected  violations  that  a  lawyer  may 
report.  However,  if  a  lawyer  were  obliged  to  report  every  violation  of  these  rules,  the 
failure to report any violation would itself be a professional offense. Such a requirement 
existed  in  many  jurisdictions  but  proved  to  be  unenforceable.  This  Rule  limits  the 
reporting  obligation  to  those  offenses  that  a  self-regulating  profession  must  vigorously 
endeavor to prevent. A measure of judgment is, therefore, required in complying with the 
provisions  of  this  Rule.  Similar  considerations  apply  to  the  reporting  of  judicial 
misconduct. The term “substantial” refers to the seriousness of the possible offense and 
not  the  quantum  of  evidence  of  which  the  lawyer  is  aware.  The  term  “fitness”  has  the 
meanings ascribed to it in the Terminology provisions of these Rules. 

A  report  of  professional  misconduct  by  a  lawyer  should  be  made  and  processed  in 
accordance with Article X of the State Bar Rules. A lawyer need not report misconduct 
where  the  report  would  involve  a  violation  of  Rule  1.05.  However,  a  lawyer  should 
encourage a client to consent to disclosure where prosecution of the violation would not 
substantially  prejudice  the  client's  interests.  Likewise,  the  duty  to  report  professional 
misconduct  does  not  apply  to  a  lawyer  retained  to  represent  a  lawyer  whose  past 
professional conduct is in question. Such a situation is governed by the rules applicable to 
the client-lawyer relationship. 

.  

Paragraphs (e) and (f) are added under section 81.081 of the Government Code.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
