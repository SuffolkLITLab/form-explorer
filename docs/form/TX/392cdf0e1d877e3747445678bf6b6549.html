Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 

PECIAL COMMITTEE:        Judge Stephen B. Ables, Chair; Judge Susan Brown; Judge Billy 

Ray Stubblefield; Judge Dean Rucker; Judge Ana Estevez  

Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 

   

APPEAL NO.: 

22-005 

ESPONDENT: 

Office of Court Administration   

ATE: 

July 1, 2022 

 

 

 

 

 

In December 2021, Petitioner requested from Respondent information, including letters, 
memos, emails, and texts, related to certain named individuals as well as the estate, guardianship, 
and probate of one of the named individuals. Petitioner also requested six other categories of records 
and Respondent informed Petitioner that the request was overly broad. Respondent withheld certain 
records  and  informed  Petitioner  that  no  action  would  be  taken  on  the  remaining  items  until  it 
received clarification from Petitioner on what was sought. Petitioner then filed an appeal for access 
to the withheld record. Certain documents from that request became the focus of Rule 12 Decision 
No.  22-001.  On  March  18,  2022,  Petitioner  attempted  to  revise  and  narrow  the  outstanding 
categories of records from the December request that Respondent designated as overly broad. The 
revised request divided records into four categories. Three of these categories (Parts B-1, B-2, and 
B-3)  collectively  contain  over  40  sub-requests  related  to  information  held  by  the  Guardianship 
Abuse, Fraud, and Exploitation Deterrence Program (GAFEDP) and various divisions of the Office 
of Court Administration (OCA); the remaining category (Part A) seeks “any items not yet produced 
but requested” from the December 2021 request. Respondent, in its reply to Petitioner, noted it had 
disclosed all records responsive to Part A and that there were no additional responsive records to this 
portion of the request. Respondent’s answers to Parts B-1, B-2, and B-3 vary by the request, but at 
bottom did not provide any documents to Petitioner. In summary, Respondent indicated it did not 
have documents responsive to some requests or had previously disclosed documents responsive to 
some  requests,  stated  it  could  not  ascertain  what  was  being  sought  in  some  requests  without 
clarification, and denied access to documents responsive to certain requests because the documents 
were exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5. Petitioner then filed a petition for review. Respondent 
did not submit a reply to Petitioner’s petition nor submitted documents identified as exempt to the 
special  committee  for  invited  in  camera  review.  For  ease  of  navigation,  this  opinion  analyzes 
Petitioner’s requests and Respondent’s answers to the requests under the Petitioner’s Part B-1, B-2, 
and B-3 rubric. 

Part B-1 of Petitioner’s request contains 25 sub-requests “[n]ot limited to any certain subjects 
but inclusive of any existing records on any subject” as identified by Petitioner. These subjects cover 
various GAFEDP records, correspondence with certain judges, certain guardianship records and 
related complaints, correspondence with or between OCA staff, and complaints related to OCA staff. 
In response to items: 

art B-1 Records

  P

   

•  B-1, 1.a – 1.g, Respondent stated the records sought were exempt from disclosure under Rule 
12.5(j) as judicial records relating to litigation or settlement negotiations, and that records 
responsive to the request had previously been disclosed under the December 2021 request; 

•  B-1, 2 – 10, Respondent stated the records sought were exempt from disclosure under Rule 

12.5(j) as judicial records relating to litigation or settlement negotiations;  

•  B-1, 11 – 13, Respondent declared the request overbroad and requested Petitioner narrow or 

restrict the request or otherwise clarify the request because it was vague; 

•  B-1, 14 – 15, Respondent stated the records sought were exempt from disclosure under Rule 

12.5(j) as judicial records relating to litigation or settlement negotiations; 

•  B-1, 16, Respondent stated the records sought were exempt from disclosure because they 
were  adjudicative  records,  not  judicial  records,  and  that  the  records  are  exempt  from 
disclosure under Rule 12.5(i) as lawyer-client privileged information; and 

•  B-1, 17 – 19, Respondent stated the March request restated parts of the December request 
without clarification or restriction, were overbroad, and could not be responded to without 
clarification to focus and narrow the request. In a separate part of Respondent’s answer to 
Petitioner, Respondent indicated it had previously disclosed documents responsive to item B-
1, 18. 

We  first  separate  out  items  B-1,  11  –  13,  17,  and  19.  Respondent  declared  these  items 
overbroad and immune to resolution without narrowing, restriction, or clarification. A petition for 
review must contain a copy of the request and the records custodian’s notice of denial of the request. 
Rule  12.9(b).  Materials  submitted  with  the  petition  do  not  indicate  that  Petitioner  narrowed, 
restricted,  or  clarified  these  requests  to  thereby  permit  Respondent  to  respond  to  the  requests. 
Petitioner’s petition on these items thus remains unripe for review and we do not consider them in 
this appeal.  

We next address item B-1, 18. On its face, request items B-1, 17 – 19 would include item B-
1,  18,  and  logically  Respondent’s  “overbroad”  label  would  apply  to  item  B-1,  18.  However, 
Respondent’s reply to Petitioner’s request also suggests Respondent previously disclosed records 
responsive to item B-1, 18. Because Respondent did not submit a reply in response to Petitioner’s 
petition for review and there is tension between Respondent’s replies on B-1, 17 – 19 generally and 
B-1, 18 specifically, we consider item B-1, 18 unripe and leave it unaddressed here. 

For items B-1, 1.a – 1.g, 2 – 10, and 14 – 15, Respondent stated the records sought were 
exempt from disclosure under Rule 12’s “litigation exemption.” Respondent also informed Petitioner 
that it had previously disclosed records responsive to items B-1, 1.a. – 1.g in response to Petitioner’s 
December request. Rule 12.5(j) reads as follows:  

   

   

   

Any  judicial  record  relating  to  civil  or  criminal  litigation  or 
settlement negotiations: (1) in which a court or judicial agency is or 
may  be  a  party;  or  (2)  in  which  a  judicial  officer  or  member  of  a 
judicial agency is or may be a party as a consequence of the person’s 
office or employment. (emphasis added) 

In its reply to Petitioner’s March request, Respondent informed Petitioner that it had discovered — 
after it had made initial disclosures relating to the requests in the December request — that many of 
the sought-after records related to cases involving various judges as parties in recent or pending 

 

 

 

 

litigation.  Respondent  named  in  its  reply  to  Petitioner  specific  lawsuits  allegedly  tied  to  the 
requested records. Respondent’s litigation exemption claim in the instant petition appears to present 
a novel issue for our consideration not previous covered by our Rule 12 opinions — namely whether 
Rule 12’s litigation exemption, without scrutiny, applies where the Respondent is not clearly a party 
to or involved in the underlying litigation relied upon for the exemption claim.  

When our prior opinions are silent on pertinent Rule 12 issues, we frequently examine the 
Public Information Act (PIA) and its interpretation in guiding our decision on those issues. Like 
Rule 12, the PIA contains a litigation exception provision. Gov’t Code §552.103(a). In interpreting 
the PIA, Texas Supreme Court caselaw holds that “a party seeking to withhold requested information 
bears  the  burden  of  proving  that  the  information  is  not  subject  to  disclosure  under  the  [PIA].” 
Greater Houston P’ship v. Paxton, 468 S.W.3d 51, 58 (Tex. 2015) (citing Thomas v. Cornyn, 71 
S.W.3d 473, 487 (Tex. App. – Austin 2002, no pet.), which held that it was the local sheriff’s burden 
to prove the PIA’s litigation exception permitted the records withholding at issue and, that where no 
evidence was provided to prove the exception’s application, the trial court did not err in concluding 
the requested information was not subject to the exception). Applied to the instant case, then, we find 
that Respondent bears the burden of proving that the information is not subject to disclosure under 
the litigation exemption. Because Respondent has not carried this burden, we conditionally grant 
Petitioner access to items B-1, 1.a – 1.g1, 2 – 10, and 14 – 15. We grant Respondent 14 days leave 
from the date of this decision to submit to the special committee the items withheld from Petitioner 
for our in camera review, along with a written response detailing why the items are exempt from 
disclosure under Rule 12.5(j). Should Respondent not submit the items and its written response 
within the timeframe listed above, it must release the withheld items to Petitioner. 

Finally, for item B-1, 16, Respondent replied to Petitioner that the record sought referenced a 
communication made to the General Counsel of OCA related to matters pending in court, placing the 
record outside the scope of Rule 12. Respondent also wrote that item B-1, 16 was exempt from 
disclosure as a privileged lawyer-client communication. The threshold issue in a Rule 12 appeal is 
whether a requested record is a “judicial record,” which is defined by Rule 12.2(d): 

   

   

Judicial Record means a record made or maintained by or for a court 
or judicial agency in its regular course of business but not pertaining 
to its adjudicative function, regardless of whether that function relates 
to a specific case. A record of any nature created, produced, or filed 
in connection with any matter than is or has been before a court is not 
a judicial record. (emphasis added) 

In  this  case,  a  record  can  slip  outside  Rule  12’s  scope  by  pertaining  to  a  judicial  agency’s 
adjudicative function or by being created, produced, or filed in connection to a matter before a court. 
Respondent, in its answer to Petitioner’s request, informed Petitioner that many of the records sought 
in the request related to various lawsuits. This ostensibly included item B-1, 16, which Respondent 
claimed “was made to the General Counsel of [OCA] relating to matters pending in court.” Based on 
the terms of Rule 12.5(d), however, that a requested record “relates to” matters pending before a 
court does not axiomatically push it outside of Rule 12’s purview. Here the record still must fall 
outside  Rule  12  based  on  its  status  as  an  adjudicative  record  (“pertaining  to  its  adjudicative 
function”) or because it is a case record (“created, produced, or filed in connection with any matter . 
. . before a court”). Without being able to review the communication at issue in item B-1,16, we 
cannot  determine  whether  or  how  the  record  “pertains  to  [OCA’s]  adjudicative  function”  or  is 

1 We were unable to discern from the Respondent’s reply to the request whether all responsive records requested in 
items B-1, 1.a – 1.g had been provided to Petitioner. To the extent that any responsive records do exist that were not 
previously provided to Petitioner, we grant conditional access to those.  

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise a record “created, produced, or filed in connection with any matter that is or has been 
before a court,” nor can we assess whether Respondent’s privilege exemption applies. We thus 
conditionally grant Petitioner access to item B-1, 16. We grant Respondent 14 days leave from the 
date of this decision to submit to the special committee the item withheld from Petitioner for our in 
camera review, along with a written response detailing why the item is not a judicial record and, 
alternatively, if it is, why it should be exempt from disclosure. Should Respondent not submit the 
item and its written response within the timeframe listed above, it must release the withheld item to 
Petitioner. 

art B-2 Records 

Part B-2 of Petitioner’s request contains 4 sub-requests covering “[a]ll records regarding any 
complaints, grievances, reprimands, corrections, including any accusations of any of these (inclusive 
of all), concerning OCA, including but not limited to” the following: 

•  “All regarding performance of OCA and any of its Representatives (inclusive of all) covering 

the items referenced in in [sic] B-2 above.” 

•  “All  between  OCA  and  any  Texas  legislator,  legislator  Representative  or  legislative 

committee (inclusive of all) covering the items referenced in B-2 above.” 

•  “All between OCA and any representative of the Texas Governor’s office covering the items 

referenced in B-2 above.” 

•  “All regarding any dismissal or resignation of any OCA Representative if based on any item 

referred to To [sic] B-2 above.” 

In response to the B-2 requests, Respondent replied to Petition that the March request restated parts 
of  the  December  request  without  clarification  or  restriction,  were  overbroad,  and  could  not  be 
responded to without clarification to focus and narrow the request. Respondent further elaborated 
that the terms used in the request were open to interpretation. Respondent requested that Petitioner 
narrow the request to more specifically identify the records sought.  

As we noted above, a petition for review must contain a copy of the request and the records 
custodian’s notice of denial of the request. Rule 12.9(b). Materials submitted with the petition do not 
indicate that Petitioner narrowed, restricted, or clarified this request to thereby permit Respondent to 
respond to the requests. Petitioner’s petition on these items thus remains unripe for review and we do 
not consider them in this appeal. 

art B-3 Records 

Part B-3 of Petitioner’s request contains 18 sub-requests covering GAFEDP audits, certain 
wards, the Petitioner, various estates, and any court overseeing matters related to the subjects listed 
by Petitioner “limited to these matters unless a different subject is specifically noted” by Petitioner. 
In response to items: 

•  B-3, 1 – 12, Respondent stated the records sought were exempt from disclosure under Rule 

12.5(j) as judicial records relating to litigation or settlement negotiations; 

•  B-3, 13, Respondent stated records responsive to the request were previously disclosed to 

  P

   

   

  P

   

Petitioner; 

 

 

 

 

•  B-3, 14, Respondent answered that there were no records responsive to the request; 

•  B-3,  15  –  17,  Respondent  stated  that  the  records  sought  by  Petitioner  could  not  be 
ascertained, as Petitioner’s requested documents flowed from cross-referenced topics in a 
non-existent section of the request letter; and 

•  B-3, 18, Respondent stated records responsive to the request were previously disclosed to 

Petitioner. 

We first consider item B-3, 14. Here, Respondent informed the Petitioner that it does not 
 
have any documents responsive to Petitioner’s request. There being no records responsive to the 
request, the appeal on this item is denied. 
 
 
We next take up items B-3, 13 and 18. Here, Respondent informed Petitioner that it had 
 
previously disclosed records responsive to Petitioner’s request. Rule 12 does not require a records 
custodian to create documents in response to a request. See Rule 12.4(a)(1), Rule 12 Decision Nos. 
19-018, 18-001, and 16-012. Respondent has no further obligation regarding these request items. 

We next consider items B-3, 15 – 17. In its reply to Petitioner, Respondent alerted Petitioner 
that the documents sought were tethered to a non-existent section in the letter referenced by the 
Petitioner  and  therefore  could  not  be  ascertained.  Materials  submitted  with  the  petition  do  not 
indicate  that  Petitioner  clarified  these  requests  to  thereby  permit  Respondent  to  respond  to  the 
requests. Petitioner’s petition on these items thus remains unripe for review and we do not consider 
them in this appeal. 

Finally, we review items B-3, 1 – 12. Similar to its response for the records requested in Part 
B-1 of Petitioner’s letter, Respondent stated that the records sought were exempt from disclosure 
because the records related to litigation or settlement negotiations in which a court or judicial agency 
is  or  may  be  a  party.  Respondent  did  not  provide  the  special  committee  with  any  additional 
information related to its exemption claim, and therefore our analysis of items B-1, 1.a – 1.g, 2 – 10, 
and 14 – 15, above, applies to items B-3, 1 – 12. As we did with the applicable B-1 items, we 
conditionally grant Petitioner access to items B-3, 1 – 12. We grant Respondent 14 days leave from 
the date of this decision to submit to the special committee the items withheld from Petitioner for our 
in camera review, along with a written response detailing why the items are exempt from disclosure 
under Rule 12.5(j). Should Respondent not submit the items and its written response within the 
timeframe listed above, it must release the withheld items to Petitioner. 

In conclusion, then, and for the reasons stated above, for items: 

•  B-1,  1.a  –  1.g,  to  the  extent  any  records  remain  that  were  not  previously  provided  to 
Petitioner, we conditionally grant Petitioner access to these items; Respondent has 14 days 
from  the  date  of  this  opinion to  submit  the  items  plus  a  written  response  to  the  special 
committee for review; alternatively, it must release the items; 

•  B-1, 2 – 10, we conditionally grant Petitioner access to these items; Respondent has 14 days 
from  the  date  of  this  opinion to  submit  the  items  plus  a  written  response  to  the  special 
committee for review; alternatively, it must release the items;  

•  B-1, 11 – 13, the items remain unripe for review and are not considered in this appeal; 

•  B-1, 14 – 15, we conditionally grant Petitioner access to these items; Respondent has 14 days 
from  the  date  of  this  opinion to  submit  the  items  plus  a  written  response  to  the  special 
committee for review; alternatively, it must release the items; 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

•  B-1, 16, we conditionally grant Petitioner access to the item; Respondent has 14 days from 
the date of this opinion to submit the item to the special committee for review; alternatively, 
it must release the item; 

•  B-1, 17 – 19, the items remain unripe for review and are not considered in this appeal; 

•  B-2, the items remain unripe for review and are not considered in this appeal; 

•  B-3, 1 – 12, we conditionally grant Petitioner access to these items; Respondent has 14 days 
from  the  date  of  this  opinion to  submit  the  items  plus  a  written  response  to  the  special 
committee for review; alternatively, it must release the items; 

•  B-3, 13, Respondent has no further obligation regarding these request items; 

•  B-3, 14, the appeal on this item is denied; 

•  B-3, 15 – 17, these items remain unripe for review and are not considered in this appeal; and 

•  B-3, 18, Respondent has no further obligation regarding this request item.
