TIME AND LEAVE POLICY 

eneral 

his policy outlines leave benefits and reporting requirements for Court employees.  Each state 
agency is required to keep a record of its employees’ accrual and use of annual and sick leave; and 
account for whether leave taken is for sick leave, annual leave, other paid leave, leave without pay, 
or other absence.  To the extent that any terms herein conflict with state law, state law controls. 

efinition of Terms 

A.  FLSA (Fair Labor Standards Act) - is the federal law that establishes overtime pay 
and recordkeeping standards affecting full-time and part-time workers in the private 
and  governmental  sectors.    Court  employees  may  find  their  FLSA  status  on  their 
monthly earning statements.  

B.  FLSA Exempt Employee – an employee who is not subject to (i.e., is exempt from) 

the provisions of the FLSA. 

C.  FLSA Non-Exempt Employee – an employee who is subject to (i.e. is not exempt 

from) the provisions of the FLSA.  

D.  Member  of  an  employee’s  family  –  the  following  persons  are  considered  to  be 
members of an employee’s immediate family: 1) an individual who resides in the same 
household as the employee and is related by kinship, adoption, or marriage; (2) a foster 
child who resides in the same household as the employee; and 3) a minor child of the 
employee, whether or not living in the same household.  

ork Time  

  
An  employee  is  expected  to  report  to  work  at  the  appointed  time  and  work  all  of  his  or  her 
scheduled hours. 

otice of Absences from Work  

When an employee is unable to report for work and prior approval for the absence has not been 
obtained, the employee is to, at the earliest practicable time, notify (or have someone else notify) 
his or her supervisor that the employee is unable to report for duty. 

Work Hours  
 

A.  Standard Workweek - The standard workweek for full-time employees is 40 hours.  The 

workweek is 12:00 a.m. Saturday through 11:59 p.m. Friday.  

 

  G

  D

  

 

  

 

  W

  N

 

 

B.  Office Hours - The Clerk’s Office shall remain open to the public from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 
p.m. Monday through Friday.  The Clerk of the Court is responsible for establishing work 
schedules for the Clerk’s Office.  Each judge may establish regular work hours for his or 
her chambers. 
 

C.  Flex Time - Non-exempt employees may make up (Flex) not more than two hours of leave 
within a week, and must make up that time within the same week.  All other time must be 
deducted from accrued employee leave.   

ther Activities Considered Work Time 

  O

In  addition  to  time  spent  performing  regular  job  duties,  the  following  activities  are  considered 
work time:  
 

A.  Travel Time -Travel time is considered hours worked when the employee is in transit on 
official travel status out of town to attend or return from work-related training, conferences, 
or  meetings,  except  for  bona  fide  meal  periods,  when  sleeping,  or  when  free  to  pursue 
personal activities.  (Travel time between the employee’s home and regular duty station is 
not considered work time.)  
 

B.  Training Time - Participation in required training programs is considered hours worked.  
Voluntary training is considered hours worked only when the Court chooses to recognize 
such hours.  
 

C.  Breaks - An employee is allowed two paid work breaks of up to 15 minutes each.  

 

Employee Break and Meal Periods 

A.  Lunch - Employees are entitled to one hour for lunch.  In order to provide public access to 
the Court, the Clerk of the Court is responsible for establishing lunch schedules for the 
Clerk’s Office.  Each employee should take a minimum of one-half hour for lunch except 
in extraordinary circumstances. 
 

B.  Breaks - Breaks are not required by law.  However, Court employees may take one 15 
minute break in both the morning and afternoon as the work schedule permits.  Breaks may 
not be: 

Page 4 of 15 

•  Combined into one 30 minute break; 
•  Carried and accumulated from one day to the next; 
•  Added to the lunch period; 
•  Taken at the end of the work day 
•  Accrued as leave not taken; or 
•  Used to make up prior absences 

 

   

 

Leave Granted at the Discretion of Supervisors  

efore requesting leave, employees should ensure that they have adequate leave balances and that 
their absence will not interfere with the performance of their job duties.  Leave approval is not 
automatic.    While  every  attempt  is  made  to  accommodate  employees’  timely  leave  requests, 
supervisors  have the authority and  responsibility to  use their  discretion to ensure  that adequate 
staff remains on duty to perform the work of the Court.  

xcessive Absenteeism or Tardiness  

bsenteeism or tardiness is excessive when an employee is unable to adequately perform his/her 
job, or when the normal day-to-day work activities of the office are disrupted due to excessive 
and/or unscheduled absences or tardiness by the employee.  Excessive absenteeism or tardiness 
may be grounds for disciplinary actions, up to and including termination. 
  
Unauthorized Absence  

n  employee  who  fails  to  report  to  or  remain  at  work,  or  who  fails  to  return  to  work  upon 
expiration of approved leave, may be considered to have abandoned his or her position with the 
Court.    Such  an  employee  will  be  expected  to  produce  a  satisfactory  explanation  for  the 
unauthorized absence.  An employee who is absent from work for three or more consecutive days 
without contacting his or her supervisor will be deemed to have abandoned his or her job at the 
close of the third day.  Unauthorized absence(s) may be grounds for disciplinary actions, up to and 
including termination.  

ime Reporting and CAPPS 

(See Texas Government Code 661.908)  
  

A.  Leave  Request  Form  Required  -  All  Court  employees  are  required  to  document  their 
leave by completing the Court’s Leave Request Form.  For timekeeping purposes, all leave 
is to be rounded to quarter-hour (15 minute) increments.   

B.  Leave  Request  Form  Due  -  Employees  should  submit  a  Leave  Request  Form  to  their 
supervisor for signature by the end of each month.  All Court employees must receive prior 
approval from their supervisors for all leave, unless it is for sick leave.  

C.  Entering Leave in CAPPS - The Court’s Human Resource Department is responsible for 

entering time in CAPPS. 

vertime and Compensatory Time 
(See Texas Government Code 659.015)  
 

A.  FLSA Exempt & Non-exempt Employees - Overtime eligibility is governed under the 
provisions of the FLSA.  Eligibility is not based on an employee’s classification title or 
pay group, but on the employee’s functional job.  FLSA exempt employees are ineligible 
to  earn  overtime  compensation.    FLSA  non-exempt  employees  are  eligible  to  earn 

Page 5 of 15

  E

  T

 

 

 

  O

Page 6 of 15 

overtime.    The  Human  Resources  Department  is  responsible  for  determining  the  FLSA 
designation for each employee.  

B.  Prior Approval to Earn Compensatory Time or Overtime - Generally overtime is not 
authorized.  A non-exempt employee’s work schedule should be adjusted to ensure that 
the employee does not exceed 40 hours.  This is also referred to as flexing your time.  For 
example, an employee who must work 2 extra hours on Tuesday could leave 2 hours early 
on Friday so as not to exceed 40 hours that week.  However, a non-exempt employee must 
be compensated for overtime even if it was not approved in advance.  An employee who 
works  unauthorized  overtime  will  be  counseled  or  disciplined  just  as  with  any  other 
violation of Court policy.    

If overtime is required,  before earning compensatory time or overtime, employees must 
obtain approval from their supervisor.  

C.  Earning Overtime - Non-exempt employees earn overtime for time worked in excess of 
40 hours in a week.  To earn overtime, the 40 hours must be time actually worked.  Paid 
time off, such as holidays, vacation and sick leave, etc., do not count as time worked for 
calculating overtime.  For example, a non-exempt employee who actually works 44 hours 
during one work week earns 4 hours of overtime. 

D.  Earning Compensatory Time - Non-exempt employees earn straight compensatory time 
when paid hours exceed 40 in a work week but the employee has actually worked less than 
40 hours.  Once the total of actual hours worked reaches 40, the employee begins earning 
overtime.  

E.  Overtime Compensation - The Court compensates non-exempt employees for overtime 
by granting them paid time off at the rate of 1.5 hours for each overtime hour they earn.  
Paid time off for overtime should be used as the employee’s next scheduled leave.  Exempt 
employees do not earn overtime.  

A.  Types of Holidays – There are three types of holidays to which an employee is entitled: 
national, state, and optional.  Eligible employees are entitled to a paid day off from work 
on national and state holidays as specified by the Legislature. 

B.  Eligibility – Employees are entitled to paid day off from work on a specified holiday if:  

•  the holiday does not fall on a Saturday or Sunday; and  
•  the employee is not on Leave Without Pay.

C.  Skeleton Crew Days –  The Court will  have  a sufficient number of employees  on duty 
during  a  state  holiday  (skeleton  crew  day)  to  conduct  the  public  business  of  the  Court 
except  for  those  state  holidays  which  fall  on  a  Saturday  or  Sunday,  the  Friday  after 
Thanksgiving Day, and December 24th and 26th.  Supervisors may use their discretion in 
determining staffing requirements on skeleton crew days.  Employees who must work on 
a national or state holiday will accrue holiday compensatory time and will be allowed time 
off during the 12-month period following the date of the holiday worked.  Employees who 
work on skeleton crew days must report the number of hours worked on the Court’s Leave 
Request Form to receive credit for this time. 

D.  Optional Holidays – An employee is entitled to paid leave to observe an optional holiday 
(Cesar  Chavez  Day,  Rosh  Hashanah,  Yom  Kippur,  or  Good  Friday)  if  he/she  agrees  to 
relinquish a state holiday (skeleton crew day) during that same fiscal year.  If the employee 
fails to work a skeleton crew day in the same fiscal year, a day of vacation leave will be 
charged instead.  If no vacation leave is available, he or she will lose one day of pay. 

E.  Holiday  Before  Work  Begins  or  After  Work  Ends  –  An  individual  must  be  a  state 
employee on the workday before and after a designated holiday in order to be paid for that 
holiday, unless the holiday falls on the first or last workday of the month. 

F.  Part-time Employees – Part-time employees are entitled to the same holidays with pay 

(on a prorated basis) as granted to full-time employees.  

nnual Vacation Leave  

(See Texas Government Code 661.152)  
 

the specified requirements:  
 

A.  Eligibility – An employee is eligible to take annual vacation leave with pay after meeting 

•  an  employee  with  no  previous  State  employment  may  take  annual  leave  after 

completing six (6) full months of continuous employment with the Court; or  

•  an employee with previous state employment who has completed six (6) full months 
or  more  of  continuous  state  employment  and  whose  vacation  balance  has  been 
transferred from the other state agency is eligible to take the accrued annual leave 
upon employment; or  

•  an employee with previous State employment who has a break in service of at least 
30  days  and  has  completed  six  (6)  full  months  or  more  of  continuous  State 
employment may take annual leave as it is earned upon re- employment.  

B.  Rate of Accrual and Allowable Carry Forward – The schedule below shows rates of 
annual leave accrual for various lengths of State employment and the maximum number of 
hours an employee may carry forward each fiscal year beginning on September 1st. The 
schedule is based on full-time employment.

ick Leave  

  S

A.  General - Employees accrue sick leave at the rate of eight hours per month or a fraction of 
a month.  Sick leave may be used immediately upon employment when an employee is 
prevented  from  performing  his  or  her  job  due  to  sickness,  injury,  pregnancy  or 
confinement.  It may also be used to care for an  employee’s immediate family member 
who is ill.  Sick leave may be taken for a health care appointment for the employee or for 
members of the immediate family.   

An  absence  of  more  than  three  consecutive  days  requires  the  employee  to  provide  a 
doctor’s certification or an acceptable written statement of facts showing the nature of the 
illness.   

B.  Parent-Teacher Conference Leave - An employee may use up to eight hours of sick leave 
each fiscal year to attend parent-teacher conference sessions for the employee’s children 
who are in pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade.  The employee must give reasonable 
notice of his or her intention to use this leave. 

 

Page 8 of 15 

C.  Transfer of Sick Leave – If an employee makes a direct transfer to another state agency 
without a break in service, the sick leave balance will transfer to the receiving agency.  If 
there is a break in service, but the employee is re-employed by the State within 12 months, 
the employee may be entitled to restoration of sick leave balances  

D.  Unused Sick Leave Balance – Once an employee terminates employment with the State, 

the employee is not entitled to payment for any sick leave balance.  

E.  Sick  Leave  Upon  Death  –  In  the  event  of  employee  death,  one-half  of  the  sick  leave 
balance or 336 hours of sick leave, whichever is less, is paid to the employee’s estate if the 
employee was continuously employed at least six months at the time of death.  

ick Leave Pool 

(See Texas Government Code 661.002)  
 

A.  General - The Court has established a Sick Leave Pool to certain Court employees who 
have exhausted all paid leave due to a catastrophic injury or illness.  Catastrophic is defined 
as a severe condition or combination of conditions affecting the mental or physical health 
of the employee or the employee's immediate family that requires the services of a licensed 
practitioner for a prolonged period of time, and that forces the employee to exhaust all time 
earned by that employee and to lose compensation from the state.  Conditions qualifying 
for sick leave pool are generally of a life threatening nature. 

B.  Employee Leave Exhausted - An employee may apply to use sick leave from the Court 
Sick Leave Pool provided the catastrophic illness or injury will exhaust all leave, including: 

• Sick; 
• Annual (if available); and 
• Compensatory. 

C.  Eligibility for Sick Leave Pool - An employee may draw from the sick leave pool only 
with  the  approval  of  the  Court.    Supporting  documentation  from  a  medical  practitioner 
must  be  submitted  to  the  Court  containing  sufficient  information  to  allow  the  Court  to 
evaluate the employee's eligibility. 

An employee may not receive sick leave in excess of one-third of the total time in the pool 
or 90 days, whichever is less.  Employees have no right to Sick Leave Pool and the granting 
of it is discretionary. 

ndividual Sick Leave Contributions 
(See Texas Government Code 661.207)  

ourt employees may donate any amount of their accrued sick leave to another employee of the 
court.  However, the receiving employee must first expend all of their own accrued leave and any 
sick leave pool amounts that are available to them.

Family and Medical Leave 

 (See Texas Government Code 661.912)  

A.  Overview - The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows eligible employees to take 
unpaid leave, or to substitute appropriate paid leave, for an FMLA qualifying event without 
fear of being terminated from their jobs or being forced into a lower job upon their return. 
 

B.  Eligibility - Employees with 12 months of full-time employment and who have provided 
at least 1,250 hours of service during the 12 months before the leave are eligible to take up 
to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year for the following reasons: 

•  The birth or adoption of a child; 
•  The serious health condition of a spouse, child, or parent (such health condition must 

meet the conditions of a serious health condition under the FMLA) 

•  An employees’ own serious health conditions 

 

C.  Notice  and  Certification  -  If  the  need  for  family  and  medical  leave  is  foreseeable,  an 
employee seeking to use family and medical leave is required to provide a 30-day advanced 
notice  of  the  need  for  the  leave.    If  notice  cannot  be  provided  30  days  in  advance,  the 
employee should notify the Clerk of the Court as soon as practicable. 

An employee requesting leave for the employee’s serious health condition or the serious 
health  condition  of  the  employee’s  spouse,  child  or  parent  must  submit  a  medical 
certification from a physician within 15 days of a leave request.  The medical certification 
should  describe  the  serious  health  condition,  the  reason  the  condition  necessitates  the 
employee’s  absence  from  work  and  the  anticipated  duration  of  the  employee’s  absence 
from work. 

D.  Return to Work - At the end of an employee’s approved leave, they will be required to 
present a fitness-for-duty certification from their doctor releasing them to return to all job 
duties and responsibilities.  If certification is not received, the employee’s return to work 
may be delayed until certification is provided. 

Emergency Leave 
(See Texas Government Code 661.902)  

eath in Family - An employee is entitled to leave with pay for a death in the employee's family.  
An employee's family is defined as the employee's spouse, as well as the employee’s and spouse's 
parents, children, brothers, sisters, grandparents, and grandchildren. 
 

A.  Other Reasons - The Chief Justice of the Court may grant emergency leave to an employee 
for reasons other than bereavement if the employee shows good cause and intends to return 
to work when the emergency leave ends.  The granting of such leave is at the sole discretion 
of the Chief Justice and is granted only if it is determined to be in the best interest of the 
Court. 

Page 10 of 15

B.  Emergency  Leave  and  Workers  Compensation  -  The  Chief  Justice  may  authorize 
emergency  leave  pay  for  not  more  than  6  months  to  an  employee  receiving  worker's 
compensation benefits.  Payment will not exceed the difference between the employee's 
base  monthly  wage  and  the  monthly  amount  of  minimum  benefits.    If  payment  is 
authorized, the Chief Justice must attach a statement of the reason for the authorization to 
its payroll voucher for the first payroll period affected by the leave. 

C.  Requests - All requests for Emergency Leave should be submitted to the Clerk who will 

coordinate the request and granting of emergency leave with the Chief Justice. 

D.  Approval  -  Approval  for  emergency  leave  can  only  be  granted  or  denied  by  the  Chief 

E.  Reporting - By October 1 of each year, the Clerk is required to report to the Comptroller's 

•  The name and position of each employee who was granted more than 32 hours of 

emergency leave during the previous fiscal year. 

•  The reason for which the employee was granted emergency leave and 
•  The total number of emergency leave hours granted to the employee in that fiscal 

Justice.

training.  An employee is entitled to a maximum of five (5) working days of leave in a 
fiscal year.  This leave is in addition to other leave to which the employee is entitled. 

B.  Called to Duty – An employee who is a volunteer firefighter or an emergency medical 
service volunteer and is called to duty during working hours is entitled to emergency leave 
at the discretion of the administrative director.  It is expected that such service will not be 
a continuous disruption in the office.

B.  Request from Employee – Employees requesting Leave Without Pay must submit their 
request in writing to their supervisor.  If approved by the supervisor and the Chief Justice, 
the request will be forwarded to Human Resources.  The request must include a start date 
and an ending date.  The request must also include the reason for the request, and, if for 
medical reasons, it must include a doctor’s statement and any other detailed justification 
that adequately explains the reasons for the request. 

C.  Review by Administration – All requests for  Leave  Without Pay will  be  reviewed for 
approval by the Chief Justice.  Approval of the request is not automatic.  The requested 
leave time may be disapproved or adjusted to meet the business needs of the Court.  If the 
request is disapproved or adjusted, and the employee is unable or declines to remain on the 
job, the agency may take appropriate action to terminate employment.  

D.  Return to Work – Although approval of Leave Without Pay constitutes a guarantee of 
employment upon return, such a guarantee is subject to fiscal constraints.  Upon return to 
duty, the employee may be placed anywhere in the agency, and his/her salary level is not 
guaranteed.  Employees are expected to return to work immediately upon the expiration of 
the  approved  dates  for  Leave  Without  Pay,  unless  they  have  requested  and  received 
approval for an extension. 

E.  Failure to Return to Work – Failure to return to work from Leave Without Pay on the 
approved return date will be considered abandonment of position, and the agency may take 
appropriate action to terminate employment.  

F.  Exhausting  Available Paid Leave – All available  accumulated paid leave entitlements 
must be exhausted before granting Leave Without Pay, with the exception of leave as a 
result of disciplinary actions, active military duty, or Workers’ Compensation.  Sick leave 
must be exhausted before going on leave without pay status only if the leave is for a reason 
for which the employee is eligible for sick leave.  

G.  Leave Accruals and Insurance Premium – If an absence covers an entire calendar month, 
the employee does not accrue any vacation or sick leave.  The employee is also responsible 
for  payment  of  his/her  insurance  premiums  (unless  accepted  under  provisions  of  the 
FMLA).  A full or partial calendar month during which an employee is on leave without 
pay  does  not  constitute  a  break  in  continuity  of  employment.    Except  for  an  employee 
returning from military leave without pay, a full calendar month during which an employee 
is on leave without pay is not counted in computing total state service for purposes related 
to longevity pay or to the rate of accrual of vacation leave; or continuous state service for 
purposes related to merit salary provisions or vacation leave.  

H.  Exceptions  to  Policy  –  The  administrative  director  may  grant  exceptions  to  these 
provisions when it is deemed to be in the best interest of the State, such as when the leave 
is to work for another state  governmental entity under an interagency agreement, or for 
educational purposes.

without  a  break  in  service  are  eligible  to  have  their  vacation  and  sick  leave  balances 
transferred
