NONDISCLOSURE UNDER § 411.072, GOV’T CODE 

1 of 7 

REVISED FEBRUARY 2022 

The statute requires the court to determine whether you qualify for an order under 
Section 411.072 at the time  the court discharges and dismisses the proceedings 
against you under Article 42A.111, Code of Criminal Procedure. However, you must 
present evidence necessary to establish that you are eligible to receive the order 
and pay a $28 fee (this is not a filing fee) or submit a Statement of Inability to Afford 
Payment of Court Costs to the court before the court issues the order. 
 

As a general rule, you must pay a $28 fee before the court issues the 
order. However, you may be eligible to file a Statement of Inability to 
Afford Payment of Court Costs in lieu of paying the fee. The statement 
is described in Rule 145 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. The form 
for  the  Statement  of  Inability  to  Afford  Payment  of  Court  Costs  is 
available on the Office of Court Administration’s website at this link. 

ou may present evidence that you are eligible to receive an order of nondisclosure 
under Section 411.072 by completing and submitting the letter  provided below. 
You must complete the letter before submitting it to the court. The court will use 
the letter to determine your eligibility for the order. 

 proposed order for the order of nondisclosure is provided in these materials as 
well. You should submit the proposed order with the letter. The court will complete 
the proposed order if the court determines that an order should issue. 

equired Waiting Period 

f  the  court  finds  that  you  satisfy  the  requirements  for  an  order  under  Section 
411.072, the court cannot issue the order of nondisclosure until you have been on 
deferred adjudication for at least 180 days. Basically, the court is required to issue 
the order of nondisclosure as follows: 
 

•  If the court discharges and dismisses the proceedings against you on or after 
the 180th day that you have been on deferred adjudication, the court must 
issue the order of nondisclosure at the same time the court discharges and 
dismisses the proceedings against you; or  

•  If the court discharges and dismisses the proceedings prior to the 180th day 
that you have been on deferred adjudication, the court must wait until you

have been on deferred adjudication for 180 days before issuing the order of 
nondisclosure. On or after the 180th day, the court must issue the order as 
soon as practicable. 

ummary of Procedure 

f you are eligible for an order under Section 411.072, Gov’t Code, you should take 
the following steps: 
 

1.  Complete the letter below, and if 180 days have passed since you have been 
on  deferred  adjudication,  submit  the  letter  and  proposed  order  (Order  of 
Nondisclosure under Section 411.072) to the clerk of the court (hereinafter 
“clerk”); and 
 

2.  Pay $28 or submit a Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs. 
Ask  the  clerk  about  their  procedures  for  paying  the  fee  or  submitting  the 
statement. 
 

If the court has not already issued an order of nondisclosure, the court will review 
your letter and determine if you qualify for the order. If the court determines that 
you qualify for the order, the court will issue the order if you have paid the fee or 
submitted a statement of inability to pay. 

f the court grants the order of nondisclosure, the clerk will send a copy of the order 
to DPS no later than 15 business days after the order issues. After receiving the 
order,  DPS  has  10  business  days  to  seal,  not  delete,  the  criminal  history  record 
information that is subject to the order and to forward a copy of the order to the 
state  and  federal  agencies  listed  in  Government  Code  Section  411.075(b).  It  is 
important  for  you  to  know  that  some  agencies,  including  law  enforcement 
agencies,  will  still  have  access  to  the  information,  although  the  information  is 
sealed. You will find a list of such agencies at Government Code Section 411.0765.
