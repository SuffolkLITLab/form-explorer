ELEVENTH  COURT OF APPEALS 

EMPLOYEE LEAVE POLICY  
 
November  1, 2017 

 

This  policy and procedure  document  applies to all employees of the Eleventh  Court  of Appeals. 

 

  

                

                

 

       

ELEVENTH COURT OF APPEALS 

EMPLOYEE LEAVE POLICY 

eneral Policy Information 

This  policy  outlines  leave  benefits  and  reporting  requirements  for  Eleventh  Court  of  Appeals 
employees. Each court is required to keep a record of its employees’ accrual and use of annual and sick 
leave; and account for whether leave taken is for sick leave, annual leave, other paid leave, leave without 
pay, or other  absence.  This policy does not apply to elected officials or unpaid interns. 

.  OVERVIEW OF STATE OF TEXAS EMPLOYEE LEAVE SYSTEM 

 

The employee leave system is considered an "exception-based system of time-keeping."  That is, an 
employee  automatically  accrues  certain  types  and  amounts  of  leave  time  on  a  monthly  basis,  but  is 
expected  to  report  and  account  for  any  exception  to  the  accrual.    Each  employee  receives  a  monthly 
"Employee  Leave  Summary"  that  shows  the  employee’s  current  leave  balances  reported  to  the  state.  
Leave balances are calculated from the number of leave hours an employee has requested on the Request 
for Leave forms which apply to all employees. 

 
It is Eleventh Court policy that every employee must request approval from the Clerk of Court before 
being absent from work and a corresponding Request for Leave form must be signed by the Clerk of Court.  
Every employee has the responsibility to submit the signed Request for Leave form to the Clerk of Court 
to complete the necessary leave reports required by the State of Texas. 

 

hen an employee does not work 40 hours in a work week, and the Court has not been officially 
closed on a work day, a signed Request for Leave form must be submitted to the Clerk of Court to establish 
the amount of time excepted from that 40-hour work week. 
 

The Chief Justice is to sign Request for Leave forms for the Clerk of Court.

.  SPECIFIC TYPES OF STATE LEAVE 

1.  Annual Leave 

 

 

specified requirements: 

Eligibility – An employee is eligible to take annual vacation leave with pay after meeting the 

  an employee with no previous State employment may take annual leave after completing 

six (6) full months of continuous employment with Eleventh Court of Appeals; or 

  G

  A

  B

Time and Leave Policy 
 

  an employee with previous state employment who has completed six (6) full months or 
more of continuous state employment  and whose vacation balance has been transferred 
from the other state agency is eligible to take the accrued annual leave upon employment; 
or 

  an employee with previous State employment who has a break in service of at least 30 days 
and has completed six (6) full months or more of continuous State employment may take 
annual leave as it is earned upon re- employment. 

Rate of Accrual and Allowable Carry Forward – The schedule below shows rates of annual 
leave  accrual  for  various  lengths  of  State  employment  and  the  maximum  number  of  hours  an 
employee may carry forward each fiscal year beginning on September 1. The schedule is based on 
full-time employment. 

       

Employees accrue vacation from their first day of employment. They end this accrual on their last 
day of duty. Duty day means an employee’s last physical date on the job. An employee may not 
accrue vacation time while exhausting vacation time for termination purposes. 

An employee in a leave-without-pay (LWOP) status for  a  full  calendar  month  does  not  accrue 
vacation leave for that month. An employee on paid or unpaid leave which extends into a subsequent 
month does not earn accrued leave until he/she returns to work. 

Excess Balances – Excess annual leave balances above the amount that can be carried forward 

will be credited to the employee’s sick leave balances on the first day of the new fiscal year. 

A Request for Leave form must be signed by the Clerk of Court in advance of the use of accrued 

vacation time or as soon as is practicable.   
 

 
All  annual  leave  should  be  requested  by  email  to  the  Clerk  of  Court  as  soon  as  the  employee 
schedules a vacation.  This allows the dates to be entered on the Court calendar in order to prevent multiple 
absences on a given day.   

 

   

Time and Leave Policy 
 

       

A  State  employee  accrues  sick  leave  at  the  rate  of  8  hours  per  month  from  the  first  day  of 
employment.  Unused accrued sick leave can be carried forward annually.  Sick leave is available for an 
employee’s illness, injury, pregnancy and confinement, and for when an employee must care for a member 
of his or her immediate family who is actually ill.  

n employee who is absent from work due to an illness must notify the Clerk of Court at the earliest 
practicable time.  To be eligible for accumulated sick leave, with pay, for a continuous period of more 
than three working days, an employee must provide a doctor’s certification, or on the Request for Leave 
form,  must  provide  an  acceptable  written  statement  of  facts  about  the  absence.    For  less  than  three 
continuous days of sick leave without a reduction in pay, the Chief Justice and/or Clerk of Court has the 
discretion  to  require  a  doctor’s  certificate  or  on  the  Request  for  Leave  form,  an  acceptable  written 
statement of facts about the absence.  

or medical/dental appointments, an employee should first request approval to be absent from work, 
and then submit a Request for Leave form for the actual amount of time the employee was away from the 
office. 

.  Emergency Leave 

Death in Family – Employees are eligible for Emergency Leave due  to a death in the employee’s 
family.  The  employee’s  family  is  defined  as  the  employee’s  spouse,  and  the  employee’s  or  spouse’s 
parents, children, brothers, sisters, grandparents, and grandchildren.  

Leave  During  Agency  Investigation  –  The  administrative  director  may  grant  leave  without  a 

deduction in salary to an employee who is: 

  The subject of an investigation being conducted by OCA; or 

  A  victim  of,  or  witness  to,  an  act  or  even  that  is  the  subject  of  an  investigation  being 

conducted by OCA. 

The Eleventh Court of Appeals is required to report to the State Auditor’s Office and the Legislative 
Budget Board each quarter if an employee is granted 168 hours or more leave for being the subject of an 
investigation.  

Other Reasons – The Chief Justice or Clerk of Court may grant  Emergency Leave to an employee 
for reasons other than bereavement if the employee shows good cause and the Chief Justice or Clerk of 
Court believes in good faith that the employee intends to return to work when the emergency leave ends. 
The granting of such leave is at the sole discretion of the Chief Justice or Clerk of Court, and is granted 
only if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Court.  

Emergency Leave and Workers’ Compensation – The Chief Justice or Clerk of Court may authorize 
emergency  leave  pay  for  not  more  than  6  months  to  an  employee  receiving  workers’  compensation 
benefits.  Payment  will not  exceed the difference  between the employee’s  basic monthly wage and the 
monthly amount of minimum benefits. 

Requests – Requests for Emergency Leave should be submitted to the Clerk of Court for approval. 
The Eleventh Court of Appeals defines “reasonable time off” to mean not more than three (3) days away 
from the employee’s workstation.   

Approval – Approval for emergency leave can only be  granted or denied by the Chief Justice or

Reporting – By October 1 of each year, the Clerk of Court is required to report to the Comptroller’s 
Office: 

  The  name  and  position  of  each  employee  who  was  granted  more  than  32  hours  of 

emergency leave during the previous fiscal year; 

  The reason for which the employee was granted the emergency leave; and 

  The total number of hours of emergency leave granted to the employee in that fiscal year. 

4.  Foster Parent Leave 

Any Eleventh Court of Appeals employee who is a foster parent to a child under the conservatorship 
of the Department of Family and Protective Services is entitled to a leave of absence with full pay for the 
purpose of attending staff meetings held by the  DFPS regarding the child under the foster care of the 
employee, or to attend the Admission, Review and Dismissal (ARD) meeting held by a school district 
regarding the child. 

5.    Jury Duty 

 

 

Time off with pay is allowed to serve on a jury.  After receiving a jury summons, an employee should 
notify the Clerk of Court as soon as possible and provide a copy of the jury summons.  When the employee 
returns to work following jury duty, the employee should attach the proof of jury service received from 
the trial court to the Request for Leave and/or Weekly Time Sheet. 
 

6.    Military Duty Leave 

Paid leave is granted for various types of military service. 

7.    Parental Leave 

12 Week Maximum – Employees with fewer than 12 months of state service or less than 1,250 hours 
in the 12 months immediately preceding the start of leave are entitled to a parental leave of absence, not 
to exceed 12 weeks, for the birth of a natural child or the adoption or placement in foster care of a child 
under three years of age.  This period begins with the date of birth, or the first day the adoptive or foster 
child is formally placed in the home. The employee must use all available accrued leave before going on 
leave without pay while taking the parental leave. 

Notification – An employee anticipating using parental  leave should notify his/her supervisor and 
Human Resources at the earliest possible opportunity in order to allow ample time to plan for covering 
duties for the duration of the absence.  

FMLA Provisions – Parental leave is only available for employees who are not eligible for FMLA 

The Eleventh  Court encourages  all employees  to exercise their right  to  vote in  all elections and, 
pursuant  to  state  statute,  will  allow  an  employee  sufficient  time  off,  without  a  deduction  in  salary  or 
accrued leave, to vote in each national, state, and local election.  The Eleventh Court of Appeals defines 
“sufficient  time  off”  in  this  instance  to  mean  not  more  than  one  (1)  hour  away  from  the  employee’s 
workstation.

9.  Donation of Blood 

 

An employee is allowed sufficient time off with pay to donate blood up to four times in a fiscal year.  
The Eleventh Court of Appeals defines “sufficient time off” in this instance to mean not more than three 
(3) hours away from the employee’s desk.   

efore an employee takes time off to donate blood, a request for the time off must be approved in 
writing by the Clerk of Court.  On returning to work, an employee shall provide proof that the employee 
donated  blood  during  the  time  off.    If  an  employee  fails  to  provide  proof  of  the  blood  donation,  the 
Eleventh Court shall deduct the amount of time for which the employee was granted time off from the 
employee’s salary or accrued leave, whichever the employee chooses.  TEX.  GOV=T CODE 661.917. 

0.      Employee Training/MCLE  
 

The  time  that  an  employee  is  allowed  for  attendance  at  training  or  minimum  continuing  legal 

education (MCLE) seminars is time for which the employee receives pay. 

C.    COMPENSATORY TIME 

1.   Working More Than 40 Hours a Week 

 

 

The Fair Labor Standards Act applies to Texas employees.  This means that a non-exempt employee 
is entitled to compensation for any hours worked in excess of 40 hours in one work week.  Compensation 
may be in the form of either 1.5 hours credited per each hour worked in excess of 40 hours of compensatory 
time or, at the discretion of the employing state entity, pay at the rate of 1.5 times the regular pay in effect 
for the employee when the excess time was worked.  The Eleventh Court’s overtime policy only allows 
for the possibility of earning compensatory time off under specific pre-approved circumstances; earning 
additional pay for overtime is not available.   

n employee may only work 8 hours a day, unless the Chief Justice or Clerk of Court has approved 
a prior written request for work time in excess of 8 hours.  Such written request must provide a detailed 
explanation of the reason(s) the employee finds it necessary to work longer than the usual work day, that 
is,  why the employee has been unable to  complete the work during the regular hours during the  work 
week.  When the employee claims compensatory time earned this way, the pre-approved authorization 
must be attached to the Request for Leave form. 

aid leave or holidays taken during a work week are not counted as hours worked in determining 
FLSA overtime hours.  Any compensatory time earned must be used within twelve months of the end of 
the work week in which it was earned, or the employee loses the time.  The Eleventh Court also requires 
an employee to exhaust any FLSA overtime hours before using annual leave.  

ompensatory time off for exempt employees is within the discretion of the Chief Justice and/or 

Clerk of Court.

.   Working National or State Holidays 

 

For each fiscal year, the State of Texas publishes a list of three types of holidays:  national, state, 
and optional.  An employee is entitled to a paid day off from work for each national or state holiday that 
does not fall on a Saturday or Sunday, and if the employee is not on unpaid leave.  

he Eleventh Court is officially closed on all national holidays, the Friday after Thanksgiving Day, 
and December 24th and December 26th, when those days fall on a weekday.  Days designated as state 
holidays are considered Skeleton Crew Holidays when the Court is open and is required to have enough 
employees on duty to conduct its official business. 

n employee who works a Skeleton Crew Holiday is entitled to compensatory time off during the 
12-month period following the date worked.  Employees are required to give reasonable advance notice 
when taking this compensatory time, although the reason for the request is not required.  The Request for 
Leave form must state the date of the Skeleton Crew Holiday being claimed for comp time. 

very year, the State designates some religious holidays such as Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and 
Good  Friday  that  fall  on  week  days  as  Optional  Holidays.    An  employee  may  substitute  an  Optional 
Holiday for a Skeleton Crew Holiday during the same fiscal year as the Optional Holiday worked.  The 
Request for Leave form must state the Optional Holiday being substituted for the Skeleton Crew Holiday.   

 

 

    
In addition, the Chief Justice and/or Clerk of Court may allow an employee to observe Cesar Chavez 
Day as a state holiday, instead of another state holiday that falls on a weekday when the agency must 
remain open for business at minimum staffing levels (i.e. a Skeleton Crew Holiday).

FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT (FMLA) 

The Department of Labor’s Fact Sheet 28 describes the rights and responsibilities of the employer 
and employee under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Additional information may be found 
on the Department of Labor posters on bulletin boards in the break rooms.  General information is set out 
below. 
 

1.  Purpose of FMLA 

FMLA requires an employer to provide an eligible employee with up to 12 workweeks of unpaid, 
job-protected  leave  during  a  12-month  period  of  time  for  certain  family  and  medical  reasons.    An 
employee who takes FMLA must be returned to the same job, or a job with equivalent status, benefits, 
and pay. 
 

2.  Availability of FMLA Unpaid Leave 

An eligible employee may take a total of 12 weeks unpaid FMLA leave for: 

D. 
 

 

   

 

  The birth of a son or daughter or placement of a son or daughter with the employee for   

adoption or foster care;  

  To care for a spouse, son, daughter, or parent who has a serious health condition;  
   For a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential 

Time and Leave Policy 
 

       

functions of his or her job; or  

   For any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that a spouse, son, daughter, or parent 

is a military member on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status.  

.  Serious Health Condition 

condition that involves: 
 

A  serious  health  condition  is  defined  as  an  illness,  injury,  impairment,  or  physical  or  mental 

 
 

inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential care facility; 
the  absence  of  more  than  three  calendar  days  from  work  that  also  involves  continuing    
treatment by a health care provider; 

  any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for prenatal care; 
  a chronic serious health condition (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.); 
  a  period  of  incapacity  that  is  permanent  or  long-term,  due  to  a  condition  for  which 

treatment may not be effective (e.g., Alzheimer’s, stroke, terminal diseases); 

  any absences to receive multiple treatments that would likely result in incapacity for more 
than  three  consecutive  days  if  left  untreated  (e.g.,  chemotherapy,  physical  therapy, 
dialysis, etc.). 

.  Intermittent Leave or a Reduced Work Schedule 

FMLA permits the use of intermittent leave or work on a reduced schedule when: 

  medically necessary to care for a seriously ill family member, or because of the employee’s 

 

serious health condition or 
to  care  for  a  newborn  or  newly  placed  adopted  or  foster  care  child,  if  approved  by  the 
employer.

5.  State of Texas and the FMLA 

      a. Use of Paid and Unpaid Leave 

A State of Texas employee is entitled to FMLA leave if the employee has a total of at least 12 
months  of  state  service  and  has  worked  at  least  1,250  hours  during  the  12-month  period 
immediately preceding the commencement of leave.  A State employee is required to utilize 
all available paid vacation and sick leave while taking FMLA unpaid leave.  Paid and unpaid 
leave are exhausted concurrently, not consecutively.   

owever, when an employee on FMLA leave is also receiving temporary disability benefits 
payments  or  workers’  compensation  benefits,  the  employee  is  not  required  to  utilize  paid 
vacation or sick leave concurrently with the FMLA leave.  TEX. GOV=T CODE ANN. 661.912 
Family and Medical Leave Act. 

  H

b.  Health Insurance During FMLA Leave 

When  all  paid  leave  has  been  exhausted,  the  State  will  continue  to  pay  its  portion  of  the 
employee’s  premium  for  coverage  under  the  group  health  plan.    During  the  unpaid  FMLA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Time and Leave Policy 
 

leave period, the employee must pay his or her portion of the insurance premium above the 
state-paid portion.  If an employee fails to return to work after taking FMLA leave, the State 
may recover the health care premiums it paid on behalf of the employee.  

c. Effect of FMLA Leave 

Service credit, annual leave, or sick leave is not earned for any full calendar months of leave 
without pay while on FML.  This time is also not included in the calculation of the number of 
continuous months of employment for purposes of merit increases and leave. 

6.  Eleventh Court of Appeals and the FMLA 

a. Method Used to Calculate Eligibility 

Eligibility  for  the  12-week  leave  period  is  calculated  for  the  12-month  period  measured 
forward from the date any employee’s first FMLA leave begins.  

. Designation of Leave and Notice by Employer 

The  Eleventh  Court  must  designate  leave,  paid  or  unpaid,  as  FMLA-qualifying  and  will 
provide  notice  to  the  employee  of  the  designation.    Once  the  Eleventh  Court  has  acquired 
knowledge  that  the  leave  is  for  an  FMLA  reason,  the  employee  will  be  notified  that  any 
applicable accrued paid leave will be designated as FMLA leave, will be reported in the State’s 
timekeeping system as FMLA leave, and the leave will be counted against the 12-week FMLA 
leave entitlement.   

otice of the designation should be provided to the employee within two business days.  Leave 
cannot  be  retroactively  designated  as  FMLA  leave,  unless  the  employee  was  absent  for  an 
FMLA reason and the Eleventh Court did not learn the reason until the employee’s return to 
work. 

c. Notice by the Employee 

When the need for FMLA leave is foreseeable, the employee is required to provide a written 
30-day advance notice before the leave is to begin.  The notice should include the anticipated 
timing and duration of the leave.  Notice must also be provided as soon as practicable if the 
dates of the leave change, are extended, or were not initially known.  When the need for FMLA 
leave is not foreseeable, notice must be provided "as soon as practicable" under the particular 
circumstances. As soon as practicable means under the particular circumstances, but, at the 
least, verbal notice should be provided within two business days of when the need for leave 
becomes known to the employee. 

hether  the  need  for  FMLA  leave  is  foreseeable  or  not,  the  employee  should  provide 
information  sufficient  to  make  the  Eleventh  Court  aware  that  the  employee  needs  FMLA-
qualifying leave, the anticipated timing and the duration.  Failure to provide notice, with no 
reasonable excuse for the delay, may delay the taking of FMLA leave until at least 30 days 
after the date the employee provides the required notice.

Time and Leave Policy 
 

       

he Eleventh Court of Appeals may inquire further, if it is necessary to have more information 
about the need for the leave.  Any medical information the employee provides will be stored 
in the employee’s confidential medical file and kept separate from the personnel file.  

d. Standard Leave Forms Required 

 

 

In addition  to  providing  notice, an employee is  required to  complete the  Eleventh  Court of 
Appeals’s standard leave forms and follow its procedures for taking leave.   

e. Medical Certification Required for Serious Health Condition 

For a serious health condition, the Eleventh Court of Appeals requires a medical certification 
confirming that such a condition exists.  Once leave has been granted, the employee may be 
required to provide updated medical information on a periodic basis.  To return to work when 
an absence was caused by a serious health condition, the employee must provide a "fitness-
for-duty" certificate from the health care provider. 

  T

 

f. Health Insurance 
 

Once the employee is on unpaid FMLA leave, to continue coverage under the State’s group 
health plan, the employee must make arrangements with the Clerk of Court to pay his or her 
portion of the employee’s health insurance premium.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
