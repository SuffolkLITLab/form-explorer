      <pre>FOURTH COURT OF APPEALS 

INTERNAL OPERATING PROCEDURES 

FOR THE HANDLING OF CASES 

Applicability 

Seniority 

“By Lot” 

These Internal Operating Procedures for the Handling of Cases apply to all civil 
and  criminal  proceedings  filed  in  the  Fourth  Court  of  Appeals  except  appeals 
arising  under the Parental  Notification  Act,  which are  governed by  that  Act and 
sections 2, 4, and 16 of these rules only. 

The chief justice is the senior justice. The seniority of a justice is determined by the 
date the justice joined the court. If two or more justices join the court on the same 
date, their seniority relative to one another will be determined by lot. 

Whenever these rules provide that assignment shall be “by lot,” the responsibility 
for making the assignment by lot is entrusted to the clerk of the court. In making an 
assignment by lot, the clerk of the court may decide the procedure to be employed. 

“Justice” and “Participating Justices” 

When “justice” and “justices” is used in these rules (other than in section 2), it refers 
both to the court’s chief justice and justices. 

A “participating justice” is a justice (including any visiting justice assigned to the 
case) who is not recused or disqualified from considering whether to grant en banc 
consideration or reconsideration or participating in en banc review in a particular 
case. 

Court Records 

a. 

Public Records 

Unless made confidential by law, the court’s opinions, judgments, and orders are 
public records. The original briefs and other papers filed in a case, clerks’ records, 
and reporters’ records are public records unless sealed by order of the trial court in 
accordance with Rule 76a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, by another court 
in accordance with other law, or by other law.

Not Public Records 

 
c. 

 

 

 

 

 

The rotation lists and assignment sheets maintained by the clerk of the court; drafts 
of  opinions,  judgments,  and  orders;  memoranda;  individuals’  notes;  and 
documents,  including  electronic  records,  reflecting  circulation  of  and  votes  on 
motions and drafts of opinions, judgments, and orders are confidential and must not 
be placed in the public record. 
 
Sealed Records 

If a record is sealed, the clerk of the court must: 

i. 

ii. 

ensure the record remains sealed to all unauthorized persons; and 

issue  a  letter  warning  the  litigants  and  their  attorneys  that  the  record  is 
sealed in this court. 

Failure to Pay Filing Fee 
 
 

If a document is tendered for filing without the appropriate filing fee, notice will be 
sent to the filer.  If the filing fee is not paid within ten days after the date notice is 
sent, the staff attorney assigned to the case will be notified. 

Alternative Dispute Resolution  

Local Rule 2 provides that “[o]n a party’s motion, or on the Court’s own initiative 
after  reviewing  the  docketing  statement,  the  Court  may  refer  a  civil  case  to 
alternative dispute resolution.”  On the motion of any party, the Court may facilitate 
referrals of civil cases to alternative dispute resolution. 
 

 

 

 
Assignment of Monitoring Justice 
 
When an ordinary appeal (which includes a restricted appeal for purposes of these 
Internal  Operating  Procedures)  or  non-parental  termination  accelerated  appeal  is 
filed, it must be assigned to a justice in rotation in order of seniority to monitor. 

 
Monitoring Panels 
 
a. 
 
 

When “an appeal of a suit for termination of the parent-child relationship or a suit 
affecting the parent-child relationship filed by a governmental entity for managing 
conservatorship” is  filed, see TEX. R. JUD. ADMIN. 6.2, reprinted in TEX. GOV’T 
CODE ANN., tit. 2, subtit. F app., (a parental termination appeal), the appeal must 
be immediately assigned to a panel and authoring justice in accordance with section 
9.c. The assigned panel and authoring justice will oversee both the monitoring and 
submission of the parental termination appeal. Unless stated differently below or 
required by statute, the monitoring and submission process in a parental termination 
appeal will be handled as an accelerated appeal.

b. 

Definitions Used during Monitoring 

In ordinary appeals and non-parental termination accelerated appeals, the justice to 
whom an appeal is assigned for monitoring purposes is the “monitoring justice”; 
the monitoring justice’s staff attorney is the “monitoring attorney”; the “monitoring 
panel” is the monitoring justice and the next two justices in order of seniority who 
are not recused or disqualified; and the “monitoring period” is the period of time 
beginning with the date the appeal is filed and ending on the date that a submission 
panel is assigned to the appeal in accordance with section 9.  In parental termination 
appeals, the  “monitoring justice” is the authoring justice assigned in accordance 
with section 9.c; the “monitoring attorney” is that justice’s staff attorney assigned 
to the case; the “monitoring panel” is the panel assigned in accordance with section 
9.c; and the “monitoring period” is the period of time beginning with the date the 
appeal is filed and ending on the date that the appeal is submitted. 

c. 

Jurisdiction Checks 

i. 

ii. 

iii. 

 

 

As soon as practicable after the monitoring attorney’s receipt of the clerk’s 
record, the monitoring attorney must complete a jurisdiction check. 

When  conducting  a  jurisdiction  check,  the  monitoring  attorney  must 
determine whether the record was sealed by the trial court and notify the 
clerk of the court accordingly, so the letter required by section 5.c.ii may be 
sent. 

If  the  monitoring  attorney  determines  that  the  court  does  not  have 
jurisdiction over  the appeal, so that  it must be dismissed,  the monitoring 
attorney must prepare an appropriate opinion, order, and/or judgment. 

(1) 

(2) 

In a criminal case, if a notice of appeal is filed more than one year 
after it was due, the appeal may be dismissed without first issuing a 
show cause order; if the notice of appeal was filed less than one year 
after  it  was  due,  the  appeal  may  not  be  dismissed  without  first 
issuing  a  show  cause  order  and  affording  the  appellant  an 
opportunity to respond. 

In a civil case, if a notice of appeal is filed no more than fifteen days 
after  the date it was due, the monitoring panel must  issue  a show 
cause  order  and  afford  the  appellant  an  opportunity  to  provide  a 
reasonable explanation for the late filing. 

d. 

Certification in Criminal Appeals 

If the trial court’s certification states and the record reflects that the appellant does 
not have the right to appeal, the monitoring justice must issue a show cause order 
and afford the appellant an opportunity to respond before dismissing the appeal. 

3 
 

Revised 2023 

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

 

 

Conversely, if the trial court’s certification states that the appellant does not have 
the right to appeal but the record reflects that the appellant does have the right to 
appeal,  the  monitoring  justice  must  issue  an  order  affording  the  trial  court  an 
opportunity to amend its certification. 

e. 

Failure to File Appellate Record 

If a clerk’s record is not filed because the appellant failed to pay or make 
arrangements to pay the clerk’s fee for preparing the record, the monitoring 
attorney  must  determine  whether  the  record  reflects  that  the  appellant  is 
indigent. 

If the record establishes that the appellant is indigent, the monitoring justice 
must issue an order stating that appellant is indigent and ordering the clerk 
to file the clerk’s record. 

If the record establishes that the appellant is not indigent or fails to establish 
indigency, the monitoring justice must issue an order affording appellant at 
least ten days to show that the clerk’s fee has been paid or that appellant is 
entitled  to  proceed  without  payment  of  costs.  If  appellant  fails  to  file  a 
satisfactory  response  within  the  time  ordered,  the  monitoring  panel  may 
dismiss the appeal for want or prosecution. 

iv. 

If neither the appellate record nor a notification of late record is timely filed 
in a parental termination appeal, the monitoring justice may issue an order 
directing the district clerk and/or court reporter to file the record within ten 
days of the date of the order. 

All  motions  filed  during  the  monitoring  period  (except  motions  for 
extensions of time in which to file briefs, which the clerk is authorized to 
rule  on  by  the  administrative  order  attached  as  Appendix  1)  must  be 
delivered immediately after filing to the monitoring attorney. 

All motions filed during the monitoring period, except the motions specified 
in  section  8.f.iii,  must  be  either  promptly  ruled  upon  by  the  monitoring 
justice  in  accordance  with  Rule  10.3(a)  of  the  Texas  Rules  of  Appellate 
Procedure or, if necessary, carried with the case. 

iii. 

A motion must be submitted to the monitoring panel if: 

(1) 

The ruling on the motion will dispose of the appeal; 

(2) 

The motion will be disposed of with a written opinion;

Motions 

   

   

   

   

 

   

   

   

   

   

   

 

 

(3) 

The monitoring justice votes to grant a motion to extend the time in 
which to file a brief in excess of ninety days from the date the brief 
was originally due; or 

(4) 

The ruling on a motion/petition will grant a permissive appeal even 
if the motion/petition is an agreed motion/petition. 

If a motion requiring immediate action must be submitted to the monitoring 
panel  and  one  of  the  justices  on  the  monitoring  panel  is  unavailable,  the 
motion must be submitted to the next justice in order of seniority until the 
required  number  of  signatures  has  been  obtained.  This  substitution  is 
limited to the motion that requires immediate action and does not otherwise 
affect the monitoring panel.  

If a ruling on a motion that must be submitted to the monitoring panel will 
not  dispose  of  the  appeal,  it  may  be  ruled  upon  by  only  two  justices  in 
exceptional circumstances. 

vi.  Motions that may be ruled upon by a single justice pursuant to section 8.f.ii 
must be disposed of by a written order. Motions that require a ruling by a 
panel pursuant to section 8.f.iii must be disposed of by a written order or an 
opinion, as a majority of the panel deems appropriate. 

g. 

Briefs 

When a party’s brief is filed or an amicus brief is received, the fact of its 
filing or receipt must be entered into the court’s case management system 
and  the  brief  delivered  to  the  monitoring  attorney  as  soon  as  practicable 
after filing. 

After receiving a brief, the monitoring attorney must review it to ensure that 
it complies with Rule 38 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure. 

If  a  brief  “flagrantly”  violates  Rule  38  of  the  Texas  Rules  of  Appellate 
Procedure,  a  written  order  requiring  it  to  be  amended,  supplemented, 
redrawn, or stricken in accordance with Rule 38.9(a) of the Texas Rules of 
Appellate Procedure may be issued by the monitoring panel. 

When the response brief in an ordinary appeal has been filed or the time for 
filing a response brief has expired, the monitoring attorney must review the 
briefs to determine whether oral argument has been properly requested by 
any party and, if so, whether to recommend that the appeal be submitted 
with oral argument or on briefs in accordance with the criteria set forth in 
section 11.a.iii.

After  the  review  described  in  the  preceding  subsection,  the  monitoring 
attorney must  forward the briefs and recommendation to the  clerk of the 
court, who must calendar the case for submission in accordance with the 
monitoring  attorney’s  recommendation  at  the  earliest  practicable  date  in 
accordance with the procedures set forth in section 9. 

In non-parental termination appeals, if a party fails to request oral argument 
on the cover of its brief but later files a motion requesting oral argument, 
the motion must be held in abeyance until the appeal has been assigned to a 
submission  panel.  When  the  case  is  assigned  to  a  submission  panel,  the 
panel must rule on the motion as soon as practicable and communicate its 
ruling  to  the  clerk  of  the  court,  who  must  set  the  case  for  submission  in 
accordance with the panel’s vote at the earliest practicable date. 

Submission  panels  for  ordinary  appeals  are  assigned  at  the  beginning  of 
each calendar year using a court-approved time series matrix. 

Non-Parental Termination Accelerated Appeals 

Except as otherwise provided in section 10.c, when a response brief in an 
accelerated appeal has been filed or the time for filing a response brief has 
expired, the case must be assigned to a submission panel, with the authoring 
justice  being  the  next  justice  in  rotation  in  order  of  seniority  and  the 
remaining panel members selected by the clerk of the court in accordance 
with the appropriate assignment sheet. 

 

ii. 

The clerk of the court shall be responsible for maintaining the rotation list 
and the assignment sheet for non-parental termination accelerated appeals. 

Parental Termination Appeals 

i. 

A parental termination appeal must be assigned to a single panel for both 
monitoring and submission. Upon receipt of a notice of appeal in a parental

Disposition  of  Ordinary  Appeals  and  Non-Parental  Termination  Accelerated 
Appeals during the Monitoring Period 

If the monitoring panel determines that an ordinary appeal or non-parental 
termination accelerated appeal should be dismissed or otherwise determined 
before the appeal is assigned a submission panel in accordance with section 
9,  the  monitoring  panel  shall  be  the  panel  that  dismisses  or  otherwise 
determines  the  appeal,  and  the  monitoring  justice  shall  be  the  authoring 
justice.

justice  being  the  next  justice  in  rotation  in  order  of  seniority  and  the 
remaining panel members selected by the clerk of the court in accordance 
with the appropriate assignment sheet. 

If,  before  a  panel  has  been  assigned  in  a  parental  termination  appeal,  a 
request  for  emergency  relief  is  pending  and  the  justice  who  should  be 
assigned to author the opinion is not available, the next justice in the rotation 
list will serve as the authoring justice; in that event, authorship in the next 
parental  termination  appeal  filed  after  the  previously  unavailable  justice 
becomes available must be assigned to the justice who was unavailable. 

iii. 

The clerk of the court shall be responsible for maintaining the rotation list 
and the assignment sheet for parental termination appeals. 

d. 

Original Proceedings 

Except as otherwise provided in section 10.c, upon receipt of a petition in 
an original proceeding, the case must be assigned to a submission panel, 
with  the  authoring  justice  being  the  next  justice  in  rotation  in  order  of 
seniority and the remaining panel members selected by the clerk of the court 
in accordance with the appropriate assignment sheet. 

If, before a panel has been assigned in an original proceeding, a request for 
emergency  relief  is  pending  and  the  justice  who  should  be  assigned  to 
author the opinion is not available, the next justice in the rotation list will 
serve as the authoring justice; in that event, authorship in the next original 
proceeding filed after the previously unavailable justice becomes available 
must be assigned to the justice who was unavailable. 

The clerk of the court shall be responsible for maintaining the rotation list 
and the assignment sheet for original proceedings. 

A  motion  filed  in  an  original  proceeding  must  be  delivered  immediately 
after filing to the staff attorney assigned to assist the authoring justice with 
the original proceeding. 

A motion requesting a first extension of time to file a response or reply brief 
in an original proceeding may be granted with the approval of the authoring 
justice only. 

All motions, other than motions requesting a first extension of time to file a 
response  or  reply  brief,  in  an  original  proceeding  must  be  ruled  upon  or 
voted to be taken under advisement by the panel members within five days 
of submission of the motion to the panel.  If a ruling on a motion will not 
dispose of an original proceeding, and if the motion has been submitted to 
the panel for more than five days and has not been ruled upon or voted to

upon or ordered to be taken under advisement by only two panel members. 

In  addition  to  the  preceding  subsection,  if  a  ruling  on  a  motion  will  not 
dispose of an original proceeding, it may be ruled upon by only two panel 
members in exceptional circumstances. 

If a motion requires immediate action and the required number of votes has 
not been obtained because one or more panel members is unavailable, the 
motion must be submitted to the next justice not on the panel in order of 
seniority  until  the  required  number  of  votes  has  been  obtained.    This 
substitution is limited to the motion that requires immediate action and does 
not otherwise affect the panel assigned to the original proceeding. 

A proposed order requesting a response in an original proceeding must be 
approved  or  disapproved  by  the  panel  members  within  five  days  of 
circulation of the proposed order to the panel by the authoring justice or the 
staff  attorney  assigned  to  assist  the  authoring  justice  with  the  original 
proceeding.  An order requesting a response in an original proceeding may 
issue with the approval of only two panel members if the order requesting a 
response has been pending with the panel for more than five days and one 
of the panel members has not approved or disapproved the order. 

A motion filed in an original proceeding must be disposed of by a written 
order or an opinion, as a majority of the panel deems appropriate. 

e. 

Panels for Oral Argument Outside Bexar County 

A panel for oral argument outside Bexar County must be constituted in the same 
manner as set forth above in section 9.a.i. 

f. 

Visiting Justice Panels 

With the approval of a majority of the court, the chief justice may ask the 
chief  justice  of  the  Texas  Supreme  Court  to  appoint  a  visiting  justice  to 
assist in the handling of the court’s docket. 

If a visiting justice is assigned, the unassigned justice and another justice 
selected by lot shall sit on a panel with the visiting justice. 

The clerk must attempt to equalize the number of visiting justice panels to 
which justices are assigned. 

g. 

Periods of Service 

i. 

Panels  serve  for  two-month  periods,  which  are:  September-October, 
November-December,  January-February,  March-April,  and  May-June.  In

addition, the court may, by majority vote, decide to submit cases in July and

panels. Panels for July and August shall be constituted from those justices 
who have not opted out as set forth above in section 9.a.i. 

 

ii. 

Panels for oral argument outside Bexar County serve only the day or days 
designated for oral argument in that county. 

h. 

Acceleration of Appeal 

If a monitoring panel orders that an ordinary appeal be accelerated, either on motion 
or on the court’s own initiative, the monitoring panel shall be the panel that decides 
the merits of the appeal, and the authoring justice must be determined by lot.

Substitution of Panel Members 

Upon  the  reasonable  request,  disqualification,  or  absence  of  a  submission  panel 
member, the unassigned justice for the month in which a case is to be submitted 
shall sit for the absent panel member. If the unassigned justice cannot sit, another 
justice selected by lot shall sit in place of the absent panel member. If the absent 
panel  member  was  assigned  to  author  the  opinion,  the  sitting  justice  will  be 
responsible  for  writing  that  opinion  unless  the  panel  by  majority  vote  agrees 
otherwise.  All  changes  in  the  composition  of  panels  and  authorship  of  opinions 
must be immediately reported to the clerk of the court and entered into the court’s 
case management system. 

k. 

Newly Appointed or Elected Justice 

i. 

ii. 

 

iii. 

On cases set for submission on briefs and those already submitted on briefs, 
a newly appointed or  elected justice  replaces the justice  whose place the 
newly appointed or elected justice has assumed. 

On  cases  set  for  submission  with  oral  argument,  a  newly  appointed  or 
elected  justice  replaces  the  justice  whose  place  the  newly  appointed  or 
elected justice has assumed only if (a) oral argument has not yet been heard 
or (b) oral argument has been heard but the other two justices assigned to 
the case cannot agree on a judgment. 

On remand of a case by a higher court for further proceedings, whether the

Submission Docket 

 

ii. 

Not later than forty-five days before the submission date for a given month, 
the clerk of the court must prepare a draft submission docket to include all 
ordinary appeals ready for submission.  To the extent possible, the clerk of 
the court will equalize the number of oral argument cases and the number 
of on briefs cases each submission panel will draw. 
 
Docket Draw 

To the extent possible, the clerk of the court will cause the oral argument 
cases, whether civil or criminal, to be drawn evenly among the justices on 
the submission panels.  Thereafter, to the extent possible, the clerk of the 
court will cause the civil on briefs cases, followed separately by the criminal 
on briefs cases, to be drawn evenly among the justices on the submission 
panels. 

b. 

Accelerated Appeals and Original Proceedings 

Non-parental  termination  accelerated  appeals,  parental  termination  appeals,  and 
original  proceedings  shall  be  assigned  to  submission  panels  in  accordance  with 
section 9. 

c. 

Related Matters 

In an effort to promote greater efficiency and judicial economy, any panel assigned 
to a matter, i.e., an ordinary appeal, accelerated appeal, or original proceeding, shall 
have  the  discretion  to  determine  that  another  matter  pending  in  the  court  is 
sufficiently  related  to  the  assigned  matter  such  that  the  same  panel  should  be 
assigned  to  the  related  matter.    When  a  panel  determines  that  two  matters  are 
sufficiently related, the senior justice of the panel shall instruct the clerk to assign 
the same panel to the related matter, and the same justice shall author both matters. 
If a different panel has been assigned to the related matter before the matters are 
determined to be related, the clerk of the court shall remove the panel assigned to 
the related matter. If the related matter is an original proceeding or an accelerated 
appeal, and the justice assigned to author the related matters is not the justice who 
was originally assigned to be the authoring justice pursuant to section 9, authorship 
of the next original proceeding or accelerated appeal ready for submission must be

i. 

ii. 

Assignment of authorship to a particular justice must be kept confidential 
until the court’s opinion is issued. 

The  clerk  of  the  court  must  make  an  effort  to  ensure  that  each  justice  is 
assigned to author an equal number of opinions in ordinary appeals, non-
parental  termination accelerated  appeals, parental termination accelerated 
appeals, and original proceedings. 

A case may be submitted without oral argument if the panel, after examining 
the briefs, decides oral argument is unnecessary for any of the reasons set 
forth in Rule 39.1 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure. 

For  ordinary  appeals,  after  a  submission  panel  and  authoring  justice  has 
been assigned, a motion requesting an extension of time to file a reply brief 
may be granted with the approval of the authoring justice only.  For non-
parental  termination  accelerated  appeals,  after  a  submission  panel  and 
authoring justice has been assigned, a motion requesting a first extension of 
time to file a reply brief may be granted with the approval of the authoring 
justice only.  For parental termination appeals, after submission, a motion 
requesting a first extension of time to file a reply brief may be granted with 
the approval of the authoring justice only. 

Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  section  9.j  and  section  10.c,  after 
preparation of the draft submission docket for ordinary appeals, but before 
submission, authorship of opinions shall be assigned to a particular justice 
randomly by lot. 
 
Within ten days after authorship has been assigned in ordinary appeals on 
the draft submission docket, each panel must meet to review the briefs and 
determine  whether  to  accept  the  monitoring  attorney’s  recommendation 
regarding oral argument. 

 
If the panel agrees with the monitoring attorney’s recommendation, 
no action is required.

responsible  for  preparing  the  docket  of  all  changes  to  the  draft 
submission docket. 

(3) 

After both panels have reported any changes, the clerk of the court 
must notify the parties of the date of submission, the members of the 
panel, and whether the case will be submitted with oral argument or 
on briefs. 

Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  section  10.c,  authorship  of  opinions  in 
accelerated appeals shall be assigned in accordance with section 9. 

When the response brief in an accelerated appeal has been filed or the time 
for filing a response brief has expired, the authoring justice will recommend 
to the panel whether the appeal should be submitted with oral argument or 
on briefs. 

Upon receipt of the recommendation identified in the preceding subsection, 
each justice on the panel must vote whether to submit the appeal with oral 
argument or on briefs. 

After the panel has voted on whether to submit the accelerated appeal with 
oral  argument  or  on  briefs,  the  authoring  justice’s  staff  attorney  must 
forward the panel’s vote to the appropriate deputy clerk, who must calendar 
the case for submission in accordance with the panel’s vote at the earliest 
practicable date. 

In parental termination appeals where both sides waived oral argument, the 
case may be submitted on briefs with the approval of the authoring justice 
only. 

Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  section  10.c,  authorship  of  opinions  in 
original proceedings shall be assigned in accordance with section 9. 

If, at any point before submission, a justice on an original proceedings panel 
recommends  to  the  panel  that  the  appeal  should  be  submitted  with  oral 
argument, each justice on the panel must vote whether to submit the appeal 
with oral argument or on briefs. 

If the panel holds a vote in accordance with the preceding subsection, the 
staff  attorney  assigned  to  assist  the  authoring  justice  with  the  original 
proceeding must forward the panel’s vote to the appropriate deputy clerk, 
who must calendar the case for submission in accordance with the panel’s 
vote at the earliest practicable date.

appropriate meeting date. 

b. 

Post-Submission Conference 

If a case is orally argued, it must be discussed at a post-submission conference held 
as soon as practicable after oral argument. 

c.  

Three-Month Post-Submission Conference 

Each  panel  shall  schedule  a  three-month  post-submission  conference,  to  be

Preparation, Circulation, and Issuance of Opinions 

3. 

  1

a. 

Preparation and Circulation of Opinion 

Unless the panel members agree otherwise, the justice assigned to author an opinion 
must  prepare  and  electronically  circulate  a  draft  majority  opinion  to  the  other 
members of the panel. 

i. 

ii. 

iii. 

In  ordinary  appeals,  the  authoring  justice  should  place  a  draft  majority 
opinion into circulation within three months of the submission date. If the 
authoring justice fails to do so, the other two panel members may call for a 
conference and, by a majority vote of the panel, transfer authorship to either 
of the other two panel members.  

In accelerated appeals, the authoring justice should place a draft majority 
opinion into circulation as soon as practicable.  If the authoring justice of 
an accelerated appeal fails to place a draft majority opinion into circulation 
within three months of the submission date, the other two panel members 
may  call  for  a  conference  and,  by  a  majority  vote  of  the  panel,  transfer 
authorship to either of the other two panel members. 

In original proceedings, the authoring justice should place a draft majority 
opinion into circulation as soon as practicable.  If the authoring justice of 
an original proceeding fails to place a draft majority opinion into circulation 
within  three  months  of  the  date  the  original  proceeding  commenced  or

within three months of the date the last timely-filed responsive brief was 
filed,  whichever  is  later,  the  other  two  panel  members  may  call  for  a 
conference and, by a majority vote of the panel, transfer authorship to either 
of the other two panel members. 

b. 

Publication Designation 

c. 

Ten-Day Review Period 

Although  a  publication  designation  is  required  in  opinions  in  criminal  appeals, 
opinions in civil appeals must not contain a publication designation. 

Within ten days of receipt of a draft opinion (“the ten-day review period”), the other 
members of the panel must electronically vote.  

i.  

ii. 

iii.  

Within the ten-day review period, a panel member may prepare a concurring 
or dissenting opinion and circulate it electronically to the authoring justice 
and  the  other  member  of  the  panel.  After  the  authoring  justice  has 
electronically voted (by indicating that he or she has made changes to the 
draft  majority  opinion  or  read  the  concurring  or  dissenting  opinion),  the 
remaining  member  of  the  panel  must  electronically  vote  on  the  draft 
majority opinion and the draft concurring or dissenting opinion. 

If  a  justice  does  not  vote  on  the  draft  opinion  within  the  ten-day  review 
period,  the  authoring  justice  must  promptly  call  a  panel  conference  to 
discuss any concerns held by the justice who has not yet voted. 

If neither of the panel members concurs in the judgment proposed by the 
authoring  justice  or  if  a  panel  member  desires  major  revisions  to  a  draft 
opinion, the panel members must promptly notify the authoring justice, who 
must call a panel conference. At this conference, the panel members must 
attempt to resolve their differences. If the attempt fails, a vote must be taken. 
If the authoring justice is in the minority, the remaining panel members must 
decide which of them will author the new majority opinion. 

d. 

Issuance after Thirty Days 

If a dissenting, concurring, or undecided justice has not voted on a draft majority 
opinion  for  more  than  thirty  days  from  the  date  the  draft  majority  opinion  was 
placed  into  circulation,  the  authoring  justice  may  call  a  conference  to  discuss 
issuance of the opinion  without the dissenting,  concurring,  or undecided  justice. 
After the conference and in accordance with section 13.f, the authoring and joining 
or concurring justice may issue the opinion with an appropriate notation, such as 
“Dissent to Follow.”

After the panel members have finalized their opinion(s), the assigned legal assistant 
must  e-mail  the  panel  members’  opinion(s)  to  the  other  justices.  If  all  justices 
indicate by e-mail that they do not object to immediate issuance of the opinion(s), 
the  opinion(s)  may  issue  in  accordance  with  section  13.f;  otherwise,  no  opinion 
may issue until the expiration of twenty-four hours after the date and time of the e-
mail (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays). The chief justice has the 
discretion to exempt an opinion from the 24-hour review or to shorten the 24-hour 
review period. At any time within the 24-hour period, any justice may forward his 
or  her  suggestions,  concerns,  or  questions  to  the  panel  members.  Receipt  of  a 
suggestion, concern, or question does not obligate the panel members to modify 
their opinion(s). 

Issuance of Opinions 

Opinions  must  be  issued  and  posted  on  the  court’s  website  on  Wednesdays  and 
such other days as a panel (or the justices participating in en banc consideration or 
reconsideration)  by  majority  vote  may  direct.  Opinions  also  may  be  issued  and 
posted  on  the  court’s  website  on  the  last  working  day  of  the  month,  with  the 
approval of the authoring justice only, if needed but not as a matter of course.

When a response is requested to a motion for rehearing and when the motion for 
rehearing  is  ruled  upon,  the  assigned  attorney  must  prepare  and  circulate  an 
appropriate  order;  and  the  clerk  must  mail  a  copy  of  the  order  to  the  parties  in 
compliance with Rule 12.6 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure.

If a motion for rehearing is accompanied by a separate motion for en banc

reconsideration and a copy of the panel’s original opinion (if not included 
as an appendix to one of the motions), and a copy of the panel’s proposed 
revised opinion, if any, must be electronically circulated first to the panel’s 
authoring  justice,  then  to  the  original  panel  members,  and  then  to  the 
remainder of the participating justices. 

(1)  Each  panel  member  must  electronically  vote  to  grant  or  deny  the 
motion for rehearing and to approve or reject the panel’s proposed 
revised opinion, if any. 

(2)  Each  participating  justice  must  vote  to  grant,  deny,  or  request  a 
response to the motion for en banc reconsideration.  If a majority of 
the  justices  vote  to  deny  the  motion  for  en  banc  reconsideration 
because  a  revised  panel  opinion  will  be  issued,  the  order,  which 
should  issue  on  the  same  date  as  the  revised  opinion,  must  state: 
“Because the panel has issued a different opinion, the motion for en 
banc reconsideration is DENIED AS MOOT. See TEX. R. APP. P. 
49.5.” 

If a motion for en banc reconsideration is not accompanied by a motion for 
rehearing, the motion for en banc reconsideration and a copy of the panel’s 
opinion  (if  not  included  as  an  appendix  to  one  of  the  motions)  must  be 
electronically circulated  first to the panel’s authoring justice and then to 
the original panel members.  After the panel has voted, the motion must 
then  be  electronically  circulated  to  the  remainder  of  the  participating 
justices.  Each participating justice must vote to grant, deny, or request a 
response to the motion for en banc reconsideration.

If a participating justice votes to grant a motion for en banc reconsideration, 
he or she must prepare and circulate a memorandum indicating the basis for 
his or her vote; the memorandum may simply refer to the issue upon which 
en banc reconsideration should be granted and the appropriate pages in the 
motion for en banc reconsideration. 

If  three  justices  vote  to  request  a  response  to  a  motion  for  en  banc 
reconsideration, the motion for en banc reconsideration and response must 
be re-circulated for another vote after the response is filed. 

After each participating justice has voted to either grant or deny a motion 
for en banc consideration or reconsideration, an order reflecting the court’s 
vote must be sent to the parties or to their attorneys. 

Any  justice  may  request  en  banc  consideration  or  reconsideration  in  any 
case at any time within the court’s plenary power by requesting a meeting 
to discuss whether the court should consider or reconsider the case en banc 
or  by  preparing  and  circulating  a  memorandum  explaining  the  reason  or 
reasons  that  en  banc  consideration  is  “necessary  to  secure  or  maintain 
uniformity of the court’s decisions” or “extraordinary circumstances require 
en banc consideration.”  TEX. R. APP. P. 41.2(c). 

If on the court’s own initiative a majority of the participating justices grant 
en banc consideration or reconsideration, an order reflecting the court’s vote 
must  be  sent  to  the  parties  or  their  attorneys.    If  a  majority  of  the 
participating justices vote to deny en banc consideration or reconsideration 
on the court’s own initiative, no order is required. 

After all participating justices have voted, the authoring justice of the panel 
opinion must notify all participating justices of the outcome of the vote.  If 
a motion for reconsideration has been denied, participating justices have 72 
hours to notify the authoring justice if they intend to file a written dissent to 
the denial. 
 
If a motion for en banc reconsideration is granted, the authoring justice on 
the panel must call a meeting of all justices within ten days. 

Each  participating  justice  must  determine  whether  he  or  she  approves  or 
disapproves the panel’s majority opinion. 
 
If a majority of the participating justices disapprove of the panel’s majority 
opinion, they must decide among themselves which of them will author an 
en banc opinion.

Concurring or Dissenting Opinion 

Any participating justice may concur in or dissent to the grant or denial of a motion

consideration or reconsideration on the court’s own initiative, with or without an 
opinion. If a participating justice authors a concurring or dissenting opinion, the

ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER 

1.  SCOPE—This order governs notices of late record and extensions of time to file records 
and briefs in ordinary, restricted, and accelerated appeals, except for “an appeal of a suit 
for  termination  of  the  parent-child  relationship  or  a  suit  affecting  the  parent-child 
relationship filed by a governmental entity for managing conservatorship.”  See TEX. R. 
JUD. ADMIN.  6.2,  reprinted  in  TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN.,  tit.  2,  subtit.  F  app.,  (a  parental 
termination appeal).  

2.  DUE DATE—For purposes of this order, the “due date” for records and briefs is the date 
on which the record or brief was initially due under Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 
35.1 (civil records), 35.2 (criminal records), or 38.6 (briefs).  
 

3.  NOTICE OF LATE RECORD 

.  If a record is not received by the due date in a civil case, the Clerk must send to the 
responsible official a “notice of late record.”  See TEX. R. APP. P. 37.3(a)(1).  If a record

time, in part, for thirty days after the record’s due date in ordinary and restricted appeals 
and  for  ten  days  after  the  record’s  due  date  in  non-parental  termination  accelerated

time until thirty days after the brief’s due date in ordinary and restricted appeals; 
if the motion requests an extension of time for a period in excess of thirty days, 
the Clerk is authorized to attest to a per curiam order granting the extension of 
time,  in  part,  for  thirty  days  after  the  brief’s  due  date.    In  non-parental 
termination accelerated appeals, the Clerk is authorized to attest to per curiam 
orders granting a first motion for extension of time until twenty days after the 
brief’s  due  date;  if  the  motion  requests  an  extension  of  time  for  a  period  in 
excess of twenty days, the Clerk is authorized to attest to a per curiam order 
granting the extension of time, in part, for twenty days after the brief’s due date.  
All opposed motions are sent to the monitoring staff attorney. 
 

b.  Second motions for extension of time that are not actively opposed: The Clerk 
is  authorized  to  attest  to  per  curiam  orders  granting  a  second  motion  for 
extension  of  time  until  sixty  days  after  the  brief’s  due  date  in  ordinary  and 
restricted appeals, with the approval of the monitoring staff attorney.  In non-
parental termination accelerated appeals, the Clerk is authorized to attest to per 
curiam orders granting a second motion for extension of time until forty days 
after the brief’s due date, with the approval of the monitoring staff attorney.  All

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
