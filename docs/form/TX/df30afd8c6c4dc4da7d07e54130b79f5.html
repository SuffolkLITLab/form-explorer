State Statutes regarding firearms & 
domestic violence
• A person subject to a protective order, including a magistrate’s emergency order 
of protection, may not possess a firearm if he/she has received notice of the 
order (unless the person is an active, sworn, full-time, paid peace officer). (Penal 
Code Sec. 46.04(c)). 

• Also a violation of condition of bond and new offense under Penal Code Sec. 25.07(a).

• Court may prohibit person from possessing firearm in a protective order (Family 

Code Sec. 85.022(b)(6)).

• Statute does not give court clear authority to prohibit person from possessing firearm in temporary ex 

parte protective order – “court may direct a respondent to do or refrain from doing specific acts.” (Family 
Code Sec. 83.001)

• However, both protective order and temporary ex parte protective orders must 
contain language in the order that states that it is unlawful for a person subject 
to a protective order to possess a firearm or ammunition. (Family Code Sec. 
85.026). 

• This same warning must be on protective orders for victims of sexual assault, human trafficking, and 

stalking. (Code Crim. Proc. 7A.06)

• Magistrate issuing emergency protective order shall suspend license to carry a 

handgun that is held by the defendant. (CCP 17.292(l))

• In a protective order issued for victims of sexual assault, or abuse, stalking, or 

trafficking under CCP 7A, the court may suspend license to carry a handgun held 
by the defendant. (CCP 7A.05(c))

State Statutes regarding Firearms & 
Domestic Violence

• Convicted of domestic violence, including for dating partner, cannot possess firearm 
for 5 years after release from confinement following conviction or release from 
community supervision, parole, mandatory supervision, whichever is later. (Class A 
misdemeanor) – Penal Code Sec. 46.04

• Court shall notify person convicted of domestic violence of the fact that it is 

unlawful to possess or transfer firearm or ammunition. (Code Crim. Proc. Art. 
42.0131)

• Before accepting a plea in a misdemeanor involving family violence, court shall
admonish defendant, orally or in writing, with specific language about unlawful 
possession of firearm. (Code Crim. Proc. Art. 27.14(e))

• Citations issued for Class C offenses involving domestic violence are required to have 
language warning of unlawful possession of firearm. (Code Crim. Proc. Art. 14.06(b))

• No law requires surrender of firearms or ammunition by domestic abusers who have 
become prohibited from possessing firearms or ammunition under federal or state 
law. 

OFFICE of COURT ADMINISTRATION

Legislation from 85th Session

• SB 325 – Protective Order Registry

• Requires OCA, in consultation with DPS and the courts, to establish and 

maintain a centralized Internet based registry for protective order 
applications filed and protective orders issued in Texas, including a 
magistrate’s order for emergency protection. Limited access by the public 
if the victim opts in. 

• HB 1528 – Family Violence Class C Appearances

• Requires Class C misdemeanants charged with offenses that involve 

family violence to appear in person. 

• Prior to 9/1, defendants could plea online or by mail and therefore, they 

did not have to submit fingerprints that go to DPS.

• Because individuals were not required to appear in person, they were 
also not receiving proper notice that they were ineligible to possess 
firearms. 

• SB 1804 – Law Enforcement Access to DV Bond Conditions 

(Vetoed) 

• Would have provided law enforcement access to bond conditions for 

domestic violence suspects.

Areas for Improvement in Reporting

• Automation

• Computer system compatibility
• Case management system

• OCA received funding for FY 2020-21 for uniform case management 

system focused on counties under 20K

• Lack of standardized forms and orders
• Inability to verify records in NICS

• NICS queries records from 3 databases, making it difficult for courts 
and other agencies to verify the number of records available to the 
system. 

• Continued need for training on data entry

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
