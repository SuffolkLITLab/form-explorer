Zoom Hearing Account Setup Instructions 

1.  Open the Invitation from Zoom in your email account. 
2.  Click the button labeled “Activate Your Zoom Account.” 
3.  The system will take you to a website that allows you to “Sign in with Google,” “Sign in with 
Facebook,” or “Sign up with a Password.” OCA recommends that you click “Sign up with a 
Password.” 
If you “Sign up with a Password,” the system will ask you for your name and a password that 
meets the listed criteria. Once you enter the password and confirm the password, click 
“Continue.” 

4. 

5.  The system will provide a “Personal Meeting URL.” Please take note of this web address. 
6.  Click “Go to My Account.” 
7.  On the Profile tab, you can review the settings for your account. Unless you are in the Mountain 
Time Zone, you likely need to make no changes. If you are in the Mountain Time Zone, you may 
need to edit the time zone on this page by clicking “Edit” and making the change. 

Zoom Scheduled Hearings Instructions (Recommended) 

1.  To use Zoom for scheduled hearings: 

a.  Click the “Meetings” button on the left panel. (This may or may not be necessary – you 

may just need to skip to step 2). 

b.  Click the “Schedule a New Meeting” button near the top. 
c.  Fill in the information on the Schedule a Meeting page, as appropriate. 

i.  Topic – OCA recommends listing some identifier for the hearing, such as the 

ii.  Description – This is optional but can be used to enter additional information 

case number, docket type, etc. 

about the proceeding. 

iii.  When – Enter the date and time of the proceeding. Zoom only allows scheduling 
on the half hour. If the hearing is set to start at a time that is not on the half 
hour, set the start time to the half hour preceding the time of your hearing. 

iv.  Duration – Enter an estimated length of the proceeding. 
v.  Meeting ID: Generate Automatically. Never use your personal Meeting ID.  
vi.  Video – Recommended Defaults: Host to On and Participant to On 
vii.  Recommended Meeting Options: 

1.  Default Setting: “Mute Participants upon Entry” – this will keep 

everyone muted until they are unmuted by you. 

2.  Default Setting: “Enable Waiting Room” – This will hold everyone in the 

meeting in a waiting room until you invite them in. This will be 
particularly helpful with dockets of people. 

3.  (Optional) Click “Breakout Room pre-assign” – this will allow you to 
preassign parties/lawyers to specific breakout rooms for private 
consultation. A breakout room allows the parties/lawyers to move to 
the room for a conversation and to re-enter the room when they are 
done. This feature allows you to preassign those rooms. Please note 
that you can move them to breakout rooms spontaneously during the 
meeting, which will permit the same feature. 

4.  (Optional) Click “Record the meeting automatically” – this will produce a 

recording of the meeting that can be played later. 

a.  Recommended – you will be given an option to record “On the 
local computer” or “In the cloud.” We recommend in the cloud, 
as the recordings may fill up your hard drive quickly. By 
recording in the cloud, the space will be elsewhere and still 
accessible by you. 

5.  (Optional) Interpretation – Click “Enable language interpretation” if you 

expect a need for an interpreter during the hearing. 

a.  The system will prompt you for an email address and language 
choices (from – to) for the interpreter. The system will send an 
invitation to the interpreter to join as an interpreter. 

i.  Read more about and schedule OCA’s Spanish 

interpreters who can join via Zoom at 
https://www.txcourts.gov/tcris/. 

b.  Once in the hearing, you’ll be able to assign an interpreter at the 

bottom of the page and choose the language for that 
interpreter. When you click “start,” the system will switch the 
interpreter to that language channel. Individuals in the hearing 
can choose the language in which they want to hear the 
proceeding. The interpreter is allowed to switch between the 
languages for interpreting between languages. 

d.  Click the “Save” button at the bottom of the page. 
e.  On the Manage page that pops up next, you should consider additional information: 
i.  (Optional) - You can add the hearing meeting to a Google Calendar, Outlook 

Calendar, or Yahoo Calendar by clicking the appropriate button. 

ii.  (Mandatory) – You should click “Copy the invitation” from the right side of the 

screen to share with participants in the hearing. 

1.  After clicking the “copy the invitation” link, it will bring up a pop-up 

screen that allows you to “Copy Meeting Invitation”. After clicking that 
button, the text will be saved to your clipboard, and you will be able to 
paste the invitation into an email for sending to participants by pressing 
Ctrl+V or Command+V. You can click cancel afterward. 
2.  You should paste the text into an email to the participants, 
iii.  (Optional) - After you get the settings on your hearing meeting correct, you 
should consider saving the meeting template settings for future hearings by 
clicking “Save as a Meeting Template.” 

iv.  When you are ready to start the meeting, click “Start this Meeting.” If the 

hearing is for a future date, you do not need to click this. Rather the meeting 
will show up in your scheduled meetings. 

2.  When you start your first meeting, the system will install the Zoom application. It will then ask 

whether you want to “Join with Computer Audio” or by clicking at the top via “Phone Call.” OCA 
recommends joining with computer audio, but you may choose a phone call by clicking “Phone 

 

 

 

Call” at the top of the screen and calling one of the numbers listed and entering the meeting ID 
and participant number. 

3.  Once you join the meeting, other participants who join will be placed into a waiting room. If you 

click “Manage Participant” at the bottom of the screen, you can see the list of individuals 
wanting to enter the meeting. You can choose to admit certain persons or admit all. All 
individuals will enter the meeting with their audio muted, so you will need to unmute them by 
clicking Unmute on the individual or unmute all. 

a.  Recommended: OCA recommends that you admit on those parties that are necessary 

for the hearing in progress. 

b.  You may move participants back into the waiting room by clicking on More near their 

name and moving them to waiting room. 

4.  To initiate live streaming that provides the public with access to your hearings (to comply with 
the constitutional Open Courts provision), click on the “…More” at the bottom of the page and 
click “Live on Facebook” or “Live on Youtube.” Recommended: OCA recommends that you 
stream “Live on Youtube.” See separate instructions for establishing a YouTube channel for 
your court. 

a.  LIVE ON YOUTUBE - After clicking “Live on Youtube”, you may be asked to log in to the 
correct account with the court Youtube Channel. If you are already logged in to the 
appropriate Google account on the computer it is using, it will default to that Youtube 
channel. 

i.  The popup will ask for the Zoom Meeting Title on Youtube, which you can 
modify as appropriate. Then you can choose the privacy of the video. For 
purposes of making the video available to the public, choose public. 

ii.  Then click “Go Live.” The system will begin the process of making the video and 
audio in the meeting live on the Youtube Channel. The video/audio is delayed 
about 20-30 seconds. 

1.  One the proceeding is Live on Youtube, a notation will appear in the 

upper left of the Zoom meeting screen. A down arrow at that area will 
allow you to Stop the Livestream, View the Livestream, or Copy the 
Livestream Link. 
If you stop the livestream, you will need to repeat the steps to restart 
the livestream. 

2. 

Zoom Host a Meeting Instructions to Start Hearing Now (Less 
Recommended) 

1.  To start a hearing now without scheduling (the scheduling function will allow you to start a 

hearing now even with scheduling and applies default settings): 

a.  Click “Host a Meeting” at the top of the screen. A drop down menu will allow you to 
choose “With Video On” or “With Video Off.” OCA recommends “With Video On.” 

2.  When you start your first meeting, the system will install the Zoom application. It will then ask 

whether you want to “Join with Computer Audio” or by clicking at the top via “Phone Call.” OCA 
recommends joining with computer audio, but you may choose a phone call by clicking “Phone 

3. 

Call” at the top of the screen and calling one of the numbers listed and entering the meeting ID 
and participant number. 
Invite participants by clicking “Invite” at the bottom of the screen. You should click the Email tab 
at the top of the pop-up that appears. You can choose to sent the invitation by an email 
application or click “Copy URL” or “Copy Invitation” at the bottom of the pop-up to paste into 
another email application. 

4.  Once participants receive the invitation, they will be able to automatically join the proceeding. 
5.  To initiate live streaming that provides the public with access to your hearings (to comply with 
the constitutional Open Courts provision), click on the “…More” at the bottom of the page and 
click “Live on Facebook” or “Live on Youtube.” Recommended: OCA recommends that you 
stream “Live on Youtube.” See separate instructions for establishing a YouTube channel for 
your court. 

a.  LIVE ON YOUTUBE - After clicking “Live on Youtube”, you may be asked to log in to the 
correct account with the court Youtube Channel. If you are already logged in to the 
appropriate Google account on the computer it is using, it will default to that Youtube 
channel.

purposes of making the video available to the public, choose public. 

ii.  Then click “Go Live.” The system will begin the process of making the video and

upper left of the Zoom meeting screen. A down arrow at that area will 
allow you to Stop the Livestream, View the Livestream, or Copy the 
Livestream Link. 
If you stop the livestream, you will need to repeat the steps to restart 
the livestream. 

2. 

Utilizing the Breakout Rooms 
There may be times where parties wish to confer outside of the “online courtroom.” Examples might 
include attorney-client communications or probation-defendant communications after a plea. The Zoom 
breakout function is good for this purpose. You can find the Breakout Rooms button at the bottom of 
the screen or by clicking on the More button. The system will allow you to establish the number of 
breakout rooms. For more information on breakout room functionality, visit 
https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206476313-Managing-Breakout-Rooms.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
