Introduction 

 

I 

NTRODUCTION 
 An  appeal  is a  request  for  a  higher  court  to  review  a  lower  court’s  decision.    You 

may wish to file an appeal if you have lost your case in the trial court.  You may also find 

yourself  involved  in  appellate  proceedings if an  opposing  party  seeks  to  overturn  your 

victory  in  the  trial  court.    Legal  appellate  work  is 

complicated.    We  strongly  advise  you  to  hire  or 

consult  a  licensed  attorney  if  you  can  afford  one.    If 

you  cannot  afford  an  attorney,  and  you  are  not 

entitled  to  court-appointed  counsel,  then  you  may 

choose to proceed pro se.

Appellate Procedure  

The  guidelines  and 
rules  governing 
the 
appellate process 

 

Everyone  has  the  right  to  represent  themselves 

in  a  Texas  court.  But,  be  aware  that  pro  se 

litigants  are  held  to  the  same  standards  as 

licensed  attorneys  and  are  required  to  follow  the 

Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure (TRAP).  Pro se representation carries many risks.  

Failure  to  follow  the  rules  can  result  in  fines,  sanctions,  or  the  dismissal  of  the  case.  

Review the rules here: http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/rules/traphome.asp.  

  

The  Texas  Young  Lawyers  Association  Pro  Se  Appellate  Guide  is  designed  to 

educate pro se litigants about appellate procedure and help them through the appellate 

process.  Do not assume that all the requirements of an appeal are set out in this guide.  

This guide is only a general overview of appellate procedure, and in no way stands in 

place of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure or legal representation.

The fourteen Courts of Appeals have jurisdiction over civil and criminal appeals.  Each 

Court of Appeals has jurisdiction in a specific geographical region  of the State.  If you 

are  filing  the  appeal,  make  sure  it  is  brought  in  the  appellate  court  having  jurisdiction 

over the region that the trial court sits in by contacting the appellate clerk.

     TEPS IN AN APPEAL  

The  non-comprehensive  chart  below  depicts  some  of  the  common  steps  that  a 

pro se litigant will go through during the process of an appeal.  We advise you to review 

the chart and the TRAP to ensure your compliance with the rules.  You are required to 

file  certain  documents  with  the  trial  court  and  others  with  the  appellate  court  having 

jurisdiction over your appeal.   A red box is an action taken in or by the trial court and a 

blue box is action taken in or by the appellate court.

Indigent Status 
 

 

I 

NDIGENT STATUS 
An  indigent  party  is  one  who,  after  making  a  good  faith  effort,  cannot  pay  for  the 

appellate filing fee, appellate record, or for counsel on appeal.  If a court finds a party 

indigent, it may not have to pay for certain costs associated with the appeal.  Below, we 

answer common questions pro se litigants have about determinations of indigence.  

When must I apply for indigent status? 

A party must submit an affidavit of indigence to the 

trial  court  clerk,  before  or  at  the  same  time  as  a 

notice for appeal.  This means a party typically has 

(1)  either  30  days  after  trial  court  signs  the  final 

Affidavit 

A  voluntary  declaration 
of facts written down and 
sworn to by the declarant 
before 
officer 
an 
authorized  to  administer 
oaths,  such  as  a  notary 
public 

judgment, or (2) 90 days if a motion for new trial was filed to apply for indigent status.  If 

a party misses the (much shorter) deadline to file an affidavit of indigence, he may be 

ordered to pay costs associated with the appeal, and can face dismissal of the appeal if 

these costs are not timely paid.  See page 46 for a current schedule of filing fees.  

How do I establish indigent status? 

In a civil case, a party can establish indigence in the following three ways:  

1.  By Affidavit; 

•  A party may proceed without advance payment if (1) it files an affidavit of 

indigence in compliance with TRAP 20.1; (2) the claim of indigence is not 

contested or if contested, the court finds for the party claiming indigence; 

and (3) the party files a timely notice of appeal. 

 

 

9 

 

 

• 

If  an  affidavit  of  indigence  is  filed  in  conjunction  with  either  a  certificate 

from Interest of Lawyers Trust Accounts (ILTA) or Texas Access to Justice 

Foundation (TAJF) it becomes uncontestable. 

2.  By Certificate; 

•  A  party  may  proceed  to  trial  without  prepaying  the  associated  costs  if  it 

has a certificate from ILTA or the TAJF stating that the party was screened 

for eligibility to receive free legal services.  

3.  By Presumption of Indigence; 

 

• 

If  a  parent  is  found  indigent  by  the  trial  court  during  a  suit  in  which 

termination of the parent-child relationship or managing conservatorship is 

requested, the parent retains this status throughout the suit.   

What is in an affidavit of indigence? 

An affidavit of indigence is an affidavit swearing that a party is unable to pay the costs 

associated with a trial or appeal.  An affidavit of indigence must include the name of the 

party  filing  the  affidavit  and  what  amount  in  court  costs  the  party  could  pay.    Indigent 

status is determined on a party’s present ability to pay, not future ability.  However, if a 

court  later  deems  that  a  party  who  has  received  indigent  status  can  pay, it  may  order 

the  party  to  pay  as  much  as  possible.    Additionally,  the  following  information  must  be 

included in an affidavit of indigence: 

•  Nature and amount of all the party’s current income; 

• 

Income of the party’s spouse and whether or not it is available to the party; 

 

10 

 

 

•  Real  (i.e.  land  or  houses)  and  personal  property  (i.e.  cars,  TVs,  etc.)  the  party 

•  Cash the party holds and amounts on deposit that the party may withdraw; 

owns; 

•  Other assets; 

•  Number and relationship to party of any dependents; 

•  Nature and amount of the party’s debts; 

•  Nature and amount of the party’s monthly expenses; 

•  Party’s ability to obtain a loan for court costs; 

•  Whether  an  attorney  is  providing  free  legal  services  to  the  party  without  a 

contingent fee; and 

•  Whether an attorney has agreed to pay or advance court costs. 

Can I appeal a finding that I am not indigent? 

If a trial court’s order finds against a party applying for indigence, that party can appeal 

the order by filing a motion challenging the order within 10 days of the date the order  is 

signed  or  within  10  days  of  filing  the  notice  of  appeal,  whichever  is  later.    See  TRAP 

20.1(j).  

If I am found indigent by the court what do I have to pay? 

The amount that an indigent party has to pay depends on the indigent classification that 

they are given.  If the court finds no payment status then the court fees and fee for the 

clerk’s and reporter’s record will be waived.  However, if a court finds a party is able to 

partially  pay,  it  will  give  partial  payment  status.    If  a  party  receives  partial  payment 

 

11 

 

 

status then it must pay the amount set by the court.  

Can the court appoint legal counsel for me? 

The  trial  court  can  appoint  legal  counsel  on  appeal  in  misdemeanor  criminal  cases 

facing  confinement  and  all  felony  criminal  cases.    In  a  civil  proceeding,  the  court  can 

only appoint legal counsel in a suit filed by a government entity in which termination of 

the parent child relationship or appointment of a conservator for a child is requested.  In 

any other civil matter, a litigant will have to provide legal counsel or appear pro se.  

How do I obtain court appointed legal counsel? 

In a criminal case, if the trial court has found the defendant indigent for purposes of trial, 

the court will appoint legal counsel on appeal if requested and if the trial court finds the 

defendant indigent for purposes of appeal.  

In  civil  proceeding,  dealing  with  one  of  situations  listed  above  the  court  will  appoint 

counsel upon a finding of indigence. 

What guidelines will the trial court use to determine if I am indigent? 

Each Texas county has guidelines and financial standards that it applies to determine 

whether a party is indigent.  To get a better understanding of your county’s Indigent 

Determination Standards, visit http://tidc.tamu.edu/IDPlan/ViewPlan.aspx?PlanID.   

 

 

12 

A notice of appeal is a short statement filed with the trial court clerk stating that a party 

is dissatisfied with the trial court’s judgment and wants to appeal the decision.  Failure 

to file a timely notice of appeal will lead to dismissal of the appeal.  

How long do I have to file a notice of appeal? 

A party must file a notice of appeal in civil cases within 30 days after the trial court signs 

the judgment.  However, a party has: 

•  90 days to file a notice of appeal if any party timely files: 

Notice of Appeal 

TICE OF APPEAL 

  O

N 

 

 

o  A motion for new trial; 

o  A motion to modify the judgment; 

o  A motion to reinstate; or 

o  A request for findings of fact and conclusions of law; 

•  only 20 days to file a notice of appeal in an accelerated appeal; 

•  6 months to file a notice of appeal in a restricted appeal; 

•  only 14 days to file a notice of cross-appeal after another notice of appeal is filed 

or within the appropriate time period if it meets the qualifications above. 

What do I have to file in my notice of appeal? 

The notice of appeal must include, per TRAP 25.1(d), the following:  

 

 

13 

 

 

1.  Identity of the trial court;  

2.  The case’s trial court number; 

3.  Style (who sued who);  

4.  Date of the judgment or order being appealed from; 

5.  State that the party desires to appeal the decision 

6.  State the name of the Court of Appeals the case is being appealed to; and 

7.  State the name of each party filing the notice.  

We  have  provided  an  example  notice  of  appeal  at  the  end  of  this  guide.    See 

Attachment 1: Notice of Appeal. 

When I file a notice for appeal, do I have to file any other documents? 

A party must serve the notice of appeal on all parties to the trial court’s final judgment 

and  include  a  certificate  of  service  with  the  notice  of  appeal.    A  party  should  file  a 

docketing statement (see TRAP 32.1 for more information on docketing statements) and 

pay  the  clerk  of  the  appellate  court  all  required  fees.    If  a  party  is  seeking  indigent 

status, he must notify the appellate court if he is presumed indigent (TRAP 20.1(a)(3)), 

or must file an affidavit of indigence before or with the notice of appeal.  When filing a 

notice of appeal a party should also state if the case is an accelerated appeal.   

What is a docketing statement? 

A  docketing  statement  is  an  administrative  tool  that  allows  the  clerk  of  the  court  to 

quickly  screen  a  case  for  procedural  or  jurisdictional  defects.    The  Supreme  Court  of 

Texas has published a uniform docketing statement, which each Court of Appeals posts 

 

14 

 

 

on  its  website.    Each  appellate  court’s  website  can  be  found  by  visiting  this  website: 

http://www.courts.state.tx.us/courts/coa.asp.  

 What is a certificate of service? 

A certificate of service is a short statement, stating that a party has served a document 

to the opposing parties.  Below is an example certificate of service. 

CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE 

 

The undersigned hereby certifies that on <date>, a copy of the foregoing <title of 

document  served>  was  served  on 

the 

following  counsel 

for  <Appellee’s 

name/Appellant’s name>: 

Julie Jones 

The Jones Law Firm  

123 Main Street 

Anytown, Texas 12345 

How many copies of a notice for appeal are required? 

A party is only required to file one notice for appeal with the trial court.  

Once I file my notice for appeal, what do I do? 

The  party  should  contact  the  trial  court  in  order  to  obtain  a  copy  of  the  clerk’s  record 

and, if necessary to the appeal, a copy of the reporter’s record.  Additionally, at this time 

the party should begin their legal research and work on their appellate brief.  

 

15 

Preparing a Brief 

 

P 

REPARING A BRIEF  
A brief is a written document that presents the legal and factual arguments of a 

party.   Parties  write  briefs to  support  the main  points of  error  (complaints  about  a  trial 

court’s decision) on appeal.  The following sections explain what a brief is and sets forth 

the sections a party must include when filing a brief with the court.  Every appellate brief 

is different and there are no set examples or forms for briefs distributed by the Supreme 

Court of Texas or Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.  Failure to properly brief an issue on 

appeal  can  result  in  waiver  of  the  issue  due  to  inadequate  briefing.    However,  the 

examples below should decrease the likelihood of waiver of issues or dismissal of the 

case.  Writing an appellate brief is not easy.  A party cannot substitute these examples 

of TRAP guidelines for the advice of a licensed attorney.

that  if  any  of  the  sections  are  not  in  the brief  there  is a  possibility  that  a  court  will  not 

consider a party’s argument or issues presented.

all of the sections that are included in an appellants brief.  Each section that applies to 

both  an  appellee  and  appellant  brief  is  noted  below.    Finally,  the  examples  below  will

Nature of the Case: 

Appellant/Plaintiff  John  Doe  brought  a  civil  trespass  cause 

of action against Appellee/Defendant Jane Smith arising out 

of damage his garden suffered during a trespass by Smith 

on January 1, 2014.  (CR at 1).  Appellant alleges Appellee 

consciously  disregarded  his  “No  Trespassing”  signs  and 

damaged his garden.  (CR at 2). 

Respondent: 

Honorable  Jim  Johnson,  425th  Judicial  District  Court, 

Anytown County, Texas. 

Respondent’s Action: 

February  1,  2014,  the  trial  court  entered  final  judgment,  a 

take nothing judgment in favor of appellee.  (CR 150; Appx. 

Tab  1).    The  trial  court  also  awarded  appellee  attorney’s

argument; this statement should state either the need for oral arguments or why there is 

no  need  for  oral  arguments.    Appellate  courts  only  allow  oral  argument  in  a  small 

number of appeals—you must persuade the court that it would be useful in your case.  

A sample statement regarding oral arguments is below. 

STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENTS 

 

This  case  raises  significant  issues  related  to  the  factual  sufficiency  of  the 

evidence presented in relation to the rule set forth in Brown v. Davis, 123 S.W.2d 321, 

325  (Tex.  2002).    The  inclusion  of  oral  arguments  will  significantly  aid  the  decision  of 

this Court.   

*A  proper  statement  regarding  oral  arguments  will  have  more  detail  and  legal  support 

(cases, statutes, etc.) for each issue that the party deems necessary for oral arguments.  

See page 53 for more information on oral arguments.

2.  Is there factually sufficient evidence to support the judgment of the trial court?

Statement of Facts 

Appellant only.  Appellee may file if dissatisfied with appellants statement. 

The brief must state concisely and without argument, the facts pertinent to the issues 

presented.  A party should support the facts with citations to the record. The appellate 

court  will  review  the  record  citations  to  ensure  accuracy  of  the  facts  presented  in  the 

statement of facts.  An example of a statement of facts is below. 

STATEMENT OF FACTS 

 

On  January  1,  2014,  Jane  Smith  (Appellee)  entered  the  property  of  John  Doe 

(Appellant)  without  his  permission  and  destroyed  his  prize-winning  garden.    (CR2).  

Before the incident, the Appellant received a letter from Appellee, stating that she was 

going  to  come  over  and  destroy  his  garden  for  beating  her  in  this  year’s  gardening 

competition.  (RR25).  Appellant filed suit in the 425th District Court in Anytown County 

against  Appellee  claiming  she  had  trespassed  and  maliciously  destroyed  his  property.  

(CR1). 

On February 1, 2014, the trial court heard the case without a jury.  (RR1)  During 

the  hearing,  Appellant  presented  both  the  letter  by  Appellee  and  video  recording  of 

 

24 

 

 

Appellee  trampling  the  garden.    (RR34;Ex.3-4).    The  trial  court  excluded  this  critical 

evidence and entered a take-nothing judgment in favor of Appellee.  (CR150;Appx.1). 

Appellant has appealed to the Fifteenth Court of Appeals at Anytown asking that 

the Appellate Court overturn the trial court’s judgment.   

Summary of the Argument 

Appellant and Appellee 

The  summary  of  the  argument  section  is  a  brief,  clear,  and  accurate  statement  of  the 

arguments that a party makes in the rest of the brief.  This section briefly explains what 

issues and arguments a party will raise in the arguments section and should not merely 

repeat the argument section.  See an example below. 

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT 

 

The  trial  judge  erred  in  excluding  and failing  to  consider  critical evidence 

that was presented at trial.  The exclusion of the evidence is contradictory to the rulings 

established by  the Supreme  Court  of  Texas  in Miller  v. Wilson  and  in  Brown  v.  Davis.  

Brown  v.  Davis,  123  S.W.3d  321,  325  (Tex.  2002);  Miller  v.  Wilson,  456  S.W.3d  654, 

657 (Tex. 2000).  Because the trial court should have considered the evidence, the trial 

court’s  decision  is  so  contrary  to  the  overwhelming  weight  of  this  evidence  as  to  be 

clearly wrong and unjust.  Thus, the trial court’s judgment is not supported by factually 

sufficient evidence.  For this reason, the case should be reversed and remanded to the 

trial court for further consideration.

pages if not. 

 

  A

A  brief  must  contain  a  clear  and  concise 

argument for the contentions made, with appropriate citations to authorities and to the 

record.  The argument section is where the substance of a brief comes from.  Moreover, 

in this section you will explain all of the issues that a party is raising.  

While  this  is  an  argument  section,  this  does  not  mean  a  party  may  write  whatever  it 

wants  in  this  section.    Any  statement  a  party  makes  should  relate  back  to  some  legal 

rule or authority, and complain about a legal error the trial court made.  For example, a 

criminal defendant appearing pro se on appeal should not simply write my = sentence is 

not fair.  It is better to write, the Supreme Court of Texas in Thomas v. State said that a 

trial court abuses its discretion by giving a sentence outside of the statutory range, and 

my sentence is outside of the statutory range.  Thomas v. State, 789 S.W.2d 987 (Tex. 

1995).    This  statement  is  supported  by  a  legal  authority  and  relates  back  to  the  legal 

error of the trial court. 

Typically,  an  argument  section  should  be  broken  down  into  paragraphs  concisely 

explaining  each  issue  presented.    The  argument  can  be  structured  by  following  the 

 

 

26 

IRAC formula for writing.  IRAC stands for Issue, Rule, Application, and Conclusion.  

 

Issue 

Rule 

Application 

Conclusion 

Start with a statement of the issue or point of error on appeal.  This should set the tone 

of the argument and inform the reader on what the argument will encompass.   

A  discussion of  applicable  rules follows  the issues  section.    In this  discussion, a  party 

states  the  legal  rules  that  govern  the  issues  on  appeal.    A  party  should  support  each 

rule stated with specific citations to cases, statutes, or other legal authority that relate to 

it.  The party should also research, understand, and state the standard of review used 

by the trial court in reviewing the issue before it (i.e. abuse of discretion, de novo, etc.).  

Application is the next, critical step.  In the application discussion, a party explains how 

the  legal  rules  apply  to  the  facts  of  its  particular  case.    This  section  ties  in  any  legal 

authority the party has uncovered during legal research and explains how the research 

supports the argument asserted.  A party should also support statements in this section 

with specific citations to cases, statutes, or other legal authority. 

Finally,  a  party  should  conclude  by  briefly  restating  why  the  trial  court’s  decision  was 

improper, and by asking the appellate court to take a particular action.  (The Appellee 

 

 

27 

 

 

will briefly explain why the trial court’s action was proper).   

See  page  50  for  more  information  on  brief  writing  and  legal  citation.    The  basic 

argument below follows the IRAC model. 

ARGUMENT 

Did the trial court err in excluding critical evidence? 

This  evidence  presented  at  trial  was  (1)  a  letter  sent  by  the  Appellee  that 

threatened  to  destroy  Appellant’s  garden,  and  (2)  a  video  recording  of  Appellee 

destroying the garden on January 1, 2014.  At trial, the court excluded both exhibits. 

The  Supreme  Court  of  Texas  in  Brown  v.  Davis  held  that  a  letter  in  a  trespass 

case  is  admissible  and  is  sufficient  to  prove  the  intent  of  another  party.    Brown,  123 

S.W.2d  at  323.    In  Miller  v.  Wilson,  the  Supreme  Court  of  Texas  found  that  a  video 

recording  was  an  appropriate  method  for  ensuring  the  security  of  one’s  property  and 

should  be  admissible  as  evidence.    Miller,  456  S.W.2d  at  659.    Furthermore,  the 

Supreme Court of Texas found in both cases that it was an abuse of discretion not to 

consider this evidence at trial if properly presented.  Brown, 123 S.W.2d at 325; Id. at 

661. 

In the findings of fact and conclusions of law, the trial court clearly stated that it 

did not regard either the letter or the video recording as admissible evidence.  Because 

the Supreme Court of Texas has stated a trial court must consider these two mediums, 

when properly presented to it, the trial court erred by disregarding these items.  

 

28 

 

 

The  Supreme  Court  of  Texas  states  that  it  is  an  abuse  of  discretion  not  to 

properly  consider  evidence  at  trial.    Because  the  trial  court  did  not  consider  the  letter 

and video recording, it abused its discretion and adversely affected the Appellant.   

Is there factually sufficient evidence to support the judgment of the trial court?

RECORD 

Relevant portions of the clerk’s and reporter’s record will have already been received by 

the appellate court prior to the appellant’s deadline to file a brief.  If a relevant portion of 

either record is missing, the appellant should file a motion for an extension of time to file 

its  brief  if  it  needs  one.    Here,  the  clerk’s  record  would  contain,  among  other  items, 

Appellant’s Original Petition, the Trial Court’s Final Judgment, the Trial Court’s Findings 

of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and the Notice of Appeal.  The reporter’s record would 

contain a transcript of the trial proceedings, and exhibits introduced a trial such as the 

letter and video footage.   A party can use CR as the abbreviation for a clerk’s record 

and  RR  for  the  abbreviation  of  the  reporter’s  record.    Record  citations  and  page 

numbers should be provided throughout the brief.

Preparing a Motion 
 

 

P 

REPARING A MOTION 
A motion is a written statement requesting that a court make a specific ruling or 

order.  There is a wide variety in the types of motions that can be filed with the appellate 

court,    including  motions  for  extensions  of  time  to  file  a  document,  or  motions  

requesting that the appellate court reconsider its decision.  

As motions cover a wide range of subjects, there is no set form on what a motion will 

look like.  However, this does not mean that there are not guidelines for what a motion 

must contain.  The TRAP has set out these guidelines in rule 10: 

1.  A motion must contain any document or item that is required by a rule governing 

the motion; 

2.  Explain why it is needed; 

3.  Set forth the relief that is sought; 

motion; and 

4.  Be  served  or  filed  with  any  brief,  affidavit,  or  other  paper  filed  in  support  of  the 

•  Generally,  if  a  litigant  is  filing  a  motion  that  does  more  than  ask  for  an 

extension of time, a party will file a supplemental brief to inform the court 

on the evidence and legal authority it has for ruling on the motion.  

•  Any  brief  a  party  files  in  support  of  a  motion  should  include:  issues 

presented by the motion, statement of facts, argument explaining why the 

appellate court should take the action requested, and prayer. 

o More information about each of these sections can be found above 

in the Preparing a Brief section. 

 

 

31 

 

 

5.  In civil cases, a motion must contain a statement that the filing party met with or 

reasonably attempted to meet with all other parties about the merits of the motion 

and whether those parties object to the motion. 

Additionally, any party that is adverse to a motion may file a response to a motion at any 

time before the court rules on the motion or by any deadline set by the court. 

The  following  list  of  motions  are  those  that  are  most  commonly  filed  with  the  court  or 

have a TRAP rule associated with them. 

•  Motion for Extension of Time (TRAP 10.5) 

o  These  motions  ask  for  an  extension  of  time  to  file  a  document  with  the 

court.  A motion for extension of time must state the following: 

  The deadline for filing the item in question; 

  The length of the extension sought; 

  The facts relied on to reasonably explain the need for an extension; 

  The  number  of  previous  extensions  granted  regarding  the  item  in 

and  

question. 

o  This  list  does  not  cover  all  motions  for  extension  of  time  but  following 

these guidelines should work for most motions for extension of time. 

•  Motion to dismiss the appeal  

o  An appellant can file a motion to dismiss the appeal if he no longer wishes 

to pursue the appeal.  

•  Motion to Postpone Argument (TRAP 10.5) 

 

32 

 

 

 

o  A  motion  to  postpone  argument  is  one  that  asks  for  a  later  date  for  oral 

arguments.  However, unless all parties agree or the cause is apparent to 

the court, a party should support this 

motion with supporting evidence. 

•  Motion 

for  Rehearing  or  En  Banc 

Reconsideration (TRAP 49, 52.9, 64, 79) 

o  A  party  files  a  motion  for  rehearing 

Opinion

statement  explaining 
its  decision  in  a  given 
case 
 

when  it  feels  there  are  points  of  error  in  a  court’s  opinion.    No  response 

from the court is required and the court is not required to rule in favor of a 

new hearing if the evidence does not support the need for one.

How to File a Document 

 

H 

OW TO FILE A DOCUMENT  
Filing  a  document  with  the  court  clerk  is  the  only  way  the  court  is  able  to 

consider  the  document  when  making  its  decision.    There  are  two  main  ways  pro  se 

litigants can file documents with the court.  The first way is to file a document either in 

person or by mail.  The second way is to file a document electronically if the litigant has 

access  to  a  computer  and  the  internet.    The 

following  two  sections  will  explain  what  is 

required in both of these methods. 

Electronic Filing 

File  

To  deliver  a 
legal 
document  to  the  court 
for  placement 
clerk 
into the official record 
 

While  pro  se  litigants  certainly  have  the  option  of  filing  a  document  in  person,  pro  se 

litigants  can  also  file  documents  electronically  if  it  is  more  convenient  or  if  the  litigant 

must meet a deadline to file a document and the clerk’s office is already closed.  A court 

will  consider  any  document  timely  filed  by  a  litigant  if  it  is  filed  electronically  before 

midnight on the date of filing.  This deadline gives a litigant an additional 7 hours to file 

from the 5:00 P.M. deadline for documents filed in in person. Electronic filing also allows 

for  faster  receipt  and  transmission  of  documents  and  ease  of  review  by  the  appellate 

court.   

When choosing to file a document online, litigants should first go to www.efiletexas.gov.

Step 2: Service Providers. 

After selecting NO, you should arrive at this page. 

 

This page lists all of the services that are compatible with www.efiletexas.gov.  Five of 

the services are free, and the other four services require a subscription fee.  Regardless 

of  the  cost,  the  Texas  court  system  has  approved  all  of  the  services  listed  to  file 

documents  electronically.    The  rest  of  this  guide  depicts  the  services  provided  by 

EFileTexasCourts.    If  a  different  service  provider  is  selected  and  problems  are

Once  you  have  clicked  on  the  EFileTexasCourts  link,  you  should  be  directed  to  this 

 

If the website does not automatically redirect to this page and instead gives an error, try 

one of the troubleshooting steps on the help page.  

This is the logon page and can be reached directly by going to http://efile.txcourts.gov.  

From this page, you can logon if previously registered with EFileTexasCourts or start a 

new registration if this is your first time.  To start a new registration, click the “Register 

Now”  link,  in  the  login  box.    The  following  five  screens  should  appear  in  order  after 

clicking the “Register Now” link. 

 

 

37 

 

 

 In  Step  1  of  the  registration  process,  pick  “An  Independent  User,”  as  you  will  not  be 

affiliated  with  a  law  firm.    During  Step  2,  read  the  terms  of  agreement  and  click  “I 

Agree.” 

 

 

 

 

In Step 3 and 4, fill out any of the information that is marked with a *.  Ensure that the e-

mail address you provide is valid, as a conformation e-mail will be sent to this address. 

 

38 

 

 

Once  you  receive  the  confirmation  e-mail  click  “Activate  Account”  to  finish  the 

registration process.  Upon activation of your account go back to the EFileTexasCourts 

webpage  at  http://efile.tx.courts.gov  and  login  with  your  e-mail  address  and  password 

that you provided in Step 4 of the registration process.  

Step 4: Workspace. 

 

 

 

 

39 

 

 

Once  you  have  successfully  logged  in  you  should  be  redirected  towards  the  page 

above.  This is your workspace and allows you to manage any case that you have filed 

with the courts or search for cases that you are a party to.  In addition, the workspace 

will let you start the process of appealing a new case if the other party has not already 

submitted a notice of appeal.  Finally, once you have set up a case this is where you will 

come in order to submit any additional documents, like briefs or motions. 

Step 5: Payment Account. 

Before  anything  can be filed  with  the Texas court  system  a  payment  account must  be 

set  up  with  the  website.    This  can  be  done  by  clicking  “My  Account”  followed  by  the 

“Payment Accounts” tab on the next page; these actions are marked by the numbers 1 

and 2 in the pictures below.  Completing these actions will bring you to the page below.   

2 

 

1 

3 

Fill  out  the  required  information  and  provide  a  valid  credit  card  to  set  up  a  payment 

account.    If  you  believe  you  are  indigent,  this  information  should  still  be  provided.  

 

40 

 

 

 

However, you will not be charged for certain court costs if your Affidavit of Indigence is 

approved.  There is no filing fee associated with filing an Affidavit of Indigence. 

Step 6: New Case Details.  

Once you have finished setting up a payment account you can start a new case.  To do 

this,  you  should  select  the  “New  Case”  button, marked  by  the  number  3  in  the picture 

above.  Clicking “New Case” will take you to the page seen in the picture below. 

 

On this page, you should fill in the location that the document is to be filed with, either 

the  trial  court  or  the  Court  of  Appeals.    Following  this,  select  whether  your  case  is 

criminal or civil.  If applicable, select the specific type of case that you are filing (typically 

this  box  will  only  be  found  with  cases  that  are  filed  with  a  trial  court).    The  other  two 

boxes,  Filer  Type  and  Payment  Account,  should  automatically  fill  in.    If  they  do  not, 

select  the  appropriate  option.    Once  all  of  these  boxes  are  filled  in,  click  the  “Parties” 

button to move on to the next page. 

 

41 

 

 

 

Step 7: Parties. 

The next page that you will see is the parties page.  This page allows you to enter the 

appropriate information for all of the parties in the lawsuit.  This page also allows for the 

designation of a party as pro se.  Additionally, this page requires you designate whether 

the  party  is  Appellant  or  Appellee.    If  the  wrong  designation  is  given,  the  page  will 

prompt you to correct it. 

 

To  add  in  the  information  of  additional or  adverse  parties,  simply  click  the  “Add  Party” 

button once you have finished filling out the information for the current party.  If you are 

filling  the  information  out  yourself,  clicking  the  “I  am  the  party”  box  will  fill  in  all  of  the 

information from the information you supplied during registration.  If you need to correct 

any  of  this  information,  simply  select  the  appropriate  box  and  edit  the  information.  

Clicking “Filings” in the lower right hand corner will take you to the next page. 

 

42 

 

 

 

Step 8: Filings. 

You will now come to the filings page.  This page will allow you to file a single document 

or  multiple  documents  at  the  same  time.    For  example,  one  notice  of  appeal  can  be 

filed, or a notice of appeal and an affidavit of indigence can be filed simultaneously.  To 

file  multiple  documents,  fill  in  all  of  the  appropriate  information  for  the  first  document, 

attach  the  document  as  the  lead  document,  and  click  the  “Add  Another  Filing”  box  to 

attach the next document.  This can be done multiple times to file as many documents 

as you require.  When attaching documents as the lead document, ensure that the file is 

saved as a .pdf file or it will not upload to the system. 

This page will also keep a running total of all of the costs that are associated with your 

current  filing  and  will  detail  where  each  fee  comes  from.    When  you  have  completed 

adding all the documents for the particular filing click the “Summary” button to proceed.  

 

 

43 

 

 

Step 9: Summary 

The summary page gives a summary of all of the information and documents you have 

added to the file over the last three webpages, as well as a total cost of the filing.  You 

should review this page to ensure that all of the information is accurate, correct, and the 

appropriate  documents  are  attached.    Once  you  have  reviewed  all  of  the  information, 

click the “Submit” button to file everything with the court. 

 

Once  you  have  submitted  the  file  you  can  return  to  it  anytime  by  clicking  the  case  in 

your workspace.  Once in the case, additional files or parties can be added. 

Paper Filing 

The other option to file documents is to file a paper copy in person or through the mail.  

This  method  may  be  more  familiar  to  some  pro  se  litigants.    To  file  in  person  simply 

bring  the  appropriate  document,  copies,  and  filing  fee  to  the  clerk’s  office  in  the 

courthouse.  However, filing in person does have some drawbacks including printing the 

 

44 

 

 

document in the correct format and meeting a 5:00 P.M. submission time on the day of 

the deadline. 

When filing the document in person make sure that it complies with the following rules: 

•  Print only one side of the page; 

•  The paper on which a document is printed should be 8.5 by 11 inches, and white; 

•  The document should have 1-inch margins; 

•  The text should be double-spaced; 

•  A document should be produced in size 14 of a normal font (i.e. Calibri, Cambria, 

Garamond, Times New Roman, etc.); 

•  A document should be bound to ensure that it will not lose its cover or fall apart;  

o  A paper document should be stapled in the top left-hand corner or bound 

so it lies flat when open;  

o  A paper petition or brief should have a durable front and back cover which 

cannot be plastic or be red, black, or dark blue; 

•  The front cover of a document should contain the following: 

o  Case  style  –  Plaintiff  v.  Defendant,  or  Appellant  or  Appellee.    The  last 

name of each party would be substituted for each word respectively; 

o  Case number; 

o  Title of the document being filed; 

o  Name of the party filing the document; and  

o  The following for the lead party responsible for the filing: 

  Name; 

 

45 

 

 

  Mailing address; 

  Telephone number; 

  Fax number (if any); and  

  E-mail address. 

If a party requests oral arguments, ensure that this request also appears 

on the front cover in the form “ORAL ARGUMENT REQUESTED.”

Where do I file a notice of appeal? 

place.  

How do I file documents with the court? 

A party should file a notice of appeal with the clerk of the trial court where the trial took 

A party is encouraged to file all documents electronically, but this is not required.  Go to 

www.eFileTexas.gov to start the process of electronically filing a document.  If a party 

does  not  wish  to  electronically  file  or  does  not  have  the  means  to  do  so,  one  of  the 

following methods is appropriate: (1) delivering the document to the clerk of the court in 

which the document is to be filed, (2) delivering the document to a justice or judge of the 

court who is willing to accept delivery, or (3) mailing the documents to the court with a 

post  mark  of  the  deadline  to  file.    TRAP  9.2  has  more  information  on  all  of  these 

methods.  

Additionally,  unless  the  court  orders  otherwise,  an  electronically  filed  document  must 

not contain any of the following sensitive data: 

•  Social security number;  

•  Birth date;  

 

48 

 

 

•  The name of any person who was a minor when the underlying suit was filed;  

•  Home address;  

•  Driver's license number; 

•  Passport number; 

number; or  

•  Tax  identification  number  or  similar  government-issued  personal  identification 

•  Bank account number, credit card number, or other financial account number.  

A party should replace all sensitive data with the letter “X” in place of each letter.  If the 

document must contain un-redacted sensitive data a party should either notify the clerk, 

for  electronically  filed  documents,  or  write  “NOITCE:  THIS  DOCUMENT  CONTAINS 

SENSITVE DATA,” for non-electronic copies.  See TRAP 9.9 for more information. 

When I submit a document for filing by mail is it considered filed with 

the court when it is mailed? 

Parties can use either the United States Postal Service or a commercial delivery service 

(DSL, Fed Ex, UPS, etc.) to submit written documents.  A document that is mailed will 

be  considered timely  if  it  is  received  by  the court  within  10  days  of  the filing  deadline.  

However, the document must still be postmarked on or before the last day of the 

filing deadline.  See TRAP 9.2. 

How should documents be bound? 

One copy of anything filed with the court must be unbound and one-sided (on 8.5”x11” 

 

49 

 

 

paper)  and  contain  no  hard  covers,  tabs,  or  any  other  item  that  would  impede  the 

scanning  of  the  document.    For  all  other  copies  see  TRAP  9.4  for  the  form  the 

documents should conform to.

a 
The 
that 
date

received  by  the  court.  
Missing  a  deadline  can 
result in the dismissal of 
the case in some cases 

How  do  I  calculate  the  time  for  filing 

documents with the clerk’s office? 

Generally,  the  time  for  filing  documents  will  begin 

the day after a trial court enters its final judgment, 

grants a motion, or takes any other action that can be appealed.  Time is then computed 

from that day forward including Saturday and Sunday. 

What  if  my  filing  deadline  falls  on  a  Saturday,  a  Sunday,  or  a  legal 

holiday, when should I file to make sure my document is considered 

timely? 

If the filing deadline falls on one of the above dates, the deadline for filing extends to the 

end of the next business day that the clerk’s office is open. 

What will happen if the document I want to file is submitted late?  

If the deadline missed is the deadline to file a notice of appeal, the appeal will likely be 

dismissed  by  the  appellate  court.    If  the  deadline  missed  is  the  deadline  to  file  an 

appellant’s brief, unless the a party has filed a motion for extension of time before the 

filing deadline or other rules provide for an implied extension of time, the appellate court 

may  dismiss  the  appeal.    In  other  cases  such  as  a  failure  to  timely  file  an  appellee’s 

 

50 

 

 

brief,  the  court  may  proceed  with  the  appeal  without  the  submission  of  the  document.  

You will likely receive notices from the appellate court notifying you of missed deadlines 

and the opportunity to cure your mistake if any is given.  

Briefs to the Court 

When must an appellant’s brief be filed? 

An  appellant  should  file  their  brief  within  30  days  after:  (1)  the  date  the  clerk’s  record 

was filed, or (2) the date the reporter’s record was filed, whichever of these two is later.  

TRAP 38.6(a). 

When must an appellee’s brief be filed? 

An appellee’s brief must be filed within 30 days after the date the appellant’s brief was 

filed.  TRAP 38.6(b). 

As an appellant, may I file a brief in response to the appellee’s brief? 

This  is  allowed  and  called  a  reply  brief.    An  appellant  has  20  days  after  the  appellee 

files their brief to file a reply brief.  TRAP 38.6(c). 

How many pages can a brief be? 

For  any  brief  filed  with  the  court,  the  brief  should  not  be  more  than  15,000  words  if 

computer-generated, and 50 pages if not.  Additionally, in a civil case the total length of 

all  briefs  filed  must  not  exceed  27,000  words  if  computer-generated,  and  90  pages  if 

not.  TRAP 9.4(i). 

 

51 

 

 

Can I exceed the page limit? 

No, if the appellate court receives a nonconforming document it has the power to strike 

the document or allow the nonconforming party to resubmit the document.  If your case 

is extraordinary and cannot be adequately briefed within the page limits, you may file a 

motion  with  the  appellate  court  requesting  permission  to  file  a  brief  that  exceeds  the 

page  limit.    You  must  inform  the  court  how  long  the  brief  will  be  and  must  obtain  a 

favorable ruling on the motion before filing a brief that exceeds page or word limitations.  

What do I do if I need an extension of time to file my brief? 

A  motion  for  extension  of  time  must  be  submitted  to  the  court;  at  that  point,  it  may 

decide  to  grant  the  extension.    Deadline  for  a  responsive  brief  does  not  run  until  the 

party given an extension of time files its brief with the appellate court.  

How many copies of a brief must be filed? 

A  party  who  does  not  electronically  file  a  brief  should  file  the  original  brief  and  3 

additional copies.   

What  is  the  proper  way  to  cite  to  the  record,  transcript,  exhibits, 

statutes, and appellate court decisions? 

The  following  is  a  list  of  ways  to  cite  to  the  record  or 

other legal authority. 

1.  Single Volume Clerk’s Record – (CR1)  

Citation (Cite) 

A  reference  to  a  legal

Motions  

If I have a request relating to my appeal I want the court to grant while 

the appeal is still pending, how do I make such a request? 

The  proper  way  to  make  a  request  to  the  court  is  to  put  the  request  in  the  form  of  a 

motion.  E.g., a motion for extension of time to file appellant’s brief. 

How many copies of motions are required? 

A party who does not electronically file a motion must file the original motion and 1 copy 

of any other motion or 3 copies of a motion for rehearing. 

 

53 

 

 

Oral Arguments 

Am I entitled to argue my case before the Court of Appeals? 

TRAP 39.1 states that any party who has filed a brief and who has timely requested oral 

argument may argue the case to the court unless the court determines it is unnecessary 

for any of the following reasons: (1) the appeal is frivolous, (2) the issue(s) have already 

been  conclusively  decided,  or  (3)  oral  arguments  would  not  significantly  aid  the 

decision.  For a party to request an oral argument, the party must note that request on 

the  front  cover  of  the  brief.    TRAP  39.7.    The  statement  “ORAL  ARGUMENT 

REQUESTED”  is  a  generally  accepted  way  to  accomplish  this  task.    Additionally,  a 

statement  regarding  why  oral  argument  should  or  should  not  be  permitted  must  be 

added to the brief. 

How will I receive notice of my case being set for oral argument? 

Each  party  will  receive  notice  of  a  decision  for  or  against  oral  arguments  at  least  21 

days before oral arguments would take place.  TRAP 39.8  

May  I  present  new  exhibits  or  testify  about  my  case  during  oral 

argument? 

No,  oral  arguments  are  a  time  to  discuss  why  the  trial  court  erred  in  its  opinion.    The 

only  information  a  party  can  argue  during  oral  arguments  is  that  information  that  was 

present  in  the  record.    This  rule  also  applies  for  briefs;  the  only  issues  a  party  may 

complain about in a brief are those that are contained in the record.  TRAP 39.2. 

 

54 

 

 

Appealing a Court of Appeals Decision 

Can  I  appeal  the  decision  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  to  the  Supreme 

Court of Texas or Texas Court of Criminal Appeals? 

Yes, this can be done by filing a petition for review with the Supreme Court of Texas or 

the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.  However, the Supreme Court of Texas and Texas 

Court  of  Criminal  Appeal  have  discretionary  power  to  hear  cases  and  are  under  no 

obligation to grant any of the petitions for review they receive. 

What is a petition for review? 

A  petition for  review  is  a formal  request for  the  Supreme  Court of Texas  or  the Texas 

Court of Criminal Appeals to take up the case and review the decision of the appellate 

court.  Unlike a notice of appeal, a petition for review makes a brief argument for why 

the  case  should  be  heard  by  the  higher  courts.    A  petition  for  review  includes  the 

following sections: 

1.  Identity of Parties and Counsel 

2.  Table of Contents 

3.  Index of Authorities  

4.  Statement of the Case 

5.  Statement of Jurisdiction 

6.  Issues Presented 

7.  Statement of Facts

petition of review? 

A detailed explanation of what needs to be found in each of these sections can be found 

How long after the decision of the Court of Appeals do I have to file a 

A petition must be filed within 30 days of: (1) the day the appellate court’s judgment was 

rendered, or (2) the day of the last timely motion for rehearing.  TRAP 68.2. 

Can  I  file  a  writ  of  certiorari  with  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United 

States? 

No, a writ of certiorari can only be filed with the clerk of the Supreme Court of the United 

States after entry of a final judgment by a state court of last resort.  This means that the 

Supreme Court of Texas or Texas Court of Criminal Appeals would have to enter a final 

judgment before you can file a writ of certiorari.  More information on appealing to the 

Supreme Court of the United States can be found at 

http://www.supremecourt.gov/casehand/guideforifpcases.pdf 

Miscellaneous Questions 

Is  it  possible  for me  to  speak  directly  to  a  judge  or  a  member  of  his 

personal staff about my case? 

 

56 

 

 

No.  All parties and their counsel, including parties appearing pro se, are prohibited from 

all private communication with the judge or judge’s staff.  Any communication must be 

handled through the clerk’s office. 

What information can the clerk’s office give me? 

The court can give provide the following information: 

1.  The court can answer general questions about how the court works; 

2.  The court can give general guidance on court rules and procedures; 

3.  The court can provide any forms or instructions; or 

4.  Direct a party to a resource that has this information; 

However, the court cannot provide any information that directly affects the substance of 

a case.  This includes: 

1.  Whether to appeal a case; 

2.  What motions to file; 

3.  How a case will do in court; or 

4.  Any form of research. 

Are there any forms for pro se litigants? 

There  are  general  guideline  forms  attached  at  the  end  of  this  guide.    Another  place  a 

party can look is O’Connor’s Texas Civil Appeal or O’Connor’s Texas Criminal Code for 

general forms that can assist you when preparing your case.  Both of these books can 

be  found  in  the  legal  libraries  of  universities  or  in  the  libraries  of  all  the  courts  of 

 

57 

 

 

appeals.    Additionally,  some  forms  can  be  found  on  the  website  of  each  Court  of 

Appeals. 

What are the clerk’s offices business hours? 

Every clerk’s office is open Monday to Friday from 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. 

What are some of the common mistakes that are made when filing  

The  list  below  contains  common  problems  that  have  been  found  with  pro  se 

submissions to the court.  This list is not exhaustive but should give you an idea of what 

to look out for when preparing or filing a document with the courts.  

-Lack of legal argument/support 

When  filing  a  brief  or  other  document  with  the  court  it  is  important  to  support  every 

argument with legal authority.  It is not enough for a party simply to state why it feels the 

lower  court  was  wrong  in  its  decision;  the  party  must  support  the  argument  with  legal 

authority.  For example, stating the trial court decision is unfair because it punishes you 

is  not  enough.    Instead  a  proper  legal  argument  would  state  the  trial  court  decision  is 

incorrect  because  it  does  not  comply  with  X  case,  Y  statute,  or  some  other  legal 

authority.  Additionally, it is important to support all legal arguments with a citation to the 

source of the authority.  

-Failure to complain about a trial court’s error 

In addition to making a legal argument, ensure that the error or problem being argued 

 

58 

 

 

 

relates  to  an  actual  act  or  omission  committed  by  the  trial  court.    For  example,  a  trial 

court  error  would  be  failure  to  give  the  correct  jury  charge  or  failure  to  admit  the 

appropriate  evidence.  Note:  Generally,  appellate  courts  cannot  address  issues  that 

were not brought to the attention of the trial court.   

-Failure to file all parts of a document 

When filing a document with the appellate court, it is essential that it contain all of the 

necessary parts required by the TRAP.  As previously stated a pro se litigant is held to 

the same standards as practicing attorneys, failure to comply with the rules set forth by 

the TRAP is not an option.  If a required part is missing from a document, it can lead to 

a letter for resubmission or waiver of the issue or request.    

-Illegible handwriting 

There  is  no  requirement  that  a  document  be  typed  in  order  to  be  filed  with  the  court 

However,  a  handwritten  document  must  be  legible.    It  is  not  the  responsibility  of  the 

court  to  interpret  an  illegible  document.   If  the  court  cannot  read a  party’s  handwriting 

there is the possibility that issues will be waived.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE 

Nature of the Case: 

Appellant/Plaintiff  John  Doe  brought  a  civil  trespass  cause 

of action against Appellee/Defendant Jane Smith arising out 

of damage his garden suffered during a trespass by Smith 

on  January  1,  2014.    (CR1).    Appellant  alleges  Appellee 

consciously  disregarded  his  “No  Trespassing”  signs  and 

damaged his garden.  (CR2). 

Respondent: 

Honorable  Jim  Johnson,  425th  Judicial  District  Court, 

Anytown County, Texas. 

Respondent’s Action: 

February  1,  2014,  the  trial  court  entered  a  final,  take-

nothing  judgment  in  favor  of  Appellee.    (CR150,  Appx.1).  

The  trial  court  also  awarded  appellee  attorney’s  fees.  

(CR150).  

 

 

 

73 

 

 

 

 

STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENTS 

This case raises significant issues related to the trial court’s erroneous exclusion 

of  critical  evidence  and  the  factual  sufficiency  of  the  evidence  presented  in  relation  to 

the rule set forth in Brown v. Davis, 123 S.W.2d 321, 325 (Tex. 2002).  The inclusion of 

oral arguments will significantly aid the decision of this Court.   

*A  proper  statement  regarding  oral  arguments  will  have  more  detail  and  legal  support 

(cases, statutes, etc.) for each issue that the party deems necessary for oral arguments.

STATEMENT OF FACTS 

On  January  1,  2014,  Jane  Smith  (Appellee)  entered  the  property  of  John  Doe 

(Appellant)  without  his  permission  and  destroyed  his  prize-winning  garden.    (CR2).  

Before the incident, the Appellant received a letter from Appellee, stating that she was 

going  to  come  over  and  destroy  his  garden  for  beating  her  in  this  year’s  gardening 

competition.  (RR25).  Appellant filed suit in the 425th District Court in Anytown County 

against  Appellee  claiming  she  had  trespassed  and  maliciously  destroyed  his  property.  

(CR1). 

On February 1, 2014, the trial court heard the case without a jury.  (RR1)  During 

the  hearing,  Appellant  presented  both  the  letter  by  Appellee  and  video  recording  of 

Appellee  trampling  the  garden.    (RR34;Ex.3-4).    The  trial  court  excluded  this  critical 

evidence and entered a take-nothing judgment in favor of Appellee.  (CR150;Appx.1). 

Appellant  has  appealed  to  the  Fifteenth  Court  of  Appeals  at  Anytown  asking  that  the 

Appellate Court overturn the trial court’s judgment.   

 

 

76 

 

 

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT 

The trial judge erred in excluding and failing to consider critical evidence that was 

presented  at  trial.    The  exclusion  of  the  evidence  is  contradictory  to  the  rulings 

established by  the Supreme  Court  of  Texas  in Miller  v. Wilson  and  in  Brown  v.  Davis.  

Brown  v.  Davis,  123  S.W.3d  321,  325  (Tex.  2002);  Miller  v.  Wilson,  456  S.W.3d  654, 

657 (Tex. 2000).  Because the trial court should have considered the evidence, the trial 

court’s  decision  is  so  contrary  to  the  overwhelming  weight  of  this  evidence  as  to  be 

clearly wrong and unjust.  Thus, the trial court’s judgment is not supported by factually 

sufficient evidence.    For this reason, the case should be reversed and remanded to the 

trial court for further consideration.     

*In cases with several points of error, each issue will be discussed along with supporting 

legal authority. 

 

 

77 

 

ARGUMENT 

Did the trial court err in excluding critical evidence? 

This evidence presented at trial was (1) a letter sent by the Appellee that threatened to 

destroy Appellant’s garden, and (2) a video recording of Appellee destroying the garden 

on January 1, 2014.  At trial, the court excluded both exhibits. 

The Supreme Court of Texas in Brown v. Davis held that a letter in a trespass case is 

admissible and is sufficient to prove the intent of another party.  Brown, 123 S.W.2d at 

323.  In Miller v. Wilson, the Supreme Court of Texas found that a video recording was 

an  appropriate  method  for  ensuring  the  security  of  one’s  property  and  should  be 

admissible as evidence.  Miller, 456 S.W.2d at 659.  Furthermore, the Supreme Court of 

Texas  found  in  both  cases  that  it  was  an  abuse  of  discretion  not  to  consider  this 

evidence at trial if properly presented.  Brown, 123 S.W.2d at 325; Id. at 661. 

In the findings of fact and conclusions of law, the trial court clearly stated that it did not 

regard  either  the  letter  or  the  video  recording  as  admissible  evidence.    Because  the 

Supreme  Court  of  Texas  has  stated  a  trial  court  must  consider  these  two  mediums, 

when properly presented to it, the trial court erred by disregarding these items.  

The  Supreme  Court  of  Texas  states  that  it  is  an  abuse  of  discretion  not  to  properly 

consider evidence at trial.  Because the trial court did not consider the letter and video 

recording, it abused its discretion and adversely affected the Appellant.   

Is there factually sufficient evidence to support the judgment of the trial court? 

 . . . 

 

 

78 

 

 

 

 

Appellant, John Doe, respectfully, for the reasons stated above, asks the Court to 

reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial.
