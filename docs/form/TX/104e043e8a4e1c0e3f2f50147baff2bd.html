Sixth District of Texas 
Bi-State Justice Building 
100 North State Line Avenue #20 
Texarkana, Texas 75501 
903/798-3046 

In 2004, the Appellate Section of the State Bar of Texas and the Courts of Appeals worked together to identify key information needed by appellate 
attorneys and pro se litigants to practice effectively before the court.  To assist the court in this effort, the Appellate Section collected and 
formatted the relevant information and published it in the Appellate Advocate in February 2005.  This information was updated in May 2020 and 
the court intends to keep the information current for the use of persons with matters before the court.

motions are granted only under exceptional 
circumstances.  All motions presented to the 
court are decided by the full court.

The court meets both before argument 
and immediately after.  Staff attorneys 
participate in conferences and prepare 
full memos that are reviewed and 
discussed with the court before argument.  
Often, a preliminary vote is taken 
immediately following argument.  If 
there is no argument, voting occurs after 
a proposed opinion is circulated, but that 
occurs only after the court has discussed 
any apparent problems or disagreements. 
 
Court does not release opinions on 
particular days. 

 

Case 
Assignment 
Oral Argument  Request argument on brief 
cover.  

Court typically allows 20 minutes per side, 
plus an additional 10 minutes for appellant's 
rebuttal.  In unusual situations (e.g., multiple 
parties, non-aligned parties, and complicated 
issues), when advance request is made, court 
may allot extra time.   
 
 

The court does not automatically grant 
requests for argument.  Argument is 
granted if any justice believes it will 
assist the court in reaching a decision.   

If the Court grants 
argument, both sides 
will be directed to 
appear and present 
argument, even if only 
one party requested it.

SPECIAL NOTES 

Original 
Proceedings 

See:  E-Filing requirements. 

 

Original proceedings are set for oral 
argument if it will assist the court to 
decide the issues and will not be 
redundant. 

Original proceedings are distributed to 
each member of the court and a staff 
attorney.  If a response is desired, it is 
requested immediately.  After discussion, 
the court decides whether argument is 
required.  If not, a draft opinion is 
prepared and circulated.  Original 
proceedings are reviewed as soon as 
possible.  Generally, one vote is required 
to grant emergency relief 
. 

The Court uses Westlaw. 
With respect to United States Supreme Court cites, cite the U.S. reporter.   
The court does not prefer that parties provide copies of out of state cases, but copies of cases that are not available on Westlaw are helpful. 
The court does not accept fax filing. 
The court’s opinions and orders are available on its website. 
The court records oral argument.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
