How to Use Simultaneous Interpretation  
in Zoom Proceedings 

Zoom offers a language interpretation feature that allows interpreters to interpret in the simultaneous mode2 
while the LEP individual listens to the interpretation on a separate audio channel. When this feature is enabled, 
the other participants do not hear the interpretation.3 
 

2.  Language Interpretation Setup 

To allow Hosts/Schedulers of meetings on your Zoom account to use the interpretation features, enable these 
features in your account settings. 

•  Sign in to the Zoom web portal and click Settings. 
•  Enable Language Interpretation under the In Meeting (Advanced) heading.  

 

1.  Simultaneous Interpretation Function1 

   

3.  Scheduling a Proceeding with an Interpreter 

•  Navigate to Meetings and click Schedule a New Meeting. 
•  Click Generate Automatically next to Meeting ID. This setting is required for language interpretation.  
•  Check the box to Enable Language Interpretation for the meeting. 
• 

If you do not know whom the assigned interpreter will be, just click “Schedule” for now. 

 

                                                           
1 Prerequisites 
    Business, Education, or Enterprise Account; or Webinar add-on plan 
    Zoom Desktop Client 
        Windows: 4.5.3261.0825 or higher 
        macOS: 4.5.3261.0825 or higher 
    Zoom Mobile App 
        Android: 4.5.3261.0825 or higher 
        iOS: 4.5.0 (3261.0825) or higher 
    Meeting with an automatically generated meeting ID 
2 Simultaneous interpretation is a competent interpreter listening to something in one language (source language) and 
orally translating it into another language (target language) in real-time without pauses. Consecutive interpretation is a 
competent interpreter listening to something in one language (source language) and orally translating it into another 
language (target language) while the speaker pauses to allow for the interpretation before continuing.

• 

If you know whom the interpreter will be, click “+ Add Interpreter” to display the screen below. Enter 
the interpreter’s email address and the language in the second dropdown box keeping the first 
dropdown box as English. The interpreter will need to log on with the same email address you enter 
here, so you may want to confirm that this is the correct email address for their Zoom account.4 Click 
“Schedule” when done. 

You can also click the “X” to close out these fields and then click “Schedule.” You MUST 
remember to send the interpreter a Zoom meeting invitation along with the rest of the invitees. 

NOTE: Zoom has several pre-set language choices including Chinese, Japanese, German, French, 
Russian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Korean. If you need a language other than one of these choices, you 
will need to designate one of these languages as a “catch-all” language. In other words, you can use 
the interpretation feature even if your language isn’t listed, but you will need to be sure everyone 
involved knows that the controls in Zoom will list a different language than what the interpreter will 
actually be interpreting to ensure that everyone selects the correct options in the following steps. 

 

4.  Joining the Zoom Proceeding 

Joining a Zoom proceeding that will involve interpretation works just like joining any other Zoom proceeding. 
The best practice is to download and log into the latest version of Zoom prior to the proceeding, but it is possible 
to download and run Zoom when the meeting is launching. 

                                                           
4 Interpreters may use the interpreter features with a Basic (free) account as long as the Host has the prerequisite Zoom 
service. See fn 1. 
 

2 

f any of the following situations occur, Zoom’s simultaneous interpretation function WILL NOT work and you 
will need to conduct the hearing with the interpreter using the consecutive mode: 

•  Participant joins by telephone only (no video). 
•  Participant joins by Zoom for video but is using a telephone for audio. 
•  Participant joins through the meeting link via their web browser. 
•  Participant joins using a Chromebook.5 

5.  Getting Started 

Once the hearing begins but before the Host enables the simultaneous interpretation function, the Host should 
provide instructions to all participants explaining what they will need to do. Following is an example: 

 

•  Go on the record and call the case. 
•  The Interpreter 

  Ask the interpreter to say and spell their name for the record.  
  Ask the interpreter what type of license they hold, if any, and to state their license number for 

 

the record. 
If they are unlicensed, ask them a short set of questions to establish they meet the requirements 
of Section 57.002.6  

  Administer the interpreter’s oath.7 
  Give participants instructions. The interpreter will interpret these in consecutive mode. 

o “The Court will be using the services of a remote court interpreter.” [pause for 

interpretation] 

                                                           
5 This functionality may be added for Chromebook, but is not available at publication. 
6 Under Tex. Gov. Code § 57.002, even when you are allowed to appoint an unlicensed interpreter to interpret a court 
proceeding, that interpreter must still be qualified by the court as an expert under the Texas Rules of Evidence; at least 18 
years of age; and not a party to the proceeding. Here is an example of how it is done in federal court that could easily be 
adapted for Texas courts and the requirements of § 57.002. 
7 Tex. R. Evidence 604 requires that interpreters are qualified and take an oath. Sample interpreter’s oath: “Do 
you solemnly swear or affirm that you will interpret accurately, completely and impartially, using your best skill 
and judgment in accordance with the standards prescribed by law and the Code of Ethics and Professional 
Responsibility; follow all official guidelines established by this court for legal interpreting; and discharge all of the 
duties and obligations of legal interpretation?”

  I

 

 

o “Once I turn on the simultaneous interpretation function, the only person who will hear 

the interpretation will be Mr./Ms./Mx. [LEP Person].” [pause for interpretation] 

o “The role of the interpreter is to interpret everything said in the proceeding with no 
additions, omissions, explanations, or personal input. [pause for interpretation] 

o  The interpreter cannot give advice, make suggestions, or engage in private conversation 

with you Mr./Ms./Mx. [LEP Person] or with anyone else. [pause for interpretation] 

o  Mr./Ms./Mx. [LEP Person], Raise your hand to let us/your attorney know if you have a 
question or do not understand something during the proceeding. Please do not ask the 
interpreter to explain it to you or for any advice.” [pause for interpretation] 

o “Mr./Ms./Mx. Interpreter, after the interpretation function is turned on you will see a 
welcome screen that says ‘You’ve been assigned as an interpreter’ and you should click 
‘OK.’” [pause for interpretation] 

o Once you click OK, you should see a screen that will allow you to switch back and forth 

between [non-English language] and English. [pause for interpretation] 

o When you are on the [non-English] channel, only Mr./Ms./Mx. LEP person will hear you. 

[pause for interpretation] 

o If you need to ask for repetition or clarification or need us to pause or anything else, 

please raise your hand and switch to the English channel to address the Court. [pause for 
interpretation] 

o Whenever you are on the English channel, please interpret in the consecutive mode 

[pause for interpretation] 

o “For the rest of you, if you’re joining on a computer, you should see a notification that 
says ‘Interpretation is available’ over an ‘Interpretation’ icon that looks like a globe.” 
[pause for interpretation] 

o “If you’re joining on a smart phone, you may find the ‘Language Interpretation’ option 

under ‘More’ over some dots.” [pause for interpretation] 

o “Everyone must click on the interpretation icon to select your preferred language.” 

[pause for interpretation] 

o “Mr./Ms./Mx. [LEP Individual], you should click on the “[Non-English language]” which 

will be the [2nd/ 3rd/etc.] on the list of options. [pause for interpretation] 

o “Once I turn on the simultaneous interpretation you will hear us speaking English in the 
background at about 20% volume and you will hear the interpreter at about 80% volume 
over that. [pause for interpretation]  

o If you prefer to hear only the interpreter, there is an option to “mute original audio” right 

under where you select [Non-English language]. Once I turn on the simultaneous 
interpretation, let us know if you have any trouble getting it to work the way you want it 
to. [pause for interpretation] 

o  “Everyone else should click ‘English.’” [pause for interpretation] 

4 

 

 

o Before I turn on the simultaneous interpretation, does anyone have any questions about 

what I’ve said so far? [pause for interpretation] 

o “I’m going to turn on the simultaneous interpretation function now.” [pause for 

interpretation] 

b. 

 Enable the Simultaneous Interpretation function. 

o [Once the simultaneous interpretation is on and you have given everyone a moment to 

select the appropriate options] Confirm all the participants can hear.  
“Can everyone hear the language that they selected? Please raise your hand if you can 
hear the language you want to hear.” 

o If everyone can hear, begin with some additional instructions regarding interpretation. 

 “Now that we are in simultaneous mode, I want to give some brief additional 
instructions to help make this go as smoothly as possible.” 

o Speak slowly, clearly, and one at a time. Whenever possible use plain language and avoid 

“legalese” and unnecessary terms of art.  

o Speak directly to the person you are addressing as you normally would in court, not to 

the interpreter. 

o Do not ask the interpreter to explain or restate what Mr./Ms./Mx.  [LEP individual] said. 

o During consecutive interpretation such as witness testimony, use short, complete 
sentences and pause after each complete thought to allow for interpretation.  

o Open any statement to the interpreter with “Mr./Ms./Mx. [Interpreter Name]” or 
“Mr./Ms./Mx. Interpreter” to alert the interpreter that they are being addressed. 

o [If there is an attorney representing the LEP individual] Mr./Ms./Mx. [Attorney name], if 
you need to confer with your client, please raise your hand to let us know. You can use a 
breakout room. If you need the interpreter to join you, please let us know. Only 
consecutive interpretation mode is available in the breakout rooms. 

o Immediately raise your hand if you are unable to hear or understand the person 

speaking, or if the equipment you are using is not working properly. 

o [Instruct all participants about what to do if they get disconnected due to a problem 

with the internet or other technology including providing contact information for a staff 
person who will be responsive if needed.] 

o Begin the proceeding as you normally would.  

 
6.  Enabling the Simultaneous Interpretation Function 

The simultaneous interpretation option appears at the bottom of the Host’s screen as an icon that looks like a 
globe. Only the Host can enable this function, not a Co-Host. 
 

5 

 

 

 

 

 

Host’s Screen 

When the Host clicks on the “Interpretation” icon, a “Language Interpretation” screen will pop-up. 
The Host should start typing the name of the interpreter, which should populate the interpreter field 
or display a dropdown list of choices. 

Once the interpreter’s name appears in the interpreter field, the Host must select the appropriate non-
English language and then click “Start.” The Host can assign multiple interpreters as needed.  

Interpreter’s Screen 
After the Host clicks “Start,” the interpreter will see a Welcome screen that is visible only to the 
interpreter. When the interpreter clicks “OK,” Zoom automatically chooses the non-English language for 
them. 

After the interpreter clicks “OK,” the interpreter sees a screen that allows them to toggle back 
and forth between English and the non-English language audio channels. 

6 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Participant’s Computer Screen 
Once the simultaneous interpretation feature has been activated by the Host, the other Participants will 
see a pop-up notice on their screens indicating, “interpretation is available” or “language interpretation.” 
The Host should remind participants of the instructions to click on the Interpretation icon (not the message 
bubble) to select their preferred language. 

Participant’s Smart Phone Screen 

The court, staff, and attorneys should choose “English” while the LEP individual chooses the [Non-
English] language. Once all of the participants have chosen their preferred language channel, 
simultaneous interpreting can begin. 

Confirm all the participants can hear by saying, “Can everyone hear the language that they selected? Please 
raise your hand if you can hear.” Instruct participants to alert the Court if anybody has difficulties hearing 
by raising their hand at any point during the proceeding. 

 

During the Hearing 
When the simultaneous interpreting function is on, the interpretation will not be audible to anyone except the 
LEP individual and anyone else who has selected the non-English audio channel. The LEP individual should hear 
 

7 

the English speakers at about 20% volume while the interpretation will be heard at about 80% volume. It may be 
helpful for the court to inform the LEP individual that if they want to hear only the interpretation, they can click 
“Mute Original Audio.” 
 

nding the Simultaneous Interpreting Option 
To stop the Simultaneous Interpretation function at any time, the Host can click the “Interpretation” icon and 
choose “Manage Language Interpretation.” 
 

nce the language interpretation screen is displayed, the Host should click “End” to stop the interpretation. The 

Host can stop and restart the interpretation function as often as necessary. Interpretation should be in 
consecutive mode when the simultaneous function is turned off.

Livestreaming on YouTube 
If the court is planning on livestreaming the proceeding on YouTube and the simultaneous interpretation 
function is enabled, viewers will NOT be able to hear the interpretation audio channel, only the original audio 
channel. Cloud recordings will also only record the original audio, not the interpreter audio channel. Proceedings 
recorded on a local computer will record any audio channels that the person recording it can hear. 

 
Breakout Rooms 
If the court needs to send an attorney and their LEP client into a breakout room with the interpreter, the 
simultaneous interpretation function will not work in the breakout room. Before sending participants into a 
breakout room, the Host should turn off the interpretation function as described above. Interpretation in a 
breakout room will be conducted in the consecutive mode, which is the method that mimics an in-person 
encounter. If the simultaneous interpretation feature is needed after participants return from the breakout 
room, the Host can turn the feature back on and instruct participants to choose their audio channel again. 

 

Two Interpreters Working as a Team 
Two interpreters working as a team can share one audio channel and switch off while interpreting in the 
simultaneous mode. Both the active and resting interpreter will listen to the English speakers and switch off as 
needed with only one interpreter interpreting at a time. When interpreters are working as a team, they are not 
able to hear the other interpreter’s interpretation. It may be helpful for them to have an opportunity to 
communicate prior to the proceeding to agree on how they will communicate and switch off. They may need to 
pause the proceedings for a moment while they switch off.
