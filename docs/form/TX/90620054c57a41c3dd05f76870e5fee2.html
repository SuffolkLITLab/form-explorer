You may be able to stop cyberbullying by filling out this 
form and turning in a copy to the court. 
 
“Cyberbullying” is a single significant act or a pattern of 
acts by one or more students against another student 
that is done through technology (like email, instant 
message, text message, or social media). It must either: 
•  physically harm the student or the student’s 

property; 

•  make the student fear harm; 
•  create an intimidating, threatening, or abusive 

learning environment for the student; or 

•  disrupt the learning process, classroom, or school. 
 
Before you file a lawsuit, consider if the 
cyberbullying can be resolved outside the 
courtroom by, for example, talking to the bully’s 
parents. 

 
You can fill out this form yourself, but you are 
encouraged to get a lawyer to help you. This form is 
not a substitute for legal advice. For information on 
free and low-cost legal services, visit

  You do not need to fill in this section. This section asks the court to stop 

the cyberbullying and is needed for legal reasons. A “Temporary 
Restraining Order” and an “Injunction” are both court orders that tell 
someone to stop doing something. To “enjoin” means to stop. 

5.1 

I ask the Court for a Temporary Restraining Order and an Injunction under 
Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code (“CPRC”) Chapter 129A. 

.2  My Sworn Application and Petition to Stop Cyberbullying is authorized by 

CPRC Section 129.002(a). 

.3  Under CPRC Section 129.002(c), I am entitled to a Temporary Restraining 

Order because I am likely to succeed in showing cyberbullying occurred. 
Under CPRC Section 129.002(c), I do not need to show that that 
immediate and irreparable injury will occur before notice can be served. 

.4  Under CPRC Section 129.002(d), I am entitled to an Injunction—either 
temporary or permanent—because I have shown that cyberbullying 
occurred. 

.5  As provided in CPRC Section 129.002(b), I ask the Court to enjoin 

cyberbullying, as defined in Section 37.0832 of the Texas Education 
Code, and to order the bully’s parent(s) or guardian(s) to take reasonable 
actions to stop the cyberbullying.

.6  As provided in CPRC Section 129.002(e), I also ask the Court to order, as 

is appropriate under the circumstances, the preservation of any relevant 
electronic communication or device, unless the Court determines that 
preservation is not in the best interest of the student being bullied.

.  Store the original in a safe place. Keep it for at least 6 months after the 

lawsuit is over. 

.  Redact the names of children and some home addresses from the copy. 
“Redact” means to remove information. Most people redact by drawing a 
black box over the information they want to remove. Redact all children’s 
names in Sections 1.5, 2.2, 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5 above. If you listed the 
Respondent’s home address in Section 2.4, redact it too. Do not redact 
your address. 

.  If you are unable to afford court costs (sometimes more than $200), you 

should fill out the “Statement of Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs” by 
visiting https://www.txcourts.gov/rules-forms/forms/ or by asking for it at the 
courthouse. If you are able to afford court costs, you can skip this step. 

5.  Turn in (or “file”) the redacted copy of your Application to a “district court” 
or “county court at law” in the county where the Respondent lives. If you 
are unable to afford court costs, you should turn in your Statement of Inability 
to Afford Payment of Court Costs at the same time. You may turn in your 
Application (and Statement) in person, by mail, or by using the eFile system. 
If you use the eFile system, be sure to mark that your Application (and 
Statement) has sensitive data. 

.  Ask the clerk of the court when you can present your Application to a judge. 
Often, you can present your Application right away. You should also ask the 
clerk if there are any local rules you should know about. If you are not at the 
courthouse, you can call the clerk for this information. 

.  Present your Application to the judge at what’s called a “hearing.” Show the 
judge the paperwork you turned in and answer any questions the judge has. 
At the hearing, the judge will decide if you get a “Temporary Restraining 
Order,” which is an emergency court order that orders the cyberbullying to 
stop immediately until the judge can have a hearing with both you and the 
Respondent. If the judge doesn’t give you a Temporary Restraining Order, the 
judge will still schedule a hearing with both you and the Respondent.

Next Steps 

fter you are done filling in your Application, follow these steps: 

1.  Make a copy of your Application.

Draft form Sworn Application and Petition to Stop Cyberbullying published by the Supreme Court of 
Texas in Misc. Dkt. No. 22-9074. The Supreme Court of Texas is accepting public comment. This form is 
not final. 
 

8.  If the judge gives you a Temporary Restraining Order, the judge may order 

you to pay a “bond.” Immediately ask the clerk how to do that. If the judge 
doesn’t give you a Temporary Restraining Order, you can skip this step. 

.  No matter what the judge decides about giving you a Temporary Restraining 
Order, immediately ask the clerk for help arranging “service” of your 
Application and, if the judge gives you one, the Temporary Restraining Order. 
“Service” is when a constable, sheriff, private process server, or the clerk—
not you—officially gives the Respondent a copy of your Application and, if the 
court gave you one, the Temporary Restraining Order. There is usually a fee 
for this service, but, if you turned in a Statement of Inability to Afford Court 
Costs, the clerk can arrange this service for free. 

10. Attend your hearing with the judge and the Respondent. You must attend 

the hearing even if you get a Temporary Restraining Order. It should be 
in about two weeks after you first talk to the judge, but the court clerk will be 
able to tell you the exact time and date. At the hearing, the judge will decide if 
you get an “Injunction” and for how long. An “Injunction” is a court order that 
orders the cyberbullying to stop for whatever time period the judge decides is 
appropriate. At the hearing, the judge will give you an opportunity to explain 
what has happened and why you believe it is cyberbullying. The judge or the 
Respondent may ask you questions. Tell the truth and give complete 
answers. Bring any evidence you have, like screenshots of the cyberbullying, 
to the hearing. If you do not attend the hearing, you will have to restart 
from the beginning. 

1. If the judge gives you an Injunction, the judge may order you to pay a “bond.” 
Immediately ask the clerk how to do that. If the judge doesn’t give you an 
Injunction, you can skip this step.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
