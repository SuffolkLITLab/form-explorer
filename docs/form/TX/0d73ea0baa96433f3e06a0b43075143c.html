      <pre>Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 
 
Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 

APPEAL NO.: 

11-016 

ESPONDENT: 

328th District Court, Fort Bend County 

ATE: 

 

February 16, 2012 

 

 

 

PECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge Stephen B. Ables, Chair; Judge John Ovard; Judge David 
Peeples; Judge Jeff Walker; Judge Kelly G. Moore 

On November 1, 2011, Petitioner submitted a Rule 12 request for eleven items to the 328th 
District Court (the “court” or “Respondent”).  The court sent an e-mail to Petitioner summarizing the 
eleven items as follows:  

to current; 

Items #1-2     The court‟s schedule/calendar of settings from July 1, 2007 to current; 
Items #3-4      Records regarding payments to court appointed attorneys from January 1, 2009 
 
Items #5-6     Records identifying civil appointed attorneys from January 1, 2009 to current; 
Items #7-8     List of attorneys eligible for civil case appointments from January 1, 2009 
 
Items #9-10   Any  and  all  existing  records  that  represent  a  chronological  and  logistical 
accounting of records that are customarily held by the District Clerk of Fort 
Bend County, Texas, on behalf of the “Presiding Judge”; and 
Phone records for any employee of the 328th District Court for county cell 
phone numbers.   

      to current; 

Item #11  

The court asked Petitioner to confirm that the summary was an accurate description of the 
requested records and asked for clarification regarding item numbers 9 and 10.  After failing to 
receive additional clarification or confirmation that the court‟s summary was accurate, Respondent 
provided to Petitioner the records responsive to item numbers 7 and 8 and advised him that the 
remaining records did not exist, were maintained by another entity or were not subject to Rule 12. 
Petitioner then filed this appeal. 

We  find  that  Respondent‟s  summary  of  the  requested  records  accurately  represents 
Petitioner‟s request.  Item numbers 1 and 2 are requests for written or electronic records used or 
maintained by or for the court and its personnel for the purpose of assisting the court in scheduling 
hearings, trials or other office duties.  In its reply to Petitioner‟s request, Respondent stated that all 
settings are entered into the Odyssey database system and can be accessed through a public access 
portal, and that handwritten notes are not retained once the settings are entered into Odyssey.  In his 
appeal, Petitioner states that he has seen the Respondent‟s court coordinator enter information into a 
binder that appears to contain docket information and that Respondent has failed to provide this

binder to Petitioner.  Respondent asserts that it did not know that this is what Petitioner was seeking 
and, based on this clarification, Respondent has agreed to provide a copy of the binder to Petitioner 
except for the redaction of entries that contain personal information or a judicial officer‟s future 
appointments that are exempt under Rule 12.5(d) and (h).  Respondent has provided a copy of the 
requested binder for our in camera review.  The items Respondent proposes to redact are docket 
information regarding sealed cases, Child Protective Services (CPS) cases and adoption cases; notes 
regarding observations or issues in specific cases, notes regarding personal appointments, events and 
vacations; appointments related to the court‟s business; notes indicating when the judge will be out 
or attending judicial conferences; and notes regarding moving the court‟s offices to a new location. 

Judicial calendars are available to the public subject to Rule 12 exemptions from disclosure.  
The portions  of a judicial calendar that are exempt from disclosure should be redacted prior to 
release.  See Rule 12 Decisions No. 10-011 and 11-009.  Though Rule 12.5(h) specifically exempts 
judicial calendar information that reflects a judicial officer‟s appointments that are in the future or 
that constitute an invasion of personal privacy, other Rule 12 exemptions also may apply.  We have 
reviewed the entries that Respondent has identified for redaction and find that the docket information 
(style, cause number, attorney and hearing type information) maintained in the binder related to CPS 
cases may not be withheld under any Rule 12.5 exemption.  However, docket information regarding 
an adoption case that discloses the name of a child may be withheld to maintain the confidentiality 
and privacy of the child and docket information regarding sealed cases may be withheld to maintain 
the confidentiality imposed by the court.  This information is exempt from disclosure under Rule 
12.5(i).  We also find that the entries that appear to be observations or reminders about specific cases 
constitute judicial work product and are exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5(a).  The disclosure 
of entries indicating a judge‟s personal, non-business related appointments and events constitutes an 
invasion of personal privacy and we find that this information is exempt from disclosure under Rule 
12.5(h).  However, the release of entries indicating that a judge or his employees are “out” or on 
“vacation” without additional details does not, in our opinion, constitute an invasion of personal 
privacy.  The public may not have a right to know where a judge goes for vacation, but it does have a 
right to know when judicial officers and their staff are working and when they are on leave.  Thus, 
this information is not exempt from disclosure unless it is for a future appointment.  Lastly, notes 
regarding appointments related to the judge‟s or the court‟s regular course of business, such as notes 
indicating an office move, appointments that reflect meetings with other judges and absences related 
to the judge‟s attendance at a judicial education conference, do not constitute an invasion of personal 
privacy; therefore, they are not exempt from disclosure unless they are for future appointments.   

Item numbers 3 and 4 are requests for records regarding payments made to court-appointed 
attorneys from January 1, 2009 to present.  Respondent informed Petitioner that the county auditor 
and  district  clerk  maintain  these  records,  but  failed  to  forward  Petitioner‟s  request  to  either.  
Petitioner argues that Respondent should have forwarded his request to the district clerk as required 
by Rule 12.6(f) and that he should have been provided the monthly reports that the district clerk 
sends to the Office of Court Administration (OCA) listing attorneys appointed in civil cases who 
receive  fees  of  $500  or  more  during  the  month.    Based  on  the  clarification  that  Petitioner  is 
requesting the OCA reports submitted by the district clerk, Respondent has asked the district clerk to 
provide this information to Petitioner.  Although Petitioner is correct that the appropriate response to 
his request was to have forwarded the request to the district clerk‟s office, Respondent has since 
made arrangements to have the records provided to Petitioner, and the issue is now moot. 
 

   

   

 

 

 
Item numbers 5 and 6 are requests for records related to the appointment of attorneys in civil 
cases.    Respondent  replied  that  the  information  responsive  to  this  request  consists  of  orders 
maintained in case files and are not subject to Rule 12.  A judicial record is one that is “made or 
maintained by or for a court or judicial agency in its regular course of business but not pertaining to 
its adjudicative function, regardless of whether that function relates to a specific case.”  Rule 12.2(d). 
Court orders are case records, not judicial records as defined by Rule 12.2(d).  Therefore, Rule 12 
does not apply to them1 and we are without authority to address this issue.  See Rule 12 Decisions 
11-010 and 11-011.   

Item numbers 9 and 10 are requests for records that “represent a chronological and logistical 
accounting of records that are customarily held by the District Clerk of Fort Bend County, Texas, on 
behalf of the „Presiding Judge‟ of the „Court‟ made, used or maintained by or for the „Court‟ and or 
its personnel and or „Presiding Judges,‟ that evidences the chain of custody of such records, from 
July 1, 2007, to and including the date of” the court‟s response to the request.  Petitioner failed to 
respond to Respondent‟s request for clarification of this item.  In his appeal, Petitioner argues that 
the plain language used to construct the request clearly defines the nature and scope of the requested 
records, and he defines the words “chronological,” “logistical/logistics,” “accounting/accountable,” 
“evidences,”    “chain  of  custody”  and  “records  that are customarily held  by the District  Clerk.”  
Respondent  maintains  that  the  information  provided  by  Petitioner  is  insufficient  to  reasonably 
identify the records being requested.  We agree.  Without further clarification, no further action is 
required of Respondent regarding this portion of Petitioner‟s request.  

Item number 11 is a request for billing information for cell phones used by or for the court for 
the purpose of assisting the court in scheduling hearings or trials or other office duties from July 1, 
2007 to present.  Respondent asserts that neither the judge nor his staff have cell phones that are paid 
for in whole or in part, with public funds.  Cell phone bills are subject to Rule 12 only if they are 
paid  for,  in  whole  or  in  part,  with  public  funds.    See  Rule  12  Decision  11-009.    Accordingly, 
Respondent does not have any records that are responsive to this item of Petitioner‟s request. 

Lastly, Petitioner asks that Respondent be sanctioned for failure to comply with Rule 12.  
Respondent appears to have made a good faith effort to comply with the request and responded 
appropriately  when  provided  additional  information  regarding  the  requested  records.    It  is  our 
opinion that Respondent did not knowingly fail to comply with Rule 12; therefore, sanctions under 
Rule 12.10 would not be appropriate. 

In summary, Respondent has agreed to provide some of the requested records at issue, with 
approved redactions, and  the remaining records at issue are not subject to Rule 12 or do not exist.  
Accordingly, the appeal is denied. 
 

   

   

   

   

                                                           
1 We note, however, that case records or court records which are not judicial records within the meaning of Rule 12 
may be open pursuant to other law such as the common-law right to public access.  See Rule 12 Decisions 00-001 
and 00-003.
