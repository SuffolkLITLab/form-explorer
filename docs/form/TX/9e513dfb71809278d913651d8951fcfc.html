      <pre>Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 
 
Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 

   

APPEAL NO.: 

15-016 

ESPONDENT: 

 

 
 
 

 

 
 

 

ATE: 

January 5, 2016 

Judge Chris Oldner, 416th Judicial District Court 
Judge Scott Becker, 219th Judicial District Court 
Judge John R. Roach, Jr., 296th District Court 

PECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge Stephen B. Ables, Chairman; Judge Billy Ray Stubblefield; 
Judge David Peeples; Judge Dean Rucker; Judge David L. Evans  

Petitioner requested  from Respondents “information existing in the records of the 219th 
Judicial District Court.”  Petitioner asked for records created during specific time periods ranging 
from January 1, 2015 through October 6, 2015.  The following is a summary of the four categories 
of records Petitioner requested: 

1)  documents and  communications by, between, to, from (including copies and blind copies) 
Respondents and the individuals appointed to serve as attorneys pro tem in the  criminal 
actions filed against Attorney General Ken Paxton;  

2)  documents and communications by, between, to, from (including copies and blind copies) 
Respondents  and  any  other  recipient  regarding  Attorney  General  Paxton  and  the  cases 
involving him; 

3)  documents and communications by, between, to, from (including copies and blind copies) 
Respondents and others relating to the position of Attorney Pro Tem, the persons appointed 
to  serve  as  attorneys  pro  tem  in  the  General  Paxton  case,  General  Paxton  and  another 
individual; and 

4)  documents and communications by, between, to, from (including copies and blind copies) 
the Collin County District Clerk or her staff,  members of the Commissioners’ Court and 
others  relating  to  the  position  of  Attorney  Pro  Tem,  the  persons  appointed  to  serve  as 
attorney pro tem in the General Paxton matter, and General Paxton. 

The  Respondents  denied  his  request  claiming  the  requested  records  are  exempt  from 
disclosure under Rules 12.5(a) and 12.5(f).  One of the Respondents also noted that he was not the 
custodian of the requested records as defined by Rule 12.2(e)(1) and referred the request to Judge 
Becker. Petitioner then filed this appeal. 

nly Judge Scott Becker, the presiding judge of the 219th Judicial District Court, responded 
to Petitioner’s appeal.  The judicial records of a court with only one judge are in the custody of that

judge.  See Rule 12.2(e)(1).  Because the request for records was limited to “records of the 219th 
Judicial District Court,” the other two Respondent’s did not need to respond to this appeal as they 
are not the custodians of the records of the 219th Judicial District Court.   

n his response to this appeal, Judge Becker maintains that the responsive records are exempt 
from disclosure under Rule 12.5(a), Judicial Work Product and Drafts, and Rule 12.5(f), Internal 
Deliberations on Court of Judicial Administration Matters.  He submitted the responsive records for 
our in camera review. 

s we discussed in Rule 12 Decision No. 15-010, matters related to a court’s adjudicative 
function are not subject to Rule 12.  Additionally, Rule 12.2(d) also provides that a “record of any 
nature created, produced, or filed in connection with any matter that is or has been before a court is 
not a judicial record.”  Most of the records submitted by Judge Becker pertain to matters that are 
related to the criminal matters involving General Paxton and were created, produced, or filed in 
connection with those cases.  These records are not judicial records under Rule 12 and we are 
without authority to grant the petition in whole or in part or to sustain the denial of access to them. 
  
 
 
Some of the records submitted by Judge Becker discuss matters related to the General Paxton 
case but they were not created, produced or filed in connection with the case.  Additionally, these 
records are not judicial work products and drafts and do not pertain to internal deliberations on court 
or judicial administration matters.  We grant the petition regarding these records and they should be 
released.

  A

We identified some records that contain information that is exempt from disclosure and some 
that is not.  The portions that are not subject to disclosure consist of internal deliberations on court or 
judicial administration matters and are exempt under Rule 12.5(f).  The appropriate response when a 
record contains some information that is subject to disclosure and some that is not is to redact the 
information that is not subject to disclosure.  See Rule 12.6(d).  We have marked the portions of the 
records submitted by Judge Becker that should be redacted.  The remainder of the documents should 
be released.   

Lastly, some of the records submitted by Judge Becker are records that pertain to internal 
deliberations regarding judicial administration matters and do not contain any information that is not 
subject to disclosure.  These records may be withheld. 

Judge Becker has authorized us to forward to Petitioner any records he submitted for our 
review that we determine are not exempt from disclosure.  Accordingly, we will forward these 
documents to Petitioner.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
