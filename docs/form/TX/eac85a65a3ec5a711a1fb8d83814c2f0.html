Legislative Edition – 82nd Legislature 

 

 

 

 

 

               September 2011 

The 82nd regular and special legislative sessions resulted in a number of  new laws of interest to the judiciary.  
Perhaps the most significant legislation was the court reorganization bill passed during the special session as HB 79.  
Highlights of HB 79 include: 
 

  Setting  the  minimum  jurisdictional  amount  of  district  courts  at  $500  and  raising  the  upper  jurisdictional 

limit of all statutory county courts to at least $200,000; 

  Generating  uniform  provisions  relating  to  all  statutory  county  courts  and  repealing  many  provisions 

  Discontinuing  small  claims  courts,  but  bringing  the  small-claims-court  model  of  handling  cases  into  the 

  Directing  the  Supreme  Court  to  promulgate  rules  of  civil  procedure  to  ensure  the  fair,  expeditious,  and 

specific to statutory county courts in particular counties;  
 

justice court provisions of Chapter 27, Government Code; 
 

inexpensive resolution of small claims cases; 
 

  Creating  general  provisions  for  the  appointment,  qualification,  compensation,  termination  and  powers  of 
“associate judges” while repealing many individual statutes creating masters, referees and magistrates; 
 

  Providing a structure for the receipt of gifts, grants, and donations for court system enhancements and child 

protection courts; 
 
 Clarifying procedures regarding vexatious litigants; and 
 

 

  Ordering  a  study  of  the  feasibility,  efficiency,  and  cost  of  converting  statutory  county  courts  with  civil 

jurisdiction in excess of $200,000 into district courts;    

This report briefly  summarizes new legislation directly impacting the Texas  court system, judges, clerks, and 
other judicial actors.  No attempt is made to cover substantive areas of the law in detail; other entities are expected 
to  provide  legislative  updates  on  substantive  legal  topics.    We  hope  the  report  will  be  a  useful  resource  for  the 
judicial and legal community and all those interested in the administration of justice.
