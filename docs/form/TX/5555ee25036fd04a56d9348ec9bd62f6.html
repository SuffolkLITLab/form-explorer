Executive Summary 

his report describes the methods and results of a 

research enquiry conducted by the National Center for 
State Courts on workload in the district courts in Texas.  
The organizing question is how many judicial officers 
(district judges, associate judges, masters, magistrates, and 
referees) are needed in Texas to provide for the equitable 
handling of cases in the district courts? 

he basic methodology used by the NCSC is the 

calculation of the average amount of work time judicial 
officers devote to different types of cases. Because cases 
vary according to complexity, the averages, called “case 
weights,” also vary. Based on a classification of cases 
agreed to by the Judicial Needs Assessment Committee, 
there is substantial variation in case weights, as shown in 
the figure below.

The case weights represent the average amount of time 
judicial officers spend on the handling of cases in the 
district courts.  When the case weights are applied to 
filings in individual jurisdictions, the judicial workload 
can be calculated.  

he overarching conclusion is that there is a need for 
approximately 650 full-time equivalent judicial officer 
positions to manage and resolve the annual number of 
cases filed, an increase of about 8 percent over current 
levels. 

he results indicate that 31 counties need additional 
judicial officer resources to adequately handle existing

Measuring Current Judicial Workload in Texas, 2007 

I. Introduction 
 

“Ensuring the judiciary is sufficiently funded would have an insignificant effect on the state’s budget overall, but would have 
a tremendous impact on all the Texas citizens who seek justice through our courts.” 
 

State of the Judiciary in Texas, 2007 
Chief Justice Wallace B. Jefferson 

s such, the OCA contracted with the National 

Center for State Courts (NCSC) to develop a 
method to measure the amount of judicial officer 
(district judge, associate judge, master, magistrate, 
or referee) work in the Texas district courts.  A 
clear and comprehensible measure of the amount 
of work (hereafter, workload) is central to 
determining how many judicial officers are needed 
to handle cases coming before the court.  
Adequate resources are essential if the Texas 
judiciary is to manage and resolve court business 
without delay while also delivering quality service 
to litigants and the public.  Meeting these 
challenges involves assessing, in an objective 
manner, the number of judicial officers required 
to handle cases and whether judicial resources are 
being allocated and used prudently.  This initiative 
is consistent with the trend of judicial leaders 
around the world to embrace empirically-based 
workload assessments in building a fair and valid 
justification for public resources. 

 basic premise of a weighted caseload study is 
that all types of cases should be given individual 
judicial time and attention, but that the amount of 
time should be proportional to what each case 
warrants. Because cases vary in their degree of 
complexity, workload analysis studies seek to 
determine the corresponding amount of time that 
is and should be given to different types of cases. 
By weighting cases according to complexity, a 
more accurate assessment can be made of the 
amount of judicial officer time required to handle 
court business.

he recommendation for conducting a weighted 
caseload study originated with the Texas Judicial 
Council (Council), which advocated a more 
objective and accurate methodology to properly 
evaluate the workload of the courts.  In December 
2000, the Council recommended the State seek “the 
assistance of the National Center for State Courts 
or some other outside entity to conduct a weighted 
caseload study.” 

n May 2001, the Texas Legislature (77th Regular 
Session) attached a rider to S.B. 1 (the 
Appropriations Act) that required the Council to 
“prepare a report on current district court locations, 
populations served, docket activity, and other 
appropriate variables that would inform a legislative 
determination on the need for creating additional 
district courts.”  In the report prepared by the 
Judicial Council’s Committee on District Courts, 
and adopted by the Council in September 2002, it 
was recommended that the Legislature appropriate 
the necessary funding to the Office of Court 
Administration (OCA) and the Council for the 
implementation of a weighted caseload study for 
district courts.  It was further recommended that 
the Legislature consider funding for a weighted 
caseload study of Texas’ entire court system. 

n 2005, the Texas Legislature (79th Regular 
Session) passed S.B. 729, which called for a 
weighted caseload study of the district courts to be 
undertaken "for the purpose of making 
recommendations regarding the implementation of 
a systematic approach for analyzing the need for 
new district courts." S.B. 729 directed the OCA to 
contract with a nonprofit organization that 
specializes in providing technical assistance and 
consulting services to courts to conduct a weighted 
caseload study of the district courts.

ocus on Judicial Officers 

his study is designed to examine the work 
performed by all district court judges, county-
employed associate judges, magistrates, masters 
and referees, and OCA associate judges (hereafter, 
judicial officers), processing the type of cases 
heard in the Texas district courts.1  As of October 
2007, there were 601.2 full-time equivalent (FTE) 
judicial officers distributed across the 254 counties 
of Texas.  The three largest groups of judicial 
officers included 447 FTE district court judges, 
55.6 FTE county-employed associate judges, and 
42.5 FTE OCA IV-D associate judges, as shown 
in Figure 1. A complete census of judicial officers 
can be found in Appendix A.

1 At its May 18, 2007 meeting, JNAC decided that in counties 
selected for participation in the district court time study, county 
courts at law that exercise civil or family law jurisdiction concurrent 
with the district courts should be asked to participate in the time 
study.  Letters were sent to all the judges of the county courts at law 
with statutory authority to handle those cases, inviting those of them 
who actually exercise that jurisdiction to participate in the study.  
However, low participation in the time study by these county court at 
law judges prevented them from being included in the final model.  
Thus, the study was limited to the district courts.

his report describes the methods and results of 
NCSC’s research, conducted over an 18-month 
period during 2007-08, on the work and caseload of 
judicial officers in Texas.  The assessment addresses 
the pertinent question of how many judicial officers 
are needed in Texas to provide for the handling of 
cases in the district courts in an empirically based, 
rigorous manner.  Based on this rationale, the 
primary goals of this study are: 

  Understand the complex nature of how work in 
the district courts is handled by judicial officers.  

  Develop a clear measure of judicial workload in 

Texas. 

  Establish a transparent formula for the OCA to 
use in assessing the levels of judicial resources 
necessary to handle cases in the district courts.

For purposes of the six jurisdictional patterns, the 
term ‘jurisdiction’ means geographical jurisdiction, 
not subject-matter jurisdiction.3  

 
The 171 district courts comprising Jurisdictional 
Patterns 3 through 6 account for approximately 
30% of all filings in Texas.  These courts serve 
multiple counties and often require significant 
travel on the part of the judicial officers who serve 
them.  The six jurisdictional patterns are defined 
as follows: 

urisdictional Pattern 1 
Single County, Multiple Courts, No Courts 
Serve Another County 

ounties that have multiple courts that do not 
serve another county characterize Jurisdictional 
Pattern 1.  For example, Angelina County has two 
district courts (159th and 217th).  In total, there are 
261 Jurisdictional Pattern 1 courts in 26 different 
counties.  Jurisdictional Pattern 1 contains the 
counties with the largest number of district courts 
statewide (Bexar–24 district courts, Tarrant–26, 
Dallas–39, and Harris–59), while also containing 
five counties that have only two district courts 
each (Angelina, Ellis, Kaufman, Nacogdoches, and 
Parker).

II.  Jurisdictional Patterns  
Of District Courts 
 

“The Texas trial court system, complex from its 
inception, has become ever more confusing as ad hoc 
responses are devised to meet the needs of an urban, 
industrialized society.  No one person understands or 
can hope to understand all the nuances and 
intricacies of Texas’ thousands of trial courts.” 
 

Citizen’s Commission on the Texas Judicial System,  
Report and Recommendations– 
Into the Twenty-First Century, 1993 

exas’ multi-tiered trial court system consists of 

municipal courts, justice courts, constitutional 
county courts, statutory county courts, statutory 
probate courts, and district courts.2  The focus of 
the current study is on work handled in the district 
courts.  

o understand the complex geographical system of 

district courts—where many courts’ boundaries 
overlap wholly or partially with some other 
court(s)—a taxonomy of jurisdictional boundary-
overlap patterns was developed. The 447 district 
courts covering 254 counties fit into six 
jurisdictional patterns, as shown in Figure 2.

configuration of which counties are served by which district courts, 
the census accounting for the number of judicial officers will change 
along with the composition of the six jurisdictional patterns.

Jurisdictional Pattern 4 
Multiple Counties, Single Court 

here are 25 district courts representing 71 
counties in Jurisdictional Pattern 4.  In this 
pattern, a single district court is responsible for 
multiple counties.  For example, the 38th District 
Court services Medina, Real, and Uvalde counties.  
There is a range of two to five counties per district 
court in Jurisdictional Pattern 4.

Single County, Single Court, Court Does Not

here are 15 Jurisdictional Pattern 2 courts 

representing 15 different counties.  For example, 
the 235th District Court only serves Cooke County.  
Counties included in Jurisdictional Pattern 2, with a 
single district court, include: Cooke, Coryell, 
Eastland, Erath, Harrison, Hill, Hood, Lamb, 
Milam, Navarro, Palo Pinto, Rockwall, Rusk, Van

u dictional Pattern 3 represents the first of t
ris
he 
patterns that includes multiple counties.  Multiple 
courts that serve multiple counties, but have 
identical jurisdictions define this pattern.  For
 
example, the 64th and the 242nd District Courts
serve Castro, Swisher, and Hale counties and only 
those counties.  Overall there are 13 Jurisdictional 
Pattern 3 courts serving a total of 23 different 
counties.  District courts in this pattern serve as
as three counties and as many as five (e.g., 
Atascosa, Frio, Karnes, La Salle, and Wilson

).

County, while the 27th District Court serves both 
Bell and Lampasas counties.  Each of the 
Jurisdictional Pattern 5 groupings of districts courts 
(e.g., Bell and Lampasas) can be classified as a

organized into 14 different clusters of counties.

f all the jurisdictional patterns, Jurisdictional 
Pattern 6 represents the most complex mosaic of 
district courts.  District courts within this pattern 
work in single or multiple counties with either 
distinct or overlapping jurisdictions.  There are no 
counties in this jurisdictional pattern that are served 
by a court that does not also serve at least one 
additional county.  For example, the eight counties 
of Hardin, Jasper, Newton, Panola, Sabine, San 
Augustine, Shelby, and Tyler represent a cluster of 
counties that comprise the work of six district 
courts.  The 123rd District Court is the sole district 
court in Panola County.  The 123rd District Court 
also serves Shelby County along with the 273rd

comprehensible and stable number of categories. 
Furthermore, the case types should also allow for 
future updating of the case weights and still allow 
for accurate representation of workload.   

istrict court case filings are reported to OCA by 

each of the district clerks elected in the 254 
counties throughout Texas.  Twenty-seven case 
type categories are currently used by the district 
clerks to report case filings.  These categories 
cover criminal, civil, family and juvenile case types.  
It should be noted that only two case type 
categories, delinquency and conduct indicating a 
need for supervision, are currently used for 
reporting juvenile case filings.  

urrently, the Judicial Council is undertaking a 
major revision to the structure and content of 
statewide court statistics reporting.  One benefit 
of the new court statistics reporting system will be 
the provision of considerably more information 
and detail on the flow of cases through the Texas 
courts.  The number of case type categories 
available to district clerks for reporting purposes 
will increase from 27 to more than 40 with the 
juvenile case type categories being expanded to 
more closely parallel the criminal case type 
categories used in adult criminal cases.  In 
anticipation of the new reporting system, JNAC 
determined that data should be collected in a 
manner that will allow for filings to be used from 
the current reporting system when developing the 
initial case weights and filings to be used from the 
future system when updating the case weights.  
JNAC ultimately approved 24 case types for use in 
the weighted caseload study.

III. Judicial Needs 
Assessment Committee 

 first step in the NCSC workload assessment was 
the establishment of a policy committee to provide 
oversight and guidance throughout the life of the 
research.  Specifically, the committee, called the 
Judicial Needs Assessment Committee (JNAC), was 
charged with refining the approach and content of 
the proposed research and resolving important 
issues affecting data collection, interpretation, and 
analysis. The Committee consisted of 12 district 
judges, two county court at law judges, one child 
protection associate judge, one district court 
administrator, one district and county court 
administrator, and one county court administrator. 
A complete list of members of the Judicial Needs 
Assessment Committee is available in the 
Acknowledgements section of this report.5   

hrough a series of meetings, the policy committee 

monitored the development of the workload 
assessment methodology and reviewed and 
finalized each phase and the results of the study.  
One of the first responsibilities of JNAC was to 
identify and define the parameters for which data 
would be collected during the workload assessment.  
This included adopting the six jurisdictional 
patterns as an organizing framework and 
identifying: (a) the types of cases judicial officers 
handle; and, (b) the tasks and activities (case-related 
events and non-case-related functions) that judicial 
officers perform in and out of court. 

ase Types 

 fundamental premise of the NCSC study is that 
more complex cases require more time to process.  
Knowing the average amount of time devoted to 
different types of cases allows for the estimation of 
judicial officer need in relation to the number and 
relative complexity of cases handled.  As a result, 
selecting an appropriate set of case type categories 
is important. 

he case types should reflect the way Texas judicial 

officers and court administrators actually classify 
and count cases and they should form a meaningful, 

                                                 
5 Meetings with JNAC were held in February 2007, May 2007, and 
February 2008.

Activities 

udicial officers perform a variety of functions, 
both in and out of court, related to the handling 
of cases (case-related activities), as well as a variety 
of non-case-related activities.  To identify the full 
set of tasks and activities that judicial officers 
perform, NCSC worked with OCA to generate a 
list of activities, ultimately approved by JNAC, to 
serve as an organizing guide for data collection 
during the research.  A list of the four case-related 
events and the eight non-case-related activities are 
provided in Figures 10 and 11.  A more detailed

ecause the new court statistics system will not be

Consequently, data from the 24 case types used 
during the one-month data collection period are 
collapsed into 12 case weight categories that 
accommodate both the current and future systems 
for reporting by counties throughout the state.6

The case weights are calculated by summing all 
judicial officer time recorded for each case type8 
and dividing by a three-year average of the 
number of cases filed for each case type during 
FY 2005-2007.9  This result provides a picture of 
current practice: the average amount of time 
currently spent by judicial officers in Texas 
handling each type of case, as shown in Figure 12.

he case weights represent the average amount of 
ime judicial officers currently spend on the 
or

example, judicial officers in Texas are currently
spending, on average, 186 minutes handling a 
 
Felony Group A case (capital murder, murder,
 
robbery/aggravated robbery, etc.) from filing to
disposition.  Some cases take more time and som

8 During the time study, judicial officer time was collected during 
October 2007, a representative one-month period. During the 
analysis phase, all time collected during the time study was weighted 
to represent one year of time.  This conversion was necessary to 
ensure comparability and consistency with the annual filings data. 
9 A three-year average was used to establish a longer term trend in 
filings by case category.  The three-year averages serve to smooth 
short term annual fluctuations so that the case weights are more 
accurate estimates of the average time spent by judges resolving each 
particular type of case. 
10  Since current filing counts cannot be disaggregated by type of 
judicial officer handling the case, the case weights represent the 
combined work of all judicial officers handling aspects of cases filed 
with the district courts.  This means that in some courts the weights 
may be reflective of the combined effort of multiple types of judicial 
officers (e.g., district court judges and magistrates), while in other 
courts all the work may be performed exclusively by district court 
judges.

IV. Time Study  

o establish a baseline of current practice, NCSC 

staff used a Web-based process to collect 
information on the amount of time judicial officers 
currently spend on various activities throughout the 
day, including case-related and non-case-related 
activities.  JNAC decided that all judicial officers 
from a stratified random sample of 97 of the 254 
counties in Texas would be asked to participate in 
the time study.7  To assist participants, NCSC 
provided training to judicial officers at the Texas 
Associate Judges Conference (July 2007), the 
Annual Judicial Conference (September 2007), and 
through a live Webinar session and several online 
tutorials.  Additionally, to encourage participation, 
NCSC and OCA staff members made site visits to 
Bexar, Dallas, Harris, and Travis counties in August 
2007.   

he time study was conducted during the entire 
month of October 2007.  Throughout the month, 
judicial officers were asked to track and record the 
time they spent handling cases by both case type 
and case-related event.   

ase Weights 

he data allow for the construction of case weights 

for each of the 12 case types for which statewide 
filing counts exist (see Figure 9).  By developing 
separate case weights for different case types, the 
research takes into account variable case complexity 
and the different amounts of judicial officer time 
and attention spent in handling different types of 
cases. The NCSC weighted caseload study is thus in 
a position to estimate judicial officer need based on 
the composition of case filings rather than on just 
the total number of filings. Relying solely on the 
sheer number of cases to determine the demands 
placed on judicial officers ignores the varying levels 
of resources needed to handle different types of 
cases effectively.   

                                                 
7 Certain clusters of counties were selected for the time study given that 
these counties are served by the same court(s) across the counties.  For 
example, the 51st District Court serves Tom Green, Coke, Irion, 
Schleicher, and Sterling counties.  Not including all of these counties 
would have required that the judge only report on a subset of the total 
workload of that court.  A complete listing of counties included in the 
sample can be found in Appendix A.

15 courts.  Because the case management system 
used by these courts have distinct counts of the 
child protection case filings, case weights were 
developed specific to the child protection cases 
handled by the OCA CPCs. 

he analysis produced a case weight of 323 
minutes per filing for these cases, and clearly 
illustrates the fact that child protection cases 
require a great deal of judicial officer time to 
resolve.  While the 323 minute case weight applies 
to the 15 OCA CPCs, it is a reasonable 
assumption that other judges in Texas hearing 
child protection cases likely spend similar time 
moving these cases from filing to disposition.   

owever, due to the nature of the current case 
type categories used by district clerks to report 
filings to OCA, a similarly focused analysis of all 
child protection cases throughout the state is not 
yet possible.  Because the new reporting system 
coming online in FY 2010 will have a distinct case 
type category for child protection cases, a priority 
for OCA will be the development of a specific 
case weight for all child protection cases in Texas, 
regardless of whether the cases are heard by the 
OCA CPC associate or assigned judges or other 
judges not part of the OCA Specialty Courts 
Program.  At this time, all judicial officer time spent 
hearing child protection cases has been 
incorporated into the case weight for Other 
Family Law. 

hen the case weights in Figure 12 are applied to 

filings in individual jurisdictions the implied 
workload and thus, the need for judicial officers 
can be calculated.  However, before this can be 
accomplished the judicial officer year value must 
be established. 

etermining the Judicial Officer Year Value 

hree factors contribute to the calculation of 
implied judicial officer need: filings, case weights, and 
the judicial officer year value.  The relationship 
among these elements is expressed as follows: 
 

Workload = Filings x Case Weights 

 

Implied Judicial Officer Need =  
Workload ÷ Judicial Officer Year Value

cases take less time, but on average judges spend 
this amount of time on Felony Group A cases.   

erhaps no case is an “average” case taking exactly 

186 minutes of judge time.  By design, the case 
weights account for the longer lasting events such 
as a trial but also the shorter duration events which 
are quite common, such as arraignments, pretrial 
motions, and pleas.  Indeed, a murder case that 
goes to jury trial will consume considerably more 
than 186 minutes of a judge’s time to reach final 
disposition.  On the other hand, negotiated pleas 
accepted at an arraignment will consume much less 
than 186 minutes of the judge’s time. During the 
course of the study, the time recorded by the judges 
included both the long and short duration activities.  
And the average amount of time spent by judicial 
officers resolving the full spectrum of Felony 
Group A cases is 186 minutes.  See Appendix F for 
a more expansive listing of the many types of case-
related events. 

nother strength of the weighted caseload 
approach is the ability to focus on the judicial 
officer workload associated with important case 
types for which standardized statewide data do not 
yet exist and, in the process, clarify and prioritize 
essential data needs.  Child protection cases offer a 
key example of this issue. OCA administers 15 
different courts devoted to hearing child protection 
cases in various regions throughout Texas.  These 
are not courts in the traditional sense; they are 
dockets composed exclusively of child abuse and 
neglect cases that have been referred to an associate 
or assigned “visiting” judge for handling.  
Collectively, these 15 courts or dockets are part of 
OCA’s Specialty Courts Program and are commonly 
referred to as the Child Protection Courts (CPCs).  
This arrangement is possible by virtue of the 
regional presiding, district and statutory county 
court judges being allowed to refer these cases to 
associate or assigned “visiting” judges.  The OCA 
CPCs handle approximately 30% of all the child 
protection cases in the state. 

he associate judges, employees of OCA, and the 

assigned judges who staff the CPC’s fully 
participated in the weighted caseload study.  
Additionally, OCA maintains a case management 
system that the 15 CPCs use to track their cases.  
As a result, NCSC and OCA were able to conduct a 
focused analysis of the workload dynamics of these

practice;  

•  Community outreach and public education; and  
•  Lunch and breaks. 

he distinction between case-related and non-
case-related time recognizes that judicial officers 
have many varied responsibilities during the day.   

fter considerable discussion with JNAC that 
drew on results from the time study, two separate 
judicial officer day values were recommended by 
the NCSC and adopted by JNAC.  Different day 
values were deemed appropriate to account for 
the variation in travel requirements between 
judicial officers in Jurisdictional Patterns 1 and 2 
and judicial officers in the other patterns.  

udicial officers in Jurisdictional Patterns 1 and 2 
are expected to work 6 hours per day on case-
related matters and 2 hours per day on non-case-
related matters, plus 1 hour per day for lunch and 
breaks.  Judicial officers in Jurisdictional Patterns 
3, 4, 5, and 6 are expected to work 5.5 hours per 
day on case-related matters and 2.5 hours per day 
on non-case-related matters, plus 1 hour per day 
for lunch and breaks.   

 

3. The judicial officer year value.  This factor is 
the amount of time per year that a judicial officer 
has available to do case-related work (after 
subtracting time spent on non-case related 
activities such as travel and administrative 
activities). It is calculated by multiplying the 
judicial officer year by the number of hours in a 
day available for case-related work.  Hence, the 
judicial officer year value for judicial officers 
working in Jurisdictional Patterns 1 and 2 is 
77,400 minutes of case-related time per judicial 
officer per year (215 days x 6.0 hours per day x 60 
minutes per hour) and 70,950 minutes of case-
related time per judicial officer per year in 
Jurisdictional Patterns 3, 4, 5, and 6 (215 days x 
5.5 hours per day x 60 minutes per hour). 

  T

  J

The judicial officer year value represents the 
amount of time in a year judicial officers have to 
complete case-related tasks.  Arriving at this value is 
a two-stage process that entails calculating how 
many days per year are available for judicial officers 
to perform case-related work (the judicial officer work-
year) and then determining how many business 
hours each day are available for case-related work as 
opposed to non-case-related work (the judicial officer 
day).  Multiplying these two measures gives the 
judicial officer year value, which is an estimate of the 
amount of time a judicial officer has, on average, to 
handle cases during the year.   

. The judicial officer work-year.  Calculating the 
"average" judicial officer work-year requires 
determining the number of days a judicial officer 
has per year to perform case-related tasks.  After 
deducting weekends, holidays, vacation, sick leave, 
and continuing legal education from 365 days, it 
was determined by JNAC that judicial officers in 
Texas have, on average, 215 days available each year 
to perform case-related activities.  

. The judicial officer day. The judicial officer day 
is separated into two parts: the amount of time 
devoted to (a) case-related and (b) non-case-related 
activities.11   

(a) Case-related time includes all time devoted to 

such activities as:  

•  Hearing cases on the bench;  
•  Reviewing case files and documents in the 

preparation for hearings and making decisions 
on cases; 

•  Researching specific points of law related to 

cases; and 

•  Preparing and issuing orders and making 

decisions (findings of fact, conclusions of law).  

b) Non-case-related time includes time devoted to:  
•  Court-related travel; 
•  Activities required of judges to contribute to the 
efficient and effective operation of the court 
(e.g., supervising personnel, meeting with clerks 
about administrative matters, and participating 
on state and local committees);

V. Calculating Implied 
Judicial Officer Need   

Implied judicial officer need” refers to the number 
of judicial officers needed statewide in Texas as a 
result of applying the weighted caseload model. The 
results reported below make use of the following 
concepts: 
 

Current Workload =  
FY 2007 Filings x Case Weights 

 

Implied Judicial Officer Need =  
Current Workload ÷ Judicial Officer Year Value 

esults are calculated for all 254 counties and then 
compared to the actual number of judicial officers 
working in each county to determine where 
additional judicial resources would be most 
beneficial. 
 

Measuring Current Judicial Workload in Texas, 2007 

Judicial Officer Need 

Figure 13 contains the implied need calculations 
for judicial officers in Angelina County.   

For example, multiplying the 164 Felony Group A 
FY 2007 filings by the case weight of 186 minutes 
generates a workload of 30,504 minutes.  When 
each of the case weights is applied to the 
corresponding filings, the result is a workload of 
approximately 183,000 minutes of work.  Dividing 
the resultant workload by the judicial officer year value 
for Jurisdictional Pattern 1 courts (77,400 
minutes) translates into an implied need of 2.4 full-
time equivalent (FTE) judicial officers.   

Angelina County currently has 2.6 judicial officers 
handling district court work (2 FTE district court 
judges, .3 FTE OCA IV-D associate judges and .3 
FTE OCA child protection associate judges)12 or 
a difference of .2 FTE judicial officers.  The 
comparison of the implied need to the actual 
judicial officers handling district court work will 
be the focus of the next section.

Measuring Current Judicial Workload in Texas, 2007 

district courts should be welcomed.  The rationale 
was that the calculated implied judicial officer 
need from the weighted caseload model represents 
a reasonable level of staffing that should be present 
in all counties, but not an optimal level.  Because 
higher staffing levels likely increase the level and 
quality of service to the public, it was agreed that 
jurisdictions where the actual number of judicial 
officers exceeded the implied need would be “held 
harmless.”  

ollowing extensive discussion, JNAC developed 

the following decision rule for calculating 
Estimated Need: 

  If implied need is greater than actual number, 

then estimated need equals implied need 

 
•  If implied need is less than actual number, then 
estimated need equals actual number (hold 
harmless) 

wo examples clarify the use of this decision rule.  

First, building on an earlier example, the hold 
harmless approach is illustrated in Figure 14. 
Angelina County shows an implied need of 2.4 
FTE judicial officers.  This is .2 FTE less than the 
actual number of judicial officers.  Therefore, 

  Because 2.4 FTE (implied need) is less than 2.6 

FTE (actual judicial officers), 

  Estimated need equals 2.6 FTE (hold harmless) 

ollowing the hold harmless approach, Angelina 
County has an estimated need of 2.6 FTE judicial 
officers, equivalent to the current complement of 
judicial officers.

Calculating Estimated Need 

aving calculated the implied judicial officer need, 

the next step is to compare this number with the 
actual number of judicial officers in each county 
and determine which value is larger.   

ecause implied need can be greater than, less than, 

or equal to the actual number of judicial officers, 
JNAC developed a decision rule on how to address 
each possible situation.  They were particularly 
interested in how weighted caseload will help 
identify the counties that are relatively under-
resourced and provide a reliable estimate of the 
number of judicial officers needed. 

eighted caseload introduces a measure of 
statewide comparability that supports efforts to 
ensure all citizens of Texas have similar access to 
the judicial system.  Case weights measure the 
average time spent by judicial officers resolving 
cases statewide and, therefore, offer a common 
yardstick for measuring the need for judicial 
resources.  Furthermore, weighted caseload 
provides an objective means to measure relative 
need for judicial officers across different 
jurisdictional patterns and among jurisdictions of 
different sizes.    

he implied judicial officer need calculation 

provides a basic benchmark for assessing whether 
litigants and the public are receiving equitable levels 
of judicial service throughout the state. For some 
counties, implied judicial officer need is greater than 
the actual number of judicial officers, suggesting the 
county is under-resourced.   In these counties, 
either the press of caseload volume or resource 
constraints is such that judicial officers are made to 
spend less than the statewide average time handling 
cases.  JNAC determined that counties fitting this 
description are good candidates to be ranked as the 
highest priority for receiving additional judicial 
resources.   

NAC members were also committed to preserving 
judicial staffing levels in counties that are able to 
spend more time per case than the statewide 
average.  There was consensus among the JNAC 
members that a willingness by counties to provide 
judicial resources above the average level by 
employing associate judges, masters, magistrates, 
and referees to assist with the workload of the

n addition, there are a .7 FTE OCA IV-D 
associate judge and a .8 FTE OCA child 
protection associate judge in Bell County for a 
total of 6.5 FTE judicial officers in the 
Bell/Lampasas cluster.  In Figure 15, workload 
and the resultant implied judicial officer need are 
calculated for Bell and Lampasas counties.  Bell 
County has an implied need of 8.0 FTE judicial 
officers and Lampasas County has an implied 
need for .4 FTE, or a combined 8.4 FTE implied 
need for the cluster.

 second example from Jurisdictional Pattern 5 

shows a situation where the actual number of 
judicial officers is less than the implied need, 
suggesting a strong case for additional judicial 
officers.  Referencing Figure 7, four district courts 
(146th, 169th, 264th, and 426th) serve only Bell 
County, while the 27th District Court serves both 
Bell and Lampasas counties.  Since the work of the 
27th District Court in Lampasas County cannot be 
separated from the work done by the 27th District 
Court in Bell County, the two counties are treated 
as a cluster of courts within Jurisdictional Pattern 5.

9.1 FTEs (2.6 for Angelina and 6.5 for the 
Bell/Lampasas cluster).  The implied need for the 
three counties is 10.8 FTEs (2.4 for Angelina and 
8.4 for the Bell/Lampasas cluster).  However, 
applying the hold harmless rule means that 
estimated need is not simply 10.8 FTEs (the 
implied need), but, rather, 11.0 FTEs – the actual 
FTE count for Angelina County (2.6) and the 
implied need for the Bell/Lampasas cluster (8.4).  
Keeping this decision rule in mind is important 
for a clear understanding of the statewide 
summary data presented below and the detailed 
information shown in Appendix H.

n examination of Appendix H shows that the 

model fits very well in the vast majority of 
counties.  JNAC members confirm that in almost 
all instances, the model produces judicial need 
estimates that are credible and defensible. The 
weighted caseload model provides clear guidance 
on the counties and/or clusters of counties where 
relative need for additional judicial resources is 
greatest.

Figure 16 displays the estimated need calculation of 
1.9 FTE judicial officers.  The implied need for the 
cluster is 8.4 judicial officers, while the actual 
judicial officer FTE for the cluster is 6.5 FTE.  
Therefore, 
 

•  Because 8.4 FTE (implied need) is greater than 

6.5 FTE (actual judicial officers),  

  Estimated need equals 8.4 FTE

hen the statewide case weights are applied to FY 
2007 filings and the resultant workload is divided by 
the two distinct judicial year values, the result is an 
implied need statewide of 589.7 FTE judicial 
officers.  Applying the JNAC decision rule 
(incorporating hold harmless) produces an 
estimated need of 650.1 FTE judicial officers 
statewide.  The estimated need by jurisdictional 
pattern is displayed in Figure 17 and a complete set 
of results by county can be found in Appendix H.   

n the adjacent summary table (Figure 17), the 
column labeled Estimated Need (FTE) is not 
necessarily equal to either Actual (FTE) or Implied 
(FTE) for a particular Jurisdictional Pattern.  The 
reason has to do with the application of the hold 
harmless rule at the county level.   

s discussed earlier, the estimated need (FTE) for a 
given county or cluster of counties may be equal to 
the actual (FTE) count or the implied (FTE) need 
depending on which is larger.  For example, as 
shown Figures 14 and 16, the combined actual FTE 
count for Angelina, Bell and Lampasas counties is

Measuring Current Judicial Workload in Texas, 2007 

verall, the greatest need for judicial officers is 
found within Jurisdictional Pattern 1.  Currently 
there are 365.9 FTE judicial officers and an 
estimated need of 405.5 FTE judicial officers in this 
pattern.  The model indicates a majority of the extra 
judicial officers are needed in Harris County, where 
the estimated need is 27 additional judicial officers 
above their current complement.  Because the 
weighted caseload model is based on average 
statewide case processing practices and fits well in 
other counties throughout the state, an estimated 
need of the magnitude found in Harris County 
requires additional investigation beyond the scope 
of the current study.  Possible factors include 
economies of scale, more efficient case 
management practices, and the well-integrated use 
of technology. 

he results from Jurisdictional Pattern 4 illustrate 

another important aspect of judicial workload 
assessment—the need to provide adequate 
accessibility to the courts in all areas of the state.  In 
some instances, most common in single court, rural 
jurisdictions, measured workload is less than the 
standard set for the judicial officer year value.  That 
is, the annual judicial workload (as measured by the 
case weights) is less than 70,950 minutes (the judicial 
officer year value).  In these situations, measured 
workload becomes secondary to ensuring litigants 
and the public have reasonable access to a judicial 
officer without traveling excessive distances.  As 
many areas in Texas continue to grow, particularly 
around the large metropolitan areas, the weighted 
caseload system will provide early notice on rising 
judicial workload as well as indicate when additional 
resources become necessary.

ecommendation #3: 

he case weights developed in this report are 
derived from the time study and reflect current 
practice.  A structured assessment of current 
practice should be undertaken to assess whether 
the case weights allow sufficient time for equitable 
and effective case resolution as well as support 
judicial efforts directed at efficient case 
management and quality performance.  This type 
of assessment will provide a means to determine 
the appropriate judicial complement needed to 
allow judicial officers to listen to victims, acquire 
and adequately consider important factors related 
to pretrial custody decisions and sentences, 
monitor and enforce compliance orders, meet 
statutorily defined timelines and interact 
appropriately with the public.   

onclusion 

verall, the research undertaken to assess the 
workload of Texas’ district courts has been a 
success.  A much greater level of knowledge is 
now available about the various workload 
demands placed upon the district courts.  The 
state now has a reliable tool to assist in the 
decision-making process for determining whether 
and where new district courts are needed.  The 
legislature will no longer have to view all cases as 
being equal in terms of workload demand; rather, 
empirically derived estimates of workload 
associated with various case types are available.  
As a result, more informed decisions can be made 
regarding the need for district courts. 

deally, this process will be the first step in a 
continuing effort to accurately measure judicial 
workload beyond strictly counting case filings.  
The entire judiciary could benefit greatly from 
similar workload evaluations.  To that end, JNAC 
made clear at its meeting on May 18, 2007 that the 
ultimate goal is for a weighted caseload study of 
the entire Texas trial court system to be 
conducted.  Such an undertaking would be a 
challenge, but the potential for improved 
understanding of judicial workload is too 
important to ignore.

VI. Recommendations 
And Conclusion 

he workload standards suggest the need for 650.1 

FTE judicial officers to effectively handle the 
district court caseload of Texas.  These workload 
standards are grounded in current practice (as 
measured by the NCSC research) and were 
reviewed by JNAC.  Three recommendations are 
made below to maintain the integrity and utility of 
the workload standards. 

ecommendation #1: 

CSC recommends updating judicial officer need 
on an annual basis using the most recent case filings 
data.  Calculating judicial officer need on a yearly 
basis necessitates that cases be counted consistently 
and accurately for all case type categories defined in 
this report.  OCA and the district courts should 
continue to work together to ensure accuracy and 
reliability in the reporting of case filings data.   

ecommendation #2: 

ver time the integrity of workload standards are 
affected by multiple influences, including changes 
in legislation, legal practice, technology and 
administrative factors.  Periodic updating is 
necessary to ensure that the workload standards 
continue to accurately represent judicial officer 
workload.  As such, OCA and the district courts 
should: 

)  Establish a standing committee that meets 
after each legislative session to review the 
impact of new legislation or other contextual 
factors on judicial officer workload standards.  
The present study considerably enhances the 
potential for keeping the workload standards 
current.  Through a regular review process, 
targeted adjustments can be made to the 
workload standards at the case level to respond 
to new court rules, legislative mandates, and 
improved case processing strategies. 
   
b)  Conduct a systematic update of the 
workload standards approximately every five 
years.  This process should be undertaken 
under the auspices of an advisory board similar 
to JNAC.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
