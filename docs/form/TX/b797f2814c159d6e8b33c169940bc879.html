property. 

4.  Links should be full forward links that pass the client browser directly to the targeted website. 
5.  Links that create a downloading burden on a state agency’s server(s), such as certain graphics or 
tables, constitute a misuse of state resources. To prevent that, entities or individuals should 
contact the appropriate state agency to request permission to post a copy of the state agency’s 
graphics or tables within their website. 

6.  Entities or individuals that link to a state agency’s website should use reasonable efforts to 

ensure that persons with disabilities may access their websites.

provide information and services that benefit Texas citizens, Texas local government, and Texas

business goals and missions of state agencies may be considered if there is a public purpose for

viewpoint, accuracy, opinions, policies, products, services, or accessibility of the site. 
5.  A state agency that provides links to a third-party website should publish a disclaimer that 

specifically disclaims liability and responsibility for third-party website content. 

6.  A state agency must either 

a.  post a link to this State Website Linking and Privacy Policy from the web page that 

contains their state agency’s linking notice, or

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
