1. WHAT IS THE 16.22 REPORT?

Article  16.22   of  the  Texas  Code  of  Criminal 
Article  16.22
Procedure  prescribes  the  procedures  for  early 
identification of  individuals  suspected  of  having  
a  mental  illness  or  intellectual  disability who  
are  involved  in  the  criminal  justice  system. 
The law  requires magistrates  to  order  a 16.22 
interview and report regarding the individual if 
the magistrate has reasonable cause to believe 
the individual has a mental illness or is a person 
with  an  intellectual  disability.  The  report  is 
created  from  the  interview  process  and  
includes  information  about  whether  the 
individual has a mental illness or is a person 
with an  intellectual disability, whether there 
is  evidence  to  support  a  belief  that  the  individual  may  
be  incompetent,  and  recommended  treatment  options. 
Magistrates  are  required  to  give  notice  of  the  report  to 
several parties to ensure early identification and treatment.

2. WHY SHOULD EVERY COUNTY PROVIDE 16.22 ORDERS, REPORTS, AND 
NOTICE?

It can save lives. It helps the professionals involved do their jobs well. And it’s the law.

Immediately, the 16.22 Report:

•  Allows  Magistrate  Judges  to  make  well-informed  bond  decisions  and  helps  connect  defendants  to 

treatment before a defendant decompensates or possibly becomes incompetent;

•  Notifies Sheriffs that this defendant may need special care;
•  Helps Pretrial Service Departments create better connections to services and provides notice that, if 

released, the defendant may need to be included on a specialized mental health caseload;

•  Assists Defense Attorneys in building the appropriate defense for the defendant and, if requested by 

the client, assists the defense in advocating for appropriate treatment or services;

•  Provides Prosecutors notice that specialized pretrial bond conditions might be necessary, justice might 
look different in this case than in other cases, and that there maybe Brady material in this defendant’s 
records; and

•  Gives  Trial  Judges  the  notice  that  to  effectively  administer  justice,  the  case  may  involve  extra 

complexities, resources, and community supports.

Long-term, the 16.22 Process:

Saves counties time and money;

• 
•  Prevents suicides;
•  Protects constitutional rights;
•  Protects the community; and
•  Prevents people from reentering  the  system  repeatedly,  stopping  the  revolving door in exchange 

for appropriate treatment and services.

4

With timely and appropriate services and support, most mental illnesses are treatable, and recovery is possible, 
thereby reducing   the   likelihood   of   behavior   that   may   lead   to incarceration. However, many responses 
to mental illness that rely on jails and prisons tend to block treatment and services that may lead to recovery 
and prevent crime.

Incarceration of persons with mental illness has been a growing problem for several years and  shows  no  
signs  of  abating.  A  2002  report1  warned  of  the  growing  population shift  of persons with mental illness 
from psychiatric hospitals to prisons. Twenty years later, that trend continues to grow.

•  Prisoners with mental illness are more likely to be placed in solitary confinement and commit suicide.2
The cost of psychiatric services spent in correctional environments, combined with the  increased   rate   
• 
of  recidivism  for those with mental illness who are not appropriately supported means that these 
societal, fiscal, and human expenditures must be made again and again with no measurable benefit.

If  we  are  to  be  successful  in  reducing  our  reliance  on  our  already  overcrowded  jails  and prisons, we 
need Sheriffs and Jailers, Magistrates, Prosecutors, Defense Attorneys, Pretrial Services, Clerks, and Trial Court 
Judges and staff to address the needs of individuals with mental  illness  prior  to  their  involvement  with  the  
criminal  justice  system  or  as  early  as possible. Doing so allows us to:

• 

Expedite  the  time it  takes  to  reach  a disposition in cases  where  mental  illness  has been identified 
as a factor in the alleged crime.

•  Work  effectively  with  defendants  who  have  been  identified  as  having  a  serious mental  illness  and  

link  defendants  to  community  resources.  Case  management review teams can help.

•  Use the 16.22 report, or full assessment if needed, to determine appropriateness for diversion decisions, 
such as CCP art. 17.032 Mental Health bonds, pretrial services, and pre- or post-plea diversion programs, 
or mental health courts.

•  Use  the  16.22  report, or  full  assessment if appropriate, to identify an individual’s needs for services 
and provide the best placement and treatment plan for providing support, services, and stability.

3. TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF ART. 16.22

1. 

2. 

Include  the  16.22  Order  (and  Report,  if  available)  with  the  notice  of  order  of appointment to the 
defense attorneys.
Incorporate  recommendations  from  the  16.22  Report  into  the  bond  conditions, particularly  if  the  
defendant  is  being  released  on  a  mental  health  personal  bond under art. 17.032. 

a.  Note: With notice and a hearing, the trial court can modify the defendant’s bond  conditions  to 
include  the  16.22  recommendations,  even  after  general conditions are set—consider this idea 
especially when the magistrate setting the conditions of bond did not yet have access to the 16.22 
report.

b.   See an example of 17.032 Mental Health Personal Bond conditions on page 29.

4. THE 16.22 PROCESS STEP-BY-STEP

STEP 1: ARRIVAL AT JAIL

• 

The defendant is arrested for Class B misdemeanor or higher and is brought to jail.

STEP 2: IDENTIFICATION OF INDIVIDUAL SUSPECTED OF MENTAL ILLNESS

Initial identification can come from any source of credible information, which may include:

• 

Information from:
 » Texas Commission on Jail Standards (TCJS) Jail Screening Form – mandatory for all jail intake 

(see page 20)

 » TLETS CCQ (Texas Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, Continuity of Care Query)
 » Witnesses / Witness Statements / Probable Cause Affidavit
 » Staff  familiar  with  the  individual  from  the  Local  Mental  Health  Authority  (LMHA),  Local 

Intellectual or Developmental Disability Authority (LIDDA), or other care providers

 » Defendant’s family members or friends
 » Medication brought into the jail with or for the defendant

•  Observations of:

 » Law Enforcement
 » Jail Staff*
 » Magistrate Judge

*Magistrate  Judge  must  be  notified  of  any  credible  information  within  12  hours  of  the  discovery  of  that 
information by jail staff.

STEP 3: MAGISTRATE MAKES REASONABLE CAUSE DETERMINATION

1.  Magistrate should:

•  Review the notification of credible information and any supporting documents
•  Review the defendant’s charges and criminal history
•  Meet with the defendant
•  Communicate with the LMHA/LIDDA/LBHA/Mental Health Service Provider

2.  Magistrate  then  decides  whether  there  is  reasonable  cause  to  believe  the  defendant  has  a  mental 

illness or IDD.

STEP 4: IF REASONABLE CAUSE IS FOUND

If  reasonable  cause  is  found  that  an  individual  has  a  mental  illness  or  IDD,  then  the  magistrate 
shall order a qualified mental health professional to interview the individual and complete a 16.22 
report.

STEP 4B: EXCEPTIONS TO ORDERING THE INTERVIEW AND REPORT

If the defendant had a 16.22 interview and report done within the year prior to the arrest date, then 
Magistrate may, but does not have to, elect to use the previous report instead of ordering a new 
one.
If the defendant is no longer in custody, then Magistrate may choose whether to order a 16.22 
Interview and Report.

• 

• 

• 

6

STEP 5: MAGISTRATE REVIEWS THE 16.22 REPORT

•  Magistrate  Receives  Report:  For  a  newly  ordered  report,  the  interview  and  report  must  be 
completed and received by the Magistrate within 96 hours of the order (or 30 days of the order if 
the defendant is out of custody).
The Magistrate must review the 16.22 report.
 » The Report must contain:

• 

1.  A description of the procedures used in the interview and collection of information; and
2.  Expert’s observations pertaining to:

a.  Whether the defendant has MI or IDD;
b.  Whether the defendant may be incompetent; and
c.  Any appropriate or recommended treatment or service.

STEP 6: DISTRIBUTION OF THE 16.22 REPORT

Whether the Magistrate elects to use a previous report or a new report,

• 

• 

The Magistrate must send a copy of the 16.22 report to the following stakeholders:
 » Trial Court
 » Prosecutor’s Office (County or District Attorney’s Offices, or both)
 » Defense Counsel
 » Sheriff (or other person that is responsible for the defendant’s medical records while they are 

in custody)

 » Personal Bond Office/ Director of Pretrial Supervision Office.
The Magistrate should send a copy of the report to:
 » The County or District Clerk for inclusion in the case file and recording; the clerk then uses the 

reports to report to the Office of Court Administration (OCA).

STEP 7: TRIAL COURT USES & CONSIDERATIONS OF 16.22 REPORT

The Court can use the results of the 16.22 report for a variety of purposes, including:

•  Considering a mental health personal bond pursuant to CCP art. 17.032. CCP art. 16.22(c)(1).

 » Note that MH personal bond is required in certain circumstances under CCP art. 17.032(b) unless 

good cause shown otherwise.

•  Resuming or initiating competency proceedings under CCP art. 46B. CCP art. 16.22(c)(2).
•  Consideration  of  16.22  report  during  penalty  phase  as  a  part  of  the  pre-sentence  investigation 
report, or in imposition of conditions of a community supervision program. CCP art. 16.22(c)(3).

•  Referring the defendant to a specialty court or docket. CCP 16.22(c)(4).
•  Release on bail and transfer of individual to a civil court for court-ordered outpatient mental health 

services (regardless of competency status) CCP art. 16.22(c)(5).

•  Appointment of defense counsel. CCP art. 26.04.
• 

Specifically tailored bond conditions. (See page 29) CCP art. 17.032.

Post-adjudication:  If  an  individual  is  remanded  to  the  custody  of TDCJ  then  the  16.22  report  must  be 
included  in  the  individual’s  pen  packet.  Any  other  mental  health  records,  screening  reports,  or  similar 
information must also be included.

See JCMH Flow Chart showing CCP art. 16.22(c)(1-5) on page 33.

COLLECTION OF 16.22 DATA BY OCA
To comply with a legislative mandate to record the number of written 16.22 reports, the magistrate 
should send the report to the clerk of the trial court for filing within the case file. The clerk should 
count this report in their mandatory Judicial Counsel’s Monthly Court Activity Report through OCA.  
See Tex. Admin Code 171.2.

Collection of this data is mandatory and essential to the accurate assessment of the capacity of jails, 
magistrate courts, and trial courts to ensure required identification and treatment of individuals with 
mental illness or IDD. See page 15 showing OCA reporting requirements. 

OTHER CLERK CONSIDERATIONS & REQUIREMENTS

•  Upon  receipt  of  a  16.22  report  from  a  magistrate, 
the  clerk  of  the  trial  court  (county  or  district  clerk) 
should file the report within the individual’s case file 
(as soon as a file exists in the system).
 » Note: Some jurisdictions include a 16.22 Report 
in the individual’s file, rather than the case file, so 
that it is maintained with the person, not a case 
that  can  be  overlooked  in  the  event  of  future 
cases.

• 

The  clerk  should  ensure  that  the  16.22  report 
remains  sealed  and  made  available  only  to  parties 
to  the  individual’s  case  and  with  sufficient  judicial 
order.  Per  statute,  these  parties  include  the  Trial 
Court, Prosecutor, Defense Counsel, Sheriff or holder 
of  medical  records  while  defendant  is  in  custody, 
and the Personal Bond Office or Pretrial Supervision 
Office.

•  A written 16.22 report should never be made part of 

the public record.

5. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

CONFIDENTIALITY 

Question:

Is the 16.22 ORDER placed into the public record or made available to the public?

Answer:

The 16.22 order is not considered exempt from public disclosure and may be filed in the public 
case file.

Question:

Is the 16.22 REPORT placed into the public record or made available to the public?

Answer:

No. The 16.22 report is strictly confidential and should remain out of the public record. It can be 
filed in the case file, so long as it is sealed and made available only to parties to the individual’s 
case and with sufficient judicial order. Per statute, these parties include the Trial Court, Prosecutor, 
Defense Counsel, Sheriff/holder of medical records while defendant is in custody, and the Personal 
Bond Office/Director of Pretrial Supervision.

Question:

As a judge/attorney/LMHA/pretrial bond office/jail, can I release the 16.22 report to another 
judge/attorney/LMHA/pretrial bond office/jail in a different county where the defendant 
has been arrested?

Answer:

If the asking entity is requesting the report for the purposes of continuity of care of the defendant, 
then YES. Not only can you release the report, you MUST release the report. State law requires 
that specifically listed agencies share information (accept and disclose information) for purposes 
of continuity of care and services for special needs offenders. Texas Health and Safety Code 
§ 614.017.

What is considered an agency? See Texas Health and Safety Code § 614.017(c)(1) for the complete 
list of agencies. The agencies most likely to deal with this provision regarding 16.22 include:

• 
• 
• 

Jails regulated by the Commission on Jail Standards;
a Judge of this state with jurisdiction over juvenile or criminal cases;
an  Attorney  who  is  appointed  or  retained  to  represent  a  special  needs  offender  or  a 
juvenile with a mental impairment;

•  Personal bond & pretrial release offices;
•  CSCDs - Community Supervision and Corrections Depts.;
• 
JPDs - Juvenile Probation Depts.;
•  TJJD - Texas Juvenile Justice Dept.;
•  HHSC - Health and Human Services Commission (this includes the LMHA);

What do I have to do? Specifically, an agency SHALL:

•  accept  information  relating  to  a  special  needs  offender  or  a  juvenile  with  a  mental 
impairment that is sent to the agency to serve the purposes of continuity of care and 
services regardless of whether other state law makes that information confidential; AND
•  disclose  information  relating  to  a  special  needs  offender  or  a  juvenile  with  a  mental 
impairment,  including  information  about  the  offender’s  or  juvenile’s  identity;  needs; 
treatment;  social,  criminal,  and  vocational  history;  supervision  status  and  compliance 
with conditions of supervision; and medical and mental health history, if the disclosure 
serves the purposes of continuity of care and services.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 614.017(a).

Who  is  considered  a  Special  Needs  Offender?  A  person  with  mental  impairments,  physical 
disabilities,  terminal  illnesses,  or  other  significant  illnesses,  or  who  are  elderly. This  applies  to 
individuals for whom criminal charges are pending or, are in custody or any form of supervision 
after an adjudication.

DESIGNATED RESPONSIBILITIES 

Question:

Who  is  responsible  for  notifying  the  Judge/Magistrate  of  individuals  with  a  suspected 
mental illness or IDD?

Answer:

The Sheriff or Municipal Jailers who have custody of the defendant have a duty under CCP art. 
16.22(a)(1) to notify the magistrate within 12 hours of receiving credible information that may 
establish reasonable cause to believe that the defendant has MI or IDD. However, this responsibility 
does not fall on one specific individual. Identification and notification of individuals suspected 
to have a mental illness or IDD is the responsibility of law enforcement, jail staff, mental health 
workers, court staff and/or any other involved party. Additionally, any person who notices credible 
information of MI or IDD should report it to the magistrate. The magistrate may also make these 
observations on their own.

Question:

What if the criminal case isn’t filed yet, where do the completed 16.22 Order and Report go?

Answer:

Different jurisdictions handle this situation differently. In some jurisdictions, the magistrate will 
retain the order and report until the criminal case has a file in the clerk’s office. In other jurisdictions, 
the  trial  court  (or  their  coordinator)  holds  on  to  these  documents  until  the  filing  in  the  clerk’s 
office. Lastly, in some jurisdictions, the county or district clerk will hold the order and report, or 
file the documents into their electronic filing system under the defendant’s name, and potentially 
their jail booking, until the time when it can also be attached to the criminal case filing.

16.22 ORDER

Answer:

Question:

Is  a  16.22  evaluation  required  if  the  judge/magistrate  is  notified  of  an  individual  who  is 
suspected of having a mental illness or IDD?

Not necessarily. Upon receiving notification of credible information, the magistrate must then use 
that information (along with other information, as specified in step 3, on page 6) to determine 
whether they have reasonable cause to believe that the defendant is a person who has MI or IDD. 
Upon a positive determination of reasonable cause to believe the defendant has MI or is a person 
with IDD, then a judge/magistrate must order a 16.22 evaluation and report. Note, there are two 
exceptions to this mandate: 1) If the defendant is no longer in custody, the magistrate may, but 
is not required to, order a 16.22 interview; and 2) If the defendant had a previous 16.22 interview 
and report conducted within the past year and was determined to have MI or IDD, the magistrate 
may choose to rely on that report instead of ordering a new one. CCP art. 16.22(a)(2).

Question:

Can a magistrate make his or her own determination that a 16.22 interview is needed?

Answer:

Yes, a magistrate may make his or her own determination—no reasonable cause from the jailer 
is necessary. The determination of reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant has MI or is a 
person with IDD can arise from a jailer’s notification or from the magistrate’s own observations. 
These observations may include the magistrate’s interactions with the defendant, review of the 
criminal history or  probable cause  affidavit, or communicating with the  mental  health service 
provider.

Question:

Under  art.  16.22(a)(2),  ordering  the  interview  is  not  required  after  release  from  jail,  but 
does a magistrate have discretion to still order one after a defendant is released from jail?

Yes. If an individual is released from custody, ordering a 16.22 interview becomes discretionary 
for the judge. Note that the defendant being out of custody changes the timeline to 30 days for 
the service provider’s return of the report.

Answer:

10

Question:

Is there a specific form that needs to be used to order the service provider to conduct the 
interview?

Answer:

No. There  is  not  a  mandated  order  that  must  be  used  for  the  magistrate  to  order  the  service 
provider to conduct the interview. However, a sample form is available on page 21 of this book, 
or on the JCMH’s online forms bank.

Question:

What if the magistrate doesn’t know which service provider contracts with the jail?

Answer:

Ask the LMHA for your region. The service provider who conducts the interviews might be the 
LMHA, but it also might be another mental health provider in the area. You might also ask other 
judges, the court coordinators, or the commissioners court who must approve the contract. There 
may also be a jail liaison in your community that works within the LMHA, the jail system, and 
the court system. Sometimes, the courts also have a coordinator specifically assigned to handle 
questions and logistics pertaining to mental health cases within the community. 

Question:

If  a  defendant  was  just  brought  into  my  jail,  how  can  I  tell  whether  they  had  a  previous 
16.22 order/interview/report completed in the last year in a different county?

Answer:

This situation gets complicated, as there is no statewide collection of this information. 

The TLETS/CCQ data exchange does not indicate if a 16.22 assessment has been completed locally 
or in another county over; it will only indicate a “yes” if the defendant’s name matches that of the 
name  in  the  LMHA’s  system.  In  some  cases,  the  LMHA  or  local  mental  health  service  provider 
will know if a 16.22 assessment has been completed, assuming, they were the organization to 
complete the assessment. In all cases, a jail administrator in the previous jail(s) will know if a 16.22 
assessment has been completed in their jail, as this should be in the defendant’s hard/electronic 
file. 

If the judge desires this information, it seems most feasible that the judge/court administrator 
will need to first figure out where the individual has been in custody in the past year. This may 
involve  investigation  into  the  defendant’s  background  through  TCIC  or  asking  the  defendant 
about which jails they have been in recently. The judge/court administrator can consult with a 
staff person at other jails or someone in the magistrate and clerk’s offices in the other counties to 
determine if an assessment had been completed.

It  may  be  appropriate  to  consult  with  the  LMHA  in  those  jurisdictions  where  the  LMHA  is  the 
contracted provider of MH services and/or has staff housed in the jail and are thus, likely intimately 
involved in conducting these assessments and maintenance of records. Because this information 
is being used for the purpose of the defendant’s continuity of care, this information should be 
exchanged. If a 16.22 report was completed, you (as the judge, jail, service provider, attorney, etc.) 
are entitled to a copy of it under Health and Safety Code § 614.017. Refer to page 9 in this report 
for more information on this law. 

Practically,  it  may  be  easier  to  order  a  16.22  report  in  the  new  county  rather  than  waiting  for 
communication between multiple organizations.

16.22 INTERVIEW

Question:

The service provider will not come to the detention center to conduct the interview of the 
defendant until a personal bond is placed on the Defendant. If that is the case, under what 
authority do we hold the defendant?

Answer:

CCP  art.  16.22(a-4)  allows  for  the  service  provider  to  conduct  in-person  interviews  in  the  jail, 
but  also  by  telephone,  or  through  a  telemedicine  medical  service  or  telehealth  service. These 
additional options might be one way for the LMHA to conduct the interview without entering the 
jail facility.

If they are waiting on a personal bond before conducting the interview, there is a possibility that 
the jail might hold the bond until the interview is complete, or that a release plan can be created 
with  the  MH  Service  Provider/Attorney/Jail/Judges  where  these  items  each  occur  in  a  certain 
order and the defendant is released from jail promptly upon completion of the interview.

The magistrate also has the authority to order that the defendant submit to an interview in jail 
or  another  place  for  up  to  72  hours—although  this  provision  is  reserved  for  times  when  the 
defendant fails or refuses to submit to an interview under CCP art. 16.22(a)(4).

Question:

Is there a specific form that the service provider needs to use to conduct the 16.22 interview?

Answer:

Yes. Per 16.22(a)(1)(B), the form is approved by the Texas Correctional Office on Offenders with 
Medical  or  Mental  Impairments  (TCOOMMI)  under  Health  and  Safety  Code  §  614.0032(c). This 
form is available on page 23, on TCOOMMI’s website, and in the JCMH forms bank. ***Note that 
the service provider may add more information than that which is contained in the approved form but 
may not exclude information.

12

Question:

What do you do when the service provider continually refuses to do the 16.22 interview or 
report or even go into the jail?

Answer:

First, find out which organization is supposed to be conducting the 16.22 interviews—it could 
be the LMHA or it could be another entity that has the contract with the county. Communicate 
this problem first to leadership at the local mental health authority. If there are further questions, 
HHSC might be able to help.

The Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) contracts with 39 LMHAs that provide mental 
health services in every county in Texas.3 LMHAs are required by HHSC to provide mental health 
crisis response services if requested by a jail in the LMHA’s specific geographic area for inmates 
who are experiencing a mental health crisis.4

Mental health crisis response services include:

•  A crisis screening;
•  A crisis assessment; and
•  A recommendation about the level of care required to resolve the crisis situation.

In addition to mental health crisis response services, LMHAs are required to provide written reports 
with information about defendants suspected of having a mental illness or intellectual disability 
if ordered by the judiciary, i.e., 16.22 interviews and reports.

Jails do not pay for mental health crisis response services. HHSC provides funding to LMHAs for 
the purpose of providing mental health crisis response services, as specified above.  However, jails 
may purchase additional services through contracts or memorandums of understanding with the 
LMHA in their jurisdiction. 

Some jails currently contract with the LMHA in their area and pay for additional services, while jails 
without a contract with the LMHA in their area receive mental health crisis response services only 
and can receive other services through contracts with a provider outside of the LMHA. As a result 
of this local decision making, there is variation in the level of services jails receive from LMHAs. 

If the entity contracted to provide the 16.22 service is not the LMHA, your local jurisdiction may 
need to find a new service provider with whom to contract your mental health services—at least 
until the issues are sorted out through the county, HHSC, and the LMHA.

All LMHAs have been advised by HHSC that if ordered by the judiciary, they need to conduct the 
16.22 interview and report. According to art. 16.22(a-1), LMHAs will be reimbursed by the county. 

As far as not coming to the jail, remember that the service providers may conduct the interview 
by telephone, or through a telemedicine medical service or telehealth service. These additional 
options might be one way to conduct the interview without entering the jail facility.

16.22 REPORT

Question:

We receive a report that finds a mental illness and then includes a risk assessment re: suicidal 
ideation. Should we be receiving a more thorough report?

Answer:

By statute, the 16.22 Report must contain:
1.  A description of the procedures used in the interview and collection of information; and
2.  Expert’s observations pertaining to:

a.  Whether the defendant has MI or IDD;
b.  Whether the defendant may be incompetent; and
c.  Any appropriate or recommended treatment or service.

If you are not receiving the required items in your report, this is an issue. Make sure you or your 
office has formed a relationship with the individual providers who come into your jails, they may 
have overlooked these requirements. Occasionally, providers feel uncomfortable recommending 
appropriate  treatments  or  services  to  a  judge,  even  though  this  is  statutorily  required.  If  the 
problem goes beyond this issue, then communication with your local judges, local mental health 
authority higher level managers, HHSC, and possibly commissioners court may be required. You 
can also reach out to JCMH for technical assistance with these concerns.

Question:

Who must receive a copy of the 16.22 report?

Answer:

Under  CCP  art.  16.22(b-1),  the  magistrate  is  responsible  for  providing  copies  of  the  written 
report to the defense counsel; the prosecutor; the trial court; the sheriff, or other individual that 
is responsible for the defendant’s medical records while they are in jail; and the personal bond 
office or director of pretrial supervision. It is additionally recommended, although not codified 
in statute, that the magistrate provide a copy of the report to the county or district clerk’s office 
(the clerk of the trial court) so that it may be included in the case file and properly reported to the 
Office of Court Administration.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
