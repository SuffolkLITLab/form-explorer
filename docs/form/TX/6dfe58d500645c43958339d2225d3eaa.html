      <pre>In 2004, the Appellate Section of the State Bar of Texas and the Courts of Appeals  worked together 
to identify key information needed by appellate attorneys and pro se litigants to practice effectively 
before the court.  To assist the court in this effort, the Appellate Section collected and formatted 
the  relevant  information  and  published  it  in  the  Appellate  Advocate  in  February  2005.    This 
information was updated in January, 2023 and the court intends to keep the information current 
for the use of persons with matters before the court.

SPECIAL NOTES

rulings on motions on a 
daily basis.  Motions 
seeking emergency relief 
should be served on other 
parties in a timely manner 
by expedited means. 

THE INS AND OUTS 

PROCEDURE 

Motions 

WHAT AND 
HOW TO FILE 
If a motion is 
not e-filed, 
file one 
original with 
the clerk. 

Briefs 

If a brief is not 
e-filed, file
one original
with the clerk.

HOW HANDLED 
Motions filed before 
the appeal is assigned 
to a justice are 
submitted for 
recommendation to the 
“motions justice.”  
Each justice serves as 
“motions justice” on a 
monthly rotating basis.  
The motions justice’s 
recommendation is then 
submitted to his or her 
current panel for ruling. 
Motions filed after the 
appeal is assigned to a 
justice are submitted to 
the assigned justice for 
recommendation, and 
then to his or her 
current panel.  Motions 
are generally decided 
by a full panel of three 
justices.    

COURT'S PARTICULAR 
PRACTICES 

Agreed motions, uncontested 
motions, and emergency motions 
will be acted on as soon as 
practicable, whereas contested 
motions are typically held for ten 
days prior to ruling.  As a general 
rule, first motions for extension of 
time of thirty days or less to file a 
brief are routinely granted and 
may be handled by the clerk’s 
office.  Other and subsequent 
motions for extension of time to 
file a brief are submitted to the 
court.  All motions for extension 
of time must include a reasonable 
explanation regarding why 
additional time is needed.   

The court follows the Texas 
Rules of Appellate Procedure 
regarding the filing deadlines and 
requirements for briefs.  If a brief 
cannot be filed within the dates 
prescribed by the appellate rules, 
a motion for extension of time to 
file the brief is required.

WHAT AND 
HOW TO FILE 

PROCEDURE 
Case 
Assignment 

Oral 
Argument 

A request for 
oral argument 
must be noted 
on the front 
cover of the 
party’s brief. 

Voting 

Opinions 

Motions for 
Rehearing 

If the motion 
is not e-filed, 
file one 
original with 
the clerk. 

COURT'S PARTICULAR 
PRACTICES 
The court sits in two panels.  The 
panels are assigned randomly and 
change on a quarterly basis.  The 
chief justice presides over panel 
“A,” and the most senior justice 
serving on panel “B” presides 
over that panel. 

The court favors oral argument 
and grants it in accordance with 
the guidelines specified in the 
appellate rules.  By statute, the 
court hears oral argument on 
cases originating in Nueces 
County in its Corpus Christi 
courtroom and hears oral 
argument on cases originating in 
Hidalgo, Cameron, and Willacy 
counties in its Edinburg 
courtroom.  The court also 
routinely travels to other appellate 
courts to hear oral argument on 
transfer cases. 

Voting occurs after a draft 
opinion has been circulated in 
cases that have been submitted at 
oral argument or on the briefs.     
The court regularly hands down 
its opinions on Thursdays; 
however, opinions on original 
proceedings or emergency 
matters may be handed down 
daily.   

HOW HANDLED 
As a general rule, cases 
are assigned randomly 
on a rotating basis to 
each justice; however, 
related cases may be 
assigned to the same 
justice in the interests 
of judicial economy 
and efficiency.   
When oral argument is 
granted, the court 
allows each side 20 
minutes per argument, 
and the appellant may 
reserve time from that 
allotment for rebuttal.  
Requests to modify the 
time permitted for 
argument should be 
made by written motion 
well in advance of the 
date for argument.  The 
court may grant 
additional time for oral 
argument in 
consolidated cases, 
cases with multiple 
parties, or in multiple 
appeals generated from 
the same underlying 
proceeding. 

The court utilizes 
internal administrative 
rules that include 
deadlines for drafting 
and circulating 
opinions.  These rules 
are not publicly 
available.   
Motions for rehearing 
and for en banc 
reconsideration are 
initially circulated to 
the assigned justice for 
a recommendation, 
then to the remainder of 
the panel or court for 
ruling.   

SPECIAL NOTES 

Typically, cases are 
assigned to a specific 
justice when they become 
“at issue,” that is, when the 
appellant’s brief is filed. 

The panel justices may 
meet to discuss cases heard 
at oral argument 
immediately before or after 
submission. 

Draft opinions typically 
proceed through a two or 
three-part circulation 
process which may 
comprise circulation to all 
panel attorneys, the chief 
staff attorney, and the 
panel justices. 
Because en banc 
reconsideration is not 
favored in the appellate 
rules, the court grants it 
sparingly in accordance 
with the guidelines 
provided in the rules.

PROCEDURE 
Original 
Proceedings 

WHAT AND 
HOW TO FILE 
If a petition is 
not e-filed, 
file one 
original with 
the clerk. 

HOW HANDLED 
Original proceedings 
are assigned on a 
rotating basis to a 
justice and that 
justice’s current panel. 

COURT'S PARTICULAR 
PRACTICES 

Original proceedings are 
generally given expedited 
consideration; however, motions 
for emergency relief will be given 
immediate attention.  The court 
typically allows ten days for the 
real party to file a response to an 
original proceeding.   

SPECIAL NOTES 

The court does not grant 
motions for temporary 
relief when the original 
proceeding itself has not 
yet been filed. 

1. The court utilizes Westlaw.
2. The court prefers that parties follow The Bluebook:  A Uniform System of Citation and The Greenbook:  Texas 

3. The court prefers that parties provide copies of legislative history, municipal ordinances, or other materials that 
may be difficult or onerous to locate.  Do not include copies of statutes, rules, or cases unless they are required 
by the appellate rules or are key to your appellate arguments.

4. The court distributes its orders and opinions through e-noticing, electronically on its website, and through its case 

5. The court records oral argument digitally (typically audio only).  The parties can obtain a copy of the argument; 

however, the court does not guarantee the quality of its recordings.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
