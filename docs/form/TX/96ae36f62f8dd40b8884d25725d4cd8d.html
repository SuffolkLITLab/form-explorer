      <pre>Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 

Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 

PECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge Stephen B. Ables, Chair; Judge Ray Wheless; Judge Ana 
Estevez; Judge Alfonso Charles; Judge Susan Brown  

Petitioner  submitted  to  Respondent  a  records  request  for  information  regarding  certain 
persons and companies engaged in civil process service. Respondent redacted the email addresses 
of certified process servers found in the responsive documents and then disclosed the documents 
to  Petitioner.  Petitioner  submitted  a  follow-up  request  to  Respondent  for  the  redacted  email 
addresses and Respondent replied that only personal email addresses were redacted, that it did not 
have  the  information Petitioner  sought,  and  that  all  available  information  had  been  provided  to 
Petitioner. In a follow-up message, Petitioner asked for the legal grounds Respondent relied on to 
withhold the email addresses. In a series of replies, Respondent referred to Rule 12.3(b) (Rule 12 
inapplicable), Rule 12.5(d) (“home address and family information” exemption to disclosure), and 
Rule 12.5(i) (“information confidential under other law” exemption to disclosure) to justify the 
withholding.  Petitioner  then  timely  filed  this  petition  for  review.  Respondent  has  provided  the 
records at issue in this appeal to the special committee for its in camera review. 

ule 12 governs requests to inspect or copy “judicial records” of a “judicial agency.” In 
Rule 12 Decision No. 15-009, we concluded that Respondent, the Judicial Branch Certification 
Commission  (Commission),  is  a  judicial  agency  for  purposes  of  Rule  12  and  that  access  to  its 
records is governed by Rule 12. In that decision, we wrote that the “purpose of the Commission is 
to oversee the registration, licensing and certification of court professions” and that “[i]n this role 
the Commission serves a basic administrative function for all the courts of Texas.” In his appeal, 
Petitioner  appears  to  disagree  with  this  conclusion  and  asks  us  to  deem  Respondent  a 
“governmental body” under Government Code Chapter 552 (commonly referred to as the “Public 
Information Act” or “PIA”) and conclude that Respondent’s regulatory function is in fact subject 
to the PIA and that its regulatory records fall under that disclosure regime. We disagree with this 
analysis. “Governmental bodies” subject to the PIA do not include the judiciary. Government Code 
§552.003(1)(B).  Respondent  is  a  judicial  branch  agency.  That  it  has  a  combination  of 
administrative, adjudicative, and regulatory functions does not alter its status as a judicial branch 
agency. Thus, it cannot be subject to the PIA. 

hough Respondent does not dispute it is a judicial agency subject to Rule 12, in its reply 
to the petition in this appeal it asserts that the records at issue are not subject to Rule 12 for the 
following reasons:  

)  the  email  messages  were  sent  as  part  of  Respondent’s  compliance  function  by 
Respondent’s  investigators  to  some  of  its  licensees  and,  therefore,  they  relate  to the 
Respondent’s  investigative  and  adjudicative  functions  and  are  not  “judicial  records” 
that are subject to Rule 12; and

2)  Sec.  552.137  of  the  Government  Code  makes  confidential  an  email  address  of  a 
member  of  the  public  provided  to  a  governmental  body  for  the  purpose  of 
communicating electronically with the governmental body and, therefore, Rule 12.3(b), 
which makes Rule 12 inapplicable to records or information to which Chapter 552 of 
the Government Code is made inapplicable by certain statute, rule, or other provision 
of law, makes Rule 12 inapplicable to the email addresses at issue.  

We  first  address  whether  the  records  are  judicial  records  under  Rule  12.  Rule  12.2(d) 
defines a “judicial record” as a “record made or maintained by or for a court or judicial agency in 
its regular course business but not pertaining to its adjudicative function, regardless of whether 
that function relates to a specific case.” In Rule 12 Decision No. 15-009 we concluded that the 
Commission “exercises an adjudicative function when it investigates and resolves complaints filed 
with  the  Commission”  and  “that  the  records  maintained  by  the  Commission  related  to  these 
complaints are not judicial records subject to Rule 12.”  We have reviewed the records at issue in 
this  appeal  and  find  that  several  of  them  are  related  to  complaints  from  the  public  and  courts 
regarding its licensees and, therefore, they are not subject to Rule 12.  
 

Next, we address Respondent’s assertion that Rule 12.3(b) makes Rule 12 inapplicable to 
the email addresses. Rule 12.3(b) makes Rule 12 inapplicable to records or information to which 
Chapter  552  of  the  Government  Code  is  made  inapplicable  by  certain  statute,  rule,  or  other 
provision  of  law.  Specifically,  Respondent  pointed  to  Government  Code  Sec.  552.137,  which 
makes confidential an email address of a member of the public provided to a governmental body 
for the purpose of communicating electronically with the governmental body. We disagree with 
this assertion.  Sec. 552.137 does not make Chapter 552 “inapplicable” to email addresses of the 
public maintained by “governmental bodies” subject to the PIA; it makes them confidential and 
the reason it applies to those records is because they are subject to the PIA.  

astly, Respondent asserts in its reply to the petition that in the event we were to conclude 
that the records at issue are subject to Rule 12, they would be exempt from disclosure under Rule 
12.5(d), (i), and (k). All the records at issue in this appeal appear to be related to or stem from the 
Respondent’s investigation of its licensees for the purpose of monitoring their compliance with 
Respondent’s rules. Rule 12.5(k) exempts from disclosure “any record relating to an investigation 
of  any  person's  character  or  conduct,  unless:  (1)  the  record  is  requested  by  the  person  being 
investigated; and (2) release of the record, in the judgment of the records custodian, would not 
impair the investigation.” The emails at issue in this appeal relate to investigations conducted by 
Respondent’s investigator into the activities or conduct of Respondent’s licensees; therefore, they 
are exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5(k).   

ecause we have concluded that the records submitted for our in camera review are either 
not subject to Rule 12 or are exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5(k), we need not address the 
other exemptions raised by Respondent. 

or the reasons discussed above, the petition is denied.
