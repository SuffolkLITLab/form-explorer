FINANCING THE COURT SYSTEM 

Over  the  past  two  decades,  State  appropriations  provided  for  the 
operation of the judicial branch of the government has averaged about 
one-third of one percent of the total State budget. 

Most of the money used to operate the courts within the Texas judicial 
system  is  provided  by  the  counties  or  cities,  with  a  more  limited 
amount of funds provided by the State. 

The State provides full funding only for the operation of the Supreme 
Court,  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals,  the  Third  Court  of  Appeals 
located in Austin, and certain statewide agencies of the judicial branch. 
It provides a basic appropriation for the operation of the remaining 13 
Courts of Appeals. 

State  appropriations  provide  the  entire  salaries  of  the  justices  of  the 
Supreme Court and judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals; they also 
provide  a base salary for the justices of the courts of appeals and the 
judges of the district courts, which by statute may be supplemented by 
local governments. 

The 254 counties of the State provide funds for operation of the district 
courts,  and  provide  most  of  the  funding  for  constitutional  county 
courts,  county  courts  at  law,  and  justice  of  the  peace  courts.  In  most 
instances, the counties also provide supplemental pay to the judges of 
the  courts  of  appeals  and  district  courts  serving  their  areas.  City 
governments provide the entire funding for the operations of their own 
municipal courts.

The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Presiding Judge of the Court 
of  Criminal  Appeals,  the  Chief  Justices  of  each  of  the  14  Courts  of 
Appeals,  and  the  judges  of  each  of  the  trial  courts  are  generally 
responsible for the administration of their respective courts. 

To  aid  in  the  administration  of  justice  in  the  trial  courts,  the  State  is 
divided  into  nine  Administrative  Judicial  Regions.  The  Governor 
designates one of the active or retired district judges residing in each 
Administrative  Judicial  Region  as  the  Presiding  Judge.  The  Presiding 
Judge of an Administrative Judicial Region may temporarily assign an 
active  or  retired  judge  to  serve  on  a  district  court  or  county  court  at 
law  in  the  Administrative  Judicial  Region  whenever  the  need  arises. 
The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court convenes periodic conferences 
of  the  nine  Presiding  Judges  to  ensure  the  efficient  administration  of 
justice in the trial courts of the State. 

The Texas Judicial System 

Judicial Authority 

The  judicial  power  of  the  State  of  Texas  is  derived  from  Article  5, 
Section 1 of the Texas Constitution, which provides: 

The judicial power of this State shall be vested in one Supreme Court, in 
one Court of Criminal Appeals, in Courts of Appeals, in District Courts, in 
County Courts, in Commissioners Courts, in Courts of Justices of the Peace, 
and in such other courts as may be provided by law. 

The  Legislature  may  establish  such  other  courts  as  it  may  deem 
necessary  and  prescribe  the  jurisdiction  and  organization  thereof,  and 
may  conform  the  jurisdiction  of  the  district  and  other  inferior  courts 
thereto. 

(As amended November 4, 1980, effective September 1, 1981.) 

 

                   

20 

Code  establishes  professional  standards  which  the  State  Constitution 
makes mandatory for judges. 

In  addition,  the  Constitution  establishes  a  special  commission  to 
consider citizen complaints concerning the conduct of judges which is 
clearly  inconsistent  with  the  proper  performance  of  their  duties,  or 
which casts public discredit upon the judiciary or the administration of 
justice.  This  Commission  on  Judicial  Conduct  may  reprimand  or 
censure a judge, or recommend to a review tribunal that the judge be 
removed  from  office.  The  Commission  may  also  suspend  from  office 
judges  who  are  indicted  for  felony  offenses  or  charged  with  official 
misconduct. It does not, however, review the legal results of a trial as 
this is within the jurisdiction of the appellate courts. 

 

JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION 

The Supreme Court of Texas has general responsibility for the efficient 
administration of the Texas judicial system and the authority to make 
rules  of  administration  applicable  to  the  courts.  Aiding  the  Supreme 
Court  in  carrying  out  its  administrative  duties  is  the  state  Office  of 
Court Administration, which operates under the direction of the Chief 
Justice. 

The  Supreme  Court  and  the  Legislature  receive  recommendations  on 
long-range planning and improvements in the administration of justice 
from  the  Texas  Judicial  Council,  a  22-member  advisory  board 
composed  of  appointees  of  the  judicial,  executive,  and  legislative 
branches of government.  

The state Office of Court Administration, established in 1977, provides 
administrative  support  and  technical  assistance  to  all  of  the  courts  in 
the State. It publishes the Annual Report on the Texas Judicial System 
and  provides  the  Legislature  with  requested  information  on  the 
functioning of the judicial system. The office also supports the research 
and operations of the Judicial Committee on Information Technology, a 

INTRODUCTION TO THE TEXAS 
JUDICIAL SYSTEM 

HE TEXAS CONSTITUTION  

The basic law of the State of Texas is set out in the Constitution of the 
State of Texas, a document adopted by the voters of the State in 1876 
and  amended  by  them  many  times  since  then.  The  fundamental  legal 
rights which all residents of the State possess—such as the right to trial 
by  a  jury—are  set  out  in  the  Constitution  in  what  is  called  the  Bill  of 
Rights. 

The Constitution also contains basic principles for the operation of the 
state  government  and  legal  system.  It  separates  the  powers  of  the 
government by dividing it into three distinct branches or departments: 
legislative, executive, and judicial. 

HE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE BRANCHES 

The legislative branch includes the Texas House of Representatives and 
the Texas Senate, which together make up the Legislature. The function 
of the Legislature is to make laws, which are called  statutes. Statutes, 
written  and  passed  by  the  Legislature,  include  such things  as  the  law 
which  makes  it  illegal  to  drive  while  intoxicated  and  the  law  which 
makes the Fourth of July a state holiday. The Constitution, adopted by 
the voters themselves, is superior to the statutes passed by the elected 
members  of  the  Legislature.  For  this  reason,  if  there  is  a  conflict 
between  a  provision  of  the  Constitution  and  that  of  a  statute,  the 
statute is said to be "unconstitutional" and may not be enforced. 

The role of the executive branch is to carry out and enforce the laws of 
the State. The executive branch includes the Office of the Governor and 
most  administrative  agencies  of  the  State,  such  as  the  Department  of 
Public Safety, the Texas Education Agency, and the Department of State

Health Services. The majority of state employees work in this branch. 

THE JUDICIAL BRANCH 

The judicial branch of Texas government includes the court system of 
the  state  and  the  judicial  agencies,  such  as  the  Office  of  Court 
Administration.  Its  role  is  to  interpret  the  law  and  to  resolve  legal 
disputes. It is the smallest branch of state government. 

The  meaning  of  a  constitutional  provision  is  not  always  obvious;  the 
intent  of  a  statute  is  not  always  clear;  the  actions  of  an  executive 
agency are not always correct. The function of the courts is to resolve 
these issues, as well as to resolve disputes arising between citizens of 
the State. 

Two basic types of cases are heard in Texas courts: criminal and civil. 

TYPES OF CASES 

Criminal Cases 

Criminal  cases  are  those  in  which  someone  is  charged  in  court  with 
having violated certain laws called criminal or penal statutes. A person 
who violates one of these statutes is said to have committed a crime. In 
Texas,  an  act  is  not  a  crime  unless,  before  the  act  occurred,  the 
Legislature has passed a statute making the act unlawful. 

Serious crimes are called felonies and include such offenses as murder 
and robbery. If a person (the defendant) is found guilty of committing a 
felony,  he  or  she  may  be  sentenced  to  serve  a  number  of  years  in  a 
state  prison  operated  by  the  Texas  Department  of  Criminal  Justice.  If 
the crime is a capital offense, the defendant may be sentenced to death. 

Crimes which are not as serious as felonies are called  misdemeanors. 
These include such offenses as disorderly conduct or driving without a 
license. If a defendant is found guilty of a misdemeanor, he or she may 
be fined, may be sentenced to serve up to one year in the local jail (if 
the law allows it for the particular offense), or both. However, someone 
convicted of a misdemeanor cannot be sentenced to a state prison.

to be licensed to practice law; most are required to be county residents 
the 
and  have  experience  as  practicing  attorneys. 
constitutional county courts must be “well informed in the law of the 
State”  but  are  not  required  to  be  lawyers.  Most  of  the  254  county 
judges are not licensed to practice law. 

Judges  of 

There  are  no  constitutional  or  statutory  qualifications  to  serve  as  a 
justice  of  the  peace,  and  very  few  are  lawyers.  While  judges  of 
municipal  courts  of  record  must  be  attorneys,  no  statutory 
qualifications  are  required  of  other  municipal  judges,  most  of  whom 
are not lawyers. 

ELECTION AND TERMS 

All judges, with the exception of most municipal judges, are elected in 
partisan elections by the qualified voters of the geographical areas they 
serve. Most  municipal  judges  are  appointed  by  the governing  body of 
the municipality, although a few are elected in non-partisan elections. 

Appellate  judges  serve  six-year  terms.  District  judges,  county-level 
judges,  and  justices  of  the  peace  serve  four-year  terms.  Municipal 
judges usually serve two-year terms. 

Judicial  vacancies  in  appellate  and  district  courts  are  filled  by 
appointment  of  the  Governor.  Vacancies  in  county-level  and  justice 
courts  are  filled  by  commissioners  courts.  Vacancies  in  municipal 
courts  are  filled  by  the  mayor  or  governing  body  of  the  city  in  non-
partisan elections. 

UDICIAL CONDUCT AND DISCIPLINE 

All persons who serve as judges in this State must be knowledgeable in 
the law, and dispense justice in a fair and impartial manner. To aid in 
the  attainment  of  these  goals,  the  Legislature  has  provided  for  the 
mandatory  continuing  professional  education  of  judges,  and  the 
Supreme  Court  has  promulgated  the  Code  of  Judicial  Conduct.  The

QUALIFICATION, SELECTION AND 
DISCIPLINE OF JUDGES 

 

QUALIFICATIONS 

The  basic  qualifications  for  most  of  the  judges  in  the  state  are 
established  by  the  Constitution  of  the  State  of  Texas.  By  those 
provisions, all appellate judges must have been licensed to practice law 
for at least ten years, be citizens of the United States and of Texas, and 
be  at  least  35  years  old.  District  judges  must  have  been  licensed  to 
practice  law  in  this  state  for  at  least  four  years,  be  residents  of  the 
judicial district for at least two years, and be citizens. 

Qualifications  for  county  court  at  law  and  statutory  probate  court 
judges vary according to the statute creating the court. All are required 

17 

The Legislature establishes a range of specific penalties from which to 
punish  a  convicted  defendant.  Depending  upon  the  severity  of  the 
crime, the punishment ranges from the death penalty, incarceration for 
a specific number of years, a fine, or both imprisonment and a fine. 

A convicted defendant may be placed on community supervision in lieu 
of  serving  the  imposed  sentence  in  prison  or  jail.  Usually  a  person 
placed in this status is ordered to follow some very strict rules and to 
report regularly to a supervision officer. If the crime caused injury to an 
innocent person, the offender may be required to pay compensation to 
the victim of the crime as restitution for his actions. The offender may 
be ordered to perform certain prescribed community service activities. 

Additional  information  about  criminal  cases  is  contained  in  the 
sections  of  this  booklet  dealing  with  the  specific  types  of  courts  in 
Texas. 

Civil Cases 

Civil cases are another basic type of cases which are tried in the courts of 
Texas. Most simply stated, civil cases are cases which involve disputes 
between  two  or  more  parties  (usually  persons  or  businesses)  and 
which  are  not  criminal  in  nature,  such  as  divorce  cases  and  suits  to 
collect debts. 

More specifically, civil cases usually involve private parties where one 
party  (the  plaintiff)  brings  suit  against  another  (the  defendant)  and 
asks the court to enforce a private right or to require the defendant to 
pay for some civil wrong done to the plaintiff.

Special Types of Cases 

One  special  type  of  civil  case  is  called  a  probate  case.  These  cases 
frequently involve the distribution of the property of a person who has 
died, whether or not the deceased person has left a written will. 

Juvenile  cases,  involving  children  between  the  ages  of  10  and  17,  may 
resemble criminal cases in many ways, but are normally considered to 
be  civil  in  nature.  Without  specific  authorization  by  the  court  in  a 
special  hearing,  a  child  under  17  may  not  be  tried  for  a  crime  as  an 
adult.  Except  in  the  most  serious  cases,  the  records  of  offenses 
committed by a person as a child are sealed and may not be considered 
as a prior criminal record if that person is later tried as an adult for a 
criminal offense.

judge may certify a juvenile for trial as an adult  if the juvenile was at 
least 14 years of age at the time of the offense. 

HE JUSTICE COURTS 

The Texas Constitution requires that each county in the State establish 
between one and eight justice of the peace precincts, depending upon 
the  population  of  the  county.  At  least  one  justice  court  must  be 
established in each precinct. In counties with a population of 150,000 
or  greater,  more  than  one  justice  court  can  be  established  in  each 
precinct.  

Justice  of  the  peace  courts  have  original  jurisdiction  in  Class  C 
misdemeanor  criminal  cases,  which  are  less  serious  minor  offenses. 
These courts also have jurisdiction over minor civil matters. A justice 
of the peace may issue search or arrest warrants and may serve as the 
coroner  in  counties  where  there  is  no  provision  for  a  medical 
examiner. These courts also function as small claims courts.  

HE MUNICIPAL COURTS 

Under  its  authority  to  create  such  other  courts  as  may  be  necessary, 
the  Texas  Legislature  has  created  municipal  courts  in  each  of  the 
incorporated cities of the State.  

These courts have original and exclusive jurisdiction over violations of 
city ordinances and, within the city limits, have concurrent jurisdiction 
with  justice  of  the  peace  courts  over  Class  C  misdemeanor  criminal 
cases where the punishment upon conviction is by fine only. When city 
ordinances  relating  to  fire  safety,  zoning,  public  health,  or  sanitation 
are violated, fines of up to $2,000 may be charged, when authorized by 
the  governing  body  of  the  city.  Municipal  judges  may  issue  search  or 
arrest  warrants.  These  courts  do  not  have  jurisdiction  in  most  civil 
cases  but  do  have  limited  civil  jurisdiction  in  cases  which  involve 
owners of dangerous dogs.

The  Texas  Constitution  grants  jurisdiction  over  probate  matters  to 
either the constitutional county court or to the district court. Probate 
matters include the administration of estates of deceased persons, will 
contests,  the  guardianship  of  minors  and  incapacitated  persons,  and 
mental  illness  matters.  In  some  counties,  the  Legislature  has  granted 
the county court at law concurrent jurisdiction in probate matters with 
the  constitutional  county  court.  In  other  counties,  the  Legislature  has 
granted  the  county  court  at  law  concurrent  jurisdiction  in  probate 
matters  with  the  district  court.  In  the  more  populated  counties,  the 
Legislature  has  created  specialized  probate  courts  (entitled  statutory 
probate courts) to hear probate matters exclusively. 

Thus, probate matters might be heard in the county court, county court 
at law, statutory probate court, or district court of a particular county. 

Except in the most populous counties, Texas has no separate system of 
juvenile  courts.  Rather,  one  or  more  of  the  regular  district  or  county 
judges in each county is designated to hear juvenile cases. However, it 
is  sometimes the  custom to  refer to  a court  which  is  hearing  juvenile 
cases as the “Juvenile Court.” 

Juvenile  cases  include  proceedings  brought  against  persons  between 
the  ages  of  10  and  16  who  are  alleged  to  have  engaged  in  unlawful 
conduct  as  defined  by  the  Texas  Family  Code.  This  statute  labels 
conduct  subject  to  its  provisions  as  either  delinquent  conduct  or 
conduct indicating a need for supervision. Generally, delinquent conduct 
is defined as conduct by a child which, if committed by an adult, would 
be a serious criminal offense. 

Conduct indicating a need for supervision includes activity that would 
be  considered  a  minor  criminal  violation  if  committed  by  an  adult. 
Under  certain  circumstances  and  after  a  hearing,  the  juvenile  court 

HE JUVENILE COURTS

The two basic types of courts which make up the Texas judicial system 
are the trial and the appellate (or appeals) courts. 

Trial Courts 

Trial courts are courts in which witnesses are heard, exhibits are offered 
into evidence, and a verdict (in a jury trial) or a decision (in a case tried 
by  a  judge  alone)  is  reached  based  on  the  facts  of  the  case.  In  a  civil 
case, the decision or verdict determines which party wins the lawsuit; 
in a criminal case, it determines whether the defendant is guilty or not 
guilty of the crime alleged. 

Trial courts have original jurisdiction which means that all evidence is 
presented and all testimony is heard in these courts. 

A  more  detailed  discussion  of  the  specific  trial  courts  of  Texas  is 
included in a later section of this booklet. 

 

 

Appellate Courts 

Appellate courts hear appeals in cases which have been previously tried 
in the trial courts. No new evidence is presented and no witnesses are 
heard  on  the  appeal  of  a  case.  The  facts  of  the  case  have  been 
determined at the trial, and all testimony and evidence are contained in 
the record which was made in the trial court and sent to the appellate 
court  when  the  appeal  was  made.  The  appellate  court  makes  its 
decision  on  the  appeal  based  on  a  review  of  the  record  and  the 
arguments of the attorneys for both sides. The decision is based solely 
upon the evidence contained in the record and the law which pertains 
to the facts of the case.  

Certain trial courts, usually county courts, hear appeals from justice of 
the  peace  courts  and  from  those  municipal  courts  where  no  written 
record of the proceedings is made. In those situations the appeal takes

held  since  no  record  of  the  proceedings  is  made  in  the  lower  court. 
Some municipal courts are courts of record and appeals from them are 
based on the written record of the trial. 

A more detailed discussion of the specific appellate courts of Texas is 
included in a later section of this booklet.  

 

TRIAL BY JURY  

The  concept  of  trial  by  a  jury  of  ordinary  citizens  is  almost  as  old  as 
civilization  itself.  Groups  of  private  individuals  were  involved  in 
deciding  disputes  in  ancient  Egypt,  Greece,  Rome,  and  medieval 
England. The jury system as we know it in the United States is derived 
from the Magna Charta, signed by King John of England in 1215, which 
states: “No freeman shall be taken or imprisoned...unless by the lawful 
judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.” 

In a democracy such as ours, in which individual liberties are cherished 
and  the  powers  of  government  are  derived  from  the  people,  the  jury 
system  is  considered  to  be  a  fundamental  safeguard  of  constitutional 
rights.  The  Texas  Constitution,  in  Section  15  of  the  Bill  of  Rights, 
guarantees  to  all  persons  the  right  of  trial  by  jury.  Defendants  in 
criminal cases or the parties in civil lawsuits have the right to a trial by 
either six or twelve local citizens. Except in capital murder cases, this 
right to a trial by jury may be waived (given up). In that event, the judge 
hearing  the  case  will  make  the  decision.  In  a  jury  trial,  the  judge  will 
rule on any questions of law which arise during the trial, while the jury 
will  rule  on  the  facts  presented  to  them  during  the  trial  and  on  the 
credibility of the witnesses who testify during the trial. 

Most citizens will, at one time or another, be summoned to report for 
jury  service.  It  is  necessary  to  have  a  large  number  of  people  from 
which  to  select  a  fair,  impar­tial,  and  unprejudiced  jury.  The  reasons 
why any person is chosen or not chosen to serve on a particular jury

B  misdemeanor  criminal  cases,  which  are  the  more  serious  minor 
offenses.  These  courts  usually  have  appellate  jurisdiction  in  cases 
appealed  from  justice  of  the  peace  and  municipal  courts,  except  in 
counties where county courts at law have been established. Unless the 
appeal  is  one  from  a  designated  municipal  court  of  record  (trial 
proceedings  are  recorded  by  a  court  reporter),  the  appeal  takes  the 
form of a trial de novo (a completely new trial). 

In addition to performing judicial functions, the county judge serves as 
the  administrative  head  of  the  county  government.  In  the  more 
populated counties, the administrative duties occupy most of the time 
of  the  county  judge,  and  the  Legislature  has  created  county  courts  at 
law  and statutory  probate  courts  to  relieve  the county  judge  of  most, 
and in some cases all, of the judicial duties usually performed by that 
office. 

HE COUNTY COURTS AT LAW 

Because  the  Constitution  limits  each  county  to  a  single  county  court, 
the Legislature has created statutory county courts at law in the larger 
counties to aid the single county court in its judicial functions. 

The  legal  jurisdiction  of  the  special  county-level  trial  courts  varies 
considerably  and  is  established  by  the  statute  which  creates  the 
particular court. The jurisdiction of statutorily-created county courts at 
law  overlaps  to  some  extent  with  the  jurisdiction  of  the  county  and 
district courts in the county. 

The civil jurisdiction of county courts at law varies, but is usually more 
than  that  of  the  justice  of  the  peace  courts  and  less  than  that  of  the 
district courts. County courts at law usually have appellate jurisdiction 
in cases appealed from justice of the peace and municipal courts.

THE TRIAL COURTS 

The  Texas  trial  court  system  consists  of  several  different  types  of 
courts,  each  handling  different  categories  of  cases.  These  courts 
include the district courts, county courts, county courts of law, probate 
courts, justice courts, and municipal courts. 

HE DISTRICT COURTS 

The district courts are the trial courts of general jurisdiction of Texas. 
The  geographical  area  served  by  each  court  is  established  by  the 
Legislature,  but  each  county  must  be  served  by  at  least  one  district 
court. In sparsely populated areas of the State, several counties may be 
served by a single district court, while an urban county may be served 
by many district courts. District courts have original jurisdiction in all 
felony  criminal  cases,  divorce  cases,  cases  involving  title  to  land, 
election contest cases, civil matters in which the amount in controversy 
(the amount of money or damages involved) is $200 or more, and any 
matters in which jurisdiction is not placed exclusively in another trial 
court. While most district courts try both criminal and civil cases, in the 
more  densely  populated  counties  the  courts  may  specialize  in  civil, 
criminal, juvenile, or family law matters. 

HE CONSTITUTIONAL COUNTY COURTS 

As provided in the Texas Constitution, each of the 254 counties of the 
State has a single county court presided over by a county judge. 

These courts have concurrent jurisdiction with justice of the peace and 
district  courts  in  civil  cases  in  which  the  amount  in  controversy  is 
small.  Jurisdiction  is  said  to  be  concurrent  when  two  levels  of  courts 
have authority to try the same type of case. 

The constitutional county courts generally hear the probate cases filed 
in the county. They have original jurisdiction over all Class A and Class

serve  on  a  particular  jury  it  is  not  because someone thought  badly of 
that person, nor does it  mean that person will not be picked the next 
time he or she is summoned. The pay for jury service is small, but the 
rewards in terms of personal satisfaction can be great, and the value of 
such service to our legal system is immeasurable. 

TEXAS COURTS: AN OVERVIEW 

The  Texas  court  system  consists  of  a  Supreme  Court,  which  is  the 
highest  state  appellate  court  for  civil  matters;  a  Court  of  Criminal 
Appeals, which is the highest state appellate court for criminal matters; 
14 Courts of Appeals, which have intermediate appellate jurisdiction in 
both civil and criminal cases; and four levels of trial courts. 

The  state  trial  courts  of  general  jurisdiction  are  the  district  courts, 
which, in some metropolitan areas, specialize in civil, criminal, family 
law, or juvenile cases. The geographical area served by each individual 
district court is established by the specific statute creating that court. 
Each district court has one judge. 

Each of the 254 counties in Texas has a county court presided over by a 
county 
judge.  To  relieve  the  docket  congestion  of  this  single 
“constitutional”  county  court,  the  Legislature  has  established  county 
courts at law and statutory probate courts in many counties with large 
populations. 

In addition, each county is required to have at least one justice court. 
The  most  populous  counties  may  have  as  many  as  16  courts.  These 
courts also serve as small claims courts. 

The Legislature has created municipal courts in each incorporated city 
within  the  State.  Within  the  city  limits,  these  courts  have  concurrent 
criminal jurisdiction with the justice courts. Trial  in the justice courts 
and  most  municipal  courts  is  not  of  record,  and  appeals  from  these 
courts  are  by  way  of  new trial  in  the  county  court  or  county  court  at 
law.

THE APPELLATE COURTS 

The appellate courts of the Texas Judicial System include the Supreme 
Court and the Court of Criminal Appeals located in Austin, and the 14 
Courts of Appeals which are located in 14 cities throughout the State. 

HE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS 

  T

The  Supreme  Court  of  Texas  is  composed  of  a  Chief  Justice  and  eight 
justices.  It  has  statewide,  final  appellate  jurisdiction  in  all  civil  and 
juvenile cases. Most of the cases heard by this Court are appeals from 
an appellate ruling by one of the intermediate Courts of Appeals. The 
Supreme  Court  also  has  the  authority  to  determine  certain  legal 
matters  over  which  no  other  court  has  jurisdiction  and  to  issue  such 
orders as may be necessary to enforce its jurisdiction and to carry out 
the responsibilities of the Court.

from  one  of  the  14  intermediate  Courts  of  Appeals.  An  important 
exception  is  that  appeals  in  all  criminal  cases  in  which  the  death 
penalty has been imposed are made directly from the trial court to the 
Court  of  Criminal  Appeals.  This  Court  has  the  authority  to  issue  such 
orders as may be necessary to enforce its jurisdiction and judgments. 

HE COURTS OF APPEALS 

The  14  Courts  of  Appeals  have  intermediate  appellate  jurisdiction  in 
both  civil  and  criminal  cases  appealed  from  district  or  county  courts. 
Each Court of Appeals has jurisdiction in a specific geographical region 
of  the  State.  Each  Court  is  presided  over  by  a  chief  justice  and has  at 
least two other justices. The specific number of justices on each Court 
is  set  by  statute  and  ranges  from  three  to  13.  Presently  there  are  80 
justices authorized for these Courts. Appeals in the Courts of Appeals 
are usually heard by a panel of three justices, unless in a particular case 
an en banc hearing is ordered, in which instance all the justices of that 
Court hear and consider the case.
