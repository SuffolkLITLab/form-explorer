      <pre>Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 
 
Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 
 

APPEAL NO.: 

17-002 

ESPONDENT: 

Justice of the Peace, Precinct 1, Travis County 

ATE: 

 

May 24, 2017 

 

 

 

PECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge Stephen B. Ables, Chairman; Judge Mary Murphy; Judge 
Olen Underwood; Judge David Evans; Judge Kelly G. Moore 

Petitioner requested the following from Respondent: 1) the names of the justices of the peace 
in Travis County Precinct 1 that served during a specific time period, 2) the name and address of the 
“bonding agency insuring” those justices of the peace, 3) the names of the clerks of the court and 
their deputies who served during a certain time period, 4) the name and address of the “bonding 
agency insuring” the clerks and their deputies, 5) a list of cases from 2014 to present that involved 
alleged toll road violations, 6) the process by which the defendants in those cases were notified, 7) 
the type of warrants issued in those cases, and 8) the outcome of the cases.  Respondent denied 
Petitioner’s request for items 2 through 4 maintaining that they were questions, not requests for 
records, and therefore a response was not necessary.1  Respondent denied the request for items 5 
through 8 maintaining that they are case records that are not subject to Rule 12.  Respondent also 
stated  that  complying  with  the  request  would  put  an  undue  burden  on  Respondent  because the 
requested information is not maintained in the requested format and would require a manual review 
of each file. Petitioner then filed this appeal. 
 

A “judicial record” is defined by Rule 12.2(d) as a “record made or maintained by or for a 
court  or  judicial  agency  in  its  regular  course  of  business  but  not  pertaining  to  its  adjudicative 
function, regardless of  whether  that function  relates to  a  specific case.    A record  of  any nature 
created, produced, or filed in connection with any matter that is or has been before a court is not a 
judicial record.”  (Emphasis added.)   

 
 
Items 5 through 8 are requests for records related to cases that have been before the court.  
Therefore, they are not “judicial records” as defined by Rule 12.2(d) and they are not subject to Rule 
12.  See Rule 12 Decisions Nos. 15-017, 11-004, and 03-004. 

Respondent maintains that items 2 and 4 are questions, not requests for records, and that the 
“judiciary is not required to answer questions, create information or conduct research in responding 
to requests.”  There are no prior Rule 12 Decisions with similar facts to assist us in analyzing this 
position.  In these instances, Open Records Decisions and Open Records Letter Rulings issued by the 
Attorney General of Texas (AG) can be informative.  We found two Open Records Letter Rulings 
(ORL) on point.  In the first, ORL 06-1436 (February 13, 2006), the requestor had asked for the 
names of all city employees, their titles, salary, addresses and telephone numbers and the names of 
contractors who provided legal services to the city.  In the second, ORL 99-1252 (May 7, 1999), the 
request was for the names and phone numbers of companies and city officials working on a pipeline 

                                                 
1 Respondent provided Petitioner the information requested in item 1.

project.  In both cases the cities argued that the requests were questions, not requests for records, and 
that they were not required to research, create, or compile information to respond to questions.  In 
reaching its decision regarding the pertinent part of the request, the AG in ORL 06-1436 stated that 
“the city must make a good-faith effort to relate the request to information that it holds or to which it 
has access.” ORL 06-1436 at page 3. The AG continued with the following explanation:  
 

“In other words, if you are able to identify documents in the city's possession from 
which the requestor could ascertain the answers that he is seeking, you must provide 
the requestor with those documents. For example, the information the requestor is 
seeking about the name, title, salary, addresses, and phone numbers may be found in a 
human resources payroll document.2  While the act does not require you to compile 
the requested information from these documents, you should advise the requestor that 
he can obtain the information he is seeking from these documents.” 

We agree with the reasoning in both open records letter rulings. Following their guidance will 
ensure access to  judicial records even when a  requestor is unaware of the types of records that 
contain the requested information or how the records are maintained.  

In  the  request  at  issue  in  this  appeal,  Petitioner  asked  for  the  name  and  address  of  the 
“bonding agency insuring” certain justices of the peace and court clerks. Though a judicial officer 
does not have to answer questions, because the requested information is available in a record that can 
be provided to Petitioner, i.e. a copy of the bond, we conclude that Respondent should have advised 
Petitioner that the requested information is available in this record so that Petitioner could have 
requested it. 3  This conclusion is consistent with the requirement that Rule 12 be liberally construed 
to achieve its purpose and will ensure that the purpose of Rule 12, “to provide public access to 
information in the judiciary consistent with the mandates of the Texas Constitution that the public 
interests are best served by open courts…,” is satisfied. 

Lastly, we consider item number 3. We agree with Respondent that this request is also a 
question  rather  than  a  request  for  records.  Therefore,  consistent  with  our  conclusion  above,  if 
Respondent  has  a  record  that  contains  this  information,  Respondent  should  advise  Petitioner. 
Otherwise, no response is necessary.  
 

In summary, the requests for items 5 through 8 are for case records not judicial records under 
Rule 12, and we can neither grant the petition in whole or in part nor sustain the denial of access to 
the  requested  records.  Though  items  2,  3,  and  4  are  questions,  if  the  requested  information  is 
available in a record that can be provided to Petitioner, Respondent should advise Petitioner so that 
Petitioner can request the appropriate record. 
 

   

   

   

                                                 
2 In ORL 99-1252, the AG suggested that the requested information could be obtained from contracts with the 
companies. 
3 We note, however, that clerks of the justice courts are not required to post a bond so it is unlikely that a record 
exists that would be responsive to item number 4.
