TEXAS JUDICIAL COUNCIL

The Texas Judicial Council (TJC) was created by the 41st Texas Legislature in 1929 as the policy-making body for the state 
judiciary. The TJC is responsible for continuously studying and reporting on the “organization, rules, procedures and practice, 
work accomplished, results, and uniformity of the discretionary powers of the state courts and methods for their improvement.” 
To accomplish the purpose, the TJC designs “methods for simplifying judicial procedure, expediting the transaction of judicial 
business, and correcting faults in or improving the administration of justice.”

ANNUAL REPORT of JUDICIAL AGENCIES, BOARDS and COMMISSIONS7

The  Office  of  Court  Administration  (OCA)  provides  resources  and 
information for the efficient administration of the Judicial Branch of Texas.

he  OCA  has  been  led  Megan  LaVoie  since  December  2021,  the 
Administrative Director of OCA and the Executive Director of the Texas 
Judicial Council. The Administrative Director is supported by an executive 
assistant and a team of division directors. Formerly the Public Affairs 
Director, Ms. LaVoie is in the process of selecting a Government Relations 
Director and Communications Director to complete the Executive Team.
In an effort to better communicate with the public and court stakeholders, 
the Executive Division oversees the distribution of CourTex, a quarterly 
electronic publication to more than 4,400 stakeholders. It also manages 
the @TXCourts twitter feed for the Judicial Branch.

Executive staff presents at Board, Commission and Council meetings. 
In addition, Executive staff prepare and present testimony to numerous 
legislative committees.

In  FY  22  the  Executive  Division  served  as  staff  to  the  Texas  Judicial 
Compensation Commission. The Commission’s Report to the Legislature 
will be released prior to the convening of the 88th Legislature.

In FY 22, the OCA continued its expanded role in assisting the Judicial 
Branch  in  navigating  the  COVID-19  Pandemic.  Through  multiple 
Emergency Orders Regarding the COVID-19 State of Disaster, the Supreme 
Court of Texas required the OCA to provide guidance, technology support 
and trial support to courts across the state. The Court issued its 55th 
Emergency Order on August 30, 2022.

Inside FY 22, Texas Judges held approximately 848,760 remote hearings 
in every case type and type of proceeding, including bench trials, with 4 
million participants lasting almost 3.1 million hours.

OPERATION LONE STAR
In July 2021, OCA began supporting local court systems impacted by Operation Lone Star (OLS). This ongoing support 
includes facilitation of central magistration at two processing facilities in Val Verde and Jim Hogg Counties. Eighteen 
visiting judges appointed by the Supreme Court conduct magistrations at the temporary processing facilities. Through FY 
22, 6,038 magistrations have been conducted. OCA provides administrative support for the proceedings, including court 
interpretation services. Support staff consists of seven administrative assistants (four full-time, three part-time) and seven 
court interpreters, as well as a court services manager, special projects manager, and a court consultant who liaise between 
various court system participants to problem solve and ensure daily dockets are processed.

ANNUAL REPORT of JUDICIAL AGENCIES, BOARDS and COMMISSIONSLanguage Access Program
OCA’s Language Access Program provides assistance to courts in communicating with individuals with limited English proficiency, 
giving these individuals meaningful access to their legal proceedings through audio or video remote interpreting provided by 
the Texas Court Remote Interpreter Service staff.

During FY 22, the demand for OCA’s remote interpreting services continued to increase, resulting in the conversion of a third 
temporary staff interpreter to a permanent full-time position. The three remote interpreters provided free Spanish, French 
and Portuguese interpretation services in 3,037 hearings serving 121 counties across Texas. The continued increases in the 
Language Access Program services this fiscal year resulted in the posting of two additional temporary full-time interpreters 
using funds from the American Rescue Plan Act.

In addition, this department was also tasked to supply interpreting services in magistrations generated by the Governor’s border 
initiative under Operation Lone Star. This duty began at the end of July of 2021. During FY 22, this department also coordinated 
contract interpreters to interpret in 4,541 remote magistration hearings via video conference.

While providing interpreting services to Texas Courts, the Language Access Program also provided document translation 
services to the Supreme Court of Texas in the newly enacted Seizure Exemption forms pursuant to HB 3774 (87th Legislature).

ANNUAL REPORT of JUDICIAL AGENCIES, BOARDS and COMMISSIONSCourt Security Division
New and enhanced laws in court security are designed to 
improve  the  security  of  judges  at  all  levels,  both  in  their 
courthouses and at their homes. These laws do the following:

the residence address of a judge or judge’s spouse. 

•  Oversee the collection of court security incident 

• 

reporting; and 
Serve as a clearinghouse of information regarding the 
new law and judicial and court security best practices. 

Provide for the suppression of the residence address 
of a judge and judge’s spouse in records maintained 
by the Texas Ethics Commission, a county registrar, 
and a county appraisal district. The law also allows a 
judge and judge’s spouse to replace their home address 
on their driver’s license with the address of the 
courthouse in which the judge serves.
Requires county clerks, upon the written request of a 
judge, to omit or redact personal information from an 
online database that is made public. 
Requires that a courthouse security committee be 
established by the presiding judge of a municipality or 
the local administrative district judge in each county, 
respectively. 
Establishes a $5.00 filing fee on any civil action or 
proceeding requiring a filing fee to generate revenue 
to support judicial and court personnel training. 
Transfers responsibility for reporting security 
incidents to OCA from the local administrative judge to 
the law enforcement official responsible for providing 
court security. 
Requires any person providing security to hold a 
court security certification issued by a training 
program approved by the Texas Commission on Law 
Enforcement; and 
Authorizes any commissioned peace officer in 
the state to provide personal security to a judge, 
regardless of the location of the law enforcement 
agency that employs or commissions the peace officer. 

The purpose of the Court Security Division is to: 

Support the establishment of court security 
committees through training and technical assistance. 
Assist courts with conducting and reviewing security 
and emergency preparedness assessments and 
developing improvement plans. 
Support the implementation of privacy protections for 
judges by facilitating the restriction of public access to

In FY 22, the Court Security Divisions’ efforts to assess court 
facilities and provide court security training was impacted 
by the ongoing pandemic, declared state of disaster in 254 
counties, and Emergency Orders issued by the Texas Supreme 
Court  outlining  minimum  standard  health  protocols  to 
conduct in-person hearings. To continue services during the 
pandemic, courts availed themselves to a virtual environment 
minimizing the Court Security Division’s ability to provide 
on-site assessments, training evolutions, and assist in the 
establishment  of  court  security  committees.  Now  that 
courts across the state have resumed in-person hearings, 
the  Division  has  been  able  to  procced  with  assessments, 

There was a marked 
increase in judicial threats 
and reported courthouse 
related incidents this 
fiscal year.

trainings, and establishments of court security committees. 
There was a marked increase in judicial threats and reported 
courthouse related incidents this fiscal year. The resumption 
of normal court related business will task the Divisions’ effort 
to address the backlog of courthouse assessments coupled 
with meeting future court security related demands in training 
and assessments. To maximize OCA’s outreach promoting 
awareness  of  the  privacy  protections  afforded  pursuant 
to SB 42, OCA staff provided numerous in-person Judicial, 
Court Professional and Court Partnership Conferences. OCA 
continued to provide personal security related information 
with the ability for judges to submit on-site, their privacy 
questionnaire and address court security related concerns or 
questions with staff. 

ANNUAL REPORT of JUDICIAL AGENCIES, BOARDS and COMMISSIONSIncident reporting to OCA reflected a total of 527 
incident reports submitted in FY 22, a 39% increase 
over FY 21. To date, 1,527 judicial officers have taken 
advantage of having their personal and residential 
information suppressed from public view.

Additionally, during this period, the Court Security 
Director will facilitate the Supreme Court’s Advisory 
Committee on Judicial Emergency Preparedness 
and Court Security as well as the Annual Report to 
the Legislature on Court Security.

Courthouse vulnerability assessments continued 
to encompass the workload of the Court Security 
Division. In addition, judicial home assessments 
continue to be part of the landscape in addressing 
judicial  threat  environments.  Courthouses  have 
continued  to  express  a  need  for  evaluation  and 
consultation,  and  the  Division  expects  FY  23  to 
be  busy  addressing  the  backlog  of  courthouse 
assessment  requests  as  restrictions  ease  and  a 
gradual resumption of normal activities occurs.

The  Court  Security  Division  recently  launched 
their first statewide survey of Courthouse Security 
Committees. OCA is preparing the finished report 
which will support the Court Security Division by 
identifying counties having reported established 
Courthouse Security Committees and provide a solid 
foundation for evaluating the ongoing challenges 
and security needs faced by Texas Courts.

Children’s Courts Program
The Children’s Courts program is comprised of 73 operational courts - 30 
child protection and 43 child support courts (CPC and CSC, respectively) 
covering 148 counties. Each court has an associate judge appointed by 
the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions and a court 
coordinator. The judge and court coordinator are employed by the OCA. 
The  Children’s  Courts  Program  Manager  staffs  the  program  serving 
as point-of-contact for the courts coordinating with OCA divisions in 
servicing court needs, i.e., equipment, supplies, travel, and HR-related 
issues. 

During this last fiscal year, several Children’s Courts associate judges and 
court coordinators retired. Replacements were hired through August 31, 
2021. Fortunately, a few judges will continue to share their years of child 
welfare and child support expertise by sitting as visiting associate judges. 

Many  OCA  headquarters  and  field  staff  worked  remotely  including 
Children’s Courts judges and court coordinators. The Supreme Court 
issued additional Orders extending court deadlines in CPS cases and 
authorizing the continuation of remote hearings. The most recently 
issued order requires judges to hold virtual proceedings from their “usual 
location” which generally is their courtroom. Counsel, parties, witnesses, 
etc. may continue to participate in hearings remotely. OCA’s Research 
and Court Services Director and the Children’s Courts Program Manager 
continued ongoing meetings with the Office of Attorney General Child 
Support Division and the Texas Supreme Court’s Permanent Judicial 
Commission for Children, Youth and Families (Children’s Commission) 
leadership regarding remote hearings and child support dockets, to 
study the efficacy of remote hearings in child welfare cases, and future 
equipment needs for a hybrid hearing approach. Six child protection 
courts received equipment to assist in holding hybrid hearings as part of 
pilot program funded by the Children’s Commission.

Since the last report, OCA hired three Early Intervention Court Liaisons 
(EICLs) as part of a pilot initiative with the Children’s Commission and 
the  Department  of  Family  Protective  Services’  Prevention  and  Early 
Intervention (PEI) Team. The EICLs report to the Children’s Courts Program 
Manager. PEI awarded a grant to OCA to fund the positions. PEI identified 
three communities in need of resources to address high maltreatment 
risk numbers for youth in the communities. The EICL positions were 
created to serve as special assistants to child protection courts in the 
communities to enhance the court’s knowledge of available resources in 
the community to refer families at risk of having children removed from 
their homes. The EICLs are working to bridge gaps within the child welfare

ANNUAL REPORT of JUDICIAL AGENCIES, BOARDS and COMMISSIONSSpecialty Courts
The Research and Court Services Division (RCSD) continues to have direct responsibility to 
provide technical assistance to and monitor Specialty Courts’ compliance with programmatic 
best practices and coordinate and provide information to the Governor’s Criminal Justice 
Division (CJD). These duties include registering new Specialty Courts and maintenance of 
the statewide Specialty Court registry. At the conclusion of FY 22, there were 204 registered 
Specialty Courts. The Statewide Problem-Solving Court Coordinator (SPSCC), RCSD Director, 
and RCSD staff stand ready to assist Specialty Court teams across the State. 

In FY 22, the SPSCC continued representing OCA and the State of Texas by attending and 
participating in specialty court-related meetings and conferences sponsored by a diverse 
body of stakeholders, including but not limited to, the National Association of Drug Court 
Professionals (NADCP), the Texas Association of Specialty Courts (TASC), the Conference of 
Chief Justices and Conference of State Court Administrators (CCJ-COSCA), the CJD and CJD’s 
Specialty Courts Advisory Council (SCAC), the Center for Court Innovation (CCI), and the Texas 
Specialty Court Resource Center (SCRC). The SPSCC continued to serve as the Specialty Court 
Ombudsman, the single point-of-contact for specialty court participants and team members 
to report complaints/concerns about program operations, processes, and individual team 
members, including the specialty court judge.

Centers of Excellence
The Centers of Excellence was an initiative by the Public Trust and Confidence Committee of 
the Texas Judicial Council to identify courts across the State of Texas doing exceptional work in 
judicial administration. The program launched in 2018 and identified two early partner courts—
the 347th and the 214th district courts in Nueces County, which were recognized as the first 
Centers of Excellence by the Texas Judicial Council in June of 2019. The program continued 
bringing in partner courts, working with the Webb County Court at Law II and Montgomery 
County Court at Law II. Both courts were successfully recognized as Centers of Excellence in 
November of 2019 and February 2020 respectively.

The Centers of Excellence Program continues to work to identify, support, and evaluate courts 
pursuing excellence in judicial administration at all levels across the state of Texas. The 
program was put on hold in March of 2020 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, 
the Centers of Excellence program was relaunched following an extensive review and evaluation 
of the program, incorporating lessons learned during the pandemic and examples drawn from 
existing Centers of Excellence. There are currently seven courts participating in the program 
with eventual recognition set for partner courts beginning in 2023.

ANNUAL REPORT of JUDICIAL AGENCIES, BOARDS and COMMISSIONSUniform Case Management 
System
In response to Governor Greg Abbott’s School Safety 
Action Plan, the 86th Texas Legislature appropriated 
funds  to  the  Office  of  Court  Administration  to 
contract with a third party to establish a uniform 
case  management  system  for  use  by  counties, 
focusing primarily on counties with a population 
of 20,000 or less.

It was the intent of the Texas legislature that OCA 
procure  a  system  that  would:  (1)  collect  county 
judicial data, including mental health adjudications 
and  domestic  violence  protective  orders;  (2) 
provide timely and accurate reporting of judicial 
data to the office and the national criminal history 
record  information  and  mental  health  record 
repositories;  (3)  easily  integrate  with  existing 
state and countywide systems to allow frequent 
sharing of information between systems; and (4) 
include adequate reporting standards to ensure 
the accurate reporting of information through the 
system.

In  August  of  2021,  OCA  successfully  executed 
contracts  for  the  statewide  Uniform  Case 
Management System known as UCMS, with three 
(3) vendors. Clerk’s Offices across Texas have the 
opportunity  to  work  with  a  selected  vendor,  at 
no-cost, for implementation of a UCMS. The vendor 
selected will be responsible for implementing UCMS 
for use by the Clerk’s Offices and provide hosting, 
training,  maintenance,  and  ongoing  production 
support services for Clerk’s Offices that elect to use 
UCMS. To the extent that a Clerk’s Office seeks data 
conversion or migration, it may contract directly 
with the vendor for such services.

Remote Hearings Study
OCA, in consultation with the National Center for 
State Courts, worked on a project funded by the 
State  Justice  Institute  to  conduct  an  evaluation 
of the impact of virtual court services on judicial 

workload in the Texas trial courts. Initially, the work started with 11 
jurisdictions across the state and ended with 9 for the study. Many judges 
recorded the time spent on hearings for a three-week period. This data, 
along with other observational data, is being used to finalize a study on the 
impact of remote hearings in Texas. The report was finalized December 
2021.

Expedited Actions Evaluation
OCA is currently working with the National Center for State Courts and 
the Institute for the Advancement of the American Legal System to review 
the current practice of the use of the civil Expedited Action Rules in Texas 
courts. They are evaluating a sample of over 2,500 cases in which the 
rules may apply to research their applicability and use. The evaluation is 
a current undertaking, last observed in 2016. The outcome should help 
inform whether any amendments should be made to the rules, or if efforts 
need to be made to further education judges and attorneys on the use of 
the rules in eligible cases.

Pretrial and Bail
In September 2021, during the Second Special Called Session of the 87th 
Legislature, Senate Bill 6 (the Damon Allen Act) was enacted. The Damon 
Allen Act established procedures for setting bail and the reporting of bail 
information, set certification and reporting requirements for charitable 
bail organizations, amended procedures regarding cash bail bonds, and 
specified additional training requirements for judges and other positions 
setting bail (law enforcement officials when applicable per SB 6). The bill 
required OCA to implement a standardized public safety report system 
(PSRS) for statewide use by April 1, 2022, and to provide access, at no cost, 
to the appropriate officials in each county and each municipality that 
perform magistrations. Magistrates who set bail are required to consider 
the public safety report generated in the PSRS for defendants charged 
with Class B misdemeanor or higher categories of offenses.

The  project  consisted  of  developing  the  statewide  PSRS  which  met 
the requirements of Senate Bill 6, implementing the PSRS in all local 
magistrate offices throughout the State, and providing training for all 
statewide users in the use of the system. OCA contracted with Automon 
(vendor) to develop the PSRS and hired two full time employees to support 
the project.

The PSRS began operations on April 1, 2022, as required by legislation. As 
of the end of FY 22, there were 5,718 active users and 228 counties that 
have completed magistrations in the system. A total of 215,836 bail forms 
have been completed from April 1 through August 31, 2022. These bail

SB 6 requires charitable bail organizations to submit a report to the sheriff of a county in which the organization paid a bail 
bond for a defendant. This report must be submitted by the 10th of each month. The sheriff then should provide a copy of the 
report to the OCA.

Bexar, Harris, Hays, and Travis counties have provided charitable bail reports to OCA this year. One non-profit organization, 
The Bail Project, is responsible for all the bails reported in Harris, Hays, and Travis counties. The reports from Bexar County 
came from The Texas Organizing Project. The total defendants reported bailed out for the four counties is represented in the 
chart below:

SB 6 required OCA to develop statewide procedures and forms to be used by courts to facilitate the refund of funds paid toward 
monetary bonds and/ or application of the cash funds towards the defendant’s outstanding court costs and other fees. These 
forms are available on the OCA website for courts and clerks to access.

Judges who set bail for defendants charged with Class B misdemeanors or higher offenses are required to complete 8 hours of 
judicial education on the duties of magistrates and setting bail, per SB 6. The required judicial education is provided through 
the Texas Center for the Judiciary, Texas Municipal Court Education Center, Texas Justice Court Training Center, and Texas 
Association of Counties.

Weighted Caseload Study
OCA  was  slated  to  conduct  a  weighted 
caseload study in the Spring of 2020. The 
86th  Legislature  in  Senate  Bill  891  (2019, 
Regular Session) directed OCA to contract 
with the National Center for State Courts 
to conduct a study of the caseloads of the 
district and statutory county courts in the 
State of Texas. The pandemic unfortunately 
put  a  pause  on  the  study  which  was  to 
occur in spring of 2021. The agency is now 
targeting launching the study in early 2023. 
OCA staff, judges, and representatives from 
the NCSC met in October 2022 to discuss a 
plan and schedule.

worked with zConnect.io to provide an 
additional  layer  to  Zoom  that  allows 
judges to manage their mass docket calls. 
It allows judges to upload a copy of their 
docket and groups participants based on 
the case that they are involved with. The 
product was made available to all judges 
that have a Zoom account.

As  part  of  the  Children’s  Commission 
grant  program,  OCA  assisted  in  the 
ordering and delivery of hybrid hearing 
equipment to several child protection 
courts. The commission is evaluating the 
program for possible expansion.

The 88th Legislative Appropriations Request for 2024-2025
The Legislative Appropriations Request for the 2024-2025 biennium was submitted to the Legislative Budget Board and Governor’s 
Office on August 5, 2022. The total baseline budget request for 2024-2025 totaled $224.7 million. Exceptional Item requests 
totaled $77.8 million; $28.7 million for OCA and $50 million for TIDC. OCA’s Exceptional Items, excluding TIDC, are as follows:

• 

Judiciary-wide Inflation Relief and Staff Retention and Recruitment – $2.8 Million. As the US Inflation rate continues to 
rise, coupled with consumer prices rising 9.1 percent year over year in June 2022, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court 
has supported a 10% increase for non-judicial staff for the next biennium, branch wide. As it is for all public servants, it is 
critical to equalize the impact of the economy for our judicial branch employees with a salary increase. The Judiciary had 
the third highest turnover rate in FY2021, falling below only Health and Human Services and Public Safety and Criminal 
Justice. The agency risks losing valuable state employees to larger state agencies that can afford higher salaries or to the 
private sector.

•  Replace Legacy System, Case Level Data - $6 Million. This project replaces the legacy system responsible for collecting 

and analyzing judicial data. The system in production was last upgraded in 2010. The legacy system only collects court 
data in aggregate, limiting the policy analysis that can be done to make our courts more efficient. The new system will 
be a vendor-hosted, cloud-based system that will collect case-level data. Automated Programming Interfaces (APIs) will 
be used to allow each court to report data in near real-time. Additionally, OCA staff will be given a business intelligence 
platform to manipulate the data to answer policy questions posed by the Judicial Council and the Legislature.

•  Replace Legacy System, Texas Appellate Case Management System - $11.9 Million. This project replaces the legacy 

system that provides case management of the appellate courts of Texas. The current system in production was last 
upgraded in 2010. Additionally, the new system also replaces the external interfaces to appellate attorneys, trial court 
clerks, and the public in general that want to review case documents at the appellate courts. The new system will be a 

24

ANNUAL REPORT of JUDICIAL AGENCIES, BOARDS and COMMISSIONS• 

vendor-hosted, cloud-based system that will manage appellate court cases and provide access to court documents. It will 
also manage court conferencing for the two high courts as well as writs management of the Court of Criminal Appeals.
Information Technology Licensing - $4.3 Million. OCA provides direct IT services to the high courts, courts of appeals, 
and all judicial branch agencies. This includes licensing of Microsoft EA, Adobe, DocuSign, Zoom, Azure, cybersecurity 
tools, and other various software to ensure that our users operate efficiently and are secure. At the same time, as OCA 
continues to shift operations to the cloud, cloud costs are naturally increasing as well. This exceptional item requests 
funding for licenses that have increased nearly 300% since 2019. This item also requests funding for the OCA network, 
which is nearing the manufacturer’s end of life. Replacing the equipment greatly improves the agency’s cybersecurity 
posture with additional features that do not exist in the current network. This includes the replacement of switches, 
routers, WiFi, perimeter networking devices and cybersecurity upgrades.

•  Court Services Staff Needs – (2) Specialty Court Program Specialists and (2) Court Security Specialists - $657,500. 

Effective September 2019, as a result of the 86th legislative session, the oversight of specialty courts was transferred from 
the Criminal Justice Division of the Governor’s Office to OCA. A large number of responsibilities came with the oversight, 
but no FTE resources. As of June 2022, there are currently 247 registered and active specialty courts in the state. OCA 
expects an increase in demand for specialty courts, especially mental health courts in the near future. OCA is requesting 
funding for two additional FTEs for Research and Court Services dedicated to specialty courts. This exceptional item 
also requests two more FTEs for the Court Security division. Over time, court personnel have recognized the need for 
resources addressing improved courthouse security. The two current FTEs are spread too thin to adequately serve all 
judicial officers and courthouses in the state requesting assistance. Texas needs to have more dedicated resources to help 
improve privacy protections, physical protections, and training for those in courthouses and at the homes of our judicial 
officers.

•  Children’s Court Needs - $1.1 Million. OCA has a large number of judges and court coordinators that can retire. Due to 
the length in state government of the staff, lump sum payments can be very high. Payouts of this size are very costly to 
the budget and is especially hard for the IV-D Child Support program, as the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) will not 
reimburse the agency for 66% of these costs as they do for all IV-D salaries and operating expenditures. OCA is requesting 
restoration of the $300,000 that was in the budget during the 22-23 biennium. This exceptional item also requests funding 
for the IV-D program staff computers, software, and one FTE for the IT Support Desk. Currently, these services are 
provided by the OAG, creating a conflict of interest in the IV-D courts, with one party to the case (OAG) responsible for 
maintaining equipment for staff that are employed by another state agency (OCA). Finally, this exceptional item requests 
an additional 5% salary increase for the court coordinators. This 5% is in addition to the 10% requested in the first 
exceptional item above. The court coordinators are often recruited to the county they live in at a significant increase. This 
additional 5% will help OCA retain these skilled staff members. 

•  Operation Lone Star - $1.03 Million. OCA received the current appropriations for Operation Lone Star in our base budget 
for 24-25. Since the original budget was requested, revisions to the financial needs of providing magistration services 
have been made to accommodate actual needs. Our original request did not include administrative assistants needed to 
manage the Zoom hearings. We have also identified a need for administrative assistants for weekend magistrations. We 
determined the need for a court consultant to assist counties with magistration processes. This request will supplement 
the existing budget and add four FTEs if granted.

In Summary, the Office of Court Administration requested a total of $224,672,954 (excluding exceptional items) for the 2024-
2025 biennium compared to $252,268,427 for the 2022-2023 biennium. Appropriations decreased by $27.9 million, or 11.04% 
decrease from the 2022-2023 biennium, due largely from the elimination of one-time restoration of revenue loss to the Fair 
Defense Account, and grant funding provided last biennium from the Governor’s Office for Operation Lone Star.

ANNUAL REPORT of JUDICIAL AGENCIES, BOARDS and COMMISSIONSRegistration of Guardianships 
SB 1096 (Zaffirini/Smithee) created a safety net to ensure guardians are registered, properly trained, receive a criminal history 
background check, and guardian contact data is provided to DPS and its Law Enforcement Terminal System (TLETS) to identify 
persons under guardianship if law enforcement contact is made with them. 

June 1, 2018, OCA implemented an online system to register every guardianship in the state prior to appointment. As a registration 
prerequisite, the OCA conducts a criminal history background check and provides online training to proposed guardians. Since 
June 1, 2018, our registration team has processed the following.

Guardianship Abuse, Fraud Exploitation Deterrence Program (GAFEDP)
On September 1, 2019, the OCA implemented the GAFEDP to provide resources to the courts relating to monitoring and 
compliance of guardianship matters pursuant to SB 31 & HB 1286 (Zaffirini/Smithee). Our team of auditor’s review guardianship 
cases to identify reporting deficiencies by guardians, audit annual accountings, and report to the courts any concerns of potential 
abuse, fraud, or financial exploitation. We currently have one manager, two trainers, and 15 program auditors assigned statewide. 

The program is offered at no expense to counties throughout the state. Courts throughout the state are required to participate 
in the program if selected and may also request program participation. Additionally, the OCA director may notify the Judicial 
Conduct Commission of any concerns involving judges who fail to act upon concerns raised by compliance specialists. On 
January 1, 2022, the GAFEDP issued the 2021 Annual Report to the Texas Legislature.

MONITORING AND AUDITS
The annual reports of the well-being and 
the financial annual accounts should be 
monitored, and a sample of the reports 
should be audited to ensure that the data 
submitted  is  complete  and  accurate. 
Monitoring  and  auditing  would  also 
create a deterrence against theft and 
fraud.

DEVELOPMENT OF A STATEWIDE 
ONLINE GUARDIANSHIP 
REPORTING PORTAL
The  OCA  has  been  developing  an 
automated,  electronic  tool  for  filing 
required reports, annual accountings, 
and other documents in guardianship 
cases. This system will provide a method 
to notify courts when required reports 
are  delinquent  and  to  review  annual 
accounting  reports  for  potentially 
fraudulent activities.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 
GUARDIANSHIP ABUSE FRAUD 
AND EXPLOITATION DETERRENCE 
PROGRAM (GAFEDP)
While the reforms implemented to date 
have improved the guardianship system 
in Texas, a key to the reforms’ success is 
ensuring compliance with the laws and 
reviewing guardianship activities to spot 
potential abuse, fraud, and exploitation. 
To provide a safety net for all vulnerable 
persons under the care of guardians, the 
Judicial Council proposed expanding the 
GCP  statewide  as  proposed  in  OCA’s 
legislative appropriations request and SB 
31 (86th R.S., Zaffirini et al). OCA is in the 
process of implementing the program 
and hiring the personnel necessary to 
monitor cases throughout the state.

ANNUAL REPORT of JUDICIAL AGENCIES, BOARDS and COMMISSIONSTRAINING AND RESOURCES FOR 
COURTS AND CLERKS 
Only  by  pro-actively  training  court 
personnel and proposed guardians on 
the  fiduciary  duties  of  guardianship, 
as  well  as  auditing  reports  and 
accountings  to  detect  and  deter 
fraud  and  exploitation,  will  Texas  be 
adequately braced to ensure the safety 
and  well-being  of  this  vulnerable  and 
growing population. In addition to our 
online training of guardians on fiduciary 
record-maintenance  and  reporting 
duties, ongoing training and professional 
development is recommended for court 
and  clerk  staff  on  the  collection  and 
reporting of required guardianship data, 
as well as training on the fiduciary duties 
of guardians to inform the direction and 
guidance of proposed guardians.

Our mission is to assist the courts in 
protecting our most vulnerable citizens 
and their assets.

GAFEDP RECENT DEVELOPMENTS:

• 

• 

The GAFEDP finalized the 2021 program annual report. The report is due 
to the legislature on January 1, regarding the performance of the program 
and includes the number of courts involved in the program; the number of 
guardianships reviewed; the number of reviewed guardianship cases found 
to be out of compliance with statutory reporting requirement; the number of 
cases reported to a court concerning potential abuse, fraud, or exploitation, 
including financial exploitation, committed against a ward; and the status of 
any technology developed to monitor guardianship cases.

•  Our GAFEDP Manger participated in the revision of the 2022 NACM 

Guardianship Guide. Thanks to Rebecca Doolittle for participating in the 
development of this nationwide comprehensive guardianship resource.
•  Our Team met with researchers contracted to work with the National 

Institute of Justice (NIJ) to conduct an environmental scan of guardianship 
and conservatorship abuse and fraud, identify opportunities to advance 
knowledge through research or data collection, and write reports and 
a summary overview based on our findings to inform future NIJ and/or 
Department of Justice (DOJ) on research and data collection.
The team continued finalizing the GAFEDP financial accounting audit 
procedures with the goal of implementing in counties soon.

The Enterprise Planning Office (EPO) manages agency projects within OCA. Our goal is to plan, execute, and deliver projects 
statewide for the judiciary. Our project team collaborates with SMEs, stakeholders, and project team members to develop 
requirements and implement projects. The EPO also manages the agency contract management process.

PUBLIC SAFETY REPORT SYSTEM – SB6 (HUFFMAN/SMITHEE)
The Second Called Session of the 87th Legislature (2021), enacted Senate Bill 6 which requires the Office of Court Administration 
(OCA) to develop a statewide Public Safety Report System and requires magistrates who set bail for defendants charged with 
a Class B misdemeanor or higher category offense to consider a public safety report generated by the Public Safety Report 
System. The PSRS went live on April 1, 2022, and generates a public safety report with respect to a defendant for magistrates 
to consider before setting bail for defendants charged with a Class B misdemeanor or higher category offense, 2) provides 
the bail form that must be completed by magistrates, judges, sheriffs, peace officers and jailers who set bail under Chapter 17, 
Code of Criminal Procedure, for a defendant charged with a Class B misdemeanor or higher category offense, and 3) provides 
a system/process for the bail form to be submitted to OCA.

UNIFORM CASE MANAGEMENT – HB 1 (ZERWAS/NELSON)
The legislature allocated funding to OCA to procure a cloud-based uniform case management system. OCA intends the system 
to be of no-cost to counties and will be targeted at counties with less than 20,000 in population. The Project kicked off on 
September 1, 2021. The project team is currently working requirements gathering and system testing with the selected vendors 
for the early adopters in Crane and Brewster counties. 

COURT REMINDER PROGRAM- HB 4293
House Bill 4293, of the 87th Legislative session directs OCA to 
develop and make available to each county at no cost a Court 
Reminder Program, that allows county statewide to send text 
messages to notify defendants of a scheduled court appearance. 
Therefore, OCA will procure a vendor that provides a scalable, 
Commercial-off the Shelf (COTS) system for use statewide. Our 
team has been working on enveloping project requirements, scope, 
and budget for the statement of work.

The Judiciary, the Legislature, state agencies, and other entities have a need to access consolidated statewide case level data 
to augment their policy decisions, adjust to criminal and civil trends in courts and provide comprehensive statewide reporting. 
Court case level data is currently stored within jurisdictions and not consolidated at a statewide level. The project will create a 
centralized judicial data warehouse that will allow both judicial staff and the public to access statewide case level information 
for statistical reporting and analysis. High level summary level data is currently report to the OCA, but it does not provide the 
level of detail to effectively support government policy decisions. This project would provide consolidated rich data at a detail 
level that will allow for business intelligence and analysis to meet the growing need for detailed analysis and reporting.

The product delivered by the project will be named the Case Level Data System (CLDS).

mentors  and  receive  nationally 
recognized  training  from  Gideon’s 
Promise.  The  Core  101  Training  took 
place in April and May of 2022.

Operation Lone Star
In  March  2021,  Governor  Abbott 
declared a disaster in response to the 
rise in illegal immigration and launched 
Operation  Lone  Star  (OLS).  In  August 
2021, the Supreme Court of Texas issued 
an order authorizing TIDC to create a 
plan for protecting the constitutionally 
guaranteed right to counsel of indigent 
OLS  defendants.  Pursuant  to  an 
emergency board meeting, TIDC granted 
funds to the Lubbock Private Defender’s 
Office  (LPDO)  to  serve  as  an  indigent 
defense hub, responsible for appointing 
counsel  to  indigent  OLS  defendants. 
HB9  of  the  2nd  called  session,  87th 
Texas Legislature allocated $32,486,125 
from the General Revenue fund to the 
Office of Court Administration (OCA), 
which subsequently funded TIDC - OLS 
operations  with  a  biennial  budget  of 
$29,664,625. To date, TIDC has awarded 
about  $24.4  million  in  OLS  funds  to 
support OLS indigent defense operations 
through August 2023. TIDC will continue 
to set standards and grant requirements 
for counsel appointed to Operation Lone 
Star cases and will monitor the Operation 
Lone  Star  appointment  system  for 
compliance with fair defense laws.

Child  Protective  Services 
Data Reporting
During  the  86th  legislative  session, 
SB560 directed the Texas Judicial Council 
(TJC) to collect data about court-ordered 
representation  in  child  protective 
services (CPS) cases from all 254 Texas 
counties, and TJC tasked TIDC with that 
collection.  In  September  2021,  TIDC 
hired its first Child Protective Services 
Senior Policy Analyst to implement this 
statewide system for gathering the data. 
In  preparation  for  November  1,  2021, 
county reporting deadlines, TIDC created 
reporting  forms  for  both  CPS  court-
ordered representation judicial plans and 
expenditure reports. TIDC completed 
instructions for the judicial plan and an 
updated Indigent Defense Expenditure 
Report manual to include information 
about court-ordered representation in 
CPS cases. TIDC notified each county’s 
Local Administrative District Judge and 
County Auditor about the new reporting 
requirements. An in-person and online 
training  was  provided  for  County 
Auditors before the November 1, 2021 
reporting deadline. Data for FY2021 was 
collected, reviewed, and compiled in a 
report. The report was submitted to the 
Texas Judicial Council.

TIDC has also created a model attorney 
fee  voucher  to  assist  counties  in 
capturing data that will be required in 
the FY2022 report. In preparation for 
FY2022  expenditure  reporting,  TIDC 
conducted a training webinar for County 
Auditors on April 28, 2022.

The Texas Legislature created the Texas Forensic Science Commission (“Commission”) during the 79th Legislative Session 
by amending the Code of Criminal Procedure to add Article 38.01, which describes the composition and authority of the 
Commission. The Commission is required to investigate allegations of professional negligence or professional misconduct that 
would substantially affect the integrity of the results of a forensic analysis conducted by a crime laboratory. The Commission is 
also charged with developing and implementing a reporting system through which accredited laboratories report professional 
negligence  or  misconduct.  During  subsequent  legislative  sessions,  the  Texas  Legislature  further  amended  the  Code  of 
Criminal Procedure, clarifying and expanding the Commission’s jurisdiction to include oversight of the State’s crime laboratory 
accreditation and forensic analyst licensing programs. The 87th Texas Legislature tasked the Commission with establishing a 
code of professional responsibility to regulate the conduct of 
persons, laboratories, facilities, and other entities subject to 
the Commission’s jurisdiction. The Commission is also actively 
engaged in various forensic development initiatives and works 
collaboratively with stakeholders in the criminal justice system 
to improve education and training in forensic science and the 
law, including the Court of Criminal Appeals training initiatives 
led by Judge Barbara Hervey.

ANNUAL REPORT of JUDICIAL AGENCIES, BOARDS and COMMISSIONSTHE STATE LAW LIBRARY

STATE LAW LIBRARY 
ORGANIZATION:
•  12 FTEs
•  Administered by 
the State Law 
Library Board
•  Board members 
designated by: 
•  Supreme Court
•  Court of Criminal 

Appeals

•  Office of the 

Attorney General

The State Law Library (SLL) was established as the law library for the 
Supreme Court in 1854 and was expanded to include direct service to 
the public in 1971. The State Law Library’s mission is to provide legal 
information and research materials to state agencies and the residents of 
Texas. We prioritize assistance to the Supreme Court, Court of Criminal 
Appeals, and the Office of the Attorney General.

The SLL’s primary responsibility is to make legal information accessible to 
all researchers. Since 2014, the Library has focused on improving statewide 
access to justice and legal information by making legal resources available 
to Texans throughout the state via our website. 

One of the most popular services we provide on our website is a growing 
collection  of  subject-specific  research  guides  called  LibGuides  that 
help patrons easily locate online resources on a specific topic. As of 
October 2022, librarians have created 67 custom LibGuides that compile 
information on commonly asked-about subjects such as landlord/tenant 
law, homeowners’ associations, family law issues, debt collection, and 
more. These guides provide direct links to digital resources and e-books 
on the selected topics, saving researchers time and frustration. 

Because  many  patrons  are  looking  for  basic  information  but  don’t 
know how to get started, the LibGuides feature has proven to be wildly 
successful due to the simplicity with which they present relevant, current, 
and helpful information. Our librarians have also developed a collection 
of answers to Legal Frequently Asked Questions that help people with 
straightforward and common questions find the information they need 
quickly. Links to these LibGuides and FAQs frequently show up in Google 
searches, making them a handy gateway to authoritative information for 
the general public. 

For more in-depth research, our website offers thousands of e-books 
and databases ranging from self-help information to detailed practice 
information for professionals, guides to legal topics, lists of resources for 
more help, and more. Public response to the library’s digital offerings has 
been enthusiastic and widespread. Since the program’s inception, over 
33,000 patrons have registered to use the service, representing over 1,200 
cities and 244 out of 254 counties across Texas.

in March of 2020. The Library’s pre-existing remote research materials and a dedicated staff enabled the library to continue 
serving the public with almost no disruption in service. As the Library has resumed service at pre-pandemic levels, the demand 
for information continues to grow steadily. The public’s increasing reliance on the library as a source for reputable information 
is a testament to quality of the services and resources offered.

A  crucial  component  to  patrons’  success  at  using  these 
databases  is  the  assistance  of  our  librarian  staff.  Our 
professional librarians are available to help patrons navigate 
our online resources as well as our print books. They provide 
expertly researched responses to patrons’ questions about the 
law in person or via phone, email, or mail. In addition, library 
staff have made several presentations about legal research and 
our remote services to legal groups, court staff, and public 
librarians  throughout  the  state,  with  a  session  for  public 
librarians at the annual Texas Library Association Conference 
planned for April.

ANNUAL REPORT of JUDICIAL AGENCIES, BOARDS and COMMISSIONSOFFICE OF STATE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY

The Office of the State Prosecuting Attorney represents the State of Texas in all proceedings before the Texas Court of Criminal 
Appeals, independently or with an elected prosecutor’s assistance. The Office may represent the State in criminal cases before 
the fourteen appeals courts when it is in the State’s interest. 

The Office’s duties are carried out by the State Prosecuting Attorney, Stacey M. Soule, and two assistant State Prosecuting 
Attorneys, John R. Messinger and Emily Johnson-Liu. 

The Office reviews all courts of appeals’ opinions decided against the State and selects issues of significant importance to Texas’ 
criminal jurisprudence to bring before the Court of Criminal Appeals by way of petition for discretionary review (PDR). Once 
granted, briefs are filed and, in exceptional cases, oral argument is presented. The Office works closely with local district and 
county attorneys and special prosecutors across the State to identify emerging issues and develop strategies to ensure that 
justice is achieved within a fair and efficient system. 

To keep judges, criminal-law practitioners, and the public abreast of PDR issues granted by the Court of Criminal Appeals, the 
Office writes and posts objective summaries on its website (www.spa.texas.gov) and Twitter feed (@OSPATX). The website also 
contains a library of our publications and CLE materials.

FY 22 Highlights

• 
• 

Filed 12 petitions for discretionary review, 20 briefs, including amicus briefs, and 6 motions for rehearing.
Reviewed approximately 300 opinions from the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeals, and Texas’ fourteen 
intermediate appeals courts.

•  Consulted and advised hundreds of prosecutors, defense attorneys, and the public.
• 
• 
• 

Assisted with drafting and editing petitions and briefs.
Authored papers and presented at several continuing legal education conferences.
Served on the State Bar of Texas Criminal Justice Section and Criminal Committee for Pattern Jury Charges.

The Office looks forward to celebrating 100 years of service to Texas in 2023.

With exclusive jurisdiction before the Texas Court 
of Criminal Appeals, the State Prosecuting Attorney 
scrutinizes all decisions adverse to the State issued 
by Texas’ fourteen courts of appeals to ensure 
their faithful adherence to the law and to identify 
significant issues requiring resolution by the Court of 
Criminal Appeals.

ANNUAL REPORT of JUDICIAL AGENCIES, BOARDS and COMMISSIONSSTATE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL CONDUCT

The State Commission on Judicial Conduct reviews and decides 
every allegation of judicial misconduct made against a Texas 
judge.

Organization
The State Commission on Judicial Conduct was created in 
1965 by an amendment to Article V of the Texas Constitution. 
The Commission is the independent judicial branch agency 
responsible for investigating allegations of judicial misconduct 
or  permanent  disability,  and  for  disciplining  judges.  The 
Commission has fourteen authorized staff positions consisting 
of: Executive Director, General Counsel, Chief Investigator, four 
staff attorneys, four investigators, a staff services officer, and 
two administrative assistants.
The Commission’s jurisdiction includes all sitting Texas judges, 
including municipal judges, justices of the peace, criminal 
magistrates,  county  judges,  county  courts-at-law  judges, 
statutory probate judges, district judges, appellate justices, 
masters, associate judges, referees, retired and former judges 
who consent to sit by assignment, and judges pro tempore. 
The Commission has no jurisdiction over federal judges and 
magistrates, administrative hearing officers for state agencies 
or  the  State  Office  of  Administrative  Hearings,  or  private 
mediators or arbitrators.

Disciplinary Actions
In FY 22, according to OCA records, 3,755 judges were under 
the jurisdiction of the Commission.
During FY 22, the SCJC:

• 
• 

Received 1,764 cases and disposed of 2,229 cases.
Resolved 84 cases through public sanction, 
private sanction, orders of additional education, a 
combination of a sanction with an order of additional 
education, special court of review order, or resignation 
in lieu of discipline agreement.

•  Dismissed 2,151 cases as follows: 1,215 were determined 
to not contain any allegations which, if true, would 
violate the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct. 936 cases 
were dismissed after investigation which included 
78 cases that were dismissed with letters of caution, 
5 cases that was dismissed based on the judges’ 
corrective action, and 6 cases that were dismissed as

Capital & Forensic Writs Essential Duties

•  Investigate and identify all facts 
necessary to present and litigate 
potential claims of constitutional 
error.

•  Gather, review, and digest all 

Since  2010,  the  Office  of 
Capital  and  Forensic  Writs 
(OCFW) has proudly served 
as  the  office  of  conviction 
integrity  for  the  State  of 
Texas, ensuring that capital 
and non-capital convictions 
are  constitutional,  reliable, 
and untainted by questionable 
forensic science.

available materials from the client’s 
capital trial, including from the trial 
defense team, the state, and the official 
court records.

•  Conduct independent investigation of 
all facts and circumstances relating 
to a client’s conviction and sentence, 
including mitigating evidence from a 
client’s life history and examining all 
forensic evidence.

•  File motions, briefing, and 

applications for writs of habeas corpus 
and litigate the constitutionality of 
a client’s conviction and sentence in 
Texas state habeas proceedings.

46

ANNUAL REPORT of JUDICIAL AGENCIES, BOARDS and COMMISSIONSOCFW does this through two programs:

•  Capital Post-conviction representation. 

and death sentences.

 o OCFW represents death-sentenced Texans in mandated proceedings that determine the constitutionality of convictions 

 o OCFW safeguards the constitutionality of death penalty convictions and sentences, and the Texas criminal justice 

system, by investigating and litigating all possible constitutional claims in post-conviction litigation in Texas courts, 
ensuring that these fundamental claims are fully aired, and Texas courts can consider them efficiently and fairly. 

• 

Forensic Science post-conviction representation. 

 o OCFW represents incarcerated Texans in cases where questionable forensic science contributed to their conviction.
The Texas Forensic Science Commission refers OCFW these cases following an investigation into professional 
 o
negligence or misconduct of forensic analysts or unsupported forensic scientific analysis or testimony.

OCFW Governance
While Court of Criminal Appeals appoints the Executive Director of OCFW, prior to the last Legislature, OCFW did not otherwise 
have an oversight board. Senate Bill 280 (87th R.S.) changed that. It established an oversight board for OCFW to ensure continued 
institutional success, independence, and good governance in alignment with Texas and national public defender standards. 
The role of the Oversight Board is to provide oversight and strategic guidance to OCFW, including recommending a candidate 
for appointment as agency head to the Court of Criminal Appeals when a vacancy exists, setting office policy, and developing 
a budget proposal. The Oversight Board has five members: three appointed by the Executive Director of the Texas Indigent 
Defense Commission; two appointed by the State Bar of Texas.

Oversight Board Members
James Bethke, Esq., Chair, Executive Director of the Bexar County Managed Assigned Counsel Program (San Antonio, TX)
Marcy Greer, Esq., Vice Chair, Managing Partner, Alexander Dubose & Jefferson (Austin, TX)
Alma Lagarda, Esq., Secretary, Capital Defense Attorney (El Paso, TX)
Hon. Terry Shamsie, Esq., Criminal Defense Attorney (Corpus Christi, TX)
Phillip Yates, Esq., Attorney at Law (Houston, TX)

Small Judicial Agency, Big Impact

•  With a staff of 12 attorneys, seven mitigation specialists, a director and two accountants, OCFW represents approximately 

70% of death-sentenced individuals in capital post-conviction proceedings. 

•  Capital and forensic writ cases are extraordinarily complex and require post-conviction and appellate specialists to 

provide this highly technical and often resource-intensive representation.

•  OCFW practices statewide, focusing narrowly on constitutional issues, forensic science, and wrongful convictions. 

OCFW’s caseload comes from counties big and small across the State of Texas. 

Essential and Economical Services

• 

• 

As a public defender, OCFW provides the State great benefits, including economies of scale, skilled and specialized 
experience, and supervised, high-quality work.
The Code of Criminal Procedure mandates the appointment of OCFW to represent death-sentenced persons in post-
conviction proceedings, if the Office can assume representation and has sufficient resources to provide professional 
representation. 

•  OCFW salaried staff are funded by the Texas Legislature. 

47

ANNUAL REPORT of JUDICIAL AGENCIES, BOARDS and COMMISSIONS•  When OCFW is unable to represent a particular client, trial courts must appoint private counsel, who are paid hourly by 

the county of conviction. 

Confronting the Covid-19 Backlog

•  Confronting the Effects of the Pandemic. During the height of the pandemic, TDCJ closed prisons to legal visitation, 

courts suspended in-person proceedings, and OCFW temporarily paused field investigation to prevent staff, clients, and 
witnesses from contracting or spreading COVID-19. While TDCJ has reopened legal visitation, it remains very limited. 
•  Making up for lost investigation and litigation time. OCFW mitigation specialists routinely spend 50% of their work week 
away from home interviewing witnesses across Texas. And, to make up for limited mitigation specialist staffing, attorneys 
have been spending substantial amounts of time conducting necessary investigation

•  COVID-19 relief funds. The Texas Legislature appropriated federal funds to enable OCFW to hire an additional mitigation 

specialist to help it confront its post-pandemic case backlog. 

•  OCFW Expects the Effects of the Pandemic to Persist. With the COVID-19 pandemic, all trials ground to a halt, leading to 
large case backlogs. Texas district courts, however, have been working hard to reduce their backlogs. OCFW anticipates 
the number of capital trials and potential death sentences—and potential new cases—to increase over the next two years.

Program Highlights

•  OCFW practices statewide, focusing narrowly on constitutional issues, forensic science, and wrongful convictions. 
•  OCFW staff includes 12 staff attorneys and 7 mitigation specialists.
•  OCFW has represented clients in over 30 Texas counties. 
• 
• 

The Texas Forensic Science Commission has referred over 60 cases involving questionable forensic science to OCFW.
Presented evidence in support of post-conviction applications in hearings before numerous trial courts and litigated 
constitutional issues before the Court of Criminal Appeals and United States Supreme Court.
