Using This Bench Book

This Bench Book is a procedural guide organized around the Sequential Intercept Model1.

This Bench Book is a procedural guide for Texas judges hearing cases regarding juveniles with mental illness and/
or IDD. Each section contains applicable statutory processes, relevant guidance, and sample forms (forms can 
also be found in an online forms bank on the JCMH website). Statutory language is simplified where possible, and 
practice notes are included in text boxes and footnotes.

The procedures discussed below are organized according to an adaptation of the widely recognized Sequential 
Intercept Model (SIM). The original SIM was developed as a “conceptual framework for communities to organize 
targeted strategies for justice-system involved individuals with behavioral health disorders.”2 For this Bench Book, 
the SIM has been modified to reflect the processes in the Texas juvenile justice system.

Appropriate  responses  at  identified  intercepts  can  prevent  entry  or  divert  children  and  adolescents  from  the 
juvenile  justice  system.  Using  the  SIM  can  help  communities  transform  fragmented  systems,  identify  local 
resources and gaps, and develop strategies for intervention. The most effective responses will engage community 
collaborators early and often.

What this Second Edition of the JCMH Juvenile Bench Book Covers

The ultimate aim of the JCMH Juvenile Bench Book is to provide guidance to the judiciary for handling issues 
pertaining  to  mental  health and  intellectual and developmental disabilities across all  intercepts and systems. 
Specifically, this Bench Book will cover:

Early Identification, Assessment, and Diversion

Fitness to Proceed

Lack of Responsibility

The first section of this Bench Book – Early Identification, Assessment, and Diversion – spans Intercepts 0 through 
3, which includes the earliest diversion points in which the juvenile justice system is involved. The second edition of 
the JCMH Juvenile Bench Book describes procedures relating to community-based services, emergency detention, 
initial  contact  with  law  enforcement,  juvenile  detention  procedures,  release  from  detention,  pre-adjudication 
diversion  programs,  fitness  to  proceed,  and  lack  of  responsibility.  Legislative  changes  from  the  86th legislative 
session (2019) and the 87th legislative session (2021) are noted throughout the book. Look for boxes with this icon: 

In the context of the juvenile justice system, the concept of equity strives to provide system responses and outcomes 
based  on  the  unique  characteristics  and  individual  rehabilitative  needs  of  each  juvenile.  Despite  differences, 
practitioners  must  endeavor  to  treat  each  child  equally  within  the  framework  of  due  process  and 
fundamental  fairness.  Throughout  this  bench  book,  you  will  find  Reflection  Points  at  critical  places  in  the 
processing  of  a  juvenile  case  where  the  consequences  of  systemic  bias  and  disproportionality  can  be 
minimized.  Although  the  Reflection  Points    are  directed  at  judges,  each  one  of  us  has  a  role  to  play  in 
identifying  and  ending  systemic  bias  in  the justice system, and we encourage all juvenile justice professionals 
to use these points for honest and thoughtful consideration in their work. Look for Reflection Points with this 
icon:

Sample forms submitted from several juvenile courts can now be found in an online forms bank on the JCMH 
website: http://texasjcmh.gov/publications/resources/. If your court would like to add forms to the online bank, 
please send them to JCMH@txcourts.gov. 

Stakeholder Input is Essential

Finally, this Bench Book represents a collaborative effort among stakeholders from across disciplines. It is a dynamic 
publication that will be regularly updated to incorporate legislative changes, provide current practice tips and other 
practical information, and highlight matters about which stakeholders disagree. If you are reading this book, you are 
a stakeholder, and we value your opinion. If you would like to provide feedback on any part of this book, please email 
us at JCMHBenchBook@txcourts.gov. Thank you for your service and for your interest in these issues.

Introduction

It is estimated that up to 70% of youth involved with the juvenile justice system3 meet the criteria for a mental 
health disorder, and many experts would argue that nearly all of the youth in the system have experienced life-
altering  trauma.  Such  statistics  reiterate  the  need  to  recognize  that  children  are  different.  Juvenile  court  was 
originally based on this principle, providing rehabilitation and protective supervision for youth.4 In the 1990s, 
tough-on-crime policies shifted the focus away from treatment.5 Recent developments in brain science have led 
experts back to treatment, training, and rehabilitation as the goals of the juvenile justice system. Advances in 
neuroscience and cognitive psychology reveal that decision-making abilities develop at different rates in youth 
and the need to carefully consider juvenile justice intervention programs.6 

Youth who have come into contact with our juvenile justice system represent an important opportunity to intervene 
before they  become a part of a repeated cycle, experiencing court  involvement  in the criminal  justice system, 
removal from home and school, civil commitment in state hospitals, and homelessness. Lack of alternatives in 
our nation leads to unnecessary arrests where individuals often languish in jail, resulting in the criminalization 
of mental illness.7 In the adult criminal justice system, national best practices urge courts to divert individuals 
with mental illness or intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) away from incarceration. Because half of 
all mental health conditions begin by age 14,8 the juvenile justice system is primed to successfully intervene and 
divert offenders away from detention to prevent this cycle.

Texas has one of the highest populations of young people,9 and according to the Meadows Mental Health Policy 
Institute10, mental illness is no small problem for children and youth. In any given 12-month period there are more 
than a half-million children and adolescents with severe emotional disturbances (SED) in Texas.11 SED includes 
mental  health  conditions,  such  as  attention  deficit  disorders,  conduct  disorders  and  depression,  along  with 
impaired ability to function at school and at home.12 It is important to note that of those 500,000 children and 
youth with SED, that over 300,000 children, youth, and adolescents with SED are living at or below 200% of the 
federal poverty level.13 Among youth with SED, 30,000 are estimated to remain in the “school to prison pipeline,” if 
nothing is done to help them.14 However, a new understanding of the neuroplasticity of the brain offers real hope 
that rehabilitation is possible.15 

The National Center for State Courts (NCSC)16 offers resources for courts to promote rehabilitation in youth by 
improving their responses to those with mental illness and IDD. The NCSC highlights the ambitious Models for

Change17 initiative to identify and develop juvenile justice reform efforts for a “more fair, rational, effective and 
developmentally sound system of justice for youth”;18 

Over the last decade the Models for Change initiative has supported a broad array of goals, including: 

•  identifying and addressing the mental health treatment needs of youth that come in contact with the 

juvenile justice system;

•  increasing the use of evidence-based assessments and treatment programs;

•  improving access to counsel and the quality of representation in delinquency proceedings; 

•  reducing racial and ethnic disparities; 

•  improving the response to dual status youth;

•  improving probation services; and

•  expanding alternatives for youth charged with status offenses.

Research supports this  multifactorial approach as a  matter of public  health to support good  mental  health  in 
children and youth. Factors such as childhood trauma, including prior abuse and neglect, stress from poverty 
or racial and ethnic disparities, and the re-traumatization that can occur from child-serving systems, must be 
considered in a child’s treatment and in their juvenile court case. The National Child Traumatic Stress Network19 
notes:

More than 80% of juvenile justice-involved youth report experiencing trauma, with many having experienced 
multiple,  chronic,  and  pervasive  interpersonal  traumas.  This  exposure  places  them  at  risk  for  emotional, 
behavioral,  developmental,  and  legal  problems.  Unresolved  posttraumatic  stress  symptoms  can  lead  to 
serious long-term consequences across the entire lifespan, such as problems with interpersonal relationships; 
cognitive  functioning; and  mental  health disorders  including  PTSD,  substance abuse, anxiety, disordered 
eating, depression, self-injury, and conduct problems—all of which can increase the likelihood of involvement 
in delinquency, crime, and the justice system. The prevalence and severity of traumatic stress reactions among 
juvenile justice-involved youth, caregivers, families, professionals, and providers, necessitates a system-wide 
response to prevent, identify, address, and minimize further traumatic stress.

Judges,  attorneys,  probation  officers,  mentors,  and  other  adults  in  a  child’s  life  can  help  create  and  promote 
resiliency – protective factors that can prevent or ameliorate the negative effects of Adverse Childhood Experiences 
(ACEs).20 Increasingly, child-serving systems, including juvenile courts and juvenile probation departments, are 
turning to Trauma-Informed Care as a framework for interactions with and responses to children and families 
who have experienced trauma.

Courts are uniquely positioned to bring together the necessary stakeholders to be agents of change for the justice 
system’s response to children and youth with mental illness or IDD. This bench book aims to provide courts the 
knowledge and tools they need to be able to look beyond the traditional lens of seeing willful kids with criminal 
behavior  to  a  more  hopeful,  proactive  approach  where  just  one  caring  adult  can  change  a  child’s  life  and  life 
chances.21

Implicit Bias (also known as unconscious bias):

Implicit  bias  refers  to  the attitudes or  stereotypes  that affect our  understanding, actions, and decisions  in an 
unconscious manner. These biases, which encompass both favorable and unfavorable assessments, are activated 
involuntarily and without an individual’s awareness or control. Residing deep in the subconscious, these biases 
are different from known biases that individuals may choose to conceal for the purposes of social and/or political 
correctness.25 

Inpatient Mental Health Facility:

Refers to a mental health facility that can provide 24-hour residential and psychiatric services and that is:

•  A facility operated by the Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC);

•  A community center, facility operated by or under contract with a community center or other entity HHSC 

designates to provide mental health services;

Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD):

IDD is a broader category than ID: it includes people with ID, DD, or both. DD are often lifelong disabilities that 
can be cognitive, physical, or both. Some Texas statutes on early identification, screening and assessment still 
do not currently address developmental disabilities, but developmental disabilities are important to consider as 
they often co-occur with mental illness and ID. Further, people with IDD are more likely than their peers without 
disabilities to be involved in the justice system, both as victims and suspects.27 

Intellectual Disability (ID):

ID  means significantly subaverage general  intellectual functioning that  is concurrent with deficits  in adaptive 
behavior and originates during the developmental period. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.001(8); Tex. Health & 
Safety Code § 591.003.

Public Health

Public Health addresses the  importance of  laying a  foundation that sets up  individuals, families, and public 
outreach systems for appropriate identification and responses to mental health and intellectual and developmental 
disabilities (IDD) issues before any justice-related system comes into play.30 Addressing mental health issues does 
not and should not begin with the justice system.31 Ideally, many people in a child’s life, including family members, 
educators, and physicians, will understand the signs of mental illness and IDD, as well as the social determinants 
of good  mental  health such as the availability of  healthy  food, safe  homes and  neighborhoods, the quality of 
relationships, and experiences with trauma or racism. While there is no guarantee that a child or adolescent with 
MI or IDD will not eventually interact with the justice system, early intervention is ideal. 32 Therefore, this Bench 
Book  includes  Public  Health as  the  first opportunity  to  intercept an  individual  from  moving  further  into  the 
system, although it might be more appropriate to think of public health flowing through each intercept.

Mental health and IDD awareness should be heightened by public outreach to individuals including children, 
families, and support systems. Awareness is intentionally broad and refers to identification as well as awareness 
of resources.

Individual  Awareness:  Identifying  signs  of  mental  illness  is  the  first  step  to  achieving  effective  responses. 
Children and adolescents seek help from a parent or guardian when they feel that it is safe and normal to ask for 
help. Children and adolescents need trusted adults to listen and to provide a warm and trusting environment. 
Avenues of awareness include teachers and other school personnel, childcare workers, after school program staff, 
coaches, pediatricians, and the media. Sesame Street’s collection of Traumatic Experiences33 and Caring for Each 
Other34 videos demonstrate that it is never too early to begin these conversations.

Mental Health Workforce Shortage

According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness-Texas (NAMI-Texas),35 three million Texans live in counties 
that have no psychiatrist. About 200 of the state’s 254 counties have a mental health workforce shortage. 
Therefore, some Texans travel long distances for care and others use telehealth services. S.B. 1636 (86th Reg. 
Sess. (2019)) requires the Health Professions Council36 to include in its annual report strategies to expand the 
health care workforce, including methods for increasing the number of health care practitioners providing 
mental and behavioral health care services.

Legislative Change

The  86th  Legislature  (2019)  passed  numerous  bills  to  increase  mental  health  awareness  and 
public outreach. Many of those bills focused on schools. According to the National Alliance on 
Mental  Illness  (NAMI),37  most  people  living  with  mental  illness  start  to  experience  symptoms 
early  in  life,  with  50%  of  all  conditions  developing  by  age  14  and  75%  by  age  24.38  Schools 
provide a unique opportunity to identify and treat mental health conditions by serving students 
where they already are.39 School personnel play an important role in identifying the early warning signs of an 
emerging mental health condition and in linking students with effective services and supports.40 

H.B. 18 added an emphasis on mental health to (1) continuing education for teachers, principals, and school 
counselors and (2) curriculum for grades K-12. The bill authorized school districts to employ or contract with 
one or more non-physician mental health professionals. In addition, the school district’s student handbook 
and website must now include certain information related to mental health, including resources available at 
each campus.

H.B. 19 allows more school staff to receive mental health first aid training41 and/or other training to increase 
awareness  and  understanding  of  mental  health  by  requiring  LMHAs/LBHAs  to  employ  a  non-physician 
mental health professional that is located at the Education Service Center to serve as a mental health training 
resource for school districts.

S.B.  11,  in  addition  to  adding  mental  health  as  a  required  curriculum  for  grades  K-12,  permits  a  school 
district to provide educational materials to all parents and families in the district, including identifying risk 
factors, accessing resources for treatment, and accessing available student accommodations provided on 
each campus. The bill also requires provision of a school safety allotment to school districts to be used to 
improve school safety and security, including costs associated with, among other things, providing mental 
health  personnel  and  support  and  behavioral  health  services.  Additionally,  S.B.  11  established  the  Texas 
Child  Mental  Health  Care  Consortium,42  which  must  create  a  network  of  child  psychiatry  access  centers 
and telemedicine/telehealth programs for identifying and assessing behavioral health needs and providing 
access to mental health care services. As an example of implementation, in Dallas, the schools use an iPad to 
connect with clinicians and make appointments for students at the children’s hospital

Family Support: Parents, guardians, and relatives are often the first to recognize signs of a child’s possible mental 
health condition. Families should be encouraged to seek out information and support from their community as 
soon as possible, as early intervention can result in a better outcome for the child. Organizations like NAMI and 
the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC)43 provide guidelines for how to talk to children about 
mental health, how to respond to a mental health crisis, and how to find available resources in the community. 

Public Outreach: Public outreach and campaigns to enhance mental health awareness enable citizens, loved 
ones, and professionals to identify and correctly respond to the need for mental health interventions before a 
crisis occurs. Two such campaigns are Okay to Say44 and Children’s Mental Health Awareness Day.45 New efforts 
are underway every day. The Federal Communications Commission recently approved 988 as a nationwide, three-
digit phone number that people can call to speak with suicide prevention and mental health counselors at the 
existing National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK).46 

Disproportionality  in  the  Juvenile  Justice  System:  Disproportionality  is  the  over-  or  underrepresentation 
of a racial or cultural group within a system at a percentage that is not proportionate to their representation in 
the general population.47 Disparity refers to the difference in outcome and conditions for some groups of people 
compared to other groups  because of unequal treatment or services.48 Youth who  identify as  Black or African 
American, Hispanic or Latino, and Indigenous are involved in the Texas juvenile justice system at disproportionate 
rates than other youth. Systemic racial and ethnic disparity in the juvenile justice system in Texas is supported 
by data contained in The State of Juvenile Probation Activity in Texas. Specifically, of the 39,185 juveniles referred 
in  2019, caucasian youth represent  30.9% of the state’s population, yet account for only  20.2% of the referrals 
to juvenile probation departments.49 In contrast, Hispanic youth comprise 50.4% of the state’s population and 
51%  of  referrals.50  African  American  youth  represent  11.4%  of  the  state’s  population  and  27.4%  of  referrals  to 
juvenile probation departments.51 This trend is reflected nationally as well: in 2018, Black youth represented 16% 
of the national youth population, but 50% of national youth arrests, while white youth represented 75% of the 
youth population and 47% of the youth arrests.52 In some respects, the juvenile justice system often serves as a 
filter for mental health issues that manifest as delinquent conduct. To that end, racial and ethnic disparities are 
dramatically compounded by the effects of behavioral and mental health disorders.

In recent years, national initiatives to identify effective evidence-based programs for addressing the mental health 
needs of justice-involved youth, such as Models for Change, have emerged. These efforts have also helped to raise 
the level of awareness in underserved populations and the need to expand the number of culturally competent 
mental health professionals in the face of the state’s changing demographics. In addition, these initiatives have 
highlighted the importance of greater reflection on the conscious and unconscious decisions of practitioners that 
impact which juveniles enter the system and the opportunities for successful rehabilitative outcomes. 

Implicit Bias. Juvenile system stakeholders are often challenged with navigating the myriad of complex factors, 
including socioeconomic status and the prevalence of mental health issues that contribute to delinquency and 
criminal conduct. Nevertheless, it is important to have a fundamental understanding of the ways in which implicit 
bias  impacts  an  individual’s  justice  system  experience  and  perceptions  of  fundamental  fairness.  Practitioners 
should be aware of the contact points in which implicit bias may play a role in how an individual is perceived and 
processed at critical points during arrest, prosecution, judicial proceedings, probation, placement, and discharge.

These processes should be individualized and examined through an equity lens. While subjective considerations 
such as implicit bias may be difficult to ascertain, one method to identify clear trends regarding disproportionality 
is by gathering data on decision-making practices. These metrics may be useful to inform local dialogue about 
ways to minimize the direct and indirect consequences of race and ethnicity at critical process points.

Cultural  Barriers  to  Treatment.  Of  the  population  receiving  mental  health  services, youth  who  identify  as 
BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) are more likely to be referred to the juvenile justice system rather 
than to mental health providers.53 Section 51.20 of the Family Code authorizes a juvenile who is alleged to have 
committed delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision (CINS) to be referred for a mental 
health examination by a physician, psychologist, psychiatrist, or other qualified professional at any stage of the 
proceedings. Juvenile justice practitioners should be mindful of the stigma of mental illness that exists in many 
communities of color and the unwillingness of many families to acknowledge or seek out treatment services for a

A National Study, 46 int’l J. of health serviCes 810, 819 (2016): “The under-provision of mental health care for minority children contrasts starkly with 
the high frequency of punitive sanctions that their behaviors elicit.  Black children suffer excessive rates of school discipline, such as suspensions 
and expulsions, starting at preschool ages.  Minority teens also have disproportionate contact with the juvenile justice system, with higher arrest 
rates for nonviolent, low-level offenses such as drug possession and for non-criminal misbehaviors such as truancy and curfew violations.”

justice-involved child. Studies suggest that youth in certain racial groups are less likely to access available mental 
health services.54 Further, systemic bias has been cited as an obstacle to treatment, even when a youth’s diagnosis 
justifies a referral for services.

Culturally-Informed Care. According to NAMI, “culture, beliefs, sexual identity, values, race, and language all 
affect how we perceive and experience mental health conditions. In fact, cultural differences can influence what 
treatments, coping mechanisms and supports work for us. It is therefore essential for culture and identity to be a 
part of the conversation as we discuss both mental health and mental health care.”55 

Youth must feel comfortable and understood by their mental health professional for a therapeutic relationship 
to be effective. This includes feeling that their mental health professional understands their identity and being 
comfortable addressing it openly. Practitioners should engage with community providers that have taken steps 
to build a diverse staff with training in cultural competency in order to meet the needs of youth and other special 
populations. 

Research shows that culturally and linguistically appropriate services improve the quality of health care.56 In 1997, 
the process for developing national standards for culturally and linguistically appropriate services (CLAS) began. 
Over time, the National CLAS Standards57 have been updated, and they are intended to advance health equity, 
improve quality, and help eliminate health care disparities by establishing a blueprint58 for health and health care 
organizations.

Death by Suicide is closely linked to mental illness, but the majority of people who have a mental illness do not 
die by suicide.59 Although suicide affects youth of all backgrounds, some groups are at higher risk than others. In 
Texas, Black high school students are 1.5 times more likely than White or Latino students to report at least one 
suicide attempt in the past year.60 Youth who identify as gay or lesbian are more than three times as likely to report 
a suicide attempt in the last year, compared to the overall reporting rate of Texas high school students. 61National 
research shows that youth in foster care are four times more likely to have attempted suicide than youth who have 
never been in care,62 and youth who are involved in the juvenile justice system have up to a four times higher rate 
of suicide than youth who are not justice system-involved.63 

Several initiatives are under way to combat this preventable tragedy. Texas Suicide Prevention Council64 developed 
both a training program, ASK About Suicide to Save a Life,65 to recognize suicide risk factors, protective factors,

warning signs, and appropriate referral strategies; and a  free suicide prevention app.66 Additionally,  the Texas 
Suicide Prevention Council created a state suicide prevention plan,67 and a toolkit for schools.68 Two important 
bills directly relating to children’s mental health and suicide prevention were passed in the 86th legislative session: 
Senate  Bill  1390, and  Senate  Bill  18.  Senate  Bill  1390  (86th  Reg.  Sess.  (2019))  promoted comprehensive suicide 
prevention strategies in school, including responding to suicide attempts or deaths by suicide in ways that help 
prevent future suicidal behaviors. Senate Bill 1390 also required state agencies to focus planning on the reduction 
of suicide rates among all Texans.  Senate  Bill  18  (86th  Reg.  Sess.  (2019)) contained  many  measures to support 
mental health in schools, notably: a requirement that every school district to create a district improvement plan 
that  includes  evidence-based  practices  for  suicide  prevention;  positive  behavior  interventions  and  support, 
including grief-informed and trauma-informed care; and required instruction for teachers on positive behavioral 
interventions for students with mental health conditions or substance use. 

Trauma-Informed  Care  is  more  than  a  trending  buzzword.  Research  shows  that  trauma  impacts  a  child’s 
development  and  health.  The  groundbreaking  Adverse  Childhood  Experiences  (ACEs)  study69  and  replicated 
studies since demonstrate that childhood stress is linked to poor health outcomes, including obesity, diabetes, 
depression, heart disease, cancer, and stroke as well as alcohol and drug abuse, low graduation rates, and poor 
employment outcomes.70 

Prevalence estimates of ACEs among children and youth in the major child-serving systems in Texas underscore the 
need for these systems to be adept at identifying, understanding, and treating trauma. Statewide, approximately 
730,000 children and adolescents, have experienced three or more ACEs.71 Nearly 90,000 children and adolescents 
under the age of 17 have been exposed to 10 or more episodes of violence,72 and among youth involved within the 
juvenile justice system in Texas, 5,900 have experienced four or more ACEs.73 

Children  and  adolescents  who  are  not  experiencing  consistent  physical  and  emotional  safety  may  develop 
behaviors and coping mechanisms that allow them to survive and function day-to-day. These learned adaptations 
make sense when a physical and/or emotional threat is pervasive but are not helpful once a person is no longer 
under such threats.74 Trauma and ACEs can result in a range of behaviors that are punishable by law, and a referral 
to juvenile court.

Knowing that children who interact with the juvenile justice system are vulnerable to trauma, our systems must 
respond to the needs of children and families through a trauma-informed lens. This requires judges, attorneys, 
court staff, and other stakeholders to understand how traumatic responses present in the children and families in 
front of the court and change courtroom practices to help families build resilience. In doing so, serving children 
and families moves beyond responding to behaviors to promoting healing. A trauma-informed juvenile justice 
system “acknowledges the prevalence and impact of trauma and attempts to create a sense of safety for all persons, 
whether or not they have experienced trauma.”75

The essential elements of a trauma-informed juvenile justice system76 are:

1. Trauma-informed policies and procedures

2. Identification and screening of youth who have been traumatized

3. Clinical assessment and intervention for trauma-impaired youth

4. Trauma-informed programming and staff education

5. Prevention and management of secondary traumatic stress

6. Trauma-informed partnering with youth and families

7. Trauma-informed cross system collaboration

8. Trauma-informed approaches to address disparities and diversity.

In 2017, the Supreme Court of Texas Permanent Judicial Commission for Children, Youth and Families77 launched 
the Statewide Collaborative on Trauma-Informed Care (SCTIC)78 to elevate trauma-informed policy and practices 
in  the  Texas  child  welfare  system  by  creating  a  statewide  strategy  to  support  system  reform,  organizational 
leadership, cross-systems collaboration, and community-led efforts with data-informed initiatives. The SCTIC 
published a report in February 2019 entitled “Building a Trauma-Informed Child Welfare System: A Blueprint.” 
79The Trauma Blueprint provides a plan for the state to advance trauma-informed care practices in the child welfare 
system but recognizes the interplay between other systems such as the juvenile justice system and suggests that 
the Blueprint can and should be used as a framework for any system.

The presence of ACEs does not mean that a child will experience poor life outcomes. Positive experiences and 
protective factors can prevent children from experiencing adversity and protect against many negative health and 
life outcomes.80 Judges have the power to lead the way in transforming the juvenile justice system into one that 
engages the children in their courtrooms, avoids re-traumatization, and supports recovery, all in the pursuit of 
increased public safety and reduced recidivism.

Reflection Point

All  assumptions  and  interactions  with  juveniles  should  be  framed  within  the  following 
considerations: adolescent brain development; trauma; and racial or ethnic bias.

Intercept 0: Community Services

Intercept 0: Community Services encompasses the early intervention points for children with mental illness or 
intellectual  or  developmental  disabilities  before  they  are  taken  into  custody  by  law  enforcement.  It  captures 
systems and services designed to connect children with treatment before a mental health crisis begins or at the 
earliest possible stage of system interaction. In Texas, these include services such as crisis hotlines, screening and 
assessment, crisis-response teams, and specially trained law enforcement. Children and adolescents are eligible 
for many of the same services and supports as adults.

An  understanding  of  complex  trauma  and  its  association  with  the  risk  of  delinquency  is  critical  to  early 
intervention.  Effective  intervention  that addresses  factors  related  to  complex  trauma  before a youth  becomes 
involved in the juvenile justice system can prevent youth from offending and entering the system.81 The effect of 
trauma is cumulative: the greater the number of traumatic events that a child experiences, the greater the risks 
to a child’s development and their emotional and physical health.82 Youth who experience complex trauma have 
been exposed to a series of traumatic events that include interpersonal abuse and violence, often perpetrated by 
those who are meant to protect them.83 This level of traumatic exposure has extremely high potential to derail a 
child’s development on a number of levels.84 Communities must work together to recognize and address mental 
illness,  intellectual  and  development  disabilities,  and  traumatic  stress,  and  to  provide  early  interventions  for 
treatment before a youth becomes entrenched in a pattern of maladaptive and problematic behavior.85 

Reflection Point

As a judge, consider building strengths-based teamwork between families and systems. Seek to 
identify existing community coalitions and organizations that will build a network of support for 
children and families in advance of justice-involvement.

1. Community-based Mental Health Services

Community-based mental health services are available for children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities, 
developmental disabilities, serious emotional disturbance, mental illnesses, and substance use disorders. As a 
judge and a community leader, it is advantageous to have a general understanding of the resources available in 
your community.86 

Reflection Point

As a judge, it is important to remember that youth who identify as BIPOC strongly benefit from 
culturally competent services at all intercept points.

1.1 

Services Provided by Local Mental Health Authorities and Local Behavioral Health 
Authorities (LMHAs/LBHAs)

LMHAs and LBHAs serve as the point of entry for publicly funded, privately funded, or unfunded mental health 
services for people who are assessed with mental illness in Texas.

General Services

LMHAs/LBHAs:

• Provide a full array of services and supports for people with mental illness.

• Are responsible for admitting eligible people with Medicaid into assessed and most appropriate level of

care based on completion of the Uniform Assessment.87

• Are responsible for admitting eligible people, when they have capacity, without Medicaid, into assessed

and most appropriate level of care based on completion of the Uniform Assessment.

• Are  responsible  for  completing  Preadmission  Screening  and  Resident  Review  (PASRR)88  Evaluations,
known as a PE, for people suspected of having a serious mental illness seeking admission to a Medicaid-
certified nursing facility.

• Provide specialized services in the most appropriate setting for the people, including the nursing facility,

who are PASRR positive and agree to receive the Mental Health Specialized Services.89

Statutorily Required Services

Each of the 39 LMHAs/LBHAs is required to provide:

• 24-hour emergency screening and rapid crisis stabilization services;90

• Community-based crisis residential services or hospitalization;

• Community-based  assessments,  including  the  development  of  interdisciplinary  treatment  plans  and

diagnosis and evaluation services;

86  HHSC has a program called 2-1-1 Texas, which helps Texas citizens connect with services.  See 211 Connecting People and Services, tex. health &

•  Medication-related services, including medication clinics, laboratory monitoring, medication education, 

mental health maintenance education, and the provision of medication; and

•  Psychosocial rehabilitation programs, including social support activities, independent living skills, and 

vocational training.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 534.053(a).

To the extent that resources are available, LMHAs/LBHAs shall:

•  Ensure that the services listed in this section are available for children, including adolescents, as well 

as adults, in each service area;

•  Emphasize early intervention services for children, including adolescents, who meet the department’s91 
definition of being at high risk of developing severe emotional disturbances or severe mental illnesses; and

•  Ensure that services listed in this section are available for defendants required to submit to mental health 

treatment under Article 17.032, 42A.104, or 42A.506, Code of Criminal Procedure.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 534.053(c).

1.2 

Crisis Services

A crisis is defined as a situation in which:

•  An individual presents an immediate danger to self or others;

•  An individual’s mental or physical health is at risk of serious deterioration; or

•  An individual believes either that:

 ◦
 ◦

they present an immediate danger to self or others; or

their mental or physical health is at risk of serious deterioration.

26 Tex. Admin. Code § 301.303(13).

The LMHA must have a crisis screening and response system in operation 24 hours a day, every day of the year, 
that is available throughout the contracted service area. 26 Tex. Admin. Code § 301.327(b).

1.2.1  What Crisis Response Services Include

Crisis response services include three services:

•  A crisis screening;

•  A crisis assessment; and

•  A recommendation about the level of care required to resolve the crisis.

An  LMHA/LBHA  ensures  immediate  screening  and,  if  recommended  based  on  the  screening,  a  face-to-face 
intake assessment of an individual found in the LMHA/LBHA’s local service area who is experiencing a crisis in 
accordance with Texas Administrative Code, Title 26, Rule 301.327 of this title, which governs access to mental 
health community services. 26 Tex. Admin. Code § 306.161(a).

LMHAs/LBHAs Conduct Crisis Response for Both MI and IDD

For persons with MI and IDD, crisis response will be conducted by the LMHA/LBHA. However, it is recommended 
that the LMHA/LBHA consult with the LIDDA. For persons with IDD who are NOT in crisis, the LIDDA will serve 
as  the  point  of  access  for  services.  In  all  but  two  Texas  counties  (Bexar  and  Dallas)  the  LMHA  and  LIDDA 
functions are performed by one local agency. See Tex. Health & Safety Code § 533.035(a).

Note:  In  Bexar  County,  the  Alamo  Area  Council  of  Government  serves  as  the  LIDDA.  In  Dallas  County, 
Metrocare serves as the LIDDA.

91  As used here, “department” refers to the Department of State Health Services (DSHS).

1.2.2  Crisis Screening and Response System

All LMHA/LBHAs have a crisis screening and response system in operation 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 
that is available to individuals throughout its contracted service delivery area.92 The telephone system to access 
the crisis screening and response system includes a toll-free crisis hotline number. The crisis hotline number is 
prominently placed on each LMHA/LBHA website and is typically the primary point of contact for a county jail 
or a juvenile detention center that does not have mental health professionals available on staff or through a local 
contract.

1.2.3  Crisis Hotline

The crisis hotline is a continuously available telephone service staffed by trained and competent QMHP-CSs who 
provide information, screening, intervention, support, and referrals to callers 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
93The hotline facilitates referrals to 911, a Mobile Crisis Outreach Team (discussed below), or other crisis services 
and conducts follow-up contacts to ensure that callers successfully accessed the referred services. If an emergency 
is not evident after further screening, the hotline includes referral to other appropriate resources within or outside 
the LMHA/LBHA local service area. The hotline works in close collaboration with local law enforcement, 211, and 
911 systems.

1.2.4  Mobile Crisis Outreach Team (MCOT)

When the crisis hotline is called, the crisis hotline staff member provides a crisis screening, and determines if 
the crisis situation requires deployment of the LMHA/LBHA MCOT. If the crisis situation is determined to be 
emergent or urgent, at least one trained MCOT member shall respond to the site of the crisis situation and conduct 
a crisis assessment. Immediately upon arrival a face-to-face screening shall be completed by at least a QMHP-
CS if a telephone screening has not been previously completed. MCOTs provide a combination of crisis services 
including emergency care, urgent care, crisis follow-up, and relapse prevention to the child, youth, or adult in the 
community.94 Some local intellectual and development disability authorities operate integrated teams to include 
staff with IDD expertise but may not always have a professional available for the crisis call.

Note:  Some counties, such as Travis  County,  have an  Expanded  Mobile  Crisis  Outreach Team  (EMCOT)  that 
collaborates  with  local  law  enforcement  or  other  first  responders  for  a  real-time  co-response  to  a  person  in 
psychiatric crisis. EMCOT connects people to treatment appropriate for psychiatric crises, diverting them from 
emergency rooms and jails. This improves health outcomes and allows first responders to return to responding to 
medical emergencies and public safety issues.95 

Crisis Alternative Programs such as Crisis Respite Facilities are located in the community and allow children 
and adolescents in behavioral health crisis to receive treatment in the most appropriate and available setting.96 
Additionally, use of these programs can minimize time spent by law enforcement officers driving to and waiting 
at hospitals and facilities, divert individuals from the criminal justice system, and reduce use of local emergency 
room  services  to  manage  behavioral  health  crises.  Contact  your  local  LMHA/LBHA  to  determine  if  a  crisis 
alternative program is available in your community.

1.2.5  What a Crisis Assessment Includes

A crisis assessment shall include an evaluation of risk of harm to self or others, presence or absence of cognitive 
signs suggesting delirium, need for immediate full crisis assessment, need for emergency intervention, and an 
evaluation of the need for an immediate medical screening/assessment by a physician (preferably a psychiatrist), 
psychiatric advanced practice nurse, physician assistant or registered nurse.97

After the crisis assessment  is conducted, the  LMHA/LBHA will  make a recommendation about the treatment 
necessary to resolve the crisis.

Communication with LMHAs/LBHAs

Open and clear communication and planning between facilities and LMHAs/LBHAs on crisis assessments and 
crisis response is encouraged.  Every second counts when a child or adolescent experiences an emergent or 
urgent mental health crisis.  Solving procedural complications before a crisis occurs will save time and avoid 
redundancy.

The LMHA/LBHA’s crisis response and response time should not change, whether the youth is in custody or not.  
MCOT staff will respond to location of the crisis to provide services, whether it is a private home or a residential 
facility.

Secure  juvenile  facilities,  such  as  juvenile  detention  centers  and  post-adjudication  facilities,  should  be  in 
ongoing communication with the LMHA/LBHA so that any part of the crisis assessment or recommendation 
for treatment needed to resolve the crisis is clear.  Ongoing communication between facilities and the LMHA/
LBHA on the local process and procedure for delivery of MCOT services is also needed.  This will naturally 
vary center to center.

1.2.6  Emergency Care Services: LMHA/LBHA Shall Respond Within One Hour

If, during a crisis screening, it is determined that an individual is experiencing a crisis that may require emergency 
care services, the QMHP-CS must:

•  Take immediate action to address the emergency situation to ensure the safety of all parties involved;

•  Activate the immediate screening and assessment processes as described in title 26, section 301.327 of the 

•  Provide or obtain  mental  health community  services or other  necessary  interventions  to  stabilize  the 

Texas Administrative Code; and

crisis.

26 Tex. Admin. Code § 301.327(d)(B).

For emergency calls, a face-to-face crisis response (or telehealth based on policies and procedures approved by 
the medical director) shall be provided within one hour.  After crisis intervention services are provided, and if 
the  individual  is still  in  need of emergency care services, then the  individual shall  be assessed  by a physician 
(preferably a psychiatrist) within 12 hours.

1.2.7  Urgent Care Services: LMHA/LBHA Shall Respond Within Eight Hours

If  the crisis screening  indicates  that an  individual  needs urgent care services, a  QMHP-CS shall, within eight 
hours of the initial incoming hotline call or notification of a potential crisis situation:

•  Provide or obtain  mental  health community  services or other  necessary  interventions  to  stabilize  the 

•  Perform a face-to-face assessment; and

crisis.

26 Tex. Admin. Code § 301.327(d)(C).

Local Mental Health Authorities/Behavioral Health Authorities

In all but two Texas counties (Bexar and Dallas), the LMHA/LBHA and LIDDA functions are united under one 
local agency.

Ongoing Non-crisis Outpatient Mental Health Services

Individuals  who  meet diagnostic-  and  need-based  requirements will  be  assigned a  level of  care  to determine 
which services they may be eligible to receive.  Section 534.53 of the Texas Health and Safety Code describes the 
required community-based mental health services:

(A) HHSC shall ensure at a minimum, the following are available in each LMHA/LBHA service area:

(1) 24-hour emergency screening and rapid crisis stabilization services;

(2) Community-based crisis residential services or hospitalization;

(3)  Community-based  assessments,  including  the  development  of  interdisciplinary  treatment  plans 

and diagnosis and evaluation services;

(4)  Medication-related  services,  including  medication  clinics,  laboratory  monitoring,  medication 

education, mental health maintenance training, and the provision of medication; and

(5)  Psychosocial rehabilitation programs, including social support activities, independent living skills, 

and vocational training.

(B)  HHSC shall arrange for appropriate community-based services to be available in each service area for 

each person discharged from a department facility who is in need of care.

(C) To the extent that resources are available, HHSC shall:

(1)  Ensure that the services listed in this section are available for children, including adolescents, 

as well as adults, in each service area;

(2)  Emphasize  early  intervention  services  for  children,  including  adolescents,  who  meet  the 
department’s definition of being at high risk of developing severe emotional disturbances or severe 
mental illnesses; and

(3)  Ensure that services listed in this section are available for defendants required to submit to mental 
health treatment under articles 17.032 or 42A.104 or 42A.506 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 534.053.

Eligibility for ongoing outpatient mental health treatment is a diagnosis- and need-based determination governed 
by  the  state  and  federal  requirements  and  the  HHSC  performance  contract  with  LMHAs/LBHAs  and  section 
534.053 of the Texas Health and Safety Code.

The  child  and  adolescent  mental  health  priority  population  are  children  ages  3  –  17  with  serious  emotional 
disturbance (excluding a single diagnosis of substance abuse, intellectual or developmental disability, or autism

spectrum disorder) who have a serious functional impairment or who are at risk of disruption of a preferred living 
or childcare environment due to psychiatric symptoms, or are enrolled in special education because of a serious 
emotional disturbance.

YES Waiver

The Youth Empowerment Services Waiver (YES Waiver) is a 1915(c) Medicaid program that partners with families 
and  the community  to ensure qualifying  Texas youth ages  3  through  18 who  have  serious  mental, emotional, 
and  behavioral  difficulties,  have  access  to  a  wide  range  of  community-based  services  and  supports.    The  YES 
Waiver provides intensive services delivered within a strengths-based team planning process called Wraparound.  
YES services are family-centered, coordinated, and effective at preventing out-of-home placement.  The average 
length of time in the YES Waiver is 11 – 18 months, however, each youth’s needs will determine duration of care.  
Individuals must contact their LMHA/LBHA to be added to the YES Waiver inquiry list.  Only a parent, guardian, 
or managing conservator may request a youth be added to the inquiry list and assessed for the YES Waiver, unless 
the youth is 16 years of age or older.   For more information about YES Waiver, see https://hhs.texas.gov/services/
mental-health-substance-use/childrens-mental-health/yes-waiver

Residential Treatment Center Relinquishment Avoidance Project (RTC Project)

The Residential Treatment Center Relinquishment Avoidance Project (RTC Project) is a collaborative effort between 
the  Department  of  Family  and  Protective  Services  (DFPS)  and  the  Health  and  Human  Services  Commission 
(HHSC).  The RTC Project provides support for families in crisis who are at risk of parental custody relinquishment 
to the child welfare system because they are unable to access the intensive mental health care necessary for their 
child to remain at home.  Through the RTC Project, families are matched with state-funded residential placement 
for their child while maintaining full custody and rights as a parent or guardian.  Families interested in receiving 
support through the RTC Project must contact the Department of Family Protective Services at 1-800-252-5400 or 
www.txabusehotline.org.  Parents should mention that they are trying to access mental health resources through 
DFPS or refer to the “Mental Health Support Protocol.”98 

Community Resource Coordination Groups (CRCGs)

CRCGs are groups of individuals from state agencies and community organizations who collaborate to provide 
recommendations  for  a  unique  combination  of  services  that  one  agency,  alone,  cannot  provide.    CRCGs  are 
available across Texas and serve children, adolescents, and adults with multiple service needs.  To find a CRCG in 
your area, call 512-206-4658, or search online at: https://crcg.hhs.texas.gov/find-resources-near-me.html

98  The mental health support protocol is not a document but language that DFPS intake uses statewide to properly route calls from families seek-
ing access to mental health treatment, and specifically, access to the RTC Project.

Texas System of Care

The National Child Traumatic Stress Network noted the common frustration that “Mental health services and 
IDD-focused services have traditionally been provided through separate and parallel systems of care, rather 
than a collaborative service delivery plan involving shared recognition, accountability, and decision-making.  
The lack of intersystem planning and coordination has resulted in obstacles to mental health and trauma-
informed care, within both the mental health and IDD sectors.

 ■ In the mental health system, there may be reluctance to treat youth with IDD such as Intellectual 
disability or Autism Spectrum Disorder; this likely stems from both the providers’ lack of knowledge 
that  youth  with  IDD  can  benefit  from  trauma  treatment,  and  the  providers’  lack  of  expertise  in 
implementing the appropriate care.

 ■ In the IDD field, the tendency is to rely on behavior management instead of approaches that would 

better help youth process and recover from traumatic experiences.

 ■ In the trauma field, providers often lack familiarity or experience working with youth with IDD.

Overcoming these obstacles within each sector requires greater understanding of the trauma-related needs 
of youth with IDD.  Across sectors, there is equally pressing need for improved communication, collaboration, 
and sharing of resources by providers and systems.”99 

One solution for preventing the “siloing” – or isolation – of planning, coordination, and services is through 
System of Care.

Texas System of Care is not a specific program for delivering services, but rather a “spectrum of effective 
community-based services and supports for children, youth, and young adults with or at risk for mental health 
and related challenges and their families that is organized into a coordinated network, builds meaningful 
partnerships with families and youth, and addresses their cultural and linguistic needs in order to help them 
function better at home, in school, in the community, and throughout life.”100   

The system of care framework, which was established over 25 years ago and is already working in urban and 
rural communities across the state, builds on existing community assets to improve access to mental health 
services,  expands  access  to  wraparound  services  like  Yes  Waiver,  assists  emerging  adults  with  transition 
planning, provides training in core values and best practices such as Trauma Informed Care, and includes 
family and youth voices in decision making.101 

Most impressively, the system of care approach works: it has been shown to result in increases in school 
attendance by 18%; decreases in unlawful activities by 48%; and decreases in suicide attempts by 81%.102

2.  Community-based IDD Services 

2.1 

How Individuals with IDD Receive Services and Supports

2.1.1  How Programs are Funded

Medicaid Waivers are federal funds that help provide services to people who would otherwise be in an institution, 
nursing home, or hospital to receive long-term care in the community.

General Revenue (GR) Funded Services are state funds from the GR that are primarily intended to help people 
remain in their own or their family’s homes.  Not all GR funded services are available in all areas of the state.  GR 
services are provided by or directly through a LIDDA.

2.1.2  Waiver Services

Waiver services for individuals, including children, include the following:

•  Home and Community-based Services (HCS) is a Medicaid waiver program approved by Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) pursuant to section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act.  It provides 
community-based services and supports to eligible individuals as an alternative to an intermediate care 
facility for individuals with an intellectual disability or related condition.  The HCS Program is operated 
by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC), formerly the Department of Aging and 
Disability Services.  40 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 9.153(36), 9.154(a).

•  Texas Home Living (TxHmL) supplies essential services and supports to Texans with ID or a related 

condition so that they can continue to live in the community.

•  Community Living Assistance and Support Services (CLASS) provides home- and community-based 
services to people with related conditions as a cost-effective alternative to placement in Intermediate Care 
Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/IID).

•  Deaf-blind with Multiple Disabilities focuses on increasing opportunities for people who are deaf-
blind with multiple disabilities to communicate and interact with their environment, providing a cost-
effective alternative to institutional placement.

2.1.3  State Plan Services

Community First Choice (CFC) is a state plan option that allows states to provide home- and community-based 
attendant services and supports to eligible Medicaid enrollees under their state plan.

2.2  Where Services are Provided

•  Person’s own home or family home

•  Community-based residential home

•  Schools

•  Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with an ID or Related Condition (ICF/IID)

•  State Supported Living Centers (SSLCs)

2.3 
 

Local Intellectual and Developmental Disability Authorities (LIDDAs) Serve Individuals  
with IDD

 

2.3.1  The Role of LIDDAs

A LIDDA’s role is to serve as the single point of access to certain publicly-funded services and supports for the 
residents within the LIDDA’s local service area.  A LIDDA’s responsibilities include:

•  Providing information about services and supports;

•  Ensuring an individual’s access to services and supports by:

 ◦ Conducting intake and eligibility activities for an individual seeking services and supports; and
 ◦ Enrolling or assisting an eligible individual to access long-term services and supports or GR revenue 

services;

 ◦ Developing and managing a network of general revenue services providers; and
 ◦ Establishing processes to monitor the performance of general revenue services providers

•  Conducting service coordination for individuals in HCS, TxHmL, and GR;

•  Conducting  planning  for  the  local  service  area,  including  ensuring  involvement  by  a  local  advisory 

committee and other stakeholders;

•  Conducting permanency planning for certain individuals under 22 years of age; and

•  Protecting the rights of an individual.

Local Intellectual and Developmental Disability Authorities

In all but two Texas counties (Bexar and Dallas), the LMHA and LIDDA functions are united under one local 
agency.  A list of these agencies can be found on pages 27, 28, 29, and 30.  Stand-alone LIDDAs are:

2.3.2  Types of Services Offered or Contracted

Screening is performed face-to-face or by telephone contact with persons to determine a need for services.

Eligibility determination includes an interview and assessment, or an endorsement conducted in accordance 
with Texas Health and Safety Code section 593.005, and 40 Texas Administrative Code chapter 5, subchapter D to 
determine if a person has an intellectual disability or is a member of the IDD priority population.

Service coordination helps people access medical, social, educational, and other services and supports that will 
help them achieve an acceptable quality of life and community participation.

Community supports are individualized activities that are provided in the person’s home and at community 
locations, such as libraries and stores.  Supports may include:

•  Habilitation and support activities that foster improvement of, or facilitate, the person’s ability to perform 

daily living activities;

placement of the person;

site; and

activities.

•  Activities  for  the  person’s  family  that  help  preserve  the  family  unit  and  prevent  or  limit  out-of-home 

•  Transportation for the person between home and their community employment site or day habilitation 

•  Transportation  to  facilitate  the  person’s  employment  opportunities  and  participation  in  community 

Permanency Planning is required by the LIDDA for persons under age 22 who reside in an ICF/IID, an HCS 
residential group home, or nursing facility.

Respite is either planned or emergency short-term relief provided by trained staff to the person’s unpaid caregiver

when the caregiver is temporarily unavailable.  If enrolled in other services, the person continues to receive those 
services as needed during the respite period.

Crisis respite provides short-term respite for persons with IDD:

•  Out-of-home crisis respite provides on-site therapeutic support and 24-hour supervision; and

•  In-home  crisis  respite  provides  therapeutic  support  in  a  less  restrictive  setting  for  crises  that  can  be 

resolved within a 72-hour period.

Employment assistance helps people locate paid jobs, and includes helping them:

•  Identify employment preferences, skills, and work requirements and conditions; and

•  Identify prospective employers who offer appropriate employment.

Supported employment is provided to a person who has paid employment to help them sustain that employment.  
It includes individualized support services, supervision, and training.

Nursing is provided to people who require treatment and monitoring of health care procedures that are prescribed 
by a physician or medical practitioner or that are required by standards of professional practice or state law to be 
performed by licensed nursing personnel.

Behavioral supports are specialized interventions to help people increase adaptive behaviors and to replace or 
modify maladaptive behaviors that prevent or interfere with their inclusion in home and family life or community 
life.  Supports include:

•  Assessing  and  analyzing  assessments  findings  so  that  an  appropriate  behavior  support  plan  can  be 

designed;

person-directed plan;

•  Developing  an  individualized  behavior  support  plan  consistent  with  the  outcomes  identified  in  the 

•  Training and consulting with family members or other providers and, as appropriate, with the person; and

•  Monitoring and evaluating the success of the behavior support plan and modifying it as necessary.

Crisis Intervention Specialists provide information about IDD programs and services to persons with IDD and 
their families, and to IDD providers in the local service area.  LIDDAs are provided funds to support persons with 
IDD who experience significant behavioral and psychiatric challenges.  These persons often exhibit significant 
needs requiring additional support beyond the array of services typically provided within community programs.

Specialized therapies include assessment and treatment by licensed or certified professionals for social work 
services,  counseling  services,  occupational  therapy,  physical  therapy,  speech  and  language  therapy,  audiology 
services,  dietary  services,  and  behavioral  health  services  other  than  those  provided  by  an  LMHA,  as  well  as 
training and consulting with family members or other providers.

Vocational training is a service provided to people in industrial enclaves, work crews, sheltered workshops or 
affirmative industry settings to help them get a job.

Day habilitation is assistance with getting, keeping, or improving self-help, socialization, and adaptive skills 
necessary to live successfully in the community and to participate in home and community life.  Day habilitation is 
normally provided regularly in a group setting (not in the person’s residence) and includes personal assistance for 
those who cannot manage their personal care needs during day habilitation and need assistance with medications 
and performing tasks delegated by a registered nurse.104 

Medicaid Program Enrollment:  LIDDAs are responsible for enrolling eligible  individuals  into the following 
Medicaid programs:

•  Intermediate  Care  Facilities for  Individuals with  Intellectual  Disabilities  (a  24-hour residential setting 

including state-supported living centers);

104  See 40 Tex. Admin. Code § 9.555(a)(2).

•  Home and Community-based Services (HCS);105  and
•  Texas Home Living.106 

Transition Support Teams (TST) were originally developed to assist people in the transition from an institutional 
setting (e.g., SSLCs and nursing facilities) into a community setting, but these TSTs have since expanded their 
reach.  Because individuals with complex needs often require more experienced staff, HHSC has contracted with 
eight LIDDAs across Texas to provide support to other LIDDAs and community waiver providers in designated 
service areas.

The eight contracted LIDDAs have teams that offer educational activities, technical assistance, and case review.  
The teams have licensed medical staff such as physicians, registered nurses, psychiatrists, and psychologists with 
experience working with people with IDD.

These programs are currently funded through the Money Follows the Person (MFP) Grant, which is distributed 
by CMS to Texas and passed on to the LIDDAs.  Because MFP rebalancing funds are evaluated yearly, uncertainty 
of ongoing funding affects the existence of the TST Program.  LIDDAs are aware that funding is subject to change 
based on guidance from CMS which impacts whether or not the TST program is an available resource.

Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) is a program administered by HHSC that assists families in helping their 
children under age 3 with disabilities and developmental delays to reach their full potential.  If eligible, the family 
and a team create an Individualized Family Service Plan to identify the child’s strengths and needs and prioritize 
services.  Most services are provided at home but can be provided at day care or other community settings.  ECI 
program locations can be found here: https://citysearch.hhsc.state.tx.us/

2.4 

Housing through the HCS Program

The  HCS  Program  can  be  an  important  diversionary  program  because  it  can  provide  housing  to  prevent  an 
individual’s admission  to  institutional services.    Providers offering services under  the  HCS program  maintain 
three- to four-bed group homes where individuals reside.  When residing in an HCS group home, individuals are 
entitled to many services, including:

•  Supervised and supported home living 24 hours a day, seven days a week;

•  Direct personal assistance with activities of daily living (grooming, eating, bathing, dressing, and personal 

hygiene);

•  Assistance with meal planning and preparation;

placement  on  the  interest  list.    Further,  funding  each  individual  placement  depends  on  the  outcome  of  the 
HHSC’s Legislative Appropriations Request (LAR) where HHSC outlines its funding requirements and/or needs 
for the upcoming biennium.

An alternate route to enter into the HCS program is available through a crisis diversion slot.  A person may qualify 
for a crisis diversion slot if:

•  The person is at imminent risk of admission to an institution;

•  The person is not being court-committed to a facility for competency evaluation, such as an SSLC or state 

hospital;

•  Adequate and appropriate community resources are not available, as evidenced by attempts to locate and 
use community-based services and supports, such as ICF/IID, GR funded services, CFC services, Crisis 
Intervention Services, other Medicaid waiver programs, or support through the local school district and

•  The person meets the criteria for a Level of Care I.

 ◦ An LOC I requires either a diagnosis of ID or a related condition (RC).  Along with the diagnosis of 
an RC, the person’s IQ score must be 75 or below.  For the specific requirements for LOC I, see 40 Tex. 
Admin. Code § 9.238.

3.  Civil Mental Health Law: The Texas Mental Health Code

The statutes that govern the provision of mental health treatment are found in Chapters 571 – 578 of the Texas 
Health and Safety Code, commonly referred to as the “Texas Mental Health Code.”  These substantive provisions 
and procedures apply to all public and private facilities operating in the state of Texas.  It is important to remember 
that the purpose of the Mental Health Code is to provide persons with severe mental illness107  access to humane 
care and treatment in the least restrictive appropriate setting while also protecting their fundamental rights.  Tex. 
Health & Safety Code § 571.002.

A child 16 years of age or older may decide voluntarily to request mental health treatment.  Tex. Health & Safety 
Code  §  572.001(a).    Chapter  572  of  the  Texas  Mental  Health  Code  addresses  the  requirements  for  voluntary 
admission  to  mental  health  treatment.    Voluntary  admission  does  not  involve  the  court,  except  when  the 
involuntary  commitment  process  is  initiated  because  a  voluntary  patient,  parent,  managing  conservator,  or 
guardian of a person younger than 18 years of age requests discharge and a treating physician determines that the 
person poses a risk of serious harm to self or others unless continued treatment is provided.  Tex. Health & Safety 
Code § 572.004.

Generally, a child under the age of 18, including a child who is in the managing conservatorship of the Department 
of Family and Protective Services, may not be involuntarily committed unless provided by Chapter 572 of the 
Texas Health and Safety Code, Chapter 55 of the Texas Family Code, or department rule.  Tex. Health & Safety 
Code §§ 572.001(c-1); 572.0025(f-3).  Chapter 55 proceedings are discussed in Intercept 3: Courts, on page 81.

3.1 

Voluntary Mental Health Services

Children under the age of 16 generally do not have the right to consent to medical or mental health treatment.  
However, children can consent to counseling for suicide prevention, chemical addiction or dependency, or sexual, 
physical, or emotional abuse.  Tex. Fam. Code § 32.004(a).

3.1.1a  Parental Consent

Before  a  child  can  receive  medical  or  mental  health  treatment,  consent  is  required.    Parents  have  both  the 
duty to provide a child with medical care, and the right to consent to the child’s medical care and psychiatric 

107  See Persons with Intellectual Disabilities Act, 7 Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. Ch.§§ 591.001 – 597.054 (Vernon 2019) (containing the provisions 
related to persons with ID).

and psychological treatment.  Tex. Fam. Code § 151.001(a).  Most children who receive inpatient or outpatient 
treatment for a mental illness do so only after their parent consents to the treatment. 

3.1.1b  Non-Parental Consent

Some children may not have a parent available to consent to mental health treatment for them.  The Texas Family 
Code provides several remedies for non-parent caregivers to consent to treatment for a child.

Written Authorization under Texas Family Code Chapter 32:

The “written authorization” in Texas Family Code Chapter 32 can be a simple consent form and is a good option 
for caregivers who may need to make a one-time medical decision for a child.  

•  If the child’s parent is not available to give consent, the following persons may consent to treatment:

 ◦
the child’s grandparent, adult sibling, or adult aunt or uncle.  Tex. Fam. Code § 32.001(a)(1), (2) and (3).  
 ◦ an adult who has care, control, and possession of the child and has written authorization to consent 

from the parent.  Tex. Fam. Code § 32.001(a)(5).

 ◦ an education institution in which the child is enrolled and has written authorization to consent from 

the parent.  Tex. Fam. Code § 32.001(a)(4).

 ◦ a court having jurisdiction over a suit affecting the parent-child relationship of which the child is the 

subject.  Tex. Fam. Code § 32.001(a)(6).

 ◦ an adult responsible for the actual care, control, and possession of a child under the jurisdiction of 
a juvenile court or committed by a juvenile court to the care of an agency of the state or county.  Tex. 
Fam. Code § 32.001(a)(7).

 ◦ a peace officer who has lawfully taken custody of a minor, if the peace officer has reasonable grounds to 

believe the minor is in need of immediate medical treatment.  Tex. Fam. Code § 32.001(a)(8).

Authorization Agreement for Nonparent Adult Caregiver

The authorization agreement in Texas Family Code Chapter 34 is a good option for parents who anticipate being 
unavailable for an ongoing period of time, and wish to designate an adult caregiver to make medical and other 
caregiving decisions for their child during their absence.  The requirements for an authorization agreement are 
more detailed than those for a written authorization.

•  One  or  both  parents  of  a  child  can  enter  into  a  written  “authorization  agreement”  with  an  adult 
caregiver that authorizes the caregiver to  make certain decisions for the child,  including  medical care 
decisions.  Tex. Fam. Code § 34.002(a).

•  The agreement must contain a statement that the adult caregiver has been given authorization to make 
certain decisions for the child as a result of voluntary action of the parent and that the adult caregiver has 
voluntarily assumed the responsibility of making those decisions.  Tex. Fam. Code § 34.003(a)(4).

•  The agreement must also contain a statement by the parent as to the duration of the authorization, which 
can be for six months, with automatic renewals every six months until termination; or for less than six 
months, with a specific date of termination. Tex. Fam. Code § 34.003(a)(10)(A).

•  The agreement must identify the circumstances under which the agreement can be terminated before 
the termination date or continued beyond the term of the agreement. Tex. Fam. Code § 34.003(a)(10)(B).

•  The agreement must contain a specific series of legal warnings and disclosures. Tex. Fam. Code § 34.003(b).

•  The  agreement  must  be  signed  and  sworn  to  before  a  notary  public  by  the  parent  and  the  caregiver.   

Tex. Fam. Code § 34.004(a).

Temporary Authorization for Care of Minor Child

If no parent is available or willing to sign an authorization agreement, adult caregivers can petition the court 
for temporary authorization for care of the child.  A caregiver is only able to seek temporary authorization if the 
child has lived with the caregiver for at least 30 days prior to the filing of the petition, and if the caregiver does not 
have an authorization agreement available under Texas Family Code Chapter 34, or other signed documentation

from the child’s parent, guardian, or conservator that enables the caregiver to make decisions for the child.  Tex. 
Fam. Code § 35.002.

•  The petition must state any reason that the caregiver is unable to obtain signed, written documentation 

from the child’s parent, conservator, or guardian.  Tex. Fam. Code § 35.003(a)(8).

•  The petition must contain a description of the service or action that the caregiver is unable to take without 
court authorization, a statement of any reason supporting the request, and a statement of the time period 
of the authorization.  Tex. Fam. Code §§ 35.003(a)(7), (9), and (10).

•  The court must hold a hearing and can hear evidence relating to the child’s need for care, any other matter 
raised in the petition, and any objection or testimony of the child’s parent, conservator, or guardian.  Tex. 
Fam. Code § 34.005(a).

•  If  an  objection  is  made  by  the  child’s  parent,  conservator,  or  guardian,  the  court  must  dismiss  the 

petition.  Tex. Fam. Code § 34.005(b).

•  The court must grant the petition if it finds:

It is necessary to the child’s welfare and no objection is made;

 ◦
 ◦ By a preponderance of the evidence that the child does not have a parent, conservator, guardian, or 

other legal representative available to give the necessary consent.

 

Tex. Fam. Code § 35.005(b), (c).

•  The temporary authorization expires after one year, or at an earlier date set by the court.  The temporary 
authorization can be renewed by court order for up to one year, upon a showing of continued need.  Tex. 
Fam. Code §§ 35.005(d), 35.006(a).

•  At any time, the child’s parent, conservator, or guardian can request that the court terminate the order.  The 
order must be terminated upon a finding that there is no longer a need for it.  Tex. Fam. Code § 35.006(b).

Legislative Change

S.B. 1238 (86th Reg. Sess. (2019)) created Texas Family Code Chapter 35A, which allows certain 
family members to seek a court order for temporary authorization to consent to voluntary 
inpatient mental health services for a child.  

 ■ A caregiver is able to seek temporary authorization for inpatient mental health services if the child 
has lived with the caregiver for at least six months prior to the filing of the petition.  Tex. Fam. Code 
§ 35A.001.

 ■ The petition must include a certificate of medical examination for mental illness prepared by a 
physician who has examined the child in the 3 days before the petition was filed, and be accompanied 
by a sworn statement containing the physician’s opinion, and the detailed reasons for that opinion, 
that the child is a person:

 — With mental illness or who demonstrates symptoms of a serious emotional disorder;

 —  Who presents a risk of serious harm to self or others if not immediately restrained or hospitalized.…  

Tex. Fam. Code § 35A.003(7).

 ■ The  petition  must  also  state  any  reason  that  the  caregiver  is  unable  to  obtain  signed,  written 
documentation from a parent, conservator, or guardian of the child.  Tex. Fam. Code § 35A.003(8).

 ■ The court must hold a hearing, and can hear evidence relating to the child’s need for inpatient mental 
health services, any other matter raised in the petition, and any objection or testimony by the child’s 
parent, conservator, or guardian.  Tex. Fam. Code § 35A.005(a).

 ■  The court must grant the petition only if the court finds:

1.  By a preponderance of the evidence that the child does not have available a parent, conservator, 
guardian, or other legal representative to give consent under Section 572.001, Health and Safety 
Code, for voluntary inpatient mental health services; and

2.  By clear and convincing evidence that the child is a person:

A.  With mental illness or who demonstrates symptoms of a serious emotional disorder; and

B.    Who  presents  a  risk  of  serious  harm  to  self  or  others  if  not  immediately  restrained  or 
hospitalized.

Tex. Fam. Code § 35A.005(c).

 ■ The court must dismiss the petition if an objection is made by the child’s parent, conservator, or 

guardian.  Tex. Fam. Code § 35A.005(b).

 ■ The order expires on the date the caregiver requests that the child be discharged from the inpatient 
mental  health  facility;  the  date  a  physician  determines  that  the  criteria  listed  in  Subsection  (c)(2) 
no longer apply to the child; or the 10th day after the order for temporary authorization is issued, 
whichever is earliest.  Tex. Fam. Code § 35A.005(d).

 ■ If  the  caregiver  obtains  an  order  for  temporary  managing  conservatorship  before  the  order  for 
temporary authorization expires, then the order for temporary authorization remains in effect until 
the caregiver requests that the child be discharged, or a physician determines that the criteria listed 
in Subsection (c)(2) no longer apply, whichever is earlier.  Tex. Fam. Code § 35A.005(e).

3.1.1c  Consent for Children in Foster Care

 

Children in Foster Care and Consent to Medical Care

Every  child  in  DFPS  conservatorship  is  required  to  have  a  medical  consenter.    The  responsibility  of  the 
medical consenter is to provide medical consent – that is, decisions on whether or not to agree to a medical 
test, treatment, procedure, or a prescription medication.  

Informed consent means the medical consenter gets complete information about the proposed medical 
care before making a decision.  The goal is to ensure that the medical consenter makes an informed decision 
about the child’s physical and mental health care.  When permission is given for health care, the medical 
consenter must understand the child’s symptoms and diagnosis, how the treatment will help the condition, 
what  could  happen  without  the  treatment,  and  the  risks  and  side  effects  associated  with  the  treatment.  
Medical consenters must complete approved training.  Tex. Fam. Code § 266.004(h-1). 

The  court  with  continuing  jurisdiction  over  the  child  will  authorize  an  individual,  or  DFPS,  as  the  medical 
consenter, on its own motion or during a hearing under Texas Family Code Chapter 263.  The individual may 
be the child’s foster parent, the child’s parent (if the parent’s rights have not been terminated and the court 
determines it is in the best interest of the child), a relative, or an adult involved in the child’s life.  Tex. Fam 
Code § 266.004(b).

If the court authorizes DFPS to consent to medical care for the child, DFPS can designate up to four primary 
and backup medical consenters.  DFPS can designate the child’s foster parents, relatives, caseworker, other 
CPS staff member, or the child’s parent, if the parent’s rights have not been terminated and it is in the child’s 
best interest.  Tex. Fam. Code § 266.004(c).

The court may also determine that a foster child who is at least 16 years old has the capacity to consent 
to medical care.  Tex. Fam. Code § 266.010(a).  Attorneys ad litem and DFPS staff are required to inform 16- 
and 17-year-old children in foster care of their right to ask the court whether they can consent to their own 
medical care.  Tex. Fam. Code §§ 107.003(b)(3), 266.010(l).

If a child’s healthcare decision puts the child at risk of harm, the court can overrule the child’s decision to 
refuse medical care.  See Tex. Fam. Code §§ 266.010(d-i).

Emergency medical care: No consent or court authorization is needed during an emergency in which it is 
“immediately necessary to provide medical care to the foster child to prevent the imminent probability of 
death or substantial bodily harm to the child or others…”  Tex. Fam. Code § 266.009(a).

3.1.2  Request for Admission

•  A person 16 years of age or older may request admission to an inpatient mental health facility or for 
outpatient mental health services by filing a request with the administrator of the facility where admission 
or outpatient treatment is requested.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.001(a).
 ◦ The administrator of an inpatient or outpatient mental health facility may admit a minor who is 16 
years of age or older to an inpatient or outpatient mental health facility as a voluntary patient without 
the consent of the parent, managing conservator, or guardian.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.001(d).

•  A parent, managing conservator, or guardian of a person younger than 18 years of age may request 
the admission of the person to an inpatient mental health facility or for outpatient mental health services 
by  filing  a  request  with  the  administrator  of  the  facility  where  admission  or  outpatient  treatment  is 
requested.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.001(a).
 ◦ An inpatient mental health facility may admit or provide services to a person 16 years of age or older 
and younger than 18 years of age if the person’s parent, managing conservator, or guardian consents to 
the admission or services, even if the person does not consent to the admission or services.  Tex. Health 
& Safety Code § 572.001(a-2).

•  A person eligible to consent to treatment for the person under section 32.001(a)(1), (2), or (3), Family 
Code, may request temporary authorization for the admission of the person to an inpatient mental health 
facility by petitioning under Chapter 35A, Family Code, in the district court in the county in which the 
person resides for an order for temporary authorization to consent to voluntary mental health services 
under this section.
 ◦ The petitioner may be represented by the county attorney or the district attorney.  Tex. Health & Safety 

Code § 572.001(a-1).

•  A  person  or  agency  appointed  as  the  guardian  or  a  managing  conservator  of  as  person younger 
than 18 years of age and acting as an employee or agent of the state may request admission of the person 
younger than 18 years of age only with the person’s consent.  If the person does not consent, the person 
may be admitted for inpatient services only pursuant to an application for court-ordered mental health 
services or emergency detention or an order for protective custody.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.001(c).

•  A  child  in  DFPS  conservatorship  can  only  be  admitted  to  an  inpatient  mental  health  facility  if  a 

physician states their opinion and detailed reasons for the opinion, that the child is a person: 
 ◦ with mental illness or who demonstrates symptoms of a serious emotional disorder; and
 ◦ who presents a risk of serious harm to self or others if not immediately restrained or hospitalized.
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.001(c-1).

•  An admission request must be in writing and signed by the person requesting the admission.  Tex. Health 

& Safety Code § 572.001(b).

•  A request for admission as a voluntary patient must state that the person for whom admission is requested 
agrees to voluntarily remain in the facility until the person’s discharge and that person consents to the 
diagnosis, observation, care, and treatment provided until the earlier of:
 ◦ The person’s discharge; or
 ◦ The period described by section 572.004.
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.001(e).

3.1.3  Admission

After the person requests admission to a facility, the facility may admit the person if the facility determines:

•  That the person has symptoms of mental illness and will benefit from the inpatient or outpatient services 

after conducting a preliminary exam;

•  That the person has been informed of the person’s rights as a voluntary patient; and

•  That the admission was voluntarily agreed to by said person, if they are 16 or older; or, if they are younger 

than 18 years of age, by their parent, managing conservator, or guardian.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.002.

3.1.4 

Information on Medications

•  A mental health facility must provide a patient with information about the patient’s medication ordered 
by a treating physician.  The information must, if possible, be in the patient’s own language.  Tex. Health 
& Safety Code § 572.0022(a).

•  A facility must also provide the information to the patient’s family if they request it, but only if it does not 

violate state and federal privacy laws.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.0022(b).

3.1.5 

Intake, Assessment, and Admission

•  HHSC  has  promulgated  administrative  regulations  that  establish  rules  regarding  the  intake  and 
assessment process that takes place prior to a formal admission of the patient to an  inpatient facility.  
These rules govern a patient’s consent to treatment as well as ensure the patient’s understanding of the 
financial commitments such treatment will entail.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.0025.

•  The three following terms are defined in a way that is unique to this section.  An “admission” means the 

formal acceptance of a prospective patient to a facility.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.0025(h)(1).

•   An “assessment” means the administrative process a facility uses to gather information from a prospective 
patient to determine whether a prospective patient should be examined by a physician to determine if 
admission  is clinically  justified.   This term does  not refer to the examination that  must  be performed 
within 72 hours before or 24 hours after a patient or prospective patient is admitted to the facility.  Tex. 
Health & Safety Code §§ 572.0025(g), (f); 572.0025(h)(2).

•   “Intake”  means  the  administrative  process  for  gathering  information  about  a  prospective  patient  and 
giving a prospective patient information about the facility and treatment services.  Tex. Health & Safety 
Code § 572.0025(h)(3).

•   The rules governing the intake process shall establish minimum standards for:

 ◦ Reviewing a prospective patient’s finances and insurance benefits;
 ◦
 ◦

Explaining to a prospective patient the patient’s rights;
 

 
Explaining to a prospective patient the facility’s services and treatment process.  Tex. Health & Safety 
Code § 572.0025(b).

•   The rules governing the assessment process prescribe:

The types of professionals who may conduct an assessment;
 

The minimum credentials each type of professional must have to conduct an assessment; and
 

The type of assessment that professional may conduct.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.0025(d).
 

•   The  applicable  rules  can  be  found  in  the  Texas  Administrative  Code.    25  Tex.  Admin.  Code  

§§ 411.490; 411.461.

Legislative Change

S  .B.  1238  (86th  Reg.  Sess.  (2019))  amended  subsections  572.0025(g)  and  (f)  by  requiring  a 
psychiatric examination within 72 hours before the admission or 24 hours after the admission.  
Section  572.0025  relates  to  the  examination  that  must  be  performed  by  a  physician  for  a 
voluntary inpatient admission.  Former subsection (f) required an examination to be performed 
within  72  hours  of  the  admission,  which  when  read  with  subsection  (g)  was  commonly 
understood to mean within 72 hours prior to the admission.  The revision provides flexibility for the exam to 
be performed up to either 72 hours before or 24 hours after the patient is admitted to the facility.

The  bill  also  added  subsections  (f-1)  and  (f-2),  which  are  discussed  below,  and  (f-3),  which  relates  to  the 
admission of a child in the managing conservatorship of the Department of Family and Protective Services.

•   A prospective patient may not be formally admitted to the facility unless:

There is an order from a physician who has conducted a physical and psychiatric exam of the patient, 
 
in person or through communications technology:

 ■

 ■

72 hours before admission; or
 

24 hours after admission; or
 

 
The admitting physician consulted with another physician who examined the patient within the above 
time frames; and

The facility agrees to accept the patient in writing.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.0025(f).
 

If a facility admits a patient prior to performing a physical and psychiatric exam, the patient must be 
 
immediately discharged if a physician performing the exams after admittance determines the person 
does  not  meet clinical standards to receive  inpatient  mental  health services.   Tex.  Health  &  Safety 
Code § 572.0025(f)(1).  

 
If a person is discharged under these circumstances, the facility may not bill the patient or the patient’s 
insurance for temporary admission.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.0025(f)(2).

3.1.6  Rights of Patients

•   A person’s voluntary admission into an inpatient mental health facility does not affect any legal capacity, 
civil rights, or the person’s right to obtain a writ of habeas corpus.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.003(a).

•   Specifically, a person voluntarily admitted to an inpatient mental health facility has the right:

To be reviewed periodically to determine the need for continued treatment; and
 

 
To have an application for court-ordered services filed only as provided by the requirements of section 
572.005.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.003(b). 

•   A person must be informed of the rights contained in this section and section 572.004 (Discharge):

Both orally and in writing (in the person’s primary language, if possible) within 24 hours after the 
 
person is admitted. Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.003(c)(1); or

 
Through means necessary to communicate with a hearing or visually impaired person.  Tex. Health & 
Safety Code § 572.003(c)(2).

If  the  patient  is  a  minor,  the  patient’s  parent,  managing  conservator,  or  guardian  must  also  be 
 
informed of the patient’s rights.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.003(d).

3.1.7  Discharge

•   Except as noted below, a patient is entitled to leave the facility after the patient signs, times, and dates the 
written request for discharge and files it with the facility administrator.  This document must be made 
part of the patient’s clinical record.
 ◦

If a patient informs an employee of their wish to be discharged, the employee must help the patient in 
 
creating the document and present it to the patient for signature as soon as possible.  Tex. Health & 
Safety Code § 572.004(a).

•   After the patient files the request for discharge, the facility has four hours to notify the patient’s treating 
physician.  If that physician is not available during that time period, the facility may notify any other 
physician.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.004(c).

•   The physician must discharge the patient before the end of the four-hour period unless the physician 
has reasonable cause to believe that the patient might meet the criteria for court-ordered mental health 
services or emergency detention.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.004(c).

•   If the physician does have reasonable cause, the physician has to examine the patient as soon as possible, 

but no later than 24 hours after the written request for discharge was filed.
 ◦

 
After the exam, if the physician determines that the patient does not meet the criteria for court-ordered 
mental health services or emergency detention, the physician shall discharge the patient.

 
If the patient does meet the criteria for court-ordered mental health services or emergency detention, 
the  physician  has  until  4  pm  on  the  next  business  day  after  the  exam  to  either  discharge  the 
patient or file an application for court-ordered mental health services or emergency detention and 
obtain a written order for any further detention.

 
The  patient  must  be  notified  if  the  physician  files  an  application  for  court-ordered  mental  health 
services or seeks an emergency detention.

 
The physician’s decision and the reasons behind it must be made part of the patient’s clinical record.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.004(d).

•   In the case of extremely hazardous weather conditions or a disaster, the physician may request the judge 
who has jurisdiction over court-ordered mental health services proceedings to extend the time period 
for which the patient may be detained.  There must be a new order from the judge every day, which may 
extend the time period until 4 p.m. on the next business day, and this order must state that an emergency 
exists due to the weather or a disaster.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.004(e).

•  If  the  patient  files a written withdrawal of  the  request  for discharge  before  the end of  the  prescribed 
period, or if an application for court-ordered mental health services or emergency detention is filed, the 
patient cannot leave the facility.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.004(f)(1); (f)(2).

•   The facility must prepare a plan for continuing care in accordance with section 574.081 (Continuing Care 
Plan Before Furlough or Discharge) for each patient who is discharged.  If there is not time to prepare 
before discharge, the facility may mail the plan to the patient within 24 hours of discharge.  Tex. Health 
& Safety Code § 572.004(g).

•   The facility must notify the patient (or other person who files a request for discharge of a patient) that the 
person filing the request assumes all responsibility for the patient upon discharge.  Tex. Health & Safety 
Code § 572.004(h).

•   On receipt of a written request for discharge from a patient admitted under Section 572.002(3)(B) 
who is younger than 18 years of age, a facility shall consult with the patient’s parent, managing 
conservator,  or  guardian  regarding  the  discharge.    If  the  parent,  managing  conservator,  or 
guardian objects in writing to the patient’s discharge, the facility shall continue treatment of 
the patient as a voluntary patient.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.004(i).

3.1.8  Application for Court-Ordered Treatment

•   The physician responsible for the patient’s treatment must notify the patient if the physician intends to 
file an application for court-ordered mental health services.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.005(b).

•   “An application for court-ordered mental health services cannot be filed against someone, including a 

child, who is receiving voluntary treatment unless:
 ◦
 ◦

A request for release of the patient has been filed with the facility administrator; or
 

 
In the opinion of the physician responsible for the patient’s treatment, the patient meets the criteria 
court-ordered mental health services and:

is absent from the facility without authorization;
 

is unable to consent to appropriate and necessary psychiatric treatment; or
 

 ■

 ■

 ■

refuses  to  consent  to  necessary  and  appropriate  treatment  recommended  by  the  physician 
 
responsible  for  the  patient’s  treatment  and  that  physician  completes  a  certificate  of  medical 
examination  for  mental  illness  that,  in  addition  to  the  information  required  by  Section  574.011 
[Certificate of Examination for Mental Illness], includes the opinion of the physician that:

•   there is no reasonable alternative to the treatment recommended by the physician; and

•   the patient will not benefit from continued inpatient care without the recommended treatment.”  

 

Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 572.005(a)(1); (a)(2).

3.1.9  Transportation of Patient to Another State

•   A court order is required to transport a patient to another state for voluntary inpatient mental health 

services.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 572.0051.

3.2 

Involuntary Mental Health Services

Least Restrictive Appropriate Setting

The Mental Health Code is clear to point out that the patient’s right to liberty must always be respected and 
balanced against society’s interest in safety.  This balance is seen in section 571.004 of the Texas Health and 
Safety Code:

The least restrictive appropriate setting for the treatment of a patient is the treatment setting that:

1.   Is available;

2.   Provides the patient with the greatest probability of improvement or cure; and

3.   Is no more restrictive of the patient’s physical or social liberties than is necessary to provide the patient 
with the most effective treatment and to protect adequately against any danger the patient poses to 
themselves or others.

•   Found in sections 573.001 and 573.011 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, emergency detention is the 
legal procedure by which a person experiencing a mental health crisis, regardless of their age, may be 
detained for a preliminary examination and crisis stabilization, if appropriate.

•   Emergency  detention  may  be  necessary  and  appropriate  when  a  person  must  be  placed  in  the  least 
restrictive, most appropriate setting, while safeguarding the person’s legal rights to a subsequent judicial 
determination of their need for involuntary mental health services.  See Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 
571.004, 576.021(a)(1).  If a person under 18 years of age is experiencing a mental health crisis, and their 
parent  or  guardian  is  unavailable  or  unwilling  to  consent  to  treatment,  emergency  detention  may  be 
appropriate.

•   The Texas Health & Safety Code permits peace officers to make a warrantless apprehension of a person 
with  mental  illness when appropriate  for  the  purpose  of  transporting  that  person  to a  mental  health 
facility for evaluation.

Rights of Persons during Emergency Detention Procedures

The purpose of emergency detention procedures is not punishment, but rather prevention of serious harm 
to the person or others due to the person’s mental illness.  See Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.001(a)(1).  The 
rights of persons involved in an emergency detention are set out in section 573.025 of the Texas Health and 
Safety Code.  These rights are the same whether the person is detained by a peace officer, a legal guardian 
of an adult, or some other person, and whether the detention occurs with or without a warrant.  A person 
apprehended, detained, or transported under Chapter 573 has the right:

 ■  To be advised of the location and reasons for the detention, and that the detention could result in a 

longer period of involuntary commitment;

 ■  To a reasonable opportunity to communicate with and retain an attorney;

 ■  To be transported upon release to a location as provided by section 573.024 unless the person is 

arrested or objects;

 ■  To be released as provided by section 573.023 if the person does not meet the requirements for 
admission to an inpatient mental health108  facility after the preliminary examination, or if the facility 
determines that the requirements of 573.022(a)(2) no longer apply;

 ■  To be advised that any communication with a mental health professional may be used in proceedings 

for further detention;

 ■  To be transported in accordance with the requirements of Chapters 573 and 574; and

 ■  To a reasonable opportunity to communicate with a relative or other responsible person who has a 

proper interest in the person’s welfare.

Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 573.025(a)(1-7).

A  person  must  be  notified  of  these  rights  both  orally  and  in  writing  (in  the  person’s  primary  language,  if 
possible) within 24 hours after the person is admitted, or through means necessary to communicate with a 
hearing or visually impaired person.  Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 573.025(b)(1); (b)(2).

3.2.1  Emergency Detention is the First Step

A description of emergency detentions involving children and adolescents and initiated by peace officers, can be 
found in Intercept 1, section 1 on page 49 of this Bench Book.  This section has a brief overview of the emergency 
detention process.

•   Although rarely used, a person younger than 18 years of age may be taken into custody pursuant to an 

Emergency Detention.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.001(a).

3.2.1a  Temporary Acceptance Required

•   A facility must temporarily accept a person for whom:

 ◦

An officer or EMS personnel under an MOU provides a notice of detention completed by the officer 
 
under section 573.002(a) of the Texas Health and Safety Code.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.021(a).

•   Note: a facility must comply with this section only to the extent that the commissioner determines that a 
facility has sufficient resources to perform the necessary services under this section.  Tex. Health & Safety 
Code § 573.021(d).

•   Exception: a person may not be detained in a private mental health facility without the consent of the 

facility administrator.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.021(e).

108  Note that this language is not in the statute, which less specifically refers to “a facility.”

3.2.1b  Within 12 Hours of Apprehension, a Physician Must Perform a Preliminary Examination

Regardless  of  whether  a  person  was  transported  to  a  facility  with  or  without  a  warrant,  the  person  must  be 
evaluated by at least one physician within 12 hours after the time the person is apprehended by the peace officer.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.021(c).

3.2.1c  When a Person May be Admitted to a Facility After a Preliminary Exam

•   The person can be admitted to a facility only if the physician who performed the preliminary examination 

 ■

 ■

 ■

 ■

 ■

 ■

makes a written statement that:
 ◦
 ◦

Is acceptable to the facility;
 

States that after a preliminary examination it is the physician’s opinion that:
 

The person is a person with mental illness;
 

The person evidences a substantial risk of serious harm to self or others;
 

The risk of harm is imminent unless the person is immediately restrained; and
 

 
Emergency  detention  is  the  least  restrictive  means  by  which  the  necessary  restraint  may  be 
accomplished; and

 ◦

Includes:
 

A description of the person’s mental illness;
 

A specific description of the risk of harm, which may be demonstrated by: 
 

•   The person’s behavior; or

•   Evidence of severe emotional distress and deterioration in the person’s mental condition to the 

extent that the person cannot remain at liberty; and

•   The specific detailed information from which the physician formed the opinion.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.022.

Distinguish: CME for Mental Illness

A physician’s “written statement” documenting a preliminary examination under section 573.022 of the Texas 
Health and Safety Code is not a “CME for mental illness” under section 574.011 of the Texas Health and Safety 
Code.  The former is required after a preliminary examination is performed for a facility to hold a person 
under  emergency  detention  provided  by  Chapter  573  (Emergency  Detention);  the  latter  must  accompany 
an application for court ordered mental health services under Chapter 574 as discussed in the Fitness to 
Proceed section of Intercept 3: Courts.

•   The person must be released on completion of the preliminary examination unless the person is admitted 
to a facility as described in section 3.2.1c above.  If the person is admitted, the person must be released if 
the facility administrator determines at any time during the emergency detention period that one of the 
criteria described above no longer applies.  Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 573.022(a), (b).

3.2.1d  Release

3.2.1e  Transport

•   After  admission,  the  admitting  facility  may  transport  the  person  to  a  facility  deemed  suitable  by  the 
LMHA/LBHA.  At the LMHA’s request, the judge may order that the person be detained in a department 
mental  health facility  (i.e.,  State  Mental  Health  Hospital).    Either the admitting facility or the facility 
where  the  person  is  detained  may  transfer  the  person  to  an  appropriate  mental  hospital  (inpatient 
mental health facility) with the written consent of the hospital administrator.  Tex. Health & Safety Code  
§§ 573.022(b), (c); see also Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.045 (detailing more requirements pertaining 
to transportation of a patient).

3.2.1f  Within 24 Hours of Initial Detention, the Person Must be Released if No Order of Protective 
Custody is Obtained

•   A child accepted  for a preliminary examination  may  be detained  for  no  more than  48  hours  after  the 
time they are presented to the facility.  That includes any time the child spends waiting in the facility for 
medical care before they receive the preliminary examination.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.021(b).

•   If the 48-hour period ends on a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or before 4 p.m. on the first succeeding 
business day, the person may be detained until 4 p.m. on the first succeeding business day.  If the 48-hour 
ends at a different time, the person may be detained only until 4 p.m. on the day the 48-hour period ends.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.021(b).

3.3 

Involuntary Commitment (Court Ordered Mental Health Services)

The Texas Health and Safety Code provides the basis for the involuntary commitment of an adult to a mental 
health facility.  For an explanation of Emergency Detentions, Orders of Protective Custody, and Commitments 
for adult patients, see Texas Mental Health and Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Law Bench Book, 2nd 
Edition, Texas Judicial Commission on Mental Health.109 

•   A person younger than 18 years of age may not be involuntarily committed unless provided by Chapter 
572, Texas Health and Safety Code, Chapter 55, Texas Family Code, or department rule.  Tex. Health & 
Safety Code § 572.001(c-1).

•   Most commitments of persons younger than 18 years of age occur under the provisions of Chapter 55, 

Texas Family Code, and are discussed in Intercept 3: Courts, starting on page 79.

Legislative Change

S.B. 1238 (86th Reg. Sess. (2019)) amended Texas Health and Safety Code subsection 572.001(c-
1)  by  substituting  Chapter  55,  Texas  Family  Code  in  place  of  the  previous  wording,  other 
state law.  This change should clear up confusion about which laws provide for the involuntary 
commitment of children.

Intercept 1: Initial Contact with 
Law Enforcement

Intercept 1: Initial Contact with Law Enforcement focuses on the law enforcement response to children and 
adolescents with MI or IDD.  Officers have considerable discretion in responding to a situation in the community 
involving a child or adolescent with a mental illness or intellectual disability who may be engaging in delinquent 
conduct or CINS, experiencing a mental health crisis, or both.  School Resource Officers, in particular, are valuable 
partners in assisting children with MI or IDD.  

While taking a child into custody may be legally permissible, there are alternatives that could better serve the 
child and the community.  It is important that judges are familiar with alternatives to detention, and that they 
encourage the provision of training and resources for law enforcement on these issues.

Reflection Point

The initial contact with law enforcement is an important discretionary point to examine whether 
race,  ethnicity,  or  socioeconomic  status  are  factors  in  deciding  if  a  child  is  issued  a  citation, 
taken into custody, or released to a parent. The Texas Family Code presumes that every juvenile 
who  does  not  meet  the  statutory  detention  criteria  should  be  released  to  a  parent  or  other 
responsible adult.

1. Emergency Detention and Protective Custody of Children with MI

1.1  What is an Emergency Detention?

An emergency detention  is  not an arrest.    Emergency detention  is  the  legal procedure  by which  a person of 
any age, including a child, who is experiencing a severe mental health crisis may be detained for a preliminary 
examination and crisis stabilization, if appropriate.  An emergency detention may be completed with a warrant 
issued by a magistrate, or without a warrant by a law enforcement officer.  Law enforcement officers have significant 
discretion to make a warrantless apprehension for an emergency detention if the statutory criteria are met.  (See 
Tex.  Health  &  Safety  Code  §  573.001(a).)    In  the  adult  system,  this  is  frequently  referred  to  as  an  “APOWW” 
(Apprehension by Police Officer Without a Warrant).

Emergency detention may be necessary and appropriate when a parent, managing conservator, or legal guardian 
cannot or will not consent to voluntary services for their child.  The child must be placed in the least restrictive, 
most appropriate setting.  See Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 571.004, 576.021(a)(1).

Overview of Emergency Mental Health Procedures

I.   Emergency Detention (ED) Under Chapter 573 of the Texas Health and Safety Code

A.   Transporting Child to, or Holding Child Currently at, a Facility

1.   Law Enforcement – No Warrant (no initial court involvement required) (“APOWW”)

 ■  Apprehension: a peace officer believes that the child has MI, and because of the MI, there is 
a substantial risk of serious harm to self or others (demonstrated by behavior or evidence of 
severe emotional distress and deterioration) unless the child is immediately restrained, and 
there is no time to get a warrant.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.001(a).

Notice to Facility: officer must give notice of detention to facility, Tex. Health & Safety Code 
§ 573.002; without notice, the facility may not detain the child involuntarily.

B.   Preliminary Examination at Facility

1.   When it Must Occur

The exam must be performed by a physician within 12 hours after the child is apprehended.  Tex. 
Health & Safety Code § 573.021(c).

2.   Standard for ED Admission

Preliminary examination must show that child both has MI and is a substantial risk of serious and 
imminent harm to self or others.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.022(a).

3.   Child Must be Released if the Child Does Not Meet the Above Criteria.

4.   Transportation After Release

The  child  must  be  returned  to  the  location  of  apprehension,  residence  in  Texas,  or  another 
suitable  location.    If  the  child  was  apprehended  by  a  peace  officer,  immediate  transport  is 
required; otherwise, it must be reasonably prompt.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.024.

1.2 

Peace Officer: Transport to a Facility Without a Warrant

Law enforcement officers have the opportunity to provide the fastest intervention to begin deescalating a crisis 
and  obtain  the  necessary  early  information  to  evaluate,  stabilize,  and  safeguard  the  child.    Law  enforcement 
officers trained in crisis intervention can provide an immediate response with support and access to emergency 
medical services.

Mental Health Officers, Crisis Intervention Teams, and  
Trauma-Informed Law Enforcement

Mental health officers (MHOs) are peace officers who have specialized, TCOLE-approved training in crisis 
intervention and de-escalation of crisis calls.  

Crisis  Intervention  Teams  (CITs)  are  local  initiatives  designed  to  improve  the  law  enforcement  and 
community response to people experiencing mental health crises. Teams are built on strong partnerships 
between law enforcement, mental health providers, and individuals and families affected by mental illness.  
For  more  information  on  CITs,  see  https://www.texascit.org.  MHOs  work  collaboratively  with  the  crisis 
response teams of LMHAs and LBHAs to divert adults and children in need of crisis services from jails and 
hospitals to community-based services.  These partnerships can help communities develop solutions to close 
service gaps, and to deliver more effective, and less expensive, behavioral health treatment to an individual 
than they would receive at a hospital or jail facility.

Trauma-Informed Law Enforcement Training “not only educate[s] police about trauma, but give[s] them 
specific techniques for carrying out their duties… when police officers acquire a trauma perspective and work 
in concert with mental health providers and the community, families and children see them not simply as 
forces of order charged with enforcing the law, but as trusted advocates concerned about their safety.”110 

1.2.1  Standard: A Substantial Risk of Serious Harm

A peace officer may take a person into custody, regardless of the age of the person, without a warrant if the 
officer has reason to believe and does believe that:

•   The person has MI

immediately restrained; and

•   Because of the MI, there is a substantial risk of serious harm to the person or others unless the person is 

•   There is insufficient time to obtain a warrant before taking the person into custody.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.001(a).

A substantial risk of serious harm may be demonstrated by:

•   The person’s behavior; or

that the person cannot remain at liberty.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.001(b).

•   Evidence of severe emotional distress and deterioration in the person’s mental condition to the extent 

Legislative Change

Because some law enforcement officers were hesitant to detain minors pursuant to an APOWW 
under  section  573.001  of  the  Texas  Health  and  Safety  Code,  S.B.  1238  amended  subsection 
573.001(a) permitting an officer to take a person into custody, “regardless of the age of the 
person,” if the statutory requirements are met.  86th Reg. Sess. (2019).  This should clear up 
confusion about which laws provide for the involuntary commitment of children.

Children Cannot be Involuntarily Committed

Recall that Texas Health and Safety Code subsection 572.001(c-1) instructs: “A person younger than 18 years 
of  age  may  not  be  involuntarily  committed  unless  provided  by  this  chapter,  Chapter  55,  Family  Code,  or 
department rule.”  

The legislature amended the section of the Texas Health and Safety Code pertaining to warrantless Emergency 
Detentions in 2019 to specifically include children, as explained above.  No similar amendment was made 
to section 573.011 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, “Application for Emergency Detention.”  Some have 
interpreted that reading the two statutes together yields the conclusion that children cannot be the subject 
of an Emergency Detention Warrant, an Order of Protective Custody, or of Civil Commitment outside of Texas 
Family Code Chapter 55.

A warrantless Emergency Detention will last for 48 hours, which could provide the opportunity for a parent, 
guardian, or caregiver to be located to give consent for voluntary mental health treatment.  

In the event that a child has no readily identifiable parent or caregiver, a mandated reporter would likely 
contact the Department of Family and Protective Services so that the Department, or another party, can file 
an emergency petition for temporary managing conservatorship.

1.2.2  What May Support an Officer’s Belief

The officer must be able to cite specific recent behavior, overt acts, attempts, or threats in support of their belief.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.002(b)(5).

The officer’s belief may be based on:

•   The representation of a credible person;

•   The person’s conduct; or

•   The circumstances under which the person is found.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.001(c).

Officer’s Personal Observations Not Required

Note that the statute does not require an officer’s personal observations of conduct or behavior suggesting a 
substantial risk of serious harm.  An officer’s belief may be based on credible information given to the officer 
by a witness, such as a family member, teacher, or coach.

1.2.3  An Officer Must Investigate

A peace officer must “investigate the circumstances surrounding a mental health call prior to taking the subject 
into custody and before transporting the subject to a mental health facility.”  Trevino v. State, 512 S.W.3d 587, 595 
(Tex. App.—El Paso 2017, no pet.).

1.2.4  Transport to a Facility

An officer must transport the person:

•   To the nearest appropriate inpatient mental health facility;
•   If  such  a  facility  is  unavailable,  to  another  mental  health  facility111    deemed suitable  by  the  LMHA/

LBHA; or

111  The definition of mental health facility includes “that identifiable part of a general hospital in which diagnosis, treatment, and care for persons 
with mental illness is provided.” Tex. Health & Safety Code § 571.003(12).  Pursuant to their obligations under the federal Emergency Medical 
Treatment and Active Labor Act or otherwise, hospital emergency departments often diagnose, treat, and care for persons with mental illness.

1.2.5  Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Regarding Transportation for Emergency Detention

A law enforcement agency and an EMS provider may execute an MOU under which EMS personnel employed 
by  the  provider  may  transport  a  person  taken  into  custody  under  an  emergency  detention  by  a  peace  officer 
employed by the law enforcement agency.  The MOU must:

•   Address responsibility for the cost of transporting the person taken into custody; and

•   Be approved by the county in which the law enforcement agency is located and the LMHA that provides 
services in that county with respect to provisions of the MOU that address the responsibility for the cost 
of transporting the person.

An officer must immediately inform the person orally and in simple, nontechnical terms:

•   Of the reason for the detention; and

•   That a staff member of the facility will inform the person of their rights within 24 hours.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.005(b).

1.2.6  Person’s Rights

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.001(g).

1.2.7  Firearms

An officer may immediately seize any firearms in the person’s possession.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 573.001(h).  
Note that specific procedures for seizure and return of firearms will vary by jurisdiction.112   

1.2.8  Notice of Detention to Facility

After taking the person to a facility, the officer must immediately file with the facility a notification of detention 
on  the statutorily  required  form  (see  page  56 of  this  Bench  Book).   The  facility  must  honor  the statutorily 
prescribed form and cannot require use of a different form.  The facility must include the notice in the person’s 
clinical file.  Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 573.002(a), (c).

If emergency medical personnel transport the person at the request of a peace officer, they must immediately file 
with the facility the notification of detention completed by the peace officer who made the request.  Tex. Health 
& Safety Code § 573.002(a).

2. Taking a Child into Custody Absent a Mental Health Crisis

Reflection Point

Absent a mental health crisis, a law enforcement custodial event is an important discretionary 
point to examine whether race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status are factors in the custody 
decision.    The  Family  Code  presumes  that  every  juvenile  who  does  not  meet  the  statutory 
detention criteria should be released to a parent or other responsible adult.

2.1 

Taking a Child into Custody is Usually Discretionary

Law enforcement may take a child into custody:

•  pursuant to an order of the juvenile court;

•  pursuant to the laws of arrest;

•  if the officer has probable cause to believe the child engaged in:

 
conduct that violates a penal law of this state or a penal ordinance of any political subdivision of this
state;

delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision; or
 

conduct that violates a condition of probation imposed by the juvenile court;
 

•  pursuant to a directive to apprehend issued as provided by section 52.015 of the Texas Family Code.

◦

◦
◦

Tex. Fam. Code § 52.01.  

The officer can also issue a warning notice to the child instead of taking the child into custody, if certain conditions 
are met.  Tex. Fam. Code § 52.01(c).  These citations cannot be issued for school offenses.  Tex. Ed. Code § 37.143(a).  
See section 2.5.1 below for further discussion.

2.2  When Taking a Child into Custody is Mandatory

A peace officer shall take a child into custody on the issuance of a directive to apprehend. Tex. Fam. Code § 52.015(b).

2.3 

Notice to Probate Court May be Required

As soon as practicable, but not later than the first working day after the date a law enforcement officer takes a 
child who is a ward into custody under section 52.01(a)(2) or (3) of the Texas Family Code, the law enforcement 
officer or other person  having the custody of the child shall  notify the court with  jurisdiction over the child’s 
guardianship of the child’s detention or arrest.  Tex. Fam. Code § 52.011(b).  

Note that in this section, “ward” has the meaning assigned by section 22.033, Texas Estates Code: “Ward” means a 
person for whom a guardian has been appointed.  This notification is an added safety net to prevent a child with 
MI or ID from being lost within the system.

2.4 

Release or Delivery to Court

Law  enforcement  agencies  can  develop  guidelines  to  help  determine  when  to  take  children,  but  particularly 
children with mental illness or an intellectual disability, into custody, if at all.  Officers should consider whether 
adequate supervision is available in the child’s home before taking a child into custody.

Out-of-Custody Referrals

Many juvenile cases can be filed by law enforcement as “out-of-custody” referrals.  Absent a present threat to 
the safety of the juvenile or the community, officers should consider not taking a juvenile with MI or ID into 
custody, and instead making an out-of-custody referral.  Separation from family is difficult for all juveniles, 
and a juvenile with specialized needs may find their needs unmet by the detention program.

A law enforcement officer who has taken a child into custody is required to immediately take one of seven actions:

•   Take the child to the juvenile processing office designated by the juvenile board;

•   Release the child to a parent, guardian, custodian, or other responsible adult;

•   Bring the child to the office or official designated by the juvenile board if there is probable cause to believe 
that the child engaged in delinquent conduct, CINS, or conduct that violates a condition of probation 
imposed by the juvenile court;

•   Bring the child to a juvenile detention facility;

•   Bring the child to a medical facility if the child is believed to suffer from a serious physical condition or 

illness that requires prompt treatment;

•   Dispose of the case without referral to juvenile court under section 52.03; or

•   Return the child to their school campus if school administrators agree to resume responsibility for the 

child for the remainder of the day.  

Tex. Fam. Code § 52.02(a).

Note that a person taking a child into custody must promptly give notice of the person’s action and a statement of 
the reason for taking the child into custody, to:

•   The child’s parent, guardian, or custodian; and

•   The office or official designated by the juvenile board.

Tex. Fam. Code § 52.02(b).

Firearms Offenses

A child who is alleged to have engaged in delinquent conduct and to have used, possessed, or exhibited a 
firearm in the commission of the offense must be detained until the child is released at the direction of the 
judge of the juvenile court, a substitute judge, or a juvenile referee.  Tex. Fam Code § 53.02(f).  The judge can 
authorize the child’s release over the phone.  Firearms offenses include all offenses committed with a firearm 
and illegal carrying or possession of a firearm.

2.5 

Law Enforcement Diversions from Juvenile Court

Even when a law enforcement officer has determined that a child should be taken into custody, the officer does not 
have to make a referral to juvenile court.  Several kinds of informal dispositions are available to law enforcement.  
These  diversions  from  juvenile  court  can  result  in  better  outcomes  in  cases  involving  all  children,  including 
children with MI or IDD.113   

113  See Holly A. Wilson and Robert D. Hoge, The Effect of Youth Diversion Programs on Recidivism: A Meta-Analytic Review, 40 Crim. Just. & Behavior, 497, 
499 (2013) (“A growing body of results from empirical research is also providing at least indirect support for the use of diversion.  This research 
demonstrates clearly that involvement in the juvenile justice system, holding all other factors constant, is associated with an increased likelihood 
of offending behavior.”); see also Barry holman & Jason ZieDenBerg, JustiCe PoliCy inst., the Dangers of Detention: the imPaCt of inCarCerating youth 
in Detention anD other seCure faCilities 2 (2006) (“A recent literature review of youth corrections shows that detention has a profoundly negative 
impact on young people’s mental and physical well-being, their education, and their employment.”).

2.5.1  Warning Notice

Under certain circumstances involving minor offenses, law enforcement officers can issue a warning notice to a 
child instead of taking the child into custody.  Tex. Fam. Code § 52.01(c).  A warning notice is similar to a traffic 
ticket.

•  Guidelines  for  the  issuance  of  warning  notices  must  be  adopted  by  the  law  enforcement  agency  and

approved by the juvenile board.

•  The warning notice must identify the child and describe the conduct.

•  When a child is issued a warning notice, copies of the notice must be sent to the child’s parent, guardian,
or  custodian;  filed  with  the  office  or  official  designated  by  the  juvenile  board;  and  filed  with  the  law
enforcement agency.

Tex. Fam. Code §§ 52.01(c)(1-6).

Further action, such as a family conference, may be taken by the juvenile court staff or law enforcement agency, 
but is not required.  Note that warning notices cannot be issued for school offenses.  Tex. Ed. Code § 37.143(a).

Reflection Point

Every law enforcement agency should seek to utilize warning notices when and where possible.  
Each law enforcement agency should learn what guidelines the local juvenile board has adopted 
for  making  dispositions  without  referral  to  court  under  Texas  Family  Code  section  52.03.  
Appropriate diversions help to reduce disparate outcomes.

2.5.2  Law Enforcement Disposition Without Referral to Court

Law enforcement officers can dispose of certain low-level offenses and non-traffic Class C misdemeanors without 
referring them to juvenile court or municipal court if:

•  Guidelines for such dispositions have been adopted by the juvenile board;

•  The disposition is authorized by the guidelines; and

•  The officer makes a written report of the disposition to the law enforcement agency, identifying the child

and specifying the grounds for believing that taking the child into custody was authorized.

Tex. Fam. Code § 52.03(a).

Possible  authorized  dispositions  under  this  section  include  referral  of  the  child  to  an  agency  other  than  the 
juvenile court, a family conference, or a referral of the child and family to a family services agency or a DFPS youth 
intervention program.  Tex. Fam. Code § 52.03(c).

2.5.3  First Offender Program

Another diversion opportunity for law enforcement agencies is first offender programs.  The juvenile board is 
authorized to establish a law enforcement first offender program for children with no prior delinquent conduct 
adjudications who are taken into custody or accused, prior to the filing of charges, of:

•  conduct indicating a need for supervision;

•  a non-traffic Class C misdemeanor; or

•  Class  A  or  B  misdemeanor  or  state  jail  felony  delinquent  conduct  that  does  not  involve violence  to  a

person or the use or possession of a firearm, location-restricted knife, or club.

Tex. Fam. Code § 52.031(a).

First offender programs are operated by the law enforcement officer or agency designated by the juvenile board, 
pursuant to disposition guidelines adopted by the juvenile board.  Tex. Fam. Code § 52.031(b).  The program may 

JCMH_Juvi_BenchBook_8.26.21.indd   59

59

include periodic reporting to the law enforcement officer or agency, voluntary restitution, voluntary community 
service  restitution,  and  educational  training,  vocational  training,  counseling,  or  other  rehabilitative  services.   
Tex. Fam. Code § 52.031(h).

A child referred by law enforcement to the first offender program is not referred to the juvenile court, and the 
record of the offense is not submitted to DPS.  Tex. Fam. Code § 58.001(c).  If the child successfully completes 
the program, and is not taken into custody for a new offense for the next 90 days, the law enforcement agency 
destroys all records linking the child to the offense, other than keeping the child’s name and basic information 
for the purpose of determining future eligibility for the program.  Tex. Fam. Code § 52.031(i).  Chapter 58, Family 
Code, contains additional record-keeping requirements related to first offender programs.

Human Trafficking Victims

If there is probable cause to believe that a child engaged in delinquent conduct or CINS, and is the victim of 
human trafficking, the child’s case cannot be disposed of under either the Disposition Without Referral to 
Court or First Offender Program sections of the Texas Family Code.  Tex. Fam. Code § 52.032(b).  Instead, that 
child’s case should be addressed under a special deferred prosecution program for trafficked children, under 
Texas Family Code section 54.0326, discussed below, in Intercept 3: Courts, on page 97.

Intercept 2: Initial Detention and 
Court Hearings

Intercept 2: Initial Detention and Court Hearings focuses on initial detention and court hearings.  This intercept 
will frequently be the first opportunity for judicial involvement.  This includes matters such as intake screening, 
early assessment, and pretrial release of children with mental illness or intellectual disabilities.  Identification at 
this stage can facilitate informed decision-making around a juvenile’s care, treatment continuation, and release 
orders.  Diversion continues to be a focus in this intercept.

Part I: Detention

Laws across the Administrative Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the Family Code detail the various 
procedures for identifying a juvenile’s possible MI or ID at the earliest stages of – and throughout – a juvenile 
court proceeding.

Facilities moving toward trauma-informed practice will want to carefully examine what happens from the moment 
youth enter the door, and how well detention intake policies and procedures create an environment of safety.  
Some of the considerations114  are whether:

•  Staff are sensitive and alert to whether a child is in distress, and take appropriate steps to address concerns;

•  Youth are informed of non-discrimination policies, and that their needs will be recognized; for example,

that “Safe Zone” signs are posted to help youth who identify as LGBTQ feel more at ease;

•  Interviews about sensitive information occur in private areas;

•  Youth are informed about safety in the facility; for example, how gang issues are handled, what protections 

ensure safety, and how to confidentially report problems;

•  Searches are no more intrusive than needed for intake and in compliance with Prison Rape Elimination
Act standards115  (no cross-gender pat downs, and cross-gender strip searches or body cavity searches only 
in exigent circumstances);

•  Youth are screened for trauma, and further assessment occurs where needed;

•  Youth receive all of the information they need about their rights and the institutional rules in a form they 

•  Youth receive information about how to register complaints or to speak confidentially to someone who

can understand;

can help if problems arise.

1. Early Identification and Assessments

Detention staff are required to perform various assessments of children on admission to the detention facility.  
Efficient  communication  of  this  information  is  necessary  for  judges,  attorneys,  and  probation  officers  to 
understand and address any special needs a child may have.

Reflection Point

Practitioners should examine the socioeconomic factors that influence release, diversions, and 
alternatives  to  detention.    For  example,  families  with  substantial  financial  resources  may  be 
able  to  pay  for  electronic  leg  monitoring  (ELM)  devices  or  provide  parental  supervision  as  a 
result of home based employment or flexible work hours.  It is important not to mistake poverty 
for neglect.

1.1 

Detention Intake

There will be an intake officer at the detention facility, or on call, 24 hours a day.  The intake officer determines whether 
the juvenile should be released or detained, based on the facility’s policies and in accordance with Texas Family Code 
section 53.01.  Juveniles who are in need of emergency medical care due to injury, illness, intoxication, or mental 
health crisis will not be admitted into detention.  Instead, the officer who transported the juvenile to detention will 
need to take the juvenile to a health care facility for evaluation and treatment.  The juvenile may be admitted later, 
after written clearance from a health care or mental health care provider.  37 Tex. Admin. Code § 343.400.

Release from Detention

When a child is brought into detention, the intake or other authorized officer of the court must immediately 
make an investigation and shall release the child unless it appears that the child’s detention is warranted.  
The release may be conditioned upon requirements reasonably necessary to insure the child’s appearance 
at later proceedings, but the conditions must be in writing and filed with the office or official designated by 
the court and a copy furnished to the child.  Tex. Fam. Code § 53.02(a).

A child taken into custody may be detained prior to a hearing on the petition only if:

1.  The child is likely to abscond or be removed from the jurisdiction of the court;

2.    Suitable  supervision,  care,  or  protection  for  the  child  is  not  being  provided  by  a  parent,  guardian, 

custodian, or other person;

required;

3.  The child has no parent, guardian, custodian, or other person able to return the child to the court when 

4.  The child may be dangerous to themselves, or the child may threaten the safety of the public if released;

5.  The child has previously been found to be a delinquent child or has previously been convicted of a 

penal offense punishable by a term in jail and is likely to commit an offense if released; or

6.  The child’s detention is required due to an alleged firearms offense.

Tex. Fam Code § 53.02(b).

1.2  Mandatory Mental Health Screening116 117   

The detention facility must administer a mental health screening or provide a clinical assessment conducted by a 
mental health provider within 48 hours of the juvenile’s admission to the facility.  The mental health screening tool 
used in Texas is the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument, 2nd Edition, or MAYSI-2.  A juvenile who receives 
a positive screening must be given a secondary screening immediately or referred to a mental health provider by 
the end of the next workday.  If either the secondary screening or the mental health provider recommends further 
mental health intervention for the juvenile, a referral to a mental health provider or to a physician must occur 
within 48 hours.  See 37 Tex. Admin. Code § 343.404.

MAYSI-2118 

The MAYSI-2 is a brief behavioral health screening tool designed for juvenile justice programs and facilities.  
46 states have adopted the MAYSI-2.  The tool requires no formal training as a mental health professional 
and  can  be  administered  in  approximately  10  minutes.    It  consists  of  52  questions  regarding  the  recent 
experience of thoughts, feelings or behaviors, to which the juvenile answers YES or NO.  The answers provide 
scores on seven scales: Alcohol/Drug Use, Angry Irritable, Depressed Anxious, Somatic Complaints, Suicide 
Ideation, Thought Disturbance, and Traumatic Experiences.  Scores on each scale allow staff to determine 
whether the juvenile may need immediate attention for suicide precaution or further assessment by a mental 
health professional.  

116  The  MAYSI  and  other  detention  intake  assessments  require  the  child  to  respond  to  questioning  by  a  government  employee  or  agent,  the 
detention officer.  Texas Family Code section 54.03(e) states that “A child alleged to have engaged in delinquent conduct or CINS need not be a 
witness against nor otherwise incriminate himself.  An extrajudicial statement which was obtained without the requirements of this title or of the 
constitution of this state or of the United States, may not be used in an adjudication hearing.”

117  See also,  Tex. Health  &  Safety Code § 614.017(b) (“Information obtained under this section  may  not be used as  evidence in any juvenile or 
criminal proceeding, unless obtained and introduced by other lawful means.”).  Further discussion of this statute appears below, in Section 3: 
Information Sharing is Mandatory.

118  More information about the MAYSI can be found at: national youth sCreening & assessment Partners, http://www.nysap.us/maysi2/index.html

1.3  Mandatory Screening of Juveniles for Suicide

All juveniles must be screened for suicide risk within two hours of admission into a facility, or upon any indication 
that a juvenile who was previously screened may now, or at other times during their stay, be at moderate or high 
risk for suicidal behavior.  This screening is part of a suicide prevention plan that all facilities, in consultation 
with a mental health provider, must develop and implement.  See 37 Tex. Admin. Code § 343.340.  The MAYSI-2 
can satisfy the suicide screening requirement if it is administered within two hours of the juvenile’s admission.   
37 Tex. Admin. Code § 343.404(a)(3).

Mental Health Referral of High-Risk Suicidal Youth 

The facility must refer a juvenile classified as high risk for suicidal behavior to a mental health provider or 
agency within 24 hours after the classification is assigned, and document that the referral was made.  37 Tex. 
Admin. Code § 343.346.

1.4  Mandatory Health Screening

All juveniles must have a health screening within two hours of their admission to the facility.  The health screening 
must include, but is not limited to: mental health conditions, treatment, and hospitalizations; observation of the 
juvenile’s appearance, behavior, state of consciousness, breathing; current medications; use of alcohol or drugs; 
special  health requirements; and any other  health concerns reported  by the  juvenile.    If the  juvenile requires 
follow-up care, the facility must contact a health care professional as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours 
after the screening.  37 Tex. Admin. Code § 343.406.  

1.5  Mandatory Behavioral Screening

All juveniles must be screened for potential vulnerabilities or aggressive behavior.  The behavioral screening must 
consider the juvenile’s age, offense history, physical size, state of mind, sexual orientation, prior victimization or 
abuse, level of emotional and cognitive development, mental or physical disabilities, intellectual or developmental 
disabilities, and other pertinent information.  37 Tex. Admin. Code § 343.414.  

Detention  facilities  may  consider  screening  vulnerable  children  and  adolescents  for  additional  classifications 
than the law requires, such as gender identity, to ensure the child’s safety.

Interruption of a child’s medication regimen should be avoided.  A child’s existing treatment regimen should be 
extended into the detention setting to prevent deterioration.

2.  Medication

2.1 

Continuity of Care 

All secure pre-adjudication detention and post-adjudication correctional facilities are required to have a written 
health service plan.  The plan must include procedures: 

•   For conducting health screenings and assessments; 

•   For the referral of juveniles in need of medical attention for medical, mental health, and dental services; 

•   For emergency health care services; 

•   To ensure continuity of care in accordance with the instructions of the medical provider including the 

delivery of treatment, medication, referrals, follow up, and medically-modified diets;

•   Relating  to  informed  consent  as  required  by  Texas  Family  Code  Chapter  32  for  medical,  dental, 

psychological, and surgical treatment; immunizations; and counseling services;

•   Relating  to  procurement, distribution, dispensing, disposal, and accounting of  prescription and over-

the-counter medication;

2.2  Medication Administration

Stimulants, tranquilizers, and psychotropic medications cannot be administered to juveniles in detention without 
an order from a physician, physician assistant, dentist, or nurse practitioner.  The detention facility is required to 
adopt a policy concerning the administration of medication to juveniles.  The policy must include requirements 
that any medication brought into the facility by the juvenile’s parent or guardian must be in the original container, 
and the parent or guardian submit a written request to the facility to administer the medication; that all medication 
prescribed to the juvenile during their stay is administered; and that each administration of the medication is 
documented.  37 Tex. Admin. Code § 343.336.

Continuing Medication is Critical to Continuity of Care 

Continuing  a  child’s  prescription  medication  is  critical  to  preventing  mental  health  deterioration.    Intake 
officers should consult with the child and their parent or guardian regarding current medications.  Family 
members should bring all current medications to the detention center as soon as possible.  Judges should 
inquire about medications at detention hearings and require a doctor’s visit if a child’s medication needs are 
not met.

3.  Information Sharing is Mandatory

3.1 

Considerable confusion has surrounded the issue of sharing personal information in  
proceedings involving juveniles, and particularly in proceedings involving juveniles with 
or who may have MI or ID.  This subsection identifies some of the key state-law provisions 
governing that issue. 

3.2 

Information Regarding Special Needs Offenders

State  law requires  that agencies share  information  for purposes of continuity of care and services  for  “special 
needs offenders,” which includes individuals: 

•  For whom criminal charges are pending; or 

•   Who, after conviction or adjudication, are in custody or under any form of criminal justice supervision.

Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 614.017(a), (c)(2).

3.3 

 What an Agency is Required to Do

Specifically, an agency must:

•   Accept information relating to a special needs offender or a juvenile with a mental impairment that 
is sent to the agency to serve the purposes of continuity of care and services regardless of whether 
other state law makes that information confidential; and

•   Disclose  information  relating  to a special  needs offender  or a  juvenile with a  mental  impairment, 
including information about the offender’s or juvenile’s identity; needs; treatment; social, criminal, and 
vocational history; supervision status and compliance with conditions of supervision; and medical and 
mental health history, if the disclosure serves the purposes of continuity of care and services.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 614.017(a).

3.4 

Agencies Must Safeguard Confidentiality

An agency must manage confidential information accepted or disclosed under this section prudently to maintain, 
to the extent possible, the confidentiality of that information.  A person commits an offense if the person releases 
or discloses confidential information obtained under section 614.017 for purposes other than continuity of care 
and services, except as authorized by other law or by the consent of the person to whom the information relates.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 614.017(d), (e).

3.7 

Continuity of Care for Juveniles with Mental Impairments

The Texas Juvenile Justice Department, the Department of Public Safety, the Department of State Health Services, 
the Department of Aging and Disability Services, the Department of Family and Protective Services, the Texas 
Education Agency, and local juvenile probation departments must adopt a memorandum of understanding that 
establishes their respective responsibilities to institute a continuity of care and service program for juveniles 
with  mental  impairments  in  the  juvenile  justice  system.    TCOOMMI  shall  coordinate  and  monitor  the 
development and implementation of the MOU.  

The MOU must establish methods for:

1. 

 
Identifying juveniles with mental impairments in the juvenile justice system and collecting and reporting 
relevant data to the office;

2.   Developing interagency rules, policies, and procedures for the coordination of care of and the exchange of 
information on juveniles with mental impairments who are committed to or treated, served, or supervised

In this section, “continuity of care and service program” includes:

1.

2.

3.

 
Identifying  the  medical,  psychiatric,  or  psychological  care  or  treatment  needs  and  educational  or
rehabilitative service needs of a juvenile with mental impairments in the juvenile justice system;

Developing a plan for meeting the needs identified under subdivision 1; and
 

 
Coordinating  the  provision  of  continual  treatment,  care,  and  services  throughout  the  juvenile  justice
system to juveniles with mental impairments.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 614.018(c).

Juvenile Records

Certain juvenile justice agencies and juvenile justice service providers are permitted to share certain records 
regarding a child’s personal health information or history of government services provided, for the purposes 
of coordination of care, prevention of duplication of services, enhancing rehabilitation, and improving and 
maintaining community safety.  Tex. Fam. Code § 58.0052.  Juvenile records will be discussed in depth in a 
later edition of this Bench Book.

3.8 

Exempt from the Texas Medical Records Privacy Act (TMRPA)

TMRPA, the state law governing privacy of medical records, expressly excludes an agency described by section 
614.017  (set  forth  above)  with  respect  to  the  disclosure,  receipt,  transfer,  or  exchange  of  medical  and  health 
information and records relating to individuals in the custody of an agency or in community supervision.  Tex. 
Health & Safety Code § 181.057.

4. Restraints

Texas Juvenile Justice Department standards govern the use of restraints in juvenile secure detention and post-
adjudication  facilities.   The standards apply  to personal restraints,  mechanical restraints, chemical restraints, 
and  non-ambulatory restraints.   The frequency of seclusion and restraint practices used  in an organization  is 
considered one indicator of how well an organization is implementing trauma-informed practices.119   

Consider utilizing restraints in the courtroom setting only as an exception rather than the rule.

Reflection Point

4.1 

Approved Restraint Techniques 

Each facility must adopt a personal restraint technique that has been approved by TJJD.  Personal restraints are 
also considered physical restraints.

•   “Handle with Care”120  and “The Mandt System”121  are the currently approved restraint techniques.  37 Tex. 

Admin. Code § 390.9723(j)(1)(B).

•   Only juvenile supervision and probation officers may use personal restraints in juvenile facilities.  Before 
participating in a restraint, the officers must be trained in the approved restraint technique and in the 
facility’s specific verbal de-escalation practices and procedures.  37 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 343.800(a), (c).

•   The officers must be retrained on the restraint technique at least once every 365 days.  37 Tex. Admin. 

Code § 343.808(c).

4.2  When Restraints can be Used

•   Personal restraints may be used only to prevent imminent or active self-injury, injury to others, serious 

property damage, or escapes.  37 Tex. Admin. Code § 343.802(d).

•   Personal restraints may be used only as a last resort and only the amount of force and type of restraint 

necessary to control the situation may be used.  37 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 343.802(e), (f).

•   Personal restraints are required to be implemented in a way to protect the health and safety of the juvenile 

and to be terminated as soon as the threat has subsided.  37 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 343.802(g), (h).

4.3 

Prohibited Uses of Restraints

•   Personal restraints may not be used for punishment, discipline, retaliation, harassment, compliance, or 
intimidation, or as a substitute for appropriate disciplinary seclusion nor may they deprive a juvenile of 
basic human necessities, including restroom opportunities, food, water, or clothing.  37 Tex. Admin. Code 
§§ 343.804(1), (2).

•   Personal restraints that pose a risk to a juvenile are prohibited, such as restraints intended to inflict pain; 
restraints that place a juvenile in a prone or supine position with pressure on the neck or head; restraints 
that obstruct the airway, including placing anything over the mouth or nose; restraints that interfere with 
the juvenile’s ability to communicate; restraints that obstruct the view of the juvenile’s face; techniques 
that do not include monitoring the juvenile’s respiration and for signs of physical distress; and percussive 
or electrical shocking devices (e.g. tasers).  37 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 343.804(3-10).

4.4  Mechanical Restraints

•   Only approved  mechanical  restraints  may  be  used.   This  includes ankle cuffs,  handcuffs, plastic cuffs 
(in an emergency only), restraint beds, restraint chairs, waist belts, and wristlets.  37 Tex. Admin. Code  
§§ 343.810(a)(1), (b)(8). 

•   Unlike personal restraints, mechanical restraints can be used for juvenile, staff, and public safety purposes 
even when there is no imminent threat.  Such preventive restraints are authorized when moving a juvenile 
from one  point  to another within a secure  facility, when  transporting  juvenile  in a vehicle, or when a 
juvenile is required to leave the secure confines of the facility.  37 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 343.818(1-3).  Under 
limited circumstances, the documentation of the use of mechanical restraints for routine, preventative 
use is not required.  37 Tex. Admin. Code § 343.818(4). 

•   There  are  several  requirements  to  ensure  safety  while  in  mechanical  restraints,  such  as  a  prohibition 
on restraining the juvenile to a stationary object or to part of a vehicle or another resident in a vehicle; 
a  prohibition  on  “hogtying”  a  juvenile  by  attaching  their  arms  and  legs  together  behind  the  back;  a 
requirement that the mechanical restraint not be so tight as to impact circulation or so loose as to cause 
chafing; and a  prohibition on  keeping  the  juvenile  in a  prone  position while  in  mechanical  restraints 
for  any  period  of  time  beyond  the  time  necessary  to  apply  the  restraints.    Additionally,  juveniles  are 
prohibited from participating in physical activity while in mechanical restraints.  37 Tex. Admin. Code  
§§ 343.810(b)(3-7), 343.818(2), 380.9723(k)(G).

4.5 

Non-Ambulatory Mechanical Restraints

It  is  sometimes  necessary  to  use  a  non-ambulatory  mechanical  restraint  for  a  juvenile.    This  type  of  restraint 
prohibits a juvenile’s ability to stand upright and walk.  Examples include a four-point restraint and a restraint chair.

•   Non-ambulatory mechanical restraints may be used only in response to a juvenile’s overt self-injurious 
behavior and only when other less restrictive interventions or other forms of physical restraint have been 
deemed inappropriate or ineffective.  37 Tex. Admin. Code § 343.812(a).

•   Permission from the facility administrator or designee is required for each instance of the use of a non-
ambulatory  mechanical  restraint;  standing  orders  for  such  use  are  prohibited.    37  Tex.  Admin.  Code  
§ 343.812(b).

•   These restraints may be used only in an area or room  not visible to other residents but that is readily 
accessible to health care professionals or specifically trained staff with supervisory responsibilities related 
to non-ambulatory mechanical restraints.  37 Tex. Admin. Code § 343.812(c).

•   Constant supervision by a juvenile supervision or probation officer is required, as is an opportunity for 
expanded physical motion for at least 5 minutes every 30-minues, an opportunity to drink water and use 
the restroom every hour, and regularly prescribed medications.  A written recommendation from a health 
care professional or a mental health provider is required for a non-ambulatory mechanical restraint to 
continue longer than one hour.  37 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 343.812(f), (i).

•   Non-ambulatory mechanical restraints lasting two hours are considered a behavioral health crisis and 
result  in an  immediate  referral  to a  mental  health  provider or a  mental  health  facility  for assessment 
and possible treatment.  Such restraints may not last more than three hours in any 24-hour time period.   
37 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 343.812(g), (h).

4.6 

Chemical Restraints

A  chemical  restraint  is  the  use  of  any  chemical,  including  pharmaceuticals,  through  topical  application,  oral 
administration, injection, or other means, for purposes of restraining an individual and which is not a standard 
treatment for the individual’s medical or psychiatric condition.  25 Tex. Admin. Code § 415.253(3).  Antipsychotic 
and sedative medications are examples of chemical restraints.

•   While chemical restraints are permissible, they may be used only in response to a facility riot and, even 
then,  only  when  other  forms  of  approved  restraints  are  deemed  inappropriate  or  ineffective.    37  Tex. 
Admin. Code § 343.816(1).

•   Chemical  restraints  require  approval  from  the  facility  administrator  prior  to  use;  standing  orders  are 

prohibited.  37 Tex. Admin. Code § 343.816(2).

•   Chemical restraints may not be used on juveniles who are already in a personal or mechanical restraint or 
who are otherwise under control.  Neutralizers and decontaminants must be readily available for use on 
juveniles who have been exposed to chemical restraints.  37 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 343.816(5), (7).

Restraints and Trauma

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has found that “the use of seclusion 
and restraint can result in psychological harm, physical injuries, and death to both the people subjected to 
and the staff applying these techniques.”122   It is helpful for judges and lawyers to be familiar with the local 
detention facility’s policies and practices for using seclusion and restraints.  When seclusion or restraints are 
used on a youth, inquiries should be made to confirm that use and duration of the seclusion or restraint was 
proper.  Detention facilities may want to adopt policies that require supervisor or administrative review of 
all restraints and seclusions.  All participants in the juvenile court system must have an understanding that 
youth who have experienced severe or complex trauma may exhibit high-risk behaviors, but that seclusion 
and  restraint  as  a  response  to  those  behaviors  can  cause  additional  trauma  or  re-traumatization  of  the 
youth. 123

Part II: Initial Detention Hearing

The initial detention hearing is the first contact that the child will have with the court.  It may be the first time 
the child has interacted with a judge or a lawyer, or the first time that they have seen a courtroom.  The child may 
have been separated from their parent or guardian for several days and may not know what to expect or how to 
behave in a courtroom. 

Creating a Trauma-Informed Courtroom can ease the anxiety and fear that children may be experiencing.  The 
following bench card,124  designed by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network,125  will assist judges and other 
juvenile court professionals  in understanding  the  behavior of youth, and  in  making good decisions regarding 
detention, release, placement, service referrals, and treatment.  

1.  Initial Detention Hearing

During a hearing, the court and counsel can avoid re-traumatizing youth by phrasing questions in a way to elicit 
information  neutrally.    For example,  instead of asking whether a parent or guardian wants  the youth  back  in 
the home, consider asking questions to establish whether the home is a safe environment, and whether there is 
suitable supervision for the youth.

•   If  the child was  not  released  by  the detention center  intake officer, a detention  hearing shall  be  held 
promptly.  Promptly means not later than the second working day after the child is taken into custody; or 
the first working day if the child was taken into custody on a weekend or holiday.

•   Detention hearings are non-jury proceedings and can be heard by a judge, referee or master.

•   Reasonable written or oral notice of the hearing must be given to the child, and if located, to the child’s 

parent, guardian, or custodian.
 ◦

 
If the parent, guardian, or custodian cannot be found, the detention hearing can be held, so long as 
the court appoints counsel or a guardian ad-litem for the child.

•   The court must inform the child of the child’s right to remain silent.

 ◦

 
Statements made by the child during a detention hearing are not admissible against the child at any 
other proceeding.

•   The court may consider written reports and the testimony of witnesses in making the detention decision.

•   The court shall find whether there is probable cause to believe that a child who was taken into custody 
without  an  arrest  warrant  or  a  directive  to  apprehend  has  engaged  in  delinquent  conduct,  CINS,  or 
conduct that violates an order of probation imposed by the juvenile court.
 ◦

The PC finding must be made within 48 hours of the time the child was taken into custody, including 
 
weekends and holidays.

NCTSN  BENCH CARD  
for the trauma-informed  judge 

Research has conclusively demonstrated that court-involved children and adolescents present with extremely high 
rates of traumatic stress caused by their adverse life experiences. In the court setting, we may perceive these youth as 
inherently disrespectful, defiant, or antisocial, when, in fact, their disruptive behavior may be better understood in 
the context of traumatic stress disorders. These two Bench Cards provide judges with useful questions and guidelines 
to help them make decisions based on the emerging scientific findings in the traumatic stress field. These cards are 
part of a larger packet of materials about child and adolescent trauma available and downloadable from the NCTSN 
Trauma-Informed Juvenile Justice System Resource Site* and are best used with reference to those materials.

1.  Asking trauma-informed questions can help judges identify children who need or could benefit from 

trauma-informed services from a mental health professional. A judge can begin by asking, “Have I 
considered whether or not trauma has played a role in the child’s1 behavior?” Use the questions listed 
below to assess whether trauma-informed services are warranted. 

TRAUMA EXPOSURE: Has this child experienced a traumatic event? These are events that involve actual or 
threatened exposure of the child to death, severe injury, or sexual abuse, and may include domestic violence, 
community violence, assault, severe bullying or harassment, natural or man-made disasters, such as fires, floods, 
and explosions, severe accidents, serious or terminal illness, or sudden homelessness.

MUlTIPlE OR PROlOngEd EXPOSURES: Has the child been exposed to traumatic events on more than one 
occasion or for a prolonged period? Repeated or prolonged exposure increases the likelihood that the child  
will be adversely affected. 

OUTcOMES Of PREvIOUS SAncTIOnS OR InTERvEnTIOnS: Has a schedule of increasingly restrictive 
sanctions or higher levels of care proven ineffective in this case? Traumatized children may be operating in 
“survival mode,” trying to cope by behaving in a defiant or superficially indifferent manner. As a result, they might 
respond poorly to traditional sanctions, treatments, and placements. 

cAREgIvERS’ ROlES: How are the child’s caregivers or other significant people helping this child feel safe 
or preventing (either intentionally or unintentionally) this child from feeling safe? Has the caregiver been a 
consistent presence in the child’s life? Does the caregiver acknowledge and protect the child? Are caregivers 
themselves operating in survival mode due to their own history of exposure to trauma?

SAfETy ISSUES fOR THE cHIld: Where, when and with whom does this child feel safest? Where, when and 
with whom does he or she feel unsafe and distrustful? Is the home chaotic or dangerous? Does a caregiver in the 
household have a restraining order against another person? Is school a safe or unsafe place? Is the child being 
bullied at school or does the child believe that he or she is being bullied?

TRAUMA TRIggERS In cURREnT PlAcEMEnT: Is the child currently in a home, out-of-home placement, 
school, or institution where the child is being re-exposed to danger or being “triggered” by reminders of  
traumatic experiences?

UnUSUAl cOURTROOM BEHAvIORS: Is this child behaving in a highly anxious or hypervigilant manner 
that suggests an inability to effectively participate in court proceedings? (Such behaviors include inappropriate 
smiling or laughter, extreme passivity, quickness to anger, and non-responsiveness to simple questions.)  
Is there anything I, as a judge, can do to lower anxiety, increase trust, and enhance participation?

2.  It is crucial to have complete information from all the systems that are working with the child and 

family. Asking the questions referenced below can help develop a clearer picture of the child’s trauma 
and assess needs for additional information. 

cOMPlETEnESS Of dATA fOR dEcISIOnS: Has all the relevant information about this child’s history been 
made available to the court, including child welfare and out-of-jurisdiction or out-of-state juvenile justice 
information?

InTER-PROfESSIOnAl cOOPERATIOn: Who are the professionals who work with this child and family?  
Are they communicating with each other and working as a team? 

UnUSUAl BEHAvIORS In THE cOMMUnITy: Does this child’s behavior make sense in light of currently 
available information about the child’s life? Has the child exhibited extreme or paradoxical reactions to 
previous assistance or sanctions? Could those reactions be the result of trauma? 

dEvElOPMEnT: Is this child experiencing or suffering from emotional or psychological delays? Does the child 
need to be assessed developmentally?

PREvIOUS cOURT cOnTAcTS: Has this child been the subject of other court proceedings? (Dependency/
Neglect/Abuse; Divorce/Custody; Juvenile Court; Criminal; Other) 

OUT-Of-HOME PlAcEMEnT HISTORy: How many placements has this child experienced? Have previous 
placements been disrupted? Were the disruptions caused by reactions related to the child’s trauma history? 
How did child welfare and other relevant professionals manage these disruptions?

BEHAvIORAl HEAlTH HISTORy: Has this child ever received trauma-informed, evidence-based evaluation 
and treatment? (Well-intentioned psychiatric, psychological, or substance abuse interventions are sometimes 
ineffective because they overlook the impact of traumatic stress on youth and families.) 

3.  Am I sufficiently considering trauma as I decide where this child is going to live and with whom? 

PlAcEMEnT OUTcOMES: How might the various placement options affect this child? Will they help the 
child feel safe and secure and to successfully recover from traumatic stress or loss?

PlAcEMEnT RISkS: Is an out-of-home placement or detention truly necessary? Does the benefit outweigh 
the potential harm of exposing the child to peers who encourage aggression, substance use, and criminal 
behavior that may possibly lead to further trauma?

PREvEnTIOn: If placement, detention or hospitalization is required, what can be done to ensure that the 
child’s traumatic stress responses will not be “triggered?” (For example, if placed in isolation or physical 
restraints, the child may be reminded of previous traumatic experiences.) 

dISclOSURE: Are there reasons for not informing caregivers or staff at the proposed placement about the 
child’s trauma history? (Will this enhance care or create stigma and re-victimization?)

TRAUMA-InfORMEd APPROAcHES: How does the programming at the planned placement employ trauma-
informed approaches to monitoring, rehabilitation and treatment? Are staff knowledgeable about recognizing 
and managing traumatic stress reactions? Are they trained to help children cope with their traumatic 
reactions? 

POSITIvE RElATIOnSHIPS: How does the planned placement enable the child to maintain continuous 
relationships with supportive adults, siblings or peers?

4.  If you do not have enough information, it may be useful to have a trauma assessment done by  
a trauma-informed professional. Utilizing the ncTSn BEncH cARd fOR cOURT-ORdEREd

will assist you in making trauma-informed decisions.

Guardian Ad Litem

The court’s authority under Tex. Fam. Code § 51.11 to appoint a guardian ad litem when the child’s parent 
is unable or unwilling to act in the child’s best interests is consistent with the goals of the Juvenile Justice 
Code under Tex. Fam. Code § 51.01, which include the best interests of the child and the protection of the 
community. 

Reflection Point

Ask yourself, as a judge, has equity been considered in the prior intercept points?  Has release 
or evaluation by a mental health provider been overlooked by the arresting officer or education 
systems?  What assumptions have I made about the cultural identity, genders, profession, and 
background of this family?  Have I made assumptions about who is present in the courtroom, 
overlooking  transportation  or  other  concerns  in  favor  of  shortcuts  and  assumptions  about 
whether the family cares about the well-being of their child?  How might my assumptions (or, the assumptions 
of those involved at prior intercept points) influence my decision-making?

1.1 

Right to Counsel

Before the first detention hearing, the court must notify the child and the child’s parent, guardian, or custodian of 
the child’s right to legal counsel.  Tex. Fam. Code §§ 51.10(a)(1), 54.01(b).  The court shall appoint an attorney after 
a finding that the child’s family is indigent unless the appointment is not feasible due to exigent circumstances.  
Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  54.01(b-1).    Once an attorney  is appointed  to represent a child,  the attorney  must continue 
representation  of  the  child  until  the  case  is  terminated,  the  family  retains  an  attorney,  or  a  new  attorney  is 
appointed.  Tex. Fam. Code § 51.10(a).

The court shall provide the attorney with all written material to be considered in making the detention decision.  
Tex. Fam. Code § 54.01(c).

Best Practices for Appointing Counsel

Promptly appoint counsel.  If there is a question about the parent’s or guardian’s ability to retain counsel, an 
attorney should be appointed first, and an inquiry regarding the financial situation of the family should be 
explored later.  Consider appointing counsel with specialized MI or ID training, when possible.  

1.2 

Presumption of Release

At the conclusion of the hearing, the court shall order the child released from detention unless it finds that:

•  The child is likely to abscond or be removed from the jurisdiction of the court;

•  Suitable  supervision,  care,  or  protection  for  the  child  is  not  being  provided  by  a  parent,  guardian,

custodian, or other person;

required;

•  The child  has  no  parent, guardian, custodian, or other  person able  to  return  the child  to court when

•  The child may be dangerous to themselves or may threaten the safety of the public if released; or

•  The child has previously been found to be a delinquent child or has previously been convicted of a penal

offense punishable by a term in jail or prison and is likely to commit an offense if released.

Tex. Fam. Code § 54.01(e).

1.3 

Setting and Enforcing Conditions of Release

A  release  may  be  conditioned  on  requirements  reasonably  necessary  to  insure  the  child’s  appearance  at  later 
proceedings.  Tex. Fam Code § 54.01(f).  The conditions of release must be in writing, and a copy must be given to 
the child.  Id.  Possible conditions include meeting with a probation officer or a counselor, living with a particular 
relative, following a curfew, attending school, or avoiding contact with a peer or alleged victim.  

When a child  has previously  been  found unfit  to proceed,  judges should consider whether  that child  has  the 
capacity to understand and abide by conditions of release.  

If the child violates a condition of release, the order of release may be revoked, and the child can be taken into 
custody again.  Tex. Fam. Code § 52.01.

Considerations for Conditions of Release

Some judges order children, as a condition of release from the detention facility, to participate in psychological 
evaluations,  assessments,  counseling  sessions,  or  intake  interviews  for  entry  into  programs;  or  to  attend 
medical appointments for medical evaluation or medication management.  There are many good reasons 
for engaging in services at an early stage of a juvenile case, but also some considerations to keep in mind.

It  is  possible  that  the  child  could  incriminate  themselves  during  an  evaluation  or  treatment.    Defense 
attorneys may find it necessary to instruct their juvenile clients to avoid discussing the alleged offense during 
evaluation or services that occur prior to adjudication.  Attorneys may consider postponing these activities 
until they determine how the case will proceed and discuss possible outcomes with the client.  Agreements 
can be made between the parties that anything revealed during such an evaluation will not result in juvenile 
prosecution.  If no agreements are made, the child and their attorney should acknowledge that fact in writing.  

Service providers should clearly explain to children whether the assessment or interview is confidential, and 
to whom the report will be distributed.  Service providers can provide the reports directly to defense counsel, 
to ensure the child’s rights were protected and privileges were upheld.

The court and all parties should be aware that any documents or reports that the juvenile probation officer 
receives directly from a service provider could be items that the prosecution must produce for the defense 
under the Michael Morton Act.126 

2.  Physical or Mental Examination

The initial detention hearing is usually the first time that the judge and the child’s attorney will interact with the 
child and the child’s parent, guardian, or custodian.  Although these hearings can be brief and informal, they are 
an opportunity to gather information about any diagnoses or special needs that the child may have. 

At any stage of the proceedings, the juvenile court can, at its own discretion or at the request of the child’s 
parent or guardian, order a physical or mental examination of the child to determine whether the child has a 
mental illness, has an intellectual disability, or suffers from chemical dependency.  Tex. Fam Code § 51.20(a).  

If, after the examination, there is reason to believe the child has MI, ID, or suffers from chemical dependency, the 
probation department must refer the child to the LMHA, LIDDA, or other provider for evaluation and services, 
unless the prosecuting attorney has filed a petition under section 53.04.  Tex. Fam. Code § 51.20(b).

Reflection Point

Ask yourself, as a judge, has equity been considered in prior intercept points?  Has a previous 
or current diagnosis of MI or IDD been overlooked?  Are there education records that document 
diagnoses?  Has any party previously sought evaluations for MI or IDD?  If not, could the cultural 
identity, profession, or background of the youth and family be clouding their appropriateness 

or access to services for MI or IDD?  

Has  trauma  affected  the  family’s  ability  to  access  services  in  any  system,  including  education  or  juvenile 
probation?  How have I challenged any assumptions I might have made based on cultural identity, profession, 
or  background?    Is  my  jurisdiction  gathering  local  data  on  whether  BIPOC  youth  are  assessed  and/or 
diagnosed with a MI or IDD at higher rates than non-BIPOC youth?

2.1  Who May Conduct the § 51.20 Physical or Mental Examination  

The  examination  must  be  performed  by  a  disinterested  expert,  including  a  physician,  psychiatrist,  or 
psychologist,  qualified  by  education  and  clinical  training  in  mental  health  or  [intellectual  disability]127    and 
experienced  in forensic evaluation, to determine whether the child  has a  mental  illness as defined  by  Section 
571.003, Health and Safety Code, is a person with [intellectual disability] as defined by Section 591.003, Health 
and Safety Code, or suffers from chemical dependency128  as defined by Section 464.001, Health and Safety Code.  
Tex. Fam. Code § 51.20(a).

Judges  may  consider  ordering  a  trauma-informed  examination.  The  bench  card129  on  page  77  contains 
considerations for eliciting trauma-specific information during an examination, assessment, or report.

A Juvenile Can Have MI or ID and be Fit to Proceed Under Chapter 55

It is important to understand that that a judge may receive information that may not suggest that a juvenile is 
unfit to proceed under Chapter 55 of the Texas Family Code, but that may suggest that the juvenile has a MI 
or ID.  Such a condition may not render the juvenile unfit to proceed, but it may warrant special consideration 
and management of the juvenile’s case.

127  Note that the actual text of Texas Family Code section 51.20(a) uses the outdated term “mental retardation.”  S.B. 219 (84th Reg. Sess. (2015)), 
amended many sections of the Family Code to substitute “intellectual disability” for “mental retardation.”  For the purposes of consistency, we 
choose to use “intellectual disability” here.

128  “Chemical dependency” means: abuse of alcohol or a controlled substance; psychological or physical dependence on alcohol or a controlled 
substance; or addiction to a controlled substance.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 464.001(1).

Child with Mental Illness, Disability, or Lack of Capacity and Class C Misdemeanors

Texas Penal Code section 8.08 gives courts that have jurisdiction over Class C misdemeanors and municipal 
ordinance violations a mechanism for the dismissal of cases involving children with diminished capacity.

 ■ When a motion is made, the court must determine whether probable cause exists to believe that a 

child, including a child with a mental illness or developmental disability130 :

1.  Lacks the capacity to understand the proceedings in criminal court or to assist in the child’s own 

defense and is unfit to proceed; or

2.  Lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of the child’s own conduct or to 

conform the child’s conduct to the requirement of the law.

 ■  The state, the defendant, the defendant’s parent or guardian, or the court can make the motion.

 ■  If the court determines that probable cause exists that the child is unfit to proceed or lacks substantial 

capacity, the court can dismiss the case after providing notice to the state.

Tex. Penal Code § 8.08.

130  The statute provides that when a child has diminished capacity, the case against the child can be dismissed.  The statute specifically mentions 
children with a mental illness or a developmental disability, but it does not exclude children who have diminished capacity due to other conditions, 
e.g., traumatic brain injury, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, or severe emotional disturbance.

NCTSN  BENCH CARD 

FOR COURT-ORDERED TRAUMA-INFORMED MENTAL 

HEALTH EVALUATION OF CHILD:  SAMPLE ADDENDUM

This Court has referred this child1 for mental health assessment.  Your report will assist the judge in making 
important decisions.  Please be sure the Court is aware of your professional training and credentials. In addition 
to your standard psychosocial report, we are seeking trauma-specific information.  Please include your opinion 
regarding the child’s current level of danger and risk of harm.  The Court is also interested in information about 
the child’s history of prescribed psychiatric medications.  We realize that you may be unable to address every 
issue raised below, but the domains listed below are provided as an  evidence-based approach  to trauma-informed 
assessment.

1. ScREEnIng And ASSESSMEnT Of THE cHIld And cAREgIvERS

Please describe the interview approaches (structured as well as unstructured) used for the evaluation.
Describe the evidence supporting the validity, reliability, and accuracy of these methods for children or 
adolescents. For screens or tests, please report their validity and reliability, and if they were designed for the
population to which this child belongs. If feasible, please report standardized norms.

Discuss any other data that contributed to your picture of this child.  Please describe how the perspectives
of key adults have been obtained.  Are the child’s caregivers or other significant adults intentionally or
unintentionally preventing this child from feeling safe, worthy of respect, and effective?  Are caregivers
capable of protecting and fostering the healthy development of the child?  Are caregivers operating in
“survival mode” (such as interacting with the child in a generally anxious, indifferent, hopeless, or angry way)
due to their own history of exposure to trauma? What additional support/resources might help these adults
help this child?

2. STREngTHS, cOPIng APPROAcHES, And RESIlIEncE fAcTORS

Please discuss the child’s existing strengths and coping approaches that can be reinforced to assist in
the recovery or rehabilitation process. Strengths might include perseverance, patience, assertiveness,
organization, creativity, and empathy, but coping might take distorted forms. Consider how the child’s
inherent strengths might have been converted into “survival strategies” that present as non-cooperative or
even antisocial behaviors that have brought this child to the attention of the Court.

Please report perspectives voiced by the child, as well as by caregivers and other significant adults, that
highlight areas of hope and recovery.

3. dIAgnOSIS (POST TRAUMATIc STRESS dISORdER [PTSd])

Acknowledging that child and adolescent presentations of PTSD symptoms will differ from adult
presentations, please “rule-in” or “rule-out” specific DSM-V criteria for PTSD for adolescents and children
older than six years, which include the following criteria:

•	

•	

Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence, either experienced directly,
witnessed, or learning that the event occurred to a close family member or friend  (Criteria A) 

Presence of intrusion symptoms such as intrusive memories, distressing dreams, flashbacks, physical 
reactions, trauma-specific re-enactment through play, psychological distress at exposure to cues  (Criteria B)

•	 Avoidance of stimuli or reminders associated with the traumatic event, including avoidance of internal 
thoughts and feelings related to the event, as well as external activities, places, people, or situations that
arouse recollections of the event (Criteria C)

9/3/2021   10:07:52 AM

9/3/2021   10:07:52 AM

•	 Negative changes in cognition, mood, and expectations; diminished interest in,  detachment, and 

estrangement from others; guilt and shame; socially withdrawn behavior; reduction in positive emotions 
(Criteria D)

•	 Alterations in arousal and reactivity, including irritable or aggressive behavior, angry outbursts, reckless or 
self-destructive behavior, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, concentration problems, and sleep 
disturbance (Criteria E)

•	

•	

•	

Exhibiting these disturbances in behavior, thoughts and mood for over a month  (Criteria F) 

Significant distress or impairment in relationships with parents, siblings, peers, or other caregivers or with 
school behavior (Criteria G)

The disturbed behavior and mood  cannot be attributed to the effects of a medication, street drug,  or other 
medical condition (Criteria H)

PTSD can also be present for children ages six and younger.  Criteria include exposure; intrusive symptoms, 
including distressing memories or play re-enactment and physiological reactions to reminders; avoidance of 
people, conversations or situations;  negative emotional states such as fear, sadness, or confusion, sometimes 
resulting in constriction of play; irritable behavior and hypervigilance; and impairment in relationships with 
parents, siblings, peers or other caregivers.   

Even if an official DSM-V diagnosis of PTSD is not warranted,  traumatic stress reactions can definitely or 
potentially contribute to the child’s behavioral, emotional, interpersonal, or attitudinal problems. Traumatic 
stress reactions may contribute to problems with aggression, defiance, avoidance, impulsivity, rule-breaking, 
school failure or truancy, running away, substance abuse, and an inability to trust or maintain cooperative and 
respectful relationships with peers or adults. 

4.  TRAUMA-InfORMEd SERvIcES

Has this child ever received Trauma-Focused, Evidence-Based Treatment?*** Sometimes well-intentioned 
psychiatric, psychological, social work, or substance abuse evaluations and treatment are incomplete and of limited 
effectiveness because they do not systematically address the impact of children’s traumatic stress reactions.

The Court is interested in potential sources of trauma-informed services in your area and your thoughts about the 
likelihood that the child can receive those services.

In the meantime, what can be done immediately for and with the family, school, and community to enhance safety, 
build on the child’s strengths, and to provide support and guidance?  How can this child best develop alternative 
coping skills that will help with emotional and behavioral self-regulation? 

5.  SUggESTIOnS fOR STRUcTURIng PROBATIOn, cOMMUnITy SUPERvISIOn And/OR PlAcEMEnT OPTIOnS. 

Structured case plans for probation, community supervision, and/or placement should consider the ability of 
the setting and the people involved to assist the child in feeling safe, valued, and respected. This is especially 
important for traumatized children. Similarly, the plan for returning home, for continuing school and education, 
and for additional court or probationary monitoring should also clearly address each child’s unique concerns 
about safety, personal effectiveness,  self-worth, and respect. Please consider where, when, and with whom this 
child feels most safe, effective, valued and respected. Where, when, and with whom does the child feel unsafe, 
ineffective, or not respected? What out-of-home placements are available that can better provide for this child’s 
health and safety, as well as for the community’s safety? What placements might encourage success in school, 
relationships, and personal development? 

1 The use of “child” on this bench card refers to any youth who comes under jurisdiction of the juvenile court.

*** Trauma-Focused, Evidence-Based (TF-EB) Treatment is science-based, often requires training in a specific protocol with careful 
clinical supervision, and emphasizes the treatment relationship, personal/psychological safety, emotional and behavioral self-
regulation, development of coping skills, specific treatment of child traumatic experiences, and development of self-enhancing/pro-
social thinking, feeling, decision-making, and behaving. TF-EB treatments include: Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, 
Parent-Child Interaction Therapy, Trauma Affect Regulation: Guidelines for Education and Therapy, Child Parent Psychotherapy and 
more.  See website:  http://www.nctsn.org/resources/topics/treatments-that-work/promising-practices

Intercept 3: Courts

Intercept  3:  Courts  is  historically  where  the  majority  of  justice  system  responses  to  mental  health  issues 
occur.    At  this  intercept,  the  legal,  practical,  and  health  consequences  for  individuals  with  MI  and  ID  are 
detrimental and life changing.  As a result, judicial support of community-based mental health responses and 
court-based interventions such as specialty courts and dockets are critical.  A supportive, trauma-informed, and 
developmentally appropriate judicial response that seeks to engage and encourage youth will result in increased 
trust, compliance, and better outcomes.  A bench card from the National Child Traumatic Stress Network  131 is 
included on page 71 and 72 to assist judges in gathering the information needed to make good decisions for the 
children who appear in their courts. 

Chapter 55 of the Family Code deals with children with mental illness or an intellectual disability who are also 
respondents in the juvenile court process.  There are three types of proceedings under Chapter 55: one in which 
the child  is  believed to  have a  mental  illness; one  in which the child  is  believed to  be unfit to proceed  in the 
juvenile system because he or she lacks the ability to understand the proceedings or to assist in [their] defense 
due to a mental illness or intellectual disability; and one in which the child should not be held responsible for 
[their] conduct because the child could not appreciate its wrongfulness or conform [their] conduct to the law’s 
requirements at the time the offense was committed due to a mental illness or intellectual disability.132   Attorneys 
and probation officers will have more contact with the child than the judge.  A checklist to assist in identifying a 
child’s potential mental health or intellectual disability issues is included on page 149.  

While communications with a child in juvenile court should always be matched to the age and maturity level 
of the child, when mental health or intellectual disability concerns have been or may be raised, judges should 
focus extra attention on how they interact with the child.  In order to reduce shame and stigmatization, judges 
are encouraged to be thoughtful when discussing a child’s mental health or intellectual disability diagnosis or 
symptoms in open court. The following best practices are recommended for courtroom interactions with youth 
who have MI or IDD:

9/3/2021   10:07:52 AM

Take your time.  Consider scheduling extra time for an adjudication or disposition hearing involving a child 
with MI or IDD.  Allow time for questions, processing, and rephrasing of admonishments and conditions.  Be 
mindful of signs that the child may be overwhelmed and take a break if needed.  Review the outcome of the 
hearing and use open-ended questions to determine the child’s level of understanding.

Give information more than once.  Be prepared to repeat and rephrase concepts.  It may be helpful for 
attorneys to meet with their child client several times before the court hearing.

Avoid  legalese  and  jargon.    Keep  language  simple  and  appropriate  for  the  child’s  developmental  level.  
Explain procedures step by step.  Be concrete and avoid abstract concepts.

Meet children where they are.  Minimize distractions in the courtroom.  Allow the child to bring a sensory 
or calming object in the courtroom.  Talk to the child, not at or around them.  Listen actively.  Give the child 
the opportunity to communicate through alternative means.  Highlight successes.  

Reflection Point

Ask yourself, as a judge, has trauma created a lack of ability to access services by the family in 
any  system  including  education  or  juvenile  probation?    Has  any  party  sought  deferred 
prosecution in favor of outpatient treatment in the community?  Has any party filed a Chapter 
55 motion?  Have I helped to destigmatize mental health and intellectual and developmental 
disability?    Have  I  made  assumptions  about  who  is  present  in  the  courtroom,  overlooking 
transportation  or  other  concerns  in  favor  of  shortcuts  and  assumptions  about  whether  the  family  cares 
about the well- being of their child?  What assumptions am I making without asking the child who are the 
important people in their life and who the court should invite to assist the family with the child?

Have I made assumptions based on the social media accounts, pictures, or posts of an adolescent as if they 
were  an  adult?    How  might  my  assumptions  influence  my  decision  making?    How  have  I  challenged  any 
assumptions I might have made based on cultural identity, profession, or background?

1. Mental Health Services When a Juvenile Case is Pending

When used in Texas Family Code Chapter 55, “mental illness” means “an illness, disease, or condition, other than 
epilepsy, senility, alcoholism, or mental deficiency, that: (A) substantially impairs a person’s thought, perception 
of reality, emotional process, or judgment; or (B) grossly impairs behavior as demonstrated by recent disturbed 
behavior.”   Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  55.01, Tex.  Health  &  Safety  Code  §  571.003(14).   At any stage of the proceedings, 
the  juvenile  court  may  order  a  child  to  be  examined  for  mental  illness,  an  intellectual  disability,  or  chemical 
dependency.  Tex. Fam. Code § 51.20(a).  

•  If a child is referred to the juvenile department for delinquent conduct or a CINS offense, but the prosecutor
does not file a petition alleging the conduct, the juvenile department must refer the case to the LMHA/
LBHA or LIDDA for evaluation and services if there is reason to believe the child has mental illness or an
intellectual disability.  Tex. Fam. Code § 51.20(b).

•  If the prosecutor has already filed a petition, the matter is handled under Texas Family Code Chapter 55.

1.1 

Diversion from Juvenile Court to Court-Ordered Mental Health Services

When a child has a mental illness, as defined above, but is not necessarily unfit to proceed or not responsible 
for their conduct due to mental illness, juvenile court proceedings can be stayed while the child receives court-
ordered mental health treatment.  The mechanism for this process is Subchapter B of Texas Family Code Chapter 
55. A flowchart to aid in understanding the process can be found on page 81.

1.1.a  Raising the Issue

•   When a child is alleged by petition or found to have engaged in delinquent conduct or CINS, any party 

may raise the issue of mental illness.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.11(a).

•   Once the motion is filed, the court must conduct a hearing to determine whether or not probable cause 
exists to believe that the child has a mental illness.  In making its determination on the issue of probable 
cause,  the court can consider  the  motion, supporting documents, professional statements of counsel, 
witness testimony, and the court’s own observation of the child.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.11(a).

Observation of the Child

Because the statute allows for the court to use observations of the child in its probable cause determination, 
it  is  important  that  the  court  monitor  how  the  child  interacts  with  others,  including  parents,  guardians, 
caregivers,  lawyers,  as  well  as  other  court  participants.    The  court  can  also  observe  the  child’s  physical 
appearance,  including  whether  the  child  is  appropriately  dressed,  well-nourished,  and  practicing  proper 
hygiene.

•   If the court determines that probable cause exists to believe that the child has a mental illness, then all 
juvenile court proceedings must be temporarily stayed, and the judge must order the child to be examined 
for mental illness.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.11(b).
 ◦

The information obtained from the examination must include: expert opinion133  as to whether the child 
 
has a  mental  illness; and whether  the child  meets  the commitment criteria  under Texas  Health and 
Safety Code Subtitle C (sections 574.034, 574.0345, 574.045, and 574.0455).  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.11(b).

 ◦

The information may also include expert opinion as to whether or not the child is unfit to proceed with 
 
the juvenile court proceedings.  However, the court must specifically order the determination of fitness 
to  proceed,  and  this  issue  is  neither  automatically  raised  by  the  suggestion  of  mental  illness,  nor  is 
unfitness to proceed a prerequisite for mental health services.  Tex. Fam. Code §§ 51.20, 55.11(b), (c).

•   Once the court receives the report from the examination of the child, and after considering all relevant 
information, including the report, the court must determine whether or not evidence exists to support 
a finding that the child has a mental illness and that the child meets commitment criteria under Texas 
Health and Safety Code Subtitle C (sections 574.034, 574.0345, 574.045, and 574.0455).

•   If the court determines that evidence does not exist to support a finding that the child has a mental illness 
or that the child does not meet the commitment criteria, the judge must dissolve the stay and continue 
the juvenile court proceedings as if the issue had not been raised.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.11(c)(2).

1.2  Mental Illness Plus Commitment Criteria

If the court determines that evidence exists to support a finding that the child has a mental illness and that the 
child meets the commitment criteria as discussed below, the judge must proceed as follows:

•   Initiate proceedings in juvenile court to order temporary or extended mental health services, as provided 
in Texas Health and Safety Code Subchapter C (sections 574.034, 574.0345, 574.045, and 574.0455); or

•   Refer the child’s case to the appropriate probate court for the initiation of proceedings in that court for 
commitment of the child under Texas Health and Safety Code Subchapter C (sections 574.034, 574.0345, 
574.045, and 574.0455).

Tex. Fam. Code § 55.12.

133  The expert opinion can be from a psychologist (see Texas Family Code section 51.20(a)); however, if the child meets the criteria for hospitaliza-
tion, it will be necessary to have a medical doctor evaluate the child, as a Certified Medical Examination (CME) is required.

Juvenile Court or Probate Court

The  choice  of  whether  to  proceed  with  commitment  in  juvenile  court  or  to  refer  the  proceedings  to  a 
county or probate court rests exclusively with the juvenile court.  A juvenile court that hears commitment 
proceedings infrequently may prefer to have the county or probate court conduct them.  The standards for 
commitment are the same, regardless of which court holds the hearing.  County or probate courts may have 
more frequent interaction with community-based treatment options, private placements, and state facilities.  
Judges in a community can discuss available resources to determine which approach is advantageous for 
their constituents.

1.3 

Commitment Proceedings Referred to Appropriate County or Probate Court

If the case is referred to an appropriate county or probate court, the judge of that court completes the commitment 
hearing process.  The juvenile court must send all papers relating to the child’s mental illness to both the clerk of 
the court to which the case is referred, and to the office of the appropriate county or district attorney.  Tex. Fam. 
Code §§ 55.14(a)(1), (2).  The papers sent to the clerk of a court constitute an application for mental health services 
under Section 574.001, Health and Safety Code.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.15(b).

If the child is in detention, the judge has three options:

•   Order the child released from detention to the child’s home or another appropriate place;

•   Order the child detained in an appropriate place other than a juvenile detention facility; or

•   If an appropriate place is not available, order the child to remain in the juvenile detention facility subject 

to further detention orders of the court.  

Tex. Fam. Code § 55.14(a)(3).

The juvenile court proceedings are stayed until the proceedings in county or probate court are completed with 
a  finding  of  no  mental  illness,  or  the  child  is  returned  from  temporary  or  extended  mental  health  services.   
Tex. Fam. Code §§ 55.16(a), 55.17(a).

1.4 

Application for Court-Ordered Mental Health Services

•   Either  the  prosecutor  or  the  child’s  attorney  can  file  an  application  for  court-ordered  mental  health 

services under Section 574.001, Health and Safety Code.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.13(a).

•   The application must be filed in the county where the child resides or is found.  Tex. Health & Safety Code 

§ 574.001(b).

•   If the child is in the custody of the Texas Juvenile Justice Department, the application can be filed in the 
county in which the child’s commitment to TJJD was ordered.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.001(f).

What Should be Included in the Application

An application must:

•   Be styled using the child’s initials and not the proposed patient’s full name;

•   State whether the application is for temporary or extended services;

•   The child’s name, address, and county of residence in Texas;

•   A statement that the child is a person with mental illness and meets the criteria in Chapter 574 for court-

ordered mental health services; and

•   Whether the child is charged with a criminal offense.

Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 574.002(b), (c).

Application Requirements for Extended v. Temporary Court-Ordered Services

Applications for extended court-ordered services have several statutory requirements that applications for 
temporary court-ordered services do not require.

 ■  An application for extended inpatient mental health services must state that the child has received:

 —  Court-ordered  inpatient  mental  health  services  under  either  this  subtitle  or  under  Chapter  46B, 
Subchapter  D  of  the  Texas  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  (Procedures  after  Determination  of 
Incompetency)  or  Subchapter  E  (Civil  Commitment:  Charges  Pending)  for  at  least  60  consecutive 
days during the prior 12 months.

 ■  An  application  for  extended  outpatient  mental  health  services  must  state  that  the  child  has 

received:

 —  Court-ordered  inpatient  mental  health  services  under  either  this  subtitle  or  under  Chapter  46B, 
Subchapter D or E of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure for a total of at least 60 days during the 
prior 12 months; OR

 —  Court-ordered outpatient mental health services under this subtitle or Chapter 46B, Subchapters D 

or E during the preceding 60 days.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.002(b).

1.5 

Appointment and Duties of an Attorney under HSC 574.004

•   The judge must appoint an attorney for the child within 24 hours after the application is filed unless the 

child already has an attorney.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.003(a).

•   Texas codifies the duties that an attorney has toward a client in a court-ordered services proceeding in 
section 574.004, and the court is required to give a copy of these duties to every court-appointed attorney.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.003(b). 

The Statutory Responsibility of Attorneys in Commitment Cases

The requirements set forth in section 574.004 of the Texas Health and Safety Code were the result of publicity 
surrounding the actions of some court-appointed lawyers who were not communicating with adult clients 
before hearings, or were conducting group interviews with multiple adult clients.  “The publicity surrounding 
such  inappropriate  and  inadequate  representation  caused  the  Legislature  to  strengthen  the  rights  of 
patients.”134   

Note  that  the  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  governing  attorneys  comment  specifically  on  the  attention 
and  respect  that  is  to  be  given  to  every  client,  regardless  of  whether  the  client  has  with  a  mental  illness.  
Comment 5 to Rule 1.02 of the TDRPC states: “When a lawyer reasonably believes a client suffers a mental 
disability or is not legally competent, it may not be possible to maintain the usual attorney-client relationship.  
Nevertheless, the client may have the ability to understand, deliberate upon, and reach conclusions about 
some matters affecting the client’s own well-being… the fact that a client [has] a disability does not diminish 
the desirability of treating the client with attention and respect.”

•   Included  in  the  list of duties owed  by  the attorney  to  the  proposed  patient  is  that  the attorney  must 
respect the client’s decision to agree or resist the efforts to provide mental health services, even though 
they  may personally disagree with the client’s wishes.   Though the attorney  may provide counsel, the 
attorney must abide by the client’s final decision on the matter.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.004(c).

1.6 

Setting the Hearing

•   The court  must set a  hearing within  14 days of  the date  the application was  filed  but  may  not  hold a 
hearing  within  the  first  three  days  after  the  application  is  filed,  if  the  child  or  their  attorney  objects.   
Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 574.005(a), (b).
 ◦

 
There are witnesses who may appear at the hearing to present evidence, who may be unknown to the 
parties prior to the hearing date.  If either party wishes, they may request a continuance  based on 
surprise and the court may continue the hearing date.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.006(d).

•   While the court may grant continuances of the hearing, the final hearing must be held no later than 30 
days from the date the application was filed.  The only exception is for extreme weather or disaster, in 
which case the judge may, by a written order each day, postpone the hearing for 24 hours.  Tex. Health & 
Safety Code § 574.005(c).

1.7 

Notice of the Hearing

•   The child and their attorney are entitled to receive a copy of the application and written notice of the 
court hearing immediately after it is set.  Notice must also be delivered in person or via certified mail to 
the child’s:
 ◦
 ◦
 ◦

Each managing and possessory conservator, if applicable.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.006(b).
 

Appointed guardian, if applicable; or
 

Parent, if a minor; or
 

•   If a parent cannot be located, and the child does not have a guardian or conservator, the notice may be 

given to the proposed patient’s next of kin.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.006(c).

1.8  Medical Examination Requirement

•   The judge must appoint the number of physicians necessary (at least two) to examine the child and to 
complete the certificates of medical examination (CMEs) for mental illness required by Section 574.009, 
Health and Safety Code.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.13(c).
 ◦

 
The two CMEs must be completed by different physicians, from examinations that occurred within the 
preceding 30 days, and are required to be on file with the court.  At least one of the physicians must be 
a psychiatrist, if a psychiatrist is available in the county.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.009(a).

•   The court also  has  the authority  to order an  independent evaluation of  the child,  by a  psychiatrist of 
the child’s choosing, if the court feels it will assist the finder of fact.  If the child is indigent, the county 
may  reimburse  the child’s appointed attorney  for any expenses  incurred  in  securing  the  psychiatrist’s 
testimony.  Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 574.010(a), (b).

What Should a CME for Mental Illness Include?

1.  Name and address of examining physician

2.  Name and address of the child examined

3.  Date and place of examination

4.  Brief diagnosis of the child’s physical and mental condition

5.  The time period, if any, the child has been under the physician’s care

6.  A description of the mental health treatment the examining physician has given to the child, if any

7.  The examining physician’s opinion that:

a.  The child is a person with mental illness; and

b.  As a result of that illness the child is likely to cause serious harm to the child or to others or is:

i. 

Suffering severe and abnormal mental, emotional, or physical distress;

ii.  Experiencing  substantial  mental  or  physical  deterioration  of  the  child’s  ability  to  function 

independently, exhibited by the inability to provide for basic needs; and

iii.  Not able to make a rational and informed decision as to whether to submit to treatment.

The examining physician must be as specific and detailed as possible as to which criterion forms the basis of 
their opinion, and if it is offered in support of an application for extended court-ordered services, must state 
that the child’s condition is likely to continue for more than 90 days.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.011.

Proceedings for Court-Ordered Mental Health Services

Legislative Change

S.B. 362 (86th Reg. Sess. (2019)) added sections 574.0345 and 574.0355 of the Texas Health and 
Safety  Code.    The  bill  took  the  temporary  and  extended  inpatient,  and  the  temporary  and 
extended  outpatient  commitment  procedures  that  were  contained  in  sections  574.034  and 
574.035 and divided them so that there is now one section for each procedure.

 ■  Section 574.034: Order for Temporary Inpatient Mental Health Services

 ■  Section 574.0345: Order for Temporary Outpatient Mental Health Services

 ■  Section 574.035: Order for Extended Inpatient Mental Health Services

1.9a  General Hearing Provisions

Health & Safety Code § 574.031(c).

•   The child is entitled to be present at the hearing, but the child or their attorney may waive this right.  Tex. 

•   The hearing must be open to the public unless the child or their attorney request that it be closed, and the 

court finds good cause to do so.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(d).
 ◦

Generally, juvenile court proceedings are open to the public unless good cause is shown to exclude the 
 
public.  Tex. Fam. Code § 54.08(a).

 ◦

 
If a child is under the age of 14 at the time of the hearing, the court shall close the hearing to the 
public, unless the court finds that the interests of the child or the public would be better served by 
opening the hearing to the public.  Tex. Fam. Code § 54.08(c).

•   In a hearing for temporary inpatient or outpatient mental health services, the child or their attorney may 
waive the right to cross-examine witnesses by filing a written waiver with the court.  If that right is waived, 
the court may admit the CMEs as evidence, the CMEs will constitute competent medical or psychiatric 
testimony, and the court can make its findings based solely on the CMEs.  Tex. Health & Safety Code  
§ 574.031(d-1).

•   In a hearing for extended inpatient or outpatient mental health services, the court must hear testimony 

and cannot make findings solely from the CMEs.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(d-2).

Legislative Change

S.B.  362  (86th  Reg.  Sess.  (2019))  added  subsections  (d-1)  and  (d-2)  to  section  574.031  of  the 
Texas Health and Safety Code.  These provisions about the right to waive cross-examination of 
witnesses  were  originally  in  sections  574.034  and  574.035  but  were  pulled  out  as  separate 
subsections.    Additionally,  the  original  statute  stated  that  a  patient  AND  a  patient’s  attorney 
may, by written document, waive the right to cross-examination of witnesses.  The amended 
statute replaces AND with OR, but as stated above in the duties of the attorney, attorneys must consult and 
comply with their client’s wishes.

The  bill  also  removed  subsections  in  574.034  and  574.035  regarding  admitting  the  CME  as  evidence  and 
consolidates the language into subsections 574.031(d-1) and (d-2).

•   Unlike the probable cause hearing, the final hearing is governed by the Texas Rules of Evidence unless 

otherwise stated in this subtitle.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(e).

•   Each  element  of  the  applicable  criteria  must  be  proven  by  clear and convincing evidence,  and  the 

hearing must be on the record.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(g).

•   The  court  may  consider  the  testimony  of  a  non-physician  mental  health  professional  in  addition  to 

medical or psychiatric testimony.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(f).

•   The  hearing  for  temporary  mental  health  services  must  be  before  the  court  unless  the  child  or  their 
attorney requests a jury trial.  A hearing for extended mental health services must be in front of a jury 
unless waived by the child or their attorney.  The waiver must be sworn and signed unless orally made in 
the court’s presence.  Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 574.032(a), (b), and (c).  The court may allow a jury 
waiver to be withdrawn for good cause shown no later than the eighth day before the hearing.  Tex. Health 
& Safety Code § 574.032(d).
 ◦

 
If the hearing is before a jury, the jury must determine if the child is a person with mental illness and 
meets the criteria for court-ordered services; however, the jury cannot make a finding regarding the 
type of services to be provided.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.032(f).

•   The party who filed the application has the burden of proof.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.13(b).

•   After conducting the hearing, the juvenile court shall:

 ◦

If the criteria under Section 574.034 or 574.0345, Health and Safety Code, are satisfied, order temporary

 ◦

If the criteria under Section 574.035 or 574.0355, Health and Safety Code, are satisfied, order extended 
 
mental health services for the child.

Tex. Fam. Code § 55.13(d).

1.10a  Order for Temporary Inpatient Mental Health Services under HSC 574.034

•   The judge may order a child to receive court-ordered temporary inpatient mental health services only if 

the judge or jury finds, from clear and convincing evidence, that:
 ◦
 ◦

The child is a person with mental illness; and
 

As a result of that mental illness the child:
 

•   Is likely to cause serious harm to themselves;

•   Is likely to cause serious harm to others; or

•   Is:

 ◦
 ◦

 ◦

Suffering severe and abnormal mental, emotional, or physical distress;
 

Experiencing  substantial  mental  or  physical  deterioration  of  their  ability  to  function 
 
independently, which is exhibited by the child’s inability, except for reasons of indigence, 
to provide for the child’s basic needs, including food, clothing, health, or safety; and

 
unable  to  make  a  rational  and  informed  decision  as  to  whether  or  not  to  submit  to 
treatment.

•   Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.034(a).

•   The judge or jury must specify which criteria form the basis for the decision, should the judge or jury 

decide the child meets the commitment criteria.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.034(c).

Orders that Clearly Specify Commitment Criteria

The Health and Safety Code requires that orders for temporary or extended inpatient treatment must specify 
upon which criteria the judge or jury is basing their decision.  There is conflicting case law in this area.  Some 
appellate courts have allowed an order to submit the criteria in the disjunctive (i.e. listing the criteria with 
OR), while other courts have found that listing the criteria in the conjunctive (with AND) is the only way to 
ensure that there are specific findings.135 

A  suggested  practice  to  avoid  any  confusion  is  to  take  the  word  “or”  out  of  any  order  for  temporary  or

actually harmful or demonstrate that harm to others is imminent.  The case also states that speech alone may be considered an overt act.  State 
v. K.E.W., 315 S.W.3d 16, 24 (Tex. 2010).

Legislative Change

S.B.  362  (86th  Reg.  Sess.  (2019))  amended  section  574.034(g)  of  the  Texas  Health  and  Safety 
Code.  The court must now provide a definitive time period in its order for temporary inpatient 
treatment not to exceed 45 days, or 90 days if the judge finds it necessary.

The  bill  also  amended subsection  574.035(h) of  the  Texas  Health  and Safety  Code,  requiring 
that for extended inpatient treatment, the court must also include a definitive time period in its order not 
to exceed 12 months.  This allows the court to consider a shorter time period than 12 months, which was 
previously not allowed under the statute.

Note that a facility must still release a person if they no longer meet commitment criteria, even if the court-
mandated  time  period  has  not  elapsed.    O’Connor  v.  Donaldson,  422  U.S.  563,  574-75(1975)  (“even  if  his 
involuntary confinement was initially permissible, it could not constitutionally continue after that basis no 
longer existed.”)

1.10b  Order for Temporary Outpatient Mental Health Services under HSC 574.0345

•   The judge may order a child to receive court-ordered temporary outpatient services only if:

The judge finds that appropriate mental health services are available to the child; and
 

 ◦
 ◦

The judge or jury finds, from clear and convincing evidence, that:
 

•   The child is a person with severe and persistent mental illness;

•   As a result of the mental illness, the child will, if not treated, experience deterioration of the 
ability to function independently to the extent that the child will be unable to live safely in the 
community without court-ordered outpatient mental health services;

•   Outpatient mental health services are needed to prevent a relapse that would likely result in 

serious harm to the child or others; and

•   The  child  has  an  inability  to  participate  in  outpatient  treatment  services  effectively  and 

voluntarily, demonstrated by:

 ◦

 ◦

 
Any of the child’s actions occurring within the two-year period that immediately precedes 
the hearing; or

 
Specific  characteristics  of  the  child’s  clinical  condition  that  significantly  impair  the 
child’s ability to make a rational and informed decision whether to submit to voluntary 
outpatient treatment.

Legislative Change

S.B. 362 (86th Reg. Sess. (2019)) removed the former requirement for outpatient treatment that 
a court must find the patient “will continue to suffer severe and abnormal mental, emotional, or 
physical distress” and replaced it with the requirement in new sections 574.0345 and 574.0355 
that  the  court  find  “outpatient  mental  health  services  are  needed  to  prevent  a  relapse  that 
would likely result in serious harm to the proposed patient or others.”

New sections 574.0345 and 574.0355 also change the requirement for a court to order outpatient treatment; 
previously the court had to find that the patient’s clinical condition “makes impossible” the ability to make 
rational and informed decisions.  As amended, a court must find that the patient’s condition “significantly 
impairs” that ability.

1.10c  Order for Extended Inpatient Mental Health Services under HSC 574.035

•   The judge may order a child to receive court-ordered extended inpatient mental health services only if the 

jury, or the judge if the right to a jury is waived, finds, from clear and convincing evidence, that:

1.  The child is a person with mental illness;

2.  As a result of that mental illness the child:

A.  Is likely to cause serious harm to the child;

B.  Is likely to cause serious harm to others; or

C.  Is:

i.  Suffering severe and abnormal mental, emotional, or physical distress;

ii.  Experiencing  substantial  mental  or  physical  deterioration  of  the  child’s  ability  to 
function independently, which is exhibited by the child’s inability, except for reasons 
of indigence, to provide for the child’s basic needs, including food, clothing, health, 
or safety; and

iii. Unable to make a rational and informed decision as to whether or not to submit to 

treatment;

3.  The child’s condition is expected to continue for more than 90 days; and

4.  The child  has  received court-ordered  inpatient  mental  health services  under  this subtitle or

preceding 12 months.  

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.035(a).

•   If the jury or judge finds that the child meets the commitment criteria listed above, the jury or judge must 
specify which criterion listed in Subsection (a)(2) forms the basis for the decision.  Tex. Health & Safety 
Code § 574.035(c).

•   The jury or judge is not required to make the finding under Subsection (a)(4) if the child has already been 

subject to an order for extended mental health services.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.035(d).

Open and Frequent Communication Between Courts and LMHAs/LBHAs

In  order  to  maintain  the  most  up-to-date  information  about  the  availability  of  outpatient  commitment 
services, courts should ensure that they are familiar with their LMHA/LBHA and have a contact person who 
can provide them with available resources.

1.11  Mental Health Services Not Ordered

•   If the juvenile court, or the county or probate court to which the child’s case was referred does not order 
temporary or extended inpatient mental health services for the child, the court must dissolve the stay 
and continue the juvenile court proceedings.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.17(b).

•   The § 51.20 report should be helpful to the parties in determining how to proceed with the case, and in 

considering what disposition or treatment options would be beneficial for the child.  
 ◦

 
Options include: evaluation for inclusion in a specialty court, diversion program, Deferred Prosecution 
Program, or deferral of the finding of True / Not True while the child receives treatment.

1.12  Discharge from Mental Health Facility Before Reaching 18 Years of Age

•   If the child is discharged from the mental health facility before reaching 18 years of age, the juvenile court 
may dismiss the juvenile court proceedings with prejudice; or continue with proceedings as though no 
order of mental health services had been made.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.18.

trial, they cannot receive a punishment that results in confinement for a period longer than what they 
could have received, had they been adjudicated in juvenile court.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.19(b).

The juvenile court has to notify the mental health facility of the transfer.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.19(b).

2. Specialty Courts

Specialty courts focus on treating the underlying issues that may be causing delinquent behavior.  Mental health 
courts are a type of specialty court.    Both pre-adjudication and post-adjudication  mental  health courts are  in 
practice in Texas.  They combine accountability through judicial supervision with treatment and other support 
services to prevent recidivism and improve the lives of their participants.  Although counties with a population of 
more than 200,000 are required to establish a mental health court under section 125.005 of the Texas Government 
Code, the requirement does not appear to apply to juvenile courts.  

The benefits of a juvenile mental health court are many: such a program will keep children close to home and 
family,  provide  services  in  the  community,  connect  families  to  resources  that  they  can  use  after  the  program 
concludes, and  reduce  recidivism  by  treating  the cause of  the  behavior  instead of  the symptoms.    Finally, an 
effective juvenile mental health court can save a jurisdiction the high costs associated with placing a child in a 
Residential Treatment Center or committing a child to TJJD.

Reflection Point

Consider  whether  family  resources  impact  which  youth  are  provided  with  opportunities  to 
participate in diversion programs or services.

2.1 

Statutory Requirements

A “mental health court program” has the following essential characteristics:

•  Integrates and provides access to MI and ID treatment services in processing cases in the court system;

•  Uses a  non-adversarial approach  involving  prosecutors and defense attorneys  to  both  promote  public

safety and to protect the due process rights of program participants;

•  Promotes early identification and prompt placement of eligible participants in the program;

•  Requires ongoing judicial interaction with program participants;

•  Diverts people with MI or ID to needed services in lieu of prosecution;

•  Monitors and evaluates program goals and effectiveness;

•  Facilitates continuing interdisciplinary education on effective program planning, implementation, and

•  Develops partnerships with public agencies and community organizations, including LMHAs/LBHAs.

operations; and

Tex. Gov’t. Code § 125.001(a).

Regional Mental Health Courts

Note that the commissioners courts of two or more counties may elect to establish a regional mental health 
court program for the participating counties.  Tex. Gov’t. Code § 125.0025.  Smaller jurisdictions may find it 
advantageous to collaborate on the creation of a mental health court to share costs and resources.

In addition to the statutory requirements, an effective juvenile mental health court will feature developmentally 
appropriate and trauma-informed procedures and services.

Seven Common Characteristics of Juvenile Mental Health Courts137 

Following a national study funded by the National Institute of Justice, seven common characteristics of a juvenile 
mental health court were identified:

1.  Regularly-scheduled special docket;

2.  Less formal style of interaction among court official and participants;

3.  Age-appropriate screening and assessment for trauma, substance use, and mental disorder;

4.  Team management of participant’s treatment and supervision;

5.  System-wide accountability enforced by the juvenile court;

6.  Use of graduated incentives and sanctions; and

7.  Defined criteria for program success.

Creating a Juvenile Mental Health Court

Money, time, and community support: establishing a specialty court brings many challenges, but none that 
are insurmountable.  These resources provide guidance on creating a mental health court in your jurisdiction:

3.  Pretrial Intervention Programs  

Many of the same mental health interventions that are available to children on juvenile probation are available to 
children who participate in deferred prosecution or other diversion programs.  If a child has yet to receive any kind of 
interventions, it is usually in the child’s best interest to address their needs through the least restrictive means available.  

Most of the juvenile probation departments in Texas act as the “Intake” office, under a local agreement with the 
prosecutor’s office and approved by the juvenile board.  These agreements allow juvenile probation officers to 
screen and divert certain non-serious cases out of the juvenile court system.  

The intake officer is required to determine whether the person referred to juvenile court is a child; and whether there 
is probable cause to believe that the person engaged in delinquent conduct or CINS. Tex. Fam. Code § 53.01(a).  After 
those determinations are made, the intake officer can take several actions to close or divert a child’s case.  

3.1 

Supervisory Caution

Supervisory Caution, sometimes known as “counsel and release,” is a non-legal term for a variety of informal, 
non-judicial dispositions that can occur in a juvenile case.  Supervisory caution can involve referring the child to 
a social services agency, contacting parents to inform them of the child’s activities, or simply warning the child 
about their behavior.143   

3.2 

Deferred Prosecution Programs

Deferred prosecution programs (DPPs) are an alternative to formal adjudication of delinquent conduct or CINS, 
and involve a six-month supervision period.  A child can receive up to two 6-month terms of DPP, not to exceed 
a total of 12 months.  

•   DPP must be in the best interest of the public and the child;

•   The child and their parent, guardian, or custodian must consent to DPP, with knowledge that consent is 

•   The child and their parent, guardian, or custodian must be informed that they can terminate DPP at any 

time and ask the court for a court hearing in the case.

voluntary;

Tex. Fam. Code § 53.03(a).

A probation officer can offer DPP for any offense that is not disqualified by these requirements:

•   any offense that is required to be forwarded to the prosecutor: felonies, misdemeanors involving violence 
to a person, and misdemeanors involving the use or possession of a firearm, location-restricted knife, 
club, or prohibited weapon;

•   a child who has been previously adjudicated of a felony, unless the prosecutor gives written approval.

Tex. Fam. Code § 53.03(e).

A prosecutor can offer DPP to any child, unless the child is alleged to have engaged in conduct that that constitutes 
the following intoxication-related offenses:

•   DWI,  Flying  While  Intoxicated,  Boating  While  Intoxicated,  Intoxication  Assault,  Intoxication 
Manslaughter,  Consumption of Alcohol  by a  Minor  3rd, or  Driving or  Operating Watercraft under  the 
Influence of Alcohol by a Minor 3rd.

Tex. Fam. Code § 53.03(g).

A judge can offer DPP at any time that is:

•   Before the jury is sworn, for an adjudication to be decided by jury trial;

•   Before the first witness is called, for an adjudication to be decided by the court;

•   Before the child pleads to the petition or before the stipulation of evidence, for an uncontested adjudication.

Tex. Fam. Code § 53.03(i).

9/3/2021   10:07:52 AM

In determining whether to grant DPP, the court can consider professional representations by the parties concerning 
the nature and background of the case.  These representations are not admissible against the child at trial, should 
the court reject the request for DPP.  Tex. Fam. Code § 53.03(k).  The court can add a period of time to a previous 
order of DPP, but the total combined length of DPP cannot exceed one year.

3.3 

Referral to a Community Resource Coordination Group (CRCG)

The community referral and service plan is one method for diverting the youngest children out of the juvenile 
court system.

•   The intake officer must refer the child’s case to a CRCG if it is determined that:

The child is younger than 12 years of age;
 

There is probable cause to believe the child engaged in delinquent conduct or CINS;
 

The child’s case does not require referral to the prosecutor under an alternate referral plan;
 

The child is eligible for DPP under Section 53.03; and
 

 
The child and their family are not currently receiving services from a CRCG and would benefit from 
receiving the services.

 ◦
 ◦
 ◦
 ◦
 ◦

Tex. Fam. Code § 53.01(b-1).

•   The CRCG must evaluate the child’s case and make recommendations to the juvenile probation department 

for appropriate services for the child and their family.  Tex. Fam. Code § 53.011(b).

•   The  probation  officer  must  create  a  service  plan  or  system  of  care  for  the  child  or  their  family  that 
incorporates  the  CRCG’s  recommendations.    The child and  their  parent, guardian, or custodian  must 
consent to the services with knowledge that consent is voluntary.  Tex. Fam. Code § 53.011(c).

•   The probation officer can hold the child’s case open for up to three months to monitor compliance with 
the service plan and can adjust the plan as needed.  If the child fails to successfully participate in the 
services, the probation officer can refer the child to the prosecutor.  Tex. Fam. Code § 53.011(d).

3.4 

Teen Dating Violence Program

A Teen Dating Violence Program must be approved by the juvenile court and the commissioners court, and must 
include:

•   A 12-week program designed to educate children who engage in dating violence and encourage them to 

refrain from engaging in that conduct;

•   A  dedicated  teen victim  advocate  who  assists  teen victims  by  offering  referrals  to  additional  services, 

providing counseling and safety planning, and explaining the juvenile justice system;

•   A court-employed resource coordinator to monitor children’s compliance with the 12-week program;

•   One judge who presides over all of the cases in the jurisdiction that qualify for the program; and

•   A prosecuting attorney who is assigned to the program.

Tex. Fam Code § 54.0325(a).

On the prosecutor’s recommendation, the court can defer adjudication proceedings for not more than 180 days if 
the child is a first offender who is alleged to have engaged in conduct that is a misdemeanor and involves dating 
violence.   Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  54.0325(b).   A child  is a  “first offender”  if they  have  not  been previously referred 
to juvenile court for allegedly engaging in conduct constituting dating violence, family violence, or an assault.   
Tex. Fam. Code § 54.0325(c).

•   The  child  must  complete  the  program  before  the  end  of  the  deferral  period  and  appear  in  court  for 

monthly monitoring.  Tex. Fam. Code § 54.0325(e).

•   Upon evidence of successful completion of the program, the case is dismissed with prejudice.  Tex. Fam. 

Code § 54.0325(f).

3.5 

Trafficked Persons Program

A juvenile court can defer adjudication proceedings until the child’s 18th birthday, and require a child to participate 
in a program established under Section 152.0017, Human Resources Code, if the child is alleged to have engaged 
in delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision, and may be a victim of Human Trafficking 
under Section 20A.02, Penal Code; and makes an oral or written request to the court to participate in the program.  
Once the court receives evidence of successful completion of the program, the court shall dismiss the case with 
prejudice.  Tex. Fam. Code § 54.0326.

Commercial Sexual Exploitation – Identification Tool

75% of trafficked youth are exploited for two or more years before their abuse is recognized.144   Most trafficked 
youth are under the age of 14 when first exploited, unaware of the dangerousness of their situation, and 
unaware of the exploitative nature of their relationship with their pimp or exploiter.145   When youth do not 
recognize that they are being abused, they cannot disclose the abuse to a trusted adult.  Intake interviews 
conducted  by  juvenile  probation  departments  and  juvenile  detention  centers  provide  an  opportunity  for 
youth to be screened for trafficking. 

WestCoast  Children’s  Clinic146    developed  the  Commercial  Sexual  Exploitation  –  Identification  Tool  (CSE-IT  – 
pronounced “see it”), a screening tool that aids in detection of risk of sexual exploitation.147   Already in use by 
35 child welfare agencies and 29 juvenile probation departments across the country, the CSE-IT is validated148 
and it works.149   Over 88,400 youth have been screened for signs of sex trafficking, and 8200 youth have been 
identified with clear indicators of trafficking.150   

WestCoast provides free training and technical support to organizations seeking to implement the CSE-IT.  
DFPS personnel in Bexar, Dallas, Harris, Tarrant, and Travis counties already use the CSE-IT as part of their 
Human  Trafficking  Response  Protocol.151      More  information  on  the  CSE-IT  can  be  found  at:  https://www.
westcoastcc.org/cse-it/

The Texas Human Trafficking Resource Center152  and the HHSC “Provider Guidebook: Services for Victims 
of Human Trafficking in Texas”153  offer additional guidance and resources for those who work with youth at 
risk of human trafficking.

4.  Justice and Municipal Courts

Justice and municipal courts have jurisdiction over fine-only misdemeanors that are not punishable by confinement 
in jail or imprisonment.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. arts. 4.11, 4.14.  These cases consist of traffic offenses, fine-only 
misdemeanors more commonly known as “Class C Misdemeanors,” alcohol and tobacco violations, and truancy 
cases.  In Texas, most cases alleging law violations by children are filed in justice or municipal courts.154   Generally, 
these cases can be efficiently handled by justice and municipal courts and are not serious enough to involve the 
juvenile court.155 

Detailed  information on  justice and  municipal court procedures can  be  found  in  the Texas  Municipal  Courts 
Education Center’s 2020 Bench Book,156  and in the Texas Justice Court Training Center’s Criminal Procedure, 2nd 
Edition.157   Justice and municipal court procedures specifically relating to juveniles are covered in Texas Juvenile 
Law, 9th Edition.158   

This  bench  book  focuses  on  diversions,  supports,  and  services  for  justice  system-involved  youth  with  MI  or 
ID.  Justice and municipal courts face the challenge of a disproportionately large caseload and a small pool of 
diversions, supports, and resources with which to work.  Compounding the challenge, the majority of children 
who appear in justice and municipal courts are not represented by counsel and are accompanied only by their 
parent or guardian.  

It is imperative that the court ask whether the child intends to hire an attorney, and, if the answer is no, explain 
the child’s rights, the charge, the plea options, and the possible dispositions.  The court can remind the parent or 
guardian that the case can be reset to a later date to allow time to retain counsel.  In addition to making sure that 
child understands the consequences of each plea, the court must explain the expunction process to the parent and 
child and provide a copy of the expunction statute.  Once the judge is satisfied that the process has been carefully 
and thoroughly explained, the court should request the juvenile to enter a plea of either not guilty, no contest, or 
guilty.

In some instances, it may be apparent either from case facts or interaction with the child that there is a MI or IDD 
issue at play. In those circumstances, consider asking questions that could bring MI or IDD issues to the surface 
for consideration in setting rehabilitative sanctions. These questions may include:

•   Do you receive any services at school?

•   Do you have an IEP or a BIP?

•   Do you receive any support at your school that I should know about?

•   Does the support you receive affect your education?

•   Do you go to an ARD committee?

If the judge feels the issue requires more attention, the court can order school records and an evaluation.  An 
evaluation may already exist where the child is receiving services.  In some cases, it may be apparent the child is 
affected by MI or IDD, but that their issues are going unaddressed, and the judge should ask why the child is not 
receiving services.  If the judge feels that there is a legitimate concern for the child’s welfare, the judge has a duty 
to make a report to DFPS.

4.1 

Age Affecting Criminal Responsibility

Texas Penal Code section 8.07 gives children between the ages of 10 and 14 the presumption of being incapable of 
committing fine-only misdemeanors, other than traffic offenses and curfew ordinance violations.

This presumption can be refuted if the prosecution proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the child 
had sufficient capacity to understand that the conduct engaged in was wrong at the time the conduct was engaged 
in.  Tex. Penal Code § 8.07(e).  

Note: the prosecutor can meet their burden by holding a brief hearing at the bench, before the child enters a 
plea.  This hearing is not about the facts of the case, so the prosecutor should not be permitted to ask questions 
about the facts of the case.  The prosecutor can ask questions of the child, about their understanding of right and 
wrong; and of the parent or guardian as well.  Questions about the child’s mental or emotional health, diagnoses, 
and school accommodations or plans may also assist the court in determining whether the burden has been met 
to proceed.

4.2 

Child with Mental Illness, Disability, or Lack of Capacity and Class C Misdemeanors

Texas  Penal  Code  section  8.08  gives  courts  that  have  jurisdiction  over  Class  C  misdemeanors  and  municipal 
ordinance violations a mechanism for the dismissal of cases involving children with diminished capacity.

•   When a motion is made, the court must determine whether probable cause exists to believe that a child, 

including a child with a mental illness or developmental disability 159:

1.  Lacks  the  capacity  to  understand  the  proceedings  in  criminal  court  or  to  assist  in  the  child’s  own 

defense and is unfit to proceed; or

2.  Lacks  substantial  capacity  either  to  appreciate  the  wrongfulness  of  the  child’s  own  conduct  or  to 

conform the child’s conduct to the requirement of the law.

•   The state, the defendant, the defendant’s parent or guardian, or the court can make the motion.

•   If the court determines that probable cause exists that the child is unfit to proceed or lacks substantial 

capacity, the court can dismiss the case after providing notice to the state.

Tex. Penal Code § 8.08.

4.3 

Child with Mental Illness and Truancy Cases

Texas  Family  Code  section  65.065  gives  courts  that  have  jurisdiction  over  truancy  cases  a  mechanism  for  the 
dismissal of cases involving children with mental illness, as defined by Section 571.003, Health and Safety Code.160 

•   When a motion is made, the court must temporarily stay the proceedings to determine whether probable 

cause exists to believe that the child has a mental illness.  The court may:

1.  Consider  the  motion,  supporting  documents,  professional  statements  of  counsel,  and  witness 

testimony; and

2.  Observe the child.

Tex. Fam. Code § 65.065.

•   If  the court determines  that  probable cause exists  that  the child  has a  mental  illness,  the court  must 
dismiss the case.  If the court does not so find, then the court must dissolve the stay and continue with 
truancy court proceedings.

4.4 

Deferred Disposition of Class C Misdemeanors

Following a plea of guilty or no contest, the court can defer further proceedings without entering an adjudication 
of guilt and place the youth on probation for up to 180 days.  In issuing the order of deferral, the judge may impose 
a fine… the judge may elect not to impose the fine for good cause shown by the defendant.  Tex. Code Crim. 
Proc. art. 45.051(a).  

159  The statute provides that when a child has diminished capacity, the case against the child can be dismissed.  The statute specifically mentions 
children with a mental illness or a developmental disability, but it does not exclude children who have diminished capacity due to other conditions, 
e.g., traumatic brain injury, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, or severe emotional disturbance.

160  “Mental illness” means an illness, disease, or condition, other than epilepsy, dementia, substance abuse, or intellectual disability, that: substan-
tially impairs a person’s thought, perception of reality, emotional process, or judgement; or grossly impairs behavior as demonstrated by recent 
disturbed behavior.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 571.003.

As an alternative to requiring the defendant to pay fines and court costs, the judge may:

•   Allow the defendant to enter into [a payment plan];

•   Require the defendant to perform community service or attend a tutoring program under Article 45.049 

or 45.0492;

•   Waive all or part of those fines and court costs under Article 45.0491; or

As conditions of the probation, the justice of the peace or municipal judge can require a defendant, including a 
juvenile defendant, to:

•   Present to the court satisfactory evidence that they have complied with each requirement imposed by the 

•   Take any combination of the actions above.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 45.051(a-1).

•   Submit to professional counseling;

•   Submit to a psychosocial assessment;

court; and

•   Comply with any other reasonable condition.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 45.051(b).

At the time the juvenile defendant is placed on deferred disposition, the court can impose requirements to continue 
treatment, participate in any assessments reasonably related to providing mental health or IDD services, and to 
comply with all prescribed medications.  

4.5 

Teen Court

Teen Court is a disposition option after a child has pleaded guilty or no contest to an offense in justice or 
municipal  court  in  which  a  jury  of  the  teen’s  peers  decides  what  disposition  is  appropriate.    Teen  court 
“requires the teen to answer personally for [their] wrongdoing.  This helps prevent repeat offenses as the 
defendant will not want to spend more time doing community service or going to teen court.  Also when a 
case is tried in front of juries and lawyers comprised on one’s peers there can be a profound effect on the 
defendant.”161 

Article 45.052 of the Code of Criminal Procedure sets out the rules for teen courts:

a.  A justice or municipal court can defer proceedings against a defendant who is under the age of 18 or enrolled 
full time in an accredited secondary school in a program leading toward a high school diploma for not more 
than 180 days if the defendant:

1.  Is charged with an offense that the court has jurisdiction of under Article 4.11 or 4.14;

2.  Pleads  nolo contendere or guilty  to  the offense  in open court with  the defendant’s parent, guardian, or 

managing conservator present;

3.  Presents to the court an oral or written request to attend a teen court program or is recommended to attend 

the program by a school employee under Section 37.146, Education Code; and

4.  Has not successfully completed a teen court program in the year preceding the date that the alleged offense 

occurred.

b.  The teen court program must be approved by the court.

c.  A  defendant  for  whom  the  proceedings  are  deferred  under  Subsection  (a)  shall  complete  the  teen  court

program not later than the 90th day after the date the teen court hearing to determine punishment is held or 
the last day of the deferral period, whichever date is earlier.  The justice or municipal court shall dismiss the 
charge at the time the defendant presents satisfactory evidence that the defendant has successfully completed 
the teen court program.

The following provisions of Article 45.052 of the Code of Criminal Procedure pertain to court costs associated 
with teen courts:

•   The  justice  or  municipal  court  may  require  a  person  who  requests  a  teen  court  program  to  pay  a 
reimbursement  fee  not  to  exceed  $10  that  is  set  by  the  court  to  cover  the  costs  of  administering  this 
article.  Reimbursement fees collected by a municipal court shall be deposited in the municipal treasury.  
Reimbursement fees collected by a justice court shall be deposited in the county treasury of the county in 
which the court is located.  A person who requests a teen court program and fails to complete the program 
is not entitled to a refund of the fee.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 45.052(e).

•   In addition to the reimbursement fee authorized by Subsection (e), the court may require a child who 
requests  a  teen  court  program  to  pay  a  $10  reimbursement  fee  to  cover  the  cost  to  the  teen  court  for 
performing its duties under this article.  The court shall pay the fee to the teen court program, and the 
teen court program must account to the court for the receipt and disbursal of the fee. A child who pays a 
fee under this subsection is not entitled to a refund of the fee, regardless of whether the child successfully 
completes the teen court program.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 45.052(g).

•   A justice or municipal court may exempt a defendant for whom proceedings are deferred under this 
article from the requirement to pay a court cost or fee that is imposed by another statute.  Tex. Code Crim. 
Proc. art. 45.052(h).

•   Notwithstanding Subsection (e) or (g), a justice or municipal court that is located in the Texas-Louisiana 
border region, as defined by Section 2056.002, Government Code, may charge a reimbursement fee of $20 
under those subsections.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 45.052(i).

4.6 

Juvenile Case Managers (JCMs)

Juvenile Case Managers are employed by some, but not all, justice and municipal courts to assist in administering 
the court’s juvenile docket and provide prevention and intervention services to children.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 
45.056(a)(2).  JCMs are not probation officers; however, they use case management as a tool to reduce recidivism 
and to prevent children from becoming further involved in the justice system.  During an intake meeting with the 
child and their family, JCMs gather information about the family’s needs, identify relevant services, and develop 
goals.  

JCMs can be full-time or part-time employees; can serve several courts; and can serve courts in different counties.  
Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 45.056(a).  

Early Identification of MI or IDD

Because the family intake meetings typically occur before any court appearance, the JCM is well-positioned to 
assess the child’s strengths and deficits, elicit the family’s experience and perspective, and share any concerns for 
MI or IDD with all parties.  Once the court is aware, the judge can determine the voluntariness of any plea that 
is entered.  Once the prosecutor is aware, they can determine how to appropriately resolve the case, so that all 
parties’ interests are best served.  

Community Resources

JCMs are often experts in the services, supports and resources offered by their local communities.  Community 
resource awareness is an essential component in accessing services for children.  Community resources encourage 
the healthy development of juveniles and families through direct services, by addressing the causes of delinquent 
behavior,  reinforcing  accountability,  removing  barriers  to  access,  and  reducing  recidivism.    Services  may  be 
accessed through court referrals, school referrals, and community referrals.  Ultimately, recommending services 
and rehabilitation specific to the child aids the judge, who may have a significantly more limited view of the case 
at the time it comes before the court.  Consideration of services and rehabilitation likewise serves the community 
protection component of the prosecutor’s job by addressing the potential for future conduct problems.

Early Youth Intervention Services 

On a finding by a justice or municipal court that a child committed an offense that the court has jurisdiction 
of, the court has jurisdiction to enter an order referring the child or the child’s parent for services under Section 
264.302, Family Code.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 45.057(b)(1).  

The Department of Family and Protective Services is authorized to provide services for children who are referred 
to it by justice and municipal courts as “at-risk.”  The services may include: crisis family intervention; emergency 
short-term residential care for children 10 years of age or older; family counseling; parenting skills training; youth 
coping skills training; advocacy training; and mentoring.  Tex. Fam. Code §§ 264.302(e), (f).  

4.8 

Fines and Court Costs

See 5.4b below for information about fines and court costs in justice and municipal courts.

5. Juvenile Probation

When setting the terms and conditions of probation, judges should consider the need for terms to be individualized 
to the child and their  intellectual and developmental capacity.    Recovery and rehabilitation are a process and 
require  skill  development  and  practice  by  the  child  and  their  family.    Probation  conditions  should  allow  for 
opportunities for skill-building and prosocial activities, as well as for setbacks.  For children with MI or ID, the 
goal of probation should be the creation of a network of services and interventions to avoid re-referral to the 
juvenile court.

For children with a trauma history and trauma-related reactions, consider the propriety of a proposed service or 
treatment program by questioning whether the program:

•  Educates youth about trauma and its effects on thoughts, feelings, and behavior;

•  Increases a youth’s sense of physical and psychological safety;

•  Identifies reminders that trigger trauma reactions;

•  Accounts for how seemingly “non-compliant” behavior can be related to trauma, rather than willfulness

or lack of cooperation, and addresses the behavior correctly;

•  Develops  emotional  regulation  skills  (i.e.,  skills  to  help  control  and  strong  feelings  or  to  respond  to

difficult situations);

•  Promotes trauma-informed parenting skills;

•  Addresses grief and loss (when appropriate);

•  Teaches youth to manage traumatic memories;
•  Identifies and cultivates existing supports and strengths that promote recovery.162

As a judge, identify different services to address trauma as an alternative to anger management 
classes.

No Disposition

Texas Family Code section 54.04(c) states that, “No disposition may be made under this section unless the 
child is in need of rehabilitation or the protection of the public or the child requires that disposition be made.  
If the court or jury does not so find, the court shall dismiss the child and enter a final judgment without any 
disposition.”  

5.1 

General Probation Conditions

•  The court or the jury may… place the child on probation on such reasonable and lawful terms as the court 

may determine.  Tex. Fam. Code § 54.04(d)(1).

•  If the court places a child on probation under Section 54.04(d), the court shall require… that the child
work a specified number of hours at a community service project… unless the court determines that:
◦
◦
◦

Participating in the project will be a hardship on the child or the family of the child; or
 

The child has shown good cause that community service should not be required.
 

The child is physically or mentally incapable of participating in the project;
 

Tex. Fam. Code § 54.044(a).

5.2 

Requiring Psychological Treatment as a Condition of Probation

•  The court must order psychological treatment as a condition of probation for Animal Cruelty offenses,

under Section 42.09 or 42.092, Texas Penal Code.  Tex. Fam. Code § 54.0407.

•  The court may order psychological treatment as a condition of probation for offenses that would require

sex offender registration.  Tex. Fam. Code § 54.0405(a)(1).
◦

 
If the court orders the child to attend psychological counseling under Texas Family Code Subsection
54.0405(a), the court may order the child’s parent or guardian to participate in monthly treatment
groups  related  to  the  child’s  psychological  counseling,  and  to  attend  four  sessions  of  instruction
relating  to  sexual  offenses,  family  communication  skills,  sex  offender  treatment,  victims’  rights,
parental supervision, and appropriate sexual behavior.  Tex. Fam. Code § 54.0405(g).

•  The court may order any person living in the same household with the child to participate in social or
psychological counseling to assist in the rehabilitation of the child and to strengthen the child’s family
environment.  Tex. Fam. Code § 54.041(a)(3).

•  The court may order a child who is believed to be a victim of Human Trafficking under Section 20A.02,
Penal  Code,  to  participate  in  a  program  established  under  Section  152.0017,  Human  Resources  Code.

Reflection Point

Ask yourself, as a judge, has equity been considered in prior intercept points?  Have I helped to 
destigmatize MI and IDD?  Have I asked myself about the child before me having race-based 
trauma, such as witnessing the videos of people being murdered in the news and other traumas 
in the traditional sense, resulting in acting out behavior and mental health challenges?  What 
assumptions  have  I  made  about  people  based  on  their  cultural  identity,  profession,  or 
background?    How  might  my  assumptions  influence  my  decision-making?    How  have  I  challenged  any 
assumptions I might have made based on cultural identity, profession, or background?

Multisystemic Therapy (MST)

MST is a family- and community-based treatment for at-risk youth with intensive needs and their families.   
163It has proven most effective for treating youth who have committed violent offenses, have serious mental 
health or substance abuse concerns, are at risk of out-of-home placement, or who have experienced abuse 
and neglect.164 

The overriding goal of MST is to keep adolescents who have exhibited serious clinical problems (e.g., drug 
use, violence, severe criminal behavior) at home, in school, and out of trouble.  Through intense involvement 
and contact with the family, MST aims to uncover and assess the functional origins of adolescent behavioral 
problems.  It works to alter the youth’s ecology in a manner that promotes prosocial conduct while decreasing 
problem and delinquent behavior.165 

MST has been proven to reduce violent crimes by 75%, compared to routine congregate166  and other care.167 
The reduction is long-term, lasting two decades post-treatment.168   MST is one of only three proven programs169  
that addresses family functioning and association with deviant peers, key risk factors for reducing violence, 
other antisocial behaviors, and juvenile justice involvement.170

Referral to LMHA or LIDDA Before Probation Expires

A juvenile probation officer must refer a child who has been determined to have a mental illness or [intellectual 
disability] to an appropriate LMHA or LIDDA at least three months before the child is to complete the juvenile 
probation term, unless the child is currently receiving treatment from the LMHA or LIDDA of the county in which 
the child resides.  Tex. Fam. Code § 54.0408.

Fines and Court Costs

Fines and Court Costs in Juvenile Court

The juvenile court can impose certain fines and court costs during the disposition of a case.  The court also has the 
authority to waive fines and court costs based on the child’s and family’s inability to pay by making specific findings.

Deferred Prosecution: the juvenile board can adopt a fee schedule for DPP services, and rules for waiving fees 
due to financial hardship, in accordance with guidelines from TJJD.  The maximum fee is $15 per month, and the

fees can only be used to fund juvenile probation or community-based juvenile corrections services or facilities.  If 
the juvenile board does not adopt a fee schedule and rules for waiving fees, then no fee for DPP can be imposed.  
Tex. Fam. Code § 53.03(d).

Court Costs: If a disposition hearing is held, the juvenile court, after giving the child, parent, or other person 
responsible for the child’s support a reasonable opportunity to be heard, must order the child, parent, or other 
person, if financially able to do so, to pay a fee of $20.  Tex. Fam. Code § 54.0411(a).  

•   The state comptroller deposits this money into the juvenile probation diversion fund.  Tex. Fam. Code  

§ 54.0411(g).  

•   The legislature sends money from this fund to TJJD to pay for services that are necessary for the diversion 

of youth who are at risk of being committed to TJJD.  Tex. Fam. Code § 54.0411(h).

Graffiti Fee: If a child is adjudicated delinquent of a graffiti offense, the court must order the child, parent, or 
other person responsible for the child’s support to pay a $50 juvenile delinquency prevention fee, which goes into 
a county juvenile delinquency prevention fund.  Tex. Fam. Code §§ 54.0461(a), (b).  

•   The fee can be waived if the court finds that the child, parent, or other person responsible for the child’s 

support is unable to pay it.  Tex. Fam. Code § 54.0461(c).

DNA Testing Fee: If a child is adjudicated delinquent of a felony that requires a DNA sample be taken, the court 
must order the child, parent, or other person responsible for the child’s support to pay a fee of: either $50, if the 
disposition includes a commitment to TJJD or to a facility operated by TJJD; or $34, if the disposition does not 
include a commitment to TJJD or to a facility operated by TJJD.  Tex. Fam. Code § 54.0462(a).  

•   The state comptroller sends this money to the Department of Public Safety to pay for the testing of DNA 

samples provided by children required to pay the fee.  Tex. Fam. Code § 54.0462(b).  

•   The fee can be waived if the court finds that the child, parent, or other person responsible for the child’s 

support is unable to pay it.  Tex. Fam. Code § 54.0462(c).

Restitution: the court can order restitution to be made by the child and the child’s parents. Tex. Fam. Code § 54.048(a).

•   If  the  child,  child’s  parent,  or  other  person  responsible  for  the  child’s  support  is  unable  to  make  the 
restitution  in  a  graffiti  case,  the  court  can  order  the  child  to  perform  a  specific  number  of  hours  of 
community service to satisfy the restitution.  Tex. Fam. Code § 54.0481(b).

•   If the child is financially unable to make restitution in a Criminal Mischief case under Code of Criminal 
Procedure 28.03(f), or an Abuse of a Corpse case under Code of Criminal Procedure 42.08, the court can 
order the child to perform a specific number of hours of community service, or order a parent or other 
person responsible for the child’s support to make the restitution.  Tex. Fam. Code § 54.049(b).

5.4b 

Fines and Court Costs in Municipal Court

Judges are permitted, but not required, to waive payment of all or part of a fine imposed on a defendant if the 
court determines that the defendant:

•   is a child, is indigent, or does not have sufficient resources or income to pay all or part of the fine; and

•   each alternative method of discharging the fine (community service, payment at a later date, or installment 

payments) would impose a hardship on the defendant.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. arts. 43.091(c); 45.0491(d).

In making the determination of undue hardship, the court may consider, among other things, the defendant’s 
significant physical or mental impairment or disability.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. arts. 43.091(b); 45.0491(c).

Legislative Change

H.B.  80  (87th  Reg.  Sess.  (2021))  amended  Texas  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  article  45.041  to 
prohibit the payment of fines and court costs by “a defendant who is under the conservatorship 
of the Department of Family and Protective Services or in extended foster care171  as provided 
by  Subchapter  G,  Chapter  263,  Family  Code…”    The  defendant  can  be  ordered  to  perform 
community service in lieu of the payment of fine and costs.

5.5 

Post-Discharge Services

Provided  that existing  resources are available, a  juvenile  board or  juvenile  probation department can  provide 
post-discharge services to a child for up to six months after the child is discharged from probation, regardless of 
the child’s age.  10 Tex. Admin. Code § 142.007(b).

“Post-discharge  services”  means  community-based  services  to  support  the  child’s  vocational,  educational, 
behavioral, or other goals and to provide continuity for the child as they transition out of a juvenile probation 
services.  The term includes:

1.  Behavioral health services;

2.  Mental health services;

3.  Substance abuse services;

4.  Mentoring;

5.  Job training; and

6.  Educational services.

10 Tex. Admin. Code § 142.007(a).

6.  Fitness to Proceed   

All states have a statutory standard for determining whether a person is incompetent to stand trial.  This standard 
comes from Dusky v. U.S., a 1960 United States Supreme Court case, which held that the test of a defendant’s 
competency to stand trial is whether the person has “sufficient present ability to consult with [their] lawyer with a 
reasonable degree of rational understanding – and whether [they have] a rational as well as factual understanding 
of the proceedings against [them].”172   Fitness to proceed is the juvenile court equivalent to competency to stand 
trial.

A juvenile respondent who, as a result of mental illness or an intellectual disability, lacks capacity to understand 
the proceedings in juvenile court or to assist in their own defense is unfit to proceed and cannot be subjected to 
discretionary transfer to criminal court, adjudication, disposition, or modification of disposition, as long as the 
incapacity lasts.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.31(a).  A flowchart to aid in understanding the fitness to proceed process can 
be found on pages 108 and 109.  It should also be noted that the fitness to proceed and restoration process may 
not cover all possible causes of a child’s incapacity, such as a developmental disability or a lack of chronological 
maturity.  A checklist to assist in identifying possible MI or ID can be found on page 149.

Fitness proceedings can be costly and can lengthen a juvenile respondent’s involvement in the juvenile justice 
system.  The goal of the fitness restoration process is different than the goals of treatment and services.  Fitness is 

171  “Extended foster care” means a residential living arrangement in which a young adult voluntarily delegates to the department responsibility for 
the young adult’s placement and care and in which the young adult resides with a foster parent or other residential services provider that is:

licensed or approved by the department or verified by a licensed or certified child-placing agency; and

(A) 
(B)  paid under a contract with the department. 

Tex. Fam. Code § 263.601(1).

not the ideal pathway into behavioral health treatment, although it is one.  Judges and all parties should consider 
whether fitness is the real issue, and the effect that the fitness restoration process could have on the child.  For 
example, dismissal or a referral to community-based services may be more appropriate.

Recall that when used in Texas Family Code Chapter 55, “mental illness” means “an illness, disease, or condition, 
other  than  epilepsy,  senility,  alcoholism,  or  mental  deficiency,  that:  (A)  substantially  impairs  a  person’s 
thought, perception of reality, emotional process, or judgment; or (B) grossly impairs behavior as demonstrated 
by  recent disturbed  behavior.”   Tex.  Fam.  Code  §  55.01, Tex.  Health  &  Safety  Code  §  571.003(14).    Intellectual 
disability  means  significantly  subaverage  general  intellectual  functioning  that  is  concurrent  with  deficits  in 
adaptive  behavior  and  originates  during  the  developmental  period.    Tex.  Code  Crim.  Proc.  art.  46B.001(8);  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 591.003.  

Developmental Period

Children who are referred to the juvenile court are, by definition, “in their developmental period” (under age 
18); therefore, a child who has a diagnosis of having a pervasive developmental disorder in a psychological 
or psychiatric report probably qualifies as having an intellectual disability.173   

Obtaining a diagnosis of intellectual disability from the LIDDA can facilitate a child’s lifetime access 
to state-funded services.  

6.1 

Raising the Issue

•   Unless a child has previously been found to be unfit to proceed, the child is presumed to be fit to proceed.

•   When a child is alleged by petition or found to have engaged in delinquent conduct or CINS, the court or 
any party can raise the issue of unfitness as a result of mental illness (MI) or intellectual disability (ID).  
Tex. Fam. Code § 55.31(b).  It is almost never too late to raise the issue.

•   The issue of unfitness can be raised prior to an adjudication hearing, a disposition hearing, a motion to 

modify hearing, or a discretionary transfer hearing.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.31(a).

•   Once the motion is filed, the court must determine whether or not probable cause exists to believe that 
the child is unfit to proceed.  In making its determination on the issue of probable cause, the court can 
consider the motion, supporting documents, professional statements of counsel,174  witness testimony, 
and the court’s own observation of the child.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.31(b).

Observation of the Child

Since the statute allows for the court to use observations of the child for its probable cause determination, 
it  is  important  that  the  court  monitor  how  the  child  interacts  with  others,  including  parents,  guardians, 
caregivers,  lawyers,  the  court,  as  well  as  other  court  participants.    The  court  can  also  observe  the  child’s 
physical  appearance,  including  whether  the  child  is  appropriately  dressed,  well-nourished,  and  practicing 
proper hygiene.

under  a  parallel  provision 
in  
[CCP, Art. 46B.079] a report by 
a  qualified  expert  is  routinely 
provided by the facility 

If the  child is unfit to proceed as a result of 
MI  or  ID  and  the  Court  determines,  after 
consulting  with  the  probation  department 
and local treatment or service providers, that 
the  child  may  be  adequately  treated  or 
served  in  an  alternative  setting,  order  the 
child  to  receive  treatment  on  an  Outpatient 
basis for a period of not more than 90 days 
(order may not specify a shorter period).  
[FC § 55.33(a)(3)/(c)] 

Provided  that  the  child  meets  the  civil 
commitment  criteria  under  Subtitle  C  or 
D,  Title  7,  Health  &  Safety  Code  (MH 
Code  or  Persons  with 
Intellectual 
Disabilities Act [PIDA], respectively), the 
Court  orders  the  child  placed  in  a 
facility  designated  by  HHSC*  for  a 
period  of  not  more  than  90  days  (order 
may not specify shorter timeframe) 
[FC § 55.33(a)(1)] 

On  application  by  the  child's  parent, 
guardian,  or  guardian  ad  litem,  the 
Court  may  order  the  child  placed  in  a 
private  psychiatric  inpatient  facility 
for  a  period  of  not  more  than  90  days 
(order may not specify a shorter period) 
but only if the placement is agreed to 
in writing by the administrator of the 
facility [FC 55.33 § (a)(2)] 

Not later than the 75th day after the date the Court issues a placement order, the facility shall submit a Report to the Court that: 

• Describes treatment or services of the child provided; and 
• States the opinion of the director of the facility** whether the child is fit or unfit to proceed [FC § 55.35(b)]

•  If the court determines that probable cause exists to believe that the child is unfit to proceed, then all 
juvenile court proceedings  must  be stayed, and  the  judge  must order  the child  to  be examined under 
Texas Family Code § 51.20.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.31(c).
 ◦

 
The information obtained from the examination must include: expert opinion as to whether the child 
is unfit to proceed as a result of MI or ID.  Tex. Fam. Code §§ 51.20, 55.31(c).

•   The expert opinion can be from a physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist; however, the expert must 
also  be  qualified  by  education  and  clinical  training  in  mental  health  or  [intellectual  disability] 
and experienced in forensic evaluation.  Experts who determine fitness to proceed must also be 
qualified under Subchapter B, Chapter 46B, Code of Criminal Procedure, to examine a defendant in 
a criminal case, and the examination and report resulting under an examination under § 51.20 must 
comply with the requirements under Subchapter B, Chapter 46B, Code of Criminal Procedure, for 
the examination and resulting report of a defendant in a criminal case.  Tex. Fam. Code § 51.20(a).

•   Once the court receives the report from the examination of the child, and after considering all relevant 
information, including the report, the court must determine whether or not evidence exists to support a 
finding that the child is unfit to proceed.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.31(d)(1).

•   If the court determines that evidence does not exist to support a finding that the child is unfit to proceed, 
the judge must dissolve the stay and continue the juvenile court proceedings as if the issue had not been 
raised.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.31(d)(2).

6.2a  Qualifications of Experts

Judges should critically vet the experts they appoint.  This minimally entails verifying that an expert meets the 
statutory qualifications prior to appointment.  A psychiatrist or psychologist appointed to examine a person and/
or testify regarding fitness to proceed must generally:

•   Be a psychiatrist who is a physician licensed in Texas or a psychologist licensed in Texas who has a doctoral 

degree in psychology;

•   Have the following certification or training:

 ◦

 ◦

 
If  a  psychiatrist,  certification  by  the  American  Board  of  Psychiatry  and  Neurology  with  added  or 
special qualifications in forensic psychiatry; or

 
If a psychologist, certification by the American Board of Professional Psychology in forensic psychology; 
or

•   At least 24 hours of specialized forensic training relating to incompetency or insanity evaluations; 

and

•   At least eight hours of continuing education relating to forensic evaluations, completed in the 12 

months preceding the appointment; and

•   Have  completed  six  hours  of  required  continuing  education  in  courses  in  forensic  psychiatry 
or  psychology,  respectively,  in  either  of  the  reporting  periods  in  the  24  months  preceding  the 
appointment.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.022(a)-(b).

Appointment of an expert psychiatrist or psychologist who does not meet the above requirements may only occur 
if exigent circumstances require the court to base the appointment on professional training or experience of the 
expert that directly provides the expert with a specialized expertise that would not ordinarily be possessed by a 
psychiatrist or psychologist who meets the above requirements.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.022(c).  This is 
a narrow exception.  One example is a case in which the adult defendant not only appeared to lack competency 
because of either MI or IDD, but was also deaf.175   Therefore, the court needed an expert who was knowledgeable 
about the defendant’s hearing disability, but that expert might not have met the statutory requirements for an 
expert.176

6.2b 

Factors Considered in the Examination

In addition to other  issues determined to  be relevant  by the expert, the following factors  must  be considered 
during a fitness examination and in any report based on that examination:

•   The capacity of the juvenile respondent during criminal proceedings to:

Rationally  understand  the  charges  against  them  and  the  potential  consequences  of  the  pending 
 
juvenile proceedings;

Disclose to counsel pertinent facts, events, and states of mind;
 

Engage in a reasoned choice of legal strategies and options;
 

Understand the adversarial nature of juvenile proceedings;
 

Exhibit appropriate courtroom behavior; and
 

Testify;
 

•   Whether the juvenile respondent is a person with MI or ID, as supported by current indications and the 

juvenile respondent’s personal history;

•   The degree of impairment resulting from the MI or ID, if existent, and the specific impact on the juvenile 

respondent’s capacity to engage with counsel in a reasonable and rational manner; and

•   If the juvenile respondent is taking psychoactive or other medication:

Whether the medication is necessary to maintain the juvenile respondent’s [fitness]; and
 

The effect, if any, of the medication on the juvenile respondent’s appearance, demeanor, or ability to 
 
participate in the proceedings.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.024.

6.2c 

Expert’s Report

The court shall direct an expert to provide the expert’s report to the court and the appropriate parties in the form 
approved by TCOOMMI under section 614.0032(b) of the Health and Safety Code (see page 152 of this Bench 
Book).177 

Additional Required Information in the Expert’s Report

In addition to the factors in article 46B.024 that must be considered during an examination and in any report 
based  on  that  examination,  article  46B.025  requires  specific,  detailed  information  in  the  expert’s  report.    An 
expert’s report must:

•   State an opinion on a juvenile respondent’s [fitness or unfitness to proceed] (or explain why the expert is 

unable to do so);

•   Identify and address specific issues referred to the expert for evaluation;

•   Document that the expert explained to the juvenile respondent

The purpose of the evaluation,
 

The persons to whom a report on the evaluation is provided, and
 

 
The limits on rules of confidentiality applying to the relationship between the expert and the juvenile 
respondent;

•   Specifically describe procedures, techniques, and tests used in the examination, the purpose of each of 

those, and the conclusions reached;

•   State the expert’s clinical observations, findings, and opinions on each specific issue referred to the expert 

by the court;

•   State the specific criteria supporting the expert’s diagnosis; and

•   State specifically any issues on which the expert could not provide an opinion.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.025(a).

In addition, if it is the opinion of the expert that the juvenile respondent is [unfit to proceed], the expert shall 
state in the report:

•   The symptoms, exact nature, severity, and expected duration of the deficits resulting from the juvenile 

respondent’s MI or ID, if any;

•   The impact of the identified condition on the factors listed in article 46B.024;

•   An estimate of the period needed to restore the juvenile respondent’s [fitness], including whether the 

respondent is likely to be restored to [fitness] in the foreseeable future; and

•   The prospective treatment options, if any, appropriate for the juvenile respondent.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.025(b).

Note: Judges should know what to look for in an expert’s report.  The court does not have to accept a report that is 
of poor quality and can ensure the statutory requirements are met by ordering amendment of the report.  It is also 
important to note that the determination of fitness or unfitness is the role of the fact finder (usually the judge).  
This role should not be abdicated to the expert.178 

Beyond Statutory Requirements: Marks of a Quality Expert’s Report179 

 ■  Conveys  all  relevant  information  concisely,  unambiguously,  and  clearly,  including  the  facts  and 

reasoning the expert used in formulating the opinion.

 ■  Goes beyond describing signs and symptoms of mental illness and discusses how those signs and 

symptoms affect functional abilities relevant to the legal construct of fitness.

 ■  Describes the juvenile respondent’s abilities and deficits concerning the tasks that they must perform 

during a juvenile defense.

the expert expresses.

 ■  Is a stand-alone document in that it provides or reproduces the data needed to support the opinions 

 ■  States clearly any limitations or qualifications of which the expert is aware.

 ■  Contains  clinical  data  regarding  the  nature  of  the  juvenile  respondent’s  mental  and  emotional 

condition that are specifically relevant to the fitness analysis.

 ■  Comments on any contradictions or inconsistencies.

 ■  Provides  specific  examples  that  illustrate  the  juvenile  respondent’s  strengths  or  weaknesses  with 
respect to reasoning and understanding, based on a competence-assessment instrument as well as 
other types of data.

 ■  Opines concerning restorability and the appropriate setting for restoration.

 ■  Is free of gratuitous comments about the juvenile respondent’s behavior, need for [removal from 

society], dangerousness, lack of remorse, or other legal matters.

Note: The expert’s opinion on the juvenile respondent’s fitness or unfitness to proceed may not be based solely on 
the respondent’s refusal to communicate during the examination.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.025(a-1).

6.3 

Hearing on Issue of Fitness to Proceed

If the court determines that evidence exists to support a finding that the child is unfit to proceed as a result of MI 
or ID, the court shall set the case for a hearing on the issue.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.32(a).

•   The issue of whether the child is unfit to proceed must be determined at a hearing separate from any other 

hearing.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.32(b).

•   The court determines the issue of whether the child is unfit to proceed unless the child or their attorney 

demands a jury 10 days before the hearing.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.32(c).

•   Unfitness to proceed must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.32(d).

•   If the child is found fit to proceed, the court must dissolve the stay and continue with juvenile proceedings.  

Tex. Fam. Code § 55.32(e).

•   If the child is found unfit to proceed, the juvenile proceedings continue to be stayed for as long as the 

incapacity lasts; and proceed under § 55.33.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.32(f).

A Juvenile Can Have MI or ID and be Fit to Proceed Under Chapter 55

It is important to understand that that a judge may receive information that may not suggest that a juvenile is 
unfit to proceed under Chapter 55 of the Texas Family Code, but that may suggest that the juvenile has a MI 
or ID.  Such a condition may not render the juvenile unfit to proceed, but it may warrant special consideration 
and management of the juvenile’s case.

6.4 

Proceedings Following Finding of Unfitness to Proceed

Once the child has been found unfit to proceed, a temporary commitment of up to 90 days is required, provided 
that the child meets the commitment criteria under Subtitle C180  or D,181  Title 7, Health and Safety Code.  Tex. 
Fam. Code § 55.30.  

Legislative Change

H.B. 2107 (87th Reg. Sess. (2021)) added the option for a child who is unfit to proceed due to an 
intellectual  disability  to  receive  services  or  treatment  in  an  outpatient  setting.    Before  this 
change, a child who was unfit to proceed due to ID could only receive services or treatment at 
an inpatient facility.

•   If the unfitness is due to MI, there are three placement options:

 ◦
 ◦

 ◦

Placement with the [Texas Health and Human Services Commission]182  (state hospital);
 

Placement in a private psychiatric facility,183  on application by the child’s parent, guardian, or guardian 
 
ad litem, so long as the facility administrator agrees in writing; or

Placement in an outpatient program, if the court approves of the treatment setting.  
 

•   If the unfitness is due to ID, there are two placement options:

180  See Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.034 for Temporary Inpatient Mental Health Services criteria; and see Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.0345 
for Temporary Outpatient Mental Health Services criteria; or see below, under 7.7.1f.

181  See Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.052 for Intellectual Disability criteria, or see below, under 7.8.1f.

182  Note that the text of the statute indicates the placement is with the Department of State Health Services (DSHS).  The 84th Legislature made 
structural changes to the Health and Human Services system, including transferring some DSHS functions to HHSC.  As of September 2017, all 
state hospitals transferred to HHSC from DSHS.

183  If funding is specifically budgeted for it, the court can order the state to pay for the cost of placing a child in a private psychiatric facility, regard-
less of whether the unfitness is due to MI or ID.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.33(b).

 ◦

Placement with the [Texas Health and Human Services Commission]184 (state supported living center); 
 
or

Placement in an outpatient program, if the court approves of the treatment setting.
 

Tex. Fam. Code § 55.33(a).

6.4.1  Transportation

•   If  the  child  is  unfit  to  proceed  due  to  a  condition  other  than  MI  or  ID,  and  thus  does  not  meet  the 
commitment criteria under Subtitle C or D, Title 7, Health and Safety Code, no court-ordered commitment 
is possible.  The juvenile proceedings are stayed indefinitely.

•   If  the  court  issues  a  placement  order,  the  court  must  order  the  probation  department  or  the  sheriff’s 
department to transport the child to and from the designated facility.  Tex. Fam. Code §§ 55.34(a), (b).
 ◦

 
Upon receipt of a report from a facility, the child shall be returned to juvenile court.  If the child is not 
transported back to juvenile court by the 11th day after the date of the court’s order, then the facility is 
required to transport the child to the court, at the county’s expense.  Tex. Fam. Code §§ 55.34(b), (c).  

6.4.2 

Information Required to be Sent to the Facility

•   The court must order the probation department to send copies of any information in their possession 
that is relevant to the issue of the child’s MI or ID to the treatment provider.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.35(a).  
This may include information in the court’s file, the probation department’s file, the detention facility 
file, and/or medical or mental health files maintained by the probation department and/or its medical or 
mental health providers.

6.4.3  Report due to the Court

•   Before  the  75th day after  the commitment order,  the  treatment provider  must submit  its report  to  the 
court.   The report  must describe the treatment or services provided to the child and state the  facility 
director’s opinion as to whether the child is fit or unfit to proceed.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.35(b).
 ◦

 
The court  must provide a copy of the facility’s report to the prosecutor and to the child’s attorney.   
Tex. Fam. Code § 55.35(c).

6.5 

Report that Child is Fit to Proceed

•   If the facility report states the child is fit to proceed, the court must find that the child is fit to proceed, 
unless the child’s attorney objects in writing or in open court not later than two days after the 
attorney receives the report.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.36(a).
 ◦
 ◦

 
The fitness hearing is before the court unless the child or their attorney demands a jury 10 days before 
the hearing.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.36(b).

If a proper objection is made, the court must promptly hold a fitness hearing.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.36(b).
 

 ◦

 ◦

 
If  the  child  is  found  fit  to  proceed,  the  court  must  dissolve  the  stay  and  continue  with  juvenile 
proceedings.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.36(c).

 
If the child is found unfit to proceed, the court must proceed to a commitment hearing.  Tex. Fam. 
Code § 55.36(d).

184  Note that the text of the statute indicates the placement is with the Department of Aging and Disability Services (DADS).  As part of the changes 
made by the 84th Legislature, all remaining DADS functions were transferred to HHSC in September 2017.

Best Practices for Reviewing Fitness Reports185 

It is important that the attorneys who receive the child’s fitness report understand it and determine whether 
it is an accurate portrayal of the child.  It may help to question whether the language attributed to the child 
matches the lawyer’s own observations.  Lawyers should be aware of descriptions such as those listed below, 
and object to the fitness determination if necessary.  Lawyers should talk to the child at least by phone prior 
to determining if they need to object to the report.  It may be necessary to object to the report and request 
additional time to consult with the child, to preserve the two-day deadline for objections.

Fitness  to  proceed  is  not  a  sliding  scale.    A  child  is  either  fit  or  is  not  fit.    The  following  are  examples  of 
statements  which  may  indicate,  contrary  to  the  report’s  conclusion,  that  the  child  is  not  currently  fit  to 
proceed:

 ■ “The child appears at least marginally fit to proceed at this time.”

 ■ “The  child’s  cognitive  functioning  is  within  the  borderline  range,  but  their  adaptive  behavioral 

functioning is noticeably below expectation.”

 ■  “The child was partially oriented to time.”

 ■  “The child did not know the name of the home where they were living.”

 ■  “The child’s communication was rated within the severely impaired range.”

6.6 

Report that Child is Unfit

At this point the procedures for commitment due to MI and ID become separate: §§ 55.37 through 55.39 govern 
mental illness while §§ 55.40 through 55.42 govern intellectual disability.186   

6.7.1  Commitment Proceedings in Juvenile Court for Mental Illness

The juvenile court has the option of hearing the commitment proceeding or referring it to an appropriate county 
or probate court.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.37.

Juvenile Court or Probate Court

The choice of whether to proceed with commitment in juvenile court or to refer the proceedings to a county or 
probate court rests exclusively with the juvenile court.  A juvenile court that hears commitment proceedings 
infrequently may prefer to have the county or probate court conduct them.  The standards for commitment 
are the same, regardless of which court holds the commitment hearing.  County or probate courts may have 
more frequent interaction with community-based treatment options, private placements, and state facilities.  
Judges in a community can discuss available resources to determine which approach is advantageous for 
their constituents.  If the juvenile court chooses to refer the case to a county or probate court, it is important 
to maintain ongoing communication concerning the child’s progress and case status.

6.7.11  Application for Court-Ordered Mental Health Proceedings

For commitment proceedings in juvenile court, the prosecutor must file an application for court-ordered mental 
health services under Section 574.001, Health and Safety Code.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.38(a).

What Should be Included in the Application

An application must:

•   Be styled using the child’s initials and not the proposed patient’s full name;

•   State whether the application is for temporary or extended services;

•   Contain the child’s name, address, and county of residence in Texas;

•   Include a statement that the child is a person with mental illness and meets the criteria in Chapter 574 for 

court-ordered mental health services; and

•   State whether the child is charged with a criminal offense.

Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 574.002(b), (c).

Application Requirements for Extended Court-Ordered Services

Applications for extended court-ordered services have several statutory requirements that applications for 
temporary court-ordered services do not require.

 ■  An application for extended inpatient mental health services must state that the child has received:

 —  Court-ordered  inpatient  mental  health  services  under  either  this  subtitle  or  under  Chapter  46B, 
Subchapter  D  of  the  Texas  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  (Procedures  after  Determination  of 
Incompetency)  or  Subchapter  E  (Civil  Commitment:  Charges  Pending)  for  at  least  60  consecutive 
days during the prior 12 months.

 ■  An  application  for  extended  outpatient  mental  health  services  must  state  that  the  child  has 

received:

 —  Court-ordered  inpatient  mental  health  services  under  either  this  subtitle  or  under  Chapter  46B, 
Subchapter D or E of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure for a total of at least 60 days during the 
prior 12 months; OR

 —  Court-ordered outpatient mental health services under this subtitle or Chapter 46B, Subchapters D or 

E during the preceding 60 days.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.002(b).

6.7.12  Appointment and Duties of an Attorney under HSC 574.004

•   The judge must appoint an attorney for the child within 24 hours after the application is filed unless the 

child already has an attorney.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.003(a).

•   Texas codifies the duties that an attorney has toward a client in a court-ordered services proceeding in 
section 574.004, and the court is required to give a copy of these duties to every court-appointed attorney.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.003(b).

The Statutory Responsibility of Attorneys in Commitment Cases

The requirements set forth in section 574.004 of the Texas Health and Safety Code were the result of publicity 
surrounding the actions of some court-appointed lawyers who were not communicating with adult clients 
before hearings, or were conducting group interviews with multiple adult clients.  “The publicity surrounding 
such  inappropriate  and  inadequate  representation  caused  the  Legislature  to  strengthen  the  rights  of 
patients.”187   

Note  that  the  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  governing  attorneys  comment  specifically  on  the  attention 
and  respect  that  is  to  be  given  to  every  client,  regardless  of  whether  the  client  has  with  a  mental  illness.  
Comment 5 to Rule 1.02 of the TDRPC states: “When a lawyer reasonably believes a client suffers a mental 
disability or is not legally competent, it may not be possible to maintain the usual attorney-client relationship.  
Nevertheless, the client may have the ability to understand, deliberate upon, and reach conclusions about 
some matters affecting the client’s own well-being… the fact that a client [has] a disability does not diminish 
the desirability of treating the client with attention and respect.”

Included in the list of duties owed by the attorney to the proposed patient is that the attorney must respect the 
client’s decision to agree or resist the efforts to provide mental health services, even though they may personally 
disagree  with  the  client’s  wishes.    Though  the  attorney  may  provide  counsel,  the  attorney  must  abide  by  the 
client’s final decision on the matter.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.004(c).

6.7.13  Setting the Commitment Hearing in Juvenile Court

The  juvenile court  must set a date for the  hearing and provide  notice as required under  Sections  574.005 and 
574.006, Health and Safety Code.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.38(a)(1).

•   The court  must set a  hearing within  14 days of  the date  the application was  filed  but  may  not  hold a 
hearing  within  the  first  three  days  after  the  application  is  filed,  if  the  child  or  their  attorney  objects.   
Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 574.005(a), (b).
 ◦

There are witnesses who may appear at the hearing to present evidence, who may be unknown to the 
 
parties prior to the hearing date.  If either party wishes, they may request a continuance  based on 
surprise and the court may continue the hearing date.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.006(d).

•   While the court may grant continuances of the hearing, the final hearing must be held no later than 30 
days from the date the application was filed.  The only exception is for extreme weather or disaster, in 
which case the judge may, by a written order each day, postpone the hearing for 24 hours.  Tex. Health & 
Safety Code § 574.005(c).

•   The child and their attorney are entitled to receive a copy of the application and written notice of the 
court hearing immediately after it is set.  Notice must also be delivered in person or via certified mail to 
the child’s:
 ◦
 ◦
 ◦

Each managing and possessory conservator, if applicable.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.006(b).
 

Appointed guardian, if applicable; or
 

Parent, if a minor; or
 

•   If a parent cannot be located, and the child does not have a guardian or conservator, the notice may be 

given to the proposed patient’s next of kin.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.006(c).

6.7.14  Medical Examination Requirement

•   The judge must appoint the number of physicians necessary (at least two) to examine the child and to 
complete the certificates of medical examination (CMEs) for mental illness.  Tex. Health & Safety Code 
§§ 574.009(a), (b).
 ◦

The two CMEs must be completed by the appointed physicians, within the preceding 30 days, and

psychiatrist is available in the county.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.009(a).

•   The court also  has  the authority  to order an  independent evaluation of  the child,  by a  psychiatrist of 
the child’s choosing, if the court feels it will assist the finder of fact.  If the child is indigent, the county 
may  reimburse  the child’s appointed attorney  for any expenses  incurred  in  securing  the  psychiatrist’s 
testimony.  Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 574.010(a), (b).

What Should a CME for Mental Illness Include?

1.  Name and address of examining physician

2.  Name and address of the child examined

3.  Date and place of examination

4.  Brief diagnosis of the child’s physical and mental condition

5.  The time period, if any, the child has been under the physician’s care

6.  A description of the mental health treatment the examining physician has given to the child, if any

7.  The examining physician’s opinion that:

a.  The child is a person with mental illness; and

b.  As a result of that illness the child is likely to cause serious harm to the child or to others or is:

i.  Suffering severe and abnormal mental, emotional, or physical distress;

ii.  Experiencing  substantial  mental  or  physical  deterioration  of  the  child’s  ability  to  function 

independently, exhibited by the inability to provide for basic needs; and

iii.  Not able to make a rational and informed decision as to whether to submit to treatment.

The examining physician must be as specific and detailed as possible as to which criterion forms the basis of 
their opinion, and, if it is offered in support of an application for extended court-ordered services, must state 
that the child’s condition is likely to continue for more than 90 days.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.011.

6.7.15  Commitment Hearing

The court  must conduct  the  hearing  in accordance with  Subchapter  C,  Chapter  574,  Health and  Safety  Code.   
Tex. Fam. Code § 55.38(a)(2).

Legislative Change

S.B. 362 (86th Reg. Sess. (2019)) added sections 574.0345 and 574.0355 of the Texas Health and 
Safety  Code.    The  bill  took  the  temporary  and  extended  inpatient,  and  the  temporary  and 
extended  outpatient  commitment  procedures  that  were  contained  in  sections  574.034  and 
574.035 and divided them so that there is now one section for each procedure.

 ■  Section 574.034: Order for Temporary Inpatient Mental Health Services

 ■  Section 574.0345: Order for Temporary Outpatient Mental Health Services

•   The child is entitled to be present at the hearing, but the child or their attorney may waive this right.  Tex. 

Health & Safety Code § 574.031(c).

•   The hearing must be open to the public unless the child or their attorney requests that it be closed, and 

the court finds good cause to do so.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(d).
 ◦

 
Generally, juvenile court proceedings are open to the public unless good cause is shown to exclude the 
public.  Tex. Fam. Code § 54.08(a).

 ◦

 
If a child is under the age of 14 at the time of the hearing, the court shall close the hearing to the 
public, unless the court finds that the interests of the child or the public would be better served by 
opening the hearing to the public.  Tex. Fam. Code § 54.08(c).

•  In a hearing for temporary inpatient or outpatient mental health services, the child or their attorney may 
waive the right to cross-examine witnesses by filing a written waiver with the court.  If that right is waived, the 
court may admit the CMEs as evidence, the CMEs will constitute competent medical or psychiatric testimony, 
and the court can make its findings based solely on the CMEs.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(d-1).

•   In a hearing for extended inpatient or outpatient mental health services, the court must hear testimony 

and cannot make findings solely from the CMEs.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(d-2).

Legislative Change

S.B.  362  (86th  Reg.  Sess.  (2019))  added  subsections  (d-1)  and  (d-2)  to  section  574.031  of  the 
Texas Health and Safety Code.  These provisions about the right to waive cross-examination of 
witnesses  were  originally  in  sections  574.034  and  574.035  but  were  pulled  out  as  separate 
subsections.    Additionally,  the  original  statute  stated  that  a  patient  AND  a  patient’s  attorney 
may, by written document, waive the right to cross-examination of witnesses.  The amended 
statute replaces AND with OR, but as stated above in the duties of the attorney, attorneys must consult and 
comply with their client’s wishes.

The  bill  also  removed  subsections  in  574.034  and  574.035  regarding  admitting  the  CME  as  evidence  and 
consolidates the language into subsections 574.031(d-1) and (d-2).

•   Unlike the probable cause hearing, the final hearing is governed by the Texas Rules of Evidence unless 

otherwise stated in this subtitle.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(e).

•   Each  element  of  the  applicable  criteria  must  be  proven  by  clear and convincing evidence,  and  the 

hearing must be on the record.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(g).

•   The  court  may  consider  the  testimony  of  a  non-physician  mental  health  professional  in  addition  to 

medical or psychiatric testimony.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(f).

•   The  hearing  for  temporary  mental  health  services  must  be  before  the  court  unless  the  child  or  their 
attorney requests a jury trial.  A hearing for extended mental health services must be in front of a jury 
unless waived by the child or their attorney.  The waiver must be sworn and signed unless made orally in 
the court’s presence.  Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 574.032(a), (b), and (c).  The court may allow a jury 
waiver to be withdrawn for good cause shown no later than the eighth day before the hearing.  Tex. Health 
& Safety Code § 574.032(d).
 ◦

If the hearing is before a jury, the jury must determine if the child is a person with mental illness and 
 
meets the criteria for court-ordered services; however, the jury cannot make a finding regarding the 
type of services to be provided.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.032(f).

•   After conducting the hearing, the juvenile court shall:

 ◦

If the criteria under Section 574.034 or 574.0345, Health and Safety Code, are satisfied, order temporary 
 
mental health services for the child; or

 
If the criteria under Section 574.035 or 574.0355, Health and Safety Code, are satisfied, order extended 
mental health services for the child.

A party to a commitment proceeding can appeal the judgment to the appropriate court of appeals.  
Notice of appeal must be filed no later than 10 days after the date the order is signed.  Tex. Health & 
Safety Code §§ 574.070(a), (b).

Note:  If  the  judge  or  the  jury  fails  to  find,  from  clear  and  convincing  evidence,  that  the  child  is  a  person 
with mental illness and meets the applicable commitment criteria, the court shall enter an order denying the 
application for court-ordered temporary or extended mental health services, and order the immediate 
release of the child.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.033.

6.7.16  Commitment Orders

Orders Must Clearly Specify Commitment Criteria

The Code requires that orders for temporary or extended inpatient treatment must specify which criteria the 
judge or jury is basing their decision upon.  There has been conflicting caselaw in this area.  Some appellate 
courts have allowed an order to submit the criteria in the disjunctive (i.e. listing the criteria with OR), while 
other courts have found that listing the criteria in the conjunctive (with AND) is the only way to ensure that 
there are specific findings.188 

A  suggested  practice  to  avoid  any  confusion  is  to  take  the  word  “or”  out  of  any  order  for  temporary  or 
extended inpatient treatment, thus requiring specific finding on any of the criteria listed.

Order for Temporary Inpatient Mental Health Services

The judge may order a child to receive court-ordered temporary inpatient mental health services only if the judge 
or jury finds, from clear and convincing evidence, that:

1.  The child is a person with mental illness; and

2.  As a result of that mental illness the child:

A.  Is likely to cause serious harm to themselves;

B.  Is likely to cause serious harm to others; or

C.  Is:

i.  Suffering severe and abnormal mental, emotional, or physical distress;

ii.  Experiencing  substantial  mental  or  physical  deterioration  of  the  child’s  ability  to  function 
independently, which  is exhibited  by the child’s  inability, except  for reasons of  indigence, to 
provide for the child’s basic needs, including food, clothing, health, or safety; and

iii. Unable to make a rational and informed decision as to whether or not to submit to treatment.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.034(a).

•   If the judge or jury finds that the child meets the commitment criteria, the judge or jury must specify 
which criterion listed in Subsection (a)(2) forms the basis for the decision.  Tex. Health & Safety Code  
§ 574.034(c).

•   To be clear and convincing, the evidence must include expert testimony and, unless waived, evidence of 

a recent overt act189  or a continuing pattern of behavior that tends to confirm:

1.  The likelihood of serious harm to the child or others; or

188  Hon. Guy Herman, Mental Health Law 8 (Aug. 2019) (unpublished manuscript) (on file with the Judicial Commission on Mental Health).

189  Note that the Texas Supreme Court, in State v. K.E.W., clarified the “overt act” requirement.  The Court held that the act does not have to be ac-
tually harmful or demonstrate that harm to others is imminent.  The case also states that speech alone may be considered an overt act.  See State 
v. K.E.W., 315 S.W. 3d 16, 24 (Tex. 2010).

2.  The child’s distress and the deterioration of the child’s ability to function.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.034(d).

•   An order for temporary  inpatient services  must  include a treatment period of  not  more than  45 days, 
except that the judge may order 90 days if they find the longer period necessary.  Tex. Health & Safety 
Code § 574.034(g).
 ◦

 
A judge may not issue an order for temporary inpatient mental health services for a proposed patient 
who is charged with a criminal offense that involves an act, attempt, or threat of serious bodily injury 
to another person.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.034(h).
 ◦

A child alleged to have engaged in delinquent conduct or CINS is not considered to be a person 
 
charged with a criminal offense.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 571.011(a).

Note: The “majority of [appellate courts] find that the requirement of ‘overt acts or patterns of behavior’ may not 
be fulfilled merely by citing a patient’s refusal of treatment.”190 

Legislative Change

S.B.  362  (86th  Reg.  Sess.  (2019))  amended  section  574.034(g)  of  the  Texas  Health  and  Safety 
Code.  The court must now provide a definitive time period in its order for temporary inpatient 
treatment not to exceed 45 days, or 90 days if the judge finds it necessary.

The  bill  also  amended subsection  574.035(h) of  the  Texas  Health  and Safety  Code,  requiring 
that for extended inpatient treatment, the court must also include a definitive time period in its order, not 
to exceed 12 months.  This allows the court to consider a shorter time period than 12 months, which was 
previously not allowed under the statute.

Note that a facility still must release a person if they no longer meet commitment criteria, even if the court-
mandated time period has not elapsed.  See O’Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 574-75 (1975) (“even if his 
involuntary confinement was initially permissible, it could not constitutionally continue after that basis no 
longer existed.”)

Order for Temporary Outpatient Mental Health Services

The judge may order a child to receive court-ordered temporary outpatient mental health services only if:

1.  The judge finds that appropriate mental health services are available to the child; and

2.  The judge or jury finds, from clear and convincing evidence, that:

A.  The child is a person with severe and persistent mental illness;

B.  As a result of the mental illness, the child will, if not treated, experience deterioration of the ability 
to function independently to the extent that the child will be unable to live safely in the community 
without court-ordered outpatient mental health services;

C.  Outpatient mental health services are needed to prevent a relapse that would likely result in serious 

harm to the child or others; and

D.  The child has an inability to participate in outpatient treatment services effectively and voluntarily, 

demonstrated by:

hearing; or

i.  Any of the child’s actions occurring within the two-year period that immediately precedes the 

ii.  Specific characteristics of the child’s clinical condition that significantly impair the child’s ability 
to make a rational and informed decision whether to submit to voluntary outpatient treatment.

charged with a criminal offense.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 571.011(a).

Legislative Change

S.B. 362 (86th Reg. Sess. (2019)) removed the former requirement for outpatient treatment that 
a court must find the patient “will continue to suffer severe and abnormal mental, emotional, or 
physical distress” and replaced it with the requirement in new section 574.0345 and 574.0355 
that  the  court  find  “outpatient  mental  health  services  are  needed  to  prevent  a  relapse  that 
would likely result in serious harm to the proposed patient or others.”

New section 574.0345 and 574.0355 also change the requirement for a court to order outpatient treatment; 
previously the court had to find that the patient’s clinical condition “makes impossible” the ability to make 
rational and informed decisions.  As amended, a court must find that the patient’s condition “significantly 
impairs” that ability.

Open and Frequent Communication Between Courts and LMHAs

In  order  to  maintain  the  most  up-to-date  information  about  the  availability  of  outpatient  mental  health 
services, courts should ensure that they are familiar with their LMHA and have a contact person who can 
provide the court with information on available resources.

Order for Extended Inpatient Mental Health Services

The judge may order a child to receive court-ordered extended inpatient mental health services only if the judge 
or the jury finds, from clear and convincing evidence, that:

1.  The child is a person with mental illness; 

2.  As a result of that mental illness the child:

A.  Is likely to cause serious harm to themselves;

B.  Is likely to cause serious harm to others; or

C.  Is:

6.7.2  Referral for Commitment Proceedings for Mental Illness

If the case is referred to an appropriate county or probate court, the judge of that court completes the commitment 
hearing process.  The juvenile court must send all papers relating to the child’s mental illness to both the clerk 
of the court to which the case is referred, and to the office of the appropriate county or district attorney.  Tex. 
Fam. Code §§ 55.39(a)(1), (2).  The papers sent to the clerk of a court constitute an application for mental health 
services under Section 574.001, Health and Safety Code.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.39(b).

If the child is in detention, the judge has three options:

•   Order the child released from detention to the child’s home or another appropriate place;

•   Order the child detained in an appropriate place other than a juvenile detention facility; or

•   If an appropriate place is not available, order the child to remain in the juvenile detention facility subject 

to further detention orders of the court.  

Tex. Fam. Code § 55.39(a)(3).

6.7.3  Standards of Care

The standard of care and  treatment  is defined  by  Subtitle  C, Title  7 of  the  Health and  Safety  Code, with  the 
exception of requiring notice by certified mail from the facility administrator to the committing court 10 days 
before the child is released.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.45(a).

6.8.1  Commitment Proceedings in Juvenile Court for Intellectual Disability

The juvenile court has the option of hearing the commitment proceeding or referring it to an appropriate county 
or probate court.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.40.

6.8.11  Application for Court-Ordered Intellectual Disability Proceedings

For  commitment  proceedings  in  juvenile  court,  the  prosecutor  must  file  an  application  for  placement  under 
Section 593.041, Health and Safety Code.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.41(a).  

•   The application must be filed in the county where the child resides.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.041(b).

current interdisciplinary team report and recommendations shall be presented in evidence.  Tex. Health 
& Safety Code § 593.050(d).

•   The party who filed the application has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that long-term 
placement of the child in a residential care facility is appropriate.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.050(e).

•   If long-term placement in a residential care facility is not found to be appropriate, the court shall enter a 
finding to that effect, dismiss the application, and if appropriate, recommend application for admission 
to voluntary services under Subchapter B.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.051.

•   In each case, the court shall promptly report in writing the decision and findings of fact.  Tex. Health & 

Safety Code § 593.053.

6.8.16  Commitment Order

A child may not be committed to a residential care facility unless each of the following elements has been proved 
beyond a reasonable doubt:197 

1.  The child is a person with an intellectual disability;

2.  Evidence is presented showing that because of the child’s intellectual disability, the child:

A.  Represents a substantial risk of physical impairment or injury to themselves or others; or

B.  Is unable to provide for and is not providing for their most basic personal physical needs;

3.  The child cannot be adequately and appropriately habilitated in an available, less restrictive setting; and

4.  The residential care facility provides habilitative services, care, training, and treatment appropriate to the 

child’s needs.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.052(a).

•   If the commitment criteria are met, and long-term placement in a residential care facility is appropriate, the 
court shall commit the child for care, treatment, and training to a community center or the department198  
when space is available at a residential care facility.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.052(b).

•   The  court  shall  immediately  send  a  copy  of  the  commitment  order  to  the  department  or  community 

center.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.052(c).

•   If placement in a residential facility is necessary, preference shall be given to the facility nearest to the 

residence of the child unless:

1.  Space in the facility is unavailable;

3.  There are other compelling reasons.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.055.

2.  The child, parent if the resident is a minor, or guardian of the child requests otherwise; or

•   A party to a commitment proceeding has the right to appeal the judgment to the appropriate court of 
appeals.  An appeal under this section shall be given a preference setting, and the county court may grant 
a stay of commitment pending appeal.  Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 593.056(a), (c) and (d).

6.8.2  Referral for Commitment Proceedings for ID

If the case is referred to an appropriate county or probate court, the judge of that court completes the commitment 
hearing process.  The juvenile court must send all papers relating to the child’s intellectual disability to both the 
clerk of the court to which the case is referred, and to the office of the appropriate county or district attorney.  Tex. 
Fam. Code §§ 55.42(a)(1), (2).  The papers sent to the clerk of a court constitute an application for mental health 
services under Section 574.001, Health and Safety Code.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.42(b).

If the child is in detention, the judge has three options:

197  See Pratt v. State, 907 S.W. 2d 38, 44 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1995, writ denied).

198  “The department” refers to DADS, which was transferred to HHSC on September 1, 2017.

6.8.3  Standards of Care

The standard of care and  treatment  is defined  by  Subtitle  D, Title  7 of  the  Health and  Safety  Code, with  the 
exception of requiring notice by certified mail from the facility administrator to the committing court 20 days 
before the child is released.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.45(b).

•  If the child is alleged to have committed an offense listed in Article 42A.054, Code of Criminal Procedure, the 
facility administrator must apply in writing, to the committing court, for authorization to release or furlough 
the child for a period of 48 hours or longer, and show good cause.  Notice of the request must be provided to 
the prosecutor.  The prosecutor, the child, or the administrator can apply for a hearing on the request.  The 
rules of evidence do not apply to the hearing, and no appeal can be taken.  If there is no request for a hearing, 
the court makes the decision based on the application for authorization.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.45(c).

6.9 

Restoration Hearing

The prosecutor can move for a restoration hearing if:

1.  The child is found unfit to proceed as a result of MI or ID; and

2.  The child:

A.  Is not:

i.  Ordered by a court to receive inpatient mental health or intellectual disability services;

ii.  Committed by a court to a residential care facility; or

iii. Ordered by a court to receive treatment or services on an outpatient basis; or

B.  Is discharged or currently on furlough from a mental health facility or outpatient center before the 

child reaches 18 years of age.

Tex. Fam. Code § 55.43(a).

•   At the restoration hearing, the court shall determine the issue of whether the child is fit to proceed.  The 
hearing is before the court, and the issue of fitness must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.  
Tex. Fam. Code §§ 55.43(b-d).

•   If the court finds that the child is fit to proceed, the court shall continue the juvenile court proceedings.  
If the court finds that the child is not fit to proceed, the court shall dismiss the motion for restoration.  
Tex. Fam. Code §§ 55.43(e), (f).

6.10 

Transfer to Criminal Court on 18th Birthday of Child

The juvenile court is required to transfer all pending proceedings from the juvenile court to a criminal court on 
the 18th birthday of a child for whom a court has ordered inpatient mental health services or residential care if:

1.  The child has not been discharged or furloughed from the facility before reaching 18 years of age; and

2.  The child is alleged to have engaged in delinquent conduct that included a violation of a penal law listed in 

Section 53.045 (Offenses Eligible for Determinate Sentence) and no adjudication has occurred.

Tex. Fam. Code § 55.44(a).

•   The juvenile court must send notification of the transfer to the facility.  The criminal court must, within 
90 days of the transfer, institute proceedings under Chapter 46B, Code of Criminal Procedure.  If those 
or  any  subsequent  proceedings  result  in  a  determination  that  the  defendant  is  competent  to  stand 
trial,  the  defendant  may  not  receive  a  punishment  for  the  conduct  that  results  in  confinement  for  a 
period longer than the maximum period of confinement they could have received if the defendant had

been adjudicated for the delinquent conduct while still a child and within the jurisdiction of the juvenile 
court199.   Tex. Fam. Code § 55.44(b). 

•   Practically, if a child turns 18 while committed to a facility, the child will be transferred to the adult unit of 
the facility.  As the child is now an adult, the child should not be returned to the juvenile detention facility 
to wait for a bed at the adult unit of the facility.  This should be handled by the facility as a direct transfer.

Practical Ideas for Counties to Streamline Fitness Restoration and Save Money200 

1. Assign One Point-of-Contact Between your County and the State Hospital.  Send a letter annually to 
the state hospital notifying them that your point-of-contact should receive all communication (name, email 
address and phone number).

2. Communicate with the State Hospital via Email or Fax.  Use email or fax to save wait time when the 
state hospital notifies the county that the juvenile is ready to be transported to or from the hospital.

3.  Urge  the  State  and  Defense  to  Continue  Working  on  the  Case  While  Waiting  for  the  Juvenile  to 
Return.  Attorneys should continue working on fitness cases to address discovery issues, plea offers, and 
other tasks during the hospitalization to allow for speedy resolution once returned.

4.  Coordinate  Transportation.    Once  the  contact  person  has  received  notice  that  a  juvenile  has  been 
restored, prepare any paperwork that is needed to schedule transportation within three days to cut time in 
getting the juvenile back to your county.

5. Develop a Policy of Quick Court Settings Upon Return from State Hospital.  Have the county point-
of-contact communicate with the court to set the juvenile’s case on a docket within three days of returning 
from the state hospital.

6. Develop a Policy of No Free Passes.  To prevent the juvenile from decompensating, make a judicial policy 
that  an  attorney  may  not  pass  a  setting  on  a  client  who  has  returned  from  the  state  hospital  unless  the 
attorney appears before the court.

7. Set Weekly Medical Meetings to Review Specific Cases.  Utilize Tex. Health and Safety Code § 614.017 
to exchange information with the LMHA(s), detention center staff, the prosecuting attorney, and the defense 
attorney.  Use these meetings to review the status of cases with fitness issues.  Keep a running list of the 
following:

 —  Who needs to be on the fitness radar?

 —  Who has improved?

 —  Is outpatient competency restoration an option?

 —  Who needs transportation to or from the state hospital?

 —  Is it time for the prosecutor to consider dismissing the case?

 —  Does  the  court  need  to  be  aware  of  any  juveniles  who  are  decompensating  or  at  risk  of 

decompensating?

 ■  Reconsider  juveniles  for  outpatient  restoration  services  if  they  have  been  stabilized  in  detention.  

This can shorten your detention center’s waitlist for state hospital.

 ■  After medical meetings, email the court any updates or reminders. that action may need to be taken 

soon.  For example, a juvenile who is deteriorating in detention.

7.  Lack of Responsibility

Lack of responsibility is akin to insanity in the adult criminal court.  While there are a number of similarities, courts 
and practitioners must also be aware of the differences.  In both contexts, it is a defense which must be proved by a 
preponderance of the evidence. Tex. Fam. Code § 55.51(d), Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.153(a)(2).  However, adult 
criminal court has a narrower test focused on whether the defendant knew at the time of the offense, due to mental 
illness or [intellectual disability], that what they were doing was wrong.  Tex. Penal Code § 8.01(a).  In contrast, the 
family code has a broader test that asks whether the juvenile respondent, at the time of the conduct, as a result of 
mental illness or an intellectual disability, lacked the substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of 
their conduct or to conform their conduct to the requirements of the law.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.51(a). 

Unlike  fitness  to  proceed,  lack of  responsibility  is a defensive  issue  presented  to  the  judge or  jury during  the 
adjudication hearing.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.51(c).  A finding of lack of responsibility means that juvenile court 
proceedings regarding the specific conduct, are over. However, commitment proceedings will continue.  Tex. Fam. 
Code § 55.51(g).  A flowchart to aid in understanding the lack of responsibility process can be found on pages 131 
and 132.

Making the Distinction: Fitness, Lack of Responsibility, Mental Illness, and Intellectual 
Disability

Fitness: relates to a juvenile’s mental state and present capacity to stand trial; fitness is not a defense to the 
charged conduct.

Lack of Responsibility: relates to the juvenile’s mental state at the time of the conduct and is an affirmative 
defense to prosecution.

Mental Illness: an illness, disease, or condition, other than epilepsy, senility, alcoholism, or mental deficiency, 
that: (A) substantially impairs a person’s thought, perception of reality, emotional process, or judgment; or (B) 
grossly impairs behavior as demonstrated by recent disturbed behavior.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.01, Tex. Health 
& Safety Code § 571.003(14).  Note that a child can have MI and be fit to proceed; similarly, a child may have MI 
but not meet the legal standard for lack of responsibility.

Intellectual  Disability:  significantly  subaverage  general  intellectual  functioning  that  is  concurrent  with 
deficits  in  adaptive  behavior  and  originates  during  the  developmental  period.    Tex.  Code  Crim.  Proc.  art. 
46B.001(8); Tex. Health & Safety Code § 591.003.  As with MI, a child can have ID and be fit to proceed; similarly, 
a child may have ID but not meet the legal standard for lack of responsibility.

When a fitness evaluation occurs close in time to the date of the delinquent conduct, it may be advantageous 
to have the examiner also offer an opinion as to whether the child lacked responsibility at the time of the 
conduct, so that vital insight into the child’s mental condition at the time is documented for future use.  It is 
also important that the expert receive the law enforcement reports in the case so they can effectively assess 
the  child’s  perceptions  and  actions  in  light  of  the  statements  by  witnesses  and  other  information  found 
during the investigation.  Practitioners must carefully review the reports to ensure that there is no mention 
of the child’s risk factors.

A checklist to assist in identifying possible MI or ID can be found on page 149.

Lack of Responsibility for Conduct (“55-D”) 
  

A  Party  to  a  Juvenile  Proceeding  on  motion  to  the  court  may 
raise  the  issue  of  lack  of  responsibility,  due  to  MI  or  ID,  for 
conduct;  whereupon  the  Court  shall  order  the  child  to  be 
examined  under  [FC  §51.20]  by  a  Disinterested  Expert 
(physician,  psychiatrist,  or  psychologist)  to  render  Expert 
Opinion on whether the child is not responsible for conduct due 
to MI or ID. [FC § 55.51(b)]. If the Expert is also appointed to 
assess the child’s fitness to proceed the Expert must additionally 
meet qualifications under CCP, Art. 46B.022

Exits from 55-D 

A child is Not Responsible For 
Conduct if, at the time of the 
conduct, the child, due to Mental 
Illness (MI) or Intellectual 
Disability (ID) lacks substantial 
capacity to:  
•  appreciate the wrongfulness of 

their conduct; or   

•  conform their conduct to the 

requirements of law.   

 [FC § 55.51(a)] 

     

*FC currently cites to agencies that no 
longer operate the State Facilities.  
[Tex. Gov’t Code § 531.0011(a)] 
substitutes HHSC for named agency. 

*The facility director is likely not an 
expert qualified to render expert 
opinion regarding MH or ID and 
whether child meets commitment 
criteria. Report should include 
evidence from qualified experts.  

 

The issue of child’s lack of responsibility for conduct, as a 
result of MI or ID, may be tried before jury or court. The 
moving party bears the burden to show the child’s lack of 
responsibility by a preponderance of the evidence.  
The  court  findings  or  jury  verdict  regarding  lack  of 
responsibility must state whether the child’s conduct was 
a result of MI or ID.  [FC § 55.51(c)-(e)] 

 

Court orders the child placed [FC § 55.52(a)] 
 

There  are  no  set  timelines  in 
Subchapter for getting Expert’s 
report  to  the  court  or  in  which 
to hold a hearing on the matter.  

There  are  also  no  parallel 
provisions  from  Subchapters  B 
and  C  regarding  a  resumption 
of proceedings if the burden of 
proof  is  not  met.  However, 
since  all  subsequent  provisions 
are contingent upon affirmative 
findings,  a  failure 
to  meet 
burden  should  logically  yield  a 
resumption of proceedings. 

If child is placed as a result of MI or ID 
and 
after 
the  Court  determines, 
consulting with the probation department 
and local treatment or service providers, 
that 
the  child  may  be  adequately

Provided  that  the  child  meets  the  civil 
commitment criteria under Subtitle C or 
D,  Title  7,  H&S  Code  (MH  Code  or

the  child  placed  in  an  inpatient  or

On  application  by  the  child's  parent, 
guardian,  or  guardian  ad  litem,  the

Developmental Period

Children who are referred to the juvenile court are, by definition, “in their developmental period” (under age 
18); therefore, a child who has a diagnosis of having a pervasive developmental disorder in a psychological 
or psychiatric report probably qualifies as having an intellectual disability.201   

Obtaining a diagnosis of intellectual disability from the LIDDA can facilitate a child’s lifetime access 
to state-funded disability services.

7.1  

Raising the Issue

•   Any party can raise the issue of lack of responsibility as a result of mental illness (MI) or intellectual 

disability (ID).  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.51(b).

•   Once the motion is filed, the court must order the child to be examined under Texas Family Code § 51.20.  

Tex. Fam. Code § 55.51(b).
 ◦

 
The information obtained from the examination must include expert opinion as to whether the child 
is not responsible for their conduct as a result of MI or ID.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.51(b).

Note:  While the Family Code permits any party to raise lack of responsibility, a decision by the State to raise the 
issue may be problematic considering the child’s 5th Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination and 
potential disclosures of the child’s defensive theories during an examination.

7.2   Qualifications of Experts

Judges should critically vet the experts they appoint.  This minimally entails verifying that an expert meets the 
statutory qualifications prior to appointment.  It should be noted that the qualifications for experts who perform 
fitness examinations and for experts who perform lack of responsibility examinations are not the same.  Experts 
who perform fitness examinations are required to meet the additional qualifications of Subchapter B, Chapter 
46B, Code of Criminal Procedure.  See page 110 of this book for more information about expert qualifications to 
perform fitness examinations.

•   The expert opinion as to whether the child lacks responsibility can be from a physician, psychiatrist, or 
psychologist;  however,  the expert  must also  be qualified  by education and clinical  training  in  mental 
health or [intellectual disability] and experienced in forensic evaluation.  Tex. Fam. Code § 51.20(a).

Disinterested Experts and Evaluations

Texas  Family  Code  §  51.20  authorizes  the  appointment  of  a  “disinterested  expert,  including  a  physician, 
psychiatrist,  or  psychologist,  qualified  by  education  and  clinical  training  in  mental  health  or  [intellectual 
disability] and experienced in forensic evaluation...”  Tex. Fam. Code § 51.20(a).  It can be difficult to determine 
what type of assessment is needed when trying to help a child.  This is in part due to shared skills that exist 
across  various  professions.    Below  are  the  general  responsibilities  of  specialized  practitioners.    As  noted 
above, forensic experience and specialized training are factors to consider when deciding on an evaluator, 
as well as availability.

Psychiatrist: Medical doctor that focuses on disorders of mood or thinking including depression, anxiety, 
ADHD, and psychosis.  Utilizes clinical interview, self-report measures and review of collateral information 
as  part  of  assessment.    Treatment  modalities  include  medication  and  referral  to  psychotherapy.    Some 
psychiatrists also provide therapy themselves.

Psychologist: Doctorate-level clinician that focuses on disorders of mood or thinking including depression, 
anxiety,  ADHD,  and  psychosis.    Utilizes  psychological  testing,  self-report  measures,  clinical  interview  and 
review of collateral information as part of assessment.  Treatment modalities include individual, family, and 
group therapy along with skills training.

Neuropsychologist: Psychologist specializing in disorders of thinking including dementia; developmental, 
learning or attention disabilities; and traumatic brain injury.  Utilizes clinical interview, self-report measures, 
review  of  collateral  information,  and  specialized  psychological  testing  including  measures  of  executive, 
visuospatial, and memory functioning as part of assessment.  Treatment modalities include skills training to 
address neuropsychological challenges and referral to ancillary therapies.

Neurologist: Medical doctor that focuses on disorders of the brain and nervous system including Parkinson’s, 
multiple sclerosis, stroke, muscle weakness, and ADHD.  Utilizes physical exam, electroencephalogram (EEG), 
electromyography (EMG), or imaging as part of assessment.  Treatment modalities include medication and 
referral to ancillary therapies such as physical or occupational therapy.

Finally, it is important that the expert use measures and processes with the youth that are developmentally, 
academically, culturally, and linguistically appropriate for the child.

7.3   Hearing on Issue of Lack of Responsibility

•   The issue of whether the child is not responsible for their conduct as a result of MI or ID shall be tried to 

the judge or the jury in the adjudication hearing.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.51(c).

•   Lack of responsibility must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.51(d).

•   The judge or jury must state in its findings or verdict whether the child is not responsible for their conduct 

due to MI or ID.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.51(e).
 ◦

If  the case  is  tried  to a  jury,  the verdict  forms  must contain a special  issue  for  the  jury  to  indicate 
 
whether the child lacked responsibility or did not lack responsibility.

 ◦

 
Note:  Because there is no statutory notice requirement for lack of responsibility, it can be raised by 
either party at any point during the adjudication phase.

7.4  

Proceedings Following a Finding of Lack of Responsibility

Once  the child  has  been  found  to  lack  responsibility, a  temporary commitment of  up  to  90 days  is  required, 
provided that the child meets the commitment criteria under Subtitle C202  or D,203  Title 7, Health and Safety 
Code.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.52.

202  See Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.034 for Temporary Inpatient Mental Health Services criteria or see page 120; and see Tex. Health & Safety 
Code § 574.0345 for Temporary Outpatient Mental Health Services criteria or see page 121.

203  See Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.052 for Intellectual Disability criteria or see page 127.

Legislative Change

H.B. 2107 (87th Reg. Sess. (2021)) added the option for a child who is unfit to proceed due to an 
intellectual  disability  to  receive  services  or  treatment  in  an  outpatient  setting.    Before  this 
change, a child who was unfit to proceed due to ID could only receive services or treatment at 
an inpatient facility.

•   If the lack of responsibility is due to MI, there are three placement options:

Placement with the [Texas Health and Human Services Commission]204  (state hospital);
 

Placement in a private psychiatric facility,205  on application by the child’s parent, guardian, or guardian 
 
ad litem, so long as the facility administrator agrees in writing; or

Placement in an outpatient program, if the court approves of the treatment setting.
 

•   If the lack of responsibility is due to ID, there are two placement options:

Placement  with  the  [Texas  Health  and  Human  Services  Commission]206    (state  supported  living 
 
center); or

Placement in an outpatient program, if the court approves of the treatment setting.
 

 ◦
 ◦

 ◦

 ◦

 ◦

Tex. Fam. Code § 55.52(a).

Best Practices After a Finding of Lack of Responsibility

It is recommended for the probation officer to contact the Continuity of Services Coordinator and staff as 
soon as possible after a child is committed to a State Hospital or State Supported Living Center to advise 
them of the potential commitment.  The Coordinator may then provide guidance to the probation officer 
regarding preparation of documentation.

As of this writing, the State Hospital Continuity of Services Coordinator is Pam Marroquin, who can be reached 
at forensicadmissions@hhsc.state.tx.us or (512) 206-5056.

As of this writing, the State Supported Living Center Continuity of Services Coordinator is Nicole Hawk, who can 
be reached at (512) 438-3076.  As soon as an expert opinion concludes that a child presents with an intellectual 
or developmental disability, the probation officer should request an IDD Determination assessment through 
the LIDDA.  Proactively submitting a referral can help the child and family receive support sooner regardless 
of whether the child is deemed responsible.

7.5  

Transportation

•   If  the  court  issues  a  placement  order,  the  court  must  order  the  probation  department  or  the  sheriff’s 

department to transport the child to and from the designated facility.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.53(a).
 ◦

 
Upon receipt of a report from a facility, the child shall be returned to juvenile court by the 11th day 
after the date of the court’s order, then the facility is required to transport the child to the court, at the 
county’s expense.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.53(b), (c).

204  Note that the text of the statute indicates the placement is with the Department of State Health Services (DSHS).  The 84th Legislature made 
structural changes to the Health and Human Services system, including the transfer of some DSHS functions to HHSC.  As of September 1, 2017, 
all state hospitals transferred to HHSC from DSHS.

205  If funding is specifically budgeted for it, the court can order the state to pay the cost of placing a child in a private psychiatric facility, regardless 
of whether the lack of responsibility is due to MI or ID.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.52(b).

206  Note that the text of the statute indicates the placement is with the Department of Aging and Disability Services (DADS).  As part of the changes 
made by the 84th Legislature, all remaining DADS functions were transferred to HHSC in September 2017.

7.6 

Information Required to be Sent to the Facility

•  The court must order the probation department to send copies of any information in their possession
that is relevant to the issue of the child’s MI or ID to the treatment provider.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.35(a).  
This may include information in the court’s file, the probation department’s file, the detention facility
file, and/or medical or mental health files maintained by the probation department and/or its medical or
mental health providers.

A checklist for locating potential materials in the Juvenile Probation Department’s possession can be found on 
page 151.

7.7 

Report due to the Court

•  Before the 75th day after the commitment order, the treatment provider must submit a report to the court.
The report must describe the treatment or services provided to the child and state the facility director’s
opinion as to whether the child has a mental illness or an intellectual disability.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.54(b).  
◦

The court  must provide a copy of the facility’s report to the prosecutor and to the child’s attorney.
 
Tex. Fam. Code § 55.54(c).

The best practice is for the Court to set a status hearing for the 75th day to be sure the report is received and 
distributed to all parties.

75th Day

7.8 

Report that Child Does Not Have Mental Illness or Intellectual Disability

•  If the facility report states the child does not have a mental illness or an intellectual disability, the juvenile 
court shall discharge the child unless the prosecutor objects in writing not later than two days after the 
attorney receives the report, or a determinate sentence adjudication hearing was conducted.  Tex. Fam.
Code § 55.55(a).

•  If a proper objection is made, the court must hold a hearing to determine whether the child has a MI or
ID and meets the commitment criteria for civil commitment under Subtitle C or D, Title 7, Health and
Safety Code.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.55(b).

•  This hearing is before the court, without a jury.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.55(b).

•  The burden of proof is on the state to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the child has a MI or 

ID and meets the criteria for civil commitment.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.55(c).

•  If the court finds that the child does not have a MI or ID and that the child does not meet the criteria for

civil commitment, the court shall discharge the child.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.55(d).

•  If the court finds that the child has a MI or ID and the child meets the criteria for civil commitment, the

court shall issue an appropriate commitment order.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.55(e).

7.9 

Report that Child has Mental Illness

At this point the procedures for commitment due to MI and ID become separate: §§ 55.56 through 55.58 govern 
mental  illness  while  §§  55.59  through  55.61  govern  intellectual  disability.207      The  director  of  the  facility  that 
supplied the report must submit two certificates of medical examination (CMEs) to the court.  Tex. Fam. Code  
§ 55.56.  Once the court receives the CMEs, it can initiate commitment proceedings.

Section 7.9e contains a detailed discussion of CMEs.  A sample CME form can be found on page 153.

7.9a   Commitment Proceedings in Juvenile Court for Mental Illness

The juvenile court has the option of hearing the commitment proceeding or referring it to an appropriate county 
or probate court.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.56.

Juvenile Court or Probate Court

The choice of whether to proceed with commitment in juvenile court or to refer the proceedings to a county or 
probate court rests exclusively with the juvenile court.  A juvenile court that hears commitment proceedings 
infrequently may prefer to have the county or probate court conduct them.  The standards for commitment 
are the same, regardless of which court holds the commitment hearing.  County or probate courts may have 
more frequent interaction with community-based treatment options, private placements, and state facilities.  
Judges in a community can discuss available resources to determine which approach is advantageous for 
their constituents.  If the juvenile court chooses to refer the case to a county or probate court, it is important 
to maintain ongoing communication concerning the child’s progress and case status.

7.9b   Application for Court-Ordered Mental Health Proceedings

For commitment proceedings in juvenile court, the prosecutor must file an application for court-ordered mental 
health services under Section 574.001, Health and Safety Code.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.57(a).

What Should be Included in the Application

An application must:

•   Be styled using the child’s initials and not the proposed patient’s full name;

•   State whether the application is for temporary or extended services;

•   Contain the child’s name, address, and county of residence in Texas;

•   Include a statement that the child is a person with mental illness and meets the criteria in Chapter 574 for 

court-ordered mental health services; and

•   State whether the child is charged with a criminal offense.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.002(b), (c).

137

Application Requirements for Extended Court-Ordered Services

Applications for extended court-ordered services have several statutory requirements that applications for 
temporary court-ordered services do not require.

 ■  An application for extended inpatient mental health services must state that the child has received:

 —  Court-ordered  inpatient  mental  health  services  under  either  this  subtitle  or  under  Chapter  46B, 
Subchapter  D  of  the  Texas  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  (Procedures  after  Determination  of 
Incompetency)  or  Subchapter  E  (Civil  Commitment:  Charges  Pending)  for  at  least  60  consecutive 
days during the prior 12 months.

 ■  An  application  for  extended  outpatient  mental  health  services  must  state  that  the  child  has 

received:

 —  Court-ordered  inpatient  mental  health  services  under  either  this  subtitle  or  under  Chapter  46B, 
Subchapter D or E of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure for a total of at least 60 days during the 
prior 12 months; OR

 —  Court-ordered outpatient mental health services under this subtitle or Chapter 46B, Subchapters D or 

E during the preceding 60 days.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.002(b).

7.9c   Appointment and Duties of an Attorney under HSC 574.004208 

•   The judge must appoint an attorney for the child within 24 hours after the application is filed unless the 

child already has an attorney.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.003(a).

•   Texas codifies the duties that an attorney has toward a client in a court-ordered services proceeding in 
section 574.004, and the court is required to give a copy of these duties to every court-appointed attorney.  
Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.003(b).

Included in the list of duties owed by the attorney to the proposed patient, is that the attorney must respect the 
client’s decision to agree or resist the efforts to provide mental health services, even though they may personally 
disagree  with  the  client’s  wishes.    Though  the  attorney  may  provide  counsel,  the  attorney  must  abide  by  the 
client’s final decision on the matter.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.004(c).

Attorney-Client Relationship

An attorney’s rapport with the child they represent is critical and can be life altering.  Especially for children 
who have more significant issues, it is important to recognize that attorneys will need to make multiple visits 
with the child, which may include meeting with him or her immediately before the evaluation appointments 
with the purpose of reinforcing the significance of the evaluation and how it will impact the child’s case.

7.9d   Setting the Commitment Hearing in Juvenile Court

The  juvenile court  must set a date for the  hearing and provide  notice as required under  Sections  574.005 and 
574.006, Health and Safety Code.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.57(a)(1).

•   The court  must set a  hearing within  14 days of  the date  the application was  filed  but  may  not  hold a 
hearing within the first three days after the application is filed if the child or their attorney objects.  Tex. 
Health & Safety Code §§ 574.005(a), (b).
 ◦

There are witnesses who may appear at the hearing to present evidence, who may be unknown to the 
 

208  See page 116 for additional comments on the statutory responsibility of attorneys in commitment cases.

parties prior to the hearing date.  If either party wishes, they may request a continuance  based on 
surprise and the court may continue the hearing date.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.006(d).

•   While the court may grant continuances of the hearing, the final hearing must be held no later than 30 
days from the date the application was filed.  The only exception is for extreme weather or disaster, in 
which case the judge may, by a written order each day, postpone the hearing for 24 hours.  Tex. Health & 
Safety Code § 574.005(c).

Note:  While the hearing must commence within 30 days, the Court retains its plenary authority to continue the 
hearing as necessary should issues arise.

•   The child and their attorney are entitled to receive a copy of the application and written notice of the 
court hearing immediately after it is set.  Notice must also be delivered in person or via certified mail to 
the child’s:
 ◦
 ◦
 ◦

Each managing and possessory conservator, if applicable.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.006(b).
 

Appointed guardian, if applicable; or
 

Parent, if a minor; or
 

•   If a parent cannot be located, and the child does not have a guardian or conservator, the notice may be 

given to the proposed patient’s next of kin.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.006(c).

7.9e   Medical Examination Requirement

•   The director of the facility that supplied the report must submit two certificates of medical examination 

(CMEs)209  to the court.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.56.  

•   The two CMEs must be completed within the preceding 30 days, and are required to be on file with the 
court.  At least one of the physicians must be a psychiatrist if a psychiatrist is available in the county.  Tex. 
Health & Safety Code § 574.009(a).

•   The court also  has  the authority  to order an  independent evaluation of  the child,  by a  psychiatrist of 
the child’s choosing, if the court feels it will assist the finder of fact.  If the child is indigent, the county 
may  reimburse  the child’s appointed attorney  for any expenses  incurred  in  securing  the  psychiatrist’s 
testimony.  Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 574.010(a), (b).  

Note: Texas Health & Safety Code § 574.009 (a) requires that at least one of the physicians completing the CMEs 
must be a psychiatrist if a psychiatrist is available in the county.  In the event that the Court determines that a 
psychiatrist  is  not available  in the county, the  Court should enter an order finding that a psychiatrist was  not 
available in the County to provide a CME and making specific finds detailing the factual basis supporting that 
finding.

7.9f   Commitment Hearing

The court must conduct the hearing in accordance with Subchapter C, Chapter 574, Health and Safety Code.  Tex. 
Fam. Code § 55.57(a)(2).  The commitment hearing is heard by the court, without a jury.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.55(b).

•   The child is entitled to be present at the hearing, but the child or their attorney may waive this right.  Tex. 

Health & Safety Code § 574.031(c).  

•   The hearing must be open to the public unless the child or their attorney requests that it be closed, and 

the court finds good cause to do so.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(d).

Commitment Hearing Considerations

Given the sensitive nature of juvenile proceedings and of mental health and intellectual disability issues, the 
Court should carefully consider whether it is appropriate for the hearing to be open to the public. 

Consideration  should  also  be  given  as  to  whether  it  is  appropriate  for  the  child  to  attend  the  hearing.    It 
is possible that attending the hearing and listening to testimony could negatively impact the child and the 
child’s current mental state, especially if the child is currently in detention.  

If  using  certain  terminology  will  upset  the  child  or  hinder  the  child’s  ability  to  participate  in  the  hearing, 
acronyms can be used.

Regardless of whether the child attends the hearing, the child’s attorney should ensure the child understands 
the  nature  of  the  hearing,  the  anticipated  testimony,  and  the  significance  of  the  testimony  to  the  child’s 
future.

If a child is under the age of 14 at the time of the hearing, the court shall close the hearing to the 
public, unless the court finds that the interests of the child or the public would be better served by 
opening the hearing to the public.  Tex. Fam. Code § 54.08(c).

•   Note:  There are significant differences in temporary and extended commitment hearings:

In a hearing for temporary inpatient or outpatient mental health services, the child or their attorney 
 
may waive the right to cross-examine witnesses by filing a written waiver with the court.  If that right 
is waived, the court may admit the CMEs as evidence, the CMEs will constitute competent medical or 
psychiatric testimony, and the court can make its findings based solely on the CMEs.  Tex. Health & 
Safety Code § 574.031(d-1).

In a hearing for extended inpatient or outpatient mental health services, the court must hear testimony 
 
and cannot make findings solely from the CMEs.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(d-2).

•   The  commitment  hearing  is  governed  by  the  Texas  Rules  of  Evidence  unless  stated  otherwise  in  this 

subtitle.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(e).

•   Each  element  of  the  applicable  criteria  must  be  proven  by  clear and convincing evidence,  and  the 

hearing must be on the record.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(g).

•   The  court  may  consider  the  testimony  of  a  non-physician  mental  health  professional  in  addition  to 

medical or psychiatric testimony.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.031(f).

•   After conducting the hearing, the juvenile court shall:

 
If the criteria under Section 574.034 or 574.0345, Health and Safety Code, are satisfied, order temporary 
mental health services for the child; or

 
If the criteria under Section 574.035 or 574.0355, Health and Safety Code, are satisfied, order extended 
mental health services for the child. 

Tex. Fam. Code § 55.57(b).

 ◦ A party to a commitment proceeding can appeal the judgment to the appropriate court of appeals.  
Notice of appeal must be filed no later than 10 days after the date the order is signed.  Tex. Health & 
Safety Code §§ 574.070(a), (b).

Note:  If  the  judge  fails  to  find,  from  clear and convincing evidence,  that  the child  is a  person with  mental 
illness and meets the applicable commitment criteria, the court shall enter an order denying the application for 
court-ordered temporary or extended mental health services, and order the immediate release of the 
child.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.033.

7.9g   Commitment Orders

Orders Must Clearly Specify Commitment Criteria

The Code requires that orders for temporary or extended inpatient treatment must specify which criteria the 
judge or jury is basing their decision upon.  There has been conflicting caselaw in this area.  Some appellate 
courts have allowed an order to submit the criteria in the disjunctive (i.e. listing the criteria with OR), while 
other courts have found that listing the criteria in the conjunctive (with AND) is the only way to ensure that 
there are specific findings.210 

A  suggested  practice  to  avoid  any  confusion  is  to  take  the  word  “or”  out  of  any  order  for  temporary  or 
extended inpatient treatment, thus requiring specific finding on any of the criteria listed.

Order for Temporary Inpatient Mental Health Services

The judge may order a child to receive court-ordered temporary inpatient mental health services only if the judge 
or jury finds, from clear and convincing evidence, that:

1.  The child is a person with mental illness; and 

2.  As a result of that mental illness the child:

A.  Is likely to cause serious harm to themselves;

B.  Is likely to cause serious harm to others; or

C.  Is: 

i.  Suffering severe and abnormal mental, emotional, or physical distress;

ii.  Experiencing  substantial  mental  or  physical  deterioration  of  the  child’s  ability  to  function 
independently, which  is exhibited  by the child’s  inability, except  for reasons of  indigence, to 
provide for the child’s basic needs, including food, clothing, health, or safety; and

iii. Unable to make a rational and informed decision as to whether or not to submit to treatment.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.034(a).

•   If the judge finds that the child meets the commitment criteria, the judge must specify which criterion 
listed in Subsection (a)(2) forms the basis for the decision.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.034(c). 

•   To be clear and convincing, the evidence must include expert testimony and, unless waived, evidence of 

a recent overt act211  or a continuing pattern of behavior that tends to confirm:

1.  The likelihood of serious harm to the child or others; or

2.  The child’s distress and the deterioration of the child’s ability to function.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.034(d).

•   An order for temporary  inpatient services  must  include a treatment period of  not  more than  45 days, 
except that the judge may order 90 days if they find the longer period necessary.  Tex. Health & Safety Code 
§ 574.034(g).

•   A judge may not issue an order for temporary inpatient mental health services for a proposed patient 
who is charged with a criminal offense that involves an act, attempt, or threat of serious bodily injury to 
another person.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 571.011(a).
 ◦

 
A  child  alleged  to  have  engaged  in  delinquent  conduct  or  CINS  is  not  considered  to  be  a  person 
charged with a criminal offense.  Texas Health & Safety Code § 571.011(a).

210  Hon. Guy Herman, Mental Health Law 8 (Aug. 2019) (unpublished manuscript) (on file with the Judicial Commission on Mental Health).

211  Note that the Texas Supreme Court, in State v. K.E.W., clarified the “overt act” requirement.  The Court held that the act does not have to be ac-
tually harmful or demonstrate that harm to others is imminent.  The case also states that speech alone may be considered an over act.  See State 
v. K.E.W., 315 S.W.3d 16, 24. (Tex. 2010).

Note: The “majority of [appellate courts] find that the requirement of ‘overt acts or patterns of behavior’ may not 
be fulfilled merely by citing a patient’s refusal of treatment.”212 

Order for Temporary Outpatient Mental Health Services

The judge may order a child to receive court-ordered temporary outpatient mental health services only if:

1.  The judge finds that appropriate mental health services are available to the child; and

2.  The judge finds, from clear and convincing evidence, that:

A.  The child is a person with severe and persistent mental illness;

B.  As a result of the mental illness, the child will, if not treated, experience deterioration of the ability 
to function independently to the extent that the child will be unable to live safely in the community 
without court-ordered outpatient mental health services; 

C.  Outpatient mental health services are needed to prevent a relapse that would likely result in serious 

harm to the child or others; and

D.  The child has an inability to participate in outpatient services effectively and voluntarily, demonstrated 

by:

hearing; or

i.  Any of the child’s actions occurring within the two-year period that immediately precedes the 

ii.  Specific characteristics of the child’s clinical condition that significantly impair the child’s ability 
to make a rational and informed decision whether to submit to voluntary outpatient treatment.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.0345(a).

•   To be clear and convincing, the evidence must include expert testimony and evidence of a recent overt 

act or a continuing pattern of behavior that tends to confirm:
 ◦

 
The deterioration of ability to function independently to the extent that the child will be unable to live 
safely in the community;

 ◦

 ◦

 
The need for outpatient mental health services to prevent a relapse that would likely result in serious 
harm to the child or others; and

The child’s inability to participate in outpatient treatment services effectively and voluntarily.
 

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.0345(b).

•   An order  for temporary outpatient  mental  health services  must state that treatment  is authorized  for 
not longer than 45 days, but the judge may specify a period up to 90 days if the judge finds that the longer 
period is necessary.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.0345(c).

•   A judge may not issue an order for temporary outpatient mental health services for a proposed patient 
who is charged with a criminal offense that involves an act, attempt, or threat of serious bodily injury to 
another person.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 574.034(h).
 ◦

 
A  child  alleged  to  have  engaged  in  delinquent  conduct  or  CINS  is  not  considered  to  be  a  person 
charged with a criminal offense.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 571.011(a).

Open and Frequent Communication Between Courts and LMHAs

In  order  to  maintain  the  most  up-to-date  information  about  the  availability  of  outpatient  mental  health 
services, courts should ensure that they are familiar with their LMHA and have a contact person who can 
provide the court with information on available services.  Strong and consistent communication between the 
detention center, LMHA, and state facilities can smoothen a child’s transition from community to inpatient 
facility and ensure continuity of care.

A.  Is likely to cause serious harm to themselves;

B.  Is likely to cause serious harm to others; or

C.  Is:

7.10   Referral for Commitment Proceedings for Mental Illness

If the case is referred to an appropriate county or probate court, the judge of that court completes the commitment 
hearing process.  The juvenile court must send all papers relating to the child’s mental illness to both the clerk of 
the court to which the case is referred, and to the office of the appropriate county or district attorney.  Tex. Fam.

under Section 574.001, Health and Safety Code.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.58(b).  

If the child is in detention, the judge has three options:

•   Order the child released from detention to the child’s home or another appropriate place;

•   Order the child detained in an appropriate place other than a juvenile detention facility; or

•   If an appropriate place is not available, order the child to remain in the juvenile detention facility subject 

to further detention orders of the court.

If the report states that the child has an intellectual disability and meets the criteria for civil commitment under 
Subtitle D, Title 7, Health and safety Code, the director of the residential care facility must submit an affidavit to 
the court that states the conclusions reached as a result of the diagnosis.  Tex. Fam Code § 55.59.  Once the court 
receives the affidavit, it can initiate commitment proceedings.

A child may not be committed to a residential care facility unless each of the following elements has been proven 
beyond a reasonable doubt:219 

1.  The child is a person with an intellectual disability;

2.  Evidence is presented showing that because of the child’s intellectual disability, the child:

A.  Represents a substantial risk of physical impairment or injury to themselves or others; or

B.  Is unable to provide for and is not providing for their most basic personal physical needs;

3.  The child cannot be adequately and appropriately habilitated in an available, less restrictive setting; and

4.  The residential care facility provides habilitative services, care, training, and treatment appropriate to the 

child’s needs.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.052(a).

•   If the commitment criteria are met, and long-term placement in a residential care facility is appropriate, 
the court shall commit the child for care, treatment, and training to a community center or the department  
220when space is available at a residential care facility.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.052(b).

•   The  court  shall  immediately  send  a  copy  of  the  commitment  order  to  the  department  or  community 

center.  Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.052(c).

•   If placement in a residential facility is necessary, preference shall be given to the facility nearest to the 

residence of the child unless:

219  See Pratt v. State, 907 S.W. 2d 38, 44 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1995, writ denied).

220  “The department” refers to DADS, which was transferred to HHSC on September 1, 2017.

1.  Space in the facility is unavailable;

2.  The child, parent if the resident is a minor, or guardian of the child requests otherwise; or

3.  There are other compelling reasons.

Tex. Health & Safety Code § 593.055.

•   A party to a commitment proceeding has the right to appeal the judgment to the appropriate court of 
appeals.  An appeal under this section shall be given a preference setting, and the county court may grant 
a stay of commitment pending appeal.  Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 593.056(a), (c), and (d).

Least Restrictive Environment

It is vital for attorneys, the judiciary, and probation officials to focus on the least restrictive environment in 
which a youth’s needs can be met, and on the importance of youth entering into an appropriate treatment 
setting outside of detention as quickly as possible.

7.12   Referral for Commitment Proceedings for Intellectual Disability

If the case is referred to an appropriate county or probate court, the judge of that court completes the commitment 
hearing process.  The juvenile court must send all papers relating to the child’s intellectual disability to both the 
clerk of the court to which the case is referred, and to the office of the appropriate county or district attorney.  Tex. 
Fam. Code §§ 55.61(a)(1), (2).  The papers sent to the clerk of a court constitute an application for placement under 
Section 593.04, Health and Safety Code.  Tex. Fam. Code § 55.61(b).

If the child is in detention, the judge has three options:

•   Order the child released from detention to the child’s home or another appropriate place;

•   Order the child detained in an appropriate place other than a juvenile detention facility; or

•   If an appropriate place is not available, order the child to remain in the juvenile detention facility subject 

to further detention orders of the court.

Tex. Fam. Code § 55.61(a)(3).

Appendix

CHAPTER 55 ISSUES CHECKLIST221

This  checklist’s  purpose  is  to  help  Juvenile  Law  Practitioners  determine  if  there  are  issues  with  a  child’s  mental 
health or developmental level (intellectual disability) which need to be evaluated by a professional. It is not intend-
ed to replace an evaluation by a qualified professional if there are any concerns regarding whether a child is fit to 
proceed.

If the answer to any of the above is “No”, you may need to go through the full screening questions in Part II. 

First, is there a Chapter 55 Issue? 

Can you talk to the client and do they understand what is going on?

If there appears to be an issue, consider the following questions: 

Part I – (Short screening test) 

Can you have a coherent conversation with your client? Yes / No 

Does the Client understand the charges? Yes / No 

Does the Client understand the role of the prosecutor? Yes / No 

Does the Client understand the role of the judge? Yes / No 

Does the Client understand your role (Defense Attorney)? Yes / No

Part II – (Full screening) 

Mental Health History: 

Is there a history of mental health or intellectual disability issues? 

If so, is it a mental health history, an intellectual disability history, or both?

What, if any treatment(s), has the client received? 

School History: 

Has the client had an ARD (Admission, Review, and Dismissal hearing)? 

Are they in special education classes, and if so, which subjects? 

(AND: who were the treating physicians, social workers, therapists, etc.; what medications have been prescribed, 
has the client been hospitalized for treatment or sent to a residential treatment center (RTC))

Be sure to get all the client’s school records.  This will probably require 2 or 3 subpoenas, one for academic records 
including achievement tests, one for counseling records, and a third for disciplinary records. 

Parental Questions: 

How well does the client understand concepts/assignments? 

NOTE: If the answer is that they get it, you just have to tell them 3-4 times, this may indicate an issue of fitness to 
proceed. 

Is there a history of inhalant abuse? 

Is there anything of concern in client’s developmental history, any accidents with head trauma, any illnesses with 
high fever, loss of consciousness, etc.?

Detailed Conversation With Client: 

When talking to a client, be sure to test not only how the client responds to individual questions and legal concepts, 
but also test the client’s short-term memory.  For many clients, it will be clear as part of a regular interview that the 
juvenile understands the charges again them and is able to discuss the charges with you and to prepare a defense.  
For others, it may be less clear and will require specific probing questions to be sure fitness to proceed is assessed.  
This is especially true with juveniles who have had prior contact with the mental health system.  With an individual 
who has had prior mental health treatment, especially treatment including competency restoration, practitioners 
need to ask the child to explain the role of a judge, prosecutor, and lawyer in their own words.  Often those who 
have been through competency restoration treatments will repeat the textbook definition of an attorney, judge, 
etc., however they may have no understanding of what the words in the memorized definition actually mean. 

Practice Tip: The amount of time necessary to test a client’s short-term memory will vary with the client and the 
nature of their issues.  In some cases, the damage, especially from inhalant abuse will be so profound that a period 
of 5 minutes is enough, while other clients’ short-term memory deficits may only appear after the passage of 30 
minutes or more. It is important to identify the amount of time at which short term memory deficits appear in order 
to provide the mental health professional insight into those issues so that they can be adequately addressed during 
the evaluation and in the professional’s reports to the court.
