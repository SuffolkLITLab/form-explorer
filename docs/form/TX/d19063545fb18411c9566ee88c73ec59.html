STATEWIDE RULES GOVERNING 
ELECTRONIC FILING in CRIMINAL CASES 
 

PART 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS 

ule 1.1 Scope 

These rules govern the electronic filing of documents with the clerk in criminal cases in appellate 
courts, district courts, statutory county courts, and constitutional county courts in those counties 
in which criminal case electronic filing has been implemented pursuant to Rule 1.2 of these rules. 
A justice court or municipal court may implement criminal case electronic filing. If a justice court 
or municipal court implements  an electronic  filing system, the system must  comply  with  these 
rules. 

ule 1.2 Electronic Filing 

Clerks serving Texas appellate courts, district courts, statutory county courts, and constitutional 
county  courts  must  implement  criminal  case  electronic  filing  in  compliance  with  the  Court  of 
Criminal Appeals’ Order Mandating Statewide Electronic Filing in Criminal Cases (Misc. Docket 
No. 16-003) entered June 30, 2016, and any subsequent orders entered by the Court of Criminal 
Appeals governing electronic filing. A clerk may implement criminal case electronic filing prior 
to  the  mandatory  date  set  out  in  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals’  Order  Mandating  Statewide 
Electronic Filing in Criminal Cases. Once a court becomes subject to mandatory electronic filing, 
attorneys must electronically file all documents, pleadings, and materials filed in that court through 
the electronic filing portal provided or approved by the Office of Court Administration, except 
where these rules or other Texas law allow or mandate non-electronic (paper) filing. Attorneys 
must not file documents through any alternative electronic document filing transmission system, 
except in the event of an emergency or where these rules provide for the use of the alternative 
filing transmission system. Unrepresented parties may electronically file documents but it is not 
required.  

ule 1.3 Exceptions 

The following may not be electronically filed: 

1) documents filed under seal or presented to the court in camera; and 
(2) documents to which access is otherwise restricted by these rules, law, or court order. 

ule 1.4 Documents Containing Signatures 

(a) A document that is electronically served, filed, or issued by a court or clerk is considered signed 
if the document includes: 
(1) a “/s/” and name typed in the space where the signature would otherwise appear, unless the 
document is notarized or sworn; or 
(2) an electronic image or scanned image of the signature. 
(b)  If  a  paper  document  must  be  notarized,  sworn  to,  or  made  under  oath,  the  filer  may 
electronically file the paper document as a scanned image containing the necessary signature(s). 
(c) If a paper document requires the signature of an opposing party, the filer may electronically 
file the paper document as a scanned image containing the opposing party’s signature.

Rule 1.5 Courts Authorized to Make Electronic Orders 
A judge may electronically sign an order by applying his or her electronic signature to the order.  
Judges are not required to electronically sign orders. 

omment to Part 1:  These rules do not apply to court reporters, charging instruments, exhibits 
filed in a hearing or trial, or documents, such as plea paperwork, filed directly with a judge, and 
do not  mandate electronic filing of these items.  These rules do not  authorize a clerk to  require 
electronic filing by persons not represented by an attorney. Clerks should maintain a process for 
filing paper submissions from such filers. These rules also do not  affect  whether electronically 
filed  documents  may  be  posted  on  the  internet.  Any  posting  of  filed  documents,  pleadings,  or 
materials to the internet must comply with Part 4 of these rules. 

ART 2. FILING MECHANISM 

ule 2.1 Office of Court Administration established Electronic Filing Manager 

Electronic filing must be done through the electronic filing manager established by the Office of 
Court  Administration  and  an  electronic  filing  service  provider  certified  by  the  Office  of  Court 
Administration  or  through  another  electronic  filing  portal  approved  by  the  Office  of  Court 
Administration. 

ule 2.2 Format 

An electronically filed document must: 

1) be in text-searchable portable document format (PDF); 
(2) be directly converted to PDF rather than scanned, if possible; 
(3) not be locked; and 
(4) otherwise comply with the Technology Standards set by the Judicial Committee on Information 
Technology and approved by the Supreme Court and the Court of Criminal Appeals. 

ule 2.3 Timely Filing 

(a) Unless a statute, rule, or court order requires that a document be filed by a certain time of day, 
a document is considered timely filed if it is electronically filed at any time before midnight (in 
the court’s time zone) on the day of the filing deadline. An electronically filed document is deemed 
filed when transmitted to the filing party’s electronic filing service provider, except: 
(1) if a document is transmitted on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, it is deemed filed on the 
next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday; and 
(2) if a document requires a motion and an order allowing its filing, the document is deemed filed 
on the date the motion is granted. 
(b) If a document is untimely filed due to a technical failure or a system outage, the filing party 
may seek appropriate relief from the court. 

omment  to  Rule  2.3:  This  rule  addresses  when  a  document  is  timely  filed  for  purposes  of 
meeting a legal deadline imposed by a statute or a court. A clerk’s acceptance of a document on a 
weekend or legal holiday does not impact whether a document is timely filed under this rule.

Rule 2.4 E-Mail Address Required 
The  email  address  of  any  person  who  electronically  files  a  document  must  be  included  on  the 
document. 

ule 2.5 Paper Copies 

At the time of filing, a filer need not provide paper copies of an electronically filed document. A 
filer should provide paper copies of electronically filed documents upon request by a court. 

ule 2.6 Non-Conforming Documents 

The clerk may not refuse a document that fails to conform to these rules. But the clerk may identify 
the error to be corrected and state a deadline for the party to resubmit the document in a conforming 
format. 

omment to Rule 2.6: The intent of this rule is to establish that a clerk may not refuse a document 
for any perceived violation of these rules. However, the rule permits a clerk the limited authority 
to identify errors the clerk perceives with whether a filing complies with the Judicial Committee 
on Information Technology Standards currently in effect. When a clerk notifies a filer of an error, 
it is inconsequential to a judicial determination regarding whether the document submitted actually 
violates  these  rules,  and  it  does  not  constitute  an  extension  of  time  to  file  the  document.  The 
purpose of the deadline is to allow for a non-conforming document to be conformed to these rules. 
The deadline for correction established by the clerk should permit only a reasonable amount of 
time to allow for the filing to be conformed to the requirements of these rules, and, in general, the 
deadline should not exceed 72 hours. 

ule 2.7 Electronic Notices from the Court 

The  clerk  may  send  notices,  orders,  or  other  communications  about  the  case  to  the  party 
electronically. A court seal may be electronic. 

ule 2.8 Official Record 

The  clerk  may  designate  an  electronically  filed  document  or  a  scanned  paper  document  as  the 
official court record. The clerk is not required to keep both paper and electronic versions of the 
same document. However, the clerk must not destroy scanned paper documents and other scanned 
materials until the clerk has determined that the scanned image is an accurate copy of the paper 
documents and materials. 

omment to Rule 2.8: This rule does not authorize or permit the destruction of original trial or 

hearing exhibits. 

ART 3. SERVICE OF DOCUMENTS 

ule 3.1 Electronic Service of Documents 

Every notice required by these rules, and every pleading, plea, motion, or other form of request 
required to be served, except as otherwise expressly provided in these rules, must be served by 
delivering a  copy to  the  party to be served, or the party’s duly  authorized agent  or attorney of 
record.

Documents Filed Electronically. A document filed electronically under these rules must be served 
electronically through the electronic filing manager if the email address of the party or attorney to 
be served is on file with the electronic filing manager. If the email address of the party or attorney 
to be served is not on file with the electronic filing manager, the document must be served on that 
party or attorney as permitted by law. 

ule 3.2 Electronic Service Complete 

Electronic service is complete on transmission of the document to the serving party’s electronic 
filing  service  provider.  The  electronic  filing  manager  will  send  confirmation  of  service  to  the 
serving party. 

ule 3.3 Proof of Service 

The party or attorney of record shall certify to the court compliance with this rule in writing above 
the signature on the filed instrument. A certificate by a party or an attorney of record, or the return 
of the officer, or the affidavit of any other person showing service of a notice shall be prima facie 
evidence of the fact of service. Nothing herein shall preclude any party from offering proof that 
the document, notice, or instrument was not received, and upon so finding, the court may extend 
the time for taking the action required of such party or grant such other relief as it deems just. 

ART 4. PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR FILED DOCUMENTS 

ule 4.1 Sensitive Data Defined 

Sensitive data consists of: 
(1) a driver’s license number, passport number, social security number, tax identification number, 
or similar government-issued personal identification number; 
(2) a bank account number, credit card number, or other financial account number; 
(3) a birth date, home address, or personal phone number; and  
(4) the name of any person who was a minor when the underlying suit was filed unless, under 
Texas Family Code Section 54.02, a juvenile court has waived its exclusive original jurisdiction 
and transferred the individual to a district court. 

ule 4.2 Filing of Documents Containing Sensitive Data Prohibited 

An electronic or paper document containing sensitive data may not be filed with a court unless the 
sensitive data is redacted. Documents containing sensitive data may be filed with a court when the 
data’s inclusion is specifically required by a statute, court rule, or administrative regulation, or 
when the data is exempt from redaction under Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.10. 

ule 4.3 Redaction of Sensitive Data; Retention Requirement 

Sensitive data must be redacted by using the letter “X” in place of each omitted digit or character 
or by removing the sensitive data in a manner indicating that the data has been redacted. The filing 
party must retain an unredacted version of the filed document during the pendency of the case and 
any related appellate proceedings filed within three years of the date the judgment is signed. 

ule 4.4 Notice to Clerk 

If an electronic or paper document must contain sensitive data, the filing party must state on the 
upper left-hand side of the first page, “NOTICE: THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS SENSITIVE 

  R

  R

  P

  R

  R

  R

  R

 

 

DATA.” This notice is not required if the only sensitive data contained in the document is exempt 
from redaction under Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.10. 

ule 4.5 Non-Conforming Documents 

The clerk may not refuse a document that contains sensitive data in violation of these rules or any 
other statute, rule, or court order. But the clerk may identify the error to be corrected and state a 
deadline for the party to resubmit a redacted, substitute document. 

omment to Rule 4.5: The intent of this rule is to establish that a clerk may not refuse a document 
for any perceived violation of these rules. However, the rule permits a clerk the limited authority 
to  identify  information  the  clerk  perceives  to  be  sensitive  data.  When  a  clerk  identifies  such 
information to a filer, it does not constitute an extension of time to file the document. The purpose 
of the deadline is to allow for a non-conforming document to be conformed to these rules. The 
deadline for correction established by the clerk should permit only a reasonable amount of time to 
allow for the filing to be conformed to the requirements of these rules, and, in general, the deadline 
should not exceed 72 hours. 

ule 4.6 Restriction on Remote Access 

Documents that contain sensitive data restricted by these rules or any State or Federal law must 
not be posted on the internet.
