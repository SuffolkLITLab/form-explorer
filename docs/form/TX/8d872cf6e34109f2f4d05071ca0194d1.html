IN THE DISTRICT COURT

TH

219   JUDICIAL DISTRICT

COLLIN COUNTY, TEXAS

ORDER DECLARING JAY SANDON COOPER A VEXATIOUS LITIGANT 
AND ISSUING A PREFILING ORDER AGAINST JAY SANDON COOPER

 ON THIS day a hearing was conducted to determine whether Jay Sandon

Cooper is a Vexatious Litigant, and if so, should be made subject to a Prefiling Order.

The  Court,  after  examining  the  pleadings  and  evidence  and  all  briefs  submitted,

together with authorities, and having considered the arguments of counsel and Jay

Sandon Cooper, is of the opinion and finds that Jay Sandon Cooper is a Vexatious

Litigant and that a Prefiling Order should be issued against him.

The discussion, analysis, comments, and ruling of the Court during the hearings

held June 17, 2015, and June 23, 2015, are incorporated in this ORDER as if fully set

forth herein.  In addition to and supplementation of the oral rulings, the Court finds

the following in support of  ORDER DECLARING JAY SANDON COOPER A VEXATIOUS

LITIGANT AND ISSUING A PREFILING ORDER AGAINST JAY SANDON COOPER:

Jay  Sandon  Cooper,  pro  se,  filed  on  April  24,  2015,  what  he  entitled  his
PETITION FOR  WRIT  OF MANDAMUS;  AND WRIT OF PROHIBITION regarding
Plano  Municipal  Judge  Paul  McNulty,  involving  Plano  Municipal  Court
citation number 140061765;

This case is a “litigation” and  Jay Sandon Cooper is a “plaintiff” for purposes
of the Vexatious Litigant Statute, TEXAS CIVIL PRACTICE & REMEDIES CODE
Chapter 11, et. seq;

AND ISSUING A PRE-FILING ORDER AGAINST JAY SANDON COOPER

th

(3)  On May 8, 2015, the undersigned Judge, sitting for the 219  District Court,
heard the Collin County District Clerk’s contest to JAY COOPER’S RULE 20
AFFIDAVIT.  During such hearing the Court was made aware of information
regarding prior pro se lawsuits by filed by Jay Sandon Cooper and/or Teresa
Ward Cooper, as well as sanctions orders issued by Federal Courts against Jay
Cooper and/or Teresa Cooper. Thus, this Court, pursuant to TEX. CIV. PRAC.
&  REM.  CODE  §11.101(a),  made  its  own  motion  to  conduct  a  hearing  to
determine  whether  Jay  Sandon  Cooper  and  Teresa  Ward  Cooper  meet  the
criteria to be found vexatious litigants, and if so, subject to a Prefiling Order;

rd

(4) On May 14, 2015, this Court entered its NOTICE OF HEARING ON COURT’S
MOTION TO DETERMINE WHETHER JAY SANDON COOPER AND TERESA WARD
COOPER  ARE  VEXATIOUS  LITIGANTS,  ordering  that  a  “hearing  will  be
conducted on the 23  day of June 2015, in the 296  Judicial District Court of
Collin County, Texas, to determine whether Jay Sandon Cooper and Teresa
Ward Cooper meet the criteria to be found vexatious litigants under TEX. CIV.
PRAC. & REM. CODE  §11.101(a), and if so, whether a Prefiling Order should
be issued against them” and further ordering that “the Collin County District
Clerk, by and through her counsel, appear at such hearing and provide the
Court with evidence material to the issue of whether Jay Sandon Cooper and
Teresa Ward Cooper meet the criteria to be found vexatious litigants”; 

th

(5)

Timely and proper written notice of such hearing was provided to Jay Sandon
Cooper  and  he  was  also  orally  ordered  to  appear  by  this  Court  during  the
hearing conducted on June 17, 2015;

(6) On June 17, 2015, the Court conducted a hearing on Cooper’s MOTION TO
VACATE AND ALTERNATIVELY HIS OBJECTIONS TO COURT’S ORDER DATED
MAY 14, 2015.   The Court considered argument from Mr. Cooper and Counsel
for the District Clerk, along with the District Clerk’s RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION
TO RELATOR’S MOTION TO VACATE AND ALTERNATIVELY HIS OBJECTIONS TO
COURT’S  ORDER  DATED  MAY  14,  2015.    The  Court  denied  Mr.  Cooper’s
MOTION  TO  VACATE  AND  ALTERNATIVELY  HIS  OBJECTIONS  TO  COURT’S
ORDER DATED MAY 14, 2015, but did find and order that Teresa Ward Cooper
did not need to appear at the June 23, 2015, hearing and there would be no
determination as to whether she was a vexatious litigant;

(7)  After the conclusion of this hearing, Jay Sandon Cooper was found in contempt
of court for his conduct and was incarcerated in the Collin County jail;

Jay Sandon Cooper, being incarcerated in the Collin County jail, was brought
to the 296  Judicial District Court to fully participate in the hearing conducted
June 23, 2015;

th

The Court took judicial notice of and entered into evidence the documents
attached as Exhibits No. 1-25 to the District Clerk’s EVIDENCE SUPPORTING
CRITERIA TO FIND JAY SANDON COOPER A VEXATIOUS LITIGANT.  The Court
also considered the comments and testimony of Jay Sandon Cooper;

(10) The Court finds there is not a reasonable probability that Jay Sandon Cooper
will prevail in the instant litigation [mandamus] against Judge Paul McNulty. 
Jay  Sandon  Cooper  could  not  and  did  not  prevail  in  the  instant  litigation
against Judge Jay McNulty.  Jay Sandon Cooper failed to pay the applicable
filing fee and this case was dismissed on May 28, 2015, in accordance with the
ORDER  ON  RULE  20  AFFIDAVIT  entered  May  8,  2015 ,  although  the  Court
retained plenary power to determine the issue of whether Jay Sandon Cooper
was a Vexatious Litigant and, if so, subject to a Prefiling Order. Even if Jay
Sandon Cooper had paid the applicable filing fee, the Court finds that he still
could not prevail because the underlying municipal court case for which he
sought mandamus relief herein has become final and the attempted appeal to
County Court at Law No. 6 was denied. See,  State v. Cooper, 006-82958-
2015. The relief requested herein has thus become moot.  The Court also notes
that Jay Sandon Cooper was arrested on June 17, 2015, for his failure to pay
the  judgment  in  the  municipal  court  case  for  which  he  sought  mandamus
relief , again evidencing that the requested relief sought herein was moot;

(11) The NOTICE OF HEARING ON COURT’S MOTION TO DETERMINE WHETHER JAY
SANDON COOPER AND TERESA WARD COOPER ARE VEXATIOUS LITIGANTS
ordering a hearing was entered May 14, 2015, and thus, the operative 7 year
time period for any pro se litigations “commenced, prosecuted, or maintained” 
by Jay Sandon Cooper is found to be a time period  beginning on May 14,
2008;

“If Jay Sandon Cooper does not pay the costs which have been incurred to date within ten
(10) days from the entry of this ORDER, the case will be dismissed for costs without further notice
or order and execution shall issue for the collection thereof.”

A copy of the CAPIAS PRO FINE is attached as Exhibit No. 1 to the District Clerk’s EVIDENCE
SUPPORTING CRITERIA TO FIND JAY SANDON COOPER A VEXATIOUS LITIGANT and has been entered
into evidence in this case.

AND ISSUING A PRE-FILING ORDER AGAINST JAY SANDON COOPER

Page  3

(12) The  Court  finds  that  Jay  Sandon  Cooper  has  commenced,  prosecuted,  or
maintained at least 20 litigations as a pro se litigant [other than in a small
claims  court]  that  have been  finally  determined  adversely to  him  since  the
operative  time  period  of  May  14,  2008.    Attached  as  Exhibit  No.  2  to  the
District  Clerk’s  EVIDENCE  SUPPORTING  CRITERIA  TO  FIND  JAY  SANDON
COOPER  A  VEXATIOUS  LITIGANT is  an  index  of  20  “litigations”  which  Jay
Sandon Cooper has commenced, prosecuted or maintained since May 14, 2008,
and which have been determined adversely to him.  Attached as Exhibits No.
3-22 to the District Clerk’s EVIDENCE SUPPORTING CRITERIA TO FIND JAY
SANDON COOPER A VEXATIOUS LITIGANT are the corresponding docketsheets
and other information for each such litigation, which this Court takes judicial
notice of for all purposes and has entered into evidence in this case; 

rd

(13) The Court finds that Jay Sandon Cooper has permitted litigation to remain
pending at least two years without having been brought to trial or hearing.
Specifically, Jay Cooper v. City of Dallas, et. al, Cause No. DC-06-12858,
193  District Court of Dallas has been dormant since June 5, 2009. Attached
as Exhibit No. 23 to the District Clerk’s EVIDENCE SUPPORTING CRITERIA TO
FIND JAY SANDON COOPER A VEXATIOUS LITIGANT is the docketsheet from
said case, which this Court takes judicial notice of for all purposes and has
entered into evidence in this case;

(14)  The  Court  further  finds  that  Jay  Sandon  Cooper,  after  litigation  has been
finally determined against him, repeatedly relitigates or attempts to relitigate,
pro se, either (1) the validity of the determination against the same defendants
as to whom the litigation was finally determined; (2) or the cause of action,
claim, controversy, or any of the issues of fact or law determined or concluded
by  the  final  determination  against  the  same  defendants  as  to  whom  the
litigation was finally determined;

(15) The Court expressly finds that Sandon Cooper meets the criteria for being
determined to be a Vexatious Litigant under TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE 
§11.054(1)(A) and (B) and §11.054(2);  and

(16) The Court expressly finds that a PreFiling Order,  pursuant to TEX. CIV. PRAC.
&  REM.  CODE    §11.101(a)  and    §11.102(a),  should  be  issued  against  Jay
Sandon Cooper prohibiting him from filing, pro se, any new litigation in a
court  to  which  this  PreFiling  Order  applies  without  first  obtaining  written
permission from the local administrative judge as ordered more fully below.
