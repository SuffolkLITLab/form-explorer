SECTION 2:  ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 

Rule 2.01  Representing or Counseling Parties in 
Disciplinary Matters and Legal Malpractice Cases 

A  cun-ent  member  of  BODA  must  not  represent  a  party  or  testify  voluntarily  in  a 
disciplinary  action  or  proceeding.  Any  BODA  member  who  is  subpoenaed  or  otherwise 
compelled to  appear at  a disciplinary action or proceeding,  including  at  a deposition,  must 
promptly notify the BODA Chair. 

(b) 

A cun-ent BODA member must not serve as an expert witness on the TDRPC. 

A BODA member may represent a party in a legal malpractice case, provided that he or she 
is  later recused  in  accordance  with these  rules  from  any  proceeding  before  BODA  arising 
out of the same facts. 

Rule 2.02 Confidentiality 

BODA  deliberations  are  confidential,  must  not  be  disclosed  by  BODA  members  or  staff, 
and are not subject to disclosure or discovery. 

Classification  appeals,  appeals  from  evidentiary  judgments  of private  reprimand,  appeals 
from  an  evidentiary  judgment  dismissing  a  case,  interlocutory  appeals  or  any  interim 
proceedings  from  an  ongoing  evidentiary  case,  and  disability  cases  are  confidential  under 
the  TRDP.  BODA  must  maintain  all  records  associated  with  these  cases  as  confidential, 
subject to disclosure only as provided in the TRDP and these rules. 

If a  member  of BODA  is  subpoenaed  or  otherwise  compelled  by  law  to  testify  in  any 
proceeding,  the  member  must  not  disclose  a  matter  that  was  discussed  in  conference  in 
connection  with  a  disciplinary  case  unless  the  member  is  required  to  do  so  by  a  court  of 
competent jurisdiction. 

Rule 2.03 Disqualification and Recusal  of BODA Members 

(a) 

BODA members are subject to disqualification and recusal as provided in TRCP 18b. 

BODA members may,  in  addition to  recusals  under (a),  voluntarily recuse  themselves from 
any  discussion  and  voting  for  any  reason.  The  reasons  that  a  BODA  member  is  recused 
from  a case are not subject to discovery. 

These rules do not disqualify a lawyer who is  a member of, or associated with, the  law firm 
of a  BODA  member  from  serving  on  a  grievance  committee  or  representing  a party  in  a 
disciplinary proceeding or legal malpractice case. But a BODA member must recuse him- or 
herself from  any  matter  in  which  a  lawyer  who  is  a  member  of,  or  associated  with,  the 
BODA member's firm is a party or represents a party.

SECTION 3:  CLASSIFICATION APPEALS 

Rule 3.01  Notice of Right to Appeal 

(a) 

(b) 

If a  grievance  filed  by the  Complainant  ooder  TRDP  2.10  is  classified  as  an  inquiry,  the 
CDC  must notify the  Complainant of his or her right to  appeal  as  set out in TRDP 2.10  or 
another applicable rule. 

To facilitate the potential filing of an appeal of a grievance classified as an inquiry, the CDC 
must  send  the  Complainant  an  appeal  notice  form,  approved  by  BODA,  with  the 
classification  disposition.  The  form  must  include  the  docket  number  of the  matter;  the 
deadline  for  appealing;  and  information  for  mailing,  faxing,  or  emailing  the  appeal  notice 
form to BOD A. The appeal notice form must be available in English and Spanish. 

Rule 3.02 Record on Appeal 

BODA  must  only  consider  documents  that  were  filed  with  the  CDC  prior  to  the  classification 
decision.  When  a  notice  of appeal  from  a  classification  decision  has  been  filed,  the  CDC  must 
forward  to  BODA  a  copy  of  the  grievance  and  all  supporting  documentation.  If  the  appeal 
challenges the classification of an amended grievance, the CDC must also send BODA a copy of the 
initial grievance,  unless it has been destroyed.

SECTION 4:  APPEALS FROM EVIDENTIARY PANEL HEARINGS 

Rule 4.01  Perfecting Appeal 

(a) 

Appellate  Timetable.  The  date  that  the  evidentiary  judgment  is  signed  starts  the 
appellate  timetable  under  this  section.  To  make  TRDP  2.21  consistent  with  this 
requirement, the date that the judgment is  signed is the "date of notice" under Rule 2.21. 

(b) 

Notification  of  the  Evidentiary  Judgment.  The  clerk  of the  evidentiary  panel  must 
notify the parties of the judgment as set out in TRDP 2.21. 

( 1) 

(2) 

The  evidentiary panel  clerk  must  notify  the  Commission  and  the  Respondent  in 
wTiting of the judgment. The notice must contain a clear statement that any appeal 
of the  judgment  must  be  filed  with  BODA  within  30  days  of the  date  that  the 
judgment was signed.  The notice must include a copy of the judgment rendered. 

The evidentiary panel clerk must notify the  Complainant that a judgment has been 
rendered  and  provide  a  copy  of  the  judgment,  unless  the  evidentiary  panel 
dismissed  the  case  or imposed  a private  reprimand.  In  the  case  of a dismissal  or 
private reprimand,  the  evidentiary panel clerk must notify the  Complainant of the 
decision and that the contents of the judgment are confidential. Under TRDP 2.16, 
no  additional  information  regarding  the  contents  of a  judgment  of dismissal  or 
private reprimand may be disclosed to the Complainant. 

Filing Notice  of Appeal.  An  appeal  is  perfected when a written notice  of appeal  is  filed 
with BODA. If a notice of appeal and any other accompanying documents are mistakenly 
filed  with the  evidentiary panel  clerk,  the  notice  is  deemed  to  have  been  filed  the  same 
day with BODA, and the evidentiary panel clerk must immediately send the BODA Clerk 
a copy of the notice and any accompanying documents. 

Time to  File.  In accordance with TRDP 2.24, the notice of appeal must be  filed within 30 
days after the date the judgment is signed.  In the event a motion for  new trial or motion to 
modify the judgment is  timely  filed  with the evidentiary  panel, the notice of appeal  must 
be filed  with BODA within 90 days from  the date the judgment is signed. 

Extension  of Time.  A motion  for  an  extension of time  to  file  the  notice of appeal  must be 
filed  no  later  than  15  days  after  the  last  day  allowed  for  filing  the  notice  of appeal.  The 
motion must comply with Rule  1.09.

(a) 

Inaccuracies  or  Defects.  If the  clerk's  record  is  found  to  be  defective  or  inaccurate,  the 
BODA Clerk must infom1 the clerk ofthe evidentiary panel of the defect or inaccuracy and 
instruct the  clerk to  make  the  correction.  Any  inaccuracies  in  the  reporter's record  may  be

private reprimand. 

Rule 4.03 Time to File Record

filed  with the  evidentiary  panel,  the  clerk's  record  and  the  reporter's  record  must be  filed 
within 120 days from the date the original judgment is signed, unless a modified judgment is 
signed,  in  which  case  the  clerk's  record  and  the  reporter's  record  must  be  filed  within  60 
days  of the  signing of the modified judgment.  Failure to  file  either the  clerk's record or the 
reporter's  record  on time  does  not affect  BODA's jurisdiction,  but  may result  in  BODA's 
exercising its discretion to dismiss the appeal, affinn the judgment appealed from,  disregard 
materials filed late, or apply presumptions against the appellant. 

(b) 

If No Record Filed. 

(1) 

(2) 

If the clerk's record or repmier's record has not been timely filed,  the  BODA Clerk 
must send notice to the  party  responsible  for  filing  it,  stating that the  record  is  late 
and requesting that the record be filed within 30 days. The BODA Clerk must send a 
copy of this notice to all the parties and the clerk of the evidentiary panel. 

If no  repmier's record  is  filed  due to  appellant's fault,  and  if the  clerk's record  has 
been  filed,  BODA  may,  after  first  giving  the  appellant  notice  and  a  reasonable 
opportunity to  cure,  consider and decide those  issues  or points that do  not require a 
reporter's record for  a decision.  BODA may do this  if no  reporter's record has  been 
filed because: 

(i) 

the appellant failed to request a reporter's record; or 

(ii) 

the appellant failed to  pay or make anangements to  pay the reporter's fee  to 
prepare  the  reporter's  record,  and  the  appellant  is  not  entitled  to  proceed 
without payment of costs. 

(c) 

Extension of Time to  File the Reporter's Record.  When an extension oftime is requested 
for  filing  the  reporter's  record,  the  facts  relied  on  to  reasonably  explain  the  need  for  an 
extension must be supported by an affidavit of the court reporter.  The affidavit must include 

Page  14 

the court reporter's estimate of the earliest date when the reporter's record will be  available 
for filing. 

(d) 

Supplemental  Record.  If anything  material  to  either  party  is  omitted  from  the  clerk's 
record or reporter's record,  BODA may,  on written motion of a party or on its  O'-"TI motion, 
direct  a supplemental record to  be  certified and transmitted  by the  clerk for the evidentiary 
panel or the court reporter for the evidentiary panel. 

Rule 4.04 Copies of the Record

supplement briefs. 

Failure of the Appellant to  File a Brief.  If the appellant fails  to  timely file  a brief, BODA 
may: 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

dismiss  the  appeal  for  want  of  prosecution,  unless  the  appellant  reasonably 
explains the failure,  and the appellee is not significantly injured by the appellant's 
failure to timely file  a brief; 

decline  to  dismiss  the  appeal  and  make  further  orders  within  its  discretion  as  it 
considers proper; or 

if an appellee's brief is  filed,  regard that brief as  coiTectly presenting the case and 
affirm  the  evidentiary  panel's  judgment  on  that  brief  without  examining  the 
record. 

Rule 4.06 Oral Argument 

Request.  A  party  desiring  oral  argument must note  the  request  on the  front  of the  party's 
brief.  A party's failure to timely request oral  argument waives the party's right to  argue.  A 
party who has requested argument may later withdraw the request.  But even if a party has 
waived oral argument,  BODA may direct the party to  appear and argue.  If oral argument is 
granted, the clerk will notify the parties of the time and place for submission. 

Right to  Oral Argument.  A  party who has filed  a brief and who has timely requested oral 
argument  may argue  the  case  to  BODA unless  BODA,  after  examining the  briefs,  decides 
that oral argument is unnecessary for any of the following reasons: 

Page  16 

(1) 

the appeal is frivolous; 

(2) 

the dispositive issue or issues have been authoritatively decided; 

(3) 

the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the briefs and record; or 

(4) 

the decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral argument. 

(c) 

Time Allowed.  Each party  will have 20 minutes to argue.  BODA may,  on the request of a 
party or on its own, extend or shorten the time allowed for oral argument. The appellant may 
reserve a portion of his or her allotted time for rebuttal. 

Rule 4.07 Decision and Judgment 

(a) 

Decision. BODA may do any ofthe following: 

(1) 

affirm in whole or in part the decision of the evidentiary panel; 

(2) 

modifY the panel's findings and affirm the findings as modified; 

(3) 

( 4) 

reverse in whole or in pmi the panel's findings and render the decision that the panel 
should have rendered; or 

reverse  the  panel's  findings  and  remand  the  cause  for  further  proceedings  to  be 
conducted by: 

(i) 

the panel that entered the findings;  or 

(ii) 

a  statewide  grievance  committee  panel  appointed by BODA  and  composed 
of members  selected  from  the state  bar districts  other than the district from 
which the appeal was taken. 

(b)  Mandate.  In  every  appeal,  the  BODA  Clerk  must  issue  a  mandate  in  accordance  with 

BODA' s judgment and send it to the evidentiary panel and to all the parties. 

Rule 4.08 Appointment of Statewide Grievance Committee 

If BODA  remands  a  cause  for  further  proceedings  before  a  statewide  grievance  committee,  the 
BODA Chair will appoint the  statewide grievance committee in accordance with TRDP 2.27.  The 
committee must consist of six members: four attorney members and two public members randomly 
selected from  the current pool of grievance committee members.  Two alternates,  consisting of one 
attorney  and  one public  member,  must also  be  selected.  BODA will  appoint the  initial  chair  who 
will serve until the members of the statewide grievance committee elect a chair of the committee at 
the  first  meeting.  The BODA Clerk will  notify the  Respondent  and the  CDC that a  committee has 
been appointed. 

Page  17 

Rule 4.09 Involuntary Dismissal 

Under the following circumstances and on any party's motion or on its ovvn  initiative after giving at 
least ten days'  notice to  all parties, BODA may dismiss the appeal or affirm the appealed judgment 
or order. Dismissal or affirmance may occur if the appeal is  subject to dismissal: 

(a) 

for want of jurisdiction; 

(b) 

for want of prosecution; or 

(c) 

because the appellant has failed  to  comply with a requirement of these rules,  a court order, 
or a notice from the clerk requiring a response or other action within a specified time.

SECTION 5:  PETITIONS TO REVOKE PROBATION 

Rule 5.01  Initiation and  Service 

(a) 

(b) 

Before filing  a motion to revoke the probation of an  attorney who has  been sanctioned, the 
CDC must contact the BODA Clerk to confirm whether the next regularly available hearing 
date  will  comply with the  30-day requirement  of TRDP.  The Chair may  designate a three 
member panel  to  hear the  motion,  if necessary,  to  meet  the  30-day  requirement  of TRDP 
2.23. 

Upon  filing  the  motion,  the  CDC  must  serve  the  Respondent  with  the  motion  and  any 
supporting documents in accordance with TRDP 2.23, the TRCP, and these rules.  The CDC 
must notify BODA of the date that service is obtained on the Respondent. 

Rule 5.02 Hearing 

Within  30  days  of service  of the  motion  on  the  Respondent,  BODA  must  docket  and  set  the 
matter for  a hearing and notify the parties of the time and place of the hearing.  On a showing of 
good  cause  by  a party  or on its  own motion,  BODA  may  continue  the  case  to  a future  hearing 
date as circumstances require. 

Page  19 

SECTION 6:  COMPULSORY DISCIPLINE 

Rule 6.01  Initiation of Proceeding 

Under TRDP  8.03,  the  CDC  must file  a petition for  compulsory discipline with BODA and  serve 
the Respondent in accordance with the TRDP and Rule  1.06 of these rules. 

Rule 6.02 Interlocutory Suspension 

(a) 

Interlocutory Suspension. In  any compulsory proceeding under TRDP  Part VIII  in  which 
BODA determines that the  Respondent has been convicted of an Intentional Crime and that 
the criminal conviction is on direct appeal, BODA may suspend the Respondent's license to 
practice law by interlocutory order. In any compulsory case in which BODA has imposed an 
interlocutory order of suspension,  BODA retains jurisdiction to  render final judgment after 
the direct appeal of the criminal conviction is final.  For purposes of rendering final judgment 
in a compulsory discipline case, the direct appeal of the criminal conviction is final when the 
appellate court issues its mandate. 

(b) 

Criminal Conviction Affirmed. If the criminal conviction made the basis of a compulsory 
interlocutory suspension is  affirmed and becomes final, the CDC must file  a motion for  final 
judgment that complies with TRDP 8.05. 

(1) 

If the criminal  sentence is  fully  probated or is  an order of deferred adjudication,  the 
motion for final judgment must contain notice of a hearing date.  The motion will  be 
set on BODA's next available hearing date. 

(2) 

If the criminal sentence is not fully probated: 

(i) 

(ii) 

BODA may proceed to  decide  the  motion without a hearing if the attorney 
does not file a verified denial within ten days of service of the motion; or 

BODA may set the motion for a hearing on the next available hearing date if 
the attorney timely files  a verified denial. 

(c) 

Criminal  Conviction  Reversed.  If  an  appellate  court  issues  a  mandate  reversing  the 
criminal  conviction  while  a  Respondent  is  subject  to  an  interlocutory  suspension,  the 
Respondent  may  file  a  motion  to  terminate  the  interlocutory  suspension.  The  motion  to 
tenninate  the  interlocutory  suspension  must  have  certified  copies  of the  decision  and 
mandate  of the  reversing  court  attached.  If the  CDC  does  not  file  an  opposition  to  the 
termination within ten days of being served with the motion, BODA may proceed to  decide 
the motion without a hearing or set the  matter for  a hearing on its  own motion.  If the  CDC 
timely  opposes the  motion,  BODA must  set the  motion  for  a hearing  on its  next  available 
hearing  date.  An  order  terminating  an  interlocutory  order  of  suspension  does  not 
automatically reinstate a Respondent's license. 

Page 20 

SECTION 7:  RECIPROCAL DISCIPLINE 

Rule 7.01  Initiation of Proceeding 

The  Commission for  Lawyer Discipline may initiate  an action  for  reciprocal  discipline  by filing  a 
petition  with  BODA  under  TRDP  Part  IX  and  these  rules.  The  petition  must  request  that  the 
Respondent  be  disciplined  in  Texas  and  have  attached  to  it  any  information  concerning  the 
disciplinary  matter from  the  other jurisdiction,  including  a certified copy of the  order or judgment 
rendered against the Respondent. 

Rule 7.02 Order to Show Cause 

When a petition is  filed,  the  Chair immediately issues a show cause order and a hearing notice and 
forwards them to the CDC, who must serve the order and notice on the Respondent. The CDC must 
notifY BODA of the date that service is obtained. 

Rule 7.03 Attorney's Response 

If the  Respondent  does  not  file  an  answer  within  30  days  of being  served  with  the  order  and 
notice  but thereafter  appears  at  the  hearing,  BODA  may,  at the  discretion  of the  Chair,  receive 
testimony from the Respondent relating to the merits of the petition.

SECTION 8:  DISTRICT DISABILITY COMMITTEE HEARINGS 

Rule 8.01  Appointment of District Disability Committee 

If the  evidentiary  panel  of the  grievance  committee  finds  under  TRDP  2.17(P)(2),  or  the 
CDC  reasonably  believes  under  TRDP  2.14(C),  that  a  Respondent  is  suffering  from  a 
disability,  the  rules  in this  section will  apply to  the  de  novo  proceeding before the District 
Disability Committee held under TRDP Part XII. 

Upon  receiving  an  evidentiary  panel's  finding  or  the  CDC's  referral  that  an  attorney  is 
believed  to  be  suffering  from  a  disability,  the  BODA  Chair  must  appoint  a  District 
Disability  Committee  in compliance  with  TRDP  12.02  and  designate  a  chair.  BODA  will 
reimburse  District  Disability  Committee members  for  reasonable  expenses  directly  related 
to  service on the District Disability Committee. The BODA Clerk must notifY the  CDC and 
the  Respondent  that  a  committee  has  been  appointed  and  notify  the  Respondent  where  to 
locate the procedural rules governing disability proceedings. 

A  Respondent who  has  been notified that  a disability referral  will  be  or has  been made  to 
BODA  may,  at  any  time,  waive  in  writing  the  appointment  of the  District  Disability 
Committee or the  hearing before the District Disability Committee and enter into  an agreed 
judgment of indefinite  disability  suspension,  provided that the  Respondent  is  competent to 
waive the hearing. If the Respondent is not represented, the waiver must include a statement 
affirming that the Respondent has been advised of the right to appointed counsel and waives 
that right as well. 

All  pleadings,  motions,  briefs,  or  other  matters  to  be  filed  with  the  District  Disability 
Conunittee must be filed with the BODA Clerk. 

Should  any  member  of the  District  Disability  Committee  become  unable  to  serve.  the 
BODA Chair may appoint a substitute member. 

Rule 8.02 Petition and Answer 

Petition.  Upon being notified that the District Disability Committee has  been appointed by 
BODA,  the  CDC  must,  within  20  days,  file  with  the  BODA  Clerk  and  serve  on  the
