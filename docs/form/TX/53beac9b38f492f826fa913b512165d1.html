Texas Judiciary Legislative Update86th LegislatureTexas Judicial CouncilFrom the Executive Director 

The 86th Texas Legislature passed numerous laws that will bring profound change to the Texas Judiciary. From 
statutory revisions that will allow courts to improve their response to natural disasters to overhauling judicial 
compensation and increasing accountability in our guardianship system, the changes will have a lasting effect. 

In all, more than 1800 bills were filed that impacted the third branch, and the Office of Court Administration 
also analyzed and drafted 1252 fiscal notes for the Legislative Budget Board. The Texas Judicial Council, the 
policy making body for the Judiciary, found success in multiple policy areas including new laws that will:

 Clarify outpatient mental health commitment standards and processes;

 Increase oversight and support to drug courts and other specialty courts;

  Expand jurisdiction of Children’s Courts to oversee cases of youth involved in both the Juvenile Justice 
and CPS systems;

 Increase the civil jurisdiction of Justice and Constitutional County Courts to $20,000;

 Provide a pathway for the judiciary to begin collecting case level data;

 Expand the review of guardianship cases statewide;

 Provide increased flexibility for courts to respond to natural disasters;

 Protect judges’ address and other identifying information to increase court security; and 

 Award judicial longevity with a new tiered compensation system. 

The  following  report  briefly  summarizes  new  legislation  directly  impacting  the  Texas  court  system,  judges, 
clerks, lawyers and other judicial actors and personnel. No attempt is made to cover substantive areas of the 
law in detail. We hope the report will be a useful resource for the judicial and legal community and all those 
interested in the administration of justice.

Texas Judicial Council.
The Texas Judicial Council (TJC) was created in 1929 by the 41st Legislature to continuously study and report on 
the organization and practices of the Texas Judicial Branch. TJC is the policy-making body for the state judiciary.

The Council studies methods to simplify judicial procedures, expedite court business, and better administer 
justice. It examines the work accomplished by the courts and submits recommendations for improvement of 
the system to the Legislature, the Governor and the Supreme Court. The Council receives and considers input 
from judges, public officials, members of the bar, and citizens.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
