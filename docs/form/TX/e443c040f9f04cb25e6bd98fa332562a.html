      <pre>Before the Presiding Judges of the Administrative Judicial Regions 

   

Per Curiam Rule 12 Decision 
 

APPEAL NO.: 

16-016 

ESPONDENT: 

Bexar  County  Community  Supervision  and  Corrections 
Department   

ATE: 

 

November 29, 2016 

PECIAL COMMITTEE: 

Judge  Stephen  B.  Ables,  Chairman;  Judge  Olen  Underwood; 
Judge Billy Ray Stubblefield; Judge Missy Medary; Judge Dean 
Rucker  

 

 

 

Petitioner made three separate requests for information to Respondent.  Respondent provided 
the requested information except for 15 case files, copies of audits and practice audits of caseload 
carrying probation officers, and redacted portions of certain responsive emails. Petitioner then filed 
this appeal.   

irst, we address the requested case files.  Petitioner requested the case files of all of the 
cases  that  were  listed  in  a  notice  of  proposed  adverse  action  that  was  sent  to  Petitioner  by 
Respondent.  The requested case files are created and maintained by Respondent’s employees for 
individual probationers. A prior special committee has determined that “records of the names and 
addresses of probationers are records created, produced, or filed in connection with criminal cases 
that  have  been  before  the  court  which  placed  the  probationer  under  Article  42.12  community 
supervision.”  See Rule 12 Decision No. 00-003. We are of the opinion that all of the records related 
to a probationer in a case file maintained by a probation officer who supervises probationers are 
records that are created, produced or filed in connection with criminal cases that have been before the 
court which placed the probationer under community supervision.  Therefore, these records are not 
judicial records that are subject to Rule 12 and we are without authority to grant the petition nor 
sustain the denial of access to these records. 

he second set of records at issue in this appeal are the audits and any practice audits of the 
caseload carrying probationers.  Respondent withheld the requested audit information claiming it is 
confidential  under  Tex.  Gov’t  Code  Sec.  76.006(g)  and  must  be  withheld  under  Rule  12.5(i), 
Information Confidential Under Other Law. Section 76.006(g) provides that “a document evaluating 
the performance of an officer of the department who supervises defendants placed on community 
supervision  is  confidential.”  Respondent  asserts  that  these  audits  are  used  as  evaluations  and 
appraisals of employee’s case management and supervisory duties.  We agree that these records are 
documents that evaluate the performance of a community supervision officer.  Accordingly, for 
purposes of responding to Rule 12 requests, these records are confidential under Sec. 76.006(g) and 
should be withheld under Rule 12.5(i).

The last set of records at issue in this appeal are emails of a few of Respondent’s employees 
“regarding  the  Bexar  County  Probation  Officers  Association  or  any  predecessor  employee 
organization  or  union,  or  regarding  political  activities  of  BPOA  or  any  predecessor  employee 
organization, or regarding political activities of the San Antonio AFL-CIO, within the past three 
years.”  Respondent states that it provided all responsive emails but redacted certain email addresses 
and portions of the emails that are exempt under Rule 12.5(c), Personnel Information, 12.5(d), Home 
Address and Family Information, 12.5(f), Internal Deliberations on Court or Judicial Administration 
Matters, and 12.5(k), Investigations of Character or Conduct. Petitioner asks this special committee 
to  conduct  an  in  camera  review  of  several  of  the  redacted  emails  to  determine  if  the  withheld 
information is in fact exempt from disclosure.  Petitioner states that it does not take issue with the 
other redacted emails because it is clear that the information being withheld consists of private email 
addresses.  

We have reviewed the emails and conclude that the redacted portions of the emails contain 
personal  email  addresses,  which  Petitioner  has  stated  he  does  not  take  issue  with,  and  contain 
information related to an investigation of a person’s character or conduct and personnel information 
and are exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5(c) and (k).  Two of the redactions are not exempt 
from disclosure and have been noted and provided to Respondent so that they may be released to 
Petitioner.  

Lastly, Petitioner notes that Respondent is erroneously withholding some of the requested 
information  based  on  their conclusion that the requested information  is not subject  to  Rule 12.  
Petitioner asks this special committee to affirm that it does not sustain Respondent’s denial of access 
to records on the basis that a record is not subject to Rule 12.  As has been stated in many previous 
Rule 12 decisions, the fact that a special committee concludes that requested records are not “judicial 
records” within the meaning of Rule 12 does not mean that they are exempt from disclosure.  The 
records may be open pursuant to other law such as the common-law right to public access.  See Rule 
12 Decisions 00-001 and 00-003. The primary significance of a Rule 12 decision finding that a 
record  is  not  subject  to  Rule  12  is  that  the  Rule  12  procedures  for  responding  to  requests  and 
appealing the denial of requests do not apply.  Neither the fact that a record is not subject to Rule 12 
nor a decision making this determination should be used as a basis for withholding records.  

In summary, we conclude that the requested case file records are not subject to Rule 12 and 
therefore, regarding those records, we are without authority to grant the petition or sustain the denial 
of access to them.  We also conclude that the audit and practice audit information is confidential 
under Tex. Gov’t Code Sec. 76.006(g) and is therefore exempt from disclosure under Rule 12.5(i).  
Lastly,  we  conclude  that  the  information  redacted  from  the emails that has  been challenged by 
Petitioner is exempt from disclosure except for the two items that we have noted and provided to 
Respondent for release.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
