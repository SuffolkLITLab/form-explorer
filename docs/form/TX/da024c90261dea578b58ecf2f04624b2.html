TEXAS RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE 
Updated with Amendments Effective February 1, 2023 

On  a  party's  motion  or  on  its  own  initiative  an 
appellate  court  may  —  to  expedite  a  decision  or  for 
other  good  cause  —  suspend  a  rule's  operation  in  a 
particular case and order a different procedure; but a 
court  must  not  construe  this  rule  to  suspend  any 
provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure or to alter 
the time for perfecting an appeal in a civil case. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: Former subdivision (a) 
regarding appellate court jurisdiction is deleted.  The 
power  to  suspend  rules  is  extended  to  civil  cases.  
Other nonsubstantive changes are made.

.1. Scope  

These rules govern procedure in appellate courts

promulgate  rules  and  forms  governing  its 
practice that are not inconsistent with state or 
federal law or rules adopted by the Supreme 
Court or the Court of Criminal Appeals. To 
be  effective,  local  rules  and  forms  must  be 
published  on 
the  Office  of  Court 
Administration’s website.  

b)  Party’s  Noncompliance.  A  court  must  not

Notes and Comments  

Comment  to  1997  change:  Subdivision  1.1  is 
simplified  without  substantive  change.  Subdivision 
1.2 is amended to make clear that any person is entitled 
to  a  copy  of  local  rules.  Paragraph  1.2(c), restricting 
dismissal  of  a  case  for  noncompliance  with  a  local 
rule, is added.  

 

Comment to 2023 change: Rule 1.2 is amended to 
remove  the  requirement  that  the  Supreme  Court  of 
Texas  and  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  approve  local 
rules  and  to  expressly  address  local  forms.  The 
amended rule provides that local rules and forms must 
not conflict with other laws or rules and that they are 
not effective unless published on the Office of Court 
Administration’s website.

(1)  In  general.  If  a  party  affected  by  a 
judgment or other appealable order 
has not — within 20 days after the 
judgment  or  order  was  signed  — 
either  received  the  notice  required 
by  Texas  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure 
actual

knowledge  of  the  signing,  then  a 
period  that,  under  these  rules,  runs 
from the signing will begin for that 
party on the earlier of the date when 
the party receives notice or acquires 
actual  knowledge  of  the  signing. 
But  in  no  event  may  the  period 
begin  more  than  90  days  after  the 
judgment or order was signed. 
 

(2)  Exception  for  restricted  appeal. 
Subparagraph  (1)  does  not  extend 
the  time  for  perfecting  a  restricted 
appeal. 

(b)  Procedure  to  Gain  Additional  Time.  The 
procedure to gain additional time is governed 
by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 306a.5. 

c)  The Court’s Order. After hearing the motion, 
the trial court must sign a written order that 
finds  the  date when  the party  or  the  party’s 
attorney  first  either  received  notice  or 
acquired actual knowledge that the judgment 
or order was signed. 

.3. Periods  Affected  by  Modified  Judgment  in 

Civil Case 

(a)  During Plenary-Power Period. If a judgment 
is modified in any respect while the trial court 
retains  plenary  power,  a  period  that,  under 
these  rules,  runs  from  the  date  when  the 
judgment  is  signed  will  run  from  the  date 
when the modified judgment is signed. 

b)  After Plenary Power Expires. If the trial court 
corrects or reforms the judgment under Texas 
Rule of Civil Procedure 316 after expiration 
of the trial court’s plenary power, all periods 
provided in these rules that run from the date 
the judgment is signed run from the date the 
corrected judgment is signed for complaints 
that would not apply to the original judgment.

.2. Uniform Terminology in Criminal Cases 

In documents filed in criminal appeals, the parties 
are  the  State  and  the  appellant.  But  if  the  State  has 
appealed under Article 44.01 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure,  the  defendant  is  the  appellee.  Otherwise, 
papers  should  use  real  names  for  parties,  and  such 
labels as appellee, petitioner, respondent, and movant 
should  be  avoided  unless  necessary  for  clarity.  In 
habeas corpus proceedings, the person for whose relief 
the writ is requested is the applicant; Code of Criminal 
Procedure article 11.13. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: The definition of court 
below and the reference to “suing out a writ of error to 
the court of appeals,” are deleted as those terms are no 
longer used in these rules. Other changes are made. 
 

Rule 4. Time and Notice Provisions 

.1. Computing Time 

(a)  In  General.  The  day  of  an  act,  event,  or 
default  after  which  a  designated  period 
begins to run is not included when computing 
a period prescribed or allowed by these rules, 
by court order, or by statute. The last day of 
the  period  is  included,  but  if  that  day  is  a 
Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period 
extends to the end of the next day that is not 
a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. 

b)  Clerk's Office Closed or Inaccessible. If the 
act to be done is filing a document, and if the 
clerk's  office  where  the  document  is  to  be 
filed is closed or inaccessible during regular 
hours on the last day for filing the document, 
the period for filing the document extends to 
the end of the next day when the clerk's office 
is  open  and  accessible.  The  closing  or 
inaccessibility  of  the  clerk's  office  may  be 
proved by a certificate of the clerk or counsel, 
by a party's affidavit, or by other satisfactory 
proof, and may be controverted in the same 
manner.

.6. No Notice of Trial Court’s Appealable Order 

on a Motion for Forensic DNA Testing  

a)   Additional  Time  to  File  Notice  of  Appeal.  If 
neither  an  adversely  affected  defendant  nor  the 
defendant’s  attorney received  notice or  acquired 
actual  knowledge  that  the  trial  judge  signed  an 
order  appealable  under  Code  of  Criminal 
Procedure Chapter 64 within twenty days after the 
signing,  then  the  time  periods  under  these  rules 
that  ordinarily  run  from  the  signing  of  an 
appealable order will begin to run on the earliest 
date  when  the  defendant  or  the  defendant’s 
attorney  received  notice  or  acquired  actual 
knowledge  of  the  signing.  But  in  no  event  shall 
such periods begin more than 120 days after the 
day the trial judge signed the appealable order. 

b)   Motion to Gain Additional Time.

notice or acquired actual knowledge that 
the  trial  judge  signed  the  appealable 
order; and  

D) Be filed within 120 days of the signing of 

the appealable order. 

(2)  To establish the application of paragraph (a) 
of this rule, the defendant adversely affected 
must prove in the trial court: 

 

(A) The earliest date on which the defendant 
or  the  defendant’s  attorney  received 
notice or acquired actual knowledge that 
the  trial  judge  signed  the  appealable

judgment was signed, a period that, under these rules, 
runs from the date when the judgment is signed will be 
computed as if the judgment were signed on the date 
when the motion for new trial was filed.

Comment to 2018 change:  Rule 4.6 is intended to 
 
provide  redress  for  criminal  defendants  who  are 
entitled to appeal trial court rulings made pursuant to 
Texas  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Chapter  64,  but 
receive late or no notice of the rulings. The rule allows 
a defendant additional time to file a notice of appeal 
when  neither  the  defendant  nor  the  defendant’s 
attorney received notice or acquired actual knowledge 
of the signing of the appealable order within the first 
20  days  after  the  signing.  The  rule  is  based  on  the 
framework  of  Rule  of  Appellate  Procedure  4.2  and 
Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 306a, but is intended to 
apply only in the limited context of appealable rulings 
on Chapter 64 motions. The term “sworn” in Rule 4.6 
includes the use of an unsworn declaration made under 
penalty of perjury. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE 
§ 132.001. If a trial judge grants a defendant’s motion 
for  additional time  filed  under  this  rule,  the  court  of 
appeals may treat the defendant’s late-filed notice of 
appeal as timely or treat the motion for additional time 
itself  as  a  notice  of  appeal  for  the  purpose  of 
determining compliance with Rules 25.2 and 26.2. 

Rule 5. Fees in Civil Cases 

A  party  who  is  not  excused  by  statute  or  these 
rules from paying costs must pay — at the time an item 
is presented for filing — whatever fees are required by 
statute or Supreme Court order.  The appellate court 
may enforce this rule by any order that is just. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: This is former Rule 13.  
The rule is simplified.  The fees an appellate court may 
charge in a civil case are now specified by Supreme 
Court order. 

 
Rule 6. Representation by Counsel 

.1. Lead Counsel 

   

 

  6

 

(a)  For  Appellant.  Unless  another  attorney  is 
designated,  lead  counsel  for  an  appellant  is 
the attorney whose signature first appears on 
the notice of appeal. 

b)  For  a  Party  Other  Than  Appellant.  Unless 
another  attorney  is  designated,  lead  counsel 
for  a  party  other  than  an  appellant  is  the 
attorney whose signature first appears on the 
first document filed in the appellate court on 
that party's behalf. 

c)  How to Designate. The original or a new lead 
counsel may be designated by filing a notice 

  (

  (

(B) That this date was more than twenty days 
after the signing of the appealable order. 

 

(3)  If the defendant’s motion for additional time 
meets the requirements set out in paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (b)(2), the motion may serve as the 
defendant’s notice of appeal.  

c)   The Court’s Order. After hearing the motion for 
additional time, the trial judge must sign a written 
order  that  determines  the  earliest  date  when  the 
defendant  or  the  defendant’s  attorney  received 
notice or acquired actual knowledge that the trial 
judge  signed  the  appealable  order  and  whether 
this  date  was  more  than  twenty  days  after  the 
judge signed the appealable order.  

d)   The  Clerk’s  Duties.  The  trial  court  clerk  must 
immediately  (as  they  are  filed  or  entered  in  the 
record) forward to all parties in the case copies of 
the  defendant’s  motion  for  additional  time,  the 
trial  judge’s  written  order  under  subsection  (c), 
the  order  the  defendant  seeks  to  appeal,  any 
State’s  response,  and  any  exhibits  and  related 
documents. 

 
Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: This is former Rule 5. 
Paragraph 4.1(b) is added.  Former paragraph (b)(1) is 
omitted  because  it  is  covered  by  other  provisions  of 
the rules. Former paragraphs  (b)(2)  and  (b)(3)  are  
omitted  because  they  are duplicative of provisions in 
the  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  which  prescribes  the  
applicable procedure. The phrase “modified, corrected 
or  reformed  in  any  respect”  in  paragraph  4.3(a)  is 
changed to “modified in any respect,” but no change 
in  substance  is  intended.  Former  subdivision  (e) 
regarding notice of judgment by the court of appeals is 
moved  to  Rule  12.6.  Subdivision  4.5  is  revised  and 
now makes clear that the court must grant the motion 
for additional time if the court finds that the party did 
not receive the notice or acquire actual knowledge in 
time.  Other changes are made throughout the rule. 
 

Comment  to  2002  change:  Subdivision  4.5  is 
amended to clarify that a party may obtain additional 
time to file documents when the party fails to receive 
notice not only of an appellate court judgment, but of 
an appellate court order - such as one denying a motion 
for rehearing - that triggers the appeal period. 
 

Comment  to  2007  change:  Subdivision  4.5  is 
changed, consistent with other changes in the rules, to 
specifically  address  a  motion 
for  en  banc 
reconsideration and treat it as a motion for rehearing.

(2)  state  that  the  court  and  other  counsel 
should  communicate  directly  with  the 
party in the future; 

3)  give  the  party's  name  and  last  known 
address and telephone number; and 

4)  be signed by the party. 

(b)  Appointed  Counsel.  In  a  criminal  case,  an 
attorney  appointed  by  the  trial  court  to 
represent  an  indigent  party  cannot  file  a 
nonrepresentation notice. 

An appellate court may, on appropriate terms and 
conditions,  permit  an  attorney  to  withdraw  from 
representing a party in the appellate court. 
 

(a)  Contents  of  Motion.  A  motion  for  leave  to 

withdraw must contain the following: 

1)  a list of current deadlines and settings in 

the case; 

2)  the party's name and last known address 

and telephone number; 

.5. Withdrawal 

  6

 

delivered to the party; and 

4)  a statement that the party was notified in 
writing  of  the  right  to  object  to  the 
motion. 

(b)  Delivery  to  Party.  The  motion  must  be 
delivered to the party in person or mailed — 
both by certified and by first-class mail — to 
the party at the party's last known address. 
 

(c)  If  Motion  Granted.  If  the  court  grants  the 
motion, 
the  withdrawing  attorney  must 
immediately  notify  the  party,  in  writing,  of 
any  deadlines  or  settings  that  the  attorney 
knows  about  at  the  time  of  withdrawal  but 
that  were  not  previously  disclosed  to  the 
party. The withdrawing attorney must file a 
copy of that notice with the court clerk. 

d)  Exception  for  Substitution  of  Counsel.  If  an 
attorney  substitutes 
for  a  withdrawing 
attorney,  the  motion  to  withdraw  need  not 
comply  with  (a)  but  must  state  only  the 
substitute  attorney’s  name,  mailing  address, 
telephone  number,  fax  number,  if  any,  and

stating that attorney's name, mailing address, 
telephone number, fax number, if any, email 
address, and State Bar of Texas identification 
number.    If  a  new  lead  counsel  is  being 
designated, both the new attorney and either 
the party or the former lead counsel must sign 
the notice. 

.2. Appearance of Other Attorneys 

An  attorney  other  than  lead  counsel  may  file  a 
notice stating that the attorney represents a specified 
party  to  the  proceeding  and  giving  that  attorney's 
telephone  number,  fax 
name,  mailing  address, 
number, if any, email address, and State Bar of Texas 
identification  number.  The  clerk  will  note  on  the 
docket  the  attorney's  appearance.  When  a  brief  or 
motion is filed, the clerk will note on the docket the 
name  of  each  attorney,  if  not  already  noted,  who 
appears on the document. 

.3. To Whom Communications Sent 

Any  notice,  copies  of  documents  filed  in  an 
appellate court, or other communications must be sent 
to: 
 

(a)  each party’s lead counsel on appeal; 

  (

1)  that party was represented by counsel in 

the trial court; 

2)  lead counsel on appeal has not yet been 

designated for that party; and 

 

(3)  lead  counsel  in  the  trial  court  has  not 
filed a nonrepresentation notice or been 
allowed to withdraw; 

(c)  a  party  if  the  party  is  not  represented  by 

counsel. 

.4. Nonrepresentation Notice 

(a)  In General. If, in accordance with paragraph 
6.3(b),  the  lead  counsel  in  the  trial  court  is 
being  sent  notices,  copies  of  documents,  or 
other communications, that attorney may file 
a  nonrepresentation  notice  in  the  appellate 
court. The notice must: 

1)  state that the attorney is not representing 

the party on appeal; 

  (

  (

 

  (

 

b)  a party’s lead counsel in the trial court if:

Proceedings 
appropriate. 
substitution  are  to  be  in  the  name  of  the 
substituted party, but any misnomer that does 
not affect the substantial rights of the parties 
may  be  disregarded.  Substitution  may  be 
ordered  at  any  time,  but  failure  to  order 
substitution of the successor does not affect 
the substitution. 

b)  Abatement.  If 

is  an  original 
the  case 
proceeding  under  Rule  52,  the  court  must 
abate the proceeding to allow the successor to 
reconsider the original party's decision.  In all 
other cases, the suit will not abate,  and the 
successor  will  be  bound  by  the  appellate 
court's judgment or order as if the successor 
were the original party.

.6. Agreements of Parties or Counsel 

To be enforceable, an agreement of parties or their 
counsel  concerning  an  appellate  court  proceeding 
must be in writing and signed by the parties or their 
counsel. Such an agreement is subject to any appellate 
court  order  necessary  to  ensure  that  the  case  is 
properly presented. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: Former Rules 7 and 
57 are merged and substantially revised.  Former Rule 
8 regarding agreements of counsel is included here as 
subdivision 6.6 and the requirement that an agreement 
be filed and included in the record is deleted. 

1)  Civil Cases. If a party to a civil case dies 
after the trial court renders judgment but 
before the case has been finally disposed 
of  on  appeal, 
the  appeal  may  be 
perfected,  and  the  appellate  court  will 
proceed to adjudicate the appeal as if all 
parties were alive. The appellate court's 
judgment  will  have  the  same  force  and 
effect  as  if  rendered  when  all  parties 
were  living.  The  decedent  party's  name 
may be used on all papers. 

 

(2)  Criminal  Cases.  If  the  appellant  in  a 
criminal  case  dies  after  an  appeal  is 
perfected but before  the  appellate  court 
issues  the  mandate,  the  appeal  will  be 
permanently abated. 

  (

 

(b)  Substitution 

for  Other  Reasons. 

If 
substitution of a party in the appellate court is 
necessary for a  reason other  than death,  the 
appellate  court    may    order  substitution  on 
any party's motion at any time.

attorney's  State  Bar  of  Texas  identification 
number, mailing address, telephone number, 
fax number, if any, and email address. 

b)  Unrepresented  Parties.  A  party  not 
represented  by  counsel  must  sign  any 
document  that  the party  files  and   give   the  
party’s  mailing  address,  telephone number, 
fax number, if any, and email address. 

c)  Electronic   Signatures.   A    document   that   
is electronically served, filed, or issued by a 
court  or  clerk  is  considered  signed  if  the 
document includes: 

  (

  (

1)  a  “/s/”  and  name  typed  in  the  space 
where  the  signature  would  otherwise 
appear, unless the document is notarized 
or sworn; or 

2)  an electronic image or scanned image of 

the signature. 

(a)  With  Whom.  A  document  is  filed  in  an 

appellate court by delivering it to: 

1)  the  clerk  of  the  court  in  which  the 

document is to be filed; or 

 

(2)  a  justice  or  judge  of  that  court  who  is 
willing  to  accept  delivery.  A  justice  or 
judge who accepts delivery must note on 
the  document  the  date  and  time  of 
delivery,  which  will  be  considered  the 
time of filing, and must promptly send it 
to the clerk. 

(b)  Filing by Mail. 

1)  Timely  Filing.  A  document  received 
within ten days after the filing deadline 
is considered timely filed if: 

(A)  it  was  sent  to  the  proper  clerk  by 
United  States  Postal  Service  or  a 
commercial delivery service; 

B)  it  was  placed  in  an  envelope  or 
wrapper  properly  addressed  and 
stamped; and

requirement  that    the  bankruptcy  notice 
contain  certain  pages  of  the  bankruptcy 
petition  is  eliminated,  given  that  electronic 
filing is now prevalent in bankruptcy courts 
and  bankruptcy  petitions  are  available 
through the federal PACER system. 

.2.    Effect of Bankruptcy 

A bankruptcy suspends the appeal and all periods 
in  these  rules  from  the  date  when  the  bankruptcy 
petition is filed until the appellate court reinstates or 
severs the appeal in accordance with federal law.  A 
period that began to run and had not expired at the time 
the proceeding was suspended begins anew when the 
proceeding  is  reinstated  or  severed  under  8.3.  A 
document  filed  by  a  party  while  the  proceeding  is 
suspended will be deemed filed on the same day, but 
after, the court reinstates or severs the appeal and will 
not  be  considered  ineffective  because  it  was  filed 
while the proceeding was suspended.

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change:  This is former  Rule  
4. Subdivision 9.4, prescribing the form of documents 
filed in the appellate courts, is changed and the form 
to  be  used  is  stated  in  significantly  more  detail.  
Former subdivisions (f) and (g), regarding service of 
documents,  are  merged  into  subdivision  9.5.  Former 
Rule  6  is  included  as  subdivision  9.6,  but  no 
substantive change is made.  Other changes are made 
throughout the rule. Electronic filing is authorized by 
§§ 51.801-.807 of the Government Code. 
 

Comment to 2002 change:  The change [to Rule 
9.5(a)] clarifies that the filing party must serve a copy 
of the document filed on all other parties, not only in 
an  appeal  or  review,  but  in  original  proceedings  as 
well.      The  rule  applies  only  to  filing  parties.  Thus, 
when  the  clerk  or  court  reporter  is  responsible  for 
filing the record, as in cases on appeal, a copy need not 
be  served  on  the  parties.  The  rule  for  original  civil 
proceedings, in which a party is responsible for filing 
the record, is stated in subdivision 52.7. 
 

Subdivision  9.7  is  added  to  provide  express 
authorization for the practice of adopting by reference 
all or part of another party's filing. 
 

in  suits  affecting 

Comment  to  2008  change:  Subdivision  9.3  is 
amended to reduce the number of copies of a motion 
for extension of time or response filed in the Supreme 
Court. Subdivision 9.8 is new. To protect the privacy 
of  minors 
the  parent-child 
relationship  (SAPCR),  including  suits  to  terminate 
parental rights, Section 109.002(d) of the Family Code 
authorizes  appellate  courts,  in  their  opinions,  to 
identify parties only by fictitious names or by initials. 
Similarly,  Section  56.01(j)  of  the  Family  Code 
prohibits identification of a minor or a minor's family 
in  an  appellate  opinion  related  to  juvenile  court 
proceedings.  But as appellate briefing becomes more 
widely  available  through  electronic  media  sources, 
appellate courts' efforts to protect minors' privacy by 
disguising their identities in appellate opinions may be 
defeated  if  the  same  children  are  fully  identified  in 
briefs  and other  court papers  available  to  the public. 
The  rule  provides  protection  from  such  disclosures.   
Any  fictitious  name  should  not  be  pejorative  or 
suggest the person's true identity.   The rule does not 
limit an appellate court's authority to disguise parties' 
identities in appropriate circumstances in other cases.   
Although appellate courts are authorized to enforce the

(g) Sealed materials. Materials  that  are required 
by  statute  to  be  sealed,  redacted,  or  kept 
confidential,  such  as  the  items  set  out  in 
Articles  35.29  (Personal  Information  About 
(Evidence  Depicting  or 
Jurors),  38.45 
Describing  Abuse  of  or  Sexual  Conduct  by 
Child  or  Minor),  and  42.12, §  9(j), must be 
treated  in  accordance  with  the  pertinent 
statutes and shall not be publicly available on 
the  internet.  A  court  may  also  order  that  a 
document be filed under seal in paper form or 
electronic form, without redaction. The court 
may  later  unseal  the  document  or  order  the 
filer  to  provide  a  redacted  version  of  the 
document  for  the  public  record.  If  a  court 
orders material sealed, whether it be sensitive 
data  or  other  materials,  the  court's  sealing 
order  must  be  affixed  to  the  outside  of  the 
sealed container if the sealed material is filed 
in paper form, or be the first document that 
appears  if  filed  in  electronic  form.  Sealed 
portions of the clerk's and reporter's records 
should be clearly marked and separated from 
unsealed  portions  and  tendered  as  separate 
records, whether in paper form or electronic 
form.  Sealed  material  shall  not  be  available 
either on the internet or in other form without 
court order. 

h) Waiver of Protection of Identifiers. A person 
waives  the  protection  of  this  rule  as  to  a 
person’s own information by filing it without 
redaction and not under seal. 

Rule 10. Motions in the Appellate Courts

removing  the  sensitive  data  in  a  manner 
indicating  that  the  data  has  been  redacted. 
The filer must retain an unredacted version of 
the  filed  document  during  the  pendency  of 
the appeal and any related proceedings filed 
within three years of the date the judgment is 
signed.  If  a  district  court  clerk  or  appellate 
court  clerk  discovers  unredacted  sensitive 
data  in  the record,  the  clerk shall  notify  the 
parties and seek a ruling from the court.

reference list has been, or will be, provided. 
On its own initiative, the court may order a

Comment to 1997 change: This is former Rule 20.  
The  rule  is  rewritten  and  now  requires  disclosure  of 
the identity of the person or entity on whose behalf the 
brief is filed, and the source of any fee paid. 
 

Comment to 2002 change: The change expressly 
recognizes  that  a  court  may  refuse  to  consider  an 
amicus curiae brief for good cause.

2.1.  Docketing the Case 

On receiving a copy of the notice of appeal, the

Notes and Comments 

(b) 

Comment to 1997 change: This is former Rule 19. 
Under subdivision 10.1, a response may be filed at any 
time  before  the  court  rules  on  the  motion.  The 
provision  of 
regarding 
former  subdivision 
docketing  motions  is  incorporated  in  Rule  12.2.  The 
provision  of  former  subdivision  (b)  for  noting 
attorneys’ names on the docket is incorporated in Rule 
6.2.      Former  subdivision  (c),  requiring  the  clerk  to 
send  notices  of  the  filing  of  motions  is  deleted  as 
unnecessary because the parties must serve all motions 
under  Rule  9.5.  Subdivision  10.2  is  amended  to 
eliminate the requirement of an oath where the facts 
are  within  the  personal  knowledge  of  the  attorney. 
Subdivision  10.5 
the 
is  new  and 
provisions  of  other  rules  concerning  motions,  as 
follows:  10.5(a)  from  former  Rule  71;  10.5(b)  from

each  item  received  in  connection  with  the  case  and 
must put the docket number on the envelope in which 
the record is stored. 
 

(a)  Numbering System. Each case filed in a court 
of appeals must be assigned a docket number 
the  following  four  parts,

2.5.  Clerk's Duty to Account 

The  clerk  of  an  appellate  court  who  receives 
money  due  another  court  must  promptly  pay  the 
money  to  the  court  to  whom  it  is  due.  This  rule  is 
enforceable by the Supreme Court. 

2.6.  Notices of Court’s Judgments and Orders 

In any proceeding, the clerk of an appellate court 
must  promptly  send  a  notice  of  any  judgment, 
mandate,  or  other  court  order  to  all  parties  to  the 
proceeding.

d)  Appeals Not Yet Filed. A motion relating to 
an appeal that has been perfected but not yet 
filed must be docketed and assigned a docket 
number  that  will  also  be  assigned  to  the 
appeal when it is filed. 

2.3.  Custody of Papers 

The  clerk  must  safeguard  the  record  and  every 
other item filed in a case. If the record or any part of it 
or any other  item  is  missing,  the  court will  make  an 
order for the replacement of the record or item that is 
just under the circumstances. 

2.4.  Withdrawing Papers 

The  clerk  may  permit  the  record  or  other  filed 
item to be taken from the clerk’s office at any time, on 
the following conditions: 
 

(a)  the clerk must have a receipt for the record or 

item;  

Comment to 1997 change: This is former Rule 18. 
Former  subdivision  (b),  regarding  the  preparation  of 
the  record,  is  moved  to  the  order  concerning  the

d)  have  the original  recording stored  to  ensure 
that it is preserved and is accessible; and 

e)  ensure that no one gains access to the original 
recording without the court's written order. 

3.3.  Priorities of Reporters 

The  trial  court  must  help  ensure  that  the  court 
reporter's work is timely accomplished by setting work 
priorities. The reporter's duties relating to proceedings 
before the court take preference over other work. 

3.4.  Report of Reporters 

to  send  a  notice  of  any  order  or  judgment  of  an 
appellate court, is added. Other changes are made. 
 

Comment  to  2002  change:  Subdivision  12.6  is 
amended to require the clerk to notify the parties of all 
of the court's rulings, including the mandate. 
 

 
Rule 13. Court Reporters and Court Recorders 

3.1.  Duties of Court Reporters and Recorders 

The official court reporter or court recorder must: 

(a)  unless  excused  by  agreement  of  the  parties, 
attend court sessions and make a full record 
of the proceedings; 
 

(b)  take all exhibits offered in evidence during  a 
proceeding and ensure that they are marked; 
 

(c)  file all exhibits with the trial court clerk after 

a proceeding ends; 

d)  perform the duties prescribed by Rules 34.6 

and 35; and 

e)  perform  other  acts  relating  to  the  reporter's  
or recorder's official duties, as the trial court 
directs. 

To  aid  the  trial  court  in  setting  priorities  under 
13.3,  each  court  reporter  must  give  the  trial  court  a 
monthly written report showing the amount and nature 
of the business pending in the reporter's office. A copy 
of this report must be filed with the appellate clerk of 
each district in which the court sits. 

3.2.  Additional Duties of Court Recorder 

3.5.  Appointing Deputy Reporter 

The official court recorder must also: 

(a)  ensure  that  the  recording  system  functions 
properly throughout the proceeding and that 
a complete, clear, and transcribable recording 
is made; 

b)  make a detailed, legible log of all proceedings 

being recorded, showing: 

When  the  official  court  reporter  is  unable  to 
perform the duties in 13.1 or 13.2 because of illness, 
press  of  official  work,  or  unavoidable  absence  or 
disability,  the  trial  court  may  designate  a  deputy 
reporter.  If the court appoints a deputy reporter, that 
person must file with the trial court clerk a document 
stating: 
 

(a)  the date the deputy worked; 

1)  the number and style of the case before 

b)  the court in which the deputy worked;  

the court;

must  be  filed  no  later  than  five  days 
before  the  date  the  case  is  set  for 
argument  and  must  be  served  on  all 
parties to the case. A request to cover any 
other  proceeding  must  be  filed  no  later 
than two days before the date when the 
proceeding is to begin.

(b)  Response. Any party may file a response to 
the  request.  If  the  request  is  to  cover 
argument, the response must be filed no later 
than  two  days  before  the  date  set  for 
argument. If a party objects to coverage of the 
argument, the response should state the injury 
that will allegedly result from coverage. 

c)  Court May Shorten Time. The court may, in 
the  interest  of  justice,  shorten  the  time  for 
filing a document under this rule if no party 
interested  person  would  be  unduly 
or 
prejudiced. 

d)  Decision  of  Court.  In  deciding  whether  to 
allow  coverage,  the  court  may  consider 
information known ex parte to the court. The 
court  may  allow,  deny,  limit,  or  terminate 
coverage  for  any reason  the court  considers 
necessary  or  appropriate,  such  as  protecting 
the parties' rights or the dignity of the court 
and  ensuring  the  orderly  conduct  of  the 
proceedings.

retain the notes beyond 15 years of their filing date. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: Former Rules 11 and 
12 are merged. Former Rules 11(a), (c) and (d) now 
appear  as  subdivisions  13.1,  13.5  and  13.6.  Former 
Rule 11(b) is omitted as unnecessary. The provisions 
of former Rule 12(a) are moved to Rule 35.3.   Former 
Rules 12(b) and (c) now appear as subdivisions 13.3 
and 13.4. The rule is made to apply to court recorders 
as  well  as  court  reporters.  Paragraph  13.1(a)  merges 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of former Rule 11, and now 
requires the reporter to make a record of voir dire and 
closing argument unless excused by agreement of the 
parties. Paragraph 13.1(b) is new, but codifies current 
practice. Subdivision 13.2 is new and specifies rules 
for  electronic  recording  of  proceedings.  A  provision 
requiring a deputy court reporter to file with the trial 
court clerk a document identifying the proceedings in 
which  the  reporter  worked  is  included  in  paragraph 
13.5. Other changes are made. 
 

Comment to 2002 change: Subdivision 13.1(a) is 

amended merely for clarification. 

Rule 14. Recording and Broadcasting Court 
Proceedings 

4.1.  Recording and Broadcasting Permitted 

An  appellate  court  may  permit  courtroom 
proceedings  to  be  broadcast,  televised,  recorded,  or 
photographed in accordance with this rule. 

4.2.  Procedure 

1)  A person wishing to broadcast, televise, 
record, or photograph a court proceeding 
must file with the court clerk a request to 
cover the proceeding. The request must

The court may, among other things: 

(a)  require  that  a  person  seeking  to  cover  a 
proceeding  demonstrate  or  display 
the 
equipment that will be used; 

(A)  the case style and number; 

b)  prohibit equipment that produces distracting

more writs simultaneously. 

5.2.  Appearance  Without  Service;  Actual 
Knowledge 
 

A party who appears in person or by attorney in 
an  appellate  court  proceeding  —  or  who  has  actual 
knowledge of the court's opinion, judgment, or order 
related to a writ or process — is bound by the opinion, 
judgment, or order to the same extent as if personally 
served under 15.1.

Nonsubstantive changes are made. 

Rule 16. Disqualification or Recusal of Appellate 
Judges 

6.1.  Grounds for Disqualification 

The  grounds  for  disqualification  of  an  appellate 
the 

judge  are  determined  by 

justice  or 

court 
Constitution and laws of Texas. 

6.2.  Grounds for Recusal 

The  grounds  for  recusal  of  an  appellate  court 
justice or judge are the same as those provided in the 
Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.    In  addition,  a  justice  or 
judge  must  recuse  in  a  proceeding  if  it  presents  a 
material issue which the justice or judge participated 
in  deciding  while  serving  on  another  court  in  which 
the proceeding was pending. 

6.3.  Procedure for Recusal

(a)  Motion. A party may file a motion to recuse 
a  justice  or  judge  before  whom  the  case  is 
pending.   The motion must be filed promptly 
after the party has reason to believe that the 
justice  or  judge  should  not  participate  in 
deciding the case. 

b)  Decision.  Before  any  further  proceeding  in 
the case, the challenged justice or judge must 
either  remove  himself  or  herself  from  all 
participation in the case or certify the matter 
to  the  entire  court,  which  will  decide  the 
motion by a majority of the remaining judges 
sitting  en  banc.  The  challenged  justice  or

4.4.  Enforcement 

The court may sanction a violation of this rule by 
measures that include barring a person or organization 
from access to future coverage of proceedings in that 
court for a defined period. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: This is former Rule 21. 
The  rule  is  rewritten  and  now  allows  recording  and 
broadcasting of court proceedings at the discretion of 
the court and subject to the stated guidelines. 

Rule 15. Issuance of Writ or Process by Appellate 
Court 

5.1.  In General 

(a)  Signature  Under  Seal.  A  writ  or  process 
issuing from an appellate court must bear the 
court's seal and be signed by the clerk. 

b)  To Whom Directed; by Whom Served. Unless 
a rule or statute provides otherwise, the writ 
or process must be directed to the person or 
court to be served. The writ or process may 
be  served by  the  sheriff,  constable, or other 
peace officer whose jurisdiction includes the 
county  in  which  the  person  or  court  to  be 
served may be found. 

c)  Return;  Lack  of  Execution;  Simultaneous 
Writs. The writ or process must be returned 
to  the  issuing  court  according  to  the  writ's 
direction.  If  the  writ  or  process  is  not 
executed, the clerk may issue another writ or

Notes and Comments 

The clerk of the appellate court that rendered the 
judgment must issue a mandate in accordance with the 
judgment and send it to the clerk of the court to which 
it is directed and to all parties to the proceeding when 
one of the following periods expires: 
 

(a)  In the Court of Appeals. 

1)  Ten  days  after  the  time  has  expired for 
filing  a  motion  to  extend  time  to  file  a 
petition  for  review  or  a  petition  for 
discretionary review if: 

(A)  no  timely  petition  for  review  or 
petition for discretionary review has 
been filed; 

B)  no  timely  filed  motion  to  extend 
time to file a petition for review or 
petition  for  discretionary  review  is 
pending; and 

C)  in  a  criminal  case,  the  Court  of 
Criminal  Appeals  has  not  granted 
review on its own initiative. 

  (

  (

2)  Ten  days  after  the  time  has  expired for 
filing  a  motion  to  extend  time  to  file  a 
motion for rehearing of a denial, refusal, 
or dismissal of a petition for review, or a 
refusal  or  dismissal  of  a  petition  for 
discretionary  review,  if  no  timely  filed 
motion for rehearing or motion to extend 
time is pending. 

  (

 

  (

 

(b)  In  the  Supreme  Court  and  the  Court  of 
Criminal  Appeals.    Ten  days  after  the  time 
has expired for filing a motion to extend time 
to  file  a  motion  for  rehearing  if  no  timely 
filed  motion  for  rehearing  or  motion  to 
extend time is pending. 

c)  Agreement  to  Issue.  The  mandate  may  be 
issued  earlier  if  the  parties  so  agree,  or  for 
good cause on the motion of a party. 

Comment to 1997 change: Former Rules 15 and 
15a  are  merged.    Former  Rule  15a  appears  as 
subdivision  16.2.  For  grounds  for  disqualification, 
reference  is  made  to  the  Constitution  and  statutes 
rather  than  the  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.  The 
procedure  for  disqualification  is  not  specified.  The 
nature  of  prior  participation  in  a  proceeding  that 
requires recusal is clarified. Former subdivision (b) of 
Rule 15, requiring service of the motion, is omitted as 
unnecessary.  The  remaining  subdivisions  of  former 
Rule  15  are  contained  in  subdivision  16.3.  Other 
changes are made. 

Rule 17. Court of Appeals Unable to Take 
Immediate Action 

7.1.  Inability to Act 

A  court  of  appeals  is  unable  to  take  immediate 
action if it cannot — within the time when action must 
be taken — assemble a panel because members of the 
court are ill, absent, or unavailable.   A justice who is 
disqualified  or  recused  is  unavailable.    A  court  of 
appeals’ 
immediately  may  be 
established by certificate of the clerk, a member of the 
court, or a party’s counsel, or by affidavit of a party. 

inability 

to  act 

7.2.  Nearest Available Court of Appeals 

If a court of appeals is unable to take immediate 
action, the nearest court of appeals that is able to take 
immediate  action  may do  so with  the  same effect  as 
the other court. The nearest court of appeals is the one 
whose courthouse is nearest — measured by a straight 
line — the courthouse of the trial court. 

7.3.  Further Proceedings 

After acting or refusing to act, the nearest court of 
appeals must promptly  send  a  copy of  its order,  and 
the original or a copy of any document presented to it, 
to  the  other  court,  which  will  conduct  any  further 
proceedings in the matter.

A party may move to stay issuance of the mandate 
pending the United States Supreme Court's disposition 
of  a  petition  for  writ  of  certiorari.  The  motion  must 
state the grounds for the petition and the circumstances 
requiring  the  stay.  The  appellate  court  authorized  to 
issue the mandate may grant a stay if it finds that the 
grounds are substantial and that the petitioner or others 
would  incur  serious  hardship  from  the  mandate's 
issuance if the United States Supreme Court were later 
to  reverse  the  judgment.  In  a  criminal  case,  the  stay 
will last for no more than 90 days, to permit the timely 
filing  of  a  petition  for  writ  of  certiorari.  After  that 
period  and  others  mentioned  in  this  rule  expire,  the 
mandate will issue. 

8.3.  Trial Court Case Number 

The  mandate  must  state  the  trial  court  case 

number. 

8.4.  Filing of Mandate 

The clerk receiving the mandate will file it with 

the case's other papers and note it on the docket. 

Comment  to  2002  change:  Subdivision  18.1  is 
amended  consistent  with  the  change  in  subdivision 
12.6. 

Rule 19. Plenary Power of the Courts of Appeals 
and Expiration of Term 

9.1.  Plenary Power of Courts of Appeals 

A  court  of  appeals'  plenary  power  over  its 

judgment expires: 
 

for 

(a)  60  days  after  judgment  if  no  timely  filed 
motion 
banc 
rehearing 
reconsideration,  or  timely  filed  motion  to 
extend  time  to  file  such  a  motion,  is  then 
pending; or 

en 

or 

b)  30  days  after  the  court  overrules  all  timely 
filed  motions  for  rehearing  or  en  banc 
reconsideration, and all timely filed motions 
to extend time to file such a motion. 

8.5.  Costs 

9.2.  Plenary Power Continues After Petition Filed 

The  mandate  will  be  issued  without  waiting  for 
costs to be paid. If the Supreme Court declines to grant 
review, Supreme Court costs must be included in the 
court of appeals’ mandate. 

In a civil case, the court of appeals retains plenary 
power  to  vacate  or  modify  its  judgment  during  the 
periods prescribed in 19.1 even if a party has filed a 
petition for review in the Supreme Court. 

8.6.  Mandate in Accelerated Appeals 

9.3.  Proceedings After Plenary Power Expires 

The appellate court's judgment on an appeal from 
an interlocutory order takes effect when the mandate 
is  issued.  The  court  may  issue  the  mandate  with  its 
judgment  or  delay  the  mandate  until  the  appeal  is 
finally  disposed  of.  If  the  mandate  is  issued,  any 
further proceeding in the trial court must conform to 
the mandate. 

8.7.  Recall of Mandate 

If  an  appellate  court  vacates  or  modifies  its 
judgment  or  order  after  issuing  its  mandate,  the 
appellate clerk must promptly notify the clerk of the 
court  to  which  the  mandate  was  directed  and  all 
parties.  The  mandate  will  have  no  effect  and  a  new 
mandate may be issued. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: This is a new rule that 
combines  the  provisions  of  former  Rules  43(g),  86, 
186, 231, and 232. 

After its plenary power expires, the court cannot 

vacate or modify its judgment. But the court may: 
 

(a)  correct  a  clerical  error  in  its  judgment  or 

opinion;  

provide;  

b)  issue  and  recall  its  mandate  as  these  rules 

c)  enforce  or  suspend  enforcement  of 

its 
judgment  as  these  rules  or  applicable  law 
provide; 

d)  order  or  modify  the  amount  and  type  of 
security required to suspend a judgment, and 
decide the sufficiency of the sureties, under 
Rule 24; and 

e)  order  its  opinion  published  in  accordance 

with Rule 47.

Notes and Comments 

Comment  to  1997  change:  This  is  a  new  rule 
except  the  provisions  of  former  Rule  234  are 
incorporated in subdivision 19.4. 
 

Comment  to  2002  change:  Subdivision  19.1  is 
amended  to  clarify  that  a  motion  for  en  banc 
reconsideration extends  the court of  appeals'  plenary 
power in the same manner as a motion for rehearing 
addressed  to  the  panel  of  justices  who  rendered  the 
judgment or under consideration. 
 

Comment  to  2008  change:  Subdivision  19.1  is 
changed, consistent with other changes in the rules, to 
specifically  address  a  motion 
for  en  banc 
reconsideration  and  treat  it  as  having  the  effect  of  a 
motion for rehearing. 

Rule 20. When Party is Indigent 

0.1.  Civil Cases 

(a)  Costs  Defined.  In  this  rule,  “costs”  mean 
filing  fees  charged  by  the  appellate  court. 
Fees charged for preparation of the appellate 
record are governed by Texas Rule of Civil 
Procedure 145. 

(b)  When  a  Statement  Was  Filed  in  the  Trial 

Court.

Carries  Forward.  A  party  who  filed  a 
Statement of Inability to Afford Payment 
of  Court  Costs  in  the  trial  court  is  not 
required  to  pay  costs  in  the  appellate 
court unless the trial court overruled the 
party’s  claim  of  indigence  in  an  order 
that  complies  with  Texas  Rule  of  Civil 
Procedure 145. A party is not required to 
pay costs in the appellate court if the trial 
court  ordered  the  party  to  pay  partial 
costs or to pay costs in installments.

the party is presumed indigent under this

these  rules,  the  applicability  of  the 
presumption  should  be  stated  in  the 
notice  of  appeal  and  in  the  docketing 
statement.  

(3)  Exception;  Material  Change 

in 
Circumstances. An  appellate court may 
permit  a  party  who  is  not  entitled  to 
proceed  under  (1)  to  proceed  without 
payment of costs if the party establishes 
that  the  party’s  financial  circumstances 
have materially changed since the date of 
the trial court’s order under Texas Rule 
of Civil Procedure 145.

Comment to 2008 change: Subdivision 20.1(a) is 
added to provide, as in Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 
145, that an affidavit of indigence accompanied by an 
IOLTA or other Texas Access to Justice Foundation 
certificate 
challenged.  Subdivision 
20.1(c)(1)  is  revised  to  clarify  that  an  affidavit  of 
indigence  filed  to  proceed  in  the  trial  court  without 
advance  payment  of  costs  is  insufficient  to  establish 
indigence on appeal; a separate affidavit must be filed 
with  or  before  the  notice  of  appeal.      Subdivision 
20.1(c)(3) is revised to provide that an appellate court 
must  give  an  appellant  who  fails  to  file  a  proper 
appellate indigence affidavit notice of the defect and 
an opportunity to cure it before dismissing the appeal 
or affirming the judgment on that basis.  See Higgins 
v.  Randall  County  Sheriff's  Office,  193  S.W.3d  898 
(Tex.  2006).    The  limiting  phrase  “under  (c)(2)”  in 
Subdivision  20.1(d)(2)  is  deleted  to  clarify  that  the 
appellate clerk's duty to forward copies of the affidavit 
to  the  trial  court  clerk  and  the  court  reporter,  along 
with a notice setting a deadline to contest the affidavit, 
applies to affidavits on appeal erroneously filed in the 
appellate court, not only to affidavits in other appellate 
proceedings properly filed in the appellate court under 
subdivision 20.1(c)(2).  Although Subdivision 3.1(g) 
defines  “court  reporter”  to  include  court  recorder, 
subdivision  20.1(e)  is  amended  to  make  clear  that  a 
court recorder can contest an affidavit.

SECTION TWO: APPEALS FROM TRIAL 
COURT JUDGMENTS AND ORDERS 
 
Rule 21. New Trials in Criminal Cases 

1.1.  Definitions 

(a)  New trial means the rehearing of a criminal 
action  after  the  trial  court  has,  on  the 
defendant's  motion,  set  aside  a  finding  or 
verdict of guilt. 

b)  New  trial  on  punishment  means  a  new 
hearing of the punishment stage of a criminal 
action  after  the  trial  court  has,  on  the 
defendant's  motion,  set  aside  an  assessment 
of punishment without setting aside a finding 
or verdict of guilt. 

  (

 

   

  2

 

The  rule  has  been  rewritten  so  that  it  only  governs 
filing fees and any other fee charged by the appellate 
court.  Texas  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  145  governs  a 
party’s claim that the party is unable to afford costs for 
preparation of the appellate record. 

ecause appellate filing fees are minimal, a party that 
filed  a  Statement  of  Inability  to  Afford  Payment  of 
Court Costs in the trial court is not required to file a 
new  Statement  in  the  appellate  court  unless  the  trial 
court made affirmative findings under Texas Rule of 
Civil Procedure 145 that the party is able to afford all 
court costs and to pay those costs as they are incurred. 
Furthermore, because a determination of indigence by 
the  trial  court  carries  forward  to  appeal  in  all  cases, 
Family Code section 107.013 is satisfied. 

xperience  has  shown  that,  in  most  cases,  a  party’s 
financial  circumstances  do  not  change  substantially 
between the trial court proceedings and the appellate 
court proceedings. Nonetheless, (b)(3) permits a party 
whom  the  trial  court determined  is  able  to afford  all 
costs  to  demonstrate  to  the  appellate  court  that  the 
party’s  circumstances  have  changed  since  the  trial 
court’s  ruling  and  that  the  party  is  unable  to  afford 
appellate filing fees.  

0.2.  Criminal Cases 

Within  the  time  for  perfecting  the  appeal,  an 
appellant who is unable to pay for the appellate record 
may,  by  motion  and  affidavit,  ask  the  trial  court  to 
have the appellate record furnished without charge. If 
after  hearing  the  motion  the  court  finds  that  the 
appellant cannot pay or give security for the appellate 
record, the court must order the reporter to transcribe 
the  proceedings.  When  the  court  certifies  that  the 
appellate  record  has  been  furnished  to  the  appellant, 
the reporter must be paid from the general funds of the 
county  in  which  the  offense  was  committed,  in  the 
amount set by the trial court. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment  to  1997  change:  The  rule  is  new  and 
combines  the  provisions  of  former  Rules  13(k), 
40(a)(3), and 53(j).  The procedure for proceeding in 
civil  cases  in  an  appellate  court  without  advance 
payment  of  costs,  in  both  appeals  and  original 
proceedings,  is  stated.  The  information  that  must  be 
given  in  the  affidavit  is  prescribed.  An  extension  of 
time to file the affidavit is now available.  The indigent 
party is no longer required to serve the court reporter, 
but  must  file  the  affidavit  with  the  appropriate  clerk 
who is to notify the court reporter. A contest need not 
be under oath. Provision is made for later ability to pay

(b)  To  Amend.  Within  30  days  after  the  date 
when  the  trial  court  imposes  or  suspends 
sentence  in  open  court  but  before  the  court 
overrules any preceding motion for new trial, 
a defendant may, without leave of court, file 
one or more amended motions for new trial. 

The State may oppose in writing any reason the 
defendant sets forth in the motion for new trial. The 
State's having opposed a motion for new trial does not 
affect a defendant's responsibilities under 21.6. 

1.6.  Time to Present 

The  defendant  must  present  the  motion  for  new 
trial to the trial court within 10 days of filing it, unless 
the trial court in its discretion permits it to be presented 
and heard within 75 days from the date when the court 
imposes or suspends sentence in open court. 

1.7.  Types of Evidence Allowed at Hearing 

The  court  may  receive  evidence  by  affidavit  or 

otherwise. 

1.8.  Court's Ruling 

(a)  Time to Rule. The court must rule on a motion 
for new trial within 75 days after imposing or 
suspending sentence in open court. 
 

(b)  Ruling.  In  ruling  on  a  motion  for  new  trial, 
the court may make oral or written findings 
of fact.  The granting of a motion for new trial 
must  be  accomplished  by  written  order.  A 
docket  entry  does  not  constitute  a  written 
order. 

c)  Failure to Rule. A motion not timely ruled on 
by written order will be deemed denied when 
the period prescribed in (a) expires. 

1.9.  Granting a New Trial 

(a)  A  court  must  grant  a  new  trial  when  it  has 
found a meritorious ground for new trial, but 
a  court  must  grant  only  a  new  trial  on 
punishment when it has found a ground that 
affected only the assessment of punishment. 

b)  Granting  a  new  trial  restores  the  case  to  its 
position before the former trial, including, at 
any  party's  option,  arraignment  or  pretrial 
proceedings initiated by that party.

1.2.  When Motion for New Trial Required 

A  motion  for  new  trial  is  a  prerequisite  to 
presenting  a  point  of  error  on  appeal  only  when 
necessary to adduce facts not in the record. 

The defendant  must  be  granted  a new  trial,  or  a 
new  trial  on  punishment,  for  any  of  the  following 
reasons: 
 

(a)  except in  a  misdemeanor  case  in  which  the 
maximum  possible  punishment  is  a  fine, 
when the defendant has been unlawfully tried 
in absentia or has been denied counsel; 

b)  when the court has misdirected the jury about 
the law or has committed some other material 
error likely to injure the defendant's rights; 

c)  when the verdict has been decided by lot or 
in any manner other than a fair expression of 
the jurors' opinion; 

d)  when a juror has been bribed to convict or has 
been guilty of any other corrupt conduct; 
 

(e)  when  a  material  defense  witness  has  been 
kept from court by force, threats, or fraud, or 
when  evidence  tending  to  establish  the 
defendant's innocence has been intentionally 
destroyed  or  withheld,  thus  preventing  its 
production at trial; 
 

(f)  when,  after  retiring  to  deliberate,  the  jury  
has received other evidence; when a juror has 
talked with anyone about the case; or when a 
juror  became  so  intoxicated  that  his  or  her 
vote was probably influenced as a result; 

g)  when 

the 

in  such 
jury  has  engaged 
misconduct that the defendant did not receive 
a fair and impartial trial; or 

h)  when the verdict is contrary to the law and the 

evidence. 

1.4.  Time to File and Amend Motion 

(a)  To File. The defendant may file a motion for 
new  trial  before,  but  no  later  than  30  days 
after, the date when the trial court imposes or 
suspends sentence in open court.

judgment before, but no later than 30 days after, the 
date when the trial court imposes or suspends sentence 
in open court. 

2.4.  Court's Ruling 

(a)  Time to Rule; Form of Ruling. The court must 
rule on a motion in arrest of judgment within 
75  days  after 
imposing  or  suspending 
sentence  in  open  court.  The  ruling  may  be 
oral or in writing. 

b)  Failure to Rule. A motion not timely ruled on 
will  be  deemed  denied  when  the  period 
prescribed in (a) expires. 

  (

2.5.  Effect of Denying 

For purposes of  the  defendant's giving  notice  of 
appeal,  an  order  denying  a  motion  in  arrest  of 
judgment  will  be  considered  an  order  denying  a 
motion for new trial. 

2.6.  Effect of Granting 

(a)  Defendant Restored. If judgment is arrested, 
the defendant is restored to the position that 
he  or  she  had  before  the  indictment  or 
information was presented. 
 

(b)  Defendant  Discharged  or  Remanded.  If  the 
judgment  is  arrested,  the  defendant  will  be 
discharged.  But  the  trial  court  may  remand 
the  defendant  to  custody  or  fix  bail  if  the 
court determines, from the evidence adduced 
at trial, that the defendant may be convicted 
on a proper indictment or information, or on 
a proper verdict in relation to the indictment 
or information. 

c)  Granting a new trial on punishment restores 
the case to its position after the defendant was 
found guilty. Unless the defendant, State, and 
trial court all agree to a change, punishment 
in a new trial shall be assessed in accordance 
with  the  defendant's  original  election  under 
article 37.07, § 2(b) of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure. 

d)  A finding or verdict of guilt in the former trial 
must  not  be  regarded  as  a  presumption  of 
guilt, nor may it be alluded to in the presence 
of  the  jury  that  hears  the  case  on  retrial  of 
guilt.  A finding of fact or an assessment of 
punishment  in  the  former  trial  may  not  be 
alluded  to  in  the  presence  of  the  jury  that 
hears the case on retrial of punishment. 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: Former Rules 30, 31, 
and 32 are merged. Paragraph (b)(6) of former Rule 30 
is  deleted  because  the  rule-making  authority  of  the 
Court of Criminal Appeals was withdrawn.   See Code 
of  Criminal  Procedure  article  40.001.  Other 
nonsubstantive changes are made.

sureties  on  a  bond,  any  deposit  in  lieu  of  a 
bond, or any alternate security ordered by the 
court  is  subject  to  liability  for  all  damages 
and  costs  that  may  be  awarded  against  the 
debtor  —  up  to  the  amount  of  the  bond, 
deposit, or security — if: 

1)  the debtor does not perfect an appeal or 
the debtor’s appeal is dismissed, and the 
debtor does not perform the trial court’s 
judgment; 

Comment to 1997 change: This is former Rule 36. 

The rule is amended without substantive change. 

Rule 24. Suspension of Enforcement of Judgment 
Pending Appeal in Civil Cases 

4.1.  Suspension of Enforcement 

(a)  Methods.      Unless  the  law  or  these  rules 
provide  otherwise,  a  judgment  debtor  may 
supersede the judgment by: 

1)  filing with the trial court clerk a written 
agreement with the judgment creditor for 
suspending 
the 
enforcement 
judgment; 

of 

2)  filing  with  the  trial  court  clerk  a  good 

and sufficient bond; 

3)  making  a  deposit  with  the  trial  court 

clerk in lieu of a bond; or 

4)  providing  alternate  security  ordered  by  

the court. 

 
(b)  Bonds. 

1)  A bond must be: 

  (

  (

  (

  (

  (

 

(A)  in the amount required by 24.2;  

B)  payable to the judgment creditor; 

C)  signed by the judgment debtor or the 

debtor’s agent; 

  (

  (

 

27 

 

 

  2

 

 

 

   

  2

 

3)  Other Judgment.  When the judgment is 
for  something  other  than  money  or  an 
interest in property, the trial court must 
set the amount and type of security that 
the  judgment  debtor  must  post.  The 
security  must  adequately  protect  the 
judgment creditor against loss or damage 
that the appeal might cause. But the trial 
court may decline to permit the judgment 
to be superseded if the judgment creditor 
posts security ordered by the trial court 
in  an  amount  and  type  that  will  secure 
the judgment debtor against any loss or 
damage caused by the relief granted the 
judgment  creditor  if  an  appellate  court 
determines, on final disposition, that that 
relief was improper. When the judgment 
debtor  is  the  state,  a department of  this 
state, or the head of a department of this 
state,  the  trial  court  must  permit  a 
judgment  to  be  superseded  except  in  a 
matter arising from a contested case in an 
administrative enforcement action. 

4)  Conservatorship or Custody.  When the 
judgment  involves  the  conservatorship 
or  custody  of  a  minor  or  other  person 
under legal disability, enforcement of the 
judgment will not be suspended, with or 
without  security,  unless  ordered  by  the 
trial  court.  But  upon  a  proper  showing, 
the  appellate  court  may 
suspend 
enforcement  of  the  judgment  with  or 
without security. 

 

(5)  For  a  Governmental  Entity.  When  a 
judgment  in  favor  of  a  governmental 
entity in its governmental capacity is one 
in  which  the  entity  has  no  pecuniary 
interest,  the  trial  court  must  determine 
whether to suspend enforcement, with or 
without security, taking into account the 
harm  that  is  likely  to  result  to  the 
judgment  debtor  if  enforcement  is  not 
suspended, and the harm that is likely to 
result 
is 
suspended.      The  appellate  court  may 
review  the  trial  court’s  determination 
and 
the 
suspend  enforcement  of 
judgment,  with  or  without  security,  or 
refuse  to  suspend  the  judgment.  If 
security  is  required,  recovery  is  limited 
to 
the  governmental  entity’s  actual 
damages  resulting  from  suspension  of 

if  enforcement 

to  others

3)  the  judgment  is  for  the  recovery  of  an 
interest in real or personal property, and 
the debtor does not pay the creditor the 
value  of  the  property  interest’s  rent  or 
revenue  during  the  pendency  of  the 
appeal. 

(e)  Orders  of  Trial  Court.  The  trial  court  may 
make  any  order  necessary  to  adequately 
protect the judgment creditor against loss or 
damage that the appeal might cause. 

f)  Effect  of  Supersedeas.    Enforcement  of  a 
judgment must be suspended if the judgment 
is superseded. Enforcement begun before the 
judgment is superseded must cease when the 
judgment  is  superseded.  If  execution  has 
been  issued,  the  clerk will  promptly  issue  a 
writ of supersedeas. 

4.2.  Amount of Bond, Deposit, or Security 

(a)  Type of Judgment. 

  (

  2

 

1)  For  Recovery  of  Money.  When  the 
judgment is for money, the amount of the 
bond, deposit, or security must equal the 
sum of compensatory damages awarded 
the 
in 
estimated  duration  of  the  appeal,  and 
costs  awarded in  the  judgment.  But  the 
amount must not exceed the lesser of: 

judgment, 

interest 

the 

for 

(A)  50 percent of the judgment debtor's 

current net worth; or 

B)  25 million dollars. 

2)  For  Recovery  of  Property.  When  the 
judgment  is  for  the  recovery  of  an 
interest in real or personal property, the 
trial  court  will  determine  the  type  of 
security  that  the  judgment  debtor  must 
post. The amount of that security must be 
at least: 

(A)  the  value  of  the  property  interest's 
rent  or  revenue,  if  the  property 
interest is real; or 

B)  the value of the property interest on 
the  date  when  the  court  rendered 
judgment, if the property interest is

that  period, 

(d)  Injunction.  The  trial  court  may  enjoin  the 
judgment  debtor 
from  dissipating  or 
transferring assets to avoid satisfaction of the 
judgment,  but  the  trial  court  may  not  make 
any  order  that  interferes  with  the  judgment 
debtor's  use, 
transfer,  conveyance,  or 
dissipation of assets in the normal course of 
business. 

4.3.    Continuing      Trial      Court      Jurisdiction;   
Duties   of Judgment Debtor 
 

(a)  Continuing Jurisdiction.  Even  after  the  trial 
court's plenary power expires, the trial court 
has  continuing 
the 
following: 

jurisdiction 

to  do 

1)  order  the  amount  and  type  of  security 
and  decide  the  sufficiency  of  sureties; 
and 

2)  if  circumstances  change,  modify  the 
amount  or  type  of  security  required  to 
continue the suspension of a judgment's 
execution. 

(b)  Duties  of  Judgment  Debtor.      If,  after 
jurisdiction attaches in an appellate court, the 
trial court orders or modifies the security or 
decides  the  sufficiency  of  sureties,  the 
judgment  debtor  must  notify  the  appellate 
court of the trial court's action. 

4.4.  Appellate Review 

  2

  2

 

(a)  Motions; Review.  A party may seek review 
of  the  trial  court's  ruling  by  motion  filed  in 
the  court  of  appeals  with  jurisdiction  or 
potential jurisdiction over the appeal from the 
judgment  in  the  case.    A  party  may  seek 
review of the court of appeals' ruling on the 
motion by petition for writ of mandamus in 
the Supreme Court. The appellate court may 
review: 

1)  the  sufficiency  or  excessiveness  of  the 
amount  of    security,    but    when    the  
judgment    is    for  money,  the  appellate 
court  must  not  modify  the  amount  of 
security to exceed the limits imposed by 
Rule 24.2(a)(1); 

 

  (

  (

 

  (

(b)  Lesser Amount.   The trial court must lower 
the amount of security required by (a) to an 
amount  that  will  not  cause  the  judgment 
debtor  substantial  economic  harm  if,  after 
notice to all parties and a hearing, the court 
finds that posting a bond, deposit, or security 
in  the  amount  required  by  (a)  is  likely  to 
judgment  debtor  substantial 
cause 
economic harm.

information  concerning 

1)  Judgment  Debtor's  Affidavit  Required; 
Contents;  Prima  Facie  Evidence.  A 
judgment  debtor  who  provides  a  bond, 
deposit, or security under (a)(1)(A) in an 
amount based on the debtor's net worth 
must  simultaneously  file  with  the  trial 
court  clerk  an  affidavit  that  states  the 
debtor's  net  worth  and  states  complete, 
the 
detailed 
debtor's assets and liabilities from which 
net  worth  can  be  ascertained.    An 
affidavit that meets these requirements is 
prima facie evidence of the debtor's net 
worth for the purpose of establishing the 
amount of the bond, deposit, or security 
required  to  suspend  enforcement  of  the 
judgment.  A  trial  court  clerk  must 
receive  and  file  a  net-worth  affidavit 
tendered for filing by a judgment debtor. 

 

(2)  Contest; Discovery. A judgment creditor 
may file a contest to the debtor's claimed 
net  worth.  The  contest  need  not  be 
sworn. 
  The  creditor  may  conduct 
reasonable  discovery  concerning  the 
judgment debtor's net worth. 

3)  Hearing;  Burden  of  Proof;  Findings; 
Additional Security. The trial court must 
hear a judgment creditor's contest of the 
judgment  debtor's  claimed  net  worth 
promptly  after  any  discovery  has  been 
completed. The judgment debtor has the 
burden  of  proving  net  worth.    The  trial 
court must issue an order that states the 
debtor's  net  worth  and  states  with 
particularity  the  factual  basis  for  that 
determination.  If  the  trial  court  orders 
additional or other security to supersede 
the  judgment,  the  enforcement  of  the 
judgment  will  be  suspended  for  twenty 
days  after  the trial  court's order.    If  the

conditions for the surety to honor the bond and for the 
deposit  to  be  paid  to  the  judgment  creditor.  In 
subdivision  24.2,  the  provisions  for  determining  the 
amount  of  the  bond  or  deposit  are  simplified.  All 
provisions  regarding  superseding  a  judgment  for  an 
interest  in  property  are  merged  into  subparagraph 
24.2(a)(2).  The  procedure  for  allowing  security  in  a 
lesser  amount  is  moved  to  paragraph  24.2(b)  and  is 
made applicable to all judgments. Subdivision 24.4 is 
taken  from  former  Rule  49.    The  procedure  for 
appellate review is more precisely stated. 
 

Comment to 2008 change: Subdivision 24.2(c) is 
amended  to  clarify  the  procedure  in  determining  net 
worth.    A  debtor's  affidavit  of  net  worth  must  be 
detailed,  but  the  clerk  must  file  what  is  tendered 
without determining whether it complies with the rule. 
If the trial court orders that additional or other security 
be  given,  the  debtor  is  afforded  time  to  comply.  
Subdivision  24.4(a)  is  revised  to  clarify  that  a  party 
seeking relief from a supersedeas ruling should file a 
motion in the court of appeals that has or presumably 
will have jurisdiction of the appeal. After the court of 
appeals has ruled, a party may seek review by filing a 
petition for writ of mandamus in the Supreme Court.

Rule 25. Perfecting Appeal 

5.1.  Civil Cases 

   

  2

 

(a)  Notice  of  Appeal.  An  appeal  is  perfected 
when a written notice of appeal is filed with 
the  trial  court  clerk.  If  a  notice  of  appeal  is 
mistakenly filed with the appellate court, the 
notice is deemed to have been filed the same 
day  with  the  trial  court  clerk,  and  the 
appellate  clerk  must  immediately  send  the 
trial court clerk a copy of the notice. 

b)  Jurisdiction of Appellate Court.   The filing 
of a notice of appeal by any party invokes the 
appellate court’s jurisdiction over all parties 
to the trial court’s judgment or order appealed 
from.   Any party’s failure to take any other 
step  required  by  these  rules,  including  the 
failure of another party to perfect an appeal 
under (c), does not deprive the appellate court 
of  jurisdiction  but  is  ground  only  for  the 
appellate court to act appropriately, including 
dismissing the appeal. 

c)  Who Must File Notice.  A party who seeks to 

  (

  (

4)  the  determination  whether  to  permit 

suspension of enforcement; and 

5)  the  trial  court's  exercise  of  discretion 

under Rule 24.3(a). 

(b)  Grounds  of  Review.  Review  may  be  based 
both on conditions as they existed at the time 
the trial court signed an order and on changes 
in those conditions afterward. 

c)  Temporary Orders.  The appellate court may 
issue  any  temporary  orders  necessary  to 
preserve the parties’ rights. 

d)  Action by Appellate Court.   The motion must 
be heard at the earliest practicable time. The 
appellate court may require that the amount 
of  a  bond,  deposit,  or  other  security  be 
increased  or  decreased,  and  that  another 
bond,  deposit,  or  security  be  provided  and 
approved  by  the  trial  court  clerk.  The 
appellate court may require other changes in 
the trial court order. The appellate court may 
remand to the trial court for entry of findings 
of fact or for the taking of evidence. 
 

If 

(e)  Effect of Ruling.  If    the    appellate    court  
orders  additional    or      other    security    to

court’s  order.

any additional bond, deposit, or security has

Comment to 1997 change: Former Rules 47, 48, 
and 49 are merged. The rule is substantially revised. 
Paragraph  24.1(a)  now  provides  for  superseding  the 
judgment  by  agreement.  Paragraph  24.1(c)  is  taken 
from former Rule 48 and provides for a deposit in lieu 
of  the  bond,  including  specific  provisions  for  the

(e)  Notice of Notice. The notice of appeal must 
be served on all parties to the trial court's final 
judgment or, in an interlocutory appeal, on all 
parties  to  the  trial  court  proceeding.  At  or 
before  the  time  of  the  notice  of  appeal’s 
filing,  the  filing  party  must  also  deliver  a 
copy  of  the  notice  of  appeal  to  each  court

clerk   must immediately deliver a copy of the 
notice of appeal to the appellate court clerk,

responsible  for  preparing 
the  reporter’s 
record. 

g)  Amending the Notice. An amended notice of 
appeal correcting a defect or omission in an 
earlier  filed  notice  may  be  filed  in  the 
appellate  court  at  any  time  before  the 
appellant's brief is filed. The amended notice 
is  subject  to  being  struck  for  cause  on  the 
motion of any party affected by the amended 
notice. After the appellant's brief is filed, the 
notice may be amended only on leave of the 
appellate court and on such terms as the court 
may prescribe. 
 

(h)  Enforcement of Judgment Not Suspended by 
Appeal. The filing of a notice of appeal does 
not  suspend  enforcement  of  the  judgment. 
Enforcement  of  the  judgment  may  proceed

notice that the defendant has been informed 
of his rights concerning an appeal, as well as 
any  right  to  file  a  pro  se  petition  for 
discretionary review.   This notification shall 
be  signed  by  the  defendant,    with    a    copy  
given  to  him.  The certification should be 
part  of  the  record  when  notice  is  filed,  but

amended  notice  of  appeal  or  trial  court’s 
certification  of  the  defendant’s  right  of 
appeal correcting a defect or omission in an 
earlier filed notice or certification, including 
a defect in the notification of the defendant’s 
appellate rights, may be filed in the appellate 
court in accordance with Rule 37.1, or at any 
time before the appealing party's brief is filed 
if the court of appeals has not used Rule 37.1. 
The amended notice or certification is subject 
to being struck for cause on the motion of any 
party  affected  by  the  amended  notice  or 
certification. After the appealing party’s brief 
is  filed,  the  notice  or  certification  may  be 
amended only on leave of the appellate court 
and on such terms as the court may prescribe. 
 

(g)  Effect  of  Appeal.  Once  the  record  has  been

2)  Of  the  Defendant.    A  defendant  in  a 
criminal  case  has  the  right  of  appeal 
under  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure 
article  44.02  and  these  rules.  The  trial 
court  shall  enter  a  certification  of  the 
defendant’s right of appeal each time it 
enters  a  judgment  of  guilt  or  other 
appealable order. In a plea bargain case 
– that is, a case in which a defendant’s 
plea  was  guilty  or  nolo  contendere  and 
the  punishment  did  not  exceed  the

case  it  is  unnecessary  to  file  a  notice  of 
appeal, but, in every death-penalty case, the 
clerk  of  the  trial  court  shall  file  a  notice  of 
conviction  with 
the  Court  of  Criminal 
Appeals within thirty days after the defendant 
is sentenced to death. 
 

(c)  Form and Sufficiency of Notice. 

1)  Notice must be given in writing and filed 
with the trial court clerk.  If the notice of 
appeal is received in the court of appeals, 
the clerk of that court shall immediately 
record on the notice the date that it was 
received and send the notice to the trial 
court clerk. 

2)  Notice is sufficient if it shows the party's 
desire  to  appeal  from  the  judgment  or 
other appealable order, and, if the State 
is the appellant, the notice complies with 
Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  article 
44.01.

Notes and Comments 

Comment  on  1997  change:  This  is  former  Rule 
40. In civil cases, the requirement of an appeal bond is 
repealed.  Appeal  is  perfected  by  filing  a  notice  of 
appeal. A notice must be filed by any party seeking to 
alter the trial court’s judgment.  The restricted appeal 
— formerly the appeal by writ of error — is perfected 
by filing a notice of appeal in the trial court as in other 
appeals.  The  contents  of  the  notice  of  appeal  is 
prescribed.  The  notice  of  limitation  of  appeal  is 
repealed.  In  criminal  cases,  the  rule  is  amended  to 
apply to notices by the State, and to refer to additional 
statutory requirements for the State’s notice. In felony 
cases  in  which  the  defendant  waived  trial  by  jury, 
pleaded  guilty  or  nolo  contendere,  and  received  a 
punishment  that  did  not  exceed  what  the  defendant 
agreed  to  in  a  plea  bargain,  the  rule  is  amended  to 
make  clear  that  regardless  of  when  the  alleged  error 
occurred, an appeal must be based on a jurisdictional 
defect or a written motion ruled on before trial, or be 
with the permission of the trial court. 
 

Comment to 2002 change: Rule 25.2, for criminal 
cases,  is  amended.      Subdivision  25.2(a)  states  the 
parties’ rights of appeal that are established by Code 
of  Criminal  Procedure  article  44.01  and  by  article 
44.02,  the  proviso  of  which  was  repealed  when 
rulemaking power was given to the Court of Criminal 
Appeals.  Subdivision 25.2(b) is given the requirement 
that a notice of appeal be in “sufficient” form, which 
codifies the decisional  law.     The  requirement  in  
former  subdivision 25.2(b)(3) that a plea-bargaining 
appellant’s notice of appeal specify the right of appeal 
is  replaced  by  a  requirement  in  subdivision  25.2(d) 
that  the  trial  court  certify  the  defendant’s  right  of 
appeal  in  every  case  in  which  a  judgment  or  other 
appealable order is entered. The certificate should be 
signed  at  the  time  the  judgment  or  other  appealable 
order is pronounced. The form of certification of the 
defendant’s right of appeal is provided in an appendix 
to these rules.  If the record does not include the trial 
court’s certification that the defendant has the right of 
appeal, the appeal must be dismissed.  If a sufficient 
notice  of  appeal  or  certification  is  not  filed  after  the 
appellate court deals with the defect (see Rules 34.5(c) 
and  37.1),  preparation  of  an  appellate  record  and

7.3.  If Appealed Order Modified or Vacated 

After an order or judgment in a civil case has been 
appealed,  if  the  trial  court  modifies  the  order  or 
judgment,  or  if  the  trial  court  vacates  the  order  or 
judgment and replaces it with another appealable order 
or judgment, the appellate court must treat the appeal 
as  from  the  subsequent  order  or  judgment  and  may 
treat actions relating to the appeal of the first order or 
judgment  as  relating  to  the appeal of  the  subsequent 
order or judgment. The subsequent order or judgment 
and  actions  relating  to  it  may  be  included  in  the 
original  or  supplemental  record.  Any  party  may 
nonetheless  appeal  from  the  subsequent  order  or 
judgment. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change:   This rule is new and 
combines the provisions of former Rules 41(c) and 58. 

Rule 28. Accelerated, Agreed, and Permissive 
Appeals in Civil Cases 

8.1.  Accelerated Appeals

  quo 

(a)  Types of Accelerated Appeals. Appeals from 
interlocutory    orders    (when    allowed    by  
  warranto  
in 
statute),  appeals 
proceedings,    appeals  required  by  statute  to 
be  accelerated  or  expedited,  and  appeals 
required by law to be filed or perfected within 
less than 30 days after the date of the order or 
judgment  being  appealed  are  accelerated 
appeals. 
 

(b)  Perfection  of  Accelerated  Appeal.  Unless 
otherwise provided by statute, an accelerated 
appeal is perfected by filing a notice of appeal 
in compliance with Rule 25.1 within the time 
allowed  by  Rule  26.1(b)  or  as  extended  by 
Rule 26.3. Filing a motion for new trial, any 
other  post-trial  motion,  or  a  request  for 
findings  of  fact  will  not  extend  the  time  to 
perfect an accelerated appeal. 

c)  Appeals of  Interlocutory  Orders.      The  trial 
court  need  not  file  findings  of  fact  and 
conclusions of law but may do so within 30 
days after the order is signed. 

d)  Quo Warranto Appeals. The trial court may 
grant a motion for new trial timely filed under

files in the appellate court a motion 
complying with Rule 10.5(b). 

Notes and Comments 

(b)  By  the State.  The  notice of appeal  must  be 
filed  within  20  days  after  the  day  the  trial 
court enters the order, ruling, or sentence to 
be appealed. 

6.3.  Extension of Time 

The  appellate  court  may  extend  the  time  to 
file  the  notice  of  appeal  if,  within  15  days  after  the 
deadline for filing the notice of appeal, the party: 
 

files  in  the  trial  court  the  notice  of 
appeal; and

Comment to 1997 change: This is former Rule 41. 
All  times  for  perfecting  appeal  in  civil  cases  — 
including the time for perfecting a restricted appeal — 
are  stated.  An  extension  of  time  is  available  for  all 
appeals.  The  provisions  of  former  Rule  41(c) 
regarding prematurely filed documents are moved to 
Rule 27.  Nonsubstantive changes are made in the rule 
for criminal cases. 

Rule 27. Premature Filings 

7.1.  Prematurely Filed Notice of Appeal 

(a)  Civil  Cases.  In  a  civil  case,  a  prematurely 
filed notice of appeal is effective and deemed 
filed on  the day of,  but  after,  the  event  that 
begins the period for perfecting the appeal. 
 

(b)  Criminal  Cases.  In  a  criminal  case,  a 
prematurely filed notice of appeal is effective 
and deemed filed on the same day, but after, 
sentence  is  imposed  or  suspended  in  open 
court, or the appealable order is signed by the 
trial  court.  But  a  notice  of  appeal  is  not 
effective if filed before the trial court makes 
a finding of guilt or receives a jury verdict. 

7.2.  Other Premature Actions 

The appellate court may treat actions taken before 
an appealable order is signed as relating to an appeal 
of that order and give them effect as if they had been 
taken after the order was signed. The appellate court 
may  allow  an  appealed  order  that  is  not  final  to  be 
modified  so  as  to  be  made  final  and  may  allow  the 
modified order and all proceedings relating to it to be

5)  a statement that all parties to the trial 
court  proceeding    agreed    that    the  
order  granting permission to appeal 
involves  a  controlling  question    of  
law    as    to    which    there    is    a 
substantial ground for difference of 
opinion; 

6)  a  brief  statement  of  the  issues  or 

points presented; and 

7)  a  concise  explanation  of  how  an 
immediate  appeal  may  materially 
advance the ultimate termination of 
the litigation. 

  (

  (

  (

 

(d)  Determination of Jurisdiction. If the court of 
appeals  determines  that  a  notice  of  appeal 
filed under this rule does not demonstrate the 
court's jurisdiction, it may order the appellant 
to  file  an  amended  notice  of  appeal.  On  a 
party's motion or its own initiative, the court 
of appeals may also order the appellant or any 
other  party 
to  file  briefing  addressing 
whether  the  appeal  meets  the  statutory 
requirements,  and  may  direct  the  parties  to 
file  supporting  evidence.  If,  after  providing 
an opportunity  to  file  an  amended  notice of 
appeal  or  briefing  addressing  potential 
jurisdictional  defects,  the  court  of  appeals 
concludes that a jurisdictional defect exists, it 
may  dismiss 
for  want  of 
the  appeal 
jurisdiction at any stage of the appeal. 
 

(e)  Record; Briefs. The rules governing the filing 
of 
in 
the  appellate  record  and  briefs 
accelerated  appeals  apply.    A  party  may 
address  in  its brief  any  issues  related  to  the 
including 
court  of  appeals' 
whether  the  appeal  meets  the  statutory 
requirements. 

jurisdiction, 

f)  No  Automatic  Stay  of  Proceedings  in  Trial 
Court. An agreed appeal of an interlocutory 
order  permitted  by  statute  does  not  stay 
proceedings in the trial court except as agreed 
by the parties and ordered by the trial court or 
the court of appeals. 

8.3.  Permissive Appeals in Civil Cases. 

(a)  Petition  Required.  When  a  trial  court  has 
permitted  an  appeal  from  an  interlocutory 
order that would not otherwise be appealable, 
a  party  seeking  to  appeal  must  petition  the 

Texas  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  329b(a)–(b) 
until  50  days  after  the  trial  court's  final 
judgment  is  signed.      If  not  determined  by 
signed  written  order  within  that  period,  the 
motion  will  be  deemed  overruled  by 
operation of law on expiration of that period. 

e)  Record  and  Briefs.  In  lieu  of  the  clerk's 
record,  the  appellate  court  may  hear  an 
accelerated  appeal  on  the  original  papers 
forwarded by the trial court or on sworn and 
uncontroverted  copies  of  those  papers.  The  
appellate  court  may  allow  the  case  to  be 
submitted  without  briefs. The deadlines and 
procedures for filing the record and briefs in 
an  accelerated  appeal  are provided  in  Rules 
35.1 and 38.6. 

8.2.  Agreed Interlocutory Appeals in Civil Cases 

(a)  Perfecting  Appeal.  An  agreed  appeal  of  an 
interlocutory order permitted by statute must 
be perfected as provided in Rule 25.1.  The 
notice  of  appeal  must  be  filed  no  later  than 
the 20th day after the date the trial court signs 
a written order granting permission to appeal, 
unless the court of appeals extends the time 
for filing pursuant to Rule 26.3. 

b)  Other Requirements. In addition to perfecting 
appeal, the appellant must file with the clerk 
of the appellate court a docketing statement 
as provided in Rule 32.1 and pay to the clerk 
of  the  appellate  court  all  required  fees 
authorized to be collected by the clerk. 
 

(c)  Contents of Notice. The notice of accelerated 
appeal must contain, in addition to the items 
required by Rule 25.1(d), the following:

appeals  may  extend  the  time  to  file  a 
response, reply, and cross-petition. 

g)  Length of Petition, Cross-Petition, Response, 
and  Reply.  A  petition,  cross-petition, 
response, and reply must   comply   with   the   
length   limitations   in Rule 9.4(i)(2)(D)-(E). 

h)  Service.   A petition, cross-petition, response, 
and reply must be served on all parties to the 
trial court proceeding. 

i)  Docketing  Statement.

appeals orders otherwise, a petition, and any 
cross-petition,  response,  and  reply,  will  be 
determined without oral argument, no earlier 
than 10 days after the petition is filed. 
 

(k)  When  Petition  Granted.  If  the  petition  is 
granted, a notice of appeal is deemed to have 
been  filed  under  Rule  26.1(b)  on  that  date, 
and  the  appeal  is  governed  by  the  rules  for 
accelerated  appeals.    A  separate  notice  of 
appeal need not be filed.  A copy of the order 
granting  the  petition  must  be  filed  with  the 
trial court clerk.

Procedure  168,  which  governs  the  procedure  for 
obtaining permission to appeal from the trial court. 
 

New Rule 283 applies only to appeals in cases that 
were filed in the trial court on or after September 1, 
2011. Rule 28.2 applies only to appeals in cases that 
were filed in the trial court before September 1, 2011. 
 

Rule of Civil Procedure 168 clarifies that the trial 
court’s permission to appeal should be included in the 
order  to  be  appealed  rather  than  in  a  separate  order.   
As stated in Rule 28.3(c), if a prior order containing 
the  trial  court’s  ruling  is  amended  to  include  such 
permission, the time for appeal runs from the amended 
order. Rule 28.3(k) further clarifies that if the petition 
is granted, appeal is thereby perfected, and the appeal 
proceeds as an accelerated appeal, with all deadlines - 
including deadlines and obligations for preparing the 
record - running from the date the petition was granted.  
A  separate  notice  of  appeal  need  not  be  filed.      The 
petition  procedure  in  Rule  28.3  is  intended  to  be 
similar to the Rule 53 procedure governing petitions 
for review in the Supreme Court. 
 

Rule 29. Orders Pending Interlocutory Appeal in 
Civil Cases 

9.1.  Effect of Appeal 

Perfecting  an  appeal  from  an  order  granting 
interlocutory  relief  does  not  suspend  the  order 
appealed from unless: 

(a)  the  order  is  superseded  in  accordance  with 

b)  the  appellant  is  entitled  to  supersede  the  
order  without  security  by  filing  a  notice  of 
appeal. 

 

29.2; or 

  (

9.2.  Security 

The  trial  court  may  permit  an  order  granting 
interlocutory relief to be superseded pending an appeal 
from  the  order,  in  which  event  the  appellant  may 
supersede the order in accordance with Rule 24. If the 
trial court refuses to permit the appellant to supersede 
the order, the appellant may move the appellate court 
to review that decision for abuse of discretion. 

9.3.  Temporary Orders of Appellate Court 

When  an  appeal  from  an  interlocutory  order  is 
perfected, 
the  appellate  court  may  make  any 
temporary  orders  necessary  to  preserve  the  parties' 
rights until disposition of the appeal and may require

1)  Responsibility 

for  Preparation 

of 
Reporter’s Record. In  addition  to  the  
responsibility imposed on the trial court 
in  Rule  35.3(c),  when  the  reporter’s 
responsibility  to  prepare,  certify  and 
timely  file  the  reporter’s  record  arises 
under Rule 35.3(b), the trial court must 
direct  the  official  or  deputy  reporter  to 
immediately  commence  the  preparation 
of  the  reporter’s  record.  The  trial  court 
must arrange for a substitute reporter, if 
necessary. 

2)  Extension of Time.  The appellate court 
may grant an extension of time to file a 
record under Rule 35.3(c); however, the 
extension or extensions granted must not 
exceed  30  days  cumulatively,  absent 
extraordinary circumstances. 

 

(3)  Restriction on Preparation Inapplicable. 
Section  13.003  of  the  Civil  Practice  & 
Remedies  Code  does  not  apply  to  an 
appeal  from  a  parental  termination  or 
child protection case.

(b)  Appellate Record. 

(c)  Remand for New Trial.   If the judgment of 
the  appellate  court  reverses  and  remands  a 
parental termination or child protection case 
for a new trial, the judgment must instruct the 
trial court to commence the new trial no later 
than 180 days after the mandate is issued by 
the appellate court. 

Notes and Comments 
 

Comment to 2011 Change: Section 51.014(d)-(f) 
of  the  Texas  Civil  Practice  and  Remedies  Code,  as 
amended in 2011, provides for appeals of orders not 
otherwise  appealable  when  permitted  by  the  trial 
court.  The 2011 amendments, which explicitly apply 
only  to  cases  commenced  on  or  after  September  1, 
2011, eliminated the prior requirement that the parties 
agree to the appeal and reinstated a requirement that 
the court of appeals also permit the appeal.  Act of May 
25,  2011,  82nd  Leg.,  R.S.,  ch.  203,  §§  3.01,  6.01

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: This is former Rule 43. 
The provision in the former rule that an appeal from 
an  order  certifying  a  class  suspends  the  order  is 
repealed. The provision in the former rule that an order 
denying  interlocutory  relief  cannot  be  suspended  is 
omitted as unnecessary because the rule provides for 
superseding only orders granting relief. No substantive 
change  is  intended.    The  provision  in  former  Rule 
43(d) prohibiting the trial court from making an order 
granting  substantially  the  same  relief  as  the  order 
appealed  is  repealed  as  being  too  broad.  The 
provisions of former Rule 43(g) regarding the mandate 
are  moved  to  Rule  18.6  and  18.7.  The  provision  of 
former  Rule  43(h)  regarding  rehearings  is  moved  to 
Rule 49.4. 
 

Comment to 2002 change: Rule 29.5 is amended 
to acknowledge that a trial court may be prohibited by 
law from proceeding to trial during the pendency of an 
interlocutory  appeal,  as  for  example  by  section 
51.014(b)  of  the  Texas  Civil  Practice  and  Remedies 
Code. 
 

Comment to 2008 change: Rule 29.5 is amended 
to  be  consistent  with  Section  51.014(b)  of  the  Civil 
Practice  and  Remedies  Code,  as  amended  in  2003, 
staying  all  proceedings  in  the  trial  court  pending 
resolution  of 
class 
certification  orders,  denials  of  summary  judgments 
based  on  assertions  of  immunity  by  governmental 
officers or employees, and orders granting or denying 
a governmental unit’s plea to the jurisdiction.

ule 30. Restricted Appeals to Court of Appeals in 
Civil Cases 

A party who did not participate—either in person 
or through counsel—in the hearing that resulted in the 
judgment complained of and who did not timely file a 
postjudgment  motion  or  request  for  findings  of  fact 
and  conclusions  of  law, or  a notice  of  appeal  within 
the time permitted by Rule 26.1(a), may file a notice 
of appeal within the time permitted by Rule 26.1(c). 
Restricted appeals replace writ of error appeals to the 
court  of  appeals.  Statutes  pertaining  to  writ  of  error 
appeals  to  the  court  of  appeals  apply  equally  to 
restricted appeals.

suspend the trial court's order if the appellant's rights 
would  be  adequately  protected  by  supersedeas  or 
another order made under Rule 24. 

 

 

9.4.  Enforcement of Temporary Orders 

While  an  appeal  from  an  interlocutory  order  is 
pending, only the appellate court in which the appeal 
is  pending  may  enforce  the  order.  But  the  appellate 
court  may  refer  any  enforcement  proceeding  to  the 
trial court with instructions to: 
 

(a)  hear evidence and grant appropriate relief; or 

b)  make  findings  and  recommendations  and 

report them to the appellate court. 

9.5.  Further Proceedings in Trial Court 

While  an  appeal  from  an  interlocutory  order  is 
pending, the trial court retains jurisdiction of the case 
and  unless  prohibited  by  statute  may  make  further 
orders, including one dissolving the order complained 
of on appeal.  If permitted by law, the trial court may 
proceed with a trial on the merits.  But the court must 
not make an order that: 
 

(a)  is  inconsistent  with  any  appellate  court 

temporary order; or 

b)  interferes with or impairs the jurisdiction of 
the  appellate  court  or  effectiveness  of  any 
relief  sought  or  that  may  be  granted  on 
appeal.

the  same  subject

the case without briefing, if necessary to do 
substantial justice to the parties.

1.3.  Orders on Appeal 

The  appellate  court  will 

render  whatever 
judgment and make whatever orders the law and the 
nature  of  the  case  require.  The  court  may  make  an 
appropriate  order  relating  to  costs,  whether  allowing

(a)  When  Motion  for  Stay  Required.  Despite 
Rule  18  or  any  other  of  these  rules,  in  the 
following circumstances a party who in good 
faith  intends  to  seek  discretionary  review 
must  —  within  15  days  after  the  court  of 
appeals  renders  judgment  —  file  with  the 
court  of  appeals  clerk  a  motion  for  stay  of 
mandate,  to  which  is  appended  the  party's 
petition  for  discretionary  review  showing 
reasons why  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals 
should review the appellate court judgment: 

1)  when  a  court  of  appeals  affirms  the 
judgment  of 
in  an 
the 
extradition matter and thereby sanctions 
a defendant's extradition; or 

trial  court 

2)  when  a  court  of  appeals  reverses  the  
trial court’s judgment in a bail matter — 
including  bail  pending  appeal  under 
Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  article 
44.04(g)  —  and 
thereby  grants  or 
reduces the amount of bail. 

(b)  Determination of the Motion.  The clerk must 
promptly submit the motion and appendix to 
the court of appeals, or to one or more judges 
as the court deems appropriate, for immediate 
consideration and determination. 

1)  If the motion for stay is granted, the clerk 
will immediately forward the petition for

called  a  restricted  appeal  —  is  substituted.  This  rule 
sets out who may take a restricted appeal. Rules 25.1 
and 26.1 set out the method of perfection and the time 
for perfecting the appeal.

Extradition Proceedings in Criminal Cases 

1.1.  Filing the Record and Briefs 

hen  written  notice  of  appeal  from  a  judgment  or 
order in a habeas corpus or bail proceeding is filed, the 
trial  court  clerk  must  prepare  and  certify  the  clerk’s 
record and, if the appellant requests, the court reporter 
must prepare and certify a reporter’s record.  The clerk 
must  send  the  clerk’s  record  and  the  court  reporter 
must send the reporter’s record to the appellate court 
within 15 days after the notice of appeal is filed.  On 
reasonable  explanation,  the  appellate  court  may 
shorten or extend the time to file the records.

(c)  Denial of Stay. If the motion for stay is denied 
under  31.4(b)(2),  the  losing  party  may  then

of  the  Court of  Criminal Appeals, who will 
promptly submit them to the Court, or to one 
or  more 
the  Court  deems 
appropriate, for immediate consideration and 
determination.  The  Court  of  Criminal 
Appeals may deny the motion or stay or recall 
the  mandate.  If  the  mandate  is  stayed  or 
recalled, the clerk of the Court of  Criminal  
Appeals    will    file    the    petition    for 
discretionary  review  and  process  the  case  
in accordance with Rule 68.7. 

1.5.  Judgment Conclusive 

The  court  of  appeals'  judgment  is  final  and 
conclusive if the Court of Criminal Appeals does not 
grant  discretionary  review.  If  the  Court  of  Criminal 
Appeals  grants  discretionary  review,  that  court's 
judgment  is  final  and  conclusive.  In  either  case,  no 
further application in the same case can be made for 
the writ unless the law provides otherwise. 

1.6.  Defendant Detained by Other Than Officer 

If the defendant is held by a person other than an 
officer,  the  sheriff  receiving  the  appellate  court 
mandate  so  ordering  must  immediately  cause  the 
defendant  to  be  discharged,  for  which  discharge  the 
mandate is sufficient authority. 

1.7.  Judgment to be Certified 

The  appellate  court  clerk  will  certify  the  court's 
judgment  to  the  officer  holding  the  defendant  in 
custody or, if the defendant is held by a person other 
than an officer, to the appropriate sheriff. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: This is former Rule 44. 
Since  the  purpose  of  the  appeal  is  to  do  substantial 
justice, it is extended to both parties in recognition that 
both  parties  now  have  the  right  to  appeal.  Other 
nonsubstantive changes are made.

the  overruling  by  operation  of  law  of  a 
motion for new trial or a motion to modify the 
judgment  preserves  for  appellate  review  a 
complaint  properly  made  in  the  motion, 
unless  taking  evidence  was  necessary  to 
properly  present  the  complaint  in  the  trial 
court. 
 

(c)  Formal  Exception  and  Separate  Order  Not 
Required.  Neither  a  formal  exception  to  a 
trial  court  ruling  or  order  nor  a  signed, 
separate  order  is  required  to  preserve  a 
complaint for appeal. 

d)  Sufficiency  of  Evidence  Complaints  in  Civil 
Nonjury  Cases.  In  a  civil  nonjury  case,  a 
complaint  regarding  the  legal  or  factual 
insufficiency  of  the  evidence  -  including  a 
complaint  that  the  damages  found  by  the 
court  are  excessive  or 
inadequate,  as 
distinguished from a complaint that the trial 
court erred in refusing to amend a fact finding 
or to make an additional finding of fact - may 
be  made  for  the  first  time  on  appeal  in  the 
complaining party’s brief. 

To complain on appeal about a matter that would 
not otherwise appear in the record, a party must file a 
formal bill of exception. 
 

(a)  Form.  No  particular  form  of  words  is 
required  in  a  bill  of  exception.  But  the 
objection to the court's ruling or action, and 
the ruling complained of, must be stated with 
sufficient  specificity  to  make  the  trial  court 
aware of the complaint. 

3.2.  Formal Bills of Exception

b)  Evidence. When the appellate record contains 
the  evidence  needed  to  explain  a  bill  of 
exception,  the bill  itself  need  not repeat  the 
evidence,  and  a  party  may  attach  and 
incorporate  a  transcription  of  the  evidence 
certified by the court reporter. 

1)  The complaining party must first present 
a  formal  bill  of  exception  to  the  trial 
court. 

2)  If the parties agree on the contents of the 
bill of exception, the judge must sign the 
bill and file it with the trial court clerk. If 
the parties do not agree on the contents

Subdivision  33.1  is  rewritten.    Former  Rule  52(b), 
regarding  offers  of  proof,  is  omitted  as  unnecessary.  
See TEX. R. CIV. EVID. 103; TEX. R. CRIM. EVID. 
103.    Subdivision  33.2  is  also  rewritten  and  the 
procedure  is  more  definitely  stated.  Former  Rule 
52(d), regarding motions for  new trial, is  omitted as 
unnecessary. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 324(a) & (b). 
 

Comment  to  2002  change:  The  last  sentence  of 
former Rule 52(d) of the Rules of Appellate Procedure 
has been reinstated in substance. 

Rule 34. Appellate Record 

4.1.  Contents 

The appellate record consists of the clerk’s record 
and, if necessary to the appeal, the reporter’s record. 
Even if more than one notice of appeal is filed, there 
should be only one appellate record in a case. 

4.2.  Agreed Record 

By  written  stipulation  filed  with  the  trial  court 
clerk,  the  parties  may  agree  on  the  contents  of  the 
appellate record. An agreed record will be presumed 
to  contain  all  evidence  and  filings  relevant  to  the 
appeal. To request matter to be included in the agreed

of the bill, the trial judge must — after 
notice  and  hearing  —  do  one  of  the 
following things: 

(A)  sign the bill of exception and file it 
with the trial court clerk if the judge 
finds that it is correct; 
 

it  accurately 

(B)  suggest  to  the  complaining  party 
those corrections to the bill that the 
judge  believes  are  necessary  to 
make 
the 
proceedings in the trial court, and if 
the  party  agrees  to  the  corrections, 
have the corrections made, sign the 
bill,  and  file  it  with  the  trial  court 
clerk; or 

reflect 

C)  if  the  complaining  party  will  not 
agree  to  the  corrections  suggested 
by  the  judge,  return  the  bill  to  the 
complaining  party  with  the  judge's 
refusal  written  on  it,  and  prepare, 
sign,  and  file  with  the  trial  court 
clerk such bill as will, in the judge's 
opinion,  accurately      reflect        the 
proceedings in the trial court. 

  (

3)  If  the  complaining  party  is  dissatisfied 
with  the  bill  of  exception  filed  by  the 
judge  under  (2)(C),  the  party  may  file 
with the trial court clerk the bill that was 
rejected  by  the  judge.  That  party  must 
also  file  the  affidavits  of  at  least  three 
people who observed the matter to which 
the  bill  of  exception  is  addressed.  The 
affidavits  must  attest  to  the  correctness 
of the bill as presented by the party. The 
matters  contained 
that  bill  of 
exception  may  be  controverted  and 
maintained by additional affidavits filed 
by  any  party  within  ten  days  after  the 
filing of that bill. The truth of the bill of 
exception  will  be  determined  by  the 
appellate court.

(d)  Conflict.  If  a  formal  bill  of  exception 
conflicts  with  the  reporter’s  record,  the  bill

e)  Time to file.

designates  to  have  included  in  the 
record. 

(b)  Request for Additional Items. 

1)  Time for Request. At any  time  before 
the clerk’s record is prepared, any party 
may  file  with  the  trial  court  clerk  a 
written  designation  specifying  items  to 
be included in the record. 

2)  Request  Must  be  Specific.  A  party 
requesting that an item be included in the 
clerk’s record must specifically describe 
the  item  so  that  the  clerk  can  readily 
identify  it.  The  clerk  will  disregard  a 
general designation, such as one for “all 
papers filed in the case.” 

3)  Requesting Unnecessary Items. In a civil 
case, if a party requests that more items 
than necessary be included in the clerk’s 
record or any supplement, the appellate 
court  may  —  regardless  of  the  appeal's 
outcome — require that party to pay the

because  of  a  failure  to  timely  request 
items to be included in the clerk’s record. 

(c)  Supplementation. 

1)  If a relevant item has been omitted from 
the  clerk’s  record,  the  trial  court,  the 
appellate  court,  or  any  party  may  by

Rules 34.5 and 34.6. 

4.3.  Agreed Statement of the Case 

In lieu of a reporter’s record, the parties may agree 
on a brief statement of the case. The statement must be 
filed  with  the  trial  court  clerk  and  included  in  the 
appellate record. 

4.4.  Form. 

The  Supreme  Court  and  Court  of  Criminal 
Appeals  will  prescribe  the  form  of  the  appellate 
record. 

4.5.  Clerk’s Record

filings  in  the  appellate  record  by  agreement 
under  Rule  34.2,  the  record  must  include 
copies of the following: 

1)  in civil cases, all pleadings on which the 

trial was held; 

2)  in  criminal  cases,  the  indictment  or 
information, any special plea or defense 
motion  that  was  presented  to  the  court 
and  overruled,  any  written  waiver,  any 
written  stipulation,  and,  in  cases  in 
which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere 
has  been  entered,  any  documents 
executed for the plea;

conclusions  of  law,  any  post-judgment 
motion,  and  the  court's  order  on  the 
motion; 

7)  the notice of appeal; 

8)  any formal bill of exception;

certified  copies of  the  logs prepared by 
the court recorder under Rule 13.2. 

1)  Request to Court Reporter. At or before 
the  time  for  perfecting  the  appeal,  the 
appellant must request in writing that the 
official  reporter  prepare  the  reporter’s 
record.  The  request  must  designate  the 
exhibits to be included. A request to the 
court  reporter  —  but  not  the  court 
recorder  —  must  also  designate  the 
portions  of

the request with the trial court clerk. 

3)  Failure to Timely Request. An appellate 
court must not refuse to file a reporter’s 
record  or  a  supplemental  reporter’s 
record  because  of  a  failure  to  timely 
request it. 

(c)  Partial Reporter’s Record.

(d)  Defects or Inaccuracies. If the clerk’s record 
is defective or inaccurate, the appellate clerk 
must inform the trial court clerk of the defect 
or inaccuracy and instruct the clerk to make 
the correction. 

e)  Clerk’s  Record  Lost  or  Destroyed.  If  a  
filing designated for inclusion in the clerk’s 
record has been lost or destroyed, the parties 
may, by written stipulation, deliver a copy of 
that item to the trial court clerk for inclusion 
in the clerk’s record or a supplement. If the 
parties cannot agree, the trial court must — 
on  any  party's  motion  or  at  the  appellate 
court's request — determine what constitutes 
an  accurate  copy  of  the  missing  item  and 
order it to be included in the clerk’s record or 
a supplement. 

f)  Original  Documents.  If 

the 

trial  court 
determines that original documents filed with 
the trial court clerk should be inspected by the 
appellate court or sent to that court in lieu of 
copies, the trial court must make an order for 
the safekeeping, transportation, and return of 
those original documents. The order must list 
the  original  documents  and  briefly  describe 
them. All the documents must be arranged in 
their  listed  sequence  and  bound  firmly 
together.  On  any  party's  motion  or  its  own 
initiative, the appellate court may direct the 
trial  court  clerk  to  send  it  any  original 
document. 

g)  Additional  Copies  of  Clerk’s  Record  in 
Criminal  Cases.  In  a  criminal  case,  the 
clerk’s record must be made in duplicate, and 
in  a  case  in  which  the  death  penalty  was 
assessed,  in  triplicate.    The  trial  court  clerk 
must retain the copy or copies for the parties

and  the  exhibits  are  accurate,  the  trial 
court  must  –  after  notice  and  hearing –

inaccuracy,  it  must  order  the  court 
reporter to conform the reporter’s record 
(including text and any exhibits) to what 
occurred  in  the  trial  court,  and  to  file 
certified  corrections  in  the  appellate 
court. 

3)  Correction  After  Filing  in  Appellate 
Court.  If  the  dispute  arises  after  the 
reporter’s  record  has  been  filed  in  the 
appellate  court,  that  court  may  submit

(f)  Reporter’s  Record  Lost  or  Destroyed.  An 
appellant is entitled to a new trial under the 
following circumstances: 

1)  if   the   appellant   has   timely   requested  

a reporter’s record; 

2)  if,  without 

the  appellant's  fault,  a 
significant  exhibit  or  a  significant 
portion of the court reporter's notes and 
records has been lost or destroyed or – if 
the  proceedings  were  electronically 
recorded  –  a  significant  portion  of  the 
recording has been lost or destroyed or is 
inaudible; 

3)  if  the  lost,  destroyed,  or  inaudible 
portion  of  the  reporter’s  record,  or  the 
lost or destroyed exhibit, is necessary to 
the appeal's resolution; and 

4)  if the lost, destroyed or inaudible portion 

of  the  reporter's      record      cannot      be   
replaced   by agreement of the parties, or 
the  lost  or  destroyed  exhibit  cannot  be 
replaced  either  by  agreement  of  the 
parties or with a copy determined by the 
trial  court  to  accurately  duplicate  with 
reasonable certainty the original exhibit.

testimony to be included in the reporter’s 
record. 
 

(3)  Costs;  Requesting 

Unnecessary 
Matter.  Additions  requested  by  another 
party must be included in the reporter’s 
record at the appellant's cost. But if the 
trial  court  finds  that  all  or  part  of  the 
designated additions are unnecessary to 
the appeal, the trial court may order the 
other  party  to  pay  the  costs  for  the 
preparation of the unnecessary additions. 
This  paragraph  does  not  affect  the 
appellate  court's  power  to  tax  costs 
differently.

and 

Comment  to  2002  change:  Rule  34.5(a)  is 
amended to require that the record in a criminal case 
include the certification of defendant's right of appeal; 
see  Rule  25.2(d).  Rule  34.5(c)  is  amended  to  make 
clear that an appellate court may order the trial court 
to  make  such  a  certification  for  inclusion  in  a 
supplemental  clerk's  record.    Subparagraphs  34.6(e) 
and  (f)  are  amended  to  clarify  the  application  to 
exhibits.  The 
in  subparagraph  (e)(2) 
referring to the text of the record is simplified without 
substantive change.   Subparagraph (e)(3) incorporates 
the  procedures  specified  in  (e)(2).  The  language  in 
subparagraph (f) is clarified to require agreement only 
as to the portion of the text at issue, and to provide that 
the trial court may determine that a copy of an exhibit 
should be used even if the parties cannot agree.

may extend the deadline to file the record if 
requested  by  the  clerk  or  reporter.    Each 
extension  must  not  exceed  30  days  in  an 
ordinary or restricted appeal, or 10 days in an 
accelerated appeal. The appellate court must 
allow  the  record  to  be  filed  late  when  the 
delay is not the appellant’s fault, and may do 
so when the delay is the appellant’s fault. The 
appellate court may enter any order necessary 
to  ensure  the  timely  filing  of  the  appellate 
record. 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: This is former Rule 54. 
In subdivision 35.1, the time to file the record in civil 
cases  is  based  on  the  date  the  judgment  is  signed 
except in accelerated and restricted appeals, in which 
the  time  to  file  the  record  is  based  on  the  date  the 
notice of appeal is filed.  Subdivision 35.3 is new and 
makes it the responsibility of the trial court clerk and 
court  reporter  to  file  the  record.  Former  Rule  54(c), 
providing for an extension of time to file the record, is 
repealed as unnecessary. The trial court clerk and court 
reporter should make arrangements with the court of 
appeals if additional time is required to file the record, 
as suggested in Rule 37.3.

days after the date the sentence is imposed or 
suspended in open court or the order appealed 
from is signed; 

b)  if  a  timely motion for new  trial  is  filed  and

5.3.  Responsibility for Filing Record 

(a)  Clerk’s  Record.  The  trial  court  clerk  is 
responsible  for  preparing,  certifying,  and 
timely filing the clerk’s record if: 

  (

  (

  (

  (

1)  a  notice  of  appeal  has  been  filed,  and  
in criminal  proceedings,  the  trial  court  
has  certified  the  defendant's  right  of 
appeal, as required by Rule 25.2(d); and 

2)  the party responsible for paying for the 
preparation of the clerk’s record has paid 
the  clerk's  fee,  has  made  satisfactory 
arrangements  with  the  clerk  to  pay  the 
fee,  or  is  entitled  to  appeal  without 
paying the fee.

each complies with the Supreme Court’s and Court of 
Criminal Appeals’ order on preparation of the record. 
If  so,  the  clerk  must  endorse  on  each  the  date  of 
receipt, file it, and notify the parties of the filing and 
the date. If not, the clerk must endorse on the clerk’s 
record or reporter’s record — whichever is defective 
—  the  date  of  receipt  and  return  it  to  the  official 
responsible for filing it. The appellate court clerk must 
specify the defects and instruct the official to correct 
the defects and return the record to the appellate court 
by a specified date. In a criminal case, the record must 
not be posted on the Internet. 

7.3.  If No Record Filed 

(a)  Notice of Late Record. 

  3

 

1)  Civil  Cases.  If  the  clerk’s  record  or 
reporter’s  record  has  not  been  timely 
filed,  the  appellate  clerk  must  send 
notice  to  the  official  responsible  for 
filing it, stating that the record is late and 
requesting that the record be filed within 
30  days  if  an  ordinary  or  restricted 
appeal,  or  10  days  if  an  accelerated 
appeal. The appellate clerk must send a 
copy of this notice to the parties and the 
trial court. If the clerk does not receive 
the  record  within  the  stated  period,  the 
clerk  must  refer  the  matter  to  the 
appellate  court.  The  court  must  make 
whatever  order  is  appropriate  to  avoid 
further delay and to preserve the parties' 
rights.  

2)  Criminal Cases.  If the clerk’s record or 
reporter’s  record  has  not  been  timely 
filed, the appellate court clerk must refer 
the  matter  to  the  appellate  court.  The 
court  must  make  whatever  order  is 
appropriate to avoid further delay and to 
preserve the parties’ rights.

(b)  If No Clerk’s Record Filed Due to Appellant's 
Fault. If the trial court clerk failed to file the 
clerk’s record because  the  appellant  failed  
to    pay    or    make  arrangements  to  pay  the 
clerk’s  fee  for  preparing  the  clerk’s  record, 
the  appellate  court  may  —  on  a  party’s 
motion  or  its  own  initiative  —  dismiss  the 
appeal  for  want  of  prosecution  unless  the 
appellant  was  entitled  to  proceed  without 
payment  of  costs.  The  court  must  give  the 
appellant  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  cure 
before dismissal.

6.2.  Inclusion in Appellate Record 

The record of an  agency  proceeding filed  in  the 
trial court may be included in either the clerk’s record 
or the reporter’s record. 

6.3.  Correcting the Record 

(a)  Correction  by  Agreement.  At any stage of 
the  proceeding,  the  parties  may  agree  to 
correct an agency record filed under Section 
2001.175(b)  of  the  Government  Code  to 
ensure  that  the  agency  record  accurately 
reflects the contested case proceedings before 
the  agency.  The  court  reporter  need  not 
recertify the agency record. 

b)  Correction  by  Trial  Court.  If  the  parties 
cannot  agree  to  a  correction  to  the  agency 
record,  the  appellate  court  must  —  on  any 
party's  motion  or  its  own  incentive  —  send 
the  question  to  the  trial  court.  After    notice  
and  hearing,  the  trial  court  must determine 
what  constitutes  an  accurate  copy  of  the 
agency record and order the agency to send 
an accurate copy to the clerk of the court in 
which the case is pending.

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: The rule is new. 

Rule 37. Duties of the Appellate Clerk on 
Receiving the Notice of Appeal and Record 

7.1.  On Receiving the Notice of Appeal 

If the appellate clerk determines that the notice of 
appeal or certification of defendant's right of appeal in 
a criminal case is defective, the clerk must notify the 
parties  of  the  defect  so  that  it  can  be  remedied,  if 
possible. If a proper notice of appeal or certification of 
a criminal defendant's right of appeal is not filed in the 
trial  court  within  30  days  of  the  date  of  the  clerk's 
notice, the clerk must refer the matter to the appellate 
court, which will make an appropriate order under this 
rule or Rule 34.5(c)(2). 

7.2.  On Receiving the Record 

On receiving the clerk’s record or the reporter’s 
record,  the  appellate  clerk  must  determine  whether

point, or group of issues or points. 

c)  Index of Authorities. The brief must have an 
index  of  authorities  arranged  alphabetically 
and  indicating  the  pages  of  the  brief  where 
the authorities are cited. 
 

(d)  Statement  of  the  Case.  The  brief  must  state 
concisely the nature of the case (e.g., whether 
it is a suit for damages, on a note, or involving 
a  murder  prosecution), 
the  course  of 
proceedings, and the trial court’s disposition 
of 
the  case.  The  statement  should  be 
supported  by  record  references,  should 
seldom exceed one-half page, and should not 
discuss the facts. 

e)  Any  Statement  Regarding  Oral  Argument. 
The brief may include a statement explaining 
why  oral  argument  should  or  should  not  be 
permitted.    Any  such  statement  must  not 
exceed one page and should address how the 
court’s  decisional  process  would,  or  would 
not, be aided by oral argument. As required 
by  Rule  39.7,  any  party  requesting  oral 
argument must note that request on the front 
cover of the party’s brief. 

f)  Issues  Presented.  The  brief  must  state 
concisely  all  issues  or  points  presented  for 
review.  The  statement  of  an  issue  or  point 
will  be  treated  as  covering  every  subsidiary 
question that is fairly included. 

g)  Statement  of  Facts.  The  brief  must  state 
concisely  and  without  argument  the  facts 
pertinent to the issues or points presented.  In 
a civil case, the court will accept as true the 
facts  stated  unless  another  party  contradicts 
them.  The  statement  must  be  supported  by 
record references. 

h)  Summary  of  the  Argument.  The  brief  must 
contain  a  succinct,  clear,  and  accurate 
statement of the arguments made in the body 
of the brief. This summary must not merely 
repeat  the  issues  or  points  presented  for 
review. 

i)  Argument. The brief must contain a clear and 
concise  argument  for  the  contentions  made, 
with  appropriate  citations  to  authorities  and 
to the record. 
 

(j)  Prayer.  The  brief  must  contain  a  short 
conclusion that clearly states the nature of the

(c)  If  No  Reporter’s  Record  Filed  Due  to 
Appellant's  Fault.  Under 
the  following 
circumstances,  and  if  the  clerk’s  record  has 
been filed, the appellate court may —  after  
first    giving    the    appellant    notice    and    a 
reasonable  opportunity  to  cure  —  consider 
and decide those issues or points that do not 
require a reporter’s record for a decision. The 
court may do this if no reporter’s record has 
been filed because: 

1)  the    appellant    failed    to    request    a  

reporter’s record; or 

2)  (A)  appellant    failed    to    pay    or

Comment to 1997 change: Former Rules 56 and 
57(a) are merged. Subdivisions 37.2 and 37.3 are new. 

(a)  Identity  of  Parties  and  Counsel.  The  brief 
must give a complete list of all parties to the 
trial court’s judgment or order appealed from, 
except as otherwise provided in Rule 9.8. The 
brief  must  also  give  a  complete  list  of  the 
names of all counsel appearing in the trial or 
appellate courts; their firm or office name at 
the time of the appearance; and, for counsel 
currently  appearing,  their  mailing  address, 
telephone number, and email address. If new 
counsel  appears  or  if  any  counsel  currently 
appearing  changes 
their  firm  or  office 
affiliation during the pendency of the appeal, 
lead  counsel  for  the  party  must  notify  the 
clerk by filing a supplemental disclosure. 

b)  Table  of  Contents.  The  brief  must  have  a 
table of contents with references to the pages 
of  the  brief.  The  table  of  contents  must 
indicate  the  subject  matter  of  each  issue  or

or  points  in  the  order  the  appellant 
presented those issues or points. 

(b)  Cross-Points. 

1)  Judgment  Notwithstanding  the  Verdict. 
When  the  trial  court  renders  judgment 
notwithstanding  the  verdict  on  one  or 
more questions, the appellee must bring 
forward by cross-point any issue or point

(2)  When  Evidentiary  Hearing  Needed.   
The appellate court must remand a case 
to the trial court to take evidence if:

point raised by the appellant; and 

B)  the appellee raised a cross-point that 
requires  the  taking  of  additional 
evidence.

8.3.  Reply Brief 

The  appellant  may  file  a  reply  brief  addressing 
any  matter  in  the  appellee’s  brief.  However,  the 
appellate  court  may  consider  and  decide  the  case 
before a reply brief is filed. 

1)  Necessary Contents. Unless voluminous 
or  impracticable,  the  appendix  must 
contain a copy of: 

(A)  the   trial   court’s   judgment   or 
other  appealable  order  from  which 
relief is sought; 

B)  the  jury  charge  and verdict, if  any, 
or  the  trial  court’s  findings  of  fact 
and conclusions of law, if any; and 

C)  the  text  of  any  rule,  regulation, 
ordinance,  statute,  constitutional 
provision,  or  other  law  (excluding 
case law) on which the argument is 
based, and the text of any contract or 
other document that is central to the 
argument. 

2)  Optional  Contents.  The  appendix  may 
contain  any  other  item  pertinent  to  the 
issues  or  points  presented  for  review, 
including copies or excerpts of relevant 
court  opinions,  laws,  documents  on 
which  the  suit  was  based,  pleadings, 
excerpts from the reporter’s record, and 
similar  material.  Items  should  not  be 
included  in  the  appendix  to  attempt  to 
avoid the page limits for the brief.

(f)  Costs.    The  actual  expense of  preparing  the 
appendixes  or  the  amount  prescribed  for 
official reporters, whichever is less, is taxed 
as costs. The appellate court may disallow the 
cost of any portion of the appendixes that it

considers  surplusage  or 
conform to any specifications prescribed by 
the  Supreme  Court  or  Court  of  Criminal 
Appeals. 

8.6.  Time to File Briefs 

(a)  Appellant's  Filing  Date.  Except  in  a  habeas 
corpus or bail appeal, which is governed by 
Rule 31, an appellant must file a brief within 
30 days — 20 days in an accelerated appeal 
— after the later of: 

1)  the date the clerk’s record was filed; or 

2)  the date the reporter’s record was filed.

4)  Notice. At the time the appendix is filed, 
the party must give written notice of the 
filing  to  all  parties  to  the  trial  court's

The appellate court need not review any part 
of the electronic recording.

(2)  Notice.  If  the  appellant's  brief  is  not 
timely  filed,  the  appellate  clerk  must 
notify counsel for the parties and the trial 
court  of  that  fact.  If  the  appellate  court 
does not receive a satisfactory response 
within ten days, the court must order the 
trial  court  to  immediately  conduct  a 
hearing 
the 
appellant desires to prosecute his appeal,

8.9.  Briefing Rules to be Construed Liberally 

Because  briefs  are  meant  to  acquaint  the  court 
with the issues in a case and to present argument that 
will  enable  the  court  to  decide  the  case,  substantial 
compliance with this rule is sufficient, subject to the 
following. 
 

(a)  Formal Defects. If the court determines that 
this rule has been flagrantly violated, it may 
require a brief to be amended, supplemented, 
or  redrawn.    If  another  brief  that  does  not 
comply with this rule is filed, the court may 
strike the brief, prohibit the party from filing 
another, and proceed as if the party had failed 
to file a brief. 

  3

 

(b)  Appellee's  Filing  Date.  The  appellee's  brief 
must be filed within 30 days — 20 days in an 
accelerated  appeal  —  after  the  date  the 
appellant's brief was filed. In a civil case, if 
the appellant has not filed a brief as provided 
in this rule, an appellee may file a brief within 
30 days — 20 days in an accelerated appeal 
— after the date the appellant's brief was due. 
 

(c)  Filing Date for Reply Brief. A reply brief, if 
any,  must  be  filed  within  20  days  after  the 
date the appellee's brief was filed. 

d)  Modifications  of  Filing  Time.  On  motion 
complying  with  Rule  10.5(b),  the  appellate 
court  may  extend  the  time  for  filing  a  brief 
and may postpone submission of the case. A 
motion to extend the time to file a brief may 
be  filed  before  or  after  the  date  the  brief  is 
due.  The  court  may  also,  in  the  interests  of 
justice, shorten the time for filing briefs and 
for submission of the case. 

  (

8.7.  Amendment or Supplementation 

A  brief  may  be  amended  or  supplemented 
whenever  justice  requires,  on  whatever  reasonable 
terms the court may prescribe. 

8.8.  Failure of Appellant to File Brief 

(a)  Civil Cases.  If an appellant fails to timely file 

a brief, the appellate court may: 

1)  dismiss 

the  appeal 
unless 

for  want  of 
appellant 
the 
prosecution, 
reasonably  explains  the  failure  and  the 
appellee  is  not  significantly  injured  by 
the  appellant's  failure  to  timely  file  a 
brief; 

2)  decline  to  dismiss  the  appeal  and  give 
further  direction  to  the  case  as  it 
considers proper; or 

3)  if  an  appellee’s  brief  is  filed,  the  court 
may  regard 
that  brief  as  correctly 
presenting  the  case  and  may  affirm  the 
trial  court's  judgment  upon  that  brief 
without examining the record. 

(b)  Criminal Cases. 

1)  Effect.  An  appellant's  failure  to  timely

authoritatively decided; 

c)  the facts and legal arguments are adequately 

presented in the briefs and record; or 

d)  the  decisional  process  would  not  be 

significantly aided by oral argument. 

  (

  (

9.2.  Purpose of Argument 

Oral argument should emphasize and clarify the 
written  arguments  in  the  briefs.  Counsel  should  not 
merely  read  from  prepared  text.    Counsel  should 
assume  that  all  members  of  the  court  have  read  the 
briefs  before  oral  argument  and  counsel  should  be 
prepared to respond to questions. A party should not 
refer  to  or  comment  on  matters  not  involved  in  or 
pertaining to what is in the record. 

9.3.  Time Allowed 

The court will set the time that will be allowed for 
argument.  Counsel  must  complete  argument  in  the 
time allotted and may continue after the expiration of 
the  allotted  time  only  with  permission  of  the  court. 
Counsel is not required to use all the allotted time. The 
appellant must be allowed to conclude the argument. 

9.4.  Number of Counsel 

Generally, only one counsel should argue for each 
side.  Except  on  leave  of  court,  no  more  than  two 
counsel on each side may argue. Only one counsel may 
argue in rebuttal. 

9.5.  Argument by Amicus 

With leave of court obtained before the argument 
and with a party's consent, an amicus curiae may share 
allotted  time  with  that  party.  Otherwise,  counsel  for 
amicus may not argue. 

 

(b)  Substantive Defects. If the court determines, 
either before or after submission, that the case 
has not been properly presented in the briefs, 
or that the law and authorities have not been 
properly  cited  in  the  briefs,  the  court  may 
postpone  submission, 
require  additional 
briefing, and make any other order necessary 
for a satisfactory submission of the case. 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: This is former Rule 74. 
The rule is substantially rewritten.  Paragraph 38.1(e) 
now specifically allows a party to either present issues 
or points of error. Paragraphs 38.1(f) and (g) are new 
and require a brief to include a statement of facts and 
summary of the argument.  Paragraph 38.2(b) is new 
and gives specific requirements for cross-points. See 
also TEX. R. CIV. P. 324(c).  Subdivision 38.3 is new 
and  provides  for  a  reply  brief.  Subdivision  38.4 
imposes a total brief limit of 90 pages on each party. 
Thus,  if  more  than  one  party  has  filed  a  notice  of 
appeal, there will be multiple appellant’s, appellee’s, 
and reply briefs, but each party is limited to a total of 
90 pages. Subdivision 38.5 is new and provides for an 
appendix  in  cases  recorded  electronically  in  the  trial 
court.    Paragraph  38.6(b)  now  provides  that  the 
appellee has 30 — rather than 25 — days to file a brief.   
The  provisions  of  former  Rules  74(I)  (Number  of 
Copies),  (j)  (Briefs  Typewritten  or  Printed),  and  (q) 
(Service  of  Briefs)  are  omitted  as  unnecessary.  See 
Rule 9. 
 

Comment  to  2002  change:  Rule  38.6(d)  is 
amended  to  clarify  that  an  appellate  court  may 
postpone the filing of any brief, not just the appellant's 
brief. 
 

Comment to 2008 change: A party may choose to 
include  a  statement  in  the  brief  regarding  oral 
argument.    The  optional  statement  does  not  count 
toward the briefing page limit. 

Rule 39. Oral Argument; Decision Without 
Argument 

9.6.  When Only One Party Files a Brief 

If counsel for only one party has filed a brief, the 

9.1.  Right to Oral Argument 

court may allow that party to argue. 

A party who has filed a brief and who has timely 
requested  oral  argument  may  argue  the  case  to  the 
court  unless  the  court,  after  examining  the  briefs, 
decides that oral argument is unnecessary for any of 
the following reasons: 
 

9.7. Request  
 

A party desiring oral argument must note 
that request on the front cover of the party’s 
brief.  If  the  court  sets  the  case  for  oral 
argument, then all parties that filed a brief are

given precedence in the interest of justice. 

0.2.  Criminal Cases 

In cases not otherwise given precedence by law, 
the  court  of  appeals  must  hear  and  determine  a 
criminal  appeal  at  the  earliest  possible  time,  having 
due  regard  for  the  parties'  rights  and  for  the  proper 
administration of justice. 
 

Reference 

See Code of Criminal Procedure article 44.01(f). 

Comment  on  1997  change:  The  provisions  of 
former Rules 76, 77 and 78 are merged.  Civil cases 
involving  the  Railroad  Commission,  the  State,  and 
“cases submitted on oral argument for all parties” are 
no longer given preference unless given preference by 
law. 

Rule 41. Panel and En Banc Decision 

1.1.  Decision by Panel 

  4

 

 

 

 

   

  4

 

(a)  Constitution  of  Panel.  Unless  a  court  of 
appeals with more than three justices votes to 
decide  a  case  en  banc,  a  case  must  be 
assigned for decision to a panel of the court 
consisting  of  three  justices,  although  not 
every  member  of  the  panel  must  be  present 
for argument. If the case is decided without 
argument,  three  justices  must  participate  in 
the decision. A majority of the panel, which 
constitutes  a  quorum,  must  agree  on  the 
judgment.  Except  as  otherwise  provided  in 
these rules, a panel's opinion constitutes the 
court's opinion, and the court must render a 
judgment  in  accordance  with  the  panel 
opinion. 

b)  When  Panel  Cannot  Agree  on  Judgment.  
After argument, if for any reason a member 
of the panel cannot participate in deciding a 
case,  the  case  may  be  decided  by  the  two 
remaining justices.  If they cannot agree on a 
judgment,  the  chief  justice  of  the  court  of 
appeals must: 

1)  designate another justice of the court to 
sit on the panel to consider the case; 

  (

  (

  (

entitled  to  participate  in  the  oral  argument, 
even if a party did not request oral argument 
on  the  cover  of  the  party’s  brief.  The  court 
may  direct  a  party  that  has  not  requested 
argument to appear and argue. 

9.8.  Clerk’s Notice 

The  clerk  must  send  to  the  parties—at  least  21 
days  before  the  date  the  case  is  set  for  argument  or 
submission  without  argument—a  notice  telling  the 
parties: 
 

(a)  whether the court will allow oral argument or 
will submit the case without argument; 

c)  if  argument  is  allowed,  the  time  allotted  

for argument; and 

d)  the  names  of  the  members  of  the  panel  to 
which the case will be argued or submitted, 
subject to change by the court. 

 party's failure to receive the notice does not prevent 
a case's argument or submission on the scheduled date. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: This is former Rule 75. 

Technical and nonsubstantive changes are made. 
 

Comment  to  2008  change:  Subdivision  39.1  is 
amended to provide for oral argument unless the court 
determines it is unnecessary and to set out the reasons 
why  argument  may  be  unnecessary.  The  appellate 
court  must  evaluate  these  reasons  in  view  of  the 
traditional  importance  of  oral  argument.  The  court 
need not agree on, and generally should not announce, 
a  specific  reason  or  reasons  for  declining  oral 
argument. 

Rule 40. Order of Decision 

0.1.  Civil Cases 

The court of appeals may determine the order in 
which  civil  cases  will  be  decided.  But  the  following 
types of cases have precedence over all others: 
 

(a)  a case given precedence by law; 
  
(b)  an accelerated appeal; and

1.3.  Precedent in Transferred Cases 

In  cases  transferred  by  the  Supreme  Court  from 
one court of appeals to another, the court of appeals to 
which the case is transferred must decide the case in 
accordance with the precedent of the transferor court 
under principles of stare decisis if the transferee court's 
decision otherwise would have been inconsistent with 
the  precedent  of  the  transferor  court.      The  court's 
opinion  may  state  whether  the  outcome  would  have 
been  different  had  the  transferee  court  not  been 
required  to  decide  the  case  in  accordance  with  the 
transferor court's precedent. 
 

Notes and Comments 
 

Comment to 1997 change: This is former Rule 79. 
The rule is reorganized. Paragraphs 41.1(b) and (c) are 
amended to make clear that a three judge panel must 
hear the case. Therefore, only if a member of a panel 
the  provisions  for 
is 
appointment  of  another  justice  to  break  a  deadlock 
come  into  play.  Paragraph  41.2(a)  is  amended  to 
define an en banc court.

Comment to 2008 change: Subdivisions 41.1 and 
41.2 are amended to acknowledge the full authority of 
the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to temporarily 
assign a justice or judge to hear a matter pending in an 
appellate court.   The statutory provisions governing 
the  assignment  of  judges  to  appellate  courts  are 
located  in  Chapters  74  and  75  of  the  Government 
Code. Other minor changes are made for consistency. 
Subdivision 41.3 is added to require, in appellate cases 
transferred  by  the  Supreme  Court  under  Section 
73.001  of 
for  docket 
the  Government  Code 
equalization  or  other  purposes,  that  the  transferee 
court must generally resolve any conflict between the 
precedent of the transferor court and the precedent of 
the transferee court — or that of any other intermediate 
appellate  court  the  transferee  court  otherwise  would 
have  followed  —  by  following  the  precedent  of  the 
transferor  court,  unless  it  appears  that  the  transferor 
court itself would not be bound by that precedent.  The 
rule  requires  the  transferee  court  to  “stand  in  the 
shoes”  of  the  transferor  court  so  that  an  appellate 
transfer  will  not  produce  a  different  outcome,  based  
on  application  of  substantive law,  than  would  have 
resulted  had  the  case  not  been  transferred.  The 
transferee court is not expected to follow the transferor

case.  The  reconstituted  panel  or  the  en

(c)  When  Court  Cannot  Agree  on  Judgment.  
After argument, if for any reason a member 
of  a  court  consisting  of  only  three  justices 
cannot participate in deciding a case, the case 
may  be  decided  by  the  two  remaining 
justices. If they cannot agree on a judgment, 
that fact must be certified to the Chief Justice 
of the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice may 
then temporarily assign an eligible justice or 
judge  to  sit  with  the  court  of  appeals  to 
consider  the  case.  The  reconstituted  court 
may order the case reargued. 

1.2.  Decision by En Banc Court 

  4

 

(a)  Constitution of En Banc Court.  An en banc 
court  consists  of  all  members  of  the  court 
who are not disqualified or recused and — if 
the  case  was  originally  argued  before  or 
decided  by  a  panel  —  any  members  of  the 
panel who are not members of the court but 
remain eligible for assignment to the court. A 
majority  of  the  en  banc  court  constitute  a 
quorum. A majority of the en banc court must 
agree on a judgment. 

b)  When  En  Banc  Court  Cannot  Agree  on 
Judgment. If a majority of an en banc court 
cannot agree on a judgment, that fact must be 
certified to the Chief Justice of the Supreme 
Court.  The  Chief

temporarily assign an eligible justice or judge 
to sit with the court of appeals to consider the 
case.  The  reconstituted  court  may  order  the 
case reargued.

appellant and his or her attorney must sign the

duplicate with the appellate clerk, who must 
immediately  send  the  duplicate  copy  to  the 
trial court clerk. 
 

(b)  After  the  court  of  appeals  hands  down  its 
opinion,  it  may  not  grant  an  appellant's 
motion to dismiss the appeal unless the other 
parties  consent.  If  the  other  parties  consent 
and the court of appeals grants the appellant's 
motion  to  dismiss  the  appeal,  the  appellate 
opinion  must  be  withdrawn  and  the  appeal 
dismissed.  The  appellate  clerk  must  send 
notice of the dismissal to the trial court clerk. 

2.3.  Involuntary Dismissal in Civil Cases 

Under the following circumstances, on any party's 
motion — or on its own initiative after giving ten days' 
notice to all parties — the appellate court may dismiss 
the appeal or affirm the appealed judgment or order. 
Dismissal  or  affirmance  may  occur  if  the  appeal  is 
subject to dismissal: 
 

(a)  for want of jurisdiction; 

b)  for want of prosecution; or 

c)  because  the  appellant  has  failed  to  comply 
with  a  requirement  of  these  rules,  a  court 
order, or a notice from the clerk requiring a 
response  or  other  action  within  a  specified 
time.

2.4.  Involuntary Dismissal in Criminal Cases 

The appellate court must dismiss an appeal on the 
State’s  motion,  supported  by  affidavit,  showing  that 
the  appellant  has  escaped  from  custody  pending  the 
appeal  and  that  to  the  affiant's  knowledge,  the 
appellant  has  not,  within  ten  days  after  escaping, 
voluntarily returned to lawful custody within the state. 
 

(a)  Timely  Return  to  Custody;  Reinstatement.  
The  appeal  may  not  be  dismissed  —  or,  if 
dismissed,  must  be  reinstated  —  if  an 
affidavit of an officer or other credible person 
is filed showing that the appellant, within ten 
days  after  escaping,  voluntarily  returned  to 
lawful custody within the state. 
 

(b)  Life  Sentence.  The  appellate  court  may 
overrule  the  motion  to  dismiss  —  or,  if  the 
motion was granted, may reinstate the appeal

The court of appeals’ judgment should award to 
the prevailing party costs incurred by that party related 
to  the  appeal,  including  filing  fees  in  the  court  of 
appeals  and  costs  for  preparation  of  the  record.  The 
court of appeals may tax costs otherwise as required 
by law or for good cause. But the judgment must not 
require  the  payment  of  costs  by  a  party  who  was 
entitled  to  proceed  without  payment  of  costs  under 
Rule 20.1, and a provision in the judgment purporting 
to do so is void.

When  a  court  of  appeals  affirms  the  trial  court 
judgment,  or  modifies  that  judgment  and  renders

Comment to 1997 change: Former Rules 59 and 
60 are merged.  Paragraph 42.1(c), allowing a court of 
appeals to withdraw its opinion, is new.  Provision is 
made in paragraph 42.3(c) for dismissal of an appeal 
for  failure  to  comply  with  a  notice  from  the  clerk. 
Other changes are made. 
 

Comment to 2002 change: Rule 42.1 is amended 
to clarify the procedures for implementing settlements 
on  appeal  and  to  expressly  give  courts  flexibility  in 
effectuating  settlements.  The  rule  is  also  clarified  to 
expressly  permit  the  dismissal  of  an  appeal  without 
dismissal of the action itself.  The rule does not permit 
an appellate court to order a new trial merely on the 
agreement of the parties absent reversible error, or to 
vacate a trial court's judgment absent reversible error 
or a settlement.

4.3.  Defects in Procedure 

A  court  of  appeals  must  not  affirm  or  reverse  a 
judgment  or  dismiss  an  appeal  for  formal  defects  or 
irregularities in appellate procedure without allowing 
a  reasonable  time  to  correct or  amend  the defects or 
irregularities. 

4.4.  Remediable Error of the Trial Court 

(a)  Generally. A court of appeals must not affirm 
or reverse a judgment or dismiss an appeal if: 

1)  the  trial  court's  erroneous  action  or 
failure  or  refusal  to  act  prevents  the 
proper presentation of a case to the court 
of appeals; and 

2)  the  trial  court  can  correct  its  action  or 

failure to act. 

(b)  Court  of  Appeals  Direction 

if  Error 
Remediable.  If  the  circumstances  described 
in (a) exist, the court of appeals must direct 
the trial court to correct the error. The court 
of  appeals  will  then  proceed  as  if  the 
erroneous  action  or  failure  to  act  had  not 
occurred. 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: Former Rules 80(d), 81 
and  83  are  merged.  The  reversible  error  standard  in 
subdivision 44.1 is amended to omit the reference to 
an action “reasonably calculated to cause” an improper 
judgment,  but  no  substantive  change  is  intended. 
Paragraph 44.2(a) is amended to limit its standard of 
review  to  constitutional  errors  that  are  subject  to 
harmless error review.  Paragraph 44.2(b) is new and 
is  taken  from  Federal  Rule  of  Criminal  Procedure 
52(a) without substantive change.   Paragraph 44.2(c) 
is  former  Rule  80(d)  without  substantive  change. 
Subdivision 44.3 is amended to delete the reference to 
defects  of  “substance”  and  to  delete  the  provisions 
regarding the late filing of the record.

new. Subdivisions 43.4 and 43.5 are from former Rule 
82. 
 

Rule 44. Reversible Error 

4.1.  Reversible Error in Civil Cases 

(a)  Standard for Reversible Error. No judgment 
may be reversed on appeal on the ground that 
the trial court made an error of law unless the 
court  of  appeals  concludes  that  the  error 
complained of: 

1)  probably  caused  the  rendition  of  an 

improper judgment; or 

2)  probably  prevented  the  appellant  from 
properly presenting the case to the court 
of appeals. 

(b)  Error Affecting Only Part of Case. If the error 
affects  part  of,  but  not  all,  the  matter  in 
controversy and that part is separable without 
unfairness to the parties, the judgment must 
be reversed and a new trial ordered only as to 
the part affected by the error. The court may 
trial  solely  on 
not  order  a  separate 
unliquidated damages if liability is contested. 

4.2.  Reversible Error in Criminal Cases 

(a)  Constitutional Error. If the appellate record 
in a criminal case reveals constitutional error 
that  is  subject  to  harmless  error  review,  the 
court of appeals must reverse a judgment of 
conviction  or  punishment  unless  the  court 
determines  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that

6.5.  Voluntary Remittitur 

If  a  court  of  appeals  reverses  the  trial  court's 
judgment because of a legal error that affects only part 
of the damages awarded by the judgment, the affected 
party may - within 15 days after the court of appeals' 
judgment  -  voluntarily  remit  the  amount  that  the 
affected party believes will cure the reversible error.  
A  party  may  include  in  a  motion  for  rehearing  - 
without  waiving  any  complaint  that  the  court  of 
appeals  erred  -  a  conditional  request  that  the  court 
accept  the  remittitur  and  affirm  the  trial  court's 
judgment  as  reduced.    If  the  court  of  appeals 
determines 
is  not 
sufficient  to  cure  the  reversible  error,  but  that 
remittitur  is  appropriate,  the  court  must  suggest  a 
remittitur  in  accordance  with  Rule  46.3.    If  the 
remittitur  is  timely  filed  and  the  court  of  appeals 
determines  that  the  voluntary  remittitur  cures  the 
reversible  error,  then  the  court  must  accept  the

judgment in accordance with the remittitur.

The rule is revised without substantive change. 
 

Comment  to  2002  change:  Subdivision  46.5  is 
amended  to  clarify  the  procedure  for  offering  a 
voluntary  remittitur.    The  offer  may  be  made  in  a 
motion for  rehearing without  waiving  any complaint 
that the court of appeals erred, thereby extending the 
deadlines for further appeal. 

Rule 47. Opinions, Publication, and Citation

The  court  of  appeals  must  hand  down  a  written 
opinion that is as brief as practicable but that addresses 
every issue raised and necessary to final disposition of 
the appeal.

If the court of appeals determines that an appeal 
is frivolous, it may — on motion of any party or on its 
own 
reasonable 
opportunity  for  response  —  award  each  prevailing 
party just damages. In determining whether to award 
damages, the court must not consider any matter that 
does not appear in the record, briefs, or other papers 
filed in the court of appeals. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: This is former Rule 84. 
The limit on the amount of the sanction that may be 
imposed  is  repealed.  A  requirement  of  notice  and 
opportunity to respond is added. 
 

Rule 46. Remittitur in Civil Cases 
 

46.1.  Remittitur After Appeal Perfected 
 

If the trial court suggests a remittitur but the case 
is appealed before the remittitur is filed, the party who 
would make the remittitur may do so in the court of 
appeals in the same manner as in the trial court. The 
court of appeals must then render the judgment that the 
trial  court  should have  rendered  if  the  remittitur  had 
been made in the trial court. 

If a party makes the remittitur at the trial judge’s 
suggestion and the party benefitting from the remittitur 
appeals,  the  remitting  party  is  not  barred  from 
contending in the court of appeals that all or part of the 
remittitur  should  not  have  been  required,  but  the 
remitting  party  must  perfect  an  appeal  to  raise  that 
point.  If  the  court  of  appeals  sustains  the  remitting 
party's contention that remittitur should not have been 
required, the court must render the judgment that the 
trial court should have rendered. 

Suggestion  of  Remittitur  by  Court  of

The court of appeals may suggest a remittitur. If 
the remittitur is timely filed, the court must reform and

remittitur. If the remittitur is not timely filed, the court 
must reverse the trial court's judgment.

7.5.  Concurring and Dissenting Opinions 

Only a justice who participated in the decision of 
a case may file or join in an opinion concurring in or 
dissenting from the judgment of the court of appeals. 
Any  justice  on  the  court  may  file  an  opinion  in 
connection  with  a  denial  of  consideration  or 
reconsideration en banc. 

7.6.  Change in Designation by En Banc Court 

A court en banc may change a panel's designation 

of an opinion. 

7.7.  Citation of Unpublished Opinions 

(a)  Criminal Cases. Opinions and memorandum 
opinions  not  designated  for  publication  by 
the court of appeals under these or prior rules 
have no precedential value but may be cited 
with  the  notation,  “(not  designated  for 
publication).” 

b)  Civil  Cases.    Opinions  and  memorandum 
opinions  designated  “do  not  publish”  under 
these rules by the courts of appeals prior to 
January  1,  2003  have  no  precedential  value 
but  may  be  cited  with  the  notation,  “(not 
designated for publication).”  If an opinion or 
memorandum opinion issued on or after that 
date  is  erroneously  designated  “do  not 
publish,”  the  erroneous designation will  not 
affect the precedential value of the decision. 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: This is former Rule 90. 
Subdivision  47.1  makes  clear  that  a  memorandum 
opinion  should  not  be  any  longer  than  necessary. 
Subdivision 47.5 is amended to make clear that only 
justices  who participated  in  the  decision may  file  an 
opinion  in  the  case.    Judges  who  are  not  on  a  panel 
may  file  an  opinion  only  in  respect  to  a  hearing  or 
rehearing  en  banc.  Former  Rule  90(h),  regarding 
publication of opinions after the Supreme Court grants 
review, is repealed.

considering the case must determine whether 
the opinion will be signed by a justice or will 
be  per  curiam  and  whether  it  will  be 
designated  an  opinion  or  memorandum 
opinion.  The  names  of  the  participating 
justices must be noted on all written opinions 
or orders of the court or a panel of the court. 

b)  Criminal  Cases.    In    addition,  each  opinion 
and memorandum opinion in a criminal case 
must  bear  the notation  “publish”  or  “do  not 
publish” as determined — before the opinion 
is  handed  down  —  by  a  majority  of  the 
justices  who  participate  in  considering  the 
case.    Any  party  may  move  the  appellate 
court to change the notation, but the court of 
appeals must not change the notation after the 
Court of Criminal Appeals has acted on any 
party's  petition  for  discretionary  review  or 
other  request  for  relief.    The  Court  of 
Criminal Appeals may, at any time, order that 
a  “do  not  publish”  notation  be  changed  to 
“publish.” 
 

(c)  Civil  Cases.  Opinions  and  memorandum 
opinions  in  civil  cases  issued  on  or  after 
January 1, 2003 shall not be designated “do 
not publish.” 

7.3.  Distribution of Opinions 

All opinions of the courts of appeals are open to 
the  public  and  must  be  made  available  to  public 
reporting services, print or electronic. 

7.4.  Memorandum Opinions 

If the issues are settled, the court should write a 
brief memorandum opinion no longer than necessary 
to  advise  the  parties  of  the  court's  decision  and  the 
basic reasons for it.  An opinion may not be designated 
a memorandum opinion if the author of a concurrence 
or dissent opposes that designation. An opinion must 
be designated a memorandum opinion unless it does 
any of the following: 
 

(a)  establishes  a  new  rule  of  law,  alters  or 
modifies  an  existing  rule,  or  applies  an 
existing rule to a novel fact situation likely to 
recur in future cases; 

b)  involves issues of constitutional law or other 
legal issues important to the jurisprudence of 
Texas; 

c)  criticizes existing law; or

8.4.  Opinion Sent to Criminal Defendant 

In  criminal  cases,  the  attorney  representing  the 
defendant  on  appeal  shall,  within  five  days  after  the 
opinion is handed down, send his client a copy of the 
opinion and judgment, along with notification of the 
defendant's  right  to  file  a  pro  se  petition  for 
discretionary review under Rule 68.  This notification 
shall be sent certified mail, return receipt requested, to 
the defendant at his last known address. The attorney 
shall also send the court of appeals a letter certifying 
his compliance with this rule and attaching a copy of 
the return receipt within the time for filing a motion 
for rehearing. The court of appeals shall file this letter 
in its record of the appeal. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: This is former Rule 91 

with changes. 

Rule 49. Motion for Rehearing and En Banc 
Reconsideration 

A  motion  for  rehearing  may  be  filed  within  15 
days after the court of appeals’ judgment or order is 
rendered.  The  motion  must  clearly  state  the  issues 
relied on for the rehearing. 

9.2.  Response to Motion for Rehearing 

No  response  to  a  motion  for  rehearing  need  be 
filed unless the court so requests.  The motion will not 
be  granted  unless  a  response  has  been  filed  or 
requested by the court. 

9.3.  Decision on Motion for Rehearing 

A  motion  for  rehearing  may  be  granted  by  a 
majority  of  the  justices  who  participated  in  the 
decision  of  the  case.  Unless  two  justices  who 
participated  in  the  decision  of  the  case  agree  on  the 
disposition  of  the  motion  for  rehearing,  the  chief 
justice of the court of appeals must assign a justice to 
replace  any  justice  who  participated  in  the  panel 
decision but cannot participate in deciding the motion 
for  rehearing.  If  rehearing  is  granted,  the  court  may 
dispose of the case with or without rebriefing and oral 
argument.

opinions  as  authority  in  civil  cases.    The rule  favors 
the use of “memorandum opinions” designated as such 
except  in  certain  types  of  cases  but  does  not  change 
other  requirements,  such  as  those  in  Pool  v.  Ford 
Motor Co., 715 S.W.2d 629, 635-636 (Tex. 1986). An 
opinion previously designated “do not publish” has no 
precedential value but may be cited.  The citation must

9.4.  Further Motion for Rehearing 

After  a  court  decides  a  motion  for  rehearing,  a 
further  motion  for  rehearing  may  be  filed  within  15 
days of the court's action if the court: 
 

(a)  modifies its judgment; 

b)  vacates  its  judgment  and  renders  a  new 

judgment; or 

c)  issues a different opinion. 

A motion for rehearing or en banc reconsideration 
may be amended as a matter of right anytime before 
the  15-day  period  allowed  for  filing  the  motion 
expires, and with leave of the court, anytime before the 
court of appeals decides the motion.  

9.9.  Extension of Time 

A court of appeals may extend the time for filing 
a motion for rehearing or en banc reconsideration if a 
party files a motion complying with Rule 10.5(b) no 
later  than  15  days  after  the  last  date  for  filing  the 
motion. 

9.5.  En Banc Reconsideration 

9.10.  Not Required for Review 

A  party  may  file  a  motion  for  en  banc 
reconsideration as a separate motion, with or without 
filing a motion for rehearing. The motion must be filed 
within  the  time  prescribed  by  Rule  49.1  for  filing  a 
motion for rehearing. The motion should address the 
standard for en banc consideration in Rule 41.2(c). No 
response to a motion for en banc reconsideration need 
be filed unless the court so requests. While the court 
has  plenary  power,  a  majority  of  the  en  banc  court 
may,  on 
initiative,  order  en  banc 
reconsideration  of  a  decision.  If  a  majority  orders 
reconsideration,  the  judgment  or  order  does  not 
become final, and the case will be resubmitted to the 
court  for  en  banc  review  and  disposition.  The  court 
may dispose of the case with or without rebriefing and 
oral argument.

court’s action if the court:

nor is it required to preserve error. 

9.11. Relationship to Petition for Review 

A party may not file a motion for rehearing or en 
banc reconsideration in the court of appeals after that 
party  has  filed  a  petition  for  review  in  the  Supreme 
Court unless the court of appeals modifies its opinion 
or judgment after the petition for review is filed.   The 
filing  of  a  petition  for  review  does  not  preclude 
another party from filing a motion for rehearing or en 
banc reconsideration or preclude the court of appeals 
from ruling on the motion.   If a motion for rehearing 
or  en  banc  reconsideration  is  timely  filed  after  a 
petition  for  review  is  filed,  the  petitioner  must 
immediately  notify  the  Supreme  Court  clerk  of  the 
filing of the motion, and must notify the clerk when 
the last timely filed motion is overruled by the court of 
appeals.

Appellate court costs must be included with 
the trial court costs in any process to enforce 
the  judgment.  If  all  or  part  of  the  costs  are 
collected, 
trial  court  clerk  must 
immediately remit to the appellate court clerk 
any amount due to that clerk. The trial court 
need not make any further order in the case, 
and  the  appellate  court’s  judgment  may  be 
enforced as in other cases, when the appellate 
judgment: 

1)  affirms the trial court's judgment; 

2)  modifies  the  trial  court's  judgment  and, 
as so modified, affirms that judgment; or 

3)  renders  the  judgment  the  trial  court 

should have rendered. 

When the trial court clerk receives the mandate, 
the  appellate  court’s  judgment  must  be  enforced  as 
follows: 
 

(a)  Clerk’s Duties. The trial court clerk must:

1)  send an acknowledgment to the appellate 

clerk of the mandate's receipt; and 

2)  immediately file the mandate. 

(b)  Judgment  of  Affirmance;  Defendant  Not  in 

Custody.  

 

(1)  Capias  to  Be  Issued.  If  the  judgment 
contains  a  sentence  of  confinement  or 
imprisonment 
that  has  not  been 
suspended, the trial court must promptly 
issue  a  capias  for  the  defendant's  arrest 
so  that  the  court's  sentence  can  be 
executed. 

2)  Contents  of  Capias.  The  capias  may 
issue to any county of this state and must 
be  executed  and  returned  as  in  felony 
cases, except that no bail may be taken. 
The capias must: 

B)  set    forth    the    offense    and    the 
court's judgment and sentence; 

C)  state    that    the    judgment    was

to clarify that a further motion for rehearing may be 
filed if the court issues a different opinion, irrespective 
of whether the opinion is issued in connection with the 
overruling of a prior motion for rehearing. Issuance of 
a new opinion that is not substantially different should 
not  occasion  a  further  motion  for  rehearing,  but  a 
motion's  lack  of  merit  does  not  affect  appellate 
deadlines. The provisions of former Rule 53.7(b) that 
address  motions  for  rehearing  are  moved  to  new 
the 
subdivision  49.11  without  change, 
provisions  of  Rule  53.7(b)  that  address  petitions  for 
review undisturbed.   Subdivision 49.12 mirrors Rule

in the order here indicated, contain the following: 
 

1)  When  New  Trial  Ordered.  When  the 
appellate  court  reverses  the  trial  court's 
judgment and grants the defendant a new 
trial, the procedure is governed by Code 
of  Criminal  Procedure  article  44.29.  If 
the defendant is in custody and entitled 
to  bail,  the  defendant  must  be  released 
upon giving bail. 

2)  When  Case  Dismissed.  When 

the 
appellate  court  reverses  the  trial  court's 
judgment  and  orders  the  case  to  be 
dismissed, the defendant — if in custody 
— must be discharged. 

(d)  Judgment  of  Acquittal.  When  the  appellate 
court  reverses  a  judgment  and  orders  the 
defendant's  acquittal,  the  defendant  —  if  in 
custody  —  must  be  discharged,  and  no 
further order or judgment of the trial court is 
necessary.

(e)  Statement of Jurisdiction. The petition must 
state,  without  argument,  the  basis  of  the 
court's jurisdiction. If the Supreme Court and 
the  court  of  appeals  have  concurrent 
jurisdiction,  the  petition  must  be  presented 
first to the court of appeals unless there is a 
compelling reason not to do so.  If the petition 
is  filed  in  the  Supreme  Court  without  first 
being  presented  to  the  court  of  appeals,  the 
petition  must  state  the  compelling  reason 
why the petition was not first presented to the 
court of appeals.

(b)  Supplementation Permitted. After the record 
is  filed,  relator  or  any  other  party  to  the 
proceeding may file additional materials for 
inclusion in the record. 

c)  Service of Record on All Parties.  Relator and 
any party who files materials for inclusion in 
the record must – at the same time – serve on 
each party: 

  (

1)  those materials not previously served on 
that party as part of the record in another 
original appellate proceeding in the same 
or another court; and 

2)  an   index  listing  the  materials  filed  
and  describing  them  in  sufficient  detail 
to identify them. 

(a)  Relief  Denied.  If  the  court  determines  from 
the petition and any response and reply that 
the relator is not entitled to the relief sought, 
the  court  must  deny  the  petition.      If  the 
relator  in  a  habeas  corpus  proceeding  has 
been released on bond, the court must remand 
the  relator  to  custody  and  issue  an  order  of 
commitment. If the relator is not returned to 
custody, the court may declare the bond to be 
forfeited  and  render  judgment  against  the 
surety. 
 

(b)  Interim Action. If the court is of the tentative 
opinion  that  relator  is  entitled  to  the  relief 
sought or that a serious question concerning 
the relief requires further consideration: 

1)  the court must request a response if one 

has not been filed; 

2)  the  Supreme  Court  may  request  full 

briefing under Rule 55; 

3)  in a habeas corpus proceeding, the court

(a)  the list of parties and counsel is not required 
unless necessary to supplement or correct the 
list contained in the petition; 

b)  the response need not include a statement of

or  Misleading 

On motion of any party or on its own initiative, 
the  court  may  —  after  notice  and  a  reasonable 
opportunity to respond — impose just sanctions on a 
party  or  attorney  who  is  not  acting  in  good  faith  as 
indicated by any of the following: 
 

(a)  filing a petition that is clearly groundless; 

b)  bringing  the   petition  solely  for   delay  of   

an underlying proceeding; 

c)  grossly      misstating      or      omitting      an   
obviously important and material fact in the 
petition or response; or 

d)  filing   an   appendix  or   record   that   is   
clearly misleading because of the omission of 
obviously important and material evidence or 
documents.

Comment  to  1997  change:  Former  Rules  120, 
121,  and  122  are  merged  into  this  rule.  The 
requirement  of  a  motion  for  leave  in  original 
proceedings is repealed. The form of the petition and 
response,  contents  of  the  appendix  and  record,  page 
limits, and relief that may be granted are specifically 
stated.  Specific provision is now made for a motion 
for rehearing. A provision for sanctions is added. 
 

Comment to 2002 change: Subdivision 52.7(c) is 
added  to  specify  how  record  materials  in  original 
proceedings are to be served.  Ordinarily, a party must 
serve record materials and an index of those materials 
on all other parties. But when materials have already 
been served in related original proceedings, they need 
not  be  served  again.      Examples  are  when  original 
proceedings  raising  the  same  issues  are  brought  in 
both the court of appeals and the Supreme Court, or 
when  separate  original  proceedings  are  filed  arising 
out of the same underlying lawsuit. The purpose of this 
procedure  is  to  ensure  that  all  parties  have  record 
materials 
requiring 
unnecessary duplication. 

available  without 

readily 

(4)  the  court  may  set  the  case  for  oral 

 

argument.  

 

(c)  Relief  Granted.  If  the  court  determines  that 
relator  is  entitled  to  relief,  it  must  make  an 
appropriate order. The court may grant relief 
without hearing oral argument. 

d)  Opinion. When denying relief, the court may 
hand down an opinion but is not required to 
do  so.  When  granting  relief,  the  court  must 
hand down an opinion as in any other case.  
Rule 47 is applicable to an order or opinion 
by a court of appeals except that the court of 
appeals  may  not  order  an  unpublished 
opinion published after the Supreme Court or 
Court of Criminal Appeals has acted on any 
party’s  petition  for  extraordinary  relief 
addressing the same issues. 

  (

2.9.  Motion for Rehearing 

Any party may file a motion for rehearing within 
15 days after the final order is rendered.  The motion 
must clearly state the points relied on for the rehearing. 
No  response  to  a  motion  for  rehearing  need  be  filed 
unless the court so requests.  The court will not grant 
a motion for rehearing unless a response has been filed 
or requested. 

2.10. Temporary Relief 

(a)  Motion   for   Temporary   Relief;   Certificate   

of Compliance. The relator may file a motion 
to stay any underlying proceedings or for any 
other  temporary  relief  pending  the  court’s 
action on the petition. The relator must notify 
or make a diligent effort to notify all parties 
by expedited means (such as by telephone or 
fax)  that  a  motion  for  temporary  relief  has 
been or will be filed and must certify to the 
court that the relator has complied with this 
paragraph  before  temporary  relief  will  be 
granted. 
 

(b)  Grant of Temporary Relief. The court — on 
motion of any party or on its own initiative 
—  may  without  notice  grant  any  just  relief 
pending the court’s action on the petition.   As 
a condition of granting temporary relief, the 
court may require a bond to protect the parties 
who  will  be  affected  by  the  relief.  Unless

Comment  to  2008  change:  The  reference  to 
“unpublished” opinions in Subdivision 52.3(d)(5)(D) 
is  deleted.    The  filer  should  provide  the  best  cite 
available for the court of appeals’ opinion, which may 
be a LEXIS, Westlaw, or other citation to an electronic 
medium.    Subdivision  52.3  is  further  amended  to 
delete  the  requirement  that  all  factual  statements  be 
verified by affidavit.  Instead, the filer — in the usual 
case  of  a  party  with  legal  representation,  the  lead 
counsel — must include a statement certifying that all 
factual  statements  are  supported  by  competent 
evidence  in  the  appendix  or  record  to  which  the 
petition  has  cited.  The  certification  required  by 
subdivision  52.3(j)  does  not  count  against  the  page 
limitations. 

SECTION FOUR: PROCEEDINGS IN THE 
SUPREME COURT 
 
Rule 53. Petition for Review 

3.1.  Method of Review 

The  Supreme  Court  may  review  a  court  of 
appeals'  final  judgment  on  a  petition  for  review 
addressed to “The Supreme Court of Texas.” A party 
who seeks to alter the court of appeals’ judgment must 
file  a  petition  for  review.  The  petition  for  review 
procedure  replaces  the  writ  of  error  procedure. 
Statutes pertaining to the writ of error in the Supreme 
Court apply equally to the petition for review. 

(a)  Identity of Parties and Counsel. The petition 
must give a complete list of all parties to the 
trial court’s final judgment. The petition must 
also give a complete list of the names of all 
counsel  appearing  in  the  trial  or  appellate 
courts; their firm or office name at the time 
of the appearance; and, for counsel currently 
appearing,  their  mailing  address,  telephone 
number,  and  email  address.  If  new  counsel 
appears or if any counsel currently appearing 
changes firm or office  affiliation during  the 
pendency of the appeal, lead counsel for the 
party  must  notify  the  clerk  by  filing  a 
supplemental disclosure. 

b)  Table of Contents. The petition must have a

The  petition  for  review  must,  under  appropriate 
headings and in the order here indicated, contain the 
following items:

(A)  the  judgment  or  other  appealable 
order  of  the  trial  court  from  which 
relief  in  the  court  of  appeals  was 
sought; 

B)  the  jury  charge  and verdict, if  any, 
or  the  trial  court’s  findings  of  fact 
and conclusions of law, if any; 

C)  the  opinion  and  judgment  of  the 

court of appeals; and 

D)  the  text  of  any  rule,  regulation, 
ordinance,  statute,  constitutional 
provision, or other law on which the 
argument  is  based  (excluding  case 
law), and the text of any contract or 
other document that is central to the 
argument. 

  (

  (

  (

2)  Optional  Contents.  The  appendix  may 
contain  any  other  item  pertinent  to  the 
issues  or  points  presented    for    review, 
including copies or excerpts of relevant 
court  opinions,  statutes,  constitutional 
provisions, documents on which the suit 
was  based,  pleadings,  and  similar 
material.    Items  should not be  included 
in  the  appendix  to  attempt  to  avoid  the 
page limits for the petition. 

Any other party to the appeal may file a response 
to the petition for review, but it is not mandatory.  If 
no response is timely filed, or if a party files a waiver 
of  response,  the  Court  will  consider  the  petition 
without  a  response.  A  petition  will  not  be  granted 
before  a response has  been filed  or requested by  the 
Court. The response must conform to the requirements 
of 53.2, except that: 
 

(a)  the list of parties and counsel is not required 
unless necessary to supplement or correct the 
list contained in the petition; 

b)  a statement of the case and a statement of the 
facts need not be made unless the respondent 
is  dissatisfied  with  that  portion  of  the 
petition; 

c)  a statement of the issues presented need not 

be made unless:

(f)  Issues  Presented.  The  petition  must  state 
concisely  all  issues  or  points  presented  for 
review.   The statement of an issue or point 
will  be  treated  as  covering  every  subsidiary 
question that is fairly included. If the matter 
complained of originated in the trial court, it 
should  have  been  preserved  for  appellate 
review in the trial court and assigned as error 
in the court of appeals. 

g)  Statement of Facts. The petition must affirm 
that the court of appeals correctly stated the 
nature of the case, except in any particulars 
pointed out. The petition must state concisely 
and  without  argument 
facts  and 
procedural background pertinent to the issues 
or points presented.  The statement must be 
supported by record references.

h)  Summary of the Argument. The petition must

statement of the arguments made in the body 
of  the  petition.    This  summary  must  not 
merely repeat the issues or points presented 
for review. 

citations 

i)  Argument. The petition must contain a clear 
and  concise  argument  for  the  contentions 
made,  with 
to 
appropriate 
authorities  and  to  the  record.  The  argument 
need  not  address  every  issue  or  point 
included in the statement of issues or points.  
Any  issue  or  point  not  addressed  may  be 
addressed in the brief on the merits if one is 
requested by the Court. The argument should 
state  the  reasons  why  the  Supreme  Court 
should exercise jurisdiction to hear the case 
with specific reference to the factors listed in 
Rule 56.1(a).  The petition need not quote at 
the 
length  from  a  matter 
appendix;  a  reference  to  the  appendix  is 
sufficient.  The Court will consider the court 
of appeals’ opinion along with the petition, so 
statements  in  that  opinion  need  not  be 
repeated.

consideration of issues or points briefed in that court 
but  not  decided  by  that  court,  or  to  request  that  the 
Supreme Court consider such issues or points, a party

response,  the  reply,  any  brief,  or  a  motion  for 
rehearing. 

3.5.  Petitioner's Reply to Response 

The  petitioner  may  file  a  reply  addressing  any

mailing or shipping have not been paid. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment  to  1997  change:  This  is  former  Rule 
132.  Subdivision  54.1  is  new  and  provides  for  the 
Supreme  Court  to  request  the  filing  of  the  record. 
Other changes are made. 

Rule 55. Brief on the Merits 

5.1.  Request by Court 

A  brief  on  the  merits  must  not  be  filed  unless 
requested by the Court. With or without granting the 
petition for review, the Court may request the parties 
to file briefs on the merits.  In appropriate cases, the 
Court  may  realign  parties  and  direct  that  parties  file 
consolidated briefs.

If a petition, response, or reply does not conform 
with these rules, the Supreme Court may require the 
document to be revised or may return the document to 
the  party  who  filed  it  and  consider  the  case  without 
allowing the document to be revised. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: Former Rules 130 and 
131  are  merged.  The 50-page  application  for  writ of 
error  is  replaced  by  a  15-page  petition  for  review, 
which  is  filed  in  the  Supreme  Court  and  should 
concentrate on the reasons the Court should exercise 
jurisdiction  to  hear  the  case.      The  contents  of  the 
petition and response, the length of the documents, the 
time for filing are all specifically stated. 
 

timely 

filing  of  a  motion 

Comment to 2008 change: Subdivision 53.7(a) is 
amended  to  clarify  that  the  Supreme  Court  may 
shorten the time for filing a petition for review and that 
for  en  banc 
the 
reconsideration tolls the commencement of the 45-day 
period for filing a petition for review until the motion 
is  overruled.    Subdivision  53.2(d)(8)  is  amended  to 
delete  the  reference  to  unpublished  opinions  in  civil 
cases.  Subdivision 53.2(d)(9) is amended to require a 
party  that  prematurely  files  a  petition  for  review  to 
notify the Supreme Court of any panel rehearing or en 
banc reconsideration motions still pending in the court 
of appeals. Subdivision 53.7(b) is revised to reference 
this  new  requirement  and  to  relocate  to  new  Rule  
49.11 
for 
those  provisions  governing  motions 
rehearing. 

Rule 54. Filing the Record 

4.1.  Request for Record 

With or without granting the petition for review, 
the Supreme Court may request that the record from 
the  court  of  appeals  be  filed  with  the  clerk  of  the 
Supreme Court.

review.  The  statement  of  an  issue  or  point 
will  be  treated  as  covering  every  subsidiary 
question that is fairly included.  The phrasing 
of the issues or points need not be identical to 
the  statement  of  issues  or  points  in  the 
petition for review, but the brief may not raise 
additional  issues  or  points  or  change  the 
substance of the issues or points presented in 
the petition. 

g)  Statement of Facts. The brief must affirm that 
the  court  of  appeals  correctly  stated  the

contain  a  succinct,  clear,  and  accurate 
statement of the arguments made in the body 
of the brief.  This summary must not merely 
repeat  the  issues  or  points  presented  for 
review. 

i)  Argument. The brief must contain a clear and 
concise  argument  for  the  contentions  made, 
with  appropriate  citations  to  authorities  and 
to the record.

55.2.  Petitioner's Brief on the Merits 
 

The  petitioner’s  brief  on  the  merits  must  be

appearing,  their  mailing  address,  telephone 
number,  and  email  address.  If  new  counsel

pendency of the appeal, lead counsel for the 
party  must  notify  the  clerk  by  filing  a 
supplemental disclosure. 

b)  Table  of  Contents.  The  brief  must  have  a 
table of contents with references to the pages 
of  the  brief.  The  table  of  contents  must

the authorities are cited. 

d)  Statement of the Case. The brief must contain 
a  statement  of  the  case  that  should  seldom 
exceed one page and should not discuss the 
facts.  The  statement  must  contain 
the 
following: 

  (

  (

  (

1)  a concise description of the nature of the 
case  (e.g.,  whether  it  is  a  suit  for 
damages, on a note, or in trespass to try 
title); 

2)  the  name  of  the  judge  who  signed  the 

order or judgment appealed from; 

3)  the designation of the trial court and the

party may file the brief that the party filed in the court 
of appeals. 

5.6.  Deleted 

5.7.  Time and Place of Filing; Extension of Time 

Briefs must be filed with the Supreme Court clerk 
in  accordance  with  the  schedule  stated  in  the  clerk's 
notice that the Court has requested briefs on the merits. 
If no schedule is stated in the notice, petitioner must 
file a brief on the merits within 30 days after the date 
of the notice, respondent must file a brief in response 
within  20  days  after  receiving  petitioner’s  brief,  and 
petitioner must file any reply brief within 15 days after 
receiving respondent’s brief.   On motion complying 
with Rule 10.5(b) either before or after the brief is due, 
the Supreme Court may extend the time to file a brief. 

If  the  petitioner  files  a  brief  on  the  merits,  any 
other party to the appeal may file a brief in response, 
which must conform to 55.2, except that: 
 

(a)  the list of parties and counsel is not required 
unless necessary to supplement or correct the 
list contained in the petitioner's brief; 

5.3.  Respondent's Brief

b)  a statement of the case and a statement of the 
facts need not be made unless the respondent 
is  dissatisfied  with  that  portion  of  the 
petitioner's brief; and 

c)  a statement of the issues presented need not 

be made unless: 

1)  the  respondent  is  dissatisfied  with  the 
statement made in the petitioner's brief; 

5.8.  Amendment 

2)  the      respondent      is      asserting   
independent  grounds  for  affirmance  of 
the court of appeals' judgment; or 

On  motion  showing  good  cause,  the  Court  may 
allow  a  party  to  amend  a  brief  on  such  reasonable 
terms as the Court may prescribe. 

3)  the   respondent  is   asserting  grounds  
that establish the respondent's right to a 
judgment  that  is  less  favorable  to  the 
respondent  than  the  judgment  rendered 
by  the  court  of  appeals  but  more 
favorable  to  the  respondent  than  the 
judgment  that  might  be  awarded  to  the 
petitioner (e.g., a remand for a new trial 
rather  than  a  rendition  of  judgment  in 
favor of the petitioner); 

(d)  a statement of jurisdiction should be omitted 
unless  the  petition  fails  to  assert  valid 
grounds for jurisdiction; and 

e)  the respondent's argument must be confined 
to  the  issues  or  points  presented  in  the 
petitioner's  brief  or  asserted  by 
the 
respondent  in  the  respondent's  statement  of 
issues. 

5.9. Court May Require Revision 

If a brief does not conform with these rules, the 
Supreme Court may require the brief to be revised or 
may return it to the party who filed it and consider the 
case without further briefing by that party. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment  to  1997  change:  The  rule  is  new  and 
provides for a 50 page brief on the merits if requested 
by the Supreme Court. 
 

Comment  to  2002  change:  Subdivision  55.1  is 
clarified to provide that the Court may realign parties 
to require consolidated briefing for a clearer and more 
efficient presentation of the case.

5.4.  Petitioner's Brief in Reply 

6.1.  Orders on Petition for Review 

The  petitioner  may  file  a  reply  brief  addressing 
any matter in the brief in response. However, the Court 
may consider and decide the case before a reply brief 
is filed. 

5.5.  Reliance on Prior Brief 

(a)  Considerations 

in  Granting  Review.   
Whether  to  grant  review  is  a  matter  of  
judicial  discretion.  Among  the  factors  the 
Supreme Court considers in deciding whether 
to  grant  a  petition  for  review  are  the 
following: 
 

74 

 

 

  5

 

  5

 

d)  Improvident Grant. If the Court has granted 
review  but  later  decides  that  review  should 
not  have  been  granted,  the  Court  may, 
without opinion, set aside the order granting 
review  and  dismiss  the  petition  or  deny  or 
refuse  review  as  though  review  had  never 
been granted. 

6.2.  Moot Cases 

If a case is moot, the Supreme Court may, after 
notice  to  the  parties,  grant  the  petition  and,  without 
hearing argument, dismiss the case or the appealable 
portion  of  it  without  addressing  the  merits  of  the 
appeal. 

6.3.  Settled Cases 

If a case is settled by agreement of the parties and 
the parties so move, the Supreme Court may grant the 
petition if it has not already been granted and, without 
hearing argument or considering the merits, render a 
judgment  to  effectuate  the  agreement.  The  Supreme 
Court's action may include setting aside the judgment 
of the court of appeals or the trial court without regard 
to the merits and remanding the case to the trial court 
for  rendition  of  a  judgment  in  accordance  with  the 
agreement.  The  Supreme  Court  may  abate  the  case 
until  the  lower  court’s  proceedings  to  effectuate  the 
agreement are complete.   A severable portion of the 
proceeding may be disposed of if it will not prejudice 
the  remaining  parties.    In  any  event,  the  Supreme 
Court's  order  does  not  vacate  the  court  of  appeals' 
opinion  unless 
the  order  specifically  provides 
otherwise.    An  agreement  or  motion  cannot  be 
conditioned on vacating the court of appeals’ opinion. 

6.4.  Notice to Parties 

When the Supreme Court grants, denies, refuses, 
or dismisses a petition for review, the Supreme Court 
clerk must send a written notice of the disposition to 
the court of appeals, the trial court, and all parties to 
the appeal. 

6.5.  Return of Documents to Court of Appeals 

When  the  Supreme  Court  denies,  refuses,  or 
dismisses a petition for review, the clerk will retain the 
petition,  together  with  the  record  and  accompanying 
papers, for 30 days after the order is rendered.  If no 
motion for rehearing has been filed by the end of that 
period or when any motion for rehearing of the order 
has  been  overruled,  the  clerk  must  send  a  certified 
copy of its order to the court of appeals and return the

2)  whether  there  is  a  conflict  between  the 
courts of appeals on an important point 
of law; 
 

(3)  whether a case involves the construction 

or validity of a statute; 

4)  whether  a  case  involves  constitutional 

issues; 

5)  whether the court of appeals appears to 
have committed an error of law of such 
importance  to  the  state’s  jurisprudence 
that it should be corrected; and 

6)  whether the court of appeals has decided 
an  important  question  of  state  law  that 
should be, but has not been, resolved by 
the Supreme Court. 

(b)  Petition  Denied  or  Dismissed.  When  the 
petition has been on file in the Supreme Court 
for 30 days, the Court may deny or dismiss 
the petition — whether or not a response has 
been  filed  —  with  one  of  the  following 
notations: 

1)  “Denied.”  If  the  Supreme  Court  is  not 
satisfied that the opinion of the court of 
appeals has correctly declared the law in 
all  respects,  but  determines  that  the 
petition  presents  no  error  that  requires 
reversal or that is of such importance to 
the  jurisprudence  of  the  state  as  to 
require  correction,  the  Court  will  deny 
the petition with the notation “Denied.” 

2)  “Dismissed w.o.j.” If the Supreme Court 
lacks jurisdiction, the Court will dismiss 
the petition with the notation “Dismissed 
for Want of Jurisdiction.” 

(c)  Petition  Refused.    If  the  Supreme  Court 
determines — after a response has been filed 
or  requested  —  that  the  court  of  appeals' 
judgment  is  correct  and  that  the  legal 
principles  announced  in  the  opinion  are 
likewise  correct,  the  Court  will  refuse  the 
petition  with  the  notation  “Refused.”  The 
court of appeals’ opinion in the case has the 
same precedential value as an opinion of the 
Supreme Court.

presumed  indigent  and  may  proceed 
without  advance  payment  of  costs  as 
provided in Rule 20.1.  

  (

  (

 

(c)  Amending the Notice. An amended notice of 
direct appeal correcting a defect or omission 
in an earlier filed notice may be filed with the 
Supreme  Court  at  any  time  before  the 
appellant’s brief is filed. The amended notice 
is  subject  to  being  struck  for  cause  on  the 
motion of any party affected by the amended 
notice. After the appellant’s brief is filed, the 
notice may be amended only on leave of the 
Supreme  Court  and  on  such  terms  as  the 
Supreme Court may prescribe.  
 

(d)  Other  Requirements.  Promptly  upon  filing 
the notice of direct appeal, appellant must file 
in the Supreme Court a docketing statement 
as provided in Rule 32.1 and pay all required 
fees authorized to be collected by the clerk of 
the Supreme Court. 
 

(e)  The  Appellate  Record.  Rules  34  and  35 
governing the appellate record apply to direct 
appeals to the Supreme Court. 

57.3.  Jurisdiction of Supreme Court 
 

(a)  Statement of Jurisdiction. The appellant must 
file  with  the  Supreme  Court  a  statement  of 
jurisdiction within ten days after the notice of 
appeal is filed with the trial court clerk. 
 

(b)  Contents  of  Statement.  The  statement  of 
jurisdiction  must  plainly  state  the  basis  for 
the  exercise  of  the  Supreme  Court’s  direct 
appeal  jurisdiction;  insofar  as  appropriate, 
follow the form and contents of a petition for 
review  prescribed  by  Rule  53;  and  conform 
to  the  length  requirements  prescribed  for  a 
petition for review by Rule 9.4. 
 

(c)  Response to Statement. An appellee may file 
a  response  to  the  appellant’s  statement  of 
jurisdiction challenging the exercise of direct 
appeal  jurisdiction  or  a  waiver  of  the 
response within ten days after the statement 
is filed with the Supreme Court. If filed, the 
response must, insofar as appropriate, follow 

record  and  all  papers  (except  for  documents  filed  in 
the Supreme Court) to the court of appeals clerk. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: The rule is from former 
Rule 133. Subdivision 56.3 regarding settled cases is 
added. 
 

Comment  to  2002  change:  Subdivision  56.3  is

Rule 57. Direct Appeals to the Supreme Court 

7.1.  Application 

Except when inconsistent with a statute, this rule 
governs direct appeals to the Supreme Court that are 
authorized by the Constitution and by statute. 

7.2.  Perfecting Direct Appeal 

(a)  Notice of Direct Appeal.  A direct appeal to 
the  Supreme  Court  authorized  by  law  is 
perfected  when  a  written  notice  of  direct 
appeal is filed with the trial court clerk.  The 
notice  of  direct  appeal  must  be  filed  within 
the time provided by Rule 26.1 or as extended 
by  Rule  26.3.  The  trial  court  clerk  must 
immediately  send  a  copy  of  the  notice  of 
direct  appeal  to  the  clerk  of  the  Supreme 
Court.  If  a  notice  of  direct  appeal  is 
mistakenly  filed with  the  Supreme  Court or 
the  court  of  appeals,  the  notice  is  deemed 
filed the same day with the trial court clerk, 
and the Supreme Court clerk or the court of 
appeals’  clerk  must  immediately  send  the 
trial court clerk a copy of the notice.  
 

(b)  Contents  of  Notice.  The  notice  of  direct 

appeal must: 

1)  identify  the  trial  court  and  state  the 
case’s trial court number and style; 
 

(2)  state  the  date  of  the  judgment  or  order 

appealed from; 

3)  state that the party desires to take a direct 

appeal to the Supreme Court; 

4)  state  the  name  of  each  party  filing  the 

notice;  

5)  specify the law or laws under which the

controlling  Supreme  Court  precedent.  The  Supreme 
Court may decline to answer the questions certified to 
it. 

8.2.  Contents of the Certification Order 

An order from the certifying court must set forth:  

(a)  the questions of law to be answered; and 

b)  a stipulated statement of all facts relevant to 
the  questions  certified,  showing  fully  the 
nature  of  the  controversy  in  which  the 
questions arose. 

8.3.  Transmission of Certification Order 

The clerk of the certifying court must send to the 

clerk of the Supreme Court of Texas the following: 
 

(a)  the  certification  order  under  the  certifying 

court’s official seal; 

b)  a list of the names of all parties to the pending 
case,  giving  the  address  and  telephone 
number, 
if  known,  of  any  party  not 
represented by counsel; and 

c)  a    list    of    the    names,    addresses,    and  
telephone numbers of counsel for each party.

8.4.  Transmission of Record 

The  certifying  court  should  not  send  the 
Supreme Court of Texas the record in the pending case 
with the certification order. The Supreme Court may 
later require the original or copies of all or part of the 
record before the certifying court to be filed with the 
Supreme Court clerk.

7.4.  Preliminary Ruling on Probable Jurisdiction; 
Dismissal of Appeal 
 

The  Supreme  Court  may  determine  whether  the 
Court has probable jurisdiction based on the statement 
of jurisdiction and any response. If the Supreme Court 
determines  that  it  does  not  have  or  will  not  exercise 
jurisdiction over a direct appeal, the Court will dismiss 
the appeal. 

7.5.  Direct Appeal Exclusive While Pending 

If a direct appeal to the Supreme Court is filed, the 
parties  to  the  appeal  must  not,  while  that  appeal  is 
pending, pursue an appeal to the court of appeals. But 
if the direct appeal is dismissed, any party may pursue 
any other appeal available at the time when the direct 
appeal was filed. The other appeal must be perfected 
within 15 days after dismissal of the direct appeal or 
the date of the Supreme Court’s ruling on a timely filed 
motion for rehearing. 

 

57.6.  Determination of Direct Appeal 
 

(a)  Ruling  on  Merits.  If  the  Supreme  Court 
determines  that  it  has  probable  jurisdiction, 
the Court: 

(1)  may request full briefing under Rule 55; 

(2)  may  set  the  case  for  submission  under 

Rule 59; and 

(3)  may  render 

judgment  or  make  an 

appropriate order under Rule 60. 

(b)  Rehearing.  A  motion  for  rehearing  may  be 
filed with the Supreme Court clerk within 15 
days  after  the  Court  renders  judgment  or 
makes an order disposing of the direct appeal. 
The  motion  must  clearly  state  the  issues 
relied on for rehearing.  

Notes and Comments 

Comment  to  1997  change:  This  is  former  Rule 
140. The rule is amended without substantive change 
except subdivision 57.5 is amended to make clear that 
no party to the direct appeal may pursue the appeal in 
the court of appeals while the direct appeal is pending, 
but allowing 10 days to perfect a subsequent appeal.

Notes and Comments 

Comment  to  1997  change:  This  is  former  Rule 
114.  The  rule  is  substantially  revised,  but  no 
substantive  change  in  procedure  is  intended,  except 
subdivision 58.10 now allows a motion for rehearing. 

Rule 59. Submission and Argument 

9.1.  Submission Without Argument 

If  at  least  six  members  of  the  Court  so  vote,  a 
petition may be granted and an opinion handed down 
without oral argument. 

9.2.  Submission With Argument 

If the Supreme Court decides that oral argument 
would  aid  the  Court,  the  Court  will  set  the  case  for 
argument.    The  clerk  will  notify  all  parties  of  the 
submission date. 

9.3.  Purpose of Argument 

Oral argument should emphasize and clarify the 
written  arguments  in  the  briefs.  Counsel  should  not 
merely  read  from  a  prepared  text.  Counsel  should 
assume that all Justices have read the briefs before oral 
argument  and  should  be  prepared  to  respond  to  the 
Justices’ questions. 

9.4.  Time for Argument 

Each  side  is  allowed  only  as  much  time  as  the 
Court  orders.  Counsel  is  not  required  to  use  all  the 
allotted  time.  On  motion  filed  before  the  day  of 
argument,  the  Court  may  extend  the  time  for 
argument.  The  Court  may  also  align  the  parties  for 
purposes of presenting argument. 

9.5.  Number of Counsel 

Generally, only one counsel should argue for each 
side.  Except  on  leave  of  court  ,  no  more  than  two 
counsel on each side may argue. Only one counsel may 
argue in rebuttal.

8.6.  Notice 

If  the  Supreme  Court  agrees  to  answer  the 
questions certified to it, the Court will notify all parties 
and  the  certifying  court.    The  Supreme  Court  clerk 
must  also  send  a  notice  to  the  Attorney  General  of 
Texas if: 
 

(a)  the constitutionality of a Texas statute is the 
subject  of  a  certified  question  that  the 
Supreme Court has agreed to answer; and 

b)  the  State  of  Texas  or  an  officer,  agency,  or 
employee  of  the  state  is  not  a  party  to  the 
proceeding in the certifying court. 

8.7.  Briefs and Oral Argument 

(a)  Briefs. The appealing party in the certifying 
court must file a brief with the Supreme Court 
clerk  within  30  days  after  the  date  of  the 
notice.  Opposing  parties  must  file  an 
answering  brief  within  20  days  after 
receiving  the  opening  brief.  Briefs  must 
comply  with  Rule  55  to  the  extent  its 
provisions apply. On motion complying with 
Rule 10.5(b), either before or after the brief is 
due, the Supreme Court may extend the time 
to file a brief. 

b)  Oral  Argument.  Oral  argument  may  be 
granted either on a party's request or on the 
Court's own initiative. Argument is governed 
by Rule 59.

8.8.  Intervention by the State 

If  the  constitutionality  of  a  Texas  statute  is  the 
subject of a certified question that the Supreme Court 
has agreed to answer the State of Texas may intervene 
at any reasonable time for briefing and oral argument 
(if  argument

8.9.  Opinion on Certified Questions 

If  the  Supreme  Court  has  agreed  to  answer  a 
certified question, it will hand down an opinion as in 
any other case.

overruled, the Supreme Court clerk must send to the 
certifying  court  the  written  opinion  on  the  certified

Rule 60. Judgments in the Supreme Court 

0.1.  Announcement of Judgments 

When  affirming,  modifying,  or  rendering  a 
judgment against the party who was the appellant in 
the court of appeals, the Supreme Court must render 
judgment  against 
that  party's 
supersedeas bond, if any, for the performance of the 
judgment. If the Supreme Court taxes costs against the 
party who was the appellant in the court of appeals, the 
Court must render judgment for those costs against the

or  in  part  and  render  the  judgment  that  the 
lower court should have rendered; 

d)  reverse  the  lower  court’s  judgment  and

Comment to 1997 change: Former Rules 180 and 
182(a) are merged.   Subdivision 60.1 is from former 
Rule 181. Paragraphs 60.2(b), (e), and (f) are new but 
codify current practice. Subdivision 60.6 is new. Other 
changes are made.

dismiss the case; or 

f)  vacate  the  lower  court’s  judgment  and

When  reversing  the  court  of  appeals'  judgment, 
the  Supreme  Court  may,  in  the  interest  of  justice, 
remand the case to the trial court even if a rendition of 
judgment is otherwise appropriate. 

0.4.  Judgment for Costs 

The Supreme Court’s judgment will award to the 
prevailing party the costs incurred by that party in the 
Supreme Court.   If appropriate, the judgment may also 
award  the  prevailing  party  the  costs  —  including 
preparation  costs  for  the  record  —  incurred  by  that 
party in the court of appeals and in the trial court. But 
the Court may tax costs otherwise as required by law

(b)  probably  prevented    the    petitioner    from

1.2.  Error Affecting Only Part of the Case 

If the error affects a part, but not all, of the matter 
in  controversy,  and  that  part  is  separable  without 
unfairness  to  the  parties,  the  judgment  must  be 
reversed  and  a  new  trial  ordered  only  as  to  the  part 
affected  by  the  error.  The  Court  may  not  order  a 
separate  trial  solely  on  unliquidated  damages  if 
liability is contested.

4.1.  Time for Filing 

A  motion  for  rehearing  may  be  filed  with  the 
Supreme  Court  clerk  within  15  days  from  the  date 
when the Court renders judgment or makes an order 
disposing  of  a  petition  for  review.  In  exceptional 
cases,  if  justice  requires,  the  Court  may  shorten  the

The motion must specify the points relied on for 

4.3.  Response and Decision 

No  response  to  a  motion  for  rehearing  need  be 
filed unless the Court so requests.  A motion will not 
be  granted  unless  a  response  has  been  filed  or 
requested  by  the  Court.  But  in  exceptional  cases,  if 
justice so requires, the Court may deny the right to file 
a response and act on a motion any time after it is filed. 

4.4.  Second Motion 

The Court will not consider a second motion for 
rehearing  unless  the  Court  modifies  its  judgment,

1.4.    Remediable  Error  of  the  Trial  Court  or 

Court of Appeals 
 

(a)  Generally.  The  Supreme  Court  will  not 
affirm  or  reverse  a  judgment  or  dismiss  a

on motion of any party or on its own initiative, after 
notice  and  a  reasonable  opportunity  for  response  — 
award  to  each  prevailing  party  just  damages.  In

SECTION FIVE: PROCEEDINGS IN THE 
COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS 
 
Rule 66. Discretionary Review in General 

6.1.  With or Without Petition 

The  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  may  review  a 
court of appeals' decision in a criminal case on its own 
initiative under Rule 67 or on the petition of a party 
under Rule 68. 

6.2.  Not a Matter of Right 

Discretionary  review  by  the  Court  of  Criminal 
Appeals  is  not  a  matter  of  right,  but  of  the  Court's 
discretion. 

6.3.  Reasons for Granting Review 

While neither controlling nor fully measuring the 
Court  of  Criminal  Appeals'  discretion,  the  following 
will be considered by the Court in deciding whether to 
grant discretionary review: 
 

(a)  whether a court of appeals' decision conflicts 
with another court of appeals' decision on the 
same issue; 

b)  whether  a  court  of  appeals  has  decided  an 
important question of state or federal law that 
has  not  been,  but  should  be,  settled  by  the 
Court of Criminal Appeals; 
 

(c)  whether  a  court  of  appeals  has  decided  an 
important question of state or federal law in a 
way 
the  applicable 
decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeals or 
the Supreme Court of the United States; 

that  conflicts  with 

d)  whether  a  court  of  appeals  has  declared  a 
regulation,  or  ordinance 
statute, 
rule, 
to  have 
unconstitutional,  or 
misconstrued  a  statute,  rule,  regulation,  or 
ordinance;

after the last date for filing a motion for rehearing.

Notes and Comments 

Comment  to  1997  change:  This  is  former  Rule 
190.  The  service  and  notice  provisions  of  former 
subdivisions  (b)  and  (c)  are  deleted.  See  Rule  9.5. 
Other changes are made. 
 

Comment  to  2008  change:  Subdivision  64.4  is 
amended to reflect the Court's practice of considering 
a  second  motion  for  rehearing  after  modifying  its 
judgment or opinion in response to a prior motion for 
rehearing.  When  the  Court  modifies  its  opinion 
without  modifying  its  judgment,  the  Court  will 
ordinarily deny a second motion for rehearing unless 
the  new  opinion  is  substantially  different  from  the 
original opinion. 

Rule 65. Enforcement of Judgment after Mandate 

5.1.  Statement of Costs 

The Supreme Court clerk will prepare, and send 
to  the  clerk  to  whom  the  mandate  is  directed,  a 
statement of costs showing: 
 

(a)  the  costs  that were  incurred in  the  Supreme 
Court,  with  a  notation  of  those  items  that 
have been paid and those that are owing; and 
 

(b)  the party or parties against whom costs have 

been adjudged. 

5.2.  Enforcement of Judgment 

If the Supreme Court renders judgment, the trial 
court need not make any further order. Upon receiving 
the Supreme Court's mandate, the trial court clerk must 
proceed  to  enforce  the  judgment  of  the  Supreme 
Court's as in any other case. Appellate court costs must 
be included with the trial court costs in any process to 
enforce  the  judgment.  If  all  or  part  of  the  costs  are 
collected, the trial court clerk must immediately remit 
to  the  appellate  court  clerk  any  amount  due  to  that 
clerk.

Court — may file with the clerk of the court of appeals 
an order staying  the  court  of  appeals'  mandate.    The 
order  must  be  signed  by  a  judge  of  the  Court  of 
Criminal Appeals. The clerk of the Court of Criminal 
Appeals must immediately send a copy of the order to 
the court of appeals clerk. 

7.3.  Time to Issue Mandate Extended 

Unless  otherwise  limited  in  the  order  itself,  an 
order staying the court of appeals' mandate under 67.2 
will extend for an additional 45 days the time before 
issuance of the court of appeals' mandate.   An order 
granting review prevents the issuance of the court of 
appeals'  mandate  pending  the  further  order  of  the 
Court of Criminal Appeals.  If four judges do not agree 
to grant review within that time the court of appeals 
clerk must issue the mandate. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment  to  1997  change:  This  is  former  Rule 
201. The rule is amended without substantive change. 
 

Comment to 2000 change: Language which was 
in the catchline of former Rule 201 has been deleted 
from  Rule  67.1,  to  restore  the  substance  of  the  rule, 
and to remove any implication that the court may not 
grant  review  on  its  own  motion  when  a  petition  for 
discretionary review has been filed. 

Rule 68. Discretionary Review With Petition 

On  petition  by  any  party,  the  Court  of  Criminal 
Appeals may review a court of appeals' decision in a 
criminal case. 

8.2.  Time to File Petition 

(a)  First  Petition.  The  petition  must  be  filed 
within 30 days after either the day the court 
of appeals' judgment was rendered or the day 
the last timely motion for rehearing or timely 
motion  for  en  banc  reconsideration  was 
overruled by the court of appeals. 

b)  Subsequent  Petition.  Even 

time 
specified  in  (a)  has  expired,  a  party  who 
otherwise  may  file  a  petition  may  do  so 
within  10  days  after  the  timely  filing  of 
another party's petition.

power of supervision. 

6.4.  Documents to Aid Decision 

(a)  Acquiring    Documents.    The    Court    of  
Criminal  Appeals  —  or  any  judge  of  the 
Court — may order the court of appeals clerk 
to promptly  send  the following  items  to  the 
Court in order to aid it in deciding whether to 
grant discretionary review: 

1)  the appellate record; 

2)  a  copy  of  the  opinions  of  the  court  of 

appeals;  

3)  a copy of the motions filed in the court 

 

of appeals; and 

4)  certified copies of any judgment or order 

of the court of appeals. 

(b)  Return of Documents. If discretionary review 
is  not  granted,  the  clerk  of  the  Court  of 
Criminal  Appeals  will  return  the  appellate 
record to the court of appeals clerk.

Rule 67. Discretionary Review Without Petition 

7.1.  Four Judges' Vote 

By  a  vote  of  at  least  four  judges,  the  Court  of 
Criminal  Appeals  may  grant  review  of  a  court  of 
appeals' decision in a criminal case at any time before

a  table  of  contents  with  references  to  the 
pages  of  the  petition.  The  table  of  contents 
must  indicate  the  subject  matter  of  each 
ground or question presented for review. 

c)  Index  of  Authorities.  The  petition  must 
include  an  index  of  authorities  arranged 
alphabetically and indicating the pages of the 
petition where the authorities are cited. 

d)  Statement  Regarding  Oral  Argument.  The 
petition  must  include  a  short  statement  of 
why  oral  argument  would  be  helpful,  or  a 
statement that oral argument is waived. If a 
reply  or  cross-petition  is  filed,  it  likewise 
must  include  a  statement  of  why  oral 
argument should or should not be heard. 

e)  Statement of the Case. The petition must state 
briefly the nature of the case. This statement 
should seldom exceed half a page. The details 
of the case should be reserved and stated with 
the pertinent grounds or questions. 

f)  Statement  of  Procedural  History.  The 

petition must state:

and appellate counsel. 

1)  the  date  any  opinion  of  the  court  of 
appeals was handed down, or the date of

disposing of the case without an opinion; 

 

 

(2)  the  date  any  motion  for  rehearing  was 
filed (or a statement that none was filed); 
and 

(3)  the  date  the  motion  for  rehearing  was 
overruled or otherwise disposed of. 

  (

 

(g)  Grounds for Review. The petition must state 
briefly,  without  argument,  the  grounds  on 
which the petition is based. The grounds must 
be separately numbered. If the petitioner has 
access to the record, the petitioner must (after 
each ground) refer to the page of the record 
where  the  matter  complained  of  is  found. 
Instead  of  listing  grounds  for  review,  the 
petition may contain the questions presented 
for  review,  expressed  in  the  terms  and 
the  case  but  without 
circumstances  of 
unnecessary  detail.  The 
statement  of 
questions  should  be  short  and  concise,  not 
argumentative or repetitious. 

(c)  Extension  of  Time.    The  Court  of  Criminal 
Appeals may extend the time to file a petition 
for  discretionary  review  if  a  party  files  a 
motion complying with Rule 10.5(b) no later 
than 15 days after the last day for filing the 
petition. The Court of Criminal Appeals may 
extend the time to file a response or reply if a 
party  files  a  motion  complying  with  Rule 
10.5(b) either before or after the response or 
reply is due.

Comment to 2011 change: Rule 68.3 is changed 
to require petitions for discretionary review to be filed 
in  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  rather  than  in  the 
court of appeals.  With the deletion of Rule 50, there 
is  no  reason  to  file  petitions  in  the  court  of  appeals.  
Rule  68.3(b)  is  added  to  address  and  prevent  the 
untimely  filing  of  petitions  for  discretionary  review 
that are incorrectly filed in the court of appeals rather 
than in the Court of Criminal Appeals. 

8.4.  Contents of Petition 

A  petition  for  discretionary  review  must  be  as 
brief as possible. It must be addressed to the “Court of 
Criminal Appeals of Texas” and must state the name 
of the party or parties applying for review. The petition 
must contain the following items: 
 

(a)  Identity of Judge, Parties, and Counsel. The 
petition  must  list  the  trial  court  judge,  all 
parties  to  the  judgment  or  order  appealed 
from, and the names and addresses of all trial

Appeals since the petition is also filed in the Court of 
Criminal Appeals. 

h)  Argument. The petition must contain a direct 
and  concise  argument,  with  supporting 
authorities,  amplifying 
for 
granting review. See Rule 66.3.   The court of 
appeals' opinions will be considered with the

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 2011 change: This Rule is changed 
to reflect the filing of the petition and any reply in the 
Court  of  Criminal  Appeals.  Thus,  the  rule  is  also 
changed to require a motion and to delete a time frame 
because  the  petition  will  be  filed  in  the  Court  of 
Criminal Appeals. 

Rule 69. Action of Court on Petition for 
Discretionary Review and After Granting Review 

9.1.  Granting or Refusal

notation that discretionary review is granted. 

9.2.  Setting Case for Submission 

If  discretionary  review  is  granted,  either  on  the 
petition of a party or by the Court on its own initiative, 
the case will be set for submission. 

9.3.  Improvident Grant of Review

refuses or dismisses a petition, the clerk will 
send to the parties and the State Prosecuting 
Attorney  a  notice  informing  them  that  the 
petition was refused or dismissed. The clerk 
will  retain  the  petition  and  all  other  items 
filed in the case for at least 15 days from the 
date of the refusal or dismissal. At the end of 
that time, if no motion for rehearing has been 
timely  filed,  or  upon  the  overruling  or 
dismissal  of  such  a  motion,  the  clerk  will 
send to the court of appeals clerk a certified 
copy of the order refusing or dismissing the 
petition  (as  well  as  any  order  overruling  a 
motion for rehearing). The clerk of the Court 
of Criminal Appeals will return the appellate 
record to the court of appeals clerk but will 
retain the petition, and other documents filed 
in the Court of Criminal Appeals. 
 

(b)  On   Granting   Review. If   the   Court   grants 
discretionary  review,  the  clerk  will  send  to 
the parties and the State Prosecuting Attorney 
a  notice  informing  them  that  discretionary 
review was granted.

the  granting,  refusal,  or  dismissal  of  a  petition  for 
discretionary  review.  Other  nonsubstantive  changes 
are made.

Appeals a motion to supplement the record in the trial 
court.    In  this  motion,  the  party  should  describe  the 
evidence  the  party  intends  to  file,  explain  its 
evidentiary  value,  and  state  why  the  evidence  could 
not have been filed in the trial court before the Court 
of Criminal Appeals filed and set the application for 
submission.    The  moving  party  must  immediately 
serve copies of the motion and the evidence the party 
seeks to file on the other party or parties in the case.  If 
the Court of Criminal Appeals grants the motion, the 
party may file the evidence with the district clerk of 
the county of conviction, and should attach a copy of 
the  motion  to supplement  and  the  Court of  Criminal 
Appeals’ order granting said motion.  The district clerk 
shall immediately send a copy of the filed materials to 
the trial judge assigned to the habeas case and to the 
other party or parties in the case, and otherwise comply

rules.   

b) If the Court of Criminal Appeals has received 
an Article 11.07 or 11.071 application from the district 
clerk of the county of conviction, but the Court has not 
yet  filed  and  set  the  application  for  submission,  the 
party  must  file  in  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  a 
motion  to  stay  the  proceedings  pending  the  filing  of 
the evidence in the trial court.  In this motion, the party 
should describe the evidence the party intends to file 
and explain its evidentiary value.  The moving party 
must immediately serve copies of the motion and the 
evidence the party seeks to file on the other party or 
parties in the case.  If the Court of Criminal Appeals 
grants the motion, the Court will specify a designated 
time frame for the party to file the evidence with the 
district clerk of the county of conviction.  The party 
should attach a copy of the motion to stay proceedings 
and the Court of Criminal Appeals’ order granting said 
motion to the evidentiary filing.  The district clerk of 
the  county  of  conviction  shall  immediately  send  a 
copy of the filed materials to the trial judge assigned 
to the habeas case and to the other party or parties in 
the case, and otherwise comply with the procedures set 
out in Rule 73.4(b) of these rules.

review  of  the  application  or  may  issue  such  other 
instructions or orders as may be appropriate.

to consider evidence not filed in the trial court, then 
the party must comply with the following procedures 
or the evidence will not be considered. 

a) If the Court of Criminal Appeals has received 
an Article 11.07 or 11.071 application from the district 
clerk of the county of conviction and has filed and set 
the  application  for  submission,  a  party  has  two 
options: 

1) The party may file the evidence directly in the 
Court of Criminal Appeals with a motion for the Court 
of Criminal Appeals to consider the evidence.  In this 
motion,  the  party  should  describe  the  evidence, 
explain 
its  evidentiary  value,  and  state  why 
compelling and extraordinary circumstances exist for 
the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  to  consider  the 
evidence  directly.

any special motion in the Court of Criminal Appeals 
or the trial court.  But the district clerk of the county 
of conviction still must immediately send a copy of the

omment to 2018 change: Rules 73.1 and 73.4 are 
amended in conjunction with amendments to the form 
for applications filed under Article 11.07 of the Code 
of Criminal Procedure (Appendix E to these rules) and 
the  Clerk’s  Summary  Sheet  (Appendix  F  to  these 
rules).  The  amendments  clarify  terminology  and 
procedures  for  filing  Article  11.07  writ  applications 
and update the Article 11.07 writ application form to 
incorporate 
filing 
procedures.  The  application  form  will  be  made 
available on the internet through the Court of Criminal 
Appeals’ website. In addition, the amendments bring 
the application and filing procedures into conformity 
with Civil Practice and Remedies Code chapter 132, 
which  permits  both  inmates  and  non-inmates  to  file 
unsworn  declarations  in  lieu  of  notarized  oaths. 
Further,  the  rules  amendments  and  changes  to  the 
clerk’s  summary  sheet  clarify  the  information  that 
district clerks must provide to the Court of Criminal 
Appeals and add a new requirement that clerks certify 
that they have complied with all the requirements of 
Rule  73.4,  including  the  requirement  to  serve  on  all 
parties in the case all objections, motions, affidavits, 
exhibits, proposed findings of fact and conclusions of 
law, findings of fact and conclusions of law, and any 
other  orders  entered  or  pleadings  filed  in  the  habeas 
case.  The  phrase  “all  parties  in  the  case”  as  used  in 
Rule  73.4  includes:    the  attorney  representing  the 
State;  the  applicant  (including  pro  se  and  inmate 
applicants);  and,  if  the  applicant  is  represented  by 
counsel, applicant’s attorney.

89 

 

 

Any party may file a motion for rehearing within 
15 days after the opinion is handed down. The motion 
must clearly state the points relied on for the rehearing. 
No reply to a motion for rehearing need be filed unless 
the  Court  so  requests.  The  Court  will  not  grant  a 
motion for rehearing unless a response has been filed 
or requested. 

4.10. Answering Certified Questions 

After  all  motions  for  rehearing  have  been 
overruled, the clerk of the Court of Criminal Appeals 
must send to the certifying court the written opinion 
on the certified questions. The opinion must be under 
the Court of Criminal Appeals' seal. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment  to  1997  change:  This  is  former  Rule 
214. The rule is amended without substantive change. 
 

Rule 75. Notification; Oral Argument 

Oral  argument  will  be  permitted  only  in  cases 
designated  by  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals.  If  the 
Court permits argument in a case, the clerk will notify 
the parties of the date set for argument.  If a case will 
be  submitted without  argument,  the  clerk will  notify 
the parties of the date of submission. The clerk must 
use  all  reasonable  diligence  to  notify  counsel  of 
settings, but counsel's failure to receive notice will not 
necessarily  prevent  argument  or  submission  of  the 
case on the day it is set. 

5.2.  Request for Argument 

If a case is not designated for oral argument but 
counsel desires oral argument, counsel may — within 
30 days of the date of the clerk's notice — petition the 
Court  to  allow  oral  argument.  This  petition  must 
contain specific reasons why oral argument is desired. 

5.3.  Oral Argument 

Unless  extended  in  a  special  case,  the  total 
maximum  time  for  oral  argument  is  20  minutes  per 
side. Counsel for the appellant or petitioner is entitled 
to open and conclude the argument.  Counsel should 
not  read  at  length  from  the  briefs,  records,  or 
authorities.    Counsel  may  orally  correct  a  brief,  but 
multiple  additional  citations  should  not  be  given 
orally;  instead,  these  citations  should  be  filed  in 
writing with the clerk.

The certifying court should not send to the Court 
of  Criminal  Appeals  the  record  in  the  pending  case 
with  the  certification  order.  The  Court  of  Criminal 
Appeals may later require the original or copies of all 
or part of the record before the certifying court to be 
filed with the Court of Criminal Appeals clerk. 

4.5.  Notice 

If the Court of Criminal Appeals agrees to answer 
the  questions  certified  to  it,  the  Court  will  notify  all 
parties and the certifying court. The Court of Criminal 
Appeals clerk must also send a notice to the Attorney 
General of Texas if: 
 

(a)  the constitutionality of a Texas statute is the 
subject of a certified question that the Court 
of  Criminal  Appeals  has  agreed  to  answer; 
and 

b)  the  State  of  Texas  or  an  officer,  agency,  or 
employee  of  the  State  is  not  a  party  to  the 
proceeding in the certifying court. 

(a)  Briefs.  The appealing party in the certifying 
court  must  file  a  brief  with  the  clerk  of  the 
Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  within  30  days 
after the date of the notice.  Opposing parties 
must file an answering brief within 15 days 
of  receiving  the  opening  brief.  Briefs  must 
comply  with  Rule  38  to  the  extent  that  its 
provisions apply. 

b)  Oral  Argument.  Oral  argument  may  be 
granted either on a party's request or on the 
Court's own initiative. Argument is governed 
by Rule 39. 

4.7.  Intervention by the State 

If  the  constitutionality  of  a  Texas  statute  is  the 
subject  of  a  certified  question  that  the  Court  of 
Criminal  Appeals  has  agreed  to  answer,  the  State  of 
Texas  may  intervene  at  any  reasonable  time  for 
briefing and oral argument (if argument is allowed) on 
the question of constitutionality. 

4.8.  Opinion on Certified Question 

If  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  has  agreed  to 
answer  a  certified  question,  it  will  hand  down  an 
opinion as in any other case.

Rule 77. Opinions 

7.1.  Generally 

In each case that is argued or submitted without 
argument to the Court of Criminal Appeals, the Court 
will  hand  down  a  written  opinion  setting  forth  the 
reasons  for  its  decision  and  any  germane  precedent.  
Any  judge  may  file  an  opinion  dissenting  from  or 
concurring in the Court's judgment. 

7.2.  Signing; Publication

9.3.  Amendments 

8.3.  Other Orders 

The  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  may  make  any 
other  appropriate  order  required  by  the  law  and  the 
nature of the case. 
 

Notes and Comments 

9.4.  Decision 

Comment to 1997 change: The rule is new. 

A motion for rehearing may be amended anytime 
before the period allowed for filing the motion expires, 
and with leave of the court, anytime before the Court 
decides the motion. 

If the Court grants rehearing, the case will be set 
for submission.  Oral argument may, but normally will 
not, be permitted. 

9.5. Further Motion for Rehearing 

The Court will not consider a second motion for 
rehearing  after  rehearing  is  denied.    If  rehearing  is 
granted  and  the  Court  delivers  an  opinion  on 
rehearing,  a  party  may  file  a  further  motion  for 
rehearing. 

9.6.  Extension of Time 

The Court may extend the time for filing a motion 
or  a  further  motion  for  rehearing  if  a  party  files  a 
motion complying with Rule 10.5(b) within the time 
for filing a motion or further motion for rehearing. 

9.7.  Service 

The requirements of Rule 80.1 apply. 

Notes and Comments 

Comment  to  1997  change:  This  is  former  Rule 
230, and the portion of former Rule 213 hat prohibited 
motions for rehearing. The Court may now permit oral 
argument  after  granting  rehearing,  although  it  is 
disfavored. A further  motion  for rehearing may now 
be filed by any party, rather than only the losing party. 
Other nonsubstantive changes are made.  
 

Rule 80. State Prosecuting Attorney 

80.1.  Service on State Prosecuting Attorney 

The State Prosecuting Attorney must be served on 
every petition for discretionary review or brief filed by 
any  party  or  amicus  curiae  in  the  Court  of  Criminal 
Appeals,  including  replies,  responses,  amendments, 
and supplements.  
 

Notes and Comments 

Rule 79. Rehearings 

9.1.  Motion for Rehearing 

A  motion  for  rehearing  may  be  filed  with  the 
Court of Criminal Appeals clerk within 15 days from 
the date of the judgment or order. In exceptional cases, 
if  justice  requires,  the  Court  may  shorten  the  time 
within which the motion may be filed or even deny the 
right to file it altogether. 

9.2.  Contents 

(a)  The motion must briefly and distinctly state 
the  grounds  and  arguments  relied  on  for 
rehearing. 

b)  A  motion  for  rehearing  an  order  that  grants 

discretionary review may not be filed. 

c)  A motion for rehearing an order that refuses 
a  petition  for  discretionary  review  may  be 
grounded  only  on  substantial  intervening 
circumstances  or  on  other 
significant 
circumstances  which  are  specified  in  the 
motion. Counsel must certify that the motion 
is so grounded and that the motion is made in 
good faith and not for delay. 

d)  A motion for rehearing an order that denies 
habeas  corpus  relief  or  dismisses  a  habeas 
corpus  application  under  Code  of  Criminal 
Procedure, articles 11.07 or 11.071, may not 
be filed. The Court may on its own initiative 
reconsider the case.

Notes and Comments 

Comment  to  2011  change:  Rule  79.2(c)  is

Comment to 2019 change: This rule incorporates 
 
and expands former Rule 68.11 to require service on 
the  State  Prosecuting  Attorney  of  all  petitions  for 
discretionary review and all substantive briefing in the 
Court of Criminal Appeals. In using the phrase “brief 
filed  by  any  party  or  amicus  curiae  in  the  Court  of 
Criminal Appeals,” the rule does not intend to require 
service on the State Prosecuting Attorney of petitions 
for a writ of mandamus (or responses) or applications 
for  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus  (or  answers)  and  their 
accompanying memoranda. However, if the Court of 
Criminal  Appeals  has  filed  and  set  a  mandamus 
petition  or  habeas  corpus  application,  the  rule  does 
require  service  on  the  State  Prosecuting  Attorney  of 
the briefs filed in the case.

ORDER REGARDING DISPOSITION OF COURT PAPERS IN CIVIL CASES 

ORDERED that:  

A.  Definitions.  

1.  Court records or records means:  

(a)  the clerk’s record; 

(b)  the reporter’s record; and  

(c)  any other documents or items filed, or presented for filing and received in an appellate 

court in a particular case. 

B. 
courts of appeals:  

2.  Appellate record means the clerk’s record and the reporter’s record and any supplements.  

In  the  Courts of  Appeals.  The  following  paragraphs  govern  disposing  of  court  records by  the 

1. 

Determination  of  permanent  preservation.  Before  any  court  records  are  destroyed,  the 
court of appeals must—under Section 51.205 of the Government Code and State Archives guidelines—
determine whether the records should be permanently preserved.  

2. 

Initial  determination.  Immediately  after  final  disposition  of  an  appeal  or  other 
proceeding,  the  panel  that  decided  the  case  must  determine  whether  the  case’s  records  should  be 
permanently  preserved  and  must  file  with  the  records  a  statement  declaring  that  the  records  should  or 
should not be permanently preserved.  

3. 

Later  determination.  After  its  initial  determination,  but  before  any  court  records  are 
destroyed,  the  court  of  appeals  may  reexamine  its  initial  determination  under  2.  and  may  change  its 
designation.  

4. 

Original  papers  and  exhibits  in  appeals.  Whatever  the  court  determines  concerning 
permanent preservation of a case’s records, any original documents or exhibits must, within 30 days after 
final disposition of an appeal or other proceeding, be returned to the trial court in accordance with any 
trial court order entered under Rules 34.5(f) and 34.6(g). The court of appeals may, but need not, copy 
those documents and exhibits before returning them to the trial court. The court of appeals may dispose of 
copies of nondocumentary exhibits after the case is final on appeal.  

All other papers and exhibits. Subject to paragraph 4., the court of appeals must keep and 

preserve all records of a case (except duplicates) until they are ultimately disposed of under this rule.  

Ultimate  disposition.  After  the  period  prescribed  by  Section  51.204  of  the  Government 

Code or other applicable statute has expired, the court of appeals must:  

5. 

6. 

(a)  destroy those records the court has determined need not be permanently preserved; and  

(b)  turn over to the State Archives or other repository allowed by law those records the court 

has determined should be permanently preserved.  

 

Supreme Court:  

C.  In  the  Supreme  Court.  The  following  paragraphs  govern  disposing  of  court  records  by  the 

1. 

If case reversed and remanded to court of appeals. If the Supreme Court grants review 
and remands the case to the court of appeals, the Supreme Court will return the appellate record to the 
court  of  appeals.  The  court  of  appeals  will  then  dispose  of  the  court  records  in  accordance  with 
subdivision  B. The  Supreme  Court  will  keep and preserve all remaining  items  (except  duplicates) until 
they are turned over to the State Archives as provided by law.  

2. 

If  case  affirmed  or  reversed  and  remanded  to  trial  court.  If  the  Supreme  Court  grants 
review  and  either  affirms  the  court  of  appeals  or  reverses  and  remands  to  the  trial  court,  the  Supreme 
Court  will  not  return  the  appellate  record  but  will  keep  and  preserve  all  records  of  the  case  (except 
duplicates) until those records are turned over to the State Archives as provided by law.  

3. 

In all other cases. In all other cases, the Supreme court will return the appellate record to 
the court of appeals and keep and preserve all remaining records of the case (except duplicates) until they 
are turned over to the State Archives as provided by law.

DEFINITIONS 

1.  “Applicant” means a person seeking relief in an application for a writ of habeas corpus from his or her 
felony conviction imposing a sentence other than the death penalty or a probated sentence that has not 
been revoked. An applicant can be an inmate or a non-inmate whose liberty is restrained. 
 

2.  “Inmate” means a person who is in custody in a prison or jail. 

3.  “Petitioner” means a person, including an attorney or a non-attorney, presenting an application for a 

writ of habeas corpus on behalf of another person (the applicant). Any petitioner may present an 
application on behalf of an applicant for the purpose of obtaining relief from the applicant’s felony 
conviction. However, the petitioner presenting the application form must sign and attest that he or she 
has consulted with the applicant concerning the application and the applicant has given consent to the 
filing of this application form. 

INSTRUCTIONS 

All applicants and petitioners, including attorneys, must use the complete application form. You 
must use this application form, which begins on the page following these instructions, to file an 
application, or an amended or supplemental application, for a writ of habeas corpus seeking relief from 
a final felony conviction under Article 11.07 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. (This application 
form is not for death-penalty cases, probated sentences which have not been revoked, misdemeanors, or 
pretrial habeas applications under Article 11.08 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.) 

Failure to follow these instructions may cause your entire application to be dismissed. 

The district clerk of the county in which you were convicted will make this application form available to 
you, on request, without charge. The form can also be obtained from the Court of Criminal Appeals’ 
website.  

You must file the entire application form, including those sections that do not apply to you. If any pages 
are missing from the form, or if the questions have been renumbered or omitted, your entire application 
may be dismissed as non-compliant. 

You must make a separate application on a separate form for each case number from which you seek 
relief. Even if the judgments were entered in the same court on the same day, you must complete a 
separate application form for each case number. If a case number has multiple counts, include all the 
counts on one application form.

material fact.

(18)  Beginning on page 6, state concisely every legal ground for why you think that you 
are being illegally confined or restrained and then briefly summarize the facts 
supporting each ground. You must present each ground and a brief summary of the 
facts on the application form. If your grounds and a brief summary of the facts have 
not been presented on the application form, the Court will not consider your 
grounds. A factual summary that merely references an attached memorandum or 
another ground for relief will not constitute a sufficient summary of the facts. 

If you have more than four grounds, use pages 14 and 15 of the application form, 
which you may copy as many times as needed to give you a separate page for each 
ground, with each ground numbered in sequence. The recitation of the facts 
supporting each ground must be no longer than the two pages provided for the 
ground in the form. 

You may include with the application form a memorandum of law if you want to 
present legal authorities or provide greater factual detail, but the Court will not 
consider grounds for relief set out in a memorandum of law that were not raised on 
the application form. The memorandum of law must comply with Texas Rule of 
Appellate Procedure 73 and must not exceed 15,000 words if computer-generated or 
50 pages if not. If you are challenging the validity of your conviction, please include 
a summary of the facts pertaining to your offense and trial in your memorandum of 
law. 

If the application form does not include all of the grounds for relief, 
additional grounds brought at a later date may be procedurally barred.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
