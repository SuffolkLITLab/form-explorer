TEXAS JUDICIARY LEGISLATIVE UPDATE 
OFFICE OF COURT ADMINISTRATION 
TEXAS JUDICIAL COUNCIL 
                                                                                                        July 2015 

The 84th regular legislative session resulted in a number of new laws of interest to the judiciary, 

84th Legislature    

including laws:    

  Decriminalizing truancy and adding provisions on truant conduct to the Family Code 
  Providing alternatives to guardianship for incapacitated persons and amending various 

provisions regarding guardianships and incapacitated persons 

  Creating seven new district courts for Coryell, Ector, Kendall, Harris, Collin (2) and Fort 
Bend Counties, and five additional statutory county courts for Cameron (2), Collin, Fort 
Bend, and Harris Counties 

  Authorizing a special 3-judge district court for suits involving public school finance or 

legislative, congressional, or judicial redistricting 

  Revising procedures related to the civil commitment of sexually violent predators 
 

Increasing the electronic filing fee from $20 to $30 in civil cases in appellate, district, and 
county-level courts to allow eFiling funding to be sustainable 

  Establishing the Public Integrity Unit within the Texas Rangers Division of the 

Department of Public Safety 

  Clarifying that telephone interpreters can be used in all criminal law proceedings  
  Expanding the duties of the Office of Capital Writs to include representing defendants in 

cases involving forensic science issues 

  Revising procedures for impaneling a grand jury; eliminating the position of jury 

  Requiring the Supreme Court to promulgate forms for self-represented litigants in 

probate matters and residential landlord-tenant matters 

  Repealing the signature requirement for placement on the ballot for certain judicial 

commissioner 

offices 

  Creating several task forces and special advisory committees to study and review: 
exonerations of criminal defendants; the retention of juvenile records; improving 
outcomes of juveniles adjudicated of sexual offenses; collection and reporting of 
information regarding family violence, sexual assault, stalking, and human trafficking. 

This report briefly summarizes new legislation directly impacting the Texas court system, judges, clerks, 
and other judicial actors. No attempt is made to cover substantive areas of the law in detail; other 
entities are expected to provide legislative updates on substantive legal topics. We hope the report will 
be a useful resource for the judicial and legal community and all those interested in the administration 
of justice.

for guardianship must be sent if the proposed ward has no living spouse, parent, adult sibling, or adult 
child.  Authorizes the clerk to obtain from the court an order requiring that a person other than a 
guardian, attorney ad litem, or guardian ad litem provide security for costs for  filing an application, 
complaint, or opposition related to a guardianship proceeding.   Authorizes interested persons to 
intervene in a guardianship proceeding by filing a motion to intervene that is served on the parties, and 
prescribes the contents of the motion and the appropriate considerations for the court in exercising 
discretion to grant or deny the intervention.  Provides that a court may order that a ward’s cash, 
securities, and other assets be deposited in a financial institution for safekeeping, and reduce the 
guardian’s bond proportionately.   Amends the court-initiated guardianship provisions to provide that 
when a court appoints a guardian ad litem or investigator, the order must state that the person believed 
to be incapacitated may petition the court to have the appointment set aside, and that the 
incapacitated person must be provided an information letter at the initial meeting.  Provides that 
compensation for a guardian ad litem may be ordered from a management trust, in addition to the 
ward’s estate.  Requires written notice to a proposed ward if a request is made to a financial institution 
for a customer record in connection with a court-initiated investigation.  Expands the sources from 
which court costs of a guardianship proceeding may be paid, to include the guardianship estate, the 
management trust, or a party, and provides for payment out of the county treasury if there are 
insufficient assets in the ward’s estate and a party has provided an affidavit of inability to pay costs.  
Exempts certain persons and entities from a requirement to pay court costs, and provides criteria for 
proof of inability to pay costs.  Requires that criminal history information be obtained for a family 
member seeking a guardianship, in addition to other persons planning to represent the interest of a 
ward or guardian.  Authorizes the guardian who is required to file an annual report with the court to file 
an unsworn declaration instead of a sworn declaration or affidavit. Sets out the parameters regarding 
the term of a temporary guardian when a guardianship application is contested. Requirements regarding 
initial accounting by a trustee of a management trust, which currently apply only to a management trust 
created while a guardianship proceeding is still pending, are modified to also apply to a management 
trust for a ward with an existing guardianship. Allows a court to appoint an attorney ad litem or guardian 
ad litem to sell a minor’s property (up to a value of $100,000) on the minor’s behalf if the minor does 
not have a parent or managing conservator who is willing and able to do so.   

Adds to the list of customer records that may be obtained through discovery from a financial institution.

the need for a guardianship.   Authorizes the presiding judge of a statutory probate court and that 
court’s clerk to assume certain duties regarding assignment of visiting judges if a judge authorized to 
hear probate and guardianship matters is recused or disqualified.  See §§ 1023.005 and 1023.010, and 
Chapters 1051, 1052, 1053, 1054, 1055, 1101, 1102, 1104, 1155, 1163, 1203, 1251, 1253, 1301, 1351,

the ward; whether a court or state agency had found that the applicant abused, neglected, or exploited 
the ward; and the best interest of the ward.  Requires a guardian to inform certain relatives about 
circumstances regarding the ward’s health and residence, and about funeral arrangements upon the 
ward’s death (unless the relative provides a written request not to be notified.) Authorizes a motion, 
with required notice and the opportunity for a hearing, for a guardian to be relieved of the duty to 
provide notice to a relative under certain circumstances.  Prescribes factors that the court should

including application requirements and waiver of service of citation under certain circumstances.   
Exempts written wills executed in another state or country from certain Texas attestation and proof 
requirements. Clarifies that a court may not prohibit a person from either executing a new will or codicil 
or revoking an existing will.    Authorizes judicial modification or reformation of wills under certain 
circumstances on the petition of a personal representative, and gives the court discretion to conform a 
will as nearly as possible to the probable intent of the testator. Limits a court’s powers under other law
