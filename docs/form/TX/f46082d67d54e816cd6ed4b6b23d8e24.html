Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)8/2/2022  1:12:57PM211 Court of Criminal Appeals88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's StatementThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is the State’s highest appellate court for criminal matters. The Court has statewide, exclusive, final appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases. The Court consists of a Presiding Judge and eight Judges. Appellate Court Operations Typically, the Court disposes of more matters than any other appellate court in the country. During fiscal year 2021, the Court disposed of 7,719 matters. The Court’s mandatory caseload includes direct appeal of cases in which the death penalty has been imposed and post-conviction applications for writs of habeas corpus. Its discretionary caseload is comprised primarily of petitions from decisions by the State’s fourteen intermediate courts of appeals. Because of its large caseload, the Court has a large central staff. Currently, the Court has sixty-eight employees, three of whom are with Judicial Education. Each Judge has an executive assistant, a staff attorney, and a law clerk. In addition, the Court has a central staff, which consists of a General Counsel, seventeen attorneys, and one legal assistant. The Clerk’s Office consists of an appointed Clerk, a chief deputy clerk, four deputy clerks, a network specialist, one accountant, one records manager, and one assistant records manager. Judicial and Court Personnel Training The Court also administers Fund 540, the Judicial Court and Personnel Training Fund. The fund provides for the continuing education of judges of all levels, court personnel, prosecuting attorneys, criminal defense attorneys who represent indigents, public defenders, law enforcement officers, constables, law students, and staff. All grantees provide exemplary and highly rated training spanning the wide spectrum of topics pertaining to our system of justice. The specialized training topics include: mental health, innocence, and forensics. Currently, eight entities receive grant funds from this program. Three staff members oversee grant operations: one financial examiner, one program supervisor and one program manager. The staff positions within the Article IV Courts and Agencies require a unique level of skill. From attorneys, to clerks and interpreters, to researchers and IT professionals, the expertise needed to keep the third branch of government running is vast. Recruiting and retaining qualified staff is challenging, even more so with inflation at 8.6 percent and rising. In FY 2021, the Judiciary had the third highest turnover rate in the state by General Appropriations Act Article at 14.5 percent. Salaries within the judiciary are not keeping up with inflation and are not competitive with other agencies or the private sector. Over the past year, Article IV Courts and Agencies have noticed a concerning trend of positions remaining open for lengthy periods of time and a steep decline in qualified applicants. Some entities have resorted to paying for recruiting tools to get a small pool of qualified candidates. Salary compression is also a major issue, where out of necessity, positions are posted at higher salaries than what current employees are making. The Article IV Courts and Agencies request a 10 percent salary increase for staff to maintain and recruit a strong and experienced judicial workforce. Exceptional Items The Court requests the following exceptional items for Appellate Court Operations (fund 0001) for FY 2024-2025: Exceptional Item 1: Salary increases of $645,058 per year to achieve parity with the Texas Supreme Court.Exceptional Item 2: Ten percent across-the-board increase in salaries after adjustment under Exceptional Item 1. Page 1 of 21Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)8/2/2022  1:12:57PM211 Court of Criminal Appeals88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's StatementExceptional Item 3:Funding to increase training of Public Defenders in Texas. Exceptional Item 4: Funding for Judges projected salary step and longevity increases in FY 2025.The Court asks that Judicial Education (fund 0540) retain estimated spending authority and retain Rider 7 and Article 9 funds, related to mental health education. The Court appreciates the budget flexibility afforded the judiciary through exemptions from certain limitations, and through the ability to carry forward any unexpended balance within the biennium. These factors significantly enhance our management ability, and we request a continuation of these budget features. In order for the Court of Criminal Appeals to function efficiently, it is vital that the Office of Court Administration (OCA) be adequately funded. One of the critical services OCA has provided for the appellate courts and trial courts during this biennium is the ability to work remotely during the pandemic . Ensuring that OCA is appropriately funded and staffed is truly vital to the operation of the judiciary. Page 2 of 22ORGANIZATIONAL CHART

The Court of Criminal Appeals consists of eight Judges and one Presiding Judge. This Court has final appellate jurisdiction coextensive with the limits of the state, and its determinations shall be final, in all criminal cases of whatever grade, with such exceptions and under such regulations as may be provided in the Texas Constitution or prescribed by law. The appeal of all cases in which the death penalty has been assessed shall be to the Court of Criminal Appeals.  The appeal of all other criminal cases shall be to the Courts of Appeal as prescribed by law.  In addition, the Court of Criminal Appeals may, on its own motion, review a decision of a Court of Appeals in a criminal case as provided by law.  Discretionary review by the Court of Criminal Appeals is not a matter of right, but of sound judicial discretion.The main factor which drives this strategy is the need to attract and retain highly trained and knowledgeable staff to work on a challenging caseload.EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS  IMPACTING STRATEGY:STRATEGY BIENNIAL TOTAL - ALL FUNDSBase Spending (Est 2022 + Bud 2023)     Baseline Request (BL 2024 + BL 2025)BIENNIALCHANGE        EXPLANATION OF BIENNIAL CHANGE   $ Amount     Explanation(s) of Amount (must specify MOFs and FTEs)EXPLANATION OF BIENNIAL CHANGE (includes Rider amounts):$11,142,943 $11,142,943 $0 Total of Explanation of Biennial Change $0 3.A.

The Court of Criminal Appeals oversees the training program and adopts rules relating to the education and training of judges and court personnel of appellate, district, statutory county, constitutional county, and municipal courts, and justices of the peace and their staff, prosecuting attorneys and their staff and criminal defense lawyers who represent indigents and others.  The Court of Criminal Appeals provides funding in the form of grants to entities who conduct the education and training programs.  The Court of Criminal Appeals awards grants, audits the expenditure of funds provided, and tracks participation in the education and training programs.Many participants of the education and training programs have little or no prior experience in their offices or positions and they rely heavily on the information and materials provided to establish and maintain competency.  Judicial and Court Personnel training serves as a preventative so that fewer cases of judicial mishandling appear before the State's Judicial Conduct Commission, and also so that attorneys defending indigents may be properly and continuously trained.EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS  IMPACTING STRATEGY:STRATEGY BIENNIAL TOTAL - ALL FUNDSBase Spending (Est 2022 + Bud 2023)     Baseline Request (BL 2024 + BL 2025)BIENNIALCHANGE        EXPLANATION OF BIENNIAL CHANGE   $ Amount     Explanation(s) of Amount (must specify MOFs and FTEs)EXPLANATION OF BIENNIAL CHANGE (includes Rider amounts):$25,068,658 $25,068,658 $0 Total of Explanation of Biennial Change $0 3.A.

The programs are designed to follow a master 
strategic plan to assist criminal justice 
stakeholders in identifying, assessing, and 
providing proper treatment for alleged 
offenders with mental health conditions.  The 
program will encompass an appreciation for 
mental health disorders, treatment options 
and legislative enactments designed to 
facilitate proper treatment, deferment or 
placement of mentally impaired individuals.  
An across-the-board approach to statewide

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
