Rule 57. Direct Appeals to the Supreme Court 

7.1. Application 

Except when inconsistent with a statute, Tthis rule governs direct appeals to the Supreme 
Court  that  are  authorized  by  the  Constitution  and  by  statute.  Except  when  inconsistent  with  a 
statute or this rule, the rules governing appeals to courts of appeals also apply to direct appeals to 
the Supreme Court.  

7.2. JurisdictionPerfecting Direct Appeal 

The  Supreme  Court may  not  take  jurisdiction over  a  direct  appeal  from  the  decision  of 
any court other than a district court or county court, or over any question of fact. The Supreme 
Court  may  decline  to  exercise  jurisdiction  over  a  direct  appeal  of  an  interlocutory  order  if  the 
record is not adequately developed, or if its decision would be advisory, or if the case is not of 
such importance to the jurisprudence of the state that a direct appeal should be allowed. 

Notice  of  Direct  Appeal.  A  direct  appeal  to  the  Supreme  Court  authorized  by  law  is 
perfected  when  a  written  notice  of direct  appeal  is  filed  with  the  trial court  clerk.   The 
notice of direct appeal must be filed within the time provided by Rule 26.1 or as extended 
by Rule 26.3. The trial court clerk must immediately send a copy of the notice of direct 
appeal to the clerk of the Supreme Court. If a notice of direct appeal is mistakenly filed 
with the Supreme Court or the court of appeals, the notice is deemed filed the same day 
with the trial court clerk, and the Supreme Court clerk or the court of appeals’ clerk must 
immediately send the trial court clerk a copy of the notice.  

Contents of Notice. The notice of direct appeal must: 

(1) 

identify the trial court and state the case’s trial court number and style; 

(2) 

state the date of the judgment or order appealed from; 

(3) 

state that the party desires to take a direct appeal to the Supreme Court; 

(4) 

state the name of each party filing the notice;  

(5) 

specify the law or laws under which the direct appeal is taken; 

(6) 

in an accelerated appeal, state that the appeal is accelerated; and

state,  if  applicable,  that  the  appellant  is  presumed  indigent  and  may  proceed 
without advance payment of costs as provided in Rule 20.1.  

Amending the Notice. An amended notice of direct appeal correcting a defect or omission 
in  an  earlier  filed  notice  may  be  filed  with  the  Supreme  Court  at  any  time  before  the 
appellant’s brief is filed. The amended notice is subject to being struck for cause on the 
motion of any party affected by the amended notice. After the appellant’s brief is filed, 
the notice may be amended only on leave of the Supreme Court and on such terms as the 
Supreme Court may prescribe.  

Other Requirements. Promptly upon filing the notice of direct appeal, appellant must file 
in the Supreme Court a docketing statement as provided in Rule 32.1 and pay all required 
fees authorized to be collected by the clerk of the Supreme Court. 

7.3.  Statement of Jurisdiction of Supreme Court 

Statement of Jurisdiction. In addition to perfecting the direct appeal, the Aappellant must 
file with the recordthe Supreme Court a statement fully butof jurisdiction within ten days 
after the notice of appeal is filed with the trial court clerk.  

Contents  of  Statement.  The  statement  of  jurisdiction  must  plainly  setting  outstate  the 
basis asserted for the exercise of the Supreme Court’s direct appeal jurisdiction; insofar 
as appropriate, follow the form and contents of a petition for review prescribed by Rule 
53; and conform to the length requirements prescribed for a petition for review by Rule 
9.4.  

Response to Statement. An Aappellee may file a response to the appellant’s statement of 
jurisdiction  challenging  the  exercise  of  direct  appeal  jurisdiction  or  a  waiver  of  the 
response within ten days after the statement is filed with the Supreme Court. If filed, the 
response  must,  insofar  as  appropriate,  follow  the  form  and  contents  of  a  response  to  a 
petition  for  review  prescribed  by  Rule  53  and  conform  to  the  length  requirements 
prescribed for a response to a petition to review by Rule 9.4. 

7.4.  Preliminary Ruling on Probable Jurisdiction; Dismissal of Appeal 

If the Supreme Court notes probable jurisdiction over a direct appeal, the parties must file 
briefs under Rule 38 as in any other case.The Supreme Court may determine whether the Court 
has probable jurisdiction based on the statement of jurisdiction and any response. If the Supreme 
Court  determines  that  it  does  not  notehave  probable  jurisdiction  over  a  direct  appeal,  the 
appealCourt will be dismissed the appeal.

7.5. Determination of Direct Appeal 

Misc. Docket No. 21-9100 

Page 4 

a) 

Ruling on Merits. If the Supreme Court determines that it has probable jurisdiction, the 
Court: 

(1) 

may request full briefing under Rule 55; 

(2) 

may set the case for submission under Rule 59; and 

(3) 

may render judgment or make an appropriate order under Rule 60. 

b) 

Rehearing. A motion for rehearing may be filed with the Supreme Court clerk within 15 
days after the Court renders judgment or makes an order disposing of the direct appeal. 
The motion must clearly state the issues relied on for rehearing.  

7.56.  Direct Appeal Exclusive While Pending. 

If a direct appeal to the Supreme Court is filed, the parties to the appeal must not, while that 
appeal is pending, pursue an appeal to the court of appeals. But if the direct appeal is dismissed, 
any  party  may  pursue  any  other  appeal  available  at  the  time  when  the  direct  appeal  was  filed. 
The other appeal must be perfected within ten15 days after dismissal of the direct appeal or the 
date of the Supreme Court’s ruling on a timely filed motion for rehearing. 
 

Notes and Comments 

Comment to 1997 change: This is former Rule 140. The rule is amended without substantive 
change except subdivision 57.5 is amended to make clear that no party to the direct appeal may 
pursue the appeal in the court of appeals while the direct appeal is pending, but allowing 10 days 
to perfect a subsequent appeal.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
