      <pre>Rules and Forms for a Judicial Bypass of Parental Notice and Consent Under 
Chapter 33 of the Family Code  

Explanatory Statement 
 

Chapter  33  of  the  Texas  Family  Code  provides  for  judicial  authorization  of  an 
unemancipated minor to consent to an abortion in Texas without notice to, or the consent 
of,  a  parent,  managing  conservator,  or  guardian.  Sections  33.003  and  33.004,  which 
govern proceedings in the trial and appellate courts, authorize the Court to make rules to 
ensure that judicial bypass applications are decided confidentially and promptly. See TEX. 
FAM. CODE §§ 33.003(l), 33.004(c). The statute also directs the Court to make forms for 
use in judicial bypass proceedings. Id. §§ 33.003(m), 33.004(d). 
 

The Court approved the first set of rules and forms in 1999, following the enactment 
of  Chapter  33.  See  Misc.  Docket  No.  99-9247  (Dec.  22,  1999);  Act  of  May  25,  1999, 
76th  Leg.,  R.S.,  ch.  395,  1999  Tex.  Gen.  Laws  2466  (S.B.  30)  (codified  at  TEX.  FAM. 
CODE  §  33.001  et  seq.).  In  2015,  the  Court  amended  the  rules  and  forms  to  reflect  the 
2015 amendments to Chapter 33. See Misc. Docket No. 15-9246 (Dec. 29, 2015); Act of 
June  1,  2015,  84th  Leg.,  R.S.,  ch.  436  (H.B.  3994).  The  2022  amendments  to  the  rules 
and forms reflect the enactment of Chapter 170A of the Texas Health and Safety Code. 
See Act of May 29, 2021, 87th Leg., R.S., ch. 800 (H.B. 1280) (codified at TEX. HEALTH 
& SAFETY CODE § 170A.001 et seq.).  

he rules and forms do not reflect any judgment by the Court that Chapter 33, or any 
part of it, is constitutional. Constitutional questions should be resolved in an adversarial 
proceeding with full briefing and argument. Nor do the rules imply that abortion is—or is 
not—permitted  in  any  specific  situation.  See,  e.g.,  TEX.  HEALTH  &  SAFETY  CODE  § 
170A.002 (restrictions on abortions). 
 

The  notes  and  comments  appended  to  the  rules  are  intended  to  inform  their 

construction and application by courts and practitioners.

Rule 1.  General Provisions 
 
1.1  Applicability  of  These  Rules.  These  rules  govern  proceedings  for  obtaining  a 
court order authorizing a minor to consent to an abortion without notice to, or the 
consent of, a parent, managing conservator, or guardian under Chapter 33, Family 
Code. All references in these rules to “minor” refer to the minor applicant. Other 
Texas  court  rules—including  the  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rules  of  Evidence, 
Rules  of  Appellate  Procedure,  Rules  of  Judicial  Administration,  and  local  rules 
approved by the Supreme Court—also apply, but when the application of another 

Page 1 

 

  

 

 

 

rule  would  be  inconsistent  with  the  general  framework  or  policy  of  Chapter  33, 
Family Code, or these rules, these rules control. 

roceedings  under  these  rules  are  not  intended  to  create—and  an  order  issued 
under  these  rules  should  not  be  construed  as—a  judicial  determination  that  the 
minor  has  a  life-threatening  physical  condition  aggravated  by,  caused  by,  or 
arising from a pregnancy that places the minor at risk of death or poses a serious 
risk  of  substantial  impairment  of  a  major  bodily  function  unless  the  abortion  is 
performed or induced. See TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 170A.002. 

.2  Expedition Required. 

Proceedings. A court  must give proceedings under these rules precedence 
over  all  other  pending  matters  to  the  extent  necessary  to  ensure  that 
applications and appeals are adjudicated as soon as possible and within the 
time required by Chapter 33, Family Code, and these rules. 

Prompt  actual  notice  required.  Without  compromising  the  confidentiality 
required  by  statute  and  these  rules,  courts  and  clerks  must  serve  orders, 
decisions,  findings,  and  notices  required  under  these  rules  in  a  manner 
designed  to  give  prompt  actual  notice  in  order  that  the  deadlines  imposed 
by Chapter 33, Family Code, can be met.

.3 

Identity of Minor Protected. 

(a)  Generally. Proceedings under these rules must be conducted in a way that 

protects the confidentiality of the identity of the minor. 

(b)  No reference to minor’s identity in proceeding. With the exception of the 
verification  page  required  under  Rule  2.1(c)(2)  and  the  communications 
required  under  Rule  2.2(e),  no  reference  may  be  made  in  any  order, 
decision, finding, or notice, or on the record, to the name of the minor, her 
address, or other information by which she might be identified by persons 
not participating in the proceedings. Instead, the minor must be referred to 
as “Jane Doe” in a numbered cause. 

(c)  Notice. With the exception of orders and rulings released under Rule 1.4(b), 
all  notices  and  communications  from  the  court  to  the  minor  must  be 
directed to the minor’s attorney with a copy to the guardian ad litem. The 
minor’s attorney must immediately serve on the guardian ad litem a copy of 
any document filed with the court. These requirements take effect when an 
attorney appears for the minor or when the clerk has notified the minor of 
the appointment of an attorney or a guardian ad litem.

.4  Confidentiality of Proceedings Required; Exceptions. 

(a)  Generally.  All  officials  and  court  personnel  involved  in  the  proceedings 
must  ensure  that  the  minor’s  contact  with  the  clerk  and  the  court  is 
confidential  and  expeditious.  Except  as  permitted  by  law,  officials  and 
court  personnel  must  never  disclose  to  anyone  outside  the  proceeding—
including  the  minor’s  parent,  managing  conservator,  or  legal  guardian—
that  the  minor  is  or  has  ever  been  pregnant,  or  that  she  wants  or  has  ever 
wanted an abortion. 

(b)  Documents and information pertaining to the proceeding.  

 

(1)  General  rule;  disclosure  prohibited.  As  required  by  Chapter  33, 
Family  Code,  the  application  and  all  other  court  documents  and 
information  pertaining  to  the  proceedings  are  confidential  and 
privileged  and  are  not  subject  to  disclosure  under  Chapter  552, 
Government Code, or to discovery, subpoena, or other legal process. 

  
(2) 

(3) 

Exception;  disclosure  to  minor  permitted.  The  application  and  any 
other document in the court file may be disclosed to the minor.  

Exception; disclosure  of order to certain persons. An order, ruling, 
opinion, or clerk’s certificate may be released to: 

the minor; 

the minor’s guardian ad litem; 

the minor’s attorney; 

• 

• 

• 

• 

 

the physician who is to perform the abortion; 

•  a person designated in writing by the minor to receive the order, 

ruling, opinion, or certificate; 

•  a  governmental  agency  or  governmental  attorney,  in  connection 
with  a  criminal  or  administrative  action  seeking  to  assert  or 
protect the minor’s interests; or 

•  another court, judge, or clerk in the same or related proceedings.

(c) 

Filing  of  court  reporter’s  notes  required.  To  ensure  confidentiality,  the 
court  reporter’s  notes,  in  whatever  form,  must  be  filed  with  other  court 
documents in the proceeding. 

(d)  Duty to report possible abuse.  
 

(1)  Duty  of  the  court.  A  judge  or  justice  who,  as  a  result  of  a  court 
proceeding  governed  by  these  rules,  has  reason  to  believe  that  a 
minor has been or may be physically or sexually abused must report 
the  suspected  abuse  in  accordance  with  Sections  33.0085  and 
33.009, Family Code, and other law. 

 

(2)  Duty of an attorney or guardian ad litem. An attorney or a guardian 
ad  litem  who,  as  a  result  of  a  court  proceeding  governed  by  these 
rules,  has  reason  to  believe  that  a  minor  has  been  or  may  be 
physically  or  sexually  abused  must  report  the  suspected  abuse  in 
accordance with Section 33.009, Family Code, and other law.   

(e)  Department  of  Family  and  Protective  Services  or  local  law  enforcement 
agency to disclose certain information in proceeding. The Department of 
Family  and  Protective  Services  or  a  local  law  enforcement  agency  may 
disclose  to  the  court,  the  minor’s  attorney,  and  the  guardian  ad  litem  any 
information  obtained  under  Sections  33.008,  33.0085,  and  33.009,  Family 
Code, without being ordered to do so. The court may order the Department 
or a local law enforcement agency to disclose the information to the court, 
the  minor’s  attorney,  and  the  guardian  ad  litem,  and  the  Department  or 
agency must comply. 

.5  Methods  of  Transmitting  Documents;  Hearings  Conducted  By  Remote 

Electronic Means; Electronic Record Allowed When Necessary. 

(a) 

 
(b) 

Electronic filing through statewide portal prohibited. Documents must not 
be filed through the electronic filing manager established  by the Office of 
Court Administration. 

Paper,  fax,  or  email  filing  permitted.  Documents  may  be  filed  in  paper 
form,  by  fax,  or  by  email.  The  clerk  of  a  court  must  designate  an  email 
address  or  a  fax  number  for  the  filing  of  documents  in  proceedings 
governed by these rules and must take all reasonable steps to maintain the 
confidentiality of the filings. An attorney must notify the clerk by telephone 
before filing a document by email or fax.

Fax and email transmission by court and clerk. The court and clerk may 
transmit orders, rulings, notices, and other documents by fax or email. But 
before  the  transmission  is  initiated,  the  sender  must  take  all  reasonable 
steps to maintain the confidentiality of the transmission. The time and date 
of a transmission by the court is the time and date when it was initiated. 

Participation  in  hearings  by  electronic  means.  Consistent  with  the 
confidentiality  requirements  of  these  rules,  with  the  court’s  permission,  a 
witness  may  participate  in  a  hearing  under  these  rules  by  video 
conferencing,  telephone,  or  other  remote  electronic  means.  But  the  minor 
must appear before the court in person.  

Record  of  hearing  made  by  electronic  means  if  necessary.  If  the  court 
determines that a court reporter is unavailable for a hearing, the court may 
have  a  record  of  the  hearing  made  by  audio  recording  or  other  electronic 
means.  If  a  notice  of  appeal  is  filed,  the  court  must  have  the  recording 
transcribed  if  possible.  The  person  transcribing  the  recording  must  certify 
to  the  accuracy  of  the  transcription.  The  court  must  transmit  both  the 
recording and the transcription to the court of appeals. 

.6  Disqualification, Recusal, or Objection to a Judge. 

Time for filing and ruling. A motion to recuse or disqualify a trial judge or 
an objection to a trial judge under Section 74.053, Government Code, must 
be filed before 10 a.m. of the first business day after an application is filed 
or promptly after the assignment of a judge to hear the case is made known 
to the minor’s attorney, whichever is later. A motion to recuse or disqualify 
an  appellate  judge  or  an  objection  to  an  appellate  judge  under  Section 
75.551, Government Code, must be filed before 10 a.m. of the first business 
day  after  a  notice  of  appeal  is  filed  or  promptly  after  the  assignment  of  a 
judge  is  made  known  to  the  minor’s  attorney,  whichever  is  later.  A  judge 
who chooses to withdraw voluntarily must do so immediately. A motion to 
disqualify  or  recuse  or  an  objection  to  an  assigned  judge  does  not  extend 
the deadline for ruling on the minor’s application. 

(b)  Voluntary  disqualification  or  recusal;  objection.  A  judge  who  removes 
himself  or  herself  voluntarily—whether  in  response  to  a  motion  or  on  the 
judge’s  own  initiative—or  to  whom  objection  is  made  under  Sections 
74.053  or  75.551,  Government  Code,  must  immediately  notify  the 
appropriate authority under rule or statute for assigning another judge. That 
authority must immediately assign a judge or justice to the proceeding.

(c) 

Involuntary  disqualification  or  recusal.  A  judge  who  refuses  to  remove 
himself  or  herself  voluntarily  from  a  proceeding  in  response  to  a  motion 
must  immediately  refer  the  motion  to  the  appropriate  judge  under  rule  or 
statute  for  determination.  The  judge  to  whom  the  motion  is  referred  must 
rule on it as soon as possible and may do so with or without a hearing. If 
the  motion  is  granted,  the  judge  to  whom  the  motion  was  referred  must 
immediately assign another judge to the proceeding. 

(d)  Restrictions  on  the  number  of  motions  and  objections.  A  minor  who 
objects  under  Section  74.053  or  Section  75.551,  Government  Code,  to  a 
judge assigned to the proceeding may not thereafter file a motion to recuse 
the judge assigned to replace the judge to whom the objection was made.  A 
minor who files a motion to recuse or disqualify a judge may not thereafter 
object  under  Section  74.053  or  Section  75.551,  Government  Code,  to 
another judge assigned to the proceeding. 

(e) 

Issues  on  appeal.  Any  error  in  the  denial  of  a  motion  to  recuse  or 
disqualify, any error in the disallowance of an objection, or any challenge 
to a judge that a minor is precluded from making by subsections (a) or (d), 
may be raised only on appeal from the court’s denial of the application. 

.7  Rules and Forms to be Made Available.  

(a)  Online.  A  complete  set  of  these  rules  and  forms  must  be  posted  on  the 
Texas Judiciary website at www.txcourts.gov. Forms 1A, 2A, and 2B must 
be translated into Spanish. 

(b) 

In  clerks’  offices.  The  clerk  of  a  court  in  which  an  application  or  appeal 
may be filed must make the rules and forms—including the Spanish version 
of  Form  1A,  2A,  and  2B—and  any  applicable  local  rules  available  to  a 
minor without charge. 

.8  Duties of Attorneys Ad Litem. An attorney ad litem must represent the minor in 
the trial court in the proceeding in which the attorney is assigned and in any appeal 
under these rules to the court of appeals or the Supreme Court. But an attorney ad 
litem  is  not  required  to  represent  the  minor  in  any  other  court  or  any  other 
proceeding. 

.9 

Fees and Costs. 

(a)  No  fees  or  costs  charged  to  minor.  No  filing  fee  or  court  cost  may  be 
assessed against a minor for any proceeding in a trial or appellate court.

(4) 

Fees  and  costs  that  may  be  paid.  The  State  may  be  ordered  to  pay 
the  reasonable  and  necessary  fees  and  expenses  of  the  attorney  ad 
litem,  the  reasonable  and  necessary  fees  and  expenses  of  the 
guardian  ad  litem,  the  court  reporter’s  fee  as  certified  by  the  court 
reporter, and trial court filing fees and costs as certified by the clerk. 
Court costs include the expenses of an interpreter (Form 2H) and an 
evaluation by a licensed mental health counselor but do not include 
the fees or expenses of a witness. Court costs do not include fees that 
must be remitted to the state treasury. 

To whom order directed and sent. The order must be directed to the 
Comptroller  of  Public  Accounts  and  sent  to  the  Director,  Fiscal 
Division, of the Texas Department of Health. 

Form and contents of the order. The order must state the amounts to 
be  awarded  the  attorney  ad  litem  and  the  guardian  ad  litem.  The 
order  must  be  separate  from  any  other  order  in  the  proceeding  and 
must  not  address  any  subject  other  than  the  assessment  of  fees, 
expenses, and costs. A trial court may use Forms 2F and 2G, but it is 
not required to do so. 

Time for signing and sending order. The order must be signed by the 
judge  and  sent  by  the  clerk  to  the  Department  of  Health  not  later 
than  the  ninetieth  day  after  the  date  of  the  final  ruling  in  a 
proceeding. 

(c)  Motion  to  reconsider;  time  for  filing. Within  thirty  days  of  actual  receipt 
of the order, the Comptroller or any other person adversely affected by the 
order  may  file  a  motion  in  the  trial  court  to  reconsider  the  assessment  of 
fees,  expenses,  or  costs.  The  trial  court  retains  jurisdiction  of  the  case  to 
hear and determine any timely filed motion to reconsider. 

(d)  Appeal.  The  Comptroller  or  any  other  person  adversely  affected  by  the 
order may appeal from the trial court’s ruling on the motion to reconsider 
as from any other final judgment of the court. 

(e) 

Report  to  the  Office  of  Court  Administration.  The  Department  of  Health 
must transmit to the Office of Court Administration a copy of every order 
assessing fees, expenses, or costs in a proceeding under Chapter 33, Family 
Code. Orders assessing fees, expenses, or costs are not subject to any order 
of  the  Supreme  Court  of  Texas  requiring  mandatory  reports  of  judicial 

Page 7 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appointments  and  fees  or  to  the  reporting  requirements  of  Chapter  36, 
Government Code. 

Confidentiality.  When  transmitting  an  order  awarding  costs  to  the 
Department of Health, the clerk must  take reasonable steps to preserve its 
confidentiality.  The  confidentiality  of  an  order  awarding  costs—as 
prescribed by Chapter 33, Family Code—is not affected by its transmission 
to  the  Comptroller,  Texas  Department  of  Health,  or  the  Office  of  Court 
Administration, nor is the order subject to public disclosure in response to a 
request under any statute, rule, or other law. But these rules do not preclude 
the  Comptroller,  the  Texas  Department  of  Health,  or  the  Office  of  Court 
Administration from disclosing summary information from orders assessing 
costs for statistical or other such purposes. 

.10  Amicus Briefs. Amicus briefs may be submitted and received by a court—but not 

filed—under either of the following procedures. 

Confidential, case-specific briefs. A non-party who is authorized to attend 
or  participate  in  a  particular  proceeding  under  Chapter  33,  Family  Code, 
may  submit  an  amicus  brief  addressing  matters,  including  confidential 
matters, specific to the proceeding. The brief and the manner in which it is 
submitted must comply with Rules 1.3 and 1.4 and be directed to the court 
in which the proceeding is pending. If the brief is filed in paper form, the 
person  must  submit  the  original  brief  and  the  same  number  of  copies 
required for other paper submissions to the court. The person must serve a 
copy of the brief on the minor’s attorney and guardian ad litem. The court 
to  which  the  brief  is  submitted  must  maintain  the  brief  as  part  of  the 
confidential case file in accordance with Rule 1.4. 

Public  or  general  briefs.  Any  person  may  submit  a  brief  addressing  any 
matter  relating  to  proceedings  under  Chapter  33,  Family  Code.  The  brief 
must  not  contain  any  information  in  violation  of  Rules  1.3  and  1.4.  If  the 
brief  is  filed  in  paper  form,  the  person  must  submit  the  original  brief  and 
the  same  number  of  copies  required  for  other  paper  submissions  to  the 
court. If the brief is submitted to a court of appeals, one copy of the brief 
must also be submitted to the Supreme Court of Texas. Upon receipt of an 
amicus  brief  submitted  under  this  subsection,  the  Clerk  of  the  Supreme 
Court  must,  as  soon  as  practicable,  have  the  brief  posted  on  the  Texas 
Judiciary website.

Rule  1.1  contemplates  that  other  court  rules  of  procedure  and  administration 
remain  as  a  “default”  governing  matters  not  addressed  in  these  rules.  Thus,  for 
example,  these  rules  do  not  state  a  deadline  for  filing  notices  of  appeal,  so  the 
ordinary 30-day deadline controls, see Tex. R. App. P. 26.1, but these rules control 
over  inconsistent  provisions  in  the  appellate  rules  governing  the  docketing 
statement, the record, and briefing. 

Rule  1.1  also  contemplates  that  individual  jurisdictions  may  enact  local  rules 
pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. P. 3a, Tex. R. App. P. 1.2, or Tex. R. Jud. Admin. 10, to 
the extent consistent with Chapter 33, Family Code, and with these rules, to tailor 
the  implementation  of  the  statute  and  these  rules  to  local  needs  and  preferences.  
Local  rules  may  address,  for  example,  the  specific  location  or  office  where 
applications  are  to  be  filed,  how  applications  are  to  be  assigned  for  hearing,  and 
whether  an  appellate  court  will  permit  or  require  briefing  or  oral  argument.  See 
also Rule 2, Comment 1. 

Any  judge  involved  in  a  proceeding—whether  as  the  judge  assigned  to  hear  and 
decide the application; the judge assigned to hear and decide any disqualification, 
recusal,  or  objection;  a  judge  authorized  to  transfer  the  application  or  assign 
another  judge  to  it;  or  an  appellate  judge—may  have  access  to  all  information 
(including the verification page) in the proceeding or any related proceeding, such 
as a prior filing by the minor. Similarly, a minor’s attorney and guardian ad litem 
must,  of  course,  have  access  to  the  case  file  to  the  extent  necessary  to  perform 
their respective duties.  

Sections  33.008,  33.0085,  and  33.009,  Family  Code,  require  physicians,  judges, 
attorneys, and guardians ad litem to report suspected physical or sexual abuse to 
the  Texas  Department  of  Family  and  Protective  Services  and  to  a  local  law 
enforcement agency. Section 33.010 makes confidential—“[n]otwithstanding any 
other  law”—all  information  obtained  by  the  Department  or  a  law  enforcement 
agency under Sections 33.008, 33.0085, and 33.009 except to the extent necessary 
to  prove  certain  criminal  conduct.  Rule  1.4(e)  construes  Section  33.010  in 
harmony  with  Section  33.003(i-2),  which  makes  past  or  potential  future  abuse 
relevant to a claim that notifying or attempting to obtain the consent of a parent, 
managing conservator, or guardian would not be in the minor’s best interest.  

Rule 1.6 controls to the extent that it conflicts with other provisions regarding the 
disqualification or recusal of judges, such as Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a, Tex. R. App. P. 
16, and Tex. Gov’t Code 25.00255.  

The archival requirements relating to proceedings under Chapter 33, Family Code, 
and these rules is governed by Sections 441.158 and 441.185, Government Code,

and  the  schedules  promulgated  by  the  Texas  State  Library  and  Archives 
Commission pursuant to those authorities. 

Orders  awarding  fees,  expenses,  and  costs  contain  information  that  is  made 
confidential  by  Chapter  33,  Family  Code.  The  confidentiality  of  the  information 
should not be affected by the transmission of the order to the Texas Department of 
Health and to the Comptroller, which is necessary to effectuate payment, or to the 
Office of Court Administration, which is necessary to oversee the costs associated 
with  the  proceedings.  Rule  1.9(f)  does  not  preclude  either  the  Comptroller,  the 
Texas  Department  of  Health,  or  the  Office  of  Court  Administration  from 
disclosing total amounts paid for all proceedings, the average amount awarded per 
proceeding,  or  other  statistical  summaries  or  analyses  that  do  not  impair  the 
confidentiality of the proceedings.  

Rule  1.10  adds  a  procedure  for  filing  amicus  curiae  briefs  uniquely  designed  for 
the expedited and confidential nature of judicial bypass cases. 

RULE 2.  PROCEEDINGS IN THE TRIAL COURT 
 
2.1  Where  to  File  an  Application;  Court  Assignment  and  Transfer;  Application 

Form; Effect of a Nonsuit or Prior Determination. 

(a) 

Counties in which an application may be filed. An application for an order 
under Section 33.003, Family Code, must be filed in the minor’s county of 
residence, unless one of the following exceptions applies.  

(1)  Minor’s parent is a presiding judge. If the minor’s parent, managing 
conservator, or guardian is a presiding judge of a court described in 
(b)(1) in the county of the minor’s residence, the application must be 
filed in: 

(A) 

a contiguous county; or 

B) 

the county where the minor intends to obtain the abortion. 

 
Residence  in  a  county  with  a  population  of  less  than  10,000.  If  the 
minor’s county of residence has a population of less than 10,000, the 
application must be filed in: 

  (

(2) 

 

   

   

 

(A) 

the minor’s county of residence; 

(B) 

a contiguous county; or 

Page 10

(C) 

the county where the minor intends to obtain the abortion. 

Nonresident  minor.  If  the  minor  is  not  a  Texas  resident,  the 
application  must  be  filed  in  the  county  where  the  minor  intends  to 
obtain the abortion. 

b)  Courts in which an application may be filed; assignment and transfer. 

  (

Courts  with  jurisdiction.  An  application  may  be  filed  in  a  district 
court (including a family district court), a county court at law, or a 
court having probate jurisdiction. 

Application  filed  with  district  or  county  clerk.  An  application  must 
be  filed  with  either  the  district  clerk  or  the  county  clerk,  who  will 
assign  the  application  to  a  court  as  provided  by  local  rule  or  these 
rules. The clerk to whom the application is tendered cannot refuse to 
accept it because of any local rule or other rule or law that governs 
the  filing  and  assignment  of  applications  or  cases.  The  clerk  must 
accept the application and transfer it immediately to the proper clerk, 
advising  the  person  tendering  the  application  where  it  is  being 
transferred. 

(3) 

Court assignment and transfer by local rule. The courts in a county 
that  have  jurisdiction  to  hear  applications  may  determine  by  local 
rule  how  applications  will  be  assigned  between  or  among  them.  A 
local  rule  must  be  approved  by  the  Supreme  Court  under  Rule  3a, 
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. 

(4) 

Initial  court  assignment  if  no  local  rule.  Absent  a  local  rule,  the 
clerk  who  files  an  application—whether  the  district  clerk  or  the 
county clerk—must assign it as follows: 

(A) 

(B) 

(C) 

to a district court, if the active judge of the court, or a judge 
assigned to it, is available; 

if  the  application  cannot  be  assigned  under  (A),  then  to  a 
statutory  county  or  probate  court,  if  the  active  judge  of  the 
court, or a judge assigned to it, is available; 

if the application cannot be assigned under (A) or (B), then to 
the  constitutional  county  court,  if  it  has  probate  jurisdiction, 
and if the active judge of the court, or a judge assigned to it, 
is available; 

Page 11

  (

(1) 

(2) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(D) 

if  the  application  cannot  be  assigned  under  (A),  (B),  or  (C), 
then to the district court. 

(5) 

Judges  who  may  hear  and  determine  applications.  An  application 
may  be  heard  and  determined  by  the  active  judge  of  the  court  to 
which the application is assigned, by any judge authorized to sit for 
the active judge, or by any judge who may be assigned to the court 
in which the application is pending. An application may not be heard 
or determined, or any proceedings under these rules conducted, by a 
master or magistrate. 

(c) 

Application form. An application consists of two pages—a cover page and 
a separate verification page—if the minor is not represented by an attorney 
at the time of filing. If the minor is represented by an attorney at the time of 
filing,  the  application  must  include  a  third  page,  the  attorney’s  sworn 
statement or declaration made under penalty of perjury. 

(1) 

Cover page. The cover page may be submitted on Form 2A, but use 
of  the  form  is  not  required.  The  cover  page  must  be  styled  “In  re 
Jane  Doe”  and  must  not  disclose  the  name  of  the  minor  or  any 
information  from  which  the  minor’s  identity  could  be  derived.  The 
cover page must state: 

that the minor is unmarried, is under 18 years of age, and has 
not  had  her  disabilities  removed  under  Chapter  31,  Family 
Code; 

that the minor wishes to have an abortion without notifying or 
obtaining  consent  from  either  of  her  parents  or  a  managing 
conservator or guardian, and the statutory ground or grounds 
on which she relies; 

that venue is proper in the county in which the application has 
been filed; 

(B) 

(C) 

D) 

  (

(E)  whether  the  minor  has  retained  an  attorney,  and  if  so,  the 
attorney’s  name,  email  address,  mailing  address,  and 
telephone number; 

(A) 

that the minor is pregnant; 

Page 12 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(F)  whether  the  minor  requests  the  court  to  appoint  a  particular 

person as her guardian ad litem; and 

that,  concerning  her  current  pregnancy,  the  minor  has  not 
previously filed an application that was denied; or 

if  the  minor  has  filed  a  previous  application  with  respect  to 
the current pregnancy that was denied, that this application is 
being  filed  in  the  same  court  that  denied  the  previous 
application  and  that  there  has  been  a  material  change  in 
circumstances  since  the  time  the  previous  application  was 
denied. 

(2) 

Verification page. The verification page may be submitted on Form 
2B, but use of the form is  not required. The verification page must 
be separate from the cover page, must be signed by the minor under 
oath or under penalty of perjury, and must state: 

the minor’s full name, date of birth, physical address, mailing 
address, and telephone number; 

the name, address, telephone number, and relationship to the 
minor of any person the minor requests the court to appoint as 
her guardian ad litem; 

if  the  minor  has  not  retained  an  attorney,  a  telephone 
number—whether that of the minor or someone else (such as 
a  physician,  friend,  or  relative)—at  which  the  minor  may  be 
contacted immediately and confidentially until an attorney is 
appointed to represent her; and 

(G) 

H) 

  (

(A) 

(B) 

(C) 

(3) 

(D) 

that  all  information  contained  in  the  application,  including 
both the cover page and the verification page, is true. 

 
Attorney’s  statement.  The  minor’s  attorney  must  file  with  the 
application  a  sworn  statement  or  unsworn  declaration  made  under 
penalty  of  perjury  that  attests  to  the  truth  of  the  minor’s  claims 
regarding venue and prior applications.  

Time  of  filing.  An  application  is  filed  when  it  is  actually  received  by  the 
district or county clerk. 

(d) 

 

Page 13 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1)  General  rule.  A  minor  who  has  filed  an  application  and  obtained  a 
determination  by  the  court  under  Rule  2.5  may  not  initiate  a  new 
application proceeding with respect to the same pregnancy, and the 
prior  determination  is  res  judicata  on  the  issue  whether  the  minor 
may consent  to an abortion without notification to, or consent of, a 
parent, managing conservator, or guardian. 

(e)  Nonsuit  requires  permission.  A  minor  may  not  withdraw  or  nonsuit  an 

application without permission of the court. 

f) 

Res judicata effect of prior determination.  

  (

 

Exception  for  material  change  in  circumstances.  A  minor  whose 
application is denied may submit a new application to the court that 
denied  the  application  if  the  minor  shows  that  there  has  been  a 
material  change  in  circumstances  since  the  prior  application  was 
denied. 

2) 

  (

.2  Clerk’s Duties. 

(a) 

Assistance  in  filing.  The  clerk  must  give  prompt  assistance—in  a  manner 
designed  to  protect  the  minor’s  confidentiality—to  persons  seeking  to  file 
an  application.  If  requested,  the  clerk  must  administer  the  oath  for  the 
verification  page  or  provide  a  person  authorized  to  do  so.  The  clerk  must 
also redact from the cover page any information identifying the minor. The 
clerk  must  ensure  that  both  the  cover  page  and  the  separate  verification 
page are completed in full. 

(b)  Filing  procedure.  The  clerk  must  assign  the  application  a  cause  number 
that does not identify the assigned judge and affix it to both the cover page 
and  the  verification  page.  The  clerk  must  then  provide  a  certified  copy  of 
the verification page to the person filing the application. The clerk must file 
the verification page under seal in a secure place where access is limited to 
essential court personnel. 

(c)  Distribution.  When  an  application  is  filed,  the  clerk  must  distribute  the 
cover page and verification page, or a copy of them, to the appropriate court 
immediately.  If  appointment  of  a  specific  person  as  guardian  ad  litem  has 
been  requested,  the  clerk  must  also  communicate  the  information  to  the 
appropriate court immediately. 

(d) 

If  judge  of  assigned  court  not  available.  The  clerk  must  determine 
immediately  whether  the  judge  of  the  court  to  which  the  application  is 

Page 14 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  2

 

 

assigned  is  available  to  hear  the  application  within  the  prescribed  time 
period. If that judge is not available, the clerk must immediately notify the 
local  administrative  judge  or  judges  and  the  presiding  judge  of  the 
administrative  judicial  region  and  must  send  them  any  information 
requested, including the cover page and verification page. 

(e)  Notice  of  hearing  and  appointments.  When  the  clerk  is  advised  by  the 
court of a time for the hearing or of the appointment of a guardian ad litem 
or an attorney ad litem, the clerk must immediately give notice—as directed 
in  the  verification  page  and  to  each  appointee—of  the  hearing  time  or 
appointment. A court coordinator or other court personnel may give notice 
instead of the clerk. 

(f) 

 

(g) 

Orders.  The  clerk  must  provide  the  minor’s  attorney  and  the  guardian  ad 
litem  with  copies  of  all  court  orders,  including  findings  of  fact  and 
conclusions of law. 

Certificate  of  court’s  failure  to  rule  within  time  prescribed  by  statute.  If 
the court fails to rule on an application within the time required by Section 
33.003(h),  Family  Code,  then,  upon  the  minor’s  request,  the  clerk  must 
immediately issue a certificate to that effect,  stating that the application is 
deemed to be denied. The clerk may use Form 2E but is not required to do 
so. 

.3  Court’s  Duties.  Upon  receipt  of  an  application  from  the  clerk,  the  court  must 

promptly: 

(a) 

(b) 

appoint  a  qualified  person  to  serve  as  guardian  ad  litem  for  the  minor 
applicant; 

unless  the  minor  has  a  retained  attorney,  appoint  an  attorney  ad  litem  for 
the  minor,  who  must  not  be  the  same  person  appointed  as  guardian  ad 
litem;  

(c)  

set a hearing on the application; and 

(d) 

advise the clerk of the appointments and the hearing time. 

.4  Hearing. 

Time.  

(a) 
 

Page 15

  2

 

 

(1)  General rule. The court must conduct a hearing in time to rule on the 

application by the deadline stated in Rule 2.5(f).  
 

(2)  Minor  may  request  postponement.  The  minor  may  postpone  the 
hearing  by  written  request  to  the  clerk.  The  request  may  be 
submitted  on  Form  2C,  but  use  of  the  form  is  not  required.  The 
request must either specify a date on which the minor will be ready 
for  the  hearing  or  state  that  the  minor  will  later  provide  a  date  on 
which she will be ready for the hearing. Once the minor determines 
when she will be ready for the hearing, she must notify the clerk of 
that  time  in  writing.  The  postponed  hearing  must  be  conducted  in 
time for the court to rule on the application by the deadline stated in 
Rule 2.5(f). 

(b) 

(c) 

Place.  The  hearing  should  be  held  in  a  location,  such  as  a  judge’s 
chambers,  that  will  ensure  confidentiality.  The  hearing  may  be  held  away 
from the courthouse. 

Persons  attending.  The  hearing  must  be  closed  to  the  public.  Only  the 
judge,  the  court  reporter,  other  essential  court  personnel,  the  minor,  her 
attorney, her guardian ad litem, and witnesses on the minor’s behalf may be 
present.  

(d)  Record. The court, the minor, the minor’s attorney, or the guardian ad litem 
may  request  that  the  record—the  clerk’s  record  and  reporter’s  record—be 
prepared. A request by the minor, the minor’s attorney, or the guardian ad 
litem must be in writing and may be, but is not required to be, on Form 2I 
(if an appeal will be taken) or 2J (if an appeal will not be taken). The court 
reporter must provide an original and two copies of the reporter’s record to 
the  clerk.  When  the  record  has  been  prepared,  the  clerk  must  contact  the 
minor,  if  she  has  requested  the  record;  the  minor’s  attorney;  and  the 
guardian  ad  litem  at  the  telephone  numbers  shown  on  Form  2I  or  2J  and 
make it available to them. The record must be prepared and made available 
immediately if it has been requested for appeal or to demonstrate the past or 
potential  abuse  of  the  minor.  When  a  notice  of  appeal  is  filed,  the  clerk 
must  forward  the  record  to  the  court  of  appeals  in  accordance  with  Rule 
3.2(b). 

(e)  Hearing to be informal. The court should attempt to rule on the application 
without  regard  to  technical  defects  in  the  application  or  the  evidence.  
Affidavits of persons other than the minor are admissible. Statements in the 
application  cannot  be  offered  as  evidence  to  support  the  application.  If 

Page 16 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary, the court may assist the minor in remedying technical defects in 
the application and in presenting relevant and material facts. 

.5  Ruling. 

(a) 

Form of ruling. The court’s ruling on the application must include a signed 
order and written findings of fact and conclusions of law. The findings and 
conclusions may be included in the order. The court may use Form 2D, but 
it is not required to do so. 

(b)  Grounds for granting application. The court must grant the application if 

the minor establishes, by clear and convincing evidence: 

(1) 

that the minor is mature and sufficiently well informed to make the 
decision to have an abortion performed without notice to, or consent 
of, a parent, managing conservator, or guardian; or 

(2) 

that the notification or attempt to obtain consent would not be in the 
minor’s best interest. 

(c) 

The  mature-and-informed  inquiry.  In  determining  whether  the  minor 
meets  the  requirements  of  (b)(1),  the  court  must  consider  the  experience, 
perspective, and judgment of the minor. The court may: 

the  minor’s  life  experiences,  such  as  working,  traveling 
independently, or managing her own financial affairs; and 

steps  taken  by  the  minor  to  explore  her  options  and  the 
consequences of those options; 

 
inquire as to the minor’s reasons for seeking an abortion; 

consider the degree to which the minor is informed about the state-
published informational materials described by Chapter 171, Health 
and Safety Code; and 

require  the  minor  to  be  evaluated  by  a  licensed  mental  health 
counselor,  who  must  return  the  evaluation  to  the  court  for  review 
within three business days. 

B) 

C)

consider all relevant factors, including:

the minor’s age;

(2) 

(3) 

4) 

  (

Page 17

The  best-interest  inquiry.  In  determining  whether  the  minor  meets  the 
requirements of (b)(2), the court may inquire as to: 

(1) 

the  minor’s  reasons  for  not  wanting  to  notify  and  obtain  consent 
from a parent, managing conservator, or guardian; 

2)  whether  notification  or  the  attempt  to  obtain  consent  may  lead  to 

physical or sexual abuse; 

3)  whether  the  pregnancy  was  the  result  of  sexual  abuse  by  a  parent, 

managing conservator, or guardian; and 

4) 

any  history  of  physical  or  sexual  abuse  from  a  parent,  managing 
conservator, or guardian. 

e)  Grounds for denying the application. The court must deny the application 

the  minor  does  not  establish  either  ground  in  (b)  by  clear  and 
convincing evidence; or 

 the minor does not attend the hearing; and 

(A) 

(B) 

the minor had actual knowledge of the setting; or 
 
diligent attempts were made to notify the minor of the setting. 

Time for ruling. The court must rule on an application as soon as possible 
after  it  is  filed,  subject  to  any  postponement  requested  by  the  minor,  and 
immediately  after  the  hearing  is  concluded.  Section  33.003(h),  Family 
Code, states that a court must rule on an application by 5 p.m. on the fifth 
business day after the day the application is filed, or if the minor requests a 
postponement, by 5 p.m. on the fifth business day after the date the minor 
states she is ready for the hearing. 

Failure to timely rule. If the court fails to timely rule on an application, the 
application is deemed to be denied. 

h)  Notification  of  the  right  to  appeal.  If  the  court  denies  the  application,  it 
must inform the minor of her right to appeal under Rule 3 and furnish her 
with the notice of appeal form, Form 3A.

Notes and Comments 
 

Section  33.003(b),  Family  Code,  permits  an  application  to  be  filed  in  “a  county 
court at law, court having probate jurisdiction, or district court, including a family 
district court, in the minor’s county of residence” or, if an exception applies, in a 
contiguous  county  or  the  county  where  the  abortion  would  be  performed.  The 
initial assignment of an application to a specific court in a county is made by the 
clerk with whom the application is filed (not by the minor). Given the diversity of 
needs and circumstances among Texas courts, these rules allow the courts in each 
county  to  tailor  the  procedures  for  filing,  handling,  and  assigning  applications 
prescribed by these rules to best meet those needs and circumstances. Chapter 74, 
Subchapter C, Government Code, affords the presiding judge of an administrative 
judicial region broad discretion to assign active judges within the region, as well 
as  visiting  judges,  to  hear  matters  pending  in  courts  within  the  region.  See  Tex. 
Govt.  Code  §§  74.054,  74.056;  see  also  id.  §  74.056(b)  (presiding  judges  may 
request judges from other judicial regions for assignment); § 74.057 (Chief Justice 
may  assign  judges  from  one  judicial  region  to  another).  Section  25.0022, 
Government  Code,  provides  for  assignment  of  probate  judges.  Furthermore, 
Chapter 74,  Subchapter  D,  Government  Code,  authorizes  district  and  statutory 
county  court  judges  within  a  county  to  hear  matters  pending  in  any  district  or 
statutory  county  court  in  the  county.  Id.  §  74.094(a).  Finally,  Section  74.121, 
Government Code, permits courts within a county to transfer cases among courts 
having jurisdiction over the case. If no local rule governs assignments, then Rule 
2.1(b)(4) controls.  

Because an application is considered filed when it is actually received by the clerk, 
the  timing  provisions  relating  to  filing  by  mail  of  Tex.  R.  Civ.  P.  21a  are 
inapplicable. 

Section  33.003(f),  Family  Code,  provides  that  a  guardian  ad  litem  may  be  (1)  a 
person who may consent to treatment for the minor under Sections 32.001(a)(1)-
(3),  Family  Code;  (2)  a  psychiatrist  or  an  individual  licensed  or  certified  as  a 
psychologist under Chapter 501, Occupations Code; (3) an appropriate employee 
of the Department of Family and Protective Services; (4) a member of the clergy; 
or  (5)  another  appropriate  person  selected  by  the  court.  The  trial  court  may  also 
consider  appointing  a  qualified  person  requested  by  the  minor.  Although  not 
directly  applicable  to  these  proceedings,  the  standards  embodied  in  Chapter  107, 
Family  Code,  reflect  legislative  intent  that  competent  and  qualified  persons  be 
appointed to serve as ad litems and may provide general guidance concerning the 
nature of those qualifications. Appointment of an employee of the Department of 
Family  and  Protective  Services  to  serve  as  guardian  ad  litem  may  give  rise  to  a 
conflict of interest not immediately apparent at the time since the Department may 
be  involved  with  the  minor’s  family  due  to  an  abuse  or  neglect  investigation,  or

may  be  party  to  a  suit  affecting  the  parent-child  relationship,  or  may  already  be 
serving as the child’s managing conservator. 

The  duties  of  guardians  ad  litem  are  not  susceptible  of  precise  definition.  
Generally,  a  guardian  ad  litem  should  interview  the  minor  and  conduct  any 
investigation the guardian believes to be appropriate, without violating Rules 1.3 
and 1.4, to assist the court in arriving at an  opinion whether the  minor is mature 
and sufficiently well informed to make the decision to have an abortion performed 
without  notification  to,  or  consent  of,  either  of  her  parents  or  a  managing 
conservator  or  guardian  or  whether  notification  or  the  attempt  to  obtain  consent 
would  not  be  in  the  best  interest  of  the  minor.    Rule  2.5(c)  and  (d)  list  some 
nonexclusive  factors  outlined  in  Section  33.003(i-1)-(i-2),  Family  Code,  that  a 
court  may  consider  in  deciding  whether  the  statutory  criteria  for  a  bypass  have 
been  met.    Factors  that  have  been  considered  in  other  jurisdictions  with  similar 
parental notification and consent statutes include: 

•  whether  the  minor  has  been  examined  by  a  doctor  of  medicine,  doctor  of 
osteopathy, or registered nurse—who is licensed to practice in Texas—and has 
given  that  health  care  provider  an  accurate  and  complete  statement  of  her 
medical history; 

•  whether  the  minor  has  been  provided  with  information  or  counseling  bearing 

on her decision to have an abortion; 

•  whether the minor desires further counseling; 

•  whether, based on the information or counseling provided to the minor, she is 

able to give informed consent; 

•  whether the minor is attending school, or is or has been employed; 

•  whether the minor has previously filed an application that was denied; 

•  whether the minor lives with her parents; 

•  whether  the  minor  desires  an  abortion  or  has  been  threatened,  intimidated,  or 

coerced into having an abortion; 

•  whether the pregnancy resulted from sexual assault, sexual abuse, or incest; 

•  whether there is a history or pattern of family violence; and

•  whether the minor fears for her safety. 

These  considerations  may  not  be  relevant  in  every  case,  are  not  exclusive,  and 
may not be sufficient to discharge the guardian ad litem’s responsibilities in every 
case.  Use  of  these  factors  as  a  basis  for  civil  liability  or  as  a  statement  of  the 
standard  of  care  is  contrary  to  their  intended  purpose.  Nothing  in  this  comment 
alters  existing  standards  of  conduct  under  the  Texas  Disciplinary  Rules  of 
Professional Conduct, the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure, or the Code of 
Judicial Conduct.  

In addition to these general guidelines, Chapter 107, Family Code, sets forth duties 
of  guardians  and  attorneys  ad  litem  appointed  in  suits  affecting  the  parent-child 
relationship. These duties are not directly applicable to proceedings under Chapter 
33, Family Code, and may be incompatible with the confidential and expeditious 
nature  of  such  proceedings,  but  they  reflect  general  legislative  intent  concerning 
the responsibilities of ad litems. 

Under Rule 2.5(b), once a court concludes that an application should be granted on 
a single ground, it need not address other grounds. But in addressing any ground, 
the court should attempt to ascertain, among other factors, whether the pregnancy 
resulted  from  sexual  assault,  sexual  abuse,  or  incest.  The  legislative  history  of 
Chapter 33, Family Code, indicates that one of the principal purposes of the statute 
was to screen for sexual crimes and abuse of minors so as to protect them against 
further victimization. 

RULE 3.  APPEAL FROM DENIAL OF APPLICATION 
 
3.1  How  to  Appeal.  To  appeal  the  denial  of  an  application,  the  minor  must  file  a 
notice of appeal with the clerk of the court that denied the application, file a copy 
of the notice of appeal with the clerk of the court of appeals to which an appeal is 
to  be  taken,  and  advise  the  clerk  of  the  court  of  appeals  by  telephone  that  an 
appeal  is  being  taken  under  Chapter  33,  Family  Code.  The  minor  may  use  Form 
3A but is not required to do so. The notice of appeal must: 

(a) 

be styled “In re Jane Doe”; 

(b) 

state the number of the cause in the trial court; 

(c) 

be addressed to a court of appeals with jurisdiction in the county in which 
the application was filed; 

(d) 

state an intention to appeal; and

(a) 

Assistance in filing. The trial court clerk must give prompt assistance—in a 
manner designed to protect the minor’s confidentiality—to persons seeking 
to  file  an  appeal.  The  clerk  must  ensure  that  the  notice  of  appeal  is 
addressed  to  the  proper  court  of  appeals  and  that  the  minor’s  name  and 
identifying information are not disclosed. 

(b)  Forwarding record to court of appeals. Upon receipt of a notice of appeal, 
the  trial  court  clerk  must  immediately  forward  to  the  clerk  of  the  court  of 
appeals  the  notice  of  appeal,  the  clerk’s  record  excluding  the  verification 
page, and the reporter’s record. The trial court clerk must deliver the record 
to the clerk of the court of appeals by hand or send it by fax or email. The 
clerk must not send the record by mail.  

(c) 

Certificate  of  court’s  failure  to  rule  within  time  prescribed  by  statute.  If 
the court of appeals fails to rule on an application within the time required 
by  Section  33.004(b),  Family  Code,  then,  upon  the  minor’s  request,  the 
clerk  of  the  court  of  appeals  must  immediately  issue  a  certificate  to  that 
effect,  stating  that  the  trial  court’s  order  is  affirmed.  The  clerk  may  use 
Form 3D but is not required to do so. 

Briefing  and  argument.  A  minor  may  request  to  be  allowed  to  submit  a 
brief and to present oral argument, but the court may decide to rule without 
a brief or oral argument. 

 (b)  Ruling. The court of appeals—sitting in a three-judge panel—must issue a 
judgment  affirming  or  reversing  the  trial  court’s  order  denying  the 
application. The court may use Form 3C but is not required to do so. 

(c) 

Time  for  ruling.  The  court  of  appeals  must  rule  on  an  appeal  as  soon  as 
possible,  subject  to  any  postponement  requested  by  the  minor.  Section 
33.004(b), Family Code, states that a court must rule on an appeal by 5 p.m. 
on  the  fifth  business  day  after  the  notice  of  appeal  is  filed  with  the  court 
that  denied  the  application,  or  if  the  minor  requests  a  postponement,  by  5 
p.m. on the fifth business day after the date the minor states she is ready to 
proceed.

(d) 

Postponement  by  minor.  The  minor  may  postpone  the  time  of  ruling  by 
written request filed either with the trial court clerk at the time she files the 
notice  of  appeal  or  thereafter  with  the  court  of  appeals  clerk.  The  request 
may  be  submitted  on  Form  3B,  but  use  of  the  form  is  not  required.  The 
request  must  either  specify  a  date  on  which  the  minor  will  be  ready  to 
proceed to ruling, or state that the minor will later provide a date on which 
she will be ready to proceed to ruling. Once the minor determines when she 
will be ready to proceed to ruling, she must notify the court of appeals clerk 
of that date in writing. 

(e)  Opinion. 

(1)  Opinion  optional;  must  preserve  confidentiality.  A  court  of  appeals 
may issue an opinion explaining its ruling, but it is not required to do 
so.  An  opinion  that  is  designated  for  publication  or  public  release 
must  be  written  in  a  way  to  preserve  the  confidentiality  of  the 
identity of the minor. 

(2) 

Time. Any opinion must issue not later than: 

(A)  

ten business days after the day on which a notice of appeal is 
filed  in  the  Supreme  Court,  if  an  appeal  is  taken  to  the 
Supreme Court; or 

(B) 

sixty days after the day on which the court of appeals issued 
its judgment, if no appeal is taken to the Supreme Court. 

(3) 

Transmission  to  Supreme  Court  and  trial  court.  When  the  court  of 
appeals issues an opinion, the clerk must transmit it immediately to 
the  Supreme  Court  and  to  the  trial  court.  If  the  opinion  is  not 
designated  for  publication  or  public  release,  the  transmission  must 
be confidential. 

(f) 

 
Failure  to  timely  rule.  If  the  court  of  appeals  fails  to  timely  rule  on  the 
appeal, the trial court’s judgment is deemed to be affirmed. 

Notes and Comments 
 

Chapter  33,  Family  Code,  provides  for  no  appeal  from  an  order  granting  an 
application. 

A  request  to  postpone  the  ruling  of  the  court  of  appeals  may  be  used  in 
conjunction with a request for oral argument or to submit briefing.

Neither Chapter 33, Family Code, nor these rules prescribe the appellate standard 
of review. 

The 2015 amendments to Chapter 33, Family Code, permit the court of appeals to 
publish  an  opinion  “if  the  opinion  is  written  in  a  way  to  preserve  the 
confidentiality of the identity of the pregnant minor.” TEX. FAM. CODE § 33.004(c-
1). Any opinion that is released to the public must not only omit the minor’s name 
and  other  directly  identifying  information  but  it  must  also  describe  the  facts  in  a 
way that those who know the minor would not be able to recognize her.  

 
RULE 4.  APPEAL TO THE SUPREME COURT 
 
4.1  How to Appeal to the Supreme Court. To appeal from the court of appeals to the 
Supreme  Court,  the  minor  must  file  a  notice  of  appeal  with  the  clerk  of  the 
Supreme Court, file a  copy of the notice of  appeal  with  the clerk  of the court of 
appeals,  and  advise  the  clerk  of  each  court  by  telephone  that  an  appeal  is  being 
taken  under  Chapter  33,  Family  Code.  The  minor  may  use  Form  4A  but  is  not 
required to do so. The notice of appeal must: 

(a) 

be styled “In re Jane Doe”; 

(b) 

state the number of the cause in the court of appeals; 

(c) 

state an intention to appeal; and 

(d) 

be signed by the minor’s attorney. 

.2  Clerk’s Duties. 

(a) 

Assistance  in  filing.  The  clerk  of  the  Supreme  Court  must  give  prompt 
assistance—in a manner designed to protect the minor’s confidentiality—to 
any person seeking to file an appeal. The clerk must ensure that the notice 
of appeal is addressed to the Supreme Court and that the minor’s name and 
identifying information are not disclosed. 

(b)  Forwarding record to Supreme Court. Upon receipt of a notice of appeal 
to the Supreme Court, the clerks of the court of appeals and Supreme Court 
must immediately forward to the Supreme Court the record that was before 
the court of appeals.
