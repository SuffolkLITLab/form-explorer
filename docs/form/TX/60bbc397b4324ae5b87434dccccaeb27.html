OFFICE OF THE STATE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY (213) 
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2021 (UNAUDITED) 

The Office of the State Prosecuting Attorney is an agency of the State of Texas and its financial 
records  comply  with  state  statutes  and  regulations.  This  includes  compliance  with  the  Texas 
Comptroller of Public Accounts’ Reporting Requirements for State Agencies. 

Due to the significant changes related to Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement 
No. 34, Basic Financial Statements – and Management’s Discussion and Analysis – for State 
and Local Governments, the Comptroller of Public Accounts does not require the accompanying 
annual financial report to be in compliance with general accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  
The financial report will be considered for audit by the State Auditor as part of the audit of the 
State  of  Texas  Comprehensive  Annual  Financial  Report;  therefore,  an  opinion  has  not  been 
expressed on the financial statements and related information contained in this report. 

This note is limited to a discussion of only governmental funds to reflect the organization 
of this state agency. 

FUND STRUCTURE 
The accompanying financial statements are presented on the basis of funds and account groups, 
each of which is considered a separate accounting entity. 

Governmental Fund Types and Government-wide Adjustment Fund Types  

General Revenue Funds 
The General Revenue Fund is the principal operating fund used to account for most of 
the  state’s  general  activities.    It  accounts  for  all  financial  resources  except  those 
accounted for in the other funds. 

Capital Asset Adjustment Fund Type 
Capital Asset Adjustment Fund will be used to convert governmental fund types’ capital 
assets from modified accrual to full accrual. 

Long-Term Liabilities Adjustment Fund will be used to convert governmental fund types’ 
debt from modified accrual to full accrual.

Fiduciary Fund Types 

Agency Funds 

Agency  funds  are  used  to  account  for  assets  held  as  an  agent  for  individuals,  other 
government entities, and/or other funds. These funds are custodial in nature and do not

ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2021 (UNAUDITED) 

involve measurement of results of operations. 

Basis of Accounting 

The  basis  of  accounting  determines  when  revenues  and  expenditures  or  expenses  are 
recognized in the accounts reported in the financial statements.  The accounting and financial 
reporting treatment applied to a fund is determined by its measurement focus.  

Governmental fund types that build the fund financial statements are accounted for using the 
modified accrual method basis of accounting.  Under the modified accrual method, revenues are 
recognized  in  the  period  in  which  they  become  both  measurable  and  available  to  finance 
operations of the fiscal year or liquidate liabilities existing at fiscal year-end. The State of Texas 
considers receivables collected within sixty days after year-end to be available and recognizes 
them as revenues of the current year for Fund Financial Statements prepared on the modified 
basis of accrual. Expenditures and other uses of financial resources are recognized when they 
related liability is incurred. 

Budgets and Budgetary Accounting 

The budget is prepared biennially and represents appropriations authorized by the legislature 
and approved by the governor (the General Appropriations Act).  

Unencumbered appropriations are generally subject to lapse 60 days after the end of the fiscal 
year for which they were appropriated. 

SSETS, LIABILITIES, AND FUND BALANCES/NET ASSETS 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are 
considered cash equivalents. 

nventories and Prepaid Items 
Inventories include consumable supplies and postage on hand at year-end.  Inventories 
are  valued  at  cost,  generally  using  the  last-in,  first-out  method.    Inventories  for 
governmental  fund  types  are  the  purchase  method  of  accounting.  The  consumption 
method of accounting is used to account for inventories that appear in governmental fund 
types.  The cost of these items is expensed when the items are used or consumed. 

apital Assets 

Assets with an initial, individual cost of more than $5,000 and an estimated useful life in 
excess of one year should be capitalized.  These assets are capitalized at cost or, if not 
purchased, at appraised fair value as of the date of acquisition.  Purchases of assets by 
governmental  funds  are  reported  as  expenditures.    Depreciation  is  reported  on  all 
“exhaustible” assets.  Assets are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset 
using the straight-line method.

urrent Receivables 

Other  receivables  include  year-end  revenue  accruals.    This  account  can  appear  in 
governmental and proprietary fund types. 

on-Current Receivables – Other 

There are no receivables not expected to be collected within one year. 

Liabilities 

Accounts Payable 
Accounts Payable represents the liability for the value of assets or services received at 
the balance sheet date for which payment is pending. 

ther Payables – Current 

Payables  are  the  accrual  at  year-end  of  expenditures  transactions.  Payables  may  be 
included in either the government or proprietary fund types. 

ther Payables – Non-current 

There are no payables not expected to be paid within one year. 

mployees' Compensable Leave 

Employees’ compensable leave balances represent the liability that becomes “due” upon 
the occurrence of relevant events such as resignations, retirements and uses of leave 
balances by covered employees. Liabilities are reported separately as either current or 
noncurrent in the   statement of net position. These obligations are normally paid from the 
same  funding  source  from  which  each  employee’s  salary  or  wage  compensation  was 
paid. 

Fund Balance/Net Position 

The  difference  between  fund  assets  and  liabilities  is  ‘Net  Assets’  on  the  government-wide, 
proprietary and fiduciary fund statements, and the ‘Fund Balance’ is the difference between fund 
assets and liabilities on the governmental fund statements. 
 

Fund Balance Components 
Fund  balances  for  governmental  funds  are  classified  as  non-spendable,  restricted, 
committed, assigned or unassigned in the fund financial statements

Non-spendable:  Fund  balances  for  governmental  funds  include  amounts  that 
cannot  be  spent  because  they  are  either  not  in  a  spendable  form  or  legally  or 
contractually required to maintain intact. 

Restricted:  Represent  resources  with  constraints  placed  upon  the  use  of  the 
sources  by  either  externally  imposed  by  creditors,  grantors,  contributors,  law  or 
regulations  of  other  governments  or  imposed  by  law constitutional  provisions  or 
enabling legislation. 
 

OFFICE OF THE STATE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY (213) 
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2021 (UNAUDITED) 

Committed: Fund balance amounts that can only be used for specific purposes 
pursuant to constraints imposed by the formal action of the state’s highest level of 
decision-making authority (the Legislature).   These amounts cannot be used for 
any other purpose unless the Legislature removes or changes the specified use 
by taking the same type of action it employed to previously commit those amounts. 

ssigned:  Represent  amounts  constrained  by  the  intent  of  an  agency  head  or 
governing  board  to  use  the  resources  for  specific  purposes,  and  the  amount  is 
neither but are neither restricted nor committed.   

nassigned:  Represent  amounts  that  have  not  been  restricted,  committed  or

assigned to specific purposes. 

 

INTERFUND ACTIVITIES AND TRANSACTIONS 

The agency may have the following types of transactions between funds: 

(1) Transfers: Legally required transfers that are reported when incurred as “transfers in” 
by the recipient fund and as “transfers out” by the disbursing fund. 

(2)  Reimbursements:  Reimbursements  are  repayments  from  funds  responsible  for 
expenditures or expenses to funds that made the actual payment. Reimbursements of 
expenditures  made  by  one  fund  for  another  that  are  recorded  as  expenditures  in  the 
reimbursing  fund  and  as  a  reduction  of  expenditures  in  the  reimbursed  fund. 
Reimbursements are not displayed in the financial statements. 

(3)  Interfund  receivables  and  payables:  Interfund  loans  are  reported  as  interfund 
receivables and payables. If repayment is due during the current year or soon thereafter, 
the balance is classified as “current.” Balances for repayment due in two (or more) years 
are classified as “noncurrent.” 

(4) Interfund Sales and Purchases: Charges or collections for services rendered by one 
fund to another that are recorded as revenues of the recipient fund (interfund services 
provided) and expenditures or expenses of the disbursing fund (interfund services used). 

The composition of the agency’s interfund activities and transactions are presented in Note 12 
when required.

in governmental fund types. For these fund types, the liability for unpaid benefits is recorded in 
the  statement  of  net  position.  Both  an  expense  and  a  liability  for  business-type  activities  are 
recorded in the proprietary funds as the benefits accrue to employees. No liability is recorded 
for non-vesting employees accumulating rights to receive sick pay benefits. This obligation is 
usually  paid  from  the  same  funding  source(s)  from  which  the  employee’s  salary  or  wage 
compensation was paid
