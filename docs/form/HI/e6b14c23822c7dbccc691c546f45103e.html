      <pre>PRO-SE PACKET 

GUARDIANSHIP -- INCAPACITATED PERSON 

FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 

This packet describes the steps necessary to establish a guardianship of an 

incapacitated person under the new Act 161 of 2004, which was effective as of 
January 1, 2005.   Please note that this packet does NOT  address the situation in 
which a guardian was previously appointed by a will or other written document. 
Information is provided on preparing documents and presenting them for filing. 
Samples of the basic forms are also included. 

   

We strongly recommend that you seek the services of an attorney.  The Lawyer 

Referral Service (537-9140) of the Hawai`i State Bar Association may be able to 
provide names of attorneys, but they do not have information on any fees charged by 
the attorneys.   The  Volunteer Legal Services (528-7046) and the Legal Aid Society of 
Hawai`i (536-4302) offer assistance to people with low incomes who meet their financial 
criteria.  You may also consult the yellow pages of the telephone book for attorneys 
who specialize in family law. 

  

  

Should you decide to proceed on your own without the assistance of an attorney, 

you may wish to review  Hawai`i Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 560:1-401 and 560:5-304 
to 560:5-311 pertaining to Guardians of Incapacitated Persons.  You are responsible for 
ensuring that your documents comply with Rule 3 of the Rules of the Circuit Court, 
applicable Hawai`i Family Court Rules, applicable sections of the Hawai`i Revised 
Statutes, as well as any memoranda issued by the Family Court. 

Copies of these statutes, rules and memoranda are available at the Hawai`i 

Supreme Court Law Library - 417 South King Street, behind the King Kamehameha 
 
statue).  Court rules and statutes are also available on-line at www.courts.state.hi.us 
(rules) and www.capitol.hawaii.gov/hrscurrent (statutes). 

In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, and other applicable state and federal laws, if you require a reasonable 
accommodation for a disability, please contact the ADA Coordinator at the First Circuit Family Court office at  PHONE NO.  954­
8200, FAX  954-8308 or via  email  at  adarequest@courts.hawaii.gov  at  least  ten (10) working  days  prior to  your hearing  or 
appointment date.

OVERVIEW OF DOCUMENTS IN THIS PACKET 

This packet includes the following forms.  Should you wish to have more than 
one person serve as co-guardians, you will need to amend pertinent portions of the 
documents to show that this is a co-guardianship case. 

1)  "Petition for Appointment of a Guardian of an Incapacitated Person" 

states the factual and legal basis for the appointment of a guardian and asks the court 
to issue an Order appointing a guardian. 

2)  "Notice of Hearing" is attached to the Petition.  Court personnel will schedule 

the hearing and fill in the blank spaces for the date and time of hearing.  (see the 
instructions on page 4.) 

3)  "List of Exhibits" - this cover sheet organizes supporting documents  that are 

submitted at the time of the filing the Petition. 

4)  "Waiver of Notice and Consent to Guardianship" informs the court that a 

person, who is otherwise entitled to notice, agrees to have the guardianship 
proceedings take place without his or her involvement.  This document may be filed to 
support the Petition for Appointment of a Guardian of an Incapacitated Person.  The 
proposed guardian and the alleged incapacitated person are always expected to attend 
the hearing, unless previously excused by the court.  The alleged incapacitated person 
cannot waive notice of the hearing. 

This form allows interested parties to be able to waive the requirement that they 

be given at least 14 -days advance notice of the hearing on the Petition.  It also has a 
check off box if the interested party wants to waive notice of any future hearings. 

5)  Order Appointing Guardian with [   ] Limited [  ] Unlimited Authority; 

 

 

Exhibit A - contains the Judge's findings and states, among other things, the conditions 
under which the guardian shall serve and the events that will terminate the 
guardianship.   See other documents listed under the heading, "After the Hearing." 

 

HOW TO PREPARE DOCUMENTS FOR FILING

If you wish to add the information to the blank forms, please type in the 
information.   Also, please adjust or delete phrases (noted on the sam ple 
forms, in parentheses)  to fit the information in your case  
your own documents on your computer, then all documents must be typed 

If you type

in black ink using 12 point pica size print.  A 10 point elite size print is not 
acceptable.  On the first page of each document, the name of the Court 
(for example, “Family Court of the First Circuit”) shall be centered and be 
not less than 3" from the top of the page.  Top and bottom margins on the 
other pages  must be 1".  The left and right-hand margins shall not be less 
than 1".  

Signature	  Documents must be dated and signed in legible, dark ink. 
  
Terms: 

The “Petitioner” is the person requesting the guardianship.   Any person
 interested in the alleged incapacitated person’s welfare may submit the 
petition.  The Petition requests that someone be appointed as the 
“Guardian.”  In the Petition, the alleged incapacitated person is referred 
to as the “Respondent.”  After a guardianship is granted, the 
 
incapacitated person is referred to as the “Ward.” 

 

 

 

Case name and number: 

Name:	 

Copies	 

Filing:	 

 All documents filed in the same case record must have the same case 
name (the name of the Respondent noted in the case caption on the lef t 
hand side of the caption on the first page.   These documents should also 
have the same "FC-G" (for example, FC-G No. 06-1-0002)   case number 
in the right-hand side of the caption on the first page of the document. 

 

 

Be sure to print the Petitioner's name, address and phone number on the 
upper left-hand corner of the first page of each document.  A daytime or 
cell phone number is important so that the court can call and notif y you 
that your documents are ready to be picked up for filing.  You are 
responsible for filing your documents.  The Court cannot file the 
documents for you. 

You need to make enough copies of each original document.   Each 
person who is required to receive notice (see section entitled “Service of 
Documents”) must have a copy.   Be sure to keep a copy for yourself. 

  

 

All documents must be filed with the Legal Documents Branch which is 
located on the first floor of the Ronald T. Y. Moon Courthouse, 4675 
Kapolei Parkway, Kapolei, Hawai‘i 96707 or on the first floor of the  
Kaahumanu Hale,  First Circuit Court building at 777 Punchbowl Street, 
Honolulu, Hawai‘i 96813.   "Filed" means that the original documents (the 
original document with original signatures; not copies) has an original file-
stamped (date and time) and the name of the Documents Filing Clerk on 
the upper right-hand corner of the first page of the document.   This "filed" 
original is kept by the Family Court as part of the guardianship case 
record.

Conforming copies: 

   

All copies must be "conformed."  "Conforming" means that any changes 
the Court made to your original documents and added to your copies, so 
that the text of the copies are identical to the original document.  For 
example, if a date and time for a court hearing are added to the Notice of 
Hearing, you must add this same date and time to ALL copies of the 
Notice of Hearing.  This ensures that all persons receiving the Notice of 
Hearing will have the same information. 

PRESENTING DOCUMENTS TO OBTAIN HEARING DATE 

After completing all of the necessary forms, you must obtain a hearing date from 
the Judicial Services Branch.  To do this, you must drop off the original and appropriate 
number of copies of your documents to Window #5 on the first floor at the Ronald T. Y. 
Moon Courthouse, 4675 Kapolei Parkway, Kapolei, Hawai‘i or place your guardianship 
documents in an envelope addressed to the Special Division Calendar Clerk, Judicial 
Service Branch and drop the envelope in the Judicial Services court jacket located at 
the Legal Documents Branch on the first floor of the Kaahumanu Hale, 777 Punchbowl 
Street, Honolulu, Hawai‘i.   After a hearing date has been assigned, you will be 
contacted--by telephone--to pick up the documents.  Again, we emphasize the 
importance of including your daytime or cellular phone number on documents turned in 
to the court.  Your documents may be picked up at Window #5 at the Kapolei 
courhouse. 

   

PRESENTING DOCUMENTS FOR INITIAL FILING 

When you pick up the documents, please make sure that the hearing date and 

time is reflected on the original notice of hearing and on all the copies.  You must 
conform the copies (i.e.,, fill in this same information that is on the original on all of the 
other copies you submitted).  You may do this by writing in or stamping the information 
that the court added to the original document.  Be sure that the information is exactly 
the same as on the original.  It is critical that you include the date and time of the 
hearing on all copies of the Notice of Hearing. 

 

To file the documents, present the original and all copies to a Documents 

Receiving Clerk in the Legal Documents Branch on the first floor of the Ronald T. Y. 
Moon Courthouse, 4675 Kapolei Parkway, Kapolei, Hawai‘i or on the first floor of the 
Kaahumanu Hale, 777 Punchbowl Street, Honolulu, Hawai‘i.  Ask the clerk to certify all 
copies of the petition and notice.  A $215.00 f iling fee is required to file the Petition. 
Filing fees may be paid in person by cash, cashier's check or money order.  Please 
make all cashier's checks or money  orders payable to "Chief Clerk, First Circuit Court".

If you are paying by cashier's check or money order,  the Documents Receiving 
Clerk will accept your cashier's check or money order, assign a case number, and file 
your documents and return copies to you.  A receipt will be mailed to the filing party 
within 48 hours to confirm the payment. 

If you are paying in cash, the Documents Receiving Clerk will assign a case 
number and direct you to the Cashier's Section to pay the filing fee and surcharge. 
After you have paid your fees, return to the Legal Documents Branch counter to have 
the documents filed. 

It is preferable that certified copies of your documents be served on the parties. 
The Documents Receiving Clerk will certify as many copies as requested at the time of 
filing of your documents.   There is an additional charge should you request certified 
copies at a later date.

Hearing" on all parties entitled to notice under HRS §560:5-309 by the appropriate

statement that the Respondent must be physically present unless excused by the 
Court, inform the Respondent of the Respondent’s rights at the hearing, and include a

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
