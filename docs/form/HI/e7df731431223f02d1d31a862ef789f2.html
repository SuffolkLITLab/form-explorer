      <pre>PRO-SE PACKET 

GUARDIANSHIP -- MINOR PERSON 

FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 

This packet describes the steps necessary to establish a guardianship of a 
minor under the new Act 161 of 2004, which was effective as of January 1, 2005. 
 
Please note that this packet does NOT address the situation in which a guardian was 
previously appointed by a will or other written document.   Information is provided on 
preparing documents and presenting them for filing.  Samples of the basic forms are 
also included. 

We strongly recommend that you seek the services of an attorney.  The Lawyer 

Referral Service (537-9140) of the Hawai`i State Bar Association may be able to 
provide names of attorneys, but they do not have information on any fees charged by 
the attorneys.  The Volunteer Legal Services (528-7046) and the Legal Aid Society of 
Hawai`i (536-4302) offer assistance to people with low incomes who meet their 
financial criteria.  Presently, Legal Aid’s "Courthouse Assistance Program" office is on 
the fourth floor of the Kapolei Court Complex, 4675 Kaplei Parkway, in Kapolei 
and is open every weekday morning.  You may also consult the 
yellow pages of the telephone book for attorneys who specialize in family law. 

 

 

Should you decide to proceed on your own without the assistance of an 
attorney, you may wish to review Sections 560:1-401 and 560:5-201 to 560:5-210 of 
the Hawai`i Revised Statutes pertaining to Guardians  of Minors.  You are responsible 
for ensuring that your documents comply with Rule 3 of the Rules of the Circuit Court, 
applicable Hawai`i Family Court Rules, applicable sections of the Hawai`i Revised 
Statutes, as well as any memoranda issued by the Family Court. 

Copies of these statutes, rules and memoranda are available at the Hawai`i 

Supreme Court Law Library - 417 South King Street, behind the King Kamehameha 
statue).  Court rules and statutes are also available on-line at www.courts.state.hi.us 
 
(rules) and www.capitol.hawaii.gov (statutes). 

OVERVIEW OF DOCUMENTS IN THIS PACKET 

This packet includes the following forms.  Should you wish to have more than 
one person serve as co-guardians, you will need to amend pertinent portions of the 
documents to show that this is a co-guardianship case. 

1)  "Petition for Appointment of a Guardian of a Minor " states the factual 

 

1FC-G eff. date 4/06 
RG-AC-508 (12/17) 

-1­

1F-P-2007 

and legal basis for the appointment of a guardian and asks the court to issue an Order 
Appointing Guardian with [ 

 ] Unlimited Authority. 

] Limited [

   

   

2)  "Notice of Hearing" is attached to the Petition.  Court personnel will 
schedule the hearing and fill in the blank spaces for the date and time of hearing (see 
the instructions on page 3). 

3)  "List of Exhibits" - this cover sheet organizes supporting documents that 

are submitted at the time of filing the Petition. 

4)  "Waiver of Notice and Consent to Guardianship" informs the court that a 

person, who is otherwise entitled to notice, agrees to have the guardianship 
proceedings take place without his or her involvement.  This document may be filed to 
support the Petition for Appointment of Guardian.  The proposed guardian is always 
expected to attend the hearing, unless previously excused by the court. 

This form allows interested parties to be able to waive the requirement that they 

be given at least 14-days advance notice of the hearing on the Petition.  It also has a 
check off box if the interested party wants to waive notice of any future hearings. 

5)  Order Appointing Guardian with [  ] Limited  [

   

   

 ] Unlimited Authority ­

contains the Judge's findings and states, among other things, the conditions under 
which the guardian shall serve and the events that will terminate the guardianship. 

HOW TO PREPARE DOCUMENTS FOR FILING 

Typing 

If you use the attached forms, please type in the information.   Also, 
please adjust or delete phrases (noted on the attached forms, in 
parentheses) to fit the information in your case.
your own documents on your computer, then all documents must be 
typed in black ink using 12 point pica size print.  A 10 point elite size print 
is not acceptable.   On the first page of each new document, the name of 
the Court (for example, “Family Court of the First Circuit”) shall be 
centered and be not less than 3" from the top of the page.  Top and 
bottom margins of the other pages must be 1".  The left and right-hand 
 
margins shall not be less than 1". 

 If you prefer to type 

   

Signature  Documents must be dated and signed in legible, dark ink.

any person interested in the minor’s welfare may submit the petition.  
The Petition requests that someone be appointed as the “Guardian.”

Case name and number: 

  
Name	 

Copies	 
 

Filing:	 

 All documents filed in the same case record must have the same case 
name (the name of the Respondent noted in the case caption on the left 
hand side of the caption on the first page.   These documents should 
also have the same "FC-G" (for example, FC-G No. 06-1-0002)   case 
number in the right-hand side of the caption on the first page of the 
document. 

 

 

Be sure to print the Petitioner's name, address and phone number on the 
upper left-hand corner of the first page of each document.  A daytime or 
cell phone number is important so that the Court can call and notify you 
that your documents are ready to be picked up for filing. You are 
responsible for filing your documents.   The Court cannot file the 
documents for you. 

You need to make enough copies of each original document.  Each 
person who is required to receive notice (see section entitled “Service of 
Documents”) must have a copy.  Be sure to keep a copy for yourself. 

   

All documents must be filed with the Legal Documents Branch which is 
located on the first floor of the Kapolei Court Complex, 4675 Kapolei 
Parkway, or the first floor of the Kaahumanu Hale.   "Filed" means that the
original documents (the original document with original signatures; not 
copies) has an original file-stamped (date and time) and the name of the 
Documents Filing Clerk on the upper right-hand corner of the first page of 
 
the document.   This "filed" original is kept by the Family Court as part of 
the guardianship case record. 

All copies must be "conformed."  "Conforming" means that any changes 
the Court made to your original documents and added to your copies, so 
that the text of the copies are identical to the original document.  For 
example, if a date and time for a court hearing are added to the Notice of 
Hearing, you must add this same date and time to ALL copies of the 
Notice of Hearing.  This ensures that all persons receiving the Notice of 
Hearing will have the same information. 

Conforming copies: 

   

PRESENTING DOCUMENTS FOR INITIAL FILING 

To get a hearing date, after completing all of the necessary forms, present the 

original copy plus the necessary number of copies to one of the clerks at the counter in 
the Judicial Services Branch, 4th Floor of the Kapolei Court Complex.  You must leave the
documents for processing and you will be contacted--by telephone--to pick up the 

 

 

1FC-G eff. date 4/06

documents.  Again, we emphasize the importance of including your daytime or cellular 
phone number on documents turned in to the Court. 

When you pick up the documents, you will notice that the date and time of the 

hearing has been filled in on the original copy only of the Notice of Hearing.  You must 
conform the copies (i.e., fill in this same information on all of the other copies you 
submitted).  You may do this by writing in or stamping the information that the Court 
added to the original document.  Be sure that the information is exactly the same as on 
the original.  As an alternative, you may photocopy the documents after you pick them 
up from the Court.   It is critical that you include the date and time of the hearing on all 
copies of the Notice of Hearing. 

 

To file the documents, present the original and all copies to a Legal Documents

Receiving Clerk on the first floor of the Kapolei Court Complex or the Kaahumanu 
Hale.  Submit as many copies as you need to give to the persons who must receive 
notice (see HRS section 560:5-205), including the one for yourself.  A $215.00 filing 
fee is required to file the Petition.  Filing fees may be paid in person by cash, cashier's 
check or money order.  Please make all cashier's checks or money orders payable to 
"Chief Clerk, First Circuit Court".   The Court does NOT accept personal checks. 

   

 

If you are paying by cashier's check or money order,  the Documents Receiving 
Clerk will accept your cashier's check or money order, assign a case number, and file 
your documents and return copies to you.  A receipt will be mailed to the filing party 
within 48 hours to confirm the payment. 

If you are paying in cash, the Documents Receiving Clerk will assign a case
 
number and direct you to the Cashier's Section to pay the filing fee and surcharge. 

After you have paid your fees, return to the Legal Documents Branch counter to have
 
the documents filed.
 

It is preferable that certified copies of your documents be served on the parties. 
The Documents Receiving Clerk will certify as many copies as requested at the time of 
filing of your documents.    There is an additional charge should you request certified 
copies at a later date. 

SERVICE OF THE DOCUMENTS 

You must serve copies of the "Petition for Guardianship" and the "Notice of 

Hearing" on all parties entitled to notice under HRS § 560:5-205 by the appropriate 
method of service as described in that section, in HRS § 560:1-401, and in Rule 4 of 
the Hawai`i Family Court Rules.

If you do not have at least one of the documents noted above (#1-4) for each 

person listed in #A-K, if applicable, that person must be present at the hearing.  If you 
received prior approval from the court to serve notice by publication, it should be 
coordinated so that the last day of the publication is at least 10 days prior to the hearing 
(HRS § 560:1-401(a)(3)). 

You DO NOT have to serve non-legal biological parents. 

At the court hearing, you must be able to prove that: 

. 
. 

. 

.	 

. 

. 

the proposed guardian(s) is/are qualified (HRS § 560:5-205(b)); 
  
minor resides or is present in the First Circuit (Oahu) at the time the 
proceeding is commenced (HRS § 560:5-108(a)) 
the best interests of the minor are served by the appointment of the 
proposed guardian(s) (HRS § 560:5-204 and 206; 
  
the minor’s parents consent, or all parental rights have been terminated, 
or the parents are unwilling or unable to exercise their parental rights 
(HRS § 560:5-204(b)); 
 
all notices were personally served or mailed at least 14 days prior to 
hearing  (HRS §§ 560:5-205 and  560:1-401); 
the minor is an unemancipated individual under 18 years of age 
 
(HRS § 560:5-102 (definition of “minor”).  

If you are seeking to waive notice to a person closest in kinship, you must prove 

the requirements of HRS § 560:5-205(a)(3)--that all reasonable efforts were made to 
identify and locate the person and those efforts were unsuccessful.  And, that the 
person has not demonstrated a reasonable degree of interest or concern in the minor 
child. 

These requirements are mandated by HRS §§ 560:5-204 and 560:5-205.  If they 

are not met, your case will be dismissed.  You may file birth, death or marriage 
certificates or proof of divorce, but they are not required. 

LIMITED GUARDIANSHIP 

In the interest of developing self-reliance of the minor, or for other good cause 

shown, the Court, with exceptions,  may limit the powers of the guardian.   Under other 
circumstances, the Court may grant additional powers or withdraw powers previously 
granted.

APPOINTMENT OF A GUARDIAN AD LITEM
 

The Court may appoint a Guardian Ad Litem for the minor to assist the Court by 
meeting with the minor and investigating the need for a guardianship.  You may have to 
pay for these services. 

APPOINTMENT OF AN ATTORNEY FOR THE MINOR 

The Court may also appoint an attorney to represent the minor, if the interests of 

the minor are or may be inadequately represented.  You may have to pay for these 
services. 

AFTER THE HEARING 

If the Court appoints a guardian,  the petitioner prepares an Order Appointing 

   

   

Guardian with [  ] Limited [  ] Unlimited Authority  and submit the order to the Court 
for the Judge's signature within ten (10) days of the hearing unless otherwise 
requested.  After the Order has been signed, the Court will advise you to pick up the 
document or they may mail it back to you if you had provided them with a stamped, 
self-addressed envelope.  You will be responsible for filing the document in the Legal 
Documents Branch.  The court will not file the documents for you. 

ANNUAL REPORTS: 

The Court may require the Guardian to submit a written report to the Court on 

 

the condition of the ward and an account of the money and other assets in the 
Guardian’s possession or subject to the Guardian’s control.   The Court may require 
that the written report be submitted annually and address the following:  (1) The current 
mental, physical, and social condition of the ward;   (2) The living arrangements for all
