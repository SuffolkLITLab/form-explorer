      <pre>GARNISHEE INFORMATION
 

NOTICE TO THE DEBTOR
 
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that a garnishee summons has been served upon your employer (who is called the “garnishee”) 
without any further court proceedings or notice to you.  The garnishee summons was issued on the basis of a judgment 
against you in favor of the judgment creditor. 

Form# 3DC27 

The amount of wages that may be garnished is limited by federal and Hawai'i law.  Therefore, some or all of your wages are 
exempt from garnishment.  If your wages are garnished, you may request that your employer show you how the amount 
garnished was calculated.  

If you claim the garnishment is incorrect you also have a right to request a hearing.  In order to request a hearing, you must 
follow the procedures set forth in the rules of this Court and in Hawai'i Revised Statutes § 652-1(d). 

NOTICE TO THE GARNISHEE 
Wages of your employees may be subject to garnishment when you are served with a Motion for Issuance of Garnishee 
Summons After Judgment or Declaration of Judgment Creditor for Garnishment of Wages.  If you are served with a Garnishee 
Summons, you, as the garnishee, are required to begin withholding immediately a part of your employee’s wages (including 
any salary, stipend, commission, annuity or net income or portion of net income under a trust).  The money you withhold must 
then be paid to the judgment creditor (the person or business who is owed the money) or the judgment creditor’s attorney after 
you receive the garnishee  order,  which will be sent to you.  If you are served with a Declaration of Judgment Creditor, you 
must begin paying the required portion of the garnished  wages to the judgment creditor or the judgment creditor’s attorney 
immediately. 

Making a Disclosure 
State law allows, but does not require, you to make a disclosure after you are served.  If you choose to make a disclosure, you 
may appear in Court or file with the Court a statement (form available from the Court) stating whether the judgment debtor 
is: (1) your employee; and (2) whether you have any  money  which is due to the judgment debtor that can be garnished.  If you 
do not make a disclosure, it will be assumed that the judgment debtor is your employee and you will be required to comply 
with the Garnishee Summons and Order or the Declaration of Judgment Creditor. 

Amounts To Be Withheld 
The amount of wages that may be deducted is limited by federal and Hawai'i  law.  Therefore, you must calculate the amount 
of  wages  to  be  withheld  in  accordance  with  either  federal  or  Hawai'i  law.    IMPORTANT:  YOU  MUST  USE  THE 
CALCULATION THAT IS MOST FAVORABLE TO YOUR EMPLOYEE.  A Garnishment Calculation Worksheet, 
Form# 3DC27C, is available if you need assistance with your calculation. 

Calculation Pursuant to Hawai'i Law: According to Hawai'i Revised Statutes Chapter 652, the amount to be withheld from 
your employee’s wages is calculated as follows: 

You must first calculate the amount of wages remaining after the deduction of any amounts required 
by law to be withheld. 
From that amount, you must withhold five percent of the first $100  per month,  ten percent of the next $100 
per month, and twenty percent of a  ll  sums  in excess of $200 per month, or an equivalent portion of the above 
amount per week. 

Calculation  Pursuant to Federal Law: According to Title III of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. § 1673), the 
amount to be withheld from your employee’s wages is calculated as follows: 

You must first calculate your employee’s DISPOSABLE EARNINGS for the applicable pay period.  The 
term “DISPOSABLE EARNINGS” is defined as compensation paid or payable for personal services 
after deducting any amounts required to be withheld by law (such as taxes).  The amount of 
Disposable Earnings subject to garnishment is determined by the restrictions that are in effect at the time 
such earnings are paid or payable. 
From  the  DISPOSABLE  EARNINGS,  you  must  withhold  an  amount  for  the  applicable  pay  period  as 
follows:

More than $942.50 but less 
than $1,256.67: 
Amount above $942.50 
$1,256.67 or more: 
Maximum 25% 

Example: Employee’s gross pay is $310.00 per week, $233.68 “disposable” after taxes and other deductions required by 
law. 

Hawai�i Calculation: The amount to be withheld under Hawai�i law is based on monthly disposable earnings of 
$1,012.61. Of this amount, 5% of the first $100, 10% of the second $100, and 20% of the remaining $812.61, 
should be withheld monthly, for a total of $177.52 per month. 

Federal Calculation: The amount to be withheld weekly under federal law is either the amount of disposable 
earnings over $217.50 ($11.28),  or 25% of disposable earnings if they are more than $262.00, for a total of $16.18 
per week or $70.11 per month. 
   [$233.68 - $217.50 = $16.18 x 52/12 = $70.11] 

Amount to be Withheld: Because the federal calculation is more favorable to the employee, $70.11 per month, or 
$16.18 per week, must be withheld. 

Example: Employee’s gross pay is $350.00 per week, $267.00 “disposable” after taxes and other deductions required by 
law. 

Hawai�i Calculation: The amount to be withheld under Hawai�i law is based on monthly disposable earnings of 
$1,157.00 ($267.00 x 52/12).  Of this amount, 5% of the first $100, 10% of the second $100, and 20% of the 
remaining $957.00, should be withheld monthly, for a total of $206.40 per month. 
   [$5.00 (5% x 1st  $100.00) + $10.00 (10% of 2nd $100.00) + $191.40 (20% of remaining $957.00) = $206.40] 

Federal Calculation: The amount to be withheld weekly under federal law is either the amount of disposable 
earnings over $217.50, or 25% of disposable earnings if they are more than $290.00, for a total of $49.50 per week 
or $214.50 per month. 
   [$267.00 - $217.50 = $49.50 x 52/12 = $214.50] 

Amount to be Withheld: Because the Hawai�i calculation is more favorable to the employee, $206.40 per month 
must be withheld. 

The law prohibits an employer from discharging any employee because the employee’s wages have been subjected to 
garnishment. 

Other Information 

An employer’s obligation to withhold is continuing.  If there is a period where the employee has not earned sufficient 
income, you must begin to withhold again as soon as the earnings of your employee increase sufficiently. 

Prior to making the final payment, you should contact the judgment creditor or the judgment creditor’s attorney 
to obtain the final payoff, amount which may include additional interest as allowed by law.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
