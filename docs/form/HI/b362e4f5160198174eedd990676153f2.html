The purpose of the hearing is to determine whether the Respondent should be ordered 
 
to obtain assisted community treatment.  If the Court finds that the Respondent is mentally 
ill or suffering from substance abuse beyond a reasonable doubt, and that all of the other 
criteria  in  paragraph  number  7  of  the  Petition  have  been  met  by  clear  and  convincing 
evidence, the Court shall order the Respondent to obtain assisted community treatment for 
a period of not more than one (1) year.  The Court may make other orders as provided by 
law. 
 
 
YOU ARE HEREBY FURTHER NOTIFIED that the Respondent, has been assigned 
 
a  guardian  ad  litem  to  represent  the  best  interests  of  the  Respondent  throughout  the 
proceeding, unless the court determined the existence of a guardian for the Respondent. 
The Respondent is also entitled to the assistance of his or her attorney and Respondent 
may contact his or her own attorney.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
