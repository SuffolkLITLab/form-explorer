If you are the Defendant and you do not come to the hearing on the date and time shown above, the 
Court may order you to pay the Plaintiff the amount requested in the Statement of Claim. This is called 
 
a Default Judgment. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If you are the Plaintiff and you do not come to the hearing, the Court may dismiss your case. 
 

No, the hearing is not a trial and witnesses do not need to be present.  If and when the Judge 
 
schedules your case for trial, witnesses must come to court on the trial date. 
 
 
At trial, you may also ask the Judge to look at documents that support your case.  You must bring 
 
those documents, with at least 2 copies, to the trial. 
 

  

 

 

   

May I hire an attorney? 
 

 

Yes. You may come to the hearing with or without an attorney. 
 

May I bring witnesses and documents to support my case to the hearing? 

 

  

   

The Court can help you make sure a witness comes to the trial by issuing a subpoena.  If you wish to 
subpoena witnesses, contact the Clerk of Court as soon as possible after you receive your trial date. 

 

How can I make sure my witnesses show up for the trial? 

 

 

 

 

 

How can I get the case moved to a different court? 
 

 

 

A small claims case can only be transferred to the Court’s Regular Claims Division if the Plaintiff agrees 
to the transfer. If the Plaintiff agrees to the transfer, you must pay the regular claims filing fee to this 
Court. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

Defendant, if you file a counterclaim for more than $5,000, then either you or the Plaintiff may ask for a 
 
jury trial. Once the jury fee is paid, the Court will decide if the case should be transferred to the Circuit 
 
Court. 
 

 

 

If I lose the case, may I appeal it? 
 

 

 

No. In a small claims action, the Judge’s decision is final. You MAY NOT appeal a judgment of the Small 
 
 
Claims Division. 
 

 

 

Instructions to the Plaintiff about delivering this form to the Defendant 
 

 

 

 

 

You must deliver a full copy of this form to the Defendant, either by registered or certified mail, with restricted 
 
delivery, or by personal service. Please read the Instructions on the Service of Process Information Sheet 
 
carefully before you try to serve the Defendant. 
 

 

Restriction on personal service: This claim may not be personally delivered between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. 
 
unless it is served at a location that is open to the public, or unless a Judge of this Court, by written order, 
permits personal delivery during those hours.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
