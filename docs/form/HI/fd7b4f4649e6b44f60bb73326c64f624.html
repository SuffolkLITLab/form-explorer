Your divorce becomes final when the Civil Union Divorce Decree is  signed by  the Judge and filed by the Court. 
Certified copies of the Civil Union Divorce Decree will be mailed to you and your partner in the envelopes 
 
which  you  provided.    You  can  track  the  status  of  your  case  on  the  Judiciary’s  web  page
(www.couirts.state.hi.us) using the Ho‘ohiki Program.  It takes between 4 to 6 weeks for the final Decree to 
be mailed. If your divorce is  denied, the Court will mail you instructions on what needs to be done before the 
court will grant the divorce.
