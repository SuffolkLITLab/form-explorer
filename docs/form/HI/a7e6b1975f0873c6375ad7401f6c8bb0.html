instrument covered by Rule 62(a) to 62(d) of these Rules to be recorded in the

fly sheet is counted as a page in the page count of the instrument, but except for 

NEW RULE 

- 2 ­

the information required or permitted to be shown on the fly sheet by statute or 
rule the fly sheet shall not be considered a part of the instrument itself and the 
instrument shall control in the event of any inconsistency.  Except as specifically 
permitted by this Rule, a fly sheet may not be used to change, correct or add to 
any information that is not otherwise contained in the instrument being presented 
for recordation. 

Any indorsement permitted by statute or by these rules shall be stated only 

on a fly sheet in conformance with this Rule. 

(a)  Form.  A fly sheet shall be 8 ½ inches by 11 inches in size with 

printing on only one side.  The fly sheet shall conform to the format and 
information requirements of Hawai'i Revised Statutes §§ 501-108, 502-31; Haw. 
Admin. Rule 13-16-4; and Rules 3 and 58(7) of the Rules of the Land Court: 

(1)  the top 3 ½ inches of space shall be reserved for recording information 

for the assistant registrar on the left half of that space and for the registrar of 
conveyances on the right half of that space; and 

(2)  the following 1 inch of space shall be reserved for information 

indicating to whom the instrument should be returned.  A suggested, but not 
required, form of a fly sheet is appended to the Appendix of Forms of these 
Rules as Form LD Form B. 

(b)  Other Information Permitted to be Shown on a Fly Sheet. 
Provided that the instrument itself shall control in the event of any 
inconsistency, the following information is permitted to be shown on a fly sheet: 

(1)  the name, address, and telephone number of the person to whom the 
instrument should be returned; this information shall be included within the 1 
inch space described above; 

(2)  the total number of pages of the instrument including the fly sheet; 
(3)  if an instrument contains an abbreviation or abbreviations of an initial 
or initials in place of the first or middle names(s) of an individual who is  a party 
to the instrument, the full legal name of the individual may be stated on the fly 
sheet by spelling out the name designated by the abbreviation or initial.  No 
name may be added by indorsement on the fly sheet if there is no abbreviation or 
initial designated in the instrument, and no name may be added or changed by 
indorsement on the fly sheet if the abbreviation or initial contained in the 
instrument is incomplete or incorrect; 

(4)  the fly sheet shall not be used to clarify or add any portion of a name 

of a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other legal entity 
which is a party to the instrument; 

(5)  if no marital status is contained in the instrument for any party to the 
instrument, the party’s marital status may be specified for that party.  A marital 
status that is contained in the instrument may not be changed by indorsement on 
the fly sheet; 

(6)  if the instrument does not contain the state or jurisdiction of 
incorporation or organization of a corporation, partnership, limited liability 
company, or other legal entity which is a party to the instrument, it may be added 
by indorsement on the fly sheet if authoritative verification of the information is 
submitted to the Assistant Registrar by way of evidence of good standing which 
meets the requirements of Rule 58(2) of these Rules; 

- 3 ­

(7)  if the certificate number contained in the instrument is not current,

Rule 62.  FILING LIENS, ETC.

required in such papers for recording with the records of deeds, it shall also 
contain a reference to the number of the certificate to be affected.

owner of registered land, and the instrument contains or has indorsed upon [it] a 
fly sheet conforming to Rule 58.5 of the Rules the proper number of the 
certificate affected, the assistant registrar shall note such fact by entry of an 
appropriate memorandum on the certificate. After such memorandum has been 
entered on the certificate, no conveyance by the registered owner shall be 
recorded unless the conveyance recites that it is made subject to the rights of the 
trustee in bankruptcy. 

(d)  Recording Notice of Pendency of Action. In any action concerning 

land or affecting the title or the right of possession of land, the plaintiff may 
record with the assistant registrar a certified copy of a notice of pendency of the

judgment or a copy thereof, certified as correct by a clerk of the court where it is

assignment of judgment or satisfaction of judgment shall contain a reference to 
the proper number of the certificate affected. 

(f)  Foreign Judgment. An exemplified copy of any judgment, decree 
or order of a court of the United States or of any other court which is entitled to 
full faith and credit in this state, when filed in the office of the clerk of the

the judgment shall be as provided by law (see HRS chapter 636C). 

(g)  Liens Upon Interests of Heirs and Devisees. Proper papers relating 

to an involuntary lien, charge or lis pendens against the interest of a relict, heir 
or devisee in the lands of a deceased registered owner, prior to the registration of 
the title of such relict, heir or devisee, may be recorded with the assistant 
registrar as in other cases, in which event the assistant registrar shall make entry 
thereof as a memorial on the certificate entered in the name of the deceased 
owner, giving the name and the address of the relict, heir or devisee against

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
