registered  nurse  (APRN)  with  prescriptive  authority  and  an  accredited  national 
certification in an APRN psychiatric specialization, the Respondent meets each of the 
four (4) criteria for assisted community treatment set forth in HRS §334-121, as follows:

I believe the Respondent is unlikely to live safely in the community without 
 
available supervision, is now in need of treatment in order to prevent relapse or 
 
deterioration that would predictably result in the Respondent becoming 
 
 
imminently dangerous to himself/herself or others, and the Respondent’s current 
 
mental status or the nature of his/her disorder limits or negates the 
Respondent’s ability to make an informed decision to voluntarily seek or with 
recommended treatment because of the following facts:

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
