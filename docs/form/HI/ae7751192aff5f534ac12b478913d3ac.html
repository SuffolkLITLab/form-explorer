INSTRUCTIONS FOR UNCONTESTED PATERNITY WITHOUT A HEARING 

LEASE NOTE:  Rule 9 of the Hawaii Court Record Rules; Parties’ Responsibility to Protect Personal Information and 

Account Numbers. Effective September 1, 2012 

Paternity proceedings  legally establish who, is the  father of  a child.   If the parents of a  child 
were not married  when  the  child is born,  Paternity  needs to be established before the  father has  any 
legal  rights  to  the  child.    Once  Paternity  is  established,  child  support,  custody,  and  visitation  for the 
child can be determined. 

If  the  child  was  born  after  July  1,  1999,  Paternity  may  have  been  established  through  a 
Voluntary Establishment of Paternity (VEP) by Parents form provided by  the hospital and signed by 
both parents.  If this form was signed, and you have custody, visitation and/or child support issues to 
resolve, please ask for the VEP packet. 

If the child was born before July 1, 1999 or the mother of the child was married and the natural 
(biological) father of the child is not her husband, Paternity must be established.  This packet includes 
the forms necessary to establish Paternity, and to get orders for custody, child support and visitation.  
These instructions and forms may be used ONLY IF the Paternity is uncontested (all parties are 
in total agreement of all issues). 

egal Aid brochures explaining Paternity and Child Custody are available at the Service Center.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
