INSTRUCTIONS FOR SERVICE BY MAIL AND POSTING IN 
LIEU OF PUBLICATION 

ote:  These  instructions  are  an  addition  to,  and  should  be  read  together  with,  the 
separate Uncontested Divorce packet.  These instructions apply only to Service 
by Mail in Lieu of Publication (“in lieu of” means instead of).  Be sure to read the 
other Divorce forms and instructions which explain the process, and identify the 
documents necessary, for the filing of a divorce. 

.  The Law:  The  Plaintiff  in  a  divorce  must  deliver  the  divorce  documents  to  the 
Defendant  according  to  the  rules  of  service.    Service  means  getting  copies  of  the 
documents certified (a certified copy has a Clerk’s signature and a raised stamp on 
the  copy)  at  the  courthouse,  and  hand  delivered  (by  the  Sheriff’s  office  or  by  any 
person, other than the Plaintiff, who is over 18 years old) to the Defendant. 

If  the  Defendant  lives  outside  of  Maui  County,  the  Court  may  allow  the  Plaintiff  to 
serve  the  Defendant  the  documents  by  certified  or  registered  mail  (with  a  return 
receipt requested and directions to deliver the documents to the Defendant only). 

If  the  Plaintiff  cannot  locate  the  Defendant to  serve  the divorce  documents,  a  legal 
notice must be published in the newspaper. 

If  the  Plaintiff  cannot  afford  the  costs  of  publication,  and  the  Plaintiff  has  made 
careful efforts to locate the Defendant (including an attempt to serve the Defendant 
by  mail),  the  Plaintiff  may  ask  the  court  for  permission  to  deliver  the  divorce 
documents by (1) mail and by (2) posting the documents at the courthouse that will 
hear the case. 

If the court grants the Plaintiff’s request for this type of service, the Plaintiff must mail 
certified  copies  of  the  divorce  documents  to  the  Defendant  and  to  the  Defendant’s 
closest  known  relative  (if  any  can  be  found)  by  certified  or  registered  mail  with  a 
return  receipt  requested  and  directions  to  deliver  the  documents  to  the  addressee 
only.  Copies must also be posted at the Courthouse that will hear the case. 

Service  is  complete  30  days  AFTER  mailing.    However,  the  law  also  gives  the 
Defendant  an  additional  20  days  to  respond.    Therefore,  the  divorce  will  not  be 
granted until after this 50 day period.  

.  The Process: If  (1)  you  are  unable  to  locate  your  spouse  after  careful  and  serious 
efforts  (including  an  attempt  to  serve  the  Defendant  by  mail)  and  (2)  you  are 
impoverished and cannot afford the costs of publication, and (3) you wish to request 
a  court  order  that  service  by  mail  and  posting  be  permitted  in  lieu  of  publication, 
please follow the steps below:

tep 4:  Mail  one  set  to  the  Defendant  and  one  set  to  the  Defendant’s  closest  known 
relative by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, with directions 
to  deliver  to  addressee  only.    Keep  the  postal  receipts,  which  show  that  you 
mailed the documents to each person.  These receipts will need to be taped to 
the  appropriate  Exhibit  number  in  your  Plaintiff’s  Affidavit  of  Mailing  in  Lieu  of 
Publication, as Exhibit “1” for Defendant and Exhibit “3” for Defendant’s relative. 

tep 5:  When  you  receive  the  envelope  returned  as  undeliverable,  or  a  signed  return 
receipt, tape these receipts to the appropriate Exhibit number in your Plaintiff’s 
Affidavit  of  Mailing  in  Lieu  of  Publication,  as  Exhibit  “2”  for  Defendant  and 
Exhibit “4” for Defendant’s relative.

tep 6:  Complete the  Plaintiff’s  Affidavit of  Mailing  in  Lieu of Publication.   Do not  sign 
the form.    Bring  the  completed form  to  the Legal  Documents  Branch  in  Room 
106, on the 1st floor of the Courthouse, located at 2145 Main Street, Wailuku, 
Maui,  Hawai`i.    The  Clerk  will  tell  you  when  to  sign  the  form,  and  how  many 
copies are needed. 

tep 7:  If at least FIFTY (50) days have passed since you mailed the documents to the 
Defendant as stated in Step 4 and if you have complied with Steps 4, 5 and 6, 
then  file  the  Request  for  Non-Hearing  Uncontested  Divorce  and  submit  your 
final  documentation  to  the  Legal  Documents  Branch  in  Room  106,  on  the  1st 
floor of the Courthouse, located at 2145 Main Street, Wailuku, Maui, Hawai`i. 

        Since the law provides that the Defendant has an additional 20 days after this 
30  day  period  in  which  to  respond  to  the  Court,  your  hearing  will  not  be 
scheduled  until  at  least  50  days  have  passed  since  you  first  mailed  the 
documents  to  the  Defendant.    Follow  the  divorce  packet  instructions  for 
information about submission of the final documents.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
