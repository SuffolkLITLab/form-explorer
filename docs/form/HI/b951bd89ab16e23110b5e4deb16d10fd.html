      <pre>INCOME WITHHOLDING FOR SUPPORT - Instructions 

The Income Withholding for Support (IWO) is the OMB-approved form used for income withholding
in Tribal, intrastate, and interstate cases as well as all child support orders which are initially issued
in the State on or after January 1, 1994, and all child support orders which are initially issued (or
modified) in the State before January 1, 1994 if arrearages occur. This form is the standard format
prescribed by the Secretary in accordance with 42 U.S.C. §666(b)(6)(A)(ii). Except as noted, the
following information must be included: 

# For the purpose of this IWO form and these instructions, “State” is defined as a State or Territory.

Please note: 

COMPLETED BY SENDER:

original IWO.

1a. Original Income Withholding Order/Notice for Support (IWO).  Check the box if this is an

1b. Amended IWO.  Check the box to indicate that this form amends a previous IWO. Any changes

to an IWO must be done through an amended IWO. 

1c. One-Time Order/Notice For Lump Sum Payment.  Check the box when this IWO is to attach
a one-time collection of a lump sum payment. When this box is checked, enter the amount in
field 14, Lump Sum Payment, in the Amounts to Withhold section. Additional IWOs must be
issued to collect subsequent lump sum payments. 

1d.

Termination of IWO.  Check the box to stop income withholding on an IWO. Complete all
applicable  identifying  information  to  aid  the  employer/income  withholder  in  terminating  the
correct IWO. 

1e. Date.  Date this form is completed and/or signed. 

1f.  Child Support Enforcement  Agency (CSEA), Court, Attorney, Private Individual/Entity
(Check One). Check the appropriate box to indicate which entity is sending the IWO. If this
IWO is not completed by a State or Tribal CSEA, the sender should contact the CSEA (see
http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cse/newhire/employer/contacts/contact_map.htm) to
determine if the CSEA needs a copy of this form to facilitate payment processing. 

NOTE TO EMPLOYER/INCOME WITHHOLDER: 

This IWO must be regular on its face. Under the following circumstances, the IWO must be rejected
and returned to sender: 

•

IWO instructs the employer/income withholder to send a payment to an entity other than a
State Disbursement Unit (e.g., payable to the custodial party, court, or attorney). Each State
is required to operate a State Disbursement Unit (SDU), which is a centralized facility for
collection and disbursement of child support payments. Exception: If this IWO is issued by a
Court, Attorney, or Private Individual/Entity and the initial child support order was entered
before  January  1, 1994  or the  order was issued  by  a  Tribal  CSEA, the  employer/income
withholder must follow the payment instructions on the form. 

• Form  does  not  contain  all  information  necessary  for  the  employer  to  comply  with  the

withholding.

the Electronic Funds Transfer/Electronic Data Interchange (EFT/EDI) record.

SDU or Tribe can identify and apply the payment correctly. The remittance identifier is entered as the
case identifier on the EFT/EDI record.

Paym ents to SDU:  You m ust send child support paym ents payable by incom e withholding to the appropriate SDU or to a
Tribal CSEA.  If this IW O instructs you to send a paym ent to an entity other than a SDU (e.g., payable to a custodial party,
court, or attorney), you m ust check the box above and return this notice to the sender.  Exception:  If this IW O was sent by a
Court, Attorney, or Private Individual/Entity and the initial order was entered before January 1, 1994 or the order was issued
by a Tribal CSEA, you m ust follow the “Rem it paym ent to” instructions on this form .  

Reporting the Pay Date:  You m ust report the pay date when sending the paym ent.  The pay date is the date on which the
am ount was withheld from  the em ployee/obligor’s wages.  You m ust com ply with the law of the State (or Tribal law if applicable)
of  the  em ployee/obligor’s  principal  place  of  em ploym ent  regarding  tim e  periods  within  which  you  m ust  im plem ent  the
withholding and forward the support paym ents.

M ultiple IW Os:  If there is m ore than one IW O against this em ployee/obligor and you are unable to fully honor all IW Os due
to Federal, State, or Tribal withholding lim its, you m ust honor all IW Os to the greatest extent possible, giving priority to current
support before paym ent of any past-due support.  Follow the State or Tribal law/procedure of the em ployee/obligor’s principal
place of em ploym ent to determ ine the appropriate allocation m ethod.

Lump  Sum  Payments:    You  m ay  be  required  to  notify  a  State  or  Tribal  CSEA  of  upcom ing  lum p  sum   paym ents  to  this
em ployee/obligor such as bonuses, com m issions, or severance pay.  Contact the sender to determ ine if you are required to
report and/or withhold lum p sum  paym ents.

Liability:    If  you  have  doubts  about  the  validity  of  this  IW O,  contact  the  sender.    If  you  fail  to  withhold  incom e  from   the
em ployee/obligor’s incom e as the IW O directs, you are liable for both the accum ulated am ount you should have withheld  and
any penalties set by State or Tribal law/procedure.  The penalty for an em ployer who fails to com ply with the Order or Notice
is defined in Sections 571-52.2(g), 571-52.3, 576D-14(i), and 576E-16(c) of the Hawai‘i Revised Statutes."  30

Anti-discrimination:  You are subject to a fine determ ined under State or Tribal law for discharging an em ployee/obligor from
em ploym ent, refusing to em ploy, or taking disciplinary action against an em ployee/obligor because of this IW O. The penalty
for an em ployer who violates this section is defined in Sections 571-52(d), 571-52.2(m ), 571-52.3, 576D-14(i), and 576E-16(e)
of the Hawai‘i Revised Statues.  31

W ithholding Limits:  You m ay not withhold m ore than the lesser of:  1) the am ounts allowed by the Federal Consum er Credit
Protection Act (CCPA)  (15 USC § 1673(b)); or 2) the am ounts allowed by the State or Tribe of the em ployee/obligor’s principal
place of em ploym ent (see REMITTANCE INFORMATION).  Disposable incom e is the net incom e left after m aking m andatory
deductions such as:  State, Federal, local taxes; Social Security taxes; statutory pension contributions; and Medicare taxes.
The Federal lim it is 50% of the disposable incom e if the obligor is supporting another fam ily and 60% of the disposable incom e
if the obligor is not supporting another fam ily.  However, those lim its increase 5% - to 55% and 65% - if the arrears are greater
than 12 weeks.  If perm itted by the State or Tribe, you m ay deduct a fee for adm inistrative costs.  The com bined  support
am ount and fee m ay not exceed the lim it indicated in this section. 

For  Tribal  orders,  you  m ay  not  withhold  m ore  than  the  am ounts  allowed  under  the  law  of  the  issuing  Tribe.  For  Tribal
em ployers/incom e withholders who receive a State IW O, you m ay not withhold m ore than the lesser of the lim it set by the law
of the jurisdiction in which the em ployer/incom e withholder is located or the m axim um  am ount perm itted under section  303(d)
of the CCPA (15 USC § 1673(b)).

Depending upon applicable State or Tribal law, you m ay need to also consider the am ounts paid for health care prem ium s in
determ ining disposable incom e and applying appropriate withholding lim its.

Arrears greater than 12 w eeks?   If the Order Information does not indicate that the arrears are greater than 12 weeks, then
the Em ployer should calculate the CCPA lim it using the lower percentage.
