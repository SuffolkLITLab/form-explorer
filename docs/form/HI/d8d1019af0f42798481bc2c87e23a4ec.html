ability to understand this document or this proceeding. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

My lawyer explained the charge(s) against me. I understand the charge(s). I told my 
lawyer everything I know about the case. My lawyer explained the government’s 
 
evidence against me, the facts which the government must prove in order to convict me 
and my possible defenses. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
   
 
I understand that by pleading guilty or no contest I give up my right to a trial by a jury or 
by the court. I understand that for misdemeanor and felony offenses in a jury trial:

I may take part in jury selection; 
 

A jury verdict must be unanimous; and 

 

 

If I waive a jury trial, the judge alone will decide whether I am guilty or not guilty. 

 

 

I further understand that in any trial, 
 
 

 

 

 

the government is required to prove my guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; 

 

 

I have the right to see, hear and question the witnesses who testify against me; 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
I have the right to call my own witnesses to testify for me, but I am not obligated 
to present any evidence in my own defense, nor can any conclusions be drawn 
against me for not presenting any evidence; 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
I have the right not to testify, and should I decide not to testify my decision 
cannot be used against me; 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
I have the right to testify even though my lawyer thinks I should not, and that the 
deputy prosecutor will be able to question me; and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The court would ask me whether my decision to testify or not testify was my

[

NO CONTEST because I do not wish to contest the charge(s) against me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11. 
 

 

 

 

I offer my plea freely and voluntarily and with full understanding of all the matters set 
forth in the information, complaint, or indictment. No one is pressuring or threatening 
 
me or anyone close to me to force me to plead. I am not taking the blame or pleading to 
 
 
 
protect someone else from prosecution. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12. 
 

INITIAL ONE: 
 

 

[

I do not have any agreement with the government regarding my plea. No one has 
 
 
promised me any kind of deal or favor or leniency if I plead. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

[

I have reached the following agreement with the government (give a brief 
 
 
 
 
statement): 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

INITIAL: 
 
I understand that the court is not bound by this agreement. I understand

[ 
 
 
 
that I will not be permitted to withdraw my plea if the court does not 
follow the agreement. 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

[ 
 

] 
 

Other than the foregoing agreement with the government, no one has 
 
promised me any kind of deal or favor or leniency if I plead. 
 

 

 

 

 

I understand that the court is not required to grant any request for a deferred acceptance 
 
 
 
 
of a guilty or no contest plea. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I consent to the court imposing sentence without me being physically present. If a 
presentence report is required by law, I waive (give up) my right to have a presentence 
report prepared and presented to the court. I further understand that non-compliance 
with the court's judgment or order will result in the issuance of a bench warrant, 
 
 
subjecting me to being arrested and having to appear in court.

If you are not a citizen of the United States, whether or not you 
have lawful immigration status, you have the right to receive 
advice from your lawyer about the specific impact that this case 
will have, if any, on your immigration status. The entry of a 
 
guilty or no contest plea, admission of guilt or sufficient facts, or 
conviction, deferred judgment, or deferred sentence might have 
the consequences of your immediate detention, deportation, 
 
exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of 
 
naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States. In some 
 
cases, detention and deportation from the United States will be 
 
required. Your lawyer must investigate and advise you about 
 
these issues prior to the commencement of trial, entry of a guilty 
 
or no contest [plea], or admission of guilt or sufficient facts to 
 
any offense punishable as a crime under state law, other than 
 
those offenses designated as infractions. You are not required to 
 
 
disclose your immigration or citizenship status to the court.
