121(2) to [334-121(7)] 334-121(4) have been met by clear and convincing evidence, the family court
shall order the subject to obtain assisted community treatment for a period of no more than one year.
The written treatment plan submitted pursuant to section 334-126(h) shall be attached to the order
and made a part of the order. 
If the family court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the beneficial mental and physical

effects of recommended medication outweigh the detrimental mental and physical effects, if any,
the order may authorize types or classes of medication to be included in treatment at the discretion
of the treating psychiatrist or advanced practice registered nurse with prescriptive authority and who
holds  an  accredited  national  certification  in  an  advanced  practice  registered  nurse  psychiatric
specialization. 

The court order shall also state who should receive notice of intent to discharge early in the event
that the treating psychiatrist or advanced practice registered nurse with prescriptive authority and
who holds an accredited national certification in an advanced practice registered nurse psychiatric
specialization determines, prior to the end of the court ordered period of treatment, that the subject
should be discharged early from assisted community treatment. 
Notice of the order shall be provided to those persons entitled to notice pursuant to section 334-125. 
(c) The family court shall also designate on the order the treating psychiatrist or advanced practice
registered nurse with prescriptive authority and who holds an accredited national certification in an
advanced  practice  registered  nurse  psychiatric  specialization  who  is  to  be  responsible  for  the
management  and  supervision  of  the  subject's  treatment,  or  shall  assign  an  administrator  of  a
designated mental health program to, in turn, designate the treating psychiatrist or advanced practice
registered nurse with prescriptive authority and who holds an accredited national certification in an
advanced practice registered nurse psychiatric specialization during the treatment period without
court approval, and may designate either a publicly employed psychiatrist or advanced practice
registered nurse with prescriptive authority and who holds an accredited national certification in an
advanced practice registered nurse psychiatric specialization, or a private psychiatrist or advanced
practice  registered  nurse  with  prescriptive  authority  and  who  holds  an  accredited  national
certification in an advanced practice registered nurse psychiatric specialization; provided that the
private psychiatrist or advanced practice registered nurse with prescriptive authority and who holds
an  accredited  national  certification  in  an  advanced  practice  registered  nurse  psychiatric
specialization shall agree to the designation. The order for assisted community treatment shall be
subject to the Health Care Privacy Harmonization Act, chapter 323B. 

(d) Nothing in this section shall preclude the subject's stipulation to the continuance [of] an existing

court order.

§ 334-129.  Failure to comply with assisted community treatment. 
(a) A treating psychiatrist or advanced practice registered nurse with prescriptive authority and who
holds  an  accredited  national  certification  in  an  advanced  practice  registered  nurse  psychiatric
specialization may prescribe or administer to the subject of the order reasonable and appropriate
medication  or  medications,  if  specifically  authorized  by  the  court  order,  and  treatment  that  is
consistent  with  accepted  medical  standards  and  the  family  court  order,  including  the  written
treatment plan submitted pursuant to section 334-126(h). 

(b) No subject of the order shall be physically forced to take medication under a family court order for
assisted community treatment unless the subject is within an emergency department or admitted to
a hospital, subsequent to the date of the current assisted community treatment order. 

(c) A  subject  may  be  transported  to  a  designated  mental  health  program,  or  a  hospital  emergency

practice  registered  nurse  with  prescriptive  authority  and  who  holds  an  accredited  national
certification  in  an  advanced  practice  registered  nurse  psychiatric  specialization  shall  make  all
reasonable efforts to solicit the subject's compliance with the prescribed treatment. If the subject
fails or refuses to comply after the efforts to solicit compliance, the treating psychiatrist or advanced
practice  registered  nurse  with  prescriptive  authority  and  who  holds  an  accredited  national
certification in an advanced practice registered nurse psychiatric specialization shall assess whether
the subject of the order meets criteria for admission to a psychiatric facility under part IV of this
chapter, and proceed with the admission pursuant to section 334-59(a)(2) or (3); provided that the
refusal of treatment shall not, by itself, constitute a basis for involuntary hospitalization. 

(e) Notice of any transport or admission under this section shall be provided pursuant to section 334-

59.5.

under section 334-134.
