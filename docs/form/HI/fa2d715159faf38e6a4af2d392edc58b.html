CHARGE(S): VIOLATION OF H.R.S. SECTION(S) 
 

 

AMENDED CHARGE(S): 
 

REVISED ORDINANCE SECTION(S) 
 

 

In accordance with Rule 43, Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure: 
 

 

 

 

1. 

 

 
I am proceeding without an attorney and I have full knowledge of the following: (Each 
 
box must be initialed by Defendant). 

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

[

I understand that I have a right to representation by an attorney. I also 
 
understand that if I am financially unable to afford an attorney the court will 
 
 
 
appoint one at no cost to me. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The information(s), complaint(s) and/or indictment(s) set(s) out what the 
government claims I did. I have read the information(s), complaint(s) and/or 
 
indictment(s). I know the government must prove the allegations in the 
 
information(s), complaint(s) or indictment(s) in order to convict me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
[ 

 
] 

 
I understand the charge(s) against me. 

 

 

[ 
 

] 
 

 

 

   

I understand that I have the right to be present at the arraignment, at pretrial 
 
 
proceedings, at a trial, at the time I enter my plea and at my sentencing. I 
voluntarily waive (give up) my right to be physically present at all of these 
 
proceedings.

I understand that face-to-face video conferencing might be necessary in order for 
 
 
 
 
the court to [  ] accept or [  ] defer my plea and [   ] impose or [   ] defer 
sentence. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I understand that I have the right to address the court before I am sentenced and 
agree to do so via face-to-face video teleconferencing instead of me appearing in 
 
person before the court. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I understand that by pleading guilty or no contest I give up my right to a trial by a 
 
 
 
jury or by the court. I understand that for misdemeanor and felony offenses in a 
 
 
jury trial: 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

[ 
      

]  Twelve members of the community make up a jury;

I may take part in jury selection; 
 
 

[ 
      

]  A jury verdict must be unanimous; and

[ 

 

If I waive a jury trial, the judge alone will decide whether I am guilty or not 
 
 
guilty.

[ 
      

 
I understand that in any trial, 
 

 

 

 

 
[ 

 
] 

 
 
the government is required to prove my guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
I have the right to see, hear and question witnesses who testify against 
 
me; 

 

 

 
I have the right to call my own witnesses to testify for me, but Iam not 
 
obligated to present any evidence in my own defense, nor can any 
 
conclusions be drawn against me for not presenting any evidence; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
I have the right not to testify, and should I decide not to testify my 
 
decision cannot be used against me; 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
I have the right to testify and that the deputy prosecutor will be able to 
 
question me; and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
The court would ask me whether my decision to testify or not to testify 
 
 
was my own.

I understand that an attorney would: 

 

 

 

investigate my case, call witnesses, and present evidence; 
research the law and present legal issues on my behalf and present 
 
 
 
 
defenses to the charge(s) on my behalf; 
 
know and explain courtroom procedures and argue my case; and 
negotiate with the government to reduce the charge(s) or lessen the 
 
 
sentence.

I understand that, if I give up my right to an attorney, I will not have an 
 
attorney’s assistance and must do everything an attorney would do by myself. 
 

 

 

 

I understand my right to be represented by an attorney. I may either hire my own 
 
attorney or ask the court to appoint one if so required.  I choose to give up my 
right to an attorney and I desire to represent myself.

I consent to the court imposing sentence without me being physically present. If 
a presentence report is required by law, I waive (give up) the right to have a 
presentence report prepared and presented to the court. I further understand that 
 
non-compliance with the court’s judgment or order will result in the issuance of a 
 
 
bench warrant, subjecting me to arrest and an order to appear in court.

If you are not a citizen of the United States, whether or not you have 
lawful immigration status, you have the right to receive advice from a 
lawyer about the specific impact that this case will have, if any, on your 
immigration status. The entry of a guilty or no contest plea, admission of 
guilt or sufficient facts, or conviction, deferred judgment, or deferred 
 
sentence might have the consequences of your immediate detention, 
 
deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of 
naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States. In some cases, 
 
detention and deportation from the United States will be required. Your 
lawyer must investigate and advise you about these issues prior to the 
commencement of trial, entry of a guilty or no contest [plea], or 
admission of guilt or sufficient facts to any offense punishable as a crime 
under state law, other than those offenses designated as infractions. You 
 
are not required to disclose your immigration or citizenship status to the 
 
court.
