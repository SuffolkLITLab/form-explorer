Introduction 
 
On January 1, 2022, new court rules designed to improve civil litigation in Hawaiʻi 
Circuit Courts took effect.  The new rules and amendments to the Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) and the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawaiʻi (RCCH) are 
designed to reduce costs and delay in civil cases and to streamline the litigation process.   

pplicability of New Rules 

The new rules and amendments apply to new civil cases in the Circuit Courts filed on or 

 
after January 1, 2022.  The new rules and amendments do not apply to civil cases filed before 
January 1, 2022, unless all parties agree or a court orders otherwise.   

ummary of Key Changes  

Key changes for certain civil cases filed January 1, 2022 or later involve required initial 

 
disclosures of information by the parties before conducting formal discovery and new procedures 
for scheduling a case for trial and setting case-related deadlines.    

Except for cases that are exempt under the new rules (see below), plaintiffs are required 
to request a scheduling conference with the court within 14 days after any defendant is served 
with the complaint or appears in the case.   

Once the court sets a date for the scheduling conference, the parties must meet at least 

21 days before the scheduling conference to discuss various items, including the nature and basis 
of their claims and defenses, and the possibility of resolving the case.  The parties must also 
arrange for and discuss the timing of initial disclosures and develop a proposed discovery plan.  
All parties are required to confer in good faith and are jointly responsible for arranging the 
conference and submitting a written report to the court after their meeting within 14 days of the 
parties’ discovery planning conference.   

Initial disclosures must be made by the parties within 14 days of their meeting, unless 

the parties stipulate or the court orders otherwise.   

At least 7 days before the scheduling conference, each party appearing in the case must 

file a scheduling conference statement.  

Absent good reason for delay, the court must issue a scheduling order setting the trial 

date and case-related deadlines within 90 days after any defendant has been served with the 
complaint or 60 days after any defendant has appeared, whichever is earlier.  

If the parties agree, certain cases may be set on an expedited track for trial.   Cases 

assigned to an expedited trial track will be set for trial within 9 months of the scheduling 
conference.  All other applicable cases will be assigned to a non-expedited trial track with trial 
scheduled to begin within 12 months of the scheduling conference (or up to18 months if 
requested by a party and based on specific criteria considered by the judge).

If the nature of your case falls into any of the categories below, your case is exempt from 

xempt Civil Cases 

 
the new disclosure and scheduling requirements:   
 

Foreclosure 
Cases in the Court Annexed Arbitration Program (CAAP) 
Agency Appeals 
Consumer Debt Collection 
Quiet Title 
Asbestos 

Unless a judge orders otherwise, plaintiffs in these exempt civil cases must request a trial 

setting status conference within 8 months after their complaint has been filed.  The court will 
set the date and time for the conference and will schedule the trial and other appropriate 
deadlines for resolving the case at the trial setting status conference.    

The trial setting status conference and other requirements for exempt civil cases can be 

found at RCCH 12(b).   

Although exempt cases are not subject to the new disclosure and scheduling 

requirements, there are other rule amendments that apply to these exempt civil cases.  Therefore, 
be sure to read and familiarize yourself with all of the new rules and amendments.   

To assist the parties in navigating the new rule requirements for non-exempt cases, forms 

 
are appended to the HRCP and RCCH.1  The forms are available on the Judiciary’s website.   

The forms can be filled out and printed through Adobe Acrobat.  Alternatively, you may 

prepare your own document in substantially the same format as the official forms.   

The new forms with instructions are appended to this guide.

1 You may notice that 4 new forms are appended to the HRCP (Forms 33 through 36) and 

5 new forms are appended to the RCCH (Forms E-1 through E-5).  The Scheduling Conference 
Statement form (Form E-5 of the RCCH) is not appended to the HRCP because the requirement 
for parties to file a Scheduling Conference Statement is contained in the RCCH only.  All the 
other forms contain requirements set forth in both the HRCP and the RCCH, and therefore, are 
appended to both sets of rules.

The new rules require a plaintiff to file a notice requesting a scheduling conference with 

Setting a Scheduling Conference with the Court 
 
the court within 14 days of service of the complaint upon any defendant or any defendant 
appearing in the case.   

To request the scheduling conference, the plaintiff must file a Notice of Request for 
Scheduling Conference and a [Proposed] Order Setting Scheduling Conference (See Appendix 1 
and Appendix 2). 

Once the proper documents are filed, the court will set the date and time for the 

conference and file the Order Setting Scheduling Conference.   

The plaintiff is responsible for serving the Order Setting Scheduling Conference on all 
parties as required by HRCP 16(b)(4) and RCCH 12(a)(4).  The plaintiff should use the form 
Certificate of Service (Re: Order Setting Scheduling Conference) (see Appendix 3) to indicate 
the manner of service upon all parties.  

If your case has more than one defendant and the plaintiff has not served all defendants 
with the complaint before the scheduling conference, the plaintiff may request to postpone the 
scheduling conference to allow more time for service upon the remaining defendants.  The 
plaintiff must explain to the court the diligent efforts made to effect service upon the other 
defendants.  If a proper showing is not made, the request to postpone the conference may be 
denied.   

These and other requirements for requesting the scheduling the conference can be found 

at HRCP 16(b) and RCCH 12(a).   

eeting of the Parties, Discovery Planning, and Joint Report 

Once the court sets the date for the Scheduling Conference, the parties must meet and 

 
confer as soon as practicable, but at the very least, they must meet 21 days before the Scheduling 
Conference.  

Attorneys and self-represented parties are jointly responsible for arranging the meeting, 
attempting in good faith to agree on a proposed discovery plan during the meeting, and filing a 
joint report with the court after the meeting.  

HRCP 26(f)(2) and RCCH 12(a)(6)(B) detail the matters that must be discussed at the 

parties’ meeting, including:  
 

  The nature and basis of their claims and defenses;  
  The possibilities for promptly settling or resolving the case; 
  Making or arranging for initial disclosures required by HRCP 26(a)(1);  
  Whether the case should be assigned to an expedited or non-expedited track under 

HRCP 16.1; 

  Any issues about preserving discoverable information; and

  Develop a proposed discovery plan 
 
Initial Disclosures.  HRCP 26(a)(1) requires the parties to disclose certain information 
 
automatically, without the need for discovery requests, within 14 days after the parties’ meeting.  
HRCP 26(a)(1) sets forth the type of information that must be provided by the parties.  
Generally, the information includes:  
 

(i) 

Potential witnesses – name, address and telephone number (if 
known) of all witnesses (other than experts) reasonably expected to 
be called at trial and a general statement of the nature of the 
testimony; 

ii)  Documents – a copy of (or a description by category and location 
of) all documents, electronically stored information, and tangible 
things that may be used by the disclosing party to support the 
disclosing party’s claims or defenses; 

iii)  Damages Computations – parties must provide a computation of 

damages of any category of damages claimed by the disclosing 
party.  The parties must also make available for inspection and 
copying documents or other evidentiary material on which the 
computation is based, including materials bearing on the nature and 
extent of injuries suffered.  Documents or material that are 
privileged or protected from disclosure do not need to be disclosed.   

Insurance – the parties must provide all declarations page(s) of any 
insurance agreement that may provide coverage for all or part of 
any judgment in the case and all reservation of rights letter(s) 
received by the disclosing party or parties.

Expedited or Non-Expedited Track Assignment.  HRCP 16.1 allows the parties to 

 
agree to assign certain types of cases to an expedited trial track to secure the just, speedy, and 
efficient resolution of the case.  Depending on certain factors discussed with the parties during 
the scheduling conference, the court may assign the case to an expedited track.  Factors the court 
will take into consideration are:  
 

  Degree of readiness of the case for resolution; 
  Number of parties and whether any of the parties are self-represented; 
  Monetary value of the case; 
  Number and complexity of issues to be resolved; 
  Number, extent, and nature of the claims;  
  Volume and extent of discovery necessary;  
  Number of witnesses, experts, and documents.   
 

 

4 

You should discuss these factors during the meeting of the parties and determine whether 

your case is suitable for assignment to an expedited trial track.   

Parties should be aware that there are limitations on discovery in expedited track cases 

and should refer to HRCP 16.1(c) for further details.   

Discovery Planning.  HRCP 26(f)(3) and RCCH 12(a)(6)(C) list the discovery 
planning items that must be discussed during the meeting of the parties.  These items are: 



Initial and Expert Disclosures -- changes, if any, to the timing,
form, or requirements for initial and expert disclosures under
HRCP 26(a) and when such disclosures were or will be made;

 Discovery Items and Schedule -- subjects on which discovery may
be needed, when discovery should be completed, and whether
discovery should be conducted in phases or limited to or focused
on particular issues;

 Electronically Stored Information – issues about disclosure,

discovery, or preservation of electronically stored information,
including the form or forms in which it should be produced;

 Privilege Matters – issues about claims of privilege or of protection
as trial preparation materials, including – if the parties agree on a
procedure to assert these claims after production – whether to ask
the court to include their agreement in an order under HRE 502;

 Limitations on Discovery – changes, if any, to be made in the

limitations on discovery imposed under the HRCP or RCCH, and
what other limitations should be imposed.

 Other Orders – Any other protective order issues under HRCP
26(c) or case management issues under HRCP 16(b) and (c).

Joint Report of the Parties.  HRCP 26(f)(2) and RCCH 12(a)(6)(B) require the 

 
parties to jointly file a written report to the judge outlining the parties’ discovery plan.   

The Joint Report of the Parties must be filed within 14 days after the meeting of the 

 
parties.  Please refer to Appendix 4 for a form Joint Report of the Parties.   

If the parties disagree on any portion of the discovery plan, the Joint Report should 

specify the nature of the disagreement.

Scheduling Orders 

The new rules require the trial judge to issue a Scheduling Order within 90 days after any 

defendant has been served with the complaint or 60 days after any defendant has appeared, 
whichever is earlier.   

The scheduling order must include a trial date for your case.  Your trial must commence 

within a specified time period.  Trials in cases assigned to an expedited track must begin within 9 
months of the scheduling conference.  Trials in cases assigned to a non-expedited track must 
begin within 12 months from the conference.  In some cases, a trial date may be set no more than 
18 months from the scheduling conference, but only if requested by a party and depending on 
certain factors.   

In addition to setting the trial date, the scheduling order will contain other deadlines, such 

as motions deadlines, expert disclosure and report deadlines, and the discovery cut-off.  The 
scheduling order will also contain the final pretrial conference date and deadline for pretrial 
statements, a settlement conference date and deadlines for parties to exchange settlement offers.  
Alternative resolution processes, if appropriate, will also be included in the scheduling order.   

The scheduling order will also set forth deadlines for the submission and exchange of 

trial witness and exhibit lists, exchange of trial exhibits, deposition designations, trial briefs, jury 
instructions special verdict forms (if applicable), and proposed findings of fact and conclusions 
of law (if applicable).   

Scheduling orders may be modified only for good cause and only with the judge’s 

consent.   

For more information on scheduling conferences and scheduling orders, please refer to 

HRCP 16(b) and RCCH 12(a).   

Other Noteworthy Rule Changes for Civil Cases Filed on or after January 1, 
2022 

Experts.  Parties must disclose the identity of testifying expert witnesses and produce 

detailed expert reports, unless the case falls into an exempt category, all parties agree or a judge 
orders otherwise.   

In the absence of a court order or agreement by the parties, expert disclosures in non-

exempt civil cases must be made based on the following schedule:   





the party having the burden of proof on a claim or an affirmative
defense must disclose the required information no later than 120
days before trial;

a party opposing a claim for relief or affirmative defense must
disclose the required information no later than 90 days before trial;

7 

 

 
if the expert testimony is solely to rebut evidence disclosed for the 
first time by a party opposing a claim for relief or affirmative 
defense, the required disclosures must be made 60 days before 
trial.   
 

HRCP 26(a)(2) sets forth the timeframes, form, and content of the new expert witness disclosure 
requirements.   

Streamlined Discovery Assistance.  In all civil cases filed January 1, 2022 or later, 
parties may seek resolution of discovery disputes through a streamlined procedure set forth in 
RCCH 15.1.  Parties must agree on using this procedure and must agree on the deadline for 
submission of letters to the judge.  The letters must be 5 pages or less (including all exhibits) and 
must contain the following information: 
 

the parties’ agreed deadline for the submission of letters to the court; 
the discovery cut off deadline and the trial date; 

 
 
  a discussion of the discovery dispute and relief sought; and 
  a certification that that the parties conferred in good faith and attempted to resolve 

or minimize the dispute. 
 

 
Parties should not attempt to submit complex, multi-faceted, or lengthy discovery 
disputes through this process.  Rather, the process should be used for discovery disputes that are 
limited in scope to only a few issues.   

Parties must submit their letters to the judge’s chambers.  Filing of the letters is not 
required under the rule.  You should contact the judge’s chambers to find out if the judge prefers 
submission of the letters by email or delivery to chambers.   

Once the court receives the letters, the judge may make a decision without holding a 
conference or hearing.  If a conference or hearing is set, the judge may hold the hearing in person 
or remotely by video or phone.  Finally, the judge may decide that the dispute cannot be resolved 
through this process and require a party to file a discovery motion pursuant to court rules.   

The prevailing party of this streamlined procedure must prepare the order for the judge’s 
signature and must append the letter briefs to the proposed order.  The order must be prepared as 
as required by RCCH 23.   

Parties must confer with each other in good faith about the dispute.  The conference may 

be held in person, by telephone, or by video.  Back and forth email communication does not 
meet the conferral requirement.  Parties must attempt to resolve or minimize the scope of the 
dispute in a good faith effort to eliminate the need for discovery assistance and must address 
whether the burden or expense of the discovery outweighs its likely benefit under HRCP 
26(b)(2)(iii).   
 

8 

   

   

   

   

   

 

Letter briefs must be signed and include a certification that the parties complied with the 
 
conferral requirement.  The certification must include the date, time, and length of the meeting or 
conference, and the names of all participants.   

The court will not entertain any request for discovery assistance where the parties do not 

confer as required by the rule or do not include a proper certification in their letters.   

Mandatory Settlement Conferences.  Settlement conferences in non-exempt cases 

are mandatory under the new rules and must be set by the judge at the court’s scheduling 
conference.  Parties will be required to exchange written bona fide and reasonable settlement 
offers prior to the settlement conference.  Unless otherwise ordered by the judge, plaintiff’s offer 
must be made before defendant’s offer.  

Parties must submit confidential settlement conference letters to the judge at least 5 

working days before the conference.  A settlement conference statement is no longer required.  
Do not electronically file your confidential settlement letters in JEFS.  Confidential settlement 
letters must be delivered directly to the judge.   

Parties should familiarize themselves with the new requirements for settlement 

conferences set forth in RCCH 12.2.   

Pretrial Statements.  For all civil cases filed on or after January 1, 2022, pretrial 

statements are no longer required to be filed within 8 months after a complaint has been filed.  
Instead, pretrial statements are now required to be filed and served no later than 7 days before the 
final pretrial conference scheduled by the court.  If no final pretrial conference is scheduled, then 
parties must file and serve their pretrial statements no later than 14 days before trial.   

The new rule for pretrial statements, RCCH 12.1, requires the parties to include specific 

and detailed information in their pretrial statements.
