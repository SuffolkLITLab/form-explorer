Certificate of Service Re: Order Setting Scheduling Conference (with Instructions) . Appendix 4: . Joint Report of the Parties (with Instructions) . Appendix 5: Scheduling Conference Statement (with Instructions) . 1 Introduction. On January 1, 2022, . new . court rules designed to improve civil litigation in Hawai. i . Circuit Courts t. ook effect. . The new rules and amendments to the . Hawai. i Rules of Civil . Procedure . (HRCP) . and the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawai. i . (RCCH) . are . designed to reduce costs and delay in civil cases and to streamline the litigat. ion process. . Applicability of New Rules. The. new . rules and amendments apply to . new . civil cases . in the Circuit Courts filed . on or . after January 1, 2022. The . new rules and amendments. do not . apply to civil cases filed . before. January 1. , 2022, unless all . parties agree or a court orders. otherwise. . Summary of Key Changes . Key. changes for certain civil cases filed January 1, 2022 or later involve . required initial . disclosures . of information. by the parties before conducting formal discovery and new . procedur. es . for . scheduling a . case for trial. and setting case. -related deadlines. . . . Except for cases that are exempt under the new rules (see below) , . plaintiffs are required . to . request a. scheduling conference. with the court within 14 days after any defendant is served . . with the complaint or appears in the case. . . . Once the court sets a date for the scheduling conference, . the parties must meet. at least . 21 days before the scheduling conference to discuss various items, including the nature and basis . . of their claims and defenses. , and the possibility of resolving the case. The parties must also . arrange for and discuss the timing of . initial . disclosures. and develop a proposed . discovery plan. . All parties are required. to confer in good faith and are . jointly responsible. for arranging the . conference and submitting . a written report. to the court . after their meeting. within 14 days of the . parties™ . discovery planning . conference. . . . . Initial disclosures. must be made. by the par. ties. within 14 days of the. ir meeting. , unless . the parties stipulate or the court orders otherwise. . . At least 7 days before the scheduling conference, each party appearing in the case must . file a . scheduling conference statement. . . . Absent good . reason. for . delay, the court must issue a . scheduling order. setting the trial . date and case. -related deadlines within 90 days after any defendant has been served with the . . complaint or 60 days after any defendant has appeared, whichever is earlier. . . . If the parties agree, certain cases may be set on an . expedited track for trial. . Cases . assigned to an expedited trial track will be set for trial within 9 months of the scheduling . . conference. All other applicable cases will be assigned to a . non-. expedited . trial track. with trial . scheduled to begin within 12 months of the scheduling conference (or up to 18 months if . . requested by a party an. d based on specific criteria considered by the judge. ) . . 2 Exempt Civil Cases. If the nature of your case falls in. to . any. of . the categories below, your case is . exempt. from . the new . disclosure and scheduling requirements. : Foreclosure . Cases in the Court Annexed Arbitration Program . (CAAP) . Agency Appeals. Consumer Debt Collection . . Quiet Title. Asbestos . . Unless a judge orders otherwi. se, plaintiffs . in these exempt civil cases . must request . a trial . setting status conference. within 8 months after their complaint has been filed. The court will . . set the date and time for the conference and will schedule the trial and other appropriate . . deadlines for resolving the case. at the trial setting status conference. . . . The trial setting status conference and other requirements for exempt civil cases can be . found at RCCH 12 (b) . . . . Although exempt cases are not subject to the new disclosure and scheduling . requirements, . there are other rule amendments that apply to these exempt civil cases. Therefore, . . be sure to read and familiarize yourself with. all of. the new rules and amend. ments. . New Forms. To assist the pa. rties in navigating the new rule requirements. for non-. exempt cases. , forms . are . appended to the HRCP and RCCH. . 1 The forms are available on the Judiciary™s website. . . The forms can be filled out and printed through Adobe Acrobat. Alternatively, you may . prepare your own document in substantially the same format as the official forms. . . . The new forms with instructions are appended to this guide. . 1 You. may notice that 4 new forms are appended to the HRCP (Forms 33 through 36) and . 5 new forms are appended to the RCCH (Forms E 1 through E 5) . The Scheduling Conference . . Statement form (Form E. -5 of the RCCH) is not appended to the HRCP because the requirement . for parties to file a Scheduling Conference Statement is contained in the RCCH only. All the . . other forms contain requirements set forth in both the HRCP and the RCCH, and therefore, are . . appended to both sets of rules. . 3 Setting a Scheduling Conference with the Court. The new rules require a plaintiff to file a notice requesting a scheduling conference with . the court within 14 days of service of the complaint upon any defendant or any defendant . appearing in the case. . . To request the scheduling c. onference, the . plaintiff . must . file . a Notice of Request for . Scheduling Conference . and. a [Proposed] Order Setting Scheduling Conference (See Appendix 1 . . and Appendix . 2) . . . Once the proper documents are filed, the . court will . set . the . date . and time for the . conference . and . file t. he Order Setting Scheduling Conference. . . . The plaintiff is responsible for serving the Order Setting Scheduling Conference . on all . . parties as required by HRCP 16 (b) (4) and RCCH 12 (a) (4) . The p. laintiff . should . use . the form . . Certificate of Service (Re: Order. Setting Scheduling Conference) (. see . Appendix 3) to indicate . the manner of service upon all parties. . . . If . your case has more than one d. efendant and the . plaintiff has not served all . defendants . with the complaint before the scheduling c. onference, the . plaint. iff may request to postpone the . scheduling conference to allow more time for service upon the remaining d. efendants. The . plaintiff must explain . to the court the . diligent efforts . made. to effect service upon the other . . defendants. If a proper showing is not made, the request to postpone the conference may be . . denied. . . . These and other requirements for requesting the scheduling the conference can be found . . at . HRCP 16 (b) and RCCH 12 (a) . . . Meeting. of the Parties, Discovery Planning, . and Joint Report. Once the court sets the date for the Scheduling Conference, . the parties must meet. and . confer. as soon as practicable, but at the very l. east, . they . must meet 21 days before the Scheduling . Conference. . . . Attorneys and self-. represented parties. are . jointly responsible. for arranging the meeting, . attempting in good faith to agree on a proposed discovery plan . during the meeting. , and filing a . joint report with the court . after the meeting. . . . HRCP 26 (f) (2) . and . RCCH 12 (a) (6) (B) detail the matters that must be discussed at the . parties™ meeting, including: . The nature and basis of their claims and defenses; . The possibilities for promptly settling or resolving the case; . Making or arranging for . initial d. isclosures. required by HRCP 26 (a) (1) ; . Whether the case should be assigned to an expedited or non-. expedited track. under . HRCP 16. 1; . Any issues about preserving discoverable information; and . 4 Develop a proposed discovery plan .

Insurance Œ . the parties must provide all . declarations page (s) of any . insurance agreement that may provide coverage for all or part of . . any judgment in the case and all reservation of rights letter (s) . . received by the disclosing party or parties. . . Expedited or Non Expedited Track Assignment. . HRCP 16. 1 . allows . the parties . to agree to assign certain types of cases . to an expedited trial track to secure the just, speedy, and . . efficient resolution of the case. Depending on certain factors discussed with the parties during . . the scheduling conference. , the court may assign the case t. o an expedited track. Factors the court . will take into consideration are: . Degree of readiness of the case for resolution; . Number of parties and whether any of the parties are self. -represented; . Monetary value of the case; . Number and complexity of issues to be resolved; . Number, extent, and nature of the claims; . Volume and extent of discovery necessary; . Number of witnesses, experts, and documents. . 5 You should discuss these factors during the meeting of the parties and determine . whether . your. case is suitable for assignment to an expedited trial track. . Parties should be aware that there are . limitations on discovery. in expedited track cases. and should refer to HRCP 16. 1 (c) for further details. . Discovery Planning. .

HRCP 26 (a) (2) sets forth the timeframes, form, and content of the new expert witness disclosure . . requirements. . . Streamlined . Discovery Assistance. . In all civil cases filed January 1, 2022 or later, . parties . may . seek resolution of discovery disputes through a streamlined procedure set forth in . RCCH 15. 1. P. arties . must. agree on . using this procedure and must agree on . the deadline for . submission of letter. s to the judge. The letters must be 5 pages or less (including all exhibits) and . must contain the following information: . . the parties™ agreed deadline for the submission of letters to the court; . the discovery cut off deadline and the trial date; . a discuss. ion of the discovery dispute and relief sought; . and. a certifica. tion that that the parties conferred in good faith and attempted to resolve . . or minimize the dispute. . Parties should not attempt to submit complex, multi. -faceted, or lengthy discovery . disputes through this process. Rather, the process should be used for discovery dispu. tes that are . . limited . in scope to only a few issues. . . . Parties must submit their letters to the judge™s chambers. Filing of the letters is not . required under the rule. You should contact the judge™s chambers to find out if the judge prefers . . submission of the letters by email or . delivery. to chambers. . . Once the court receives the letters, the judge may make a decision without holding a . . conference or hearing. If a conference or hearing is set, the judge may hold the hearing in person . . or remotely by video or phone. Finally, the judge may decide that the dispute cannot be resolved . . through this process and require a party to file a discovery motion pursuant to cou. rt rules. . . The prevailing party of this streamlined procedure . must . prepare the order for the . judge. ™s . signature and must append the letter briefs to the proposed order. The order must be prepared as . . as required by RCCH 23. . . . P. arties . must . confer . with each other in good faith about the dispute. The conference may . be held in person, by telephone, or by video. . Back and forth e. mail communication . does. not . meet the conferral requirement. . Parties must attempt to resolve or min. imize the scope of the . dispute in a good faith effort to eliminate the need for discovery assistance and must address . . whether the burden or expense of the discovery outweighs its likely benefit under HRCP . . 26 (b) (2) (iii) . . . 9 Letter briefs must be signed and include a certification that the parties complied with the . conferral requirement. The certification must include the date, time, and length of the meeting or . conference, and the names of all participants. . . . The court will not entertain any request for discovery assistance wher. e the parties d. o not . confer as required by the rule or do not include a proper certification in . their letters. . Mandatory Settlement C. onferences. . Settlement conferences in non-. exempt cases . are mandatory under the new rules and must . be set by the judge at . the court™s scheduling . conference. Parties will be required to exchange written bona fide and reasonable settlement . offers prior to the settlement conference. Unless otherwise ordered by the judge, plaintiff™s offer . . must be made before defendant™s off. er. . . Parties must submit confidential settlement conference letters to . the . judge at least 5 . working days before the conference. . A settlement conference statement is no longer required. . .

If no final pretrial conference is scheduled, then . . parties must file and serve their pretrial statements no later than 14 days before trial. . .
