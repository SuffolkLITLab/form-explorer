OTE: Page 3 of this form discusses both kinds of custody (legal and physical).   
●  Legal  custody  means  who  makes  important  decisions  for  the  child.    Legal 
custody  can  be  joint  (usually  this  means  both  parents  must  decide  together)  or 
sole (one person gets to make the decisions). 
● Physical custody means who the child lives with.  Physical custody can be joint 
(usually this means the child spends equal time with both parents) or sole (usually 
this means the child lives with one parent, and the other gets to visit). 

.    Exhibit  Sheets.    For  each  child,  you  need  a  separate  Exhibit  sheet  with  a  certified 
copy  of  the  child’s  birth  certificate  attached  to  it.    Label  each  Exhibit  sheet  in 
chronological order (1, 2, 3, etc.).  On the first page of the Petition, under “Attachments,” 
write  in  the  blank  how  many  Exhibit  sheets  are  included,  depending  on  how  many 
children are covered by this Petition (e.g. 1, or 1-2, or 1-3, etc.). 

.  Summons.  This document tells the Respondent(s) when to come to the hearing. 

.  Paternity Financial Information Sheet.  This tells the Court about your household’s 

monthly income, expenses and assets.

  E

.    Child  Support  Guidelines  Worksheet.    See  the  Instruction  for  the  Child  Support 
Guidelines  Worksheet  for  instructions  on  how  to  complete  the  necessary  child  support 
calculations. 
 

2.  Make copies.  The Court will keep your original documents, so make enough copies for each 
party.  You will need at least 3 copies: one for yourself, one for the other parent, and one for the 
Child  Support  Enforcement  Agency  (CSEA).    If  a  third  party  has  been  taking  care  of  the 
child(ren) at issue for 60 or more days before you file the Petition, then make a copy for him/her 
also.  Make at least one extra copy just in case. 

.  Put your originals and copies into packets.  Put the documents together in the following order: 
Petition  on  top,  then  Exhibit(s),  Summons,  Income  and  Expense  Statement,  Asset  and  Debt 
Statement, Child Support Guidelines Worksheet(s), and Motion for Service by Mail and Affidavit; 
Order  for  Service  by  Mail  (if  you  are  requesting  permission  to  serve  by  mail).    Keep  your 
originals documents together.  Staple each packet together.   

.  File your documents and pay the filing fee if you are not requesting a filing fee waiver. Take 
your original + copies to the filing clerks, Legal Documents, 2145 Main Street, Wailuku, Suite 
106.  The clerk will file (date-stamp) your documents, keep the originals for the court, and return 
the copies to you.  Ask the clerk to certify all copies of the Petition. 

TEP FOUR: Serve the Respondent(s) with the documents and submit proof to the Court. 

You must properly give (“serve”) the other parent a certified copy of the documents.  If there is a 
third-party caretaker named as a Respondent, s/he must also be served. 
How to serve the Respondent(s): 
 

If Respondent is in the State: Someone (other than you) 18 years or older must hand-
deliver  the  Petition  +  attachments  to  the  Respondent(s).    Either  hire  a  private  process 
server or get a friend or relative to serve him/her.

he  server  must  fill  out  and  sign  the  Proof  of  Service,  which  tells  the  court  the 
Respondent was served.  If you hire a process server, give the process server a blank copy 
of  the  Proof  of  Service  document  to  complete.    If  you  don’t  hire  a  process  server,  the 
person  serving  must  complete  a  Proof  of  Service  document.    File  the  original  with  the 
filing clerks. 

  T

If Respondent is on the mainland, or in another country: Ask the court for permission 
to serve by mail (Motion for Service by Mail and Affidavit; Order for Service by Mail).  
Once you get permission, send the Petition + attachments, along with a file-stamped copy 
of  the  Motion  for  Service  by  Mail  and  Affidavit;  Order  for  Service  by  Mail  to  the 
Respondent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, restricted delivery to 
the addressee only.  Keep the receipt from the Post Office and wait for the return receipt 
card to come back, signed by the Respondent, indicating that the Respondent received the 
documents.  Complete the Statement of Mailing and tape both Post Office receipts to the 
second page, then it with the filing clerks. 

TEP FIVE: Serve CSEA 

Once  you  get  a  hearing  date,  you  must  inform  CSEA’s  attorneys  of  that  date.    Complete  the 
Memorandum to Family Support Division and deliver it along with a copy of the Petition + all 
attachments either in person, by mail, or by fax to:

TEP SIX: Prepare for and attend the hearing. 

Think  about  what  you  requested  in  your  Petition  and  why  you  should  get  it.    If  you  have  any 
written documentation that helps you prove your arguments (e.g. police reports, medical records, 
etc.), bring at least 3 copies with you to court.  Take the rest of your blank VEP Forms with you 
to the hearing. 

TEP SEVEN:  Prepare necessary orders.
