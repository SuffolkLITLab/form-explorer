(For the Island of O‘ahu)
 

WHO CAN FILE FOR DIVORCE?
 

 

 

 

In order to file a civil union divorce action in the Family Court of the First Circuit (on 
O‘ahu),  you  must  meet  certain  limited  residency  requirements.  You  must  have  been 
domiciled or physically present on O‘ahu continuously for at least 3 months prior to the 
filing of the Complaint for Civil Union Divorce and either you or your partner must have 
been domiciled or physically present in the State of Hawai‘i continuously for at  least 6 
months prior to the filing of the Complaint for Civil Union Divorce.  The islands are divided 
into separate circuits. You must meet these limited residency requirements and file your 
Complaint for Civil Union Divorce in the correct circuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  same  sex  marriage  cases,  you  may file  your  divorce  action  on  O‘ahu  if  your 
 

 

 

resident state does not recognize same sex marriage. 

=  O‘ahu 
•  First Circuit 
•  Second Circuit  =  Mau‘i, Lâna‘i, and Moloka‘i 
•  Third Circuit 
•  Fifth Circuit 

=  Hawai‘i (Hilo and Kona Divisions) 
=  Kaua‘i 

Contact the Family Court in your circuit to obtain documents to file your civil union 

 

divorce or visit the Judiciary’s website at www.courts.state.hi.us. 

BEFORE YOU START 

Read  through  this  entire  instruction  packet  before  you  start  to  fill  in  the 
documents.  This packet includes instructions, information, and forms needed to obtain 
an uncontested civil union divorce.  The instructions tell you which documents need to be 
completed, when the documents need to be file-stamped by the Court, and what you need 
to do to place your civil union divorce case on the Court Calendar.  The Uncontested Civil 
Union  Divorce  (with  Minor  and/or  Dependent  Children)  Document  Checklist  contains 
information on how many copies of each document you need to submit and who signs the 
document.  The Checklist also helps you see what documents you have completed and 
which documents you still have to do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  Civil  Union  Divorce  Decree  (with  Minor  and/or  Dependent  Children)  in  this 
packet contains provisions that cover most civil union divorce situations.  There may be 
other terms or provisions necessary for your case. You are strongly urged to talk to an 
attorney to discuss your legal rights and duties. 

  

 

 

 

 

Most  uncontested  divorces  are  done  by  affidavit,  with  a  Judge  reviewing  the 
documents you submit.  This means that neither you nor your partner appear at a Court 
hearing if your documents are properly completed and all the necessary steps have been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended, and other applicable state and federal 
laws, if you require accommodation for a disability, please contact the ADA Coordinator at the First Circuit 
Family  Court office  by  telephone at 954-8200, fax  954-8308, or via  email  at adarequest@courts.hawaii.gov 
 
at least ten (10) working days prior to your hearing or appointment date. 

 

 

 

Please call the Family Court Service Center at 954-8290 if you have any questions about forms or procedures.

children) Instructions 

 

followed.  Therefore it is very important that you understand which documents are needed 
and  what  you  must  do  before  the  Court  will  grant  your  divorce.  If  the  Court  has  any 
questions or concerns, you and your partner may be required to appear at a hearing or 
submit more documents. 

 

 

 

 

It is important for you to realize that a divorce takes time.  Most of you will not be 
able to complete all your divorce documents in one day.  Be sure to read each document 
thoroughly and make sure you understand what the document says.  Do not sign any 
 
document you do not agree with or you do not understand. 

 

 

 

 

 

IF YOU NEED ASSISTANCE 

 

The clerks of the Court are not allowed to give legal advice or assist you in the 
completion  of  the  divorce  documents. 
In  accordance  with  the  Americans  with 
   
Disabilities Act, as amended, and other applicable state and federal laws, if you require 
accommodation for a disability, please contact the ADA Coordinator at the First Circuit 
Family  Court  Office  by  telephone  at  954-8200,  fax  954-8308  or  via  email  at 
adarequest@courts.hawaii.gov  at  least  ten  (10)  working   days  prior  to  your  scheduled 
hearing or appointment date. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Legal Assistance 

 

If possible, you should seek the assistance of an attorney. Even if you cannot afford 
to have an attorney to represent you for the whole divorce, you should try at least to talk 
to an attorney to discuss your legal rights and duties.  You can check the Yellow Pages of 
the telephone book for names of attorneys or you may call the following organization for 
possible assistance:

If you do not have an attorney, it is suggested that your documents be reviewed at

AFTER THE JUDGE REVIEWS YOUR DOCUMENTS 

 

 

 

Once your case is set on the uncontested Civil Union Divorce by Affidavit calendar, 
your documents will be reviewed by the Judge.  If the Judge grants your civil union divorce 
   
and signs your Civil Union Divorce Decree, you should receive certified copies of the Civil 
Union  Divorce  Decree  and  Order/Notice  to  Withhold 
Income  for  Child  Support,  if 
applicable,  in  the  mail  within  four  (4)  to  six  (6)  weeks  after  the  judge  reviews  your 
documents. If you do not receive the documents, it is your responsibility to check the status 
of your case on the Judiciary’s website at www.courts.state.hi.us.  The status of your case 
cannot be given out over the telephone.  If the disposition calendar says that your divorce 
was “GRANTED,” the certified copies of the Civil Union Divorce Decree and Order/Notice 
to Withhold Income for Child Support will be mailed to you in the envelopes provided. If 
your divorce is “DENIED”, a copy of the court’s disposition calendar will be mailed to you 
in  the  envelope  you  provided.  You  must  follow  the  Judge’s  instructions  noted  on  the 
disposition calendar before your divorce can be finalized.

STEPS TO OBTAIN AN UNCONTESTED CIVIL UNION DIVORCE 
(With Minor and/or Dependent Children) 

STEP 1:	  OPENING YOUR DIVORCE CASE  (If you are the one who is filing for divorce, 

  

 

 

you are the “PLAINTIFF” and your partner is the “DEFENDANT.”)

completed.  You can request to be excused from attending this program by filling 
out the request form available at the Family Court Service Center or the Kids First

If your partner does not live on O‘ahu, you must also submit the following document 
to obtain the Court’s approval before serving your spouse by certified or registered mail.

After completion, take the originals and copies of the above documents along with 
required  court  filing  fees  to  the  Legal  Documents  Section  (Ronald  T.Y.  Moon  Kapolei 
Courthouse, 4675 Kapolei Parkway, First Floor, Kapolei, Hawai‘i or Ka‘ahumanu Hale, 777

Court  will  assign  you  a  case  number  which  you  need  to  write  on  the  rest  of  your 
documents. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

STEP 2:	  NOTICE TO ATTEND KIDS FIRST: Attendance at this program  is mandatory. 
If  you were not excused by  a Judge from  attending  this program, your divorce 
may be denied until you attend the program. 

After you file the Complaint for Civil Union Divorce; Summons to Answer Civil Union 
Complaint, you will be assigned a date to attend the Kids First Program.  This is the date 
when you, your partner, and any of your children (between the ages of six and seventeen

this program as scheduled or if you have a temporary restraining order in effect against 
 
your partner, you must call the number on the back of the notice and obtain another date.

STEP 3:	  GETTING  THE  DOCUMENTS  TO  YOUR  SPOUSE:  “SERVICE”  OF THE 
COMPLAINT  AND  SUMMONS  AND  FILE-STAMPING  THE  SERVICE 
 
 
DOCUMENT 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“Service” means getting a file-stamped copy of the Complaint, Summons and Notice 
to Attend Kids First to your partner (the Defendant) in the correct way.  You must provide 
the court with proof that your partner was personally served with a file-stamped copy of 
the Complaint for Civil Union Divorce, Summons to Answer Complaint before the Court can 
consider granting your divorce.  (Note:  If your partner does not file with the Court a written 
answer or response to the Complaint for Civil Union Divorce and does not contact you in 
any way within 20 days after receipt of the Complaint, see the Uncontested Civil Union 
Divorce by Default Section below.) 

     

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Proof that your partner was properly served can be shown by file-stamping one or 

 

 

 

 

more of the following: 

 

 

 

 

 

APPEARANCE  AND  WAIVER: 
If  you  and  your  partner  (the  Defendant)  have 
agreed to and signed the Civil Union Divorce Decree, your partner must sign an 
 
Appearance and Waiver. By signing the Appearance and Waiver, your partner is 
stating  that  he  or  she  has  received  a  file-stamped  copy  of  the  Complaint  and 
Summons and that he or she agrees that the Court may grant the civil union divorce 
without his or her presence in Court. (Note: The Appearance and Waiver cannot be 
signed and dated before the Complaint is file-stamped by the Court.  If it is signed 
and dated before the Complaint was file-stamped, the Court will require that your 
partner sign another Appearance and Waiver which has been signed and dated 
after the Complaint was file-stamped.) 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

PROOF OF SERVICE: If your partner lives on O‘ahu, the Complaint and Summons 
and Notice to Attend Kids First must be personally served on your partner unless 
he or she is agreeing to sign the Civil Union Divorce Decree and Appearance and 
Waiver.  It cannot be mailed, unless your partner is willing to sign the Civil Union 
Divorce Decree and Appearance and Waiver forms.  The Complaint and Summons 
and Notice to Attend Kids First can be served by a private process server (Note: A 
list of private process servers may be obtained at the Family Court Service Center 
in Kapolei or Honolulu) or  by any responsible person who is over 18 years old other 
than yourself.  After service is complete, the person who served the Complaint and 
Summons and Notice to Attend Kids First on your partner must complete the Proof 
of Service.  Information regarding the date and time your partner was served and 
the place where your partner was served must be filled in.  The person who served
