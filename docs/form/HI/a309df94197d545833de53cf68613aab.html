(2)	  Unless  otherwise  provided  in  the  contract,  individually  liable  on  a  contract 
properly entered into in the guardian's representative capacity in the exercise of 
the  duties  and  powers  as  guardian  unless  the  guardian  fails  to  reveal  the 
guardian's capacity and the identity of the ward in the contract; 

 

 

 

 

 

(3)	  Personally liable to a third person for acts of the ward solely by reason of the
