INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION AND USE OF PROPERTY DIVISION 
 
 
CHARTS IN THE THIRD CIRCUIT, DOMESTIC DIVISION 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1. Purpose and Use. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

Cases where the division  and distribution  of marital  assets  and debts  are at issue can often 
 
 
 
be complex  and difficult.  A well prepared  property  division chart presents  the case in a 
 
 
format  which  is easy to follow.  It can be an excellent tool  for advocacy  as well  as for 
 
settlement,  education  of  clients, opposing  counsel  and the court  as to the specifics of the 
 
 
case.  Recognizing  this,  the  Family  Court  Memorandum  of  November  12,  1997, 
 
"Domestic Division  Policies  and Procedures" required  the movant  on a Motion  to Set to 
provide  a property  division  chart  as part  of the Settlement  Conference  Statement  due no 
 
later than  fourteen  (14) days prior to the settlement conference.  Similarly, the responding 
 
party  must  provide  a property  division  chart  as part  of  the responsive  Settlement 
 
 
Conference Statement  filed not later than seven (7) days prior to the settlement  conference. 
Those requirements  remain in effect, as do the requirements  that both parties exchange 
current Asset  & Debt  Statements,  current  Income  & Expense  Statements,  and  all  trial 
exhibits  no  later  than  twenty  one  (21) days  prior  to  the  settlement  conference.  The 
 
purpose  of  all  of  these  requirements  is  to  promote  settlement  by  making  each  party's  case 
 
transparent to the other, so that  both the parties  and the court  have  a realistic view  of what 
 
 
will be presented  should the case go to trial. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

The original property  division chart form was promulgated  in a November  1997 
memorandum.  Over  the  years,  case law  has  developed  further  delineating  and  defining 
 
 
 
the principles  of  marital  partnership  property  division.  In response,  the  Domestic 
 
 
Division  appointed  a property  division  committee  in  the  spring  of  2007  to review  the 
 
 
issue  and  make  recommendations  on  how  to  simplify,  standardize,  and  optimize  the use 
 
 
 
 
of property  division  charts.  The goal was to develop a property  division  chart and related 
 
procedures  that  would  display  the division  of the entire marital  estate, reflect  all Category 
 
 
1 and 3 property  division  credits, correctly apply marital partnership principles,  and cite to 
exhibits in the record. 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 

Although  the property  division chart is required  as a part of the Settlement Conference 
 
Statement  in  any  case  where  property  division  is at issue,  counsel  are  strongly 
 
encouraged  to prepare  these  charts early in the  divorce process  and to  use them  as a tool 
 
 
 
for settlement.  Counsel  should  also update their client's  financial  statements  and  the 
 
 
Property  Division  Chart immediately prior to the commencement  of trial if there are 
significant intervening  changes  in values  or values  that were not known  at the time of the 
 
 
Settlement  Conference.  A properly  prepared  property  division  chart  works  equally  well 
in simple as in complex cases. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  approved  property  division  chart is available  in MSExcel™  format  and can be 
downloaded  from the Family Law  Section webpage. 1  A blank  version  is also attached  to 
 
this  memorandum. 
 
1 When editing the Property Division Chart in MSExcel, use only the "copy and paste" functions.  Do not 
 
 

 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use the "cut and paste" functions.  Cutting will affect the borders and lines of the cells.

2.  How to fill in page one. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

Page one consists of Part A and Part B. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Part A. 
 
 

Part A illustrates the enumeration,  valuation  and proposed  distribution  of the 
 
marital estate. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

From the left side of the page,  the first column is for the number  of the particular  asset or 
 
 
debt.  Each  asset  or debt  should  be  numbered  in  a manner  corresponding  to the 
 
paragraphs  of the Asset  & Debt Statement.  For example, bank  accounts  are listed in 
 
paragraph  3 of the  Asset  & Debt  Statement.  The first listed bank  account  should be 
 
 
numbered  3.01, the next listed  3.02,  and  so forth.  To avoid confusion,  the party  filing the 
 
responsive Settlement Conference Statement will use the same number as was used by the 
 
 
party filing the first Settlement Conference Statement in referring to a particular  asset or 
 
debt.2  Generally,  the  assets  and  debts  should be  listed  in numerical  order,  except  that  a 
 
 
debt  which  is attached  to  a particular  asset---a car loan, or a home mortgage---should  be 
listed immediately  after the  asset  which  it encumbers.  The assets/debts  of  both  husband 
 
and wife must be listed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The  second  column  is  used  to  briefly  identify  the  particular  asset  or  debt  by  description, 
 
 
such  as  "Bank  of  Hawaii  Checking,"  or  "16  Aiea  Heights  Drive"  or  "FHB  Mastercard." 
If  additional  identifying  information  or  commentary  is  required,  this  should  be  placed  in 
 
endnotes (see below). 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

The third  column  indicates  who  currently  has title or legal  ownership  of the asset,  or who 
the  legal  obligor  on  the  debt  is.  Indicate  "H" for husband,  "W" for  wife,  "O" for  other, 
and  "J" for joint,  H/O for husband  and  a third  party,  etc.  Note  that  this entry  does not 
 
 
 
 
indicate  who  will  receive  the  asset  or  debt.  If there  is no  document  from  which 
 
 
ownership of  an asset can be established, enter "n/a".3 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

2 In some cases there may be disagreement as to the existence of assets or debts, in which case numbering
 
 
becomes problematic.  Where the first party believes there are five bank accounts, they would be numbered 
 
 
3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 3.04, and 3.05.  The second party may believe that there are five accounts, but two of them 
are different than listed by the first party.  In that case, the second party would number the two additional 
 
accounts 3.06 and 3.07, and would explain in endnotes that his client's position is that 3.04 and 3.05 do not 
 
exist.  Once  a  number  is used  by  one  party,  it  cannot  be  used  again  by  either  party  to  designate 
 
 
 
a different asset or debt.  Thus, if the plaintiff  files first and designates the First Hawaiian Bank joint 
account as 3.05, the number 3.05 must always be used for that account and can be used for no other asset or 
 
debt. 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

3 Some property may be owned  by a spouse as a trustee for another.  The circumstances under which a 
 
spouse holds bare legal title and the equitable interest is truly owned by a third party are beyond the scope 
 
of these instructions.  However, when a party preparing this chart believes that to be the situation, the value 
 
should be included with the description of the asset, the title should indicate the trustee status ("W as TE") 
 
and the value column should be blank so as not to compute the asset in the marital partnership.

The  fourth  column  is  used  to  indicate  whether  there  is  a  corresponding endnote  for  the 
 
entry.  A  discussion  of  endnotes  and  their  use  is  found  below.  Indicate  that  there  is  an 
 
endnote by placing an X in the box, if there is no endnote, leave the box blank. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

The fifth  column  is the value  of the  asset/debt.  In  most  cases, this will  be  a number,  but 
 
in  some instances  a non  numeric  entry may be  appropriate.  Examples  of  appropriate  non 
 
numeric  entries  are "unknown,"  "defined  benefit  plan"  for  a retirement  plan  without  a 
fixed dollar value  and which  is proposed  to be divided  per the Linson  formula,  "nominal" 
 
for items that must be listed but  may have no real  value,  "operating account" for checking 
 
accounts  in which  the  monthly  deposits  more  or less equal  monthly  withdrawals,  or 
 
 
"market value" for an asset that is intended  to be sold.  A negative value, such as a debt 
   
 
 
 
or an overdrawn bank account, should be entered with parentheses  around the number. 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

The last two columns,  labeled  "Husband"  and  "Wife" indicate the proposed  award  of the 
 
 
asset  or debt.  For example, if  a savings  account  with  a value  of  $10,000 is to be  awarded 
to  husband,  then  "$10,000"  should  be  entered  in  husband's  column.  If the  account  is to 
be  divided  equally, then  "$5,000" would  be  entered  in both  husband's  and  wife's  column. 
 
In most  cases, entries in these columns will  be numerical,  but  in some instances  a non 
 
numeric entry may  also be appropriate.  Examples  of appropriate non numeric  entries are 
"sell  and  split  equally,"  "Linson  share,"  "divide in kind"  and  so forth. 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Marital  Separate Property  (MSP), if  any, is listed  on the chart  with  a number, description, 
title, indication  of notes and  value.  However, in  the husband  or wife column, the  letters 
 
"MSP" will  be placed  in  the  owner's  column  instead  of  a number.  4  A  party  making  a 
 
 
 
 
claim  for MSP must  specifically  address  the  facts  supporting  this  claim in the 
accompanying Settlement Conference Statement. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The next  to last line in Part A  is the total  carried  forward  from the last line on the 
 
 
Continuation  Sheet, if any (see discussion below).  The Continuation  Sheet is only used 
when  there  are more  assets/debts  than  can be listed  on  the  existing Part  A.  The  last  line 
 
 
 
 
of part  A  is a recap  consisting  of three columns.  The first  shows the net  value  of  those 
 
items  in the marital  estate which  have numerical  values.  The second  and third  show the 
 
total net value of marital partnership property  awarded to husband  and wife, respectively. 
 
The husband  and wife columns  are the sum of marital  partnership  property  awarded to 
 
husband  and wife,  respectively,  but  do not  include  any MSP.5 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

4 Marital Separate Property is rare.  It is property owned  at the time of divorce which was excluded  from 
 
the marital partnership by an agreement in conformity with the Uniform Premarital Agreements Act, or by 
 
some other valid contract (i.e. a marital agreement).  Marital Separate Property is also property that meets 
 
 
all of the following three tests: (1) it was acquired by the spouse owner during the marriage by gift or 
inheritance, (2) it was expressly classified by the donee/heir as his or her separate property, and (3) after 
 
acquisition, it was maintained by itself and/or source other than one or both of the spouses and funded by 
 
 
 
sources other than marital partnership  income or property.  Hussey  v. Hussey, 77 Hawai'i 202, 881 P.2d 
 
1270 (App.  1994). 
 

   
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 Where there is no MSP, the first column will be the sum of the husband and wife columns. Where there is 
 
 
MSP, the first column will be the sum of the husband  and wife columns, plus the sum of all MSP.

Part B: 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Part  B is designed  to illustrate  the  application  of the partnership  model  without  deviation 
 
 
to the case.  Although  there  is a line titled  "Required  Equalization  Payment" the  form 
 
does not assume  that  an  equalization  payment  will  be made or that  it is fair and equitable 
 
in a particular  case to apply the partnership model  without  deviation.  However,  a party 
 
 
who is requesting deviation  must explicitly address that  issue in the accompanying 
 
Settlement Conference Statement. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

Line  1 restates  the division  of marital  partnership  property  from Part A.  Here. the  first 
column will always equal the sum of the husband  and  wife  columns, even in the rare 
 
instance where there is MSP.  The entries in Line 2 are the total of capital contributions 
 
(first column) and the respective  capital contributions  of husband  and wife.  These figures 
 
are  taken  from  Page  Two. Part  F.  Line  3 shows the  appreciation  (or depreciation),--in 
other words,  the profit  or  loss---of  the  marital  partnership.  In all three columns,  it is 
 
derived by  subtracting the capital contributions  (line 2) from the net value of partnership 
property  awarded  (line  l).  One half  of  this  figure is then  entered  in the  two columns to 
 
 
the right to indicate that  husband  and wife each are entitled  to half  of the net partnership 
 
profit  (or loss).  Line  4 indicates  the amount  to  add  or subtract  to each  party's  total 
award of partnership property  in order to ensure that each receives  the amount  he/she is 
entitled  to receive  if  the  partnership  model  is  applied  without  deviation.  It  is the 
 
 
difference between  Husband's  line 3 and Wife's  line  3, divided by two.  In the  example 
 
below.  300,000-296,000  =4,000.  Dividing  this  by  two results  in  2,000.  The  entries  in 
 
 
the husband  and wife columns  in line 4 will  always be the same number,  except  that one 
 
 
will  be  a positive  number  and  one will  be  a negative.  In  the example below, the 
 
 
 
proposed division of partnership property leaves husband 2,000 ahead of his partnership 
 
entitlement.  Thus,  a negative  2,000 is entered  in  his  column,  and  a positive  2,000 is 
 
 
entered  in  wife's column.  Line 5 shows the  equal  division  of partnership  profits/losses. 
Enter line 3 plus/  minus  line 4 for both  the  husband  and  wife  columns.  As  a cross-check, 
 
note that the entries in both  the husband  and wife column  should be equal, and  should be 
exactly one  half  of  the first column  of  line 3.  Line 6  shows  the value of any MSP 
 
awarded  to the  owner.  It  is the sum of all  MSP values owned  by  husband  or wife  from 
 
 
 
Part  A.  Line 7  shows  the  total  value  received  by  each  party.  including  each  party's

3.  How to fill in Page Two. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page Two illustrates the  enumeration,  and  valuation  of each party's  capital contributions. 
It  is divided  into three parts.  Part  C is used  to indicate each party's  net  worth  on date of 
 
 
marriage  (Category  1 capital contributions).  Parts D and E are used to indicate gifts or 
inheritances  received  during  marriage  (Category  3  capital  contributions).  If  there  are 
 
no capital contributions or  no claim for return of capital contributions is being  made, 
 
 
Page Two need not be prepared, and the entries on Line 2, Part B are zero in all three 
 
columns. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Part C. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

This part  is used  to indicate assets/debts  of each party on date of marriage.  From the left 
side of the page,  the first  column  is for the number  of the particular  asset  or  debt.  Each 
 
asset  or  debt  should  be  numbered.  If a particular  asset  or  debt  is still in existence,  use 
 
the same identifying number  as in Part  A.  For example, if husband  has  a savings account 
 
at First  Hawaiian  Bank  and it was designated  3.01 in Part  A,  and that  same account was 
 
in existence  on  date  of  marriage,  use  the  number  3.01 in Part  C,  as well.  If an  asset  or 
 
debt was in existence  on date of marriage,  but  is no longer in existence,  use the next 
 
unused number  to identify  it.  For  example,  if  husband  and  wife  currently  have  three 
 
 
bank accounts  designated  3.01, 3.02 and  3.03 in Part  A,  and wife had  another bank 
account on date of marriage  that no longer exists, identify that  bank  account in Part  C as 
 
 
3.04.  The values  of the  assets  or debts  are placed  in the husband  or wife  column 
depending on who owned the asset/debt  on date of marriage.  The value will be the date 
 
 
 
 
 
of marriage value.6 The last line of this section indicates the net worth 
 
 
 
of each party on 
 
date of marriage. 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Part D. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

This part  is used  to indicate gifts by one party received  during marriage  and not, in turn, 
 
gifted  over to the marital  estate.  From the left  side of the page, the first column is for the 
 
number  of  the particular  gift.  Each  gift  should  be  numbered.  The numbering  system  is 
the same as for Part  C, above.  The values of the gifts on the date of receipt  are placed  in 
the husband  or wife  column  depending  on  who  was  the recipient  of the  gift.7  The last 
 
line  of  this  section  indicates  the total  value  of  gifts  received  by  each  party  during 
 
 
 
marriage. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
6 Wong v. Wong, 87 Hawai'i 475, 960 P.2d  145 (App. 1998) creates a special rule for the value of a specific 
 
 
item of property which has been separately owned continuously from  the date of marriage (DOM) to the 
 
date of trial (DOCOEPOT).  If the value on DOCOEPOT  is no greater than on DOM, then its value 
 
 
includable in Category  1 is its NMV on DOCOEPOT.  For example, assume that the parties married  in 
1999, and just prior to that time the husband acquired stock in Enron Corporation worth $25,000.  It is now 
2007, and the parties are divorcing.  Husband still owns the Enron stock, but the company went bankrupt and 
 
 
the stock is now worth  $500.  The Category  1 NMV  is $500, not $25,000,  and the former  is the number 
 
 
 
 
that will be entered in both Part A and Part C. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 Similarly, Wong v. Wong, above, mandates that the value of Category 3 property which has been 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continuously owned from date of receipt through DOCOEPOT can be no greater than its current NMV.

Part E. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

This part  is used  to  indicate  inheritances  received  by each  during  marriage  and  not,  in 
turn,  gifted  over to the  marital  estate.  From  the  left  side  of the page,  the  first  column is 
 
for the  number  of the particular  inheritance.  Each  inheritance  should be  numbered.  The 
 
numbering  system is the same as for Part  C, above.  The values of the inheritances  on the 
 
 
date of receipt  are placed  in the husband  or wife  column  depending  on who  was the 
 
recipient  of the inheritance.  The last line of this  section  indicates the  total  value  of 
 
inheritances  received  by  each party  during marriage. 8 
   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Part F. 
 
 

 

 

This part  is used  to indicate  the  sum total  of  each party's  Category  1 and  3 capital 
 
 
contributions  and  is the  sum  of  each party's  values  in part  C, D and E.  The figures 
 
 
entered in Part  F will  be entered on, Part  B, Line  2 of page  one of the property  division 
 
chart. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4.  Continuation Sheet. 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 

The Continuation  Sheet for Part A on page  3 is a supplemental  attachment to the property 
 
 
division  chart.  It is not  mandatory  and  should  only be used  when  additional  space is 
 
 
needed in Part A on page  1.  The total from the last line on the Continuation  Sheet which 
states "Total (Enter in Part  A on page  1)" is the total  assets or debts listed on the 
 
Continuation  Sheet only.  This  total  is then  transferred  to the line in Part  A  on page  1 
 
 
 
which states "Total from Part A Continuation  Sheet." 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5.  Footers. 
 

 

 

 

In the footer located at the bottom of each page fill in (a) the case name ("Doe  v. Doe"), 
 
(b) the FC-D No., (c) the preparer ("Husband"  or "Wife"),  and (d) the  date the chart  was 
 
prepared.9 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6.  Use of notes and exhibits. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The use  of  endnotes  is mandatory.  The property  division  chart  should be  accompanied 
with  endnotes that explain what  the evidence demonstrates  as to the existence,  ownership 
 
and value  of the  asset/debt,  usually  with reference  to  a particular  trial  exhibit or exhibits 
 
(see below).  Since trial  exhibits  are exchanged  at least  seven  days before the first 
 
Settlement  Conference Statement  is due, the court expects that counsel will have carefully 
 
 
considered  both  his  and  the  other  party's  exhibits  and  is prepared  to prove  the 
 
information  asserted in his property  division  chart  at trial.  However,  a party  may  accept 
 
 
information  from the  other  party's Asset  & Debt  Statement.  Endnotes  will  be  numbered, 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 The Wong v. Wong rule on valuation applies to inheritances as well as gifts.

corresponding  to the numbering used  on the property  division  chart.  Thus, if item 3.01 
 
is husband's  Bank  of  Hawaii  savings  account,  endnote  3.01  should  discuss  that 
 
account, with  specific reference  to  any trial  exhibits pertinent  to that  account.

At  the  date  of  marriage  Wife's  still-owned  1998  BMW  740i  was  worth  $45,000.00,  but  because  of the 
 
 
 
rule in Woodworth v. Woodworth, 7 Haw. App. 11, 740 P.2d 36 (1987) and  Wong v. Wong, 87 Hawaii 
 
 
 
 
475, 960 P.2d 145 (App.1998), Wife's capital contribution credit for this asset is limited to 
 
 
 
 
 
$8,000.00. See Trial Exhibits G and H. 
 
 
 
 
See Trial Exhibit 7. 
 
 
 
See Trial Exhibit 8.

See Trial Exhibit 12. 
 
 
 
See Trial Exhibit I. 
 
 
See Trial Exhibit J. 
 
 
 
See Trial Exhibit K. 
 
 
 
This asset is awarded to Husband pursuant to the premarital agreement of the parties entered into 
 
 
 
between Husband and Wife on January 5, 1998.  It is therefore marital separate property under 
 
 
 
 
, 
Hawai‘i 
Hussey v. Hussey, 77 Hawai‘i 202, 881 P.2d 1270 (App. 1994) and  Prell v. Silverstein, 
 
 
 
 
 
162 P.3d 2 (App. 2007).  As such, its value is included in the total net value of the entire marital estate, 
 
 
 
 
but its value is not included in the total net value of marital partnership property.  See Trial Exhibit 13.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
