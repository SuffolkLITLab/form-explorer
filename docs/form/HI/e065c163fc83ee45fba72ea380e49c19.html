You may not withhold more than the lesser of: 1) the amounts allowed by the Federal Consumer Credit Protection 
Act (CCPA) [15 USC §1673 (b)]; or 2) the amounts allowed by the law of the state of the employee/obligor's 
principal place of employment if the place of employment is in a state; or the tribal law of the employee/obligor's 
principal place of employment if the place of employment is under tribal jurisdiction.  The CCPA is available at 
www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/legacy/files/garn01.pdf.  If the Order Information section does not indicate 
that the arrears are greater than 12 weeks, then the employer should calculate the CCPA limit using the lower 
percentage. 

If there is more than one IWO against this employee/obligor and you are unable to fully honor all IWOs due to 
federal, state, or tribal withholding limits, you must honor all IWOs to the greatest extent possible, giving priority 
to current support before payment of any past-due support. 

If the obligor is a nonemployee, obtain withholding  limits from the Supplemental Information  section in this 
IWO.    This  information  is  also  available  at  www.acf.hhs.gov/css/resource/state-income-withholding-contacts-
and-program-requirements.

VI. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR EMPLOYERS/INCOME WITHHOLDERS:  (Completed by Sender)
Priority:  Withholding for support has priority over any other legal process under State law against the same 
income (section 466(b)(7) of the Social Security Act).  If a federal tax levy is in effect, please notify the sender.

Payments:    You  must  send  child  support  payments  payable  by  income  withholding  to  the  appropriate  State 
Disbursement Unit or to a tribal CSE agency within 7 business days, or fewer if required by state law, after the 
date the income would have been paid to the employee/obligor and include the date you withheld the support 
from his or her income.  You may combine withheld amounts from more than one employee/obligor’s income in 
a  single  payment  as  long  as  you  separately  identify  each  employee/obligor’s  portion  of  the  payment.    Child 
support  payments  may  not  be  made  through  the  federal  Office  of  Child  Support  Enforcement  OCSE)  Child 
Support Portal. 

Lump Sum Payments:  You  may  be required to notify a state or tribal CSE agency of upcoming lump sum 
payments to this employee/obligor such as bonuses, commissions, or severance pay.  Contact the sender to 
determine if you are required to report and/or withhold lump sum payments.  Employers/income withholders may 
use  OCSE’s  Child  Support  Portal  (ocsp.acf.hhs.gov/csp/)  to  provide  information  about  employees  who  are 
eligible to receive lump sum payments and to provide contacts, addresses, and other information about their 
companies.  Child support payments may not be made through the federal OCSE Child Support Portal. 

Liability:  If you have any doubts about the validity of this IWO, contact the sender.  If you fail to withhold income 
from the employee/obligor’s income as the IWO directs, you are liable for both the accumulated amount you 
should have withheld and any penalties set by state or tribal law/procedure.  A brief summary of an employer’s 
responsibilities is also included in the Hawaii Employer’s Guide Income Withholding for Child Support Obligations 
provided with this Notice.  The penalty for an employer who fails to comply with the Order or Notice is defined in 
Sections 571-52.2(g), 571-52.3, 576D-14(h), and 576E-16(c) of the Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes. 

Anti-discrimination:    You  are  subject  to  a  fine  determined  under  state  or  tribal  law  for  discharging  an 
employee/obligor from employment, refusing to employ, or taking disciplinary action against an employee/obligor 
because of this IWO.  The penalty for an employer who violates this section is defined in Sections 571-52(d), 
571-52.2(m), 571-52.3, 576D-14(h), and 576E-16(e) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.

Supplemental Information:  For income withholding purpose, non-employees should be treated in the same 
manner as regular employees.  See definition of income in Sections 571-52(e), 571-52.2(n), 571-52.3, 576D-
14(h), and 576E-16(f) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
