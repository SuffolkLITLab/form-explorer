WHO CAN FILE FOR DIVORCE? 

 

 

 

 

In order to file a civil union divorce action in the Family Court of the First Circuit (on 
O‘ahu),  you  must  meet  certain  limited  residency  requirements.  You  must  have  been 
domiciled or physically present on O‘ahu continuously for at least 3 months prior to the 
filing of the Complaint for Civil Union Divorce and either you or your partner must have 
been domiciled or physically present in the State of  Hawai‘i continuously for at least 6 
months prior to the filing of the Complaint for Civil Union Divorce.  The islands are divided 
into separate circuits. You must meet these limited residency requirements and file your 
Complaint for Civil Union Divorce in the correct circuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  same  sex marriage  cases,  you  may file  your  divorce  action  on  O‘ahu  if  your 

 

 

 

 

resident state does not recognize same sex marriage.

•  Second Circuit  =  Mau‘i, Lâna‘i, and Moloka‘i 
•  Third Circuit 
•  Fifth Circuit

divorce or visit the Judiciary’s website at www.courts.state.hi.us. 

BEFORE YOU START 

Read  through  this  entire  instruction  packet  before  you  start  to  fill  in  the 
documents.  This packet includes instructions, information, and forms needed to obtain 
an uncontested civil union divorce.  The instructions tell you which documents need to be 
completed, when the documents need to be file-stamped by the Court, and what you need 
to do to place your civil union divorce case on the Court Calendar.  The Uncontested Civil 
Union  Divorce  (Without  Minor  or  Dependent  Children)  Document  Checklist  contains 
information on how many copies of each document you need to submit and who signs the 
document.  The Checklist also helps you see what documents you have completed and 
which documents you still have to do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Civil Union Divorce Decree in this packet contains provisions that cover most 
civil union divorce situations.  There may be other terms or provisions necessary for your 
case. You are strongly urged to talk to an attorney to discuss your legal rights and duties. 

 

 

 

 

Most  uncontested  divorces  are  done  by  affidavit,  with  a  Judge  reviewing  the 
documents you submit.  This means that neither you nor your partner appear at a Court

thoroughly and make sure you understand what the document says.  Do not sign any 
document you do not agree with or that you do not understand.

PLACING YOUR CASE ON THE COURT CALENDAR: 

 

  

When you have completed and filed all necessary divorce documents reflected in 
the Checklist,  your case will be ready to set on the Uncontested Civil Union Divorce by 
Affidavit (UCUDA) calendar.  Refer to the Uncontested Civil Union Divorce (Without Minor 
and/or Dependent Children) Documents Checklist for a summary of which documents are 
required. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If you do not have an attorney, it is suggested that your documents be reviewed at 
the Family Court Service Center located on the first floor of the Ronald T.Y. Moon Kapolei 
Courthouse,  4675  Kapolei  Parkway,  Kapolei,  Hawai‘i  or  on  the  first  floor  of  the 
Ka‘ahumanu Hale, 777 Punchbowl Street, Honolulu, Hawai‘i.  The Service Center staff will 
review your documents for completeness and make sure that all necessary documents 
have been submitted.  
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Drop off your UCUDA packet of necessary documents noted on the Documents 
Checklist to the Judicial Services Office, Ronald T.Y. Moon Kapolei Courthouse,  4675 
Kapolei  Parkway,  First  Floor,  Window  #  5,  Kapolei,  Hawai‘i  96707.  Packets  may  be

AFTER THE JUDGE REVIEWS YOUR DOCUMENTS 

 

 

 

 

Once your case is set on the Uncontested Civil Union Divorce by Affidavit calendar, 
your documents will be reviewed by the Judge.  If the Judge grants your divorce and signs 
   
your Civil Union Divorce Decree, you should receive certified copies of the Civil Union 
Divorce Decree in the mail within four (4) to  six (6) weeks after the Judge reviews your 
 
documents. If you do not receive the documents, it is your responsibility to check the status 
of your case on the Judiciary’s website at www.courts.state.hi.us.  The status of your case 
will not be given out over the telephone.  If the disposition calendar says that your civil 
 
union divorce was “GRANTED,” wait a reasonable time for the Civil Union Divorce Decree 
to be sent to you in the mail. If your divorce is “DENIED”, a copy of the disposition calendar 
will  be  mailed  to  you  in  the  envelope  you  provided.  You  must  follow  the  Judge’s 
instructions  noted  on  the  disposition  calendar  before  your  civil  union  divorce  can  be 
finalized.

STEPS TO OBTAIN AN UNCONTESTED CIVIL UNION DIVORCE 
(Without Minor and/or Dependent Children) 

STEP 1:	  OPENING YOUR CIVIL UNION DIVORCE CASE 

 

(If you are the one who is filing for divorce, you are the “PLAINTIFF” and your 
partner is the “DEFENDANT.”) 

 

To open or start your divorce case, you must take certain documents to the court 
house for filing. You will need the following documents to open or start your divorce case: 

 

 

1.	 
2.	 
3.	 
4.	 

COMPLAINT FOR CIVIL UNION DIVORCE (“Complaint”); 
SUMMONS TO ANSWER COMPLAINT (“Summons”); 
CIVIL UNION DIVORCE ACTION INFORMATION (“CUDA Info”); and 
NOTICE TO ATTEND KIDS FIRST 
(If either partner has minor child(ren) from 
 
other relationships this form must be completed.  You can request to be excused 
from attending this program by filling out the request form available at the Family 
Court Service Center.  Failure to attend the Kids First Program may result in denial 
of your civil union divorce until you comply with this requirement.  If you have any 
questions, please log on to the  Kids First website at www.kidsfirsthawaii.com or call 
the Kids FIrst Program at 954-8280 or leave a message at  954-8281. 

  
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If your partner does not live on O‘ahu, you must also submit the following document 
to obtain the Court’s approval before serving your partner by certified or registered mail: 

 

 

 

5.	  MOTION AND DECLARATION FOR SERVICE BY MAIL; ORDER FOR SERVICE 
BY MAIL  (Note:  Drop off this document along with the Complaint, Summons, 
CUDA Info, and  Notice to Attend Kids First, if applicable, to the Judicial Services 
Office on the First Floor, Window # 5, at the Ronald T.Y. Moon Kapolei Courthouse 
to obtain the Court’s approval.) 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

After completion, take the originals and copies of the above documents along with 
required court filing fees  to the Legal Documents Section (Ronald T.Y. Moon Kapolei 
Courthouse, 4675 Kapolei Parkway, First Floor, Kapolei, Hawai‘i or Ka‘ahumanu Hale, 777 
Punchbowl Street, First Floor, Honolulu, Hawai‘i) to be filed-stamped by the Court.  The 
Court  will  assign  you  a  case  number  which  you  need  to  write  on  all  the  rest  of  your 
 
documents. 
 
STEP 2:	  GETTING  THE  DOCUMENTS  TO  YOUR  SPOUSE:  “SERVICE”  OF THE 
 
COMPLAINT  AND  SUMMONS  AND  FILE-STAMPING  THE  SERVICE 
 
 
DOCUMENT 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“Service” means getting a file-stamped copy of the Complaint, Summons and Notice 
to Attend Kids First if applicable to your partner (the Defendant) in the correct way.  You 
must  provide  the  court  with  proof  that  your  partner  was  personally  served  with  a  file-
stamped copy of the Complaint for Civil Union Divorce, Summons to Answer Complaint

APPEARANCE  AND  WAIVER: 
If  you  and  your  partner  (the  Defendant)  have 
agreed to and signed the Civil Union Divorce Decree, your partner must sign an 
Appearance and Waiver. By signing the Appearance and Waiver, your partner is 
stating  that  he  or  she  has  received  a  file-stamped  copy  of  the  Complaint  and 
Summons and that he or she agrees that the Court may grant the divorce without 
his or her presence in Court. (Note:  The Appearance and Waiver cannot be signed 
and dated before the Complaint is file-stamped by the Court.  If it is signed and 
dated before the Complaint was file-stamped, the Court will require that your partner 
sign another Appearance and Waiver which has been signed and dated after the 
Complaint was file-stamped.) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

PROOF OF SERVICE:  If your partner lives on O‘ahu, the Complaint and Summons 
and Notice to Attend Kids First, if applicable, must be personally served on your 
partner unless he or she is agreeing to sign the Civil Union Divorce Decree and 
 
Appearance and Waiver.  It cannot be mailed, unless your partner signs the Civil 
Union Divorce Decree and Appearance and Waiver.  The Complaint and Summons 
and Notice to Attend Kids First, if applicable, can be served by a private process 
server (Note: A list of private process servers may be obtained at the Family Court 
Service Center in Kapolei or Honolulu) or  by any responsible person who is over 
18 years old other than yourself.  After service is complete, the person who served 
the Complaint and Summons and Notice to Attend Kids First, if applicable, on your 
partner must complete the Proof of Service.  Information regarding the date and 
time your partner was served and the place where your partner was served must be 
filled in.  The person who served the Complaint and Summons must also sign the 
Proof of Service.  (Note:  If after service of the Complaint and Summons, you and 
your  partner  have  agreed  to  and  signed  the  Civil  Union  Divorce  Decree,  your 
 
partner must also sign an Appearance and Waiver.) 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

STATEMENT OF MAILING; EXHIBITS 1 and 2:  If your partner does not live on 
 
 
O‘ahu,  you  may  serve  your  partner  by  certified  or  registered  mail,  restricted 
 
delivery.  You must complete the Motion and Declaration for Service by Mail; Order 
for Service by Mail and obtain the Court’s approval before serving your partner by 
mail. The Receipt for Certified Mail and Domestic Return Receipt or the Receipt for 
Registered Mail and Return Receipt must be attached to the Statement of Mailing

Complaint, you and your partner have agreed to and signed the Civil Union Divorce 
Decree, then your partner must also sign an Appearance and Waiver.)

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
