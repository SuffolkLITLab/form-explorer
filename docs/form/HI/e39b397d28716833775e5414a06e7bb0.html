is provided on preparing documents and presenting them for filing.  Samples of the basic forms are 
also included.  You may also need other forms that are not part of this packet.  The samples that  are 
attached are provided only as a guide and are designed to meet the legal requirements.  Parties or 
agencies  who  wish  to  amend  or  alter  these  documents  may  do  so  as  long  as  the  results  are 
consistent with statutory requirements.   

If you are not an attorney, we strongly recommend that you seek the services of an attorney.  
The  Lawyer  Referral  Service  (808-537-9140)  of  the  Hawaii  State  Bar  Association  may  provide 
names  of  attorneys,  but  not  information  on  fees.    You  may  also  consult  the  yellow  pages  of  the 
telephone book for attorneys who specialize in family law. 

Legal  Aid  Society  of  Hawaii  offers  assistance  to  people  with  low  incomes  who  meet  their 
financial criteria.  You may call their intake number:  800-499-4302, to see if you qualify and for more 
information. 

Volunteer  Legal  Services  also  offers  assistance  to  people  with  low  incomes  who  meet  their 

financial criteria.  Please call 1-808-587-7046 for more information. 

Should  you  decide  to  proceed  on  your  own  without  the  assistance  of  an  attorney,  you  may 
wish  to  review  sections  560:1-401  and  560:5-201  to  560:5-210  of  the  Hawaii  Revised  Statutes 
pertaining  to  Guardians  of  the  Person  of  Minors.    You  are  responsible  for  assuring  that  your 
documents  comply  with  Rule  3  of  the  Rules  of  the  Circuit  Court,  applicable  Hawaii  Family  Court 
Rules and applicable sections of the Hawaii Revised Statutes as well as any memoranda issued by 
the Family Court. 

Copies  of  these  statutes,  rules  and  memoranda  are  available  at  the  Law  Library  at  the 
Courthouse  located  at  Hoapili  Hale,  2145  Main  Street,  2nd  Floor,  Wailuku,  Hawaii.    Court  Rules  & 
Statutes  are  also  available  on-line  at  www.courts.state.hi.us  (rules)  and  www.capitol.hawaii.gov

“Petition for Appointment of a Guardian...” states the factual and legal basis for the 
appointment of a guardian and asks the court to issue an Order Appointing Guardian 
with [ ] Limited [ ] Unlimited Authority. 

“Notice  of  Hearing”  is  attached  to  the  Petition.    Court  personnel  will  schedule  the 
hearing and fill in the blank spaces for the date and time of hearing. 

“List of Exhibits” this cover sheet organizes supporting documents that are submitted 
at the time of filing the Petition.  Documents that are attached to this cover sheet and 
submitted as exhibits must be original copies. 

The List of Exhibits must include a certified copy of the subject child’s birth certificate 
as  well  as  certified  copies  of  any  death  certificates  of  deceased  persons  which  are 
required notice (see Service & Notice below). 

“Waiver  of  Notice  and  Consent  to  Guardianship”  informs  the  court  that  a  person, 
who  is  entitled  to  receive  notice,  agrees  to  have  the  guardianship  proceedings  take 
place  without  his  or  her  involvement.    This  document  may  be  filed  to  support  the 
Petition  for  appointment  of  Guardian.    The  proposed  guardian  is  always  expected  to 
attend the hearing, unless previously excused by the court. 

This  form  also  allows  interested  parties  to  waive  the  requirement  that  they  be 
given  at  least  14-days  advance  notice  of  the  hearing  on  the  Petition.    It  has  a 
check box if the interested party wants to waive notice of any future hearings. 

“Order Appointing Guardian with [ ] Limited [ ] Unlimited Authority” contains the 
Judge’s  finding  and  states,  among  other  things,  the  conditions  under  which  the 
guardian shall serve and the events that will terminate the guardianship. 

“Letters  of  Guardianship”  serves  as  proof  of  the  guardian’s  appointment  and 
restates  certain  items  that  are  included  in  the  Order  Appointing  Guardian,  other  than 
the Court’s findings.

How to Prepare Documents for Filing 
 

A “No-Bounce” filing policy currently in effect requires Documents Receiving Clerks to accept 
documents for filing even if presented in improper form.  YOU  ARE RESPONSIBLE for assuring that 
your documents comply with applicable rules, statutes and judges’ memoranda.  Court clerks are not 
allowed to give legal advice.  Statutory deficiencies may affect the granting of the guardianship at the 
hearing. 

lthough the forms do not need to be typed, they must be legible and in black ink. 

Signature:  Documents must be dated and signed in black ink. 

Name:  
 
 
 
 

Be sure to include the Petitioner’s name, address and phone 
number on the upper left-hand corner of the first page of each  
document.  A phone number is required.   

Copies:  

Prepare a sufficient number* of copies (see Service & Notice below).   

The amount of copies that should be made depend on the number of parties involved.  Please also make sure that you 
have enough certified copies. 

nitial Filing: 

 

STEP 1: 

Complete the following forms by writing or typing in the relevant information: 

•Petition for Appointment of a Guardian of the Person of a Minor 
(“Petition”) 
•Notice of Hearing 
•List of Exhibits 

Should  you  wish  to  have  more  than  one  person  serve  as  co-guardians, 
amend  pertinent  portions  of  the  documents  to  show  that  this  is  a  co-
guardianship case. 

TEP 2: 

Make copies and put the forms into sets: 

Make copies of the Petition and Notice of Hearing.  The total number of 
copies depends on how many parties need to be served with the Petition.  
You will always need an original copy for the Court and an additional copy 
for the Petitioner.  In other words, in addition to the persons that must be 
noticed according to the Service & Notice section, you must add two (2) 
copies. 

Staple the Notice of Hearing to the back of the Petition for all copies.  Then clip 
all sets together with the original set on top. 

Make 1 copy of the List of Exhibits and attached exhibits.  Take both for filing.  
The court keeps the original and Petitioner gets one file copy for their records.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
