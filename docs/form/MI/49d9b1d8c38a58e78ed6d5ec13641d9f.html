RULES CONCERNING THE STATE BAR OF MICHIGAN 

Rule 1.  State Bar of Michigan. 

The State Bar of Michigan is the association of the members of the bar of this state, 
organized and existing as a public body corporate pursuant to powers of the 
Supreme Court over the bar of the state.  The State Bar of Michigan shall, under 
these rules, aid in promoting improvements in the administration of justice and 
advancements in jurisprudence, in improving relations between the legal profession 
and the public, and in promoting the interests of the legal profession in this state. 

Rule 2.  Membership. 

Those  persons  who  are  licensed  to  practice  law  in  this  state  shall  constitute  the 
membership  of  the  State  Bar  of  Michigan,  subject  to  the  provisions  of  these  rules.  
Law students may become section members of the State Bar Law Student Section.  
None other than a member’s correct name shall be entered upon the official register 
of attorneys of this state.  Each member, upon admission to the State Bar and in the 
annual  dues  notice,  must  provide  the  State  Bar  with  the  member’s  correct  name, 
physical address, and email address, that can be used, among other things, for the 
annual dues notice and to effectuate electronic service as authorized by court rule, 
and  such  additional  information  as  may  be  required.    If  the  physical  address 
provided  is  a  mailing  address  only,  the  member  also  must  provide  a  street  or 
building address for the member’s business or residence.  No member shall practice 
law  in  this  state  until  the  information  required  in  this  Rule  has  been  provided.  
Members  shall  promptly  update  the  State  Bar  with  any  change  of  name,  physical 
address, or email address.  The State Bar shall be entitled to due notice of, and to 
intervene  and  be  heard  in,  any  proceeding  by  a  member  to  alter  or  change  the 
member’s name.  The name and address on file with the State Bar at the time shall 
control in any matter arising under these rules involving the sufficiency of notice to 
a member or the propriety of the name used by the member in the practice of law or 
in  a  judicial  election  or  in  an  election  for  any  other  public  office.    Every  active 
member  shall  annually  provide  a  certification  as  to  whether  the  member  or  the 
member’s  law  firm  has  a  policy  to  maintain  interest-bearing  trust  accounts  for 
deposit  of  client  and  third-party  funds.    The  certification  shall  be  included  on  the 
annual  dues  notice  and  shall  require  the  member’s  signature  or  electronic 
signature. 

By order dated May 10, 2005, this Court adopted the amendments of Rules 2, 5, and 
6  of  the  Rules  Concerning  the  State  Bar  of  Michigan  with  immediate  effect.  472 
Mich cxii-cxv (2005).  Notice and an opportunity for comment at the September 29, 
2005,  public  hearing  having  been  provided,  and  consideration  having  been  given, 
the  amendments  of  Rules  2,  5,  and  6  of  the  Rules  Concerning  the  State  Bar  of 
Michigan are retained.

Rule 3.  Membership Classes. 

(A) Active. 

A  person  engaged  in the  practice  of  law  in  Michigan  must be an  active  member  of 
the State Bar.  In addition to its traditional meaning, the term “person engaged in 
the  practice  of  law”  in  this  rule  includes  a  person  licensed  to  practice  law  in 
Michigan or another jurisdiction and employed in Michigan in the administration of 
justice or in a position which requires that the person be a law school graduate, but 
does not include (1) a judicial law clerk who is a member or is seeking to become a 
member  of  the  bar  of  another  jurisdiction  and  who  does  not  intend  to  practice  in 
Michigan  after  the  clerkship  ends,  or  (2)  an  instructor  in  law.    Only  an  active 
member may vote in a State Bar election or hold a State Bar office.  A person not an 
active  member  who  engages  in  the  practice  of  law  is  subject  to  discipline  or 
prosecution for unauthorized practice. 

(B) Inactive.  

An active member may request an inactive classification. 

(1)  If  the  period  of  inactivity  is  less  than  3  years,  the  member  may  be 
reclassified as active by 

(a) applying to the State Bar secretary; 

(b) paying the full amount of the annual dues for the current fiscal year; and 

(c) demonstrating that no disciplinary action has been taken or is currently 
pending in another jurisdiction. 

(2) If the period of inactivity is 3 years or more, the member must, in addition to 
fulfilling  the  requirements  of  subrule  (B)(1)(a)-(c),  obtain  a  certificate  from  the 
Board  of  Law  Examiners  that  the  member  possesses  sufficient  ability  and 
learning  in  the  law  to  enable  the  member  to  properly  practice  as  an  attorney 
and counselor in Michigan. 

If  the  inactive  member  has  been  or  is  currently  subject  to  disciplinary  action  in 
another  jurisdiction,  the  application  must  be  referred  to  the  Attorney  Discipline 
Board and action on the application delayed until the board makes a decision.  

(C) Law Student. 

(D) Affiliate. 

A  student  in  good  standing  at  a  law  school  approved  by  the  Board  of  Law 
Examiners  or  the  American  Bar  Association  may  be  a  member  of  the  law  student 
section. 

A  legal  assistant  as  defined  in  the  State  Bar  bylaws  may  become  an  affiliate 
member of the State Bar of Michigan and shall thereupon be a member of the legal 
assistants  section.    A  legal  administrator  as  defined  in  the  State  Bar  bylaws  may 
become an affiliate member of the State Bar of Michigan and shall thereupon be a 
member of the legal administrators section.

(E) Resignation.  

An  active  or  inactive  member  who  is  not  subject  to  pending  disciplinary  action  in 
this  state  or  any  other  jurisdiction  may  resign  from  membership  by  notifying  the 
secretary of the State Bar in writing.  The secretary shall notify the member when 
the  request  is  accepted,  whereupon  the  member  no  longer  will  be  qualified  to 
practice law in Michigan and no longer will be eligible to receive any other member 
benefits.  The secretary of the State Bar also shall notify the clerk of the Supreme 
Court of the resignation.  To be readmitted as a member of the State Bar, a person 
who  has  voluntarily  resigned  and  who  is  not  otherwise  eligible  for  admission 
without  examination  under  Rule  5  of  the  Rules  for  the  Board  of  Law  Examiners 
must  reapply  for  admission,  satisfy  the  Board  of  Law  Examiners  that  the  person 
possesses the requisite character and fitness to practice law, obtain a passing score 
on the Michigan Bar Examination, and pay applicable fees and dues.  Resignation 
does  not  deprive  the  Attorney  Grievance  Commission  or  the  Attorney  Discipline 
Board  of  jurisdiction  over  the  resignee  with  respect  to  misconduct  that  occurred 
before the effective date of resignation. 

(F) Emeritus Membership.  

Effective  October  1,  2004,  an  active  or  inactive  member  who  is  70  years  of  age  or 
older  or  has  been  a  member  of  the  State Bar  for  at  least  30 years,  and  who  is  not 
subject  to  pending  disciplinary  action  in  this  state  or  any  other  jurisdiction,  may 
elect  emeritus  status  by  notifying  the  secretary  of  the  State  Bar  in  writing.    The 
secretary  shall  notify  the  member  when  the  request  is  accepted,  whereupon  the 
member no longer will be qualified to practice law in Michigan, but will be eligible 
to receive other member benefits as directed by the Board of Commissioners of the 
State Bar.  The secretary of the State Bar also shall notify the clerk of the Supreme 
Court when a member is given emeritus status.  Members who were age 70 or older 
as  of  October  1,  2003,  who  resigned  or  were  suspended  from  membership  after 
October  1,  2003, but before  September  30,  2004,  for  nonpayment  of  dues  are  to  be 
automatically  reinstated  as  emeritus  members,  effective  October  1,  2004,  unless 
they notify the secretary of the State Bar that they do not wish to be reinstated. 

(1)  Grievances  and  Discipline.    Emeritus  status  does  not  deprive  the  Attorney 
Grievance Commission or the Attorney Discipline Board of jurisdiction over the 
emeritus member.  

(2)  Readmission.    To  be  readmitted  as  an  active  member  of  the  State  Bar,  a 
member  who  has  voluntarily  elected  emeritus  status  and  who  is  not  otherwise 
eligible  for  admission  without  examination  under  Rule  5  of  the  Rules  for  the 
Board of Law Examiners must reapply for admission, satisfy the Board of Law 
Examiners  that  the  person  possesses  the  requisite  character  and  fitness  to 
practice law, obtain a passing score on the Michigan Bar Examination, and pay 
applicable fees and dues.

Rule 4.  Membership Dues. 

(A) An active member’s dues for each fiscal year (October 1 through September 30) 
are payable at the State Bar’s principal office by October 1 of each year.  The dues 
consist  of  three  separate  amounts  to  be  set  by  the  Supreme  Court  to  fund:  (1)  the 
Attorney  Grievance  Commission  and  the  Attorney  Discipline  Board,  (2)  the  client 
security  fund  administered  by  the  State  Bar,  and  (3)  other  State  Bar  expenses.  
Each  amount  shall  be  listed  separately  in  the  dues  notice.    An  inactive  member 
shall  be  assessed  one-half  the  amounts  assessed  an  active  member  for  the  client 
security  fund  and  general  expenses,  but  the  full  amount  designated  for  the 
discipline agencies. 

(B) A member who is admitted to the State Bar between April 1 and September 30 
shall be assessed one-half the full amount of dues for that fiscal year. 

(C)  Dues  notices  must  be  sent  to  all  members  before  September  20.    A  $50  late 
charge will be added to a dues payment postmarked after November 30.  The State 
Bar must send a written notice of delinquency to the last recorded address provided 
as required by Rule 2 to a member who fails to pay dues by November 30.  Active 
members  must  be  notified  by  registered  or  certified  mail.    Inactive  members  must 
be notified by first class mail.  If the dues and the late charge are not paid within 30 
days  after  the  notice  is  sent,  the  individual  is  suspended  from  membership  in  the 
State Bar.  If an individual is not subject to a disciplinary order and the suspension 
is  for  less  than  3  years,  the  member  will  be  reinstated  on  the  payment  of  dues,  a 
$100 reinstatement fee, and late charges owing from the date of the suspension to 
the  date  of  the  reinstatement.    If  the  suspension  is  for  3  years  or  more,  the 
individual  must  also  apply  for  recertification  under  Rule  8  for  the  Board  of  Law 
Examiners. 

(D) A person who has been a member of the State Bar for at least 50 years shall not 
be  assessed  general  expenses,  but  shall  pay  the  full  amount  assessed  other 
members  for  the  client  security  fund  and  the  discipline  agencies.    A  member  who 
elects emeritus status pursuant to Rule 3(F) is exempt from paying dues. 

(E)  An  active  or  inactive  member  in  good  standing  serving  in  the  United  States 
Armed  Forces  in  full-time  active-duty  status,  as  defined  by  the  United  States 
Department  of  Defense,  is  eligible  for  a  waiver  of  payment  of  dues,  including  the 
attorney  discipline  system  fee  and  the  client  security  fund  assessment.    An 
application  for  a  waiver  of  dues  that  includes  a  copy  of  military  orders  showing 
federal  active-duty  status  must  be  made  for  each  year  for  which  a  dues  waiver  is 
requested, and a waiver will be granted up to a total of four times.  A member for 
whom a waiver of dues is granted continues to be subject to the disciplinary system. 

(F)  Annual  dues  for  affiliate  members  and  law  student  section  members  are 
established  annually  by  the  Board  of  Commissioners  in  an  amount  not  to  exceed 
one-third of the portion of dues for active members which fund State Bar activities 
other  than  the  attorney  discipline  system  and  are  payable  at  the  State  Bar’s 
principal office by October 1 of each year.

commencing  upon  the  adjournment  of  the  meeting  of  the  outgoing  Board  of 
Commissioners  held  at 
the  member’s 
the  annual  meeting 
appointment.    In  the  event  that  a  commissioner  appointed  by  the  Supreme 
Court is not appointed before the adjournment of the annual meeting at which 
time  he  or  she  would  ordinarily  take  office,  that  member  shall  begin  to  serve 
immediately  upon  appointment.    Except  where  appointment  is  made  under 
Section  5,  such  appointed  commissioner  shall  be  considered  to  have  been  in 
office at the beginning of the term for which the appointment is made. 

following 

Rules Concerning the State Bar of Michigan

Last Updated 5/1/2022 

(3)  The  chairperson-elect,  the  chairperson  and  the  immediate  past  chairperson 
of the State Bar young lawyers section, each serving for the years during which 
they hold those positions. 

(4)  The  chairperson,  vice-chairperson,  and  clerk  of  the  assembly,  each  serving 
for the years during which they hold those positions.  

Section 3.  Election Districts; Apportionment.  

The  board  shall  establish  commissioner  election  districts  consisting  of  contiguous 
judicial  circuits  and  containing,  as  nearly  as  practicable,  an  equal  lawyer 
population.    The  largest  geographic  area  may  have  the  highest  deviation  from 
population equality. 

The board shall review and revise election districts every 6 years.  If, as the result 
of  a  revision  in  election  districts,  no  elected  commissioner  maintains  his  or  her 
principal office in a district or a district has fewer elected commissioners than it is 
entitled  to,  the  board  may  designate  an  elected  commissioner  or  commissioner  at 
large for the district until the next annual election when the vacancy will be filled.  

To  provide  for  an  orderly  transition  and  to  preserve  the  requirement  that 
approximately  one-third  of  the  elected  board  members  are  elected  each  year,  the 
board  may  extend  the  term  of  an  elected  commissioner  for  a  period  not  exceeding 
one year and the authorized membership of the board will be enlarged for the period 
affected.  

An elected commissioner whose district is merged with another district as the result 
of a revision of commissioner election districts may nevertheless serve the full term 
for  which  the  commissioner  was  elected  and  the  authorized  membership  of  the 
board will be temporarily enlarged for that purpose.  

Section 4.  Nomination and Election of Commissioners.  

A  commissioner  is  elected  by  the  active  members  having  their  principal  offices  in 
the  election  district.    To  be  nominated,  a  member  must  have  his  or  her  principal 
office in the election district and file a petition signed by at least 5 persons entitled 
to  vote  for  the  nominee  with  the  secretary  at  the  principal  office  of  the  State  Bar 
between April 1 and April 30.  Voting eligibility is determined annually on May 1.  
Before June 2, the secretary shall mail or electronically deliver a ballot to everyone

The  board  shall  fill  a  vacancy  among  the  elected  commissioners  and  the  Supreme 
Court  shall  fill  a  vacancy  among  the  appointed  commissioners,  to  serve  the 
remainder  of  an  unexpired  term.    If  an  elected  commissioner  moves  his  or  her 
principal  office  out  of  his  or  her  election  district,  the  board  shall  declare  that  a 
vacancy  exists.    If  an  elected  or  appointed  commissioner  does  not  attend  two 
consecutive meetings of the board without being excused by the president because of 
a  personal  or  professional  emergency,  the  president  shall  declare  that  a  vacancy 
exists.  

Section 6.  Meetings.  

The  board  shall  meet  during  the  annual  meeting  of  the  State  Bar  and  before  the 
convening of the assembly and shall hold not less than 4 meetings each year.  The

By order dated May 10, 2005, this Court adopted the amendments of Rules 2, 5, and 
6  of  the  Rules  Concerning  the  State  Bar  of  Michigan  with  immediate  effect.  472 
Mich cxii-cxv (2005).  Notice and an opportunity for comment at the September 29, 
2005,  public  hearing  having  been  provided,  and  consideration  having  been  given, 
the  amendments  of  Rules  2,  5,  and  6  of  the  Rules  Concerning  the  State  Bar  of

Last Updated 5/1/2022 

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  this  section,  all  representatives  previously 
appointed  by  the  Supreme  Court  shall  serve  until  the  end  of  their  terms.    The 
provisions of Section 6 with regard to the declaration of a vacancy shall also apply, 
where  applicable,  to  the  remaining  appointed  representatives.    Vacancies  in 
appointed  positions  shall  not  be  filled.    In  order  to  achieve  the  increase  in  the 
number  of  elected  representatives  from  130  to  142,  the  assembly  shall  allocate 
additional seats each year as necessary to replace former appointed representatives 
whose terms expire or whose seats have become vacant. 

Section 3.  Election Districts; Apportionment. 

The  assembly  shall  apportion  the  representatives  every  6  years.    The  judicial 
circuits  are  the  election  districts.    Each  judicial  circuit  is  entitled  to  one 
representative.    The  remaining  seats  are  to  be  apportioned  among  the  circuits  on 
the  basis  of  lawyer  population,  determined  on  February  1  of  the  reapportionment 
year.    If  as  a  result  of  the  reapportionment  any  circuit  becomes  entitled  to  fewer 
representatives than are currently elected therefrom, the assembly representatives 
from that circuit may nevertheless serve the full terms for which they were elected 
and  the  authorized  membership  of  the  assembly  will  be  temporarily  enlarged  for 
that purpose. 

Section 4.  Nomination and Election of Representatives.  

A representative is elected by the active members having their principal offices in a 
judicial circuit.  To be nominated, a member must have his or her principal office in 
the judicial circuit and file a petition signed by at least 5 persons entitled to vote for 
the  nominee  with  the  secretary  at  the  principal  office  of  the  State  Bar  between 
April 1  and  April  30.    Voting  eligibility  is  determined  annually  on  May  1.    Before 
June 2, the secretary shall mail or electronically deliver a ballot to everyone entitled 
to vote.  When an assembly member seeks reelection, the election notification must 
disclose his or her incumbency and the number of meetings of the assembly that the 
incumbent has attended in the following form: “has attended ____ of ____ meetings 
during the period of [his or her] incumbency.”  A ballot may not be counted unless 
marked  and  returned  to  the  secretary  at  the  principal  office  of  the  State  Bar  in  a 
sealed  envelope  bearing  a  postmark  date  not  later  than  June  15,  or  returned 
electronically or telephonically in conformity with State Bar election procedure not 
later than June 15.  A board of tellers appointed by the president shall canvass the 
ballots  and  the  secretary  shall  certify  the  count  to  the  supreme  court  clerk.    A 
member  of  or  candidate  for  the  assembly  may  not  be  a  teller.    The  candidate 
receiving the highest number of votes will be declared elected.  In the case of a tie 
vote,  the  tellers  shall  determine  the  successful  candidate  by  lot.    An  election  will 
occur in each judicial circuit every 3 years, except that in a judicial circuit entitled 
to  3  or  more  representatives,  one-third  will  be  elected  each  year.    If  a  short-term 
representative is to be elected at the same election as a full-term one, the member 
with the higher vote total is elected to the longer term.

Section 5.  Terms.  

An  elected  representative  shall  serve  a  three-year  term  beginning  with  the 
adjournment of the annual meeting following the representative’s election and until 
his  or  her  successor  is  elected.    A  representative  may  not  continue  to  serve  after 
completing  two  successive  three-year  terms  unless  service  is  extended  under  the 
provisions of Rule 7, Section 2.2 

Section 6.  Vacancy.  

If  an  elected  representative  ceases  to  be  a  member  of  the  State  Bar  of  Michigan, 
dies  during  his  or  her  term  of  office,  moves  his  or  her  principal  office  out  of  the 
judicial circuit he or she represents, or submits a written resignation acceptable to 
the  chairperson,  the  chairperson  shall  declare  that  a  vacancy  exists.   If  an  elected 
representative  does  not  attend  two  consecutive  meetings  of  the  assembly  without 
being excused by the chairperson because  of a personal or professional emergency, 
or  does  not  attend  three  consecutive  meetings  of  the  assembly  for  any  reason  or 
reasons, the chairperson shall declare that a vacancy exists. 

When  a  vacancy  exists,  the  remaining  representatives  from  the  affected  judicial 
circuit  or,  if  there  are  none,  the  State  Bar-recognized  local  bar  associations  in  the 
affected judicial circuit, shall nominate a successor prior to the next meeting of the 
assembly.    The  assembly  may  appoint  such  nominee  or,  in  the  event  of  failure  to 
receive  such  nomination,  any  lawyer  from  the  affected  judicial  circuit,  to  fill  the 
vacancy,  effective  immediately  upon  such  appointment  and  continuing  until  the 
position is filled by the election process. 

In  the  event  that  at  the  time  a vacancy arises  under  this  rule more  than  eighteen 
months remain in the term of an elected representative, there will be an election for 
the unexpired term at the next annual election of representatives.  If there are less 
than  eighteen  months  remaining  in  the  term  of  an  elected  representative  when  a 
vacancy  arises,  no  interim  election  will  be  held.    The  interim  appointment  ends 
when the secretary certifies the election count, and the person elected shall take his 
or her seat immediately. 

Section 7.  Meetings.  

The assembly shall meet:  

(1) during the annual meeting of the State Bar; 

(2) annually in March or April; and 

(3) at any other time and place it determines. 

A  special  meeting  may  be  called  by  the  Board  of  Commissioners,  or  by  the 
chairperson and clerk, who shall determine the time and place of such meeting.  A 
special  meeting  must  be  called  by  the  chairperson  on  the  written  request  of  a 
quorum of the Representative Assembly.  Fifty members constitute a quorum.  The 
chairperson  of  the  assembly  presides  at  all  of  its  meetings.    The  assembly  may 
adopt rules and procedures for the transaction of its business not inconsistent with 

Rules Concerning the State Bar of Michigan

these rules or the bylaws of the State Bar.  A section chairperson is entitled to floor 
privileges  without  a  vote  when  the  assembly  considers  a  matter  falling  within  the 
section’s jurisdiction. 

Section 8.  Voting.  

Each  member  of  the  assembly  may  cast  only  one  vote.    Voting  by  proxy  is  not 
permitted. 

By order dated May 10, 2005, this Court adopted the amendments of Rules 2, 5, and 
6  of  the  Rules  Concerning  the  State  Bar  of  Michigan  with  immediate  effect.  472 
Mich cxii-cxv (2005).  Notice and an opportunity for comment at the September 29, 
2005,  public  hearing  having  been  provided,  and  consideration  having  been  given, 
the  amendments  of  Rules  2,  5,  and  6  of  the  Rules  Concerning  the  State  Bar  of 
Michigan are retained. 

Rule 7.  Officers. 

Section 1.  President, President-elect, Vice-president, Secretary, and Treasurer. 

The  officers  of  the  Board  of  Commissioners  of  the  State  Bar  of  Michigan  are  the 
president,  the  president-elect,  the  vice-president,  the  secretary,  and  the  treasurer.  
The  officers  serve  for  the  year  beginning  with  the  adjournment  of  the  annual 
meeting  following  their  election  and  ending  with  the  adjournment  of  the  next 
annual meeting.  A person may serve as president only once. 

After  the  election  of  board  members  but  before  the  annual  meeting  each  year,  the 
Board  of  Commissioners  shall  elect  from  among  its  members,  by  majority  vote  of 
those present and voting, if a quorum is present: 

(1) a vice-president who, after serving a one-year term, automatically succeeds 
to  the  office  of  president-elect  for  a  one-year  term,  and  then  to  the  office  of 
president, for a one-year term; 

(2) a secretary; and 

(3) a treasurer. 

If a vice-president is  not able to assume the duties of president-elect, the Board of 
Commissioners  also  shall  elect  from  among  its  members, by  majority  vote  of  those 
present and voting, if a quorum is present, a president-elect who becomes president 
on the adjournment of the next succeeding annual meeting.  

A  commissioner  whose  term  expires  at  the  next  annual  meeting  is  not  eligible  for 
election as an officer unless the commissioner has been reelected or reappointed for 
another term as a commissioner.  If the remaining term of a commissioner elected 
treasurer,  secretary,  vice-president,  or  president-elect  will  expire  before  the 
commissioner  completes  a  term  as  president,  the  term  shall  be  extended  for  an 
additional  year  or  years  to  allow  the  commissioner  to  serve  consecutive  terms  in 
each  successive  office  through  the  completion  of  the  commissioner’s  term  as 
president, provided that the commissioner is elected by the Board of Commissioners 

Rules Concerning the State Bar of Michigan 

12 

Last Updated 5/1/2022 

to  serve  in  each  successive  office.    If  the  term  of  an  elected  commissioner  is  so 
extended,  the  authorized  membership  of  the  board  is  increased  by  one  for  that 
period;  a  vacancy  in  the  district  the  treasurer,  secretary,  vice-president,  or 
president-elect represents exists when the term as a commissioner would normally 
expire, and an election to choose a successor is to be held in the usual manner.  

No person holding judicial office may be elected or appointed an officer of the Board 
of Commissioners.  A judge presently serving as an officer may complete that term 
but  may  not  thereafter,  while  holding  judicial  office,  be  elected  or  appointed  an 
officer.    A  person  serving  as  an  officer  who,  after  the  effective  date  of  this 
amendment, is elected or appointed to a judicial office, must resign as an officer of 
the board on or before the date that person assumes judicial office. 

Section 2.  Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, and Clerk of the Assembly.  

A  clerk  of  the  Representative  Assembly  chosen  from  the  elected  or  appointed 
membership  of  the  assembly  must  be  elected  by  the  assembly  at  each  annual 
meeting by majority vote of those present and voting, if there is a quorum present.  
The  clerk  serves  a  one-year  term  beginning  with  the  adjournment  of  the  annual 
meeting at which he or she is elected and ending with the adjournment of the next 
annual  meeting  at  which  he  or  she  becomes  vice-chairperson  for  a  one-year  term 
concluding  with  the  next  annual  meeting,  at  which  time  he  or  she  becomes 
chairperson  for  a  one-year  term  concluding  with  the  next  annual  meeting.    If  a 
representative is elected clerk of the assembly with only one or two years of his or 
her  term  remaining,  the  term  of  the  representative  is  extended  for  an  additional 
year  or  years  to  permit  him  or  her  to  serve  consecutive  terms  as  vice-chairperson, 
and  chairperson.    If  the  term  of  an  elected  representative  is  so  extended,  the 
authorized  membership  of  the  assembly  is  increased  by  one  for  the  appropriate 
period;  a  vacancy  in  the  judicial  circuit  the  chairperson-elect  or  chairperson 
represents  exists  when  his  or  her  term  would  normally  expire  and  an  election 
conducted to choose a successor having the vote to which the representative for that 
judicial circuit is entitled is to be held in the usual manner.  Assembly officers may 
not concurrently hold another State Bar office and may not be reelected as assembly 
officers. 

No  person  holding  judicial  office  may  be  elected  or  appointed  an  officer  of  the 
Representative  Assembly.    A  judge  presently  serving  as  an  officer  may  complete 
that  term  but  may  not  thereafter,  while  holding  judicial  office,  be  elected  or 
appointed an officer.  A person serving as an officer who, after the effective date of 
this amendment, is elected or appointed to a judicial office, must resign as an officer 
of the assembly on or before the date that person assumes judicial office. 

Section 3.  Duties.  

The  president  shall  preside  at  all  State  Bar  meetings  and  at  all  meetings  of  the 
Board of Commissioners and perform other duties that are usually incident to that 
office.

elect, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer. 

The chairperson of the Representative Assembly shall preside at all of its meetings 
and perform the other duties usually incident to that office, together with additional 
duties  the  assembly  may  assign.    The  vice-chairperson  shall  perform  duties 
assigned  by  the  chairperson  or  as  the  assembly  may  assign.    The  clerk  of  the 
assembly  shall  act  as  secretary  of  the  assembly  and  perform  the  other  duties  the 
assembly  assigns.    If  the  chairperson  is  unable  to  perform  his  or  her  duties  or  is 
absent  from  a  meeting  of  the  assembly,  the  vice-chairperson  shall  perform  the 
chairperson’s duties while the disability or absence continues. 

Section 4.  Vacancies.  

If any office other than that of president or chairperson or vice-chairperson or clerk 
of the Representative Assembly becomes vacant, the Board of Commissioners shall 
fill the office for the unexpired term.  If the office of president becomes vacant, the 
president-elect  becomes  president  for  the  unexpired  term,  and  may  continue  as 
president at the adjournment of the next annual meeting.  If the office of president 
becomes  vacant  when  the  office  of  president-elect  is  also  vacant,  the  Board  of 
Commissioners  shall  fill  both  vacancies  for  the  unexpired  term.    If  the  office  of 
chairperson  of  the  Representative  Assembly  becomes  vacant,  the  vice-chairperson 
becomes  chairperson  for  the  unexpired  term,  and  may  continue  as  chairperson  at 
the  adjournment  of  the  next  annual  meeting.    If  the  office  of  chairperson  becomes 
vacant when the office of vice-chairperson or clerk is also vacant, the assembly shall 
fill  all  vacancies  for  the  unexpired  term  at  its  next  meeting;  the  secretary  shall 
convene and preside at the meeting until successors are elected. 

Rule 8.  Executive Director. 

The  Board  of  Commissioners  may  appoint  an  Executive  Director,  and  such 
assistants, who shall serve on a full-time or part-time basis during such period and

all times be subject to removal by the board with or without cause.  The Executive 
Director shall perform such duties as the Board of Commissioners may from time to 
time  prescribe.    The  Executive  Director  shall  have  the  privilege  of  the  floor  at  all 
meetings of the Board of Commissioners, Representative Assembly, sections, section 
councils, committees, or subcommittees, without vote.  

Rule 9.  Disbursements. 

The  Board  of  Commissioners  shall  make  the  necessary  appropriations  for 
disbursements from the funds of the treasury to pay the necessary expenses of the 
State Bar of Michigan, its officers, and committees.  It shall be the duty of the board 
to cause proper books of account to be kept and to have them audited annually by a 
certified  public  accountant.    On  or  before  December  31  each  year  the  board  shall 
cause  to  be  presented  an  audited  financial  statement  of  the  receipts  and 
expenditures  of  the  State  Bar  of  Michigan for  the  fiscal  year  ending  the  preceding 
September 30.  Such a statement shall also be filed with the Clerk of the Supreme

No  officer,  member  of  the  Board  of  Commissioners,  member  of  the  Representative 
Assembly,  or  member  of  a  committee  or  section  of  the State  Bar  of  Michigan  shall 
receive  compensation  for  services  rendered  in  connection  with  the  performance  of 
his  or  her  duties.    They  may,  however,  be  reimbursed  for  the  necessary  expenses 
incurred in connection with the performance of their duties.

(5) State Bar recommendations concerning the character and fitness of an applicant 
for  admission  to  the  bar  shall  be  transmitted  to  the  Board  of  Law  Examiners  in 
accordance with the following procedure: 

(a)  An  applicant  shall  be  recommended  favorably  by  State  Bar  staff  without 
referral  to  committee  when  investigation  of  all  past  conduct  discloses  no 
significant adverse factual information.  

(b) In all other instances, applicants shall be referred to the appropriate district 
committee for personal interview unless the chairperson or other member of the 
standing committee designated by the chairperson determines that any adverse 
information  reflected  in  the  file  would  under  no  circumstance  justify  a 
committee determination that the applicant does not possess the character and 
fitness  requisite  for  admission,  in  which  event  the  application  shall  be 
transmitted to the Board of Law Examiners with a favorable recommendation.  

(c)  District  committees  shall,  under  the  supervision  and  direction  of  the 
standing  committee, 
investigate  the  character  and  fitness  (other  than 
scholastic)  of  every  applicant  referred  to  them.    They  shall  do  so  by  informal 
interview  and  any  additional  investigation  which  to  them  seems  appropriate.

cases.    An  applicant  is  entitled  to  use  the  committee’s  subpoena  power  to  obtain

district  committee  or  the  standing  committee,  or,  if  following  such  an  adverse 
recommendation  the  applicant  fails  to  appear  for  further  proceedings  or  takes  no 
further  action,  the  standing  committee  shall  notify  the  applicant  that  the 
application for admission to the bar may not be renewed until the expiration of two
