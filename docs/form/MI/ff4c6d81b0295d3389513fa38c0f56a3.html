      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre>If the judgment debtor is not present at the

 
trial, the court will send a copy of the small
claims judgment to the judgment debtor. The
judgment will order the judgment debtor to pay
you in full within 30 days or to tell you and the
court where the judgment debtor works and the
location of his/her bank accounts.

  3. If the judgment debtor doesn’t pay the
judgment  as  ordered,  you  can  collect  your 
money  through  proceedings  to  seize  property 
or to garnish income of the judgment debtor.

What is Seizure of Property?
  Seizure of property is a court procedure that 
allows a court officer to seize property belonging
to the judgment debtor that can be sold to pay
the money owed to you. To file a request to
seize property, use form MC 19, Request and
Order to Seize Property.

What is Garnishment?
  Garnishment is a court procedure that allows
you to collect the money owed to you by taking
in from the judgment debtor’s wages, bank
account, or another source (such as income tax
refunds). To file a garnishment, contact the
court clerk for the proper forms. Instructions
are provided with the form.

• If you already have the information
 
described above, you can start the process
for an order to seize property or for
garnishment.

 
•  If  you  don’t  have  the  information  described 
above,  you  can  order  the  judgment  debtor  to 
appear in court for questioning through a process 
called  discovery.  You  can  start  this  process  by 
filing a discovery subpoena.

How to File a Discovery Subpoena
  You must wait 21 days after your small
claims judgment was signed before you can
file a discovery subpoena. Use form MC 11,
Subpoena (Order to Appear and/or Produce).

  Be sure to contact the court to set an
appearance date and then put that date and
location on the form. Complete the front of 
the Subpoena form and the “Affidavit for 
Judgment Debtor Examination” on the back
of the form. The judge must sign the 
Subpoena before it becomes effective. After
the Subpoena is signed, you must serve it
on the judgment debtor.

  The fee for filing the Subpoena with the 
court varies. The cost of serving it also varies.

COLLECTING YOUR MONEY FROM
           A SMALL CLAIMS JUDGMENT

 
If you receive a money judgment through a
lawsuit, you have the right to collect the money 
by the means allowed by law.

How Much can I Collect?
  You can collect the amount stated in your
small claims judgment (form DC 85) plus any
interest that accumulates during the time the
other party pays off the judgment.

How can I Collect my Money?
  There are several ways to collect your 
money.

  1. If the party who lost the lawsuit (called a
judgment debtor) has the money and is present
at the trial, s/he can pay you (called a judgment 
creditor) right then.

  2. If the judgment debtor does not have the
money at that time, the judge can set up a
payment schedule.

How do I get an Order to Seize Property
or a Garnishment?
  To get an order to seize property or for
garnishment, you must know where the
judgment  debtor  lives  and  works,  what  assets 
s/he has and where these assets are located, 
and  any  other  information  that  identifies  the 
judgment debtor and his/her property.

How to File a Request to Seize Property
  You must wait 21 days after your small
claims judgment was signed before you can
get an order to seize property. Use form
MC  19,  Request  and  Order  to  Seize  Property, 
to  start  the  process.  Complete  the  “Request” 
portion of form MC 19 and file it with the court.

The filing fee varies. The court will issue the
order by signing the form, and it will be executed
(property seized) by a sheriff or court officer.

  When do I get my Money from Seized
Property?  Once  property  is  seized  and  sold, 
the  money  will  be  given  to  you. The  sheriff  or 
court  officer  is  entitled  to  fees,  which  will  be 
deducted from the sale of the property.

How to File a Request for Garnishment
  You must wait 21 days after your small
claims judgment was signed before you can
get a garnishment. There are three types of
garnishment: 1) periodic, 2) nonperiodic, and
3) income tax intercept. Use the appropriate
form MC 12, MC 13 or MC 52, Request and
Writ for Garnishment, to start the garnishment
process.

  A periodic writ of garnishment (form MC 12)
is used to garnish the judgment debtor’s
wages, rent payments, land contract payments,
or other debt that is paid to the judgment debtor
on a periodic basis. A periodic garnishment is
valid until the expiration date on the writ or until 
the judgment, interest, and costs are paid off,
whichever occurs first.

  A nonperiodic writ of garnishment
(form MC 13) is used to garnish the judgment
debtor’s bank account or other property. Once
money has been garnished under the
nonperiodic writ, the writ is no longer valid. If
there  is  a  remaining  balance  due  on  the 
judgment, you must get another writ to collect
more money.

  An income tax writ of garnishment (form
MC  52)  is  used  to  intercept  the  judgment 
debtor’s income tax refund. Once the tax refund
has been intercepted by the Department of
Treasury, the writ is no longer valid. If there is a
remaining  balance  due  on  the  judgment,  you 
must get another writ to collect more money.

  Write or type in the names and addresses
of the defendant (judgment debtor) and the
garnishee on the “Request” part of the form.
The garnishee is the person or business who
has control or possession of the judgment
debtor’s money. After you complete the
“Request,” you must file it with the district court
that entered your small claims judgment. The
filing fee is $15.

  The court will issue the “Writ” (order) by
signing the form. The Request and Writ for
Garnishment must be served on the garnishee
along with the Garnishee Disclosure, form MC
14. There is a $6 disclosure fee for a garnishment
of periodic payments and income tax refund.
The cost of serving the writ varies.

  When  do  I  get  my  Money  from  the 
Garnishment?  The  garnishee  has  14  days 
after  the  writ  is  served  to  let  you,  the  court, 
and the judgment debtor know if any money is 
available for garnishment. This information will 
be provided on the Garnishee Disclosure, form
MC 14. If you are trying to garnish the judgment
debtor’s wages, you will only receive part of the
wages, calculated by using a federal formula.
 
If money is available, it will be withheld from
the judgment debtor right away. However, this

money will be held for 28 days to allow the
judgment debtor time to object. If the judgment
debtor files no objections with the court, the
withheld money will be automatically sent to you
after 28 days. If the garnishment is for periodic
payments, money will continue to be sent to you
as payments become due to the judgment debtor
until the writ expires.

What Else can I do?
 
If your case against the judgment debtor
involved a traffic accident, you can ask the
court for an abstract of judgment, which would
suspend the judgment debtor’s Michigan driver’s
license until s/he pays the judgment. You must
wait 30 days after the date of judgment until you
can get an abstract of judgment. You need to
provide the judgment debtor’s full name, date of
birth, and Michigan driver’s license number.
There is no filing fee. The court clerk should
have the necessary forms.
