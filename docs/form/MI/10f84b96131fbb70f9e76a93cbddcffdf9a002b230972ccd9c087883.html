 See separate instructions. ŁIT IS ORDERED: INSTRUCTIONSDefinitionsŁA periodic garnishment lets the plaintiff (creditor) take money from a source that pays you on a regular basis such as yourearnings or income from rental properties. ŁA "garnishee" is a person who has control over some or all of the money that is paid to the defendant. For example, an
 employer could be a garnishee. ŁPeriodic payments are payments made by the garnishee to the defendant on a regular basis. These payments could be
 paychecks, rent payments, land contract payments, or other contract payments. Instructions for the Plaintiff for Item 2: 
 If a civil judgment does not include judgment interest in the "total judgment" field, the interest amount reported in item 2 should beaccrued from the date the complaint was filed. If a civil judgment includes judgment interest in the ﬁtotal judgmentﬂ field (as in the forms in use before the 5/07 revisions) 
 , the interestamount reported in item 2 should not include any postfiling interest already included in the judgment. Instructions for the Defendant: 1. This writ has been issued because there is a judgment against you that you have not paid. In order to collect on this judgm
 ent, income to be paid to you may be garnished. 2. You may object to this garnishment if: 
 a. your income is exempt from garnishment by law (see examples below) , 
 
 b. you have a pending bankruptcy proceeding, 
 
 c. the maximum withheld exceeds the amount allowed by law, 
 
 d. you have an installment payment order, 
 
 e. you have paid the judgment in full, 
 
 f. the garnishment was not properly issued or is otherwise invalid, 
 
 g. you believe the balance on the statement the creditor sent to you is wrong. 
 3. Certain income is exempt from garnishment and the law gives you the right to claim this income as exempt to prevent it from
 being used to collect on this judgment. You may want to contact your lawyer or legal aid agency for further assistance. 4. You may send the plaintiff a written request to review postjudgment costs and fees listed in item 2 of the request. Within 2
 8 days after receiving your request, the plaintiff must send an itemized list of the postjudgment costs and fees to you and the court. Within 28 days after receiving the itemized list, you may file a motion with the court to review the postjudgment costs and fee
 sif you believe they are wrong. If the judge rules in your favor, the judge may order the motion fee to be deducted from the judgmentbalance. 5. For more information on garnishments and debt collection, please visit Michigan Legal Help. org.
