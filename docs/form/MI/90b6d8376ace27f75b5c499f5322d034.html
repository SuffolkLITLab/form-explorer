MICHIGAN RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT 

RULE 1.0.  SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY 

Rule 1.0.  Scope and Applicability of Rules and Commentary 

(a) These are the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct.  The form of citation for 
this rule is MRPC 1.0.  

(b) Failure to comply with an obligation or prohibition imposed by a rule is a basis 
for invoking the disciplinary process.  The rules do not, however, give rise to a cause 
of action for enforcement of a rule or for damages caused by failure to comply with 
an  obligation  or  prohibition  imposed  by  a  rule.    In  a  civil  or  criminal  action,  the 
admissibility  of  the  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  is  governed  by  the  Michigan 
Rules of Evidence and other provisions of law.  

(c) The text of each rule is authoritative.  The comment that accompanies each rule 
does  not  expand  or  limit  the  scope  of  the  obligations,  prohibitions,  and  counsel 
found in the text of the rule.  

Comment: 

The  rules  and  comments  were  largely  drawn  from  the  American  Bar  Association’s 
Model  Rules  of Professional  Conduct.   Prior  to  submission  of  those  Model  Rules  to 
the Michigan Supreme Court, the State Bar of Michigan made minor changes in the 
rules  and  the  comments  to  conform  them  to  Michigan  law  and  preferred  practice.  
The  Supreme  Court  then  adopted  the  rules,  with  such  substantive  changes  as 
appeared proper to the Court.  Additional changes in the comments were then made 
by  staff  to  conform  the  comments  to  the  rules  as  adopted  by  the  Supreme  Court.  
The  Supreme  Court  has  authorized  publication  of  the  comments  as  an  aid  to  the 
reader, but the rules alone comprise the Supreme Court’s authoritative statement of 
a lawyer’s ethical obligations. 

Preamble: A Lawyer’s Responsibilities 

This  preamble  is  part  of  the  comment  to  Rule  1.0,  and  provides  a  general 
introduction to the Rules of Professional Conduct.  

A  lawyer  is  a  representative  of  clients,  an  officer  of  the  legal  system  and  a  public 
citizen having special responsibility for the quality of justice.  

As  a  representative  of  clients,  a  lawyer  performs  various  functions.    As  advisor,  a 
lawyer provides a client with an informed understanding of the client’s legal rights 
and  obligations  and  explains  their  practical  implications.    As  advocate,  a  lawyer 
zealously asserts the  client’s position under the rules of the adversary system.  As 
negotiator,  a  lawyer  seeks  a  result  advantageous  to  the  client  but  consistent  with 
requirements  of  honest  dealing  with  others.    As  intermediary  between  clients,  a 
lawyer  seeks  to  reconcile  their  divergent  interests  as  an  advisor  and,  to  a  limited

extent, as a spokesperson for each client.  A lawyer acts as evaluator by examining 
a client’s legal affairs and reporting about them to the client or to others.  

In all professional functions a lawyer should be competent, prompt and diligent.  A 
lawyer should maintain communication with a client concerning the representation.  
A lawyer should keep in confidence information relating to representation of a client 
except  so  far  as  disclosure  is  required  or  permitted  by  the  Rules  of  Professional 
Conduct or other law.  

A  lawyer’s  conduct  should  conform  to  the  requirements  of  the  law,  both  in 
professional service to clients and in the lawyer’s business and personal affairs.  A 
lawyer  should  use  the  law’s  procedures  only  for  legitimate  purposes  and  not  to 
harass  or  intimidate  others.    A  lawyer  should  demonstrate  respect  for  the  legal 
system  and  for  those  who  serve  it,  including  judges,  other  lawyers  and  public 
officials.  While it is a lawyer’s duty, when necessary, to challenge the rectitude of 
official action, it is also a lawyer’s duty to uphold legal process.  

As  a  public  citizen,  a  lawyer  should  seek  improvement  of  the  law,  the 
administration of justice and the quality of service rendered by the legal profession.  
As a member of a learned profession, a lawyer should cultivate knowledge of the law 
beyond its use for clients, employ that knowledge in reform of the law and work to 
strengthen  legal  education.    A  lawyer  should  be  mindful  of  deficiencies  in  the 
administration of justice and of the fact that the poor, and sometimes persons who 
are  not  poor,  cannot  afford  adequate  legal  assistance,  and  should  therefore  devote 
professional time and civic influence in their behalf.  A lawyer should aid the legal 
profession in pursuing these objectives and should help the bar regulate itself in the 
public interest.  

Many  of  a  lawyer’s  professional  responsibilities  are  prescribed  in  the  Rules  of 
Professional  Conduct,  as  well  as  substantive  and  procedural  law.    However,  a 
lawyer  is  also  guided  by  personal  conscience  and  the  approbation  of  professional 
peers.  A lawyer should strive to attain the highest level of skill, to improve the law 
and  the  legal  profession  and  to  exemplify  the  legal  profession’s  ideals  of  public 
service.  

A  lawyer’s  responsibilities  as  a  representative  of  clients,  an  officer  of  the  legal 
system, and a public citizen are usually harmonious.  Thus, when an opposing party 
is well represented, a lawyer can be a zealous advocate on behalf of a client and at 
the same time assume that justice is being done.  So also, a lawyer can be sure that 
preserving  client  confidences  ordinarily  serves  the  public  interest  because  people 
are more likely to seek legal advice, and thereby heed their legal obligations, when 
they know their communications will be private.  

In the nature of law practice, however, conflicting responsibilities are encountered.  
Virtually  all  difficult  ethical  problems  arise  from  conflict  between  a  lawyer’s 
responsibilities  to  clients,  to  the  legal  system,  and  to  the  lawyer’s  own  interest  in 
remaining  an  upright  person  while  earning  a  satisfactory  living.    The  Rules  of 
Professional  Conduct  prescribe  terms  for  resolving  such  conflicts.    Within  the 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

framework  of  these  rules  many  difficult issues  of  professional  discretion  can  arise.  
Such  issues  must  be  resolved  through  the  exercise  of  sensitive  professional  and 
moral judgment guided by the basic principles underlying the rules.  

The legal profession is largely self-governing.  Although other professions also have 
been  granted  powers  of  self-government,  the  legal  profession  is  unique  in  this 
respect because of the close relationship between the profession and the processes of 
government  and  law  enforcement.    This  connection  is  manifested  in  the  fact  that 
ultimate authority over the legal profession is vested largely in the courts.  

To  the  extent  that  lawyers  meet  the  obligations  of  their  professional  calling,  the 
occasion for government regulation is obviated.  Self-regulation also helps maintain 
the legal profession’s  independence from government domination.  An independent 
legal  profession  is  an  important  force  in  preserving  government  under  law,  for 
abuse of legal authority is more readily challenged by a profession whose members 
are not dependent on government for the right to practice.  

The  legal  profession’s  relative  autonomy  carries  with  it  special  responsibilities  of 
self-government.  The profession has a responsibility to assure that its regulations 
are  conceived  in  the  public  interest  and  not  in  furtherance  of  parochial  or  self-
interested  concerns  of  the  bar.    Every  lawyer  is  responsible  for  observance  of  the 
Rules  of  Professional  Conduct.    A  lawyer  should  also  aid  in  securing  their 
observance  by  other  lawyers.    Neglect  of  these  responsibilities  compromises  the 
independence of the profession and the public interest which it serves.  

Lawyers play a vital role in the preservation of society.  The fulfillment of this role 
requires an understanding by lawyers of their relationship to our legal system.  The 
Rules  of  Professional  Conduct,  when  properly  applied,  serve  to  define  that 
relationship.  

Scope 

The Rules of Professional Conduct are rules of reason.  They should be interpreted 
with reference to the purposes of legal representation and of the law itself.  Some of 
the  rules  are  imperatives,  cast  in  the  terms  “shall”  or  “shall  not.”    These  define 
proper conduct for purposes of professional discipline.  Others, generally cast in the 
term  “may,”  are  permissive  and  define  areas  under  the  rules  in  which  the  lawyer 
has professional discretion.  No disciplinary action should be taken when the lawyer 
acts or chooses not to act within the bounds of such discretion.  Other rules define 
the  nature  of  relationships  between  the  lawyer  and  others.    The  rules  are  thus 
partly  obligatory  and  disciplinary  and  partly  constitutive  and  descriptive  in  that 
they  define  a  lawyer’s  professional  role.    Many  of  the  comments  use  the  term 
“should.”    Comments  do  not  add  obligations  to  the  rules,  but  provide  guidance  for 
practicing in compliance with the rules.  

The rules presuppose a larger legal context shaping the lawyer’s role.  That context 
includes  court  rules  and  statutes  relating  to  matters  of  licensure,  laws  defining 
specific  obligations  of  lawyers,  and  substantive  and  procedural  law  in  general.  

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

Compliance  with  the  rules,  as  with  all  law  in  an  open  society,  depends  primarily 
upon  understanding  and  voluntary  compliance,  secondarily  upon  reinforcement  by 
peer  and  public  opinion,  and  finally,  when  necessary,  upon  enforcement  through 
disciplinary proceedings.  The rules do not, however, exhaust the moral and ethical 
considerations  that  should  inform  a  lawyer,  for  no  worthwhile  human  activity  can 
be completely defined by legal rules.  The rules simply provide a framework for the 
ethical practice of law.  

Furthermore, for purposes of determining the lawyer’s authority and responsibility, 
principles  of  substantive  law  external  to  these  rules  determine  whether  a  client-
lawyer  relationship  exists.    Most  of  the  duties  flowing  from  the  client-lawyer 
relationship  attach  only  after  the  client  has  requested  the  lawyer  to  render  legal 
services and the lawyer has agreed to do so.  But there are some duties, such as that 
of  confidentiality  under  Rule  1.6,  that  may  attach  when  the  lawyer  agrees  to 
consider  whether  a  client-lawyer  relationship  shall  be  established.    Whether  a 
client-lawyer  relationship  exists  for  any  specific  purpose  can  depend  on  the 
circumstances and may be a question of fact.  

Under various legal provisions, including constitutional, statutory and common-law, 
the  responsibilities  of  government  lawyers  may  include  authority  concerning  legal 
matters  that  ordinarily  reposes  in  the  client  in  private  client-lawyer  relationships.  
For example, a lawyer for a government agency may have authority on behalf of the 
government  to  decide  upon  settlement  or  whether  to  appeal  from  an  adverse 
judgment.    Such  authority  in  various  respects  is  generally  vested  in  the  attorney 
general  and  the  prosecuting  attorney  in  state  government,  and  their  federal 
counterparts,  and  the  same  may  be  true  of  other  government  law  officers.    Also, 
lawyers  under  the  supervision  of  these  officers  may  be  authorized  to  represent 
several  government  agencies 
in 
circumstances where  a private lawyer could not represent multiple private clients.  
They  also  may  have  authority  to  represent  the  “public  interest”  in  circumstances 
where  a  private  lawyer  would  not  be  authorized  to  do  so.    These  rules  do  not 
abrogate any such authority.  

legal  controversies 

intragovernmental 

in 

As  indicated  earlier  in  this  comment,  a  failure  to  comply  with  an  obligation  or 
prohibition imposed by a rule is a basis for invoking the disciplinary process.  The 
rules presuppose that disciplinary assessment of a lawyer’s conduct will be made on 
the basis of the facts and circumstances as they existed at the time of the conduct in 
question and in recognition of the fact that a lawyer often has to act upon uncertain 
or  incomplete  evidence  of  the  situation.    Moreover,  the  rules  presuppose  that 
whether  or  not  discipline  should  be  imposed  for  a  violation,  and  the  severity  of  a 
sanction, depend on all the circumstances, such as the wilfulness and seriousness of 
the violation, extenuating factors and whether there have been previous violations.  

As also indicated earlier in this comment, a violation of a rule does not give rise to a 
cause  of  action,  nor  does  it  create  any  presumption  that  a  legal  duty  has  been 
breached.    The  rules are  designed  to  provide  guidance  to lawyers  and  to  provide  a 
structure  for  regulating  conduct  through  disciplinary  agencies.    They  are  not

designed to be a basis for civil liability.  Furthermore, the purposes of the rules can 
be  subverted  when  they  are  invoked  by  opposing  parties  as  procedural  weapons.  
The fact that a rule is a just basis for a lawyer’s self-assessment, or for sanctioning 
a  lawyer  under  the  administration  of  a  disciplinary  authority, does  not  imply  that 
an  antagonist  in  a  collateral  proceeding  or  transaction  has  standing  to  seek 
enforcement  of  the  rule.    Accordingly,  nothing  in  the  rules  should  be  deemed  to 
augment  any  substantive 
lawyers  or  the  extradisciplinary 
consequences of violating such a duty.  

legal  duty  of 

Moreover,  these  rules  are  not  intended  to  govern  or  affect  judicial  application  of 
either the client-lawyer or work-product privilege.  Those privileges were developed 
to promote compliance with law and fairness in litigation.  In reliance on the client-
lawyer privilege, clients are entitled to expect that communications within the scope 
of  the  privilege  will  be  protected  against  compelled  disclosure.    The  client-lawyer 
privilege  is  that  of  the  client  and  not  of  the  lawyer.    The  fact  that  in  exceptional 
situations  the  lawyer  under  the  rules  has  a  limited  discretion  to  disclose  a  client 
confidence does not vitiate the proposition that, as a general matter, the client has a 
reasonable expectation that information relating to the client will not be voluntarily 
disclosed  and  that  disclosure  of  such  information  may  be  judicially  compelled  only 
in  accordance  with  recognized  exceptions  to  the  client-lawyer  and  work-product 
privileges.  

The lawyer’s exercise of discretion not to disclose information under Rule 1.6 should 
not  be  subject  to  reexamination.    Permitting  such  reexamination  would  be 
incompatible  with  the  general  policy  of  promoting  compliance  with  law  through 
assurances that communications will be protected against disclosure.  

The  comment  accompanying  each  rule  explains  and  illustrates  the  meaning  and 
purpose  of  the  rule.    The  Preamble  and  this  note  on  scope  provide  general 
orientation.  The comments are intended as guides to interpretation, but the text of 
each rule is authoritative.  

Terminology 

“Belief” or “believes” denotes that the person involved actually supposed the fact in 
question to be true.  A person’s belief may be inferred from circumstances. 

“Confirmed in writing,” when used in reference to the informed consent of a person, 
denotes  informed  consent  that  is  given  in  writing  confirming  an  oral  informed 
consent.  If it is not feasible to obtain or transmit the writing at the time the person 
gives  informed  consent,  then  the  lawyer  must  obtain  or  transmit  it  within  a

RULES 1.1–1.17.  CLIENT-LAWYER RELATIONSHIP 

Rule 1.1.  Competence. 

A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client.  A lawyer shall not: 

(a) handle a legal matter which the lawyer knows or should know that the lawyer is 
not  competent  to  handle,  without  associating  with  a  lawyer  who  is  competent  to 
handle it; 

(b) handle a legal matter without preparation adequate in the circumstances; or 

(c) neglect a legal matter entrusted to the lawyer.

Legal Knowledge and Skill. 

In  determining  whether  a  lawyer  is  able  to  provide  competent  representation  in  a 
particular  matter,  relevant  factors  include  the  relative  complexity  and  specialized 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

nature  of  the  matter,  the  lawyer’s  general  experience,  the  lawyer’s  training  and 
experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to 
give  the  matter,  and  whether  it  is  feasible  to  refer  the  matter  to,  or  associate  or 
consult with, a lawyer of established competence in the field in question.  In many 
instances, the required proficiency is that of a general practitioner.  Expertise in a 
particular field of law may be required in some circumstances.  

A  lawyer  need  not  necessarily  have  special  training  or  prior  experience  to  handle 
legal  problems  of  a  type  with  which  the  lawyer  is  unfamiliar.    A  newly  admitted 
lawyer can be as competent as a practitioner with long experience.  Some important 
legal skills, such as the analysis of precedent, the evaluation of evidence and legal 
drafting,  are  required  in  all  legal  problems.    Perhaps  the  most  fundamental  legal 
skill consists of determining what kind of legal problems a situation may involve, a 
skill  that  necessarily  transcends  any  particular  specialized  knowledge.    A  lawyer 
can  provide  adequate  representation  in  a  wholly  novel  field  through  necessary 
study.  Competent representation can also be provided through the association of a 
lawyer of established competence in the field in question.  

In an emergency, a lawyer may give advice or assistance in a matter in which the 
lawyer does not have the skill ordinarily required where referral to or consultation 
or  association  with  another  lawyer  would  be  impractical.    Even  in  an  emergency, 
however,  assistance  should  be  limited  to  that  reasonably  necessary  in  the 
circumstances,  for  ill-considered  action  under  emergency  conditions  can  jeopardize 
the client’s interest.  

A  lawyer  may  offer  representation  where  the  requisite  level  of  competence  can  be 
achieved  by  reasonable  preparation.    This  applies  as  well  to  a  lawyer  who  is 
appointed as counsel for an unrepresented person.  See also Rule 6.2.  

Thoroughness and Preparation. 

Competent handling of a particular matter includes inquiry into and analysis of the 
factual  and  legal  elements  of  the  problem,  and  use  of  methods  and  procedures 
meeting  the  standards  of  competent  practitioners.    It  also  includes  adequate 
preparation.    The  required  attention  and  preparation  are  determined  in  part  by 
what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more 
elaborate treatment than matters of lesser consequence.  

Maintaining Competence. 

To  maintain  the  requisite  knowledge  and  skill,  a  lawyer  should  engage  in 
continuing  study  and  education,  including  the  knowledge  and  skills  regarding 
existing  and  developing  technology  that  are  reasonably  necessary  to  provide 
competent representation for the client in a particular matter.  If a system of peer 
review  has  been  established,  the  lawyer  should  consider  making  use  of  it  in 
appropriate circumstances.

Rule 1.2.  Scope of Representation. 

(a) A lawyer shall seek the lawful objectives of a client through reasonably available 
means  permitted  by  law  and  these  rules.    A  lawyer  does  not  violate  this  rule  by 
acceding to reasonable requests of opposing counsel that do not prejudice the rights 
of  the  client,  by  being  punctual  in  fulfilling  all  professional  commitments,  or  by 
avoiding  offensive  tactics.    A  lawyer  shall  abide  by  a  client’s  decision  whether  to 
accept  an  offer  of  settlement  or  mediation  evaluation  of  a  matter.    In  a  criminal 
case,  the  lawyer  shall  abide  by  the  client’s  decision,  after  consultation  with  the 
lawyer,  with  respect  to  a  plea  to  be  entered,  whether  to  waive  jury  trial,  and 
whether  the  client  will  testify.    In  representing  a  client,  a  lawyer  may,  where 
permissible,  exercise  professional  judgment  to  waive  or  fail  to  assert  a  right  or 
position of the client.  

(b)  A  lawyer  licensed  to  practice  in  the  State  of  Michigan  may limit  the scope  of  a 
representation,  file  a  limited  appearance  in  a  civil  action,  and  act  as  counsel  of 
record  for  the  limited  purpose  identified  in  that  appearance,  if  the  limitation  is 
reasonable  under  the  circumstances  and  the  client  gives  informed  consent, 
preferably confirmed in writing.  

(1)  A  lawyer  licensed  to  practice  in  the  State  of  Michigan  may  draft  or  partially 
draft pleadings, briefs, and other papers to be filed with the court.  Such assistance 
does  not  require  the signature  or identification  of  the  lawyer, but  does  require  the 
following  statement  on  the  document:  “This  document  was  drafted  or  partially 
drafted with the assistance of a lawyer licensed to practice in the State of Michigan, 
pursuant to Michigan Rule of Professional Conduct 1.2(b).”  

(2)  The  filing  of  such  documents  is  not  and  shall  not  be  deemed  an  appearance  by 
the lawyer in the case.  Any filing prepared pursuant to this rule shall be signed by 
the  party  designated  as  “self-represented”  and  shall  not  be  signed  by  the  lawyer 
who  provided  drafting  preparation  assistance.    Further,  the  lawyer  providing 
document  preparation  assistance  without  entering  a  general  appearance  may  rely 
on  the  client’s  representation  of  the  facts,  unless  the  lawyer  has  reason  to  believe 
that  such  representation  is  false,  seeks  objectives  that  are  inconsistent  with  the 
lawyer’s  obligation  under  the  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct,  or  asserts  claims  or 
defenses pursuant to pleadings or papers that would, if signed by the lawyer, violate 
MCR 1.109, or which are materially insufficient. 

(c) A lawyer shall not counsel a client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct that 
the  lawyer  knows  is  illegal  or  fraudulent,  but  a  lawyer  may  discuss  the  legal 
consequences  of  any  proposed  course  of  conduct  with  a  client  and  may  counsel  or 
assist a client to make a good-faith effort to determine the validity, scope, meaning, 
or application of the law.  

(d) When a lawyer knows that a client expects assistance not permitted by the Rules 
of  Professional  Conduct  or  other  law,  the  lawyer  shall  consult  with  the  client 
regarding the relevant limitations on the lawyer’s conduct.

Comment: 

Scope of Representation. 

Both  the  lawyer  and  the  client  have  authority  and  responsibility  in  the  objectives 
and  means  of  representation.    The  client  has  ultimate  authority  to  determine  the 
purposes to be served by legal representation, within the limits imposed by law and 
the lawyer’s professional obligations.  Within those limits, a client also has a right 
to consult with the lawyer about the means to be used in pursuing those objectives.  
At  the  same  time,  a  lawyer  is  not  required  to  pursue  objectives  or  employ  means 
simply because a client may wish that the lawyer do so.  A clear distinction between 
objectives  and  means  sometimes  cannot  be  drawn,  and  in  many  cases  the  client-
lawyer  relationship  partakes  of  a  joint  undertaking.    In  questions  of  means,  the 
lawyer  should  assume  responsibility  for  technical  and  legal  tactical  issues,  but 
should  defer  to  the  client  regarding  such  questions  as  the  expense  to  be  incurred 
and concern for third persons who might be adversely affected.  

In a case in which the client appears to be suffering mental disability, the lawyer’s 
duty to abide by the client’s decisions is to be guided by reference to Rule 1.14.  

Independence from Client’s Views or Activities. 

Legal representation should not be denied to people who are unable to afford legal 
services  or  whose  cause  is  controversial  or  the  subject  of  popular  disapproval.    By 
the  same  token,  representation  of  a  client, 
including  representation  by 
appointment, does not constitute an endorsement of the client’s political, economic, 
social, or moral views or activities.  

Services Limited in Objectives or Means. 

The  objectives  or  scope  of  services  provided  by  a  lawyer  may  be  limited  by 
agreement  with  the  client  or  by  the  terms  under  which  the  lawyer’s  services  are 
made  available  to  the  client.    For  example,  a  retainer  may  be  for  a  specifically 
defined  purpose.    Representation  provided  through  a  legal-aid  agency  may  be 
subject to limitations on the types of cases the agency handles.  When a lawyer has 
been  retained  by  an  insurer  to  represent  an  insured,  the  representation  may  be 
limited  to  matters  related  to  the  insurance  coverage.    The  terms  upon  which 
representation  is  undertaken  may  exclude  specific  objectives  or  means.    Such 
limitations may exclude objectives or means that the lawyer regards as repugnant 
or imprudent.  

An agreement concerning the scope of representation must accord with the Rules of 
Professional Conduct and other law.  Thus, the client may not be asked to agree to 
representation so limited in scope as to violate Rule 1.1, or to surrender the right to 
terminate the lawyer’s services or the right to settle litigation that the lawyer might 
wish to continue.

Reasonable Under the Circumstances. 

Factors  to  weigh  in  deciding  whether  the  limitation  is  reasonable  under  the 
circumstances  according  to  the  facts  communicated  to  the  attorney  include  the 
apparent  capacity  of  the  person  to  proceed  effectively  with  the  limited  scope 
assistance  given  the  complexity  and  type  of  matter  and  other  self-help  resources 
available.  For example, some self-represented persons may seek objectives that are 
inconsistent with an attorney’s obligation under the Rules of Professional Conduct, 
or assert claims or defenses pursuant to pleadings or motions that would, if signed 
by an attorney, violate MCR 1.109.  Attorneys must be reasonably diligent to ensure 
a  limited  scope  representation  does  not  advance  improper  objectives,  and  the 
commentary should help inform lawyers of these considerations. 

Illegal, Fraudulent and Prohibited Transactions. 

A  lawyer is  required to  give  an  honest  opinion  about the  actual  consequences  that 
appear likely to result from a client’s conduct.  The fact that a client uses advice in a 
course  of  action  that  is  illegal  or  fraudulent  does  not,  of  itself,  make  a  lawyer  a 
party to the course of action.  However, a lawyer may not knowingly assist a client 
in  illegal  or  fraudulent  conduct.   There  is a  critical  distinction between  presenting 
an  analysis  of  legal  aspects  of  questionable  conduct  and  recommending  the  means 
by which an illegal act or fraud might be committed with impunity.  

When the client’s course of action has already begun and is continuing, the lawyer’s 
responsibility  is  especially  delicate.    The  lawyer  is  not  permitted  to  reveal  the 
client’s  wrongdoing,  except  where  permitted  by  Rule  1.6.    However,  the  lawyer  is 
required  to  avoid  furthering  the  purpose,  for  example,  by  suggesting  how  it  might 
be  concealed.    A  lawyer  may  not  continue  assisting  a  client  in  conduct  that  the 
lawyer  originally  supposes  is  legally  proper  but  then  discovers  is  illegal  or 
fraudulent.  Withdrawal from the representation, therefore, may be required.  

Where the client is a fiduciary, the lawyer may be charged with special obligations 
in dealings with a beneficiary.  

Paragraph  (c)  applies  whether  or  not  the  defrauded  party  is  a  party  to  the 
transaction.    Hence,  a  lawyer  should  not  participate  in  a  sham  transaction;  for 
example,  a  transaction  to  effectuate  criminal  or  fraudulent  escape  of  tax  liability.  
Paragraph  (c)  does  not  preclude  undertaking  a  criminal  defense  incident  to  a 
general  retainer  for  legal  services  to  a  lawful  enterprise.    The  last  clause  of 
paragraph (c) recognizes that determining the validity or interpretation of a statute 
or regulation may require a course of action involving disobedience of the statute or 
regulation or of the interpretation placed upon it by governmental authorities.  

Rule 1.3.  Diligence. 

A  lawyer  shall  act  with  reasonable  diligence  and  promptness  in  representing  a 
client.  

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

13 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

Comment:  

A lawyer should pursue a matter on behalf of a client despite opposition, obstruction 
or personal inconvenience to the lawyer, and may take whatever lawful and ethical 
measures  are  required  to  vindicate  a  client’s  cause  or  endeavor.    A  lawyer  should 
act with commitment and dedication to the interests of the  client and with zeal in 
advocacy upon the client’s behalf.  However, a lawyer is not bound to press for every 
advantage that might be realized for a client.  A lawyer has professional discretion 
in determining the means by which a matter should be pursued.  See Rule 1.2.  A 
lawyer’s  workload  should  be  controlled  so  that  each  matter  can  be  handled 
adequately. 

Perhaps no professional shortcoming is more widely resented than procrastination.  
A  client’s  interests  often  can  be  adversely  affected  by  the  passage  of  time  or  the 
change of conditions; in extreme instances, as when a lawyer overlooks a statute of 
limitations,  the  client’s  legal  position  may  be  destroyed.    Even  when  the  client’s 
interests  are  not  affected  in  substance,  however,  unreasonable  delay  can  cause  a 
client needless anxiety and undermine confidence in the lawyer’s trustworthiness.  

Unless  the  relationship  is  terminated  as  provided  in  Rule  1.16,  a  lawyer  should 
carry  through  to  conclusion  all  matters  undertaken  for  a  client.    If  a  lawyer’s 
employment  is  limited  to  a  specific  matter,  the  relationship  terminates  when  the 
matter has been resolved.  If a lawyer has served a client over a substantial period 
in  a  variety  of  matters,  the  client  sometimes  may  assume  that  the  lawyer  will 
continue  to  serve  on  a  continuing  basis  unless  the  lawyer  gives  notice  of 
withdrawal.  Doubt about whether a client-lawyer relationship still exists should be 
clarified by the lawyer, preferably in writing, so that the client will not mistakenly 
suppose the lawyer is looking after the client’s affairs when the lawyer has ceased 
to  do  so.    For  example,  if  a  lawyer  has  handled  a  judicial  or  administrative 
proceeding that produced a result adverse to the client but has not been specifically 
instructed  concerning  pursuit  of  an  appeal,  the  lawyer  should  advise  the  client  of 
the possibility of appeal before relinquishing responsibility for the matter.  

Rule 1.4.  Communication. 

(a)  A  lawyer  shall  keep  a  client  reasonably  informed  about  the  status  of  a  matter 
and  comply  promptly  with  reasonable  requests  for  information.    A  lawyer  shall 
notify  the  client  promptly  of  all  settlement  offers,  case  evaluations,  and  proposed 
plea bargains.  

(b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the 
client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.  

Comment:  

The client should have sufficient information to participate intelligently in decisions 
concerning the objectives of the representation and the means by which they are to 
be  pursued  to  the  extent  the  client  is  willing  and  able  to  do  so.    For  example,  a 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

14 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

lawyer negotiating on behalf of a client should provide the client with facts relevant 
to  the  matter,  inform  the  client  of  communications  from  another  party,  and  take 
other reasonable steps that permit the client to make a decision regarding an offer 
from  another  party.    A  lawyer  who  receives  an  offer  of  settlement  or  a  mediation 
evaluation  in  a  civil  controversy,  or  a  proffered  plea  bargain  in  a  criminal  case, 
must  promptly  inform  the  client  of  its  substance.    See  Rule  1.2(a).    Even  when  a 
client  delegates  authority  to  the  lawyer,  the  client  should  be  kept  advised  of  the 
status of the matter.  

Adequacy  of  communication  depends  in  part  on  the  kind  of  advice  or  assistance 
involved.    For  example,  in  negotiations  where  there  is  time  to  explain  a  proposal, 
the lawyer should review all important provisions with the client before proceeding 
to  an  agreement.    In  litigation,  a  lawyer  should  explain  the  general  strategy  and 
prospects  of  success  and  ordinarily  should  consult  the  client  on  tactics  that  might 
injure or coerce others.  On the other hand, a lawyer ordinarily cannot be expected 
to describe trial or negotiation strategy in detail.  The guiding principle is that the 
lawyer  should  fulfill reasonable  client  expectations  for  information  consistent  with 
the duty to act in the client’s best interests and consistent with the client’s overall 
requirements as to the character of representation.  

Ordinarily, the information to be provided is that appropriate for a client who is a 
comprehending  and  responsible  adult.    However,  fully  informing  the  client 
according to this standard may be impracticable, for example, where the client is a 
child  or  suffers  from  mental  disability.    See  Rule  1.14.    When  the  client  is  an 
organization or group, it is often impossible or inappropriate to inform every one of 
its  members  about  its  legal  affairs;  ordinarily,  the  lawyer  should  address 
communications  to  the  appropriate  officials  of  the  organization.    See  Rule  1.13.  
Where  many  routine  matters  are  involved,  a  system  of  limited  or  occasional 
reporting  may  be  arranged  with  the  client.    Practical  exigency  may  also  require  a 
lawyer to act for a client without prior consultation.  

Withholding Information. 

In  some  circumstances,  a  lawyer  may  be  justified  in  delaying  transmission  of 
information  when  the  client  would  be  likely  to  react  imprudently  to  an  immediate 
communication.    Thus,  a  lawyer  might withhold  a  psychiatric  diagnosis  of  a  client 
when the examining psychiatrist indicates that disclosure would harm the client.  A 
lawyer  may  not  withhold  information  to  serve  the  lawyer’s  own  interest  or 
convenience.    Rules  or  court  orders  governing  litigation  may  provide  that 
information  supplied  to  a  lawyer  may  not  be  disclosed  to  the  client.    Rule  3.4(c) 
directs compliance with such rules or orders.  

Rule 1.5.  Fees. 

(a)  A  lawyer  shall  not  enter  into  an  agreement  for,  charge,  or  collect  an  illegal  or 
clearly excessive fee.  A fee is clearly excessive when, after a review of the facts, a 
lawyer  of  ordinary  prudence  would  be  left with  a  definite  and  firm  conviction  that 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

15 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

the fee is in excess of a reasonable fee.  The factors to be considered in determining 
the reasonableness of a fee include the following: 

(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, 
and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; 

(2)  the  likelihood,  if  apparent  to  the  client,  that  the  acceptance  of  the  particular 
employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer; 

(3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services; 

(4) the amount involved and the results obtained; 

(5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances; 

(6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; 

(7)  the  experience,  reputation,  and  ability of  the  lawyer  or lawyers  performing  the 
services; and 

(8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent. 

(b) When the lawyer has not regularly represented the client, the basis or rate of the 
fee  shall  be  communicated  to  the  client,  preferably  in  writing,  before  or  within  a 
reasonable time after commencing the representation.  

(c)  A  fee  may  be  contingent  on  the  outcome  of  the  matter  for  which  the  service  is 
rendered,  except  in  a  matter  in  which  a  contingent  fee  is  prohibited  by  paragraph 
(d) or by other law.  A contingent-fee agreement shall be in writing and shall state 
the method by which the fee is to be determined.  Upon conclusion of a contingent-
fee  matter,  the  lawyer  shall  provide  the  client  with  a  written  statement  of  the 
outcome of the matter and, if there is a recovery, show the remittance to the client 
and  the  method  of  its  determination.    See  also  MCR  8.121  for  additional 
requirements applicable to some contingent-fee agreements.  

(d) A lawyer shall not enter into an arrangement for, charge, or collect: 

(1)  any  fee  in  a  domestic  relations  matter,  the  payment  or  amount  of  which  is 
contingent upon the securing of a divorce or upon the amount of alimony or support, 
or property settlement in lieu thereof, the lawyer’s success, results obtained, value 
added, or any factor to be applied that leaves the client unable to discern the basis 
or rate of the fee or the method by which the fee is to be determined, or 

(2) a contingent fee for representing a defendant in a criminal case. 

(e) A division of a fee between lawyers who are not in the same firm may be made 
only if: 

(1) the client is advised of and does not object to the participation of all the lawyers 
involved; and 

(2) the total fee is reasonable.

Comment: 

Basis or Rate of Fee. 

When  the  lawyer  has  regularly  represented  a  client,  they  ordinarily  will  have 
evolved an understanding concerning the basis or rate of the fee.  In a new client-
lawyer  relationship,  however,  an  understanding  as  to  the  fee  should  be  promptly 
established.  It is not necessary to recite all the factors that underlie the basis of the 
fee, but only those that are directly involved in its computation.  It is sufficient, for 
example,  to  state  that  the  basic  rate  is  an  hourly  charge  or  a  fixed  amount  or  an 
estimated  amount,  or  to  identify  the  factors  that  may  be  taken  into  account  in 
finally  fixing  the  fee.    When  developments  occur  during  the  representation  that 
render  an  earlier  estimate  substantially  inaccurate,  a  revised  estimate  should  be 
provided  to  the  client.    A  written  statement  concerning  the  fee  reduces  the 
possibility of misunderstanding.  Furnishing the client with a simple memorandum 
or a copy of the lawyer’s customary fee schedule is sufficient if the basis or rate of 
the fee is set forth.  

Prohibited Contingent Fees. 

Paragraph (d) prohibits a lawyer from charging a fee in a domestic relations matter 
when payment is contingent upon the securing of a divorce, or upon the amount of 
alimony or support or property settlement to be obtained.  The amount of alimony, 
support or property awarded to a client shall not be used by a lawyer as a basis for 
enhancing the fee.  This provision does not preclude a contract for a contingent fee 
for  legal  representation  in  connection  with  the  recovery  of  postjudgment  balances 
due under support, alimony or other financial orders because such contracts do not 
implicate the same policy concerns. 

Terms of Payment. 

A  lawyer  may  require  advance  payment  of  a  fee,  but  is  obliged  to  return  any 
unearned portion.  See Rule 1.16(d).  A lawyer may accept property in payment for 
services,  such  as  an  ownership  interest  in  an  enterprise,  providing  this  does  not 
involve acquisition of a proprietary interest in the cause of action or subject matter 
of the litigation contrary to Rule 1.8(j).  However, a fee paid in property instead of 
money  may  be  subject  to  special  scrutiny  because  it  involves  questions  concerning 
both the value of the services and the lawyer’s special knowledge of the value of the 
property.  

An agreement may not be made whose terms might induce the lawyer improperly to 
curtail  services  for  the  client  or  perform  them  in  a  way  contrary  to  the  client’s 
interest.    For  example,  a  lawyer  should  not  enter  into  an  agreement  whereby 
services  are  to  be  provided  only  up  to  a  stated  amount  when  it  is  foreseeable  that 
more extensive services probably will be required, unless the situation is adequately 
explained  to  the  client.    Otherwise,  the  client  might  have  to  bargain  for  further 
assistance  in  the  midst  of  a  proceeding  or  transaction.    However,  it  is  proper  to 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

17 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

define the extent of services in light of the client’s ability to pay.  A lawyer should 
not exploit a fee arrangement based primarily on hourly charges by using wasteful 
procedures.    When  there  is  doubt  whether  a  contingent  fee  is  consistent  with  the 
client’s best interest, the lawyer should offer the client alternative bases for the fee 
and  explain  their  implications.    Applicable  law  may  impose  limitations  on 
contingent fees, such as a ceiling on the percentage.  See MCR 8.121.  

Division of Fee. 

A division of fee is a single billing to a client covering the fee of two or more lawyers 
who are not in the same firm.  A division of fee facilitates association of more than 
one  lawyer  in  a  matter  in  which  neither  alone  could  serve  the  client  as  well,  and 
most often is used when the fee is contingent and the division is between a referring 
lawyer and a trial specialist.  Paragraph (e) permits the lawyers to divide a fee on 
agreement  between  the  participating  lawyers  if  the  client  is  advised  and  does  not 
object.  It does not require disclosure to the client of the share that each lawyer is to 
receive.  

Disputes over Fees. 

If  a  procedure  has  been  established  for  resolution  of  fee  disputes,  such  as  an 
arbitration  or  mediation  procedure  established  by  the  bar,  the  lawyer  should 
conscientiously  consider  submitting  to  it.    Law  may  prescribe  a  procedure  for 
determining  a  lawyer’s  fee,  for  example,  in  representation  of  an  executor  or 
administrator,  of  a  class,  or  of  a  person  entitled  to  a  reasonable  fee  as  part  of  the 
measure of damages.  The lawyer entitled to such a fee and a lawyer representing 
another party concerned with the fee should comply with the prescribed procedure.  

Rule 1.6.  Confidentiality of Information. 

(a) “Confidence” refers to information protected by the client-lawyer privilege under 
applicable  law,  and  “secret”  refers  to  other  information  gained  in  the  professional 
relationship  that  the  client  has  requested  be  held  inviolate  or  the  disclosure  of 
which would be embarrassing or would be likely to be detrimental to the client.  

(b) Except when permitted under paragraph (c), a lawyer shall not knowingly: 

(1) reveal a confidence or secret of a client; 

(2) use a confidence or secret of a client to the disadvantage of the client; or 

(3) use a confidence or secret of a client for the advantage of the lawyer or of a third 
person, unless the client consents after full disclosure. 

(c) A lawyer may reveal: 

(1) confidences or secrets with the consent of the client or clients affected, but only 
after full disclosure to them; 

(2)  confidences  or  secrets  when  permitted  or  required  by  these  rules,  or  when 
required by law or by court order;

(3)  confidences  and  secrets  to  the  extent  reasonably  necessary  to  rectify  the 
consequences  of  a  client’s  illegal  or  fraudulent  act  in  the  furtherance  of  which  the 
lawyer’s services have been used; 

(4)  the  intention  of  a  client  to  commit  a  crime  and  the  information  necessary  to 
prevent the crime; and 

(5)  confidences  or  secrets  necessary  to  establish  or  collect  a  fee,  or  to  defend  the 
lawyer  or  the  lawyer’s  employees  or  associates  against  an  accusation  of  wrongful 
conduct. 

(d)  A  lawyer  shall  exercise  reasonable  care  to  prevent  employees,  associates,  and 
others whose services are utilized by the lawyer from disclosing or using confidences 
or  secrets  of  a  client,  except  that  a  lawyer  may  reveal  the  information  allowed  by 
paragraph (c) through an employee.  

Comment:  

The lawyer is part of a judicial system charged with upholding the law.  One of the 
lawyer’s functions is to advise clients so that they avoid any violation of the law in 
the proper exercise of their rights.  

The  observance  of  the  ethical  obligation  of  a  lawyer  to  hold  inviolate  confidential 
information  of  the  client  not  only  facilitates  the  full  development  of  facts  essential 
to proper representation of the client, but also encourages people to seek early legal 
assistance.  

Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in order to determine what their 
rights are and what is, in the maze of laws and regulations, deemed to be legal and 
correct.  The common law recognizes that the client’s confidences must be protected 
from disclosure.  Upon the basis of experience, lawyers know that almost all clients 
follow the advice given and that the law is upheld.  

A  fundamental  principle  in  the  client-lawyer  relationship  is  that  the  lawyer 
maintain confidentiality of information relating to the representation.  The client is 
thereby  encouraged  to  communicate  fully  and  frankly  with  the  lawyer  even  as  to 
embarrassing or legally damaging subject matter.  

The  principle  of  confidentiality  is  given  effect  in  two  related  bodies  of  law,  the 
client-lawyer  privilege  (which  includes  the  work-product  doctrine)  in  the  law  of 
evidence  and  the  rule  of  confidentiality  established  in  professional  ethics.    The 
client-lawyer  privilege  applies  in  judicial  and  other  proceedings  in  which  a  lawyer 
may be called as a witness or otherwise required to produce evidence concerning a 
client.    The  rule  of  client-lawyer  confidentiality  applies  in  situations  other  than 
those  where  evidence  is  sought  from  the  lawyer  through  compulsion  of  law.    The 
confidentiality  rule  applies  to  confidences  and  secrets  as  defined  in  the  rule.    A 
lawyer  may  not  disclose  such  information  except  as  authorized  or  required  by  the 
Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.  See also Scope, ante, p M 1-18.

information  relating  to 
The  requirement  of  maintaining  confidentiality  of 
representation  applies  to  government  lawyers  who  may  disagree  with  the  policy 
goals that their representation is designed to advance.  

Authorized Disclosure. 

A  lawyer  is  impliedly  authorized  to  make  disclosures  about  a  client  when 
appropriate in carrying out the representation, except to the extent that the client’s 
instructions  or  special  circumstances  limit  that  authority.    In  litigation,  for 
example,  a  lawyer  may  disclose  information  by  admitting  a  fact  that  cannot 
properly  be  disputed,  or,  in  negotiation,  by  making  a  disclosure  that  facilitates  a 
satisfactory conclusion.  

Lawyers  in  a  firm  may,  in  the  course  of  the  firm’s  practice,  disclose  to  each  other 
information  relating  to  a  client  of  the  firm,  unless  the  client  has  instructed  that 
particular  information  be  confined  to  specified  lawyers,  or  unless  the  disclosure 
would  breach  a  screen  erected  within  the  firm  in  accordance  with  Rules  1.10(b), 
1.11(a), or 1.12(c).  

Disclosure Adverse to Client. 

The  confidentiality  rule  is  subject  to  limited  exceptions.    In  becoming  privy  to 
information about a client, a lawyer may foresee that the client intends to commit a 
crime.  To the extent a lawyer is prohibited from making disclosure, the interests of 
the potential victim are sacrificed in favor of preserving the client’s confidences even 
though  the  client’s  purpose  is  wrongful.    To  the  extent  a  lawyer  is  required  or 
permitted to disclose a client’s purposes, the client may be inhibited from revealing 
facts which would enable the lawyer to counsel against a wrongful course of action.  
A  rule  governing  disclosure  of  threatened  harm  thus  involves  balancing  the 
interests  of  one  group  of  potential  victims  against  those  of  another.    On  the 
assumption  that  lawyers  generally  fulfill  their  duty  to  advise  against  the 
commission  of  deliberately  wrongful  acts,  the  public  is  better  protected  if  full  and 
open communication by the client is encouraged than if it is inhibited.  

Generally  speaking,  information  relating  to  the  representation  must  be  kept 
confidential  as  stated  in  paragraph  (b).    However,  when  the  client  is  or  will  be 
engaged in criminal conduct or the integrity of the lawyer’s own conduct is involved, 
the  principle  of  confidentiality  may  appropriately  yield,  depending  on  the  lawyer’s 
knowledge about and relationship to the conduct in question, and the seriousness of 
that conduct.  Several situations must be distinguished.  

First,  the  lawyer  may  not  counsel  or  assist  a  client  in  conduct  that  is  illegal  or 
fraudulent.  See Rule 1.2(c).  Similarly, a lawyer has a duty under Rule 3.3(a)(4) not 
to  use  false  evidence.    This  duty  is  essentially  a  special  instance  of  the  duty 
prescribed in Rule 1.2(c) to avoid assisting a client in illegal or fraudulent conduct.  
The same is true of compliance with Rule 4.1 concerning truthfulness of a lawyer’s 
own representations.  

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

20 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

Second, the lawyer may have been innocently involved in past conduct by the client 
that  was  criminal  or  fraudulent.    In  such  a  situation  the  lawyer  has  not  violated 
Rule  1.2(c),  because  to  “counsel  or  assist”  criminal  or  fraudulent  conduct  requires 
knowing  that  the  conduct  is  of  that  character.    Even  if  the  involvement  was 
innocent,  however,  the  fact  remains  that  the  lawyer’s  professional  services  were 
made  the  instrument  of  the  client’s  crime  or  fraud.    The  lawyer,  therefore,  has  a 
legitimate  interest  in  being  able  to  rectify  the  consequences  of  such  conduct,  and 
has the professional right, although not a professional duty, to rectify the situation.  
Exercising  that  right  may  require  revealing 
information  relating  to  the 
representation.    Paragraph  (c)(3)  gives  the  lawyer  professional discretion  to  reveal 
such information to the extent necessary to accomplish rectification.  However, the 
constitutional rights of defendants in criminal cases may limit the extent to which 
counsel  for  a  defendant  may  correct  a  misrepresentation  that  is  based  on 
information provided by the client.  See comment to Rule 3.3.  

Third,  the  lawyer  may  learn  that  a  client  intends  prospective  conduct  that  is 
criminal.    Inaction  by  the  lawyer  is  not  a  violation  of  Rule  1.2(c),  except  in  the 
limited  circumstances  where  failure  to  act  constitutes  assisting  the  client.    See 
comment  to  Rule  1.2(c).    However,  the  lawyer’s  knowledge  of  the  client’s  purpose 
may  enable  the  lawyer  to  prevent  commission  of  the  prospective  crime.    If  the 
prospective  crime  is  likely  to  result  in  substantial  injury,  the  lawyer  may  feel  a 
moral  obligation  to  take  preventive  action.    When  the  threatened  injury  is  grave, 
such  as  homicide  or  serious  bodily  injury,  a  lawyer  may  have  an  obligation  under 
tort or criminal law to take reasonable preventive measures.  Whether the lawyer’s 
concern  is  based  on  moral  or  legal  considerations,  the  interest  in  preventing  the 
harm  may  be  more  compelling  than  the  interest  in  preserving  confidentiality  of 
information  relating  to  the  client.    As  stated  in  paragraph  (c)(4),  the  lawyer  has 
professional  discretion  to  reveal  information  in  order  to  prevent  a  client’s  criminal 
act.  

It  is  arguable  that  the  lawyer  should  have  a  professional  obligation  to  make  a 
disclosure  in  order  to  prevent  homicide  or  serious  bodily  injury  which  the  lawyer 
knows is intended by the client.  However, it is very difficult for a lawyer to “know” 
when such a heinous purpose will actually be carried out, for the client may have a 
change  of  mind.   To require  disclosure  when  the  client  intends such  an  act,  at  the 
risk of professional discipline if the assessment of the client’s purpose turns out to 
be  wrong,  would  be  to  impose  a  penal  risk  that  might  interfere  with  the  lawyer’s 
resolution of an inherently difficult moral dilemma.  

The  lawyer’s  exercise  of  discretion  requires  consideration  of  such  factors  as 
magnitude, proximity, and likelihood of the contemplated wrong; the nature of the 
lawyer’s  relationship  with  the  client  and  with  those  who  might  be  injured  by  the 
client;  the  lawyer’s  own  involvement  in  the  transaction;  and  factors  that  may 
extenuate  the  conduct  in  question.    Where  practical,  the  lawyer  should  seek  to 
persuade the client to take suitable action.  In any case, a disclosure adverse to the 
client’s interest should be no greater than the lawyer reasonably believes necessary 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

21 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

to  the  purpose.    A  lawyer’s  decision  not  to  make  a  disclosure  permitted  by 
paragraph (c) does not violate this rule.  

Where  the  client  is  an  organization,  the  lawyer  may  be  in  doubt  whether 
contemplated  conduct  will  actually  be  carried  out  by  the  organization.    Where 
necessary to guide conduct in connection with this rule, the lawyer should make an 
inquiry within the organization as indicated in Rule 1.13(b).  

Paragraph (c)(3) does not apply where a lawyer is employed after a crime or fraud 
has been committed to represent the client in matters ensuing therefrom.  

Withdrawal. 

If the lawyer’s services will be used by the client in materially furthering a course of 
criminal  or  fraudulent  conduct,  the  lawyer  must  withdraw,  as  stated  in  Rule 
1.16(a)(1).  

After  withdrawal  the  lawyer  is  required  to  refrain  from  making  disclosure  of  the 
client’s confidences, except as otherwise provided in Rule 1.6.  Neither this rule nor 
Rule  1.8(b)  nor  Rule  1.16(d)  prevents  the  lawyer  from  giving  notice  of  the  fact  of 
withdrawal, and the lawyer may also withdraw or disaffirm any opinion, document, 
affirmation, or the like.  

Dispute Concerning Lawyer’s Conduct. 

Where  a  legal  claim  or  disciplinary  charge  alleges  complicity  of  the  lawyer  in  a 
client’s  conduct  or  other  misconduct  of  the  lawyer  involving  representation  of  the 
client,  the  lawyer  may  respond  to  the  extent  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes 
necessary to establish a defense.  The same is true with respect to a claim involving 
the  conduct  or  representation  of  a  former  client.    The  lawyer’s  right  to  respond 
arises  when  an  assertion  of  complicity  or  other  misconduct  has  been  made.  
Paragraph  (c)(5)  does  not  require  the  lawyer  to  await  the  commencement  of  an 
action  or  proceeding  that  charges  complicity  or  other  misconduct,  so  that  the 
defense  may  be  established  by  responding  directly  to  a  third  party  who  has  made 
such  an  assertion.    The  right  to  defend,  of  course,  applies  where  a  proceeding  has 
been  commenced.    Where  practicable  and  not  prejudicial  to  the  lawyer’s  ability  to 
establish  the  defense,  the  lawyer  should  advise  the  client  of  the  third  party’s 
assertion  and  request  that  the  client  respond  appropriately.    In  any  event, 
disclosure should be no greater than the lawyer reasonably believes is necessary to 
vindicate innocence, the disclosure should be made in a manner which limits access 
to  the  information  to  the  tribunal  or  other  persons  having  a  need  to  know  it,  and 
appropriate protective orders or other arrangements should be sought by the lawyer 
to the fullest extent practicable. 

If the lawyer is charged with wrongdoing in which the client’s conduct is implicated, 
the rule of confidentiality should not prevent the lawyer from defending against the 
charge.    Such  a  charge  can  arise  in  a  civil,  criminal,  or  professional  disciplinary 
proceeding, and can be based on a wrong allegedly committed by the lawyer against 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

22

the client, or on a wrong alleged by a third person, for example, a person claiming to 
have been defrauded by the lawyer and client acting together.  

A  lawyer  entitled  to  a  fee  is  permitted  by  paragraph  (c)(5)  to  prove  the  services 
rendered  in  an  action  to  collect  it.    This  aspect  of  the  rule  expresses  the  principle 
that the beneficiary of a fiduciary relationship may not exploit it to the detriment of 
the  fiduciary.    As  stated  above,  the  lawyer  must  make  every  effort  practicable  to 
avoid  unnecessary  disclosure  of  information  relating  to  a  representation,  to  limit 
disclosure  to  those  having  the  need  to  know  it,  and  to  obtain  protective  orders  or 
make other arrangements minimizing the risk of disclosure.  

Disclosures Otherwise Required or Authorized. 

The scope of the client-lawyer privilege is a question of law.  If a lawyer is called as 
a  witness  to  give  testimony  concerning  a  client,  absent  waiver  by  the  client, 
paragraph  (b)(1)  requires  the  lawyer  to  invoke  the  privilege  when  it  is  applicable.  
The  lawyer  must  comply  with  the  final  orders  of  a  court  or  other  tribunal  of 
competent jurisdiction requiring the lawyer to give information about the client.  

The  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  in  various  circumstances  permit  or  require  a 
lawyer to disclose information relating to the representation.  See Rules 2.2, 2.3, 3.3 
and 4.1.  In addition to these provisions, a lawyer may be obligated or permitted by 
other  provisions  of  law  to  give  information  about  a  client.    Whether  another 
provision of law supersedes Rule 1.6 is a matter of interpretation beyond the scope 
of these rules, but a presumption should exist against such a supersession.  

Former Client. 

The  duty  of  confidentiality  continues  after  the  client-lawyer  relationship  has 
terminated.  See Rule 1.9.  

Confidentiality of Information. 

When  transmitting  a  communication  that  contains  confidential  and/or  privileged 
information  relating  to  the  representation  of  a  client,  the  lawyer  should  take 
reasonable measures and act competently so that the confidential and/or privileged 
client information will not be revealed to unintended third parties. 

Rule 1.7.  Conflict of Interest: General Rule. 

(a) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client will be 
directly adverse to another client, unless: 

(1)  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  the  representation  will  not  adversely  affect  the 
relationship with the other client; and 

(2) each client consents after consultation. 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

23 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

(b) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client may be 
materially  limited  by  the  lawyer’s  responsibilities  to  another  client  or  to  a  third 
person, or by the lawyer’s own interests, unless:  

(1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected; 
and 

(2)  the  client  consents  after  consultation.    When  representation  of  multiple  clients 
in  a  single  matter  is undertaken,  the  consultation  shall  include  explanation  of  the 
implications of the common representation and the advantages and risks involved. 

Comment: 

Loyalty to a Client. 

Loyalty  is  an  essential  element  in  the  lawyer’s  relationship  to  a  client.    An 
impermissible conflict of interest may exist before representation is undertaken, in 
which  event  the  representation  should  be  declined.    The  lawyer  should  adopt 
reasonable  procedures,  appropriate  for  the  size  and  type  of  firm  and  practice,  to 
determine  in  both  litigation  and  nonlitigation  matters  the  parties  and  issues 
involved and to determine whether there are actual or potential conflicts of interest.  

If  such  a  conflict  arises  after  representation  has  been  undertaken,  the  lawyer 
should  withdraw  from  the  representation.    See  Rule  1.16.    Where  more  than  one 
client  is  involved  and  the  lawyer  withdraws  because  a  conflict  arises  after 
representation, whether the lawyer may continue to represent any of the clients is 
determined  by  Rule  1.9.    See  also  Rule  2.2(c).    As  to  whether  a  client-lawyer 
relationship exists or, having once been established, is continuing, see comment to 
Rule 1.3 and Scope, ante, p M 1-18. 

As  a  general  proposition,  loyalty  to  a  client  prohibits  undertaking  representation 
directly  adverse  to  that  client  without  that  client’s  consent.    Paragraph  (a) 
expresses  that  general  rule.    Thus,  a  lawyer  ordinarily  may  not  act  as  advocate 
against  a  person  the  lawyer  represents  in  some  other  matter,  even  if  it  is  wholly 
unrelated.  On the other hand, simultaneous representation in unrelated matters of 
clients  whose  interests  are  only  generally  adverse,  such  as  competing  economic 
enterprises,  does  not  require  consent  of  the  respective  clients.    Paragraph  (a) 
applies only when the representation of one client would be directly adverse to the 
other.  

Loyalty to a client is also impaired when a lawyer cannot consider, recommend, or 
carry out an appropriate course of action for the client because of the lawyer’s other 
responsibilities or interests.  The conflict in effect forecloses alternatives that would 
otherwise  be  available  to  the  client.    Paragraph  (b)  addresses  such  situations.    A 
possible  conflict  does  not  itself  preclude  the  representation.    The  critical  questions 
are  the  likelihood  that  a  conflict  will  eventuate  and,  if  it  does,  whether  it  will 
materially  interfere  with  the  lawyer’s  independent  professional  judgment  in 
considering  alternatives  or  foreclose  courses  of  action  that  reasonably  should  be 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

24 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

pursued on behalf of the client.  Consideration should be given to whether the client 
wishes to accommodate the other interest involved.  

Consultation and Consent. 

A  client  may  consent  to  representation  notwithstanding  a  conflict.    However,  as 
indicated  in  paragraph  (a)(1)  with  respect  to  representation  directly  adverse  to  a 
client,  and  paragraph  (b)(1)  with  respect  to  material  limitations  on  representation 
of  a  client,  when  a  disinterested  lawyer  would  conclude  that  the  client  should  not 
agree  to  the  representation  under  the  circumstances,  the  lawyer  involved  cannot 
properly  ask  for  such  agreement  or  provide  representation  on  the  basis  of  the 
client’s  consent.    When  more  than  one  client  is  involved,  the  question  of  conflict 
must be resolved as to each client.  Moreover, there may be circumstances where it 
is  impossible  to  make  the  disclosure  necessary  to  obtain  consent.    For  example, 
when  the  lawyer  represents  different  clients  in  related  matters  and  one  of  the 
clients  refuses  to  consent  to  the  disclosure  necessary  to  permit  the  other  client  to 
make an informed decision, the lawyer cannot properly ask the latter to consent.  

Lawyer’s Interests. 

The  lawyer’s  own  interests  should  not  be  permitted  to  have  adverse  effect  on 
representation of a client.  For example, a lawyer’s need for income should not lead 
the  lawyer  to  undertake  matters  that  cannot  be  handled  competently  and  at  a 
reasonable fee.  See Rules 1.1 and 1.5.  If the probity of a lawyer’s own conduct in a 
transaction is in serious question, it may be difficult or impossible for the lawyer to 
give a client detached advice.  A lawyer may not allow related business interests to 
affect representation, for example, by referring clients to an enterprise in which the 
lawyer has an undisclosed interest.  

Conflicts in Litigation. 

in 

(a) prohibits  representation  of  opposing  parties 

Paragraph 
litigation.  
Simultaneous  representation  of  parties  whose  interests  in  litigation  may  conflict, 
  An 
such  as  coplaintiffs  or  codefendants,  is  governed  by  paragraph  (b). 
impermissible conflict may exist by reason of substantial discrepancy in the parties’ 
testimony, incompatibility in positions in relation to an opposing party, or the fact 
that  there  are  substantially  different  possibilities  of  settlement  of  the  claims  or 
liabilities  in  question.    Such  conflicts  can  arise  in  criminal  cases  as  well  as  civil.  
The  potential  for  conflict  of  interest  in  representing  multiple  defendants  in  a 
criminal case is so grave that ordinarily a lawyer should decline to represent more 
than  one  codefendant.    On  the  other  hand,  common  representation  of  persons 
having  similar  interests  is  proper  if  the  risk  of  adverse  effect  is  minimal  and  the 
requirements of paragraph (b) are met.  Compare Rule 2.2 involving intermediation 
between clients.  

Ordinarily, a lawyer may not act as advocate against a client the lawyer represents 
in some other matter, even if the other matter is wholly unrelated.  However, there 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

25 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

are  circumstances  in  which  a  lawyer  may  act  as  advocate  against  a  client.    For 
example,  a  lawyer  representing  an  enterprise  with  diverse  operations  may  accept 
employment as an advocate against the enterprise in an unrelated matter if doing 
so will not adversely affect the lawyer’s relationship with the enterprise or conduct 
of  the  suit  and  if  both  clients  consent  upon  consultation.    By  the  same  token, 
government  lawyers  in  some  circumstances  may  represent  government  employees 
in proceedings in which a government agency is the opposing party.  The propriety 
of  concurrent  representation  can  depend  on  the  nature  of  the  litigation.    For 
example, a suit charging fraud entails conflict to a degree not involved in a suit for a 
declaratory judgment concerning statutory interpretation.  

Interest of Person Paying for a Lawyer’s Service. 

A lawyer may be paid from a source other than the client if the client is informed of 
that fact and consents and the arrangement does not compromise the lawyer’s duty 
of  loyalty  to  the  client.    See  Rule  1.8(f).    For  example,  when  an  insurer  and  its 
insured  have  conflicting  interests  in  a  matter  arising  from  a  liability  insurance 
agreement,  and  the  insurer  is  required  to  provide  special  counsel  for  the  insured, 
the arrangement should assure the special counsel’s professional independence.  So 
also, when a corporation and its directors or employees are involved in a controversy 
in  which  they  have  conflicting  interests,  the  corporation  may  provide  funds  for 
separate  legal  representation  of  the  directors  or  employees  if  the  clients  consent 
after  consultation  and  the  arrangement  ensures  the 
lawyer’s  professional 
independence.  

Other Conflict Situations. 

Conflicts of interest in contexts other than litigation sometimes may be difficult to 
assess.  Relevant factors in determining whether there is potential for adverse effect 
include  the  duration  and  intimacy  of  the  lawyer’s  relationship  with  the  client  or 
clients  involved,  the  functions  being  performed  by  the  lawyer,  the  likelihood  that 
actual conflict will arise, and the likely prejudice to the client from the conflict if it 
does arise.  The question is often one of proximity and degree.  

For  example,  a  lawyer  may  not  represent  multiple  parties  in  a  negotiation  whose 
interests are fundamentally antagonistic to each other, but common representation 
is permissible where the clients are generally aligned in interest even though there 
is some difference of interest among them.  

Conflict  questions  may  also  arise  in  estate  planning and  estate  administration.   A 
lawyer  may  be  called  upon  to  prepare  wills  for  several  family  members,  such  as 
husband  and  wife,  and,  depending  upon  the  circumstances,  a  conflict  of  interest 
may arise.  In estate administration the identity of the client may be a question of 
law.  The lawyer should make clear the relationship to the parties involved.  

A lawyer for a corporation or other organization who is also a member of its board of 
directors  should  determine  whether  the  responsibilities  of  the  two  roles  may 
conflict.  The lawyer may be called on to advise the corporation in matters involving

26

actions of the directors.  Consideration should be given to the frequency with which 
such  situations  may  arise,  the  potential  intensity  of  the  conflict,  the  effect  of  the 
lawyer’s  resignation  from  the  board,  and  the  possibility  of  the  corporation’s 
obtaining legal advice from another lawyer in such situations.  If there is material 
risk  that  the  dual  role  will  compromise  the  lawyer’s  independence  of  professional 
judgment, the lawyer should not serve as a director.  

Conflict Charged by an Opposing Party. 

Resolving  questions  of  conflict  of  interest  is  primarily  the  responsibility  of  the 
lawyer undertaking the representation.  In litigation, a court may raise the question 
when there is reason to infer that the lawyer has neglected the responsibility.  In a 
criminal case, inquiry by the court is generally required when a lawyer represents 
multiple defendants.  See MCR 6.101(C)(4).  Where the conflict is such as clearly to 
call in question the fair or efficient administration of justice, opposing counsel may 
properly  raise  the  question.    Such  an  objection  should  be  viewed  with  caution, 
however, for it can be misused as a technique of harassment.  See Scope, ante, p M 
1-18. 

Rule 1.8.  Conflict of Interest: Prohibited Transactions. 

(a) A lawyer shall not enter into a business transaction with a client or knowingly 
acquire an ownership, possessory, security, or other pecuniary interest adverse to a 
client unless: 

(1) the transaction and terms on which the lawyer acquires the interest are fair and 
reasonable  to  the  client  and  are  fully  disclosed  and  transmitted  in  writing  to  the 
client in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the client; 

(2)  the  client  is  given  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  seek  the  advice  of  independent 
counsel in the transaction; and 

(3) the client consents in writing thereto. 

(b)  A  lawyer  shall  not  use  information  relating  to  representation  of  a  client  to  the 
disadvantage  of  the  client  unless  the  client  consents  after  consultation,  except  as 
permitted or required by Rule 1.6 or Rule 3.3.  

(c) A lawyer shall not prepare an instrument giving the lawyer or a person related 
to the lawyer as parent, child, sibling, or spouse any substantial gift from a client, 
including a testamentary gift, except where the client is related to the donee.  

(d) Prior to the conclusion of representation of a client, a lawyer shall not make or 
negotiate an agreement giving the lawyer literary or media rights to a portrayal or 
account based in substantial part on information relating to the representation.  

(e)  A  lawyer  shall  not  provide  financial  assistance  to  a  client  in  connection  with 
pending or contemplated litigation, except that 

(1)  a  lawyer  may  advance  court  costs  and  expenses  of  litigation,  the  repayment  of 
which shall ultimately be the responsibility of the client; and

27 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

(2)  a  lawyer  representing  an  indigent  client  may  pay  court  costs  and  expenses  of 
litigation on behalf of the client. 

(f) A lawyer shall not accept compensation for representing a client from one other 
than the client unless: 

(1) the client consents after consultation; 

(2) there is no interference with the lawyer’s independence of professional judgment 
or with the client-lawyer relationship; and 

(3) information relating to representation of a client is protected as required by Rule 
1.6. 

(g) A lawyer who represents two or more clients shall not participate in making an 
aggregate  settlement  of  the  claims  of  or  against  the  clients,  or,  in  a  criminal  case, 
an  aggregated  agreement  as  to  guilty  or  nolo  contendere  pleas,  unless  each  client 
consents  after  consultation,  including  disclosure  of  the  existence  and  nature  of  all 
the  claims  or  pleas  involved  and  of  the  participation  of  each  person  in  the 
settlement.  

(h) A lawyer shall not:  

(1)  make  an  agreement  prospectively  limiting  the  lawyer’s  liability  to  a  client  for 
malpractice unless permitted by law and the client is independently represented in 
making the agreement; or 

(2)  settle  a  claim  for  such  liability  with  an  unrepresented  client  or  former  client 
without  first  advising  that  person  in  writing  that  independent  representation  is 
appropriate in connection therewith. 

(i) A lawyer related to another lawyer as parent, child, sibling, or spouse shall not 
represent a client in a representation directly adverse to a person whom the lawyer 
knows  is  represented  by  the  other  lawyer  except  upon  consent  by  the  client  after 
consultation regarding the relationship.  

(j) A lawyer shall not acquire a proprietary interest in the cause of action or subject 
matter  of  litigation  the  lawyer  is  conducting  for  a  client,  except  that  the  lawyer 
may: 

(1) acquire a lien granted by law to secure the lawyer’s fee or expenses; and 

(2) contract with a client for a reasonable contingent fee in a civil case, as permitted 
by Rule 1.5 and MCR 8.121. 

Comment: 

Transactions between Client and Lawyer. 

As a general principle, all transactions between client and lawyer should be fair and 
reasonable to the client.  In such transactions a review by independent  counsel on 
behalf  of  the  client  is  often  advisable.    Furthermore,  a  lawyer  may  not  exploit 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

28 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

information  relating  to  the  representation  to  the  client’s  disadvantage.    For 
example, a lawyer who has learned that the client is investing in specific real estate 
may not, without the client’s consent, seek to acquire nearby property where doing 
so would adversely affect the client’s plan for investment.  Paragraph (a) does not, 
however,  apply  to  standard  commercial  transactions  between  the  lawyer  and  the 
client  for  products  or  services  that  the  client  generally  markets  to  others,  for 
example, banking or brokerage services, medical services, products manufactured or 
distributed  by  the  client,  and  utilities’  services.    In  such  transactions,  the  lawyer 
has  no  advantage  in  dealing  with  the  client,  and  the  restrictions  in  paragraph  (a) 
are unnecessary and impracticable.  

A lawyer may accept a gift from a client if the transaction meets general standards 
of fairness.  For example, a simple gift such as a present given at a holiday or as a 
token  of  appreciation  is  permitted.    If  effectuation  of  a  substantial  gift  requires 
preparing  a  legal  instrument  such  as  a  will  or  conveyance,  however,  the  client 
should  have  the  detached  advice  that  another  lawyer  can  provide.    Paragraph  (c) 
recognizes an exception where the client is a relative of the donee or the gift is not 
substantial.  

Literary Rights. 

An  agreement  by  which  a  lawyer  acquires  literary  or  media  rights  concerning  the 
conduct  of  the  representation  creates  a  conflict  between  the  interests  of  the  client 
and the personal interests of the lawyer.  Measures suitable in the representation of 
the  client  may  detract  from  the  publication  value  of  an  account  of  the 
representation.  Paragraph (d) does not prohibit a lawyer representing a client in a 
transaction  concerning  literary  property  from  agreeing  that  the  lawyer’s  fee  shall 
consist of a share in ownership in the property, if the arrangement conforms to Rule 
1.5 and paragraph (j).  

Person Paying for Lawyer’s Services. 

Paragraph  (f)  requires  disclosure  of  the  fact  that  the  lawyer’s  services  are  being 
paid  for  by  a  third  party.    Such  an  arrangement  must  also  conform  to  the 
requirements of Rule 1.6 concerning confidentiality and Rule 1.7 concerning conflict 
of  interest.    Where  the  client  is  a  class,  consent  may  be  obtained  on  behalf  of  the 
class by court-supervised procedure.  

Limiting Liability. 

Paragraph  (h)  is  not  intended  to  apply  to  customary  qualifications  and  limitations 
in legal opinions and memoranda.  

Family Relationships between Lawyers. 

Paragraph (i) applies to related lawyers who are in different firms.  Related lawyers 
in  the  same  firm  are  governed  by  Rules  1.7,  1.9,  and  1.10.    The  disqualification 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

29 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

stated  in  paragraph  (i)  is  personal  and  is  not  imputed  to  members  of  firms  with 
whom the lawyers are associated.  

Acquisition of Interest in Litigation. 

Paragraph  (j)  states  the  traditional  general  rule  that  lawyers  are  prohibited  from 
acquiring a proprietary interest in litigation.  This general rule, which has its basis 
in  common-law  champerty  and  maintenance,  is  subject  to  specific  exceptions 
developed in decisional law and continued in these rules, such as the exception for 
reasonable  contingent  fees  set  forth  in  Rule  1.5  and  the  exception  for  certain 
advances of the costs of litigation set forth in paragraph (e).  

Sexual Relations with Clients. 

After  careful  study,  the  Supreme  Court  declined  in  1998  to  adopt  a  proposal  to 
amend  Rule  1.8  to  limit  sexual  relationships  between  lawyers  and  clients.    The 
Michigan  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  adequately  prohibit  representation  that 
lacks  competence  or  diligence,  or  that  is  shadowed  by  a  conflict  of  interest.    With 
regard to sexual behavior, the Michigan Court Rules provide that a lawyer may be 
disciplined for “conduct that is contrary to justice, ethics, honesty, or good morals.”  
MCR 9.104(3).  Further, the Legislature has enacted criminal penalties for certain 
types of sexual misconduct.  In this regard, it should be emphasized that a lawyer 
bears  a  fiduciary  responsibility  toward  the  client.    A  lawyer  who  has  a  conflict  of 
interest, whose actions interfere with effective representation, who takes advantage 
of  a  client’s  vulnerability,  or  whose  behavior  is  immoral  risks  severe  sanctions 
under  the  existing  Michigan  Court  Rules  and  Michigan  Rules  of  Professional 
Conduct.  

Rule 1.9.  Conflict of Interest: Former Client. 

(a) A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter 
represent  another  person  in  the  same  or  a  substantially  related  matter  in  which 
that  person’s  interests  are  materially  adverse  to  the  interests  of  the  former  client 
unless the former client consents after consultation.  

(b)  Unless  the  former  client  consents  after  consultation,  a  lawyer  shall  not 
knowingly  represent  a  person  in  the  same  or  a  substantially  related  matter  in 
which  a  firm  with  which  the  lawyer  formerly  was  associated  has  previously 
represented a client 

(1) whose interests are materially adverse to that person, and 

(2)  about  whom  the  lawyer  had  acquired  information  protected  by  Rules  1.6  and 
1.9(c) that is material to the matter. 

(c) A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter or whose present or 
former firm has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter: 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

30 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

(1) use information relating to the representation to the disadvantage of the former 
client except as Rule 1.6 or Rule 3.3 would permit or require with respect to a client, 
or when the information has become generally known; or 

(2) reveal information relating to the representation except as Rule 1.6 or Rule 3.3 
would permit or require with respect to a client. 

Comment:  

After  termination  of  a  client-lawyer  relationship,  a  lawyer  may  not  represent 
another  client  except  in  conformity  with  this  rule.    The  principles  in  Rule  1.7 
determine whether the interests of the present and former client are adverse.  Thus, 
a  lawyer  could  not  properly  seek  to  rescind  on  behalf  of  a  new  client  a  contract 
drafted  on  behalf  of  the  former  client.    So  also  a  lawyer  who  has  prosecuted  an 
accused person could not properly represent the accused in a subsequent civil action 
against the government concerning the same transaction. 

The  scope  of  a  “matter”  for  purposes  of  this  rule  may  depend  on  the  facts  of  a 
particular situation or transaction.  The lawyer’s involvement in a matter can also 
be  a  question  of  degree.    When  a  lawyer  has  been  directly  involved  in  a  specific 
transaction,  subsequent  representation  of  other  clients  with  materially  adverse 
interests  clearly  is  prohibited.    On  the  other  hand,  a  lawyer  who  recurrently 
handled  a  type  of  problem  for  a  former  client  is  not  precluded  from  later 
representing  another  client  in  a  wholly  distinct  problem  of  that  type  even  though 
the  subsequent  representation  involves  a  position  adverse  to  the  prior  client.  
Similar  considerations  can  apply  to  the  reassignment  of  military  lawyers  between 
defense  and  prosecution  functions  within  the  same  military  jurisdiction.    The 
underlying  question  is  whether  the  lawyer  was  so  involved  in  the  matter  that  the 
subsequent  representation  can  be  justly  regarded  as  a  changing  of  sides  in  the 
matter in question.  

Lawyers Moving Between Firms. 

When  lawyers  have  been  associated  in  a  firm  but  then  end  their  association,  the 
problem  is  more  complicated.    First,  the  client  previously  represented  must  be 
reasonably  assured  that  the  principle  of  loyalty  to  the  client  is  not  compromised.  
Second,  the  rule  of  disqualification  should  not  be  so  broadly  cast  as  to  preclude 
other  persons  from  having  reasonable  choice  of  legal  counsel.    Third,  the  rule  of 
disqualification  should  not  unreasonably  hamper  lawyers  from  forming  new 
associations and taking on new clients after having left a previous association.  In 
this connection, it should be recognized that today many lawyers practice in firms, 
that  many,  to  some  degree,  limit  their  practice  to  one  field  or  another,  and  that 
many  move  from  one  association  to  another  several  times  in  their  careers.    If  the 
concept  of  imputed  disqualification  were  applied  with  unqualified  rigor,  the  result 
would  be  radical  curtailment  of  the  opportunity  of  lawyers  to  move  from  one 
practice setting to another and of the opportunity of clients to change counsel.  

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

31 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

Reconciliation  of  these  competing  principles  in  the  past  has been  attempted  under 
two  rubrics.    One  approach  has  been  to  seek  rules  of  disqualification  per  se.    For 
example, it has been held that a partner in a law firm is conclusively presumed to 
have access to all confidences concerning all clients of the firm.  Under this analysis, 
if  a  lawyer  has  been  a  partner  in  one  law  firm  and  then  becomes  a  partner  in 
another law firm, there is a presumption that all confidences known by a partner in 
the first firm are known to all partners in the second firm.  This presumption might 
properly  be  applied  in  some  circumstances,  especially  where  the  client  has  been 
extensively  represented,  but  may  be  unrealistic  where  the  client  was  represented 
only for limited purposes.  Furthermore, such a rigid rule exaggerates the difference 
between a partner and an associate in modern law firms.  

The  other  rubric  formerly  used  for  dealing  with  vicarious  disqualification  is  the 
appearance  of  impropriety  proscribed  in  Canon  9  of  the  former  Michigan  Code  of 
Professional  Responsibility.    Two  problems  can  arise  under  this  rubric.    First,  the 
appearance  of  impropriety  might  be  understood  to  include  any  new  client-lawyer 
relationship  that  might  make  a  former  client  feel  anxious.    If  that  meaning  were 
adopted,  disqualification  would  become  little  more  than  a  question  of  subjective 
judgment  by  the  former  client.   Second,  since  “impropriety”  is undefined,  the  term 
“appearance  of  impropriety”  begs  the  question.    Thus,  the  problem  of  imputed 
disqualification  cannot  readily  be  resolved  either  by  simple  analogy  to  a  lawyer 
practicing alone or by the very general concept of appearance of impropriety.  

A  rule  based  on  a  functional  analysis  is  more  appropriate  for  determining  the 
question  of  vicarious  disqualification.    Two  functions  are  involved:  preserving 
confidentiality and avoiding positions adverse to a client.  

Under  Rule  1.10(b),  screening  may  be  employed  to  preserve  the  confidences  of  a 
client when a lawyer has moved from one firm to another.  Rule 1.10(b) applies not 
just to cases in which a lawyer’s present and former firms are involved on the date 
the lawyer moves.  The paragraph also applies where the lawyer’s present firm later 
wishes  to  enter  a  case  from  which  the  lawyer  is  barred  because  of  information 
acquired while associated with the prior firm.  

Confidentiality. 

Preserving  confidentiality  is  a  question  of  access  to  information.    Access  to 
information,  in  turn,  is  essentially  a  question  of  fact  in  particular  circumstances.  
The determination of that question of fact can be aided by inferences, deductions, or 
assumptions  that  reasonably  may  be  made  about  the  way  in  which  lawyers  work 
together.  A lawyer may have general access to files of all clients of a law firm and 
may  regularly  participate  in  discussions  of  their  affairs;  it  should  be  inferred  that 
such  a  lawyer  in  fact  is  privy  to  all  information  about  all  the  firm’s  clients.    In 
contrast,  another  lawyer  may  have  access  to  the  files  of  only  a  limited  number  of 
clients and participate in discussion of the affairs of no other clients; in the absence 
of  information  to  the  contrary,  it  should  be  inferred  that  such  a  lawyer  in  fact  is 
privy to information about the clients actually served but not those of other clients.  

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

32 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

Application of paragraph (b) depends on a situation’s particular facts.  In any such 
inquiry,  the  burden  of  proof  should  rest  upon  the  lawyer  whose  disqualification  is 
sought.  

Rule 1.10(b), incorporating paragraph (b) of this rule, operates to disqualify the firm 
only  when  the  lawyer  involved  has  actual  knowledge  of  information  protected  by 
Rules 1.6 and 1.9(c).  Thus, if a lawyer while with one firm acquired no knowledge of 
information relating to a particular client of the firm, and that lawyer later joined 
another  firm,  neither  the  lawyer  individually  nor  the  second  firm  is  disqualified 
from  representing  another  client  in  the  same  or  a  related  matter  even  though  the 
interests  of  the  two  clients  conflict.   See  Rule  1.10(c)  for  the  restrictions  on  a  firm 
once a lawyer has terminated association with the firm.  

Independent  of  the  question  of  disqualification  of  a  firm,  a  lawyer  changing 
professional  association  has  a  continuing  duty  to  preserve  confidentiality  of 
information about a client formerly represented.  See Rule 1.6.  

Adverse Positions. 

The  second  aspect  of  loyalty  to  a  client  is  the  lawyer’s  obligation  to  decline 
subsequent representations involving positions adverse to a former client arising in 
substantially  related  matters.    This  obligation  requires  abstention  from  adverse 
representation  by  the  individual  lawyer  involved,  but  does  not  properly  entail 
abstention of other lawyers through imputed disqualification.  Thus, if a lawyer left 
one firm for another, the new affiliation would not preclude the firms involved from 
continuing  to  represent  clients  with  adverse  interests  in  the  same  or  related 
matters, so long as the conditions of Rule 1.10(b) and (c) have been met.  

Information  acquired  by  the  lawyer  in  the  course  of  representing  a  client  may  not 
subsequently  be  used  or  revealed  by  the  lawyer  to  the  disadvantage  of  the  client.  
However,  the  fact  that  a  lawyer  has  once  served  a  client  does  not  preclude  the 
lawyer  from  using  generally  known  information  about  that  client  when  later 
representing another client.  

Disqualification from subsequent representation is for the protection of clients and 
can  be  waived  by  them.    A  waiver  is  effective  only  if  there  is  disclosure  of  the 
circumstances, including the lawyer’s intended role in behalf of the new client.  

With  regard  to  an  opposing  party  raising  a  question  of  conflict  of  interest,  see 
comment to Rule 1.7.  With regard to disqualification of a firm with which a lawyer 
is or was formerly associated, see Rule 1.10.  

Rule 1.10.  Imputed Disqualification: General Rule. 

(a) While lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall knowingly represent a 
client when any one of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by 
Rules  1.7,  1.8(c),  1.9(a),  or  2.2.    If  a  lawyer  leaves  a  firm  and  becomes  associated 
with  another  firm,  MRPC  1.10(b)  governs  whether  the  new  firm  is  imputedly 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

33

disqualified because of the newly hired lawyer’s prior services in or association with 
the lawyer’s former law firm. 

(b)  When  a  lawyer  becomes  associated  with  a  firm,  the  firm  may  not  knowingly 
represent  a  person  in  the  same  or  a  substantially  related  matter  in  which  that 
lawyer, or a firm with which the lawyer was associated, is disqualified under Rule 
1.9(b), unless: 

(1)  the  disqualified  lawyer  is  screened  from  any  participation in  the  matter  and  is 
apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and 

(2)  written  notice  is  promptly  given  to  the  appropriate  tribunal  to  enable  it  to 
ascertain compliance with the provisions of this rule. 

(c)  When  a  lawyer  has  terminated  an  association  with  a  firm,  the  firm  is  not 
prohibited from thereafter representing a person with interests materially adverse 
to those of a client represented by the formerly associated lawyer, and not currently 
represented by the firm, unless: 

(1)  the  matter  is  the  same  or  substantially  related  to  that  in  which  the  formerly 
associated lawyer represented the client; and 

(2)  any  lawyer  remaining  in  the  firm  has  information  protected  by  Rules  1.6  and 
1.9(c) that is material to the matter. 

(d)  A  disqualification  prescribed  by  this  rule  may  be  waived  by  the  affected  client 
under the conditions stated in Rule 1.7.  

Comment: 

Definition of “Firm.”  

For purposes of these rules, the term “firm” includes lawyers in a private firm and 
lawyers employed in the legal department of a corporation or other organization or 
in  a  legal  services  organization.    Whether  two  or  more  lawyers  constitute  a  firm 
within  this  definition  can  depend  on  the  specific  facts.    For  example,  two 
practitioners  who  share  office  space  and  occasionally  consult  or  assist  each  other 
ordinarily  would  not  be  regarded  as  constituting  a  firm.    However,  if  they  present 
themselves  to  the  public  in  a  way  suggesting  that  they  are  a  firm  or  conduct 
themselves  as  a  firm,  they  should  be  regarded  as  a  firm  for  purposes  of  the  rules.  
The  terms  of  any  formal  agreement  between  associated  lawyers  are  relevant  in 
determining whether they are a firm, as is the fact that they have mutual access to 
confidential  information  concerning  the  clients  they  serve.    Furthermore,  it  is 
relevant  in  doubtful  cases  to  consider  the  underlying  purpose  of  the  rule  that  is 
involved.    A  group  of  lawyers  could  be  regarded  as  a  firm  for  purposes  of  the  rule 
that  the  same  lawyer  should  not  represent  opposing  parties  in  litigation,  while  it 
might not be so regarded for purposes of the rule that information acquired by one 
lawyer is attributed to another.  

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct

With  respect  to  the  law  department  of  an  organization,  there  is  ordinarily  no 
question that the members of the department constitute a firm within the meaning 
of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  However, there can be uncertainty as to the 
identity of the client.  For example, it may not be clear whether the law department 
of a corporation represents a subsidiary or an affiliated corporation, as well as the 
corporation  by  which  the  members  of  the  department  are  directly  employed.    A 
similar  question  can  arise  concerning  an  unincorporated  association  and  its  local 
affiliates.  

Similar  questions  can  also  arise  with  respect  to  lawyers  in  legal  aid.    Lawyers 
employed in the same unit of a legal service organization constitute a firm, but not 
necessarily  those  employed  in  separate  units.    As  in  the  case  of  independent 
practitioners, whether the lawyers should be treated as being associated with each 
other can depend on the particular rule that is involved and on the specific facts of 
the situation.  

Where a lawyer has joined a private firm after having represented the government, 
the  situation  is  governed  by  Rule  1.11(a)  and  (b);  where  a  lawyer  represents  the 
government  after  having  served  private  clients,  the  situation  is  governed  by  Rule 
1.11(c)(1).  The individual lawyer involved is bound by the rules generally, including 
Rules 1.6, 1.7, and 1.9.  

Principles of Imputed Disqualification. 

The  rule  of  imputed  disqualification  stated  in  paragraph  (a)  gives  effect  to  the 
principle of loyalty to the client as it applies to lawyers who practice in a law firm.  
Such  situations  can  be  considered  from  the  premise  that  a  firm  of  lawyers  is 
essentially  one  lawyer  for  purposes  of  the  rules  governing  loyalty  to  the  client,  or 
from the premise that each lawyer is vicariously bound by the obligation of loyalty 
owed  by  each lawyer  with  whom the  lawyer  is  associated.    Paragraph  (a)  operates 
only among the lawyers currently associated in a firm.  When a lawyer moves or has 
recently moved from one firm to another, the situation is governed by Rules 1.9(b) 
and 1.10(b).  

Rule  1.10(c)  operates  to  permit  a  law  firm,  under  certain  circumstances,  to 
represent a person with interests directly adverse to those of a client represented by 
a lawyer who formerly was associated with the firm.  The rule applies regardless of 
when the formerly associated lawyer represented the client.  However, the law firm 
may not represent a person with interests adverse to those of a present client of the 
firm,  which  would  violate  Rule  1.7.    Moreover,  the  firm  may  not  represent  the 
person  where  the  matter  is  the  same  or  substantially  related  to  that  in  which  the 
formerly associated lawyer represented the client and any other lawyer currently in 
the  firm  has  material  information  protected  by  Rules  1.6  and  1.9(c),  unless  the 
provisions of this rule are followed.

Rule 1.11.  Successive Government and Private Employment. 

(a)  Except  as  law  may  otherwise  expressly  permit,  a  lawyer  shall  not  represent  a 
private  client  in  connection  with  a  matter  in  which  the  lawyer  participated 
personally and substantially as a public officer or employee, unless the appropriate 
government  agency  consents  after  consultation.    No  lawyer  in  a  firm  with  which 
that  lawyer  is  associated  may  knowingly  undertake  or  continue  representation  in 
such a matter, unless: 

(1)  the  disqualified  lawyer  is  screened  from  any  participation in  the  matter  and  is 
apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and  

(2) written notice is promptly given to the appropriate government agency to enable 
it to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this rule.  

(b) Except as law may otherwise expressly permit, a lawyer having information that 
the lawyer knows is confidential government information about a person, acquired 
when the lawyer was a public officer or employee, may not represent a private client 
whose  interests  are  adverse  to  that  person  in  a  matter  in  which  the  information 
could be used to the material disadvantage of that person.  A firm with which that 
lawyer is associated may undertake or continue representation in the matter only if 
the  disqualified  lawyer  is  screened  from  any  participation  in  the  matter  and  is 
apportioned no part of the fee therefrom.  

(c)  Except  as  law  may  otherwise  expressly  permit,  a  lawyer  serving  as  a  public 
officer or employee shall not: 

(1)  participate  in  a  matter  in  which  the  lawyer  participated  personally  and 
substantially  while  in  private  practice  or  nongovernmental  employment,  unless 
under applicable law no one is, or by lawful delegation may be, authorized to act in 
the lawyer’s stead in the matter; or  

(2) negotiate for private employment with any person who is involved as a party or 
as  an  attorney  for  a  party  in  a  matter  in  which  the  lawyer  is  participating 
personally and substantially, except that a lawyer serving as a law clerk to a judge, 
other  adjudicative  officer,  or  arbitrator  may  negotiate  for  private  employment  in 
accordance with Rule 1.12(b).  

(d) As used in this rule, the term “matter” includes: 

(1)  any  judicial  or  other  proceeding,  application,  request  for  a  ruling  or  other 
determination,  contract,  claim,  controversy,  investigation,  charge,  accusation, 
arrest, or other particular matter involving a specific party or parties; and  

(2)  any  other  matter  covered  by  the  conflict  of  interest  rules  of  the  appropriate 
government agency.  

(e)  As  used  in  this  rule,  the  term  “confidential  government  information”  means 
information that has been obtained under governmental authority and that, at the 
time this rule is applied, the government is prohibited by law from disclosing to the

public or has a legal privilege not to disclose, and that is not otherwise available to 
the public.  

Comment:  

This  rule  prevents  a  lawyer  from  exploiting  public  office  for  the  advantage  of  a 
private client.  It is a counterpart of Rule 1.10(b), which applies to lawyers moving 
from one firm to another. 

A  lawyer  representing  a  government  agency,  whether  employed  or  specially 
retained  by  the  government,  is  subject  to  the  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct, 
including  the  prohibition  against  representing adverse  interests  stated  in  Rule  1.7 
and the protections afforded former clients in Rule 1.9.  In addition, such a lawyer is 
subject to Rule 1.11 and to statutes and government regulations regarding conflict 
of interest.  Such statutes and regulations may circumscribe the extent to which the 
government agency may give consent under this rule.  

Where the successive clients are a public agency and a private client, the risk exists 
that  power  or  discretion  vested  in  public  authority  might  be  used  for  the  special 
benefit of a private client.  A lawyer should not be in a position where benefit to a 
private  client  might  affect  performance  of  the  lawyer’s  professional  functions  on 
behalf of public authority.  Also, unfair advantage could accrue to the private client 
by  reason  of  access  to  confidential  government  information  about  the  client’s 
adversary obtainable only through the lawyer’s government service.  However, the 
rules  governing  lawyers  presently  or  formerly  employed  by  a  government  agency 
should  not  be  so  restrictive  as  to  inhibit  transfer  of  employment  to  and  from  the 
government.  The government has a legitimate need to attract qualified lawyers as 
well as to maintain high ethical standards.  The provisions for screening and waiver 
are  necessary  to  prevent  the  disqualification  rule  from  imposing  too  severe  a 
deterrent against entering public service.  

When the client is an agency of one government, that agency should be treated as a 
private client for purposes of this rule if the lawyer thereafter represents an agency 
of  another  government,  as  when  a  lawyer  represents  a  city  and  subsequently  is 
employed by a federal agency.  

Paragraphs  (a)(1)  and  (b)  do  not  prohibit  a  lawyer  from  receiving  a  salary  or 
partnership  share  established  by  prior  independent  agreement.    They  prohibit 
directly  relating  the attorney’s  compensation  to  the  fee  in  the matter  in  which  the 
lawyer is disqualified.  

Paragraph  (a)(2)  does  not  require  that  a  lawyer  give  notice  to  the  government 
agency at a time when premature disclosure would injure the client; a requirement 
for premature disclosure might preclude engagement of the lawyer.  Such notice is, 
however,  required  to be  given  as  soon  as  practicable in  order  that  the  government 
agency will have a reasonable opportunity to ascertain that the lawyer is complying 
with  Rule  1.11  and  to  take  appropriate  action  if  it  believes  the  lawyer  is  not 
complying.

Paragraph  (b)  operates  only  when  the  lawyer  in  question  has  knowledge  of  the 
information,  which  means  actual  knowledge;  it  does  not  operate  with  respect  to 
information that merely could be imputed to the lawyer.  

Paragraphs (a) and (c) do not prohibit a lawyer from jointly representing a private 
party and a government agency when doing so is permitted by Rule 1.7 and is not 
otherwise prohibited by law.  

Paragraph (c) does not disqualify other lawyers in the agency with which the lawyer 
in question has become associated.  

Rule 1.12.  Former Judge or Arbitrator. 

(a)  Except  as  stated  in  paragraph  (d),  a  lawyer  shall  not  represent  anyone  in 
connection  with  a  matter  in  which  the  lawyer  participated  personally  and 
substantially as a judge or other adjudicative officer, arbitrator, or law clerk to such 
a person, unless all parties to the proceeding consent after consultation.  

(b) A lawyer shall not negotiate for employment with any person who is involved as 
a  party,  or  as  an  attorney  for  a  party,  in  a  matter  in  which  the  lawyer  is 
participating personally and substantially as a judge or other adjudicative officer or 
arbitrator.  A lawyer serving as a law clerk to a judge, other adjudicative officer, or 
arbitrator  may  negotiate  for  employment  with  a  party  or  attorney  involved  in  a 
matter  in  which  the  clerk  is  participating  personally  and  substantially,  but  only 
after the lawyer has notified the judge, other adjudicative officer, or arbitrator.  

(c) If a lawyer is disqualified by paragraph (a), no lawyer in a firm with which that 
lawyer  is  associated  may  knowingly  undertake  or  continue  representation  in  the 
matter, unless: 

(1)  the  disqualified  lawyer  is  screened  from  any  participation in  the  matter  and  is 
apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and  

(2)  written  notice  is  promptly  given  to  the  appropriate  tribunal  to  enable  it  to 
ascertain compliance with the provisions of this rule.  

(d)  An  arbitrator  selected  as  a  partisan  of  a  party  in  a  multimember  arbitration 
panel is not prohibited from subsequently representing that party.  

Comment:  

This  rule  generally  parallels  Rule  1.11.    The  term  “personally  and  substantially” 
signifies  that  a  judge  who  was  a  member  of  a  multimember  court,  and  thereafter 
left  judicial  office  to  practice  law,  is  not  prohibited  from  representing  a  client  in  a 
matter pending in the court, but in which the former judge did not participate.  So 
also  the  fact  that a  former  judge  exercised  administrative  responsibility  in a  court 
does  not  prevent  the  former  judge  from  acting  as  a  lawyer  in  a  matter  where  the 
judge  had  previously  exercised  remote  or  incidental  administrative  responsibility 
that  did  not  affect  the  merits.    Compare  the  comment  to  Rule  1.11.    The  term 
“adjudicative officer” includes such officials as judges pro tempore, referees, special

masters, hearing officers and other parajudicial officers, and also lawyers who serve 
as part-time judges. 

Rule 1.13.  Organization as Client. 

(a)  A  lawyer  employed  or  retained  to  represent  an  organization  represents  the 
organization  as  distinct 
its  directors,  officers,  employees,  members, 
shareholders, or other constituents.  

from 

(b) If a lawyer for an organization knows that an officer, employee, or other person 
associated  with  the  organization  is  engaged  in  action,  intends  to  act,  or  refuses  to 
act in a matter related to the representation that is a violation of a legal obligation 
to the organization, or a violation of law which reasonably might be imputed to the 
organization,  and  that  is  likely  to  result  in  substantial  injury  to  the  organization, 
the  lawyer  shall  proceed  as  is  reasonably  necessary  in  the  best  interest  of  the 
organization.    In  determining  how  to  proceed,  the  lawyer  shall  give  due 
consideration to the seriousness of the violation and its consequences, the scope and 
nature of the lawyer’s representation, the responsibility in the organization, and the 
apparent  motivation  of  the  person  involved,  the  policies  of  the  organization 
concerning  such  matters,  and  any  other  relevant  considerations.    Any  measures 
taken  shall be  designed  to  minimize  disruption  of  the  organization  and  the  risk  of 
revealing  information  relating  to  the  representation  to  persons  outside  the 
organization.  Such measures may include among others: 

(1) asking reconsideration of the matter;  

(2) advising that a separate legal opinion on the matter be sought for presentation 
to appropriate authority in the organization; and  

(3)  referring  the  matter  to  higher  authority  in  the  organization,  including,  if 
warranted  by  the  seriousness  of  the  matter,  referral  to  the  highest  authority  that 
can act in behalf of the organization as determined by applicable law.  

(c) When the organization’s highest authority insists upon action, or refuses to take 
action,  that  is  clearly  a  violation  of  a  legal  obligation  to  the  organization  or  a 
violation of law which reasonably might be imputed to the organization, and that is 
likely  to  result  in  substantial  injury  to  the  organization,  the  lawyer  may  take 
further  remedial  action  that  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  to  be  in  the  best 
interest  of  the  organization.    Such  action  may  include  revealing  information 
otherwise protected by Rule 1.6 only if the lawyer reasonably believes that  

(1)  the  highest  authority  in  the  organization  has  acted  to  further  the  personal  or 
financial  interests  of  members  of  that  authority  which  are  in  conflict  with  the 
interests of the organization; and  

(2) revealing the information is necessary in the best interest of the organization.  

(d)  In  dealing  with  an  organization’s  directors,  officers,  employees,  members, 
shareholders, or other constituents, a lawyer shall explain the identity of the client

officers,  employees,  members,  shareholders,  or  other  constituents,  subject  to  the 
provisions  of  Rule  1.7.    If  the  organization’s  consent  to  the  dual  representation  is 
required  by  Rule  1.7,  the  consent  shall  be  given  by  an  appropriate  official  of  the 
organization  other  than  the  individual  who  is  to  be  represented,  or  by  the 
shareholders.  

Comment: 

The Entity as the Client. 

finally  and  authoritatively. 

In transactions with their lawyers, clients who are individuals can speak and decide 
  In  transactions  between  an 
for  themselves, 
organization  and  its  lawyer,  however,  the  organization  can  speak  and  decide  only 
through  agents,  such  as  its  officers  or  employees.    In  effect,  the  client-lawyer 
relationship  is  maintained  through  an  intermediary  between  the  client  and  the 
lawyer.    This  fact  requires  the  lawyer  under  certain  conditions  to  be  concerned 
whether the intermediary legitimately represents the client.  

When officers or employees of the organization make decisions for it, the decisions 
ordinarily  must  be  accepted  by  the  lawyer  even  if  their  utility  or  prudence  is 
doubtful.    Decisions  concerning  policy  and  operations,  including  ones  entailing 
serious  risk,  are  not  as  such  in  the  lawyer’s  province.    However,  different 
considerations  arise  when  the  lawyer  knows  that  the  organization  may  be 
substantially injured by action of an officer or employee that is in violation of law.  
In  such  a  circumstance,  it  may  be  reasonably  necessary  for  the  lawyer  to  ask  the 
officer,  employee,  or  other  agent  to  reconsider  the  matter.    If  that  fails,  or  if  the 
matter  is  of  sufficient  seriousness  and  importance  to  the  organization,  it  may  be 
reasonably necessary for the lawyer to take steps to have the matter reviewed by a 
higher  authority  in  the  organization.    Clear  justification  should  exist  for  seeking 
review  over  the  head  of  the  officer  or  employee  normally  responsible  for  it.    The 
stated  policy  of  the  organization  may  define  circumstances  and  prescribe  channels 
for such review, and a lawyer should encourage formulation of such a policy.  Even 
in the absence of organization policy, however, the lawyer may have an obligation to 
refer a matter to higher authority, depending on the seriousness of the matter and 
whether  the  officer  in  question  has  apparent  motives  to  act  at  variance  with  the 
organization’s  interest.    Review  by  the  chief  executive  officer  or  by  the  board  of 
directors  may  be  required  when  the  matter  is  of  importance  commensurate  with 
their  authority.    At  some  point  it  may  be  useful  or  essential  to  obtain  an 
independent legal opinion.  

In  an  extreme  case,  it  may  be  reasonably  necessary  for  the  lawyer  to  refer  the 
matter  to  the  organization’s  highest  authority.    Ordinarily,  that  is  the  board  of 
directors  or  similar  governing  body.    However,  applicable  law  may  prescribe  that 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

40 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

under  certain  conditions  highest  authority  reposes  elsewhere,  for  example,  in  the 
independent directors of a corporation.  The ultimately difficult question is whether 
the  lawyer  should  be  permitted  to  circumvent  the  organization’s  highest  authority 
when  it  persists  in  a  course  of  action  that  is  clearly  violative  of  law  or  a  legal 
obligation to the organization and that is likely to result in substantial injury to the 
organization.  

In  such  a  situation,  if  the  lawyer  can  take  remedial  action  without  a  disclosure  of 
information that might adversely affect the organization, the lawyer as a matter of 
professional  discretion  may  take  such  actions  as  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  to 
be  in  the  best  interest  of  the  organization.    For  example,  a  lawyer  for  a  close 
corporation may find it reasonably necessary to disclose misconduct by the board to 
the  shareholders. 
  However,  taking  such  action  could  entail  disclosure  of 
information  relating  to  the  representation  with  consequent  risk  of  injury  to  the 
client.    When  such  is  the  case,  the  organization  is  threatened  by  alternative 
injuries: the injury that may result from the governing board’s action or refusal to 
act, and the injury that may result if the lawyer’s remedial efforts entail disclosure 
of  confidential  information.    The  lawyer  may  pursue  remedial  efforts  even  at  the 
risk of disclosure in the circumstances stated in subparagraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2).  

Relation to Other Rules. 

The  authority  and  responsibility  provided  in  Rules  1.13(b)  and  (c)  are  concurrent 
with  the  authority  and  responsibility  provided  in  other  rules.    In  particular,  this 
rule does not limit the lawyer’s authority under Rule 1.6, the responsibilities to the 
client under Rules 1.8 and 1.16 and the responsibilities of the lawyer under Rule 3.3 
or  4.1.    If  the  lawyer’s  services  are  being  used  by  an  organization  to  further  an 
illegal act or fraud by the organization, Rule 1.2(c) can be applicable.  In connection 
with complying with Rule 1.2(c), 3.3 or 4.1, or exercising the discretion conferred by 
Rule 1.6(c), a lawyer for an organization may be in doubt whether the conduct will 
actually  be  carried  out  by  the  organization. 
  To  guide  conduct  in  such 
circumstances,  the  lawyer  ordinarily  should  make  inquiry  within  the  organization 
as indicated in Rule 1.13(b).  

When the lawyer involved is a member of a firm, the firm’s procedures may require 
referral of difficult questions to a superior in the firm.  In that event, Rule 5.2 may 
be applicable.  

Unincorporated Associations. 

The duty defined in this rule applies to unincorporated associations.  

Governmental Agency. 

The  duty  defined  in  this  rule  applies  to  governmental  organizations.    However, 
when  the  client  is  a  governmental  organization,  a  different  balance  may  be 
appropriate  between  maintaining  confidentiality  and  assuring  that  the  wrongful 
official act is prevented or rectified because public business is involved.  In addition, 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

41 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

duties of lawyers employed by the government or lawyers in military service may be 
defined by statutes and regulations.  Therefore, defining precisely the identity of the 
client  and  prescribing  the  resulting  obligations  of  such  lawyers  may  be  more 
difficult  in  the  government  context.    In  some  circumstances,  it  may  be  a  specific 
agency,  but  in  others  it  may  be  the  government  as  a  whole.    For  example,  if  the 
action or failure to act involves the head of a bureau, the department of which the 
bureau  is  a  part  may  be  the  client  for  purpose  of  this  rule.    With  these 
qualifications, the lawyer’s substantive duty to the client and reasonable courses of 
action are essentially the same as when the client is a private organization.  

Clarifying the Lawyer’s Role. 

The  fact  that  the  organization  is  the  client  may  be  quite  unclear  to  the 
organization’s  officials  and  employees.    An  organization  official  accustomed  to 
working  with  the  organization’s  lawyer  may  forget  that  the  lawyer  represents  the 
organization  and  not  the  official.    The  result  of  such  a  misunderstanding  can  be 
embarrassing  or  prejudicial  to  the  individual  if,  for  example,  the  situation  is  such 
that the client-lawyer privilege will not protect the individual’s communications to 
the lawyer.  The lawyer should take reasonable care to prevent such consequences.  
The  measures  required  depend  on  the  circumstances.    In  routine  legal  matters,  a 
lawyer  for  a  large  corporation  does  not  have  to  explain  to  a  corporate  official  that 
the  corporation  is  the  client.    On  the  other  hand,  if  the  lawyer  is  conducting  an 
inquiry  involving  possible  illegal  activity,  a  warning  might  be  essential  to  prevent 
unfairness to a corporate employee.  See also Rule 4.3.  

Paragraph  (e)  recognizes  that  a  lawyer  for  an  organization  may  also  represent  a 
principal officer or major shareholder.  Such common representation, although often 
undertaken in practice, can entail serious potential conflicts of interest.  

Dual Representation. 

Derivative Actions. 

Under generally prevailing law, the shareholders or members of a corporation may 
bring  suit  to  compel  the  directors  to  perform  their  legal  obligations  in  the 
supervision  of  the  organization.    Members  of  unincorporated  associations  have 
essentially  the  same  right.      Such  an  action  may  be  brought  nominally  by  the 
organization,  but  usually  is,  in  fact,  a  legal  controversy  over  management  of  the 
organization.  

The  question  can  arise  whether  counsel  for  the  organization  may  defend  such  an 
action.    The  proposition  that  the  organization  is  the  lawyer’s  client  does  not  alone 
resolve the issue.  Most derivative actions are a normal incident of an organization’s 
affairs, to be defended by the organization’s lawyer like any other suit.  However, if 
the  claim  involves  serious  charges  of  wrongdoing  by  those  in  control  of  the 
organization, a conflict may arise between the lawyer’s duty to the organization and 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

42

the lawyer’s relationship with the board.  In those circumstances, Rule 1.7 governs 
whether independent counsel should represent the directors.  

Rule 1.14.  Client Under a Disability. 

(a)  When  a  client’s  ability  to  make  adequately  considered  decisions  in  connection 
with  the  representation  is  impaired,  whether  because  of  minority  or  mental 
disability or for some other reason, the lawyer shall, as far as reasonably possible, 
maintain a normal client-lawyer relationship with the client.  

(b) A lawyer may seek the appointment of a guardian or take other protective action 
with  respect  to  a  client  only  when  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  that  the  client 
cannot adequately act in the client’s own interest.  

Comment:  

The  normal  client-lawyer  relationship  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  client, 
when properly advised and assisted, is capable of making decisions about important 
matters.  When the client is a minor or suffers from a mental disorder or disability, 
however, maintaining the ordinary client-lawyer relationship may not be possible in 
all  respects.    In  particular,  an  incapacitated  person  may  have  no  power  to  make 
legally binding decisions.  Nevertheless, a client lacking legal competence often has 
the  ability  to  understand,  deliberate  upon,  and  reach  conclusions  about  matters 
affecting the client’s own well-being.  Furthermore, to an increasing extent the law 
recognizes intermediate degrees of competence.  For example, children as young as 
five or six years of age, and certainly those of ten or twelve, are regarded as having 
opinions  that  are  entitled  to  weight  in  legal  proceedings  concerning  their  custody.  
So also, it is recognized that some persons of advanced age can be quite capable of 
handling routine financial matters while needing special legal protection concerning 
major transactions. 

The fact that a client suffers a disability does not diminish the lawyer’s obligation to 
treat the client with attention and respect.  If the person has no guardian or legal 
representative, the lawyer often must act de facto as guardian.  Even if the person 
does  have  a  legal  representative,  the  lawyer  should  as  far  as  possible  accord  the 
represented person the status of client, particularly in maintaining communication.  

If  a  legal  representative  has  already  been  appointed  for  the  client,  the  lawyer 
should ordinarily look to the representative for decisions on behalf of the client.  If a 
legal  representative  has  not  been  appointed,  the  lawyer  should  see  to  such  an 
appointment  where  it  would  serve  the  client’s  best  interests.    Thus,  if  a  disabled 
client has substantial property that should be sold for the client’s benefit, effective 
completion  of  the  transaction  ordinarily  requires  appointment  of  a 
legal 
representative. 
  In  many  circumstances,  however,  appointment  of  a  legal 
representative  may  be  expensive  or  traumatic  for  the  client.    Evaluation  of  these 
considerations is a matter of professional judgment on the lawyer’s part.  

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

43 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

If the lawyer represents the guardian as distinct from the ward, and is aware that 
the  guardian  is  acting  adversely  to  the  ward’s  interest,  the  lawyer  may  have  an 
obligation to prevent or rectify the guardian’s misconduct.  See Rule 1.2(c).  

If  the  lawyer  seeks  the  appointment  of  a  legal  representative  for  the  client,  the 
filing of the request itself, together with the facts upon which it is predicated, may 
constitute the disclosure of confidential information which could be used against the 
client.    If  the  court  to  whom  the  matter  is  submitted  thereafter  determines  that a 
legal representative is not necessary, the harm befalling the client as the result of 
the disclosure may be irreparable.  Consequently, consideration should be given to 
initially  filing  the  petition  seeking  the  appointment  of  a  legal  representative  ex 
parte  so  that  the  court  can  decide  how  best  to  proceed  to  minimize  the  potential 
adverse  consequences  to  the  client  by,  for  example,  issuing  a  protective  order 
limiting  the  disclosure  of  the  confidential  information  upon  which  the  request  is 
predicated.  

Disclosure of the Client’s Condition. 

Rules  of  procedure  in  litigation  generally  provide  that  minors  or  persons  suffering 
mental  disability  shall  be  represented  by  a  guardian  or  next  friend  if  they  do  not 
have a general guardian.  However, disclosure of the client’s disability can adversely 
affect the client’s interests.  For example, raising the question of disability could, in 
some circumstances, lead to proceedings for involuntary commitment.  The lawyer’s 
position  in  such  cases  is  an  unavoidably  difficult  one.    The  lawyer  may  seek 
guidance from an appropriate diagnostician.  

Rule 1.15.  Safekeeping Property. 

(a) Definitions. 

(1)  “Allowable  reasonable  fees”  for  IOLTA  accounts  are  per  check  charges,  per 
deposit charges, a fee in lieu of a minimum balance, federal deposit insurance fees, 
sweep  fees,  and  a  reasonable  IOLTA  account  administrative  or  maintenance  fee.  
All  other  fees  are  the  responsibility  of,  and  may  be  charged  to,  the  lawyer 
maintaining  the  IOLTA  account.    Fees  or  charges  in  excess  of  the  interest  or 
dividends earned on the account for any month or quarter shall not be taken from 
interest  or  dividends  earned  on  other  IOLTA  accounts  or  from  the  principal  of  the 
account. 

(2)  An  “eligible  institution”  for  IOLTA  accounts  is  a  bank,  credit  union,  or  savings 
and loan association authorized by federal or state law to do business in Michigan, 
the deposits of which are insured by an agency of the federal government, or is an 
open-end  investment  company  registered  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange 
Commission  authorized  by  federal  or  state  law  to  do  business  in  Michigan.    The 
eligible institution must pay no less on an IOLTA account than the highest interest 
rate  or  dividend  generally  available  from  the  institution  to  its  non-IOLTA 
customers  when  the  IOLTA  account  meets  the  same  minimum  balance  or  other 
eligibility  qualifications.    Interest  or  dividends  and  fees  shall  be  calculated  in 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct

accordance  with  the  eligible  institution’s  standard  practice,  but  institutions  may 
elect  to  pay  a  higher  interest  or  dividend  rate  and  may  elect  to  waive  any  fees  on 
IOLTA accounts. 

(3) “IOLTA account” refers to an interest- or dividend-bearing account, as defined by 
the Michigan State Bar Foundation, at an eligible institution from which funds may 
be withdrawn upon request as soon as permitted by law.  An IOLTA account shall 
include  only  client  or  third  person  funds  that  cannot  earn  income  for  the  client  or 
third  person  in  excess  of  the  costs  incurred  to  secure  such  income  while  the  funds 
are held. 

(4)  “Non-IOLTA  account”  refers  to  an  interest-  or  dividend-bearing  account  from 
which funds may be withdrawn upon request as soon as permitted by law in banks, 
savings and loan associations, and credit unions authorized by federal or state law 
to  do  business  in  Michigan,  the  deposits  of  which  are  insured  by  an  agency  of  the 
federal government.  Such an account shall be established as: 

(A) a separate client trust account for the  particular client or matter on which the 
net interest or dividend will be paid to the client or third person, or 

(B)  a  pooled  client  trust  account  with  subaccounting  by  the  bank  or  savings  and 
loan association or by the lawyer, which will provide for computation of net interest 
or dividend earned by each client or third person’s funds and the payment thereof to 
the client or third person. 

(5)  “Lawyer”  includes  a  law  firm  or  other  organization  with  which  a  lawyer  is 
professionally associated. 

(b) A lawyer shall: 

(1)  promptly  notify  the  client  or  third  person  when  funds  or  property  in  which  a 
client or third person has an interest is received; 

(2) preserve complete records of such account funds and other property for a period 
of five years after termination of the representation; and 

(3)  promptly  pay  or  deliver  any  funds  or  other  property  that  the  client  or  third 
person is entitled to receive, except as stated in this rule or otherwise permitted by 
law or by agreement with the client or third person, and, upon request by the client 
or third person, promptly render a full accounting regarding such property. 

(c) When two or more persons (one of whom may be the lawyer) claim interest in the 
property, it shall be kept separate by the lawyer until the dispute is resolved.  The 
lawyer  shall  promptly  distribute  all  portions  of  the  property  as  to  which  the 
interests are not in dispute. 

(d)  A  lawyer  shall  hold  property  of  clients  or  third  persons  in  connection  with  a 
representation separate from the lawyer’s own property.  All client or third person 
funds shall be deposited in an IOLTA or non-IOLTA account.  Other property shall 
be identified as such and appropriately safeguarded.

(e)  In  determining  whether  client  or  third  person  funds  should  be  deposited  in  an 
IOLTA  account  or  a  non-IOLTA  account,  a  lawyer  shall  consider  the  following 
factors: 

(1) the amount of interest or dividends the funds would earn during the period that 
they  are  expected  to  be  deposited  in  light  of  (a)  the  amount  of  the  funds  to  be 
deposited; (b) the expected duration of the deposit, including the likelihood of delay 
in the matter for which the funds are held; and (c) the rates of interest or yield at 
financial institutions where the funds are to be deposited; 

(2) the cost of establishing and administering non-IOLTA accounts for the client or 
third  person’s  benefit,  including  service  charges  or  fees,  the  lawyer’s  services, 
preparation of tax reports, or other associated costs; 

(3) the capability of financial institutions or lawyers to calculate and pay income to 
individual clients or third persons; and 

(4) any other circumstances that affect the ability of the funds to earn a net return 
for the client or third person. 

(f) A lawyer may deposit the lawyer’s own funds in a client trust account only in an 
amount reasonably necessary to pay financial institution service charges or fees or 
to obtain a waiver of service charges or fees. 

(g) Legal fees and expenses that have been paid in advance shall be deposited in a 
client  trust  account  and  may  be  withdrawn  only  as  fees  are  earned  or  expenses 
incurred. 

(h)  No  interest  or  dividends  from  the  client  trust  account  shall  be  available  to  the 
lawyer. 

(i) The lawyer shall direct the eligible institution to: 

(1)  remit  the  interest  and  dividends  from  an  IOLTA  account,  less  allowable 
reasonable fees, if any, to the Michigan State Bar Foundation at least quarterly; 

(2) transmit with each remittance a report that shall identify each lawyer for whom 
the  remittance  is  sent,  the  amount  of  remittance  attributable  to  each  IOLTA 
account, the rate and type of interest or dividends applied, the amount of interest or 
dividends  earned,  the  amount  and  type  of  fees  deducted,  if  any,  and  the  average 
account balance for the period in which the report is made; and 

(3) transmit to the depositing lawyer a report in accordance with normal procedures 
for reporting to its depositors. 

(j)  A  lawyer’s  good-faith  decision  regarding  the  deposit  or  holding  of  such  funds  in 
an IOLTA account is not reviewable by a disciplinary body.  A lawyer shall review 
the  IOLTA  account  at  reasonable  intervals  to  determine  whether  changed 
circumstances  require  the  funds  to  be  deposited  prospectively  in  a  non-IOLTA 
account.

Comment:  

A  lawyer  should  hold  property  of  others  with  the  care  required  of  a  professional 
fiduciary.  Securities should be kept in a safe deposit box, except when some other 
form  of  safekeeping  is  warranted  by  special  circumstances.    All  property  which  is 
the property of a client or a third person should be kept separate from the lawyer’s 
business  and  personal  property  and,  if  funds,  should  be  kept  in  one  or  more  trust 
accounts.    Separate  trust  accounts  may  be  warranted  when  administering  estate 
funds or acting in similar fiduciary capacities. 

 
Lawyers often receive from third persons funds from which the lawyer’s fee 
will be paid.  If there is risk that the client may divert the funds without paying the 
fee, the lawyer is not required to remit the portion from which the fee is to be paid.  
However, a lawyer may not hold funds to coerce a client into accepting the lawyer’s 
contention.    The  disputed  portion  of  the  funds  should  be  kept  in  trust  and  the 
lawyer  should  suggest  means  for  prompt  resolution  of  the  dispute,  such  as 
arbitration.  The undisputed portion of the funds shall be promptly distributed. 

 
A  third  person,  such  as  a  client’s  creditors,  may  have  a  just  claim  against 
funds  or  other  property  in  a  lawyer’s  custody.    A  lawyer  may  have  a  duty  under 
applicable law to protect such a third-party claim against wrongful interference by 
the  client,  and  accordingly  may  refuse  to  surrender  the  property  to  the  client.  
However,  a  lawyer  should  not  unilaterally  assume  to  arbitrate  a  dispute  between 
the client and the third person. 

 
The obligations of a lawyer under this rule are independent of those arising 
from activity other than rendering legal services.  For example, a lawyer who serves 
as  an  escrow  agent  is  governed  by  the  applicable  law  relating  to  fiduciaries  even 
though the lawyer does not render legal services in the transaction. 

Rule 1.15A.  Trust Account Overdraft Notification. 

(a) Scope.  Lawyers who practice law in this jurisdiction shall deposit all funds held 
in trust in accordance with Rule 1.15.  Funds held in trust include funds held in any 
fiduciary  capacity  in  connection  with  a  representation,  whether  as  trustee,  agent, 
guardian, executor or otherwise. 

(1)  “Lawyer”  includes  a  law  firm  or  other  organization  with  which  a  lawyer  is 
professionally associated. 

(2)  For  any  trust  account  which  is  an  IOLTA  account  pursuant  to  Rule  1.15,  the 
“Notice  to  Eligible  Financial  Institution”  shall  constitute  notice  to  the  depository 
institution that such account is subject to this rule.  Lawyers shall clearly identify 
any other accounts in which funds are held in trust as “trust” or “escrow” accounts, 
and  lawyers  must  inform  the  depository  institution  in  writing  that  such  other 
accounts are trust accounts for the purposes of this rule. 

(b)  Overdraft  Notification  Agreement  Required.    In  addition  to  meeting  the 
requirements  of  Rule  1.15,  each  bank,  credit  union,  savings  and  loan  association, 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

47 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

savings  bank,  or  open-end  investment  company  registered  with  the  Securities  and 
Exchange  Commission  (hereinafter  “financial  institution”)  referred  to  in  Rule  1.15 
must be approved by the State Bar of Michigan in order to serve as a depository for 
lawyer  trust  accounts.    To  apply  for  approval,  financial  institutions  must  file  with 
the State Bar of Michigan a signed agreement, in a form provided by the State Bar 
of Michigan, that it will submit the reports required in paragraph (d) of this rule to 
the  Grievance  Administrator  and  the  trust  account  holder  when  any  properly 
payable  instrument  is  presented  against  a  lawyer  trust  account  containing 
insufficient funds or when any other debit to such account would create a negative 
balance in the account, whether or not the instrument or other debit is honored and 
irrespective of any overdraft protection or other similar privileges that may attach 
to such account.  The agreement shall apply to the financial institution for all of its 
locations in Michigan and cannot be canceled except on 120 days notice in writing to 
the  State  Bar  of  Michigan.    Upon  notice  of  cancellation  or  termination  of  the 
agreement, the financial institution must notify all holders of trust accounts subject 
to the provisions of this rule at least 90 days before termination of approved status 
that the financial institution will no longer be approved to hold such trust accounts. 

(c)  The  State  Bar  of  Michigan  shall  establish  guidelines  regarding  the  process  of 
approving  and  terminating  “approved  status”  for  financial  institutions,  and  for 
other  operational  procedures  to  effectuate  this  rule  in  consultation  with  the 
Grievance  Administrator.    The  State  Bar  of  Michigan  shall  periodically  publish  a 
list of approved financial institutions.  No trust account shall be maintained in any 
financial  institution  that  has  not  been  so  approved.    Approved  status  under  this 
rule does not substitute for “eligible financial institution” status under Rule 1.15. 

(d)  Overdraft  Reports.    The  overdraft  notification agreement  must  provide  that  all 
reports made by the financial institution contain the following information in a form 
acceptable to the State Bar of Michigan: 

(1) The identity of the financial institution 

(2) The identity of the account holder 

(3) The account number 

(4) Information identifying the transaction item 

(5)  The  amount  and  date  of  the  overdraft  and  either  the  amount  of  the  returned 
instrument  or  other  dishonored  debit  to  the  account  and  the  date  returned  or 
dishonored, or the date of presentation for payment and the date paid. 

The financial institution must provide the information required by the notification 
agreement  within  five  banking  days  after  the  date  the  item  was  paid  or  returned 
unpaid. 

(e)  Costs.    The  overdraft  notification  agreement  must  provide  that  a  financial 
institution  is  not  prohibited  from  charging  the  lawyer  for  the  reasonable  cost  of 
providing the reports and records required by this rule, but those costs may not be 
charged  against  principal,  nor  against  interest  or  dividends  earned  on  trust

accounts, including earnings on IOLTA accounts payable to the Michigan State Bar 
Foundation under Rule 1.15.  Such costs, if charged, shall not be borne by clients. 

(f)  Notification  by  Lawyers.    Every  lawyer  who  receives  notification  that  any 
instrument  presented  against  the  trust  account  was  presented  against  insufficient 
funds or that any other debit to such account would create a negative balance in the 
account,  whether  or  not  the  instrument  or  other  debit  was  honored,  shall,  upon 
receipt of a request for investigation from the Grievance Administrator, provide the 
Grievance Administrator, in writing, within 21 days after issuance of such request, 
a full and fair explanation of the cause of the overdraft and how it was corrected. 

(g)  Every  lawyer  practicing  or  admitted  to  practice  in  this  jurisdiction  shall,  as  a 
condition  thereof,  be  conclusively  deemed  to  have  consented  to  the  requirements 
mandated  by  this  rule  and  shall  be  deemed  to  have  consented  under  applicable 
privacy laws, including but not limited to those of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15 
USC 6801, to the reporting of information required by this rule. 

Rule 1.16.  Declining or Terminating Representation. 

(a) Except as stated in paragraph (c), a lawyer shall not represent a client or, where 
representation  has  commenced,  shall  withdraw  from  the  representation  of  a  client 
if:  

(1) the representation will result in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct or 
other law;  

(2) the lawyer’s physical or mental condition materially impairs the lawyer’s ability 
to represent the client; or  

(3) the lawyer is discharged.  

(b)  Except  as  stated  in  paragraph  (c),  after  informing  the  client  that  the  lawyer 
cannot  do  so  without  permission  from  the  tribunal  for  the  pending  case,  a  lawyer 
may  withdraw  from  representing  a  client  if  withdrawal  can  be  accomplished 
without material adverse effect on the interests of the client, or if:  

(1)  the  client  persists  in  a  course  of  action  involving  the lawyer’s  services  that  the 
lawyer reasonably believes is criminal or fraudulent;  

(2) the client has used the lawyer’s services to perpetrate a crime or fraud;  

(3)  the  client  insists  upon  pursuing  an  objective  that  the  lawyer  considers 
repugnant or imprudent;  

(4)  the  client  fails  substantially  to  fulfill  an  obligation  to  the lawyer  regarding  the 
lawyer’s  services  and  has  been  given  reasonable  warning  that  the  lawyer  will 
withdraw unless the obligation is fulfilled;  

(5) the representation will result in an unreasonable financial burden on the lawyer 
or has been rendered unreasonably difficult by the client; or  

(6) other good cause for withdrawal exists.  

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

49 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

(c)  When  ordered  to  do  so  by  a  tribunal,  a  lawyer  shall  continue  representation 
notwithstanding good cause for terminating the representation.  

(d)  Upon  termination  of  representation,  a  lawyer  shall  take  reasonable  steps  to 
protect  a  client’s  interests,  such  as  giving  reasonable  notice  to  the  client,  allowing 
time  for  employment  of  other  counsel,  surrendering  papers  and  property  to  which 
the client is entitled, and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been 
earned.  The lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent permitted 
by law.  

A  lawyer  should  not  accept  representation  in  a  matter  unless  it  can  be  performed 
competently, promptly, without improper conflict of interest and to completion. 

Comment:  

Mandatory Withdrawal. 

A  lawyer  ordinarily  must  decline  or  withdraw  from  representation  if  the  client 
demands  that  the  lawyer  engage  in  conduct  that  is  illegal  or  violates  the  Rules  of 
Professional Conduct or other law.  The lawyer is not obliged to decline or withdraw 
simply because the client suggests such a course of conduct; a client may make such 
a  suggestion  in  the  hope  that  a  lawyer  will  not  be  constrained  by  a  professional 
obligation.  

When  a  lawyer  has  been  appointed  to  represent  a  client,  withdrawal  ordinarily 
requires approval of the appointing authority.  See also Rule 6.2.  Difficulty may be 
encountered if withdrawal is based on the client’s demand that the lawyer engage in 
unprofessional  conduct.    The  court  may  wish  an  explanation  for  the  withdrawal, 
while the lawyer may be bound to keep confidential the facts that would constitute 
such  an  explanation.    The  lawyer’s  statement  that  professional  considerations 
require  termination  of  the  representation  ordinarily  should  be  accepted  as 
sufficient.  

Discharge. 

A  client  has  a  right  to  discharge  a  lawyer  at  any  time,  with  or  without  cause, 
subject  to  liability  for  payment  for  the  lawyer’s  services.    Where  future  dispute 
about the withdrawal may be anticipated, it may be advisable to prepare a written 
statement reciting the circumstances.  

Whether a client can discharge appointed counsel may depend on applicable law.  A 
client seeking to do so should be given a full explanation of the consequences.  These 
consequences may include a decision by the appointing authority that appointment 
of successor counsel is unjustified, thus requiring the client to represent himself.  

If  the  client  is  mentally  incompetent,  the  client  may  lack  the  legal  capacity  to 
discharge  the  lawyer,  and  in  any  event  the  discharge  may  be  seriously  adverse  to 
the  client’s  interests.    The  lawyer  should  make  special  effort  to  help  the  client 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

50 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

consider  the  consequences  and,  in  an  extreme  case,  may  initiate  proceedings  for  a 
conservatorship or similar protection of the client.  See Rule 1.14.  

Optional Withdrawal. 

A  lawyer  may  withdraw  from  representation  in  some  circumstances.    The  lawyer 
has the option to withdraw if it can be accomplished without material adverse effect 
on  the  client’s  interests.    Withdrawal  is  also  justified  if  the  client  persists  in  a 
course  of  action  that  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  is  illegal  or  fraudulent,  for  a 
lawyer is not required to be associated with such conduct even if the lawyer does not 
further it.  Withdrawal is also permitted if the lawyer’s services were misused in the 
past  even  if  that  would  materially  prejudice  the  client.    The  lawyer  also  may 
withdraw where the client insists on a repugnant or imprudent objective.  

A lawyer may withdraw if the client refuses to abide by the terms of an agreement 
relating to the representation, such as an agreement concerning fees or court costs, 
or an agreement limiting the objectives of the representation.  

Assisting the Client Upon Withdrawal. 

Even  if  the  lawyer  has  been  unfairly  discharged  by  the  client, a  lawyer  must  take 
all  reasonable  steps  to  mitigate  the  consequences  to  the  client.    The  lawyer  may 
retain papers as security for a fee only to the extent permitted by law.  

Whether  a  lawyer  for  an  organization  may  under  certain  unusual  circumstances 
have a legal obligation to the organization after withdrawing or being discharged by 
the organization’s highest authority is beyond the scope of these rules.  

Rule 1.17.  Sale of a Law Practice. 

(a)  A  lawyer  or  a  law  firm  may  sell  or  purchase  a  private  law  practice,  including 
good will, pursuant to this rule.  

(b)  The  fees  charged  clients  shall  not  be  increased  by  reason  of  the  sale,  and  a 
purchaser  shall  not  pass  on  the  cost  of  good  will  to  a  client.    The  purchaser  may, 
however,  refuse  to  undertake  the  representation  unless  the  client  consents  to  pay 
fees regularly charged by the purchaser for rendering substantially similar services 
to other clients prior to the initiation of the purchase negotiations.  

(c) Actual written notice of a pending sale shall be given at least 91 days prior to the 
date of the sale to each of the seller’s clients, and the notice shall include:  

(1) notice of the fact of the proposed sale;  

(2) the identity of the purchaser;  

(3)  the  terms  of  any  proposed  change  in  the  fee  agreement  permitted  under 
paragraph (b);  

(4) notice of the client’s right to retain other counsel or to take possession of the file; 
and  

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

51 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

(5) notice that the client’s consent to the transfer of the client’s file to the purchaser 
will  be  presumed  if  the  client  does  not  retain  other  counsel  or  otherwise  object 
within 90 days of receipt of the notice.  

If the purchaser has identified a conflict of interest that the client cannot waive and 
that  prohibits  the  purchaser  from  undertaking  the  client’s  matter,  the  notice  shall 
advise that the client should retain substitute counsel to assume the representation 
and arrange to have the substitute counsel contact the seller.  

(d)  If  a  client  cannot  be  given  actual  notice  as  required  in  paragraph  (c),  the 
representation of that client may be transferred to the purchaser only upon entry of 
an  order  so  authorizing  by  a  judge  of  the  judicial  circuit  in  which  the  seller 
maintains  the  practice.    The  seller  or  the  purchaser  may  disclose  to  the  judge  in 
camera  information  relating  to  the  representation  only  to  the  extent  necessary  to 
obtain an order authorizing the transfer of a file. 

(e)  The  sale  of  the  good  will  of  a  law  practice  may  be  conditioned  upon  the  seller 
ceasing  to  engage  in  the  private  practice  of  law  for  a  reasonable  period  of  time 
within the geographical area in which the practice had been conducted.  

Comment:  

This  rule  permits  a  selling  lawyer  or  law  firm  to  obtain  compensation  for  the 
reasonable  value  of  a  private  law  practice  in  the  same  manner  as  withdrawing 
partners  of  law  firms.    See  MRPC  5.4  and  5.6.    This  rule  does  not  apply  to  the 
transfer of responsibility for legal representation from one lawyer or firm to another 
when such transfers are unrelated to the sale of a practice; for transfer of individual 
files in other circumstances, see MRPC 1.5(e) and 1.16.  Admission to or retirement 
from  a  law  partnership  or  professional  association,  retirement  plans  and  similar 
arrangements,  and  a  sale  of  tangible  assets  of  a  law  practice,  do  not  constitute  a 
sale or purchase governed by this rule. 

A  lawyer  participating  in  the  sale  of  a  law  practice  is  subject  to  the  ethical 
standards  that  apply  when  involving  another  lawyer  in  the  representation  of  a 
client.    These  include,  for  example,  the  seller’s  obligation  to  act  competently  in 
identifying a purchaser qualified to assume the representation of the client and the 
purchaser’s obligation to undertake the representation competently, MRPC 1.1, the 
obligation  to  avoid  disqualifying  conflicts  and  to  secure  client  consent  after 
consultation for those conflicts that can be waived, MRPC 1.7, and the obligation to 
protect information relating to the representation, MRPC 1.6 and 1.9.  

If approval of the substitution of the purchasing attorney for the selling attorney is 
required  by  the  rules  of  any  tribunal  in  which  a  matter  is  pending,  such  approval 
must  be  obtained  before  the  matter  can  be  included  in  the  sale,  MRPC  1.16.    See 
also MCR 2.117(C).  

All  the  elements  of  client  autonomy,  including  the  client’s  absolute  right  to 
discharge  a  lawyer  and  transfer  the  representation  to  another,  survive  the  sale  of 
the practice.  

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

52 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

Selling Entire Practice. 

When  a  lawyer  is  closing  a  private  practice,  the  lawyer  may  negotiate  with  a 
purchaser  for  the  reasonable  value  of  the  practice  that  has  been  developed  by  the 
seller.    A  seller  may  agree  to  transfer  matters  in  one  legal  field  to  one  purchaser, 
while transferring matters in another legal field to a separate purchaser.  However, 
a lawyer may not sell individual files piecemeal.  A seller closing a practice to accept 
employment with another firm may take certain matters to the new employer while 
selling the remainder of the practice.  

Although  the  rule  contemplates  the  sale  of  substantially  all  of  the  law  practice,  a 
seller  retiring  from  private  practice  generally  may  continue  to  represent  a  small 
number of clients while transferring the balance of the practice.  

The  seller  remains  responsible  for  handling  all  client  matters  until  the  files  are 
transferred under this rule.  

Termination of Practice by the Seller. 

The  rule  allows  the  parties  to  agree  that  the  seller  cease  practice  in  the 
geographical  area  for  a  reasonable  time  as  a  condition  of  the  sale.    In  certain 
situations, a blanket prohibition on the seller’s practice would not be appropriate or 
warranted,  such  as  a  judicial  appointee  who  might  subsequently  be  defeated  for 
reelection, or a seller elected full-time prosecutor.  The parties should be allowed to 
negotiate,  for  instance,  whether  any  geographical  or  duration  restrictions  apply  to 
the  seller’s  employment  as  a  lawyer  on  the  staff  of  a  public  agency  or  of  a  legal 
services  entity  that  provides  legal  services  to  the  poor,  or  as  inside  counsel  to  a 
business.  

Conflicts. 

The  practice  may  be sold  to  one  or  more lawyers  or  firms,  provided  that  the  seller 
assures that all clients are afforded competent representation.  Since the number of 
client  matters  and  their  nature  directly  bear  on  the  valuation  of  good  will  and 
therefore directly relate to selling the law practice, conflicts that cannot be waived 
by  the  client  and  that  prevent  the  prospective  purchaser  from  undertaking  the 
client’s matter should be determined promptly.  If the purchaser identifies a conflict 
that the client cannot waive, information should be provided to the client to assist 
in  locating  substitute  counsel.    If  the  conflict  can  be  waived  by  the  client,  the 
purchaser  should  explain  the  implications  and  determine  whether  the  client 
consents  to  the  purchaser  undertaking  the  representation.    Initial  screening  with 
regard to conflicts, for the purpose of determining the good will of the practice, need 
be  no  more  intrusive  than  conflict  screening  of  a  walk-in  prospective  client  at  the 
purchaser’s firm.

Client Confidences, Consent, and Notice. 

Negotiations  between  the  seller  and  prospective  purchaser  prior  to  disclosure  of 
information  relating  to  a  specific  representation  of  an  identifiable  client  can  be 
conducted in a manner that does not violate the confidentiality provisions of MRPC 
1.6,  just  as  preliminary  discussions  are  permissible  concerning  the  possible 
association of another lawyer or mergers between firms, with respect to which client 
consent  is  not  required.    Providing  the  purchaser  access  to  client-specific 
information  relating  to  the  representation  and  to  the  file,  however,  requires  client 
consent.    The  rule  provides  that  before  such  information  can  be  disclosed  by  the 
seller to the purchaser the client must be given actual written notice of the fact of 
the  contemplated  sale,  including  the  identity  of  the  purchaser,  and  must  be  told 
that  the  decision  to  consent  or  make  other  arrangements  must  be  made  within  90 
days.  If nothing is heard from the client within that time, consent to the transfer of 
the client’s file to the identified purchaser is presumed.  

A  lawyer  or  law  firm  ceasing  to  practice  cannot  be  required  to  remain  in  practice 
because some clients cannot be given actual notice of the proposed purchase.  Since 
these  clients  are  not  available  to  consent  to  the  purchase  or  direct  any  other 
disposition  of  their  files,  the  rule  requires  an  order  from  a  judge  of  the  judicial 
circuit in which the seller maintains the practice, authorizing their transfer or other 
disposition.    The  court  can  be  expected  to  determine  whether  reasonable  efforts  to 
locate  the  client  have  been  exhausted,  and  whether  the  absent  client’s  legitimate 
interests will be served by authorizing the transfer of the file so that the purchaser 
may  continue  the  representation.    Preservation  of  client  confidences  requires  that 
the petition for a court order be considered in camera.  

The client should be told the identity of the purchaser before being asked to consent 
to disclosure of confidences and secrets or to consent to transfer of the file.  

MCR  9.119(G)  provides  a  mechanism  for  handling  client  matters  when  a  lawyer 
dies and there is no one else at the firm to take responsibility for the file.  

Fee Arrangements between Client and Purchaser. 

Paragraph (b) is intended to prohibit a purchaser from charging the former clients 
of  the  seller  a  higher  fee  than  the  purchaser  is  charging  the  purchaser’s  existing 
clients.  The sale may not be financed by increases in fees charged the clients of the 
practice  that  is  purchased.   Existing  agreements  between  the  seller  and  the  client 
as to fees and the scope of the work must be honored by the purchaser, unless the 
client consents after consultation.  

Adjustments  for  differences  in  the  fee  schedules  of  the  seller  and  the  purchaser 
should  be  made  between  the  seller  and  purchaser  in  valuing  good  will,  and  not 
between  the  client  and  the  purchaser.    The  purchaser  may,  however,  advise  the 
client  that  the  purchaser  will  not  undertake  the  representation  unless  the  client 
consents  to  pay  the  higher  fees  the  purchaser  usually  charges.    To  prevent  client 
financing of the sale, the higher fee the purchaser may charge must not exceed the

fees charged by the purchaser for substantially similar service rendered prior to the 
initiation of the purchase negotiations.  

Deceased Lawyer. 

Even though a nonlawyer seller representing the estate of a deceased lawyer is not 
subject to the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct, a lawyer who participates in 
a sale of a law practice must conform to this rule.  Therefore, the purchasing lawyer 
can be expected to see that its requirements are met.  

Rule 1.18.  Duties to Prospective Client. 

(a)  A  person  who  consults  with  a  lawyer  about  the  possibility  of  forming  a  client-
lawyer relationship with respect to a matter is a prospective client. 

(b)  Even  when  no  client-lawyer  relationship  ensues,  a  lawyer  who  has  learned 
information  from  a  prospective  client  shall  not  use  or  reveal  that  information, 
except as Rule 1.9 would permit with respect to information of a former client. 

(c)  A  lawyer  subject  to  paragraph  (b)  shall  not  represent  a  client  with  interests 
materially  adverse  to  those  of  a  prospective  client  in  the  same  or  a  substantially 
related  matter  if  the  lawyer  received  information  from  the  prospective  client  that 
could  be  significantly  harmful  to  that  person  in  the  matter,  except  as  provided  in 
paragraph (d).  If a lawyer is disqualified from representation under this paragraph, 
no lawyer in a firm with which that lawyer is associated may knowingly undertake 
or continue representation in such a matter, except as provided in paragraph (d). 

(d)  When  the  lawyer  has  received  disqualifying  information  as  defined  in 
paragraph (c), representation is permissible if: 

(1) both the affected client and the prospective client have given informed consent, 
confirmed in writing, or:  

(2)  the  lawyer  who  received  the  information  took  reasonable  measures  to  avoid 
exposure  to  more  disqualifying  information  than  was  reasonably  necessary  to 
determine whether to represent the prospective client; and  

(i)  the  disqualified  lawyer  is  timely  screened  from  any  participation  in  the  matter 
and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and  

(ii) written notice is promptly given to the prospective client. 

Comment:  

Prospective  clients,  like  clients,  may  disclose  information  to  a  lawyer,  place 
documents or other property in the lawyer’s custody, or rely on the lawyer’s advice.  
A  lawyer’s  consultations  with  a  prospective  client  usually  are  limited  in  time  and 
depth  and  leave  both  the  prospective  client  and  the  lawyer  free  (and  sometimes 
required) to proceed no further.  Hence, prospective clients should receive some but 
not all of the protection afforded clients.  

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct

A  person  becomes  a  prospective  client  by  consulting  with  a  lawyer  about  the 
possibility  of  forming  a  client-lawyer  relationship  with  respect  to  a  matter.  
Whether  communications,  including  written,  oral,  or  electronic  communications, 
  For  example,  a 
constitute  a  consultation  depends  on  the  circumstances. 
consultation  is  likely to  have  occurred  if  a  lawyer,  either  in  person  or  through  the 
lawyer’s advertising in any medium, specifically requests or invites the submission 
of  information  about  a  potential  representation  without  clear  and  reasonably 
understandable  warnings  and  cautionary  statements  that  limit  the  lawyer’s 
obligations,  and  a  person  provides  information  in  response.    In  contrast,  a 
consultation does not occur if a person provides information to a lawyer in response 
to  advertising  that  merely  describes  the  lawyer’s  education,  experience,  areas  of 
practice, and contact information, or provides legal information of general interest.  
Such  a  person  communicates  information  unilaterally  to  a  lawyer,  without  any 
reasonable  expectation  that  the  lawyer  is  willing  to  discuss  the  possibility  of 
forming  a  client-lawyer  relationship,  and  is  thus  not  a  “prospective  client.”  
Moreover,  a  person  who  communicates  with  a  lawyer  for  the  purpose  of 
disqualifying the lawyer is not a “prospective client.”  

It  is  often  necessary  for  a  prospective  client  to  reveal  information  to  the  lawyer 
during  an  initial  consultation  prior  to  the  decision  about  formation  of  a  client-
lawyer  relationship.    The  lawyer  often  must  learn  such  information  to  determine 
whether  there  is  a  conflict  of  interest  with  an  existing  client  and  whether  the 
matter is one that the lawyer is willing to undertake.  Paragraph (b) prohibits the 
lawyer  from  using  or  revealing  that  information,  except  as  permitted  by  Rule  1.9, 
even if the client or lawyer decides not to proceed with the representation.  The duty 
exists  regardless  of  how  brief  the  initial  conference  may  be.    In  order  to  avoid 
acquiring disqualifying information from a prospective client, a lawyer considering 
whether  or  not  to  undertake  a  new  matter  should  limit  the  initial  consultation  to 
only such information as reasonably appears necessary for that purpose.  Where the 
information  indicates  that  a  conflict  of  interest  or  other  reason  for  non-
representation exists, the lawyer should so inform the prospective client or decline 
the  representation.    If  the  prospective  client  wishes  to  retain  the  lawyer,  and  if 
consent is possible under Rule 1.7, then consent from all affected present or former 
clients must be obtained before accepting the representation.  

A  lawyer  may  condition  a  consultation  with  a  prospective  client  on  the  person’s 
informed consent that no information disclosed during the consultation will prohibit 
the  lawyer  from  representing  a  different  client  in  the  matter.    If  the  agreement 
expressly  so  provides,  the  prospective  client  may  also  consent  to  the  lawyer’s 
subsequent use of information received from the prospective client.  

Even  in  the  absence  of  an  agreement,  under  paragraph  (c),  the  lawyer  is  not 
prohibited  from  representing  a  client  with  interests  adverse  to  those  of  the 
prospective  client  in  the  same  or  a  substantially  related  matter  unless  the  lawyer 
has  received  from  the  prospective  client  information  that  could  be  significantly 
harmful if used in the matter.  

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct

Under  paragraph  (c),  the  prohibition  in  this  Rule  is  imputed  to  other  lawyers  as 
provided in Rule 1.10, but, under paragraph (d)(l), imputation may be avoided if the 
lawyer  obtains  the  informed  consent,  confirmed  in  writing,  of  both  the  prospective 
and affected clients.  In the alternative, imputation may be avoided if the conditions 
of  paragraph  (d)(2)  are  met  and  all  disqualified  lawyers  are  timely  screened  and 
written notice is promptly given to the prospective client.  Paragraph (d)(2)(i) does 
not  prohibit  the  screened  lawyer  from  receiving  a  salary  or  partnership  share 
established  by  prior  independent  agreement,  but  that  lawyer  may  not  receive 
compensation directly related to the matter in which the lawyer is disqualified.  

Notice, including a general description of the subject matter about which the lawyer 
was consulted, and of the screening procedures employed, generally should be given 
as soon as practicable after the need for screening becomes apparent. 

Rule 1.19.  Lawyer-Client Representation Agreements: Arbitration 
Provisions 

A lawyer shall not enter into an agreement for legal services with a client requiring 
that any dispute between the lawyer and the client be subject to arbitration unless 
the client provides informed consent in writing to the arbitration provision, which is 
based on being 

(a)  reasonably informed in writing regarding the scope and the advantages and 

disadvantages of the arbitration provision, or  

(b)  independently represented in making the agreement.  

Comment: 

MRPC  1.19  is  designed  to  ensure  that  a  client  entering  into  an  arbitration 
agreement with a lawyer has sufficient information to make an informed decision or 
is independently represented by counsel in making the agreement.  This paragraph 
applies to agreements entered into at the onset of an attorney-client relationship as 
well  as  to  agreements  entered  into  during  the  course  of  the  attorney-client 
relationship.   

In  order  to  ensure  that  client  consent  to  an  arbitration  provision  is  informed 
consent,  at  a  minimum  the  agreement  should  advise  the  client  of  the  practical 
advantages and disadvantages of arbitration.  Inclusion of the following information 
is presumed to be sufficient to enable a client to give informed consent: 

 

 

(1) By agreeing to arbitration, the client is 

 

(a)  waiving the right to a jury trial,  

(b) potentially waiving the right to take discovery to the same extent as 
is available in a case litigated in a court,   

(c)  waiving  or  limiting  the  right  to  appeal  the  result  of  the  arbitration 
proceeding to specific circumstances established by law, and   

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

57 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

(d)  agreeing  to  be  financially  responsible  for  at  least  a  share  of  the 
arbitrator’s  compensation  and  the  administrative  fees  associated  with 
the arbitration;   

(2)  whether  the  agreement  to  arbitrate  includes  arbitration  of  legal 
malpractice claims against the lawyer;   

(3)  identification  of  the  organization  or  person(s)  that  will  administer  the 
arbitration;   

(4) if the client declines to agree to arbitration at the onset of the attorney-
client relationship, there is no prohibition against the lawyer and the client 
agreeing to arbitrate the matter at a later date;   

(5) arbitration may be conducted as a private proceeding, unlike litigation in 
a court;   

(6)  the  parties  can  select  an  arbitrator  who  is  experienced  in  the  subject 
matter of the dispute;   

(7)  depending  on  the  circumstances,  arbitration  can  be  more  efficient, 
expeditious and inexpensive than litigation in a court; and  

(8)  the  client’s  ability  to  report  unethical  conduct  by  the  lawyer  is  not 
restricted. 

RULES 2.1–2.4.  COUNSELOR.  

Rule 2.1.  Advisor. 

In representing a client, a lawyer shall exercise independent professional judgment 
and shall render candid advice.  In rendering advice, a lawyer may refer not only to 
law but to other considerations such as moral, economic, social, and political factors 
that may be relevant to the client’s situation.  

Comment: 

Scope of Advice. 

A  client  is  entitled  to  straightforward  advice  expressing  the  lawyer’s  honest 
assessment.    Legal  advice  often  involves  unpleasant  facts  and  alternatives  that  a 
client  may  be  disinclined  to  confront.   In  presenting  advice,  a lawyer  endeavors  to 
sustain  the  client’s  morale  and  may  put  advice  in  as  acceptable  a  form  as  honesty 
permits.  However, a lawyer should not be deterred from giving candid advice by the 
prospect that the advice will be unpalatable to the client.  

Advice couched in narrowly legal terms may be of little value to a client, especially 
where  practical  considerations,  such  as  cost  or  effects  on  other  people,  are 
predominant. 
  Purely  technical  legal  advice,  therefore,  can  sometimes  be 
inadequate.    It  is  proper  for  a  lawyer  to  refer  to  relevant  moral  and  ethical 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

58 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

considerations in giving advice.  Although a lawyer is not a moral advisor as such, 
moral  and  ethical  considerations  impinge  upon  most  legal  questions  and  may 
decisively influence how the law will be applied.  

A  client  may  expressly  or  impliedly  ask  the  lawyer  for  purely  technical  advice.  
When  such  a  request  is  made  by  a  client  experienced  in  legal  matters,  the  lawyer 
may accept it at face value.  When such a request is made by a client inexperienced 
in  legal  matters,  however,  the  lawyer’s  responsibility  as  advisor  may  include 
indicating that more is involved than strictly legal considerations.  

Matters that go beyond strictly legal questions may also be in the domain of another

profession. 
competence of psychiatry, clinical psychology, or social work; business matters can 
involve problems within the competence of the accounting profession or of financial 
specialists.    Where  consultation  with  a  professional  in  another  field  is  itself 
something  a  competent  lawyer  would  recommend,  the  lawyer  should  make  such  a 
recommendation.    At  the  same  time,  a  lawyer’s  advice  at  its  best  often  consists  of 
recommending  a  course  of  action  in  the  face  of  conflicting  recommendations  of 
experts.  

Offering Advice. 

In  general,  a  lawyer  is  not  expected  to  give  advice  until  asked  by  the  client.  
However,  when  a  lawyer  knows  that  a  client  proposes  a  course  of  action  that  is 
likely  to  result  in  substantial  adverse  legal  consequences  to  the  client,  the  duty  to 
the  client  under  Rule  1.4  may  require  that  the  lawyer  act  if  the  client’s  course  of 
action is related to the representation.  A lawyer ordinarily has no duty to initiate 
investigation  of  a  client’s  affairs  or  to  give  advice  that  the  client  has  indicated  is 
unwanted, but a lawyer may initiate advice to a client when doing so appears to be 
in the client’s interest.  

Rule 2.2.  Intermediary. 

(a) A lawyer may act as intermediary between clients if:  

(1) the lawyer consults with each client concerning the implications of the common 
representation,  including  the  advantages  and  risks  involved  and  the  effect  on  the 
client-lawyer  privileges,  and  obtains  each  client’s  consent  to  the  common 
representation;  

(2)  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  that  the  matter  can  be  resolved  on  terms 
compatible  with  the  clients’  best  interests,  that  each  client  will  be  able  to  make 
adequately informed decisions in the matter, and that there is little risk of material 
prejudice  to  the  interests  of  any  of  the  clients  if  the  contemplated  resolution  is 
unsuccessful; and  

(3)  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  that  the  common  representation  can  be 
undertaken  impartially  and  without  improper  effect  on  other  responsibilities  the 
lawyer has to any of the clients.  

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

59 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

(b)  While  acting  as  intermediary,  the  lawyer  shall  consult  with  each  client 
concerning  the  decisions  to  be  made  and  the  considerations  relevant  in  making 
them, so that each client can make adequately informed decisions.  

(c)  A  lawyer  shall  withdraw  as  intermediary  if  any  of  the  clients  so  requests,  or  if 
any  of  the  conditions  stated  in  paragraph  (a)  is  no  longer  satisfied.    Upon 
withdrawal,  the  lawyer  shall  not  continue  to  represent  any  of  the  clients  in  the 
matter that was the subject of the intermediation.  

Comment:  

A  lawyer  acts  as  intermediary  under  this  rule  when  the  lawyer  represents  two  or 
more  parties  with  potentially  conflicting  interests.    A  key  factor  in  defining  the 
relationship is whether the parties share responsibility for the lawyer’s fee, but the 
common  representation  may  be  inferred  from  other  circumstances.    Because 
confusion  can  arise  as  to  the  lawyer’s  role  where  each  party  is  not  separately 
represented, it is important that the lawyer make clear the relationship. 

The  rule  does  not  apply  to  a  lawyer  acting  as  arbitrator  or  mediator  between  or 
among  parties  who  are  not  clients  of  the  lawyer,  even  where  the  lawyer  has  been 
appointed with the concurrence of the parties.  In performing such a role the lawyer 
may  be  subject  to  applicable  codes  of  ethics,  such  as  the  Code  of  Ethics  for 
Arbitration in Commercial Disputes prepared by a joint committee of the American 
Bar Association and the American Arbitration Association.  

A  lawyer  acts  as  intermediary  in  seeking  to  establish  or  adjust  a  relationship 
between  clients  on  an  amicable  and  mutually  advantageous  basis,  for  example,  in 
helping  to  organize  a  business  in  which  two  or  more  clients  are  entrepreneurs, 
working  out  the  financial  reorganization  of  an  enterprise  in  which  two  or  more 
clients  have  an  interest,  arranging  a  property  distribution  in  settlement  of  an 
estate,  or  mediating  a  dispute  between  clients.    The  lawyer  seeks  to  resolve 
potentially  conflicting  interests  by  developing  the  parties’  mutual  interests.    The 
alternative can be that each party may have to obtain separate representation, with 
the possibility in some situations of incurring additional cost, complication, or even 
litigation.    Given  these  and  other  relevant  factors,  all  the  clients  may  prefer  that 
the lawyer act as intermediary.  

In  considering  whether  to  act as  intermediary between  clients, a  lawyer  should be 
mindful  that  if  the  intermediation  fails  the  result  can  be  additional  cost, 
embarrassment, and recrimination.  In some situations the risk of failure is so great 
that intermediation is plainly impossible.  For example, a lawyer cannot undertake 
common representation of clients between whom contentious litigation is imminent 
or  who  contemplate  contentious  negotiations.    More  generally,  if  the  relationship 
between  the  parties  has  already  assumed  definite  antagonism,  the  possibility  that 
the clients’ interests can be adjusted by intermediation ordinarily is not very good.  

The  appropriateness  of  intermediation  can  depend  on  its  form.    Forms  of 
intermediation  include  informal  arbitration  (where  each  client’s  case  is  presented 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

60 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

by  the  respective  client  and  the  lawyer  decides  the  outcome),  mediation,  and 
common  representation  where  the  clients’  interests  are  substantially,  though  not 
entirely, compatible.  One form may be appropriate in circumstances where another 
would  not.    Other  relevant  factors  are  whether  the  lawyer  subsequently  will 
represent  both  parties  on  a  continuing  basis  and  whether  the  situation  involves 
creating a relationship between the parties or terminating one.  

Confidentiality and Privilege. 

factor 

important 

in  determining 

A  particularly 
the  appropriateness  of 
intermediation  is  the  effect  on  client-lawyer  confidentiality  and  the  client-lawyer 
privilege.    In  a  common  representation,  the  lawyer  is  still  required  both  to  keep 
each  client  adequately  informed  and  to  maintain  confidentiality  of  information 
relating  to  the  representation.    See  Rules  1.4  and  1.6.    Complying  with  both 
requirements  while  acting  as  intermediary  requires  a  delicate  balance.    If  the 
balance  cannot  be  maintained,  the  common  representation  is  improper.    With 
regard  to  the  client-lawyer  privilege,  the  prevailing  rule  is  that  as  between 
commonly  represented  clients  the  privilege  does  not  attach.    Hence,  it  must  be 
assumed  that  if  litigation  eventuates  between  the  clients,  the  privilege  will  not 
protect any such communications, and the clients should be so advised.  

Since the lawyer is required to be impartial between commonly represented clients, 
intermediation  is  improper  when  that  impartiality  cannot  be  maintained.    For 
example, a lawyer who has represented one of the clients for a long period and in a 
variety of matters might have difficulty being impartial between that client and one 
to whom the lawyer has only recently been introduced.  

Consultation. 

In acting as intermediary between clients, the lawyer is required to consult with the 
clients on the implications of doing so, and proceed only upon consent based on such 
a  consultation.    The  consultation  should  make  clear  that  the  lawyer’s  role  is  not 
that of partisanship normally expected in other circumstances.  

Paragraph  (b)  is  an  application  of  the  principle  expressed  in  Rule  1.4.    Where  the 
lawyer is intermediary, the clients ordinarily must assume greater responsibility for 
decisions than when each client is independently represented.  

Withdrawal. 

Common  representation  does  not  diminish  the  rights  of  each  client  in  the  client-
lawyer  relationship.    Each  has  the  right  to  loyal  and  diligent  representation,  the 
right  to  discharge  the  lawyers  stated  in  Rule  1.16,  and  the  protection  of  Rule  1.9 
concerning obligations to a former client.  

Rule 2.3.  Evaluation for Use by Third Persons. 

(a)  A  lawyer  may,  for  the  use  of  someone  other  than  the  client,  undertake  an 
evaluation of a matter affecting a client if:  

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

61 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

(1)  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  that  making  the  evaluation  is  compatible  with 
other aspects of the lawyer’s relationship with the client; and  

(2) the client consents after consultation.  

(b)  Except  as  disclosure  is  required  in  connection  with  a  report  of  an  evaluation, 
information relating to the evaluation is protected by Rule 1.6.  

Comment: 

Definition. 

An  evaluation  may  be  performed  at  the  client’s  direction,  but  for  the  primary 
purpose of establishing information for the benefit of third parties; for example, an 
opinion  concerning  the  title  of  property  rendered  at  the  behest  of  a  vendor  for  the 
information  of  a  prospective  purchaser,  or  at  the  behest  of  a  borrower  for  the 
information  of  a  prospective  lender.    In  some  situations,  the  evaluation  may  be 
required by a government agency, for example, an opinion concerning the legality of 
the securities registered for sale under the securities laws.  In other instances, the 
evaluation may be required by a third person, such as a purchaser of a business.  

Lawyers  for  the  government  may  be  called  upon  to  give  a  formal  opinion  on  the 
legality of contemplated government agency action.  In making such an evaluation, 
the  government  lawyer  acts  at  the  behest  of  the  government  as  the  client,  but  for 
the purpose of establishing the limits of the agency’s authorized activity.  Such an 
opinion  is  to  be  distinguished  from  confidential  legal  advice  given  agency  officials.  
The critical question is whether the opinion is to be made public.  

A  legal  evaluation  should  be  distinguished  from  an  investigation  of  a  person  with 
whom the lawyer does not have a client-lawyer relationship.  For example, a lawyer 
retained  by  a  purchaser  to  analyze  a  vendor’s  title  to  property  does  not  have  a 
client-lawyer relationship with the vendor.  So also, an investigation into a person’s 
affairs by a government lawyer, or by special counsel employed by the government, 
is not an evaluation as that term is used in this rule.  The question is whether the 
lawyer  is  retained  by  the  person  whose  affairs  are  being  examined.    When  the 
lawyer is retained by that person, the general rules concerning loyalty to client and 
preservation of confidences apply, which is not the case if the lawyer is retained by 
someone  else.    For  this  reason,  it  is  essential  to  identify  the  person  by  whom  the 
lawyer  is  retained.    This  should  be  made  clear  not  only  to  the  person  under 
examination, but also to others to whom the results are to be made available.  

Duty to Third Person. 

When the evaluation is intended for the information or use of a third person, a legal 
duty to that person may or may not arise.  That legal question is beyond the scope of 
this rule.  However, since such an evaluation involves a departure from the normal 
client-lawyer relationship, careful analysis of the situation is required.  The lawyer 
must be satisfied as a matter of professional judgment that making the evaluation 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

62 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

is compatible with other functions undertaken in behalf of the client.  For example, 
if the lawyer is acting as advocate in defending the client against charges of fraud, 
it would normally be incompatible with that responsibility for the lawyer to perform 
an evaluation for others concerning the same or a related transaction.  Assuming no 
such  impediment  is  apparent,  however,  the  lawyer  should  advise  the  client  of  the 
implications  of  the  evaluation,  particularly  the  lawyer’s  responsibilities  to  third 
persons and the duty to disseminate the findings.  

Access to and Disclosure of Information. 

The quality of an evaluation depends on the freedom and extent of the investigation 
upon  which  it  is  based.    Ordinarily  a  lawyer  should  have  whatever  latitude  of 
investigation  seems  necessary  as  a  matter  of  professional  judgment.    Under  some 
circumstances, however, the terms of the evaluation may be limited.  For example, 
certain issues or sources may be categorically excluded, or the scope of search may 
be  limited  by  time  constraints  or  the  noncooperation  of  persons  having  relevant 
information.    Any  such  limitations  which are  material  to  the  evaluation  should  be 
described  in  the  report.    If  after  a  lawyer  has  commenced  an  evaluation  the  client 
refuses to comply with the terms upon which it was understood the evaluation was 
to  have  been  made,  the  lawyer’s  obligations  are  determined  by  law,  having 
reference to the terms of the client’s agreement and the surrounding circumstances.  

Financial Auditors’ Requests for Information. 

When a question concerning the legal situation of a client arises at the instance of 
the client’s financial auditor and the question is referred to the lawyer, the lawyer’s 
response  may  be  made  in  accordance  with  procedures  recognized  in  the  legal 
profession.    Such  a  procedure  is  set  forth  in  the  American  Bar  Association 
Statement  of  Policy  Regarding  Lawyers’  Responses  to  Auditors’  Requests  for 
Information, adopted in 1975.  

Rule 2.4.  Lawyer Serving as Third-Party Neutral.  

(a)  A  lawyer  serves  as  a  third-party  neutral  when  the  lawyer  assists  two  or  more 
persons who are not clients of the lawyer to reach a resolution of a dispute or other 
matter that has arisen between them.  Service as a third-party neutral may include 
service  as  an  arbitrator,  a  mediator,  or  in  such  other  capacity  as  will  enable  the 
lawyer to assist the parties to resolve the matter. 

(b)  A  lawyer  serving  as  a  third-party  neutral  must  inform  unrepresented  parties 
that  the  lawyer  is  not  representing  them.    When  the  lawyer  knows  or  reasonably 
should know that a party does not understand the lawyer’s role in the matter, the 
lawyer  must  explain  the  difference  between  the  lawyer’s  role  as  a  third-party 
neutral and a lawyer’s role as one who represents a client. 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct

Comment:  

Alternative  dispute  resolution  has  become  a  substantial  part  of  the  civil  justice 
system.    Aside  from  representing  clients  in  dispute-resolution  processes,  lawyers 
often  serve  as  third-party  neutrals.    A  third-party  neutral  is  a  person,  such  as  a 
mediator,  an  arbitrator,  a  conciliator,  or  an  evaluator,  who  assists  the  parties, 
represented or unrepresented, in the resolution of a dispute or in the arrangement 
of a transaction.  Whether a third-party neutral serves primarily as a facilitator, an 
evaluator, or a decision maker depends on the particular process that is selected by 
the parties or mandated by a court. 

The role of a third-party neutral is not unique to lawyers, although, in some court-
connected  contexts,  only  lawyers  are  allowed  to  serve  in  this  role  or  to  handle 
certain types of cases.  In performing this role, the lawyer may be subject to court 
rules or other law that apply either to third-party neutrals generally or to lawyers 
serving  as  third-party  neutrals.    Lawyer-neutrals  also  may  be  subject  to  various 
codes  of  ethics,  such  as  the  Code  of  Ethics  for  Arbitration in  Commercial Disputes 
prepared  by  a  joint  committee  of  the  American  Bar  Association  and  the  American 
Arbitration  Association,  or  the  Model  Standards  of  Conduct  for  Mediators  jointly 
prepared  by  the  American  Bar  Association,  the  American  Arbitration  Association, 
and the Society of Professionals in Dispute Resolution. 

Unlike  nonlawyers  who  serve  as  third-party  neutrals,  lawyers  serving  in  this  role 
may  experience  unique  problems  as  a  result  of  differences  between  the  role  of  a 
third-party neutral and a lawyer’s service as a client representative.  The potential 
for  confusion  is  significant  when  the  parties  are  unrepresented  in  the  process.  
Thus, paragraph (b) requires a lawyer-neutral to inform unrepresented parties that 
the  lawyer  is  not  representing  them.    For  some  parties,  particularly  parties  who 
frequently use dispute-resolution processes, this information will be sufficient.  For 
others,  particularly  those  who  are  using  the  process  for  the  first  time,  more 
information  will  be  required.    Where  appropriate,  the  lawyer  should  inform 
unrepresented  parties  of  the  important  differences  between  the  lawyer’s  role  as 
third-party  neutral  and  a  lawyer’s  role  as  a  client  representative,  including  the 
inapplicability of the attorney-client evidentiary privilege.  The extent of disclosure 
required  under  this  paragraph  will  depend  on  the  particular  parties  involved  and 
the  subject  matter  of  the  proceeding,  as  well  as  the  particular  features  of  the 
dispute-resolution process selected. 

A lawyer who serves as a third-party neutral subsequently may be asked to serve as 
a  lawyer  representing  a  client  in  the  same  matter.    The  conflicts  of  interest  that 
arise for both the individual lawyer and the lawyer’s law firm are addressed in Rule 
1.12. 

Lawyers who represent clients in alternative dispute resolution are governed by the 
Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct.  When the dispute-resolution process takes 
place  before  a  tribunal,  as  in  binding  arbitration,  the  lawyer’s  duty  of  candor  is 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

64 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

governed by Rule 3.3.  Otherwise, the lawyer’s duty of candor toward both the third-
party neutral and other parties is governed by Rule 4.1. 

RULES 3.1–3.9.  ADVOCATE. 

Rule 3.1.  Meritorious Claims and Contentions. 

A  lawyer  shall  not  bring  or  defend  a  proceeding,  or  assert  or  controvert  an  issue 
therein, unless there is a basis for doing so that is not frivolous.  A lawyer may offer 
a good-faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.  A 
lawyer for the defendant in a criminal proceeding, or the respondent in a proceeding 
that could result in incarceration, may so defend the  proceeding as to require that 
every element of the case be established.  

Comment:  

The advocate has a duty to use legal procedure for the fullest benefit of the client’s 
cause, but also has a duty not to abuse legal procedure.  The law, both procedural 
and  substantive,  establishes  the  limits  within  which  an  advocate  may  proceed.  
However,  the  law  is  not  always  clear  and  never  is  static.    Accordingly,  in 
determining  the  proper  scope  of  advocacy,  account  must  be  taken  of  the  law’s 
ambiguities and potential for change. 

The filing of an action or defense or similar action taken for a client is not frivolous 
merely  because  the  facts  have  not  first  been  fully  substantiated  or  because  the 
lawyer  expects  to  develop  vital  evidence  only  by  discovery.    What  is  required  of 
lawyers is that they inform themselves about the facts of their clients’ cases and the 
applicable law and determine that they can make good-faith arguments in support 
of  their  clients’  positions.    Such  action  is  not  frivolous  even  though  the  lawyer 
believes that the client’s position ultimately will not prevail.  The action is frivolous, 
however, if the lawyer is unable either to make a good-faith argument on the merits 
of the action taken or to support the action taken by a good-faith argument for an 
extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.  

Rule 3.2.  Expediting Litigation. 

A  lawyer  shall  make  reasonable  efforts  to  expedite  litigation  consistent  with  the 
interests of the client.  

Comment:  

Although  a  judge  bears  the  responsibility  of  assuring  the  progress  of  a  court’s 
docket,  dilatory  practices  by  a  lawyer  can  bring  the  administration  of  justice  into 
disrepute.    Delay  should  not  be  indulged  merely  for  the  convenience  of  the 
advocates,  or  for  the  purpose  of  frustrating  an  opposing  party’s  attempt  to  obtain 
rightful  redress  or  repose.    It  is  not  a  justification  that  similar  conduct  is  often 
tolerated by the bench and bar.  Even though it causes delay, a course of action is 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

65 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

proper if a competent lawyer acting in good faith would regard the course of action 
as having some substantial purpose other than delay.  Realizing financial or other 
benefit from otherwise improper delay in litigation is not a legitimate interest of the 
client. 

Rule 3.3.  Candor Toward the Tribunal. 

(a) A lawyer shall not knowingly:  

(1)  make  a  false  statement  of  material  fact  or  law  to a  tribunal  or  fail  to  correct  a 
false  statement  of  material  fact  or  law  previously  made  to  the  tribunal  by  the 
lawyer;  

(2) fail to disclose to a tribunal controlling legal authority in the jurisdiction known 
to the lawyer to be directly adverse to the position of the client and not disclosed by 
opposing counsel; or  

(3) offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false.  If a lawyer has offered material 
evidence and comes to know of its falsity, the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial 
measures, including, if necessary, disclosure to the tribunal 

(b) If a lawyer knows that the lawyer’s client or other person intends to engage, is 
engaging,  or  has  engaged  in  criminal  or  fraudulent  conduct  related  to  an 
adjudicative  proceeding  involving  the  client,  the  lawyer  shall  take  reasonable 
remedial measures, including, if necessary, disclosure to the tribunal.   

(c)  The  duties  stated  in  paragraphs  (a)  and  (b)  continue  to  the  conclusion  of  the 
proceeding,  and  apply  even  if  compliance  requires  disclosure  of  information 
otherwise protected by Rule 1.6.  

(d) In an ex parte proceeding, a lawyer shall inform the tribunal of all material facts 
that are known to the lawyer and that will enable the tribunal to make an informed 
decision, whether or not the facts are adverse.  

(e) When false evidence is offered, a conflict may arise between the lawyer’s duty to 
keep the client’s revelations confidential and the duty of candor to the court.  Upon 
ascertaining that material evidence is false, the lawyer should seek to persuade the 
client that the evidence should not be offered or, if it has been offered, that its false 
character  should  immediately  be  disclosed.    If  the  persuasion  is  ineffective,  the 
lawyer  must  take  reasonable  remedial  measures.    The  advocate  should  seek  to 
withdraw if that will remedy the situation.  If withdrawal from the representation 
is not permitted or will not remedy the effect of the false evidence, the lawyer must 
make  such  disclosure  to  the  tribunal  as  is  reasonably  necessary  to  remedy  the 
situation, even if doing so requires the lawyer to reveal information that otherwise 
would be protected by Rule 1.6.   

Comment:  

This rule governs the conduct of a lawyer who is representing a client in a tribunal.  
It  also  applies  when  the  lawyer  is  representing  a  client in  an  ancillary  proceeding 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

66 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

conducted  pursuant  to  the  tribunal’s  adjudicative  authority,  such  as  a  deposition.  
Thus,  subrule  (a)  requires  a  lawyer  to  take  reasonable  remedial  measures  if  the 
lawyer  comes  to  know  that  a  client  who  is  testifying  in  a  deposition  has  offered 
evidence that is false. 

As  officers  of  the  court,  lawyers  have  special  duties  to  avoid  conduct  that 
undermines  the  integrity  of  the  adjudicative  process.    A  lawyer  acting  as  an 
advocate in an adjudicative proceeding has an obligation to present the client’s case 
with  persuasive  force.    Performance  of  that  duty  while  maintaining  confidences  of 
the client is qualified, however, by the advocate’s duty of candor to the tribunal.  .  
Consequently,  although  a  lawyer  in  an  adversary  proceeding  is  not  required  to 
present an impartial exposition of the law or to vouch for the evidence submitted in 
a cause, the lawyer must not allow the tribunal to be misled by false statements of 
law or fact or evidence that the lawyer knows to be false. 

Representations by a Lawyer. 

An  advocate  is  responsible  for  pleadings  and  other  documents  prepared  for 
litigation,  but  is  usually  not  required  to  have  personal  knowledge  of  matters 
asserted therein, because litigation documents ordinarily present assertions by the 
client  or  by  someone  on  the  client’s  behalf  and  not  assertions  by  the  lawyer.  
Compare  Rule  3.1.    However,  an  assertion  purporting  to  be  on  the  lawyer’s  own 
knowledge,  as  in  an  affidavit  by  the  lawyer  or  in  a  statement  in  open  court,  may 
properly be made only when the lawyer knows the assertion is true or believes it to 
be  true  on  the  basis  of  a  reasonably  diligent  inquiry.    There  are  circumstances 
is  the  equivalent  of  an  affirmative 
where  failure  to  make  a  disclosure 
misrepresentation.  The obligation prescribed in Rule 1.2(c) not to counsel a client to 
commit  or  assist  the  client  in  committing  a  fraud  applies  in  litigation.    Regarding 
compliance with Rule 1.2(c), see the comment to that rule.  See also the comment to 
Rule 8.4(b).  

Legal Argument. 

Legal  argument  based  on  a  knowingly  false  representation  of  law  constitutes 
dishonesty  toward  the  tribunal.    A  lawyer  is  not  required  to  make  a  disinterested 
exposition  of  the  law,  but  must  recognize  the  existence  of  pertinent  legal 
authorities.  Furthermore, as stated in paragraph (a)(2), an advocate has a duty to 
disclose  directly  controlling  adverse  authority  that  has  not  been  disclosed  by  the 
opposing  party.    The  underlying  concept  is  that  legal  argument  is  a  discussion 
seeking to determine the legal premises properly applicable to the case.  

Offering Evidence. 

Paragraph  (a)(3)  requires  that  a  lawyer  refuse  to  offer  evidence  that  the  lawyer 
knows  to  be  false,  regardless  of  the  client’s  wishes.    This  duty  is  premised  on  the 
lawyer’s obligation as an officer of the  court to prevent the trier of fact from being 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

67 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

misled by false evidence.  A lawyer does not violate this rule if the lawyer offers the 
evidence for the purpose of establishing its falsity. 

If  a  lawyer  knows  that  the  client  intends  to  testify  falsely  or  wants  the  lawyer  to 
introduce  false  evidence,  the  lawyer  should  seek  to  persuade  the  client  that  the 
evidence  should  not  be  offered.    If  the  persuasion  is  ineffective  and  the  lawyer 
continues to represent the client, the lawyer must refuse to offer the false evidence.  
If  only  a  portion  of  a  witness’  testimony  will  be  false,  the  lawyer  may  call  the 
witness to testify but may not elicit or otherwise permit the witness to present the 
testimony  that  the  lawyer  knows  is  false.    A  lawyer’s  knowledge  that  evidence  is 
false  can  be  inferred  from  the  circumstances.    Thus,  although  a  lawyer  should 
resolve  doubts  about  the  veracity  of  testimony  or  other  evidence  in  favor  of  the 
client, the lawyer cannot ignore an obvious falsehood. 

Remedial Measures. 

Having  offered  material  evidence  in  the  belief  that  it  was  true,  a  lawyer  may 
subsequently come to know that the evidence is false.  Or a lawyer may be surprised 
when the lawyer’s client, or another witness called by the lawyer, offers testimony 
the  lawyer  knows  to  be  false,  either  during  the  lawyer’s  direct  examination  or  in 
response to cross-examination by the opposing lawyer.  In such situations, or if the 
lawyer knows of the falsity of testimony elicited from the client during a deposition, 
the lawyer must take reasonable remedial measures.  If that fails, the lawyer must 
take further remedial action.  It is for the tribunal then to determine what should 
be  done–making  a  statement  about  the  matter  to  the  trier  of  fact,  ordering  a 
mistrial, or perhaps nothing  

 
The disclosure of a client’s false testimony can result in grave consequences 
to  the  client,  including  a  sense  of  betrayal,  the  loss  of  the  case,  or  perhaps  a 
prosecution  for  perjury.    However,  the  alternative  is  that  the  lawyer  aids  in  the 
deception  of  the  court,  thereby  subverting  the  truth-finding  process  that  the 
adversarial system is designed to implement.  See Rule 1.2(c).  Furthermore, unless 
it  is  clearly  understood  that  the  lawyer  must  remediate  the  disclosure  of  false 
evidence,  the  client  could  simply  reject  the  lawyer’s  counsel  to  reveal  the  false 
evidence  and  require  that  the  lawyer  remain  silent.    Thus,  the  client  could  insist 
that the lawyer assist in perpetrating a fraud on the court.  

Preserving Integrity of Adjudicative Process. 

Lawyers  have  a  special  obligation  to  protect  a  tribunal  against  criminal  or 
fraudulent conduct that undermines the integrity of the adjudicative process, such 
as  bribing,  intimidating,  or  otherwise  unlawfully  communicating  with  a  witness, 
juror, court official, or other participant in the proceeding, unlawfully destroying or 
concealing  documents  or  other  evidence,  or  failing  to  disclose  information  to  the 
tribunal  when  required  by  law  to  do  so.   Thus,  paragraph  (b)  requires  a  lawyer  to 
take reasonable remedial measures, including disclosure, if necessary, whenever the 
lawyer  knows  that  a  person,  including  the  lawyer’s  client,  intends  to  engage,  is 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

68 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

engaging,  or  has  engaged  in  criminal  or  fraudulent  conduct  related  to  the 
proceeding.  See Rule 3.4. 

Duration of Obligation. 

A practical time limit on the obligation to rectify the presentation of false evidence 
or  false  statements  of  law  and  fact  must  be  established.    The  conclusion  of  the 
proceeding is a reasonably definite point for the termination of the obligation.  

Ex Parte Proceedings. 

Ordinarily, an advocate has the limited responsibility of presenting one side of the 
matters  that  a  tribunal  should  consider  in  reaching  a  decision;  the  conflicting 
position is expected to be presented by the opposing party.  However, in an ex parte 
proceeding,  such  as  an  application  for  a  temporary  restraining  order,  there  is  no 
balance of presentation by opposing advocates.  The object of an ex parte proceeding 
is  nevertheless  to  yield  a  substantially  just  result.    The  judge  has  an  affirmative 
responsibility  to  accord  the  absent  party  just  consideration.    The  lawyer  for  the 
represented party has the correlative duty to make disclosures of material facts that 
are  known  to  the  lawyer  and  that  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  are  necessary  to 
an informed decision.  

Withdrawal. 

Normally, a lawyer’s compliance with the duty of candor imposed by this rule does 
not  require  that  the  lawyer  withdraw  from  the  representation  of  a  client  whose 
interests  will  be  or  have  been  adversely  affected  by  the  lawyer’s  disclosure.    The 
lawyer may, however, be required by Rule 1.16(a) to seek permission of the tribunal 
to  withdraw  if  the  lawyer’s  compliance  with  this  rule’s  duty  of  candor  results  in 
such an extreme deterioration of the client-lawyer relationship that the lawyer can 
no  longer  competently  represent  the  client.    Also  see  Rule  1.16(b)  for  the 
circumstances in which a lawyer will be permitted to seek a tribunal’s permission to 
withdraw.    In  connection  with  a  request  for  permission  to  withdraw  that  is 
premised on a client’s misconduct, a lawyer may reveal information relating to the 
representation  only to  the  extent  reasonably  necessary  to  comply  with this  rule  or 
as otherwise permitted by Rule 1.6. 

Rule 3.4.  Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel. 

A lawyer shall not:  

(a) unlawfully obstruct another party’s access to evidence; unlawfully alter, destroy, 
or  conceal  a  document  or  other  material  having  potential  evidentiary  value;  or 
counsel or assist another person to do any such act; 

(b)  falsify  evidence,  counsel  or  assist  a  witness  to  testify  falsely,  or  offer  an 
inducement to a witness that is prohibited by law; 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

69 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

(c) knowingly disobey an obligation under the rules of a tribunal except for an open 
refusal based on an assertion that no valid obligation exists; 

(d)  in  pretrial  procedure,  make  a  frivolous  discovery  request  or  fail  to  make 
reasonably  diligent  efforts  to  comply  with a  legally  proper  discovery  request  by  an 
opposing party; 

(e) during trial, allude to any matter that the lawyer does not reasonably believe is 
relevant  or  that  will  not  be  supported  by  admissible  evidence,  assert  personal 
knowledge of facts in issue except when testifying as a witness, or state a personal 
opinion as to the justness of a cause, the credibility of a witness, the culpability of a 
civil litigant, or the guilt or innocence of an accused; or 

(f)  request  a  person  other  than  a  client  to  refrain  from  voluntarily  giving  relevant 
information to another party, unless: 

(1)  the  person  is  an  employee  or  other  agent  of  a  client  for  purposes  of  MRE 
801(d)(2)(D); and 

(2) the lawyer reasonably believes that the person’s interests will not be adversely 
affected by refraining from giving such information. 

Comment:  

The procedure of the adversary system contemplates that the evidence in a case is 
to  be  marshaled  competitively  by  the  contending  parties.    Fair  competition  in  the 
adversary  system  is  secured  by  prohibitions  against  destruction  or  concealment  of 
evidence, 
in  discovery 
procedure, and the like. 

influence  of  witnesses,  obstructive  tactics 

improper 

Documents  and  other  items  of  evidence  are  often  essential  to  establish  a  claim  or 
defense.  Subject to evidentiary privileges, the right of an opposing party, including 
the government, to obtain evidence through discovery or subpoena is an important 
procedural right.  The exercise of that right can be frustrated if relevant material is 
altered, concealed or destroyed.  Other law makes it an offense to destroy material 
for  purpose  of  impairing  its  availability  in  a  pending  proceeding  or  one  whose 
commencement  can  be  foreseen.    Falsifying  evidence  is  also  generally  a  criminal 
offense.    Paragraph  (a)  applies  to  evidentiary  material  generally,  including 
computerized information.  

With  regard  to  paragraph  (b),  it  is  not  improper  to  pay  a  witness’  expenses  or  to 
compensate an expert witness on terms permitted by law.  It is, however, improper 
to  pay  an  occurrence  witness  any  fee  for  testifying beyond  that authorized  by law, 
and it is improper to pay an expert witness a contingent fee.  

Rule 3.5.  Impartiality and Decorum of the Tribunal. 

A lawyer shall not:  

(a)  seek  to  influence  a  judge,  juror,  prospective  juror,  or  other  official  by  means 
prohibited by law;

harassment; or 

Comment:  

Many  forms  of  improper  influence  upon  a  tribunal are  proscribed  by  criminal  law.  
Others  are  specified  in  the  Michigan  Code  of  Judicial  Conduct,  with  which  an 
advocate  should  be  familiar.    A  lawyer  is  required  to  avoid  contributing  to  a 
violation of such provisions. 

During a proceeding a lawyer may not communicate ex parte with persons serving 
in  an  official  capacity  in  the  proceeding,  such  as  judges,  masters,  or  jurors,  unless 
authorized to do so by law or court order. 

A  lawyer  may  on  occasion  want  to  communicate  with  a  juror  or  prospective  juror 
after  the  jury  has  been  discharged.    The  lawyer  may  do  so,  unless  the 
communication is prohibited by law or a court order, but must respect the desire of 
the  juror  not  to  talk  with  the  lawyer.    The  lawyer  may  not  engage  in  improper 
conduct during the communication. 

The advocate’s function is to present evidence and argument so that the cause may 
be decided according to law.  Refraining from undignified or discourteous conduct is 
a  corollary  of  the  advocate’s  right  to  speak  on  behalf  of  litigants.    A  lawyer  may 
stand  firm  against  abuse  by  a  judge,  but  should  avoid  reciprocation;  the  judge’s 
default  is  no  justification  for  similar  dereliction  by  an  advocate.    An  advocate  can 
present  the  cause,  protect  the  record  for  subsequent  review,  and  preserve 
professional integrity by patient firmness no less effectively than by belligerence or 
theatrics.  

Rule 3.6.  Trial Publicity. 

(a)  A  lawyer  who  is  participating  or  has  participated  in  the  investigation  or 
litigation  of  a  matter  shall  not  make  an  extrajudicial  statement  that  the  lawyer 
knows  or  reasonably  should  know  will  be  disseminated  by  means  of  public 
communication  and  will  have  a  substantial  likelihood  of  materially  prejudicing  an 
adjudicative proceeding in the matter.  A statement is likely to have a substantial 
likelihood  of  materially  prejudicing  an  adjudicative  proceeding  when  it  refers  to  a 
civil matter triable to a jury, a criminal matter, or any other proceeding that could 
result in incarceration, and the statement relates to:

Comment:  

It  is  difficult  to  strike  a  balance  between  protecting  the  right  to  a  fair  trial  and 
safeguarding  the  right  of  free  expression.    Preserving  the  right  to  a  fair  trial 
necessarily  entails  some  curtailment  of  the  information  that  may  be  disseminated 
about a party before trial, particularly where trial by jury is involved.  If there were 
no such limits, the result would be the practical nullification of the protective effect 
of  the  rules  of  forensic  decorum  and  the  exclusionary  rules  of  evidence.    On  the 
other  hand,  there  are  vital  social  interests  served  by  the  free  dissemination  of 
information  about  events  having  legal  consequences  and  about  legal  proceedings 
themselves.    The  public  has  a  right  to  know  about  threats  to  its  safety  and 
measures  aimed  at  assuring  its  security.    It  also  has  a  legitimate  interest  in  the 
conduct  of  judicial  proceedings,  particularly  in  matters  of  general  public  concern.  
Furthermore,  the  subject  matter  of  legal  proceedings  is  often  of  direct  significance 
in debate and deliberation over questions of public policy. 

Special rules of confidentiality may validly govern juvenile, domestic relations, and 
mental  disability  proceedings,  in  addition  to  other  types  of  litigation.    Rule  3.4(c) 
requires compliance with such rules.  

Rule 3.6 sets forth a basic general prohibition against a lawyer’s making statements 
that  the  lawyer  knows  or  should  know  will  have  a  substantial  likelihood  of 
materially  prejudicing  an  adjudicative  proceeding.    Recognizing  that  the  public 
value  of  informed  commentary  is  great  and  the  likelihood  of  prejudice  to  a 
proceeding by the commentary of a lawyer who is not involved in the proceeding is 
small,  the  rule applies  only  to lawyers  who  are,  or  who  have  been,  involved in  the 
investigation or litigation of a case, and their associates. 

See Rule 3.8(e) for additional duties of prosecutors in connection with extrajudicial 
statements about criminal proceedings. 

Rule 3.7.  Lawyer as Witness. 

(a) A lawyer shall not act as advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a 
necessary witness except where:  

(1) the testimony relates to an uncontested issue;  

(2)  the  testimony  relates  to  the  nature  and  value  of  legal  services  rendered  in  the 
case; or  

(3) disqualification of the lawyer would work substantial hardship on the client.  

(b) A lawyer may act as advocate in a trial in which another lawyer in the lawyer’s 
firm is likely to be called as a witness unless precluded from doing so by Rule 1.7 or 
Rule 1.9.

Comment:  

Combining the roles of advocate and witness can prejudice the opposing party and 
can involve a conflict of interest between the lawyer and client. 

The  opposing  party  may  properly  object  where  the  combination  of  roles  may 
prejudice that party’s rights in the litigation.  A witness is required to testify on the 
basis of personal knowledge, while an advocate is expected to explain and comment 
on  evidence  given  by  others.    It  may  not  be  clear  whether  a  statement  by  an 
advocate-witness should be taken as proof or as an analysis of the proof.  

Paragraph  (a)(1)  recognizes  that  if  the  testimony  will  be  uncontested,  the 
ambiguities in the dual role are purely theoretical.  Paragraph (a)(2) recognizes that 
where the testimony concerns the extent and value of legal services rendered in the 
action in which the testimony is offered, permitting the lawyers to testify avoids the 
need for a second trial with new counsel to resolve that issue.  Moreover, in such a 
situation the judge has firsthand knowledge of the matter in issue; hence, there is 
less dependence on the adversary process to test the credibility of the testimony.  

Apart  from  these  two  exceptions,  paragraph  (a)(3)  recognizes  that  a  balancing  is 
required  between  the  interests  of  the  client  and  those  of  the  opposing  party.  
Whether  the  opposing  party  is  likely  to  suffer  prejudice  depends  on  the  nature  of 
the  case,  the  importance  and  probable  tenor  of  the  lawyer’s  testimony,  and  the 
probability  that  the  lawyer’s  testimony  will  conflict  with  that  of  other  witnesses.  
Even if there is risk of such prejudice, in determining whether the lawyer should be 
disqualified due regard must be given to the effect of disqualification on the lawyer’s 
client.    It  is  relevant  that  one  or  both  parties  could  reasonably  foresee  that  the 
lawyer  would  probably  be  a  witness.    The  principle  of  imputed  disqualification 
stated in Rule 1.10 has no application to this aspect of the problem.  

Whether  the  combination  of  roles  involves  an  improper  conflict  of  interest  with 
respect to the client is determined by Rule 1.7 or 1.9.  For example, if there is likely 
to be substantial conflict between the testimony of the client and that of the lawyer 
or a member of the lawyer’s firm, the representation is improper.  The problem can 
arise whether the lawyer is called as a witness on behalf of the client or is called by 
the opposing party.  Determining whether or not such a conflict exists is primarily 
the responsibility of the lawyer involved.  See comment to Rule 1.7.  If a lawyer who 
is a member of a firm may not act as both advocate and witness by reason of conflict 
of interest, Rule 1.10 disqualifies the firm also.  

Rule 3.8.  Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor. 

The prosecutor in a criminal case shall:  

(a) refrain from prosecuting a charge that the prosecutor knows is not supported by 
probable cause;  

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

74 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

(b) make reasonable efforts to assure that the accused has been advised of the right 
to,  and  the  procedure  for  obtaining,  counsel  and  has  been  given  reasonable 
opportunity to obtain counsel;  

(c) not seek to obtain from an unrepresented accused a waiver of important pretrial 
rights, such as the right to a preliminary hearing;  

(d) make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information known to the 
prosecutor  that  tends  to  negate  the  guilt  of  the  accused  or  mitigates  the  degree  of 
the  offense,  and,  in  connection  with  sentencing,  disclose  to  the  defense  and  to  the 
tribunal  all  unprivileged  mitigating  information  known  to  the  prosecutor,  except 
when  the  prosecutor  is  relieved  of  this  responsibility  by  a  protective  order  of  the 
tribunal; and  

(e) exercise  reasonable  care  to  prevent  investigators,  law  enforcement  personnel, 
employees, or other persons assisting or associated with the prosecutor in a criminal 
case  from  making  an  extrajudicial  statement  that  the  prosecutor  would  be 
prohibited from making under Rule 3.6. 

(f)  When  a  prosecutor  knows  of  new,  credible,  and  material  evidence  creating  a 
reasonable likelihood that a convicted defendant is innocent of the crime for which 
the defendant was convicted, the prosecutor shall: 

(1) promptly disclose that evidence to an appropriate court or authority, and  

(2) if the conviction was obtained in the prosecutor’s jurisdiction,  

(i) promptly disclose that evidence to the defendant unless a court authorizes delay, 
and  

(ii)  undertake  further  investigation,  or  make  reasonable  efforts  to  cause  an 
investigation, to determine whether the defendant is innocent of the crime. 

(g)  When  a  prosecutor  knows  of  clear  and  convincing  evidence  establishing  that  a 
defendant  in  the  prosecutor’s  jurisdiction  is  innocent  of  the  crime  for  which 
defendant was prosecuted, the prosecutor shall seek to remedy the conviction. 

(h) A prosecutor’s independent judgment, made in good faith, that the new evidence 
is  not  of  such  nature  as  to  trigger  the  obligations  of  section  (f)  and  (g),  though 
subsequently determined to have been erroneous, does not constitute a violation of 
this Rule. 

Comment:  

A prosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of justice and not simply that of an 
advocate.    This  responsibility  carries  with  it  specific  obligations  to  see  that  the 
defendant is accorded procedural justice and that guilt is decided upon the basis of 
sufficient  evidence.    Precisely  how  far  the  prosecutor  is  required  to  go  in  this 
direction  is  a  matter  of  debate.    Cf.  Rule  3.3(d),  governing  ex  parte  proceedings, 
among  which  grand  jury  proceedings  are  included.    Applicable  law  may  require 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

75

other measures by the prosecutor, and knowing disregard of those obligations or a 
systematic abuse of prosecutorial discretion could constitute a violation of Rule 8.4. 

Paragraph  (c)  does  not  apply  to  an  accused  appearing  pro  se  with  the  approval  of 
the  tribunal.    Nor  does  it  forbid  the  lawful  questioning  of  a  suspect  who  has 
knowingly waived the rights to counsel and silence.  

The  exception  in  paragraph  (d)  recognizes  that  a  prosecutor  may  seek  an 
appropriate  protective  order  from  the  tribunal  if  disclosure  of  information  to  the 
defense could result in substantial harm to an individual or to the public interest.  

In paragraphs (b) and (e), this rule imposes on a prosecutor an obligation to make 
reasonable  efforts  and  to  take  reasonable  care  to  assure  that  a  defendant’s  rights 
are protected.  Of course, not all of the individuals who might encroach upon those 
rights  are  under  the  control  of  the  prosecutor.    The  prosecutor  cannot  be  held 
responsible  for  the  actions  of  persons  over  whom  the  prosecutor  does  not  exercise 
authority.    The  prosecutor’s  obligation  is  discharged  if  the  prosecutor  has  taken 
reasonable  and  appropriate  steps  to  assure  that  the  defendant’s  rights  are 
protected.  

Rule 3.9.  Advocate in Nonadjudicative Proceedings. 

A  lawyer  representing  a  client  before  a  legislative  or  administrative  tribunal  in  a 
nonadjudicative proceeding shall disclose that the appearance is in a representative 
capacity  and  shall  conform  to  the  provisions  of  Rules  3.3(a)  through  (c),  3.4(a) 
through (c), and 3.5. 

Comment:  

In  representation  before  bodies  such  as  legislatures,  municipal  councils,  and 
executive  and  administrative  agencies  acting  in  a  rule-making  or  policy-making 
capacity,  lawyers  present  facts,  formulate  issues,  and  advance  argument  in  the 
matters under consideration.  The decision-making body, like a court, should be able 
to  rely  on  the  integrity  of  the  submissions  made  to  it.    A  lawyer  appearing  before 
such  a  body  should  deal  with  the  tribunal  honestly  and  in  conformity  with 
applicable rules of procedure. 

Lawyers have no exclusive right to appear before nonadjudicative bodies, as they do 
before  a  court.    The  requirements  of  this  rule  therefore  may  subject  lawyers  to 
regulations  inapplicable  to  advocates  who  are  not  lawyers.    However,  legislatures 
and  administrative  agencies  have  a  right  to  expect  lawyers  to  deal  with  them  as 
they deal with courts.  

This  rule  does  not  apply  to  representation  of  a  client  in  a  negotiation  or  other 
bilateral  transaction  with  a  governmental  agency;  representation  in  such  a 
transaction is governed by Rules 4.1 through 4.4.

RULES 4.1–4.4.  TRANSACTIONS WITH PERSONS OTHER THAN 
CLIENTS. 

Rule 4.1.  Truthfulness in Statements to Others. 

In  the  course  of  representing  a  client,  a  lawyer  shall  not  knowingly  make  a  false 
statement of material fact or law to a third person.  

Comment: 

Misrepresentation. 

A lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a client’s behalf, but 
generally has no affirmative duty to inform an opposing party of relevant facts.  A 
misrepresentation  can  occur  if  the  lawyer  incorporates  or  affirms  a  statement  of 
another person that the lawyer knows is false.  

Statements of Fact. 

This  rule  refers  to  statements  of  fact.    Whether  a  particular  statement  should  be 
regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.  Under generally accepted 
conventions  in  negotiation,  certain types  of  statements  ordinarily are  not  taken as 
statements of material fact.  Estimates of price or value placed on the subject of a 
transaction and a party’s intentions as to an acceptable settlement of a claim are in 
this  category,  and  so  is  the  existence  of  an  undisclosed  principal  except  where 
nondisclosure of the principal would constitute fraud.  

Fraud by Client. 

Making  a  false  statement  may  include  the  failure  to  make  a  statement  in 
circumstances  in  which  silence  is  equivalent  to  making  such  a  statement.    Thus, 
where  the  lawyer  has  made  a  statement  that  the  lawyer  believed  to  be  true  when 
made  but  later  discovers  that  the  statement  was  not  true,  in  some  circumstances 
failure  to  correct  the  statement  may  be  equivalent  to  making  a  statement  that  is 
false.    When  the  falsity  of  the  original  statement  by  the  lawyer  resulted  from 
reliance upon what was told to the lawyer by the client and if the original statement 
if  left  uncorrected  may  further  a  criminal  or  fraudulent  act  by  the  client,  the 
provisions  of  Rule  1.6(c)(3)  give  the  lawyer  discretion  to  make  the  disclosure 
necessary to rectify the consequences.  

Rule 4.2.  Communication With a Person Represented by Counsel. 

(a) In representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the 
representation  with  a  person  whom  the  lawyer  knows  to  be  represented  in  the 
matter by another lawyer, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or 
is authorized by law to do so. 

(b) An  otherwise  self-represented  person  receiving  limited  representation  in 
accordance with Rule 1.2(b) is considered to be self-represented for purposes of this

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

rule  unless  the  opposing  lawyer  knows  of,  or  has  been  provided  with,  a  written 
notice  of  limited  appearance  comporting  with  MCR  2.117(B)(2)(c)  or  other  written 
communication  advising  of  the  limited  scope  representation.    Oral  communication 
shall  be  made  first  to  the  limited  scope  representation  lawyer,  who  may,  after 
consultation with the client, authorize oral communications directly with the client 
as agreed.  

(c)  Until  a  notice  of  termination  of  limited  scope  representation  comporting  with 
MCR 2.117(B)(2)(c) is filed, or other written communication terminating the limited 
scope representation is provided, all written communication, both court filings and 
otherwise, shall be served upon both the client and the limited scope representation 
attorney. 

Comment:  

This rule does not prohibit communication with a party, or an employee or agent of 
a party, concerning matters outside the representation.  For example, the existence 
of a controversy between a government agency and a private party, or between two 
organizations,  does  not  prohibit  a  lawyer  for  either  from  communicating  with 
nonlawyer  representatives  of  the  other  regarding  a  separate  matter.    Also,  parties 
to  a  matter  may  communicate  directly  with  each  other  and  a  lawyer  having 
independent justification for communicating with the other party is permitted to do 
so.  Communications authorized by law include, for example, the right of a party to 
a  controversy  with  a  government  agency  to  speak  with  government  officials  about 
the matter. 

In  the  case  of  an  organization,  this  rule  prohibits  communications  by  a  lawyer  for 
one  party  concerning  the  matter  in  representation  with  persons  having  a 
managerial responsibility on behalf of the organization, and with any other person 
whose  act  or  omission  in  connection  with  that  matter  may  be  imputed  to  the 
organization  for  purposes  of  civil  or  criminal  liability  or  whose  statement  may 
constitute an admission on the part of the organization.  If an agent or employee of 
the  organization  is  represented  in  the  matter  by  separate  counsel,  the  consent  by 
that  counsel  to  a  communication  will  be  sufficient  for  purposes  of  this  rule.  
Compare Rule 3.4(f).  

This rule also covers any person, whether or not a party to a formal proceeding, who 
is represented by counsel concerning the matter in question.  

Rule 4.3.  Dealing With a Self-Represented Person. 

(a) In dealing on behalf of a client with a person who is not represented by counsel, 
a lawyer shall not state or imply that the lawyer is disinterested.  When the lawyer 
knows or reasonably should know that the self-represented person misunderstands 
the lawyer’s role in the matter, the lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to correct 
the misunderstanding.

limited  appearance 
(b) Clients  receiving  representation  under  a  notice  of 
comporting with MCR 2.117(B)(2)(c) or other written communication advising of the 
limited scope representation are not self-represented persons for matters within the 
scope of the limited appearance, until a notice of termination of limited appearance 
representation  comporting  with  MCR  2.117(B)(2)(c)  is  filed  or  other  written 
communication terminating the limited scope representation is in effect.  See Rule 
4.2. 

Comment:  

An  unrepresented  person,  particularly  one  not  experienced  in  dealing  with  legal 
matters,  might  assume  that  a  lawyer  is  disinterested  in  loyalties  or  is  a 
disinterested  authority  on  the  law  even  when  the  lawyer  represents  a  client.  
During the course of a lawyer’s representation of a client, the lawyer should not give 
advice to an unrepresented person other than the advice to obtain counsel. 

Rule 4.4.  Respect for Rights of Third Persons. 

In  representing  a  client,  a  lawyer  shall  not  use  means  that  have  no  substantial 
purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third person, or use methods of 
obtaining evidence that violate the legal rights of such a person.  

Comment:  

Responsibility to a client requires a lawyer to subordinate the interests of others to 
those  of  the  client,  but  that  responsibility  does  not  imply  that  a  lawyer  may 
disregard the rights of third persons.  It is impractical to catalogue all such rights, 
but  they  include  legal  restrictions  on  methods  of  obtaining  evidence  from  third 
persons. 

RULES 5.1–5.6.  LAW FIRMS AND ASSOCIATIONS. 

Rule 5.1.  Responsibilities of a Partner or Supervisory Lawyer. 

(a) A partner in a law firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has 
in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that all lawyers in the firm conform 
to the Rules of Professional Conduct.  

(b)  A  lawyer  having  direct  supervisory  authority  over  another  lawyer  shall  make 
reasonable  efforts  to  ensure  that  the  other  lawyer  conforms  to  the  Rules  of 
Professional Conduct.  

(c)  A  lawyer  shall  be  responsible  for  another  lawyer’s  violation  of  the  rules  of 
professional conduct if:  

(1)  the  lawyer  orders  or,  with  knowledge  of  the  relevant  facts  and  the  specific 
conduct, ratifies the conduct involved; or  

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

79 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

(2) the lawyer is a partner in the law firm in which the other lawyer practices or has 
direct  supervisory  authority  over  the  other  lawyer,  and  knows  of  the  conduct  at  a 
time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated but fails to take reasonable 
remedial action.  

Comment:  

Paragraphs  (a)  and  (b)  refer  to  lawyers  who  have  supervisory  authority  over  the 
professional  work  of  a  firm  or  a  legal  department  of  a  government  agency.    This 
includes members of a partnership and the shareholders in a law firm organized as 
a professional corporation.  This also includes lawyers having supervisory authority 
in the law department of an enterprise or government agency and lawyers who have 
intermediate managerial responsibilities in a firm. 

The measures required to fulfill the responsibility prescribed in paragraphs (a) and 
(b)  can  depend  on  the  firm’s  structure  and  the  nature  of  its  practice.    In  a  small 
firm, informal supervision and occasional admonition ordinarily might be sufficient.  
In a large firm, or in practice situations in which intensely difficult ethical problems 
frequently  arise,  more  elaborate  procedures  may  be  necessary.    Some  firms,  for 
example, have a procedure whereby junior lawyers can make confidential referral of 
ethical problems directly to a designated senior partner or special committee.  See 
Rule  5.2.    Firms,  whether  large  or  small,  may  also  rely  on  continuing  legal 
education in professional ethics.  In any event, the ethical atmosphere of a firm can 
influence  the  conduct  of  all  its  members  and  a  lawyer  having  authority  over  the 
work  of  another  may  not  assume  that  the  subordinate  lawyer  will  inevitably 
conform to the rules.  

Paragraph  (c)(1)  expresses  a  general  principle  concerning  responsibility  for  acts  of 
another.  See also Rule 8.4(a).  

Paragraph  (c)(2)  defines  the  duty  of  a  lawyer  having  direct  supervisory  authority 
over  performance  of  specific  legal  work  by  another  lawyer.    Whether  a  lawyer  has 
such  supervisory  authority  in  particular  circumstances  is  a  question  of  fact.  
Partners  of  a  private  firm  have  at  least  indirect  responsibility  for  all  work  being 
done  by  the  firm,  while  a  partner  in  charge  of  a  particular  matter  ordinarily  has 
direct  authority  over  other  firm  lawyers  engaged  in  the  matter.    Appropriate 
remedial  action  by  a  partner  would  depend  on  the  immediacy  of  the  partner’s 
involvement  and  the  seriousness  of  the  misconduct.    The  supervisor  is  required  to 
intervene to prevent avoidable consequences of misconduct if the supervisor knows 
that  the  misconduct  occurred.    Thus,  if  a  supervising  lawyer  knows  that  a 
subordinate  misrepresented  a  matter  to  an  opposing  party  in  negotiation,  the 
supervisor  as  well  as  the  subordinate  has  a  duty  to  correct  the  resulting 
misapprehension.  

Professional  misconduct  by  a  lawyer  under  supervision  could  reveal  a  violation  of 
paragraph (b) on the part of the supervisory lawyer even though it does not entail a 
violation of paragraph (c) because there was no direction, ratification, or knowledge 
of the violation.  

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct

Apart from this rule and Rule 8.4(a), a lawyer does not have disciplinary liability for 
the conduct of a partner, associate, or subordinate.  Whether a lawyer may be liable 
civilly  or  criminally  for  another  lawyer’s  conduct  is  a  question  of  law  beyond  the 
scope of these rules.  

Rule 5.2.  Responsibilities of a Subordinate Lawyer. 

(a) A lawyer is bound by the rules of professional conduct notwithstanding that the 
lawyer acted at the direction of another person.  

(b)  A  subordinate  lawyer  does  not  violate  the  rules  of  professional  conduct  if  that 
lawyer  acts  in  accordance  with  a  supervisory  lawyer’s  reasonable  resolution  of  an 
arguable question of professional duty.  

Comment:  

Although a lawyer is not relieved of responsibility for a violation by the fact that the 
lawyer  acted  at  the  direction  of  a  supervisor,  that  fact  may  be  relevant  in 
determining  whether  a  lawyer  had  the  knowledge  required  to  render  conduct  a 
violation of the rules.  For example, if a subordinate filed a frivolous pleading at the 
direction  of  a  supervisor,  the  subordinate  would  not  be  guilty  of  a  professional 
violation unless the subordinate knew of the document’s frivolous character. 

When  lawyers  in  a  supervisor-subordinate  relationship  encounter  a  matter 
involving  professional  judgment  as  to  ethical  duty,  the  supervisor  may  assume 
responsibility for making the judgment.  Otherwise a consistent course of action or 
position  could  not  be  taken.    If  the  question  can  reasonably  be  answered  only  one 
way, the duty of both lawyers is clear and they are equally responsible for fulfilling 
it.  However, if the question is reasonably arguable, someone has to decide upon the 
course  of  action.    That  authority  ordinarily  reposes  in  the  supervisor,  and  a 
subordinate may be guided accordingly.  For example, if a question arises whether 
the  interests  of  two  clients  conflict  under  Rule  1.7,  the  supervisor’s  reasonable 
resolution  of  the  question  should  protect  the  subordinate  professionally  if  the 
resolution is subsequently challenged.  

Rule 5.3.  Responsibilities Regarding Nonlawyer Assistants. 

With respect to a nonlawyer employed by, retained by, or associated with a lawyer:  

(a) a partner in a law firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has 
in  effect  measures  giving  reasonable  assurance  that  the  person’s  conduct  is 
compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer;  

(b)  a  lawyer  having  direct  supervisory  authority  over  the  nonlawyer  shall  make 
reasonable  efforts  to  ensure  that  the  person’s  conduct  is  compatible  with  the 
professional obligations of the lawyer; and  

(c)  a  lawyer  shall  be  responsible  for  conduct  of  such  a  person  that  would  be  a 
violation of the rules of professional conduct if engaged in by a lawyer if:  

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

81 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

(1)  the  lawyer  orders  or,  with  knowledge  of  the  relevant  facts  and  the  specific 
conduct, ratifies the conduct involved; or  

(2) the lawyer is a partner in the law firm in which the person is employed or has 
direct  supervisory  authority  over  the  person  and  knows  of  the  conduct  at  a  time 
when  its  consequences  can  be  avoided  or  mitigated  but  fails  to  take  reasonable 
remedial action.  

Comment:  

Lawyers  generally  employ  assistants  in  their  practice,  including  secretaries, 
investigators, law student interns, and paraprofessionals.  Such assistants, whether 
employees or independent contractors, act for the lawyer in rendition of the lawyer’s 
professional services.  A lawyer should give such assistants appropriate instruction 
and  supervision  concerning  the  ethical  aspects  of  their  employment,  particularly 
regarding the obligation not to disclose information relating to representation of the 
client, and should be responsible for their work product.  The measures employed in 
supervising nonlawyers should take account of the fact that they do not have legal 
training and are not subject to professional discipline. 

As  does  Rule  3.8,  this  rule  may  in  certain  situations  impose  on  a  prosecutor  an 
obligation  to  make  reasonable  efforts  to  assure  that  a  defendant’s  rights  are 
protected.    Of  course,  not  all  of  the  individuals  who  might  encroach  upon  those 
rights  are  under  the  control  of  the  prosecutor,  but  where  this  rule  applies,  the 
prosecutor  must  take  reasonable  and  appropriate  steps  to  assure  that  the 
defendant’s rights are protected.  

Rule 5.4.  Professional Independence of a Lawyer. 

(a) A lawyer or law firm shall not share legal fees with a nonlawyer, except that:  

(1)  an  agreement  by  a  lawyer  with  the  lawyer’s  firm,  partner,  or  associate  may 
provide  for  the  payment  of  money,  over  a  reasonable  period  of  time  after  the 
lawyer’s death, to the lawyer’s estate, or to one or more specified persons;  

(2)  a  lawyer  who  purchases  the  practice  of  a  deceased,  disabled,  or  disappeared 
lawyer  may,  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Rule  1.17,  pay  to  the  estate  or  other 
representative of that lawyer the agreed-upon purchase price;  

(3)  a  lawyer  or  law  firm  may  include  nonlawyer  employees  in  a  compensation  or 
retirement  plan,  even  though  the  plan  is  based  in  whole  or  in  part  on  a  profit-
sharing arrangement; and 

(4) a lawyer may share court-awarded legal fees with a nonprofit organization that 
employed, retained, or recommended employment of the lawyer in the matter.  

(b) A lawyer shall not form a partnership with a nonlawyer if any of the activities of 
the partnership consist of the practice of law.  

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

82 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

(c)  A  lawyer  shall  not  permit  a  person  who  recommends,  employs,  or  pays  the 
lawyer  to  render  legal  services  for  another  to  direct  or  regulate  the  lawyer’s 
professional judgment in rendering such legal services.  

(d)  A  lawyer  shall  not  practice  with  or  in the  form  of  a  professional  corporation  or 
association authorized to practice law for a profit, if:  

(1) a nonlawyer owns any interest therein, except that a fiduciary representative of 
the estate of a lawyer may hold the stock or interest of the lawyer for a reasonable 
time during administration;  

(2)  a  nonlawyer  is  a  corporate  director  or  officer  thereof,  or  one  who  occupies  a 
position of similar responsibility in any form of association other than a corporation; 
or  

(3)  a  nonlawyer  has  the  right  to  direct  or  control  the  professional  judgment  of  a 
lawyer.  

Comment:  

The  provisions  of  this  rule  express  traditional  limitations  on  sharing  fees.    These 
limitations  are  to  protect  the  lawyer’s  professional  independence  of  judgment.  
Where someone other than the client pays the lawyer’s fee or salary, or recommends 
employment  of  the  lawyer,  that  arrangement  does  not  modify  the  lawyer’s 
obligation to the client.  As stated in paragraph (c), such arrangements should not 
interfere with the lawyer’s professional judgment. 

This rule also expresses traditional limitations on permitting a third party to direct 
or  regulate  the  lawyer’s  professional  judgment  in  rendering  legal  services  to 
another.    See also  Rule 1.8(f)  (lawyer  may accept  compensation  from  a  third  party 
as  long  as  there  is  no  interference  with  the  lawyer’s  independent  professional 
judgment and the client gives consent. 

Rule 5.5.  Unauthorized Practice of Law; Multijurisdictional Practice of 
Law. 

(a) A lawyer shall not practice law in a jurisdiction in violation of the regulation of 
the legal profession in that jurisdiction, or assist another in doing so. 

(b) A lawyer who is not admitted to practice in this jurisdiction shall not: 

(1) except as authorized by law or these rules, establish an office or other systematic 
and continuous presence in this jurisdiction for the practice of law; or 

(2)  hold  out  to  the  public  or  otherwise  represent  that  the  lawyer  is  admitted  to 
practice law in this jurisdiction. 

(c) A lawyer admitted in another jurisdiction of the United States and not disbarred 
or suspended from practice in any jurisdiction may provide temporary legal services 
in this jurisdiction that: 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

83 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

(1) are undertaken in association with a lawyer who is admitted to practice in this 
jurisdiction and who actively participates in the matter; 

(2)  are  in  or  reasonably  related  to  a  pending  or  potential  proceeding  before  a 
tribunal  in  this  or  another  jurisdiction,  if  the  lawyer  or  a  person  the  lawyer  is 
assisting is authorized by law to appear in such proceeding or reasonably expects to 
be so authorized; 

(3) are in or reasonably related to a pending or potential arbitration, mediation, or 
other alternative dispute resolution proceeding in this or another jurisdiction, if the 
services  arise  out  of  or  are  reasonably  related  to  the  lawyer’s  practice  in  a 
jurisdiction  in  which  the  lawyer  is  admitted  to  practice  and  are  not  services  for 
which the forum requires pro hac vice admission; or 

(4) are not covered by paragraphs (c)(2) or (c)(3) and arise out of or are reasonably 
related to the lawyer’s practice in a jurisdiction in which the lawyer is admitted to 
practice. 

(d) A lawyer admitted in another jurisdiction of the United States and not disbarred 
or  suspended  from  practice  in  any  jurisdiction  may  provide  legal  services  in  this 
jurisdiction that: 

(1) are provided to the lawyer’s employer or its organizational affiliates and are not 
services for which the forum requires pro hac vice admission; or 

(2) are services that the lawyer is authorized by law to provide in this jurisdiction. 

Comment:  

A lawyer may practice law only in a jurisdiction in which the lawyer is authorized to 
practice.    A  lawyer  may  be  admitted  to  practice  law  in  a  jurisdiction  on  a  regular 
basis  or  may  be  authorized  by  law,  order,  or  court  rule  to  practice  for  a  limited 
purpose  or  on  a  restricted  basis.    See,  for  example,  MCR  8.126,  which  permits, 
under certain circumstances, the temporary admission to the bar of a person who is 
licensed  to  practice  law  in  another  jurisdiction,  and  Rule  5(E)  of  the  Rules  for  the 
Board of Law Examiners, which permits a lawyer who is admitted to practice in a 
foreign  country  to  practice  in  Michigan  as  a  special  legal  consultant,  without 
examination, provided certain conditions are met.   

Paragraph  (a)  applies  to  the  unauthorized  practice  of  law  by  a  lawyer,  whether 
through  the  lawyer’s  direct  action  or  by  the  lawyer  assisting  another  person.    The 
definition  of  the  practice  of  law  is  established  by  law  and  varies  from  one 
jurisdiction  to  another.    Whatever  the  definition,  limiting  the  practice  of  law  to 
members  of  the  bar  protects  the  public  against  rendition  of  legal  services  by 
unqualified  persons.    This  rule  does  not  prohibit  a  lawyer  from  employing  the 
services of paraprofessionals and delegating functions to them, so long as the lawyer 
supervises the delegated work and retains responsibility for it.  See Rule 5.3.   

A  lawyer  may  provide  professional  advice  and  instruction  to  nonlawyers  whose 
employment  requires  knowledge  of  the  law,  for  example,  claims  adjusters, 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

84 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

employees  of  financial  or  commercial  institutions,  social  workers,  accountants  and 
persons  employed  in  government  agencies.    Lawyers  also  may  assist  independent 
nonlawyers,  such  as  paraprofessionals,  who  are  authorized  by  the  law  of  a 
jurisdiction  to  provide  particular  law-related  services.    In  addition,  a  lawyer  may 
counsel nonlawyers who wish to proceed pro se. 

Other  than  as  authorized  by  law  or  this  rule,  a  lawyer  who  is  not  admitted  to 
practice  generally  in  this  jurisdiction  violates  paragraph  (b)  if  the  lawyer 
establishes an office or other systematic and continuous presence in this jurisdiction 
for  the  practice  of  law.    Presence  may  be  systematic  and  continuous  even  if  the 
lawyer is not physically present here.  Such a lawyer must not hold out to the public 
or  otherwise  represent  that  the  lawyer  is  admitted  to  practice  law  in  this 
jurisdiction.  See also Rules 7.1(a) and 7.5(b). 

There are occasions on which a lawyer admitted to practice in another jurisdiction 
of  the  United  States  and  not  disbarred  or  suspended  from  practice  in  any 
jurisdiction  may  provide  legal  services  on  a  temporary  basis  in  this  jurisdiction 
under  circumstances  that  do  not  create  an  unreasonable  risk  to  the  interests  of 
clients, the public, or the courts.  Paragraph (c) identifies four such circumstances.  
The  fact  that  conduct  is  not  so  identified  does  not  indicate  whether  the  conduct  is 
authorized.    With  the  exception  of  paragraphs  (d)(1)  and  (d)(2),  this  rule  does  not 
authorize  a  lawyer  to  establish  an  office  or  other  systematic  and  continuous 
presence in this jurisdiction without being admitted here to practice generally. 

There  is  no  single  test  to  determine  whether  a  lawyer’s  services  are  provided  on a 
“temporary  basis”  in  this  jurisdiction  and,  therefore,  may  be  permissible  under 
paragraph  (c).    Services  may  be  “temporary”  even  though  the  lawyer  provides 
services in this jurisdiction on a recurring basis or for an extended period of time, as 
when the lawyer is representing a client in a single lengthy negotiation or litigation. 

Paragraphs  (c)  and  (d)  apply  to  lawyers  who  are  admitted  to  practice  law  in  any 
jurisdiction of the United States, including the District of Columbia and any state, 
territory,  or  commonwealth.    The  word  “admitted”  in  paragraph  (c)  contemplates 
that the lawyer is authorized to practice and is in good standing to practice in the 
jurisdiction  in  which  the  lawyer  is  admitted  and  excludes  a  lawyer  who,  while 
technically admitted, is not authorized to practice because, for example, the lawyer 
is on inactive status or is suspended for nonpayment of dues.   

Paragraph (c)(1) recognizes that the interests of clients and the public are protected 
if a lawyer admitted only in another jurisdiction associates with a lawyer licensed to 
practice  in  this  jurisdiction.    For  this  paragraph  to  apply,  however,  the  lawyer 
admitted  to  practice  in  this  jurisdiction  must  actively  participate  in  and  share 
responsibility for the representation of the client.   

Lawyers  not  admitted  to  practice  generally  in  a  jurisdiction  may  be  authorized  by 
law or order of a tribunal or an administrative agency to appear before the tribunal 
or  agency.    This  authority  may  be  granted  pursuant  to  formal  rules  governing 
admission pro hac vice, such as MCR 8.126, or pursuant to informal practice of the 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

85 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

tribunal or agency.  Under paragraph (c)(2), a lawyer does not violate this rule when 
the lawyer appears before a tribunal or agency pursuant to such authority.  To the 
extent that a law or court rule of this jurisdiction requires that a lawyer who is not 
admitted  to  practice  in  this  jurisdiction  obtain  admission  pro  hac  vice  before 
appearing before a tribunal or administrative agency, this rule requires the lawyer 
to obtain that authority.   

Paragraph  (c)(2)  also  provides  that  a  lawyer  rendering  services  in  this  jurisdiction 
on a temporary basis does not violate this rule when the lawyer engages in conduct 
in  anticipation  of  a  proceeding  or  hearing  in  a  jurisdiction  in  which  the  lawyer  is 
authorized to practice law or in which the lawyer reasonably expects to be admitted 
pro hac vice under MCR 8.126.  Examples of such conduct include meetings with a 
client, interviews of potential witnesses, and the review of documents.  Similarly, a 
lawyer  admitted  only  in  another  jurisdiction  may  engage  temporarily  in  this 
jurisdiction in conduct related to pending litigation in another jurisdiction in which 
the  lawyer  is  or  reasonably  expects  to  be  authorized  to  appear,  including  taking 
depositions in this jurisdiction. 

When  a  lawyer  has  been  or  reasonably  expects  to  be  admitted  to  appear  before  a 
court  or  administrative  agency,  paragraph  (c)(2)  also  permits  conduct  by  lawyers 
who are associated with that lawyer in the matter but who do not expect to appear 
before  the  court  or  administrative agency.    For  example,  subordinate  lawyers  may 
conduct research, review documents, and attend meetings with witnesses in support 
of the lawyer responsible for the litigation. 

Paragraph (c)(3) permits a lawyer admitted to practice law in another jurisdiction to 
perform  services  on  a  temporary  basis  in  this  jurisdiction,  provided  that  those 
services  are  in  or  are  reasonably  related  to  a  pending  or  potential  arbitration, 
mediation,  or  other  alternative  dispute  resolution  proceeding  in  this  or  another 
jurisdiction  and  the  services  arise  out  of  or  are  reasonably  related  to  the  lawyer’s 
practice  in  a  jurisdiction  in which  the lawyer  is  admitted  to  practice.    The lawyer, 
however,  must  obtain  admission  pro  hac  vice  under  MCR  8.126  in  the  case  of  a 
court-annexed  arbitration  or  mediation,  or  otherwise  if  required  by  court  rule  or 
law.   

Paragraph  (c)(4)  permits  a  lawyer  admitted  in  another  jurisdiction  to  provide 
certain legal services on a temporary basis in this jurisdiction if they arise out of or 
are reasonably related to the lawyer’s practice in a jurisdiction in which the lawyer 
is admitted but are not covered by paragraphs (c)(2) or (c)(3).  These services include 
both legal services and services performed by nonlawyers that would be considered 
the practice of law if performed by lawyers.   

Paragraphs  (c)(3)  and  (c)(4)  require  that  the  services  arise  out  of  or  be  reasonably 
related to the lawyer’s practice in a jurisdiction in which the lawyer is admitted.  A 
variety  of  factors  indicate  such  a  relationship.    The  lawyer’s  client  previously  may 
have been represented by the lawyer or may reside in or have substantial contacts 
with  the  jurisdiction  in  which  the  lawyer  is  admitted.    The  matter,  although 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

86 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

involving  other  jurisdictions,  may  have  a  significant  connection  with  that 
jurisdiction.    In  other  cases,  significant  aspects  of  the  lawyer’s  work  may  be 
conducted in that jurisdiction or a significant aspect of the matter may involve the 
law  of  that  jurisdiction.    The  necessary  relationship  may  arise  when  the  client’s 
activities or the legal issues involve multiple jurisdictions, such as when the officers 
of a multinational corporation survey potential business sites and seek the services 
of the corporation’s lawyer in assessing the relative merits of each.  In addition, the 
services  may  draw  on  the  lawyer’s  recognized  expertise,  as  developed  through  the 
regular practice of law on behalf of clients in matters involving a particular body of 
federal, nationally uniform, foreign, or international law. 

Paragraph  (d)  identifies  two  circumstances  in  which  a  lawyer  who  is  admitted  to 
practice  in  another  jurisdiction  of  the  United  States  and  is  not  disbarred  or 
suspended  from  practice  in  any  jurisdiction  may  establish  an  office  or  other 
systematic  and  continuous  presence  in  this  jurisdiction  for  the  practice  of  law  as 
well  as  to  provide  legal  services  on  a  temporary  basis.    Except  as  provided  in 
paragraphs  (d)(1)  and  (d)(2),  a  lawyer  who  is  admitted  to  practice  law  in  another 
jurisdiction  and  who  establishes  an  office  or  other  systematic  or  continuous 
presence in this jurisdiction must become admitted to practice law generally in this 
jurisdiction.   

Paragraph  (d)(1)  applies  to  a  lawyer  who  is  employed  by  a  client  to  provide  legal 
services  to  the  client  or  its  organizational  affiliates,  i.e.,  entities  that  control,  are 
controlled by, or are under common control with the employer.  This paragraph does 
not  authorize  the  provision  of  personal  legal  services  to  the  employer’s  officers  or 
employees.    This  paragraph  applies  to  in-house  corporate  lawyers,  government 
lawyers, and others who are employed to render legal services to the employer.  The 
lawyer’s  ability  to  represent  the  employer  outside  the  jurisdiction  in  which  the 
lawyer is licensed generally serves the interests of the employer and does not create 
an unreasonable risk to the client and others because the employer is well situated 
to assess the lawyer’s qualifications and the quality of the lawyer’s work.   

If  an  employed  lawyer  establishes  an  office  or  other  systematic  presence  in  this 
jurisdiction for the  purpose of rendering legal services to the employer, the lawyer 
may  be  subject  to  registration  or  other  requirements,  including  assessments  for 
client protection funds and mandatory continuing legal education. 

Paragraph  (d)(2)  recognizes  that  a  lawyer  may  provide  legal  services  in  a 
jurisdiction in which the lawyer is not licensed when authorized to do so by statute, 
court rule, executive regulation, or judicial precedent. 

A  lawyer  who  practices  law  in  this  jurisdiction  is  subject  to  the  disciplinary 
authority of this jurisdiction.  See Rule 8.5(a). 

In some circumstances, a lawyer who practices law in this jurisdiction pursuant to 
paragraphs  (c)  or  (d)  may  be  required  to  inform  the  client  that  the  lawyer  is  not 
licensed  to  practice  law  in  this  jurisdiction.    For  example,  such  disclosure  may  be 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

87 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

required when the representation occurs primarily in this jurisdiction and requires 
knowledge of the law of this jurisdiction.  See Rule 1.4(b). 

Paragraphs  (c)  and  (d)  do  not  authorize  lawyers  who  are  admitted  to  practice  in 
other  jurisdictions  to  advertise  legal  services  to  prospective  clients  in  this 
jurisdiction.    Whether  and  how  lawyers  may  communicate  the  availability  of  their 
services to prospective clients in this jurisdiction is governed by Rules 7.1 to 7.5. 

Rule 5.6.  Restrictions on Right to Practice. 

A lawyer shall not participate in offering or making:  

(a)  a  partnership  or  employment  agreement  that  restricts  the  right  of  a  lawyer  to 
practice  after  termination  of  the  relationship,  except  an  agreement  concerning 
benefits upon retirement or as permitted in Rule 1.17; or  

(b)  an  agreement  in  which  a  restriction  on  the  lawyer’s  right  to  practice  is  part  of 
the settlement of a controversy between private parties.  

Comment:  

An  agreement  restricting  the  right  of  a  lawyer  to  practice  after  leaving  a  firm  not 
only limits the lawyer’s professional autonomy but also limits the freedom of clients 
to choose a lawyer.  Paragraph (a) prohibits such agreements except for restrictions 
incident  to  provisions  concerning  retirement  benefits  for  service  with  the  firm  or 
restrictions included in the terms of a sale pursuant to MRPC 1.17. 

Paragraph  (b)  prohibits  a  lawyer  from  agreeing  not  to  represent  other  persons  in 
connection with settling a claim on behalf of a client.  

Rule 5.7.  Responsibilities Regarding Law-Related Services. 

(a)  A  lawyer  shall  be  subject  to  the  Michigan  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  with 
respect  to  the  provision  of  law-related  services,  as  defined  in  paragraph  (b),  if  the 
law-related services are provided: 

(1) by the lawyer in circumstances that are not distinct from the lawyer’s provision 
of legal services to clients; or 

(2) in other circumstances by an entity controlled by the lawyer individually or with 
others  if  the  lawyer  fails  to  take  reasonable  measures  to  assure  that  a  person 
obtaining the law-related services knows that the services are not legal services and 
that the protections of the client-lawyer relationship do not exist. 

(b)  The  term  “law-related  services”  denotes  services  that  might  reasonably  be 
performed in conjunction with and in substance are related to the provision of legal 
services, and that are not prohibited as unauthorized practice of law when provided 
by a nonlawyer. 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct

Comment:  

When a lawyer performs law-related services or controls an organization that does 
so,  there  exists  the  potential  for  ethical  problems.    Principal  among  these  is  the 
possibility that the person for whom the law-related services are performed fails to 
understand  that  the  services  may  not  carry  with  them  the  protections  normally 
afforded  as  part  of  the  client-lawyer  relationship.    The  recipient  of  the law-related 
services  may  expect,  for  example,  that  the  protection  of  client  confidences, 
prohibitions  against  representation  of  persons  with  conflicting  interests,  and 
obligations of a lawyer to maintain professional independence apply to the provision 
of law-related services when that may not be the case. 

Rule 5.7 applies to the provision of law-related services by a lawyer even when the 
lawyer  does  not  provide  any  legal  services  to  the  person  for  whom  the  law-related 
services  are  performed,  and  regardless  of  whether  the  law-related  services  are 
performed  through  a  law  firm  or  a  separate  entity.    This  rule  identifies  the 
circumstances in which all the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct apply to the 
provision  of  law-related  services.    Even  when  those  circumstances  do  not  exist, 
however, the conduct of a lawyer involved in the provision of law-related services is 
subject  to  those  rules  that  apply  generally  to  lawyer  conduct,  regardless  whether 
the conduct involves the provision of legal services.  See, e.g., Rule 8.4. 

When  law-related  services  are  provided  by  a  lawyer  under  circumstances  that  are 
not  distinct  from  the  lawyer’s  provision  of  legal  services  to  clients,  the  lawyer 
providing the law-related services must adhere to the requirements of the Michigan 
Rules of Professional Conduct as provided in paragraph (a)(1).  Even when the law-
related and legal services are provided in circumstances that are distinct from each 
other,  for  example  through  separate  entities  or  different  support  staff  within  the 
law  firm,  the  Michigan  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  apply  to  the  lawyer  as 
provided in paragraph (a)(2) unless the lawyer takes reasonable measures to assure 
that  the  recipient  of  the  law-related  services  knows  that  the  services  are  not  legal 
services and that the protections of the client-lawyer relationship do not apply. 

Law-related  services  also  may  be  provided  through  an  entity  that  is  distinct  from 
that through which the lawyer provides legal services.  If the lawyer individually or 
with others has control of such an entity’s operations, this rule requires the lawyer 
to  take  reasonable  measures  to  assure  that  each  person  using  the  services  of  the 
entity knows that the services provided by the entity are not legal services and that 
the  Michigan  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  that  relate  to  the  client-lawyer 
relationship  do  not  apply.    A  lawyer’s  control  of  an  entity  extends  to  the  ability  to 
direct  its  operation.    Whether  a  lawyer  has  such  control  will  depend  upon  the 
circumstances of the particular case. 

When a client-lawyer relationship exists with a person who is referred by a lawyer 
to  a  separate  law-related  service  entity  controlled  by  the  lawyer,  individually  or 
with others, the lawyer must comply with Rule 1.8(a).

In taking the reasonable measures referred to in paragraph (a)(2) to assure that a 
person using law-related services understands the practical effect or significance of 
the inapplicability of the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct, the lawyer should 
communicate to the person receiving the law-related services, in a manner sufficient 
to  assure  that  the  person  understands  the  significance  of  the  fact,  that  the 
relationship  of  the  person  to  the  business  entity  will  not  be  a  client-lawyer 
relationship.  The communication should be made, preferably in writing, before law-
related services are provided or before an agreement is reached for provision of such 
services. 

The  burden  is  upon  the  lawyer  to  show  that  the  lawyer  has  taken  reasonable 
measures under the circumstances to communicate the desired understanding.  For 
instance,  a  sophisticated  user  of  law-related  services,  such  as  a  publicly  held 
corporation,  may  require  a  lesser  explanation  than  someone  unaccustomed  to 
making  distinctions  between  legal  services  and  law-related  services,  such  as  an 
individual seeking tax advice from a lawyer-accountant or investigative services in 
connection with a lawsuit. 

Regardless  of  the  sophistication  of  potential  recipients  of  law-related  services,  a 
lawyer  should  take  special  care  to  keep  separate  the  provision  of  law-related  and 
legal services in order to minimize the risk that the recipient will assume that the 
law-related services are legal services.  The risk of such confusion is especially acute 
when  the  lawyer  renders  both  types  of  services  with  respect  to  the  same  matter.  
Under  some  circumstances,  the  legal  and  law-related  services  may  be  so  closely 
entwined that they cannot be distinguished from each other, and the requirement of 
disclosure and consultation imposed by paragraph (a)(2) of the rule cannot be met.  
In  such  a  case,  a  lawyer  will  be  responsible  for  assuring  that  both  the  lawyer’s 
conduct and, to the extent required by Rule 5.3, that of nonlawyer employees in the 
distinct  entity  that  the  lawyer  controls,  comply  in  all  respects  with  the  Michigan 
Rules of Professional Conduct. 

A broad range of economic and other interests of clients may be served by lawyers’ 
engaging  in  the  delivery  of  law-related  services.    Examples  of  law-related  services 
include providing title insurance, financial planning, accounting, trust services, real 
estate counseling, legislative lobbying, economic analysis, social work, psychological 
counseling, tax preparation, and patent, medical, or environmental consulting. 

When a lawyer is obliged to accord the recipients of such services the protections of 
those  rules  that  apply  to  the  client-lawyer  relationship,  the  lawyer  must  take 
special  care  to  heed  the  proscriptions  of  the  rules  addressing  conflicts  of  interest, 
and to scrupulously adhere to the requirements of Rule 1.6 relating to disclosure of 
confidential information.  The promotion of the law-related services must also in all 
respects  comply  with  Rules  7.1  through  7.3,  dealing  with  advertising  and 
solicitation.    In  that  regard,  lawyers  should  take  special  care  to  identify  the 
obligations that may be imposed as a result of a jurisdiction’s decisional law.

When the full protections of all the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct do not 
apply to the provision of law-related services, principles of law external to the rules, 
for  example,  the  law  of  principal  and  agent,  govern  the  legal  duties  owed  to  those 
receiving the services.  Those other legal principles may establish a different degree 
of protection for the recipient with respect to confidentiality of information, conflicts 
of  interest,  and  permissible  business  relationships  with  clients.    See  also  Rule  8.4 
(Misconduct). 

RULES 6.1–6.6.  PUBLIC SERVICE. 

Rule 6.1.  Pro Bono Publico Service. 

A lawyer should render public interest legal service.  A lawyer may discharge this 
responsibility by providing professional services at no fee or a reduced fee to persons 
of  limited  means,  or  to  public  service  or  charitable  groups  or  organizations.    A 
lawyer may also discharge this responsibility by service in activities for improving 
the  law,  the  legal  system,  or  the  legal  profession,  and  by  financial  support  for 
organizations that provide legal services to persons of limited means.  

Comment:  

The ABA House of Delegates has formally acknowledged “the basic responsibility of 
each lawyer engaged in the practice of law to provide public interest legal services” 
without fee, or at a substantially reduced fee, in one or more of the following areas: 
poverty 
law,  charitable  organization 
representation  and  the  administration  of  justice.    This  rule  expresses  that  policy, 
but is not intended to be enforced through disciplinary process. 

law,  public  rights 

law,  civil  rights 

The rights and responsibilities of individuals and organizations in the United States 
are increasingly defined in legal terms.  As a consequence, legal assistance in coping 
with the web of statutes, rules and regulations is imperative for persons of modest 
and limited means, as well as for the relatively well-to-do.  

The  basic  responsibility  for  providing  legal  services  for  those  unable  to  pay 
ultimately  rests  upon  the  individual  lawyer,  and  personal  involvement  in  the 
problems of the disadvantaged can be one of the most rewarding experiences in the 
life of a lawyer.  Every lawyer, regardless of professional prominence or professional 
workload,  should  find  time  to  participate  in  or  otherwise  support  the  provision  of 
legal  services  to  the  disadvantaged.    The  provision  of  free  legal  services  to  those 
unable to pay reasonable fees continues to be an obligation of each lawyer as well as 
the profession generally, but the efforts of individual lawyers are often not enough 
to meet the need.  Thus, it has been necessary for the profession and government to 
institute  additional  programs  to  provide  legal  services.    Accordingly,  legal  aid 
offices,  lawyer  referral  services  and  other  related  programs  have  been  developed, 
and  others  will  be  developed  by  the  profession  and  government.    Every  lawyer 
should support all proper efforts to meet this need for legal services.

Rule 6.2.  Accepting Appointments. 

A  lawyer  shall  not  seek  to  avoid  appointment  by  a  tribunal  to  represent  a  person 
except for good cause, such as:  

(a) representing the client is likely to result in violation of the Rules of Professional 
Conduct or other law;  

(b) representing the client is likely to result in an unreasonable financial burden on 
the lawyer; or  

(c) the client or the cause is so repugnant to the lawyer as to be likely to impair the 
client-lawyer relationship or the lawyer’s ability to represent the client.  

Comment:  

A  lawyer  ordinarily  is  not  obliged  to  accept  a  client  whose  character  or  cause  the 
lawyer  regards  as  repugnant.    The  lawyer’s  freedom  to  select  clients  is,  however, 
qualified.  All lawyers have a responsibility to assist in providing pro bono publico 
service.  See Rule 6.1.  An individual lawyer fulfills this responsibility by accepting 
a  fair  share  of  unpopular  matters  or  indigent  or  unpopular  clients.   A  lawyer  may 
also  be  subject  to  appointment  by  a  court  to  serve  unpopular  clients  or  persons 
unable to afford legal services. 

Appointed Counsel. 

For good cause, a lawyer may seek to decline an appointment to represent a person 
who cannot afford to retain counsel or whose cause is unpopular.  Good cause exists 
if  the  lawyer  could  not  handle  the  matter  competently  (see  Rule  1.1)  or  if 
undertaking  the  representation  would  result  in  an  improper  conflict  of  interest.  
Good cause also exists if the client or the cause is so repugnant to the lawyer as to 
be likely to impair the client-lawyer relationship or the lawyer’s ability to represent 
the client.  A lawyer may also seek to decline an appointment if acceptance would be 
unreasonably  burdensome,  for  example,  when  it  would impose a  financial  sacrifice 
so great as to be unjust.  

An  appointed  lawyer  has  the  same  obligations  to  the  client  as  retained  counsel, 
including  the  obligations  of  loyalty  and  confidentiality,  and  is  subject  to  the  same 
limitations on the client-lawyer relationship, such as the obligation to refrain from 
assisting the client in violation of the rules.  

Rule 6.3.  Legal Services Organizations and Lawyer Referral Services. 

(a)  A  lawyer  may  serve  as  a  director,  officer,  or  member  of  a  legal  services 
organization,  apart 
lawyer  practices, 
notwithstanding that the organization serves persons having interests adverse to a 
client  of  the  lawyer.    The  lawyer  shall  not  knowingly  participate  in  a  decision  or 
action of the organization:

rules as may be adopted by the State Bar, consistent with these rules;  

(2) is operated in the public interest for the purpose of referring prospective clients 
to lawyers; pro bono and public service legal programs; and government, consumer 
or other agencies that can best provide the assistance needed by clients, in light of 
their  financial  circumstances,  spoken  language,  any  disability,  geographical 
convenience, and the nature and complexity of their problems;  

(3) is open to all lawyers licensed and eligible to practice in this state who maintain 
an office within the geographical area served, and who:  

(i) meet reasonable and objective requirements of experience, as established by the 
service;

established by the State Bar to encourage widespread lawyer participation; and  

(iii)  maintain  a  policy  of  errors  and  omissions  insurance,  or  provide  proof  of 
financial responsibility, in an amount at least equal to the minimum established by 
the State Bar;  

(4)  ensures  that  the  combined  fees  and  expenses  charged  a  prospective  client  by  a 
qualified  service  and  a  lawyer  to  whom  the  client  is  referred  not  exceed  the  total 
charges the client would have incurred had no referral service been involved; and  

(5)  makes  no  fee-generating  referral  to  any  lawyer  who  has  an  ownership  interest 
in,  or  who  operates  or  is  employed  by,  the  qualified  service,  or  who  is  associated 
with a law firm that has an ownership interest in, or operates or is employed by, a 
qualified service.  

(c) The requirements of subrule (b) do not apply to  

(1) a plan of prepaid legal services insurance authorized to operate in the state, or a 
group or prepaid legal plan, whether operated by a union, trust, mutual benefit or 
aid association, corporation or other entity or person, which provides unlimited or a 
specified  amount  of  telephone  advice  or  personal  communications  at  no  charge  to 
the members or beneficiaries, other than a periodic membership or beneficiary fee,

(d)  The  State  Bar  or  any  aggrieved  person  may  seek  an  injunction  in  the  circuit 
court to enjoin violations of subrule (b).  In the event the injunction is granted, the 
petitioner shall be entitled to reasonable costs and attorney fees.  

(e) A lawyer may participate in and pay the usual charges of a plan or organization 
defined in subrule (c)(1), if that plan or organization:  

(1)  has  filed  with  the  State  Bar  of  Michigan  a  written  plan  disclosing  the  name 
under  which  it  operates;  the  name,  address,  and  telephone  number  of  its  chief 
operating  officer;  and  the  plan  terms,  conditions  of  eligibility,  schedule  of  benefits, 
subscription charges and agreements with counsel;  

(2) updates its filings within 30 days of any material change;  

(3)  in  January  of  each  year  following  its  inception  files  a  statement  representing 
that  it  continues  to  do  business  under  the  terms  and  conditions  reflected  in  its 
filings as amended to date.  

These filing requirements shall not apply to not-for-profit legal aid associations.  

Comment:  

Lawyers  should  be  encouraged  to  support  and  participate  in  legal  service 
organizations.  A lawyer who is an officer or a member of such an organization does 
not  thereby  have  a  client-lawyer  relationship  with  persons  served  by  the 
organization.    However,  there  is  potential  conflict  between  the  interests  of  such 
persons  and  the  interests  of  the  lawyer’s  clients.    If  the  possibility  of  such  conflict 
disqualified a lawyer from serving on the board of a legal services organization, the 
profession’s involvement in such organizations would be severely curtailed. 

It  may  be  necessary  in  appropriate  cases  to  reassure  a  client  of  the  organization 
that  the  representation  will  not  be  affected  by  conflicting  loyalties  of  a  member  of 
the board.  Established, written policies in this respect can enhance the credibility 
of such assurances.  

The  restriction  on  lawyer  participation  with  legal  services  and  lawyer  referral 
service organizations to those that file their plans with the State Bar of Michigan is 
intended  to  facilitate  the  establishment  of  a  single,  central  repository  of  all  such 
organizations  in  Michigan  and  of  the  terms  and  conditions  under  which  they 
operate.  The existence of that repository would make it possible for the State Bar of 
Michigan  annually  to  prepare  and  make  publicly  available  a  directory  of  legal 
services  and  lawyer  referral  service  organizations  in  Michigan.    Absent  such  a 
central  repository,  reliable 
information  concerning  the  status  of  all  such 
organizations might not be available.

The 1990 amendment to MRPC 6.3(b) was made at the request of the State Bar of 
Michigan.  

Rule 6.4.  Law Reform Activities Affecting Client Interests. 

A lawyer may serve as a director, officer, or member of an organization involved in 
reform of the law or administration of the law notwithstanding that the reform may 
affect  the  interests  of  a  client  of  the  lawyer.    When  the  lawyer  knows  that  the 
interests of a client may be materially benefitted by a decision in which the lawyer 
participates, the lawyer shall disclose that fact but need not identify the client.  

Comment:  

Lawyers  involved  in  organizations  seeking  law  reform  generally  do  not  have  a 
client-lawyer relationship with the organization.  Otherwise, it might follow that a 
lawyer  could  not  be  involved  in  a  bar  association  law  reform  program  that  might 
indirectly affect a client.  See also the comment to Rule 1.2.  For example, a lawyer 
specializing  in  antitrust  litigation  might  be  regarded  as  disqualified  from 
participating  in  drafting  revisions  of  rules  governing  that  subject.   In  determining 
the nature and scope of participation in such activities, a lawyer should be mindful 
of  obligations  to  clients  under  other  rules,  particularly  Rule  1.7.    A  lawyer  is 
professionally  obligated  to  protect  the  integrity  of  the  program  by  making  an 
appropriate  disclosure  within  the  organization  when  the  lawyer  knows  a  private 
client might be materially benefitted. 

Rule 6.5.  Professional Conduct. 

(a) A lawyer shall treat with courtesy and respect all persons involved in the legal 
process.    A  lawyer  shall  take  particular  care  to  avoid  treating  such  a  person 
discourteously  or  disrespectfully  because  of  the  person’s  race,  gender,  or  other 
protected  personal  characteristic.    To  the  extent  possible,  a  lawyer  shall  require 
subordinate  lawyers  and  nonlawyer  assistants  to  provide  such  courteous  and 
respectful treatment.  

(b)  A  lawyer  serving  as  an  adjudicative  officer  shall,  without  regard  to  a  person’s 
race,  gender,  or  other  protected  personal  characteristic,  treat  every  person  fairly, 
with courtesy and respect.  To the extent possible, the lawyer shall require staff and 
others  who  are  subject  to  the  adjudicative  officer’s  direction  and  control  to  provide 
such fair, courteous, and respectful treatment to persons who have contact with the 
adjudicative tribunal.  

Comment: 

Duties of the Lawyer. 

A  lawyer  is  an  officer  of  the  court  who  has  sworn  to  uphold  the  federal  and  state 
constitutions,  to  proceed  only  by  means  that  are  truthful  and  honorable,  and  to 
avoid  offensive  personality.    It  follows  that  such  a  professional  must  treat  clients 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

95 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

and  third  persons  with  courtesy  and  respect.    For  many  citizens,  contact  with  a 
lawyer  is  the  first  or  only  contact  with  the  legal  system.    Respect  for  law  and  for 
legal  institutions  is  diminished  whenever  a  lawyer  neglects  the  obligation  to  treat 
persons properly.  It is increased when the obligation is met.  

A  lawyer  must  pursue  a  client’s  interests  with  diligence.    This  often  requires  the 
lawyer to frame questions and statements in bold and direct terms.  The obligation 
to  treat  persons  with  courtesy  and  respect  is  not  inconsistent  with  the  lawyer’s 
right, where appropriate, to speak and write bluntly.  Obviously, it is not possible to 
formulate a rule that will clearly divide what is properly challenging from what is 
impermissibly rude.  A lawyer’s professional judgment must be employed here with 
care and discretion.  

A  lawyer  must  take  particular  care  to  avoid  words  or  actions  that  appear  to  be 
improperly  based  upon  a  person’s  race,  gender,  or  other  protected  personal 
characteristic.    Legal  institutions,  and  those  who  serve  them,  should  take 
leadership roles in assuring equal treatment for all.  

A judge must act “[a]t all times” in a manner that promotes public confidence in the 
impartiality of the judiciary.  Canon 2(B) of the Code of Judicial Conduct.  See also 
Canon  5.    By  contrast,  a  lawyer’s  private  conduct  is  largely  beyond  the  scope  of 
these  rules.    See  Rule  8.4.    However,  a  lawyer’s  private  conduct  should  not  cast 
doubt on the lawyer’s commitment to equal justice under law.  

A  supervisory  lawyer  should  make  every  reasonable  effort  to  ensure  that 
subordinate  lawyers  and  nonlawyer  assistants,  as  well  as  other  agents,  avoid 
discourteous or disrespectful behavior toward persons involved in the legal process.  
Further,  a  supervisory  lawyer  should  make  reasonable  efforts  to  ensure  that  the 
firm has in effect policies and procedures that do not discriminate against members 
or  employees  of  the  firm  on  the  basis  of  race,  gender,  or  other  protected  personal 
characteristic.  See Rules 5.1 and 5.3.  

Duties of Adjudicative Officers. 

The  duties  of  an  adjudicative  officer  are  included  in  these  rules,  since  many 
legislatively  created  adjudicative  positions,  such  as  administrative  hearing  officer, 
are not covered by the Code of Judicial Conduct.  For parallel provisions for judges, 
see the Code of Judicial Conduct.  

Rule 6.6.  Nonprofit and Court-Annexed Limited Legal Services Programs. 

(a)  A  lawyer  who,  under  the  auspices  of  a  program  sponsored  by  a  nonprofit 
organization or court, provides short-term limited legal services to a client without 
expectation  by  either  the  lawyer  or  the  client  that  the  lawyer  will  provide 
continuing representation in the matter: 

(1)  is  subject  to  Rules  1.7  and  1.9(a)  only  if  the  lawyer  knows  that  the 
representation of the client involves a conflict of interest; and

(2) is subject to Rule 1.10 only if the lawyer knows that another lawyer associated 
with the lawyer in a law firm is disqualified by Rule 1.7 or 1.9(a) with respect to the 
matter. 

(b)  Except  as  provided  in  paragraph  (a)(2),  Rule  1.10  is  inapplicable  to  a 
representation governed by this rule. 

Comment:  

Legal  services  organizations,  courts,  and  various  nonprofit  organizations  have 
established  programs  through  which  lawyers  provide  short-term  limited  legal 
services,  such  as  advice  or  the  completion  of  legal  forms,  that  will  help  persons 
address their legal problems without further representation by a lawyer.  In these 
programs,  such  as  legal-advice  hotlines,  advice-only  clinics,  or  pro  se  counseling 
programs, a client-lawyer relationship may or may not be established as a matter of 
law,  but  regardless  there  is  no  expectation  that  the  lawyer’s  representation  of  the 
client  will  continue  beyond  the  limited  consultation.    Such  programs  are  normally 
operated  under  circumstances  in  which  it  is  not  feasible  for  a  lawyer  to 
systematically  screen  for  conflicts  of  interest  as  is  generally  required  before 
undertaking a representation.  See, e.g., Rules 1.7, 1.9, and 1.10. 

A lawyer who provides short-term limited legal services pursuant to this rule must 
secure  the  client’s  consent  to  the  scope  of  the  representation.    See  Rule  1.2.    If  a 
short-term limited representation would not be reasonable under the circumstances, 
the lawyer may offer advice to the client but must also advise the client of the need 
for  further  assistance  of  counsel.    Except  as  provided  in  this  rule,  the  Michigan 
Rules of Professional Conduct, including Rules 1.6 and 1.9(c), are applicable to the 
limited representation. 

Because  a  lawyer  who  is  representing  a  client  in  the  circumstances  addressed  by 
this  rule  ordinarily  is  not  able  to  check  systematically  for  conflicts  of  interest, 
paragraph (a) requires compliance with Rules 1.7 or 1.9(a) only if the lawyer knows 
that the representation presents a conflict of interest for the lawyer, and with Rule 
1.10  only  if  the  lawyer  knows  that  another  lawyer  in  the  lawyer’s  firm  is 
disqualified by Rules 1.7 or 1.9(a) in the matter. 

Because the limited nature of the services significantly reduces the risk of conflicts 
of  interest  with  other  matters  being  handled  by  the  lawyer’s  firm,  paragraph  (b) 
provides  that  Rule  1.10  is  inapplicable  to  a  representation  governed  by  this  rule 
except as provided by paragraph (a)(2).  Paragraph (a)(2) requires the participating 
lawyer  to  comply  with  Rule  1.10  when  the  lawyer  knows  that  the  lawyer’s  firm  is 
disqualified by Rules 1.7 or 1.9(a).  By virtue of paragraph (b), however, a lawyer’s 
participation  in  a  short-term  limited  legal  services  program  will  not  preclude  the 
lawyer’s  firm  from  undertaking  or  continuing  the  representation  of  a  client  with 
interests  adverse  to  a  client  being  represented  under  the  program’s  auspices.    Nor 
will  the  personal  disqualification  of  a  lawyer  participating  in  the  program  be 
imputed to other lawyers participating in the program.

If,  after  commencing  a  short-term  limited  representation  in  accordance  with  this 
rule, a lawyer undertakes to represent the client in the matter on an ongoing basis, 
Rules 1.7, 1.9(a), and 1.10 become applicable. 

RULES 7.1–7.5.  INFORMATION ABOUT LEGAL SERVICES. 

Rule 7.1.  Communications Concerning a Lawyer’s Services. 

A lawyer may, on the lawyer’s own behalf, on behalf of a partner or associate, or on 
behalf of any other lawyer affiliated with the lawyer or the lawyer’s law firm, use or 
participate  in  the  use  of  any  form  of  public  communication  that  is  not  false, 
fraudulent, misleading, or deceptive.  A communication shall not:  

(a)  contain  a  material  misrepresentation  of  fact  or law,  or  omit a  fact  necessary  to 
make the statement considered as a whole not materially misleading;  

(b)  be  likely  to  create  an  unjustified  expectation  about  results  the  lawyer  can 
achieve, or state or imply that the lawyer can achieve results by means that violate 
the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law; or  

(c)  compare  the  lawyer’s  services  with  other  lawyers’  services,  unless  the 
comparison can be factually substantiated.  

Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  this  rule,  a  lawyer  who  is  a  retired  or  former 
justice,  judge,  referee,  or  magistrate  may use  the  title  (“justice,”  “judge,”  “referee,” 
or “magistrate”) only when the title is preceded by the word “retired” or “former.”  A 
justice,  judge,  referee,  or  magistrate  who  is  removed  from  office  or  terminated  on 
grounds of misconduct is prohibited from using the title. 

Comment:  

This  rule  governs  all  communications  about  a  lawyer’s  services,  including 
advertising  permitted  by  Rule  7.2.    Whatever  means  are  used  to  make  known  a 
lawyer’s  services,  statements  about  them  should  be  truthful.    The  prohibition  in 
paragraph  (b)  of  statements  that  may  create  “an  unjustified  expectation”  would 
ordinarily preclude advertisements about results obtained on behalf of a client, such 
as  the  amount  of  a  damage  award  or  the  lawyer’s  record  in  obtaining  favorable 
verdicts,  and  would  ordinarily  preclude  advertisements  containing  client 
endorsements.    Such  information  may  create  the  unjustified  expectation  that 
similar  results  can  be  obtained  for  others  without  reference  to  the  specific  factual 
and legal circumstances. 

Rule 7.2.  Advertising. 

(a) Subject to the provisions of these rules, a lawyer may advertise.  

(b) A copy or recording of an advertisement or communication shall be kept for two 
years  after  its  last  dissemination  along  with  a  record  of  when  and  where  it  was 
used.

lawyer’s services, except that a lawyer may:  

(i) pay the reasonable cost of advertising or communication permitted by this rule;  

(ii)  participate  in,  and  pay  the  usual  charges  of,  a  not-for-profit  lawyer  referral 
service  or  other  legal  service  organization  that  satisfies  the  requirements  of  Rule 
6.3(b); and  

(iii) pay for a law practice in accordance with Rule 1.17.  

(d)  For  purposes  of  media  advertising,  services  of  a  lawyer  or  law  firm  that  are 
advertised under the heading of a phone number, web address, icon, or trade name 
shall  identify  the  name  and  contact  information  of  at  least  one  lawyer  responsible 
for  the  content  of  the  advertisement.    The  identification  shall  appear  on  or  in  the 
advertisement  itself;  or,  if  that  is  not  practical  due  to  space  limitations,  the 
identification  shall  be  prominently  displayed  on  the  home  page  of  the  law  firm’s 
website and any other website used by the law firm for advertising purposes. 

Comment:  

To assist the public in obtaining legal services, lawyers should be allowed to make 
known  their  services  not  only  through  reputation  but  also  through  organized 
information  campaigns  in  the  form  of  advertising.    Advertising  involves  an  active 
quest  for  clients,  contrary  to  the  tradition  that  a  lawyer  should  not  seek  clientele.  
However,  the  public’s  need  to  know  about  legal  services  can  be  fulfilled  in  part 
through  advertising.    This  need  is  particularly  acute  in  the  case  of  persons  of 
moderate means who have not made extensive use of legal services.  The interest in 
expanding  public 
legal  services  ought  to  prevail  over 
considerations of tradition.  Nevertheless, advertising by lawyers entails the risk of 
practices that are misleading or overreaching. 

information  about 

Neither this rule nor Rule 7.3 prohibits communications authorized by law, such as 
notice to members of a class in a class action.  

Record of Advertising. 

Paragraph (b) requires that a record of the content and use of advertising be kept in 
order to facilitate enforcement of these rules.  

Paying Others to Recommend a Lawyer. 

A  lawyer  is  allowed  to  pay  for  advertising  permitted  by  these  rules  and  for  the 
purchase  of  a  law  practice  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  MRPC  1.17,  but 
otherwise is not permitted to pay another person for channeling professional work.  
But  see  MRPC  1.5(e).   This  restriction  does  not  prevent  an  organization  or  person 
other  than  the  lawyer  from  advertising  or  recommending  the  lawyer’s  services.  
Thus,  a  legal  aid  agency  or  prepaid  legal  services  plan  may  pay  to  advertise  legal 
services provided under its auspices.  Likewise, a lawyer may participate in not-for-
profit  lawyer  referral  programs  and  pay  the  usual  fees  charged  by  such  programs.

Paragraph  (c)  does  not  prohibit  paying  regular  compensation  to  an  assistant,  such 
as a secretary, to prepare communications permitted by these rules.  

Rule 7.3.  Solicitation. 

(a) A lawyer shall not solicit professional employment from a person with whom the 
lawyer has no family or prior professional relationship when a significant motive for 
the  lawyer’s  doing  so  is  the  lawyer’s  pecuniary  gain.    The  term  “solicit”  includes 
contact in person, by telephone or telegraph, by letter or other writing, or by other 
communication  directed  to  a  specific  recipient,  but  does  not  include  letters 
addressed  or  advertising  circulars  distributed  generally  to  persons  not  known  to 
need  legal  services  of  the  kind  provided  by  the  lawyer  in  a  particular  matter,  but 
who  are  so  situated  that  they  might  in  general  find  such  services  useful,  nor  does 
the  term  “solicit”  include  “sending  truthful  and  nondeceptive  letters  to  potential 
clients  known  to  face  particular  legal  problems”  as  elucidated  in  Shapero  v 
Kentucky Bar Ass’n, 486 US 466, 468; 108 S Ct 1916; 100 L Ed 2d 475 (1988). 

(b)  A  lawyer  shall  not  solicit  professional employment  from  a  person  by  written  or 
recorded  communication  or  by  in-person  or  telephone  contact  even  when  not 
otherwise prohibited by paragraph (a), if:  

(1)  the  person  has  made  known  to  the  lawyer  a  desire  not  to  be  solicited  by  the 
lawyer; or  

(2) the solicitation involves coercion, duress or harassment.  

Comment:  

There is a potential for abuse inherent in direct contact by a lawyer with a person 
known to need legal services.  These forms of contact subject a person to the private 
importuning of the trained advocate in a direct interpersonal encounter.  A person, 
who may already feel overwhelmed by the circumstances giving rise to the need for 
legal  services,  may  find  it  difficult  to  evaluate  fully  all  available  alternatives  with 
reasoned  judgment  and  appropriate  self-interest  in  the  face  of  a  lawyer’s  presence 
and insistence upon being retained immediately.  The situation is fraught with the 
possibility of undue influence, intimidation, and overreaching. 

However,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  modified  the  traditional  ban  on 
written solicitation.  Shapero v Kentucky Bar Ass’n, 486 US 466; 108 S Ct 1916; 100 
L  Ed  2d  475  (1988).  Paragraph  (a)  of  this  rule  is  therefore  modified  to  the  extent 
required by the Shapero decision. 

The  potential  for  abuse  inherent  in  direct  solicitation  justifies  its  partial 
prohibition, particularly since lawyer advertising and the communication permitted 
under these rules are alternative means of communicating necessary information to 
those who may be in need of legal services.  

Advertising  and  permissible  communication  make  it  possible  for  a  person  to  be 
informed about the need for legal services, and about the qualifications of available 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct

lawyers  and  law  firms,  without  subjecting  a  person  to  impermissible  persuasion 
that may overwhelm a person’s judgment.  

The  use  of  general  advertising  and  communications  permitted  under  Shapero, 
rather  than  impermissible  direct  contact,  will  help  to  assure  that  the  information 
flows  cleanly  as  well  as  freely.    Advertising  is  out  in  public  view,  thus  subject  to 
scrutiny  by  those  who  know  the  lawyer.    The  contents  of  advertisements  and 
communications  permitted  under  Rule  7.2  are  permanently  recorded  so  that  they 
cannot  be  disputed  and  may  be  shared  with  others  who  know  the  lawyer.    This 
potential  for  informal  review  is  itself  likely  to  help  guard  against  statements  and 
claims  that  might  constitute  false  or  misleading  communications,  in  violation  of 
Rule 7.1.  The contents of some impermissible direct conversations can be disputed 
and  are  not  subject  to  third-party  scrutiny.    Consequently  they  are  much  more 
likely  to  approach  (and  occasionally  cross)  the  dividing  line  between  accurate 
representations and those that are false and misleading. 

There is far less likelihood that a lawyer would engage in abusive practices against 
an individual with whom the lawyer has a prior family or professional relationship 
or  where  the  lawyer  is  motivated  by  considerations  other  than  the  lawyer’s 
pecuniary  gain.    Consequently,  the  general  prohibition  in  Rule  7.3(a)  is  not 
applicable in those situations.  

This  rule  is  not  intended  to  prohibit  a  lawyer  from  contacting  representatives  of 
organizations  or  groups  that  may  be  interested  in  establishing  a  group  or  prepaid 
legal  plan  for  its  members,  insureds,  beneficiaries,  or  other  third  parties  for  the 
purpose of informing  such entities of the availability of, and detail concerning, the 
plan  or  arrangement  that  the  lawyer  or  the  lawyer’s  firm  is  willing  to  offer.    This 
form  of  communication  is  not  directed  to  a  specific  person  known  to  need  legal 
services  related  to  a  particular  matter.    Rather,  it  is  usually  addressed  to  an 
individual  acting  in  a  fiduciary  capacity  seeking  a  supplier  of  legal  services  for 
others  who  may,  if  they  choose,  become  clients  of  the  lawyer.    Under  these 
circumstances,  the  activity  which  the  lawyer  undertakes  in  communicating  with 
such representatives and the type of information transmitted to the individual are 
functionally similar to and serve the same purpose as advertising permitted under 
these rules.  

Rule 7.4.  Communication of Fields of Practice. 

A  lawyer  may  communicate  the  fact  that  the  lawyer  does  or  does  not  practice  in 
particular fields of law.  

Comment:  

This rule permits a lawyer to indicate areas of practice in communications about the 
lawyer’s  services,  for  example,  in  a  telephone  directory  or  other  advertising.    If  a 
lawyer  practices  only  in  certain  fields,  or  will  not  accept  matters  except  in  such 
fields, the lawyer is permitted to indicate that fact. 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct

Rule 7.5.  Firm Names and Letterheads. 

(a) A lawyer shall not use a firm name, letterhead or other professional designation 
that violates Rule 7.1.  A trade name may be used by a lawyer in private practice if 
it  does  not  imply  a  connection  with  a  government  agency  or  with  a  public  or 
charitable legal services organization and it is not otherwise in violation of Rule 7.1.  

(b) A law firm with offices in more than one jurisdiction may use the same name in 
each  jurisdiction,  but  identification  of  the  lawyers  in  an  office  of  the  firm  shall 
indicate  the  jurisdictional  limitations  on  those  not  licensed  to  practice  in  the 
jurisdiction where the office is located.  

(c) The name of a lawyer holding a public office shall not be used in the name of a 
law firm, or in communications on its behalf, during any substantial period in which 
the lawyer is not actively and regularly practicing with the firm.  

(d)  Lawyers  may  state  or  imply  that  they  practice  in  a  partnership  or  other 
organization only when that is the fact.  

Comment:  

A firm may be designated by the names of all or some of its members, by the names 
of  deceased  members  where  there  has  been  a  continuing  succession  in  the  firm’s 
identity or by a trade name such as the “ABC Legal Clinic.”  Although the United 
States Supreme Court has held that legislation may prohibit the use of trade names 
in professional practice, use of such names in law practice is acceptable so long as it 
is not misleading.  If a private firm uses a trade name that includes a geographical 
name  such  as  “Springfield  Legal  Clinic,”  an  express  disclaimer  that  it  is  a  public 
legal  aid  agency  may  be  required  to  avoid  a  misleading  implication.    It  may  be 
observed  that  any  firm  name  including  the  name  of  a  deceased  partner  is,  strictly 
speaking, a trade name.  The use of such names to designate law firms has proven a 
useful  means  of  identification.    However,  it  is  misleading  to  use  the  name  of  a 
lawyer not associated with the firm or with a predecessor of the firm. 

With  regard  to  paragraph  (d),  lawyers  sharing  office  facilities,  but  who  are  not  in 
fact partners, may not denominate themselves as, for example, “Smith and Jones,” 
for that title suggests partnership in the practice of law.  

RULES 8.1–8.5.  MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF THE PROFESSION. 

Rule 8.1.  Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters. 

(a)  An  applicant  for  admission  to  the  bar,  or  a  lawyer  in  connection  with  a  bar 
admission application or in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not 

(1) knowingly make a false statement of material fact, or 

(2)  fail  to  disclose  a  fact  necessary  to  correct  a  misapprehension  known  by  the 
person to have arisen in the matter, or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

102 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

for  information  from  an  admissions  or  disciplinary  authority,  except  that  this  rule 
does not require disclosure of information protected by Rule 1.6. 

(b) An applicant for admission to the bar 

(1)  shall  not  engage  in  the  unauthorized  practice  of  law  (this  does  not  apply  to 
activities permitted under MCR 8.120), and 

(2) has a continuing obligation, until the date of admission, to inform the standing 
committee  on  character  and  fitness,  in  writing,  if  any  answers  in  the  applicant’s 
affidavit of personal history change or cease to be true. 

Comment:  

The  duty  imposed  by  this  rule  extends  to  persons  seeking  admission  to  the  bar  as 
well  as  to  lawyers.    Hence,  if  a  person  makes  a  material  false  statement  in 
connection  with  an  application  for  admission,  it  may  be  the  basis  for  subsequent 
disciplinary action if the person is admitted, and in any event may be relevant in a 
subsequent  admission  application.    The  duty  imposed  by  this  rule  applies  to  a 
lawyer’s own admission or discipline as well as that of others.  Thus, it is a separate 
professional  offense  for  a  lawyer  to  knowingly  make  a  misrepresentation  or 
omission in connection with a disciplinary investigation of the lawyer’s own conduct.  
This rule also requires affirmative clarification of any misunderstanding on the part 
of  the  admissions  or  disciplinary  authority  of  which  the  person  involved  becomes 
aware. 

This rule is subject to the provisions of the Fifth Amendment of the United States 
Constitution  and  to  article  1,  section  17  of  the  Michigan  Constitution.    A  person 
relying on such a provision in response to a question, however, should do so openly 
and  not  use  the  right  of  nondisclosure  as  a  justification  for  failure  to  comply  with 
this rule.  

A  lawyer  representing  an  applicant  for  admission  to  the  bar,  or  representing  a 
lawyer who is the subject of a disciplinary inquiry or proceeding, is governed by the 
rules applicable to the client-lawyer relationship.  

Rule 8.2.  Judicial and Legal Officials. 

(a) A lawyer shall not make a statement that the lawyer knows to be false or with 
reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity concerning the qualifications or integrity 
of a judge, adjudicative officer, or public legal officer, or of a candidate for election or 
appointment to judicial or legal office.  

(b)  A  lawyer  who  is  a  candidate  for  judicial  office  shall  comply with  the  applicable 
provisions of the Code of Judicial Conduct as provided under Canon 5.  

Comment:  

Assessments  by  lawyers  are  relied  on  in  evaluating  the  professional  or  personal 
fitness of persons being considered for election or appointment to judicial office and 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

103 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

to  public  legal  offices,  such  as  attorney  general,  prosecuting  attorney  and  public 
defender.    Expressing  honest  and  candid  opinions  on  such  matters  contributes  to 
improving  the  administration  of  justice.    Conversely,  false  statements  by  a  lawyer 
can unfairly undermine public confidence in the administration of justice. 

To  maintain  the  fair  and  independent  administration  of  justice,  lawyers  are 
encouraged  to  continue  traditional  efforts  to  defend  judges  and  courts  unjustly 
criticized.  

Rule 8.3.  Reporting Professional Misconduct. 

(a)  A  lawyer  having  knowledge  that  another  lawyer  has  committed  a  significant 
violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct that raises a substantial question as 
to  that  lawyer’s  honesty,  trustworthiness,  or  fitness  as  a  lawyer  shall  inform  the 
Attorney Grievance Commission.  

(b) A lawyer having knowledge that a judge has committed a significant violation of 
the  Code  of  Judicial  Conduct  that  raises  a  substantial  question  as  to  the  judge’s 
honesty,  trustworthiness,  or  fitness  for  office  shall  inform  the  Judicial  Tenure 
Commission.  

(c) This rule does not require disclosure of: 

(1) information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6; or 

(2) information gained by a lawyer while serving as an employee or volunteer of the 
substance abuse counseling program of the State Bar of Michigan, to the extent the 
information  would  be  protected  under  Rule  1.6  from  disclosure  if  it  were  a 
communication between lawyer and client. 

Comment:  

Self-regulation  of  the  legal  profession  requires  that  members  of  the  profession 
initiate  disciplinary  investigation  when  they  know  of  a  violation  of  the  Rules  of 
Professional  Conduct.    Lawyers  have  a  similar  obligation  with  respect  to  judicial 
misconduct.  An apparently isolated violation may indicate a pattern of misconduct 
that  only  a  disciplinary  investigation  can  uncover.    Reporting  a  violation  is 
especially important where the victim is unlikely to discover the offense. 

A report about misconduct is not required where it would involve violation of Rule 
1.6.    However,  a  lawyer  should  encourage  a  client  to  consent  to  disclosure  where 
prosecution  would  not  substantially  prejudice  the  client’s  interests.    Because 
confidentiality  is  essential  to  encourage  lawyers  and  judges  to  seek  treatment, 
information  received  in  the  course  of  providing  counseling  services  in  the  State 
Bar’s  lawyers  and  judges  assistance  program  is  exempt  from  the  reporting 
requirement  to  the  extent  it  would  be  protected  under  Rule  1.6  if  it  were  a 
communication between lawyer and client.  

If a lawyer were obliged to report every violation of the rules, the failure to report 
any violation would itself be a professional offense.  Such a requirement existed in 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

104 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

many  jurisdictions  but  proved  to  be  unenforceable.    This  rule  limits  the  reporting 
obligation  to  those  offenses  that  a  self-regulating  profession  must  vigorously 
endeavor  to  prevent.    A  measure  of  judgment  is,  therefore,  required  in  complying 
with the provisions of this rule.  The term “substantial” refers to the seriousness of 
the possible offense and not the quantum of evidence of which the lawyer is aware.  

The  duty  to  report  professional  misconduct  does  not  apply  to  a  lawyer  retained  to 
represent  a  lawyer  whose  professional  conduct  is  in  question.    Such  a  situation  is 
governed by the rules applicable to the client-lawyer relationship.  

Rule 8.4.  Misconduct. 

It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:  

(a) violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist 
or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another;  

(b)  engage  in  conduct  involving  dishonesty,  fraud,  deceit,  misrepresentation,  or 
violation of the criminal law, where such conduct reflects adversely on the lawyer’s 
honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer;  

(c) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice;  

(d) state or imply an ability to influence improperly a government agency or official; 
or  

(e)  knowingly  assist  a  judge  or  judicial  officer  in  conduct  that  is  a  violation  of  the 
Code of Judicial Conduct or other law.  

Comment:  

Many  kinds  of  illegal  conduct  reflect  adversely  on  fitness  to  practice  law,  such  as 
offenses involving fraud and the offense of wilful failure to file an income tax return.  
However,  some  kinds  of  offenses  carry  no  such  implication.    Traditionally,  the 
distinction  was  drawn  in  terms  of  offenses  involving  “moral  turpitude.”  That 
concept  can  be  construed  to  include  offenses  concerning  some  matters  of  personal 
morality, such as adultery and comparable offenses, that have no specific connection 
to fitness for the practice of law.  Although a lawyer is personally answerable to the 
entire criminal law, a lawyer should be professionally answerable only for offenses 
that  indicate  lack  of  those  characteristics  relevant  to  law  practice.    Offenses 
involving  violence,  dishonesty,  breach  of  trust,  or  serious  interference  with  the 
administration of justice are in that category.  A pattern of repeated offenses, even 
ones of minor significance when considered separately, can indicate indifference to 
legal obligation. 

A lawyer may refuse to comply with an obligation imposed by law upon a good-faith 
belief  that  no  valid  obligation  exists.    The  provisions  of  Rule  1.2(c)  concerning  a 
good-faith challenge to the validity, scope, meaning, or application of the law apply 
to challenges of legal regulation of the practice of law.  See also Rule 3.4(c). 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct

Lawyers  holding  public  office  assume  legal  responsibilities  going  beyond  those  of 
other citizens.  A lawyer’s abuse of public office can suggest an inability to fulfill the 
professional role of attorney.  The same is true of abuse of positions of private trust 
such  as  trustee,  executor,  administrator,  guardian,  agent,  and  such  as  officer, 
director, or manager of a corporation or other organization. 

Rule 8.5.  Disciplinary Authority; Choice of Law. 

(a)  Disciplinary  Authority.    A  lawyer  admitted  to  practice  in  this  jurisdiction  is 
subject  to  the  disciplinary  authority  of  this  jurisdiction,  regardless  where  the 
lawyer’s conduct occurs.  A lawyer not admitted in this jurisdiction is also subject to 
the  disciplinary  authority  of  this  jurisdiction  if  the  lawyer  provides  or  offers  to 
provide  any  legal  services  in  this  jurisdiction.    A  lawyer  may  be  subject  to  the 
disciplinary authority of both this jurisdiction and another jurisdiction for the same 
conduct. 

(b) Choice of Law.  In any exercise of the disciplinary authority of this jurisdiction, 
the rules of professional conduct to be applied shall be as follows: 

(1)  for  conduct  in  connection  with  a  matter  pending  before  a  tribunal,  the  rules  of 
the  jurisdiction  in  which  the  tribunal  sits,  unless  the  rules  of  the  tribunal  provide 
otherwise; and  

(2) for any other conduct, the rules of the jurisdiction in which the conduct occurred, 
or, if the predominant effect of the conduct is in a different jurisdiction, the rules of 
that  jurisdiction  shall  be  applied  to  the  conduct;  a  lawyer  shall  not  be  subject  to 
discipline if the lawyer’s conduct conforms to the rules of a jurisdiction in which the 
lawyer  reasonably  believes  the  predominant  effect  of  the  lawyer’s  conduct  will 
occur. 

Comment:  

Disciplinary Authority.   

It  is  longstanding  law  that  the  conduct  of  a  lawyer  admitted  to  practice  in  this 
jurisdiction is subject to the disciplinary authority of this jurisdiction.  Extension of 
the  disciplinary  authority  of  this jurisdiction  to  other lawyers who  provide  or  offer 
to  provide  legal  services  in  this  jurisdiction  is  for  the  protection  of  the  citizens  of 
this jurisdiction.  Reciprocal enforcement of a jurisdiction’s disciplinary findings and 
sanctions will further advance the purposes of this rule.  The fact that a lawyer is 
subject  to  the  disciplinary  authority  of  this  jurisdiction  may  be  a  factor  in 
determining whether personal jurisdiction may be asserted over the lawyer in civil 
matters. 

Choice of Law.   

A  lawyer  potentially  may  be  subject  to  more  than  one  set  of  rules  of  professional 
conduct that impose different obligations.  The lawyer may be licensed to practice in 
more  than  one  jurisdiction  with  differing  rules,  or  may  be  admitted  to  practice 

Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct 

106 

Last Updated 9/1/2022 

before  a  particular  court  with  rules  that  differ  from  those  of  the  jurisdiction  or 
jurisdictions in which the lawyer is licensed to practice.  Additionally, the lawyer’s 
conduct may involve significant contacts with more than one jurisdiction. 

Paragraph  (b)  seeks  to  resolve  such  potential  conflicts.    Its  premise  is  that 
minimizing  conflicts  between  rules,  as  well  as  uncertainty  about  which  rules  are 
applicable,  is  in  the  best  interests  of  clients,  the  profession,  and  those  who  are 
authorized to regulate the profession.  Accordingly, paragraph (b) provides that any 
particular conduct of a lawyer shall be subject to only one set of rules of professional 
conduct; makes the determination of which set of rules applies to particular conduct 
as straightforward as possible, consistent with recognition of appropriate regulatory 
interests  of  relevant  jurisdictions;  and  protects  from  discipline  those  lawyers  who 
act reasonably in the face of uncertainty. 

Paragraph (b)(1) provides, as to a lawyer’s conduct relating to a proceeding pending 
before  a  tribunal,  that  the  lawyer  shall  be  subject  only  to  the  rules  of  the 
jurisdiction in which the tribunal sits unless the rules of the tribunal, including its 
choice of law rule, provide otherwise.  As to all other conduct, including conduct in 
anticipation  of  a  proceeding  not  yet  pending  before  a  tribunal,  paragraph  (b)(2) 
provides that a lawyer shall be subject to the rules of the jurisdiction in which the 
lawyer’s conduct occurred or, if the predominant effect of the conduct is in another 
jurisdiction, the lawyer shall be subject to the rules of that jurisdiction.  In the case 
of conduct in anticipation of a proceeding that is likely to be before a tribunal, the 
predominant  effect  of  such  conduct  could  be  either  where  the  conduct  occurred, 
where the tribunal sits, or in another jurisdiction. 

When  a  lawyer’s  conduct  involves  significant  contacts  with  more  than  one 
jurisdiction,  it  may  not  be  clear  initially  whether  the  predominant  effect  of  the 
lawyer’s conduct will occur in a jurisdiction other than the one in which the conduct 
actually  did  occur.    So  long  as  the  lawyer’s  conduct  conforms  to  the  rules  of  a 
jurisdiction  in  which  the  lawyer  reasonably  believes  the  predominant  effect  will 
occur, the lawyer shall not be subject to discipline under this rule. 

If  two  admitting  jurisdictions  were  to  proceed  against  a  lawyer  for  the  same 
conduct,  they  should,  applying  this  rule,  identify  the  same  governing  ethics  rules.  
They  should  take  all  appropriate  steps  to  see  that  they  do  apply  the  same  rule  to 
the  same  conduct  and  should  avoid  proceeding  against  a  lawyer  on  the  basis  of 
inconsistent rules. 

The  choice  of  law  provision  applies  to  lawyers  engaged  in  transnational  practice, 
unless  international  law,  treaties,  or  other  agreements  between  regulatory 
authorities in the affected jurisdictions provide otherwise.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
